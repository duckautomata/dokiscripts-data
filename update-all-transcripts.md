## Initiative

Want to remake all transcripts using the newer model and format.

## Steps

1. Pick a month to update
2. Run `python ./scripts/delete_transcripts.py YYYY-MM` to delete the old transcripts
3. Run `python ./scripts/download_audio.py` to grab the audio files
4. Run `python ./scripts/transcribe_audio.py` to regenerate the transcripts.
5. Run `python ./scripts/organize_years.py --execute` to organize the transcripts into years.
6. Update this file with the month that was updated.

This will not update Twitch or Members transcripts. Those can be updated separately with caution.
