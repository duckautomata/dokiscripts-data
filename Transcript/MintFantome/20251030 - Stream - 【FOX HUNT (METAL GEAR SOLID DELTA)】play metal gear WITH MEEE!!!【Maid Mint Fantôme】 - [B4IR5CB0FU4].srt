1
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,870
We take a brief moment to ignore Halloween.

2
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,990
Because Metal Gear!

3
00:04:51,910 --> 00:05:00,190
Of course I must play the new online mode for the first time with all of you.

4
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,410
Yeah, I hope we can play together.

5
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,950
Welcome, everybody.

6
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,560
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop it, stop it.

7
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,320
Oh, there we go.

8
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,740
Yeah, I'm just going to start the game so that we can...

9
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,260
Unfortunately, we don't have...

10
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,700
Where will it be at?

11
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,250
Now that I think about it.

12
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,620
Extras?

13
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,440
Extras, extras, read all about it.

14
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,820
Wait, where will it be?

15
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,060
Curious.

16
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
Wait, where will it be at?

17
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,260
I told my DM I'd be late for game session, but I didn't tell him that it would be for tactical mid-action.

18
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And as you guys can see, I have a little countdown time.

19
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:25,040
right here um fox hunt mode is not out yet uh it is supposed to be released in 53 minutes from now so um so yeah uh just a little bit of a little bit of a wait but i figured i was like maybe i'll start stream exactly when it starts but then i was like but what if i just want to like sit here and be like yeah we'll have to update the game most likely I'll be like,

20
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,700
what if I was to say that to you guys right now?

21
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,980
So that's why.

22
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,900
Boss, I have a final update about that promotion I applied for.

23
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,800
So the day after my interview, I got a call from the hiring HR director, and I got the job!

24
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,720
Thank you to you and all the whispers for the well-wishes, Solidus, God!

25
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,960
Congratulations!

26
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,320
Congratulations!

27
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,780
Yay!

28
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,640
Yeah.

29
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,520
I know you'd be able to do it.

30
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,680
You got the job.

31
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,580
Solidus Scott.

32
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,640
That's my president.

33
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,400
Oh, let me, sorry, when I click out of the game, it gets rid of the music.

34
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,430
So...

35
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,260
So...

36
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,990
Did you watch the demonstrations of the Fox Hunt modes from TGS?

37
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,390
I'm going in 100% blind.

38
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,770
Well, not 100%.

39
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,090
But I'm going in, like, mostly blind.

40
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,850
I was like, I don't want to see anything.

41
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,790
I kind of want to just...

42
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,770
I want to...

43
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,170
I want to just experience it.

44
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,270
No spoilers.

45
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,050
I'm excited.

46
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,850
I'm half blind.

47
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,690
But what we could do is play Snake versus Monkey in the...

48
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:48,580
meantime can I try it I still haven't played it you have an eye patch that's 50% blind I'm 50% blind go for it let's go for it this is snake I've made it to the sneaking point you're right on time snake yeah for being dragged out of the sack at 2 in the morning I did my best rise and shine don't you love mornings Love warnings.

49
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,000
Nobody loves being dragged away from their vacation.

50
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm sorry, but we needed you.

51
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,420
Something big is going down.

52
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,540
Very big.

53
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,720
That's why.

54
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,460
Oh.

55
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,860
So what is this important mission?

56
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,060
Look at him, Roy Campbell.

57
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
Voice Paul Heiding!

58
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,360
Oh my gosh!

59
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,200
That's so cute!

60
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,380
Any mental gears.

61
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,640
Don't worry.

62
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,360
He's six foot five, five, eighth inches.

63
00:09:15,360 --> 00:10:14,460
If it's like a hot damsel in distress, I'll think about it hot damsel not quite a hot damsel in distress princess at the top of the tower is a rescue mission rescuing who apes apes but not just any monkeys what you said monkeys just listen minkees is to infiltrate the jungle and capture all of the monkeys again you said monkeys yes monkeys this isn't really my thing if you want your monkeys you better have spike or Jimmy unfortunately they weren't available how about me I was on vacation ah we need you if you don't do this who will so true it's not like someone else couldn't handle a stealth mission Jimmy don't say that who's spike or Jimmy we turned over every leaf end why don't you make Sam or Gabe do Sam?

64
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,100
Isn't this just some splinter cell?

65
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,040
Snake?

66
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm asking you.

67
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,400
It's a request from the professor himself.

68
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,640
The professor?

69
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,300
Natalie's grandfather?

70
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,140
Yep, escape emcees.

71
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,940
That's the one.

72
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
The one who came up with the monkey helmet?

73
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,680
Well, that was the professor's classmate.

74
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,880
His classmate?

75
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,020
From high school.

76
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,260
Gave his siphon filter.

77
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,620
Gave dark protocol.

78
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:37,960
Wait.

79
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,140
He's Otakon's friend too.

80
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,020
Oh, Otakon!

81
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,000
It's because of the professor that Otakon has been able to come up with.

82
00:10:44,020 --> 00:11:15,740
with some of his inventions all right what are the details so you'll do it great I'm not against some monkey catching monkey catching rather be collecting pants what the monkeys have fled into the jungle when you what does he mean by that what does he mean but I'm not going to be able to grab them when they're jumping all around the place right right when you've grabbed all the monkeys Your mission is complete.

83
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,280
Huh?

84
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,480
Commencing Operation Ape Snake.

85
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,460
Ape Snake.

86
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,140
When you capture a monkey, yell out the password.

87
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,580
With the password, a warp device will activate.

88
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,260
Pants.

89
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:29,880
Good.

90
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,760
I'm counting on you, Snake.

91
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,100
Yes, Colonel.

92
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,740
Ape fear.

93
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,980
Wait one second.

94
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,000
Unfortunately, I got a high fever today, so I can't play Fox on online.

95
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,260
launch.

96
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,540
No, JK, I don't feel better.

97
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,880
I heard it could be a new app.

98
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,840
Oh, we'll see, I guess, in 47 minutes.

99
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:55,880
We'll see.

100
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,340
Whoa, whoa.

101
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,540
Music.

102
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,040
Whoa.

103
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,460
Gone with the apes.

104
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,700
I wanted to say awesome job in Koa's chaos requiem for it yesterday.

105
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,380
Your singing was absolutely beautiful.

106
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,020
It was super nice.

107
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,000
You didn't make time for it.

108
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,760
What a pleasure to hear you sing.

109
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,040
Thank you.

110
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,380
Yeah, I was in Koa's concert.

111
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,640
She invited me.

112
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,920
And we got to sing Wake Up Girls Together, which is one of my favorite series ever.

113
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,180
Return of the Living Apes.

114
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,560
The Apes of Wrath.

115
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,060
Let's do it.

116
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,280
Let's do Escape from the Jungle.

117
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,880
Snake dashingly rescuing someone, wearing a curious George costume, and blushing Sen Super Chat.

118
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,980
Why the Curious George costume?

119
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,860
Why?

120
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:14,470
For anybody who doesn't know, there was one time when I was like, we-whisp, I had a friend whose mom worked at a college as a professor.

121
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:23,310
And she was like, hey, I need a kid to...

122
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,030
to dress up as a monkey and cause mischief.

123
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,490
And I know the perfect kid for that.

124
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,010
And it was me.

125
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:49,370
And so my friend, he dressed up as the man, the yellow hat, and I was Curious George because I think it was like a, I think it was like a, how do you say, like a anniversary or something for Curious George.

126
00:13:49,890 --> 00:14:03,810
And so I got to run around into classrooms and I got to jump on tables, and I got to, I was mostly in the library, and I was like jumping around as Curious George, and I was just causing a ruckus.

127
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:13,430
I got to skip school, and then I got to brag to everybody that I dressed up as a monkey and didn't have to go to class.

128
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:53,270
But the reason I remember it so vividly, well, part of the reason, besides it being so awesome was I there was one point where I was like I'm gonna jump up on this table and I go to jump up on the table and I hit my knees so bad like you know how it's like there's a part in your knee that's almost like a funny bone I hit that part and I like literally my vision went black I saw stars I fell to the ground and I was like And they were like,

129
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,550
curious, George, stop.

130
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,770
Stop.

131
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,490
Get off the floor, George.

132
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,590
You're such a...

133
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,490
You're such a...

134
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,350
You're making so much noise in the library.

135
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,350
I was not...

136
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,840
Oh, I remember that.

137
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,260
It was so bad.

138
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,280
I was just like...

139
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
I was like, ooh, ooh, ooh.

140
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Oh,

141
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,460
it hurt so bad.

142
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,360
Have you ever seen the episode where George had to manage all of the trains?

143
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,020
I don't think I've ever seen an episode of Curious George.

144
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
I don't think I've ever seen an episode.

145
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,220
I think I just winged it.

146
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,720
I'm a method actress.

147
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,140
Such a minky.

148
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,400
That's like how it was made for me, maybe.

149
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,600
And after that, George was never curious ever again.

150
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,520
We gotta get 10 monkeys!

151
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,940
How do I catch them?

152
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,300
Come here, monkey.

153
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,800
Come here, monkey.

154
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,900
Oh my god, they're so cute.

155
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,350
Come here!

156
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,890
Oh my god, he's beating me up!

157
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,290
Wait, oh my god, he's beating me up all the time!

158
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,490
Wait, what did the instruction say?

159
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,430
I couldn't...

160
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,830
Let me run after him.

161
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,610
Come here.

162
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,090
How do I grab him?

163
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:49,850
Oh!

164
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,310
Gotcha!

165
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,550
I think I was about to run out of time even.

166
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,030
Shoot.

167
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,850
No, bro!

168
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,110
Okay.

169
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,550
Come here!

170
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,810
Gotcha!

171
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,310
It's so quiet now.

172
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:08,730
Wait.

173
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:10,970
Oh.

174
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,270
Come here, monkey.

175
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:19,910
Oh!

176
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,610
Oh, whoop.

177
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,990
Sorry.

178
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,170
Oh, oh.

179
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:24,810
Gotcha.

180
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,490
Oh, wait.

181
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,690
My time isn't going down.

182
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,530
It's going up.

183
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,170
I'm silly.

184
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,150
Oh, my Oh, I just had!

185
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,550
Special!

186
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,790
It was Astro Bot!

187
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,550
Oh my god!

188
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,790
It wasn't even an actual bug, it was Astro Bot!

189
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,510
You're mine!

190
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,630
Wait, how do I...

191
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,990
How do I get him, though?

192
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,150
Go up?

193
00:17:59,330 --> 00:17:59,970
Wait, go up?

194
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,950
Oh, climb, sorry.

195
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,530
How do I get this guy?

196
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,550
Oh.

197
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,210
Oh, where'd he go?

198
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,190
Ah?

199
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:10,730
Ah?

200
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,730
Ah!

201
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,510
Oh!

202
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,270
Oh!

203
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,630
Where are you going?

204
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,550
Oh, okay.

205
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,550
Oh, just kidding.

206
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,250
Oh, dang, that was close.

207
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,490
Oh, that was close.

208
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,330
That was...

209
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:22,770
Where are you going?

210
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,530
Hold on!

211
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,510
Hold on, my key!

212
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,690
There's a path up there.

213
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,650
Well, I never knew.

214
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:31,970
Where'd he go?

215
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,710
Oh, there he is.

216
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:33,970
Is this the last monkey?

217
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,050
No, we have many more.

218
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,510
Oh wait, there's one right there!

219
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,570
Don't say minky, eh?

220
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,710
I'm using tilt controls.

221
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,530
Okay.

222
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,730
Bam, snake.

223
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,370
Well, wait, where's the pathway then?

224
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,690
Oh, over here.

225
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,890
There must be more.

226
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,190
Oh!

227
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:57,670
Ah!

228
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,270
Holy cow.

229
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,250
Scared me.

230
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,510
I'm using tilt controls.

231
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,530
Gotcha.

232
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,430
I never knew this was up here.

233
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,170
Wait, I can't go this way.

234
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,730
There's still two more.

235
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,010
Little monkey.

236
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,650
Little monkey, where are you?

237
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,130
Nice gifts.

238
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,150
Oh my gosh.

239
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:26,670
Say elf.

240
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,650
Thank you so much for that gift.

241
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,750
Thank you!

242
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you, I really appreciate it.

243
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,670
Aha!

244
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
Look at him crawling.

245
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,120
Gotcha!

246
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,780
One more monkey for my collection!

247
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Where could you be?

248
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,420
Where are you at?

249
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,940
Little monkey.

250
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,900
Come home with me!

251
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,300
Whisp chasing after Minky the Ghost who's causing mischief.

252
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,080
Yeah.

253
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,340
Well, if you have fun tonight, unfortunately, Foxhunt launches way past my old man time on work nights.

254
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,740
I know, it's so late, right?

255
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,040
Whatever, consider original ape escape.

256
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
Yeah, I would like to play them.

257
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,030
Guys, we have one monkey lost.

258
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,370
Where could he be?

259
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,470
Where could he be?

260
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,690
This is the first level.

261
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:49,490
level in the trees maybe he's hanging over the ledge no bottom right

262
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,720
where could it be i

263
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:16,010
heard him i thought i did i heard him

264
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,800
speed running time It's already fultoned out of here.

265
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,320
No!

266
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,620
Hold on.

267
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,980
I'm gonna look around.

268
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,580
Why is this guy eluding me so much?

269
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,030
I don't remember where he is.

270
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,870
He's really hidden for me.

271
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,450
Hiding in the garage.

272
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,310
But I would see his hat.

273
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,170
No?

274
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,330
What is this mode?

275
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,420
Why have I forgotten how to...

276
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,920
Okay, here we go.

277
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,920
I was like, I've forgotten how to...

278
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,240
Okay, we only have scope.

279
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,080
I've forgotten how to use the controls in this game.

280
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,100
Let's try the mic.

281
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,080
Are those monkey noises?

282
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
Are those monkey noises?

283
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,220
Oh my god!

284
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,780
What's wrong with him?

285
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,020
Why is he screeching?

286
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,470
Oh.

287
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,850
Talented.

288
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
No wonder I couldn't find him.

289
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,120
Oh.

290
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,100
Are you okay?

291
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,260
Oh.

292
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,010
I didn't get a good score.

293
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,010
That's okay, though.

294
00:23:32,150 --> 00:24:06,300

What?

297
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,300
What?

298
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:13,780
What?

299
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,800
Do you get out of time for...

300
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,640
Oh!

301
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,680
Oh my god.

302
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,680
Oh, what the hell?

303
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,160
Hello?

304
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:26,920
Oh my god.

305
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,600
Wait.

306
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,600
Let me shoot you.

307
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,280
There we go.

308
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,500
He blocked the shot!

309
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,080
Astrobot!

310
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,700
Oh my

311
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,100
god!

312
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,260
I swear.

313
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,400
Save him!

314
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,540
Wait, do I shoot?

315
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,220
Astrobot?

316
00:24:59,560 --> 00:24:59,840
Ah!

317
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,840
Oh my gosh.

318
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,520
They wake up really fast, actually.

319
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,800
Okay, hold on.

320
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,460
Ow!

321
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,820
Gotcha!

322
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:18,700
Guys, I think this is like, this mode specifically feels made for me.

323
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,480
I'm obsessed.

324
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,780
The pose is too good.

325
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,120
You're mine.

326
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,180
And so are you.

327
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,820
Oh, I winked, but you couldn't tell.

328
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,940
It's my birthday tonight!

329
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,740
Wait, what did he say?

330
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,940
What is he doing?

331
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,320
Why is he freaking out like that?

332
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,560
Go on to the Metal Gear Solid series because of you.

333
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,400
Oh my goodness, that guy was aggressive.

334
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,260
Boy, I didn't get to see the rest of your message.

335
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,600
Camouflage.

336
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,100
Wait, who saw me?

337
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,340
Oh.

338
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,480
He's dodging?

339
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:34,700
Oh.

340
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,300
Why does he do that?

341
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,640
Wait, oh my gosh, if I aim, there we go.

342
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,420
Oh, just kidding.

343
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
I don't want to shoot this guy.

344
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,700
He's going through it.

345
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,820
Oh, he looks like me these past couple of days.

346
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,060
Oh.

347
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh, gosh.

348
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,960
We just box him up.

349
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,120
Oh.

350
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,780
I feel like we're getting the really obvious ones.

351
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,760
Whoop!

352
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,760
I'm bullying.

353
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,580
Should miss my super.

354
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,020
What?

355
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,820
I'm playing a timed mode.

356
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,780
I'll go back and rid once I'm done.

358
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,040
Well, I guess it doesn't really...

359
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,790
It looks so...

360
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,930
It's just...

361
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,930
It looks so like...

362
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,130
Wait.

363
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,090
Bonk, bonk, bonk.

364
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,130
Lion King.

365
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,190
You had me dying near the end of Harvester when you said, Mommy, you're so good.

366
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,090
You're so good.

367
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,150
Mommy, you're so good.

368
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,110
You're so good.

369
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,030
You're so good.

370
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,910
Roadrunner cartoons.

371
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,730
Wait.

372
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,830
Let's see.

373
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,290
Secret of Minky Island.

374
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,030
I hear...

375
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,170
Oh!

376
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,130
I see him.

377
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,350
Oh!

378
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,890
I see that guy too!

379
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,310
You're sleepy.

380
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,450
You're sleepy.

381
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,610
Oh!

382
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,630
That was it!

383
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,130
Yippee!

384
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,350
Oh!

385
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:08,050

387
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,960
i love this place because it's the first time we ever meet him.

388
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:35,920
What?

389
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,180
Whoa, there's a huge party!

390
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:42,900
Minky!

391
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,740
That's me.

392
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,700
Don't wear it out.

393
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,620
What are they crawling around there for?

394
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,020
I can't line it up at all.

395
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,700
Oh, bad shot.

396
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,080
They're crawling.

397
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,840
This guy is just, like, walking normal.

398
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,700
Okay.

399
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,530
100% summon the crawl space.

400
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,350
Oh yeah, I was thinking that too.

401
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,270
That was 100% thinking that too.

402
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,490
The embrace.

403
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,930
He doesn't even notice his friend isn't talking to him anymore.

404
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,550
Oh.

405
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,510
The music is killing me.

406
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,230
Run,

407
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,470
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

408
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,130
Maybe not his friend.

409
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,470
He's like, yeah, I'm glad that guy's out.

410
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,830
Glad that guy's out of the picture.

411
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,530
Okay, we'll definitely...

412
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,090
We'll stun grenade these friends.

413
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,670
Oh.

414
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,650
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have been looking at it.

415
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,950
You have a revolver.

416
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,190
Yeah.

417
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,090
Wombo-combo!

418
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,070
Holy moly.

419
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,230
Oh, this guy here too.

420
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,090
Oh, shoot.

421
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,010
Ouch.

422
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,810
He woke up.

423
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,170
Hey!

424
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,350
Wait, I think he was...

425
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,730
Wait, I want to see what he was doing.

426
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:38,470
Oops.

427
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,810
Hey, don't be...

428
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,550
Don't be...

429
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:41,810
Oops.

430
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,520
Whoop!

431
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,140
Who saw me?

432
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,780
Oops.

433
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Oops.

434
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,480
Oh my gosh.

435
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,200
I'm so stupid.

436
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:53,900
Oh my god.

437
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,680
I can't shoot.

438
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,340
Guys.

439
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,240
Ow!

440
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,320
Dang it!

441
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,770
Yeah, Astrobot's a little guy in this game too.

442
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,650
It's so fun.

443
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,690
So happy he's around.

444
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,970
Like, what are the odds that I love Astrobot so much?

445
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,390
And... Ah!

446
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,190
Ay!

447
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,110
You!

448
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,950
Stankin' monkeys!

449
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,690
This is how everybody in the college felt.

450
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,990
Astrobot, don't worry, I'm not gonna shoot you yet.

451
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,350
No!

452
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,830
Oh my gosh.

453
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,110
Here, mine!

454
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,670
Wait, give me up there.

455
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,750
Give me up there.

456
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,230
Oh gosh, my controller.

457
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:54,670
Give me.

458
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,430
Woo!

459
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,550
Um, where did the out of strobot go?

460
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,560
Where'd the music...

461
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,840
Oh, there it's coming from here!

462
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,940
That's so cute.

463
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,060
Oh, this guy's just drinking a cup of...

464
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,860
Grab him!

465
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,640
I think I'm...

466
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,560
That's my favorite one.

467
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,760
Ah!

468
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,840
Oh.

469
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,400
Did he just throw...

470
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,060
He's throwing rocks at me!

471
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,680
Oh my gosh.

472
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,440
Hey.

473
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:54,960
Wait.

474
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,860
Oh, shoot.

475
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,360
There we go.

476
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,560
I interrupted his cuppa.

477
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,420
I sure did.

478
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,260
Yeah, I saw what you were doing on the bed.

479
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,680
One little monkey jumping on the bed.

480
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,780
What's he doing there?

481
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,680
Yeah.

482
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,960
I definitely...

483
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,080
Oh.

484
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,760
She scared me.

485
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,680
Got you.

486
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,000
You're mine.

487
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,260
Any monkeys underneath?

488
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,440
I hear one.

489
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,260
Any monkeys in here?

490
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,520
How are you supposed to do these missions in a minute?

491
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:45,960
How?

492
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,860
There's no monkey in the crawl space?

493
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,680
I feel like I got...

494
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,480
Oh, I haven't tried the roof, you're right.

495
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,780
But I still feel a little cheated.

496
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,650
You probably have to memorize all the monkey locations, yeah.

497
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,750
Oops, whoa, sorry.

498
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,690
I was... I accidentally hit the trigger.

499
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,470
Wherever you are!

500
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,430
Oh, nope!

501
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,690
I clicked retry on action and sorry.

502
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,730
Three, two, I won't.

503
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,290
There we go.

504
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,190
I don't want to do...

505
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,370
retries just because we have...

506
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,010
What's the word?

507
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,770
Limited time.

508
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,650
Speed run!

509
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,130
I know the victory pose is too good.

510
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,490
21 ape fear.

511
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,380
Whoa.

512
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,780
Whoa.

513
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,100
If anybody can read Russian, what does that say?

514
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,980
Mesogear?

515
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:28,280
What did...

516
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,800
Oh.

517
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,660
Oh, that was close.

518
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,700
This is running.

519
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,340
running around.

520
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,090
I can also get you.

521
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,460
Got you.

522
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,560
They wake up so quickly.

523
00:36:59,620 --> 00:36:59,660
They wake up so quickly.

524
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,680
Oh my gosh.

525
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,460
Take them down.

526
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:18,380
Even still, I feel like I'm so slow to be able to get all these guys and an amp in a, you know, decent amount of time.

527
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,000
Minky gear.

528
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,960
Wow, look at him up there!

529
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,500
Oh my gosh!

530
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,200
Too cute.

531
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,940
This mode is the best.

532
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,200
What are they doing in there?

533
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,980
Oh.

534
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,160
Some new sort of waza.

535
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:43,840
Oh!

536
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
Somebody saw me.

537
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, there we go.

538
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,820
Oh, sorry, I was looking at it again.

539
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,780
My bad.

540
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,920
How did you?

541
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,160
Wait, why aren't you asleep?

542
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,580
I only got one guy.

543
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:00,560
Ah!

544
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:01,720
Me,

545
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,720
so gear!

546
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,780
Oh, where'd they go?

547
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,440
Oh.

548
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,580
Oh.

549
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,680
Oh.

550
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,540
I love the proud...

551
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,960
Proud father is so good.

552
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,200
We're looking away?

553
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:29,920
Gotcha!

554
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,940
It's Astroba!

555
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,830
You're mine!

556
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,680
I wonder if the guy is like up...

557
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,040
I guess they would just jump back if I didn't get...

558
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,200
Get them in time.

559
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,160
Who's...

560
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,160
Who's...

561
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,300
Who spotted me?

562
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,060
Oh, whoops.

563
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,400
Oh my gosh.

564
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,720
There we go.

565
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,400
It's so sensual.

566
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,220
Are they inside here, too?

567
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,700
Oh, no.

568
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:20,920
Oh.

569
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,520
Ah!

570
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,320
It's a good thing I looked, though.

571
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,940
That guy was tricky.

572
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,920
It's a good thing.

573
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,740
It's a monkey.

574
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,780
It's a monkey.

575
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,970
Don't run from me.

576
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,210
You're pretty good.

577
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,350
Thanks.

578
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,110
Wait, do you think there's one inside?

579
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:50,710
Nope.

580
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,190
Okay, I don't think we can go inside any of the buildings.

581
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,570
I hear you.

582
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,070
I don't...

583
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,950
Oh my gosh.

584
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,350
Don't die.

585
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,330
Dive.

586
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,490
Don't die either.

587
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:08,910
Oh my gosh.

588
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,570
Stop teasing me.

589
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,950
I am.

590
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,030
I'm doko.

591
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,970
I'm using tilt controls.

592
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,110
Please excuse.

593
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,590
Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.

594
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,700
Okay.

595
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,920
one guy is up here.

596
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,600
But I want to get him last.

597
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,820
I hear one.

598
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,880
Maybe up on the roof?

599
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,840
I want to get that guy last.

600
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,720
Maybe on the rooftop.

601
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,080
My dear Aunt Sally is excused.

602
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,300
Thank you.

603
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh!

604
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,260
Wait, what are you doing?

605
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,300
Is that a ration?

606
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,000
That's not for monkeys.

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,830
Oh, gosh, it scared me.

618
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,210
Lazy bones over there.

619
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,160
Ah, don't hit me.

620
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,360
Oh.

621
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,800
Let's go run and grab...

622
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,020
Ah!

623
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,360
Oh!

624
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,420
Get him!

625
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:49,660
Get him!

626
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:49,880
Get him!

627
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,400
There's a Bomberman mode?

628
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,160
Yeah, but it's only for...

629
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,680
Oh, it's so...

630
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,820
It's so sensual.

631
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,680
It's only for Xbox.

632
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,860
Stop!

633
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,540
Stop!

634
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,460
Stop it!

635
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,080
Stop it!

636
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,480
Where'd he go?

637
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,280
That other guy.

638
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,040
Oh!

639
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:14,880
Where?

640
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,200
Oh, hey!

641
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,280
Come back here!

642
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:18,780
Ah!

643
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,220
Oh, dang, he dodged.

644
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,660
Stop resisting.

645
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,040
Alright.

646
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,400
So far.

647
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,260
Not bad.

648
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,200
Oh, timing.

649
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,940
Oh, that could have been better.

650
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,240
Oh, my gosh.

651
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,520
Don't do that.

652
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,120
I did save Astrobot, but did he want to be saved?

653
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:43,760
Oh.

654
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,300
You're mine!

655
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,100
This guy looks traumatized.

656
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,100
I like how we suddenly...

657
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,240
Oh.

658
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,740
What the hell was he about to do?

659
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,320
He was staring at the grab-your-model!

660
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,500
Naughty monkey.

661
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,460
Naughty naughty.

662
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,440
Oh, oops, my bad.

663
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:07,800
Ow!

664
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,840
That's fine, I got him.

665
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,840
Wait, who else is out here?

666
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,020
Who else is out here?

667
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,420
on me.

668
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,520
So far, we're making great time, though.

669
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,680
Wait, come on, come on, come on.

670
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,240
Oh, over there, over there.

671
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:19,620
No!

672
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,500
Bad time!

673
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,260
No, no!

674
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,920
Don't leave!

675
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,860
Oh my gosh, please.

676
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,260
Ah!

677
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,280
Okay, okay, I got him.

678
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Happy year to have, Vicky!

679
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,060
Thank you, souls!

680
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,020
Thank you!

681
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,180
Okay.

682
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,280
Just saw Kana Udo's new mint video.

683
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,160
Wait, what?

684
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,540
What did that guy do?

685
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,180
I don't even know what you're talking about.

686
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,320
Huh?

687
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,020
Huh?

688
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,140
What did that guy do?

689
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:47,760
Oh.

690
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:48,780
Oh.

691
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,800
I hear monkey.

692
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,740
I hear monkey.

693
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,100
Gamers don't look up.

694
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,820
Monkey not up.

695
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,380
Monkey.

696
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,500
Monkey missing.

697
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,500
Missy monkey?

698
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:58,600
Okay.

699
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't think we're making time.

700
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,100
Gotcha.

701
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,120
Uh.

702
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:09,740
Oh.

703
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,790
Maybe I can get him in time.

704
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:22,790
Oh my gosh.

705
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:22,990
I did.

706
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,990
but I don't know if I can grab these guys and him at the same time!

707
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,210
Wait, there's one more?

708
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:31,610
No?

709
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,710
Ah, I don't think I'm

710
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:38,730
getting...

711
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,710
Good time, good time.

712
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:42,730
Okay?

713
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,450
Go, go, go.

714
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,210
Go, go, go!

715
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,680
Suddenly we're outside.

716
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,620
Um... Oh!

717
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,080
Oh!

718
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,160
Oh!

719
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,050
Dang it.

720
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,110
Wait, where do you go?

721
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,570
Suddenly we're outside again.

722
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,810
Oh no, I don't think that it's going to make it.

723
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,010
Maybe it will.

724
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,750
Yes!

725
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,970
What the hell do I get to the guy over on the other side?

726
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,850
There was a guy over here, right?

727
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:28,910
Oh, sheesh.

728
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,590
Wait, drop.

729
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:31,410
Drop.

730
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:32,930
Drop.

731
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:33,350
Snake.

732
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:34,650
Or don't.

733
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:38,070
Don't break your ankles today, fine.

734
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,790
Two more!

735
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,410
Oh gosh.

736
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:44,550
Drop.

737
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:45,930
Oh, wait.

738
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:46,730
I forgot to...

739
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,730
I didn't press let go.

740
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:49,590
Let go.

741
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,190
Let go.

742
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:53,770
This way?

743
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,930
We need to find that other guy.

744
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,200
What can I do?

745
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,260
What does that guy do?

746
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,640
You guys are scaring me.

747
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:12,190
No.

748
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:12,570
Oh.

749
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:14,890
Eh?

750
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,010
Monkey.

751
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,170
Oh, uh-uh.

752
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,150
Look in my suit.

753
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,390
It's full of bananas.

754
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,370
It looks really delicious to you, but...

755
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,810
How do I get to the outside?

756
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,230
What?

757
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,550
What is this?

758
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,330
Oh, climb.

759
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,750
Is there a monkey up?

760
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,230
Monkey down?

761
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:35,930
Monkey all around?

762
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,830
Maybe I shoot him?

763
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,710
and then it falls.

764
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,970
I doubt it, but I could try.

765
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,290
I was right.

766
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,510
My gamer instincts.

767
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:50,550
Gotcha.

768
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:51,770
You're mine.

769
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,790
Okay, I think we do have to use the microphone for this last guy, though.

770
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,310
Oh.

771
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,630
Oh.

772
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:01,790
Upstairs, maybe?

773
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,520
My gamer instinct.

774
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,420
Last monkey.

775
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,300
We had such a good time at first.

776
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,540
Is it down there?

777
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,780
It's so quiet now.

778
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,800
Maybe he is downstairs.

779
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,940
Hold on.

780
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,340
I don't want to go downstairs just yet.

781
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,540
Maybe he was in the bathroom.

782
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh,

783
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,120
thank you for the pre-thumbrax!

784
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,160
Welcome everybody!

785
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,460
I love this game.

786
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,740
Way too much.

787
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,320
We have less than 10 minutes until...

788
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,120
Until, until...

789
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,040
Oh, I guess we could do...

790
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,920
Which one should we do?

791
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,840
The one with missile gear or should we do the one in the...

792
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,280
This one seems to be quite short because it doesn't have a lot of time or...

793
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,160
Probably less monkeys.

794
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,560
Thank you guys for the...

795
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:41,560
gifted!

796
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,200
I guess you have two Murphy!

797
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,720
Thank you!

798
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

799
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you guys!

800
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:52,980
Try and do both?

801
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,000
Okay, we can do both!

802
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

803
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,200
Well, this one's 16.

804
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,220
Oh wait, I did it out!

805
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,300
Wait, I did it out of order!

806
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,120
My bad.

807
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,860
WMJ, thank you!

808
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,280
Oh my gosh, the Kappa.

809
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,190
Three, two, one, start!

810
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:17,270
Oh!

811
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,310
Oh, he's right in front of me.

812
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,220
I can't see the...

813
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,220
If I...

814
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,680
Oh my gosh, wait, oh my gosh, oh no!

815
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,580
One of them didn't go to sleep.

816
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:38,500
Startle!

817
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,220
Happy birthday!

818
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,700
It kind of feels kind of messed up being in here, I feel.

819
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,360
Wait, oh my gosh.

820
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:48,660
What?

821
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
Wait, did I not get him?

822
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,220
Oh, I know.

823
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,340
There's just gonna be monkeys everywhere running around!

824
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,020
Sorry I didn't get to actually read your super chat, but I can see everybody.

825
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,580
Oh.

826
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,660
I got... I couldn't see the crosshair.

827
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,680
Oh, maybe how does she...

828
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,160
Maybe.

829
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,100
Oh my gosh, I still can't see the crosshair sometimes.

830
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,000
Sometimes it's so tricky.

831
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,980
With my eyes.

832
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,200
Fun!

833
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,640
So lame!

834
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,000
Is it because they had glasses?

835
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,020
Oh.

836
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,740
Oh, geez.

837
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,540
I know I'm just gonna...

838
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,540
Oh, that was Astrobot.

839
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,460
Oh my gosh, there's a guy here!

840
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,720
Wait, move, move, move!

841
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,520
Wait, move!

842
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,240
I suck at this!

843
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,300
My Virgo, happy birthday!

844
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,760
Sorry, I'm missing all of these.

845
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,260
It's because I'm trying to capture- Ow!

846
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,820
He's throwing rocks at me!

847
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,620
Oh, the petals turned red.

848
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,540
That's kind of messed up.

849
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,900
Oh my gosh, I can't see my crosshair.

850
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,080
Where's my crosshair?

851
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:23,660
Oh, there it is.

852
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,620
And I can't hit him.

853
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,880
That's Astrobot!

854
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,540
Get up, Snake.

855
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,600
Astrobot.

856
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,820
Astrobot.

857
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,860
He is astrobot.

858
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,480
Not a monkey.

859
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,820
This guy's throwing the rocks.

860
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,220
I'm really...

861
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,680
Really stinking rude of you.

862
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,920
Get ready.

863
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,520
rocked he's rocking my world you know what i mean

864
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:21,280
you think i get no i'm just gonna take them down with my hands take them down with my hands

865
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,500
oh oh i couldn't see my crosshair sorry Why is it so hard for me today?

866
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,000
It's because I'm half blind.

867
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,760
Wait, wait, there's one more.

868
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,200
He's not on top of the...

869
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,640
Oh, there he is.

870
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,680
He's just been chilling this whole time.

871
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,600
I've been fighting for my afterlife.

872
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,580
I had a nickel for every MGS obsessed Oshi I'd have.

873
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,800
Okay, I'd have a nickel.

874
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,600
Here's a few nickels.

875
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,120
What is this pose?

876
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,940
Spank, thank you!

877
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,540
Thank you, thank you!

878
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,640
We have five minutes.

879
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,080
I think I can do this one and...

880
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,020
It might be a little longer than five minutes, but...

881
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,520
But...

882
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,560
That will give time for maybe if it needs like a minute.

883
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,480
YouTube recommended your cover of Snake Eater to me.

884
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,480
Almost made me cry!

885
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,840
Did you have training and singing?

886
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,280
A little.

887
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,540
Um, just only as a kid, though.

888
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,800
Three, two, one.

889
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:41,680
Bing!

890
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,080
Bing, bong, bing, bong, bing, bong!

891
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,140
I was gonna say there's gotta be a guy up here.

892
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,560
All those monkeys are on top of missile gear!

893
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,260
This is no place to be monkeying around!

894
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,520
Gotcha!

895
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,160
Can I drop?

896
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,460
Whew!

897
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,860
You okay, Snake?

898
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,480
Sorry.

899
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,140
Maybe I can get all of them.

900
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,510
Oh, that was pretty good!

901
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,510
Wait, that was... that was clean!

902
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,090
That was so clean!

903
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,950
Ape Eater!

904
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,430
Bombo combo, baby!

905
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,070
Nice!

906
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:35,970
That was clean!

907
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,450
That was the cleanest I'll ever have ever!

908
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,590
Da-da-da-da!

909
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,310
Is there anybody over here?

910
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:45,550
Okay.

911
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,070
Wait, I see somebody up there though.

912
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,430
We can go this way.

913
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,290
Bum-bum.

914
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,210
Bum-bum.

915
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,270
Okay.

916
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,030
You never know.

917
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:02,810
Wait, they're gonna see me for real.

918
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,410
Bum-bum.

919
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,420
Maybe not.

920
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,680
The guy chungling.

921
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,440
Oh wait, I'm sorry.

922
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,360
I didn't look.

923
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,240
I didn't look away.

924
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:28,700
I forgot.

925
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,800
Such is the case with me.

926
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,120
Since I first played NGS3 on the first raid on PS2, I missed out on this game mode.

927
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,210
I can do this.

928
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:43,770
I can do this.

929
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,250
Wait.

930
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:54,710
What?

931
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:55,450
Okay.

932
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:56,970
Okay.

933
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,110
I think the game bugged for me as far as I can.

934
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,990
Why does he do that?

935
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,750
Proud father.

936
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,390
Bear hug.

937
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,650
Big, big hug.

938
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,690
We still have 10 monkeys.

939
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,670
I mean...

940
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,130
Oh, shoot.

941
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,680
I think he loves the monkeys.

942
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,820
But not in love with the monkeys.

943
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,820
I hear them screaming above me.

944
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,440
You think there's going to be any guys in here?

945
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,200
Oh, maybe not.

946
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,730
Maybe down over here.

947
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:58,650
Wait, I think I hear one.

948
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,290
I don't think I hear one.

949
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:04,330
Oh.

950
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:09,610
No one.

951
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:09,950
Oh, wait.

952
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,570
No one hiding?

953
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:14,350
For real?

954
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,090
One minute left!

955
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,340
I'm so excited!

956
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,080
So I mentioned the pinpost, but I will be playing...

957
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,720
I'm on PC, obviously.

958
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,680
So I don't think there's a cross.

959
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,530
Uh oh, wait, I gotta be fast.

960
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:44,670
I gotta be real fast.

961
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,130
Gotcha.

962
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,070
Wait, I gotta be super fast.

963
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,230
So, um, wait, how do I get up there over here?

964
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,290
Do do do do do.

965
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:03,670
Ah!

966
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,530
Oh my gosh.

967
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:09,990
Oh my gosh!

968
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,350
Wait, did they all leave?

969
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:12,370
They did!

970
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,230
They're all freaked out!

971
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,070
They're all freaked out!

972
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,160
Uh oh, wait, uh, I...

973
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,570
I was holding down my D-pad and it for some reason wasn't switching.

974
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,330
And then I forgot to look away.

975
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,990
I did get that guy.

976
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:39,290
No!

977
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:40,490
No!

978
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,230
I got your booty!

979
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:44,630
Draw!

980
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,970
That was a good pose too.

981
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,390
Why would you look so sad?

982
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,190
Why would you look so sad being held by a snake like that?

983
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,530
Couldn't be.

984
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,510
Wait, hold on.

985
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,460
I'll never let go.

986
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,820
I'll never let...

987
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,800
Oh, dang it.

988
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,200
Oh, I need to get up there.

989
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,940
Ah, okay.

990
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,920
I'll never let go, John.

991
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:25,230
Okay.

992
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:26,050
Ah!

993
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:27,170
Oh!

994
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,290
Oh, you...

995
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,590
Actual bastard.

996
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,750
Ah!

997
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,400
Where'd he go?

998
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,120
Throwing rocks at me!

999
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,400
He heard that.

1000
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,260
Yeah, he did.

1001
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,240
Um...

1002
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,880
Where else?

1003
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,140
We have one more!

1004
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,360
Where could he be?

1005
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,560
I guess let's just check the other side.

1006
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,720
I haven't gone over there.

1007
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:03,640
Draw!

1008
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,220
Oh, that's why you guys are saying that.

1009
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,920
Nah, well, thank you so much for the film to be gifted.

1010
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,300
Thank you.

1011
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,080
Okay, I lost him.

1012
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,780
Maybe he's right here.

1013
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,200
No?

1014
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:29,930
I hear him?

1015
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,130
Oh, my gosh.

1016
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,710
Please, please, snake.

1017
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,470
Snake, snake, snake, stop.

1018
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:37,610
Snake, get up.

1019
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,020
What's he doing?

1020
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,820
He's like jumping all around.

1021
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:52,500
Maybe.

1022
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,480
I don't think so.

1023
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,420
I don't think under.

1024
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,350
Is he up top?

1025
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:07,030
Oh yeah, he's definitely up there.

1026
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:09,530
Oh yeah.

1027
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,010
I have to go all the way around again.

1028
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,300
Well, while I'm getting this last guy.

1029
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:23,880
You all.

1030
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,460
Wait, I think he's going to jump down, though, as soon as I...

1031
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
like walk past missile gear.

1032
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,940

Okay, okay, thank you.

1036
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,600
There he is!

1037
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,820
He won't let me hang.

1038
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:57,050
Hang!

1039
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:57,950

Downloading all of our comments.

fly beyond the hazy borders of my heart I can see a place, it's something like this Every now and then I don't know what to do Still I know that I can never go back All the things I've seen in those hazy dreams Can't compare to what I see tonight Everything's so different That it brings me to my knees And oh,

1109
01:09:55,050 --> 01:11:18,670
I know surrounded me I won't give into it now I know that world is is the only way my heart can go I hear your voice calling out to me you'll never be alone what can I do for you what can I do for you 50% what can I do for you what can I do for you I don't plan on looking back on my own life I don't ever plan to feel I own you Even by chance everything should go wrong You come in one day and try to save me If from time to time it's an upward climb All I know is that I must believe Cause the truth I'm seeking always was inside of me And the real emotion has surrounded me The many things that you taught me then Will always be enough to get me through the pain Because of you I am strong enough To know I'm not alone 75,

1110
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:22,130
76, 77% Oh my gosh, 78!

1111
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,850
Wait, the song might be over by the time it's done!

1112
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,630
What can I do for you?

1113
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,050
What can I do for you?

1114
01:11:47,270 --> 01:12:32,610
I can hear you And if I find the real without the motion Has surrounded me And I can't go on And you are there The moment that I close my eyes You comfort me We are connected for all of time I'll never be alone I know the world of real emotion Has surrounded me Don't give in to it now I know that forward is the only way my heart can go I hear your voice calling out to me It's time to play Fox Hunt What can I do for you?

1115
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,490
What can I do for you?

1116
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:38,330
I can hear you What can I do for you?

1117
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,210
What can I do for you?

1118
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,030
What can I do for you?

1119
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:48,470
I can hear you I can hear you.

1120
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:54,940
Yeah!

1121
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,900
Perfect timing!

1122
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,920
That was incredible!

1123
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,060
Alrighty.

1124
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,080
All it took was one song.

1125
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,040
God, this...

1126
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,600
this title screen just makes me...

1127
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,840
Oh yeah.

1128
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,600
Foxhunt!

1129
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,900
So you went to exit Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake and open Foxhine, yeah.

1130
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,660
It is a separate win-

1131
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,990
Back to Apescape.

1132
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:58,730
One second.

1133
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:00,490
Oh, gosh, everything is...

1134
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:02,590
Everything is different?

1135
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:03,610
Everything is new?

1136
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:08,450
And scary, and I probably need to fix my...

1137
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,830
Yeah, I'm lagging.

1138
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,010
Oh, game lag.

1139
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,150
Oh, game really lag.

1140
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:21,450
Oh, I'm from the United States of America.

1141
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:22,590
Ah!

1142
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,110
You want me to pick a place?

1143
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,430
New York!

1144
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:33,030
Agree.

1145
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,370
Agree.

1146
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,190
I have to.

1147
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,650
Pick Alaska.

1148
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,190
Oh, I shouldn't pick Alaska.

1149
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,730
I pick New York as MGS2.

1150
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,350
Fox unit cadets.

1151
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,210
Wait, but I want to fix my window, please.

1152
01:14:54,550 --> 01:15:02,150
The purpose of Fox unit members is to improve the abilities required of Fox unit members and to determine which of you operatives are best suited to serve in the unit.

1153
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:03,770
Snake Stoke blob.

1154
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:09,610
We ask that you use Fox Hunt to hone your skills and prove that you have what it takes to serve in this unit.

1155
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,950
Well, I'm still East Coast.

1156
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:13,110
We have prepared a slideshow for you to watch.

1157
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,130
All Fox Hunt missions are based on actual battle scenarios.

1158
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:21,090
scenarios faced by Fox Unit out in the field.

1159
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:26,890
Therefore, your gear is limited to just your survival knife and AT camera.

1160
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:27,270
Oh.

1161
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,790
Everything else will need to be procured on site.

1162
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:30,830
Ah, I'm used to that.

1163
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:37,750
The on-site procurement of weapons and equipment needed to complete a mission will be simulated here through the use of supply boxes.

1164
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:45,690
Additionally, in order to maximize your training efficiency, we will be evaluating you across a series of mission phases.

1165
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:50,850
At the end of each phase, those that fail to advance will be battle royale.

1166
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:53,810
What?

1167
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:58,610
This is your all-terrain camouflage suit, otherwise known as AT Camo.

1168
01:15:58,890 --> 01:15:59,730
AT Camo.

1169
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:06,210
Pulling a rip cord attached to your bag activates a gas canister that automatically deploys and equips your suit.

1170
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:07,030
Oh my god.

1171
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:07,510
Whoa!

1172
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,130
Including stored gilly parts as well.

1173
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:09,650
Whoa!

1174
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:15,230
If you deploy gilly parts that match your surroundings, it'll make your camo even more effective.

1175
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:53,370
looks like chocolate you've mastered it as part of your training but i'd like to go over the topic of naked sense once more naked sense is a special new technique that sharpens your five senses in order to help you search your surroundings it enables you to detect threats and supplies in your vicinity okay naked sense next i'd like to go over the rules for each mission type mission survival The mission type is designed to mimic infiltration missions to focus on retrieving top secret materials or rescuing important individuals.

1176
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:55,550
It's a escort mission.

1177
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:00,690
You need to track the asset and secure it before the completion of each phase, or you will be removed from the mission.

1178
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:01,250
No!

1179
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,990
Mission, survival, intrusion.

1180
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,310
Can you guys carry me?

1181
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:13,590
This mission type is designed to mimic infiltration missions focused on retrieving an asset and securing a landing zone until an allied helicopter arrives.

1182
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:32,770
In a designated zone at the end of each phase Or you will be removed from the mission That concludes the briefing It is like a battle royale There is no time to waste So please start making your preparations for the mission I wish you luck That's me Baby

1183
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:50,330
Mission basics Fox hunt consists of various missions designed to improve The abilities required of Fox unit members And to see which operatives Are the best of the best Missions consist of two players per team and can feature up to a total of 12 players.

1184
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:57,590
As phases progress, any players who do not meet the requirements will be removed from the mission and the last surviving team will successfully complete the mission.

1185
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:01,890
The requirements for completing a phase differ according to the mission type.

1186
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:09,250
In order to accomplish your mission, it is important to not just eliminate your enemies, but to know when to stay hidden and avoid detection as well.

1187
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,250
Oh, starting a mission while on base camp.

1188
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,370
Then he can create the room!

1189
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,590
Wait!

1190
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:19,530
This is fine.

1191
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,190
You can also move to survival room from here.

1192
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,670
Please make your preparations for the upcoming mission.

1193
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:27,430
That's a me!

1194
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:28,190
Wait!

1195
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:29,410
Wait, hold on real quick.

1196
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:30,770
Oh, mission types.

1197
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,250
The survival capture and survival intrusion.

1198
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:40,470
You will not know which type of mission you will be facing until the mission starts.

1199
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,410
Oh, okay, so you don't get to...

1200
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:44,590
I'll give you a brief overview of the survival capture mission type.

1201
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,310
I just want to fix my...

1202
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,690
Please, my window is all messed up.

1203
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,110
I just want to fix it.

1204
01:18:54,770 --> 01:19:00,190
Survival capture is a mission type where you must work to secure assets and survive until the mission is over.

1205
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:06,350
At the start of each phase, special Kedotan target items will appear throughout the phase.

1206
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:07,830
Press X to retrieve a...

1207
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:08,090
Wait.

1208
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:08,730
Oh, okay.

1209
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,990
I was like, wait, my controller doesn't have X.

1210
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:11,610
I'm stupid.

1211
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:13,350
It's...

1212
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,270
It dies.

1213
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,610
X to retrieve a Kedotan.

1214
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,250
you come across once each phase has ended.

1215
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:21,030
Any players holding a Keto town will complete the phase.

1216
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:22,510
Oh.

1217
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:25,510
Now to explain about the survival intrusion mission type.

1218
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:25,950
I'm dumb.

1219
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,090
I didn't read the last one.

1220
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:31,950
Survival intrusion is a mission where you must stay within the area known as zones and survive until...

1221
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,610
Because they're just a battle royale.

1222
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:37,850
I'm playing Metal Gear Fortnite right now.

1223
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,700
Start of each phase.

1224
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,420
Special targets known as Gakko appear.

1225
01:19:47,440 --> 01:20:14,120
throughout the field that can be used to activate zones by attacking the gako once each phase has ended any players that have stood inside his own for the required amount of time will complete the phase you can activate naked sense to pinpoint the gako's i think i'm gonna be really bad at this but that's okay wait is there not a way for me to like oh here we go here we go oh my goodness oh oh yeah okay one second guys

1226
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,480
Like the window is so big for me?

1227
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,100
I can't change it?

1228
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,080
Oh.

1229
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:38,720
Okay.

1230
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:40,540
Well?

1231
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,520
It doesn't seem to be lagging anymore.

1232
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,540
Maybe it's okay.

1233
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,140
Maybe.

1234
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:49,780
it's fine.

1235
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,060
Oh.

1236
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,180
Maybe it's fine.

1237
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,280
I think this is all that I...

1238
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,220
I think this is all the same that I had for the other game.

1239
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,640
Like, like actual snake eater.

1240
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,160
So I think... We'll just...

1241
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,320
We'll just see.

1242
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,340
How's the new game mode?

1243
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,840
We just started.

1244
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,440
Like, literally.

1245
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:12,760
What is this?

1246
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,000
This is your all-terrain camouflage suit.

1247
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,460
Ah!

1248
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,460
Otherwise known as AT Camo.

1249
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,060
Okay.

1250
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,020

01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:28,860
Kind of, yeah.

1257
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,180
Your motion indicator is a device that indicates how easy it is to detect you.

1258
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:39,420
In other words, it provides a visual representation of just how much you stand out.

1259
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,100
Oh, okay.

1260
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,740
Oh, okay, interesting.

1261
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:42,820
Okay, so that's not...

1262
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,880
I thought it was my mic, but it's a motion indicator.

1263
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:46,320
Okay.

1264
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,900
Please prepare for battle.

1265
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,600
Hold on, hold on.

1266
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,940
Oh, oh, and so this is how poison

Poison Poison gears Wait, did I just throw it on the ground?

01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,540
Did I throw something on the ground?

1269
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:16,700
I'm sure you've mastered it as part of your training Or B I'd like to go over the topic of naked sense Once more Okay Yeah

1270
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,620
I said that

1271
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,980
Wait, do I have a gun?

1272
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:30,280
Oh

1273
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,300
What is this?

1274
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,460
Camel decoy.

1275
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,600
Piece of shit marker.

1276
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,420
Wait, he's in there.

1277
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:46,980
I know it.

1278
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,720
I know it.

1279
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,660
I can't...

1280
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,660
I felt him in there.

1281
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,840
Wait, is he gonna see me?

1282
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:54,740
And shoot me?

1283
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:55,160
Oh!

1284
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,260
Oh.

1285
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,490
I'm out of ammo.

1286
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,330
Do I not know CQC or?

1287
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:07,750
Oh, I do.

1288
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:08,410
Okay.

1289
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,170
Oh, yeah!

1290
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:14,190
Took his butt down.

1291
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:16,170
Oh, just kidding.

1292
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,150
He's stronger.

1293
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:18,170
He's tougher than it looks.

1294
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:22,590
Wait, what's this one?

1295
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,990
Backpack.

1296
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,670
Item's ammo and other gear you acquire are stored in your backpack.

1297
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,970
I have a backpack?

1298
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,110
Oh my god, there's inventory back.

1299
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,910
Oh my gosh.

1300
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:41,910
Okay.

1301
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,050
Going to school.

1302
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,250
Drop shot.

1303
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:54,610
The drop shot is a technique that can be used to get enemies to drop items when you catch them off guard.

1304
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:57,850
No way I can get people to shake down somehow.

1305
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,110
Oh no I'm just so... Oh my gosh.

1306
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:03,870
That's evil.

1307
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:04,850
Wait.

1308
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,310
I think I hate this.

1309
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,170
I think I'm...

1310
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,770
Wait, get me out of this.

1311
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:10,850
Oh, here we go.

1312
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh, it's X.

1313
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:15,920
My bad.

1314
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:24,470
Um...

1315
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:25,750
Funny and evil.

1316
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:28,290
I think...

1317
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,690
What is... No, this is...

1318
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,030
This one.

1319
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:32,110
I'm grass.

1320
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:35,370
That's... I said that.

1321
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:37,490
Okay, sorry.

1322
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,330
I'm just getting a sense of...

1323
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:41,470
for everything before we...

1324
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,610
Go in, you know?

1325
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:45,910
What are these?

1326
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,290
Oh, open.

1327
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:48,810
Open?

1328
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,170
Oh, I have to hold it.

1329
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:55,590
Oh, okay, and it takes like a second to do it.

1330
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:57,310
Oh, okay.

1331
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,610
Interesting, okay.

1332
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:04,910
Supply boxes contain random supplies such as weapons, ammo, and food.

1333
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:08,710
Hold X, okay.

1334
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:14,980
Okay.

1335
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,230
How do I get inside?

1336
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:21,470
Oh, here?

1337
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:23,350
Just kidding.

1338
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,170
Oh, okay.

1339
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:32,490
I want to see them.

1340
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,430
Oh, here's the Gakul.

1341
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,090
What?

1342
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:42,210
So then what do I do with the Gakul?

1343
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:45,330
Do I shoot them?

1344
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:49,670
No.

1345
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,530
Fortnite has...

1346
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:52,910
Fortnite.

1347
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,630
has changed.

1348
01:26:56,010 --> 01:27:01,090
Me using like this big old gun little gawko right in front of me.

1349
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:02,390
Okay.

1350
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:04,170
I'm scared.

1351
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,370
I'm scared, but I guess I'll try.

1352
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:09,950
Look at me.

1353
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,230
I'm just a little ducky.

1354
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:18,490
Wait, so if I start mission, do I create a room or do I start the mission?

1355
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,490
Loud-ass sniper.

1356
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,570
I'm No.

1357
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:34,250
This is so not my type of game.

1358
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:38,250
But, well, we will be fine maybe.

1359
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:41,750
Create room is probably for parties.

1360
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,570
I want to create a room then maybe so that we can all...

1361
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,270
So you guys can get in instead, you know?

1362
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,690
So, could I have fun?

1363
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,870
Yeah, we're just here to have fun, so whatever.

1364
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,130
I'll create a room.

1365
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:57,670
See what happens.

1366
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:08,170
mission after forming a team with another member take on the mission with pre-selected members so i guess this is friends like it's

1367
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,840
a lot more than i thought it was gonna be i know

1368
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:32,360
hello what's the black box it's different they did say it's something about

1369
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,060
oh whoa this one's good

1370
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,960
oh that's a lot of I thought somebody joined.

1371
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,240
Is there a room ID?

1372
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:58,540
Oh!

1373
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,380
I think I have to...

1374
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:01,640
Wait.

1375
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,680
But is it just gonna be...

1376
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,480
I thought we were playing with a bunch of people.

1377
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,640
I'm so confused.

1378
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,180
Should I show the room ID then or...

1379
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,520
Do custom.

1380
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:19,720
You chose duo.

1381
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:20,320
Okay, okay.

1382
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:21,860
So we'll...

1383
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:24,240
Well, that's why I thought custom was friends only.

1384
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,420
Obviously that's not... that wouldn't be good for you.

1385
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,000
So create room, custom.

1386
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,350
Let's see.

1387
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:41,620
Oh!

1388
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:42,600
Ow!

1389
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:42,860
Ow!

1390
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:43,240
Ow!

1391
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,280
Okay.

1392
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:46,340

01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,660
Are you guys ready?

1394
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,880
There we go.

1395
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:57,240
Okie dokie.

1396
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,240
Ready?

1397
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:00,240
Ready?

1398
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,100
Alright, well obviously...

1399
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,500
What we'll do is, I'm not sure how many games we'll be able to get through today.

1400
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,660
I do have a meeting at 11.

1401
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:18,300
I do have a meeting at 11, so if you play a game, please only join once, unless we're struggling to find people.

1402
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,420
But yeah, just join only once, please.

1403
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:23,140
Thank you.

1404
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,880
Thank you, thank you.

1405
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,580
Alright, here we go.

1406
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,100
Three, a two, a one, and show.

1407
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,940
Oh wow, it's so short.

1408
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,620
We expected a really long code or something.

1409
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:41,880
839471.

1410
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,780
One of your fellow members has joined the...

1411
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,880

1412
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:47,440

Oh!

1414
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:48,160
Oh!

1415
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,370
Wait, I think we need one more?

1416
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:55,410
One of your fellow...

1417
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,050
Oh, there it is!

1418
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:56,810
Yay!

1419
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:59,350
Oh my god!

1420
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:01,450
Cure?

1421
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,570
Who's hurting?

1422
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:03,570
Oh my god!

1423
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:09,880
Hey!

1424
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,540
I mean, this is so stupid.

1425
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:16,740
I'm out.

1426
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:18,260
Hey!

1427
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,360
Go to the mold!

1428
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,920
Hold on, I'm gonna scoot over just a tad.

1429
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,100
There you guys go.

1430
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:29,480
Okay.

1431
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,400
I just hear grunting men.

1432
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,300
Let me get up!

1433
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,400
Oh my gosh!

1434
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:39,700
Ugh!

1435
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,980
They're throwing grenades and everything!

1436
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,500
Oh my gosh, it's a poison grenade.

1437
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,000
Oh!

1438
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,280
I'm gonna cure.

1439
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:51,700
I'm treating my injury.

1440
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:52,080
Stop!

1441
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,140
I'm treating my injury!

1442
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,740
What's going on?

1443
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:58,200
Stop!

1444
01:31:58,540 --> 01:31:59,720
Let me treat my injury!

1445
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,300
Oh my god!

1446
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,240
Stop it!

1447
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,460
Oh, wait, I'm lost.

1448
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,180
Stop it!

1449
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:18,650
How do I start the game?

1450
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:19,130
game.

1451
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:21,910
Oh, battle preparation is complete.

1452
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:25,310
Everybody, ready up.

1453
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:28,090
We can't start the game until you're ready up.

1454
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,050
It's a literal war zone.

1455
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:35,710
Ready up, everybody.

1456
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:36,370
Ready up.

1457
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,540
Get off of me.

1458
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,220
Diamond Wisp training going well.

1459
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,140
Nobody's respecting me and my authority.

1460
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:52,250
Wait, is that rare?

1461
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:54,950
It's so...

1462
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,290
Wait, I want to see!

1463
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:57,210
I want to see!

1464
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,790
Stop, stop, stop!

1465
01:32:58,930 --> 01:32:59,530
I want to see!

1466
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:02,010
Wow.

1467
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:03,790
Wow.

1468
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:05,350
Wow.

1469
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:06,630
Wow.

1470
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:10,670
This is not Diamond Dog behavior.

1471
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:17,630
Take that.

1472
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:19,790
Wow.

1473
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:24,430
Uh, one more person needs to ready up.

1474
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:25,130
CC!

1475
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:26,190
You need to ready up!

1476
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,140
He's already up.

1477
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,760
Oh I think I'm about dead.

1478
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,720
Stop it!

1479
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,100
I'm gonna turn in the bark.

1480
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,820
Nobody will see me here.

1481
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,260
Let's die!

1482
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,440
Okay here we go.

1483
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,200
So crazy.

1484
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:56,760
I'm scared.

1485
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:58,380
I'm scared.

1486
01:33:59,160 --> 01:33:59,520
Whoa!

1487
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,020
Is this the location?

1488
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,360
Where are we?

1489
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,760
We're not in the jungles?

1490
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,740
Code mine!

1491
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:16,760
All right.

1492
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,140
Where are leaves?

1493
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:27,980
Whoa!

1494
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,040
It's Silent Hill!

1495
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:35,880
It's Silent Hill!

1496
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:37,360
Wait, what are we doing?

1497
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,300
Wait, Code Man, I'm scared.

1498
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,700
Oh, we gotta find some Gakos.

1499
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:43,600
Oh, this is the one where we find the...

1500
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,800
Oh, there's a Gakos right near us.

1501
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:48,880
Oh.

1502
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,100
I'm scared.

1503
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,640
What's that mean?

1504
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:56,880
What's that mean?

1505
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,040
It's...

1506
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,080
It's actually a Silent Hill up in here.

1507
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,020
Oh, what's this?

1508
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:08,960
I'm gonna pick it up.

1509
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,560
I got a gun, okay.

1510
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,680
Oh, wait.

1511
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:19,920
Does that mean somebody's in there?

1512
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,060
There's no Gokko over...

1513
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,200
Oh, there is a Gokko over here.

1514
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:28,460
Okay.

1515
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,460
There's the enemy around here?

1516
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,320
Two minutes remaining.

1517
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,160
What do we do?

1518
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:38,960
I'm scared.

1519
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,500
I guess we could go in here.

1520
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:43,580
Where is Agako?

1521
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,240
Oh, he's right here!

1522
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,420
Oh, I'm silly.

1523
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,900
Um, what do I do with him?

1524
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,840
How do I switch back to my...

1525
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:55,980
Wait.

1526
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,140
How do I...

1527
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,360
Oh, wait, uh, wait, wait.

1528
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,780
I don't want to use my back.

1529
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:03,620
How do I...

1530
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:04,740
I don't want to shoot it.

1531
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:05,620
It's right here.

1532
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,200
How do I activate it?

1533
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:08,500
Knife, doko?

1534
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:09,540
Oh, there it is.

1535
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:09,800
Okay.

1536
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:10,860
Okay.

1537
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:11,520
All

1538
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,650
right.

1539
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,590
We're good.

1540
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,010
We're good.

1541
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:41,670
I've secured the zone Silent fortnight solid craziness I'm gonna lay here And become a rock One minute remaining Good work Thank you I see somebody I see somebody I'm scared

1542
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:54,310
He kicked me Oh Shoot him in the crotch Oh.

1543
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,030
Enemy eliminated.

1544
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:05,330
30 seconds remaining.

1545
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:06,930
How do I reload again?

1546
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:07,890
Can I get some ammo?

1547
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,890
Oh, uh, how do I...

1548
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:10,610
How do I do that?

1549
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:16,820
How do I reload?

1550
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,900
I have to keep an eye on the remaining time.

1551
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,420
Um...

1552
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:27,040
Is it X?

1553
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,480
It is X.

1554
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:29,400
You're right.

1555
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,140
Good work.

1556
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:31,680
Three!

1557
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,600
Two!

1558
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,640
One!

1559
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:34,740
Ah!

1560
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,100
Phase complete.

1561
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,600
Zone status confirmed.

1562
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:44,820
Phase two.

1563
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,200
Phase two.

1564
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,860
Oh, there's one right here.

1565
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:51,580
Easy.

1566
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:55,880
But we gotta be careful.

1567
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,940
We're in plain sight.

1568
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,240
Code man, we're in plain sight!

1569
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:03,020
Oh!

1570
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:03,480
Oh!

1571
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:03,940
Oh!

1572
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:04,620
Oh!

1573
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,460
kill if I see anybody.

1574
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:08,960
I'm ready to kill.

1575
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,820
So are you, apparently.

1576
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,460
You're ready to kill.

1577
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,140
She's a killer.

1578
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:25,640
I'm ready to kill.

1579
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,260
Oh, wait.

1580
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,040
There's one...

1581
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,500
Wait, could we just go back to the one that we did before?

1582
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,420
We're doing so well.

1583
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,840
Let's go.

1584
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:40,500
Go!

1585
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,000
Get in his butt!

1586
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:53,920
I get in his butt!

1587
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,010
Oh gosh!

1588
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:02,750
I'm scared!

1589
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:06,230
I'm scared!

1590
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:07,690
I have to become tree black.

1591
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:10,550
Where'd that guy come from?

1592
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:21,580
Wait, I left my mark here.

1593
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,500
It's kind of crazy.

1594
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,240
Where'd

1595
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:33,470
that gas come from?

1596
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:34,910
Am I crazy?

1597
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:37,090
I'm here.

1598
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:38,490
We're confirming.

1599
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:43,250
Yeah.

1600
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:47,910
Just a tree bark on this rock.

1601
01:39:50,230 --> 01:39:50,910
Wait, what's happening?

1602
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:53,190
Who shooting at you?

1603
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,290
I'll kill them.

1604
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:11,290
How could you kill them?

I'm sorry.

1616
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:22,210
It's all my fault.

1617
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:23,950
Wait, there's only a couple people left.

1618
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:27,150
I guess that's how the game goes, huh?

1619
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:31,210
Oh yeah.

1620
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:34,930
You use your naked sense rat sign.

1621
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:36,670
Yeah.

1622
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:39,250
Oh, that's your friend.

1623
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,750
Did you both eat at the same- Oh my god!

1624
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:49,470
Oh my god!

1625
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:52,530
This is insane!

1626
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:56,990
Kill him, kill him!

1627
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:01,610
I don't know what the exclamation point means.

1628
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:07,210
Oh, good job.

1629
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:08,490
Oh, good job.

1630
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:15,590
Yeah, kick his butt!

1631
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:21,330
Sick fight.

1632
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,830
You, Brie, you're the one who killed me.

1633
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,450
Why would you do that?

1634
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,430
Why would you do that?

1635
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:36,550
Why?

1636
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,730
Why do...

1637
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,530
Why would you do that?

1638
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:41,810
Answer me right now.

1639
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,170
Give me a sign, Brie.

1640
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:47,290
Give me a sign.

1641
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,250
Is that the sign?

1642
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:53,350

1643
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:53,970

1644
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:54,550
Doggiza.

1645
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:57,370
Baby.

1646
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:03,670
One minute remaining.

1647
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:04,710
Uh-oh.

1648
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:06,490
Uh-oh, Anec.

1649
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:10,740
Oh my gosh.

1650
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,240
What's going on here?

1651
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:25,270
T-bag apologies.

1652
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:29,990
Oh no, oh no!

1653
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:36,350
Wait!

1654
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:38,830
Oh, it's Zone of the Enders.

1655
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:40,430
How do you get those?

1656
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,250
I want one.

1657
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:45,950
Oh my gosh, the music is so dramatic.

1658
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:49,510
You better win because you killed me.

1659
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:53,650
You better win because you killed me!

1660
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,210
Phase complete.

1661
01:43:59,250 --> 01:43:59,650
Oh!

1662
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:05,650
Um...

1663
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:06,830
This is the final phase.

1664
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:08,050
Is he okay?

1665
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,320
Just the two of them.

1666
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:20,840
Wait, he made it.

1667
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:24,500
Nice, wow, that was fast.

1668
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,720
Wait, this is the only one, isn't it?

1669
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,280
Now it's just like a...

1670
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,120
Wait, that's the Shagohad!

1671
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,160

1672
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:34,580
You could have...

1673
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,040
Is it?

1674
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,500
You could have naked fight on top of it.

1675
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:39,420
On top of it.

1676
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:41,460
Yeah, look at him.

1677
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,260

1682
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,140
Wait, I actually really love this.

1683
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,320
You could just hide and be a little baby and like never show your face in here.

1684
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,540
Two minutes remaining.

1690
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:53,210

One minute remaining.

1695
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,980
I've yet to play a Metal Gear game but this intrigues me.

1696
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,160
Oh!

1697

01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:28,590
Does he know?

1703
01:46:29,010 --> 01:46:29,870
I can't tell.

1704
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:30,210
Oh.

1705
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:33,310

01:46:57,650 --> 01:47:00,150

Bright, you won!

1718
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,940
You did it after you killed him.

1719
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,980
It is time to announce the top performing team.

1720
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,160
Oh, the music.

1721
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:24,800

01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,580
We got fourth!

1727
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,880
Wait, but we didn't get fifth.

1728
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,380
Actually, fourth is a spooky number.

1729
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,900
We did a good job, code man.

1730

This is so fun.

1747
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,920
How do I emote though?

1748
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:00,100
I want to emote.

1749
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:01,820
How do I...

1750
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:02,000

Uru?

1757
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:22,510
Oh, wait.

1758
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:23,210
It's not Uru.

1759
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:23,530
Sorry.

01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:23,770

01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:43,230
What?

1817
01:53:44,010 --> 01:53:44,130
Wait.

1818
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:48,840
Wait.

1819
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,880
It's even...

1820
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:51,520
Josh Keaton?

1821
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:52,740
Oh.

1822
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,840
I know your eyes a lot.

1823
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:57,960
Wow.

1824
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,360
Maybe it's not.

1825
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:00,680
I can't tell.

1826
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,080
Look at the...

1827
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:05,380
How do you display the things?

1828
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,480
I want one so bad.

1829
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,480
My head is like up in there.

1830
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:11,980
Wow.

1831
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,240
Wow.

1832
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,960
Look at that one!

1833
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:17,560
You got so many.

1834
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,920
Don't forget to ready up, you guys.

1835
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:22,740
We...

1836
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:24,720
Lambress!

1837
01:54:33,710 --> 01:54:34,270
Wow.

1838
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:37,710
It's like hurting cats.

1839
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:45,700
Oh my gosh, these maps are so cool.

1840
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:46,860
Survival intrusion.

1841
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,400
Everybody in an awesome line.

1842
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,840
Ryan, let's go, baby.

1843
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:57,540
Let's go.

1844
01:54:58,800 --> 01:54:59,940
How many maps are there?

1845
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:00,760
I have no idea.

1846
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:02,580
The mission is about to begin.

1847
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,720
If you are not within the specified...

1848
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,640
Oh, it says this one again.

1849
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,860
If you leave the phase, you will be removed from the mission.

1850
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:08,920
Phase one.

1851
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:11,660
Wait, there's...

1852
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:13,060
I didn't get a single Gaka.

1853
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:15,840
Okay.

1854
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:16,680
Wait, maybe?

1855
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:26,920
The enemy's close.

1856
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:27,980
They are?

1857
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,040
Scary!

1858
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,060
Wait, what is this?

1859
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:30,960
Medkit.

1860
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,580
Wait, I need a weapon now.

1861
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,100
Where'd you go, my friend?

1862
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:35,820
Oh, there you are.

1863
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:39,300
Oh, there's a big gun, big gun.

1864
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,340
Did you get your gun?

1865
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,460
Did you get one already?

1866
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,940
I'll take this one.

1867
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:47,560
Pick up.

1868
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,560
Oh, I can't pick it up.

1869
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:49,380
Why can't I pick it up?

1870
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:50,220
Why won't I let me?

1871
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,080
I don't want to let me grab it.

1872
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:53,220
Why not?

1873
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:58,230
Why?

1874
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:00,930
Why?

1875
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,050
Why won't I let me grab it?

1876
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:04,210
Yeah!

1877
01:56:06,370 --> 01:56:06,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1878
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:08,630
Two minutes remaining.

1879
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:11,210
Inventory.

1880
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:15,950
I shouldn't... Unless this recover life took up my entire inventory, I don't think so.

1881
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:17,510
I'll follow you.

1882
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:22,990
I'm a rook.

1883
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:32,620
I feel like the hiding mechanic is not really like... I guess if you were like running around and didn't notice...

1884
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:34,350
Check my equipment.

1885
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:36,730
See?

1886
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:38,870
Look, my backpack is completely full.

1887
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:43,070
Friend, don't go.

1888
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:44,670
Oh, over here.

1889
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,460
Look at me!

1890
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:55,860
What's happening to you?

1891
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:57,600
Who's shooting you?

1892
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:58,980
No!

1893
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,260
I don't have a weapon to help you out!

1894
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,160
Oh my gosh, we're gonna get out.

1895
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:06,640
All because of me.

1896
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,840
We gotta secure this guy.

1897
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:15,960
He got me good.

1898
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:23,390
Maybe I could get this one.

1899
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:25,650
Wait, I see...

1900
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:26,730
Is that a person right there?

1901
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:27,470
Oh.

1902
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:35,260
No, it's a rock.

1903
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,800
They're firing on me too!

1904
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:42,440
Wee!

1905
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,740
Ah, that's a lot!

1906
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:45,420
Hello!

Wee, wee.

1909
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:51,980
The current phase is nearly complete.

1910
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:52,500
Oh!

1911
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:53,680
Oh!

1912
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:54,480
Wait, what's happening?

1913
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,580
Uh, game is glitching a little?

1914
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:00,640
How do I do...

1915
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:03,720
Oh no!

1916
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:08,930
Um...

1917

01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:14,610

I don't have... I didn't have a gun!

1924
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,300
Better let me pick it up for some reason.

1925
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,420
Take my... Take my med kit!

You're still alive.

I wish I could respawn.

1945
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:15,600
Everybody came in and blasted me.

01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,680

02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:08,930

Oh my god!

1990
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:25,670
This is the worst possible situation.

1991
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:28,350
Oh.

1996
02:01:46,870 --> 02:01:47,430
Guys, I'm Brian.

We're all learning the game.

2001
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:52,170
This is all of our first time playing.

2002
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:53,150
Don't worry about it.

2003
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:54,670
You did so good.

2004
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:00,330
Unless we got in here.

2005
02:02:01,370 --> 02:02:02,090
A lot of nymphs.

2006
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:06,090
Like, obviously, I recognize you.

2007
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:06,930
Ocelot.

2008
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:07,190
Wait.

2009
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:08,230
Ocelot.

2010
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:10,010
Undress.

2011
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:10,910
What are you doing?

2012
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:12,630
Ocelot undress.

2013
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:13,990
You're not allowed to use camo.

2014
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:17,970
You were down when...

2015
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:18,850
Thank you.

2016
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:22,470
You were down when phase one ended so you got filtered.

2017
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:30,710
Oh my god.

2018
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:32,550
Oh my god.

2019
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:33,670
Oh my god.

2020
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,580
Two minutes remaining.

2021
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,940
I think maybe I just don't recognize your steam names.

2022
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,360
Where's your body?

2023
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:47,120
Oh, over there.

2024
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:51,200
Look at you.

2025
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:52,620
Doing your thing.

2026
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,060
What do you got?

2027
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:55,140
What'd you get in there?

2028
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:55,660
Whoa!

2029
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,720
See, you need to wait on the item to pick it.

2030
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:02,800
What do you mean by that?

2031
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:05,760
Also, don't say see.

2032
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:06,720
I'm playing the game.

2033
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:07,740
I'm not reading chat.

2034
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:12,740
I don't know why it didn't let me.

2035
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,180
Ah, guys, so you say welcome back.

2036
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,140
Thank you.

2037
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:21,280
If I keep my steam names the same as everything, right?

2038
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:22,360
Here.

2039
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,320
You need to hover over it a little bit?

2040
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:29,120
Is that the case?

2041
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:32,240
I feel like I was on it, but...

2042
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,100
There's a guy right there!

2043
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:36,620
Maybe?

2044
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:37,520
Is that a decoy?

2045
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:41,360
Oh my gosh.

2046
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:43,440
Wait, sometimes the decoys are crazy.

2047
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,780
Are they...

2048
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:47,760
It's a decoy!

2049
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:50,420
Wait, that's kind of crazy!

2050
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:51,880
Oh!

2051
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:54,240
Oh!

2052
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,100
Ray trap.

2053
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,720
Wait, that's such a good trap.

2054
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:01,740
That's so awesome.

2055
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:13,640
This looks wrong.

2056
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:15,040
This is so wrong.

2057
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:18,420
This is disturbing.

2058
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:22,280
My man!

2059
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:27,340
Oh, the poison gas!

2060
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:27,940
Nice.

2061
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:29,400
Uh-oh.

2062
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:30,040
Uh-oh.

2063
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:32,140
Or... Oh, neither of you guys are gonna...

2064
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,020
Oh, nice, nice!

2065
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:35,460
Oh!

2066
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:44,990
Good job!

2067
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,850
Is it just you?

2068
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:53,250
This team outperformed all others during the mission.

2069
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:54,330
Good job!

2070
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:57,670
I congratulate.

2071
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:00,250
Yeah, you did it, yeah.

2072
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:03,030
You're gonna extract him.

2073
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:05,230
It is time to start the mission debriefing.

2074
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:08,350
Look at all of us tying for fours!

2075
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:09,270
Wait!

2076
02:05:09,890 --> 02:05:11,090
That's awesome.

2077
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:16,750
I find that your results this time were neither particularly good or bad.

2078
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:18,750
Thank you.

2079
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,140
It's a lot of fours.

2080
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,160
Yeah, it's so spooky.

2081
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,680
GG, fellow soldier.

2082
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:27,720
It's in you too.

2083
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,240
Ah, thank you!

2084
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:32,940
Yeah.

2085
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,340
You guys were a good team.

2086
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:38,840
One of your fellow members has joined the operation.

2087
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:47,980
Someone put down a Rex or a Ray or somebody.

2088
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,530
I want to see...

2089
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:50,860
Wait, what time is it?

2090
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:51,860
Okay, I have an hour still.

2091
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:53,120
Alright, then I'm gonna leave the room.

2092
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,640
Let's get in another group of, another team.

2093
02:05:58,180 --> 02:05:58,460
Going.

2094
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:01,700
The field has been confirmed.

2095
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,820
Please get ready to deploy.

2096
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:06,220
I love how they always start meeting each other.

2097
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:12,250
Do photo shoot.

2098
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:14,050
All right, I'm gonna make...

2099
02:06:14,050 --> 02:06:15,010
Please get ready to deploy.

2100
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:16,670
I'm gonna show the room code.

2101
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:23,790
Show the room code in a three, a two, a one, and show.

2102
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:27,650
One, nine, zero, six, four, four.

2103
02:06:33,650 --> 02:06:35,110
Nobody wants to play with me.

2104
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:38,630
One of your fellow members has joined the...

2105
02:06:38,630 --> 02:06:40,190
One of your fellow members has joined the...

2106
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:48,710
We have room for one more!

2107
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:51,270
Thank you!

2108
02:06:52,090 --> 02:06:53,730
Love you, Minto Platonically.

2109
02:06:54,970 --> 02:06:56,290
Thank you, Maddox!

2110
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:57,610
Thank you so much for a whole year!

2111
02:06:58,410 --> 02:06:58,810
Thank you!

2112
02:06:59,030 --> 02:07:00,750
Enjoyed being the Ocelot for a bit.

2113
02:07:02,030 --> 02:07:03,370
Thank you for...

2114
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:05,170
Wait, we have another Ocelot!

2115
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,150
Ocelot...

2116
02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:09,870
We have...

2117
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:11,510
We have multiple people!

2118
02:07:11,690 --> 02:07:12,510
We have Shiba!

2119
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:15,570
Oh my gosh, this is the best ever!

2120
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:16,910
This is the...

2121
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:19,850
I should have done better is what she says.

2122
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:24,770
Just stand in there.

2123
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:26,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2124
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:27,570
Let's do this.

2125
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:28,150
I'm sorry.

2126
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:29,730
Wait, you do...

2127
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:35,780
You can be zero!

2128
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:41,990
Wait, this is insane!

2129
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:43,870
Oh my gosh, it's like a...

2130
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:48,170
You know when, like, people cosplay, but, like, they don't have a full group or something?

2131
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:50,570
It feels like that.

2132
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:54,930
Where, like, people are just random cosplayers.

2133
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:57,670
Like, stop teabagging me.

2134
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:04,030
Where it's, like, can you play as Johnny?

2135
02:08:04,130 --> 02:08:05,510
Am I not Johnny right now?

2136
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:11,570
Oh, my God.

2137
02:08:11,670 --> 02:08:12,190
Wait.

2138
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:17,380
I'm so obsessed with this.

2139
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,120
Ouch!

2140
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:20,180
Oh my gosh.

2141
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,900
Alright, let's ready up!

2142
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:24,880
Ready up, everybody!

2143
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:25,680
Ready up!

2144
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,800
Zero's got the moves!

2145
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,260
It's so funny!

2146
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,400
It's so funny!

2147
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:33,640
Kubei!

2148
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,480
We need you to ready up, please.

2149
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:44,310
Let's...

2150
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:45,730
Everybody's just kind of chilling.

2151
02:08:46,030 --> 02:08:46,710
It's so good.

2152
02:08:50,370 --> 02:08:55,890
If you play as a character that is like a costume character, don't camouflage.

2153
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:58,050
It'll be against the rules.

2154
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:01,630
Let's go!

2155
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:03,450
Oh.

2156
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:10,330
Oh, this map again.

2157
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:19,680
This is kind of like Portable Ops Online back in the day because you could play as a lot of these characters in the eyes.

2158
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:22,100
Oh my god!

2159
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:26,660
Even and Zero got paired up together.

2160
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:34,020
Alright, Vice.

2161
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:35,060
Let's go.

2162
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,320
We got this.

2163
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:46,860
Wait, that's a mine right there.

2164
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:48,220
Oh my gosh.

2165
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:49,360
Wait, they're everywhere!

2166
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,300
Um, I'll take this.

2167
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,460
I got a ration.

2168
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,680
I should probably like eat the things I get, huh?

2169
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,180
We should probably go out this way, maybe?

2170
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,200
Oh!

2171
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:03,960
Oh!

2172
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:05,960
Was that you?

2173
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:06,940
Uh-oh.

2174
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,780
That wasn't you, was it?

2175
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:10,380
Was that you?

2176
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:11,480
Was that you?

2177
02:10:12,140 --> 02:10:13,120
Was that you?

2178
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,940
Oh, that wasn't you.

2179
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:28,820
I hope you had fun playing Alien Isolation.

2180
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:30,360
That game is so scary.

2181
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:34,900
Hello, hello!

2182
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:35,740
Welcome!

2183
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:36,820
Where's, uh, this?

2184
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:37,880
Oh, what's that?

2185
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:38,760
Wait, what is this?

2186
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:39,400
Pick up item?

2187
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:41,220
What is that?

2188
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,440
Oh, I got a box!

2189
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:47,740
Oh my gosh, I got a box!

2190
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:48,900
Wait, there's a gun here.

2191
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:50,560
I got a gun.

2192
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:51,820
I got things.

2193
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:52,540
I got things!

2194
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:53,260
Let's go!

2195
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:54,440
I got a box!

2196
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:02,280
Thank you guys so much for the- I'm missing all of the donors, or not the gift and memberships, but thank you guys.

2197
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:04,500
Thank you.

2198
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:10,940
Oh, I can't scan the area while this is on.

2199
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:16,540
Are you going this way?

2200
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:17,360
You're so brave.

2201
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:20,400
Why are you doing that?

2202
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:21,720
Why are you doing that?

2203
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,740
You're going to go this way?

2204
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,580
Alright, I'll go with you.

2205
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:31,480
I guess we do got to get out of here, huh?

2206
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:42,900
So this one is the Gakul, and again, yeah.

2207
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:46,080
One minute remaining.

2208
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:46,520
Whoa!

2209
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:51,860
Oh, see, it'll let me pick up this one!

2210
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:56,020
I don't... I don't understand why it wouldn't let me pick up the other one before.

2211
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:57,160
Yeah, eat that.

2212
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:01,040
I'll eat one too.

2213
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,240
Wait, how do I eat it?

2214
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:10,660
Nice.

2215
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:16,530
30 seconds remaining.

2216
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:18,310
Yeah, open that.

2217
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:19,510
Wait, we gotta find a Gokko.

2218
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:21,310
Wait.

2219
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:23,810
Wait, Vice, we gotta go find the Gaku!

2220
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:24,750
We're in trouble!

2221
02:12:25,150 --> 02:12:27,090
The current phase is nearly complete.

2222
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:29,450
You must quickly make your way to the zone.

2223
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:30,330
Uh-oh.

2224
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:31,350
Where?

2225
02:12:31,690 --> 02:12:32,410
Watch out.

2226
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:33,770
There's more here.

2227
02:12:35,470 --> 02:12:36,590
Wait, there's one over here!

2228
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:38,770
Maybe?

2229
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:39,470
Uh-oh.

2230
02:12:39,570 --> 02:12:40,010
Oh, no.

2231
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:40,850
Wait, we're gonna lose!

2232
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:46,280
It's gonna explode on me.

2233
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:47,080
Phase complete.

2234
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,160
Well today.

2235
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:50,900
Please wait until the exercise is over.

2236
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,840
I got too comfy.

2237
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:55,900
No!

2238
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:00,180
Oh my god, I shut up the flowers.

2239
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:04,080

2244
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:26,280

02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:28,820

Did I just hear Eva go?

2253
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:11,060
It is zipped down.

2254
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:12,840
Let's go.

2255
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:16,880

I think your buddy's in here.

2264
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:24,610
Yeah, your buddy's in here.

2265
02:15:25,330 --> 02:15:26,990
30 seconds remaining.

2266
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:41,600
What is that?

2267
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:44,540

02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:02,060
I think that's Eva.

2272
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:03,040
No?

2273
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:04,040
Wait, why did...

2274
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:05,600
Why did you have such a cute voice then?

2275
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:07,100
Phase 3.

2276
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:12,560
Oh my gosh, it's just, it's just warm.

2277
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:19,880
Seeing Zero do the CQ.

2278
02:16:20,060 --> 02:16:21,040
Look at his hands.

2279
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,740
Is that Zero's voice?

2280
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:27,920
Wait a second.

2281
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:29,120
Do you guys hear that?

2282
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:31,240
What?

2283
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,380
Was there a mistake?

2284
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,480
I want to, I want to hear.

2285
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:55,460
Whoa!

2286
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,900
Someone CQC him so I can hear his voice.

2287
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:03,040
Oh, my vision.

2288
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:08,960
You got this?

2289
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:11,580
Be aggressive, be aggressive?

2290
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:12,760
What does that do?

2291
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:19,000
You hear that right?

2292
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:23,920
I think Zero has a sexy voice.

2293
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:33,630
Yeah!

2294
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:41,340
Can you dive again, Mark?

2295
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:53,740
Why is your voice...

2296
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:54,500
Why is he so sexy?

2297
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,380
Die for me, Mark.

2298
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:59,280
Die for me.

2299
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:02,700
What is...

2300
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:03,600
Oh, whoop.

2301
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:05,080
Are they coming in?

2302
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:07,060
Is this the last phase?

2303
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:08,020
How many phases are there?

2304
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:18,970
Yeah, Mark is like, I'm not listening to you, VTuber.

2305
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:20,550
I'm playing this game and I'm gonna win.

2306
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:22,270
Oh my god!

2307
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:26,510
They're

2308
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:32,060
like so insane.

2309
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,000
Oh my gosh.

2310
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:37,640
Mark doesn't even watch the streams.

2311
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:39,320
Somehow he just guessed the code.

2312
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:43,280
He's just like insane.

2313
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:47,480
What are you doing?

2314
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:51,340
He's so locked in.

2315
02:18:58,940 --> 02:18:59,980
No way.

2316
02:19:06,490 --> 02:19:08,150
I think he still wins though, right?

2317
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:10,510
Oh no, this is the final phase.

2318
02:19:10,630 --> 02:19:11,790
Oh my gosh, this is so awkward.

2319
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:17,190
Run away, my girlfriend?

2320
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:18,410
Girlfriend Zero?

2321
02:19:25,570 --> 02:19:27,370
He's here for the love of the game.

2322
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:31,590
It's just these two, right?

2323
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:34,690
Oh my god.

2324
02:19:37,490 --> 02:19:38,710
He killed tax fraud!

2325
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:42,730
How many people are left?

2326
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:43,530
Oh, wow.

2327
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:44,670
Wait, Q-Bay, where?

2328
02:19:45,430 --> 02:19:45,870
Wait.

2329
02:19:46,510 --> 02:19:48,050
How are we in the final phase, but there's...

2330
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:49,170
still so many people.

2331
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:51,450
What?

2332
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,610
Is there a glitch?

2333
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:54,010
I thought it was supposed to... Wait.

2334
02:19:54,850 --> 02:19:54,970
Eh?

2335
02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:59,310
How are there so many people still?

2336
02:20:00,990 --> 02:20:02,050
There were other Gakko.

2337
02:20:02,350 --> 02:20:03,610
I guess that's fair.

2338
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:07,110
Ooh.

2339
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,400
Two minutes remaining.

2340
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:19,140
I'm still having fun watching, though.

2341
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:22,020
I'm like learning more the game by watching everybody else.

2342
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:26,200
Tax fraud!

2343
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:33,190
Oh, uh-oh.

2344
02:20:35,410 --> 02:20:36,430
Did you say that?

2345
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:38,710
Sparky, did you say that?

2346
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:39,530
Oh, they're gone.

2347
02:20:40,210 --> 02:20:41,510
Sparky, Sparky, be careful.

2348
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,310
Oh!

2349
02:20:43,230 --> 02:20:45,330
Oh, the guy, like, right next to you.

2350
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:47,310
What about the guy right there?

2351
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:49,810
Who's pretending to be dead.

2352
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:54,350
He's like, I can pretend to be a decoy.

2353
02:20:55,330 --> 02:20:56,450
CQC him!

2354
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:01,400
This is gonna be insane.

2355
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:03,080
There's so many people.

2356
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:03,520
Oh.

2357
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:06,440
Hexrod, did I just hear your stomach?

2358
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,280
Oh, it's because you died.

2359
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:16,070
The wisps have seized the means of streaming.

2360
02:21:17,830 --> 02:21:18,850
Hugo, welcome!

2361
02:21:19,310 --> 02:21:20,410
Oh, hello, I should have.

2362
02:21:22,210 --> 02:21:23,370
I'm hungry too.

2363
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,550
That's why I'm eating.

2364
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:38,240
It's absolute insanity!

2365
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:38,900
It's insane!

2366
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:41,800
Oh my god.

2367
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:42,280
Oh my god.

2368
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:43,240
Kick him while he's down.

2369
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:44,560
Oh, kick him while he's down.

2370
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:46,020
Kick them both while they're down.

2371
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:47,420
Oh my god!

2372
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:50,420
Is anyone on a team anymore?

2373
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:53,120
Oh my god!

2374
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:55,200
Oh my god!

2375
02:21:57,930 --> 02:21:59,350
Stealth game, by the way.

2376
02:21:59,470 --> 02:22:00,670
Not this version.

2377
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:03,230
Foxhunt isn't meant to be stealth.

2378
02:22:06,750 --> 02:22:07,230
Grenade!

2379
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:07,790
Grenade!

2380
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:08,770
Everybody dies!

2381
02:22:08,950 --> 02:22:09,490
Everybody dies!

2382
02:22:11,850 --> 02:22:13,310
Mark, you got this?

2383
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:16,430
Oh, I don't think Mark got this.

2384
02:22:20,850 --> 02:22:23,090
Her voice is so cute.

2385
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:28,710
Cute, saluting each other.

2386
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:30,790
Wow, good job.

2387
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:39,460
Oh, you can just keep spamming.

2388
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:40,460
Congrats, that's funny.

2389
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:42,600
It is time to start the mission debriefing.

2390
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:48,040
Um, well, fourth?

2391
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:51,000
Um, well, there were three?

2392
02:22:51,620 --> 02:22:53,720
It was, uh, tied for fourth.

2393
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:56,220
I did fairly well.

2394
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:58,440
See, she likes me.

2395
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:00,680
What is this mode?

2396
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:02,220
This is the new Fox Hunt mode.

2397
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:03,960
It just was released an hour ago.

2398
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:08,080
4-4-4, baby.

2399
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:13,320
Yay!

2400
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:14,220
Yay!

2401
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:19,200
One of your fellow members has joined the operation.

2402
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:21,820
I should have done better.

2403
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:24,400
Why do you have a cute voice?

2404
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:25,520
Why?

2405
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:26,460
How do you?

2406
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:26,760
How?

2407
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:27,300
How?

2408
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:28,260
How?

2409
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:28,820
Tell me.

2410
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,320
Tell me now, Mark.

2411
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,000
Tell me now.

2412
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:32,880
How?

2413
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:37,540
I should have done better.

2414
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:41,600
Good luck out there.

2415
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:42,760
Good luck out there.

2416
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:44,540
Good luck out there.

2417
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:44,720
I'm sorry.

2418
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:02,340
I'm sorry.

2419
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:06,420
Good look out there.

2420
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:07,640
Good luck out there.

2421
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:08,620
Good luck out there.

2422
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:10,340
Thank you guys.

2423
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:16,300
It's so goofy.

2424
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:20,320
It's actually just so stinking goofy!

2425
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:22,440
Good game y'all.

2426
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:23,880
It's a hell of a fun time.

2427
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:25,680
Thanks for hosting me, dog.

2428
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:26,480
Yeah!

2429
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:28,500
What an exit.

2430
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:29,800
It was so funny.

2431
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:31,040
Please get ready to deploy.

2432
02:24:32,300 --> 02:24:33,520
Alright, another custom.

2433
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:35,840
Better than Titanic.

2434
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:44,320
It was like the best response that I could have asked for when I was interrogating him.

2435
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:46,800
Mark here.

2436
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:47,520
Mark!

2437
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:50,760
Okay, you can change your voice in your survival room.

2438
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:52,580
I can?

2439
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:53,140
Wait.

2440
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:56,880
mission settings?

2441
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:58,140
Oh, look at this!

2442
02:24:58,240 --> 02:24:58,360
Wait!

2443
02:24:58,720 --> 02:24:59,040
Ghost!

2444
02:25:00,020 --> 02:25:03,380
We need to go to the ghost... Oh, wait, we did go to Ghost Garrison.

2445
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:05,120
Oh, wow.

2446
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,860
Wait, we haven't gone to Secret Garden.

2447
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:07,780
Let's do that one.

2448
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:09,540
I'm guessing...

2449
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:13,140
Let's do... I'll set it as a capture.

2450
02:25:18,570 --> 02:25:19,630
Hugo, thank you!

2451
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:20,870
Welcome back.

2452
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:22,390
It was an honor serving with you, Minky.

2453
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:24,230
Thank you.

2454
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:25,810
Thank you so much.

2455
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:27,610
Good luck out there, TTT.

2456
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:32,350
I was an Eva, I have no idea why I had a manly voice.

2457
02:25:32,470 --> 02:25:33,250
No, apparently...

2458
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:34,510
Kojima is gone.

2459
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:36,390
Apparently you have to change it.

2460
02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:37,730
Please get ready to deploy.

2461
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:40,130
But...

2462
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:41,830
Oh, it might go to survival room.

2463
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:44,350
Please complete any necessary customizations.

2464
02:25:44,570 --> 02:25:45,550
Oh, here!

2465
02:25:46,670 --> 02:25:47,090
Oh!

2466
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:48,430
Oh!

2467
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:52,830
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2468
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:53,990
Oh my god.

2469
02:25:54,430 --> 02:25:55,270
I have none.

2470
02:25:55,970 --> 02:25:57,770
But look how many there are!

2471
02:26:00,910 --> 02:26:02,910
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

2472
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:04,690
Radio presets.

2473
02:26:07,270 --> 02:26:08,210
Oh, look how many!

2474
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:11,250
Wait.

2475
02:26:12,650 --> 02:26:13,090
Copy that.

2476
02:26:13,270 --> 02:26:14,130
Let's see if I...

2477
02:26:14,130 --> 02:26:14,470
Whoa!

2478
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:24,900
Oh, wow!

2479
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:25,740
Voice settings.

2480
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:26,700
Okay, I see it too.

2481
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:31,380
Oh my gosh!

2482
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:35,800
There's so much to unlock!

2483
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:36,240
Look!

2484
02:26:40,190 --> 02:26:41,150

2486
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:47,520
I could be Robin!

2487
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:55,860
Is it Robin waiting?

2488
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:57,940
It kind of sounds like him.

2489
02:26:58,600 --> 02:26:59,660
I can't tell actually.

2490
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,860

Rocky!

2547
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:25,100
Thank you so much for the Rita rags!

2548
02:31:25,220 --> 02:31:26,200
Hello, everybody.

2549
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:29,480
Hi!

2550
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:32,280
We're playing Metal Gear, Fox Hunt.

2551
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:34,900
Wow.

2552
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:37,560
Wait, how do I get out of this?

2553
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:39,940
Wait, I can't get out of it.

2554
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:41,360
Oh wait, I can't...

2555
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:41,780
Oh, there we go.

2556
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:43,140
What is that one?

2557
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:46,660
The little cowering one is so cute.

2558
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:47,660
Oh, this one.

2559
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:52,880
Ah, kawaii!

2560
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:59,480
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

2561
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:01,200
Dwargo, thank you so much for the five gifted!

2562
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:03,360
Rest in glitch phase, thank you for the gifted!

2563
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:05,000
What was I gonna do?

2564
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:09,060
I give this...

2565
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:12,500
Oh, come on, I didn't get to do my emo.

2566
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:14,280
And J-Go's, thank you so much.

2567
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:16,260
Now I will thank you.

2568
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:22,480
Do my eyes deceive me or am I paired with us?

2569
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:25,320
We, Ashen, we, Ashen, we're paired.

2570
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,440
We're buddies and you're us a lot.

2571
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:28,260
Yeah!

2572
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:30,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2573
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:32,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2574
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:34,660
Okay, let's start the game.

2575
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:35,680
Ready up, everybody!

2576
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:40,320
Ready up, ready up!

2577
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:42,380
I look forward to fighting by your side.

2578
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:47,380
This is the perfect end of where I get to fight with us a lot.

2579
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:48,300
I'm like...

2580
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:49,760
I'm like...

2581
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:54,460
Wait, this is so cool!

2582
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:55,220
Wait!

2583
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:56,480
Oh!

2584
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:00,540
And this one is the Kedotan one.

2585
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:01,740
We haven't tried this one.

2586
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:05,700
Okay.

2587
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,320
I'm calm, I'm cool, and I'm collected.

2588
02:33:09,320 --> 02:33:13,320
I can't let him show- I can't- I can't let him see how excited I am.

2589
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:18,080
My dream came true.

2590
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:20,260
Mission.

2591
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:21,920
Survival capture.

2592
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:23,820
How do I screenshot?

2593
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:27,940
Okay.

2594
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:32,080
No!

2595
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:35,420
I don't know if I got him in time or not.

2596
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:37,840
The mission is about to begin.

2597
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,000
Wait,

2598
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:46,780
there's a button right here!

2599
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:48,840
Um, I got him.

2600
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:51,060
How many do we need?

2601
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:55,560
Wait, that one is...

2602
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:57,000
That one's special color.

2603
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:08,260
Oh my gosh, I got a cool decal!

2604
02:34:09,140 --> 02:34:10,560
Yeah, I know, I'm scared.

2605
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,000
Did you get a gun yet or anything?

2606
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:23,140
Are you okay?

2607
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:25,040
Oh my god.

2608
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:27,040
Oh, hi.

2609
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:27,840
It's me.

2610
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,020
I'm Leo.

2611
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:31,860
We both have one.

2612
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:32,960
I guess?

2613
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:43,820
Two minutes remaining.

2614
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:45,620
No sign of the enemy.

2615
02:34:46,340 --> 02:34:46,520
Cool.

2616
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:48,120
Wait.

2617
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:52,060
Um, there's a sign of the enemy.

2618
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:54,460
He's like right behind us.

2619
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:10,510
I got somebody!

2620
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,970
I got

2621
02:35:18,850 --> 02:35:23,210
you!

2622
02:35:24,370 --> 02:35:24,950
I got you!

2623
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:25,870
I'll save you!

2624
02:35:26,270 --> 02:35:27,430
I'll save you!

2625
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:28,390
I'll save you!

2626
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:29,230
I'll save you!

2627
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:31,800
Oh my god, wait.

2628
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:33,420
Oh there you are.

2629
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:36,540
You can't leave me!

2630
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:37,580
You can't leave me!

2631
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:38,920
You can't!

2632
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,960
Wait, I have your things!

2633
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:41,360
Wait, I took some of your stuff!

2634
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:44,260
Oh, uh...

2635
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:46,440
Ow!

2636
02:35:46,820 --> 02:35:47,320
Ouchie out!

2637
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:49,100
Yeah, thank you!

2638
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:51,260
Oh, out, Jailch.

2639
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:52,540
I think you hit me.

2640
02:35:58,020 --> 02:35:59,100
Good job, team.

2641
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:00,940
Wait, somebody else over here.

2642
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:06,660
I'm waiting for you.

2643
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,020
Ouch!

2644
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:10,440
Your buddy has been badly and your buddy is confirmed dead.

2645
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:10,900
No!

2646
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:14,350
Ouch!

2647
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:15,430
Oh, I got him.

2648
02:36:19,130 --> 02:36:19,710
Oh, shoot!

2649
02:36:19,910 --> 02:36:20,050
Ouch!

2650
02:36:21,070 --> 02:36:22,110
Wait, wait, hold on!

2651
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:22,670
Hold on!

2652
02:36:25,650 --> 02:36:26,050
Buddy!

2653
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:27,250
Buddy, buddy, buddy.

2654
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,640
Wait, no, I'm gonna...

2655
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:36,940
Wait, no!

2656
02:36:41,950 --> 02:36:42,490
Wait, no!

2657
02:36:42,490 --> 02:36:43,530
Please retrieve your equipment.

2658
02:36:43,950 --> 02:36:44,390
Phase complete.

2659
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:45,730
I guess this is the end.

2660
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:47,590
You fought Braveheart today.

2661
02:36:48,530 --> 02:36:50,610
I was doing so well.

2662
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:54,540
Phase 2.

2663
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:02,130
Well, this is kind of...

2664
02:37:02,130 --> 02:37:03,670
This is kind of freaky.

2665
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:07,290
Seeing paramedic down like that is kind of really scary.

2666
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:11,010
Oh man, is this a...

2667
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:13,010
This seems like a much smaller...

2668
02:37:13,010 --> 02:37:15,030
Oh, smaller map.

2669
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:19,590
Look at you!

2670
02:37:19,790 --> 02:37:20,670
You are a squirrel!

2671
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:23,150
You're a squirrel!

2672
02:37:23,990 --> 02:37:24,730
That's so cute.

2673
02:37:25,930 --> 02:37:26,870
I got two kills!

2674
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,070
I got two kills.

2675
02:37:39,070 --> 02:37:40,030
Is it...

2676
02:37:40,030 --> 02:37:41,430
Shin-chi?

2677
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:43,510
Welcome to- welcome back to membership!

2678
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:44,190
Thank you!

2679
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:45,450
Sorry if I said your name wrong.

2680
02:37:45,770 --> 02:37:47,430
About a pronunciation surprise.

2681
02:37:49,630 --> 02:37:51,770
How many do you need to survive?

2682
02:37:52,190 --> 02:37:53,970
There's one just...

2683
02:37:53,970 --> 02:37:55,590
There's one just chillin' here.

2684
02:38:01,260 --> 02:38:02,240
Are you watching that guy?

2685
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:03,940
That's not your buddy.

2686
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:06,040
Kill him!

2687
02:38:07,380 --> 02:38:08,100
Oh!

2688
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:10,700
Whoa!

2689
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:11,860
Oh!

2690
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:12,260
Oh my god!

2691
02:38:16,280 --> 02:38:17,060
Holy cow!

2692
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:17,640
Scout!

2693
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:20,760
...

2694
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:21,260
...

2695
02:38:27,250 --> 02:38:27,610
...

2696
02:38:28,390 --> 02:38:30,350
Is this shotguns only or something?

2697
02:38:30,410 --> 02:38:30,970
I know, right?

2698
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:33,330
Well, no, I don't think so because...

2699
02:38:34,450 --> 02:38:36,330
There was definitely somebody who...

2700
02:38:37,170 --> 02:38:39,830
Definitely somebody who was shooting faster than I was.

2701
02:38:40,770 --> 02:38:41,570
Oh my gosh.

2702
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:44,810
Astrea, I didn't even see you.

2703
02:38:45,250 --> 02:38:47,630
That was like some really good camera.

2704
02:38:50,730 --> 02:38:51,770
Holy paramedic!

2705
02:38:52,490 --> 02:38:53,750
One minute remaining.

2706
02:38:54,450 --> 02:38:55,790
Oh my gosh, paramedic.

2707
02:38:55,850 --> 02:38:56,330
Are you okay?

2708
02:38:58,610 --> 02:39:00,330
So beat up.

2709
02:39:02,270 --> 02:39:02,430
Oh.

2710
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:07,110
This is a side of paramedic we'll never see again.

2711
02:39:07,970 --> 02:39:09,010
It's kind of insane.

2712
02:39:09,490 --> 02:39:11,850
Lord of men here I flunked out, but Luca Dan is my buddy.

2713
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:12,990
Thanks for playing me, though.

2714
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:13,890
Thank you!

2715
02:39:14,010 --> 02:39:14,910
I thought it was you.

2716
02:39:20,110 --> 02:39:20,910
Thank you.

2717
02:39:22,510 --> 02:39:23,830
30 seconds remaining.

2718
02:39:24,470 --> 02:39:24,930
30 seconds.

2719
02:39:24,970 --> 02:39:25,690
Oh, you got two.

2720
02:39:26,070 --> 02:39:26,610
You got... Oh.

2721
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:27,450
Uh-oh.

2722
02:39:27,730 --> 02:39:27,990
Wait.

2723
02:39:28,330 --> 02:39:29,230
Uh-oh.

2724
02:39:29,790 --> 02:39:30,210
Wait.

2725
02:39:31,210 --> 02:39:32,490
Wait, your buddy's down!

2726
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:38,840
Sorry, I couldn't keep Oslo.

2727
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:39,580
No!

2728
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:41,160
Ash and you were great!

2729
02:39:42,060 --> 02:39:43,480
Thank you for being my buddy.

2730
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:47,080
This is a really small map.

2731
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,500
So it's like very tough.

2732
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:53,560
People are just on top of you.

2733
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:54,540
Phase complete.

2734
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:04,200
Teeny time.

2735
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:09,730
Target's place too.

2736
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:15,280
Oh, you're red on top of it.

2737
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:20,460
Wackwackwackwack.

2738
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:25,580
I don't know what kind of fox we're hunting, but it's got to be good if Big Minky is here observing the fight.

2739
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:27,260
I put up a...

2740
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:27,580
Oh!

2741
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:29,360
Oh my gosh!

2742
02:40:31,060 --> 02:40:34,780
I feel like I put up my own fight as well.

2743
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:37,960
Damn.

2744
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:41,080
You gonna take his stuff?

2745
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:43,400
Wait.

2746
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:43,980
Oh.

2747
02:40:45,100 --> 02:40:46,200
It's just the two of you.

2748
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:48,540
Wait, when did...

2749
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:50,240
When did we lose...

2750
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:51,200
Paramedic?

2751
02:40:58,520 --> 02:40:59,040
Oh.

2752
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:00,640
There's so much stuff here.

2753
02:41:00,740 --> 02:41:01,360
Who died?

2754
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:04,800
Nice.

2755
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:14,640
If they keep adding onto Fox Hunt, it would be really cool.

2756
02:41:15,860 --> 02:41:17,560
I would like to see...

2757
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:20,680
Like, you know, more modes.

2758
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:22,580
It's one-on-one.

2759
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,400
But they both have two.

2760
02:41:33,910 --> 02:41:35,290
Yeah, both can survive, no?

2761
02:41:36,810 --> 02:41:39,190
Um, I guess you would have to kill the other person.

2762
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:41,670
It might go into, like, overtime, you know.

2763
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:44,770
Yeah, new maps and stuff, too.

2764
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:48,150
That looks like a trap, no?

2765
02:41:51,950 --> 02:42:15,730
leaves oh my gosh array don't you want to just go look at it i have hearts coming out of my head right now one minute remaining they're looking for each other yeah they're looking for each other it's tense it's tense

2766
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:34,680
oh Oh my god, wait.

2767
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:40,730
I think Luca just won this.

2768
02:42:41,250 --> 02:42:43,230
I think Luca Dan just won this.

2769
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:47,010
Forget dirty Dan.

2770
02:42:47,230 --> 02:42:48,390
It's Luca Dan.

2771
02:42:50,730 --> 02:42:51,110
Uh-oh.

2772
02:42:51,630 --> 02:42:52,550
Uh-oh.

2773
02:42:52,790 --> 02:42:53,310
Astrea.

2774
02:42:54,030 --> 02:42:54,650
Uh-oh.

2775
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:56,130
Oh.

2776
02:42:56,130 --> 02:42:57,090
Get him, get him, get him.

2777
02:42:57,850 --> 02:42:59,270
Oh, that's just some rocks.

2778
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:06,070
Ah, so close.

2779
02:43:11,170 --> 02:43:11,850
Yeah!

2780
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:14,990
One day I'll see.

2781
02:43:15,810 --> 02:43:18,090
This team outperformed all others during...

2782
02:43:18,090 --> 02:43:19,670
There you are, Florida man!

2783
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:29,780
It is time to start the mission debriefing.

2784
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:30,900
I'm so consistent.

2785
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,400
Was it really phase one?

2786
02:43:36,660 --> 02:43:37,520
Oh, okay.

2787
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:42,460
I meant always four.

2788
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,040
You did fairly well.

2789
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:47,160
She said I did well, everybody.

2790
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:47,900
I did well.

2791
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:53,140
Uh, that first phase in that map was crazy.

2792
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:56,020
Because there's so many people.

2793
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:58,400
And such a small map.

2794
02:43:59,180 --> 02:44:02,140
We, but you know, we got to see all of them, I guess?

2795
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:03,640
Hmm.

2796
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:06,460
One of your fellow members has joined the...

2797
02:44:06,460 --> 02:44:08,720
One of your fellow members has joined the operation.

2798
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:10,080
Her hair looks so silky.

2799
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:11,120
Good luck out there.

2800
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:11,360
Oh.

2801
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:12,200
Good luck out there.

2802
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:12,440
Oh.

2803
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:13,420
Thank you.

2804
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:15,960
Ashen, we did well.

2805
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:16,700
Good job.

2806
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:17,520
Wait, hold on.

2807
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:20,020
Hold on.

2808
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:21,320
Hold on.

2809
02:44:21,320 --> 02:44:22,320
Keep up the fight.

2810
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:23,440
Thank you.

2811
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:24,340
Good luck out there.

2812
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:26,120
I can't do that.

2813
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,640
I'm sorry.

2814
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:29,420
Oh, look at you guys.

2815
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:30,200
You're so cute.

2816
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:37,740
I can't with the kawaii pose.

2817
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:40,480
It's so good.

2818
02:44:40,980 --> 02:44:41,660
Look at it.

2819
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:42,780
Good work.

2820
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:43,660
Let's do this.

2821
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:48,220
It is so cursed.

2822
02:44:48,380 --> 02:44:49,360
I don't think I could...

2823
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:50,640
I don't think I can...

2824
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:52,060
I don't think I can play.

2825
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:55,000
It's so funny watching the emotes.

2826
02:44:59,160 --> 02:44:59,760
Kawaii!

2827
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:01,120
Wait, I wanna dance too.

2828
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:02,620
Let's have a dance party!

2829
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:04,980
Dance party!

2830
02:45:05,820 --> 02:45:06,740
Dance party!

2831
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:08,500
Dance party!

2832
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:10,020
Oh, everybody coming over!

2833
02:45:10,140 --> 02:45:10,880
Dance party!

2834
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:12,720
I'm a dance party!

2835
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:14,360
Dance a party!

2836
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:15,280
Come on, come on!

2837
02:45:15,380 --> 02:45:16,240
Dance party!

2838
02:45:16,940 --> 02:45:17,880
Dance party!

2839
02:45:18,780 --> 02:45:19,720
Dance party!

2840
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:21,320
Dance party!

2841
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:23,080
Dance party!

2842
02:45:23,660 --> 02:45:24,720
Dance party!

2843
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:27,200
Come on, come on!

2844
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:28,000
Dance party!

2845
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:29,640
Dance party!

2846
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:30,280
Dance party!

2847
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:31,220
Dance party!

2848
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,960
Dance party!

2849
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,540
Dance party!

2850
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:40,000
Dance party!

2851
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:44,160
Let's kick some butt!

2852
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:45,700
Let's kick some butt!

2853
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:46,600
Let's do this!

2854
02:45:48,780 --> 02:45:49,700
Thank you.

2855
02:45:49,880 --> 02:45:51,580
Thank you for dancing with me, everyone.

2856
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:53,540
Thanks for playing with me!

2857
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:58,660
My game crashed right when loading back into the lobby.

2858
02:45:58,900 --> 02:45:59,420
Oh no!

2859
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:00,200
Oh, look!

2860
02:46:01,060 --> 02:46:02,260
Everyone's dance party!

2861
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:03,860
Dance party!

2862
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:05,580
Dance party!

2863
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:07,220
Dance party!

2864
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:08,880
Dance party!

2865
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:10,700
Dance party!

2866
02:46:13,100 --> 02:46:14,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2867
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,160
Yeah- That's so good.

2868
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:24,940
Why is like, Ocelot's neck bend like that?

2869
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:26,300
This is so funny.

2870
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:28,500
Wait.

2871
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:30,120
Oh!

2872
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,240
Grenade!

2873
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:35,040
Nice!

2874
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:36,280
Thank you!

2875
02:46:41,410 --> 02:46:41,730
Oh!

2876
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:44,390
And to all of you.

2877
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:51,480
Thank you for playing with me, for watching.

2878
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:53,640
I would like to play again.

2879
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,280
Maybe we'll do more Fox Hunt in the future.

2880
02:46:57,300 --> 02:47:22,740

2881
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:30,340
Thank you for Superfund, MGS4T, or Foxhunt, and Shenanigans.

2882
02:47:30,880 --> 02:47:31,240
Thank you!

2883
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:32,700
Thanks for the ping.

2884
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:35,940
No, well, thank you so much for the 20!

2885
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,320
Thank you.

2886
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:39,920
I got Ocelot in the Gotcha Pool.

2887
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:41,680
It's Gotcha?

2888
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:44,900
That would explain what...

2889
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:45,220
Wait.

2890
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:47,760
Oh gosh, I wonder what else then.

2891
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:48,640
What the...

2892
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:50,760
I only have 10 minutes, so I don't think I have time.

2893
02:47:52,060 --> 02:47:52,280
But...

2894
02:47:52,280 --> 02:47:53,520
The field has been confirmed.

2895
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:55,560
Please get ready to deploy.

2896
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:57,040
Thank you, thank you.

2897
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:58,360
I guess, what is it?

2898
02:47:58,960 --> 02:48:00,880
The reward package?

2899
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:02,180
Is that how you do the gotcha?

2900
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:06,440
It's gotcha.

2901
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:10,820
But I think you have to get the experience, no?

2902
02:48:11,140 --> 02:48:11,940
Yeah, okay.

2903
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:14,780
It does not seem paid to win.

2904
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:19,380
You get 100 tokens per level up.

2905
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:22,540
That gives you three to seven pulls per request.

2906
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:23,680
Oh, nice.

2907
02:48:24,740 --> 02:48:26,160
One day I will play a game with Minto.

2908
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:27,920
Rusty Glitchface!

2909
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:31,400
Gotta go Roadrunner cartoons, my RSP!

2910
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:31,700
Oh!

2911
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:34,300
Roadrunner cartoons!

2912
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:36,060
Roadrunner cartoons!

2913
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:40,020
Yeah, it's not pay to win.

2914
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:41,440
You just gotta play the game.

2915
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:42,340
So that's good.

2916
02:48:43,360 --> 02:48:45,400
It's just gotcha for skins, you guys.

2917
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:48,400
Don't get it twisted.

2918
02:48:48,640 --> 02:48:49,400
Don't get it twisted.

2919
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:53,900
Helping enable my Oshi's gotcha addiction.

2920
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:55,160
Don't, don't, don't it!

2921
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:56,580
It's not actual money.

2922
02:49:00,100 --> 02:49:00,500
Okay.

2923
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:02,020
Well, thank you, guys.

2924
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:04,720
We can play this weekly if you want.

2925
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:07,820
You know what, actually, I've been playing so much.

2926
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:09,660
Look, you can see it.

2927
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:11,440
In the middle, you can see the boss.

2928
02:49:13,220 --> 02:49:18,840
But a game I've been playing so much is actually a clover pit.

2929
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:22,960
Wait, how'd you know?

2930
02:49:23,260 --> 02:49:24,920
This bar, how did you know?

2931
02:49:25,160 --> 02:49:26,660
I play so much Clover Pit.

2932
02:49:26,860 --> 02:49:30,320
When I have free time, I'm usually playing Clover Pit.

2933
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:36,780
Only once have I gotten further than I did on stream.

2934
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,320
Level up finds.

2935
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:39,360
Oh my gosh, Fukuoka.

2936
02:49:39,560 --> 02:49:40,180
Thank you.

2937
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,900
Let's go gambling.

2938
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:50,540
That's really, really hard for me to not stream it.

2939
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:52,220
Did you escape?

2940
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:52,580
No.

2941
02:49:55,160 --> 02:49:55,540
No.

2942
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:56,680
Oh, I told it.

2943
02:49:56,780 --> 02:49:57,520
I told you guys?

2944
02:49:57,920 --> 02:49:58,120
Oh.

2945
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:02,340
I did!

2946
02:50:03,240 --> 02:50:03,680
Wow.

2947
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:08,760
Oh yeah, I told you guys.

2948
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:11,760
Ah.

2949
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:19,280
You said you'd play Clover Pit off stream.

2950
02:50:20,740 --> 02:50:21,940
We saw the unlocks.

2951
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:22,400
How?

2952
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:25,140
Oh, in the 3D stream.

2953
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:26,960
That's right.

2954
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:28,040
I did show.

2955
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:30,160
I did show.

2956
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:31,720
That's right.

2957
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:37,880
I forgot that stream is like out of my brain because it was such a mess.

2958
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:41,800
But yeah.

2959
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:44,200
I will see you guys later.

2960
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:48,300
Tomorrow is a very spooky stream.

2961
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:49,300
We go back to spooky.

2962
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:51,380
We only have two more days left of spookiness.

2963
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:53,880
Well, I guess Silent Hill is also on Saturday.

2964
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:57,760
Two days left of Halloween spookiness.

2965
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:01,680
Tomorrow we will go on a tour.

2966
02:51:01,900 --> 02:51:02,820
You guys remember Gabe?

2967
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:05,940
He gave us a tour last time of the USS Hornet.

2968
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:11,360
Well, this time it will be all the ghost stories of the USS Hornet.

2969
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:16,740
So maybe we'll get a ghost on camera.

2970
02:51:20,280 --> 02:51:22,780
I'll make sure you guys get my best angle.

2971
02:51:28,930 --> 02:51:36,030
I'll see you guys next Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, thank you

2972
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:35,640
Thank you, thank you Thank you, Carl

2973
02:52:53,520 --> 02:53:23,190
I was just thinking yesterday I was laying on the floor I was thinking But you guys know Actually, yeah, it was something to tell you guys Because I'll be moving Sometime next year Because I plan on moving, I've actually I plan on moving quite far actually So I've been making preparations to get rid of my patchy slot.

2974
02:53:25,650 --> 02:53:30,010
But I think wherever I end up, I will probably buy a new one.

2975
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:34,150
I'll get another one.

2976
02:53:36,510 --> 02:53:36,890
Yeah.

2977
02:53:37,310 --> 02:53:39,390
But don't worry, it will come back to me.

2978
02:53:39,970 --> 02:53:42,170
They're actually quite easy to obtain, it seems.

2979
02:53:43,730 --> 02:53:44,370
So.

2980
02:53:44,930 --> 02:53:46,930
Yeah, but...

2981
02:53:48,350 --> 02:54:17,550
Yeah, I think I think it's I think I think it cannot come with me So sad Oh, yeah Is the shipping a hassle a great hassle this thing is extremely heavy you guys don't know The struggle it was to even put it into my room like I could barely even get it through the front door So...

2982
02:54:17,550 --> 02:54:18,750
Patchy slap buns...

2983
02:54:18,750 --> 02:54:19,070
No!

2984
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:20,850
No, no, no.

2985
02:54:21,330 --> 02:54:23,330
I called dims.

2986
02:54:24,650 --> 02:54:25,950
Are you changing time zones?

2987
02:54:26,830 --> 02:54:27,130
Yes!

2988
02:54:27,990 --> 02:54:31,830
But I still plan to have my streams at similar times.

2989
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:34,990
But also, I won't be moving for quite some months, so...

2990
02:54:34,990 --> 02:54:36,230
Don't need to worry about it.
