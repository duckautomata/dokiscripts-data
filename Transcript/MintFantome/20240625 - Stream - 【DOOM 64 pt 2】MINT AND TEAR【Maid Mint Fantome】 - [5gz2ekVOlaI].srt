00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,970
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,670
Welcome back to Doom 65!

3
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,450
Welcome back, master and mistress!

4
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,590
Howdy!

5
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,830
Howdy doody!

6
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,390
Hello!

7
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,550
Oh, I don't want to go into the demo mode!

8
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,590
It's been like looping for so long.

9
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,310
You know, if I just press star...

10
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,970
Okay, there we go.

11
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,190
I think now it will be fine.

12
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,810
Dropping this to say, howdy.

13
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,090
Howdy!

14
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,690
It's my birthday!

15
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,770
Happy birthday to you!

16
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,930
Happy birthday to you!

17
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,230
Happy birthday dear Roku!

18
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,910
Happy birthday to you!

19
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,280
Happy birthday!

20
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
Oh my goodness.

21
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,540
We're like barely into the stream.

22
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,740
I already got a birthday.

23
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,380
Thanks!

24
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,100
Uma musume global release!

25
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,060
Wait, oh, that's not what you said.

26
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,020
That's what Virulent said.

27
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,280
Oh, thanks for manifesting!

28
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,140
Yeah, Uma musume!

29
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,220
Yeah!

30
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,160
Guys, I'm manifesting everything, basically.

31
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,100
Manifested Metal Gear.

32
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,620
Manifested Uma musume.

33
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,700
The world is listening to me.

34
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,260
Is Archives supposed to be on?

35
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,440
I guess it's fine, but I don't want people being delayed.

36
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,720
So I turn it off.

37
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,680
You come to the stream, you come for the very exact moment that's happening.

38
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,880
Thanks for letting me know, I didn't realize.

39
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,380
Can you manifest MGS Master Collection 2 soon?

40
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:24,760
Thanks.

41
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,640
Did you see that there was like, there were like, games coming soon to PS5.

42
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,220
And one of them was Metal Gear Solid 4.

43
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,860
And I was like, I don't know if I believe that.

44
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,640
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

45
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,660
You know?

46
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,720
Can you manifest me million dollars?

47
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,620
I was watching a clip the other day of, uh, of Nero Sama playing, um, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

48
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,580
It made me want to play Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.

49
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,120
But, but, I kind of want to play it with somebody.

50
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,500
But it's also one of those types of games that, like, you can only play, like, you shouldn't play with other people.

51
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,040
You know what I mean?

52
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,740
Anyway, we're back to Doom 64.

53
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
The only thing they fear is you, Mint.

54
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,800
As they should.

55
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,240
Um, I have another meeting tonight.

56
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,960
You guys, I have three meetings today.

57
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,900
Holy cow.

58
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,260
Well, two of them were about, uh, two of them, the two this morning were for conventions.

59
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,940
Um, so...

60
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,240
But they've already been announced, conventions.

61
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,840
Um, but then I have another one tonight.

62
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,600
And so I was like, oh my goodness, busy, busy day.

63
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,960
So I gotta get through this game.

64
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,060
I gotta...

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,600
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta get through it.

66
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,360
Manifesting Minto-gun.

67
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,900
Like, uh, like Dragoon?

68
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,520
Minto-gun.

69
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,020
Helping to see you at VTuber Expo.

70
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,540
Yeah!

71
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:13,980
Yippee!

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,720
Hmm.

73
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,300
So we must mint and tear.

74
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,020
Theocrass!

75
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,280
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

76
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,940
Thank you!

77
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,740
Excited for virtual vacations?

78
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Yeah!

79
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,220
Wait, can I show you guys something real quick?

80
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,360
I moved, I moved some stuff around.

81
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,580
You're only gonna see my head here, okay?

82
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,020
Um, wait, hold on.

83
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,160
Uh.

84
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,660
There we go.

85
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,260
You're gonna, look.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,200
I have an ad corner now.

87
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,020
Look at my ad corner.

88
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,000
I have an ad...

89
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,520
I was like, I think I should maybe do that because I have things to advertise now, you know?

90
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,740
There it is, virtual vacation!

91
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,560
Things to advertise.

92
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,580
Kind of.

93
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,240
Skip ads, stop!

94
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,220
At VlogNotWork.

95
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
I take back your birthday wish!

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,580
So, um, yeah.

97
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,680
These are events and things I'm going to and doing.

98
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,160
And the podcast.

99
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,660
Episode 13 went up today.

100
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,700
Yeah!

101
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,780
Um.

102
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
So, uh, yeah.

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,100
Other conventions.

104
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
And, and the such.

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,340
Is the birthday wish also sponsored?

106
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,060
Look!

107
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,220
It's a gift!

108
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,520
Thank you, guys.

109
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,340
Now that I'm indie, if I get sponsored, I get all the money.

110
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,780
So, you know what?

111
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,300
I've been a little busy bee.

112
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,260
Oh, a busy little bee.

113
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,100
No, I want to be a little busy bee.

114
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,280
Where it means I'm a little busy.

115
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
But I'm also a bee.

116
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,860
Good luck if you don't get stuck at the same level that made me give up.

117
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,140
Uh-oh.

118
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,170
So, I realize why the game has been...

119
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,710
Oh, hold on.

120
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,190
Let's load it.

121
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,530
I realize why the game has been...

122
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:05,850
Uh-oh.

123
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,670
It's time to go back to the begin.

124
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,850
And it's because, I believe, I'm on normal mode, but with less monsters.

125
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,370
But, you know what?

126
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,970
It's fine, because I'm having fun, so whatever.

127
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,370
You'll keep the money!

128
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,710
Oh, Oscar.

129
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,830
You're such an idiot.

130
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,970
Someone tell me there's a problem with my AI.

131
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,850
What's wrong?

132
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,230
My childhood.

133
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,330
Oh, Asgore.

134
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,950
You keep the money.

135
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,770
Oh, Asgore.

136
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,350

00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,910
This is a sponsored super chat.

140
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,850
I am the sponsor.

141
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,710
That is all.

142
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,070
Thank you.

143
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,790
Thank you.

144
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,700
Is that guy dead?

145
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,480
Let me know how the audio is, by the way, too.

146
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,740
I have to remember how to play.

147
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,260
Okay, hold on.

148
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,560
So... 2... 3... 4...

149
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,780
5...

150
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,180
6...

151
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,940
7...

152
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,220
8...

153
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,560
8...

154
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,060
Oh, 3.

155
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,060
You killed him 5 seconds before a save.

156
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,400
Oh.

157
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,740
Wowee.

158
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,900
I have a question.

159
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,620
Does Doom 64... I know with Doom 1 and 2, the bitrate would be insanely bad while playing.

160
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
Is it the same with Doom 64?

161
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,940
Or is it...

162
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,760
Not so bad.

163
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,800
How do I stop running?

164
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,320
I guess I don't need to know how to stop running.

165
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,160
I just need to...

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,420
Oh!

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Oh my god.

168
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,340
Oh my god.

169
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,320
Are they coming this way?

170
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh, they're coming this way.

171
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,680
They're coming this way.

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,300
They're coming this way.

173
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,700
Yeah, take that, bozo.

174
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
It has the audio.

175
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,480
Just let me know.

176
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,740
I can make it better or worse.

177
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,320
Audio's okay?

178
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,040
It's not too loud?

179
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,900
Thank you.

180
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,840
I hear more.

181
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,520
Someone's still throwing stuff at me.

182
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,380
How do I get up there?

183
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,480
Hello?

184
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,960
Let me in, please!

185
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,880
Rapunzel!

186
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:00,820
Rapunzel!

187
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,020
Let down your long hair.

188
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,900
How do I get...

189
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,860
Oh, there was a stairs over here, wasn't there?

190
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,520
Wanderblast, thank you for a whole month.

191
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,240
Thank you.

192
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,200
Oh, there's also over here.

193
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,680
Wait, hold on.

194
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,820
Let's see if we can take down...

195
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,220
What the... Oh, no, no, no, no!

196
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,240
It's a spider demon!

197
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,060
Maybe this thing would be better.

198
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,840
Oh, shoot.

199
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,680
Take out one thing at least.

200
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,460
Take it out.

201
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,940
Take it out.

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,420
Take it out.

203
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,680
Uh... uh...

204
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,320
Oh, they're

205
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,580
fighting.

206
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,260
Oh, shoot.

207
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,320
I got hit.

208
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,320
They're in fighting.

209
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:46,960
They're in fighting.

210
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,700
The girls are fighting.

211
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,820
Who's gonna win?

212
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,220
Uh-oh.

213
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,920
I think they'll win.

214
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,540
I took him out.

215
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,540
Ow!

216
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,100
Oh, my God.

217
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,700
What the hell?

218
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,340
That's so unfair.

219
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,800
That's so unfair.

220
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't hurt me from here.

221
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,560
How... Oh, this opened up.

222
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,920
Overkill.

223
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,800
It's fine.

224
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,440
That was insanity.

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm just taking all the bullets.

226
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,700
What am I hearing?

227
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,720
Okay, let's go upstairs.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,560
MENTIONTAIR!

229
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,120
MENTIONTAIR!

230
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,840
I had to un... make him.

231
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,020
MENTIONTAIR!

232
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,100
That's...

233
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,520
Dogs may be able to look up, but Doom Mint can't.

234
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,880
How do I get to this thing?

235
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,120
How do I interact with stuff, actually, now that I think about it?

236
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,000
Was it E?

237
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,200
E to interact?

238
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,220
Yes.

239
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,060
Where are you?

240
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,660
Someone.

241
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:04,740
Someone.

242
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,760
Okay.

243
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,700
Oh, wait.

244
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,980
Is there a thing?

245
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,340
Oh, no.

246
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,020
I can't grip that.

247
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,360
Grab that.

248
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,540
E to believe.

249
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm just going to ignore those.

250
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,040
Guys!

251
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
This is a...

252
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,420
Ow!

253
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,480
Gosh, I hate the lost souls, you sons of bitches.

254
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,240
What's five?

255
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,540
Nope.

256
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
That's not what I meant to do.

257
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
But you know what?

258
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:34,980
It works.

259
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,320
I'm at four!

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,320
There we go.

261
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,600
Raylan!

262
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,040
Thank you for the 50 gift attack!

263
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,460
Ow!

264
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,040
Thank you so much.

265
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,020
Anybody in here?

266
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,260
Some uglies over here.

267
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,040
Nice gifts.

268
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,680
Thank you so much!

269
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,340
Thank you!

270
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,640
Thank you!

271
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:00,880
Thank you!

272
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,880
Really do appreciate it.

273
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,160
Oh, this guy.

274
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,110
I just wanted to share that my family and I celebrated our cat's birthday today.

275
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,850
Happy birthday to your cat!

276
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,850
Can I get this guy?

277
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,910
He doesn't know I'm here, idiot.

278
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,370
Idiot!

279
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,030
Idiot!

280
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,990
Why am I hearing so many people?

281
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,690
I'm scared of that room.

282
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,810
Why am I hearing so many people?

283
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,770
It's a monster po...

284
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,390
Oh!

285
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,450
Oh my god, again?

286
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:57,910
Wait.

287
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,610
Oh, they're all stuck in here.

288
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,850
You activated my trap card!

289
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,570
Happy birthday to the cat.

290
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,790
Go, go, go.

291
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:17,930
Well...

292
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,310
Anyways, how are you guys doing?

293
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:22,790
Sorry.

294
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,680
Oh, good.

295
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,740
For some reason, I keep thinking they're gonna be able to hit me, but I know they're not.

296
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,120
I love old game limitations!

297
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sick!

298
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm sick of you!

299
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,900
I'm just kidding.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,640
I hope you feel better.

301
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm sorry you're sick.

302
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,740
Sick in the head.

303
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,160
No, I'm just kidding.

304
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm sorry you're sick.

305
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,140
Sorry you're not feeling well.

306
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,560
It sucks.

307
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,400
Oh, there's a lot of guys in there.

308
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,160
Wait a second.

309
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,140
Let's get a...

310
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,240
Anybody left?

311
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,880
Nobody left.

312
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,920
Did I

313
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:28,940
get him?

314
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,020
No, I didn't even get him.

315
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,860
Oh my god, he scared me!

316
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,180
He really spooked me!

317
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,840
Ah!

318
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,900
Sorry.

319
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,780
It's always these guys.

320
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,100
These guys will actually be the death of me, I think.

321
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,420
These little losers.

322
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,150
Blueberry, blueberry, blueberry...

323
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:58,950
Ah!

324
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:03,790
Here they...

325
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,610
Oh, here they come!

326
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

327
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,230
Rip a die!

328
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:10,870
Rip a die!

329
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,010
Am I even hitting anybody?

330
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,210
I can't even tell just die!

331
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,930
So many tomatoes.

332
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,490
Tomatoes.

333
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,490
A spicy meatball!

334
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,950
These guys are more meatball-y than before.

335
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,030
I can't get them from here very easily.

336
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,140
Let's get them from down here.

337
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,100
There we go.

338
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,380
That'll teach them.

339
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,060
Blueberry.

340
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,640
Hey, but we lost no health even though we got the blueberry.

341
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,960
Very good.

342
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,060
So that's gonna go up into there.

343
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,220
Sorry, I'm just trying to get my bearings.

344
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,600
Oh, this is water!

345
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,370
No one else.

346
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,110
Only a barbecue.

347
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,210
Those are some angry meatballs.

348
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,090
Yeah, these guys are pretty meatball-like.

349
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,270
I'm trying to grab their shotguns.

350
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,150
I'm too fast.

351
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,830
Too furious.

352
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,650
Spray and pray.

353
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,870
That is the basis of all combat.

354
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,330
I hate you guys!

355
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,090
But there is definitely some guys I haven't gotten yet.

356
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,850
If I don't want to leave yet.

357
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,030
Wait, also, how do I leave?

358
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,490
Wait.

359
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,090
Hmm.

360
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,550
Huh!

361
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,510
Curious!

362
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,710
Oh!

363
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,530
Yeah!

364
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,290
But there's some guys I haven't gotten yet.

365
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,490
No secret.

366
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,290
See?

367
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,390
You can hear them, you can hear them.

368
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,630
Where are they?

369
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,150
Oh no, this is where I just came from.

370
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,570
Hello?

371
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,630
Hello?

372
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,760
Where are you at?

373
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Monster?

374
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,840
Peter, thanks for the super chat.

375
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,820
Really appreciate it.

376
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,820
Oh yeah, like through here?

377
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,020
Check your map.

378
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,780
Wait, how do I zoom out again?

379
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:12,370
I'm gonna give one little run around and if I can't find these losers, I'm out of here.

380
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,250
Wait, what is this?

381
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,110
The golden cube.

382
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,410
Draco, thanks for the 10 gifted.

383
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,050
The golden cube.

384
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,830
Also, this right here?

385
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,390
There's so much here.

386
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,050
And that back... Wait, I think I can get to that, right?

387
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,870
Hold on.

388
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,770
Wait, wait.

389
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,420
I got a super shotgun.

390
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,620
Oh, I already had that.

391
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,900
But how do I see?

392
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,120
I think I need to like walk along this, right?

393
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,560
How do I get... Oh!

394
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,420
Oops.

395
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,160
Okay, hold on.

396
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,200
I have really...

397
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,240
Pointless secret found.

398
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,040
I have really short legs.

399
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,400
Okay, okay, hold on.

400
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,480
Get up here.

401
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,840
Or really, bad balance is what I meant to say.

402
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,220
Oh no!

403
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
I think I give up.

404
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,940
No, I don't need a backpack.

405
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,580
What am I?

406
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,100
What am I?

407
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,440
A baby?

408
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,760
Go up.

409
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,280
Lift up?

410
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,720
No?

411
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,820
Never mind.

412
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,660
What about over... Oh!

413
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,180
There's just some random pinkies running around.

414
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,780
What are you guys doing?

415
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,580
They're running around like they own the place.

416
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,140
Yeah!

417
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,300
They're like...

418
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,640
Where are the pinkies?

419
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,080
Where are the pinkies?

420
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh, here too.

421
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay.

422
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,420
Another one.

423
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,840
Another little...

424
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,160
Nice.

425
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,140
Where are the pinkies?

426
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,460
What is this?

427
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,860
I guess I think it's a rocket launcher.

428
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,580
And then this opens up here.

429
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,820
Ahh.

430
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,380
Okay, I think we actually got it now.

431
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,960
Let us leave.

432
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,900
Rocket launcher.

433
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,880
Have fun ripping and tearing.

434
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,480
Thank you.

435
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,200
Well, I thought I got some secrets, but you know, whatever, I guess.

436
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,160
What's this thing?

437
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,120
What's this thing?

438
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,800
What's this thing?

439
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,440
No secrets here.

440
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,260
Why can't I grab it though?

441
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,500
What?

442
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
What's the point?

443
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,140
Oh my god.

444
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,720
Oh my god.

445
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,020
I just realized everything that's here.

446
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,620
Change.

447
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,060
Save?

448
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,980
Oh, thank you.

449
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,740
I shall save!

450
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,300
Yes.

451
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,960
Helloooo.

452
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,370
Helloooo!

453
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,230
AAAAAAAH!

454
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,630
No!

455
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,810
No!

456
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,510
I got the chaingun!

457
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,810
LOL Hahaha...

458
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,180
That was awkward.

459
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,380
Sorry, sorry, sorry, everybody.

460
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,920
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

461
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,380
Sorry, everybody.

462
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,280
I lost my whole blueberry in one room.

463
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,280
Red key.

464
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

465
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,620
We're fine.

466
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,280
I would have bought gamer subs if not...

467
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,160
Oh, I wouldn't have bought gamer subs if not for your boomer code.

468
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,100
Ah, thank you for using it.

469
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,940
Appreciate it.

470
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,840
Maybe one day I can get a cup or a flavor.

471
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,380
Well, that was very cool.

472
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,560
Let's load the game.

473
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,620
I'm not starting...

474
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,540
this level.

475
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,060
Okay.

476
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,560
Okay.

477
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,600
We know that that box in the middle is evil.

478
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,260
Evil, evil...

479
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,140
I don't even know why.

480
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,920
I don't even know why.

481
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,800
It does that.

482
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,320
It's so evil.

483
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,000
I saw a guy over there.

484
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,460
Oh, you can see them.

485
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,040
See, he's like kind of behind the pillar.

486
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,880
Okay, I'm just gonna go in with the chain gun though.

487
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,680
Shout out to that save reminder.

488
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,820
I know, I know, for real.

489
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Whoever told me to save, you're the best.

490
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,960
Oucha!

491
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,480
Look at that.

492
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,380
Look at that difference.

493
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,180
The difference in everything.

494
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,540
But this like blew up, right?

495
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,220
When I got it.

496
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,840
I don't know why.

497
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,060
I'm just gonna leave it up there for now.

498
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,100
Okay.

499
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,700
Next room is also dangerous.

500
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,220
This couldn't be the level that people were talking about.

501
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
That's so scary, right?

502
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,680
Oh my gosh, wait.

503
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,380
Oh!

504
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:04,740
Ah!

505
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,480
I hear them.

506
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:23,960
I hear them.

507
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,880
Let's see how far they can go.

508
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,540
Here we go.

509
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:40,720
Let's go!

510
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:40,980
Take that!

511
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,480
Take that!

512
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,540
Oh, I think he's dead.

513
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,060
Why!

514
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,660
Sneaky!

515
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,440
Sneaky skull.

516
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,740
Skull!

517
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,540
Even sneakier skull!

518
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,120
What the heck?

519
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,800
You fight demons good.

520
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,580
I thought this was like a berry.

521
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,040
I can't even see in there.

522
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,180
I'm going to go back to the chain gun.

523
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,460
Blueberry!

524
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,300
Blueberry!

525
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,420
Blueberry.

526
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,820
How do I get this guy?

527
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,140
Wait.

528
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,350
Did I miss it?

529
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,570
Did I miss my shot?

530
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,310
Short king.

531
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,270
The guy doesn't know how to use his arms.

532
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,030
I don't think he's ever used them once in his life.

533
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,870
Actually...

534
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,450
Actually...

535
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,270
I'm kind of confused.

536
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,050
How do I get out of here?

537
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,230
Now that I think about it.

538
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,790
I thought this was an exit.

539
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,330
But it's not.

540
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,110
Oh!

541
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,470
Sorry.

542
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,550
Did you guys see the Mata?

543
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,910
I'm so sorry.

544
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,350
Sorry.

545
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,450
I didn't realize you guys...

546
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:28,950
Oh!

547
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,350
Here we go.

548
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,450
Oh!

549
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,270
Oh!

550
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,570
I understand what that was now.

551
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,070
Um...

552
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:40,870
Um...

553
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,370
Um...

554
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:44,790
Um...

555
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,870
Ummm...

556
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,130
Yeah.

557
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,460
Oh.

558
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:54,840
Actually...

559
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,720
we need more armor.

560
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,420
I guess this is...

561
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,560
Oh.

562
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,020
Oh...

563
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,300
Wait.

564
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,380
Can I get out of here?

565
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,900
Oh here we go.

566
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,180
Restart?

567
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,680
Oh shoot.

568
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
No, it's fine.

569
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,360
It's fine.

570
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,900
In the meantime, they were able to reload.

571
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,300
Just watching it lower was so...

572
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,240
Okay, this thing explodes, doesn't it?

573
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:39,880
Oh my goodness.

574
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,370
Oh my goodness.

575
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:42,750
Oh my goodness.

576
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,190
Oh my goodness.

577
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,550
Oh my goodness.

578
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:43,990
Oh my goodness.

579
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,350
Oh my goodness.

580
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,430
Oh my goodness.

581
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,870
I think I'm...

582
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,070
Shoot.

583
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,470
Shoot.

584
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,250
Shoot.

585
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,290
Shoot and kill.

586
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,810
Kill.

587
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,330
Rip and tear.

588
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,010
Rip and tear.

589
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,190
Rip and tear while I'm alive.

590
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,170
Oh my god.

591
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,790
I'm out of ammo.

592
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,510
This isn't so great.

593
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,430
I need to get this guy over here.

594
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,370
This heckin' dude.

595
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,880
Okay.

596
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,920
Now I feel a little bit more safe.

597
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,460
Well, safe is, you know...

598
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,540
Okay, we got him.

599
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:45,860
Oh!

600
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,700
We got him.

601
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,480
Okay.

602
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,140
Can I touch this?

603
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,440
Can't tell if it's lava or...

604
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,820
Where does it go?

605
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm so curious.

606
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,220
Try it.

607
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,700
I think I can lick it.

608
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,960
Ria Kari, thanks for the 20 gifted.

609
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,660
Thank you so much.

610
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,500
Thank you.

611
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,560
Good, we got more bullets.

612
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,140
Oh, that's health.

613
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,240
Sorry, I'm just looking.

614
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,340
You think I can lick it?

615
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,120
Or...

616
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,720
Turns my gun red.

617
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,580
Feels kinda nice.

618
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,860
Actually, like, when I get really close...

619
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,980
I feel like I'm moving.

620
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,400
I feel like I'm actually going up.

621
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,520
Oh, okay.

622
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,320
Now demonic.

623
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,190
Wait.

624
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,290
Was there a switch over here or something?

625
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,110
Where's the...

626
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,750
Oh, here.

627
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,790
Here.

628
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,110
You guys are terrible.

629
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,830
Why are you in jail?

630
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,250
Give you the after credits scroll syndrome.

631
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,210
I know.

632
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,970
Yeah, you can see the buttholes like really clearly right now.

633
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,350
Like just gaping, gaping, gaping buttholes.

634
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,010
On all of these guys.

635
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,430
Oh, sorry.

636
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,810
My head's blocking the butthole.

637
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,550
Oh, ViviCore thinks you're the gifted.

638
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,970
Phyllis, welcome to Mamba Show.

639
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,550
Indecent exposure.

640
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,690
What if they're like the Romeo and Juliet of demons?

641
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,710
You know?

642
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,750
Split to the other side.

643
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,530
You.

644
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,150
Okay.

645
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,530
Wait, there's more?

646
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,770
Oh, I thought I killed you.

647
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,490
There we go.

648
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,170
Get his butt.

649
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,430
Why are all these guys in jail?

650
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,070
Not you.

651
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,130
You.

652
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,530
Wait, that's a big guy.

653
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,130
Hold on.

654
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:07,650
Hold on.

655
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,110
I got stuck on something.

656
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,750
Did I just see...

657
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,490
Did I just see one of those little skulls?

658
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,010
I think so.

659
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,390
Or I saw something, right?

660
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,030
Oh, ah!

661
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,790
Yes, I did.

662
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,350
Oh, my God.

663
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,070
You son of a gun.

664
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,410
I think there's one in there, too.

665
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:37,790
Yeah.

666
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,290
Okay.

667
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,030
I got him.

668
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,710
Oh, there's more.

669
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,810
Can I stop missing for two seconds?

670
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,570
Thank you.

671
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,910
I'm trying to strafe, but I guess I don't need to because he's slow.

672
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,890
Slow.

673
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,090
Slow is molasses, demon.

674
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,390
Oh, my God.

675
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:57,990
Ah!

676
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,650
Leave me alone!

677
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,110
I'm trying to kill another demon.

678
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,450
What are you so obsessed with dying?

679
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:05,890
Uh-oh.

680
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,410
The skull ain't slow.

681
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,550
Look, they were idols on the stage, actually.

682
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,990
I was just actually at an idol live.

683
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,870
Aim doko.

684
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,210
I don't know.

685
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:23,730
You're not...

686
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,410
You don't have to aim in Doom.

687
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:25,910
That's what...

688
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,310
Doom...

689
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,390
If Doom has taught me anything...

690
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,230
You don't have to aim.

691
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,190
Doom is automatic aimbot.

692
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,330
It's great.

693
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,030
Rocket launcher.

694
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,500
How many guns are you able to carry?

695
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,340
Right now, I have eight, I believe.

696
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,360
I need them both.

697
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,100
Hmm.

698
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,200
If I watch the idol show...

699
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,060
Oh, maybe they go down if I press the buttons.

700
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,600
You just point and shoot.

701
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,080
Point and shoot.

702
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,600
Point and shoot, man.

703
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,400
Oh...

704
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Hmm.

705
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,340
Maybe I have to...

706
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,640
I'm scared.

707
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,700
Is there an order?

708
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,240
Ugh.

709
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:23,940
Ugh.

710
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,060
Ugh.

711
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,420
Ugh.

712
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:25,700
Ugh.

713
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,200
Ugh.

714
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,860
Ugh.

715
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,000
Ugh.

716
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,340
Ugh.

717
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,800
Ugh.

718
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,700
Ugh.

719
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,260
Ugh.

720
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,420
Ugh.

721
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:30,680
Ugh.

722
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,500
Ugh.

723
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,840
I have all the rockets I need...

724
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,200
Maybe if I do it from...

725
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,160
This one.

726
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,760
I forgot I had that.

727
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,260
No!

728
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,200
I have no more bullets!

729
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,740
I have no regular bullets!

730
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,180
Maybe if I do...

731
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,530
I still can't reach the blueberry.

732
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,710
How do I change to the other... Oh, here we go, here we go.

733
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,410
Right?

734
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

735
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,160
Next.

736
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,500
Blueberry, blueberry... Blueberry?

737
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,260
Run, run, run, run, run.

738
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,680
Get me out of here.

739
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,800
All speared up and ready to go.

740
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,320
Exactly.

741
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm scared of this level already.

742
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,480
I don't trust it at all.

743
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,340
I don't trust this level.

744
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,320
I need more regular bullets.

745
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,980
Which one did I choose?

746
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,870
Wait, where do I go?

747
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,290
I pressed a button.

748
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,710
Opened up some... some... some... something.

749
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,070
Oh!

750
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,710
A portal!

751
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,330
Box of bullets!

752
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,750
We're back here.

753
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,130
How curious.

754
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,770
More bullets.

755
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,430
Bullets.

756
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,490
Many bullets.

757
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,090
Necessary.

758
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,990
Health.

759
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,370
Shotgun.

760
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,790
Take it, I'll take it.

761
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,410
I'll take everything.

762
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,070
What do you think are gonna come flying out of there?

763
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,560
I did not expect arrows!

764
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh!

765
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,380
I thought it was gonna be a little skulls!

766
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,580
Nice!

767
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,720
Oh my god!

768
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,620
Come on!

769
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,500
Stop walking.

770
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,860
Oh, my god.

771
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:38,880
Oh my god!

772
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,840
I walked right into it!

773
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,090
Can you please hit once?

774
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,150
Can you... can you... I just... can you...

775
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,950
Oh my gosh, I'm not anticipating...

776
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,830
Oh, I got him!

777
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,790
That was exciting.

778
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,270
Oh, I... I went berserk-o!

779
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,830
Okay, it actually stopped.

780
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,170
Wow.

781
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,570
Aim doko.

782
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,410
Aim... Gosh, I wish I had a middle finger asset right now.

783
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,790
So I could say, aim doko!

784
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,810
And then give you a shiny bird.

785
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,730
Next outfit.

786
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,330
Speaking of outfits, you guys like Doki's new skin suit?

787
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,490
Where... Oh, I remember where the red key was for.

788
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,330
Okay.

789
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,530
I can't believe she threw away the eyepatch option.

790
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,610
What an idiot.

791
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,590
Did I go through here?

792
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,970
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,210
Okay.

794
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,680
Oh, wait.

795
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,420
I do want that.

796
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,480
Um, I think I'm in trouble.

797
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,040
Maybe the Lin fight.

798
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,440
Maybe not.

799
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,880
Why'd you have to leave?

800
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,280
Come on, come here.

801
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,980
Oh, my God!

802
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,300
Oh, my God.

803
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh, that was not a good idea.

804
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,360
You guys, don't do that.

805
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,620
That was not a good idea.

806
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,700
She's pitaco, just like you now.

807
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,740
She's actually medium, which is quite premium.

808
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,340
Why did I even hit?

809
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,620
I thought I was aiming at him.

810
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,160
Oh, my gosh.

811
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,240
The rockets are coming back again, even.

812
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:43,900
Again?

813
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,000
Again?

814
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,580
I'm getting sick of this nonsense.

815
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,740
I'm getting sick of this nonsense.

816
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,300
Mint, are you for real?

817
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,420
What are you talking about?

818
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,420
What did I say?

819
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,220
What did I do?

820
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,520
I'm always real.

821
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,360
I'm keeping it real.

822
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,480
I'm always keeping it real.

823
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,900
Smash or pass for the Doom demons.

824
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,400
Let's go.

825
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,380
If that's too deviant...

826
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,320
What's FMK?

827
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,100
FMK.

828
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:36,920
Wait.

829
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,120
We went this way, right?

830
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,580
So now we go to the red.

831
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,800
Oh goodness gracious!

832
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,760
Leave me alone!

833
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,520
Leave me alone!

834
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,080
Leave me alone!

835
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,820
Leave me alone!

836
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,540
Leave me alone!

837
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,200
Leave me alone!

838
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,200
Oh, frick, merry kill!

839
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,100
For the doomed humans!

840
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,940
Oh, I wish I could have gotten another berry.

841
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,780
No, no, no, no!

842
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,360
Oh well.

843
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,760
Let's see.

844
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,280
Kill...

845
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,580
Kill...

846
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,800
All the little baby demons.

847
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,980
Frick the spider monster.

848
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,200
Merry Pinky.

849
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,520
Blood keep.

850
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,080
Oh, kill the spider monster.

851
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:29,640
Kill the lost souls.

852
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:29,840
Yes!

853
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,380
Kill the lost souls!

854
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,840
Kill the lost souls.

855
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,230
Merry Pinky is the right choice.

856
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,070
Isn't it?

857
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,750
Just feels right.

858
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,930
Just feels right.

859
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,690
Yes, save.

860
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,410
Oh.

861
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,210
Oh.

862
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,910
There's lots of...

863
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,430
What's it called?

864
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,350
Where did you come from?

865
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,370
For real!

866
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,110
I'm always getting shot by those guys.

867
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,250
Can I kill more than one thing?

868
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,870
It's my frick merry kill.

869
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,090
I can kill whoever I want.

870
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,110
No, I don't want to go outside yet.

871
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,190
Is this a door?

872
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,050
Where did you come from?

873
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,850
Where did you come from?

874
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,970
You're medium, but Doki is now clearly flat as a board.

875
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,590
When she was like, wait for the...

876
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:41,990
Whatever the...

877
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,390
I really thought she was gonna...

878
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:46,710
Ouch!

879
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,490
Oh my goodness.

880
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,210
There's a lot going on here.

881
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:51,690
Okay, hold on.

882
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,290
I'm just doing circles.

883
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,410
Oh!

884
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:06,990
Oh my gosh.

885
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,150
I walked right into it.

886
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,850
I think I'm gonna die.

887
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,450
For realsies.

888
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,770
Oh my god.

889
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,370
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

890
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,250
Was that a lost soul?

891
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:20,990
Was that a...

892
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,370
Oh no, it's just a regular.

893
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,990
I'm sick of these fellows.

894
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:30,530
Ouch!

895
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,850
I'm getting stuck on the tree!

896
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:34,550
Leave me alone!

897
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,690
Why won't you die?

898
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,450
There, I got one at least.

899
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,050
Goodness gracious!

900
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:50,510
What was I saying?

901
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,710
Oh, when she said, wait for the...

902
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,690
I can't even think of the word.

903
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,590
The reference sheet.

904
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,010
I really thought...

905
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,250
The whole time.

906
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,910
But she was like, wait for the reference sheet, you guys.

907
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,310
It'll change your mind.

908
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,630
Oh, they're all spawning!

909
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,370
That's what's happening.

910
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:17,810
Yeah.

911
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,450
I really thought, though, that she meant it.

912
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,270
Who's in there?

913
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:31,670
Can't even reach it.

914
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,510
She baited us.

915
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,410
I think it's really cute.

916
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,390
Really cute outfit.

917
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:39,890
So...

918
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,130
Um...

919
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,230
It made me think.

920
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,550
I was like, you know...

921
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,730
It's obviously very different.

922
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,500
There probably will be people who are like...

923
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,490
Oh...

924
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,990
It's such a big change.

925
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:53,450
You know?

926
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,710
Where are you?

927
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,030
Where?

928
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,590
Where?

929
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,050
Where?

930
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,990
It made me think, like...

931
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,470
You know, if I were to...

932
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:05,970
Oh my gosh!

933
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,590
If I were to ever change...

934
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,270
If like...

935
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:10,830
You know...

936
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,370
If you guys...

937
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,370
Would be okay...

938
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,730
With it...

939
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,370
I'm like trying to snipe with a...

940
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:21,350
Damn...

941
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,310
A damn shotgun.

942
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,090
It did from 1.0.

943
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,230
Well, I mean, like if I say...

944
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:38,650
Like a different mama or something.

945
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,150
I don't know.

946
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:40,470
Is what I meant.

947
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,090
Trying to get this guy.

948
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,870
Did I get him?

949
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,110
Did he die?

950
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,990
Please leave me alone!

951
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,010
They're just jealous...

952
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,770
Of my intact...

953
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:58,410
Bumhole.

954
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,490
Oh my goodness.

955
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:03,790
Leave me alone!

956
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:05,810
Oh, there he is.

957
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,350
He blends in with the dark.

958
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,870
Oh...

959
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:15,650
Oh...

960
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,250
You guys know what I mean.

961
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,630
It's because they all have...

962
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,690
You know...

963
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,570
All their little bums are...

964
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,770
You know...

965
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,070
You know?

966
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,250
I need a red key.

967
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,790
What's in here?

968
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,910
Not a friend.

969
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,150
A foe.

970
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:41,710
Stop saying bum.

971
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:42,230
Sorry.

972
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,250
What else should I...

973
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:46,370
How do I address it?

974
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,390
I don't even know where I am.

975
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,210
I'm so lost.

976
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:52,830
Oh.

977
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,230
I'm so lost, you guys.

978
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:57,610
I'm so lost, you guys.

979
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,210
Gaping hole.

980
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,630
Did I just do something?

981
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,230
Oh, I need the blue key.

982
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,810
Oh, I need the blue key.

983
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,590
I'm so lost right now.

984
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,810
Okay, red key, blue key.

985
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,410
Is that red or yellow?

986
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,110
That's like kinda orange-ish, right?

987
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,110
Derriere.

988
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,450
Derriere.

989
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:23,850
Derriere.

990
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:23,990
Derriere.

991
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,290
Derriere.

992
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,090
Derriere.

993
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,020
Where can I get anything, though?

994
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,140
Box of rockets?

995
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:34,800
Box of rockets?

996
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,220
This seems like a...

997
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,300
This seems like a door.

998
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,560
Yeah.

999
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:44,880
Oh!

1000
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,960
Look at that!

1001
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,920
What did I get?

1002
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,540
What did I do?

1003
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,040
Huh?

1004
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:05,510
Okay.

1005
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,600
I'm going berserk.

1006
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,960
Hmm.

1007
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh.

1008
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,040
Oh.

1009
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,360
Pinky.

1010
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,260
Oh.

1011
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,500
Interesting.

1012
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,140
Okay.

1013
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,280
I don't know what the hell is going on.

1014
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,820
Ah!

1015
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,520
Why?

1016
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,680
Why are you in the library?

1017
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,680
You don't look like you read.

1018
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,220
Tale as old as time.

1019
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,000
Tale as old as time.

1020
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,080
Song as old as rhyme.

1021
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,740
Beauty and the...

1022
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,780
Oh.

1023
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,260
Okay.

1024
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,380
I have to open that.

1025
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,620
Beast.

1026
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,680
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1027
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,180
You're right.

1028
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,300
I was literally telling that to people earlier.

1029
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,280
Not earlier, but like...

1030
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,940
I was like, hey.

1031
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,340
You can't judge this.

1032
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,020
You don't even know what it's...

1033
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,320
Oh!

1034
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:28,740
Okay.

1035
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,320
Here's a yellow.

1036
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,880
But where's the yellow key?

1037
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,940
I don't even know where it's at.

1038
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,120
And we gotta get... Oh!

1039
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,840
There's the blue key.

1040
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,860
Oh.

1041
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,840
I go in here.

1042
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,320
Oh.

1043
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,740
Here we go.

1044
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,660
Oh!

1045
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:42,800
Oh!

1046
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,500
Oh my god!

1047
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,760
They're so blue!

1048
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,460
I have to be a proper demon.

1049
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,480
Demons are often teachers.

1050
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,400
Oh my goodness.

1051
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,480
Barely.

1052
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,420
And their things are faster.

1053
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,680
Hey.

1054
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,060
Hey.

1055
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,160
Come out.

1056
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:00,700
Dummy.

1057
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,170
Where am I?

1058
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:11,970
Where's the key?

1059
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,190
Oh.

1060
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,870
What's this?

1061
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,210
Run!

1062
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,270
Blueberry!

1063
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,690
Oh my god.

1064
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,090
Oh my god.

1065
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,150
We're fine.

1066
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,090
Where's the key?

1067
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:33,970
Key?

1068
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:34,410
Coco!

1069
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:35,710
Asoco!

1070
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:36,330
Not Coco.

1071
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,010
Asoco.

1072
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,010
Coco.

1073
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,830
Coco!

1074
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,190
Asoco!

1075
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:44,470
Oh my god.

1076
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:44,750
Oh my god.

1077
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:45,210
I'm gonna die!

1078
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:45,710
I'm gonna die!

1079
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,110
I'm gonna die!

1080
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:46,970
Oh my god.

1081
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:47,670
I'm gonna die for real.

1082
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,350
I'm gonna die for real.

1083
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:48,850
Please.

1084
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:49,150
Please.

1085
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:49,450
Please.

1086
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:49,690
Please.

1087
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:49,790
Please.

1088
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,150
I just got the blueberry.

1089
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,230
Don't do this to me.

1090
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,750
You're rude.

1091
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,030
You're so rude.

1092
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:57,730
No.

1093
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,090
I just got the blueberry.

1094
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,310
I just got it.

1095
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:07,430
I just got it.

1096
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:07,510
Coco.

1097
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:08,130
Shoko.

1098
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,310
Asoco.

1099
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,990
What's over here anyway?

1100
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:15,450
What's over here anyway?

1101
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,790
A blue door.

1102
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:18,430
Oh.

1103
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,290
I can't go through that.

1104
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,270
That's probably the exit, right?

1105
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,790
They're abusing the lost souls in this.

1106
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:26,230
I swear.

1107
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,710
I swear.

1108
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,170
I swear.

1109
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,590
Easy come, easy go.

1110
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,030
I'll never have a blueberry again.

1111
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,090
I'll never get one again, you guys.

1112
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,050
What's in here?

1113
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,970
This seems pretty...

1114
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,430
Okay.

1115
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:05,490
Okay.

1116
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,190
Okay.

1117
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:08,990
Okay.

1118
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,870
The spicy water.

1119
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:12,730
Oh my god.

1120
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:14,350
Oh no.

1121
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:14,470
No.

1122
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:14,730
No.

1123
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:14,870
No.

1124
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:15,030
No.

1125
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,210
No.

1126
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:15,430
No.

1127
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,550
No.

1128
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:15,750
No.

1129
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,830
No.

1130
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:15,930
No.

1131
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,210
Oh no.

1132
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,570
I think I'm gonna be...

1133
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,350
I think I'm gonna be in trouble here.

1134
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,350
Nothing sus about this room.

1135
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,310
Absolutely not.

1136
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,910
It doesn't look like the ceilings will come down any second to try and crush me.

1137
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,130
It doesn't look like the ceilings will come down any second to try and crush me.

1138
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:31,870
I'm just gonna run for it.

1139
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,800
Remember if you're lost in doom, unlike real life, if people are trying to kill you?

1140
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,320
You're going the right way.

1141
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,500
What about the other side though?

1142
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:53,920
Blue key.

1143
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,520
What did I just open?

1144
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,660
What did I just open?

1145
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,340
Oh.

1146
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,720
I think it's just a rocket launcher.

1147
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,140
Okay.

1148
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,580
Here we go.

1149
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,420
Run.

1150
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,960
Easy mode.

1151
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,600
Minto gaming.

1152
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,240
Minto always gaming.

1153
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,860
Minto always gaming.

1154
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,560
How do I get...

1155
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,780
This way.

1156
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,440
Not even a problem.

1157
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,920
I have to be better about not being so hesitant.

1158
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,260
But also...

1159
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,720
I'm such a cautious gamer.

1160
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,660
Such a cautious...

1161
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,620
Maybe not even a gamer.

1162
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,860
I'm a cautious person.

1163
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,780
I'm a cautious ghost.

1164
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,280
I've died once.

1165
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,840
I don't wanna die again.

1166
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,680
You know what I mean?

1167
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,310
Did I get everything in here?

1168
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,710
This feels like so...

1169
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,350
It was yellow.

1170
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,590
I don't wanna die again.

1171
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,210
So... I just am cautious.

1172
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,210
About...

1173
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,390
Where I go and...

1174
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,670
What I'm doing.

1175
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:10,990
Anyway.

1176
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:26,950
Dang.

1177
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,170
He's just throwing them.

1178
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,410
We interrupted the class, everybody.

1179
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,870
Pinky, your husband...

1180
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,030
No!

1181
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,950
Also...

1182
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,190
What's that over there?

1183
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,310
Interesting.

1184
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,490
Where are you?

1185
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,250
Oh my god!

1186
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,770
I didn't see him at all.

1187
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,120
Gosh.

1188
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,400
This level is pretty long.

1189
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,600
Oh my god.

1190
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,100
There's two of them.

1191
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:11,980
Oh.

1192
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,420
Never mind.

1193
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,440
Nice.

1194
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,960
This level is pretty...

1195
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,700
What did I just summon?

1196
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,420
What did I just summon?

1197
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:35,390
What did I just summon?

1198
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:37,530
What did I just summon?

1199
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:38,950
What did I just summon?

1200
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,270
Library is pretty stylish though.

1201
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,870
It actually is very nice.

1202
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,190
Right?

1203
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,290
Okay.

1204
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,310
Nice.

1205
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:56,870
Maybe this.

1206
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,370
Actually.

1207
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,070
Pink muscles!

1208
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,390
I hate you!

1209
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:03,890
You are the pain of my existence!

1210
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:03,930
You are the pain of my existence!

1211
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:18,090
Yeah.

1212
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:18,770
Dummy.

1213
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:19,630
Bozo.

1214
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:20,710
Idiot.

1215
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,210
Stupid.

1216
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:21,690
Ugly.

1217
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,530
Meatball!

1218
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,320
I opened something.

1219
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,840
It's okay.

1220
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,300
You're allowed to bully these guys.

1221
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,880
Okay?

1222
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,240
Gosh.

1223
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,700
How do I get that thing over there?

1224
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,580
I'm so curious.

1225
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,020
Sure.

1226
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,060
Thanks for the super...

1227
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,580
Hold on.

1228
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,080
Oh wait.

1229
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,740
Maybe I open like this?

1230
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,580
Okay.

1231
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,220
Oh come on!

1232
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,400
There's something else I need to do.

1233
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,300
Oh.

1234
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,500
I think I did it.

1235
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,620
I think I did it.

1236
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,180
No!

1237
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,060
So unfair!

1238
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,200
I was right here!

1239
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,480
Will you play other boomer shooters in the future?

1240
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,000
I'd like to.

1241
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,220
Yeah.

1242
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,100
Come on!

1243
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,520
Come on!

1244
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,920
Gotta be quicker!

1245
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,400
They got the gun!

1246
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:39,540
Nice.

1247
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:39,820
Nice.

1248
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,040
We got the plasma gun.

1249
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,400
Which is good mostly to get...

1250
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,780
So this isn't a door.

1251
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,460
Interesting.

1252
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:45,840
Okay.

1253
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,160
It's good mostly to get ammo and stuff for it, right?

1254
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,120
Now where do I go from here?

1255
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,620
Did anything open up in here?

1256
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,020
You're a super Inkiller!

1257
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,540
Abnivore.

1258
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,180
Note.

1259
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,600
No Meatball Marinara subs for Minto.

1260
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,320
Mintball.

1261
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,940
Do I go out here?

1262
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,020
Let's go down, I guess.

1263
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,350
For some reason I keep thinking that's gonna open up.

1264
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,650
Guys, I think I'm lost!

1265
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,330
I think I don't know where to go.

1266
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,670
I think I'm stuck.

1267
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,370
This is where we started, right?

1268
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,730
Why did I just open?

1269
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,630
Wait, I'm stuck.

1270
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:43,490
I'm stuck.

1271
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:44,510
No.

1272
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,850
Oh, there's lots of...

1273
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:50,970
armor here.

1274
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,050
I'll take that.

1275
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,710
The map?

1276
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,790
Go right of the blue door.

1277
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:59,570
Okay, let me grab all this stuff first.

1278
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,350
Right of the blue door.

1279
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,770
Oh, what's this?

1280
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:12,740
Yippee!

1281
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,340
How do I get to the blue door?

1282
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,580
Hmm, I think I went the wrong way.

1283
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,240
What is this map?

1284
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,820
Demons have no...

1285
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,240
architectural sense at all.

1286
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,260
Over here?

1287
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,300
Oh, up here?

1288
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:27,620
Maybe?

1289
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,100
Thank you.

1290
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,160
But also, no thank you.

1291
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,380
We're just gonna blow him up.

1292
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,040
Nice.

1293
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,500
We just blew him up.

1294
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,520
I like how it gives you more shotgun shells.

1295
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,120
Because they're like, obviously you used your shotgun here.

1296
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,400
Oh gosh.

1297
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,780
It's gonna be more lost souls.

1298
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,460
Please.

1299
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
I'm saving the game.

1300
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,000
I don't trust it.

1301
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,020
I should be absolutely nothing.

1302
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,060
I knew it!

1303
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,620
I knew it!

1304
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,020
I knew it!

1305
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:33,380
I knew it!

1306
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:43,020
Where am I going?

1307
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:43,820
Wait!

1308
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,020
I'm not that way!

1309
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,620
This is so unfair.

1310
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,480
No!

1311
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:49,780
No!

1312
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,220
I'm so glad I saved.

1313
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,920
I am so glad.

1314
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,080
I saved!

1315
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,160
I am so glad I saved.

1316
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,020
Can you imagine?

1317
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,600
You just had to stand there.

1318
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,100
Oh my god.

1319
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,980
ABS always be saving.

1320
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:27,400
So true.

1321
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,080
Okay, here we go.

1322
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:39,400
Okay.

1323
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,060
Wait.

1324
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,400
Okay, I have to run through here.

1325
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:48,940
Okay.

1326
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:51,780
Let's go!

1327
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,040
Let's go!

1328
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,160
Do you think they ever just let...

1329
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,340
that arachnotron...

1330
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,540
in the cage out for walks?

1331
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,120
Or does it just stay in there all day?

1332
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,580
I think he just stays in there all day.

1333
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,840
I think nobody wants to touch him.

1334
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,100
Thank you guys!

1335
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,020
Welcome back to membership!

1336
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:11,740
Thank you!

1337
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,120
100!

1338
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:19,140
100!

1339
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:19,480
100!

1340
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,180
Let's go!

1341
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,000
Entering Watcher's Step.

1342
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,160
What do you mean by that?

1343
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,400
Was this last level...

1344
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,740
a hint at what's to come?

1345
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:40,850
Hello?

1346
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,990
Plasma gone immediately?

1347
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,750
That's a little frightening.

1348
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,590
It's worrisome.

1349
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,450
Don't you think?

1350
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:53,290
It's a little scary to think about.

1351
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,630
Why are they giving me that immediately?

1352
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,610
Upon starting...

1353
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,380
There's all types of guns here, actually.

1354
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:07,900
Okay...

1355
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,180
A berserk?

1356
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,040
I'll take it.

1357
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,820
I'll take it.

1358
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,360
There's everything!

1359
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,480
That's not a good sign.

1360
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,040
Save!

1361
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,020
Oh, thank you!

1362
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:21,980
Wait.

1363
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,280
No, no, no, no, no.

1364
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,260
Save, save, save.

1365
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,080
Yes, thank you.

1366
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,260
I think they're trying to tell you something.

1367
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,740
I think so, too.

1368
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,000
Okay...

1369
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,480
That reminds me...

1370
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,780
Aren't you also a lost soul since you're a ghost?

1371
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,840
You might fit right in with them.

1372
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,880
That might be why they're so obsessed with me.

1373
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,100
I'm probably, like, famous in this world, you know?

1374
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,360
They're like, Whoa!

1375
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,820
Phantom, the lost soul.

1376
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,320
The ghostest with the mostest.

1377
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,460
Uh-oh.

1378
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,020
I heard them.

1379
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,940
I heard them come in.

1380
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,100
I heard them...

1381
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,400
Where are you?

1382
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,760
Where are you?

1383
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:08,820
Not here?

1384
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,060
The music is, like, even more...

1385
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,140
scary.

1386
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,760
Oh, there's the exit right there!

1387
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,280
Good to know.

1388
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,220
This is their weapon museum, and they're going to be stealing all the exhibits.

1389
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,400
Maybe they're just, like...

1390
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,000
One guy is just like, I told you we should be keeping them behind...

1391
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,520
Oh, boy.

1392
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,320
We should be keeping...

1393
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,620
Why is they giving me everything?

1394
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,760
This is really scary.

1395
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,680
This is actually so bad.

1396
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,900
He's like, I told you we should be keeping them behind glass!

1397
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,560
Oh, there's a...

1398
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,100
A white berry.

1399
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:52,520
Oop.

1400
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,580
Okay, I can't fall into the red either, right?

1401
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,280
That'll be...

1402
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,560
Oh my god!

1403
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,660
Is he asleep in there, or...

1404
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,760
What's going on?

1405
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,620
Why isn't he moving?

1406
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:09,860
Hello?

1407
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:10,340
Hello?

1408
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:11,640
Ah!

1409
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,440
Wait, hold on!

1410
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,120
There's something wrong with him!

1411
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,220
Hello?

1412
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,280
Hello?

1413
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,880
I need a blue key.

1414
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,580
Oh my god.

1415
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,100
Oh,

1416
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,420
that was close.

1417
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,560
Oh, I got a blue key.

1418
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,020
Oh, gosh.

1419
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:42,360
Oh, gosh.

1420
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:42,900
There's two of them.

1421
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:43,820
Oh, gosh.

1422
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,580
There's, like, five of them.

1423
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,280
Oh, gosh.

1424
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:46,600
There's...

1425
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,180
Oh, god!

1426
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,400
There's, like, so many of them!

1427
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,120
Oh, god!

1428
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:49,900
I suck!

1429
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,860
I suck!

1430
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,200
Hello?

1431
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:07,720
For two seconds!

1432
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:11,640
Blueberry...

1433
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,700
I know this is, like, overkill, but...

1434
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,400
I know this is, like, overkill, but...

1435
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:18,780
Oh my gosh.

1436
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,360
I'm just trying to get rid of some of them.

1437
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:20,840
Oh my gosh.

1438
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:20,840
I'm just trying to get rid of some of them.

1439
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:21,860
Please.

1440
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,280
Okay.

1441
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,240
BFG?

1442
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:28,580
Wait.

1443
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:28,940
Oh.

1444
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,200
Let's go with this one instead.

1445
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:34,820
The un...

1446
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,080
Wait, hold on.

1447
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,940
Let me think about this one.

1448
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,220
I made a mistake before.

1449
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,020
There we go.

1450
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,220
Now I got them both at once.

1451
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,140
The un...

1452
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,120
Life...

1453
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:54,740
Unmaker.

1454
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:55,220
Unmaker!

1455
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,480
Hey!

1456
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,300
Where did you even come from?

1457
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:02,960
I thought I took them all out.

1458
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:03,980
Oh my goodness.

1459
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,200
Oh!

1460
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,960
Oh, goodness gracious.

1461
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,760
Is this guy awake yet?

1462
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,220
Or...

1463
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,040
We're just gonna leave him in there.

1464
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,140
I think we'll just let him have his little nap and...

1465
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,680
not even worry about it.

1466
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,860
I want all this stuff.

1467
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,140
I guess we can go inside.

1468
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,660
Yeah, he's just chillin'.

1469
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,680
What if I...

1470
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,100
This is the best option, I'd say.

1471
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,780
He has hair?

1472
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,320
What?

1473
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,400
What just spawned in?

1474
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,260
What just spawned in this time?

1475
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:00,640
Oh, okay.

1476
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,340
Just you.

1477
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,480
I can't believe he has hair!

1478
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,060
I can't believe he has hair!

1479
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,280
It's like really long, too!

1480
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:16,840
It's like really long, too!

1481
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,920
What is this decoration?

1482
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,980
It's like really long.

1483
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,300
Oh, I just realized I've been blocking my armor.

1484
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,620
Let me scoot over a little bit.

1485
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,360
Or...

1486
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:27,940
I'll go here.

1487
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,280
Sorry, it's always hard to find where to go.

1488
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,860
Bald, bald, bald!

1489
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:36,820
Ohayoumentai!

1490
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,400
Thank you!

1491
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,780
Thank you for the dough!

1492
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:40,960
No!

1493
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,620
Wait, who would win?

1494
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,000
The strongest minty ghost maid or the weakest Brazilian male with RGB knife?

1495
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,280
Well, isn't Sam the weakest Brazilian?

1496
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,100
Or something, something?

1497
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:57,460
So...

1498
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,180
Oh, hold on.

1499
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,120
Dang it, I really thought that was a door.

1500
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:09,860
Are you sure?

1501
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,300
Okay, here we go.

1502
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,240
What the?

1503
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,480
Invisible guy!

1504
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,100
Watch out!

1505
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,360
Oh, okay.

1506
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:23,840
It was all in my head.

1507
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,060
Okay.

1508
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:35,940
Cool.

1509
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,200
I imagine that.

1510
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,360
Nice.

1511
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,220
Oh!

1512
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,020
Wait, no.

1513
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:45,560
That's not what I wanted.

1514
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,220
That's not what I wanted to do.

1515
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,840
I wanna check if this is...

1516
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,140
One of these are gonna be a door.

1517
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,220
One of them has to be.

1518
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,080
Where am I now?

1519
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,520
I can't... I don't even know.

1520
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,560
Where am I at?

1521
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,160
Blue...

1522
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:04,420
Blue armor!

1523
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,480
Not blueberry.

1524
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,740
Take your meds, minto.

1525
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,640
I'm trying.

1526
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,020
Oh, lost souls!

1527
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:15,560
I'm

1528
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:21,440
trying.

1529
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:21,440
Oh, lost souls!

1530
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,600
They're all doors.

1531
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,440
They're just locked.

1532
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,850
Do we hear anything else?

1533
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,430
Now how?

1534
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:35,530
Does this open anything else?

1535
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,070
Or...

1536
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,550
Doesn't sound like it.

1537
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,490
Where do I go from here?

1538
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:45,550
Where do I go from here?

1539
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,830
So many voices.

1540
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,870
Whispering We're in wire.

1541
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:55,390
Which is the...

1542
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:56,910
Sorry.

1543
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,290
That's from Pocahontas 2.

1544
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:02,750
Which is like the most insulting movie I think I've ever seen in my entire life.

1545
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:05,870
Where...

1546
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:07,090
Actually though, where do I go?

1547
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:09,370
I think I messed up the order.

1548
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,210
Okay, hold on.

1549
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,090
There was some place...

1550
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:20,830
Okay, so we know that this one goes down and then it goes back up.

1551
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:23,750
And then we...

1552
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,750
I don't even know where I'm at here though.

1553
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:27,150
Oh, dang it.

1554
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:27,970
Come on, let me up.

1555
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,110
Uppies!

1556
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:29,990
Thank you.

1557
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,410
Where am I?

1558
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:36,550
Who?

1559
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,590
Oh, come on.

1560
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,390
There's a sequel?

1561
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:42,070
Oh yes.

1562
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:45,030
There's a sequel and it's all about...

1563
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:47,950
Okay, so you know how like the actual history of Pocahontas...

1564
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,990
Okay, well it's actually... I mean the actual history.

1565
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:51,910
is like pretty dark.

1566
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:52,830
But I mean like...

1567
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,070
I don't think she ever... like John Smith was not...

1568
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,070
who she married.

1569
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,370
It was like some other guy.

1570
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,010
And so in Pocahontas 2...

1571
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:08,450
In Pocahontas 2 basically they were like, maybe we should be more historically accurate.

1572
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:09,590
And they...

1573
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,410
They kill off... sorry for spoilers.

1574
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,810
They kill off John Smith, but not really.

1575
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,630
And then they get her...

1576
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:19,370
married to that guy that she...

1577
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:19,790
Oh.

1578
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,770
Oh, dang.

1579
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:25,770
To the guy that was the real guy in history.

1580
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,750
I'm actually so lost.

1581
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:30,930
If anybody at back theaters know what to do...

1582
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:31,950
I don't know what to do.

1583
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,110
But then he wasn't dead and he comes back and he's just like...

1584
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,450
You know what?

1585
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,010
What is that?

1586
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:43,970
He's like, you know what?

1587
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:44,570
It's fine.

1588
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:46,630
You can go be with that new guy.

1589
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,130
That's just very awful.

1590
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,090
It's like they almost...

1591
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:55,690
It's like...

1592
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:58,610
We do this every time.

1593
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,370
Does something go up here?

1594
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:02,130
What am I missing?

1595
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,350
Historical NTR.

1596
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,550
Kind of.

1597
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,530
Confusingly, she marries a guy named John Rolfe.

1598
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,950
And not the guy named... Yes!

1599
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:16,210
Yes!

1600
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:16,470
Yes!

1601
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,610
Yes!

1602
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,350
John Rolfe!

1603
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:20,750
Check the map.

1604
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:23,270
Wait.

1605
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:23,790
Q.

1606
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,410
I guess there's nothing else here.

1607
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,170
Unless I want to get the...

1608
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:34,910
The...

1609
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:36,650
This stuff.

1610
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:39,770
Unless I want to get the health bonuses, I guess.

1611
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,890
Okay, let's go back to the beginning.

1612
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:45,830
Let's go back outside.

1613
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:48,390
There's probably like a whole army waiting for me.

1614
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,510
Like how do I get in there?

1615
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:54,690
But yeah.

1616
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:55,950
It's just like...

1617
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,110
Such a mess.

1618
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,650
It's just such a mess.

1619
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:02,850
Pocahontas too.

1620
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:07,610
It's a bunch of losers!

1621
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,770
It's a bunch of tiny demons!

1622
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,810
Wait.

1623
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:12,550
Uh oh.

1624
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,810
They're cycling through.

1625
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:14,810
I'm noticing.

1626
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,330
They're going through like the easiest to the hardest.

1627
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:20,990
Oh my god!

1628
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:21,430
Oh my god!

1629
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:21,870
I knew it!

1630
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:22,170
I knew it!

1631
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:22,430
I knew it!

1632
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,770
I knew it!

1633
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,830
Why did you spawn on top of me though?

1634
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:26,970
You jerk!

1635
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,430
Next should be...

1636
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:30,170
Oh.

1637
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,630
Okay.

1638
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,670
Why aren't you guys infighting?

1639
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,810
He hit you in the back.

1640
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:43,030
I need to be careful not to get trapped on the things here.

1641
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:46,850
Oh my goodness.

1642
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,050
Oh my goodness.

1643
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,550
Oh my goodness.

1644
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:50,510
Oh my goodness.

1645
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:52,350
Oh my goodness.

1646
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:53,310
Oh my goodness.

1647
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:00,090
I don't want to waste all my...

1648
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:00,450
Oh.

1649
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:02,770
Wow.

1650
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:03,170
That was fast.

1651
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:11,970
Now I should be able to get him.

1652
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:13,190
Nope.

1653
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:16,310
Who's next?

1654
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:17,990
Who's next?

1655
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,090
Oh gosh.

1656
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:18,710
Oh gosh.

1657
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,090
Oh gosh.

1658
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:19,410
Oh gosh.

1659
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,010
Oh gosh.

1660
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,270
Oh gosh.

1661
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:20,550
Oh gosh.

1662
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:20,890
Oh gosh.

1663
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:21,390
Oh god.

1664
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:22,330
Oh god.

1665
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:23,150
Oh god.

1666
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:23,410
Oh god.

1667
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:23,790
Oh god.

1668
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:24,590
Oh god.

1669
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:24,870
Oh god.

1670
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:25,390
Five!

1671
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,120
Oh!

1672
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:36,760
Oh shoot.

1673
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:37,340
Oh god.

1674
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:37,720
Oh god.

1675
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,200
Oh god.

1676
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:38,560
Oh god.

1677
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,840
Oh god.

1678
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,120
Oh god.

1679
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:40,240
Oh god.

1680
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:41,780
Oh my.

1681
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,680
Oh my.

1682
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,020
Oh my.

1683
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:43,580
Oh my.

1684
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:43,760
Oh my.

1685
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,400
No!

1686
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,100
Oh my goodness.

1687
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,420
Oh my god, there's a second one.

1688
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,260
Instant karma!

1689
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:58,980
What are you talking about?

1690
01:18:59,040 --> 01:18:59,240
Karma!

1691
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,300
How is it karma?

1692
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,380
What did I do?

1693
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:06,740
Okay, nice.

1694
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,260
Okay, nice.

1695
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,940
They actually don't take that many hits.

1696
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,160
Which is great.

1697
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,540
Can I get another blueberry?

1698
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,520
I got a stem pack.

1699
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,740
Oh my god!

1700
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:22,560
Oh no!

1701
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,300
It's this guy!

1702
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,540
Which is the BFG?

1703
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,640
BFG!

1704
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,270
The Cyber Demon!

1705
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:40,870
Yes!

1706
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,130
The Cyber Demon!

1707
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:43,650
Guys, I died.

1708
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,840
Where did I save last?

1709
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,200
Oh!

1710
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:52,520
No!

1711
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:52,800
No!

1712
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,080
No!

1713
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:53,360
No!

1714
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,720
No!

1715
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,220
No!

1716
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:54,660
No!

1717
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:54,980
No!

1718
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:55,280
No!

1719
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:55,400
No!

1720
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:55,560
No!

1721
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,240
Oh no!

1722
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,640
I'm really far behind.

1723
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,520
Oh gosh!

1724
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:04,580
Oh no!

1725
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,420
Oh no!

1726
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,720
Oh no!

1727
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,900
I really messed up, you guys.

1728
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Have you ever tried avoiding the rockets?

1729
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,180
That's a really good idea.

1730
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,580
Let's see.

1731
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,240
Maybe if we just rocket punch through everything.

1732
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,260
Oh, we don't need to rocket punch through these guys.

1733
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:32,320
Oh!

1734
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,120
Oh!

1735
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,460
Like this guy could use a rocket punch.

1736
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,580
Where's the other guy?

1737
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,160
Here, you... Oh no!

1738
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:42,980
There's some loss.

1739
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,220
Oh, they're infighting!

1740
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:44,920
Yeah!

1741
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:45,700
Take care of them!

1742
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,480
Yeah!

1743
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:47,320
Those guys suck!

1744
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,020
Wait!

1745
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:48,300
No!

1746
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:48,440
No!

1747
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:48,540
No!

1748
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:48,640
No!

1749
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:48,720
No!

1750
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,760
Take care of them for me, please!

1751
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:57,940
Oh, that opens up a whole new can of everything.

1752
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,480
Oh!

1753
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,500
I don't know where I'm aiming, but...

1754
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,040
Why did I do that?

1755
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:09,960
Why did I...

1756
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,060
I'm just gonna restart.

1757
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,780
Why did I do that?

1758
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,760
Why did I do that?

1759
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,920
Why did I think that that wouldn't work?

1760
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,600
Oh, goodness.

1761
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:34,400
Okay, this is a bit of a... Okay, this is probably the most trouble I've had in this so far.

1762
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,120
Which is fine, because so far it hasn't been so bad.

1763
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,420
I mean, I know I'm playing on like, you know, not super hard, but whatever.

1764
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,420
It's fine.

1765
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:47,620
Why am I... Oh, am I okay?

1766
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,540
Look at them just phasing into existence.

1767
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:57,740
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1768
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1769
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,780
Calm down, buddy.

1770
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,610
Can I touch the red?

1771
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,490
Or will I die?

1772
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,790
Why don't you infight?

1773
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,070
Go after him!

1774
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:15,530
He hit you!

1775
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,250
It's rude as hell.

1776
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,210
Okay.

1777
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:25,710
Let's kill everything.

1778
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,330
Before we grab the key.

1779
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:34,530
I'm hearing...

1780
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,380
Try walking on the red.

1781
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,800
Oh, I think we're safe.

1782
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:47,400
Okay, cool.

1783
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,420
Oh, whoa.

1784
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,120
Where did you come from?

1785
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,300
I didn't even get the key yet!

1786
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,700
I didn't even get the key yet!

1787
01:22:59,160 --> 01:22:59,520
Please.

1788
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,380
Oh my god.

1789
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:01,760
Oh my god.

1790
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,260
Oh my god.

1791
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:02,480
Ah!

1792
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,000
Ah!

1793
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:07,880
Cass?

1794
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:08,360
This is not good.

1795
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,200
This is not good.

1796
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:09,940
This is not good.

1797
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:11,420
This is not good.

1798
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:11,960
This is not good.

1799
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,780
This is not good!

1800
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:24,960
Oh my god.

1801
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:25,560
Oh my god.

1802
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,220
I'm gonna die here, for real.

1803
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,320
I'm gonna die here for real!

1804
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,360
Screw you!

1805
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,680
Yeah, I used the BFG for this bit.

1806
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,400
Oh my gosh!

1807
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,600
I just can't get through!

1808
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,900
It's such a tight area!

1809
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,200
And the splash damage on the rocket!

1810
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,360
Kids... heckin' me!

1811
01:23:52,940 --> 01:24:00,160
...only come out once I... once I got the key, which clearly not.

1812
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,700
Okay, here we go.

1813
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,780
Yeah, screw you!

1814
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,220
Ugly.

1815
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,780
Got them both, nice.

1816
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,860
Oh my god, he was waiting!

1817
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:18,420
He was waiting for that!

1818
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:21,400
He's waited his whole life to send the...

1819
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,630
Nice-o!

1820
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,010
Oh, that was close.

1821
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,690
Oh my god, stop!

1822
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,330
Stop it!

1823
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:41,970
Are you kidding me?

1824
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,970
That was... pretty unfair, actually.

1825
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,850
I'm not gonna...

1826
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:47,390
I am stuck!

1827
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,550
How tall am I?!

1828
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,130
I'm either two feet or five!

1829
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:55,530
Give me... give me a break!

1830
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,590
Oh my god...

1831
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:10,520
You got the BFG 9000, oh yes!

1832
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,900
If only I weren't so dang slow...

1833
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:29,900
Oh, they're fighting?

1834
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,860
The boys are fighting?

1835
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,060
The girls are fighting?

1836
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:33,760
The girls are fighting?

1837
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,880
Just let them at it.

1838
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,480
Oh, uh oh, I ruined their fight.

1839
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,720
Oh my gosh, I didn't even see that coming at me.

1840
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,020
Guys, I'm not doing so hot.

1841
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,360
What's wrong with me?

1842
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,840
I've been playing fine this whole time and then suddenly...

1843
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,380
Suddenly my brain goes to doo-doo.

1844
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,860
What's happening to me?

1845
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,740
What's happening to me?

1846
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,180
I need more gamer subs.

1847
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,380
Stop.

1848
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:28,410
I can't tell if there's anything still here.

1849
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:29,590
There has to be.

1850
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:33,030
Oh, a hero.

1851
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:38,430
Of all things, it's an invisible pinky.

1852
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:42,890
Yeah, let's save.

1853
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:45,770
But I will save... next thing.

1854
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:46,470
Yeah.

1855
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,290
Okay.

1856
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:47,970
Okay.

1857
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:51,770
Oh, wait.

1858
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:53,330
There's some more left.

1859
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:54,590
Where are they though?

1860
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,510
Where are you?

1861
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:58,930
Oh, there you are.

1862
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,450
Oh my gosh, there's more.

1863
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:02,050
Even more.

1864
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,270
Oh my gosh.

1865
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:12,110
Oh my gosh, there's even more.

1866
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:17,050
Where did they all come from?

1867
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,030
What the heck is going on?

1868
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:25,530
They're just spawning.

1869
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,410
In mid-air.

1870
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:31,690
Okay.

1871
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:32,170
Now...

1872
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,590
Now I think we're in the clear.

1873
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:36,650
Okay, let's save again.

1874
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:39,370
Yes.

1875
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,850
They're no match for you anyway.

1876
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:43,090
I'm the Doom.

1877
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:45,510
The mint guy.

1878
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:48,190
Okay.

1879
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:49,910
Let's go shoot...

1880
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:51,930
this thing in here.

1881
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:54,550
Look at his hair when he turns around.

1882
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:58,150
Oh my god.

1883
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,080
Unbelievably rude.

1884
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,140
Unbelievably rude.

1885
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,420
Oh my god.

1886
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,700
What the hell?

1887
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,540
Why didn't you die when I shot you?

1888
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:24,020
I'm Facebook friends with the artist who did the sprites and animations for Doom 2 and 64.

1889
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:24,680
Wow.

1890
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,540
He said his goal was to improve the sprites and animations.

1891
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,600
He used claymation.

1892
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,920
That's so cool.

1893
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,560
World's strongest imp.

1894
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,500
Clearly.

1895
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,780
Oh my god.

1896
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:42,840
What?

1897
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,880
An absolute...

1898
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,520
What is this buffoonery?

1899
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,560
I just cannot.

1900
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,380
Okay.

1901
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,320
They're all gone.

1902
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,600
They're all gone.

1903
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,660
They're all gone.

1904
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,580
Okay.

1905
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,340
I come here.

1906
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:12,020
And then some guy is going to spawn over here.

1907
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,440
Wait.

1908
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,080
Hello?

1909
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,360
Doom guy.

1910
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,660
Why couldn't you...

1911
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,960
He's right in front of you.

1912
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,360
Hahaha.

1913
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,030
Hahaha.

1914
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,290
Okay.

1915
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:32,550
That's actually how I truly feel right now in this moment.

1916
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,050
It's like what I actually want to do to them.

1917
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,910
I just want to punch him in the face.

1918
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:39,250
Is there any more?

1919
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:40,630
Is that it?

1920
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:42,750
Can we get it out of our system?

1921
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:47,530
Goodness gracious.

1922
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,550
This way.

1923
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:55,130
Oh!

1924
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:55,490
Ah!

1925
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:55,870
Ah!

1926
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:02,990
I lost so much health from...

1927
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,170
I was at a hundred.

1928
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:06,570
And that one...

1929
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:08,410
Oh my goodness.

1930
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:08,830
Oh.

1931
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:13,610
That one shot from that...

1932
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:15,270
Heckin grunt...

1933
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:15,870
Grunt...

1934
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:19,070
Made me lose so much.

1935
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:20,470
Hello?

1936
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,330
Where are you?

1937
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:25,630
Hello?

1938
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:27,170
Hello?

1939
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:30,770
Okay.

1940
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:34,390
Well there's health and stuff we can grab in here.

1941
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:37,690
So we'll at least do that.

1942
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:38,810
How do I...

1943
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:38,870
Oh.

1944
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:39,410
Here.

1945
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:41,610
That's how we get up.

1946
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:42,670
I'm going to grab the health.

1947
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:46,350
And then we'll...

1948
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:47,430
Like...

1949
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:48,070
It's...

1950
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,630
Here.

1951
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:49,570
Yeah.

1952
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:50,710
Grab this.

1953
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,570
Shotgun guys are so deadly.

1954
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,810
I know.

1955
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,150
I lose so much health to them.

1956
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:57,950
We lost to them all the time.

1957
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,270
We'll go to...

1958
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:05,030
I'm lost.

1959
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:10,510
So we went to this one.

1960
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:13,070
We're going to go to this one?

1961
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:17,590
Most of the BFG damage comes from a shotgun like spray of tracers coming from the player.

1962
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,890
Ooh...

1963
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,190
Really?

1964
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,090
Oh, dangit.

1965
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:26,790
Dangit.

1966
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:28,500
That, that's a no.

1967
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,300
Oh, I'm at max armor anyway.

1968
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:32,960
You know what?

1969
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:33,580
I think it's fine.

1970
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:35,600
I think it's fine.

1971
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:38,540
Sorry, I'm gonna be save scumming here a little bit.

1972
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,560
The BFG tracers only fire when the projectile hits something.

1973
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,040
So they need to be in sight.

1974
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,100
That's so inconvenient.

1975
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,520
So first we got our little guys.

1976
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,980
Did I... did I take a hit?

1977
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,200
I can't tell if I did or not.

1978
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,520
We're about to get to a cyber demon.

1979
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,960
Our first cyber demon, baby!

1980
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,800
Oh, imps!

1981
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,240
Imps!

1982
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:13,920
Imps!

1983
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,020
Wait, there's still a pinky!

1984
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,480
Okay.

1985
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:25,810
Yeah, take that!

1986
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:27,570
Take that!

1987
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,770
Take... oh, aim, don't go.

1988
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:31,050
Take... oh, aim.

1989
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,010
Oh my god.

1990
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,790
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

1991
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:41,390
I don't know about you!

1992
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,170
Now I'm feeling so good.

1993
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,950
Do I even have time to BFG them?

1994
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:09,870
I'm just running!

1995
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:11,790
Oh my gosh.

1996
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:13,410
Oh.

1997
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:16,550
I think... I think I got him.

1998
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,050
I think I got him!

1999
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:20,830
But...

2000
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:24,870
I'm... I don't even know!

2001
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:26,510
There we go!

2002
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:27,110
Nice!

2003
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:28,870
Just... run and shoot!

2004
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:31,410
Run and shoot!

2005
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:34,130
That's all I can do!

2006
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,670
Wowee!

2007
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:39,210
Wah!

2008
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:39,250
Wah!

2009
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:41,350
Cyberdemon?

2010
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,400
Where'd he go?

2011
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:48,760
Where is he?

2012
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:01,620
Oh my god!

2013
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,040
Oh my god!

2014
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:02,320
Oh my god!

2015
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:02,560
Oh my god!

2016
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,840
I've had two health in a dream!

2017
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,020
I'm not gonna make it, you guys!

2018
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:11,780
Oh my god.

2019
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,160
Oh my god.

2020
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:12,400
Oh my god.

2021
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:12,620
Oh my god.

2022
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,000
I'm not gonna make it!

2023
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,360
Where's the health?

2024
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:17,960
Stimps!

2025
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,320
Stimps!

2026
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,660
Where's the simp packs?

2027
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:21,520
Stimps!

2028
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,580
Use the unbirther?

2029
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,660
I'm sorry.

2030
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,160
Unmaker?

2031
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,320
Oh my god.

2032
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:28,860
Oooh!

2033
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,280
Jukes!

2034
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,040
Jukes like we've never seen them before!

2035
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:45,370
If I make it out of this...

2036
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:45,710
I'll...

2037
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:55,640
I got an achievement!

2038
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,980
Kill a Cyberdemon!

2039
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:01,370
I got an achievement!

2040
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:01,370
Kill a Cyberdemon!

2041
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,240
2HP in a dream, everybody!

2042
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,480
The dream is real.

2043
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,120
Maybe.

2044
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:15,820
Let's go!

2045
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,400
Thank you for the super chat.

2046
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:17,940
Thank you.

2047
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,380
Oh, it's open!

2048
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:20,540
Wait...

2049
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,340
If I walk in here, am I gonna die?

2050
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,820
Greg does have one regret regarding Doom 64.

2051
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,980
The Cyberdemons' horns look like dog ears.

2052
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,760
They did look kinda cute.

2053
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,140
It saved, right?

2054
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,360
Just in case.

2055
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:43,740
Okay.

2056
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,580
Exit.

2057
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:59,320
Wait, but what was the other spot?

2058
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,540
Wait a second.

2059
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,340
Hold on.

2060
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,380
Hold on.

2061
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,840
One moment, please.

2062
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,380
I wanna see what was in the other area.

2063
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:20,200
How do I get to the blueberry?

2064
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,340
How do I get to this blueberry, then?

2065
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,670
It's clearly through here.

2066
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,630
Or the whiteberry, yeah.

2067
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,130
The pearl.

2068
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:37,350
How do I get this thing?

2069
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:39,710
Just jump.

2070
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:41,770
In math, let's see.

2071
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:48,050
Yeah, it's behind that door, but I don't know how to open it.

2072
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:54,270
Also, that... well...

2073
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:55,910
I'm curious.

2074
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:57,970
Very curious.

2075
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:59,470
Rocket the door.

2076
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:04,050
Yes.

2077
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:10,630
I'll punch it.

2078
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,740
Is it working?

2079
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,240
What does it give me, anyway?

2080
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,340
Does it give me health?

2081
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,040
Is that a lost cause at this point?

2082
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,260
Actually, it's a good thing we came back in here.

2083
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,040
There is some health!

2084
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,660
Wait, there's some health packs, you guys.

2085
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:52,960
Wait, this actually might be good before we go to the next level, because...

2086
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,280
Otherwise, I'm doomed.

2087
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,220
Wait, get me up.

2088
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:00,960
No!

2089
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,820
How do I get up?

2090
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:04,140
How do I get up?

2091
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,400
Oh, I think I have to run from here.

2092
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,120
Hmm...

2093
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:17,640
Hmm...

2094
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:19,700
Interesting.

2095
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:19,920
Interesting.

2096
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,800
I thought the yellow one was invincibility.

2097
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,840
Oh, it might be.

2098
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,940
Gosh, I would have really loved to have that.

2099
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,440
How do I get the thing?

2100
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,010
I mean, don't waste it.

2101
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:46,230
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

2102
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:48,350
Let's grab the armor.

2103
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:49,810
Or not.

2104
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:52,290
Wait, where am I?

2105
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:52,770
Okay.

2106
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:56,050
Stop, please.

2107
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:57,710
It's so sensitive.

2108
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:00,790
Nice.

2109
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:02,090
Okay, got some armor.

2110
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:06,230
Invulnerability is green.

2111
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:10,910
So, you guys were all wrong.

2112
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:13,630
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

2113
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,530
Okay, now there's that one, which is health.

2114
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:17,150
Which I desperately need.

2115
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:18,250
I know I'm like...

2116
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:19,170
I could leave.

2117
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:20,690
I could just go to the next thing.

2118
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:23,570
But I just am so desperate for health right now.

2119
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:27,610
I'm so desperate for health right now.

2120
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:29,370
Okay.

2121
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:31,710
Oh, come on, please.

2122
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,550
It's right there.

2123
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:34,130
Just grab it.

2124
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:35,610
Grab it, Doomguy.

2125
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:36,330
Grab it.

2126
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:39,450
And you too.

2127
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:42,350
Why won't you let me have you?

2128
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:45,650
How do I get to this?

2129
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:47,650
So...

2130
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:49,550
You know what?

2131
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:49,990
Screw it.

2132
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:50,570
Let's just go.

2133
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,700
I'm done.

2134
01:39:58,920 --> 01:39:59,520
Oh, wait.

2135
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,900
I just went the long way.

2136
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:01,640
But...

2137
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,340
It's fine.

2138
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:06,460
Help!

2139
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,800
I need the synth packs.

2140
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:19,460
Spawned fear.

2141
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,280
I'm...

2142
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,520
I'm very fearful.

2143
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:29,260
The first couple of levels were like a walk in the park.

2144
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,440
And now suddenly...

2145
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:34,240
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

2146
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,400
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

2147
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,160
Oh, shoot.

2148
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:50,810
Since when?

2149
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,910
What hands do you have?

2150
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,010
Mr. Skull?

2151
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:01,410
This

2152
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:10,700
is...

2153
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:11,260
Oh my goodness.

2154
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:11,640
Oh my goodness.

2155
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,080
I just slid down the door.

2156
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,680
I don't even...

2157
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,100
Oh, hello.

2158
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,620
I didn't mean to.

2159
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,380
I can't take a single hit, you guys.

2160
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,680
Or else I'm so done.

2161
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,080
Oh, there's a health pack right there.

2162
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:32,420
Give it...

2163
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,500
Who's yelling?

2164
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:35,080
Ah!

2165
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:35,540
Ah!

2166
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,420
Ah!

2167
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:36,860
Ah!

2168
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:37,740
Oh!

2169
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,240
Such a lust for revenge!

2170
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:41,920
Oh!

2171
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:43,320
Wait.

2172
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,300
Actually, who...

2173
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,700
Where did that shot come from?

2174
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,020
Is that a guy in there?

2175
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:50,780
No, that's a flame.

2176
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:05,960
Hidden wall?

2177
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:09,480
Oh!

2178
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:10,600
Oh!

2179
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:11,340
Oh!

2180
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,340
Oh my gosh.

2181
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:15,080
I caught a blueberry.

2182
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,340
Oh my gosh.

2183
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:18,940
Wait.

2184
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:19,660
We got a blueberry.

2185
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,820
Oh my gosh.

2186
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,700
We got a blueberry.

2187
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:24,380
Okay.

2188
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,320
I can save the game now.

2189
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,760
I can go over.

2190
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,500
Fake wall.

2191
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,060
Oh, fake wall, my beloved.

2192
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:36,440
That's the exit right there.

2193
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,360
Okay.

2194
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:40,780
I'm full.

2195
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,320
Let's go down here.

2196
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:48,200
Is this a door?

2197
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:48,780
No.

2198
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:49,940
No.

2199
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:50,420
Okay.

2200
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:55,440
Are those gonna yell at me?

2201
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,520
Are those gonna shoot at me?

2202
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,280
Oh.

2203
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:00,060
Dang.

2204
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:01,500
I got a secret area, though.

2205
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:06,280
I guess I'll, um, remember that for when we need more.

2206
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:11,360
More syntax.

2207
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:14,840
What is in there?

2208
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,220
Oh.

2209
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,640
Just a decoration.

2210
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:19,640
Gosh.

2211
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,180
There are...

2212
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:21,920
Oh.

2213
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,020
Oh.

2214
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:22,040
Oh.

2215
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:22,480
Oh.

2216
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,180
There are, uh, decoration...

2217
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:25,900
Design...

2218
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,320
Interior design is so unique!

2219
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,860
I hate the shotgun.

2220
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,680
I hate the...

2221
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:48,600
Blueberry...

2222
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,440
Just walk

2223
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:01,200
in the goo, you show-off.

2224
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,700
Just walk in the goo, you show-off.

2225
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:04,340
Oh.

2226
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:19,010
Oh, the goo is gone!

2227
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:21,790
What a strange room.

2228
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:30,510
Need a red key.

2229
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:42,990
I'm gonna change to this.

2230
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:47,330
Hmm.

2231
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:47,830
Hmm.

2232
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:48,850
Okay.

2233
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:51,350
Hmm-hm.

2234
01:44:56,070 --> 01:44:56,990
Curious.

2235
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:02,730
M'kay.

2236
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:10,950
Phew.

2237
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:13,050
Thank you very much.

2238
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:16,590
I hate lost souls.

2239
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:20,830
Actually, I think they are truly my least favorite.

2240
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:21,910
Okay.

2241
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:25,170
Are these... oh wait, this one.

2242
01:45:26,490 --> 01:45:28,370
Oh, I thought those were things we could shoot.

2243
01:45:31,090 --> 01:45:31,750
Oh, hello.

2244
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:32,970
Whoa, wait.

2245
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,190
Wow,

2246
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:41,950
I like this room.

2247
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:43,410
Oh, um...

2248
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:45,910
Okay?

2249
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:47,590
Uh...

2250
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:50,490
Huh... huh...

2251
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:51,070
Hmm...

2252
01:45:58,370 --> 01:45:58,810
Hmm...

2253
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,670
I thought that maybe this would trigger it.

2254
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:03,270
Try when you're on a step.

2255
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:03,590
Oh!

2256
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,300
Go, go, go, go.

2257
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:14,920
Yay!

2258
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:15,980
Thank you!

2259
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:20,300
What was I gonna say?

2260
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,320
I knew there was something important about that step.

2261
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:26,840
More than just being a little step stool.

2262
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:31,120
Wait, can we also shoot the other ones then?

2263
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,260
No.

2264
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,120
These ones are boring and don't matter.

2265
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,240
Sharp shooter.

2266
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,400
Don't you know it.

2267
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:49,420
I'm being really paranoid right now because of any loss.

2268
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,420
Oh!

2269
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,160
Oh, it's so good to be paranoid!

2270
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,500
I love being paranoid!

2271
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,880
This is why we're paranoid, everybody.

2272
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:05,040
Has Ben played Doom at 16 slash Eternal?

2273
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:05,740
I have not!

2274
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,480
Not yet.

2275
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,130
Yellow key.

2276
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:16,890
Have I even gone down here?

2277
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:19,870
I have not.

2278
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,490
I saw one in there.

2279
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:30,950
One more.

2280
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,750
Oh, two more!

2281
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,330
I love the way they mumble.

2282
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:42,070
That!

2283
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,130
Yeah!

2284
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:44,530
Yeah!

2285
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:44,710
Yeah!

2286
01:47:57,970 --> 01:47:58,730
Gremlin noises.

2287
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:00,710
Oh!

2288
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:01,870
Oh!

2289
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:03,250
Wow!

2290
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:04,190
That's a lot of them.

2291
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:07,290
Oh my god!

2292
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:07,710
Oh my god!

2293
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:08,070
Oh my god!

2294
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:08,670
Oh my god!

2295
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:10,190
I'm not about to die here.

2296
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:17,980
Wait, are these the stronger guys?

2297
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,700
I guess they're the stronger guys.

2298
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,760
Because they're still not dead.

2299
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:22,320
There we go.

2300
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:24,160
Holy

2301
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:28,690
cannoli!

2302
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:32,410
Pack pack!

2303
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:39,090
Take that.

2304
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,850
Cannolis are tasty.

2305
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:43,930
Indeed they are.

2306
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:46,070
Was that everything here?

2307
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:48,830
Hmm...

2308
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:52,070
Wait, this is the spot that...

2309
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:52,250
Yeah.

2310
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:53,390
Okay.

2311
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:55,210
Let's go down.

2312
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:59,090
Let's go into this room!

2313
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:18,720
Oh...

2314
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:24,240
He was waiting.

2315
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:26,000
He was camping me right there.

2316
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:27,540
...

2317
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:30,380
...

2318
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,280
It's so hard to see the guys in here.

2319
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,900
I think I got all of them.

2320
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,120
For real.

2321
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,680
I hate this game.

2322
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,380
I hate this game!

2323
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,160
I hate this game so...

2324
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:46,580
...

2325
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:47,660
...so...

2326
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,320
...much.

2327
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:53,420
I hate this game.

2328
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:54,540
Oh my god.

2329
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,320
Skill issue!

2330
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,200
Skill issue!

2331
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,300
Go go!

2332
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,700
Oh... no no.

2333
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:10,400
I said go go, but I didn't think it would be like this.

2334
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,640
Oh no!

2335
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,680
I can't see anything.

2336
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,460
I got a health pack though.

2337
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,540
I could see that at least.

2338
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:16,860
Uh oh.

2339
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:20,120
As soon as I turn on this light, it's gonna be hell on earth.

2340
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,020
Huh.

2341
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:22,380
I mean it's already...

2342
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:23,720
It's already hell.

2343
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:25,820
Oh.

2344
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:27,300
Maybe not?

2345
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:29,100
Yes.

2346
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:29,560
Maybe yes.

2347
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:35,920
If you really want to prove you're Boomer Minto bona fides, then try playing Blood next if you dare.

2348
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:38,880
I think...

2349
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,100
I have not proved myself.

2350
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:41,900
...

2351
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:43,880
What?

2352
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,020
Who am I trying to prove to anyway?

2353
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:46,480
Huh?

2354
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,000
Huh?

2355
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:52,420
You must prove yourself to be...

2356
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:53,800
Oh my gosh.

2357
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,800
I see him up there.

2358
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,520
With his long, luscious hair.

2359
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,140
Are you gonna come down?

2360
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:01,700
You coward!

2361
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:05,580
What the hell?

2362
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:07,600
What took you so long?

2363
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:09,260
Oh my god.

2364
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,320
I just ran right into that.

2365
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:13,780
...

2366
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:20,470
Oh please.

2367
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,190
Oh my god.

2368
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:21,750
Ouchie ouch.

2369
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:23,530
Ouchie ouch ouch ouch.

2370
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:24,050
...

2371
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:28,130
I'm stuck on the stairs.

2372
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:29,050
...

2373
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:30,390
Oh my gosh.

2374
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:31,650
Oh the stairs saved me!

2375
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:33,110
...

2376
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:36,410
10 HP in a dream.

2377
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:37,790
...

2378
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:39,930
I feel like I'm not gonna make it, you guys.

2379
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:40,830
...

2380
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:47,650
I almost even fell into the pits of...

2381
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:48,030
...

2382
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:57,930
35 HP.

2383
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:59,210
That's not as bad.

2384
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,010
But, you know.

2385
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:01,290
...

2386
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,860
How much of... how much...

2387
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:23,700
Oh, 500?

2388
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:24,680
That's not so bad.

2389
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:26,040
You can do it.

2390
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,720
You really think so?

2391
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:28,680
...

2392
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:31,080
You really think so?

2393
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,300
...

2394
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,100
You really, really, really think so?

2395
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:38,120
My armor's at 7.

2396
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:39,420
...

2397
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,200
...

2398
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,480
Secret.

2399
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:46,680
...

2400
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,160
...

2401
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:49,360
...

2402
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:51,220
Oh!

2403
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:52,980
I don't have to go back through the...

2404
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:53,580
...main area!

2405
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:55,760
Maybe this game is sometimes really nice.

2406
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:58,780
Well, it really is an exaggeration.

2407
01:52:58,920 --> 01:52:59,240
...

2408
01:52:59,240 --> 01:52:59,460
...

2409
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,380
This game is... kind.

2410
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:10,140
This game has its...

2411
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:11,940
...kind moments.

2412
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,860
That's a better way to put it.

2413
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:15,660
Now...

2414
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:17,140
Wait.

2415
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,020
You need a yellow key.

2416
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,520
Oh, I just grabbed a red key.

2417
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,380
I thought I grabbed the yellow key.

2418
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:27,260
Wait, where was the red area?

2419
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:36,700
Wait, where was the red area?

2420
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,240
Through here?

2421
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:42,420
It was?

2422
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:43,900
I've got to save it.

2423
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:44,860
Sorry.

2424
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:45,740
Save's coming.

2425
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:46,960
A little bit.

2426
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,080
Okay.

2427
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:53,660
Say what?

2428
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,140
What the?

2429
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,180
What did I just hear?

2430
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:04,120
Just heard someone.

2431
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:06,360
Oh, hero.

2432
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:14,860
Oh my

2433
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:24,340
god.

2434
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,400
Wait, I'm trapped in a corner.

2435
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:26,000
Wait!

2436
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:26,800
I'm trapped in a corner!

2437
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,340
Please!

2438
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:27,920
Please!

2439
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,000
It was me.

2440
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:37,730
That didn't even mean...

2441
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:39,090
I meant to press not R8.

2442
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:40,750
Okay, load.

2443
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:43,030
I love save's coming.

2444
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:50,580
Dead end, literally.

2445
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:52,640
There we go.

2446
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,180
We'll be prepared.

2447
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:07,790
Is it overkill?

2448
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:08,990
I don't think so.

2449
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:10,390
I just died.

2450
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:11,070
So, you know.

2451
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,270
Lampy, welcome.

2452
01:55:17,650 --> 01:55:18,770
Thank you.

2453
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,640
Thank you.

2454
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,140
Very much.

2455
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,800
I have lots of ammo.

2456
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,540
And they give me more right here.

2457
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:33,600
Yeah.

2458
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:34,640
Yeah.

2459
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:34,880
Yeah.

2460
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,340
Yeah.

2461
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:43,920
Oh!

2462
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,840
Wait a second.

2463
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,260
Do you see that?

2464
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:49,700
Interesting.

2465
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:56,380
Wow.

2466
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,820
What a really cool room.

2467
01:55:59,320 --> 01:55:59,660
Oh!

2468
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,690
Excuse me.

2469
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:11,810
Can I get this armor, please?

2470
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:13,290
Can everybody leave me alone?

2471
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:17,330
Thank you.

2472
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:18,350
Thank you.

2473
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:19,990
Are you gonna play Uma Musume Global?

2474
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,230
I would love to!

2475
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:25,890
I'm scared though because I'm really bad about...

2476
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,750
Oh my gosh.

2477
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,810
There's so much going on here.

2478
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:31,430
I'm really bad about playing more than one.

2479
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:37,150
One mobile game!

2480
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,870
Ah!

2481
01:56:38,690 --> 01:56:39,210
Oh!

2482
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:41,170
Once!

2483
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:42,090
Ah!

2484
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:45,010
This was the worst mistake of my life.

2485
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:48,250
Please die.

2486
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:48,350
Please die.

2487
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:49,890
Please die.

2488
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:50,910
Please die.

2489
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:52,630
I know there's one more.

2490
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:53,390
I heard him.

2491
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:54,010
I saw him.

2492
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:54,850
He went that way.

2493
01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:55,270
Oh!

2494
01:56:55,570 --> 01:56:55,970
Oh!

2495
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:01,430
But yeah.

2496
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:02,810
I'm really bad about play...

2497
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:05,930
Like I kind of put all my focus into one mobile game.

2498
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:07,030
And I like...

2499
01:57:08,170 --> 01:57:08,850
I don't know.

2500
01:57:08,910 --> 01:57:09,750
Because I...

2501
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:11,610
Just kind of...

2502
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:12,850
I don't know.

2503
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:14,670
Maybe it's like an attention thing.

2504
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:15,050
You know?

2505
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:18,030
It's like hard for me to focus on more than one.

2506
01:57:18,150 --> 01:57:18,350
Oh!

2507
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:18,450
Oh!

2508
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:21,670
There's a blueberry!

2509
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:26,050
Excuse me.

2510
01:57:26,110 --> 01:57:26,710
Thank you.

2511
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:30,030
Where did you go?

2512
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:30,650
There you are.

2513
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:35,490
I hear...

2514
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:35,830
Oh!

2515
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:36,550
Hello.

2516
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:38,670
Where the hell did you come from?

2517
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:45,530
Nice suit.

2518
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:46,950
Your hair!

2519
01:57:49,490 --> 01:57:50,290
Oh my god.

2520
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:51,250
Oh!

2521
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:52,390
Let's...

2522
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:54,070
Nah.

2523
01:57:54,490 --> 01:57:55,070
Wait.

2524
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:56,410
Yeah.

2525
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,130
Let's just take them out.

2526
01:57:58,770 --> 01:57:59,850
And then...

2527
01:57:59,850 --> 01:58:00,670
No.

2528
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:02,830
Oh!

2529
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:03,370
Wait.

2530
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:03,810
Where are they?

2531
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:05,970
Souls!

2532
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:09,650
Looking for some lost souls?

2533
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:15,410
Oh my...

2534
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,320
I didn't think it would reach through here.

2535
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,680
Bring eye masks here.

2536
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:25,400
Oh!

2537
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:25,820
Yeah!

2538
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:27,780
Really?

2539
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:35,380
I'm so afraid of my favorite stuff coming over.

2540
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:36,680
Like, I love blue archive.

2541
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:40,020
I try not to spend too much money on it.

2542
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,740
I think I'm usually pretty okay.

2543
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:48,260
I'm usually pretty good... about spending...

2544
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:49,440
I spend, like...

2545
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,160
Overkill, but that's okay.

2546
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:07,300
Oh my god, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2547
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:09,060
Please!

2548
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:15,020
PLEASE Where are you?

2549
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:19,200
I'm trying to speak to my chat.

2550
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:22,380
Could you all stop for five seconds?

2551
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:25,680
Anyway, what was I saying?

2552
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,360
No ammo.

2553
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:34,160
I spend maybe like less than ten dollars a month.

2554
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:36,500
They have like a special month pack.

2555
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:48,540
So, I spend like... and I did that... oh, oh, oh, oh, goodness, oh my god.

2556
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,200
Oh, but yes, that's what I wanted.

2557
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:02,070
He just came out of nowhere.

2558
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:05,690
I hear another one.

2559
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:07,690
I don't know what I hear.

2560
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:15,210
What did I just touch?

2561
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,010
Monthly PA... stop!

2562
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:24,430
It's just... it's tough to like get you more jammies and...

2563
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:27,930
But I never spend like on the jammie packs themselves, you know?

2564
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:35,960
Nice.

2565
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:45,320
I'm typically pretty good with gacha stuff.

2566
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:47,420
I'm pretty good about not...

2567
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:49,200
Oh wait, this is where we came from.

2568
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:53,060
About not spending such an insane amount.

2569
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:57,900
Because also, I would feel so guilty.

2570
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,560
I think.

2571
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:02,260
In that like...

2572
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:05,800
Wait, huh?

2573
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:08,960
Go down?

2574
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:09,480
Oh!

2575
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,820
I would feel guilty in that!

2576
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,500
I'd be like...

2577
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:23,080
I don't know.

2578
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,160
I don't know.

2579
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:24,800
I don't know.

2580
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:24,980
I don't know.

2581
02:01:35,910 --> 02:01:37,750
Gameplay is not for me in Blue Archive?

2582
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:38,210
That's okay.

2583
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:39,070
I think.

2584
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,400
I'd rather spend money on cute derpy Yoshi.

2585
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:46,700
See ya!

2586
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:50,660
Oh my god, I'm gonna die in here.

2587
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:51,880
Wait, I'm gonna die in here.

2588
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:52,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2589
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:53,800
Please!

2590
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:54,560
Oh my gosh.

2591
02:01:57,080 --> 02:02:03,900
I would feel guilty because, you know, if I got my money through like a conventional means, then I wouldn't feel guilty.

2592
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,080
But I don't.

2593
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:06,480
And so I feel like it's a waste.

2594
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:11,500
Of the money I do receive from you guys.

2595
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:21,760
So that's why I'm trying to be even more cautious and careful about it.

2596
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,040
Because, yeah.

2597
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,640
It's your allowance?

2598
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:27,540
No!

2599
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,800
But I bought...

2600
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:31,640
Okay.

2601
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:33,480
But I bought a bunch of Metal Gear stuff.

2602
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,180
I messaged Maddie.

2603
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:41,380
Who she does, um, Metal Gear comics.

2604
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,520
Oh, that's Raspberry.

2605
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:45,420
I messaged her because I was on Mercari.

2606
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:48,280
And I was looking and I found...

2607
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,360
What is this?

2608
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:51,980
Oh, my eyes!

2609
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:53,680
Wait.

2610
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,900
If I have this, please let me in!

2611
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,460
Where do I go with the radiation shield?

2612
02:02:58,880 --> 02:02:59,440
Uh-oh.

2613
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:00,480
Wait a second.

2614
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:01,980
Uh-oh.

2615
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:03,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2616
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:04,540
Wait, wait, wait.

2617
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:05,420
Let me in, let me in.

2618
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,300
Um, hold on.

2619
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:07,700
Uh-huh.

2620
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:12,620
Um, they...

2621
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:15,820
I've been looking for this figure for such a long time.

2622
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:18,160
And it's a Metal Gear Solid 4 snake.

2623
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:19,560
Like, old snake.

2624
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:23,700
And his ass is just really, really fat in the figure.

2625
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:26,640
So I've been looking for it and I found it.

2626
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:29,840
And I was like, Maddie, I found the figure!

2627
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:32,300
Finally came up on Mercari!

2628
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:34,460
And she was like, yippee!

2629
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:39,100
And sent me a bunch of, um, big butt snake emotes.

2630
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:39,840
Um, anyway.

2631
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:41,420
Where am I supposed to go?

2632
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:50,310
Oh, wait.

2633
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:50,690
No.

2634
02:03:51,010 --> 02:03:54,250
I don't think I'm supposed to go back to the acid room.

2635
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:58,670
Go down where the poison floor is.

2636
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:00,330
What's the poison floor?

2637
02:04:00,610 --> 02:04:02,030
Wait, like that one room?

2638
02:04:02,190 --> 02:04:03,090
Or the room...

2639
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:04,730
The floor wasn't poison though.

2640
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:05,290
It was on fire.

2641
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:07,650
Snake with the fat dumpy fuzz.

2642
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:08,370
Thank you.

2643
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:12,090
He's like...

2644
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:12,890
He's like in the...

2645
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:14,190
In the pose, you know?

2646
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:17,790
Where he's like, you know, he looks kind of like Spider-Man.

2647
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:21,570
But his ass is just really, really, really big.

2648
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,770
The red lava has progress.

2649
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:27,230
The one over here?

2650
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:28,430
Oh, I think...

2651
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:29,570
I think I see what you mean.

2652
02:04:29,890 --> 02:04:31,050
Oh, oh no!

2653
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:32,550
I wasted it.

2654
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:33,210
Uh-oh.

2655
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:34,950
Am I gonna be okay?

2656
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:38,170
I don't even know where it is.

2657
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:38,750
This room.

2658
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:39,270
This here.

2659
02:04:39,650 --> 02:04:40,730
I have to do all of this.

2660
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,090
Wait, no.

2661
02:04:41,190 --> 02:04:42,410
I don't have to do it all over again.

2662
02:04:42,410 --> 02:04:43,470
Though there was an entrance.

2663
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:49,050
Oh, there was an entrance.

2664
02:04:49,450 --> 02:04:49,850
Uh-oh.

2665
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:50,690
Wait.

2666
02:04:54,130 --> 02:04:55,830
Do I have to do this all over again?

2667
02:05:01,110 --> 02:05:02,190
The yellow pillars.

2668
02:05:04,810 --> 02:05:06,050
You guys, I can't get it...

2669
02:05:06,050 --> 02:05:06,210
Oh.

2670
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:10,900
My bad.

2671
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:15,960
Oh my god.

2672
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:16,320
No!

2673
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:17,440
No!

2674
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:29,960
Lampy, thanks for the gift.

2675
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:30,960
Dead!

2676
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,320
No!

2677
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:51,200
Who's your favorite?

2678
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:53,300
Oh, who are your favorite Blue Archive characters?

2679
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:54,740
I love Cherino.

2680
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,180
I love Koharu.

2681
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,640
I love Shiroko.

2682
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:00,120
I love...

2683
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:05,260
I know.

2684
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:08,080
I love Erona.

2685
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:08,520
I love Erona...

2686
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:10,800
Erona.

2687
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:11,000
Um...

2688
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:15,920
Check for a switch.

2689
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,940
Oh, that's a good idea.

2690
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:19,220
I don't see one right here.

2691
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:23,680
I think it's just a skill issue.

2692
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:28,080
See, that was just a skill issue after all.

2693
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,900
Oh, come on, man!

2694
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,340
Let me at least heal!

2695
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,760
Of course there's two of them.

2696
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,240
You freaks travel in packs!

2697
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:55,520
You're just like girls who have to go to the bathroom!

2698
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,700
You can never be by yourself!

2699
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:01,360
Oh my goodness.

2700
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:04,280
Oh, I'm not even hitting him.

2701
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:07,520
Oh, how did I miss that?

2702
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:14,120
Can you just die already?

2703
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,960
I thought he was going to be dead after that hit.

2704
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,360
I need some health.

2705
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:27,000
We finally have our yellow key.

2706
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:31,780
Which means we can finally get to the exit.

2707
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,780
Switch to the good shot, Glenn.

2708
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:38,280
Wait, what are you talking about?

2709
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,640
I was on the good shot.

2710
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,220
Was I on the bad shot?

2711
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:44,600
No, I was on the shotgun.

2712
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:47,620
I was on the good shotgun.

2713
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,020
Shut up, mod.

2714
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:56,610
This is not the super shotgun.

2715
02:07:58,090 --> 02:07:59,950
Oh, I switched to it on accident.

2716
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:05,240
Okay.

2717
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,920
Alright, let's get out of here.

2718
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:13,240
And be paranoid on the way back.

2719
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:14,900
Paranoid, I'm paranoid!

2720
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,100
I'm paranoid, I'm...

2721
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:25,400
I'm paranoid!

2722
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:29,080
I'm so glad I'm paranoid.

2723
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:36,450
Oh, they're all gone.

2724
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,740
I thought something opened.

2725
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:50,360
Oh my god, no way.

2726
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:51,660
No way.

2727
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:53,480
Get me out of this, please.

2728
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:56,000
I never asked to be the doom guy, please.

2729
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:58,520
I never asked to be the doom guy!

2730
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,140
I never asked to be the doom guy!

2731
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:01,680
AHHHH!

2732
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:06,520
There's a secret exit.

2733
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,460
Where at?

2734
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:11,040
In here?

2735
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,340
Wait, hold on.

2736
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,100
Am I hearing a...

2737
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:18,560
Oh, is that a door?

2738
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:21,000
Is that what I'm hearing?

2739
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:23,960
AHHHH!

2740
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:26,540
Wait a second!

2741
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:28,060
I got it, I got it, I got it.

2742
02:09:32,980 --> 02:09:33,700
I don't know if...

2743
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:34,840
Is that it?

2744
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:35,040
Okay.

2745
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:36,480
That might be it.

2746
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:41,440
Come on!

2747
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:45,300
Okay, hold on.

2748
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:47,640
Okay, okay, okay.

2749
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:52,820
Run, run, run, run, run!

2750
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:53,460
No!

2751
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,660
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2752
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:55,520
Please, please, please.

2753
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:57,140
Secret!

2754
02:09:59,060 --> 02:09:59,460
Oh.

2755
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,860
That was the secret.

2756
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:08,080
80% secret.

2757
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:10,040
30 minutes.

2758
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:10,920
Oh my gosh.

2759
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:12,180
In the void!

2760
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:16,340
Oh.

2761
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:19,200
You wretch is a strange...

2762
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:21,840
Asrid...

2763
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:24,220
Acid...

2764
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:24,980
A...

2765
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:26,040
A...

2766
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:27,420
Asrid...

2767
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:28,840
Odorous salt seal.

2768
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,660
Death and demon carcass!

2769
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,980
No nightmare could have prepared you for this.

2770
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:36,500
You realize that this place was not meant for living humans.

2771
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:38,600
Acrid!

2772
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:41,700
Acrid...

2773
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,580
Acrid.

2774
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:48,900
What sound does a C make?

2775
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,680
Okay then how do you pronounce acid?

2776
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:53,760
Dummy!

2777
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:57,740
English language is hard.

2778
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,000
Oh my god.

2779
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:03,980
Oh my god.

2780
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:06,480
Wowee.

2781
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:09,360
They just throw you straight in...

2782
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:09,940
Man, baby.

2783
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:10,620
Okay.

2784
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,060
No more time for baby games anymore.

2785
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:15,440
We're in the home stretch, you guys.

2786
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:16,600
This is it.

2787
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:19,720
This is the home stretch.

2788
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,560
Can I have some health at least though?

2789
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:23,360
Like for real?

2790
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:23,800
Okay.

2791
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,740
Like a blueberry would be so appreciated.

2792
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:31,160
Okay, save the game.

2793
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,100
Now that we're here.

2794
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:34,360
Level 9.

2795
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,180
31?

2796
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:40,580
Huh?

2797
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:41,100
Wait.

2798
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:42,520
Huh?

2799
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,440
Huh?

2800
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:46,800
Lampy, thanks for the gift!

2801
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:49,440
What was that?

2802
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:54,420
Can you guys shut up in here?

2803
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:14,730
Okay.

2804
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:16,990
Whoa, this place is crazy looking.

2805
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:20,370
Excuse you.

2806
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:29,510
Oh my god.

2807
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:30,610
Oh my god.

2808
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:31,550
Oh my god.

2809
02:12:31,690 --> 02:12:32,490
Oh my god.

2810
02:12:32,710 --> 02:12:33,410
Oh my god.

2811
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:35,390
Oh my god.

2812
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:37,330
I knew it.

2813
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:39,370
Hold on, I'm gonna load.

2814
02:12:39,570 --> 02:12:40,510
I'm just gonna restart.

2815
02:12:41,050 --> 02:12:41,530
It's okay.

2816
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:43,750
It's okay.

2817
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:44,570
I'll just restart.

2818
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:46,350
In fact, I'm just gonna...

2819
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:02,840
Leave me alone.

2820
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:04,800
Uglies.

2821
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:07,340
Okay, anyway.

2822
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:12,160
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2823
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:15,700
Is this a maze or...

2824
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:19,760
Oh my god.

2825
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,340
I can see there's like...

2826
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:25,060
They're shooting at me from so, so far away.

2827
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,800
Oh, there's the exit.

2828
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:30,780
Humans are not supposed to be here.

2829
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:32,560
I think I made a mistake.

2830
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:33,700
Ah!

2831
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:35,400
Oh my gosh.

2832
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:38,240
Jump scare.

2833
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:45,640
That's the sound I make too whenever I hear you.

2834
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:47,840
I hear you when I see your ugly face.

2835
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,220
I go...

2836
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,340
Take that.

2837
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:13,160
That guy wasn't even walking.

2838
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:14,860
He was just literally sliding.

2839
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:25,420
Spring back memories of the Star Wars, Dark Forces game and Jedi Knight games.

2840
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:26,120
Those were classics.

2841
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,960
I've never played those.

2842
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,920
Well, I wouldn't have played something that's Star Wars.

2843
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:34,360
It's not really my thing.

2844
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:43,500
Did you know that there's actually a Doom game of...

2845
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:44,800
Wait.

2846
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:45,920
Oh, I thought I saw.

2847
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:49,080
There's a Doom game of cereal.

2848
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:56,250
What the hell is in here?

2849
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:04,260
I'm so glad I came in here for the blueberry.

2850
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,600
I need a blue key.

2851
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:11,420
Where is it coming from?

2852
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:13,420
The Chex game.

2853
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,360
Yes, yes.

2854
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:15,100
I think that's the one.

2855
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:29,300
Are these guys just going to keep respawning?

2856
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:32,860
I need a yellow key.

2857
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:36,240
This is all a little confusing.

2858
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,160
But we'll get it.

2859
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:39,600
We'll get there.

2860
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:42,540
Would you play it?

2861
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:44,280
Sure.

2862
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:44,700
Why not?

2863
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:45,260
Oh my God.

2864
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:53,260
Okay.

2865
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,660
Oh God.

2866
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:55,260
Oh God.

2867
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:55,760
Oh God.

2868
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:01,740
I think I got him though.

2869
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:02,100
Nice.

2870
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,280
Where is he?

2871
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,100
Where are you going?

2872
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:11,180
Oh my God.

2873
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:11,740
Oh my God.

2874
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:12,340
Oh my God.

2875
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:15,500
Oh, I can't believe I dodged that.

2876
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:16,760
Where are you going?

2877
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:18,600
Okay.

2878
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:23,540
Also a Christian Doom game on Noah's Ark.

2879
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:26,400
That sounds awesome.

2880
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:28,600
Save the game real quick.

2881
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,720
Matrix dodge there.

2882
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:36,040
That's called being a Touhou player.

2883
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,900
That's called playing Touhou.

2884
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,300
Oh, one time in your life.

2885
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:44,860
How do I get here?

2886
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,120
Hmm.

2887
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:48,720
There's so much stuff going on around here.

2888
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:54,320
Oh, we got the red key.

2889
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:00,540
Nice.

2890
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,500
Is this a secret level?

2891
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:10,300
I think so.

2892
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:12,100
Because it says level 31.

2893
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:15,200
But aren't there only like...

2894
02:17:19,230 --> 02:17:19,710
Technically...

2895
02:17:19,710 --> 02:17:19,950
Sorry.

2896
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:20,550
I'm scared.

2897
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:20,990
I'm scared of this.

2898
02:17:21,930 --> 02:17:23,690
Whatever is going on here.

2899
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:32,850
By the way, guys, my meeting is at 1130 if you could just help me.

2900
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:43,350
If you could help me if I stay here too late.

2901
02:17:45,010 --> 02:17:45,770
Oh, hello.

2902
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:47,670
No, not that.

2903
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:48,250
Okay.

2904
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:50,530
Okay.

2905
02:17:58,740 --> 02:17:59,260
Anymore?

2906
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:00,760
Anymore.

2907
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:02,700
Time zones though.

2908
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:06,220
Well, right now it's 917 for me.

2909
02:18:08,060 --> 02:18:08,920
What's down here?

2910
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:10,880
How long is that?

2911
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,080
I think it's a couple of hours.

2912
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:19,480
Who's down there?

2913
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:21,000
Who is that?

2914
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:38,300
A baron of hell.

2915
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:39,020
Sorry.

2916
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:39,600
That's me.

2917
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:40,200
Oh.

2918
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:40,860
Oh.

2919
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:42,080
I just shot you.

2920
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:43,920
I just sent you to an early grave.

2921
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,440
Or maybe it's a properly timed grave.

2922
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:49,040
Who knows?

2923
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:50,640
Okay.

2924
02:18:50,660 --> 02:18:55,180
We got the blue, which means we can go get whatever the heck that thing was.

2925
02:18:58,940 --> 02:18:59,940
Which was...

2926
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:04,720
Here.

2927
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:05,300
Here.

2928
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:10,900
Oh, I keep forgetting that I have...

2929
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:12,300
Right here.

2930
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:12,800
Okay.

2931
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:16,860
What's going on?

2932
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:17,520
Oh no.

2933
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:19,140
What are you?

2934
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:22,980
What is this thing?

2935
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:31,520
Why won't you let me have you?

2936
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:39,180
Also, I cannot get over the fact that like demons in hell have to like... they can't even finish their bridges.

2937
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:41,000
Are they so stupid?

2938
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:41,980
They don't know how to build?

2939
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:45,160
You'll need that.

2940
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:47,680
It powers up the Unmaker.

2941
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,960
Okay, we'll have to come back for it.

2942
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:53,180
Wait, where else can I go with the blue?

2943
02:19:57,820 --> 02:20:01,500
But I flipped some sort of switch, so maybe...

2944
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:06,580
It's this.

2945
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:18,380
Oh, oh, oh, I didn't realize it was... Okay, no worries.

2946
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:24,400
Oh, here we go!

2947
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:25,680
Oh, too fast.

2948
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:26,360
Just kidding.

2949
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:28,880
This honestly looks like a nether build.

2950
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:31,280
Because of the colors?

2951
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:32,500
I can see it.

2952
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:36,200
What if I go across when it's up?

2953
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:37,040
Oh, there we go.

2954
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:37,780
Okay, never mind.

2955
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:40,680
We never needed it after all.

2956
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,940
Okay, what other yellow places could we go?

2957
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:50,160
What better way to spend your birthday than watching your Kamiyoshi playing one of the games that made most of your childhood?

2958
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:51,080
Oh, shoot!

2959
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:51,880
Yellow!

2960
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:53,060
Oh my gosh.

2961
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:54,920
Happy birthday!

2962
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:03,680
Happy birthday to you.

2963
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:07,140
Happy birthday to you.

2964
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:10,260
Happy birthday, dear Shu.

2965
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:18,760
Happy birthday to you.

2966
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:25,000
Happy birthday to you.

2967
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:25,860
Happy birthday to you.

2968
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:25,880
Happy birthday!

2969
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:27,580
I feel like it's been a while since I've seen you.

2970
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,000
I hope you're doing well.

2971
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:31,780
Unless you've been around, and I'm just blind.

2972
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:32,640
I'm really sorry.

2973
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:35,760
Wait, why don't you come down?

2974
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:39,620
Come down, little hell baby.

2975
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:54,520
мел Wall button... I already pressed it.

2976
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:55,880
It opened up something else.

2977
02:21:57,420 --> 02:21:57,900
See?

2978
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:03,740
It's not the wall button... but maybe another wall button somewhere.

2979
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:07,520
How hard it is to finish your bridges when some Doomguy keeps killing your workforce.

2980
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:10,460
Everyone here.

2981
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:13,680
All the pinkies and all that are being like...

2982
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,220
Hey, man, you shouldn't be here.

2983
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:16,920
This place is really dangerous.

2984
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:17,980
It's still under construction.

2985
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,160
Hey man, you need to wear a hard hat!

2986
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:22,560
And we're just like, rip a chair!

2987
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:29,550
Screw your safety!

2988
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:32,250
What was this over here?

2989
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:36,810
Oh yeah, how do I get in through here?

2990
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:39,830
Mysterious.

2991
02:22:41,150 --> 02:22:42,890
I don't want to just leave yet though.

2992
02:22:44,410 --> 02:22:48,770
Unless it's one of those, like, you walk up to it and that's when it comes down.

2993
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:49,570
I'm not sure.

2994
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:51,610
I'm looking for any other wall.

2995
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:54,110
Any other wall buttons.

2996
02:22:54,890 --> 02:22:56,050
I don't see any though.

2997
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,860
Go towards the exit, not all the way until you get a quake.

2998
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:05,600
Ah!

2999
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,200
So it is exactly...

3000
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,340
Oops, wrong way.

3001
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,920
It is exactly as I thought it was.

3002
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:12,560
Wait, wrong way.

3003
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:13,640
I was the right way.

3004
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:14,380
This way.

3005
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,400
This way.

3006
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:25,660
Run!

3007
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:37,640
Where did it go?

3008
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:59,830
Did it teleport?

3009
02:24:01,730 --> 02:24:02,810
Hide and seek?

3010
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:08,450
Oh, maybe it was in that spot down here.

3011
02:24:16,610 --> 02:24:18,730
The grunts are like, hey man, it's dangerous in here.

3012
02:24:18,830 --> 02:24:21,450
And Doomguy is just like, yeah, it is, but not for me.

3013
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:24,490
I think I...

3014
02:24:24,490 --> 02:24:25,690
You were too slow!

3015
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:29,750
Story of my life.

3016
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:32,150
Doomguy is like...

3017
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,470
Actually...

3018
02:24:33,470 --> 02:24:35,610
Like a meter tall, okay guys?

3019
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:36,870
It's not his fault.

3020
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:39,930
He is really, really short.

3021
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:44,950
Do I just run off the side?

3022
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:07,640
100% everything.

3023
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,060
The spiral.

3024
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:14,440
Where are we at now?

3025
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:15,100
Okay.

3026
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:17,140
Yes.

3027
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:21,200
Are they your Doom or are you their Doom?

3028
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:22,740
Oh, now we're 19.

3029
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,340
Really makes you think.

3030
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:25,920
Ew.

3031
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:28,340
Wait, what goes here?

3032
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:28,960
Oh, nothing.

3033
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:29,340
Okay.

3034
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:34,130
Wow, there's a whole party in there.

3035
02:25:34,250 --> 02:25:34,630
Okay.

3036
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:37,630
Hope I'm not disrupting anything.

3037
02:25:44,170 --> 02:25:45,970
Let's grab this guy first.

3038
02:26:02,030 --> 02:26:02,590
Dang.

3039
02:26:03,850 --> 02:26:04,710
Who is...

3040
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:05,570
Who is blowing up?

3041
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:06,530
Oh.

3042
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:08,370
I think him.

3043
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:10,230
Your aim.

3044
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:11,710
Aim doko.

3045
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,550
Oh.

3046
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:14,450
Dang.

3047
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:15,350
That really would have hit me.

3048
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:21,040
Here we go.

3049
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:22,240
Oh, there's another one.

3050
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:24,660
Oh gosh.

3051
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:25,060
Okay.

3052
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:25,440
Hold on.

3053
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:26,920
Oh, there's several of them.

3054
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:27,280
Okay.

3055
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,200
This is fine.

3056
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:31,780
This is not fine.

3057
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:34,200
Oh my god.

3058
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:35,020
They're all coming here.

3059
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:36,120
They're all coming here.

3060
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:40,340
I don't want to be trapped in here.

3061
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:44,680
I don't want to be trapped in here.

3062
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:48,840
Yeah.

3063
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,380
In fight.

3064
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:00,680
Oh my god.

3065
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,200
Oh my god.

3066
02:27:01,260 --> 02:27:01,640
Oh my god.

3067
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:02,640
How did I manage?

3068
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:03,700
How did I live?

3069
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:04,160
I don't know.

3070
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:04,520
I don't know.

3071
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:04,960
I don't know.

3072
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,860
I don't know how I lived.

3073
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:08,000
There we go.

3074
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:09,320
Die already.

3075
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:12,740
Oh my god.

3076
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:14,980
The dodge, though.

3077
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,340
I do be doing a little bit of game.

3078
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:19,760
Maybe I can get them from down here.

3079
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:21,200
Oh.

3080
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:25,820
Doomguy just infamously doesn't know how to lift up, you know?

3081
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:29,720
Infamously does not know how to lift up a gun.

3082
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:33,920
Oh they're fighting?

3083
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:34,960
The girls are fighting?

3084
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:36,620
Oh.

3085
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:37,040
Okay.

3086
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:39,020
Now I'm fighting the girls.

3087
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:42,720
Shut up.

3088
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,240
Wooo!

3089
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:48,400
All righty guys...

3090
02:27:49,420 --> 02:28:04,260
Oh guys, oh guys, oh guys o guys o guys o guys o guys o guys o guys o guy 간 HE DID IT AGAIN

3091
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:17,600
That was really scary.

3092
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:20,120
That was not fun.

3093
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,520
Oops, I did it again.

3094
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:30,200
With your heart got lost.

3095
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:32,900
Okay, we can kill this guy though.

3096
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:36,780
But now I know that there's a second one.

3097
02:28:37,380 --> 02:28:39,940
Well, there's a couple, but you know.

3098
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,920
That guy right there.

3099
02:28:44,220 --> 02:28:45,440
Did you notice?

3100
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,180
You didn't notice me.

3101
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:48,580
Oh, you didn't.

3102
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:49,060
You noticed me.

3103
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:51,140
Excuse you.

3104
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:52,400
I'm in the middle of something.

3105
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,160
Actually,

3106
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:11,200
what if I just unmade it?

3107
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:13,260
Unmaker!

3108
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:19,740
Here we go.

3109
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:21,900
Time to unmake.

3110
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:24,820
How I unmade your mother.

3111
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:34,740
The girls are not fighting.

3112
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:36,700
Though they should be.

3113
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:50,410
I'm going to save the game.

3114
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:56,920
There's a nice blueberry over there.

3115
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,140
Whose footprints are these?

3116
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:02,760
Wait, what else was...

3117
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:03,720
Oh, I was grabbing the armor.

3118
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:04,840
That's what I wanted to grab.

3119
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:06,540
Once it comes back down...

3120
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:07,660
I don't want to...

3121
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:09,180
Oh, and there's a backpack there too, even.

3122
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:12,280
Nice.

3123
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:13,400
Nice.

3124
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:18,580
I'll take everything that you got.

3125
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:19,680
I'm robbing them blind.

3126
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:23,340
Whose footprints are these?

3127
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:25,720
Did I grab this?

3128
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:26,480
Do I need this?

3129
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:26,900
No.

3130
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:27,480
Okay.

3131
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:28,960
Let's go hit the button.

3132
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:31,140
And chain gun it up.

3133
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:36,260
I love the projectile enemies.

3134
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:37,260
They're super fun to dodge.

3135
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,700
It feels like...

3136
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:41,820
Like when I'm playing a...

3137
02:30:41,820 --> 02:30:42,260
Oh my gosh.

3138
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:42,760
Oh my gosh.

3139
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:44,360
When I'm playing a rhythm game, you know?

3140
02:30:52,550 --> 02:30:53,870
Just die already!

3141
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:03,340
Why are there so many of you?

3142
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:11,620
My ears!

3143
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:13,420
My heckin' ears, man.

3144
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:15,540
God,

3145
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:26,800
my ears.

3146
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:36,160
Take it a sippy.

3147
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,560
That was crazy.

3148
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:44,000
That was pretty crazy.

3149
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:44,100
That was crazy.

3150
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:46,660
I didn't even get to hit the button.

3151
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:48,620
I thought they came out with the button.

3152
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:52,240
I was very mistaken.

3153
02:31:55,160 --> 02:32:00,300
But we didn't take as much damage as we could have, so maybe a win.

3154
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:03,300
This is a different area, right?

3155
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:04,180
We need the red key.

3156
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,400
I'm just going to save one more time.

3157
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:11,180
Let's go.

3158
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:15,180
Okay, how much ammo do I even have?

3159
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:15,860
541?

3160
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:16,980
Oh, it's not bad at all.

3161
02:32:19,360 --> 02:32:21,680
Do I need... did I even use this?

3162
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:22,780
Nope.

3163
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:23,140
Okay.

3164
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:25,140
I'm good.

3165
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:25,780
Alright.

3166
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:27,300
Let's go.

3167
02:32:27,860 --> 02:32:29,240
There was nothing in here, right?

3168
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:30,960
Nothing opened up?

3169
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:32,280
Nothing secret?

3170
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:32,760
No?

3171
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:33,240
Okay.

3172
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:36,720
How do I get the blueberry?

3173
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:37,380
How do I get the blueberry?

3174
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:37,920
How do I get the key?

3175
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:39,320
How do I get everything?

3176
02:32:49,200 --> 02:33:00,590
Where am I?

3177
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:03,210
I wish I could look down or up.

3178
02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:05,170
Wait, where am I?

3179
02:33:07,330 --> 02:33:08,370
Did I get the key?

3180
02:33:08,470 --> 02:33:08,690
No.

3181
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:09,250
Wait.

3182
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:19,190
No fall damage.

3183
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:26,450
He didn't

3184
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:31,530
die.

3185
02:33:34,650 --> 02:33:36,250
I missed two.

3186
02:33:36,470 --> 02:33:36,770
Dang.

3187
02:33:36,910 --> 02:33:38,550
I almost had a perfect record.

3188
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:40,890
You guys ruined my streak.

3189
02:33:43,870 --> 02:33:44,530
Cool.

3190
02:33:45,530 --> 02:33:47,150
So I got the red keys.

3191
02:33:47,150 --> 02:33:49,630
Now we can continue onwards.

3192
02:33:51,370 --> 02:33:51,890
What?

3193
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:01,040
Wow, what a short, short episode.

3194
02:34:03,700 --> 02:34:06,440
I mean, the last one was really, really long, so...

3195
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:10,780
100% breakdown.

3196
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:11,540
That's me.

3197
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:14,860
I'm having a break.

3198
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:16,040
Yeah.

3199
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:19,960
So true.

3200
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:20,860
So true game.

3201
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:23,220
This level?

3202
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:24,000
Uh-oh.

3203
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:25,660
Am I in for it?

3204
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:28,500
Am I in for it?

3205
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:30,380
There's an old DDR song that goes...

3206
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:30,860
Breakdown.

3207
02:34:31,220 --> 02:34:33,480
Ba-da-da-da-ba-da-ba-ba.

3208
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:35,980
Ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba.

3209
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:38,620
It was one of my favorites to play always.

3210
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:39,920
Da-da...

3211
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,060
Ah!

3212
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:46,060
What have I just...

3213
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:47,080
Oh, I need a blue key.

3214
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:53,700
Ba-da-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

3215
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:54,840
Oh my god!

3216
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:57,100
Did that hit me?

3217
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:57,740
Yes, it did.

3218
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:58,980
So sad.

3219
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:01,560
No, no, no.

3220
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:01,900
You.

3221
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:14,000
Oops.

3222
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:21,520
Be for you.

3223
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,240
Oh gosh, you guys remember it too?

3224
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:25,920
We're so old.

3225
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:30,900
We're so old, you guys.

3226
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:32,800
Oh, we can just kind of go up here and...

3227
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:35,760
Take them down.

3228
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:37,100
Two by two.

3229
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:40,080
One by one is for babies.

3230
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,060
Two by two, baby.

3231
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,460
Why won't you die?

3232
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:54,960
I'm not old.

3233
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:55,560
Breaks back.

3234
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:58,420
I'm not old.

3235
02:36:00,380 --> 02:36:01,900
Why is the music so frightening?

3236
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:03,560
How do I get down from here?

3237
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:04,940
There we go.

3238
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:11,320
Picked up a clip.

3239
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:11,920
Oh, nice.

3240
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:12,680
Yeah.

3241
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:14,340
I'll take it all.

3242
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:14,860
I'll take it all.

3243
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,460
Oh, that's not a blueberry at all.

3244
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,400
Um, how.

3245
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:24,960
Now.

3246
02:36:26,440 --> 02:36:27,280
Brown.

3247
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:29,180
Cow.

3248
02:36:44,890 --> 02:36:47,710
I'm showing too much skin to the viewers?

3249
02:36:48,310 --> 02:36:52,610
How embarrassing.

3250
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:56,030
No.

3251
02:36:56,330 --> 02:36:58,290
I'm just showing...

3252
02:36:58,290 --> 02:36:59,550
Should I just cover my face?

3253
02:37:07,470 --> 02:37:09,690
I don't see anything to, like, push.

3254
02:37:10,430 --> 02:37:12,310
Except the thing that's all the way up there.

3255
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:18,270
Too much exposed.

3256
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:21,190
No.

3257
02:37:23,530 --> 02:37:25,450
Do you guys see any buttons or...

3258
02:37:25,450 --> 02:37:26,350
Do you guys...

3259
02:37:26,350 --> 02:37:27,090
Have you guys seen one?

3260
02:37:31,530 --> 02:37:33,150
The walls are made of flesh.

3261
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:33,990
No.

3262
02:37:36,470 --> 02:37:38,350
Maybe the floor is made of flesh.

3263
02:37:40,050 --> 02:37:41,410
Shoot from afar, maybe.

3264
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:42,970
Let's try it.

3265
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:51,880
This is actually spooky.

3266
02:37:59,380 --> 02:38:00,480
Oh, from the upper level.

3267
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:13,550
Oh my gosh.

3268
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:14,230
I'm not going to make it.

3269
02:38:14,330 --> 02:38:14,690
Oh my God.

3270
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:15,510
I'm not going to make it.

3271
02:38:18,130 --> 02:38:18,750
There we go.

3272
02:38:19,090 --> 02:38:19,470
Whew.

3273
02:38:21,310 --> 02:38:22,190
Thanks, guys, for watching.

3274
02:38:22,190 --> 02:38:22,590
Thanks for your help.

3275
02:38:22,770 --> 02:38:23,910
Much appreciated.

3276
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:25,110
Push, push.

3277
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:29,650
Oh!

3278
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:32,780
Are

3279
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:41,040
these bars?

3280
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:43,220
She's spitting.

3281
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:49,380
I thought they were going to have dummy demons inside.

3282
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:53,360
Ooh, we're going down...

3283
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:57,940
I'm sorry for disturbing!

3284
02:38:57,940 --> 02:38:58,400
Starving!

3285
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:08,650
Where are you?

3286
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,330
Nice butt!

3287
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:17,430
Very cool.

3288
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:21,930
You're not sorry.

3289
02:39:25,830 --> 02:39:30,310
Come on!

3290
02:39:30,370 --> 02:39:30,490
Come on!

3291
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:30,750
Come on!

3292
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:34,910
What's in the other one though?

3293
02:39:34,990 --> 02:39:36,090
I saw two doors open.

3294
02:39:36,330 --> 02:39:36,770
Wait.

3295
02:39:37,290 --> 02:39:37,770
Wait.

3296
02:39:37,950 --> 02:39:38,210
Wait.

3297
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:41,050
Secret!

3298
02:39:42,690 --> 02:39:44,610
So many secrets around here.

3299
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:47,490
Oh, never mind.

3300
02:39:47,670 --> 02:39:48,670
I thought both of them opened.

3301
02:39:49,090 --> 02:39:49,910
Just the one did.

3302
02:39:52,930 --> 02:39:53,590
Okay, cool.

3303
02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:54,350
Let's keep going.

3304
02:39:55,390 --> 02:39:56,630
Sorry for disturbing you.

3305
02:39:56,670 --> 02:39:57,690
Shoots rocket at your face?

3306
02:39:58,150 --> 02:39:58,910
It's not...

3307
02:39:58,910 --> 02:39:59,870
It's nothing personal.

3308
02:40:01,130 --> 02:40:02,290
It's nothing personal.

3309
02:40:10,650 --> 02:40:11,190
It's just...

3310
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:12,030
It's nothing personal, kid.

3311
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:13,230
It's just...

3312
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:14,010
It's just business.

3313
02:40:14,870 --> 02:40:16,370
It's just business, everybody.

3314
02:40:16,650 --> 02:40:17,430
Wait, where am I?

3315
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:20,050
I don't remember this...

3316
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:22,190
This maze.

3317
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,580
What's going to happen when I open...?

3318
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:43,260
Wait, this way?

3319
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:46,100
Oh my goodness!

3320
02:40:51,370 --> 02:40:52,230
Maze of men.

3321
02:40:53,790 --> 02:40:55,290
Only the strongest, Mei.

3322
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:56,370
Yellow key.

3323
02:40:58,330 --> 02:41:00,910
A maze made for only real men.

3324
02:41:01,210 --> 02:41:01,550
Uh-oh.

3325
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:03,450
What's going to happen in here?

3326
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:04,390
No!

3327
02:41:05,970 --> 02:41:07,030
Cool walls.

3328
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:08,870
They're pretty cool.

3329
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:10,170
Where are we at?

3330
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:11,330
20?

3331
02:41:14,990 --> 02:41:15,630
Yeah.

3332
02:41:16,450 --> 02:41:18,790
Each level now has multiple save.

3333
02:41:18,890 --> 02:41:19,530
Oh, no.

3334
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:22,210
Oh, no.

3335
02:41:23,470 --> 02:41:23,830
I

3336
02:41:26,930 --> 02:41:28,970
don't know why I'm using up this bolt... these bullets.

3337
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:30,390
I'm an idiot.

3338
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:41,150
There we go.

3339
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:41,870
Ah!

3340
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:43,950
There is a key down there.

3341
02:41:47,110 --> 02:41:47,630
Come on.

3342
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:48,810
There we go.

3343
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:50,150
Give me...

3344
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:51,250
Let me have the bullets, please.

3345
02:41:51,290 --> 02:41:51,490
Okay.

3346
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:54,570
You think it's safe?

3347
02:41:54,950 --> 02:41:55,310
I don't know.

3348
02:41:56,030 --> 02:41:57,730
Do you think it's...

3349
02:42:01,390 --> 02:42:02,090
Oh my

3350
02:42:16,900 --> 02:42:17,220
god.

3351
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:19,180
They're so obsessed with me.

3352
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,220
Oh, no.

3353
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,400
Their bodies disappeared.

3354
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,800
I thought it was so cool.

3355
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:29,040
There was like a whole thing of pinkies.

3356
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:30,680
Wow.

3357
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:31,320
That's a lot of health.

3358
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:32,260
That's pretty generous.

3359
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:34,240
Nice.

3360
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:36,880
Nice.

3361
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:39,660
Okay.

3362
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:40,100
Okay.

3363
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:42,700
Is there anything?

3364
02:42:42,700 --> 02:42:42,960
Uh...

3365
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:45,120
Red key?

3366
02:42:47,660 --> 02:42:50,280
I'm hearing something, but like not the ombi...

3367
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:50,960
on some hearing...

3368
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:53,660
Like I think I heard like a vroom.

3369
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:57,180
Which way do I go?

3370
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:03,980
Where am I?

3371
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:05,480
Oh!

3372
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:06,520
Okay.

3373
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:09,620
This is the secret room, and then this goes...

3374
02:43:10,380 --> 02:43:10,980
This is the door.

3375
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:11,720
I

3376
02:43:17,310 --> 02:43:17,430
don't understand.

3377
02:43:17,430 --> 02:43:17,450
I'm like, what should I do?

3378
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:17,750
There is a recording right there.

3379
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:18,110
Okay.

3380
02:43:18,130 --> 02:43:19,130
This is where we just came from.

3381
02:43:21,090 --> 02:43:22,210
How do I leave?

3382
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,810
Tummy hort.

3383
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:27,770
That was you, your tummy...

3384
02:43:27,770 --> 02:43:28,070
Oh!

3385
02:43:28,790 --> 02:43:29,950
Nevermind, we don't need to leave.

3386
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:48,920
We've got this.

3387
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,200
That's the neat part, you don't.

3388
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:53,660
I'm figuring that out real fast.

3389
02:44:01,820 --> 02:44:02,260
Wow.

3390
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:02,340
Wow.

3391
02:44:02,980 --> 02:44:05,280
Hell is so great this time of year.

3392
02:44:08,780 --> 02:44:10,180
Oh my gosh!

3393
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:11,180
Don't shoot me!

3394
02:44:23,310 --> 02:44:24,510
Just gonna...

3395
02:44:26,010 --> 02:44:27,030
Oh dang.

3396
02:44:27,550 --> 02:44:29,990
I can't lift my tiny arms up high enough.

3397
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:31,870
Oh my god!

3398
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:35,110
I got three in one!

3399
02:44:35,950 --> 02:44:36,830
That's kind of cool.

3400
02:44:37,010 --> 02:44:37,650
It's kind of exciting.

3401
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:45,740
Triple.

3402
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:48,280
I don't think I've ever had a triple kill before.

3403
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,000
Do you think hell is more bearable than the current earth weather?

3404
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:54,220
Summer just started and it's already 105.

3405
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:54,900
Wait.

3406
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:56,920
Is it officially summer now?

3407
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:04,060
Gosh, there's a lot of these.

3408
02:45:04,760 --> 02:45:06,160
A lot of like little...

3409
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:13,800
Oh, there he is!

3410
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:17,820
As of last Friday!

3411
02:45:25,710 --> 02:45:26,570
Wait, where did he go?

3412
02:45:27,210 --> 02:45:28,270
Oh, there's two of them.

3413
02:45:32,130 --> 02:45:32,490
Oh...

3414
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:34,370
No, no, I got stuck on the door.

3415
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:40,320
Nice.

3416
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:41,780
Not nice.

3417
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:43,440
I mean, I still got stuck on the door but...

3418
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:44,820
Wow, how did that happen?

3419
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:45,300
Happy summer!

3420
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:47,600
I didn't realize that it happened already.

3421
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:49,500
I feel really silly now.

3422
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:54,140
I even have a... I have a podcast based off of it being summer.

3423
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,120
I didn't even realize it was summer.

3424
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:00,460
Silly me.

3425
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:02,560
Silly me.

3426
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:09,700
I think Matara talked about it on her stream, so I'll mention it too.

3427
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:11,300
What the...

3428
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:12,560
Oh my gosh.

3429
02:46:12,740 --> 02:46:13,400
You bastards.

3430
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:16,220
Did you shoot each other?

3431
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:17,280
I think they shot each other.

3432
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:20,580
But basically...

3433
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:24,940
Because our Japan trip kind of like went haywire...

3434
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:28,460
We were trying to figure out when we can go...

3435
02:46:29,220 --> 02:46:30,080
Go back.

3436
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:34,380
To do the stuff that we wanted to do.

3437
02:46:34,900 --> 02:46:37,820
We basically decided in August, so...

3438
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:40,540
Wait, what moved?

3439
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:47,300
Something over there.

3440
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:48,500
Something over here.

3441
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:54,060
Something over there.

3442
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:54,280
Here?

3443
02:46:56,060 --> 02:46:56,440
Huh?

3444
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:57,320
Am I missing it?

3445
02:46:58,780 --> 02:46:59,760
Enjoy the weather.

3446
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,160
Well, I mean we would have gone in July, so it would have been awful anyway.

3447
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:05,040
Imagine being on summer.

3448
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:08,120
LMAO, this super was sponsored by Southern Hemisphere Gang.

3449
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:10,040
Yippee!

3450
02:47:17,560 --> 02:47:19,400
But yeah, it's just kind of what we got to do.

3451
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:22,600
Basically.

3452
02:47:23,580 --> 02:47:25,160
Maybe this is what opens up.

3453
02:47:26,300 --> 02:47:27,500
But no, it's not.

3454
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:28,760
Huh.

3455
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:32,810
What's happening on my...

3456
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:35,160
Yeah, it's happening...

3457
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:35,920
I have no idea.

3458
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:42,940
Plasma gun!

3459
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:46,260
Okay, we at least got that.

3460
02:47:48,360 --> 02:47:48,860
Oh.

3461
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:50,600
Wait, this is where we came from.

3462
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:51,200
Okay, nevermind.

3463
02:47:56,700 --> 02:47:57,140
Oh, wait.

3464
02:47:57,140 --> 02:47:57,260
We're already here.

3465
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:57,320
Where the hell am I?

3466
02:47:57,320 --> 02:47:57,800
That's me...

3467
02:47:57,800 --> 02:47:59,480
That's me when I think about going to Japan in summer.

3468
02:47:59,900 --> 02:48:00,340
Ahaha.

3469
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:02,400
Waow, waow.

3470
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:03,580
Waow, waow.

3471
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:04,960
Waow.

3472
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:05,280
Waow.

3473
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:05,780
Waow.

3474
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:06,260
Waow.

3475
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:06,740
Waow.

3476
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:08,080
Waow, waow.

3477
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:09,120
Ou.

3478
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:10,220
Ou.

3479
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:15,960
For some reason, I thought that this would...

3480
02:48:21,450 --> 02:48:24,750
That that was going to be the thing that would open.

3481
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:25,910
Once I press all the switches.

3482
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:26,410
I'm no friend.

3483
02:48:26,410 --> 02:48:27,090
I'm so lost.

3484
02:48:38,820 --> 02:48:40,620
This looks like it could open.

3485
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:47,660
Where am I?

3486
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:57,360
Do you plan on playing the custom Doom 2 level MyHouse.Wad?

3487
02:48:57,860 --> 02:48:59,420
People have asked about it.

3488
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:04,260
Oh!

3489
02:49:05,320 --> 02:49:08,560
I am not going to say no.

3490
02:49:08,900 --> 02:49:09,680
Oh my gosh.

3491
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:15,200
Because I don't really have a reason to say no.

3492
02:49:15,320 --> 02:49:17,880
I just don't have any plans to play it right now.

3493
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:19,900
Like to give a definitive like...

3494
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:22,400
Oh yeah, I'm going to play it next week kind of deal, you know.

3495
02:49:26,580 --> 02:49:27,020
Run.

3496
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:28,320
Run.

3497
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:33,040
Run from the lost soul.

3498
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:34,240
Please!

3499
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:36,060
Just come up here!

3500
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:36,480
Please!

3501
02:49:47,550 --> 02:49:48,570
My favorite enemy.

3502
02:49:50,210 --> 02:49:50,670
Absolutely.

3503
02:49:53,130 --> 02:49:53,590
Hmm.

3504
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:54,690
How do we get to there?

3505
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:55,990
Curious.

3506
02:49:57,250 --> 02:49:58,010
Oh, interesting.

3507
02:50:00,430 --> 02:50:00,890
Hmm.

3508
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:04,650
How do we get there?

3509
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:05,250
To get the sphere?

3510
02:50:06,370 --> 02:50:07,710
Trying to save up to visit Japan.

3511
02:50:07,930 --> 02:50:09,150
What should I book first?

3512
02:50:09,250 --> 02:50:10,170
My flight or a hotel?

3513
02:50:10,390 --> 02:50:11,970
I would say book your flight first.

3514
02:50:12,590 --> 02:50:14,370
But also, a lot of...

3515
02:50:14,370 --> 02:50:15,890
I mean, you could always book your hotel first.

3516
02:50:17,090 --> 02:50:19,470
But flights are going to be the most expensive thing.

3517
02:50:19,650 --> 02:50:19,990
So...

3518
02:50:19,990 --> 02:50:21,450
And they fluctuate so much.

3519
02:50:21,470 --> 02:50:23,470
Hotel prices aren't going to fluctuate so much.

3520
02:50:24,670 --> 02:50:26,170
So it's kind of like...

3521
02:50:26,170 --> 02:50:28,090
You know, if you were to...

3522
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:37,780
If you were to get it and like...

3523
02:50:37,780 --> 02:50:42,140
If you were to get to your hotel but those specific dates are super duper expensive.

3524
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:43,440
It would really suck.

3525
02:50:43,780 --> 02:50:43,880
You know?

3526
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:50,460
I do not know hotel prices.

3527
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,020
No, no, no.

3528
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:52,740
I meant the flight prices will fluctuate.

3529
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:53,760
Not the hotel.

3530
02:50:53,860 --> 02:50:54,400
Not the hotel.

3531
02:50:55,340 --> 02:50:56,940
The hotel prices are pretty...

3532
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:57,060
Yeah.

3533
02:50:57,640 --> 02:50:58,420
Now that...

3534
02:50:58,420 --> 02:51:01,640
Now hoping that somebody makes a mint mugshot mod for Doom.

3535
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:06,100
Yeah.

3536
02:51:07,400 --> 02:51:07,840
But...

3537
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:09,080
Hmm.

3538
02:51:09,440 --> 02:51:10,540
How do you get to that door?

3539
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:13,720
Okay.

3540
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:14,160
Now...

3541
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:15,400
We hit the thing.

3542
02:51:15,660 --> 02:51:16,260
Oh.

3543
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:17,080
We have the yellow key.

3544
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:17,500
That's right.

3545
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:22,380
The yellow key was...

3546
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:25,260
Right.

3547
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:28,700
This is secret room.

3548
02:51:30,700 --> 02:51:32,620
This is room...

3549
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:34,500
To...

3550
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:36,440
Where you need...

3551
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:38,360
The yellow key.

3552
02:51:39,700 --> 02:51:40,520
Right.

3553
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:41,240
No.

3554
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:42,580
Okay.

3555
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:43,280
Okay.

3556
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:44,140
Okay.

3557
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:47,160
Let's try to get over to the exit.

3558
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:47,240
Hold on.

3559
02:51:47,380 --> 02:51:48,080
We'll figure it out.

3560
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:50,840
Yeah.

3561
02:51:50,980 --> 02:51:51,380
See?

3562
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:52,060
I knew it.

3563
02:51:52,120 --> 02:51:53,020
I told you guys.

3564
02:51:53,300 --> 02:51:53,820
What's this?

3565
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:54,860
Oh gosh.

3566
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:04,050
The exit!

3567
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:06,870
The exit?

3568
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:10,130
Is this my Doom or is this the exit?

3569
02:52:12,510 --> 02:52:13,310
The exit?

3570
02:52:15,550 --> 02:52:16,270
Your game plan?

3571
02:52:16,290 --> 02:52:17,350
Gameplay makes me want to play DOOM now.

3572
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:19,290
I don't know if that's a good way or a bad way.

3573
02:52:20,330 --> 02:52:20,730
Okay!

3574
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:28,720
No sphere.

3575
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:29,620
Too bad.

3576
02:52:31,020 --> 02:52:33,040
Only 31% of the items.

3577
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:33,660
That's crazy.

3578
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:36,460
Wait, we got more secrets than we got the items.

3579
02:52:39,980 --> 02:52:40,860
What time is it?

3580
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:41,180
10.

3581
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:42,680
Okay, I have an hour and a half.

3582
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:43,980
Oh, yikes.

3583
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:47,580
Ouch!

3584
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:49,720
Why do these guys never miss?

3585
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:55,160
Red.

3586
02:52:58,300 --> 02:52:59,520
I gotta pick up the pace.

3587
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:01,340
Oh, save?

3588
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:02,140
Yes, thank you.

3589
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:05,740
We're at level 21!

3590
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:09,160
Nice.

3591
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:15,500
Oh, yellow key.

3592
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:18,120
Oh, wowee!

3593
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:18,960
Good job.

3594
02:53:27,790 --> 02:53:28,750
I heard them.

3595
02:53:28,810 --> 02:53:30,190
I heard them to my left and to my right.

3596
02:53:31,650 --> 02:53:32,530
Oh my gosh.

3597
02:53:42,330 --> 02:53:43,210
Where are they?

3598
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,870
They're like down... Oh, wait.

3599
02:53:44,970 --> 02:53:45,590
They're somewhere.

3600
02:53:46,630 --> 02:53:47,610
Oh, they're everywhere.

3601
02:53:47,830 --> 02:53:48,470
Oh my god!

3602
02:53:48,530 --> 02:53:49,090
They're everywhere!

3603
02:53:49,950 --> 02:53:50,730
Don't fall.

3604
02:53:54,910 --> 02:53:57,790
Oh, that wasn't very nice of them.

3605
02:53:58,930 --> 02:54:00,210
Wipe his ass.

3606
02:54:00,510 --> 02:54:02,050
I'm... I'm trying.

3607
02:54:06,170 --> 02:54:09,430
I love sniping with the shotgun.

3608
02:54:21,970 --> 02:54:26,630
This area is really... I don't like it because it's kind of confusing me.

3609
02:54:27,110 --> 02:54:28,230
Can I... Like, I can't tell.

3610
02:54:28,270 --> 02:54:29,470
Can I drop down or what?

3611
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:32,250
And I hear more guys.

3612
02:54:33,210 --> 02:54:34,350
Like, over in here.

3613
02:54:35,050 --> 02:54:36,090
Is this where you're at?

3614
02:54:36,190 --> 02:54:36,390
Oh!

3615
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:38,250
Oh my god!

3616
02:54:39,090 --> 02:54:40,510
There's a big guy in here.

3617
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:44,570
And there's more over there.

3618
02:54:46,170 --> 02:54:47,450
The ground is lava.

3619
02:54:57,130 --> 02:54:58,210
How do I get in there?

3620
02:54:58,850 --> 02:54:59,130
Hmm.

3621
02:55:00,010 --> 02:55:00,810
Guess someday.

3622
02:55:03,530 --> 02:55:04,010
Oh!

3623
02:55:04,030 --> 02:55:04,450
Oh!

3624
02:55:05,230 --> 02:55:05,710
Oh.

3625
02:55:05,810 --> 02:55:06,490
Oh, no.

3626
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:09,350
Okay.

3627
02:55:10,350 --> 02:55:11,310
I'm alive.

3628
02:55:11,630 --> 02:55:11,970
You know what?

3629
02:55:12,010 --> 02:55:13,030
Since we have this though...

3630
02:55:13,650 --> 02:55:14,130
Go around.

3631
02:55:14,310 --> 02:55:14,690
Go around.

3632
02:55:14,690 --> 02:55:15,490
Find everything.

3633
02:55:17,810 --> 02:55:18,670
Go around.

3634
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:19,170
Go around.

3635
02:55:20,050 --> 02:55:21,210
There's another portal.

3636
02:55:22,070 --> 02:55:23,870
Oh, there's not much...

3637
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:25,010
Never mind.

3638
02:55:25,150 --> 02:55:25,410
There's...

3639
02:55:25,410 --> 02:55:26,030
Wait.

3640
02:55:26,150 --> 02:55:26,590
Over here.

3641
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:28,190
There's an arrow.

3642
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:30,390
There's not much going on in here.

3643
02:55:30,570 --> 02:55:30,890
Green.

3644
02:55:32,610 --> 02:55:33,130
Woo!

3645
02:55:34,770 --> 02:55:35,290
Secret.

3646
02:55:44,620 --> 02:55:45,860
I can't hit him.

3647
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:46,560
I don't think.

3648
02:55:51,450 --> 02:55:52,570
Uh... Here?

3649
02:55:53,690 --> 02:55:55,410
Oh, they all lead to the same spot.

3650
02:55:57,390 --> 02:55:57,950
Green.

3651
02:55:58,170 --> 02:55:59,010
Mental vision.

3652
02:56:10,560 --> 02:56:11,120
Oh.

3653
02:56:13,320 --> 02:56:13,880
Oh.

3654
02:56:14,020 --> 02:56:16,600
Good thing I was far, far away from that wall.

3655
02:56:20,360 --> 02:56:21,680
There we go.

3656
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:22,660
Got him, boys.

3657
02:56:24,580 --> 02:56:25,980
But how... I can't...

3658
02:56:25,980 --> 02:56:28,500
Okay, so running across that is kind of useless.

3659
02:56:29,240 --> 02:56:30,820
Maybe something in here.

3660
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:38,440
Who turned off the green?

3661
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:40,640
Thank goodness they turned off the green.

3662
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:41,500
My eyes.

3663
02:56:44,020 --> 02:56:46,560
This is what it's like living with ectoplasm.

3664
02:56:48,340 --> 02:56:48,940
Green.

3665
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:51,200
Button.

3666
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:54,380
I don't understand this level...

3667
02:56:55,900 --> 02:56:56,800
design at all.

3668
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:58,740
I think.

3669
02:56:59,060 --> 02:57:00,340
I think I'm really confused.

3670
02:57:02,060 --> 02:57:02,540
Wait.

3671
02:57:08,630 --> 02:57:09,850
That's where we came from.

3672
02:57:13,050 --> 02:57:14,370
Are you enjoying the game so far?

3673
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:14,850
It's so much fun!

3674
02:57:17,610 --> 02:57:21,090
And both teleporters took me to the same place?

3675
02:57:32,150 --> 02:57:33,910
This one is pretty complicated.

3676
02:57:33,910 --> 02:57:33,990
Okay.

3677
02:57:34,070 --> 02:57:34,570
Hmm.

3678
02:57:35,810 --> 02:57:37,770
Is it this area or...

3679
02:57:37,770 --> 02:57:38,070
Okay.

3680
02:57:38,270 --> 02:57:39,850
This is probably a dumb idea.

3681
02:57:40,850 --> 02:57:41,670
Is it here?

3682
02:57:42,870 --> 02:57:43,390
Ah!

3683
02:57:43,530 --> 02:57:44,290
Wait, no!

3684
02:57:44,330 --> 02:57:45,230
This is just a hole!

3685
02:57:46,510 --> 02:57:48,250
It is a place!

3686
02:57:48,790 --> 02:57:50,530
Just not the correct place!

3687
02:57:52,830 --> 02:57:54,050
Wait, up there even?

3688
02:57:54,190 --> 02:57:55,050
Oh no, it's just fire.

3689
02:57:56,550 --> 02:57:57,570
Just a hole.

3690
02:58:01,330 --> 02:58:03,630
Maybe I should run over...

3691
02:58:03,630 --> 02:58:04,310
Okay, I'm gonna try.

3692
02:58:04,810 --> 02:58:05,470
Yeah!

3693
02:58:05,930 --> 02:58:06,490
Oh!

3694
02:58:09,710 --> 02:58:10,730
I did it.

3695
02:58:16,030 --> 02:58:18,370
Dang, I thought I could snipe that guy from...

3696
02:58:18,370 --> 02:58:18,870
Oh.

3697
02:58:22,630 --> 02:58:23,290
Yeah.

3698
02:58:25,230 --> 02:58:25,890
Okay.

3699
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:26,650
Okay.

3700
02:58:29,730 --> 02:58:29,910
Okay.

3701
02:58:30,350 --> 02:58:30,950
Okay.

3702
02:58:30,950 --> 02:58:31,490
Okay.

3703
02:58:31,490 --> 02:58:31,510
Okay.

3704
02:58:32,270 --> 02:58:33,890
I just wanted to get rid of him.

3705
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:35,810
In any way possible.

3706
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:36,870
Wait.

3707
02:58:37,050 --> 02:58:37,970
Oh my gosh.

3708
02:58:38,150 --> 02:58:38,490
Yeah!

3709
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:44,080
Okay.

3710
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:44,460
Cool.

3711
02:58:45,100 --> 02:58:45,740
Oh!

3712
02:58:45,740 --> 02:58:46,060
Whoa!

3713
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:46,400
Wait.

3714
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:49,220
Okay.

3715
02:58:49,580 --> 02:58:49,880
Yeah...

3716
02:58:51,780 --> 02:58:52,980
Double kill.

3717
02:58:54,480 --> 02:58:55,500
Double kill.

3718
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:58,260
I'm the doomed eye.

3719
02:58:58,280 --> 02:59:00,260
What's the point of going up here?

3720
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:03,200
There is nothing here!

3721
02:59:05,820 --> 02:59:06,340
Right?

3722
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:08,060
I'm not just blind, am I?

3723
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:12,600
There's nothing here.

3724
02:59:18,250 --> 02:59:18,770
Okay.

3725
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:22,770
Keep looking?

3726
02:59:26,570 --> 02:59:27,950
Oh, I have to go the other way.

3727
02:59:28,530 --> 02:59:29,050
Lampy!

3728
02:59:29,150 --> 02:59:30,190
Thanks for another gift.

3729
02:59:30,210 --> 02:59:30,890
Thank you!

3730
02:59:33,450 --> 02:59:34,490
Keep looking.

3731
02:59:34,490 --> 02:59:34,630
Keep looking.

3732
02:59:38,690 --> 02:59:41,930
The music is making me feel clownish.

3733
02:59:46,990 --> 02:59:49,090
I'm looking to see if there's anything I can shoot?

3734
02:59:55,070 --> 02:59:56,590
I don't see anything though!

3735
03:00:01,730 --> 03:00:03,370
I don't see anything.

3736
03:00:04,450 --> 03:00:06,570
I think I've gone bonkers.

3737
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:10,550
I'll take that!

3738
03:00:11,790 --> 03:00:12,590
But nothing!

3739
03:00:12,810 --> 03:00:13,110
Wow!

3740
03:00:13,250 --> 03:00:13,870
Oh my gosh!

3741
03:00:13,970 --> 03:00:14,270
Free!

3742
03:00:15,050 --> 03:00:15,870
Free blueberry!

3743
03:00:16,570 --> 03:00:17,790
No strings attached!

3744
03:00:19,970 --> 03:00:20,610
Let's go!

3745
03:00:22,050 --> 03:00:23,130
Free blueberry!

3746
03:00:23,310 --> 03:00:24,070
No strings attached!

3747
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:31,070
I think there's what?

3748
03:00:33,070 --> 03:00:35,490
24 levels or something in this game?

3749
03:00:35,810 --> 03:00:36,970
24 or 25?

3750
03:00:37,430 --> 03:00:39,190
I don't remember what you guys told me.

3751
03:00:39,590 --> 03:00:40,650
We're on 21.

3752
03:00:41,310 --> 03:00:45,910
It could be that because these levels get way more complicated, I won't be able to finish today.

3753
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:46,470
But...

3754
03:00:46,470 --> 03:00:48,350
I'm gonna do my darndest.

3755
03:00:49,710 --> 03:00:56,170
You said nothing here and it echoed in my mind as by a phantasmal Russian.

3756
03:00:56,390 --> 03:00:57,530
I do it all the time!

3757
03:00:58,230 --> 03:00:59,470
Nothing here.

3758
03:01:04,010 --> 03:01:04,650
I'm...

3759
03:01:04,650 --> 03:01:05,930
Maybe I just run.

3760
03:01:06,190 --> 03:01:07,330
Wait, no, there's...

3761
03:01:07,990 --> 03:01:08,950
Do I...

3762
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:11,630
Oh, there we go.

3763
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:12,110
Okay.

3764
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:19,160
This area is nice and all, but there's nothing here.

3765
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:20,320
Oh, here we go.

3766
03:01:20,900 --> 03:01:21,300
Oh!

3767
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:24,180
Wait, hold on a second.

3768
03:01:26,460 --> 03:01:27,520
Okay, never mind.

3769
03:01:34,340 --> 03:01:35,660
I figured it out.

3770
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:37,180
All on my own.

3771
03:01:38,400 --> 03:01:41,400
Using my brain and my brain alone.

3772
03:01:42,520 --> 03:01:44,020
25 normal levels.

3773
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:45,760
Oh, I thought it was 24.

3774
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:46,960
Also...

3775
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:48,440
Wait.

3776
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:51,040
I need a red...

3777
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:52,220
I don't know actually.

3778
03:01:58,570 --> 03:01:59,450
Oh my gosh.

3779
03:01:59,650 --> 03:02:01,650
This is the worst place to be stuck with you.

3780
03:02:02,110 --> 03:02:03,470
It's so narrow.

3781
03:02:10,450 --> 03:02:11,590
As expected of Minto.

3782
03:02:14,350 --> 03:02:16,010
That looks like a door.

3783
03:02:18,430 --> 03:02:18,950
Okay.

3784
03:02:19,130 --> 03:02:20,610
Oh, this looks like a door.

3785
03:02:22,890 --> 03:02:24,070
Actual jail.

3786
03:02:24,570 --> 03:02:25,510
Real jail.

3787
03:02:29,910 --> 03:02:30,710
Idiot.

3788
03:02:36,430 --> 03:02:38,290
Box of rockets.

3789
03:02:39,210 --> 03:02:40,610
Did it open up now?

3790
03:02:40,810 --> 03:02:41,010
No.

3791
03:02:43,730 --> 03:02:44,930
Horny jail.

3792
03:02:45,810 --> 03:02:47,150
Oh my god.

3793
03:02:48,890 --> 03:02:50,430
I sure hope not.

3794
03:02:51,350 --> 03:02:52,150
Oh, there we go.

3795
03:02:53,370 --> 03:02:54,750
I don't want him thinking of me.

3796
03:02:57,430 --> 03:02:57,830
Wait.

3797
03:02:58,330 --> 03:03:00,410
So things are opening up and it's...

3798
03:03:00,410 --> 03:03:01,750
Oh gosh, this map, man.

3799
03:03:02,350 --> 03:03:03,610
This is where we just came from.

3800
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:05,010
Yeah.

3801
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:06,850
And then we went this way.

3802
03:03:08,590 --> 03:03:09,970
And we can go...

3803
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:11,210
Oh, wait.

3804
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:18,570
This looks like an awfully bad idea.

3805
03:03:20,070 --> 03:03:21,390
I don't think I can go there.

3806
03:03:28,740 --> 03:03:29,580
What is that?

3807
03:03:31,080 --> 03:03:32,400
Oh, I got an area map.

3808
03:03:32,680 --> 03:03:33,260
Oh my gosh.

3809
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:34,640
Wait.

3810
03:03:37,740 --> 03:03:38,480
No, wait.

3811
03:03:38,580 --> 03:03:39,620
I don't think I want that.

3812
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:40,360
Uh oh.

3813
03:03:40,420 --> 03:03:40,920
Wait a second.

3814
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:45,480
I don't think I want an area map because I want to know where I have not been before.

3815
03:03:46,860 --> 03:03:48,780
I don't know if I am a fan of that.

3816
03:03:57,260 --> 03:04:03,880
Oh my gosh, stop roaring in my ear!

3817
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:06,120
I don't like this RP anymore!

3818
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:10,760
Stop roaring in my ear!

3819
03:04:19,550 --> 03:04:20,370
Nice.

3820
03:04:22,090 --> 03:04:23,450
Oh, it opened!

3821
03:04:25,010 --> 03:04:25,830
Here!

3822
03:04:26,990 --> 03:04:27,810
Okay.

3823
03:04:30,610 --> 03:04:30,970
Ew!

3824
03:04:30,970 --> 03:04:31,330
What?

3825
03:04:31,850 --> 03:04:32,550
What was that?

3826
03:04:41,930 --> 03:04:43,010
Did it open in here?

3827
03:04:44,590 --> 03:04:45,930
No, I think down here.

3828
03:04:46,630 --> 03:04:47,250
Oh my god!

3829
03:04:47,350 --> 03:04:47,770
Oh my god!

3830
03:04:47,870 --> 03:04:48,490
Oh my god!

3831
03:04:48,550 --> 03:04:49,050
Oh my god!

3832
03:04:49,050 --> 03:04:49,590
Oh my god!

3833
03:04:49,670 --> 03:04:49,790
Oh my god!

3834
03:04:49,810 --> 03:04:50,030
Oh my god!

3835
03:04:50,330 --> 03:04:51,690
Oh, that was really bad.

3836
03:04:51,810 --> 03:04:52,390
That was really bad.

3837
03:05:03,360 --> 03:05:03,720
Yikes!

3838
03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:07,520
I thought... Whoa!

3839
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:10,520
Whoa!

3840
03:05:10,520 --> 03:05:12,940
That's quite the room for the blue key!

3841
03:05:17,090 --> 03:05:18,690
We're just gonna do that.

3842
03:05:20,870 --> 03:05:21,970
There we go!

3843
03:05:22,250 --> 03:05:23,550
I don't think there's anything... yeah.

3844
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:24,270
Okay.

3845
03:05:26,690 --> 03:05:27,650
I don't trust.

3846
03:05:27,950 --> 03:05:28,750
I have no trust.

3847
03:05:29,330 --> 03:05:30,530
I do not trust.

3848
03:05:30,670 --> 03:05:31,330
I have no trust.

3849
03:05:31,570 --> 03:05:32,550
I do not trust.

3850
03:05:32,610 --> 03:05:33,310
I have no trust.

3851
03:05:33,410 --> 03:05:34,090
I do not trust.

3852
03:05:34,250 --> 03:05:35,410
I have no trust.

3853
03:05:47,980 --> 03:05:48,460
Ouch!

3854
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:48,840
Ouch!

3855
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:50,980
I might just reset.

3856
03:05:51,820 --> 03:05:52,960
I might just reset.

3857
03:05:58,360 --> 03:05:59,080
What am I?

3858
03:05:59,940 --> 03:06:01,980
I'm... I'm hard of seeing.

3859
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:03,000
That's what I am.

3860
03:06:03,800 --> 03:06:04,860
How do I grab you?

3861
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:06,460
Wait, I can't see anything.

3862
03:06:06,820 --> 03:06:07,320
Okay, hold on.

3863
03:06:08,760 --> 03:06:10,380
I'm gonna... I'm gonna reload.

3864
03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:11,240
Sorry, guys.

3865
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:13,820
Oh, that's the invincible!

3866
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,200
I'm bulletproof!

3867
03:06:20,060 --> 03:06:21,740
Nothing to lose!

3868
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:24,200
Fire away!

3869
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:26,140
Fire away!

3870
03:06:27,220 --> 03:06:28,140
Ricochet!

3871
03:06:29,060 --> 03:06:31,040
You take your aim!

3872
03:06:31,980 --> 03:06:33,340
Fire away!

3873
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:35,120
Fire away!

3874
03:06:35,900 --> 03:06:37,740
You shoot me down!

3875
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:39,820
But I won't fall!

3876
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:43,020
I am titanium!

3877
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:46,680
You shoot me down!

3878
03:06:47,060 --> 03:06:48,420
But I won't fall!

3879
03:06:49,960 --> 03:06:52,000
I am titanium!

3880
03:06:52,780 --> 03:06:55,020
Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow.

3881
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:57,700
Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow.

3882
03:06:57,900 --> 03:06:58,580
Oof.

3883
03:07:01,780 --> 03:07:05,480
I said I wasn't gonna do many karaoke.

3884
03:07:06,080 --> 03:07:08,060
Because I'm trying to, like, rest my voice.

3885
03:07:08,340 --> 03:07:09,900
Oh, I don't need those either.

3886
03:07:09,900 --> 03:07:13,020
Trying to rest my voice for, like, the concert and stuff.

3887
03:07:14,540 --> 03:07:15,120
Um...

3888
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:17,300
But...

3889
03:07:18,040 --> 03:07:21,120
I just felt like doing it this week because I don't...

3890
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:23,240
I'm not feeling so well.

3891
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:27,780
And doing karaoke cheers me up even if it's just silly music.

3892
03:07:27,860 --> 03:07:28,620
Silly songs.

3893
03:07:29,080 --> 03:07:30,080
Wait, there's a concert?

3894
03:07:30,220 --> 03:07:30,440
Yeah!

3895
03:07:30,540 --> 03:07:31,380
I have a concert!

3896
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:33,920
During Anime Expo.

3897
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:35,740
Virtual vacation!

3898
03:07:37,720 --> 03:07:41,140
It's not at Anime Expo, but it's during the weekend.

3899
03:07:42,940 --> 03:07:43,580
Yes!

3900
03:07:43,580 --> 03:07:44,220
Resave.

3901
03:07:46,940 --> 03:07:47,820
Okay, cool.

3902
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:51,840
Where was...

3903
03:08:08,780 --> 03:08:10,560
Oh my god, that scared me.

3904
03:08:10,880 --> 03:08:12,020
Synapse, thank you!

3905
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:13,560
Oh my god.

3906
03:08:13,560 --> 03:08:15,520
I thought I heard, like, whispering.

3907
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:16,700
It freaked me out.

3908
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:18,180
It was my own voice.

3909
03:08:20,200 --> 03:08:21,360
Thank you so much.

3910
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:24,020
I was like...

3911
03:08:24,820 --> 03:08:25,680
Oh, here it is.

3912
03:08:27,400 --> 03:08:28,240
Another one?

3913
03:08:28,480 --> 03:08:29,780
You are so unoriginal.

3914
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:31,660
I like the... I like your...

3915
03:08:31,660 --> 03:08:33,840
I like the guy outside the door better.

3916
03:08:56,290 --> 03:08:56,770
Oh...

3917
03:08:57,410 --> 03:08:57,890
Oh...

3918
03:08:59,330 --> 03:09:00,850
I don't know what else to expect.

3919
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:06,500
Where do I go?

3920
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:11,180
Wait, is this new?

3921
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:15,220
Is this new?

3922
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:21,400
Oh, this is where I came from, isn't it?

3923
03:09:24,780 --> 03:09:25,160
Save?

3924
03:09:25,420 --> 03:09:26,100
Yeah, you're right.

3925
03:09:27,440 --> 03:09:29,000
You're so right.

3926
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:30,600
Okay.

3927
03:09:35,260 --> 03:09:37,600
It opened something somewhere.

3928
03:09:39,780 --> 03:09:40,340
Somewhere...

3929
03:09:43,300 --> 03:09:44,400
Maybe in here?

3930
03:09:45,380 --> 03:09:47,160
No, that has not opened yet.

3931
03:09:47,460 --> 03:09:47,980
Okay.

3932
03:09:48,780 --> 03:09:51,060
But we're keeping that in the back of our brains.

3933
03:09:56,100 --> 03:09:57,860
I think I'm going too far away.

3934
03:09:58,240 --> 03:09:58,600
Haha.

3935
03:09:58,600 --> 03:10:00,820
Horny jail unchanged.

3936
03:10:01,700 --> 03:10:03,100
Oh, this map.

3937
03:10:04,370 --> 03:10:05,520
Sounds like people...

3938
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:07,420
Maybe this is a bit of an infamous map.

3939
03:10:08,310 --> 03:10:09,420
Due to how...

3940
03:10:11,780 --> 03:10:13,820
Complicated it is.

3941
03:10:18,430 --> 03:10:19,160
In here.

3942
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:20,880
No.

3943
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:23,780
Quite changed.

3944
03:10:25,460 --> 03:10:26,680
I don't think any...

3945
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:28,080
I don't see anything over there.

3946
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:29,120
Wait, here?

3947
03:10:31,740 --> 03:10:33,620
No, I just made a circle.

3948
03:10:33,840 --> 03:10:34,660
What changed?

3949
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:38,620
Oh my goodness.

3950
03:10:39,780 --> 03:10:42,280
I'm as zoomed out as I can be.

3951
03:10:47,780 --> 03:10:51,220
I hope there's nothing alive around here.

3952
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:52,540
Maybe down here.

3953
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:54,480
No.

3954
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:55,020
Hahaha.

3955
03:10:57,280 --> 03:10:58,160
Blue door?

3956
03:10:58,360 --> 03:10:58,880
That's where...

3957
03:10:58,880 --> 03:11:00,240
That's where we just came from though.

3958
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:03,920
And we...

3959
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:06,180
Flipped the switch that is now gone.

3960
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:07,720
And something opened up.

3961
03:11:09,900 --> 03:11:11,660
Yeah, we're still missing a red key.

3962
03:11:12,100 --> 03:11:12,660
Um...

3963
03:11:15,500 --> 03:11:18,220
Unless we go back to the main area but...

3964
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:19,020
I don't know.

3965
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:20,700
Maybe...

3966
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:21,520
Haha.

3967
03:11:21,640 --> 03:11:22,180
Huh?

3968
03:11:22,300 --> 03:11:22,860
Hahaha.

3969
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:25,660
Oh, that's a lamp.

3970
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:26,180
Oh, that's a lamp.

3971
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:30,020
Ah, maybe we go back to the main area.

3972
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,120
Oh.

3973
03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:40,380
Did this lift up?

3974
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:40,800
No.

3975
03:11:42,620 --> 03:11:43,160
Ehhhh.

3976
03:11:45,360 --> 03:11:45,900
Ehhhh.

3977
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:48,420
Ehhh.

3978
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:48,680
Hahaha.

3979
03:11:51,560 --> 03:11:52,540
I am now...

3980
03:11:52,540 --> 03:11:53,900
Oh, there's the red key over there.

3981
03:11:53,900 --> 03:11:54,580
There, you can see it.

3982
03:11:56,780 --> 03:11:59,080
You need to go back to the main area for the red key.

3983
03:12:01,340 --> 03:12:02,340
Yeah, I'm here.

3984
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:11,420
Oh, wait.

3985
03:12:14,340 --> 03:12:15,780
Oh, maybe I lifted up this part.

3986
03:12:16,780 --> 03:12:17,440
Never mind.

3987
03:12:19,340 --> 03:12:20,580
Don't tell me anything.

3988
03:12:28,910 --> 03:12:29,890
I cracked my statement.

3989
03:12:35,790 --> 03:12:36,610
Also, armor.

3990
03:12:36,770 --> 03:12:37,530
I did see it.

3991
03:12:37,570 --> 03:12:38,490
I did see the armor.

3992
03:12:41,250 --> 03:12:41,650
Okay.

3993
03:12:44,950 --> 03:12:45,350
Nice!

3994
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,370
Nice, nice.

3995
03:12:47,530 --> 03:12:48,170
I don't know.

3996
03:12:48,270 --> 03:12:49,770
I think if I get the armor...

3997
03:12:50,670 --> 03:12:52,250
I do need it though, don't I?

3998
03:12:53,590 --> 03:12:54,670
I do need it.

3999
03:12:57,050 --> 03:13:00,550
Wait, we can try again.

4000
03:13:02,550 --> 03:13:03,470
We can try again.

4001
03:13:03,970 --> 03:13:04,630
I think.

4002
03:13:05,630 --> 03:13:06,910
I do need it though.

4003
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:14,120
Nice!

4004
03:13:17,180 --> 03:13:20,360
Lost a little bit of health, but maybe it was worth it.

4005
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:22,960
Okay, now we go back...

4006
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:25,580
Oh, to that one room.

4007
03:13:27,640 --> 03:13:29,360
Oh my gosh, I keep going the wrong way.

4008
03:13:29,900 --> 03:13:33,620
We go back to the one door that had the yellow and the red, right?

4009
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:34,280
I believe.

4010
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:36,680
Phew!

4011
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:37,440
Phew!

4012
03:13:37,640 --> 03:13:38,140
Phew!

4013
03:13:38,820 --> 03:13:40,120
Speed run!

4014
03:13:41,820 --> 03:13:43,560
It was right here.

4015
03:13:44,760 --> 03:13:45,400
What?

4016
03:13:46,140 --> 03:13:46,780
What do you mean?

4017
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:48,100
What do you mean?

4018
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:50,180
What are you talking about?

4019
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:51,800
Maybe I shoot this.

4020
03:13:53,900 --> 03:13:54,420
Ah ha!

4021
03:13:54,700 --> 03:13:55,100
Wow!

4022
03:13:55,860 --> 03:13:56,500
Ah!

4023
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:00,860
You jerk.

4024
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:07,400
Maybe... this was nothing all along.

4025
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:12,600
Thank you.

4026
03:14:18,540 --> 03:14:19,480
Sorry,

4027
03:14:22,560 --> 03:14:23,760
I swallowed my spit wrong.

4028
03:14:25,700 --> 03:14:26,160
Um...

4029
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:30,320
Oh, I picked up a clip.

4030
03:14:31,120 --> 03:14:33,240
Were there any other red areas?

4031
03:14:38,820 --> 03:14:41,500
Yeah, I already have a plasma gun.

4032
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:42,140
No worries.

4033
03:14:45,140 --> 03:14:48,020
Besides there, were there any other red doors?

4034
03:15:02,460 --> 03:15:02,980
Ugh.

4035
03:15:04,800 --> 03:15:08,180
Look at all these squirming, squishy...

4036
03:15:09,740 --> 03:15:11,900
I'm not so sure, guys.

4037
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:12,920
I'm not so sure.

4038
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:16,780
Where'd it go?

4039
03:15:18,880 --> 03:15:20,560
This says nothing in here.

4040
03:15:20,680 --> 03:15:21,680
Nothing here.

4041
03:15:23,300 --> 03:15:27,620
Did you hear about the redneck couple that found the blind newborn deer?

4042
03:15:29,100 --> 03:15:31,600
Scientists came to see if it was a new species.

4043
03:15:32,140 --> 03:15:34,440
Said if they named it, they could keep it.

4044
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:37,160
The wife said, that's a bad eye-deer.

4045
03:15:42,720 --> 03:15:43,640
Eye-deer...

4046
03:15:50,680 --> 03:15:51,140
Um...

4047
03:15:55,300 --> 03:15:56,800
I took so...

4048
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:59,020
I took damage from that one.

4049
03:16:01,220 --> 03:16:03,340
I think I took da- wait, what's in there?

4050
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:05,380
I think I took damage from that one.

4051
03:16:06,660 --> 03:16:08,320
I love and hate it.

4052
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:12,400
That's a... that's a bad eye-deer.

4053
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:14,600
I get it.

4054
03:16:16,580 --> 03:16:17,700
I get it.

4055
03:16:17,780 --> 03:16:18,500
I get it.

4056
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:26,200
Yeah, see, there seems to be stuff inside.

4057
03:16:30,740 --> 03:16:32,480
Guys, I'm not so sure.

4058
03:16:35,040 --> 03:16:36,080
I'm not so sure.

4059
03:16:36,200 --> 03:16:37,820
I know where to go, what to do.

4060
03:16:37,980 --> 03:16:38,840
We got the red key.

4061
03:16:39,780 --> 03:16:41,820
I know that there was a...

4062
03:16:42,600 --> 03:16:45,400
I wonder if the door... actually, hold on, let's check the door.

4063
03:16:45,540 --> 03:16:46,740
Because there was a... there was a...

4064
03:16:47,520 --> 03:16:49,640
Door at the very, very beginning, wasn't there?

4065
03:16:49,960 --> 03:16:50,560
I think.

4066
03:16:52,120 --> 03:16:53,720
But we've been locked out.

4067
03:16:54,320 --> 03:16:55,620
Yes, it's open.

4068
03:16:57,980 --> 03:16:58,580
Here, here.

4069
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:00,160
Wait, is this the exit?

4070
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:06,140
The game is not so kind.

4071
03:17:06,840 --> 03:17:09,860
Well, maybe that opened it.

4072
03:17:10,780 --> 03:17:11,260
Maybe.

4073
03:17:11,260 --> 03:17:11,740
Okay.

4074
03:17:13,480 --> 03:17:13,960
Okay.

4075
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:20,620
I thought that was gonna be the exit, which is why I hadn't gone back to it, but...

4076
03:17:20,620 --> 03:17:21,360
Aha!

4077
03:17:21,660 --> 03:17:21,960
Oh!

4078
03:17:23,660 --> 03:17:24,940
Of course you're here.

4079
03:17:25,420 --> 03:17:29,280
Of course you're here to ruin my day, to ruin my time, to ruin my moment.

4080
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:34,340
You're just here to be like...

4081
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:36,120
Oh, this is all about me.

4082
03:17:36,220 --> 03:17:37,940
It's not all about you, Mr. Baron.

4083
03:17:38,180 --> 03:17:39,260
It's not all about you.

4084
03:17:40,580 --> 03:17:41,560
Into the void!

4085
03:17:49,200 --> 03:17:49,920
Minty sweat!

4086
03:17:50,680 --> 03:17:51,440
Welcome back.

4087
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:54,920
Not that many secrets.

4088
03:17:56,020 --> 03:17:56,820
Burnt offerings.

4089
03:18:01,990 --> 03:18:04,830
Oh, the sky is literally just on fire now.

4090
03:18:08,690 --> 03:18:09,290
Oh!

4091
03:18:10,030 --> 03:18:11,190
That's really exciting.

4092
03:18:15,090 --> 03:18:15,850
I think

4093
03:18:19,710 --> 03:18:20,250
I'm hitting it.

4094
03:18:20,350 --> 03:18:21,190
Oh, yes I am.

4095
03:18:22,810 --> 03:18:25,030
Take that, spitter.

4096
03:18:27,410 --> 03:18:30,790
Oh, I thought that was a web or a bad guy.

4097
03:18:34,630 --> 03:18:35,110
Okay.

4098
03:18:35,750 --> 03:18:36,390
All right.

4099
03:18:36,470 --> 03:18:36,690
Run.

4100
03:18:38,890 --> 03:18:39,830
Oh, my God!

4101
03:18:41,570 --> 03:18:42,410
Oh, my God!

4102
03:18:43,570 --> 03:18:44,530
Oh, please!

4103
03:18:44,670 --> 03:18:44,930
Please!

4104
03:18:45,090 --> 03:18:45,870
I think I...

4105
03:18:45,870 --> 03:18:46,090
Wait!

4106
03:18:46,150 --> 03:18:46,490
Hold on!

4107
03:18:46,610 --> 03:18:48,030
I accidentally hit Caps Lock!

4108
03:18:52,820 --> 03:18:59,060
Guys, I accidentally hit Caps Lock, which in turn turned off my running for a brief moment.

4109
03:19:06,400 --> 03:19:06,800
Save.

4110
03:19:07,240 --> 03:19:07,920
Oh, gosh.

4111
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:09,100
I should have done that way before.

4112
03:19:09,300 --> 03:19:09,800
Shouldn't I?

4113
03:19:12,280 --> 03:19:12,680
Oopsie!

4114
03:19:14,080 --> 03:19:15,240
I should have done that before.

4115
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:17,920
It's fine.

4116
03:19:20,800 --> 03:19:21,200
Maybe.

4117
03:19:26,340 --> 03:19:26,740
Okay.

4118
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:26,980
Hold on.

4119
03:19:32,400 --> 03:19:33,480
Look at the sky.

4120
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:34,200
Gosh!

4121
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:36,480
Hell is...

4122
03:19:36,480 --> 03:19:37,160
Oh my God.

4123
03:19:37,160 --> 03:19:37,320
Oh my god.

4124
03:19:37,380 --> 03:19:39,520
So wonderful this time of year!

4125
03:20:03,420 --> 03:20:06,320
Oh, I think I got these guys... or at least I got one of them before.

4126
03:20:06,520 --> 03:20:08,100
So I completely forgot about it.

4127
03:20:13,580 --> 03:20:15,340
Why are you leaping at me?

4128
03:20:15,980 --> 03:20:16,720
You freak!

4129
03:20:16,720 --> 03:20:16,800
You freak!

4130
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:24,240
Could have been better.

4131
03:20:24,380 --> 03:20:25,080
Could have been worse.

4132
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:29,480
Could have been better.

4133
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:30,040
Could have been worse.

4134
03:20:32,560 --> 03:20:33,400
Excuse you.

4135
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:36,240
Trying to find all these things around here.

4136
03:20:36,420 --> 03:20:37,560
Oh my god, the chainsaw!

4137
03:20:41,020 --> 03:20:41,860
And berserk.

4138
03:20:54,210 --> 03:20:55,630
Come here little pickle!

4139
03:20:58,070 --> 03:20:58,990
Pinky pickle!

4140
03:21:01,090 --> 03:21:02,930
A chainsaw, what?

4141
03:21:03,910 --> 03:21:05,530
A chainsaw, what?

4142
03:21:05,770 --> 03:21:07,970
A mother trucking chainsaw, what?

4143
03:21:09,870 --> 03:21:11,170
So come and get it.

4144
03:21:15,860 --> 03:21:17,540
What does the orb do?

4145
03:21:18,700 --> 03:21:19,840
What does the pearl do?

4146
03:21:36,890 --> 03:21:39,030
Mega health and armor!

4147
03:21:39,370 --> 03:21:40,090
Oh boy!

4148
03:21:41,010 --> 03:21:41,690
200!

4149
03:21:41,850 --> 03:21:42,150
200!

4150
03:21:42,570 --> 03:21:43,910
Wait, I thought it was...

4151
03:21:43,910 --> 03:21:45,010
What's in here?

4152
03:21:45,870 --> 03:21:46,910
Okay, hold on.

4153
03:21:48,030 --> 03:21:49,010
Get ready.

4154
03:21:50,190 --> 03:21:50,870
Oh.

4155
03:21:51,150 --> 03:21:52,730
I can't reach it.

4156
03:21:54,110 --> 03:21:56,170
I was like, okay, here I go!

4157
03:22:00,170 --> 03:22:02,690
I like bread and butter pickles.

4158
03:22:05,910 --> 03:22:06,450
Like...

4159
03:22:09,250 --> 03:22:10,570
What does that entail?

4160
03:22:11,770 --> 03:22:13,310
A bread and butter pickle.

4161
03:22:13,570 --> 03:22:15,330
Like, I've heard of butter pickles before.

4162
03:22:34,770 --> 03:22:38,430
Give me a key or something!

4163
03:22:40,930 --> 03:22:42,350
I don't want your ugly ass!

4164
03:22:44,110 --> 03:22:45,750
Oh, there's a key up there.

4165
03:22:47,250 --> 03:22:48,190
What the...

4166
03:22:48,190 --> 03:22:50,550
You thought you were sneaky, huh?

4167
03:22:57,460 --> 03:22:58,560
Is that a...

4168
03:22:59,160 --> 03:22:59,500
Yes.

4169
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:01,700
A meatball!

4170
03:23:04,940 --> 03:23:05,700
It's a meatball!

4171
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:09,880
You know you've played...

4172
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:15,080
You know you've played too much when you actually can start recognizing like the different...

4173
03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:17,140
The different noises.

4174
03:23:19,220 --> 03:23:21,060
You're like, that's the sound of a...

4175
03:23:21,060 --> 03:23:22,440
Of a meatball!

4176
03:23:29,380 --> 03:23:30,580
Call that fire.

4177
03:23:32,400 --> 03:23:33,180
Look at it.

4178
03:23:36,750 --> 03:23:37,350
Yes.

4179
03:23:37,910 --> 03:23:40,550
Oh my gosh, what a lovely view from the balcony.

4180
03:23:44,230 --> 03:23:45,910
My nose is soft.

4181
03:23:46,130 --> 03:23:47,650
Don't listen to that, actually.

4182
03:23:51,770 --> 03:23:52,590
There we go.

4183
03:23:53,230 --> 03:23:54,550
Taking in all that...

4184
03:23:54,550 --> 03:23:55,490
Smoke.

4185
03:23:56,370 --> 03:23:57,170
Carbon dioxide.

4186
03:23:58,150 --> 03:23:59,610
Very Guy Fieri.

4187
03:24:00,490 --> 03:24:02,370
True, true, true, true.

4188
03:24:03,170 --> 03:24:04,570
He would love this place.

4189
03:24:06,210 --> 03:24:07,750
Do you think he's the devil?

4190
03:24:08,550 --> 03:24:09,290
Wait, where...

4191
03:24:09,290 --> 03:24:10,030
How do I get the blue key?

4192
03:24:16,760 --> 03:24:17,620
It's up there.

4193
03:24:20,020 --> 03:24:21,680
From the window, maybe?

4194
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:26,520
Condiments are...

4195
03:24:26,520 --> 03:24:26,900
Oh, wait.

4196
03:24:31,180 --> 03:24:31,660
No!

4197
03:24:32,020 --> 03:24:32,780
Wait, wait.

4198
03:24:42,340 --> 03:24:43,060
Okay, hold on.

4199
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:44,680
Okay.

4200
03:24:51,280 --> 03:24:52,480
I got it.

4201
03:24:54,020 --> 03:24:56,360
I hope there wasn't anything else up there, actually.

4202
03:24:56,860 --> 03:24:57,660
Wait, hold on.

4203
03:24:57,740 --> 03:24:58,680
Hold on, hold on.

4204
03:24:59,040 --> 03:25:00,140
Let's do it one more time.

4205
03:25:00,240 --> 03:25:00,580
One more time.

4206
03:25:09,240 --> 03:25:10,720
Six minutes before 1130?

4207
03:25:10,860 --> 03:25:11,180
No, no.

4208
03:25:11,260 --> 03:25:12,340
I have one more hour.

4209
03:25:12,820 --> 03:25:13,820
One more hour.

4210
03:25:13,940 --> 03:25:14,360
One more hour.

4211
03:25:14,820 --> 03:25:16,180
But thank you for...

4212
03:25:16,680 --> 03:25:18,360
Thank you for being...

4213
03:25:18,860 --> 03:25:19,340
For...

4214
03:25:19,340 --> 03:25:20,960
For checking.

4215
03:25:21,160 --> 03:25:22,000
I really appreciate it.

4216
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:32,260
Oh, nice.

4217
03:25:37,040 --> 03:25:37,760
Not anymore.

4218
03:25:38,300 --> 03:25:39,560
Anyone else want to attack?

4219
03:25:39,580 --> 03:25:40,060
Test me!

4220
03:25:41,240 --> 03:25:42,100
Test me!

4221
03:25:42,100 --> 03:25:42,400
Hmm...

4222
03:25:43,060 --> 03:25:43,820
Aaaaaa!

4223
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:45,100
Aaa!

4224
03:25:45,240 --> 03:25:46,000
Aaaah!

4225
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:46,360
Aaaaaaaah!

4226
03:25:46,380 --> 03:25:46,780
Aaaah!

4227
03:25:46,860 --> 03:25:47,300
ler

4228
03:25:58,750 --> 03:26:17,020
is my free blueberry after that?

4229
03:26:17,660 --> 03:26:18,420
Where?

4230
03:26:18,580 --> 03:26:20,680
I deserve a blueberry after that.

4231
03:26:20,860 --> 03:26:22,060
After that...

4232
03:26:23,340 --> 03:26:24,100
I don't know.

4233
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:34,600
I deserve a blueberry after that.

4234
03:26:36,420 --> 03:26:37,820
I almost died!

4235
03:26:38,980 --> 03:26:40,680
I almost died!

4236
03:26:40,860 --> 03:26:42,200
You failed the test!

4237
03:26:42,980 --> 03:26:45,940
But how else was I supposed to open the door?

4238
03:26:48,600 --> 03:26:51,620
How else was the door supposed to open?

4239
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:54,700
The pearl is nearby but I can't...

4240
03:26:54,700 --> 03:26:56,540
My legs are too short.

4241
03:27:01,460 --> 03:27:03,480
There was a secret room.

4242
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:04,180
There was?

4243
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:26,400
I'll be back for you.

4244
03:27:31,650 --> 03:27:32,130
Wow!

4245
03:27:33,210 --> 03:27:34,130
That's so awesome!

4246
03:27:34,450 --> 03:27:35,590
Thank you for the birthday!

4247
03:27:36,930 --> 03:27:38,430
Thank you so much!

4248
03:27:38,550 --> 03:27:39,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4249
03:27:42,230 --> 03:27:43,970
You've been a huge inspiration to me.

4250
03:27:44,090 --> 03:27:50,550
I've been working extra hard at getting wax and honey this year in hopes of eventually having something to show off to my Oshii.

4251
03:27:50,630 --> 03:27:51,890
What are you talking about?

4252
03:27:52,290 --> 03:27:57,070
I already think it's so cool that you do the whole bee thing in general.

4253
03:28:00,950 --> 03:28:01,750
That guy...

4254
03:28:02,310 --> 03:28:03,010
Wait a second.

4255
03:28:03,350 --> 03:28:05,330
I was gonna say, this guy looks a little different.

4256
03:28:05,550 --> 03:28:05,990
He looks...

4257
03:28:10,070 --> 03:28:11,870
This guy looks really funky.

4258
03:28:13,170 --> 03:28:14,630
What are you hiding here?

4259
03:28:16,050 --> 03:28:17,170
What are you hiding?

4260
03:28:19,170 --> 03:28:19,970
What are you hiding?

4261
03:28:19,970 --> 03:28:21,910
I think I have to go up to the other...

4262
03:28:21,910 --> 03:28:23,170
I have to go back up there.

4263
03:28:26,610 --> 03:28:27,170
Hold on.

4264
03:28:30,150 --> 03:28:32,210
Oh, there is health here.

4265
03:28:32,290 --> 03:28:32,690
Thank goodness.

4266
03:28:34,390 --> 03:28:36,270
Thank goodness.

4267
03:28:37,250 --> 03:28:38,410
Okay.

4268
03:28:39,290 --> 03:28:39,870
You!

4269
03:28:49,370 --> 03:28:50,530
Blueberry!

4270
03:28:53,530 --> 03:28:54,110
What?

4271
03:28:57,630 --> 03:28:58,210
Wow!

4272
03:29:01,090 --> 03:29:01,690
That...

4273
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:02,770
That guy was...

4274
03:29:02,770 --> 03:29:03,890
I was gonna say he looks...

4275
03:29:03,890 --> 03:29:05,930
Can I come up?

4276
03:29:07,570 --> 03:29:08,950
He looked a little different.

4277
03:29:10,730 --> 03:29:11,970
Now I'm getting greedy.

4278
03:29:14,370 --> 03:29:17,430
Everybody must have a blueberry body.

4279
03:29:19,390 --> 03:29:20,530
There's also this over here.

4280
03:29:20,870 --> 03:29:24,730
This is all water, so I'm assuming if we fall...

4281
03:29:26,370 --> 03:29:27,390
It'll be okay.

4282
03:29:29,650 --> 03:29:30,830
We have a blue key.

4283
03:29:31,250 --> 03:29:32,650
Where was the blue door?

4284
03:29:34,610 --> 03:29:35,290
Over...

4285
03:29:35,290 --> 03:29:36,530
Yon?

4286
03:29:45,270 --> 03:29:47,110
When did this open?

4287
03:29:52,720 --> 03:29:54,460
Is that a spider over there?

4288
03:29:56,320 --> 03:29:57,680
Just gonna...

4289
03:29:57,680 --> 03:29:58,040
Um...

4290
03:29:58,040 --> 03:29:58,980
Phew.

4291
03:30:14,200 --> 03:30:15,120
That was close.

4292
03:30:15,660 --> 03:30:16,700
That was a close one.

4293
03:30:17,940 --> 03:30:19,080
Anyone else in here?

4294
03:30:19,560 --> 03:30:22,920
I'm not gonna ask anybody if they wanna test me ever again because...

4295
03:30:22,920 --> 03:30:24,360
I learned my lesson.

4296
03:30:36,080 --> 03:30:37,340
Coco the demon!

4297
03:30:44,890 --> 03:30:45,950
Coco the demon!

4298
03:30:45,950 --> 03:30:46,050
Yeah.

4299
03:30:48,990 --> 03:30:49,950
Minto ball!

4300
03:30:50,630 --> 03:30:51,110
No!

4301
03:30:52,310 --> 03:30:53,190
We're ball...

4302
03:30:53,190 --> 03:30:54,070
Oh my gosh, I saw...

4303
03:30:54,070 --> 03:30:54,790
Did you guys...

4304
03:30:54,790 --> 03:30:58,750
Do you guys know the Yeti?

4305
03:30:59,230 --> 03:31:00,110
They um...

4306
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:03,770
They make t-shirts and stuff like that.

4307
03:31:03,930 --> 03:31:05,690
And I saw that they put one out today.

4308
03:31:05,830 --> 03:31:07,670
That was just Garfield.

4309
03:31:07,850 --> 03:31:08,650
And it says...

4310
03:31:09,330 --> 03:31:12,910
Sometimes I'm ballin' and it shows Garfield playing b-ball.

4311
03:31:12,910 --> 03:31:14,070
And then it says...

4312
03:31:14,070 --> 03:31:16,890
Or sometimes I'm ballin'.

4313
03:31:16,890 --> 03:31:18,210
And it just shows him crying.

4314
03:31:22,110 --> 03:31:24,030
I was like, Garfield...

4315
03:31:24,030 --> 03:31:25,510
No, Garf!

4316
03:31:25,890 --> 03:31:26,490
Garf!

4317
03:31:29,730 --> 03:31:31,710
Okay, yellow key means...

4318
03:31:31,710 --> 03:31:34,450
Yellow door was...

4319
03:31:36,510 --> 03:31:37,650
Oh, over there!

4320
03:31:39,770 --> 03:31:42,090
I'm going to get the Miku Garfield figure.

4321
03:31:42,530 --> 03:31:44,210
Isn't that a U2's though?

4322
03:31:46,390 --> 03:31:47,130
I'm not...

4323
03:31:48,170 --> 03:31:49,490
I'm not really a fan.

4324
03:31:53,110 --> 03:31:54,470
The U2's are...

4325
03:32:11,380 --> 03:32:12,600
Oh my god!

4326
03:32:13,580 --> 03:32:14,340
Wait, no!

4327
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:15,000
Don't kill me!

4328
03:32:15,060 --> 03:32:15,580
I don't wanna die!

4329
03:32:15,700 --> 03:32:16,760
There was a blueberry right there!

4330
03:32:23,290 --> 03:32:24,450
Every time...

4331
03:32:24,450 --> 03:32:25,510
Not every time.

4332
03:32:25,730 --> 03:32:26,370
Don't be dramatic.

4333
03:32:27,570 --> 03:32:28,310
What?!

4334
03:32:40,420 --> 03:32:42,880
Someone's snoring up a storm in there.

4335
03:32:50,850 --> 03:32:51,780
Oh, I think it was him.

4336
03:32:52,800 --> 03:32:53,820
Oh, just kidding.

4337
03:32:54,770 --> 03:32:56,980
There's more sleepy, lazy guys.

4338
03:32:59,780 --> 03:33:00,520
See?

4339
03:33:01,740 --> 03:33:02,360
Blueberry...

4340
03:33:02,360 --> 03:33:02,880
All good.

4341
03:33:03,100 --> 03:33:03,740
Mint slayer.

4342
03:33:03,800 --> 03:33:04,760
Hater of wisps.

4343
03:33:04,840 --> 03:33:05,860
Protector of Oshis.

4344
03:33:05,940 --> 03:33:06,800
Slay the demons.

4345
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:09,880
I'm not a hater of wisps.

4346
03:33:12,040 --> 03:33:12,660
No...

4347
03:33:12,660 --> 03:33:15,020
Look at these losers in jail.

4348
03:33:22,820 --> 03:33:23,440
What

4349
03:33:32,390 --> 03:33:33,270
is this?

4350
03:33:34,230 --> 03:33:35,570
What is this?

4351
03:33:36,730 --> 03:33:38,370
What's gonna happen in here?

4352
03:33:46,710 --> 03:33:48,290
It's a tarp!

4353
03:33:59,640 --> 03:34:02,540
Is every single one gonna open up?

4354
03:34:02,660 --> 03:34:03,200
Or...

4355
03:34:07,160 --> 03:34:09,720
That's a lot of rockets!

4356
03:34:15,660 --> 03:34:18,020
This is actually...

4357
03:34:18,020 --> 03:34:19,540
Kinda cool.

4358
03:34:24,140 --> 03:34:25,260
Oh, I need to...

4359
03:34:25,260 --> 03:34:26,660
Okay, fine!

4360
03:34:26,680 --> 03:34:27,360
I'll open the door!

4361
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:41,780
They were like...

4362
03:34:41,780 --> 03:34:44,260
Why are you standing inside there, little baby?

4363
03:34:48,650 --> 03:34:51,430
What are you standing inside there for, little baby?

4364
03:34:52,690 --> 03:34:53,570
Little baby...

4365
03:34:54,510 --> 03:34:55,390
Little baby...

4366
03:34:55,990 --> 03:34:56,690
What does that do?

4367
03:34:57,070 --> 03:34:57,910
Oops, wrong one.

4368
03:34:59,810 --> 03:35:01,110
Oh, I gotta open the door.

4369
03:35:03,990 --> 03:35:05,590
Little baby...

4370
03:35:05,590 --> 03:35:06,630
Little baby...

4371
03:35:06,630 --> 03:35:08,670
Don't just stand inside here.

4372
03:35:10,810 --> 03:35:11,610
Nice.

4373
03:35:13,270 --> 03:35:14,070
Okay!

4374
03:35:14,290 --> 03:35:15,430
Red key acquired!

4375
03:35:16,510 --> 03:35:17,310
You...

4376
03:35:19,090 --> 03:35:19,490
Again?

4377
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:35,140
I'm afraid of blowing up on myself.

4378
03:35:35,900 --> 03:35:39,080
I'm afraid of blowing up on myself.

4379
03:35:39,540 --> 03:35:41,440
I'm afraid of blowing up on myself.

4380
03:35:41,440 --> 03:35:41,580
I'm afraid of blowing up on myself.

4381
03:35:42,420 --> 03:35:43,140
There we go.

4382
03:35:43,920 --> 03:35:44,360
Okay.

4383
03:35:47,020 --> 03:35:47,900
Anyone else?

4384
03:35:48,100 --> 03:35:49,100
Gonna come out?

4385
03:35:49,240 --> 03:35:50,880
Wait, what is this over here then?

4386
03:35:52,260 --> 03:35:53,920
I don't think we're done, you guys.

4387
03:35:53,980 --> 03:35:55,360
I don't think we're quite so done.

4388
03:35:55,800 --> 03:35:56,240
Ow!

4389
03:35:56,640 --> 03:35:57,080
Wait!

4390
03:35:57,680 --> 03:36:03,460
What is the exit?

4391
03:36:04,180 --> 03:36:04,820
Oh my god!

4392
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:05,080
Ouch!

4393
03:36:05,080 --> 03:36:05,260
Ouch!

4394
03:36:05,380 --> 03:36:05,500
Ouch!

4395
03:36:06,600 --> 03:36:07,040
Huh.

4396
03:36:07,600 --> 03:36:08,160
Huh.

4397
03:36:09,420 --> 03:36:10,760
But the exit...

4398
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:12,060
Wow, this room is really pretty.

4399
03:36:13,720 --> 03:36:16,420
Can you climb the little ledge around the water?

4400
03:36:18,460 --> 03:36:19,260
Oh, yeah.

4401
03:36:19,500 --> 03:36:20,240
I see it.

4402
03:36:27,660 --> 03:36:29,220
It would be you.

4403
03:36:30,240 --> 03:36:30,800
Oh!

4404
03:36:30,820 --> 03:36:31,160
Ouch!

4405
03:36:31,280 --> 03:36:31,520
Ouch!

4406
03:36:35,500 --> 03:36:37,000
What just opened?

4407
03:36:40,820 --> 03:36:41,600
Come on.

4408
03:36:41,600 --> 03:36:42,460
Come on, Doomguy.

4409
03:36:44,660 --> 03:36:46,380
This is why you have tiny legs.

4410
03:36:49,320 --> 03:36:50,600
Be careful, Minto.

4411
03:36:59,000 --> 03:36:59,940
Do you think...

4412
03:37:00,840 --> 03:37:02,160
Do you think it was the orb?

4413
03:37:04,760 --> 03:37:05,200
No.

4414
03:37:05,480 --> 03:37:06,620
How do I get you?

4415
03:37:10,070 --> 03:37:11,450
Unless it's a timed thing.

4416
03:37:13,470 --> 03:37:14,610
What do you guys think?

4417
03:37:14,670 --> 03:37:15,310
Do you think it's timed?

4418
03:37:18,570 --> 03:37:19,690
Okay, let's try it again.

4419
03:37:21,210 --> 03:37:22,890
Hidden door by the blue door.

4420
03:37:23,350 --> 03:37:23,810
Hidden door by the blue door.

4421
03:37:23,810 --> 03:37:24,010
Oh, wait!

4422
03:37:24,050 --> 03:37:24,810
This also went up!

4423
03:37:26,010 --> 03:37:27,350
It just gave me a...

4424
03:37:27,350 --> 03:37:29,630
It's just a gun that I don't need.

4425
03:37:30,370 --> 03:37:31,970
Hidden door by the blue door.

4426
03:37:35,520 --> 03:37:36,440
Hidden door by the blue door.

4427
03:37:36,440 --> 03:37:36,880
Blue door.

4428
03:37:37,280 --> 03:37:37,960
Blue door?

4429
03:37:39,620 --> 03:37:40,080
Here.

4430
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:40,540
Here.

4431
03:37:45,620 --> 03:37:46,320
Secret.

4432
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:50,960
Hey!

4433
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:02,760
Burnt offerings.

4434
03:38:05,780 --> 03:38:06,480
Secrets?

4435
03:38:10,380 --> 03:38:11,380
Unholy temple!

4436
03:38:11,900 --> 03:38:12,060
Unholy temple!

4437
03:38:12,560 --> 03:38:13,060
Unholy temple!

4438
03:38:13,060 --> 03:38:13,820
Okay, hold on.

4439
03:38:13,900 --> 03:38:16,420
Let me save the game before we do anything else.

4440
03:38:17,500 --> 03:38:18,000
Yes.

4441
03:38:18,400 --> 03:38:19,040
It's okay.

4442
03:38:19,160 --> 03:38:20,020
Goodbye, secret level.

4443
03:38:20,460 --> 03:38:20,960
23!

4444
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:23,840
We have three more levels, I think, right?

4445
03:38:25,600 --> 03:38:27,340
She listens to our back seating.

4446
03:38:27,460 --> 03:38:28,580
Yeah, because I trust you guys!

4447
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:30,380
Thank you for the help.

4448
03:38:31,980 --> 03:38:32,840
Thank you!

4449
03:38:32,900 --> 03:38:34,720
Yeah, the fire is green now.

4450
03:38:34,720 --> 03:38:35,620
You're right.

4451
03:38:37,200 --> 03:38:37,660
Um...

4452
03:38:38,380 --> 03:38:39,060
No, yeah.

4453
03:38:39,180 --> 03:38:40,260
You're not gonna come down here.

4454
03:38:40,360 --> 03:38:40,980
You little baby.

4455
03:38:52,260 --> 03:38:54,340
I like the snarl that, uh...

4456
03:38:55,420 --> 03:38:56,600
That pinkies make.

4457
03:38:57,340 --> 03:38:58,540
You think I can hit him?

4458
03:38:59,220 --> 03:38:59,500
Wah!

4459
03:39:00,180 --> 03:39:00,640
Nope.

4460
03:39:04,680 --> 03:39:05,800
I hear another one.

4461
03:39:06,320 --> 03:39:07,300
I know, probably.

4462
03:39:09,100 --> 03:39:11,060
It might be overkill, but...

4463
03:39:12,980 --> 03:39:13,660
I just...

4464
03:39:13,660 --> 03:39:14,520
I just feel safer.

4465
03:39:20,260 --> 03:39:20,660
Oh.

4466
03:39:20,700 --> 03:39:21,100
Oh!

4467
03:39:21,280 --> 03:39:21,680
Shoot!

4468
03:39:21,820 --> 03:39:22,940
I didn't think it would reach me!

4469
03:39:23,060 --> 03:39:24,500
Because most of them hit the walls.

4470
03:39:29,320 --> 03:39:29,720
Ripperonium.

4471
03:39:29,720 --> 03:39:30,920
It just got the orb.

4472
03:39:33,460 --> 03:39:33,860
Oh.

4473
03:39:44,200 --> 03:39:46,580
I'm sniping with my shotgun!

4474
03:39:48,180 --> 03:39:50,880
Sometimes they can hit me, and sometimes I can't!

4475
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:52,160
Idiot!

4476
03:39:53,260 --> 03:39:55,120
Get shotgun sniped!

4477
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:00,940
Oh, we need all three for this door.

4478
03:40:01,080 --> 03:40:01,260
Okay.

4479
03:40:05,520 --> 03:40:06,880
How do I get up there, anyway?

4480
03:40:10,840 --> 03:40:12,860
I hear a spider in there.

4481
03:40:13,920 --> 03:40:14,980
Uh, not here.

4482
03:40:16,520 --> 03:40:18,520
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

4483
03:40:18,920 --> 03:40:20,740
I'd like to take them out if I could.

4484
03:40:20,940 --> 03:40:24,880
Because I'd like to not go up there and have to deal with them.

4485
03:40:28,070 --> 03:40:28,810
I'd like to not go up there and have to deal with them.

4486
03:40:28,810 --> 03:40:29,110
I'd like to not go up there and have to deal with them.

4487
03:40:43,140 --> 03:40:44,860
Sniping with shotguns.

4488
03:40:45,180 --> 03:40:46,120
Yeah, you know.

4489
03:40:46,400 --> 03:40:48,420
All the best gamers do it.

4490
03:40:50,660 --> 03:40:53,300
It's like totally in normal, natural.

4491
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:56,880
It's the new meta, everybody.

4492
03:40:58,060 --> 03:40:58,660
It's the new meta, everybody.

4493
03:40:58,680 --> 03:40:59,280
You know meta.

4494
03:41:01,300 --> 03:41:01,960
There we go.

4495
03:41:02,180 --> 03:41:04,160
Meta is everything, right?

4496
03:41:07,220 --> 03:41:08,100
Meta over...

4497
03:41:09,720 --> 03:41:10,160
Waifu.

4498
03:41:11,460 --> 03:41:13,260
Wait, what?

4499
03:41:15,460 --> 03:41:16,360
What just happened?

4500
03:41:16,860 --> 03:41:18,300
Wait, what just actually...

4501
03:41:18,300 --> 03:41:18,580
Wait, huh?

4502
03:41:20,060 --> 03:41:21,580
These things up there, maybe?

4503
03:41:22,020 --> 03:41:22,780
Oh my god.

4504
03:41:27,240 --> 03:41:28,400
They're like homing.

4505
03:41:30,620 --> 03:41:31,060
They're like homing.

4506
03:41:31,060 --> 03:41:32,080
Can you take the armor, please?

4507
03:41:32,820 --> 03:41:33,200
Can you take the armor, please?

4508
03:41:35,380 --> 03:41:37,340
They were like homing missiles though.

4509
03:41:38,740 --> 03:41:39,180
They were like homing missiles though.

4510
03:41:39,180 --> 03:41:40,040
How do I get up?

4511
03:41:40,420 --> 03:41:41,480
Does this...

4512
03:41:41,480 --> 03:41:42,540
Open up, please.

4513
03:41:44,840 --> 03:41:45,720
Wall missiles.

4514
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:50,740
Oh, oh my god.

4515
03:41:51,260 --> 03:41:52,080
That's where they are.

4516
03:41:54,580 --> 03:41:55,760
At least I got one.

4517
03:41:57,820 --> 03:41:58,780
At least I got one.

4518
03:41:58,780 --> 03:41:59,080
There we go.

4519
03:41:59,160 --> 03:41:59,340
Two.

4520
03:42:02,300 --> 03:42:03,460
What just opened up?

4521
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:05,260
I heard a sound.

4522
03:42:07,120 --> 03:42:08,820
No, those aren't cyber demons.

4523
03:42:09,020 --> 03:42:10,000
They were just the...

4524
03:42:12,400 --> 03:42:13,540
The barons, right?

4525
03:42:13,600 --> 03:42:14,180
Oh my god.

4526
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:16,480
Stop.

4527
03:42:19,640 --> 03:42:20,880
Don't do this to me.

4528
03:42:21,340 --> 03:42:21,820
Please.

4529
03:42:22,780 --> 03:42:23,360
Please.

4530
03:42:27,960 --> 03:42:28,600
Oh.

4531
03:42:29,920 --> 03:42:30,800
Never mind.

4532
03:42:31,260 --> 03:42:32,620
Not like this.

4533
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:36,380
So rude.

4534
03:42:40,500 --> 03:42:41,440
Oh, here we go.

4535
03:42:43,320 --> 03:42:44,540
Something opened up.

4536
03:42:44,940 --> 03:42:46,060
I'm going around.

4537
03:42:46,760 --> 03:42:47,620
Checking everything.

4538
03:42:48,520 --> 03:42:49,940
Checking what's going on.

4539
03:42:50,620 --> 03:42:51,680
I can't.

4540
03:42:51,680 --> 03:42:52,140
Oh wait.

4541
03:42:53,100 --> 03:42:54,400
How do I get out of here?

4542
03:42:54,660 --> 03:42:55,520
It's not timed.

4543
03:42:55,540 --> 03:42:55,900
I hope.

4544
03:42:56,220 --> 03:42:57,080
Wait, here we go.

4545
03:43:00,900 --> 03:43:01,300
Holy.

4546
03:43:09,720 --> 03:43:10,800
Is Mint winning?

4547
03:43:10,960 --> 03:43:11,300
I think.

4548
03:43:12,220 --> 03:43:13,100
So, maybe.

4549
03:43:13,420 --> 03:43:13,880
I don't know.

4550
03:43:15,640 --> 03:43:16,040
Probably.

4551
03:43:19,740 --> 03:43:20,520
I think so.

4552
03:43:22,280 --> 03:43:23,660
See, it doesn't happen every time.

4553
03:43:31,490 --> 03:43:32,110
Yeah.

4554
03:43:32,210 --> 03:43:32,890
Yeah.

4555
03:43:38,070 --> 03:43:39,490
Face on my feet.

4556
03:43:39,630 --> 03:43:40,290
Arrrrr.

4557
03:43:41,590 --> 03:43:42,270
Huh.

4558
03:43:44,750 --> 03:43:45,430
Huh.

4559
03:43:49,790 --> 03:43:50,470
Ah.

4560
03:43:50,470 --> 03:43:50,650
Hehehe.

4561
03:43:52,210 --> 03:43:52,890
What?

4562
03:43:53,730 --> 03:43:54,990
Why are you falling?

4563
03:43:55,070 --> 03:43:57,430
Where are the piggies falling from the sky?

4564
03:43:57,930 --> 03:43:58,390
Ah.

4565
03:43:58,570 --> 03:43:58,830
Ah.

4566
03:44:01,690 --> 03:44:02,290
No!

4567
03:44:02,430 --> 03:44:02,870
No!

4568
03:44:02,930 --> 03:44:03,230
No!

4569
03:44:03,230 --> 03:44:03,510
No!

4570
03:44:03,510 --> 03:44:03,730
No!

4571
03:44:20,960 --> 03:44:23,000
This is getting ridiculous!

4572
03:44:27,200 --> 03:44:29,580
I took less damage than I expected to.

4573
03:44:30,540 --> 03:44:31,520
Am I gaming?

4574
03:44:35,580 --> 03:44:36,200
Am

4575
03:44:50,340 --> 03:44:50,980
I gaming?

4576
03:44:58,640 --> 03:44:59,680
Minto Gaming.

4577
03:45:00,140 --> 03:45:01,240
Open up, please.

4578
03:45:02,140 --> 03:45:04,180
I did your stupid task.

4579
03:45:04,580 --> 03:45:06,020
Give me the key.

4580
03:45:06,380 --> 03:45:07,980
I did your task.

4581
03:45:08,260 --> 03:45:08,880
Please.

4582
03:45:09,520 --> 03:45:11,060
Please give me the key.

4583
03:45:13,100 --> 03:45:15,440
I did what you asked of me.

4584
03:45:20,080 --> 03:45:20,680
Please.

4585
03:45:23,460 --> 03:45:24,380
Open up, please.

4586
03:45:25,180 --> 03:45:26,060
Oh, here it is.

4587
03:45:30,800 --> 03:45:32,380
I'll be back for you.

4588
03:45:33,080 --> 03:45:33,920
I guess.

4589
03:45:38,420 --> 03:45:39,020
What?

4590
03:45:39,260 --> 03:45:42,260
I can't shoot him, but this guy can shoot me?

4591
03:45:45,340 --> 03:45:45,940
Wait.

4592
03:45:49,690 --> 03:45:50,670
No, no, no, I don't...

4593
03:45:50,670 --> 03:45:51,810
I don't trust it.

4594
03:45:51,910 --> 03:45:52,210
I don't trust it.

4595
03:45:57,840 --> 03:45:58,940
Where was he, anyway?

4596
03:45:59,040 --> 03:46:00,240
Okay, so we got the blue key.

4597
03:46:01,760 --> 03:46:02,120
Which...

4598
03:46:03,640 --> 03:46:04,000
was...

4599
03:46:09,610 --> 03:46:09,970
very...

4600
03:46:12,270 --> 03:46:13,890
much of a place that I remember.

4601
03:46:16,330 --> 03:46:19,430
Actually, it doesn't even show on the map.

4602
03:46:21,590 --> 03:46:22,710
It doesn't show on...

4603
03:46:25,550 --> 03:46:27,430
I don't remember seeing a blue door.

4604
03:46:27,630 --> 03:46:27,910
Oh.

4605
03:46:28,130 --> 03:46:28,690
Okay.

4606
03:46:28,830 --> 03:46:29,250
Good.

4607
03:46:29,370 --> 03:46:29,750
Me neither.

4608
03:46:34,390 --> 03:46:36,290
Stop shooting at me.

4609
03:46:38,270 --> 03:46:39,430
I can't get through.

4610
03:46:39,570 --> 03:46:41,090
I don't have a yellow or a red.

4611
03:46:41,510 --> 03:46:44,230
I think the game put us in the wrong order.

4612
03:46:47,810 --> 03:46:48,930
Let me...

4613
03:46:48,930 --> 03:46:49,150
Ah!

4614
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:57,120
Oh, come on.

4615
03:46:57,480 --> 03:46:58,800
This is so cheap.

4616
03:47:13,760 --> 03:47:14,240
Okay.

4617
03:47:14,480 --> 03:47:14,880
Red!

4618
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:16,440
Let's go!

4619
03:47:18,320 --> 03:47:21,500
I was gonna say, have they had enough time to replenish the...

4620
03:47:21,500 --> 03:47:23,380
the bombs, but clearly they have.

4621
03:47:23,720 --> 03:47:24,600
I'm gonna save again.

4622
03:47:24,640 --> 03:47:25,140
Sorry, guys.

4623
03:47:26,860 --> 03:47:28,000
I'm gonna save again.

4624
03:47:29,720 --> 03:47:30,200
Okay.

4625
03:47:30,840 --> 03:47:31,380
Let's go.

4626
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:36,300
Whoa.

4627
03:47:36,480 --> 03:47:37,540
There's a lot of guys in here.

4628
03:47:41,890 --> 03:47:43,190
I think I'm glad I'm saved.

4629
03:47:43,330 --> 03:47:44,670
I think I'm glad I saved.

4630
03:47:44,830 --> 03:47:46,290
I think I'm glad I saved.

4631
03:47:46,610 --> 03:47:47,710
I think I'm glad I saved.

4632
03:47:47,950 --> 03:47:49,330
I think I'm glad I saved.

4633
03:47:51,970 --> 03:47:52,690
I think I'm glad I saved.

4634
03:47:52,690 --> 03:47:53,390
Where was the other guy?

4635
03:47:53,530 --> 03:47:55,230
There was just another random dude in here.

4636
03:47:55,790 --> 03:47:56,390
Where'd he go?

4637
03:47:57,030 --> 03:47:57,930
I hope I killed...

4638
03:48:00,160 --> 03:48:00,880
Oh, my God.

4639
03:48:05,020 --> 03:48:05,740
These guys.

4640
03:48:06,200 --> 03:48:06,840
Oh, my God.

4641
03:48:06,840 --> 03:48:07,040
Please.

4642
03:48:07,400 --> 03:48:08,660
I will actually die.

4643
03:48:09,020 --> 03:48:11,400
Oh, my God.

4644
03:48:11,400 --> 03:48:11,580
Oh, my God.

4645
03:48:24,730 --> 03:48:26,470
There's another one going to pop up!

4646
03:48:29,900 --> 03:48:32,480
There's another one going to pop up, please say no.

4647
03:48:40,160 --> 03:48:41,640
I was prepared this time.

4648
03:48:44,100 --> 03:48:44,940
Oh, come on.

4649
03:48:46,540 --> 03:48:47,460
Wait, exit.

4650
03:48:59,800 --> 03:49:01,500
Oh, I have a hundred, my bad.

4651
03:49:06,900 --> 03:49:07,700
Rude game!

4652
03:49:08,040 --> 03:49:09,120
Rude game!

4653
03:49:09,580 --> 03:49:11,300
Rude game!

4654
03:49:15,660 --> 03:49:16,640
We're safe right now.

4655
03:49:19,100 --> 03:49:20,820
Rude, rude, rude, rude, rude.

4656
03:49:20,960 --> 03:49:24,460
I love that the PNGs in this game all turn towards you.

4657
03:49:24,900 --> 03:49:28,300
Because I know it's probably like, you know...

4658
03:49:28,900 --> 03:49:31,020
It's so that they never appear flat.

4659
03:49:31,160 --> 03:49:33,900
But it also just makes it so much spookier.

4660
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:36,720
Super rude.

4661
03:49:37,720 --> 03:49:38,980
So, so rude.

4662
03:49:39,140 --> 03:49:41,820
Good thing I saved beforehand, I suppose.

4663
03:49:42,480 --> 03:49:44,840
Okay, what is this?

4664
03:49:45,280 --> 03:49:47,880
Okay, let's go grab this.

4665
03:49:49,000 --> 03:49:50,080
And... cool.

4666
03:49:50,960 --> 03:49:51,920
So now we have all...

4667
03:49:51,920 --> 03:49:52,760
Wait, we have all three.

4668
03:49:52,980 --> 03:49:53,860
I just realized.

4669
03:49:57,960 --> 03:49:58,640
Never mind.

4670
03:49:59,940 --> 03:50:02,740
Chat's filled with excitement as they react to a player named MintoGaming.

4671
03:50:02,880 --> 03:50:07,220
They use phrases like, Yes, you are Minto and true gamer if I ever saw one.

4672
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:08,820
Yippee!

4673
03:50:09,700 --> 03:50:10,160
Okay.

4674
03:50:11,360 --> 03:50:12,520
Let's keep going then.

4675
03:50:20,830 --> 03:50:21,290
Yes!

4676
03:50:21,550 --> 03:50:22,010
You...

4677
03:50:22,010 --> 03:50:24,710
Are Minto.

4678
03:50:27,850 --> 03:50:29,970
Wait, why is this closed back up?

4679
03:50:30,150 --> 03:50:30,970
This is so rude.

4680
03:50:31,870 --> 03:50:33,270
There's still health in here.

4681
03:50:34,870 --> 03:50:35,310
Okay.

4682
03:50:39,110 --> 03:50:40,370
Just gonna blast him.

4683
03:50:42,210 --> 03:50:44,130
Oh, I don't think that actually worked.

4684
03:50:45,890 --> 03:50:47,130
I don't think that actually...

4685
03:50:47,130 --> 03:50:48,490
I don't think I actually aimed for him at all.

4686
03:50:48,630 --> 03:50:49,150
There we go.

4687
03:50:55,720 --> 03:50:57,880
Took care of his meaty ass.

4688
03:50:58,740 --> 03:51:00,440
I'm gonna go get it also.

4689
03:51:02,640 --> 03:51:03,720
There's so...

4690
03:51:03,720 --> 03:51:04,880
Ah!

4691
03:51:08,800 --> 03:51:09,180
No!

4692
03:51:09,720 --> 03:51:10,480
Ah!

4693
03:51:10,700 --> 03:51:11,460
Hey!

4694
03:51:11,460 --> 03:51:11,560
Hey!

4695
03:51:18,340 --> 03:51:20,760
This game is so rude.

4696
03:51:20,980 --> 03:51:24,140
This game is so unbearably rude.

4697
03:51:26,860 --> 03:51:27,980
Come on!

4698
03:51:28,020 --> 03:51:28,800
I have all three!

4699
03:51:39,570 --> 03:51:40,410
What do I...

4700
03:51:40,410 --> 03:51:40,990
What am I hearing?

4701
03:51:44,690 --> 03:51:47,490
I don't actually remember how I got up here.

4702
03:51:47,690 --> 03:51:48,690
To be honest.

4703
03:51:49,830 --> 03:51:50,670
I don't quite remember.

4704
03:51:54,860 --> 03:51:55,220
Oh!

4705
03:51:56,020 --> 03:51:56,640
Take this.

4706
03:51:59,140 --> 03:51:59,500
Ah!

4707
03:51:59,820 --> 03:52:00,180
Oh!

4708
03:52:00,260 --> 03:52:00,680
The portal!

4709
03:52:00,840 --> 03:52:01,020
Yes!

4710
03:52:01,080 --> 03:52:01,420
Thank you!

4711
03:52:01,480 --> 03:52:01,860
Thank you!

4712
03:52:01,900 --> 03:52:03,800
It was all the way on the other side, wasn't it?

4713
03:52:03,860 --> 03:52:04,160
Wait, no.

4714
03:52:04,260 --> 03:52:04,840
On this side.

4715
03:52:06,620 --> 03:52:07,860
Yes, there was a teleporter.

4716
03:52:08,100 --> 03:52:08,620
Thank you guys.

4717
03:52:09,400 --> 03:52:10,540
Thank you for the reminder.

4718
03:52:12,540 --> 03:52:13,040
Thank you.

4719
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:13,400
Thank you.

4720
03:52:13,860 --> 03:52:14,360
This one.

4721
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:17,040
Okay.

4722
03:52:17,800 --> 03:52:18,160
Run!

4723
03:52:18,640 --> 03:52:19,000
Run!

4724
03:52:19,000 --> 03:52:19,040
Run!

4725
03:52:20,460 --> 03:52:21,660
Please, God, no!

4726
03:52:25,220 --> 03:52:26,180
Oh, no!

4727
03:52:26,300 --> 03:52:27,040
Why did I come in...

4728
03:52:27,040 --> 03:52:28,160
Why did I come back in here?

4729
03:52:28,320 --> 03:52:29,200
I'm such an idiot.

4730
03:52:29,440 --> 03:52:31,520
Of all places I could have picked for protection.

4731
03:52:31,840 --> 03:52:32,920
What's wrong with me?

4732
03:52:35,480 --> 03:52:36,680
Go, go, go, go!

4733
03:52:40,860 --> 03:52:42,200
Oh, it's open again.

4734
03:52:42,360 --> 03:52:42,720
Oh!

4735
03:52:42,720 --> 03:52:43,140
Oh!

4736
03:52:43,280 --> 03:52:43,580
Oh!

4737
03:52:43,580 --> 03:52:43,820
Oh!

4738
03:52:43,820 --> 03:52:43,980
Oh!

4739
03:52:44,180 --> 03:52:44,660
Oh!

4740
03:52:44,660 --> 03:52:44,920
Oh!

4741
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:45,260
Oh!

4742
03:52:45,300 --> 03:52:45,620
Oh!

4743
03:52:45,840 --> 03:52:46,320
Oh!

4744
03:52:46,320 --> 03:52:46,600
Oh!

4745
03:52:46,700 --> 03:52:47,180
Oh!

4746
03:52:47,440 --> 03:52:47,880
Oh!

4747
03:52:51,720 --> 03:52:52,200
Oh!

4748
03:53:02,390 --> 03:53:07,010
I didn't realize this was a...

4749
03:53:15,430 --> 03:53:16,310
We're okay.

4750
03:53:21,530 --> 03:53:23,650
I'll come back for you, my precious.

4751
03:53:27,230 --> 03:53:27,870
Um...

4752
03:53:29,730 --> 03:53:31,550
I came back for you!

4753
03:53:32,230 --> 03:53:32,870
Oh!

4754
03:53:34,950 --> 03:53:35,470
What?!

4755
03:53:37,170 --> 03:53:38,210
Oh my...

4756
03:53:38,210 --> 03:53:38,750
Ahh!

4757
03:53:42,840 --> 03:53:44,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4758
03:53:44,520 --> 03:53:45,040
Oh!

4759
03:53:45,240 --> 03:53:45,760
Okay.

4760
03:53:45,980 --> 03:53:46,100
Phew.

4761
03:53:47,860 --> 03:53:48,620
Okay, we're good.

4762
03:53:49,180 --> 03:53:51,040
I'm coming back for you.

4763
03:53:51,640 --> 03:53:53,380
I'm coming back for you!

4764
03:53:54,060 --> 03:53:54,580
No.

4765
03:53:55,320 --> 03:53:56,460
I did it.

4766
03:53:56,900 --> 03:53:57,420
Wait.

4767
03:53:57,520 --> 03:53:58,860
How do I open these now?

4768
03:54:02,870 --> 03:54:04,690
It said, don't leave me, darling.

4769
03:54:04,970 --> 03:54:05,430
I know.

4770
03:54:05,470 --> 03:54:06,190
I really did.

4771
03:54:07,590 --> 03:54:08,470
Carly Raimi.

4772
03:54:11,270 --> 03:54:13,110
I'm coming back for you.

4773
03:54:13,570 --> 03:54:15,310
I'm coming back for you.

4774
03:54:15,890 --> 03:54:17,250
I don't know...

4775
03:54:17,250 --> 03:54:21,530
Okay, so we have all the keys, but all the doors that require the three keys are not opening.

4776
03:54:22,690 --> 03:54:24,290
Is that at 11 or 11.30?

4777
03:54:24,350 --> 03:54:25,030
11.30.

4778
03:54:26,110 --> 03:54:27,530
Guys, I don't think we're finishing.

4779
03:54:27,790 --> 03:54:28,750
I'm so sad.

4780
03:54:29,330 --> 03:54:29,850
No!

4781
03:54:30,070 --> 03:54:30,930
I wanted to finish!

4782
03:54:32,730 --> 03:54:36,870
Maybe if my meeting isn't so long...

4783
03:54:36,870 --> 03:54:40,170
I can continue... afterwards.

4784
03:54:40,630 --> 03:54:41,430
After it's done.

4785
03:54:45,090 --> 03:54:46,710
Even though it'll be quite late.

4786
03:54:55,160 --> 03:54:55,980
Oh, save.

4787
03:54:56,260 --> 03:54:56,720
Thank you.

4788
03:54:56,740 --> 03:54:57,920
Thank you for the reminder.

4789
03:55:00,220 --> 03:55:01,900
I don't... wait, okay.

4790
03:55:03,580 --> 03:55:04,780
Late night mint.

4791
03:55:05,420 --> 03:55:06,580
Late night minto.

4792
03:55:09,580 --> 03:55:11,280
Oh, that's that in there?

4793
03:55:13,220 --> 03:55:13,820
Um...

4794
03:55:15,120 --> 03:55:16,780
So we pushed those three.

4795
03:55:16,960 --> 03:55:17,880
So what else?

4796
03:55:18,080 --> 03:55:19,420
Maybe the one inside here.

4797
03:55:29,170 --> 03:55:29,770
No.

4798
03:55:34,030 --> 03:55:35,850
There was another one.

4799
03:55:45,410 --> 03:55:45,710
Uh...

4800
03:55:47,050 --> 03:55:48,370
Oh my god, I completely forgot!

4801
03:55:49,430 --> 03:55:51,330
And this one's probably also gonna go off too!

4802
03:55:55,930 --> 03:55:58,010
The key buttons are in a sequence.

4803
03:55:59,510 --> 03:56:00,310
Oh... wait.

4804
03:56:02,270 --> 03:56:04,350
Go back to the room where you fought all the pinkies.

4805
03:56:04,610 --> 03:56:04,970
Okay.

4806
03:56:06,110 --> 03:56:08,110
But I... I know I went back in there though.

4807
03:56:08,250 --> 03:56:09,290
And it wasn't open.

4808
03:56:11,710 --> 03:56:12,290
In here?

4809
03:56:12,290 --> 03:56:12,310
In here?

4810
03:56:15,310 --> 03:56:16,010
This one?

4811
03:56:24,930 --> 03:56:27,790
Have you tried knocking politely?

4812
03:56:28,250 --> 03:56:29,090
Pink, pink, pink!

4813
03:56:29,610 --> 03:56:30,490
Open up, please!

4814
03:56:33,510 --> 03:56:34,930
Oh, wait a second!

4815
03:56:36,570 --> 03:56:37,510
Wait a second!

4816
03:56:39,150 --> 03:56:41,070
Red, blue, yellow...

4817
03:56:44,570 --> 03:56:45,670
Hold on, I'm cooking.

4818
03:56:48,510 --> 03:56:49,910
Red, blue, yellow...

4819
03:56:49,910 --> 03:56:51,250
What was the other one?

4820
03:56:51,650 --> 03:56:52,050
Um...

4821
03:56:52,510 --> 03:56:53,470
The one in here.

4822
03:56:56,130 --> 03:56:57,430
Red, blue, yellow...

4823
03:56:57,430 --> 03:56:58,110
Are they timed?

4824
03:56:58,170 --> 03:56:58,810
I should open...

4825
03:56:58,810 --> 03:56:59,130
Oh!

4826
03:56:59,170 --> 03:56:59,550
Oh!

4827
03:56:59,710 --> 03:57:00,030
Ah!

4828
03:57:01,330 --> 03:57:02,590
Blue, yellow, red!

4829
03:57:02,790 --> 03:57:04,950
Blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red.

4830
03:57:05,230 --> 03:57:06,090
Red, blue, yellow.

4831
03:57:09,150 --> 03:57:09,810
Ah-ha!

4832
03:57:10,770 --> 03:57:13,050
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

4833
03:57:13,050 --> 03:57:13,350
Ah...

4834
03:57:15,800 --> 03:57:16,130
Oh!

4835
03:57:17,850 --> 03:57:18,510
Blue...

4836
03:57:19,930 --> 03:57:20,590
Yellow...

4837
03:57:21,690 --> 03:57:22,350
Red!

4838
03:57:23,820 --> 03:57:24,390
Oh, shoot.

4839
03:57:24,490 --> 03:57:25,470
Guys, which one was that?

4840
03:57:29,850 --> 03:57:31,110
Not red?

4841
03:57:31,250 --> 03:57:31,730
Shoot.

4842
03:57:35,340 --> 03:57:36,130
This way.

4843
03:57:37,330 --> 03:57:37,990
Oof!

4844
03:57:38,150 --> 03:57:38,590
Oof!

4845
03:57:38,590 --> 03:57:38,970
Oof!

4846
03:57:39,030 --> 03:57:39,550
Oof!

4847
03:57:39,650 --> 03:57:40,050
Oof!

4848
03:57:40,070 --> 03:57:40,350
Oof!

4849
03:57:40,430 --> 03:57:40,430
Oof!

4850
03:57:42,130 --> 03:57:43,130
This one.

4851
03:57:43,370 --> 03:57:44,350
The one over there.

4852
03:57:44,850 --> 03:57:45,230
Yes!

4853
03:57:46,030 --> 03:57:46,610
Ta-da!

4854
03:57:47,930 --> 03:57:48,310
Okay.

4855
03:57:50,570 --> 03:57:50,950
Okay.

4856
03:57:51,970 --> 03:57:52,350
Then...

4857
03:57:54,010 --> 03:57:56,010
Red, blue, yellow was the next one.

4858
03:57:58,450 --> 03:58:00,410
And then there was the one all the way downstairs.

4859
03:58:00,550 --> 03:58:02,330
I do remember the one in the water.

4860
03:58:04,650 --> 03:58:05,030
Oh.

4861
03:58:05,850 --> 03:58:08,190
Red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow.

4862
03:58:10,970 --> 03:58:11,350
Red.

4863
03:58:14,350 --> 03:58:14,470
Blue.

4864
03:58:15,650 --> 03:58:16,050
Yellow.

4865
03:58:17,870 --> 03:58:18,270
Nice.

4866
03:58:21,210 --> 03:58:21,610
Okay.

4867
03:58:25,190 --> 03:58:25,770
Thank you.

4868
03:58:25,790 --> 03:58:26,830
Someone gave me a hint.

4869
03:58:27,030 --> 03:58:28,070
They were like, there's a sequence.

4870
03:58:28,710 --> 03:58:31,090
So, it wasn't my big brain all by myself.

4871
03:58:31,290 --> 03:58:32,270
So, thank you for the hint.

4872
03:58:33,690 --> 03:58:36,230
And then, we gotta go see what the last one is.

4873
03:58:41,410 --> 03:58:42,210
It's somewhere...

4874
03:58:42,210 --> 03:58:43,690
It's over here, I believe.

4875
03:58:43,930 --> 03:58:44,330
Okay.

4876
03:58:44,890 --> 03:58:46,450
Just, uh...

4877
03:58:46,450 --> 03:58:47,010
Just kidding.

4878
03:58:47,670 --> 03:58:48,670
It's here.

4879
03:58:52,640 --> 03:58:53,280
Oh!

4880
03:58:53,360 --> 03:58:55,140
I already unlocked it, because I'm stupid.

4881
03:58:55,460 --> 03:58:55,960
Yippee!

4882
03:59:06,760 --> 03:59:08,020
What's he doin' up there?

4883
03:59:25,560 --> 03:59:27,020
I'm a secret genius!

4884
03:59:29,540 --> 03:59:30,000
Hi!

4885
03:59:31,400 --> 03:59:32,040
Hello!

4886
03:59:40,870 --> 03:59:42,470
I'm a secret genius!

4887
03:59:43,290 --> 03:59:44,870
I'm a secret genius!

4888
03:59:57,890 --> 03:59:59,970
What else is coming down?

4889
04:00:00,190 --> 04:00:01,510
What's coming down?

4890
04:00:05,550 --> 04:00:09,730
Did the floor turn to lava?

4891
04:00:16,320 --> 04:00:17,100
Beep beep!

4892
04:00:19,960 --> 04:00:21,720
My phone is going off.

4893
04:00:21,720 --> 04:00:23,860
It's like, your meeting is in 30 minutes.

4894
04:00:24,200 --> 04:00:24,860
I know!

4895
04:00:28,920 --> 04:00:30,080
Oh gosh, okay.

4896
04:00:38,220 --> 04:00:39,940
Oh, come on!

4897
04:00:51,550 --> 04:00:52,110
What?

4898
04:01:01,780 --> 04:01:03,980
Maybe it wasn't the best idea staying up there.

4899
04:01:05,240 --> 04:01:06,840
Maybe it wasn't the best idea.

4900
04:01:09,220 --> 04:01:09,780
Okay!

4901
04:01:10,420 --> 04:01:11,660
That should be the third one!

4902
04:01:13,200 --> 04:01:14,180
And then...

4903
04:01:14,180 --> 04:01:17,400
Something amazing will happen!

4904
04:01:19,500 --> 04:01:20,060
Something...

4905
04:01:21,680 --> 04:01:22,520
Really cool!

4906
04:01:23,800 --> 04:01:24,480
Wait, where am I?

4907
04:01:24,600 --> 04:01:25,180
Oh, okay.

4908
04:01:25,420 --> 04:01:27,080
Thanks, I guess, for that.

4909
04:01:33,020 --> 04:01:33,460
Something...

4910
04:01:34,780 --> 04:01:35,220
Oh!

4911
04:01:40,110 --> 04:01:40,710
The exit!

4912
04:01:41,750 --> 04:01:42,450
The exit!

4913
04:01:42,570 --> 04:01:42,930
The exit!

4914
04:01:43,070 --> 04:01:43,390
The exit!

4915
04:01:43,470 --> 04:01:43,810
The exit!

4916
04:01:43,910 --> 04:01:44,210
The exit!

4917
04:01:44,410 --> 04:01:44,410
The exit!

4918
04:01:44,470 --> 04:01:45,130
The exit!

4919
04:01:45,170 --> 04:01:46,090
The room that said exit!

4920
04:01:54,390 --> 04:01:55,270
This way!

4921
04:01:58,070 --> 04:01:58,950
No surprises!

4922
04:02:01,490 --> 04:02:01,970
Beep!

4923
04:02:03,170 --> 04:02:03,650
Yippee!

4924
04:02:15,010 --> 04:02:15,970
No escape!

4925
04:02:22,120 --> 04:02:22,860
Save game.

4926
04:02:25,980 --> 04:02:27,980
Gosh, we're so close, you guys!

4927
04:02:28,760 --> 04:02:30,780
Oh, we're so close!

4928
04:02:31,140 --> 04:02:33,280
I wish I could postpone my meeting, for real.

4929
04:02:33,520 --> 04:02:36,040
I wish I could be like, um, can you give me like...

4930
04:02:37,080 --> 04:02:39,780
A little extra time to beat the game?

4931
04:02:41,020 --> 04:02:42,140
Could you just...

4932
04:02:42,140 --> 04:02:44,080
How much for a checky with a cute maid?

4933
04:02:44,460 --> 04:02:45,300
Stop it!

4934
04:02:45,760 --> 04:02:48,780
Could you just give me a little extra time to beat the game?

4935
04:02:52,560 --> 04:02:53,540
Oh, wait.

4936
04:02:53,760 --> 04:02:55,120
There's a lot going on here.

4937
04:02:59,320 --> 04:03:00,920
You're shooting each other!

4938
04:03:01,700 --> 04:03:03,280
You're shooting your friend!

4939
04:03:05,180 --> 04:03:05,580
Oh.

4940
04:03:06,360 --> 04:03:11,020
I thought I could climb on top of that.

4941
04:03:11,680 --> 04:03:12,680
What's going on here?

4942
04:03:16,180 --> 04:03:17,300
Is that a cyber demon?

4943
04:03:18,660 --> 04:03:19,580
What is that sound?

4944
04:03:19,740 --> 04:03:19,940
Oh.

4945
04:03:20,000 --> 04:03:20,600
Oh my goodness!

4946
04:03:26,720 --> 04:03:27,120
Sounds...

4947
04:03:30,700 --> 04:03:32,380
Can't even tell if I'm getting him or not.

4948
04:03:35,860 --> 04:03:36,260
Can't even tell if I'm getting him or not.

4949
04:03:42,480 --> 04:03:44,040
Oh my god, these are so funny!

4950
04:03:50,080 --> 04:03:50,600
Touhou!

4951
04:03:50,600 --> 04:03:51,540
Touhou Project!

4952
04:03:58,530 --> 04:04:01,210
Wait, people said there were only 25 levels.

4953
04:04:03,110 --> 04:04:04,070
Which is it?

4954
04:04:04,110 --> 04:04:04,830
I'm so confused.

4955
04:04:12,190 --> 04:04:15,850
If you're counting secret levels, then... oh my gosh.

4956
04:04:15,850 --> 04:04:18,950
If you're counting secret levels, I'm not gonna do secret levels.

4957
04:04:19,990 --> 04:04:20,590
It's okay.

4958
04:04:21,770 --> 04:04:24,490
They added more levels with the re-release?

4959
04:04:24,930 --> 04:04:26,190
Oh my god.

4960
04:04:26,410 --> 04:04:26,790
Okay then.

4961
04:04:27,110 --> 04:04:28,570
Maybe it will be another day.

4962
04:04:32,630 --> 04:04:33,330
Come on!

4963
04:04:33,710 --> 04:04:34,610
Where are you?

4964
04:04:35,050 --> 04:04:35,850
Oh, I see him.

4965
04:04:36,850 --> 04:04:37,690
Cyber demon.

4966
04:04:38,150 --> 04:04:38,630
Okay.

4967
04:04:40,490 --> 04:04:41,110
Let's see.

4968
04:04:41,190 --> 04:04:42,130
There's a lot going on.

4969
04:04:42,550 --> 04:04:43,870
Just kidding.

4970
04:04:44,250 --> 04:04:45,530
Wait, this is where I came from.

4971
04:04:45,850 --> 04:04:45,990
Okay.

4972
04:04:46,370 --> 04:04:48,730
Well, if we ever need health, we know where to get some.

4973
04:04:52,430 --> 04:04:54,770
Chat's a bit lost in the... I'm lost in the sauce.

4974
04:04:54,910 --> 04:04:56,310
I don't know what's going on at all.

4975
04:04:58,070 --> 04:04:59,010
Wait, a box of what?

4976
04:05:01,670 --> 04:05:02,470
Oh no!

4977
04:05:02,670 --> 04:05:02,970
Wait!

4978
04:05:04,590 --> 04:05:08,230
Is this like that one puzzle where you get the special thing?

4979
04:05:08,490 --> 04:05:09,490
Okay, I'm not gonna press anymore.

4980
04:05:10,490 --> 04:05:10,890
Spank!

4981
04:05:10,950 --> 04:05:12,270
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

4982
04:05:13,110 --> 04:05:13,870
Thank you!

4983
04:05:18,070 --> 04:05:19,290
Can I go any...

4984
04:05:22,990 --> 04:05:24,610
I don't think I can.

4985
04:05:24,870 --> 04:05:26,570
It's just really sad.

4986
04:05:27,550 --> 04:05:30,150
Watching his corpse rise and fall.

4987
04:05:31,510 --> 04:05:32,570
Okay, let's see.

4988
04:05:34,870 --> 04:05:35,710
Cyber demon?

4989
04:05:35,970 --> 04:05:37,170
I think I gotta go down here.

4990
04:05:40,790 --> 04:05:41,350
Whoa!

4991
04:05:41,470 --> 04:05:41,810
Whoa!

4992
04:05:44,470 --> 04:05:46,010
Oh, nice.

4993
04:05:48,050 --> 04:05:49,790
Womp womp.

4994
04:05:58,300 --> 04:05:59,700
Okay.

4995
04:06:01,880 --> 04:06:03,280
Okay.

4996
04:06:05,880 --> 04:06:07,280
Okay.

4997
04:06:11,960 --> 04:06:14,280
Oh my god.

4998
04:06:28,770 --> 04:06:31,130
Lost levels are unlocked after beating the original campaign.

4999
04:06:31,270 --> 04:06:32,290
They came with a 2020 release.

5000
04:06:32,490 --> 04:06:33,870
I see, I see.

5001
04:06:34,170 --> 04:06:35,530
There's 25 story levels.

5002
04:06:35,910 --> 04:06:37,410
Little 25, 26, 27.

5003
04:06:37,870 --> 04:06:39,950
Or fun levels that can be accessed with passwords.

5004
04:06:40,730 --> 04:06:41,170
Mmm.

5005
04:06:47,560 --> 04:06:48,660
Oh, we don't need that.

5006
04:06:48,800 --> 04:06:49,040
Okay.

5007
04:06:49,680 --> 04:06:51,900
I'm gonna try and go from here, maybe?

5008
04:06:52,760 --> 04:06:53,200
Wait!

5009
04:06:53,540 --> 04:06:54,060
Uh oh.

5010
04:07:00,330 --> 04:07:01,450
How did I get...

5011
04:07:01,450 --> 04:07:03,570
Why is the sky black... back to...

5012
04:07:04,670 --> 04:07:05,730
Back to...

5013
04:07:05,730 --> 04:07:07,070
Um, red?

5014
04:07:08,350 --> 04:07:11,430
I really enjoyed our green flame scenery.

5015
04:07:11,830 --> 04:07:12,370
Before.

5016
04:07:13,210 --> 04:07:14,530
Yeah, I'm just confused.

5017
04:07:14,910 --> 04:07:17,530
I think, yeah, I'll just keep playing until the game is over.

5018
04:07:17,670 --> 04:07:17,910
I guess.

5019
04:07:18,590 --> 04:07:21,470
Rip and tear until it is done, you know?

5020
04:07:21,590 --> 04:07:22,350
That's what the...

5021
04:07:23,390 --> 04:07:25,450
Isn't that what are they all the greatest...

5022
04:07:28,150 --> 04:07:28,690
Um...

5023
04:07:28,690 --> 04:07:30,270
All the greatest, uh...

5024
04:07:30,970 --> 04:07:33,430
Doom guys say and everything, you know?

5025
04:07:36,650 --> 04:07:37,610
All the greatest, uh...

5026
04:07:37,610 --> 04:07:39,050
Rip and tear part of your schedule.

5027
04:07:41,110 --> 04:07:42,570
I'm really kind of...

5028
04:07:42,570 --> 04:07:44,630
Not sure when I'll be able to play it, though.

5029
04:07:45,830 --> 04:07:46,310
Um...

5030
04:07:53,870 --> 04:07:54,350
Oh.

5031
04:07:54,910 --> 04:07:55,390
Nice.

5032
04:07:55,970 --> 04:07:56,450
Oh.

5033
04:07:57,090 --> 04:07:57,090
Nice.

5034
04:07:57,570 --> 04:07:58,250
Wait a second.

5035
04:07:58,410 --> 04:08:00,050
Are there any other things that look like that?

5036
04:08:00,230 --> 04:08:00,790
Oh yeah, there are.

5037
04:08:05,990 --> 04:08:06,510
Oh.

5038
04:08:07,230 --> 04:08:08,590
Well, I'll take all the rockets.

5039
04:08:08,690 --> 04:08:09,570
That's what I will do.

5040
04:08:11,890 --> 04:08:14,090
All the greatest Doomers are saying that nowadays.

5041
04:08:14,330 --> 04:08:14,890
All the greatest Doomers are saying that nowadays.

5042
04:08:20,450 --> 04:08:22,250
I just got this armor!

5043
04:08:23,310 --> 04:08:24,210
Don't break it.

5044
04:08:25,690 --> 04:08:26,210
Okay.

5045
04:08:26,710 --> 04:08:27,950
Where even is that?

5046
04:08:29,010 --> 04:08:30,090
I have no idea.

5047
04:08:30,510 --> 04:08:30,910
I have no idea.

5048
04:08:33,150 --> 04:08:33,670
Um...

5049
04:08:33,670 --> 04:08:33,770
Um...

5050
04:08:38,980 --> 04:08:39,860
What rockets did I waste?

5051
04:08:42,440 --> 04:08:42,800
Uh...

5052
04:08:42,800 --> 04:08:44,180
Did I go in this one?

5053
04:08:50,920 --> 04:08:52,060
They're always saying it.

5054
04:08:53,220 --> 04:08:54,620
If I decide to do one.

5055
04:08:54,880 --> 04:08:56,640
Yeah, if I decide, uh...

5056
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:58,440
I might, you know, I might just be too tired.

5057
04:08:58,620 --> 04:08:59,280
Cause I'll be...

5058
04:08:59,280 --> 04:09:00,940
Oh wait, this is the one I went into before.

5059
04:09:01,960 --> 04:09:03,440
I might just be too tired.

5060
04:09:06,280 --> 04:09:06,640
Cause...

5061
04:09:09,600 --> 04:09:11,520
I'll be endurancing tomorrow as well.

5062
04:09:12,140 --> 04:09:13,580
Okay, this is the way we need to go.

5063
04:09:13,680 --> 04:09:14,700
This is the way that just opened up.

5064
04:09:17,400 --> 04:09:18,780
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

5065
04:09:18,960 --> 04:09:20,280
I hate them so much.

5066
04:09:21,680 --> 04:09:22,240
I don't...

5067
04:09:22,240 --> 04:09:25,340
I don't really want to be screaming at like 2 in the morning.

5068
04:09:25,440 --> 04:09:26,040
But you know.

5069
04:09:32,690 --> 04:09:33,930
You know how it is.

5070
04:09:37,670 --> 04:09:38,550
Don't be a lie.

5071
04:09:38,550 --> 04:09:39,670
Don't be a...

5072
04:09:39,670 --> 04:09:40,810
Don't be a trap.

5073
04:09:49,940 --> 04:09:50,880
There we go.

5074
04:10:02,470 --> 04:10:03,850
It's not always a trap.

5075
04:10:05,370 --> 04:10:07,490
There's been one time it wasn't a trap.

5076
04:10:10,150 --> 04:10:11,030
And I'm...

5077
04:10:11,030 --> 04:10:13,430
I'm gonna hold on to that one chance.

5078
04:10:13,550 --> 04:10:15,630
Okay, there's definitely something I need to do in here.

5079
04:10:16,330 --> 04:10:17,050
I just...

5080
04:10:17,050 --> 04:10:19,330
I'm worried that it's gonna be like that...

5081
04:10:19,330 --> 04:10:21,250
Thing where I missed out on the cool weapon.

5082
04:10:26,610 --> 04:10:27,330
Oh, sorry.

5083
04:10:27,530 --> 04:10:27,790
My bad.

5084
04:10:27,910 --> 04:10:28,330
You can go up.

5085
04:10:28,390 --> 04:10:28,750
You can go up.

5086
04:10:29,370 --> 04:10:30,930
Oh, sorry.

5087
04:10:31,130 --> 04:10:31,930
You can go up.

5088
04:10:31,950 --> 04:10:32,490
You can go up.

5089
04:10:34,510 --> 04:10:35,230
Oh, save?

5090
04:10:35,550 --> 04:10:36,290
Yeah, that's a good idea.

5091
04:10:37,230 --> 04:10:37,970
That's a good idea.

5092
04:10:41,770 --> 04:10:42,130
Okay.

5093
04:10:47,830 --> 04:10:48,190
Please.

5094
04:10:49,090 --> 04:10:49,330
I'm...

5095
04:10:50,890 --> 04:10:52,950
I would like for you to go up.

5096
04:10:55,490 --> 04:10:56,050
Oh.

5097
04:11:00,600 --> 04:11:01,720
Oh god.

5098
04:11:01,960 --> 04:11:03,020
I thought I was...

5099
04:11:03,020 --> 04:11:04,700
I thought I was...

5100
04:11:04,700 --> 04:11:06,200
I thought I was trapped.

5101
04:11:20,860 --> 04:11:21,420
Wait,

5102
04:11:24,480 --> 04:11:26,280
the same one keeps dropping down.

5103
04:11:28,440 --> 04:11:29,200
Wait, the same one keeps dropping down.

5104
04:11:29,200 --> 04:11:30,220
Is there like an order to it?

5105
04:11:34,960 --> 04:11:35,760
Secret ending.

5106
04:11:35,900 --> 04:11:36,660
You're just trapped.

5107
04:11:36,840 --> 04:11:39,300
I'm so glad that they thought that people might do that.

5108
04:11:39,680 --> 04:11:40,840
I'm so glad that they thought that people might do that.

5109
04:11:40,840 --> 04:11:43,140
And decided that if you interact with it, you can get away from it.

5110
04:11:43,360 --> 04:11:43,700
And decided that if you interact with it, you can get away from it.

5111
04:11:45,740 --> 04:11:47,480
Yeah, all the switches do the same thing.

5112
04:11:47,860 --> 04:11:47,920
Yeah, all the switches do the same thing.

5113
04:11:47,920 --> 04:11:48,800
What else is there?

5114
04:11:49,740 --> 04:11:50,540
I can't...

5115
04:11:50,540 --> 04:11:52,200
I can't get up here, so...

5116
04:11:52,200 --> 04:11:53,240
Oh wait, maybe I can shoot it.

5117
04:12:08,140 --> 04:12:08,940
Oh wait.

5118
04:12:08,940 --> 04:12:09,020
Wait.

5119
04:12:12,910 --> 04:12:14,070
Try the elevator, anybody?

5120
04:12:14,250 --> 04:12:16,790
Yep, that's exactly what Emery's about to do.

5121
04:12:17,490 --> 04:12:18,870
Yep, that's exactly what Emery's about to do.

5122
04:12:22,580 --> 04:12:23,100
Oh...

5123
04:12:23,100 --> 04:12:28,420
I wonder if I can get him a little bit.

5124
04:12:28,720 --> 04:12:29,240
I wonder if I can get him a little bit.

5125
04:12:31,300 --> 04:12:32,420
I don't think so.

5126
04:12:33,640 --> 04:12:36,480
Well that didn't do much...

5127
04:12:44,460 --> 04:12:46,300
Yeah, I wanna get the Cyber Demon.

5128
04:12:48,080 --> 04:12:50,800
But he's like way... in there.

5129
04:12:52,620 --> 04:12:53,800
Sniping with the eye maker?

5130
04:12:54,200 --> 04:12:55,380
That's such a good idea.

5131
04:12:56,000 --> 04:12:57,380
It's so thin, right?

5132
04:13:00,680 --> 04:13:01,360
Come here.

5133
04:13:02,300 --> 04:13:04,000
I keep missing my chance.

5134
04:13:05,180 --> 04:13:05,880
Come here!

5135
04:13:19,760 --> 04:13:21,080
How big is this hitbox?

5136
04:13:25,100 --> 04:13:26,320
I don't think it's working.

5137
04:13:29,260 --> 04:13:30,320
Maybe I get closer.

5138
04:13:33,420 --> 04:13:34,160
Oh, there we go!

5139
04:13:34,660 --> 04:13:35,300
I think.

5140
04:13:41,960 --> 04:13:43,260
I'm not seeing any blood.

5141
04:13:44,680 --> 04:13:46,160
I might just be wasting ammo.

5142
04:13:50,000 --> 04:13:51,780
I don't think it's working, you guys.

5143
04:14:07,200 --> 04:14:08,440
I don't think it's working!

5144
04:14:09,900 --> 04:14:11,080
It doesn't show damage?

5145
04:14:11,120 --> 04:14:11,700
Just keep shooting?

5146
04:14:11,900 --> 04:14:12,060
Okay.

5147
04:14:17,980 --> 04:14:19,220
Oh, that one definitely hit.

5148
04:14:19,300 --> 04:14:19,920
That one definitely hit.

5149
04:14:22,800 --> 04:14:23,200
Yeah!

5150
04:14:25,680 --> 04:14:26,080
Oh.

5151
04:14:46,550 --> 04:14:48,430
Oh my god, I did the real hacks.

5152
04:14:48,650 --> 04:14:51,490
I feel like a speed run... I mean, I didn't speed run it at all, but...

5153
04:14:53,290 --> 04:14:53,690
Oh...

5154
04:14:55,650 --> 04:14:56,670
What is that?

5155
04:14:57,410 --> 04:14:59,150
Wait, this is the same thing that I'm holding.

5156
04:15:00,390 --> 04:15:01,210
Oh my goodness.

5157
04:15:03,150 --> 04:15:05,150
They're like, hey, are you ready for this?

5158
04:15:05,330 --> 04:15:06,510
I don't think you are.

5159
04:15:07,250 --> 04:15:08,710
Wait, I'm at level 28!

5160
04:15:09,590 --> 04:15:10,030
Huh?

5161
04:15:10,770 --> 04:15:14,330
I'm at level 28.

5162
04:15:17,770 --> 04:15:19,010
Just grab everything.

5163
04:15:19,570 --> 04:15:20,010
BFG!

5164
04:15:29,760 --> 04:15:30,200
Um...

5165
04:15:41,910 --> 04:15:42,810
I'm scared.

5166
04:15:46,610 --> 04:15:47,930
I'm a bit frightened.

5167
04:15:49,130 --> 04:15:50,550
It's... it's quiet.

5168
04:15:52,330 --> 04:15:53,010
Oh!

5169
04:16:06,590 --> 04:16:08,870
Oh my god, what is this?

5170
04:17:10,860 --> 04:17:15,300
Oh my god, it's these... it's these damn... fossils, I swear!

5171
04:17:23,240 --> 04:17:23,920
Huh...

5172
04:17:23,920 --> 04:17:25,080
Huh...

5173
04:17:25,080 --> 04:17:27,080
I think I can just rock it from here.

5174
04:17:28,120 --> 04:17:28,960
Oh, shoot.

5175
04:17:41,700 --> 04:17:46,720
Where did that guy come from?

5176
04:17:52,040 --> 04:17:52,640
Uh-oh.

5177
04:17:52,700 --> 04:17:53,340
Uh-oh.

5178
04:17:53,360 --> 04:17:54,020
Uh-oh.

5179
04:17:54,020 --> 04:17:54,460
Oh!

5180
04:18:13,780 --> 04:18:15,900
It's like a floating fetus!

5181
04:18:16,040 --> 04:18:17,320
What is this thing?

5182
04:18:20,020 --> 04:18:21,040
BFG the crowd?

5183
04:18:21,340 --> 04:18:22,260
Oh, okay.

5184
04:18:22,880 --> 04:18:24,200
But it's so slow!

5185
04:18:24,520 --> 04:18:26,040
The BFG is so slow!

5186
04:18:27,340 --> 04:18:29,000
Please use the BFG.

5187
04:18:30,480 --> 04:18:31,700
Okay, okay, okay.

5188
04:18:32,080 --> 04:18:33,420
I'll use the BFG.

5189
04:18:33,820 --> 04:18:35,000
Okay, okay, okay.

5190
04:18:35,400 --> 04:18:36,560
I'll use the B...

5191
04:18:36,560 --> 04:18:37,900
Oh, wait, let me just load the game.

5192
04:18:38,040 --> 04:18:38,640
What am I doing?

5193
04:18:39,100 --> 04:18:40,360
Okay, okay, okay.

5194
04:18:40,360 --> 04:18:42,200
I'll use the BFG.

5195
04:18:43,720 --> 04:18:45,020
I'll use the BFG.

5196
04:18:46,840 --> 04:18:48,020
Okay, okay, okay.

5197
04:18:48,800 --> 04:18:50,100
Which one number is that?

5198
04:18:50,360 --> 04:18:51,180
Is this the BFG?

5199
04:18:52,120 --> 04:18:52,600
Yeah.

5200
04:19:00,560 --> 04:19:01,860
But it's so slow!

5201
04:19:02,000 --> 04:19:02,780
I'm nervous.

5202
04:19:04,400 --> 04:19:05,240
I'm nervous.

5203
04:19:05,380 --> 04:19:05,760
I'm nervous.

5204
04:19:07,460 --> 04:19:09,120
Well, I guess I'm gonna re-save.

5205
04:19:09,160 --> 04:19:10,280
Because once we come...

5206
04:19:10,280 --> 04:19:12,380
Once we get out everything, there's no coming back.

5207
04:19:12,560 --> 04:19:12,980
So...

5208
04:19:14,520 --> 04:19:15,000
Okay.

5209
04:19:15,640 --> 04:19:16,120
Okay.

5210
04:19:16,120 --> 04:19:16,360
Wait.

5211
04:19:16,440 --> 04:19:16,900
Oh, backpack.

5212
04:19:17,100 --> 04:19:17,440
Sorry.

5213
04:19:17,580 --> 04:19:17,980
Hold on.

5214
04:19:18,120 --> 04:19:19,500
And then...

5215
04:19:19,500 --> 04:19:20,320
Wait.

5216
04:19:21,680 --> 04:19:22,120
Save?

5217
04:19:24,480 --> 04:19:24,920
Yes.

5218
04:19:25,940 --> 04:19:26,380
Yeah.

5219
04:19:26,440 --> 04:19:27,460
Grab the invincibility.

5220
04:19:27,660 --> 04:19:27,980
Here we go!

5221
04:19:28,460 --> 04:19:29,140
Here we go!

5222
04:19:29,160 --> 04:19:29,460
Here we go!

5223
04:19:32,380 --> 04:19:33,000
Come on!

5224
04:19:33,100 --> 04:19:33,940
Hurry up, you guys!

5225
04:19:37,740 --> 04:19:38,180
I

5226
04:20:10,270 --> 04:20:12,330
don't think the BFG was really it, you guys.

5227
04:20:12,610 --> 04:20:13,270
Oh, shoot.

5228
04:20:13,730 --> 04:20:14,550
I'm just...

5229
04:20:14,550 --> 04:20:14,990
Oh, shoot.

5230
04:20:15,250 --> 04:20:15,910
Oh, shoot.

5231
04:20:16,210 --> 04:20:17,030
Oh, shoot.

5232
04:20:17,130 --> 04:20:19,250
I don't think that...

5233
04:20:19,250 --> 04:20:20,230
I don't think that was...

5234
04:20:20,230 --> 04:20:21,030
I don't think that was...

5235
04:20:21,030 --> 04:20:22,330
I don't think that was...

5236
04:20:22,330 --> 04:20:23,970
I don't think that was it...

5237
04:20:26,030 --> 04:20:27,210
I don't think...

5238
04:20:33,380 --> 04:20:34,540
I don't think...

5239
04:20:36,440 --> 04:20:37,900
BFG is close range.

5240
04:20:38,600 --> 04:20:39,080
Okay.

5241
04:20:40,620 --> 04:20:41,100
Okay.

5242
04:20:43,220 --> 04:20:43,700
Understandable.

5243
04:20:43,700 --> 04:20:45,020
I don't use it very often.

5244
04:20:45,140 --> 04:20:45,560
So...

5245
04:20:45,560 --> 04:20:45,780
Oh!

5246
04:20:45,800 --> 04:20:46,040
Oh!

5247
04:20:46,100 --> 04:20:46,340
Oh!

5248
04:20:46,340 --> 04:20:46,780
Run!

5249
04:20:47,060 --> 04:20:47,280
Run!

5250
04:20:47,280 --> 04:20:47,620
Run!

5251
04:20:47,620 --> 04:20:47,940
Run!

5252
04:20:48,020 --> 04:20:48,240
Run!

5253
04:21:35,860 --> 04:21:36,280
I think.

5254
04:21:36,900 --> 04:21:38,060
I think I'm so doomed.

5255
04:21:41,700 --> 04:21:43,340
Oh, there's a backside to this?

5256
04:21:48,880 --> 04:21:50,460
I think I'm so doomed.

5257
04:21:50,700 --> 04:21:51,520
I think I'm so doomed.

5258
04:21:52,660 --> 04:21:53,300
Hold on.

5259
04:21:55,160 --> 04:22:01,280
Are you guys sure the PFT... it uses way too much power for it to be like...

5260
04:22:02,180 --> 04:22:02,980
I don't know.

5261
04:22:03,620 --> 04:22:04,360
Okay, hold on.

5262
04:22:04,440 --> 04:22:06,740
Let me get my... this guy.

5263
04:22:06,740 --> 04:22:07,640
Oh my gosh.

5264
04:22:07,740 --> 04:22:08,360
Oh my gosh.

5265
04:22:08,380 --> 04:22:09,060
Oh my gosh.

5266
04:22:09,140 --> 04:22:09,740
Oh my gosh.

5267
04:22:19,060 --> 04:22:19,460
Please.

5268
04:22:20,160 --> 04:22:20,780
Oh my gosh.

5269
04:22:20,860 --> 04:22:21,080
Please.

5270
04:22:23,680 --> 04:22:24,940
I just run in circles.

5271
04:22:25,040 --> 04:22:25,660
Run in circles.

5272
04:22:25,740 --> 04:22:26,600
Run in circles, man.

5273
04:22:27,440 --> 04:22:28,260
Run in circles.

5274
04:22:28,340 --> 04:22:28,900
Run in circles.

5275
04:22:28,960 --> 04:22:29,720
Run in circles, man.

5276
04:22:31,180 --> 04:22:31,580
Doom.

5277
04:22:32,260 --> 04:22:32,980
Doom, guys.

5278
04:22:33,180 --> 04:22:34,160
Run in circles, man.

5279
04:22:34,280 --> 04:22:35,160
Run in circles, man.

5280
04:22:35,260 --> 04:22:36,080
Run in circles, man.

5281
04:22:43,100 --> 04:22:43,880
Oh my god.

5282
04:22:44,480 --> 04:22:44,880
Bitch.

5283
04:22:49,790 --> 04:22:51,290
They're so annoying!

5284
04:22:51,970 --> 04:22:53,970
They're the worst enemy in the world!

5285
04:22:54,650 --> 04:22:59,310
They're the most obnoxious thing I've ever had to encounter in my life!

5286
04:23:00,530 --> 04:23:01,610
And afterlife!

5287
04:23:02,210 --> 04:23:03,170
And everything!

5288
04:23:03,710 --> 04:23:05,190
And in my whole existence!

5289
04:23:13,730 --> 04:23:17,450
I think these guys are going to make me become the Joker for real.

5290
04:23:18,330 --> 04:23:19,470
Please, please!

5291
04:23:21,610 --> 04:23:22,370
No!

5292
04:23:24,780 --> 04:23:25,720
I pressed 4!

5293
04:23:27,300 --> 04:23:30,420
I think I accidentally pressed 5 instead of...

5294
04:23:36,960 --> 04:23:38,580
Oh my god!

5295
04:23:39,760 --> 04:23:41,440
There's still another one!

5296
04:23:43,300 --> 04:23:46,000
And I have no more ammo for this guy.

5297
04:23:59,580 --> 04:24:00,340
What the hell?

5298
04:24:00,480 --> 04:24:01,940
How did I take damage?

5299
04:24:02,080 --> 04:24:02,440
Was it me?

5300
04:24:03,980 --> 04:24:04,680
Splash damage?

5301
04:24:05,200 --> 04:24:05,660
Ouch!

5302
04:24:05,780 --> 04:24:06,460
Oh my god!

5303
04:24:06,520 --> 04:24:06,860
I'm flying!

5304
04:24:11,620 --> 04:24:12,760
What the heck?

5305
04:24:17,770 --> 04:24:18,410
BFG now?

5306
04:24:18,550 --> 04:24:19,650
I had no ammo!

5307
04:24:19,910 --> 04:24:20,890
What are you talking about?

5308
04:24:23,750 --> 04:24:24,210
Ammo!

5309
04:24:24,750 --> 04:24:27,170
I had no more BFG ammo!

5310
04:24:27,810 --> 04:24:28,950
I used it all!

5311
04:24:31,770 --> 04:24:34,330
Okay, hold on.

5312
04:24:40,470 --> 04:24:41,710
I think I was an idiot.

5313
04:24:42,190 --> 04:24:45,010
BFG is for when they are all spawned in in a big crowd.

5314
04:24:45,590 --> 04:24:47,590
You need to let them come into the area first.

5315
04:24:47,730 --> 04:24:48,550
Maybe chain gun.

5316
04:24:48,730 --> 04:24:48,990
Okay.

5317
04:24:50,950 --> 04:24:52,730
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

5318
04:24:54,210 --> 04:24:56,610
My W key wasn't working for a second.

5319
04:24:59,130 --> 04:25:00,150
Come on!

5320
04:25:02,750 --> 04:25:03,430
We're

5321
04:25:17,090 --> 04:25:17,670
so close!

5322
04:25:19,050 --> 04:25:19,730
I'm

5323
04:25:26,090 --> 04:25:26,810
gonna die!

5324
04:26:00,220 --> 04:26:02,460
Why is the BFG so bad?

5325
04:26:06,140 --> 04:26:08,720
Everyone is giving different answers so it's just so confusing.

5326
04:26:09,080 --> 04:26:12,460
But I did the best when I did it my own way.

5327
04:26:12,660 --> 04:26:13,020
So...

5328
04:26:14,060 --> 04:26:15,060
But also...

5329
04:26:15,060 --> 04:26:16,860
I gotta go to a meeting, you guys.

5330
04:26:18,120 --> 04:26:21,320
Oh my gosh, my Discord just was totally off.

5331
04:26:46,860 --> 04:26:47,860
Okey dokey.

5332
04:26:55,900 --> 04:26:56,400
Okay.

5333
04:26:57,320 --> 04:26:57,820
Man!

5334
04:26:58,720 --> 04:27:00,560
On the very last thing!

5335
04:27:00,940 --> 04:27:03,680
I'm gonna look up some guides on how to... what to do.

5336
04:27:07,520 --> 04:27:10,220
I'll see if after my meeting if I can continue.

5337
04:27:11,260 --> 04:27:11,660
Um...

5338
04:27:12,360 --> 04:27:15,220
The boss is BS, but I know you can beat it.

5339
04:27:15,260 --> 04:27:16,160
Good luck at the meeting.

5340
04:27:16,340 --> 04:27:16,860
Thank you!

5341
04:27:17,060 --> 04:27:17,360
What?

5342
04:27:17,480 --> 04:27:18,640
This is such BS!

5343
04:27:18,820 --> 04:27:19,860
What is this?

5344
04:27:20,600 --> 04:27:21,480
Oh my gosh!

5345
04:27:21,480 --> 04:27:22,240
It's just a...

5346
04:27:22,240 --> 04:27:23,260
It's just a...

5347
04:27:23,260 --> 04:27:24,020
Pew-pew!

5348
04:27:24,460 --> 04:27:24,860
Everything!

5349
04:27:25,760 --> 04:27:26,440
Give them out!

5350
04:27:26,560 --> 04:27:30,360
But they need to give you more ammo after you defeat all of them, I think.

5351
04:27:32,580 --> 04:27:32,980
Um...

5352
04:27:32,980 --> 04:27:34,380
The boss itself is kinda cheap.

5353
04:27:34,460 --> 04:27:34,620
Yeah!

5354
04:27:34,740 --> 04:27:35,920
And he's got the homing!

5355
04:27:35,920 --> 04:27:37,440
You first have to deal with so much!

5356
04:27:37,600 --> 04:27:38,640
And then he's got...

5357
04:27:38,640 --> 04:27:40,000
He shoots you into the air!

5358
04:27:40,000 --> 04:27:41,220
And you got the homing!

5359
04:27:41,380 --> 04:27:41,800
Everything!

5360
04:27:42,180 --> 04:27:42,980
And this and that!

5361
04:27:45,820 --> 04:27:46,960
Thank you, thank you!

5362
04:27:48,760 --> 04:27:51,240
Whatever the meeting is about, I hope it goes well.

5363
04:27:51,340 --> 04:27:51,880
Thank you for the stream.

5364
04:27:52,000 --> 04:27:52,600
Thank you!

5365
04:27:52,720 --> 04:27:53,500
Thank you, thank you.

5366
04:27:53,520 --> 04:27:56,280
Sorry that I've been having so much stuff...

5367
04:27:57,860 --> 04:27:59,120
That interferes with stream.

5368
04:28:01,040 --> 04:28:01,460
But...

5369
04:28:02,940 --> 04:28:04,260
Yeah, like I said...

5370
04:28:04,260 --> 04:28:04,920
Wait...

5371
04:28:04,920 --> 04:28:06,100
I'm just gonna...

5372
04:28:06,100 --> 04:28:08,740
You know, I am gonna save this one as well.

5373
04:28:09,360 --> 04:28:10,040
Oh wait...

5374
04:28:10,040 --> 04:28:10,160
Oh!

5375
04:28:10,260 --> 04:28:11,600
I almost saved over the last thing.

5376
04:28:12,420 --> 04:28:12,820
Yes...

5377
04:28:12,820 --> 04:28:13,180
Um...

5378
04:28:13,180 --> 04:28:13,780
Just in case.

5379
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:16,200
I think they give you everything that you need...

5380
04:28:17,440 --> 04:28:18,580
At the beginning of this.

5381
04:28:18,840 --> 04:28:19,240
But...

5382
04:28:19,700 --> 04:28:20,100
Um...

5383
04:28:20,100 --> 04:28:21,260
You know...

5384
04:28:24,100 --> 04:28:25,620
I will see you guys...

5385
04:28:25,620 --> 04:28:26,420
Maybe later.

5386
04:28:26,660 --> 04:28:27,240
I don't...

5387
04:28:27,240 --> 04:28:28,940
Like I said, I don't know how long this is gonna be.

5388
04:28:29,200 --> 04:28:32,920
If it's like a half hour to 45 minutes, then I'll probably stream afterwards.

5389
04:28:33,260 --> 04:28:35,240
But if it's a little bit longer...

5390
04:28:36,580 --> 04:28:36,980
Um...

5391
04:28:37,640 --> 04:28:38,040
And...

5392
04:28:38,040 --> 04:28:38,720
This is the last one.

5393
04:28:38,720 --> 04:28:39,260
This is the last level.

5394
04:28:39,340 --> 04:28:39,680
Please...

5395
04:28:39,680 --> 04:28:39,980
Right?

5396
04:28:40,140 --> 04:28:41,460
It is the last level.

5397
04:28:41,580 --> 04:28:41,720
Right?

5398
04:28:41,860 --> 04:28:43,240
And Draco's thanks for the 10 gifted.

5399
04:28:43,420 --> 04:28:45,620
Cause if it's not the last level, I'm not gonna...

5400
04:28:46,320 --> 04:28:47,920
I'm not gonna stream.

5401
04:28:48,100 --> 04:28:48,560
It is...

5402
04:28:48,560 --> 04:28:48,980
Okay...

5403
04:28:49,800 --> 04:28:50,600
Mint phantom.

5404
04:28:52,220 --> 04:28:52,620
Okay...

5405
04:28:52,620 --> 04:28:54,280
Because I really wanna beat it today.

5406
04:28:55,100 --> 04:28:55,480
Um...

5407
04:28:56,280 --> 04:28:56,680
Dang...

5408
04:28:56,680 --> 04:28:57,480
I was so close.

5409
04:28:57,600 --> 04:28:58,500
I was so close to...

5410
04:28:58,500 --> 04:28:58,940
I was like...

5411
04:28:58,940 --> 04:29:00,400
Man, I think I'll be able to beat it today.

5412
04:29:00,700 --> 04:29:01,860
I was so close.

5413
04:29:02,560 --> 04:29:03,180
I'm really...

5414
04:29:03,180 --> 04:29:04,580
Do you have a copy of Ace Combat 2?

5415
04:29:05,060 --> 04:29:05,460
Uh...

5416
04:29:05,460 --> 04:29:06,480
I believe so.

5417
04:29:06,560 --> 04:29:06,780
Yes.

5418
04:29:07,780 --> 04:29:08,180
Okay...

5419
04:29:08,180 --> 04:29:08,700
So...

5420
04:29:09,360 --> 04:29:10,220
But thank you.

5421
04:29:12,800 --> 04:29:13,240
Um...

5422
04:29:14,320 --> 04:29:14,760
Okay!

5423
04:29:15,080 --> 04:29:15,740
See you soon!

5424
04:29:16,020 --> 04:29:16,780
See you soon!

5425
04:29:17,020 --> 04:29:17,740
Go to your meeting!

5426
04:29:17,880 --> 04:29:18,300
Thank you!

5427
04:29:18,380 --> 04:29:19,020
I'm gonna go...

5428
04:29:19,020 --> 04:29:20,720
I'm gonna go party and then I'm gonna go to my meeting.

5429
04:29:21,860 --> 04:29:22,300
Um...

5430
04:29:23,420 --> 04:29:25,300
And then I'll see you guys...

5431
04:29:26,320 --> 04:29:27,060
Maybe later!

5432
04:29:27,680 --> 04:29:28,120
See you!

5433
04:29:31,130 --> 04:29:31,510
Bye bye!

5434
04:29:31,510 --> 04:29:31,950
Bye bye!

5435
04:29:32,030 --> 04:29:32,750
Bye bye!

5436
04:29:42,840 --> 04:29:44,000
I'm so frustrated.

5437
04:29:44,700 --> 04:29:45,140
Hahaha!

5438
04:29:46,280 --> 04:29:46,720
Wow...

5439
04:29:47,680 --> 04:29:49,200
I was like, I can do this.

5440
04:29:49,480 --> 04:29:50,360
What the heck?

5441
04:29:50,680 --> 04:29:52,560
I'm so... what the heck?

5442
04:29:53,160 --> 04:29:53,920
It's okay though.

5443
04:29:54,220 --> 04:29:54,800
It's okay.

5444
04:29:54,940 --> 04:29:57,960
I'll get through the meeting and then I'll do my best to finish it.

5445
04:29:58,500 --> 04:29:59,900
Like I said, I'm gonna look up a guide.

5446
04:30:00,060 --> 04:30:06,620
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and I'm gonna look up, like, so-and-so beating the final boss.

5447
04:30:13,160 --> 04:30:14,320
Surely a cool game.

5448
04:30:14,620 --> 04:30:15,100
I know!

5449
04:30:15,500 --> 04:30:16,260
Do it in the movie.

5450
04:30:18,440 --> 04:30:25,500
Okay, I'm just gonna not- I'll just keep streaming but I'll turn off my mic and turn off all the sound and you guys can just watch me.

5451
04:30:27,080 --> 04:30:28,600
How to beat area 27.

5452
04:30:28,980 --> 04:30:29,460
No, 28!

5453
04:30:29,920 --> 04:30:30,660
28, 28.

5454
04:30:31,240 --> 04:30:31,680
Okay.

5455
04:30:31,880 --> 04:30:32,320
Otomito!

5456
04:30:32,480 --> 04:30:32,940
Bye bye!
