1
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,180
It's spooky in here!

2
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,000
It's spooky in here!

3
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,960
I've got really big glasses today.

4
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,020
You like my glasses?

5
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,560
Well, today I might be a bit of a clown, so...

6
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,260
How about princess?

7
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,360
to dance with the devil?

8
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,300
Yeah.

9
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Wait, hold on.

10
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,880
Let me adjust my...

11
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
My mic is always falling.

12
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,300
Like, it's always...

13
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,580
The mic stand is always wanting to move around.

14
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,940
Hello!

15
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,920
We are back.

16
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,200
Half-Life 2.

17
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,440
Hi!

18
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,780
I was like, oh, I should play more Half-Life.

19
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
And I was like, why do I feel so hesitant about it?

20
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,400
And I was like, oh, I remember.

21
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,300
where I left off.

22
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
And then I was like, well, I'm going to watch.

23
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm going to watch a how-to video, like a Let's Play.

24
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm going to watch a Let's Play.

25
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,300
And what I saw really made me mad.

26
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,120
So I'm going to try it and see if it works.

27
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,780
I was like...

28
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,260
Huh?

29
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,860
Let's play The Ancient Texts.

30
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,040
Yeah.

31
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,760
For real.

32
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,580
Oh my gosh, Torgo!

33
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,640
Thank you for the peek!

34
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,060
Watch the fantastic reality Vaughn.

35
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,060
You're amazing!

36
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,700
You're singing, dancing, stage prizes!

37
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,100
Ah, thank you!

38
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,360
Pinned a link for non-Twitter folks.

39
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,900
Oh, I was going to post about it on YouTube.

40
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,740
Community.

41
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,240
I don't have the link on me right now, but I was going to post it.

42
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,280
I will do that another stream.

43
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you, though.

44
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,740
Thank you.

45
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:09,660
Thank you.

46
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,340
Um...

47
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,260
But don't listen too hard because my voice was...

48
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,440
was pretty rough.

49
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,100
Yeah.

50
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,640
But, um, yeah, I watched the thing.

51
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm gonna try and do it.

52
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,120
You can do it.

53
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,660
Cheese that room.

54
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,240
It seemed like a cheese.

55
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,520
It seemed like a cheese.

56
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,260
So...

57
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,680
I get hit by tariffs for all the MGS merch.

58
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,300
Yeah.

59
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

60
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,760
I did.

61
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,780
Yeah.

62
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,820
I did.

63
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,640
Open your Half-Life series.

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,540
Thank you!

65
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,340
I bought a bunch of Metal Gear acrylics.

66
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,100
But I'm excited because I'm going to open two of them.

67
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,960
Okay, so they sold acrylics of almost every character from 1, 2, 3, 4.

68
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,340
Peace Walker, and V.

69
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,500
I didn't end up buying any of from V because I felt I was already going a little insane.

70
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,940
But you could buy boxes of each of the games as well.

71
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,800
And I'm pretty sure boxes have one of each character.

72
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,460
They should, no?

73
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,840
I don't know how gotcha works, to be honest.

74
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,260
But...

75
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,680
Um...

76
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,200
But...

77
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,220
I think it depends.

78
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,420
I think it depends.

79
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,580
But, um...

80
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,780
When I was purchasing them, they had run out of boxes for Peace Walker and 4.

81
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,080
So I had to buy those individually.

82
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,780
I bought 10 of them individually.

83
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,180
So...

84
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,400
Um...

85
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,120
That's true gotcha.

86
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,120
And I will unbox them on stream.

87
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,000
Hmm.

88
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,500
10 Huey incoming.

89
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,960
I know!

90
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:19,460
But the other ones Might be okay Yeah, yeah, yeah I think I watched your set in the VOD About three times now Looks so good You think so?

91
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,820
Thank you Thank you of the prison What is your wisdom?

92
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
Don't use a spoon

93
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:41,960
Yeah, I imagine for For Peace Walker I'll get all Hueys And for four I'll get all Naomi's Yeah, I imagine Spank, thank you.

94
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360

95
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,320
Got my new credit card today, Minky.

96
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,940
No!

97
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,980
Oh my gosh, sulking.

98
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,570
Please be responsible with your money, okay, everybody?

99
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,220
Please be financially responsible.

100
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,620
Anyway, um, uh, what was I gonna say?

101
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,540
Oh, before I start, I do want to say, wait, the box sets are also on Ami-Ami.

102
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,700
Description says all types can be collected by purchasing one box.

103
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,960
Oh, wait, they're on Ami-Ami-Ami too?

104
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,580
Oh, wait, it's a good thing I didn't get it on Ami-Ami because they stopped shipping for it now.

105
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:43,120
My Koharu, actually, my Koharu, I got a Koharu, um, desk mat and...

106
00:09:43,820 --> 00:10:21,640

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm also your mom, Dr. Doak.

109
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm your mom.

110
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,460
Minke donations don't impact my livelihood.

111
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,660
That's very good to hear.

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,300
Thank you.

113
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,740
Seeing Minto and Freeman's outfit in the thumbnail art makes me wonder how she'd look in Samus' zero suit.

114
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm about to fight the end.

115
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm following your way of non-lethal all the way.

116
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,620
Let's go!

117
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,040
Get the camos that way.

118
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm feeling...

119
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,140
I'm not gonna lie.

120
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm feeling not burnt out over half-life.

121
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,200
But I'm ready to beat the...

122
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm ready to get the game.

123
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,380
I'm ready to be done with the game.

124
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,920
I think maybe...

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,460
Maybe last time because I wasn't feeling so well.

126
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,240
I have a bit of a sour taste.

127
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,880
I'm ready to move on to another game.

128
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,440
It's been five parts now.

129
00:11:41,340 --> 00:12:10,520
but um i don't know i don't know if i'll finish today or if one more i guess we shall see i kind of have to be up early ish tomorrow because i will be having meet and greet at vexpo so kobats it's your birthday no request for a nyaruko humming just want to say thanks for liking my good morning minto flower post sometimes yeah thanks for posting them they're so sweet.

130

Happy birthday, combat!

131
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,520
Happy, happy birthday.

132
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,430
Gonna be a long one if you want to finish.

133
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,390
I think I looked it up.

134
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,090
There's four more chapters.

135
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,890
But it really depends on if they are so long or not.

136
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,390
Maybe probably just one more stream than after this.

137
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,170
What do you think of Half-Life so far?

138
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,810
I really do like it.

139
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,130
I really do.

140
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,350
I am having a lot of fun with it, so.

141
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,230
As credit starts to roll, Gabe rolls out.

142
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,210
And to announce Half-Life 3 button, covered in inches of dust.

143
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,430
And also, before I start, I have a little something, a little treat I want to try.

144
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,130
I'm doing a taste test on stream of Werther's original.

145
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,910
But it's not like the granny so much.

146
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,510
Oh my gosh, wait, this is stuck.

147
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,150
It's caramel, but it's pumpkin spice flavored.

148
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, but it's really gooey.

149
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,230
It's like stuck to the paper.

150
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,910
Wait, it's like really...

151
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,070
It's really stuck.

152
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,830
Okay, good thing Grandma's not eating this.

153
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,350
Her dentures would fall out.

154
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,070
Or anybody with veneers.

155
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,310
Oh my gosh.

156
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,390
Can people with veneers have gum?

157
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,230
Hmm.

158
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,690
I just finished playing through Half-Life 2 to remember.

159
00:13:41,370 --> 00:14:07,490
gonna tell you the feeling of wanting to be done doesn't go away cheese at every chance i don't know how to cheese in the game half-life one and two are both from an era when we couldn't move on to another game nearly as easily as now so they definitely drag on a bit more that is so fair actually though that's very fair i oh yeah there's so much

160
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,570
There's so much on the paper.

161
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,100
It's really yummy.

162
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,740
It's not hard to chew at all.

163
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,800
It's very soft.

164
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,360
It's caramel.

165
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,500
It's really soft.

166
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,500
I recommend it.

167
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,900
It's yummy.

168
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,760
Mmm.

169
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,190
I recommend it, but maybe freeze it or something.

170
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,850
It's like, oh, it's really super soft.

171
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,370
I think I'm going to choke on this.

172
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,190
It's like a super soft caramel.

173
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:42,970
Oh.

174
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,250
I mean, it tangled me.

175
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,950
Yeah, I think after this, there was four more chapters, so I guess it really depends on...

176
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,750
I think we'll do two streams.

177
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,470
I don't want to rush it either at the same time.

178
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,610
You know, I don't want to, like...

179
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,550
Wait, am I in mid?

180
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:05,850
Wait.

181
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,250
Are they coming or...

182
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:08,430
Wait.

183
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,280
Wait, why is this guy here?

184
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,530
Am I...

185
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,950
Mid-mission?

186
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,810
Also, when I watch that tutorial, it should...

187
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,190
Ow!

188
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,590
Ow!

189
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,250
The caramel is in my teeth and it hurts!

190
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,390
Ow!

191
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,380
You know when it's, like, so sweet in your teeth?

192
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,580
Uh-oh, I hope I don't have cavities.

193
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,340
That would be one hell of a way to...

194
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,160
To find out on stream.

195
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,100
Okay, so basically what they did was they did this.

196
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:13,660
was they wait I think wait I don't remember which one they put it in wait I don't remember which I think they stood in this one

197
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:27,060
look at all these health packs holy moly okay so they did this and then okay but you gotta put this one in here.

198
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,980
Wait, how much way does it face?

199
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,740
Okay, like that.

200
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,500
And then they stood in this one, and then they put this one.

201
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
Is this backwards?

202
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,640
Oh, yeah, it's totally backwards.

203
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,040
Just a little bit more, like that.

204
00:17:59,560 --> 00:17:59,840
Maybe?

205
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,320
Okay.

206
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
And then they did this one.

207
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,560
But let's put all this in here.

208
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,280
And I just...

209
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,380
I just chill in here.

210
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,940
And then sometimes...

211
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,020
I get...

212
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,340
Sometimes I...

213
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,700
Maybe we'll be okay.

214
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,080
I don't know.

215
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
I don't know.

216
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,420
Okay, I have to do this last one fast, I think.

217
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm scared, though.

218
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,620
I'm scared.

219
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,180
I'm gonna save.

220
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,560
Okay, I saved now.

221
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,480
And then we'll do this last one.

222
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay.

223
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,400
Save for the setup.

224
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:43,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,400
Way ahead of you.

226
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,700
Way ahead of you.

227
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,060
First time it took me a few hours to get through this section.

228
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,380
Last time, like 10 minutes.

229
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,320
Okay.

230
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,660
Okay.

231
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,380
I think if I use the grab gun on the...

232
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,820
What are those called?

233
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,520
The things that fly and slice and dice you.

234
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,580
I can't remember for some reason.

235
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:45,940
um is the left one backwards yeah it's not this one is set up this one is set up this one is not set up yet the man hacks yeah yeah yeah this is probably the hardest part of the game oh my gosh you can use grab gun on grenades too oh i will try to remember that thank you that's actually really helpful i think and then sometimes i think we need to leave and shoot maybe the guys up there

236
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,280
I'm nervous right now.

237
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,400
Because I don't know if I'm gonna set it up in time properly.

238
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,780
I'm scared, okay.

239
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,920
Okay.

240
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,380
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,040
Be fine trust.

242
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,060
Okay, I'm gonna save them.

243
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,140
Oh.

244
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,480
Uh, get in there.

245
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,260
Get in there!

246
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,080
Get in there properly, please.

247
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,760
No, please, please, properly.

248
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,220
Okay, please, properly.

249
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,360
Please, properly.

250
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay, oh my gosh.

251
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,240
Here we go.

252
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,080
Theoretically, I should be fine.

253
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,860
Just here.

254
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,820
I don't know if my one on the left is working properly.

255
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,680
Oh, gosh.

256
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,440
Theoretically.

257
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,770
Theoretically.

258
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,470
Theoretically.

259
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,310
Hold!

260
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,170
Should I try another candy?

261
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,310
More soldiers.

262
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,230
Wait, that was so fast.

263
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,090
Already?

264
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,090
Wait, what?

265
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,360
I hear them.

266
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,420
Okay.

267
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,780
It's working.

268
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,460
It's working.

269
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,580
Wait.

270
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,660
Did I hear a manhawk?

271
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,140
It's working?

272
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,940
It's working?

273
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,460
It's working?

274
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,800
More soldiers are coming, Gordon.

275
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,040
It's working!

276
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,770
The AFK strike!

277
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,500
Does

278
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,710
something fall?

279
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,970
I can't, yeah, I don't know.

280
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,240
I've hit a mother load of soldiers.

281
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,640
They're coming in from everywhere.

282
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,580
I feel like I should save.

283
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,080
Oh,

284
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,650
something hit me.

285
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,590
I'm not quite sure what.

286
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,150
We lived.

287
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,410
Stubbed toe?

288
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,020
Minus eight shield reset.

289
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,840
Okay, Gordon, I'm going to leave off here.

290
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,680
and catch up with you.

291
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,900
Be there as soon as I can.

292
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,020
Wait, was that a grenade?

293
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,300
No.

294
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,590
Was that it?

295
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,200
It was not.

296
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,920
Survive the second turret standoff.

297
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,600
Wait, there's more?

298
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,800
Gordon!

299
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:19,820
Oh!

300
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,310
Um...

301
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,590
Sorry to take so long, Gordon.

302
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,270
Gordon looks like you could have used some help.

303
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,050
I won't leave you again though No, let's track down Mossman.

304
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,970
I did save.

305
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,370
I'll save again.

306
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:49,730
Oh My god I don't remember what what video I saw on YouTube.

307
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,890
I don't remember who it was but good golly.

308
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,830
I could kiss him

309
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,750
What the hell?

310
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,590
Thank you for the gifted!

311
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,070
Thank you, Winter.

312
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,060
Oh, my stinking god.

313
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,360
I thought I was going to be fighting for my afterlife in here.

314
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,960
I thought it was going to be the worst time ever.

315
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,720
And that was it.

316
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,840
No, guys, it was me.

317
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,680
You're welcome.

318
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,960
I made that.

319
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,700
video.

320
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,490
Oh, what did I...

321
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,890
What did I just do?

322
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,670
Okay.

323
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,970
Actually, let's go back to my shotgun.

324
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,030
And there's more here!

325
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,870
They were like, you're gonna have a bad time.

326
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,190
Absolutely cheesed it.

327
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,160
Thorne, welcome to membership!

328
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,340
I should re-title my stream How to Get Away.

329
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,980
How to do this chapter.

330
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,840
Easy mode.

331
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,880
No issues at all.

332
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,410
You're not going to leave me, right, Alex?

333
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:23,950
Look at her.

334
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,990
She looks ready to fight.

335
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,750
What are you looking at?

336
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,590
His shifty eyes.

337
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,490
Uh-oh.

338
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,540
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

339
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,520
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

340
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,300
Oh my god.

341
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,420
Is there anything I can take?

342
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,640
Brutal.

343
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,040
They're still alive.

344
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,020
Maybe I shouldn't have used my shotgun.

345
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,540
Okay.

346
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,480
So I started blasting.

347
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,420
Maybe I underestimated how many guys were going to be there.

348
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Maybe I thought it would be like three.

349
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:58,970
Wow.

350
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,410
Look how old that computer is.

351
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,630
Great.

352
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,310
Another security station.

353
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,430
Oh no.

354
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,390
Are we gonna do that whole thing again?

355
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:11,690
Huh.

356
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,600
All fire modes, yeah.

357
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,780
Oh, nice.

358
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,880
Uh-oh.

359
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,420
Well, come on, Gordon.

360
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,940
We don't want to keep her waiting.

361
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:23,960
Okay.

362
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,230
Where are they coming from?

363
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:33,730
Whoa.

364
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,060
I'm here!

365
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,180
Don't yell at me!

366
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,280
Let me seal this door.

367
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,260
Yeah.

368
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,460
Seal it?

369
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,360
Alright, nice.

370
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,480
Oh, okay.

371
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,020
Wish I could have gotten the help.

372
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,400
There she is.

373
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,840
Leave it talking to me, Gordon.

374
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:52,800
Wait, where are you?

375
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,420
I'm not good with words.

376
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,920
Hello?

377
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,520
Oh, thank God somewhere.

378
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,220
Alex?

379
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,480
Gordon, how did you get in here?

380
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,160
We know all about you and Brain.

381
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,020
Yeah.

382
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,500
You've been a spy for the Combine the whole time.

383
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,060
Yeah.

384
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,060
Damn it.

385
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,480
Move back, Mosman.

386
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,800
We're coming in.

387
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,740
We're coming in.

388
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,800
Alex, whatever you may think, I assure you I have worked to protect your father.

389
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,520
Shut up and be glad you're still some use to us.

390
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,680
We're going to reconfigure this teleport and get the hell out of here.

391
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,240
You see, we're working to the same end.

392
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,960
I've already reprogrammed the modulator to emulate a Zen relay.

393
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
That's my father's work, you stole.

394
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,300
It's my work, too.

395
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,420
And I had to prove to Dr. Brain that your father would be the most valuable member of any research effort going forward.

396
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,480
Enough of your bullshit!

397
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,940
Where's my dad?

398
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm going to bring him in.

399
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,220
Oh, in here?

400
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,620
You sound Eli?

401
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,420
No thanks to you.

402
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,360
Just enter the coordinates for Dr. Kleiner's lab and let's get moving.

403
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,660
Uh oh.

404
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,960
But we need access to the teleport platform and we're locked out.

405
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,620
I'll take care of that.

406
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,880
They're not gonna come in though.

407
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,460
Okay, let's go.

408
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,780
What's in here?

409
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,800
Whoa!

410
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,460
Whoa!

411
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,060
Oh

412
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,080
This fight is tough.

413
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,900
Oh, okay.

414
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,760
I'm prepared.

415
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm not prepared.

416
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,560
I'm I'm not prepared.

417
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:52,520
It looks like it's waiting for us The combine use a peculiar pulse forming network with a very long rise time takes quite a while to recharge So you've warmed it up for us good and just in is it her gonna kill her?

418
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,140
Dad, down here.

419
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,480
Papa!

420
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,460
Sorry we took so long.

421
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,900
I hope that wasn't too bad for you.

422
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
Don't worry about me, sweetheart.

423
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,660
Judith!

424
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,340
I see they set you free.

425
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,440
Not exactly.

426
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,300
Eli, I was so worried about you.

427
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,700
The coordinates, Dr. Mossman.

428
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,220
The coordinates.

429
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,960
So, this is the combine.

430
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
This looks so fun.

431
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,520
I want to be in there.

432
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,420
Hurry up, Mossman.

433
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,810
I brought one of the turrets.

434
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,570
Yes, Alex.

435
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,550
Where are you?

436
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,150
We're in Noah Prospect.

437
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,510
Oh, Super Chat, what?

438
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,510
Are you ready for us?

439
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,870
Noah's Six Flags ride.

440
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,850
Ready, willing, and fully enabled.

441
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,670
Good.

442
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,450
We'll send my dad through first.

443
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,070
He's in position for...

444
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,570
Uh-oh.

445
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,510
What's that?

446
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,110
Hold on, gotta bring this back down.

447
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,070
Yo!

448
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:51,790
Yo!

449
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,530
Stop!

450
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,670
What are you doing?

451
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,610
I'm sorry, Alex.

452
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,850
It's the only...

453
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,050
No!

454
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,230
What's going on, Alex?

455
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,310
No!

456
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,140
Is something coming through?

457
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,400
Or...

458
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,180
Are we in trouble?

459
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,400
Dr. Kleiner, you have to stop them.

460
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,840
Oh my god.

461
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,800
Gordon, what coordinates are these?

462
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,420
Where the hell did she take him?

463
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,200
Uh-oh.

464
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,900
No.

465
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,140
Cover me, Gordon.

466
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:32,800
Oh.

467
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,940
I've got to reset the portal.

468
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:34,760
Okay.

469
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,140
Gordon, use the turrets.

470
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,540
Use turrets?

471
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,080
Where?

472
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,480
Oh, over there.

473
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,100
Where do I put them?

474
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,440
I

475
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,540
don't know where they're going to come from.

476
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,280
Ah!

477
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,700
Oh, shoot.

478
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,280
Oh, shoot.

479
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,080
Hi.

480
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,620
Don't don't ain't not at me.

481
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,460
Where are they going to come from?

482
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,340
All through there?

483
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh, man.

484
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,600
Oh my god!

485
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,700
Over here too!

486
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,110
I'm trying!

487
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,370
Okay, ma'am.

488
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,230
I'm trying, I'm trying!

489
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,920
Can she die?

490
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
Can she die in this part?

491
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm scared.

492
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,400
So maybe not this guy.

493
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,670
Oh, she can!

494
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,670
Okay.

495
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,450
Oh my gosh.

496
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,250
Oh my gosh.

497
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,390
Oh my gosh.

498
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:38,770
Please.

499
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,270
Where

500
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,750
did that guy come from?

501
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,030
Uh, you're telling me.

502
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,730
Okay, so there are guys coming from over there.

503
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,130
Okay, good.

504
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,010
Watch the turrets!

505
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,090
Watch the turrets!

506
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,310
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

507
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,610
Oh, good job, good job, team.

508
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,070
Uh...

509
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:13,910
Almost?

510
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,730
Okay, are you sure?

511
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:16,650
We sure?

512
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,570
We sure about that?

513
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,430
Where is he?

514
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,730
Oh, there it is.

515
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,250
Get his ass!

516
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,250
Get his ass!

517
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,870
Okay, let's go!

518
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,870
I'm waiting on you!

519
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,720
Can we go?

520
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,640
I'm in, I'm in!

521
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,800
Oh my god,

522
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,970
we made it!

523
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,490
My god, we made it.

524
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,510
Oh my god, we made it.

525
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,430
Where's Dr. Kleiner?

526
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,950
Oh my god, we made it.

527
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,490
Oh my god, we made it.

528
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,970
Dr. Kleiner, let us out!

529
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,130
Uh-oh.

530
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,650
I don't think that's Dr. Kleiner.

531
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:37,670
Alex?

532
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,750
Gordon?

533
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,350
My god, how did you get here?

534
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,310
And when?

535
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,390
What's wrong?

536
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,670
My dear, I...

537
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,630
I had given up hope of ever seeing you again.

538
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,070
I was afraid we might not make it either.

539
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,010
I think the teleport exploded just as we were porting out.

540
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,910
Indeed, it did.

541
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,070
Take his gun.

542
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,950
Reproductions were felt far and wide, but that was over a week ago.

543
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:01,470
What?

544
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,570
Gordon and I were just there a minute ago.

545
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,070
Fascinating.

546
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,070
We seem to have developed a very slow teleport.

547
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:10,710
Whoa.

548
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,850
This suggests an entirely new line of investigation.

549
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,030
A week?

550
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,210
Then what have we missed?

551
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,970
A great deal, my dear.

552
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,430
Oh, gosh.

553
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,350
The blow you struck at Nova Prospect was taken as a signal to begin the uprising.

554
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,350
But what about my father?

555
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,330
Well, that is most troubling.

556
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,110
According to the Vortigants, he is a prisoner at the Citadel.

557
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,430
We've got to get my father out.

558
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,590
We've just got him out of jail.

559
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,150
And another of your friends arrived several days ago.

560
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:45,550
Yeah?

561
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,270
Dog!

562
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,170
You made it!

563
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:47,830
Dog!

564
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,530
Oh my god!

565
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,210
See, it's not all hopeless.

566
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,110
I wish I shared your optimism.

567
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,190
Doctor.

568
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,050
Doc, come in.

569
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,550
Are you there?

570
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,170
Vardy!

571
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,550
Hey, Doc.

572
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,130
Are you there?

573
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,590
Vardy!

574
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,070
Vardy, that'd be your face.

575
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,330
And I'm no longer alone.

576
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,930
Alex and Gordon have just arrived.

577
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,290
Hey, excuse you.

578
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,930
Oh, man, that's good news.

579
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,950
I almost gave you guys up for loss.

580
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,390
We're planning to set up a staging area for attack in the Citadel.

581
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,190
Gordon and Doc can head your way.

582
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,330
I want to get Dr. Kleiner somewhere safer.

583
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,370
Then I'll meet up with you.

584
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,310
I'll take all the help I can get.

585
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,450
Aw, crap.

586
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,250
Incoming!

587
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,090
Barney lives, right?

588
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,070
Okay, Gordon, you heard him.

589
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,450
I'll catch up with you as soon as I get Dr. Kleiner settled.

590
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,470
I thought you said you weren't going to leave me alone.

591
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:37,850
Oh, no.

592
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,130
Oh, not Lamar.

593
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,670
Go on, Gordon.

594
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,850
I'll take care of this.

595
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,650
Wait, but you said you wouldn't leave me alone anymore.

596
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,330
Gordon, take care of yourself out there.

597
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,010
Dr. Kleiner, there's really no time.

598
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:58,890
No, no.

599
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,270
She's around here someplace.

600
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:00,690
Okay, hold on.

601
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,350
We'll find you another pet head crab.

602
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,870
There are plenty to go around.

603
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,510
There's only one heady.

604
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,390
One heady.

605
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,470
Okay, take that.

606
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,230
Is she up here?

607
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,890
I kind of want to look for her too.

608
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,110
Ugh.

609
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,890
Dog, go with Gordon.

610
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,230
Dog is coming for you.

611
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,930
with me?

612
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,310
Oh, yeah, baby.

613
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,490
Okay, I'll take that.

614
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,470
Taking your supplies a little bit.

615
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:35,530
What's this?

616
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,510
Oh, Hula Lady?

617
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,030
I'll take that.

618
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,190
No!

619
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:40,850
Lamar!

620
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:43,890
Lamar!

621
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,250
Okay, I think dog is getting impatient a little bit, so...

622
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,150
We'll go.

623
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,230
Why?

624
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:55,730
Where are you?

625
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:56,930
Oh, wow.

626
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,550
Oh, nice.

627
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,470
Oh, sorry.

628
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,550
She didn't like my crowbar.

629
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,810
Oh, wow.

630
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,410
Rude.

631
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,690
I love you, dog.

632
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,210
Is there anything in here?

633
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,130
No, okay.

634
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,630
Not.

635
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,340
Okay.

636
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,620
Okay.

637
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:28,800
Okay.

638
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,000
I gotta start using this.

639
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,340
It's so easy to just press 3 and then like not even... Okay, I'm good.

640
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:35,660
All right.

641
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,260
To press 3 and not worry about the rest.

642
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,020
You're coming with me, right?

643
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Uh, oh, oh, sick moves.

644
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,690
All right, so we have an uprising now, right?

645
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,510
And we got milk.

646
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,510

650
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,070

651
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,920
What the heck is this?

652
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,140
A baby.

653
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,080
Oh!

654
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,760
What's that?

655
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,600
And then the briefcase!

656
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,120
G-man.

657
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,760
Wait, actually, I thought I was gonna go upstairs.

658
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,860
Why is it going here?

659
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,540
Wait, now I'm actually not sure.

660
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,200
In here?

661
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,540
Oh, here we go.

662
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,800
Bad timing to lose my power?

663
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,640
Did you see him?

664
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,480
Oh, okay.

665
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,740
This place looks familiar.

666
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,500
Where are they shooting from?

667
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,900
Are they shooting at me?

668
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,200
Well, those guys...

669
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,990
Are you friend?

670
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,010
You look like a friend.

671
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,230
Hey!

672
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,750
What's going on here?

673
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,690
Okay, friend.

674
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:47,950
We're fighting together.

675
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:48,590
I love this.

676
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,610
Gosh, we haven't been here in so long.

677
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,410
Alright, buddy.

678
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,990
I'm gonna keep you alive.

679
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,030
Excuse me.

680
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,290
Excuse me.

681
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,480
Oh, what are all of these?

682
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,290
What the heck is going on?

683
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:23,530
Oh.

684
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,030
Yeah, Terry!

685
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,030
Tear it down!

686
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,150
Tear it down!

687
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:29,670
Yeah!

688
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,300
Woohoo!

689
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,560
Gordon Freeman.

690
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,300
Higher.

691
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,720
Dr. Freeman?

692
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,140
We're coming with you.

693
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,660
With you here, Dr. Freeman, we can finally make some headway.

694
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,200
Follow Freeman as a achievement.

695
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,180
Send your squad to a location.

696
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,600
You got it.

697
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,840

Venceramos!

705
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,440
Okay, are they going to be saying that this whole time?

706
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,120
Oh, you're a friend?

707
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,060
Watch out for the hoppers!

708
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,960
They're everywhere!

709
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,280
I like that they're called hoppers.

710
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,320
Hey, you too!

711
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,760

Okay.

715
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,860
Wait, but what are these?

716
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,240
Use the grabby gun?

717
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
What does it do?

718
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,120
Oh, they're mines?

719
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,740

720
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,680
Oops.

721
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,860
How the hell do I get above there?

722
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,820
Oh, I think I gotta get rid of them, though, no?

723
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,440
Don't waste the hoppers, Dr. Freeman.

724
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,060
them against the combine oh but i need wait

725
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:05,680

726
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:19,280
oh uh what is that what is he doing uh maybe not the best spot wait what I'm so confused.

727
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,300
Maybe there.

728
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:21,820
No team.

729
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,280
Team.

730
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,660
Team, stay away from that guy.

731
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,120
Hit it.

732
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,240
All right, watch out, team.

733

Nobody hurt.

735
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,080
I'm a little confused.

736
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,620
Wait, so I just replanted like that.

737
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,280
And now it's Renly?

738
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,220
Eh?

739
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,320
Eh?

740
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,920
Green is good?

741
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,500
Oh, okay.

742
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,720
Okay, so that's a bad guy.

743
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,080
Ah, I see.

744
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,200
Okay, okay.

745
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,420
Okay, okay, okay.

746
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,180
Okay, sorry.

747
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,120
I had a bit of confusion.

748
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,880
We're fine now.

749
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,620
Wait.

750
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,710
We're not fine.

751
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,750
Everything's good.

752
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,660
Head grabs!

753
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,260
Oh!

754
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:36,100
Haha!

755
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,180
Haha!

756
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:40,980
I got one!

757
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,120
Haha!

758
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,720
What are you doing?

759
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,120
Are you gonna join us?

760
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,280
Nice.

761
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,640
Oh, you're switching weapons?

762
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,080
Okay.

763
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:50,820
Oh!

764
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,920
Wait, hold on.

765
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,960
I'm not done in here yet.

766
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,200
Okay.

767
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:05,580
Okay.

768
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,400
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

769
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:08,880
Uh...

770
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,580
Sorry, Doc.

771
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh!

772
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,450
Oh!

773
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,810
Hey, it's a good thing I changed the mister.

774
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,570
What's everybody shooting at?

775
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:28,810
Alright.

776
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,290
What is that?

777
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,310
Is he gone?

778
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:00,530
Oh,

779
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:13,400
nice.

780
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,200
Good to have team.

781
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,520
I was not paying attention.

782
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,980
I was looking at that thing over there and not at the tiny men that I don't care about anymore.

783
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,110
I'm just gonna switch back to my SMG for now.

784
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,770
Team, what the hell just happened?

785
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,870
Did we lose someone?

786
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,290
Did they get swapped out?

787
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,230
Were they gonna drop that though?

788
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,600
Like how he's just like, yeah, I'm shooting it.

789
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,500
Yes, that worked.

790
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,820
Like that!

791
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,320
Okay, I'm covering you.

792
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,880
Is this guy active?

793
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,260
Yes.

794
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,780
Oh, okay.

795
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,360
There's so much that I'm suddenly like...

796
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,760
There's so, so much everything has changed!

797
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,140
So much has... I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty all of a sudden.

798
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,500
Oh, I don't know that.

799
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,940
Wait, is that guy alive?

800
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,800
Are you alive?

801
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,480
Where am I going?

802
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,380
Here.

803
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,240
War has changed.

804
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,560
Okay.

805
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,160
I definitely pressed G.

806
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,400
And that's why I thought, um, you know...

807
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
See me!

808
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,280
Oh!

809
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,130
Was it me?

810
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,750
Did I do that?

811
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,090
Oh!

812
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:48,030
Oh!

813
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:50,050
You good?

814
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,040
I got him.

815
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,080
No, no, no.

816
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:05,680
Never fear.

817
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,740
Never fear.

818
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,840
I got him.

819
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,880
I don't know.

820
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,420
Will guys come out from here?

821
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,480
Do we need to go in there?

822
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:20,800
No.

823
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:21,500
Okay.

824
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,160
There's more in here too.

825
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,280
stick here.

826
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,920
You're fine.

827
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,560
Don't worry about it.

828
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,390
Hello.

829
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,510
I'm fine.

830
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:46,410
I don't need it.

831
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,750
I'm fine.

832
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:52,290
Nice throw.

833
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:53,270
Thank you.

834
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,450
Civil protection.

835
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,310
I feel like it's almost worse kind of having these guys.

836
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,270
Good job, you.

837
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,190
You did it.

838
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,130
Oh, my gosh.

839
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,990
These things will be the death of me, I swear.

840
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,830
I know they will be.

841
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,410
Wait, actually, where...

842
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,150
Oh, excuse me.

843
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,670
Where do we go?

844
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:01,230
In here?

845
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:02,850
No?

846
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,710
Let's check out in here.

847
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:05,170
Sorry, Freeman.

848
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:05,730
Sorry.

849
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,550
Excuse me.

850
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:11,930
I don't like the sounds.

851
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,430
Why are you doing in the corner?

852
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,570
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

853
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,450
You're fine.

854
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,090
Is there a door?

855
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,090
Ah, I see, I see.

856
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,310

857
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:31,570

Anything in the tub?

885
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,470

We really didn't need to come up here.

895
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,840
It was just for spooky scary.

896
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:11,640
Hmm.

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,680
What is that?

911
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,100
Oh, it's just a piece of something.

912
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:20,540

916
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,300
Who's moaning?

917
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,160
Which one of you is moaning behind me?

918
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,100

01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,340

920
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,040

922
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:44,800

01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,660
You're luckier than that guy.

928
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,040
We'll just let them do their thing.

929
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,570
Dr. Freeman, I'm coming with you.

930
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:15,450
Ah!

931
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:23,790
Yes!

932
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:24,690
I think it's Medkit.

933
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:26,410
I'm fine, I'm fine.

934
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,030
Wait, did we have- did you leave that guy to join us?

935
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,970
Oh, did he die?

936
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:34,910
No way!

937
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,370
Why is his body like that all of a sudden?

938
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:39,830
Okay, I'm sorry.

939
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:45,370
I'm getting... Okay, I want to go in there, but I want to look around here a little bit first before we do so.

940
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:47,210
I don't know if there was anything else.

941
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,590
In fact, maybe just keep the grab gun out.

942
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,010
Um, does it...

943
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,390
Oh, actually, it doesn't seem like...

944
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:52,590
Wait.

945
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,850
Yeah, I don't think we can jump over there, Camel.

946
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:56,250
Oh, wait.

947
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,210
We can go this way.

948
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:57,710
No?

949
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,070
Behind you!

950
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,400
Oh, just...

951
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:12,820
Okay.

952
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:13,520
Sorry.

953
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,180
Sorry.

954
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:15,580
So sorry.

955
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,180
Excuse me.

956
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,100
So so sorry.

957
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:18,780
I'm sorry.

958
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,050
It's pretty spooky in here.

959
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:32,050
I'm not gonna lie, team.

960
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:34,590
I'm a little afraid.

961
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,790
These look like coffins.

962
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,970
Did I kill a guy?

963
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,430
I think I killed a head crab and I didn't realize.

964
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,730
I heard this the faintest...

965
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,190
And let me get out of your way.

966
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:50,670
Yeah, but where is it?

967
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,090
I heard him though.

968
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,970
I heard a little...

969
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,950
Oh well.

970
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,110
Okay.

971
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:00,350
It was Lamar.

972
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,880
Let's go up.

973
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,850
I think they're in there.

974
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,220
Hitting the gut!

975
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,340
Oh no!

976
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,080
Can I use any of this?

977
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,240
Don't get...

978
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,360
...

979
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,520
Don't, don't get hit.

980
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,380
Excuse me, please.

981
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:52,860
Please.

982
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,280
Take my shoddy back out.

983
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,860
Wait, excuse me, please.

984
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,980
Okay, thank you.

985
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Is there one more guy?

986
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,710
Oh, I don't need that.

987
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,040
Where are they?

988
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,070
They're being freaks in the bathroom.

989
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,430
Don't forget to reload, Dr. Freeman.

990
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:26,690

Oh my god.

995
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,080
Are we the squad?

996
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,800
Is there anything else in here?

997
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:20,580
Okay, sorry.

Excuse me.

1001
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,520
Oh, no, excuse me.

1002
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,340
What's in here?

1003
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,420
It's such a...

1004
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,700
This is a PT bathroom.

1005
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:31,980
Oh!

1006
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,320
I got more arrows!

1007
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,080
That's awesome!

1008
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,240
Okay, for the crossbow.

1009
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,920
You missed the watermelons.

1010
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,260
They'll be fine.

1011
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,120
They look really refreshing, though, no?

1012
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,340
Hey, hey.

1013
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,440
Wait, is this thing going to attack us?

1014
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,580
Wait, who?

1015
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,060
Is this thing attacking us?

1016
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:00,500
I can't...

1017
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,100
I don't know.

1018
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:01,620
Yes?

1019
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:01,920
Okay.

1020
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,610
Did we lose some people?

1021
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:13,230
Feels like maybe we did.

1022
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:13,870
Oh no.

1023
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:14,370
Just kidding.

1024
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,110
They're still coming down.

1025
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,780
Oh, I got one.

1026
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:00,630
Okay.

1027
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:01,350
I think we're good.

1028
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,070
Music is so loud.

1029
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,930
These guys are...

1030
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,350
Oh, uh...

1031
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:38,860
Oh my goodness.

1032
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:39,860
Oh my goodness.

1033
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:02,640
Hey.

1034
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:03,740
Thank you.

1035
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,140
I have to wait until somebody comes out, I think.

1036
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,920
That's what I have to do.

1037
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,920
Stay

1038
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,340
low, Dr. Freeman.

1039
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,220
I...

1040
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,780
Okay, I'm not that low.

1041
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,100
I see the room over here.

1042
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,140
Oh my gosh.

1043
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,300
This way.

1044
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,320
Team.

1045
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,830
Team this way.

1046
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,050
Team.

1047
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:55,810
Holy.

1048
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,620
Uh.

1049
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,600
Uh, team.

1050
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:08,800
Team.

1051
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,120
In here.

1052
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,260
Yeah, team.

1053
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:11,840
In here.

1054
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,160
Are you coming or not?

1055
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,660
Okay.

1056
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:20,780
Oh my goodness.

1057
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:31,920
How did that go?

1058
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,440
Why was that guy even up there?

1059
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,000
It's like waiting for us for real.

1060
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,920
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.

1061
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,260
I think we're all still here.

1062
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,300
I think we're all good.

1063
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,400
Take this medk!

1064
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,990
Ooh, supply room.

1065
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:55,770
Let's go.

1066
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,490
Uh-oh, they gave us a lot of stuff.

1067
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,130
I wonder why.

1068
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,770
I wonder why.

1069
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:06,230
Okay.

1070
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:07,650
Let me get out of your way.

1071
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:08,690
Yeah, you should.

1072
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:09,290
Yeah.

1073
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,440
Okay, team.

1074
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,500
Here.

1075
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,780
You got it.

1076
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,220
Actually, down there.

1077
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:20,960
Sure thing, Gordon.

1078
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,700
Oh, you go first.

1079
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:23,900
You go first.

1080
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,000
Let's go.

1081
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,140
You go first.

1082
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,520
Ladies first.

1083
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,230
Sorry, Doctor.

1084
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,190
Where's the rest of...

1085
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:42,490
Oh, we could have used this door the whole time?

1086
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:47,130
We could have used this door the whole time?

1087
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:05,960
Okay.

1088
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:11,390
Come on.

1089
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,130
Here goes nothing.

1090
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,210
Let's go.

1091
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,790
I want to take all their stuff, though.

1092
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:19,510
Hey, everybody.

1093
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,150
Follow Freeman.

1094
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:21,090
Oh, yep.

1095
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,030
Follow Freeman.

1096
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:30,960
Oh, my God.

1097
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,980
I guess we...

1098
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,520
From here we...

1099
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,320
From here?

1100
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:39,420
From here?

1101
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,060
The way to go is...

1102
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,040
Oh,

1103
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:47,940
I see that.

1104
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:48,380
I see that.

1105
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:49,140
I see that.

1106
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,270
This way, this way.

1107
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:55,630
Oh.

1108
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,210
Alright, team!

1109
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,010
Close the gate.

1110
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,550
Oh.

1111
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,210
Will they keep coming in?

1112
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:16,390
Maybe.

1113
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,530
Whoops.

1114
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,550
No, okay.

1115
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,770
It's probably fine.

1116
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:30,650
I...

1117
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:32,330
I...

1118
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:35,330
I missed so many of those.

1119
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:44,690
Oh!

1120
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:46,750
Fool.

1121
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:48,310
Noise.

1122
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,090
Excuse me.

1123
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:49,990
Excuse me.

1124
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:50,710
Excuse me.

1125
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,410
Excuse me.

1126
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,150
Goodness gracious.

1127
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:53,890
Oh my goodness.

1128
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:54,770
You know what?

1129
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,510
I was also gonna look in this room.

1130
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:58,390
Okay.

1131
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,970
Just barely enough.

1132
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:02,550
Sorry, Freeman.

1133
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:03,910
You're fine.

1134
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:07,850
Everybody's fine here, except that guy.

1135
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,090
Ripperoni.

1136
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,830
We go up or down?

1137
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:13,750
Let's go up first.

1138
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:15,750
Don't go up?

1139
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,290
Don't go up?

1140
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,550
Let's check down.

1141
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,990
I got jump scared.

1142
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:41,250
I should have expected it.

1143
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,760
Did you guys see that?

1144
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,560
Did you guys see how bad I got?

1145
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,240
Oh, I did not mean to save.

1146
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:03,920
But that's fine.

1147
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,820
It's fine, actually.

1148
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,420
Holy moly.

1149
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,360
They got me good.

1150
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,860
They really got me good.

1151
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,780
Before we go this way, I do actually want to check upstairs.

1152
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,220
I think there's something good.

1153
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:21,900
I just gotta...

1154
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,780
Wait, did I put it back up right?

1155
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:27,300
Oh.

1156
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:36,780
No way!

1157
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,780
Okay, it was a trap.

1158
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:41,560
Sorry, Doc.

1159
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:42,720
They're fine.

1160
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,400
That was a trap.

1161
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,440
Okay, I'm stuck.

1162
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:48,760
I'm actually stuck.

1163
01:14:49,820 --> 01:15:08,520

1164
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:27,110

1165
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,830
I'm almost out of bullets on this thing.

1166
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,180
Everyone, we're fine?

1167
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,580
I think I hear another.

1168
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:52,180
Or I can't tell their footsteps and my team's footsteps anymore.

1169
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,080
Oh, nice.

1170
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,160
Excuse me.

1171
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,880
I have tried the alt fire for this one.

1172
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:03,860
Yes, it is.

1173
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,920
The ball.

1174
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,700
I think I don't know how to use it very...

1175
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,800
Here comes...

1176
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:10,960
Oh!

1177
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,020
Oh wait.

1178
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,910
Sorry.

1179
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:26,330
I was trying to get it.

1180
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,030
Where did it go?

1181
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,530
I hear it.

1182
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,290
I'll grab it.

1183
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:35,390
Oh, good job?

1184
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:36,110
Wait.

1185
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:39,700
Sorry.

1186
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,440
Sorry.

1187
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,060
We're fine.

1188
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,420
...

1189
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,820
Oh my gosh, I don't have... I'm not that low!

1190
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,460
I thought that was a bone.

1191
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,500
Just peeled clean.

1192
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,220
One of them died.

1193
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,240
One of my guys died?

1194
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,860
Oh, was it my fault?

1195
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:14,540
Oh, he looks peaceful.

1196
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,120
He looks peaceful.

1197
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,020
Let me get out of your way.

1198
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,940
Honestly, surprise, it took this long.

1199
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,000
We'll get more guys, though, right?

1200
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,180
Team.

1201
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,420
Wait, did they not trust me anymore?

1202
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,640
I'm pressing C.

1203
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,560
Did they not want to hang out with me anymore?

1204
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,920
Yeah, team, come on.

1205
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,860
Wait, why am I only down to two?

1206
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,900
What happened to the...

1207
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,760
Wait, did I lose two guys?

1208
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,760
I thought I just lost one.

1209
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:03,760
Lay it on, Freeman.

1210
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:04,610
Uh-uh.

1211
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,360
He ran?

1212
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,020
Sorry, Doc.

1213
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,620
He left?

1214
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,640
Sometimes they get lost.

1215
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,400
Oh, there he is.

1216
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,220
Come on.

1217
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,200
Let's get moving.

1218
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,120
Yeah, what were you doing?

1219
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,860
Come on.

1220
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:30,780
Take this med kit.

1221
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,420
Take this med kit.

1222
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,780
Everybody take a med kit.

1223
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,960
That was weird.

1224
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:40,900
Okay.

1225
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:50,350
That's a turret.

1226
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:55,600
A couple turrets.

1227
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,360
Oh, here.

1228
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,640
I think there might be head crab people in there.

1229
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,720
Okay, you guys stay here.

1230
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,480
Like, stay over there, actually.

1231
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:08,580
Whatever you say.

1232
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:08,940
Yeah.

1233
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,260
Yeah.

1234
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,480
Okay.

1235
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:18,650
No, no.

1236
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:21,070
No, you stay there.

1237
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:21,770
Whatever you say.

1238
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:22,790
Yeah.

1239
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,280
All clear.

1240
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:39,940
All clear.

1241
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,100
Nice glasses.

1242
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,000
Nope, follow me.

1243
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,680
But...

1244
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:49,940
Okay.

1245
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,730
Oh, no.

1246
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,370
Yeah, I...

1247
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:00,320
Okay, there might be spookies in here.

1248
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,810
See him?

1249
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,350
might be spookies in here, so be careful.

1250
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,010
I'm scared.

1251
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,130
Okay, I knew it.

1252
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:21,250
Oh!

1253
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:29,190
Let's go this way first.

1254
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,330
Wait, wait.

1255
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:33,950
Let's turn around.

1256
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:34,550
I'm scared.

1257
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,110
Turn around, turn around.

1258
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:40,890
Team, that was way too scary.

1259
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:42,610
I'm gonna stay and hold down this way.

1260
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:44,010
Wait, we lost somebody again.

1261
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:45,490
Who did we lose?

1262
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:47,750
Is she in there?

1263
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,510
Oh, no, wait, I can't get back up.

1264
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:50,350
No!

1265
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:53,630
Wait!

1266
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:55,550
No, I lost.

1267
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,030
Did she get...

1268
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,950
Did she get lost?

1269
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,610
I lost to the load screen.

1270
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:04,310
No!

1271
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,730
That's so unfair!

1272
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:09,610
Wait, if I reload...

1273
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,090
Nope.

1274
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:12,410
Dang.

1275
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,900
Oh, that sucks.

1276
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:19,720
Wait, so what's up here?

1277
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,780
If anything.

1278
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,320
Just...

1279
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,480
Just, uh...

1280
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:43,970
just the symbol and some supplies

1281
01:21:49,980 --> 01:22:02,340
sorry I can't believe we lost somebody I hate using the grab gun on these because I can never tell if I get the stuff or not okay I guess I didn't need it ah

1282
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:16,980
excuse me I'm so bummed about her getting eaten by the load screen I'm not gonna lie I'm really bummed about that.

1283
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,260
That's so scary looking.

1284
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,540
Look how freaky this is.

1285
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,500
Oh.

1286
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,780
What?

1287
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,480
Why is it my...

1288
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,680
I tried to...

1289
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:42,860
Screenshot.

1290
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:43,340
Didn't work.

1291
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,500
Oh well.

1292
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,740
Oh, she's back!

1293
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,400
Oh my gosh!

1294
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,900
Oh my gosh, she's back!

1295
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,600
We didn't lose her!

1296
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,500
Thank you so much for the tangente, thank you.

1297
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,660
Oh, she's back.

1298
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:03,480
Yay!

1299
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,890
I could kill one guy on accident, but, you know, she was a...

1300
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,660
If she died too bugged, that's even worse.

1301
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,480
Uh-oh.

1302
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,240
Oh.

1303
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,100
Hey, it's Freeman.

1304
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,600
You're not leaving without me.

1305
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,600
He's back!

1306
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:25,850
It's like we never even lost him.

1307
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,770
Oh, this place.

1308
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,490
Are there gonna be a bunch of zombies in here?

1309
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:34,990
Oh.

1310
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:40,210
Come here.

1311
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:41,080
Come here.

1312
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:42,110
Oh.

1313
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:42,750
Oh.

1314
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,590
Oh.

1315
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:45,730
Come

1316
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:53,580
on.

1317
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,640
Trying to grab them.

1318
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:15,630
Trying to hit them against each other, but I'm not aiming very well.

1319
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:19,810
Come here.

1320
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:20,990
Oh.

1321
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,430
Good job, Tim.

1322
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:26,610
Mmm, soup.

1323
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,250
Mmm, soup.

1324
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:29,390
Mmm, soup.

1325
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,870
Mmm, soup.

1326
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,430
Mmm, soup.

1327
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:35,770
Good job, Tim.

1328
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,970
I did say it right.

1329
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,950
Hackers.

1330
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,430
Oh, gosh, there's so many of them.

1331
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,730
Ah, I'm trying to help, Tim.

1332
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:52,610
I promise.

1333
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:54,890
I'm

1334
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,200
trying to help team, I promise.

1335
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:15,960
I'm doing

1336
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,190
my...

1337
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,890
Everybody alive?

1338
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:31,950
Yeah.

1339
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,130
Good job, team.

1340
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:35,930
Okay.

1341
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,870
Onwards.

1342
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:40,290
Forward.

1343
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,530
No zombies, right?

1344
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,280
I think I need to go to the other side.

1345
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,740
I think I saw it, yeah.

1346
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,240
Oh.

1347
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,440
Thank you.

1348
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,700
Let's even the odds a little.

1349
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:03,420
Yeah!

1350
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,260
Let's go, baby.

1351
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,400
Let's go.

1352
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,140
Sorry, Freeman.

1353
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,340
Oh, you're good.

1354
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,920
Let's even the odds a little.

1355
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:13,620
I agree.

1356
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,160
I agree.

1357
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:16,900
Let's swoop.

1358
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,260
Let's swoop.

1359
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,980
Oh, actually, do I go through here?

1360
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:22,880
Oh, not yet.

1361
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:23,560
Sorry.

1362
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,700
No, you're fine.

1363
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,580
They're so polite.

1364
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:32,700
Oh, I go around here.

1365
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,520
Oh, how the hell?

1366
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:39,920
Where did you come from?

1367
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,600
How'd you do that?

1368
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,260
Up and over?

1369
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,660
How'd you do that?

1370
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,600
Uh-oh, wait.

1371
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,920
I love following the free bit.

1372
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,700
I'll follow you.

1373
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,840
You know where you're going, right?

1374
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:56,440
Yes!

1375
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,980
Do I need to go out?

1376
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,460
I know where I'm going.

1377
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,700
Oh, yes, I do.

1378
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,840
Why do I have a feeling I'm going to get ambushed all by myself?

1379
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,300
I'm going to be the only one on this side.

1380
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:23,540
Oh, wait.

1381
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:25,980
Actually, team...

1382
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,240
Oh, I think I'm stupid.

1383
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,740
I think I fall right here.

1384
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:30,820
Okay.

1385
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:31,600
Okay.

1386
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,180
Over the gate!

1387
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:35,930
There you go.

1388
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,300
Irish

1389
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:47,930
Rist Watch.

1390
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:48,750
Welcome to membership.

1391
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,810
Thank you!

1392
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:54,390
Over the gate!

1393
01:27:55,850 --> 01:28:01,430
This game suddenly feels like multiplayer with you guys, you know?

1394
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,750
That's a must!

1395
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,440
I'm covering.

1396
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,760
I'm covering.

1397
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:27,240
I'm covering.

1398
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:37,200
Oh, no!

1399
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:39,760
I got you.

1400
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:40,400
Don't worry.

1401
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,280
I covered you.

1402
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,340
Oh, no.

1403
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,700
I can't see anything.

1404
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:51,740
Oh, golly.

1405
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,440
Oh, golly.

1406
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,140
Golly.

1407
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,670
Why did I...

1408
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:02,450
I'm sorry.

1409
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:07,720
Why did you die?

1410
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,740
Wait, I could prevent his death.

1411
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:12,420
I could prevent his death.

1412
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,480
I thought these would explode.

1413
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:18,820
But they didn't at all.

1414
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,480
Oh, now they do.

1415
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,260
Now they do.

1416
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:25,780
Now they choose to explode.

1417
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,700
Is there anybody even over there?

1418
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,980
I can't tell at all.

1419
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:34,780
Ah!

1420
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:35,640
Sorry.

1421
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,020
I'm so mad at myself.

1422
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:38,580
I did not.

1423
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,820
I meant to press.

1424
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,920
I meant to press.

1425
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,320
And my finger slipped.

1426
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:47,980
Damn it.

1427
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:48,640
Darn it.

1428
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:49,340
Ah!

1429
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:52,680
Oh well.

1430
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,060
Okay.

1431
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,040
There we go.

1432
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:54,860
There we go.

1433
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,120
We have two left.

1434
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,560
We lost another.

1435
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:02,660
Where are they?

1436
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:03,020
Okay.

1437
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:11,580
Will that work?

1438
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:13,480
No.

1439
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,560
Blame.

1440
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,770
That's some pretty serious music happening.

1441
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:27,830
All of a sudden.

1442
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:29,790
Wait, why?

1443
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:30,510
Why?

1444
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,290
Why?

1445
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:33,410
What happened?

1446
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:36,090
How did we lose another guy?

1447
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,060
Wait, what's that?

1448
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:40,460
Where is my guy?

1449
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,060
Where's my last guy?

1450
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,020
It's all me, I think.

1451
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,420
I couldn't see anything.

1452
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,160
I didn't know what they were shooting with.

1453
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,440
They were just...

1454
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,820
Tiny little men!

1455
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,680
Oh well.

1456
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,760
I couldn't tell they were shooting with these guys.

1457
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,460
I'm gonna plant some charges and blow this open.

1458
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:30,980
Okay!

1459
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,780
Where's my other guy then?

1460
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,540
Okay, I have a feeling I'm gonna need this.

1461
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:37,280
Oh!

1462
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,400
Stand back!

1463
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:46,660
Thank you!

1464
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,400
It's like that dinosaur game.

1465
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,120
I'm here.

1466
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,200
Where are you?

1467
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,080
Oh, hello.

1468
01:32:58,920 --> 01:32:59,880
We've lost someone.

1469
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,200
I don't know where they are.

1470
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,520
I think I gotta go.

1471
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:04,840
No, you're fine.

1472
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,160
I think I gotta go back.

1473
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,480
I think I have to go back and find my guy.

1474
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:16,320
One for me and one for Mimi.

1475
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,920
He's back at the start.

1476
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,160
I don't think we're gonna get ambushed anymore.

1477
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,760
So let me go check this room again.

1478
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,450
I guess.

1479
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,760
Where the heck?

1480
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,060
They're expendable.

1481
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,480
No, they're my team.

1482
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:48,020
Oh.

1483
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:49,280
Hello.

1484
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,180
Sure thing, Gordon.

1485
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:53,340
Stay away from the fire.

1486
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,000
I'm going to stay and hold down this spot.

1487
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:58,380
You're going to come in, right?

1488
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:58,940
Oops.

1489
01:33:59,360 --> 01:33:59,720
Whoops.

1490
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,140
I think she's stupid.

1491
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,000
Maybe we don't need her.

1492
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,360
No, no.

1493
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,080
Don't go backwards.

1494
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:07,800
Go forwards.

1495
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:11,360
Here we go.

1496
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:12,880
No, don't go that far forwards.

1497
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:13,300
Go in here.

1498
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,090
Okay, we got her.

1499
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,140
Okay.

1500
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,180
Alright.

1501
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,020
She might be stupid, but she's my stupid.

1502
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,060
The luckiest stuck NPC.

1503
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,360
What do you mean by that?

1504
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,400
Like us.

1505
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,020
Yeah, lucky for her, I like stupid, so...

1506
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,040
They go in here.

1507
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,580
That door's locked from the other side, Dr. Freeman.

1508
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,240
Maybe you can find a way around.

1509
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,160
Okay.

1510
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,840
We'll go through here.

1511
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,040
Looks nasty in there.

1512
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,560
Good thing you've got that suit.

1513
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,020
Oh, you guys can't crawl?

1514
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,540
Oh, I have to go find a way around for you all?

1515
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:12,370
What's that sound?

1516
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,670
I don't like that at all.

1517
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:19,980
It's like radiation.

1518
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,100
Oh!

1519
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:23,240
It absolutely is radiation.

1520
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,360
It's not like radiation.

1521
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:26,900
It is!

1522
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:36,830
Yeah, they're not coming, are they?

1523
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:39,950
Wait, I just went through all that effort to save her.

1524
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:42,950
To save her ass.

1525
01:35:53,610 --> 01:36:01,470
okay what's the best is this sinking oh my gosh oh my gosh

1526
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:11,560

1527
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:22,700
okay oh golly guys this is

1528
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,000
There's much...

1529
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,220
Wait, I need this thing, too.

1530
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,180
What am I thinking?

1531
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:45,820
No, sideways.

1532
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,520
I need you sideways.

1533
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,480
Wait, no, I need you sideways.

1534
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:50,880
Oh,

1535
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:01,970
I wish I could rotate.

1536
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,150
Wait, maybe if I...

1537
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:05,950
No!

1538
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:07,110
Don't leave me?

1539
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,530
Don't leave.

1540
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:09,310
Ah!

1541
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:15,700
Alright, nice.

1542
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:17,900
My mind.

to know, these guys are just chilling in here.

1547
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:19,590
I almost jumped on that.

1548
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,870
I thought it was fine for a second.

1549
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:22,610
Oh, gosh.

1550
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:26,070
Um.

1551
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:34,410
Okay.

1552
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,380
I hear a lot of growling, I think.

1553
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:05,670
Oh.

1554
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:06,250
No.

1555
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,440
Stop!

1556
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,180
Gravity

1557
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,370
gun works on headcraft.

1558
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:54,750

01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:32,110

1561
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,740
Mint on a rampage

1562
01:40:51,480 --> 01:41:04,840
Yeah I'm a highly trained professional I could have used this too I saw it and was just like if I start That's me on the right I was like If I start getting ambushed, I'll use that.

1563
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,360
And guess what I didn't do?

1564
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:07,860
Oh!

1565
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:08,340
Oh!

1566
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:36,440
I'm gonna switch to my shotgun, I think, and then I'll...

1567
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,830
I'm going to attempt...

1568
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:52,330
Oh my gosh.

1569
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:52,690
No.

1570
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,950
I tried to jump.

1571
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:55,590
Oh my god, no!

1572
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:56,090
I jumped!

1573
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:56,410
I jumped!

1574
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:07,480
That's okay.

1575
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,320
I'm more prepared this time.

1576
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:11,700
Maybe.

1577
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:17,680
Oops.

1578
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:22,740
Try another.

1579
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:27,920
Oh, I see the head crab literally walking.

1580
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,080
Oops.

1581
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:34,380
Well, um...

1582
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:36,500
Okay, let's once again switch to my shotgun.

1583
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:36,960
There we go.

1584
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:52,740
How prepared, though.

1585
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,100
I don't think I'm very prepared.

1586
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,720
I'm not good at...

1587
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:00,960
I don't know why I'm...

1588
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,040
Not good at jumping!

1589
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:02,680
and running!

1590
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,100
Oh, no, no, no!

1591
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,180
Oh, just kill me.

1592
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,000
I'll redo it.

1593
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:09,780
Why?

1594
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:10,560
Why?

1595
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,160
Okay.

1596
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,120
That's fine.

1597
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,680
Oh, I got it stuck on the wall.

1598
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:20,160
Perfect.

1599
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:20,560
Perfect.

1600
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:21,100
Okay.

1601
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:31,880
Just run instead?

1602
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:43,230
Okay, I'll try just running.

1603
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:43,970
Oh.

1604
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:45,070
Okay.

1605
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:50,590
Okay, just running.

1606
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:53,830
Okay.

1607
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:00,290
Just running.

1608
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:10,630
Oh, shoot!

1609
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:11,050
Ow!

1610
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:13,690
Ouch.

1611
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:15,610
I didn't, um, oops.

1612
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:19,510
You shouldn't have done that.

1613
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:21,010
You shouldn't have done that.

1614
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:22,170
Why did I do that?

1615
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:25,090
We're fine.

1616
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:27,350
Everything's fine.

1617
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:28,370
Don't worry about it.

1618
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:50,030
Well, we're in much better shape than before.

1619
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:58,530
We're in much better shape than last time, so...

1620
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:00,330
I'll take it.

1621
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:06,990
even though I miss we mess up but we still take our win

1622
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:21,060
I was able to slice and dice one guy that was really cool I liked that

1623
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:32,360
I did quick save right I'll just do it again

1624
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,380
no no

1625
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:44,540
we save scumming

1626
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,540
okay I

1627
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:01,610
can't tell if he's got a head or not.

1628
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:03,750
No head.

1629
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:18,890
Oh, I hear him.

1630
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:20,010
Oh, I hear them.

1631
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,540
Come on.

1632
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:29,900
Come on.

1633
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:31,760
A little closer.

1634
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:38,690
I want her to get a little closer.

1635
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:41,190
Okay.

1636
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:43,610
I want to get over there.

1637
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:46,310
I hate this goop.

1638
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:47,050
I hate this.

1639
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,010
I hate this part.

1640
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:54,570
Look how cool it looks, though, with him behind the headlights.

1641
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:56,070
It looks really good.

1642
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:57,830
He's a little shy.

1643
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:59,210
Yeah, he's not coming over.

1644
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:04,910
Come here.

1645
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:08,590
What are you doing all the way back there?

1646
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:12,970
He's having a little bit of trouble, a wee bit.

1647
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,040
We'll ignore him for now.

1648
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,100
Oh, no.

1649
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,060
Oh, no, no, no!

1650
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:31,720
Um, okay, I think I need to reload.

1651
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,120
Okay.

1652
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:35,920
Ah!

1653
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:37,140
He's

1654
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,080
on his way now!

1655
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:55,110
I don't have much shotgun ammo left.

1656
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:01,430
Okay.

1657
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,930
All right, good stuff.

1658
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:09,070
Okay.

1659
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:14,710
Okay, all right.

1660
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:21,390
One moment, please.

1661
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:36,370
Okay, I'm assuming...

1662
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:39,410
Actually, I don't...

1663
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:42,290
I'm trying to see if I can figure out...

1664
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:47,790
I guess just over there is where I need to go.

1665
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:56,230
Can you do the move?

1666
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,710
I hate this!

1667
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:26,070
Oh my gosh.

1668
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:30,690
One step forward, five steps back.

1669
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:34,090
Nearly, nearly there.

1670
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:36,710
Oh, really?

1671
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:52,590
Oh, this is still water.

1672
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:56,530
Okay, hold on.

1673
01:49:56,730 --> 01:49:59,370
Now that I know that, I couldn't see.

1674
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,490
I thought it was land.

1675
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:04,370
That was my bad.

1676
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:09,410
Don't do that.

1677
01:50:09,650 --> 01:50:10,030
Don't do that.

1678
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:10,910
Don't be like that.

1679
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:11,830
Come on, baby girl.

1680
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:12,650
Don't be like that.

1681
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:13,710
Okay, there we go.

1682
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:15,470
Honestly, save.

1683
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:16,070
Right!

1684
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:19,110
I see it now.

1685
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:21,690
I see it now extremely clearly.

1686
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:27,260
Okay.

1687
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,000
I made it to the other side.

1688
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,840
And, um...

1689
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,240
Uh...

1690
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:39,800
Do I go up?

1691
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,020
Do I go up?

1692
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:51,680
Now what?

1693
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:52,760
Right.

1694
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:19,310
Bad timing.

1695
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,990
Let's check out the other area too.

1696
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:26,910
We don't need to go immediately into the first hole we see, no?

1697
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:32,370
I'm cautious of head crabs.

1698
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:38,850
Okay.

1699
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:39,690
So delicate.

1700
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,300
All right.

1701
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,740
I think we should pick the last one.

1702
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,120
Does it even matter?

1703
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:54,380
Get my gun ready.

1704
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:08,800
Oh.

1705
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:12,220
Get through the toxic tunnel under city 17.

1706
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:12,880
Okay.

1707
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:14,980
I did that.

1708
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:20,880
And now we go open up for our friends.

1709
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:22,840
Okay.

1710
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:50,840

It's just the two of you!

1713
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,960
Everybody, they say!

1714
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:06,500
Everybody, they say!

1715
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:12,320
Wait, this is not a real door?

1716
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,840
Oh, um...

1717
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:15,500
Sorry.

1718
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:18,000
Me too, I'm lost.

1719
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:18,840
Wait, huh?

1720
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,400
Wait, what?

1721
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,020
Was there another door?

1722
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,040
Just the two of us.

1723
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,340
We can make it.

1724
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:28,640
Ah!

1725
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,300
My bad.

1726
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:38,220
Okay, squad.

1727
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,760
Surely we'll get another guy.

1728
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:41,980
Like, now.

1729
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,240
Uh, actually, what do I want to use for these guys?

1730
01:53:58,860 --> 01:53:59,780
I'm just going to use the grab.

1731
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:19,600
We're fine.

1732
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:22,280
I didn't want to waste ammo on them, you know?

1733
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:24,400
They kind of suck.

1734
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:34,820
No stragglers?

1735
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:37,920
They were fast, yeah.

1736
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:38,780
Holy moly.

1737
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,920
Okay, um...

1738
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,020
Let's have this gun ready.

1739
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:45,140
Whoops.

1740
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,280
Oh!

1741
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,160
Friend!

1742
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:49,200
Dr. Freeman?

1743
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:49,880
Yes!

1744
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:51,340
You were looking for a place to hold up.

1745
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,580
It's not safe here anymore.

1746
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,460
They're shelling the hell out of us.

1747
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:55,600
Keep moving, Dr. Freeman.

1748
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,980
I'll send word you're coming and see you up ahead.

1749
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,120
Okay, don't die!

1750
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:05,210
I'm still moving.

1751
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:07,130
Wait, uh...

1752
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:07,930
I'm still moving.

1753
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:16,290
Yeah.

1754
01:55:16,290 --> 01:55:17,290
I'm ready.

1755
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,720
Nice shot, thank you.

1756
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:52,180
Did it.

1757
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:08,640
My last bullet took him out.

1758
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:11,620
That person was on fire, yeah.

1759
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,700
Maybe I could have saved them if I was faster.

1760
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:15,700
Sucks.

1761
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:22,440
I'm also back to being low on health.

1762
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:23,500
Oh no!

1763
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,100
I am.

1764
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:38,160
I pressed it literally before you said anything.

1765
01:56:41,830 --> 01:56:42,630
What's in here?

1766
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,070
Oh, okay, that's where we need to go.

1767
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:48,070
But those are our friends.

1768
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:49,970
Oh my god.

1769
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:52,750
Are they our friends?

1770
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:53,790
Actually, I can't tell.

1771
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:55,110
Are you our friends?

1772
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:56,770
They are not friends.

1773
01:56:57,550 --> 01:56:58,050
They're not friends.

1774
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,470
And don't look at them.

1775
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,890
Don't look at them.

1776
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:03,490
Oh, look at them.

1777
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:04,770
Oh, thank you.

1778
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:21,230
Or not.

1779
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:24,070
not but I

1780
01:57:28,510 --> 01:57:53,470

1781
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:57,510
Everything good?

1782
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:02,970
Oh, you got watermelon in here though.

1783
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:04,330
What are you complaining about?

1784
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,780
I love the tub gun.

1785
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:14,180
I'm

1786
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:21,950
leading.

1787
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:22,530
I'm leading.

1788
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:29,050
Are you gonna follow?

1789
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:37,390
It's Freeman!

1790
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:38,330
Follow me!

1791
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:39,290
Yeah, yeah!

1792
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:49,010
Casually walked in front of me.

1793
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,750
It's so normal.

1794
01:58:57,210 --> 01:59:00,030
There we

1795
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,020
go.

1796
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:07,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

1797
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,120
Sorry, sorry.

1798
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:11,900
I tried.

1799
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:13,180
Whoa.

1800
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:19,010
Goodness.

1801
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:23,010
Where are you?

1802
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:27,150
Where are you?

1803
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:28,970
I don't want to go in there.

1804
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:32,310

1805
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:42,110

1806
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:54,380

1807
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:05,820
ah okay come across i think i think they killed me but the

1808
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:11,440
I think they killed me with the drawbridge!

1809
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,340
I think that's how I died!

1810
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:34,990
Excuse me.

1811
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:36,030
Excuse me.

1812
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:50,960
Ignore, ignore?

1813
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:54,080
This place is crazy looking now.

1814
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:56,960
Actually, where... where am I?

1815
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,000
Oh, here we go.

1816
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,020
Uh-oh.

1817
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:01,800
Head crabs?

1818
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:02,620
About?

1819
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:06,620
Should they drop the drawbridge, I'll be for real.

1820
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:09,660
Let's switch to this.

1821
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:28,050
Oh my gosh.

1822
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:29,090
Oh

1823
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:34,830
my gosh!

1824
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:38,170
Take this medkit.

1825
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:39,710
Fakes!

1826
02:01:41,110 --> 02:01:41,670
Holy!

1827
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:45,150
Not quite as funny as if Alex had landed on your head.

1828
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:47,110
Still a big dead boss.

1829
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:50,730
Imagine being the resistant soldier who killed Freeman by dropping a bridge.

1830
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:53,470
Gosh!

1831
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:54,970
Oh.

1832
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:58,750
The game sometimes rewards you.

1833
02:01:59,790 --> 02:02:01,590
For being a little adventurous.

1834
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:15,920
Is he dead?

1835
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:21,560
Wait, should I even be going down there?

1836
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:22,140
Oh, he's dead.

1837
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:22,700
Okay, good.

1838
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:31,970
Oh, my goodness.

1839
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:34,450
Yeah, we just noped him right out of there.

1840
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:37,090
I feel like my reflexes are...

1841
02:02:38,290 --> 02:03:04,610
questionable but sometimes they're pretty good watch out for the fire don't touch it oh don't touch the fire everybody zombies are they down there uh oh we did get uh some more shotgun ammo which is good good

1842
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:10,260
Zombies!

1843
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:11,960
Not plural.

1844
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:15,080
We're good?

1845
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:16,420
We're good, maybe?

1846
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:24,440
The zombies!

1847
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:30,500
Oh, okay.

1848
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:31,800
That is- Sorry, Doc.

1849
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:32,440
You're fine.

1850
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:33,920
Where's our other team?

1851
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,420
We are missing one person.

1852
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:40,600
Oh, come on again!

1853
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,940
It's fine, I suppose.

1854
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:50,660
Never forget, oh, reliable.

1855
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:11,090
Probar, my beloved.

1856
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:13,170
Wait, hold on.

1857
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:13,890
Let me reload.

1858
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:15,950
I don't want to get ambushed.

1859
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:22,380
What is going on out there?

1860
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,820
What is going on out there?

1861
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:31,680
Okay, uh, switch to this.

1862
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:33,400
So this is here.

1863
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,140
This is back a circle.

1864
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:45,960
You assholes!

1865
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:47,820
You're trying to kill me!

1866
02:04:55,850 --> 02:04:57,890
The zone claims another.

1867
02:04:58,790 --> 02:05:01,250
Okay, I'm guessing that they're probably, they respawn.

1868
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:02,710
They're like unlimited here.

1869
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:05,950
So I'm gonna save and we're gonna run for it.

1870
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:36,260
Oh my gosh, I don't actually really know where to go now.

1871
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:39,180
Everyone's fighting everyone now.

1872
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:40,140
It's crazy!

1873
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,940
It's getting crazy in here!

1874
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:44,500
Oh!

1875
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:45,360
Be careful.

1876
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:47,300
Dr. Freeman, I'm coming with you!

1877
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:47,980
Oh, okay!

1878
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:48,940
Awesome!

1879
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:50,500
Look at this!

1880
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,760
Oh my gosh.

1881
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:57,360
Ah!

1882
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,160
He wasn't fast enough, dang it!

1883
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,940
That was my fault.

1884
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,280
I tried to grab it.

1885
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:07,860
Ah!

1886
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,440
Where did I last load?

1887
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:17,160
I think okay hold on I'm gonna reload I'm gonna reload because we were right here

1888
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,340
I remember there's head crabs in here

1889
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:50,400
and there's head crabs somewhere there okay with our future knowledge we have we have done a better job with our foresight

1890
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:55,670
Ouch!

1891
02:06:57,170 --> 02:06:57,230
Ouch!

1892
02:06:57,490 --> 02:06:57,490
Ouch!

1893
02:06:57,490 --> 02:06:57,930
Go, go!

1894
02:06:59,130 --> 02:06:59,530
Okay.

1895
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:01,530
Dr. Freeman, I'm coming with you!

1896
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,730
Oh, it's a lady this time!

1897
02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:04,650
Oh, the reload was so worth it.

1898
02:07:05,690 --> 02:07:07,870
Um, don't, don't, don't just, don't just hit, take that.

1899
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:08,150
Okay.

1900
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:09,150
Let me get out of here.

1901
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:11,590
Maybe he'll throw one.

1902
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:12,150
No?

1903
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,900
I don't even know if I'm hitting it.

1904
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:34,840
Oh, nice.

1905
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:35,560
Someone got him.

1906
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:37,420
Okay.

1907
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:43,040
Don't forget to reload, Dr. Freeman.

1908
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:43,460
Oh!

1909
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:44,960
I'm almost out.

1910
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:47,180
Oh, actually, I probably should.

1911
02:07:48,860 --> 02:07:50,780
We'll switch to the SMG old...

1912
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:52,060
A second old reliable.

1913
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:52,760
Okay.

1914
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:53,640
Alright.

1915
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:54,880
Where do we go?

1916
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:55,540
This?

1917
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:57,560
Aha!

1918
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:18,760
Oh, they're below two?

1919
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:25,980
We didn't lose a guy, did we?

1920
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:28,860
I think we have to go down anyway.

1921
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:41,740
Okay.

1922
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:42,620
Good job, team.

1923
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:52,940
Good job team?

1924
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,060
Somehow we lost someone.

1925
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:56,820
I don't know how.

1926
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:57,480
That's fine.

1927
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,260
Good job, Mito.

1928
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,460
Thank you!

1929
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,040
Actually, if they're this close...

1930
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:06,140
Oh!

1931
02:09:13,070 --> 02:09:13,850
Before he could...

1932
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:15,590
Before he could...

1933
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:16,630
Throw the grenade.

1934
02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:18,210
I saw him reaching for it.

1935
02:09:18,810 --> 02:09:19,610
Be careful here.

1936
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:23,430
If we

1937
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:31,330
lose somebody!

1938
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:32,570
Out!

1939
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:36,030
Me too!

1940
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,050
Just keep fighting!

1941
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:42,110
Oh my gosh.

1942
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:43,130
Oh my gosh.

1943
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:49,650
Holy moly.

1944
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:52,310
Are you kidding me right now?

1945
02:09:54,710 --> 02:09:56,030
Did you die?

1946
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:57,110
Why did you get him?

1947
02:09:59,210 --> 02:10:00,470
This is insanity.

1948
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:01,630
We lost someone else?

1949
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:02,170
Oh gosh.

1950
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:02,590
Okay.

1951
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,070
Don't worry about these guys!

1952
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:10,450
Sorry, Doc.

1953
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:20,650
Yeah, where are my ant lion?

1954
02:10:20,810 --> 02:10:22,970
Oh, well there's no sand around, that's why.

1955
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:24,730
Wait, why did we come up here then?

1956
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:25,550
Oh, there's stairs.

1957
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:27,670
What the?

1958
02:10:29,210 --> 02:10:30,350
Wait, is this guy dead?

1959
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:30,990
No, wait.

1960
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:32,070
Yeah.

1961
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:33,110
Wait.

1962
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:33,830
Yeah.

1963
02:10:35,130 --> 02:10:38,070
Oh, oh, I thought it was a mutated one.

1964
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:42,610
Where's our full team?

1965
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:43,570
What happened to them?

1966
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:44,950
Okay, so did we come up here for no reason?

1967
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:45,770
Oh, wait, there's over here.

1968
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:48,090
I think we came up here for no reason.

1969
02:10:48,610 --> 02:10:49,310
That kind of sucks.

1970
02:10:54,070 --> 02:10:55,450
Oh, oh, it's a big circle.

1971
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,290
Oh, no, wait.

1972
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:01,290
Ouch, ouch, yeah, you should be.

1973
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,290
Oh, can I go down?

1974
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:06,210
Did I miss something?

1975
02:11:08,410 --> 02:11:10,130
Oh, we dropped down in here!

1976
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:11,470
I see, I see, I see, I see.

1977
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:13,570
My bad.

1978
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:24,210
Oh, yeah.

1979
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:28,850
I can't go, though.

1980
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:34,890
Oh, I don't have any.

1981
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:37,010
Are there any guys down here?

1982
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:38,510
Actually, I can't tell.

1983
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:40,290
Oh, team, we're here?

1984
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:40,590
Okay.

1985
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:43,150
The overkill.

1986
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:45,150
I thought there was, like, a bunch of them running at me.

1987
02:11:48,210 --> 02:11:49,530
That's why I did that.

1988
02:11:51,090 --> 02:11:51,730
Wait, I hear more.

1989
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:54,530
I think they're fighting each other.

1990
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:55,990
Let them fight.

1991
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:56,630
Let them fight.

1992
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:12,500
I don't know where.

1993
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,040
Excuse me.

1994
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:18,440
Hmm.

1995
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:19,080
Okay.

1996
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,440
It's like the Walking Dead.

1997
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:24,640
I can't get enough of these zombies, baby.

1998
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,740
I'm sorry, Freeman.

1999
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:36,420
Sorry.

2000
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:40,780
I don't want to risk touching the fire.

2001
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:43,380
I can't

2002
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:04,970
stop touching the fire.

2003
02:13:07,210 --> 02:13:08,290
Can I open this?

2004
02:13:09,550 --> 02:13:09,850
No?

2005
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:11,230
Open this?

2006
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:13,290
Oh, there's...

2007
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:26,740
Okay.

2008
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:32,020
Okay.

2009
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:35,760
Wait, what do I have?

2010
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:37,220
What do I have with that?

2011
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:38,960
Okay, let's just put this back on.

2012
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:44,340
all right ups we go

2013
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:56,320
oh i heard buggy sound no more people no more team

2014
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:10,490

2015
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:16,270
Squad said you got this.

2016
02:14:16,450 --> 02:14:17,690
It's really quiet.

2017
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:41,720
They're shooting at zombies.

2018
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:44,420
The void between levels has taken them.

2019
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,280
Wait, really?

2020
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:48,580
Or is it...

2021
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:51,780
Are they actually supposed to be here?

2022
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:56,140
Squad following.

2023
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,050
Anything you say, Doc?

2024
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:18,340
Stop yelling at me!

2025
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,880
I'm a careful player.

2026
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,460
If you don't like how I play, then you can leave.

2027
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:26,220
Oh, they're back!

2028
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:26,700
They're back!

2029
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:28,240
So it was bugged.

2030
02:15:32,210 --> 02:15:34,430
See, it's a good thing that I didn't just keep moving.

2031
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:35,930
Oh my gosh.

2032
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:46,040
Whoa!

2033
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:50,640
Wait.

2034
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:52,840
Oh wait, is that Alex?

2035
02:16:07,030 --> 02:16:07,430
Girl!

2036
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:08,930
Actually, now I can't tell.

2037
02:16:11,090 --> 02:16:12,270
Oh, it was Alex.

2038
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:14,850
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

2039
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:17,410
I've got Dr. Kleiner in a safe spot.

2040
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:19,030
Now we can join up with Barney.

2041
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:21,030
There's a command center downstairs.

2042
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:24,250
I'm hoping to find information about generator locations.

2043
02:16:24,850 --> 02:16:25,250
Ready?

2044
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:26,630
Let's go.

2045
02:16:26,770 --> 02:16:28,410
No, no, no, I'm not ready.

2046
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:31,330
No, no, no, your turret!

2047
02:16:32,610 --> 02:16:35,730
Your turret did a little bit of damage to me, Alex.

2048
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:38,670
Wait, do we can see Barney?

2049
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:40,270
Dr. Freakman doesn't need a hero.

2050
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:41,950
She's a highly trained professional.

2051
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:45,150
Let's go, baby!

2052
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:48,270
Whoa.

2053
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,310
You got them good.

2054
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:55,230
I don't know why I keep trying.

2055
02:16:55,310 --> 02:16:57,330
Wait, why is there more healing down there?

2056
02:16:58,190 --> 02:16:58,850
Kind of crazy?

2057
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:09,640
Cover you.

2058
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:10,480
Oh, okay.

2059
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:12,500
They're from everywhere, though.

2060
02:17:13,220 --> 02:17:13,760
Oh my gosh!

2061
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:17,080
I hope you're okay!

2062
02:17:26,890 --> 02:17:28,450
I think we lost a guy.

2063
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:30,990
He's not okay.

2064
02:17:31,210 --> 02:17:31,670
Is that our guy?

2065
02:17:31,830 --> 02:17:32,490
No, that's not our guy.

2066
02:17:32,630 --> 02:17:33,270
Oh, that's our guy.

2067
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:37,270
Well, maybe move when there's a grenade.

2068
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:42,750
Excuse me.

2069
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:45,950
Oh, I heard their footsteps!

2070
02:17:46,390 --> 02:17:47,150
I heard them!

2071
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:52,390
I heard them.

2072
02:17:52,410 --> 02:17:52,950
I heard them.

2073
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:54,170
They're big old footsteps.

2074
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:55,990
You'd better reload.

2075
02:17:56,270 --> 02:17:58,010
Yeah, actually, I was just about to say.

2076
02:17:58,330 --> 02:17:59,890
Oh, now Alex is doing it too.

2077
02:18:00,670 --> 02:18:02,390
Everybody's back seizing me.

2078
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:12,170
Okay, not yet.

2079
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:13,390
Anything?

2080
02:18:14,130 --> 02:18:14,990
Washing machine?

2081
02:18:15,210 --> 02:18:16,050
Let me get out of your way.

2082
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:16,910
Yes, please.

2083
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:18,910
She says that she gets in my way.

2084
02:18:20,430 --> 02:18:21,430
I love them for that.

2085
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:23,270
I love when they're stupid.

2086
02:18:24,730 --> 02:18:25,870
Now I have my own harem.

2087
02:18:26,110 --> 02:18:26,790
You notice that?

2088
02:18:28,290 --> 02:18:28,970
Let's go.

2089
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:36,510
Communal bathroom?

2090
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:39,330
Oh, you're right.

2091
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:41,510
It was, wasn't it?

2092
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:43,390
Nice.

2093
02:18:44,010 --> 02:18:44,770
Pardon me.

2094
02:18:45,010 --> 02:18:45,210
Wait.

2095
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:51,360
Whoa, it's just the onsen, everybody.

2096
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:53,840
It's just Sento.

2097
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:54,840
It's fine.

2098
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:02,790
Co-op bathroom.

2099
02:19:04,230 --> 02:19:15,780

2101
02:19:46,060 --> 02:20:03,860
I was one guy Well, we're in luck There's a generator in the square outside We're trying to disable as many as we can To loosen the Combine's grip on this sector It'll take me a few minutes to expose the core Then I'll need you to hit it with a burst from the gravity gun In the meantime,

2102
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:14,100
watch my back You were amazing back there, Dr. Freeman But I feel sorry for anyone who put down a security deposit Let's go.

2103
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:15,860
Okay.

2104
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:18,200
Let's go!

2105
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:20,120
Okay, so wait.

2106
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:21,900
I go to...

2107
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:22,440
What?

2108
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:23,440
And I gravity gun?

2109
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:23,780
Who?

2110
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:24,640
This thing?

2111
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:25,520
The generator.

2112
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:27,800
What's the generator look like, though?

2113
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:28,760
I guess we'll see.

2114
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:32,520
I guess we shall find out.

2115
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:34,560
This way?

2116
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,040
Which way are we going?

2117
02:20:40,350 --> 02:20:40,550
Oh.

2118
02:20:41,010 --> 02:20:41,390
Okay.

2119
02:20:41,710 --> 02:20:42,490
Wait, it's right here.

2120
02:20:43,850 --> 02:20:44,310
Oh.

2121
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:45,750
Oh.

2122
02:20:46,490 --> 02:20:47,050
Sauce.

2123
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:48,090
Hurry.

2124
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:58,480
Oh my gosh.

2125
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:07,140
Okay.

2126
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:08,240
Oh no.

2127
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:11,960
As soon as the generator's down, I'll open that gate and we can get out of here.

2128
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:18,030
Okay.

2129
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:20,390
Wait, as soon as, what gate is down?

2130
02:21:21,930 --> 02:21:24,730
There's a gate and it'll be down and then I go.

2131
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:26,010
Right?

2132
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:26,770
Okay.

2133
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:41,520
Sorry.

2134
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:42,300
Sorry.

2135
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:44,840
What is this thing?

2136
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:46,420
Oh, it's one of these guys.

2137
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:47,120
Oh.

2138
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,800
Where are they?

2139
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:50,600
Oh.

2140
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:53,140
Dang, I was too late.

2141
02:21:57,580 --> 02:21:59,660
Is this part gonna be- is it this gate?

2142
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:02,940
Is this part really annoying?

2143
02:22:32,030 --> 02:22:33,310
Up right, up right, up right.

2144
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,540
I'm wasting them.

2145
02:22:46,690 --> 02:22:49,570
Oh my gosh, wait, they're really coming from every side.

2146
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:56,180
Oh!

2147
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:00,860
I'm stuck on the wall.

2148
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:06,500
Ow!

2149
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:06,940
Shoot!

2150
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:21,520
Where?

2151
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,060
Oh, there it is.

2152
02:23:34,220 --> 02:23:35,580
There goes the external shield.

2153
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:37,880
Oh my god, no.

2154
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:38,540
My shot!

2155
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:44,340
Thank you!

2156
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:46,720
So sweet.

2157
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,280
Babies, aren't they?

2158
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:59,120
And okay, I give up.

2159
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:00,700
This is not good for here.

2160
02:24:25,370 --> 02:24:26,170
Oh my gosh.

2161
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:33,880
Oh

2162
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:43,990
my god, there's so much happening.

2163
02:24:44,110 --> 02:24:45,090
Oh, there's a thing here.

2164
02:24:48,630 --> 02:24:49,770
I hear them coming though.

2165
02:24:50,490 --> 02:24:51,230
Oh, that's it.

2166
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:06,590
This thing?

2167
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:10,030
What do I do?

2168
02:25:11,510 --> 02:25:12,230
What do I do?

2169
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:13,450
What do I do?

2170
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:38,060
Okay.

2171
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:39,820
Alright.

2172
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:42,020
Holy cow.

2173
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:46,040
Oh my god, there's so many men.

2174
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:58,240
What do you want me to do with it?

2175
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:22,140
You should be on the far side of that.

2176
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:26,700
There used to be a bridge here.

2177
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:29,680
Let me see if I can scout a new path.

2178
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,220
Ah, wait for me here.

2179
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:41,780
Wait, do I have to wait?

2180
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:43,920
Because there's, like, supplies down there, you know?

2181
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:46,440
Do I have to wait?

2182
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:47,680
There might be health.

2183
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:51,060
Oh, Alex, I'm not doing so well.

2184
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:58,500
Don't forget to reload, Dr. Freeman.

2185
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:01,920
Me going in with my...

2186
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:06,760
With my, uh...

2187
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:16,580
How do you zoom again without...

2188
02:27:16,580 --> 02:27:18,880
Looks like we might be able to get through down there.

2189
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:30,780
I'm not gonna make it.

2190
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:35,800
I'm not gonna make it, I can tell you that.

2191
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,560
Oh my god, his health!

2192
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:45,260
I'm gonna do like a hard save instead of an auto save.

2193
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:51,270
Oh here!

2194
02:27:53,870 --> 02:27:55,810
I'm sure there's more health in here, right?

2195
02:28:17,510 --> 02:28:18,490
I hear them.

2196
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:24,910
Oh, what the heck?

2197
02:28:26,230 --> 02:28:26,430
Wait.

2198
02:28:29,850 --> 02:28:30,550
Wait, how?

2199
02:28:30,670 --> 02:28:31,010
Maybe...

2200
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:31,870
Oh, I'm stupid.

2201
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:33,850
There we go.

2202
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:41,490
Surely there's more health in here.

2203
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:56,640
Yeah, I heard you.

2204
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:01,360
Yeah, I heard you.

2205
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:02,500
Which one's coming?

2206
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:03,060
Oh, gosh.

2207
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:08,000
Soup.

2208
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:12,580
Out.

2209
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:13,480
Out.

2210
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:19,040
That is

2211
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:23,360
not soup.

2212
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:26,160
For art commissioning purposes, what color is your

2213
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:49,060
Does Mint know how to one-shot manhacks with one attack off of the gravity gun?

2214
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:50,200
I don't.

2215
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:57,800
Yeah, I do have a reference sheet.

2216
02:29:58,580 --> 02:30:04,000
Um, if you're so curious, you can check that.

2217
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:07,720
Yes.

2218
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:12,220
We've seen a Mint Snake cosplayer.

2219
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:15,920
But when will we have a Gordon Freeman cosplay based on the thumbnail?

2220
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:18,140
Oh, hi, Kira.

2221
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:20,040
I feel like...

2222
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:21,300
Sorry, I'm gonna keep...

2223
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:24,920
Actually, at this point, I think the auto-save...

2224
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:26,520
Has me with the quicksave...

2225
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:27,980
Where, like, the quick-save would be, you know?

2226
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:29,060
So...

2227
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:30,680
Um...

2228
02:30:35,370 --> 02:30:36,010
I, uh...

2229
02:30:36,010 --> 02:30:37,650
Really just need some health right now.

2230
02:30:41,310 --> 02:30:42,010
Oh, I see.

2231
02:30:42,090 --> 02:30:43,050
I have to go up this way.

2232
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:49,590
Can I get through here?

2233
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:51,950
Does it need to be...

2234
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:54,490
Whoa, my gosh, I almost just blew myself up.

2235
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:59,590
That would have been crazy.

2236
02:31:00,410 --> 02:31:03,450
And also not the first time I've done this.

2237
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:05,450
Come on.

2238
02:31:05,610 --> 02:31:06,170
Come on.

2239
02:31:06,410 --> 02:31:07,110
You can do it.

2240
02:31:08,050 --> 02:31:08,730
There we go.

2241
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,280
Oh, did I just one-shot them?

2242
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:25,640
Somehow.

2243
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:31,840
Somehow I did that.

2244
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:44,760
Caught the second or third time as well.

2245
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:47,060
Hey, hey, wait a second.

2246
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:50,700
My brain gets bigger, the bigger my glasses are, okay?

2247
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:59,080
I think I've only done it once today.

2248
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:08,160
If you do it against a close wall, they one-shot.

2249
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:09,040
Ah, okay.

2250
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,080
I was trying to hit them and make them hit each other, but that seems way easier.

2251
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:18,000
I have six?

2252
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:18,840
Okay, here we go.

2253
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:22,360
Oh my gosh.

2254
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:23,240
Okay, here we go.

2255
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:33,880
They're like destroying everything in there.

2256
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:35,560
Wow.

2257
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:36,820
Wow.

2258
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:51,600
There's more guys.

2259
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:53,120
No, my friends!

2260
02:32:53,980 --> 02:32:55,320
What have happened to you?

2261
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:59,040
There's so much death in this game.

2262
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:01,200
Wait, there's a lot actually.

2263
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:02,780
Wait, there's a lot going on here.

2264
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:05,020
Why is this open?

2265
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:06,260
It's kind of mysterious.

2266
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:11,280
Whoa.

2267
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:18,600
I didn't expect people!

2268
02:33:19,580 --> 02:33:21,200
I didn't expect company!

2269
02:33:26,910 --> 02:33:32,070
Oh my gosh, I hear, I hear Zombos, I hear men.

2270
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:35,930
Okay, wait, let's, let's, let's, I was going to check out this way anyway, so.

2271
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:47,270
Ah, it's just some health.

2272
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:48,910
I mean, not just some health.

2273
02:33:49,390 --> 02:33:50,070
Like, that's huge.

2274
02:33:50,350 --> 02:33:50,910
We need this.

2275
02:33:51,970 --> 02:33:56,470
But, I mean, it's not like the, I mean, it's very obvious the other way we need to go, but.

2276
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:03,980
This place is spooky.

2277
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:06,600
I know, I don't like it very much.

2278
02:34:06,700 --> 02:34:08,640
I keep saving because I'm scared.

2279
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:10,280
Oh, that's where we came from.

2280
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:14,000
Oh, I'm hearing the pipes.

2281
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:18,460
I kind of like the audio clues that they give you a little bit.

2282
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:26,180
Like, you're supposed to use the pipes so they make sure you hear the pipes kind of way.

2283
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,660
I'm a scaredy ghost.

2284
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:30,740
Where'd that guy go?

2285
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:37,270
Where'd he go?

2286
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,660
Don't tell me the zombie got him.

2287
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:46,520
No way.

2288
02:34:57,540 --> 02:34:58,900
Are they shooting the Zombos?

2289
02:34:59,060 --> 02:35:04,180
Oh, now they're shooting the Zombos.

2290
02:35:10,110 --> 02:35:11,990
Sometimes I can't see the crosshairs.

2291
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:20,130
I don't hear him anymore.

2292
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:20,590
Oh, wait.

2293
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:21,690
I think that was them.

2294
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:22,670
Is it Z?

2295
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:23,450
Ah, yeah.

2296
02:35:24,630 --> 02:35:26,210
I think that was them down there.

2297
02:35:26,370 --> 02:35:27,010
The Zombo.

2298
02:35:27,470 --> 02:35:28,570
They took care of it for me.

2299
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:29,850
Easy.

2300
02:35:30,450 --> 02:35:30,890
Easy, easy.

2301
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:59,960
that was dirty that was dirty what did I pick up oh nice my leg oh good thing we got that health huh is it gonna do it again

2302
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:06,240
rude rude rude rude

2303
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:22,680
we're fine we're fine Maybe.

2304
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:31,240
I actually have no confidence, but, you know.

2305
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:34,240
Gosh, this is another really long chapter, huh?

2306
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:39,340
What if I fall down down?

2307
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:40,980
What would happen?

2308
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:49,340
Okay.

2309
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:51,380
Nothing, apparently.

2310
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,950
Okay.

2311
02:37:14,430 --> 02:37:19,910
Now, can I...

2312
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:22,730
I can.

2313
02:37:26,110 --> 02:37:27,210
I don't like this, though.

2314
02:37:27,250 --> 02:37:28,250
I don't like this one bit.

2315
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:33,890
Oh, okay, I thought it was going to be, like, a really long hallway, you know?

2316
02:37:44,330 --> 02:37:47,050
Hopefully he hit whatever he was aiming at.

2317
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:48,670
Come

2318
02:37:58,780 --> 02:37:59,260
back?

2319
02:38:12,670 --> 02:38:14,150
Was that supposed to be a puzzle?

2320
02:38:14,290 --> 02:38:14,950
I don't think so.

2321
02:38:15,230 --> 02:38:15,850
It was too easy.

2322
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:17,950
Like, what else are you supposed to do?

2323
02:38:18,970 --> 02:38:19,090
Oh!

2324
02:38:25,630 --> 02:38:27,170
Oh no, no, no.

2325
02:38:32,410 --> 02:38:34,050
Let them handle it.

2326
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:41,370
Oh shit, you son of a...

2327
02:38:42,850 --> 02:38:45,110
Oh, I almost died.

2328
02:38:47,630 --> 02:38:49,230
Morphine administered.

2329
02:38:49,830 --> 02:38:50,370
Thank you.

2330
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:53,370
Please, um...

2331
02:38:54,250 --> 02:38:56,370
How much better am I gonna get, Doc?

2332
02:38:58,470 --> 02:38:59,130
99.

2333
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:00,630
Okay, not so bad.

2334
02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:03,890
Oh!

2335
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:09,650
I don't like this.

2336
02:39:11,490 --> 02:39:12,660
Not a singular bit.

2337
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:22,500
Oh my gosh.

2338
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:24,260
What are you chopping on?

2339
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:27,500
I see rope.

2340
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,360
I think he got one of the guys.

2341
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:31,920
That's funny.

2342
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:37,100
Here he comes.

2343
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:38,000
His little tongue.

2344
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,860
Oh, there's another one there, too.

2345
02:40:00,820 --> 02:40:01,300
There we go.

2346
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:02,360
Goodness gracious.

2347
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:04,060
There's his head.

2348
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:08,480
I probably should have used this.

2349
02:40:13,370 --> 02:40:15,910
Use the ropes to cross pits?

2350
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:21,520
How even?

2351
02:40:26,010 --> 02:40:27,290
What's down here?

2352
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:28,250
I did save, right?

2353
02:40:30,210 --> 02:40:31,670
Oh, my God.

2354
02:40:33,470 --> 02:40:34,750
Just a man!

2355
02:40:37,890 --> 02:40:39,890
I don't think he even

2356
02:40:47,410 --> 02:40:50,750
I was going to say I don't think he even noticed me.

2357
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:59,530
Like he did, but he definitely was too stunned to speak.

2358
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:06,060
Aww.

2359
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:09,740
The hell are these crickets?

2360
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:15,520
Oh my goodness.

2361
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:18,080
Wait, how do I...

2362
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,300
I guess we'll do that.

2363
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:23,620
Come on, pull.

2364
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:32,600
Sorry, buddy.

2365
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:35,440
Crowbar will take care of it.

2366
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:40,540
I liked my plan better.

2367
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:42,480
I liked my plan better.

2368
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:43,500

02:44:57,690 --> 02:44:58,450
No, he's still moving.

2393
02:45:01,070 --> 02:45:02,470

02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:12,480
Who are you?

2396
02:45:12,980 --> 02:45:13,480
Come here.

2397
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:15,720
Hi.

2398
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:17,520
Come up here.

2399
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:18,180
Come up here.

2400
02:45:20,820 --> 02:45:22,060
Yeah, boy.

2401
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,060
You're tough.

2402
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:42,040

2404
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:02,160
Okay, I'm gonna save if I die, I die.

2405
02:46:02,460 --> 02:46:03,940
I just wanna see what's going on down here.

2406
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:06,100
Ouch.

2407
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:06,620
Okay.

2408
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:10,740
It's a tactical something, or whatever.

2409
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:13,760
Okay, wait, now I'm lost.

2410
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:16,240
Wait, now I'm like...

2411
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:17,640
Oh, I hate these guys.

2412
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:19,400
Wait, that's not what I'm going to do.

2413
02:46:29,610 --> 02:46:31,050
I didn't mean to use that.

2414
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:32,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2415
02:46:38,490 --> 02:46:39,630
We're jukein' them?

2416
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:41,250
I think I got all of them.

2417
02:46:41,410 --> 02:46:41,430
Oh.

2418
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:44,830
Just kidding.

2419
02:46:51,580 --> 02:46:53,000
Tactical reconnaissance mission.

2420
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:55,080
Maybe I should just go for it, though.

2421
02:46:57,400 --> 02:46:59,020
I've already made it this far.

2422
02:47:01,260 --> 02:47:01,920
What the hell?

2423
02:47:05,530 --> 02:47:06,050
Oh.

2424
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:07,310
That's awkward.

2425
02:47:14,280 --> 02:47:15,100
I just lightly tapped.

2426
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:15,800
them a little.

2427
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:18,860
Oh, wait.

2428
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:19,980
There's nothing here, though.

2429
02:47:21,940 --> 02:47:22,720
It's just all...

2430
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:25,280
It's just, uh...

2431
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:25,600
Stuff.

2432
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:27,080
What's it called?

2433
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:29,120
Supplies.

2434
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:32,840
Mario reference?

2435
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:36,400
Yeah, totally.

2436
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:42,960
Okay.

2437
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:43,700
We'll save.

2438
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:45,900
This might be stupid.

2439
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:47,000
This might be dumb.

2440
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:57,220
They're so stupid.

2441
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:05,820
They just leap wherever.

2442
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:11,380
What if I...

2443
02:48:11,380 --> 02:48:12,300
Gordon hit them.

2444
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:15,240
Oh.

2445
02:48:17,970 --> 02:48:19,930
They're so cute, though.

2446
02:48:22,310 --> 02:48:25,670
Oh, I hear one of the poison ones.

2447
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:30,340
Ladder to my left.

2448
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:46,920
Ladder to my left.

2449
02:48:48,220 --> 02:48:51,540
I don't want to waste all my ammo, so we're going to go for it.

2450
02:48:56,140 --> 02:48:57,260
I do not see.

2451
02:49:00,700 --> 02:49:01,500
That's okay.

2452
02:49:02,180 --> 02:49:04,640
Actually, oh, there's only like one guy left.

2453
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:18,500
The way I can, bro?

2454
02:49:26,540 --> 02:49:29,460
Oh, I saw this, but...

2455
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:31,260
Oh, I didn't realize it was a ladder.

2456
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:32,120
Oh, okay.

2457
02:49:34,100 --> 02:49:34,500
Thank you.

2458
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:38,440
I was just like...

2459
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:46,000
I was like, it's very clearly something because it's lit up, but I couldn't tell what it was from behind.

2460
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:47,940
On your right now.

2461
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:50,860
Okay.

2462
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:54,020
Ah, ha, ha!

2463
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,340
We're on the other side!

2464
02:49:56,820 --> 02:49:57,840
We made it!

2465
02:49:57,920 --> 02:49:58,840
Easy peasy!

2466
02:50:01,060 --> 02:50:02,640
There was that one guy.

2467
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:03,480
That's him.

2468
02:50:11,710 --> 02:50:12,870
I'm wasting ammo.

2469
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:18,760
There we go.

2470
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,720
It wasn't really Ravenholm, but it felt like it.

2471
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:25,740
Not even.

2472
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:27,980
It was just a tiny spooky.

2473
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,120
Could have been much, much worse, I'd say.

2474
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:33,060
What's in there?

2475
02:50:34,040 --> 02:50:35,120
How do I get in there?

2476
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:37,860
It's kind of fun.

2477
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,480
I want to crawl through the hole.

2478
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:48,520
I say, and then maybe it'll be like my way to escape and I definitely don't want to crawl through the hole.

2479
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:57,160
Thank you.

2480
02:50:58,020 --> 02:50:59,180
What's in this?

2481
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:05,720
Whoa, heavy.

2482
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:13,380
Is YouTube being sad?

2483
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:15,020
Okay.

2484
02:51:19,850 --> 02:51:20,630
A big Lego.

2485
02:51:23,370 --> 02:51:25,050
Yeah, probably explosives, right?

2486
02:51:25,130 --> 02:51:27,030
That I could like throw at.

2487
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:32,870
This

2488
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:42,000
is a big health, but I'll take it anyway, I suppose.

2489
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:55,200
Don't take his pillow.

2490
02:51:57,520 --> 02:51:58,400
Poor guy.

2491
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:00,140
Okay.

2492
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:09,560
All right, we're once again reconnaissance with my explosives, my exploding box.

2493
02:52:15,130 --> 02:52:15,690
Uh.

2494
02:52:17,450 --> 02:52:17,970
Uh.

2495
02:52:20,230 --> 02:52:21,530
It's so quiet.

2496
02:52:22,670 --> 02:52:23,650
Who's gonna be in there?

2497
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:25,090
Oh gosh, who's gonna be where?

2498
02:52:26,230 --> 02:52:27,130
Oh, I'm scared.

2499
02:52:27,810 --> 02:52:29,310
Okay, which way do I go?

2500
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:38,620
Okay, I'm hearing the pipes again.

2501
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:42,000
Oh, I see, I see.

2502
02:52:47,610 --> 02:52:49,070
I'm gonna be in there.

2503
02:52:51,230 --> 02:52:51,470
Maybe.

2504
02:52:54,790 --> 02:52:56,510
Keep your eyes open up here.

2505
02:53:06,330 --> 02:53:09,590
The way it's like so quiet, all you hear is the wind blowing.

2506
02:53:10,090 --> 02:53:10,890
It's really freaky.

2507
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:46,920
I wonder if I could have stopped that with my gravity gun.

2508
02:53:48,860 --> 02:53:50,880
So I don't think the box explodes.

2509
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:56,380
I think the box is just a box.

2510
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:03,100
But it was kind of heavy.

2511
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:07,720
Which one's the magnum?

2512
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:19,740
Where are you, my babies?

2513
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:23,580
Oh, revolver.

2514
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:24,100
I'm stupid.

2515
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:24,800
So sorry.

2516
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:28,800
I was thinking of...

2517
02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:29,480
I don't know what I was thinking.

2518
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:31,620
Prospo might be tricky.

2519
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:35,560
I only have 10.

2520
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:42,840
Let's try the revolve.

2521
02:54:42,940 --> 02:54:43,860
I only have 12.

2522
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:45,640
12 shots.

2523
02:54:47,780 --> 02:54:54,820
Can I make it?

2524
02:54:55,690 --> 02:54:55,850
Wait.

2525
02:55:03,870 --> 02:55:04,770
Uh-huh.

2526
02:55:41,070 --> 02:55:41,670
Ew.

2527
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:54,750
That was dirty, wasn't it?

2528
02:55:55,070 --> 02:55:56,110
That was so dirty.

2529
02:56:06,250 --> 02:56:07,730
I thought I saw eyes.

2530
02:56:11,670 --> 02:56:12,910
Okay, luckily not.

2531
02:56:13,470 --> 02:56:14,790
They are giving me crossbows.

2532
02:56:15,070 --> 02:56:16,150
I wish it was unlimited.

2533
02:56:16,470 --> 02:56:18,670
Oh, look, they gave me a revolver ammo too though.

2534
02:56:19,170 --> 02:56:19,730
Let's go.

2535
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:48,820
Maybe the crossbow would be better here.

2536
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:51,580
Or actually, I can't see.

2537
02:56:53,620 --> 02:56:53,820
Oh.

2538
02:56:58,140 --> 02:56:58,580
Ahoy!

2539
02:57:27,810 --> 02:57:29,890
He dodged into it.

2540
02:57:30,930 --> 02:57:31,870
I knew he would.

2541
02:57:34,030 --> 02:57:36,730
I don't like the flammable thing there.

2542
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:41,290
Oh, yeah, the explosive barrel feels like a trap.

2543
02:57:41,390 --> 02:57:42,350
That's what I'm saying.

2544
02:57:42,690 --> 02:57:43,590
Okay, I keep saving.

2545
02:57:43,750 --> 02:57:44,330
I keep saving.

2546
02:57:45,610 --> 02:57:47,410
Okay, goodbye full health and full.

2547
02:57:48,410 --> 02:57:49,950
We're just gonna hold on to it.

2548
02:57:53,990 --> 02:57:54,830
Wait, actually?

2549
02:57:55,850 --> 02:57:57,070
Wait, what do I do here?

2550
02:57:57,790 --> 02:57:58,270
Oh, wait.

2551
02:57:58,390 --> 02:58:00,970
Don't I need to...

2552
02:58:04,670 --> 02:58:05,950
I'm ready for you.

2553
02:58:06,130 --> 02:58:07,050
I'm ready for you.

2554
02:58:07,410 --> 02:58:08,050
I'm not ready.

2555
02:58:08,510 --> 02:58:09,530
I'm actually scared.

2556
02:58:10,950 --> 02:58:11,470
I'm not ready.

2557
02:58:11,650 --> 02:58:11,950
I'm scared.

2558
02:58:12,490 --> 02:58:13,530
Don't ambush me, please.

2559
02:58:14,030 --> 02:58:14,690
I'm just a ghost.

2560
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:15,490
I'm just a ghost.

2561
02:58:16,210 --> 02:58:16,890
I'm just a ghost.

2562
02:58:17,110 --> 02:58:17,850
I'm just a ghost.

2563
02:58:23,330 --> 02:58:24,350
I'm just a ghost.

2564
02:58:27,330 --> 02:58:28,270
Oh

2565
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:56,140

Ooh, green room.

2569
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:34,820
Ooh.

2570
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:43,240
What else can we grab?

2571
02:59:43,500 --> 02:59:43,840
Okay, nothing.

2572
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:45,000
Aha.

2573
02:59:52,830 --> 02:59:53,970
Oh, my gosh.

2574
02:59:56,490 --> 02:59:57,970

2578
03:00:11,250 --> 03:00:11,250
wait.

2579
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:17,860
Holy moly.

2580
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:20,600
I couldn't do anything.

2581
03:00:26,220 --> 03:00:28,360
The crossbow probably would have been better there, yeah.

2582
03:00:41,720 --> 03:00:42,460
Uh-oh.

2583
03:00:44,820 --> 03:00:45,140
Oh, wait.

2584
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:46,360
Do I need to walk on this?

2585
03:00:49,240 --> 03:00:50,280
There's no way.

2586
03:01:00,210 --> 03:01:01,810
There's health down there.

2587
03:01:06,630 --> 03:01:07,510
Think, Minky?

2588
03:01:08,530 --> 03:01:11,350
Well, I thought maybe I would have to reactivate.

2589
03:01:11,370 --> 03:01:25,450
it but like to have it move again look around you'll find it really a wheel a wheel

2590
03:01:34,370 --> 03:01:43,680
walking the rail was a good idea okay it's not electrified oh okay good

2591
03:01:50,240 --> 03:01:51,420
Oh my god.

2592
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:54,120
They're trying to smush me.

2593
03:01:57,640 --> 03:01:59,840
Wait, I'm in the opposite position now.

2594
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:00,720
I can shoot them.

2595
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:03,680
That's kind of fun.

2596
03:02:07,400 --> 03:02:07,760
Oh wait.

2597
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:09,720
Oh, I see what I need to do.

2598
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:11,180
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

2599
03:02:38,020 --> 03:02:39,760
When did I last load?

2600
03:02:41,060 --> 03:02:42,260
Threaded the needle.

2601
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:45,380
When did I last save, I mean?

2602
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:48,380
Oh!

2603
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:55,140
When did I last save?

2604
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:01,220
I don't want to wait for this thing again, though.

2605
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:02,000
Wait, I think...

2606
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:02,440
Okay, hold on.

2607
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:04,320
I'm just going to reload and see what happens.

2608
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:05,600
Where am I?

2609
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:07,620
Oh, okay, okay.

2610
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:14,760
This is actually fine, because then we know these guys come in on...

2611
03:03:16,220 --> 03:03:18,320
There were barrels... Oh, it's those barrels down there.

2612
03:03:18,540 --> 03:03:18,880
Okay, never mind.

2613
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:20,820
They come in over here.

2614
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:21,900
Okay.

2615
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:24,520
This is fine.

2616
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:27,680
It's exactly the mistake I made a few hours ago.

2617
03:03:37,470 --> 03:03:39,350
Now we're not, like, two hells.

2618
03:03:41,950 --> 03:03:42,950
We're not, like, to health.

2619
03:03:43,150 --> 03:03:43,470
We're fine.

2620
03:03:44,810 --> 03:03:45,090
Okay.

2621
03:03:46,710 --> 03:03:50,670
And then...

2622
03:03:50,670 --> 03:03:51,270
Oh, my gosh.

2623
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:59,220
I don't know if I'll make it.

2624
03:04:00,040 --> 03:04:01,260
I don't know if I'll make it.

2625
03:04:02,020 --> 03:04:02,920
I might not make it.

2626
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:03,540
Oh.

2627
03:04:03,980 --> 03:04:06,660
Wait, I forgot it's the slowest thing in history?

2628
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,660
I might not make it.

2629
03:04:12,460 --> 03:04:13,300
I might not make it.

2630
03:04:17,290 --> 03:04:17,510
Huh.

2631
03:04:18,030 --> 03:04:18,510
From where?

2632
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:24,700
No, please!

2633
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:25,640
Ah!

2634
03:04:49,890 --> 03:04:50,750
There's a ladder?

2635
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:55,570
Where?

2636
03:05:03,880 --> 03:05:06,200
Even from the yellow part that looks like a bit of a high jump.

2637
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,480
That's what I was thinking.

2638
03:05:08,780 --> 03:05:09,840
So I was like, wait a second.

2639
03:05:10,120 --> 03:05:11,560
Am I doing the right thing?

2640
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:18,840
At the end of the catwalk on the other side.

2641
03:05:21,220 --> 03:05:22,180
Over there?

2642
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:29,160
I see this line right here.

2643
03:05:30,800 --> 03:05:31,200
I see this line right here.

2644
03:05:31,660 --> 03:05:33,800
I see.

2645
03:05:39,160 --> 03:05:39,820
See it?

2646
03:05:40,100 --> 03:05:40,860
This one?

2647
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:42,040
Ugh.

2648
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:44,660
We all know Minto was ladder blind.

2649
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:47,340
Yeah, they really need to be in brighter color.

2650
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:53,880
They really need to be like purple or something.

2651
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:07,880
To be fair though, I thought my plan...

2652
03:06:09,960 --> 03:06:11,380
Like made sense, you know?

2653
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:17,680
Yes!

2654
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:25,760
Okay, but since we're going through the ladder...

2655
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:28,200
Wow!

2656
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:29,080
Wow!

2657
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:32,780
Oh my gosh!

2658
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:34,760
What the hell?!

2659
03:06:45,280 --> 03:06:47,080
I think ladders would be helpful.

2660
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:48,980
Yeah, and they're cute!

2661
03:07:18,500 --> 03:07:18,860
Oops.

2662
03:07:29,690 --> 03:07:30,530
Oh,

2663
03:07:41,420 --> 03:07:42,900
that guy is still there.

2664
03:07:43,080 --> 03:07:43,880
That's funny.

2665
03:07:47,740 --> 03:07:48,580
Okay.

2666
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:49,840
Alright.

2667
03:08:05,170 --> 03:08:05,650
Okay.

2668
03:08:06,590 --> 03:08:06,930
Alright.

2669
03:08:26,850 --> 03:08:27,690
Uh.

2670
03:08:28,070 --> 03:08:28,710
Ah!

2671
03:08:29,130 --> 03:08:30,590
I thought there was a...

2672
03:08:30,590 --> 03:08:30,890
Ah!

2673
03:08:31,430 --> 03:08:32,270
Ah!

2674
03:08:44,480 --> 03:08:45,640
Let me see it.

2675
03:08:45,860 --> 03:08:46,360
Let me see.

2676
03:08:48,580 --> 03:08:48,860
Okay.

2677
03:08:49,960 --> 03:08:50,260
Alright.

2678
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:50,900
Okay.

2679
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:53,080
Okay.

2680
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:56,300
This is better than before.

2681
03:08:59,140 --> 03:09:00,940
Can I even get this guy?

2682
03:09:06,260 --> 03:09:06,640
Oh my god.

2683
03:09:06,900 --> 03:09:09,160
Because he's standing, I feel like...

2684
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:10,500
I think he's like, uh...

2685
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:10,920
What's it called?

2686
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:17,180
Like, uh...

2687
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:20,360
Awake.

2688
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,100
Alive?

2689
03:09:21,560 --> 03:09:22,080
That's the word.

2690
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:22,620
Alive.

2691
03:09:30,700 --> 03:09:33,520
Now he can't bother us anymore.

2692
03:09:36,500 --> 03:09:37,060
Death!

2693
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:40,640
Death!

2694
03:09:41,300 --> 03:09:41,300
Death!

2695
03:09:44,480 --> 03:09:44,740
Hello.

2696
03:09:45,800 --> 03:09:46,180
Fine.

2697
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:48,560
I got an achievement for looking at this guy.

2698
03:09:48,900 --> 03:09:49,140
Alright.

2699
03:09:49,420 --> 03:09:51,120
And then we drop down, right?

2700
03:09:51,240 --> 03:09:51,900
Wait, what's this?

2701
03:09:52,340 --> 03:09:53,040
Is that a head?

2702
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:55,260
Oh, nope, that's more ammo.

2703
03:09:55,740 --> 03:09:56,920
Always welcome, baby!

2704
03:09:58,060 --> 03:09:59,420
Okay, now we drop down.

2705
03:09:59,960 --> 03:10:01,820
Uh, wait, what do I... we want this.

2706
03:10:02,380 --> 03:10:02,620
Maybe.

2707
03:10:03,360 --> 03:10:03,620
Yeah.

2708
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:07,160
Okay.

2709
03:10:28,140 --> 03:10:29,880
Oh, and I knew it was there.

2710
03:10:29,960 --> 03:10:31,880
I remember seeing it before too.

2711
03:10:32,760 --> 03:10:37,540
I remember seeing it last time when I tried to jump from here.

2712
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:46,690
Wait, it's green, though.

2713
03:10:50,470 --> 03:10:51,810
It's not green.

2714
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,760
I've never seen anyone die to that hopper before.

2715
03:11:10,060 --> 03:11:11,120
I didn't die!

2716
03:11:11,620 --> 03:11:13,620
First of all, that's...

2717
03:11:13,620 --> 03:11:14,380
That's...

2718
03:11:15,320 --> 03:11:16,040
That's inaccurate.

2719
03:11:16,600 --> 03:11:17,500
I reloaded.

2720
03:11:20,360 --> 03:11:35,540
whoa my friends we got split up by snipers and he's pinned down on a warehouse up ahead go ahead he's relying on you oh barney i'm on my way we got a team again

2721
03:11:40,230 --> 03:11:41,930
i almost killed them

2722
03:11:54,830 --> 03:11:55,970
oh shoot

2723
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:05,120
Oh my god.

2724
03:12:05,460 --> 03:12:06,100
Oh my god.

2725
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:08,540
You're Barney's old friend, aren't you?

2726
03:12:08,660 --> 03:12:08,940
Yeah.

2727
03:12:09,880 --> 03:12:10,640
Maybe you can help him.

2728
03:12:10,980 --> 03:12:12,760
Sniper's trapped him up on that warehouse roof.

2729
03:12:13,460 --> 03:12:16,540
He was going for a cache of grenades, but I doubt he can get to them now.

2730
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:17,580
Warehouse roof.

2731
03:12:17,820 --> 03:12:18,820
Go on, Dr. Freeman.

2732
03:12:20,680 --> 03:12:21,520
Lead on, Freeman.

2733
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:22,340
Okay.

2734
03:12:23,280 --> 03:12:25,180
I'm not quite sure where to go.

2735
03:12:26,200 --> 03:12:27,000
Okay, so not here.

2736
03:12:29,220 --> 03:12:29,660
Ouch.

2737
03:12:30,780 --> 03:12:31,220
Ouch.

2738
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:31,720
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2739
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:32,780
Ouch, ouch.

2740
03:12:33,560 --> 03:12:34,540
Oh my god.

2741
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:35,900
Everybody is dying.

2742
03:12:38,200 --> 03:12:39,060
Warehouse.

2743
03:12:39,940 --> 03:12:40,860
Warehouse.

2744
03:12:50,730 --> 03:12:51,210
One second.

2745
03:12:52,390 --> 03:12:53,530
One second.

2746
03:12:56,110 --> 03:12:56,630
One second.

2747
03:12:58,170 --> 03:12:59,070
Oh, there we go.

2748
03:13:07,670 --> 03:13:08,310
Nice.

2749
03:13:11,810 --> 03:13:14,090
I have one grenade left.

2750
03:13:21,770 --> 03:13:25,530
Oh, my allies are dead.

2751
03:13:28,050 --> 03:13:29,110
This is 100% a first try.

2752
03:13:29,350 --> 03:13:30,590
Don't even...

2753
03:13:30,590 --> 03:13:31,670
Don't even pretend.

2754
03:13:31,990 --> 03:13:35,030
What warehouse roof are we talking about?

2755
03:13:36,070 --> 03:13:37,390
Is it supposed to be obvious?

2756
03:13:37,770 --> 03:13:38,290
Am I silly?

2757
03:13:42,730 --> 03:13:45,130
I think I'll save anyway, even though I have no people.

2758
03:13:56,190 --> 03:13:56,890
Yeah,

2759
03:14:07,100 --> 03:14:09,080
yeah, run, run as fast as you can.

2760
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:10,320
You can't catch me.

2761
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:13,940
I'm the Minter Red Man.

2762
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:19,200
From where though?

2763
03:14:39,890 --> 03:14:41,570
Oh, jeez.

2764
03:14:42,410 --> 03:14:42,410

03:14:48,330 --> 03:14:49,490
Mr. I'm scared.

2768
03:14:50,350 --> 03:14:51,010
Oh, jeez.

2769
03:14:51,210 --> 03:14:52,110
This is a scary area.

2770
03:14:53,430 --> 03:14:53,770
Scary.

2771
03:14:54,710 --> 03:14:55,590
Wow, jeez.

2772
03:14:55,850 --> 03:14:57,010
I'm scared.

2773
03:15:00,090 --> 03:15:01,370
Surprise, spooky.

2774
03:15:02,810 --> 03:15:07,030
I might be the most...

2775
03:15:07,030 --> 03:15:07,450
Ah!

2776
03:15:08,890 --> 03:15:11,150
Cracked sniper there is ever.

2777
03:15:21,730 --> 03:15:24,530
This is what I become when I'm terrified.

2778
03:15:25,150 --> 03:15:26,610
When I'm scared, okay?

2779
03:15:27,130 --> 03:15:28,190
I become cracked.

2780
03:15:29,290 --> 03:15:30,310
It's life or death.

2781
03:15:32,030 --> 03:15:33,230
I'm already dead.

2782
03:15:34,830 --> 03:15:35,990

Oh, hello.

Help, help me!

2790
03:16:33,400 --> 03:16:34,840
We thought we'd be safer down here.

2791
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:37,220
Little we know the place was infested.

2792
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:39,640
The rest of them headed upstairs.

2793
03:16:39,920 --> 03:16:41,260
It took the chance for the snipers.

2794
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:43,120
I guess they're still up there.

2795
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:45,500
Oh my gosh.

2796
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:48,320
Oh no.

2797
03:16:49,500 --> 03:16:49,740
Oh.

2798
03:16:51,020 --> 03:16:51,480
Oh.

2799
03:16:51,480 --> 03:16:52,340
Oh my god!

2800
03:16:56,770 --> 03:16:59,930
I'm gonna go through all my ammo here.

2801
03:17:06,070 --> 03:17:07,890
Sorry, I just shot you on accident.

2802
03:17:09,850 --> 03:17:10,870
You still alive?

2803
03:17:11,530 --> 03:17:12,870
How do I save him?

2804
03:17:15,710 --> 03:17:18,830
Are you gonna come with me or you hurt?

2805
03:17:19,130 --> 03:17:20,350
You're relaxing.

2806
03:17:21,490 --> 03:17:22,390
What are we doing here?

2807
03:17:24,030 --> 03:17:26,250
I didn't kill him, he's blinking.

2808
03:17:28,610 --> 03:17:30,150
This guy's alive and well.

2809
03:17:30,910 --> 03:17:31,550
On your feet.

2810
03:17:34,310 --> 03:17:35,290
He's alive!

2811
03:17:35,770 --> 03:17:36,530
He's moving!

2812
03:17:38,870 --> 03:17:40,530
He'll get over it.

2813
03:17:47,390 --> 03:17:48,410
Confested, huh?

2814
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:51,050
What is this?

2815
03:17:51,510 --> 03:17:52,090
Amnesia?

2816
03:17:52,930 --> 03:17:54,010
I've never played that game.

2817
03:17:54,170 --> 03:17:56,470
Wait, actually, is there anything in here?

2818
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:01,620
Ew.

2819
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:06,220
X marks.

2820
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:07,400
Oh, there we go.

2821
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:09,540
Oh, Jesus.

2822
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:15,120
Don't like these guys at all.

2823
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:17,540
They scare me.

2824
03:18:21,880 --> 03:18:23,320
Lying down injured guy.

2825
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:24,540
We'll remember that.

2826
03:18:33,590 --> 03:18:34,670
Taking a peek?

2827
03:18:35,590 --> 03:18:36,550
What's going on in here?

2828
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:41,320
We gotta head to the roof.

2829
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:48,040
Party!

2830
03:18:50,800 --> 03:18:50,840
Party!

2831
03:18:50,840 --> 03:18:51,680
Oh, I see some guy.

2832
03:18:53,240 --> 03:18:53,520
Party!

2833
03:18:55,080 --> 03:18:55,780
Party!

2834
03:18:59,400 --> 03:19:00,780
Oh, nice!

2835
03:19:02,260 --> 03:19:03,140
Oh,

2836
03:19:08,420 --> 03:19:09,740
come on.

2837
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:20,200
Nice.

2838
03:19:21,900 --> 03:19:24,460
Oh, okay, is that unlimited grenades?

2839
03:19:26,160 --> 03:19:27,080
Wait, is that party?

2840
03:19:28,540 --> 03:19:29,300
Barney!

2841
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:34,020
It's Barney right there!

2842
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:42,020
Okay, wait, before we see Barney, I am curious what's in here.

2843
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:47,760
Curious and terrified.

2844
03:19:50,360 --> 03:19:53,260
Oh my gosh, I didn't need to go downstairs.

2845
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:57,480
Oh, this is where I came from.

2846
03:20:06,460 --> 03:20:18,920
Okay, if it's a grenade battle they want It's a grenade battle they'll get The doors were locked Oh, okay I didn't realize Oh, I don't think I even tried them, so

Okay, one moment, please One moment, please Okay, gosh, this is such a long chapter too

2848
03:20:37,150 --> 03:20:38,810

2851
03:21:47,280 --> 03:21:48,260
Did you see that, Barney?

2852
03:21:48,520 --> 03:21:50,940
You would have been so proud of me.

2853
03:21:51,780 --> 03:21:53,380
Where does this one come from, though?

2854
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:57,220
That's what I'm not sure of.

2855
03:21:59,500 --> 03:22:00,240
How many are there?

2856
03:22:00,760 --> 03:22:03,410
I guess if we go upstairs, we'll know.

2857
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:13,920
Oh my god.

2858
03:22:16,420 --> 03:22:16,960
Open

2859
03:22:20,150 --> 03:22:20,670
windows?

2860
03:22:22,090 --> 03:22:23,870
What the heck was that?

2861
03:22:25,910 --> 03:22:26,870
bird up here?

2862
03:22:28,550 --> 03:22:29,050
Aha!

2863
03:22:29,510 --> 03:22:30,530
I see, I see.

2864
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:32,510
Okay.

2865
03:22:41,020 --> 03:22:43,900
I think that is a...

2866
03:22:43,900 --> 03:22:44,620
Head crab, no.

2867
03:22:46,860 --> 03:22:48,440
Oh, no, they are birds!

2868
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:52,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2869
03:22:56,260 --> 03:22:58,040
Yeah, you shuffle them feet.

2870
03:23:02,610 --> 03:23:02,950
Okay.

2871
03:23:04,890 --> 03:23:06,490
We gotta scare him off.

2872
03:23:09,850 --> 03:23:11,270
I think I was too high.

2873
03:23:14,800 --> 03:23:15,640
Dang it.

2874
03:23:17,200 --> 03:23:19,700
I'll never recreate what we had before, guys.

2875
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:24,020
Okay, I got him.

2876
03:23:25,540 --> 03:23:26,420
We got that guy.

2877
03:23:26,980 --> 03:23:27,400
Nice.

2878
03:23:28,220 --> 03:23:28,820
Two down?

2879
03:23:32,260 --> 03:23:33,960
I'll never recreate it.

2880
03:23:35,680 --> 03:23:39,180
It was the coolest I'll ever...

2881
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:44,400
It's the coolest I'll ever be!

2882
03:23:46,380 --> 03:23:48,220
Now this one...

2883
03:23:49,400 --> 03:23:50,380
Not quite sure.

2884
03:23:50,660 --> 03:23:52,840
I am quite sure.

2885
03:23:54,660 --> 03:23:55,840
Oh, oh, oh.

2886
03:24:09,700 --> 03:24:11,180
Spam, don't you guys.

2887
03:24:23,110 --> 03:24:24,910
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2888
03:24:33,300 --> 03:24:34,780
Maybe he got it.

2889
03:24:35,760 --> 03:24:35,980
No.

2890
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:38,160
Why can't you aim, Mr.

2891
03:24:44,480 --> 03:24:47,240
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2892
03:24:54,740 --> 03:24:55,420
Over here.

2893
03:24:56,380 --> 03:24:57,540
How am I supposed to...

2894
03:24:57,540 --> 03:24:58,080
Ay, ay, yeah.

2895
03:25:01,660 --> 03:25:02,140
Where?

2896
03:25:05,140 --> 03:25:07,560
Barney, why didn't you take care of these headcrows?

2897
03:25:10,460 --> 03:25:13,700
Oh my gosh, he was right behind me!

2898
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:29,680
He was hiding too!

2899
03:25:31,300 --> 03:25:32,820
Oh my goodness!

2900
03:25:50,720 --> 03:25:51,920
How can I get closer?

2901
03:25:56,910 --> 03:25:57,130
Ow!

2902
03:25:57,350 --> 03:25:59,310
Gordon, take out these snipers, would you?

2903
03:25:59,430 --> 03:26:00,170
I'm trying!

2904
03:26:00,370 --> 03:26:01,050
I'm trying!

2905
03:26:13,240 --> 03:26:13,740
Okay.

2906
03:26:30,050 --> 03:26:31,050
There we go.

2907
03:26:33,290 --> 03:26:34,070
All right, thanks, Gordon.

2908
03:26:34,770 --> 03:26:34,870
Oh.

2909
03:26:42,430 --> 03:26:44,430
Wait, I didn't do that.

2910
03:26:44,930 --> 03:26:45,930
I was switching my gun.

2911
03:26:48,430 --> 03:26:48,750
Okay.

2912
03:26:51,450 --> 03:26:56,310
I almost want to restart because I lost so much health trying to run from it.

2913
03:26:57,030 --> 03:26:57,610
Barney.

2914
03:26:58,530 --> 03:27:00,970
Barney, did you see how cool I was?

2915
03:27:01,750 --> 03:27:02,930
Barney praised me.

2916
03:27:03,930 --> 03:27:04,410
Barney!

2917
03:27:06,250 --> 03:27:08,570
Barney, tell them, tell me I was cool!

2918
03:27:09,810 --> 03:27:10,570
Oh, this way, okay.

2919
03:27:11,850 --> 03:27:12,590
Over here!

2920
03:27:12,770 --> 03:27:13,570
Over here!

2921
03:27:13,970 --> 03:27:15,490
I didn't know where you going, okay.

2922
03:27:18,610 --> 03:27:19,730
Let me get this gate.

2923
03:27:20,010 --> 03:27:22,670
My civil protection status still gives me limited clearance.

2924
03:27:23,930 --> 03:27:25,370
Did you hear a cat just now?

2925
03:27:25,730 --> 03:27:26,190
A cat?

2926
03:27:27,150 --> 03:27:28,870
That damn thing haunts me.

2927
03:27:29,730 --> 03:27:30,370
A cat?

2928
03:27:37,430 --> 03:27:38,270
Where?

2929
03:27:40,910 --> 03:27:41,330
What?

2930
03:27:42,350 --> 03:27:42,670
What are we?

2931
03:27:43,330 --> 03:27:44,350
Look out for what?

2932
03:27:51,400 --> 03:27:51,760
Okay.

2933
03:27:53,340 --> 03:27:53,340
Oh,

2934
03:27:57,580 --> 03:27:57,980
the cat.

2935
03:27:58,540 --> 03:27:59,080
Oh, the...

2936
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:04,020
Okay, Barney.

2937
03:28:17,500 --> 03:28:18,840
Which Barney is this?

2938
03:28:21,960 --> 03:28:23,040
Which Barney?

2939
03:28:23,840 --> 03:28:25,110
Which Barney is this?

2940
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:27,080
Oh,

2941
03:28:31,780 --> 03:28:32,440
it's gone.

2942
03:28:41,550 --> 03:28:42,670
Barney, I'm scared.

2943
03:28:42,810 --> 03:28:46,270
Anytime I hear something flying around, I have deep trauma.

2944
03:28:47,370 --> 03:28:49,070
It kind of looked like that, actually.

2945
03:28:50,210 --> 03:28:51,930
The thing that caused my deep trauma.

2946
03:29:02,390 --> 03:29:03,830
I hear people talking.

2947
03:29:06,110 --> 03:29:06,710
Anything else?

2948
03:29:15,070 --> 03:29:16,330
Ouch, oops.

2949
03:29:17,130 --> 03:29:18,530
Oh, my bad.

2950
03:29:24,350 --> 03:29:25,590
Okay, we're fine.

2951
03:29:42,500 --> 03:29:43,980
Whoa, where'd you guys come from?

2952
03:29:48,640 --> 03:29:49,520
Ouch, ouch.

2953
03:29:52,160 --> 03:29:52,420
Cover!

2954
03:29:52,980 --> 03:29:53,820
You fuckers!

2955
03:29:54,140 --> 03:29:54,420
What

2956
03:30:02,610 --> 03:30:03,910
did you shoot?

2957
03:30:11,530 --> 03:30:13,210
Did I get it?

2958
03:30:13,490 --> 03:30:15,170
One more try.

2959
03:30:19,210 --> 03:30:20,170
More try.

2960
03:30:21,350 --> 03:30:21,950
Oh my god.

2961
03:30:22,670 --> 03:30:24,330
Oh my god, my aim is so bad.

2962
03:30:25,810 --> 03:30:25,830
Team.

2963
03:30:26,390 --> 03:30:27,550
Team, don't rely on me.

2964
03:30:27,670 --> 03:30:29,010
Someone else take the grab gun.

2965
03:30:30,090 --> 03:30:30,570
Team.

2966
03:30:32,590 --> 03:30:33,070
Team.

2967
03:30:33,570 --> 03:30:34,050
Someone else.

2968
03:30:34,290 --> 03:30:35,570
Oh my god, let's use a grenade.

2969
03:30:45,700 --> 03:30:46,180
Barney.

2970
03:30:46,780 --> 03:30:48,360
I'm not trying to sacrifice you.

2971
03:31:00,340 --> 03:31:01,300
Goodness, great.

2972
03:31:02,680 --> 03:31:04,200
Wow, there's a lot of stuff here.

2973
03:31:04,400 --> 03:31:08,420
There's an old building up ahead, a basement museum or something like that.

2974
03:31:08,780 --> 03:31:13,160
Whatever the hell it used to be, now it's a nexus for Overwatch in City 17.

2975
03:31:13,980 --> 03:31:18,300
It's the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge suppression device.

2976
03:31:18,460 --> 03:31:21,100
It's raining down hell from the roof of that place.

2977
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:25,300
Okay.

2978
03:31:26,500 --> 03:31:27,140
Sorry, Doc.

2979
03:31:27,400 --> 03:31:27,860
Sorry.

2980
03:31:35,950 --> 03:31:37,070
Are you hearing someone talking?

2981
03:31:37,510 --> 03:31:38,890
Like a doctor or a scientist?

2982
03:31:42,770 --> 03:31:46,190
There it is.

2983
03:31:46,350 --> 03:31:47,450
The Overwatch Nexus.

2984
03:31:48,070 --> 03:31:49,790
Looks like they're mobilizing big time.

2985
03:31:50,230 --> 03:31:51,810
You can sort of see the gate from here.

2986
03:31:52,130 --> 03:31:53,610
I'll show you when we get to street level.

2987
03:31:53,910 --> 03:31:54,390
Okay.

2988
03:31:54,790 --> 03:31:57,270
We'll have to get in that building to open the gate.

2989
03:31:57,610 --> 03:32:03,270
Even then, the suppression device will suppress anyone coming through unless we shut it down.

2990
03:32:04,550 --> 03:32:05,410
Then let's go.

2991
03:32:08,870 --> 03:32:09,390
Okay.

2992
03:32:10,670 --> 03:32:13,510
Oh, he's got it.

2993
03:32:16,690 --> 03:32:17,870
I hear a turret.

2994
03:32:26,990 --> 03:32:28,190
So much for stealth.

2995
03:32:30,730 --> 03:32:32,090
Was that

2996
03:32:46,510 --> 03:32:46,750
me?

2997
03:32:47,150 --> 03:32:48,190
No, I couldn't have been.

2998
03:32:49,470 --> 03:32:50,130
Oh my gosh.

2999
03:32:56,500 --> 03:32:57,600
What the hell?

3000
03:32:59,320 --> 03:32:59,660
Me?

3001
03:33:01,800 --> 03:33:02,220
Oh.

3002
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:04,100
Okay, that's fine.

3003
03:33:08,080 --> 03:33:09,920
There's that gate I was telling you about.

3004
03:33:10,300 --> 03:33:12,040
We'll have to come back here after we get it open.

3005
03:33:12,260 --> 03:33:13,480
If we get it open.

3006
03:33:14,960 --> 03:33:17,500
First, we gotta get into the Nexus building.

3007
03:33:17,660 --> 03:33:18,000
Okay.

3008
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:21,120
Okay.

3009
03:33:35,880 --> 03:33:37,860
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing!

3010
03:33:38,140 --> 03:33:40,460
You're not gonna hurt that thing from down here, Gordon.

3011
03:33:41,020 --> 03:33:42,860
We'll have to shut it down from inside.

3012
03:33:43,600 --> 03:33:46,520
Oh my gosh, how did I live?

3013
03:33:48,160 --> 03:33:49,540
I gotta save anyway.

3014
03:33:50,220 --> 03:33:51,440
Um, this time.

3015
03:33:54,820 --> 03:33:55,940
Oh my gosh, okay.

3016
03:33:58,300 --> 03:34:00,960
Ow, I just took- I took down from that.

3017
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:04,200
Cal here?

3018
03:34:07,920 --> 03:34:09,060
Oh, that's the wrong gun.

3019
03:34:09,640 --> 03:34:10,720
That's not a gun at all.

3020
03:34:13,880 --> 03:34:14,920
Oh my gosh.

3021
03:34:18,840 --> 03:34:20,060
Did it make my license?

3022
03:34:23,300 --> 03:34:25,160
Thank you for the raid.

3023
03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:28,360
Would it

3024
03:34:58,530 --> 03:35:00,110
be worth to use something else?

3025
03:35:00,650 --> 03:35:01,910
Well, I have two all-time.

3026
03:35:02,950 --> 03:35:04,890
So let's just keep running.

3027
03:35:15,140 --> 03:35:15,920
Everybody in?

3028
03:35:17,880 --> 03:35:19,300
Oh, we just lost somebody?

3029
03:35:23,260 --> 03:35:25,540
Uh-oh, why are you giving me more turrets?

3030
03:35:26,620 --> 03:35:28,220
Why are they giving me turrets, Barney?

3031
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:30,820
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

3032
03:35:31,300 --> 03:35:32,420
Phil, thanks for the gifted!

3033
03:35:32,780 --> 03:35:34,380
Thanks for the five gifted, thank you, duck girl!

3034
03:35:37,060 --> 03:35:37,860
Rip... riperoni?

3035
03:35:38,460 --> 03:35:39,400
Just a little bit.

3036
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:47,320
Oh wait.

3037
03:35:49,420 --> 03:35:50,080
There's nothing here.

3038
03:35:50,300 --> 03:35:51,440
Oh, these are just guns.

3039
03:35:51,720 --> 03:35:52,700
I can't see at all.

3040
03:35:52,800 --> 03:35:54,620
I thought they were the little turrets.

3041
03:35:57,560 --> 03:35:59,000
Turret things, you know?

3042
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:02,780
Why is there just a cage here?

3043
03:36:06,500 --> 03:36:08,160
Those glasses aren't helping.

3044
03:36:10,220 --> 03:36:11,960
You might be right.

3045
03:36:15,500 --> 03:36:16,400
I'm honest.

3046
03:36:16,420 --> 03:36:30,330
honestly am more grateful that it's not um what i thought it was because uh because because because because i don't want to do another tower defense again all right let's go

3047
03:36:34,020 --> 03:36:37,880

3049
03:37:45,390 --> 03:37:46,530
How old are you?

3050
03:37:50,210 --> 03:37:51,490
This is, yeah.

3051
03:37:53,430 --> 03:37:53,990
Um, wait.

3052
03:37:54,150 --> 03:37:55,010
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3053
03:37:57,890 --> 03:37:58,770
Ha ha ha ha.

3054
03:38:07,400 --> 03:38:09,000
I got it, I got it.

3055
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:10,740
I'm a pretty smart lady.

3056
03:38:11,620 --> 03:38:11,660
Oh.

3057
03:38:20,580 --> 03:38:22,160
How long is this chapter?

3058
03:38:23,500 --> 03:38:25,740
Barney, buddy, we're gonna need you to start hitting your shots.

3059
03:38:29,020 --> 03:38:29,900
Real though.

3060
03:38:32,830 --> 03:38:33,870
Do we have anything I can throw?

3061
03:38:35,710 --> 03:38:36,150
Soup?

3062
03:38:36,710 --> 03:38:37,790
I don't think that'll help.

3063
03:38:40,930 --> 03:38:42,730
I don't think soup will help.

3064
03:38:48,180 --> 03:38:48,860
Where's Glyzo?

3065
03:38:50,820 --> 03:38:51,940
Gladly, gladly, glad.

3066
03:38:52,080 --> 03:38:53,120
Okay, that's a lot.

3067
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:56,280
They're like, hey, do you need every single grenade ever?

3068
03:38:57,540 --> 03:38:59,400
Okay, what are you trying to tell me, huh?

3069
03:38:59,700 --> 03:39:00,160
Huh, game?

3070
03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:04,340
If I get hurt from this, I'm blaming the game.

3071
03:39:10,420 --> 03:39:11,260
Did it do anything?

3072
03:39:11,480 --> 03:39:11,640
No.

3073
03:39:13,960 --> 03:39:16,520
A new chapter started right before Barney.

3074
03:39:18,540 --> 03:39:18,820
Wait.

3075
03:39:21,600 --> 03:39:22,100
Did it?

3076
03:39:28,300 --> 03:39:31,340
These are strapped to the floor.

3077
03:39:35,080 --> 03:39:35,620
Uh-oh.

3078
03:39:35,900 --> 03:39:36,460
Turrets.

3079
03:39:36,900 --> 03:39:38,500
Hey, you've got the HEV suit.

3080
03:39:38,520 --> 03:39:44,760

3081
03:39:48,160 --> 03:39:50,200

3083
03:40:18,860 --> 03:40:19,160
Wait.

3084
03:40:21,140 --> 03:40:22,740
You can roll grenades.

3085
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:23,380
I can?

3086
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:26,520
How?

3087
03:40:35,290 --> 03:40:36,330
Right click.

3088
03:40:38,470 --> 03:40:39,770
Will that do anything?

3089
03:40:47,340 --> 03:40:47,540
Oh.

3090
03:40:49,560 --> 03:40:51,200
Those wires just activate the turret?

3091
03:40:51,440 --> 03:40:51,800
Is it?

3092
03:40:52,140 --> 03:40:54,280
I can't tell if they're exploding ones or not.

3093
03:40:54,600 --> 03:40:55,100
Well, I saved.

3094
03:40:55,140 --> 03:40:55,400
It's fine.

3095
03:40:55,400 --> 03:40:55,880
Let me get out of your way.

3096
03:41:14,800 --> 03:41:16,160
how did you miss

3097
03:41:28,980 --> 03:41:31,620
okay I think it worked better when I was like crouching

3098
03:41:34,980 --> 03:41:35,680
oh wait

3099
03:41:39,800 --> 03:41:41,840
I was a little what are you doing

3100
03:41:46,990 --> 03:42:10,310
roll a grenade in there if you've got one that ought to do it oh there we go i think it actually went in this time great i'll open this up okay i was like it was going too hard before and bounce it against the wall

3101
03:42:19,930 --> 03:42:20,410
balls.

3102
03:42:27,080 --> 03:42:27,980
Sorry, Barney.

3103
03:42:30,220 --> 03:42:31,560
Barney, Barney, Bar.

3104
03:42:35,800 --> 03:42:36,280
Barney!

3105
03:42:36,560 --> 03:42:36,860
Uh-oh.

3106
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:38,480
Dropships.

3107
03:42:39,020 --> 03:42:39,840
What's that mean?

3108
03:42:39,900 --> 03:42:40,920
They'll be coming from the roof.

3109
03:42:41,180 --> 03:42:41,600
No!

3110
03:42:42,360 --> 03:42:46,440
If we want to get through these shields, we'll have to take out the generators one at a time.

3111
03:42:46,740 --> 03:42:46,860
Ah!

3112
03:43:06,370 --> 03:43:07,270
Oh my gosh.

3113
03:43:08,070 --> 03:43:09,730
Don't forget to reload, Dr. Freeman.

3114
03:43:09,910 --> 03:43:11,870
I just did, okay?

3115
03:43:12,790 --> 03:43:13,910
I thought I saw a guy.

3116
03:43:14,410 --> 03:43:16,030
Alright, so we...

3117
03:43:16,030 --> 03:43:16,850
Oh, it was that.

3118
03:43:16,950 --> 03:43:17,670
That was glowing.

3119
03:43:21,030 --> 03:43:21,510
Um...

3120
03:43:21,510 --> 03:43:22,450
The generators.

3121
03:43:23,930 --> 03:43:24,770
One by one.

3122
03:43:24,910 --> 03:43:28,110
Okay, I guess that's our first spot we have to go to.

3123
03:43:34,470 --> 03:43:34,950
Pain!

3124
03:43:37,390 --> 03:43:38,230
Okay, okay.

3125
03:43:40,030 --> 03:43:41,530
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait.

3126
03:43:51,610 --> 03:43:52,210
Oh, wait, no.

3127
03:43:52,990 --> 03:43:54,090
How am I supposed to get it now?

3128
03:44:04,980 --> 03:44:05,720
Excuse me.

3129
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:06,700
Excuse me.

3130
03:44:07,640 --> 03:44:09,080
Oh, wait, do I not have any more grenades?

3131
03:44:09,580 --> 03:44:09,980
What happened?

3132
03:44:10,940 --> 03:44:12,460
Wait, what happened to all my grenades?

3133
03:44:14,260 --> 03:44:15,560
Uh, what just happened?

3134
03:44:16,280 --> 03:44:17,300
What actually just happened?

3135
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:25,440
I didn't resupply?

3136
03:44:25,820 --> 03:44:26,960
Am I stupid?

3137
03:44:28,140 --> 03:44:29,860
Oh no, wait, I thought I totally did!

3138
03:44:32,160 --> 03:44:32,520
Oops.

3139
03:44:34,840 --> 03:44:35,340
Let's go.

3140
03:44:36,500 --> 03:44:39,040
I'm not gonna save, because that would be silly.

3141
03:44:47,030 --> 03:44:47,790
Be careful, team.

3142
03:44:49,550 --> 03:44:49,890
Hey!

3143
03:44:50,210 --> 03:44:51,090
Let us out of here!

3144
03:44:51,710 --> 03:44:51,910
Oh!

3145
03:44:52,150 --> 03:44:52,650
More team!

3146
03:44:57,350 --> 03:44:58,410
Hey, I'm screaming!

3147
03:44:58,690 --> 03:44:59,410
Let's follow him!

3148
03:45:01,030 --> 03:45:02,150
I love you, man!

3149
03:45:03,190 --> 03:45:04,870
Okay, now I'll save.

3150
03:45:07,050 --> 03:45:07,590
Finally.

3151
03:45:09,350 --> 03:45:13,350
Yeah, we're... Yeah, we're doing really well for ourselves, guys.

3152
03:45:14,210 --> 03:45:14,610
Yeah!

3153
03:45:15,190 --> 03:45:16,690
Okay, um...

3154
03:45:16,690 --> 03:45:18,110
Let's even the odds a little.

3155
03:45:20,250 --> 03:45:21,330
Okay, uh...

3156
03:45:22,450 --> 03:45:22,990
Okay.

3157
03:45:23,390 --> 03:45:23,810
No!

3158
03:45:23,930 --> 03:45:24,810
Why did you do that?

3159
03:45:27,810 --> 03:45:29,410
I think we just lost a man.

3160
03:45:32,640 --> 03:45:33,780
No, we didn't.

3161
03:45:34,440 --> 03:45:35,070
We're about to.

3162
03:45:46,810 --> 03:45:47,570
No, no.

3163
03:45:47,790 --> 03:45:49,590
Let's go back downstairs, guys.

3164
03:45:57,780 --> 03:45:58,960
Here, have a med kit.

3165
03:45:59,700 --> 03:46:00,780
Oh, thank you.

3166
03:46:01,320 --> 03:46:02,660
I think someone else needs one.

3167
03:46:03,680 --> 03:46:04,280
What was that?

3168
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:08,060
Okay, please.

3169
03:46:08,540 --> 03:46:09,040
Stay here.

3170
03:46:09,360 --> 03:46:10,080
You got it, Doc.

3171
03:46:10,320 --> 03:46:10,560
Yeah.

3172
03:46:11,800 --> 03:46:12,800
Stay down there.

3173
03:46:12,820 --> 03:46:23,300
No anything you say stay down there whatever you say stay down there Stay sure thing Gordon no stay stay don't follow me over here.

3174
03:46:23,360 --> 03:46:29,260
No, no don't go don't come up here Here goes stay yeah, there you go.

3175
03:46:30,060 --> 03:46:30,360
There you go.

3176
03:46:30,640 --> 03:46:32,220
There you go.

3177
03:46:32,220 --> 03:46:37,600
There you go No, okay there you go

3178
03:46:45,740 --> 03:46:47,940
Barney you are not an exception

3179
03:46:51,180 --> 03:46:52,480
You don't get to come up here!

3180
03:46:53,680 --> 03:46:57,500
Alright, what I'm going to try and do is...

3181
03:46:58,840 --> 03:46:59,640
I don't know.

3182
03:47:09,820 --> 03:47:11,080
Okay, we got one.

3183
03:47:16,440 --> 03:47:17,400
It says only...

3184
03:47:17,400 --> 03:47:19,800
Oh, maybe we did lose one because...

3185
03:47:19,800 --> 03:47:21,980
Okay, I think we did...

3186
03:47:21,980 --> 03:47:22,660
Maybe not.

3187
03:47:22,820 --> 03:47:23,500
I don't know, actually.

3188
03:47:23,700 --> 03:47:23,900
Okay.

3189
03:47:25,440 --> 03:47:25,960
Uh...

3190
03:47:25,960 --> 03:47:27,100
Other side!

3191
03:47:32,150 --> 03:47:33,650
Here, patch yourself up!

3192
03:47:34,710 --> 03:47:36,870
Okay, good job, team.

3193
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:44,360
What am I even holding?

3194
03:47:50,220 --> 03:47:50,840
Oh, nice.

3195
03:47:51,020 --> 03:47:52,640
We've got three generators to disable.

3196
03:47:52,840 --> 03:47:54,120
Might as well start with this one.

3197
03:47:54,540 --> 03:47:54,800
Yep.

3198
03:47:55,700 --> 03:47:57,740
Hey, you've got Eli's gravity gun.

3199
03:47:58,240 --> 03:48:00,040
Try giving those generators a jolt.

3200
03:48:00,400 --> 03:48:02,040
See if you can shake them up a bit.

3201
03:48:04,300 --> 03:48:04,920
This?

3202
03:48:09,300 --> 03:48:11,800
Man, Overwatch owns the roof.

3203
03:48:12,080 --> 03:48:13,180
And that's where we're at.

3204
03:48:13,800 --> 03:48:15,180
Oh, just like that.

3205
03:48:18,800 --> 03:48:19,420
Okay.

3206
03:48:19,940 --> 03:48:21,240
Two more generators to go.

3207
03:48:21,860 --> 03:48:22,300
Okay!

3208
03:48:29,370 --> 03:48:30,970
Watch out, team.

3209
03:48:32,350 --> 03:48:33,610
Team, I'm scared.

3210
03:48:33,950 --> 03:48:34,770
I'm scared for us.

3211
03:48:36,190 --> 03:48:36,790
Oh!

3212
03:48:37,190 --> 03:48:37,490
Oh,

3213
03:49:02,600 --> 03:49:04,020
Barney, I almost killed you.

3214
03:49:04,320 --> 03:49:04,580
For real.

3215
03:49:05,600 --> 03:49:08,060
Oh my god!

3216
03:49:11,200 --> 03:49:11,800
Ah!

3217
03:49:16,280 --> 03:49:17,960
Were you pointing that at Barney?

3218
03:49:18,060 --> 03:49:19,060
Why are you doing that for?

3219
03:49:20,800 --> 03:49:23,240
He doesn't trust you, I think.

3220
03:49:28,960 --> 03:49:30,260
I'm gonna reload.

3221
03:49:32,160 --> 03:49:33,200
I'm gonna reload.

3222
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:33,680
I'm gonna reload.

3223
03:49:51,260 --> 03:49:52,420
Anybody else?

3224
03:49:52,580 --> 03:49:52,620
Oh.

3225
03:49:55,600 --> 03:49:56,720
Reload, Dr. Freeman.

3226
03:49:59,420 --> 03:50:00,940
I'm going to take this.

3227
03:50:02,120 --> 03:50:02,680
Thank you.

3228
03:50:05,700 --> 03:50:06,220
Okay, cool.

3229
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:09,400
Everybody is alive.

3230
03:50:11,440 --> 03:50:14,380
Alive and well is another question.

3231
03:50:15,160 --> 03:50:17,580
But alive at the very...

3232
03:50:17,580 --> 03:50:18,420
Oh, this is a circle.

3233
03:50:18,700 --> 03:50:18,800
Okay.

3234
03:50:19,940 --> 03:50:21,240
Alright, let's try this way.

3235
03:50:26,060 --> 03:50:26,500
Don't!

3236
03:50:26,700 --> 03:50:27,120
Don't!

3237
03:50:27,200 --> 03:50:27,420
No!

3238
03:50:27,740 --> 03:50:27,940
Stay!

3239
03:50:28,060 --> 03:50:28,980
Here goes nothing.

3240
03:50:29,300 --> 03:50:29,740
Yeah, there you go.

3241
03:50:30,140 --> 03:50:30,620
There you go.

3242
03:50:31,720 --> 03:50:33,000
Now where are they at?

3243
03:50:42,950 --> 03:50:43,390
Okay.

3244
03:50:44,850 --> 03:50:45,730
Oh my goodness.

3245
03:50:47,350 --> 03:50:48,350
Are you at least taking cover?

3246
03:51:01,880 --> 03:51:02,320
Barney!

3247
03:51:03,320 --> 03:51:04,320
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3248
03:51:04,700 --> 03:51:05,760
Sorry, Barney.

3249
03:51:06,220 --> 03:51:06,320
Um.

3250
03:51:08,360 --> 03:51:10,200
The room is the worst in the entire game.

3251
03:51:10,400 --> 03:51:10,400
What?

3252
03:51:10,480 --> 03:51:10,900
This one?

3253
03:51:11,400 --> 03:51:12,760
Oh my gosh, it's not stopping.

3254
03:51:19,730 --> 03:51:20,150
Anyway.

3255
03:51:20,790 --> 03:51:20,970
Okay.

3256
03:51:21,370 --> 03:51:22,570
Let's not do that.

3257
03:51:50,720 --> 03:51:52,100
Please, excuse me.

3258
03:51:52,600 --> 03:51:52,820
Wow.

3259
03:51:53,420 --> 03:51:55,940
With that much security, there must be something good in there.

3260
03:51:56,500 --> 03:51:57,180
Go for it, Doc.

3261
03:51:57,360 --> 03:51:58,880
I'll wait here till you shut it down.

3262
03:51:59,320 --> 03:52:00,000
What are you?

3263
03:52:00,120 --> 03:52:01,160
What do you mean?

3264
03:52:01,360 --> 03:52:03,060
Go for it!

3265
03:52:04,300 --> 03:52:06,940
What do you mean by that?

3266
03:52:09,470 --> 03:52:10,430
Dr. Freeman?

3267
03:52:11,590 --> 03:52:14,130
What do you mean by that?

3268
03:52:17,870 --> 03:52:19,070
Excuse me!

3269
03:52:24,680 --> 03:52:26,360
That's not the one we got, right?

3270
03:52:26,500 --> 03:52:27,280
That's a different one?

3271
03:52:27,680 --> 03:52:28,880
Oh, there's this one too!

3272
03:52:30,280 --> 03:52:30,560
Ah.

3273
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:32,860
Sorry, Freeman.

3274
03:52:33,300 --> 03:52:34,480
I see, I see, I see.

3275
03:52:34,780 --> 03:52:35,020
Okay.

3276
03:52:37,780 --> 03:52:38,400
Save often?

3277
03:52:38,560 --> 03:52:40,220
It's instant death if you fail in that room.

3278
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:40,520
Okay.

3279
03:52:41,120 --> 03:52:42,140
Thank you for the warning.

3280
03:52:43,360 --> 03:52:45,200
I'm gonna see what happens if I go through it.

3281
03:52:48,580 --> 03:52:49,020
Okay.

3282
03:52:53,410 --> 03:52:54,310
Now we know?

3283
03:53:23,750 --> 03:53:24,630
What happened?

3284
03:53:25,450 --> 03:53:26,250
That wasn't me, right?

3285
03:53:29,150 --> 03:53:30,770
Don't freak me out like that.

3286
03:53:53,560 --> 03:53:56,620
Can I sneak under here?

3287
03:54:03,950 --> 03:54:05,390
Let's try it.

3288
03:54:21,590 --> 03:54:24,130
I warned you before, please don't spam!

3289
03:54:31,430 --> 03:54:32,530
Oh my goodness.

3290
03:54:33,570 --> 03:54:34,410
Why, why, why?

3291
03:54:37,270 --> 03:54:37,690
Okay.

3292
03:54:39,590 --> 03:54:42,630
Uh, wanna figure out where I go to next?

3293
03:55:02,420 --> 03:55:03,100
Hmm.

3294
03:55:04,400 --> 03:55:05,080
Hmm.

3295
03:55:08,020 --> 03:55:08,480
You don't

3296
03:55:19,060 --> 03:55:23,080
remember this chapter at all.

3297
03:55:24,240 --> 03:55:25,880
Maybe you blocked it from your memory.

3298
03:55:26,040 --> 03:55:26,560
So painful.

3299
03:55:39,290 --> 03:55:46,170
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out where I can, wait, oh, maybe the pipe somehow.

3300
03:55:47,610 --> 03:55:48,950
How do I get up there?

3301
03:55:52,170 --> 03:55:53,470
Can I grab this?

3302
03:56:02,390 --> 03:56:05,390
I already had the gravity gun.

3303
03:56:06,470 --> 03:56:07,650
Can I grab this?

3304
03:56:08,050 --> 03:56:08,370
No.

3305
03:56:11,230 --> 03:56:11,870
Again.

3306
03:56:13,810 --> 03:56:14,450
It

3307
03:56:22,540 --> 03:56:26,460
looks like I could jump on these ledges, but I cannot.

3308
03:56:29,920 --> 03:56:31,920
To go forward, you must go backward.

3309
03:56:34,640 --> 03:56:35,100
I see.

3310
03:56:37,020 --> 03:56:38,220
That's a good hint.

3311
03:56:38,360 --> 03:56:38,760
Thank you.

3312
03:56:53,300 --> 03:56:53,980
Wait?

3313
03:56:59,240 --> 03:57:00,060
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

3314
03:57:01,100 --> 03:57:02,060
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

3315
03:57:08,800 --> 03:57:09,880
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

3316
03:57:11,200 --> 03:57:11,540
Okay.

3317
03:57:30,190 --> 03:57:31,290
Oh, look at that!

3318
03:57:32,090 --> 03:57:33,750
Why do they supply those to me?

3319
03:57:43,140 --> 03:57:43,820
Creepy!

3320
03:57:46,700 --> 03:57:47,380
Creepy!

3321
03:57:48,200 --> 03:57:48,860
Creepy.

3322
03:57:50,940 --> 03:57:51,600
Creepy.

3323
03:57:55,880 --> 03:57:57,960
If the glass has gotten bigger.

3324
03:58:04,570 --> 03:58:05,670
Hey everybody.

3325
03:58:08,090 --> 03:58:08,430
You're welcome.

3326
03:58:08,590 --> 03:58:09,910
I did all the hard work.

3327
03:58:10,870 --> 03:58:11,050
Wait.

3328
03:58:13,150 --> 03:58:16,890
Is that the thing that Alex's dad was in?

3329
03:58:21,360 --> 03:58:22,640
Or am I crazy?

3330
03:58:25,280 --> 03:58:26,500
It's the interloper.

3331
03:58:31,510 --> 03:58:33,050
It looks like thighs.

3332
03:58:36,870 --> 03:58:38,650
I kind of see it.

3333
03:58:53,880 --> 03:58:55,440
Let's get in here, team.

3334
03:58:57,660 --> 03:58:58,980
Let's get in here, team.

3335
03:58:59,940 --> 03:59:01,080
I think they're coming.

3336
03:59:06,740 --> 03:59:07,780
Team, they're coming!

3337
03:59:11,560 --> 03:59:12,640
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

3338
03:59:13,360 --> 03:59:14,780
Wait, I can't get you!

3339
03:59:16,300 --> 03:59:17,660
Oh my god, he died.

3340
03:59:18,880 --> 03:59:19,600
No way!

3341
03:59:19,840 --> 03:59:21,800
You better

3342
03:59:31,330 --> 03:59:31,710
reload.

3343
03:59:32,470 --> 03:59:33,430
Did we lose...

3344
03:59:34,170 --> 03:59:35,630
No, we just lost one guy.

3345
03:59:38,730 --> 03:59:39,710
Didn't even work.

3346
03:59:39,930 --> 03:59:42,910
I don't like the alt of this thing because I don't know how to use it.

3347
03:59:45,870 --> 03:59:47,110
Well that kinda sucked.

3348
03:59:50,570 --> 03:59:51,430
Wait, how am I...

3349
03:59:53,870 --> 03:59:54,870
Do I...

3350
03:59:54,870 --> 03:59:55,490
Oh, there it is.

3351
03:59:59,670 --> 04:00:00,130
Woo!

3352
04:00:00,430 --> 04:00:01,050
That was close.

3353
04:00:01,330 --> 04:00:02,110
One generator to go!

3354
04:00:05,030 --> 04:00:07,390
You bounce it around and hope it hits something.

3355
04:00:07,810 --> 04:00:08,870
It's good in small rooms.

3356
04:00:08,930 --> 04:00:10,350
That's why I tried it right there.

3357
04:00:11,830 --> 04:00:12,550
Oh well.

3358
04:00:13,550 --> 04:00:14,050
Well...

3359
04:00:14,430 --> 04:00:17,170
It's fine, we got it done.

3360
04:00:20,590 --> 04:00:22,590
Can I disable this thing?

3361
04:00:23,450 --> 04:00:23,670
No?

3362
04:00:24,930 --> 04:00:27,950
I thought with the generator disabled, it would disable.

3363
04:00:30,250 --> 04:00:32,010
Oh, I was gonna say, why did it multiply?

3364
04:00:32,170 --> 04:00:33,390
Oh, it's just always three of them.

3365
04:01:03,640 --> 04:01:05,460
Oh my gosh, we just lost another guy.

3366
04:01:11,630 --> 04:01:13,810
Oh, we lost all our guys.

3367
04:01:14,370 --> 04:01:14,750
No!

3368
04:01:15,430 --> 04:01:18,210
Oh, it's so bad.

3369
04:01:19,250 --> 04:01:20,570
It's so bad, Barney.

3370
04:01:20,750 --> 04:01:22,090
It's just you and me, Barney.

3371
04:01:22,350 --> 04:01:24,070
You and me against the world, Barney.

3372
04:01:29,250 --> 04:01:30,730
It's so over.

3373
04:01:32,330 --> 04:01:33,430
This is still good, right?

3374
04:01:33,730 --> 04:01:36,390
Maybe I should have saved before I tested it.

3375
04:01:43,840 --> 04:01:45,080
You and me, Barney.

3376
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:46,740
You and me against all of them.

3377
04:01:48,120 --> 04:01:49,740
We can do it together, Barney.

3378
04:01:51,580 --> 04:01:53,200
Just the two of us.

3379
04:01:53,500 --> 04:01:55,020
Not gonna reload?

3380
04:01:55,880 --> 04:01:57,480
Nah, I like living on the edge.

3381
04:01:59,500 --> 04:02:02,320
We can make it if we try.

3382
04:02:03,300 --> 04:02:06,860
Just the two of us.

3383
04:02:07,800 --> 04:02:09,140
You and I.

3384
04:02:11,440 --> 04:02:12,660
Okay, one way.

3385
04:02:16,900 --> 04:02:18,640
I'm not gonna save.

3386
04:02:19,460 --> 04:02:20,980
If we live through this, I'll save.

3387
04:02:23,860 --> 04:02:25,300
I hear a turret.

3388
04:02:38,680 --> 04:02:43,850
Oh my gosh, I thought you were from...

3389
04:02:43,850 --> 04:02:47,530
No, no, no, no, no, you can't throw a grenade at me, I threw a grenade at you!

3390
04:02:59,260 --> 04:03:00,820
Okay, so we didn't live.

3391
04:03:12,750 --> 04:03:14,770
Oh wait, we had already defeated these guys.

3392
04:03:14,790 --> 04:03:15,570
Oops.

3393
04:03:17,590 --> 04:03:20,210
She said oops at the same time.

3394
04:03:23,650 --> 04:03:25,110
It's Barney stream now.

3395
04:03:25,470 --> 04:03:26,710
Barney has such plot armor.

3396
04:03:26,910 --> 04:03:29,970
It's not fair, but I'm also happy about it.

3397
04:03:31,450 --> 04:03:34,050
Here, the ambush is tough.

3398
04:03:34,250 --> 04:03:35,270
The ambush is tough.

3399
04:03:36,310 --> 04:03:37,450
Okay, hold on.

3400
04:04:12,190 --> 04:04:13,190
Thank you.

3401
04:04:13,270 --> 04:04:14,210
Thanks for the med kit.

3402
04:04:14,990 --> 04:04:15,450
Stop!

3403
04:04:15,630 --> 04:04:16,850
I have my grenades!

3404
04:04:26,220 --> 04:04:26,820
Where?

3405
04:04:27,180 --> 04:04:27,380
What?

3406
04:04:27,700 --> 04:04:28,140
Who else?

3407
04:04:30,460 --> 04:04:31,940
An attempt was made.

3408
04:04:32,100 --> 04:04:32,640
There was.

3409
04:04:33,940 --> 04:04:36,380
We have one more guy than before.

3410
04:04:37,600 --> 04:04:38,180
Take this med kit.

3411
04:04:39,040 --> 04:04:40,660
Oh, and he healed me!

3412
04:04:41,260 --> 04:04:42,700
Actually, I can heal here too.

3413
04:04:44,520 --> 04:04:44,900
Wait!

3414
04:04:45,680 --> 04:04:46,900
The gang's all here!

3415
04:04:50,120 --> 04:04:51,300
Let's go!

3416
04:04:53,960 --> 04:04:54,720
Wait!

3417
04:04:57,920 --> 04:04:58,420
Come on!

3418
04:04:58,600 --> 04:04:59,520
Everything's good!

3419
04:05:02,760 --> 04:05:04,940
The gang's all here, baby!

3420
04:05:06,700 --> 04:05:07,040
Okay.

3421
04:05:07,860 --> 04:05:10,420
I'm going to...

3422
04:05:10,420 --> 04:05:10,920
Ah!

3423
04:05:14,760 --> 04:05:16,020
Save right here.

3424
04:05:16,400 --> 04:05:16,640
Okay.

3425
04:05:17,180 --> 04:05:18,320
And then they start coming in.

3426
04:05:19,900 --> 04:05:21,360
And there's a turret.

3427
04:05:22,900 --> 04:05:23,640
in here.

3428
04:05:34,860 --> 04:05:37,260
And they're also coming for us, so we gotta be careful.

3429
04:05:37,960 --> 04:05:38,740
Yeah, behind us.

3430
04:05:38,820 --> 04:05:40,360
I think we should handle these guys first.

3431
04:05:53,820 --> 04:05:54,580
Good job.

3432
04:06:10,340 --> 04:06:11,160
Okay, team.

3433
04:06:12,080 --> 04:06:12,760
Good job, team.

3434
04:06:14,900 --> 04:06:16,480
Yeah, hunker down in there.

3435
04:06:16,780 --> 04:06:17,980
Yeah, pretty much.

3436
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:19,560
Okay.

3437
04:06:20,380 --> 04:06:20,780
All right.

3438
04:06:25,350 --> 04:06:26,330
What are these?

3439
04:06:29,190 --> 04:06:30,330
More grenades.

3440
04:06:39,660 --> 04:06:40,260
Oh!

3441
04:06:41,180 --> 04:06:41,780
Huge!

3442
04:06:44,020 --> 04:06:46,280
They start coming and I don't stop coming.

3443
04:06:47,120 --> 04:06:48,240
One more generator.

3444
04:06:48,340 --> 04:06:49,520
Yeah, we're on the last one.

3445
04:06:49,720 --> 04:06:50,620
We're on the last one.

3446
04:06:53,160 --> 04:06:54,580
I did save, right?

3447
04:06:55,660 --> 04:06:55,980
Okay.

3448
04:07:04,150 --> 04:07:06,090
I'm not sure what I hear beeping.

3449
04:07:06,330 --> 04:07:07,350
It's making me nervous.

3450
04:07:20,150 --> 04:07:20,750
I

3451
04:07:26,920 --> 04:07:29,240
don't like the looks of this either.

3452
04:07:30,640 --> 04:07:31,320
Where are you?

3453
04:07:33,680 --> 04:07:35,900
Oh my gosh, they're just running and shooting.

3454
04:07:36,860 --> 04:07:37,900
Wait, this is so stupid.

3455
04:07:52,660 --> 04:07:53,860
Stop running!

3456
04:07:58,590 --> 04:07:59,650
Are you guys just running?

3457
04:08:04,020 --> 04:08:05,520
I love Barney.

3458
04:08:11,520 --> 04:08:12,520
I hear you.

3459
04:08:21,300 --> 04:08:23,080
Set some traps for them, Gordon.

3460
04:08:24,320 --> 04:08:25,260
Um, my...

3461
04:08:25,260 --> 04:08:26,300
Me, I'm the trap.

3462
04:08:29,200 --> 04:08:29,980
My arm.

3463
04:09:04,640 --> 04:09:07,340
Well, I wasted the first one.

3464
04:09:08,460 --> 04:09:09,140
So...

3465
04:09:09,140 --> 04:09:09,540
No!

3466
04:09:11,520 --> 04:09:13,900
In the end, it all worked out.

3467
04:09:14,780 --> 04:09:16,900
It doesn't matter how I did it.

3468
04:09:19,420 --> 04:09:26,560
worked out still i'm wasted i thought this was the beep ah it worked out

3469
04:09:32,040 --> 04:09:49,420
okay if it works it works exactly you're a trapping though because i would fall for you get this sorry get get this corny out of here

3470
04:09:56,830 --> 04:10:02,390
Also, sorry if I haven't been hearing donals because the game is so loud and I haven't turned down so much.

3471
04:10:03,330 --> 04:10:08,730
But, Rishi, thank you, boo, thank you, Dr. Hushanonikas, oh my goodness, thank you.

3472
04:10:10,870 --> 04:10:11,190
Oh.

3473
04:10:13,630 --> 04:10:15,370
You guys stay there.

3474
04:10:15,510 --> 04:10:16,370
Let's go!

3475
04:10:17,070 --> 04:10:17,270
Yeah.

3476
04:10:17,990 --> 04:10:18,790
Good, good, good.

3477
04:10:22,430 --> 04:10:22,950
Didn't

3478
04:10:28,060 --> 04:10:29,160
light up that part.

3479
04:10:32,640 --> 04:10:33,380
That's gross!

3480
04:10:34,960 --> 04:10:37,500
I don't know how to get this one though.

3481
04:10:52,710 --> 04:10:53,670
Hide on the right?

3482
04:10:53,830 --> 04:10:57,050
No, this one will definitely see me.

3483
04:11:00,830 --> 04:11:04,650
I don't think I can pre-throw because I think the grenade has to go inside.

3484
04:11:10,750 --> 04:11:12,140
Run up, roll, and size.

3485
04:11:12,280 --> 04:11:12,640
Ah!

3486
04:11:14,340 --> 04:11:14,880
Oh!

3487
04:11:15,180 --> 04:11:15,660
Oh!

3488
04:11:19,970 --> 04:11:20,510
Oh!

3489
04:11:20,790 --> 04:11:22,010
I think we're all gonna die.

3490
04:11:24,350 --> 04:11:25,710
We're all gonna die, team.

3491
04:11:26,730 --> 04:11:27,630
We're gonna die, team.

3492
04:11:28,010 --> 04:11:28,870
Don't run into it.

3493
04:11:30,010 --> 04:11:31,210
Don't run into it.

3494
04:11:33,170 --> 04:11:34,870
Don't run into it.

3495
04:11:45,590 --> 04:11:48,370
We are very unconventional here, huh?

3496
04:11:57,220 --> 04:11:58,160
It's fine.

3497
04:12:01,300 --> 04:12:02,360
It's fine.

3498
04:12:02,980 --> 04:12:06,820
If it works, it works.

3499
04:12:08,260 --> 04:12:09,840
Oh, Yuki and Yuna!

3500
04:12:10,580 --> 04:12:12,860
Thank you so much for the return, Rektaeku!

3501
04:12:15,880 --> 04:12:18,500
My name is Mint Phantom.

3502
04:12:18,700 --> 04:12:19,660
I'm playing Half-Life 2.

3503
04:12:20,220 --> 04:12:20,920
It's a little stressful.

3504
04:12:21,260 --> 04:12:21,680
We're fine.

3505
04:12:21,900 --> 04:12:22,480
We're doing it.

3506
04:12:22,860 --> 04:12:23,620
Okay, did I save?

3507
04:12:31,620 --> 04:12:35,000
Shut down the suppression device by disabling its generators!

3508
04:12:35,020 --> 04:12:37,420
That will shut down the suppressor on the roof as well.

3509
04:12:37,560 --> 04:12:38,480
Okay, nice.

3510
04:12:38,740 --> 04:12:39,140
What is that?

3511
04:12:39,340 --> 04:12:40,320
Let's head for the roof now, Gordon.

3512
04:12:43,020 --> 04:12:44,760
Whatever you say, Barney.

3513
04:12:45,620 --> 04:12:46,460
Where's the roof?

3514
04:12:47,400 --> 04:12:48,400
How do I get to the roof?

3515
04:12:48,500 --> 04:12:49,080
Oh, okay.

3516
04:13:01,990 --> 04:13:03,010
It's like something.

3517
04:13:04,370 --> 04:13:05,450
Licks up the Barney!

3518
04:13:06,250 --> 04:13:07,250
Oh my gosh!

3519
04:13:15,210 --> 04:13:15,970
Holy moly.

3520
04:13:17,310 --> 04:13:18,110
Um, hold on.

3521
04:13:18,210 --> 04:13:18,950
I'm gonna go heal.

3522
04:13:19,550 --> 04:13:20,390
This way, Gordon.

3523
04:13:20,590 --> 04:13:20,730
Nope.

3524
04:13:21,010 --> 04:13:21,170
No.

3525
04:13:21,490 --> 04:13:22,000
No, hold on.

3526
04:13:27,530 --> 04:13:28,490
Reload, Dr. Freeman.

3527
04:13:28,790 --> 04:13:28,950
Oh!

3528
04:13:29,530 --> 04:13:30,210
Thank you.

3529
04:13:30,370 --> 04:13:30,970
See you, Roncha!

3530
04:13:31,050 --> 04:13:32,110
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

3531
04:13:33,530 --> 04:13:35,050
You vaporized like three guys.

3532
04:13:35,150 --> 04:13:35,790
Yeah, I...

3533
04:13:35,790 --> 04:13:37,670
That was a good part to use it, right?

3534
04:13:37,830 --> 04:13:38,290
Yeah, yeah.

3535
04:13:38,910 --> 04:13:40,190
Oh, oh my gosh!

3536
04:13:42,470 --> 04:13:43,950
Come on, Gordon!

3537
04:13:44,430 --> 04:13:45,870
You told me to look out!

3538
04:13:46,850 --> 04:13:47,810
That's what I'm doing!

3539
04:13:49,090 --> 04:13:50,070
I'm trying!

3540
04:13:50,250 --> 04:13:50,810
Hold on!

3541
04:13:51,570 --> 04:13:53,850
Is there gonna be a boss fight on the roof?

3542
04:13:58,170 --> 04:14:00,990
Oh yeah, yeah, there will be.

3543
04:14:01,310 --> 04:14:03,730
Yeah, yeah, there's a boss fight on the roof.

3544
04:14:04,710 --> 04:14:06,850
There's a boss fight on the roof.

3545
04:14:09,550 --> 04:14:26,710

04:15:16,600 --> 04:15:18,120
You ran in front of me!

3550
04:15:18,780 --> 04:15:19,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3551
04:15:21,960 --> 04:15:22,660
Oh, I see it.

3552
04:15:23,980 --> 04:15:24,280
Hmm.

3553
04:15:28,740 --> 04:15:29,220
Uh...

3554
04:15:29,220 --> 04:15:31,700
How can I get the...

3555
04:15:34,600 --> 04:15:36,040
I think I gotta be fast.

3556
04:15:37,840 --> 04:15:38,060
Ow!

3557
04:15:38,540 --> 04:15:39,480
I'm not very fast.

3558
04:15:53,870 --> 04:15:55,850
I saw their shadows coming down.

3559
04:15:56,450 --> 04:15:57,030
That was neat.

3560
04:15:57,090 --> 04:15:58,310
Here, catch yourself up.

3561
04:16:12,360 --> 04:16:14,080
I guess this is...

3562
04:16:16,280 --> 04:16:19,160
They gave me a crossbow, but they also gave me this.

3563
04:16:24,060 --> 04:16:25,060
Oh, not yet.

3564
04:16:25,280 --> 04:16:25,560
Not yet.

3565
04:16:32,920 --> 04:16:34,360
Got too ahead of myself.

3566
04:16:36,000 --> 04:16:36,500
A bit.

3567
04:16:37,400 --> 04:16:39,820
I was reloading.

3568
04:16:39,900 --> 04:16:40,440
You cover me.

3569
04:16:46,740 --> 04:16:48,920
Oh, oh, that really sucked.

3570
04:16:50,220 --> 04:16:51,840
That was not good.

3571
04:17:21,580 --> 04:17:23,240
What are you doing standing in the corner?

3572
04:17:24,820 --> 04:17:25,800
Me too though.

3573
04:17:26,060 --> 04:17:27,400
I'm also scared.

3574
04:17:48,250 --> 04:17:49,590
Where's the rocket at?

3575
04:18:08,430 --> 04:18:09,550
Rocket's at the start?

3576
04:18:09,830 --> 04:18:10,110
Oh, thank you.

3577
04:18:10,150 --> 04:18:10,950
Ah, I see, I see.

3578
04:18:12,290 --> 04:18:12,670
Thank

3579
04:18:38,230 --> 04:18:38,490
you!

3580
04:18:39,350 --> 04:18:40,910
Got it, but they're still shooting.

3581
04:18:43,270 --> 04:18:46,690
I lost everybody Oh my goodness

3582
04:18:56,380 --> 04:19:03,340
Why not because I have them now Oh I don't think that worked

3583
04:19:09,240 --> 04:19:24,900
Maybe this is why The crossbow is going Another Another Oh, I got him.

3584
04:19:25,320 --> 04:19:25,720
Somehow.

3585
04:19:29,300 --> 04:19:32,700
I'm actually not sure where to go, so I'm, like, kind of running around.

3586
04:19:33,600 --> 04:19:34,340
A little bit.

3587
04:20:13,760 --> 04:20:14,960
I'm a little scared.

3588
04:20:18,710 --> 04:20:19,350
Is that a guy?

3589
04:20:20,090 --> 04:20:21,530
Oh, no, this is the drop bridge, right?

3590
04:20:22,170 --> 04:20:22,930
That's what's open.

3591
04:20:26,610 --> 04:20:27,710
The sky bridge?

3592
04:20:32,190 --> 04:20:32,670
Nice.

3593
04:20:34,490 --> 04:20:36,070
Oh, I have more people!

3594
04:20:36,690 --> 04:20:37,670
Where did you go from?

3595
04:20:46,640 --> 04:20:47,840
The squad!

3596
04:20:49,240 --> 04:20:49,500
Thank

3597
04:21:22,170 --> 04:21:22,290
you.

3598
04:21:23,590 --> 04:21:24,810
We tanked it?

3599
04:21:25,030 --> 04:21:25,870
Reload, Dr. Freeman.

3600
04:21:26,170 --> 04:21:26,410
Alright.

3601
04:21:31,250 --> 04:21:33,130
Don't worry about the guys downstairs.

3602
04:21:33,330 --> 04:21:33,690
You're fine.

3603
04:21:35,570 --> 04:21:36,390
Holy moly.

3604
04:21:40,180 --> 04:21:40,900
Fantastic.

3605
04:21:43,480 --> 04:21:45,660
Oh, it's quiet.

3606
04:21:47,700 --> 04:21:49,900
It's Bito, let's follow her!

3607
04:21:51,740 --> 04:21:52,700
Leroy, Binky!

3608
04:21:57,660 --> 04:22:00,480
Is your middle name Rambo?

3609
04:22:04,280 --> 04:22:05,620
What can I say?

3610
04:22:06,460 --> 04:22:07,540
I'm not dead.

3611
04:22:08,240 --> 04:22:08,780
In the game.

3612
04:22:11,420 --> 04:22:13,400
You wanna know how I became a ghost.

3613
04:22:22,740 --> 04:22:24,400
Did you shut off the suppressor and open the gate?

3614
04:22:24,420 --> 04:22:25,600
Make this medicine.

3615
04:22:25,760 --> 04:22:26,300
Thank you.

3616
04:22:29,760 --> 04:22:41,740
squeeze we drop the crate of rockets coming across the plaza if you can make it there you should have everything you need to take down these striders follow Freeman follow Freeman

3617
04:22:49,260 --> 04:22:57,580

3618
04:23:05,780 --> 04:23:07,480
Okay, so where am I going?

3619
04:24:04,820 --> 04:24:06,840
Striders are seven hits on easy.

3620
04:24:07,000 --> 04:24:07,160
Wait.

3621
04:24:07,960 --> 04:24:08,920
Oh, I'm here.

3622
04:24:09,040 --> 04:24:09,540
Oh, my gosh.

3623
04:24:36,030 --> 04:24:40,610
It's so loud, and this is not a good spot that it, like, loads me at.

3624
04:24:47,810 --> 04:24:48,210
Ouch.

3625
04:24:51,330 --> 04:24:52,570
Oh, my gosh.

3626
04:24:53,670 --> 04:24:55,350
I'm trying to get to the sewer tube.

3627
04:24:55,510 --> 04:24:56,490
I'm just going to run for it.

3628
04:25:01,970 --> 04:25:02,390
Holy!

3629
04:25:03,750 --> 04:25:07,690
Okay, maybe if I stay here for a second, they won't notice me and then I can run.

3630
04:25:41,020 --> 04:25:42,540
Where is it?

3631
04:25:45,980 --> 04:25:47,660
Oh no, oh I did hit him!

3632
04:25:47,940 --> 04:25:47,940
Phew!

3633
04:25:48,520 --> 04:25:48,940
Oh,

3634
04:25:55,580 --> 04:25:56,460
and now he's gone.

3635
04:25:56,820 --> 04:25:57,300
Oh no.

3636
04:25:59,300 --> 04:26:01,640
But I still don't know where the rocket box is.

3637
04:26:23,550 --> 04:26:24,350
Push forward?

3638
04:26:25,930 --> 04:26:26,530
Like in here?

3639
04:26:27,250 --> 04:26:28,110
Wait, what do you guys mean?

3640
04:26:28,270 --> 04:26:28,750
Push forward.

3641
04:26:47,490 --> 04:26:48,430
Across the plaza.

3642
04:26:51,350 --> 04:26:52,270
Gotta go deeper.

3643
04:26:52,470 --> 04:26:53,250
Okay, I'm gonna save.

3644
04:26:57,290 --> 04:26:57,690
Deeper.

3645
04:27:07,730 --> 04:27:08,690
Okay, I got three.

3646
04:27:09,250 --> 04:27:10,270
Wait, is this a turn?

3647
04:27:11,350 --> 04:27:12,190
No way.

3648
04:27:13,170 --> 04:27:14,290
Are there guys here now too?

3649
04:27:39,320 --> 04:27:40,300
Unfortunately, no.

3650
04:27:40,520 --> 04:27:41,440
Oh, it's gone already.

3651
04:27:46,950 --> 04:27:48,830
Oh my gosh, how many are there?

3652
04:27:51,010 --> 04:27:52,370
How many striders are there?

3653
04:28:06,170 --> 04:28:07,630
Two, it looked like three to me.

3654
04:28:09,950 --> 04:28:11,430
I'll believe you guys.

3655
04:28:13,730 --> 04:28:14,490
Oh, that sucks.

3656
04:28:15,370 --> 04:28:16,530
Oh, that really sucks.

3657
04:28:21,900 --> 04:28:22,780
He ducked.

3658
04:28:22,820 --> 04:28:25,140
Yeah, I tried to get him, but he ducked.

3659
04:28:25,940 --> 04:28:26,780
Look at it.

3660
04:28:29,120 --> 04:28:30,520
Will anything else hurt them?

3661
04:28:31,580 --> 04:28:33,200
Or is it just...

3662
04:28:33,200 --> 04:28:33,920
I mean, I saved.

3663
04:28:37,540 --> 04:28:38,280
Oh, well.

3664
04:28:38,620 --> 04:28:39,240
It's kind of trouble.

3665
04:28:48,620 --> 04:28:54,900

3666
04:28:58,120 --> 04:29:00,520

3668
04:29:46,710 --> 04:29:49,010
I don't remember where I saved.

3669
04:29:52,370 --> 04:29:54,150
I'll just hold the grenades.

3670
04:30:06,990 --> 04:30:08,030
That was so bad.

3671
04:30:09,990 --> 04:30:11,490
That was so bad.

3672
04:30:11,750 --> 04:30:15,490
Okay, I think this was right before I left, so...

3673
04:30:15,490 --> 04:30:16,810
You're going the wrong way!

3674
04:30:16,930 --> 04:30:17,570
What do you mean?

3675
04:30:17,650 --> 04:30:18,530
You said the center!

3676
04:30:18,710 --> 04:30:20,370
Is this not the center right here?

3677
04:30:22,870 --> 04:30:24,310
Do I need to go this way?

3678
04:30:32,520 --> 04:30:32,820
Huh?

3679
04:30:33,780 --> 04:30:34,220
LRB?

3680
04:30:34,440 --> 04:30:34,560
G?

3681
04:30:34,700 --> 04:30:34,860
No?

3682
04:30:40,440 --> 04:30:41,660
Straightforward is the center.

3683
04:30:42,760 --> 04:30:45,420
And I'm so confused what you guys are...

3684
04:30:49,840 --> 04:30:51,300
Oh my gosh!

3685
04:31:04,330 --> 04:31:06,830
Don't jump at the pit, I'm not trying to!

3686
04:31:06,890 --> 04:31:08,110
I'm trying to get to the pit!

3687
04:31:08,130 --> 04:31:08,510
What the?

3688
04:31:11,790 --> 04:31:15,390
Yeah, that guy is like kind of smoking, though.

3689
04:31:15,710 --> 04:31:16,650
Maybe we hit this guy.

3690
04:31:16,830 --> 04:31:17,630
Like, he's kind of...

3691
04:31:21,250 --> 04:31:22,970
I think we'll be able to get him.

3692
04:31:23,170 --> 04:31:24,450
Maybe there's something over here.

3693
04:31:24,970 --> 04:31:26,030
If I'm lucky, no.

3694
04:31:40,610 --> 04:31:41,570
Go straight.

3695
04:31:42,670 --> 04:31:43,050
Okay.

3696
04:31:43,790 --> 04:31:44,610
I will try.

3697
04:31:46,630 --> 04:31:46,890
Oh

3698
04:31:59,880 --> 04:32:00,540
my god, no!

3699
04:32:01,620 --> 04:32:02,100
Tivo!

3700
04:32:11,520 --> 04:32:12,880
Oh, that's messed up.

3701
04:32:15,400 --> 04:32:16,840
I just got here.

3702
04:32:22,980 --> 04:32:25,140
I think he's aggroed a little bit.

3703
04:32:38,870 --> 04:32:39,850
I think that was one down.

3704
04:32:44,320 --> 04:32:44,480
Okay.

3705
04:32:45,600 --> 04:32:48,600
It's always better to focus on one and then go to the next, you know?

3706
04:32:56,600 --> 04:32:57,080
Yippee!

3707
04:32:59,180 --> 04:32:59,860
That's it?

3708
04:33:07,740 --> 04:33:08,880
I told you there were three.

3709
04:33:09,060 --> 04:33:10,120
I told you there were three.

3710
04:33:18,930 --> 04:33:20,210
My health is at 10.

3711
04:33:29,110 --> 04:33:30,950
I need to be able to get back into the base.

3712
04:33:35,100 --> 04:33:37,800
I need to be able to get back into that little crevice.

3713
04:33:43,020 --> 04:33:44,200
Uh, I did save.

3714
04:33:44,460 --> 04:33:45,120
I did save.

3715
04:33:45,980 --> 04:33:48,600
Okay, but now we know one comes from over here.

3716
04:33:49,300 --> 04:33:52,080
So we run, run, run, run, run, as fast as we can.

3717
04:34:14,630 --> 04:34:16,590
Okay, so we're trying to get to the room?

3718
04:34:23,980 --> 04:34:25,120
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3719
04:34:26,820 --> 04:34:31,230
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

3720
04:34:39,700 --> 04:34:41,560
I didn't know if he noticed me.

3721
04:34:41,860 --> 04:34:43,440
He did definitely notice me.

3722
04:34:46,100 --> 04:34:46,940
He knows I'm here.

3723
04:34:47,780 --> 04:34:48,400
He's camping.

3724
04:35:00,570 --> 04:35:02,150
Okay, okay, okay.

3725
04:35:02,490 --> 04:35:09,130
okay so we're going to somewhere unknown

3726
04:35:13,950 --> 04:35:40,860
oh is there another one oh my gosh no way wait i'm so confused actually now okay so those are those will just keep coming but now i need to get to somewhere i need to go to a direction.

3727
04:35:41,080 --> 04:35:41,360
What?

3728
04:35:45,180 --> 04:35:46,920
I need to leave the area.

3729
04:35:47,460 --> 04:35:48,620
Yeah, but which way?

3730
04:35:49,600 --> 04:35:50,900
Do I need to go over that way?

3731
04:36:01,580 --> 04:36:02,760
Other side of the bunker.

3732
04:36:03,000 --> 04:36:03,360
Okay, okay.

3733
04:36:04,220 --> 04:36:04,960
Aw, man.

3734
04:36:07,820 --> 04:36:09,340
I wish another guy hadn't...

3735
04:36:09,340 --> 04:36:10,300
Oh, whoopsie.

3736
04:36:11,480 --> 04:36:13,160
I wish another guy hadn't spawned.

3737
04:36:16,160 --> 04:36:18,640
Yeah, I know I need to try over there, right?

3738
04:36:20,140 --> 04:36:21,280
I'm just trying to die.

3739
04:36:21,840 --> 04:36:22,980
Die to this guy!

3740
04:36:23,220 --> 04:36:24,240
Oh my gosh.

3741
04:36:36,780 --> 04:36:39,800
In the direction you came from at the start of the chapter.

3742
04:36:45,290 --> 04:36:48,450
I- Oh, gosh.

3743
04:36:50,170 --> 04:36:50,950
Oh, no way.

3744
04:36:58,140 --> 04:37:00,180
Hi, I'm so sorry for you.

3745
04:37:06,840 --> 04:37:08,900
Are there two of them now?

3746
04:37:10,800 --> 04:37:13,100
This might not be a great place to...

3747
04:37:19,620 --> 04:37:20,620
Oh, you're a friend.

3748
04:37:26,730 --> 04:37:28,190
I'm trying to get in!

3749
04:37:37,150 --> 04:37:37,690
Ouch!

3750
04:37:38,770 --> 04:37:39,770
Wait, um...

3751
04:37:39,770 --> 04:37:40,610
I'm lost!

3752
04:37:40,730 --> 04:37:42,150
I'm last!

3753
04:37:44,050 --> 04:37:46,570
Because you need to blow up that.

3754
04:37:46,990 --> 04:37:47,270
Huh?

3755
04:37:49,090 --> 04:37:50,550
Spy crate not helping.

3756
04:37:51,350 --> 04:37:52,950
Okay, so this opened up for me?

3757
04:37:53,330 --> 04:37:54,010
Yeah, uh-oh.

3758
04:37:54,350 --> 04:37:54,970
Uh-oh, what?

3759
04:37:55,410 --> 04:37:57,070
Why is this part so confusing?

3760
04:37:57,850 --> 04:37:58,350
Why?

3761
04:37:59,610 --> 04:38:01,030
Why am I not...

3762
04:38:01,030 --> 04:38:02,730
Why do I not know what to do at all?

3763
04:38:13,770 --> 04:38:15,970
Kill the Striders, but won't they come back again?

3764
04:38:16,110 --> 04:38:19,790
Or these ones, because I'm finally progressing, they won't.

3765
04:38:37,540 --> 04:38:38,720
They actually are?

3766
04:38:43,120 --> 04:38:43,640
Ow!

3767
04:38:44,100 --> 04:38:44,300
Ow!

3768
04:38:44,500 --> 04:38:44,600
Ow!

3769
04:38:44,880 --> 04:38:44,980
Ow!

3770
04:38:45,340 --> 04:38:45,640
Oh,

3771
04:39:04,480 --> 04:39:05,240
this part's brutal.

3772
04:39:05,540 --> 04:39:06,580
This part's really hard.

3773
04:39:09,260 --> 04:39:11,400
Why do I start with my...

3774
04:39:13,100 --> 04:39:14,140
Cobra Blar.

3775
04:39:22,840 --> 04:39:24,900
Last time he was like, wait for me!

3776
04:39:25,480 --> 04:39:27,040
This time he didn't make it.

3777
04:39:27,360 --> 04:39:28,040
So sad.

3778
04:39:29,260 --> 04:39:31,600
So if they are finite, I will take care of...

3779
04:39:31,600 --> 04:39:33,480
I will work on taking them down.

3780
04:39:34,760 --> 04:39:35,160
I suppose.

3781
04:39:52,060 --> 04:39:52,960
Oh my goodness.

3782
04:39:56,400 --> 04:39:57,500
Oh my goodness.

3783
04:39:58,760 --> 04:40:00,360
This part's a little stressful.

3784
04:40:01,040 --> 04:40:01,440
Wow.

3785
04:40:01,880 --> 04:40:02,360
Wow.

3786
04:40:05,240 --> 04:40:07,160
It's part a little bit stressful.

3787
04:40:32,230 --> 04:40:35,670
He got me and I got him at the same time.

3788
04:40:39,330 --> 04:40:41,430
I need to kill them for my own sanity.

3789
04:40:41,870 --> 04:40:43,270
I don't care if I don't have to.

3790
04:40:43,850 --> 04:40:45,510
I need to kill them for my own sanity.

3791
04:40:48,370 --> 04:40:50,070
They're stressing me hell out.

3792
04:40:51,970 --> 04:40:53,350
Because I don't know where to go.

3793
04:40:53,730 --> 04:40:58,310
They're stressing me out because I'm lost and also getting attacked!

3794
04:40:59,810 --> 04:41:01,310
Wait, did I not shoot that?

3795
04:41:06,310 --> 04:41:08,990
I think I got hit and I didn't even shoot that rocket.

3796
04:41:09,910 --> 04:41:11,710
Unless he shot it down, I'm not sure.

3797
04:41:17,870 --> 04:41:19,670
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3798
04:41:22,410 --> 04:41:23,930
I don't like this.

3799
04:41:23,990 --> 04:41:25,290
I don't like this at all.

3800
04:41:27,430 --> 04:41:28,670
I don't like it.

3801
04:41:31,370 --> 04:41:32,910
I'm so stressed.

3802
04:41:39,480 --> 04:41:40,260
Did I get him?

3803
04:41:51,920 --> 04:41:52,400
Okay.

3804
04:41:53,620 --> 04:41:54,240
Okay, please.

3805
04:41:54,720 --> 04:41:55,820
Now where do I go?

3806
04:41:56,540 --> 04:42:02,300
Okay, some people said follow the road, so I will try that, but there's guys shooting at me here too.

3807
04:42:04,900 --> 04:42:06,000
Actually, I'm just gonna save.

3808
04:42:06,120 --> 04:42:07,440
I don't care if my health is so low.

3809
04:42:11,620 --> 04:42:12,100
Okay.

3810
04:42:12,260 --> 04:42:13,100
Ah!

3811
04:42:14,660 --> 04:42:15,180
Okay.

3812
04:42:17,000 --> 04:42:19,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3813
04:42:20,980 --> 04:42:21,260
Okay, okay, okay.

3814
04:42:22,100 --> 04:42:22,260
Okay.

3815
04:42:22,260 --> 04:42:23,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3816
04:42:36,250 --> 04:42:37,010
Okay.

3817
04:42:45,280 --> 04:42:48,880
Gosh, I really wish there were, uh, what's it called here.

3818
04:42:49,620 --> 04:42:52,260
A, um...

3819
04:42:52,260 --> 04:42:53,180
A sniper?

3820
04:42:53,720 --> 04:42:55,200
A sniper?

3821
04:42:57,160 --> 04:42:58,040
I'm not doing

3822
04:43:09,590 --> 04:43:09,890
it.

3823
04:43:10,130 --> 04:43:11,130
Yeah, it's not good.

3824
04:43:15,070 --> 04:43:17,110
You can rocket them?

3825
04:43:17,570 --> 04:43:21,570
I guess that would be, you know, a pretty fun...

3826
04:43:21,570 --> 04:43:22,450
Let's try it.

3827
04:43:27,890 --> 04:43:28,230
Oops.

3828
04:43:29,170 --> 04:43:31,590
Why is there, like, no splash damage on this thing?

3829
04:43:35,290 --> 04:43:37,950
I tried crossbowing earlier, but...

3830
04:43:42,610 --> 04:43:43,570
That's why.

3831
04:43:43,850 --> 04:43:45,230
That's why I haven't been using it.

3832
04:43:46,110 --> 04:43:46,470
Ah!

3833
04:43:52,990 --> 04:43:54,890
Yeah, they dodge like crazy.

3834
04:43:56,990 --> 04:43:57,850
Did I get hit again?

3835
04:43:58,310 --> 04:43:59,290
This is empty, right?

3836
04:44:00,090 --> 04:44:00,730
Unfortunately.

3837
04:44:02,570 --> 04:44:03,170
Unfortunately!

3838
04:44:06,070 --> 04:44:07,950
It was so close.

3839
04:44:11,210 --> 04:44:13,890
I feel like crossbow is my only answer.

3840
04:44:28,400 --> 04:44:30,520
There is health over there.

3841
04:44:36,480 --> 04:44:38,280
Okay, maybe it's clear.

3842
04:44:39,240 --> 04:44:41,240
I'm gonna hard save instead of a...

3843
04:44:42,660 --> 04:44:44,200
Instead of the quick save.

3844
04:44:47,540 --> 04:44:49,220
I do see health.

3845
04:44:52,960 --> 04:44:54,640
I wish I saw more health.

3846
04:44:58,540 --> 04:45:00,520
What are you guys doing?

3847
04:45:12,640 --> 04:45:15,580
What are you guys doing?

3848
04:45:17,260 --> 04:45:18,420
2 HP in a dream.

3849
04:45:21,420 --> 04:45:23,040
Now 22 HP in a dream.

3850
04:45:24,120 --> 04:45:25,000
Is there anything in here?

3851
04:45:25,680 --> 04:45:27,140
No, just...

3852
04:45:27,920 --> 04:45:29,060
Just their little thingy.

3853
04:45:29,280 --> 04:45:29,600
Okay.

3854
04:45:33,660 --> 04:45:35,300
So we have to go down?

3855
04:45:36,140 --> 04:45:37,960
Is this all supplies?

3856
04:45:45,730 --> 04:45:46,690
Yippee!

3857
04:45:47,330 --> 04:45:47,710
Oh,

3858
04:45:54,360 --> 04:45:55,920
yes, baby!

3859
04:45:59,990 --> 04:46:01,650
I'm gonna hate this, aren't I?

3860
04:46:02,430 --> 04:46:07,270
I saw you.

3861
04:46:24,340 --> 04:46:25,820
Anything over here?

3862
04:46:26,060 --> 04:46:26,240
No?

3863
04:46:27,500 --> 04:46:28,120
Okie dokie.

3864
04:46:30,900 --> 04:46:32,860
from here.

3865
04:46:34,660 --> 04:46:35,500
In what sense?

3866
04:47:01,030 --> 04:47:03,410
Okay, I think we just gotta run.

3867
04:47:03,930 --> 04:47:03,930
Okay.

3868
04:47:11,770 --> 04:47:12,750
Just run.

3869
04:47:26,260 --> 04:47:31,060
Are you gonna compose I'm gonna make it.

3870
04:47:34,580 --> 04:47:36,000
Run until you find a crate.

3871
04:47:37,200 --> 04:47:37,300
Okay.

3872
04:47:39,060 --> 04:47:39,420
Alright.

3873
04:47:40,780 --> 04:47:43,280
Like, do I need ox power running?

3874
04:47:43,480 --> 04:47:45,660
Or are we, like, regular running?

3875
04:47:46,660 --> 04:47:47,540
Like, is this good?

3876
04:47:47,820 --> 04:47:52,040
I don't think it would be, but...

3877
04:47:54,180 --> 04:47:55,140
Ox power.

3878
04:47:55,960 --> 04:47:56,280
Okay.

3879
04:47:56,840 --> 04:47:59,440
Once I hear the crash, I'll start running.

3880
04:48:03,620 --> 04:48:05,140
Maximum Velocity.

3881
04:48:07,560 --> 04:48:08,320
Oh,

3882
04:48:26,460 --> 04:48:27,640
I passed it.

3883
04:48:30,000 --> 04:48:30,760
Too far?

3884
04:48:34,300 --> 04:48:36,240
There was an entrance on the left.

3885
04:48:37,900 --> 04:48:42,720
I don't

3886
04:48:49,170 --> 04:48:49,410
know what y'all?

3887
04:48:51,170 --> 04:48:52,270
What is that?

3888
04:48:57,900 --> 04:48:58,660
Combo's in here?

3889
04:48:58,760 --> 04:48:59,340
What is this thing?

3890
04:48:59,360 --> 04:49:04,670
What is this?

3891
04:49:27,670 --> 04:49:29,630
I should have killed the camera.

3892
04:49:29,970 --> 04:49:30,910
What's wrong with me?

3893
04:49:33,770 --> 04:49:34,490
Oh,

3894
04:49:39,530 --> 04:49:39,890
well.

3895
04:49:46,430 --> 04:49:48,230
We do a little bit of training here, yeah.

3896
04:49:48,910 --> 04:49:52,950
Don't run.

3897
04:50:07,260 --> 04:50:08,380
Don't do it.

3898
04:50:12,070 --> 04:50:12,790
Anything.

3899
04:50:45,810 --> 04:50:47,330
Oh my gosh.

3900
04:50:47,550 --> 04:50:49,890
Stop it.

3901
04:50:51,690 --> 04:50:52,950
Oh no, is that a buddy?

3902
04:51:07,620 --> 04:51:08,760
Oh my gosh.

3903
04:51:10,020 --> 04:51:11,520
Save, I just did.

3904
04:51:14,160 --> 04:51:15,220
Oh, I didn't realize.

3905
04:51:15,340 --> 04:51:17,100
I thought this was...

3906
04:51:17,100 --> 04:51:18,420
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3907
04:51:19,800 --> 04:51:20,960
We take what we can get?

3908
04:51:22,480 --> 04:51:22,700
Oh!

3909
04:51:24,220 --> 04:51:24,980
Oh my gosh.

3910
04:51:25,000 --> 04:51:25,800
Gosh!

3911
04:51:36,430 --> 04:51:38,590
To my eyes!

3912
04:51:39,730 --> 04:51:40,290
All right.

3913
04:51:45,700 --> 04:51:46,460
Go away!

3914
04:51:47,400 --> 04:51:47,980
Please!

3915
04:51:48,920 --> 04:51:50,400
I don't want to get stick bugged!

3916
04:51:54,240 --> 04:51:59,670
I don't want to get stick bugged!

3917
04:52:01,700 --> 04:52:03,430
I think I have to go up this, no?

3918
04:52:13,330 --> 04:52:14,450
I can't even see it.

3919
04:52:25,550 --> 04:52:26,210
Okay.

3920
04:52:28,510 --> 04:52:30,590
Alright, this is pretty good standing, I'd say.

3921
04:52:31,810 --> 04:52:32,890
Not so bad.

3922
04:52:36,690 --> 04:52:38,190
I did save, right?

3923
04:52:39,470 --> 04:52:40,070
Saving?

3924
04:52:40,310 --> 04:52:40,810
Okay, good.

3925
04:52:47,740 --> 04:52:48,840
This is evil.

3926
04:52:49,300 --> 04:52:50,040
Absolute evil.

3927
04:52:53,140 --> 04:52:54,380
Okay, understood.

3928
04:52:54,900 --> 04:52:56,000
What do I need to do?

3929
04:52:56,080 --> 04:52:56,440
Ow!

3930
04:52:56,920 --> 04:52:57,740
Oh my god!

3931
04:53:01,740 --> 04:53:03,700
This is where we found Barney.

3932
04:53:04,680 --> 04:53:05,360
Man, I'm stuck.

3933
04:53:05,640 --> 04:53:06,560
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

3934
04:53:09,460 --> 04:53:10,600
Okay, there's health down here.

3935
04:53:10,760 --> 04:53:12,280
There's quite a bit of health around here.

3936
04:53:16,740 --> 04:53:18,100
Where was the jerk?

3937
04:53:18,200 --> 04:53:18,800
There he is.

3938
04:53:19,440 --> 04:53:21,360
The jerk that tried shooting me.

3939
04:53:23,980 --> 04:53:25,160
Stop, please!

3940
04:53:27,460 --> 04:53:30,140
These guys are the worst things in existence.

3941
04:53:32,180 --> 04:53:33,820
Please, my god!

3942
04:53:38,970 --> 04:53:41,270
Get this guy.

3943
04:53:42,990 --> 04:53:43,490
Oh, shoot.

3944
04:53:45,810 --> 04:53:47,190
Okay, I at least got him.

3945
04:53:49,790 --> 04:53:51,530
Oh, no, no, no.

3946
04:54:01,290 --> 04:54:03,470
I need them to not be aggroed on me anymore.

3947
04:54:07,870 --> 04:54:09,130
Standing next to the barrels?

3948
04:54:13,070 --> 04:54:13,590
Me?

3949
04:54:14,010 --> 04:54:16,330
Oh, like saying, oh, you're standing next to the barrels.

3950
04:54:16,530 --> 04:54:17,750
If he hits you, you're gonna die.

3951
04:54:30,080 --> 04:54:31,320
We'll see what happens.

3952
04:54:33,460 --> 04:54:36,280
Are those my friends or please be friends?

3953
04:54:36,760 --> 04:54:38,380
Oh, there's barrels right there.

3954
04:54:38,560 --> 04:54:40,500
Oh, he was standing next to the barrel.

3955
04:54:41,960 --> 04:54:42,320
Okay.

3956
04:55:10,190 --> 04:55:10,710
Maybe.

3957
04:55:11,990 --> 04:55:12,510
I

3958
04:55:30,580 --> 04:55:31,580
kind of want to.

3959
04:55:31,740 --> 04:55:32,360
He's annoying.

3960
04:55:38,500 --> 04:55:40,560
It's quite annoying me.

3961
04:55:41,440 --> 04:55:42,520
Now I'm taller.

3962
04:55:45,500 --> 04:55:46,520
Oh my gosh.

3963
04:55:48,740 --> 04:55:50,700
If I leave, will these guys go away too?

3964
04:55:50,880 --> 04:55:51,880
If I go to the next part?

3965
04:55:53,040 --> 04:55:55,080
If I don't destroy the thing?

3966
04:55:56,840 --> 04:55:57,380
Oh, sorry.

3967
04:55:57,660 --> 04:55:58,960
Oh, I'm not sorry, actually.

3968
04:56:01,100 --> 04:56:02,460
Okay, I'm just gonna go then.

3969
04:56:03,240 --> 04:56:03,260
Oh!

3970
04:56:12,530 --> 04:56:13,310
Vicky, my show.

3971
04:56:14,530 --> 04:56:15,370
Nope, I hear it.

3972
04:56:15,490 --> 04:56:22,050
i hear it i hear it wait is it gone

3973
04:56:32,710 --> 04:56:57,150
it's a mess out there yeah i know this close to the citadel they've turned the streets over to striders i think we can push them back and we can just get to high ground okay almost to the citadel wall doc i don't know how the hell we're gonna breach it but you've made it this far i don't know don't make me don't make me say Hi!

3974
04:57:03,160 --> 04:57:05,400
You're a super smart scientist!

3975
04:57:07,160 --> 04:57:08,060
I think though guys...

3976
04:57:08,060 --> 04:57:09,480
Oh my gosh, I just realized the time.

3977
04:57:09,900 --> 04:57:11,820
I think I'm gonna call it here, actually.

3978
04:57:13,400 --> 04:57:13,800
I know.

3979
04:57:14,960 --> 04:57:17,300
How many more chapters do I have left?

3980
04:57:17,700 --> 04:57:18,000
Three?

3981
04:57:18,860 --> 04:57:19,440
Three?

3982
04:57:20,340 --> 04:57:21,020
I think.

3983
04:57:25,370 --> 04:57:26,470
I don't remember.

3984
04:57:28,430 --> 04:57:30,330
There's like one hour left of the game?

3985
04:57:32,870 --> 04:57:36,010
Oh, wow, we made really great progress then.

3986
04:57:36,130 --> 04:57:36,870
One or two hours.

3987
04:57:37,090 --> 04:57:39,110
That's enough for one more stream.

3988
04:57:39,710 --> 04:57:40,190
Yippee!

3989
04:57:45,770 --> 04:57:48,410
And even if it's a little longer, that's okay, too.

3990
04:57:49,550 --> 04:57:51,250
We will finish next week then.

3991
04:57:52,350 --> 04:57:52,830
Woohoo!

3992
04:57:54,030 --> 04:57:55,290
Wait, I did save, right?

3993
04:57:55,410 --> 04:57:56,390
And then I'll hard save.

3994
04:58:00,030 --> 04:58:00,510
Yeah.

3995
04:58:01,450 --> 04:58:03,670
Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff.

3996
04:58:05,950 --> 04:58:06,370
Yay!

3997
04:58:07,070 --> 04:58:08,370
We're so close then.

3998
04:58:08,930 --> 04:58:09,610
We're almost there.

3999
04:58:09,730 --> 04:58:11,590
Thank you guys for all your help.

4000
04:58:11,770 --> 04:58:12,730
I know I missed stuff.

4001
04:58:13,330 --> 04:58:17,590
And, um, but I appreciate you guys trying to, trying to direct me.

4002
04:58:17,970 --> 04:58:18,550
Hot dog!

4003
04:58:19,190 --> 04:58:21,610
I was just about to send you this to check in about the time.

4004
04:58:23,190 --> 04:58:24,130
Thank you, Duago.

4005
04:58:24,910 --> 04:58:30,670
No, I, uh, um, I was having fun, actually, even if it's a little stressful.

4006
04:58:31,870 --> 04:58:34,510
That's why I lost track of the time.

4007
04:58:36,450 --> 04:58:37,510
But I gotta be up early.

4008
04:58:37,730 --> 04:58:43,650
I gotta be energized for meet and greets tomorrow.

4009
04:58:46,170 --> 04:58:49,550
And then after my meet and greets, I want to play...

4010
04:58:50,830 --> 04:58:53,770
I want to play Delta, but...

4011
04:58:54,890 --> 04:58:58,970
I played kind of long today, though I want to play kind of long tomorrow.

4012
04:59:02,590 --> 04:59:04,830
If not tomorrow, then Sunday.

4013
04:59:09,110 --> 04:59:12,150
I'm on like the last hurdle of my cold.

4014
04:59:14,050 --> 04:59:20,270
Where I'm like still kind of, I don't feel so bad, but I'm still like all stuffed up and that sometimes gives me a headache.

4015
04:59:22,370 --> 04:59:27,910
You know, so I'm like on the last little bit, like just a little bit more rest, I'll be okay.

4016
04:59:31,310 --> 04:59:39,670
Either tomorrow or Sunday, I'll play more Delta because I want to just play as much as I can.

4017
04:59:42,430 --> 04:59:45,170
Takizawa, thank you.

4018
04:59:46,590 --> 04:59:49,510
So I probably will stream tomorrow regardless.

4019
04:59:50,610 --> 04:59:52,710
Just deciding what I want to do.

4020
04:59:52,890 --> 04:59:53,810
If I'm, yeah.

4021
04:59:55,230 --> 04:59:56,150
Thank you for the stream.

4022
04:59:56,290 --> 04:59:57,770
Oh my God, thank you so much for the pink.

4023
04:59:58,530 --> 05:00:00,770
Listen more to your voice for fantastic reality.

4024
05:00:00,970 --> 05:00:01,630
You sound really good.

4025
05:00:01,890 --> 05:00:03,490
Given the things you have to push, throughout the time.

4026
05:00:03,650 --> 05:00:04,470
I'm an extra awe.

4027
05:00:05,950 --> 05:00:06,710
Thank you.

4028
05:00:08,130 --> 05:00:09,090
Thank you.

4029
05:00:09,390 --> 05:00:10,410
Resting glitch face.

4030
05:00:10,510 --> 05:00:11,490
Thank you for the vibe, Genta.

4031
05:00:11,570 --> 05:00:12,190
