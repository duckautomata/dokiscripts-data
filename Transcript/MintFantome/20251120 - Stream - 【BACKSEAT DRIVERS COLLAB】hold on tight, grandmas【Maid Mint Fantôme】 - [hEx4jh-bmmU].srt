00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Happy duty!

2
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,580
Happy duty!

3
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Thank you so much for the Tony Captain!

4
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,300
Thank you!

5
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,680
Thank you!

6
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,560
Wow, it's been so long since I last streamed!

7
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,020
Definitely for me it was not...

8
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,960
20 minutes ago!

9
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,040
Not at all!

10
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,720
I totally didn't get changed in that time.

11
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,880
Not at all!

12
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,300
We missed you!

13
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,820
Wow.

14
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,660
You guys are too much.

15
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Hishashiburi!

16
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,080
You missed me?

17
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
You missed me!

18
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,940
Today is a collab!

19
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,300
So, it'll be me.

20
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm going in order of people on the thumbnail.

21
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,740
Oymo!

22
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,960
Mogu!

23
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,700
Dust go.

24
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
They are... they are...

25
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Wait, hold on.

26
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm gonna click out of the game and it's gonna stop the
music.

27
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,400
They are in Discord right now, so I should probably join.

28
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,740
I should probably stop being a little introvert and talking
to you guys.

29
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Are we there yet?

30
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,060
Are we there yet?

31
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,920
So I'm going to join them.

32
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Um, I'm coming.

33
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,210
I'm going to tell them and be like, Oh, let me, let me, let
me socializing.

34
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,110
Whoa, yeah.

35
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,370
It's my first time collabing with everybody, but I've been
friends with everybody for quite a long time.

36
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:30,750
funny that it's our first time collabing like actually me
and Dusko like we hang out very not I wouldn't say often but

37
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,710
like if we're in the same place together we hang out
together so like I see her at many conventions and events

38
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:45,790
and we've gone to Disney together and stuff so two ghosts in
one stream I know!

39
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,110
And Vogue was a ghost we're extra haunted yeah yeah So,
yeah, I'm going to go, I'm going to join now.

40
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,090
Bye, everybody.

41
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,730
Oh, why did Oimo say no?

42
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,930
I don't think Oimo wants to collab with me.

43
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,390
I think she hates me.

44
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,110
I'm coming in anyway.

45
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,990
Oh, my God.

46
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,410
We should run.

47
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,590
Run, run, run, run.

48
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,030
Thank you, Aklaan, Mint Slime.

49
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,230
Me, howdy, Mint.

50
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,370
Me, howdy.

51
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,350
What's going on?

52
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,070
What's happening?

53
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,110
I think Oimo's about to pass away.

54
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,150
Can you resurrect her?

55
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,390
Can you give her mouth to mouth, please?

56
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,930
Why is she about to pass away?

57
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:32,550
Wait.

58
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,170
Because you walked in the room.

59
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,590
You just have to affect the people.

60
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,070
Oimo is not in the call.

61
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,090
She doesn't recognize my existence.

62
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,030
This is great.

63
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,730
She's going great.

64
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,330
It's going awesome.

65
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,050
This is already going so great.

66
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,470
She doesn't hear me.

67
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,970
I'm gonna...

68
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,910
No, I can hear you.

69
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,790
I can hear you.

70
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,090
Just why aren't you in the Discord?

71
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,390
Oh my gosh, is that Mogu wants to play with me?

72
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh my god, Carol!

73
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,270
Oh my god!

74
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,570
No!

75
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,590
Wait, the invite disappeared.

76
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,810
I didn't- Wait, you can change their skin color?

77
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,930
Wait, let me share my screen.

78
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,810
This is insane.

79
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,030
Oh wait, I can hear you in the game, huh?

80
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,930
down in the game.

81
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,510
I think so.

82
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,250
Send me another invite, please.

83
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,430
Wait, why can I...

84
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,190
Why can't I send it?

85
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,730
Dusty, you can use it in the invite.

86
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,250
Yeah, it'll work.

87
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,270
Oh.

88
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,690
It's like great outfit.

89
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:42,890
Why?

90
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,310
Why game hate me?

91
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,250
Does the audio doubled right now?

92
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,070
Yes.

93
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,190
Oh, it says that...

94
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,630
Are we gonna talk in the game?

95
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,410
It says she's in the game.

96
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,950
Do you want to talk in the game or do you want to talk in
the game?

97
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,650
talk here.

98
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,910
Talking real live.

99
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,550
Talking the game or talking real live.

100
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,910
Oh, my mic is... I can turn on push to talk or whatever.

101
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, give, give.

102
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,930
I just turned off the audio.

103
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,130
Oh, you guys want to be...

104
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,150
I'm going to be old.

105
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,710
I'm going to be an old dude.

106
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,530
Oh, my God.

107
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,070
This guy is shaking.

108
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,510
I've got Arthur right.

109
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,030
Uh-oh.

110
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,390
Sorry.

111
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,910
The invite is not working.

112
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,990
Wait, I'm going to quit the game and restart the game.

113
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,310
It says, yeah, because it says that you're in here.

114
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:22,950
It does?

115
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,830
Oh, does it?

116
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,370
Oh, maybe I should.

117
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:26,690
Oh, no.

118
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,470
And then now it's gone.

119
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,370
Okay, okay.

120
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:28,730
Okay.

121
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,370
Let me try.

122
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,330
Let me try.

123
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,330
Wait, hold up.

124
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,150
How did you guys switch your avatar?

125
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,710
I'm still listening.

126
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,490
I've always been.

127
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,750
It's like the left and right on the bottom of your
character.

128
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,730
Like the arrows.

129
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,530
The less than greater than.

130
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,490
You went to college.

131
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,690
Did I?

132
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,970
Did you?

133
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,570
Did I?

134
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,650
I did.

135
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,410
I certainly did.

136
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,650
There's in-game.

137
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,690
Let me actually, let me see if it's the game registered that
I bought.

138
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,290
Hold up.

139
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,490
I forgot to cover my screen.

140
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,410
Maybe it's me.

141
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,550
Maybe I'm gonna, should I leave?

142
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,510
Oh, it's...

143
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,710
Did I kick everyone out?

144
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,970
Yeah, I kicked everyone out.

145
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,570
No!

146
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,610
Oops!

147
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,170
Okay, um, should I...

148
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,710
Should I try hosting or does someone else want to try
hosting and inviting everyone?

149
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,230
Let me try.

150
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,330
Would that work?

151
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,950
Yes.

152
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,290
Yes.

153
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,170
Okay, I'm able to make a- Okay.

154
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,790
I think you just- Oh, joy.

155
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,810
Ah!

156
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,090
Oh!

157
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,610
What the hell?

158
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,230
Here!

159
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,570
Oh my god!

160
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,970
Oh!

161
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,430
Oh, I changed me.

162
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,410
Oh, I have to be an old lady.

163
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,990
Why- oh, you're the- You're the driver, Duska!

164
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,170
Oh god!

165
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,030
You can tell that to Babo.

166
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,350
He will lose his mind!

167
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,130
Wait!

168
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,910
He says I'm terrible at driving.

169
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,550
Who's the best driver here?

170
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,630
How many of us can drive?

171
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,930
I can drive!

172
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,850
I can drive?

173
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,250
Oh, it's only me?

174
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,970
Oh, yeah, you're Echo, you're Double.

175
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,730
Am I?

176
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,730
Double-oo.

177
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,910
Yeah, Double-oo.

178
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,170
Oh my god, you're so cute.

179
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,250
Get in the car, shiny!

180
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,690
Wait, is it only me that's double-ing?

181
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,270
Am I doubled?

182
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,130
Yes.

183
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,010
I am?

184
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,190
Yes.

185
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,150
Oh, what?

186
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,650
Oh, no, I think...

187
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,790

251
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
You lied to me, kid.

252
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,460

253
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:51,700
Ah.

254
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,360

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,720
Okay, it says level select.

256
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, we can play Evening at Grandma's or Neil Peel's Deals on
Wheels.

257
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,160
Has anyone played this game?

258
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,080
Do we know what we're doing?

259
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,940
I got no idea.

260
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,920
I think that's the best part, right?

261
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,420
Yeah, we gotta discover how to drive together.

262
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,100
Yeah!

263
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,860
Okay, you guys ready?

264
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,980
Yeah, I'm ready.

265
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,180
Let's try this out.

266
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,460
Oh, it's spooky.

267
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,020
Oh, my God.

268
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,620
Oh, my God.

269
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,200
What?

270
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,880
What are we hearing?

271
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,040
What the heck?

272
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,660
Is that you?

273
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,180
Is that me?

274
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,760
Instead of rushing us out the door, Grandma and Grandpa had
us all crowded around the TV.

275
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,960
Oh my gosh, it's so scary.

276
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,980
They'd heard about it, Bingo Hall.

277
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
They were in awe.

278
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,480
A sweaty local car salesman was blowing their minds with his
latest no-catch government-funded offer.

279
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,920
Oh, mucho texto.

280
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,420
Wow.

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Oh my god.

282
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,780
Holy crap!

283
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,540
Jesus, why aren't you dyslexic to read this?

284
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,840
Oh, who skipped it?

285
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,140
Oh my god, skipped it!

286
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,700
I think I accidentally skipped it.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll go down.

288
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,060
That's okay.

289
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,580
Right, right, right, space.

290
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,960
Oh, I'm- it's so wobbly.

291
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm gonna get so sick.

292
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,340
I'm so- I'm so old.

293
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,040
Who's next to me?

294
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,740
Who are you?

295
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
Oh, I'm in the middle.

296
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm in the middle seat.

297
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,460
You're in the middle?

298
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,580
Hi!

299
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,660
This is me, so neat.

300
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,820
Are you guys all in the back?

301
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, I guess I'm driving.

302
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,980
Yeah, you're driving.

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,120

Okay, how do I move?

307
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:05,220
I think one of the options is that if you go into options
and then press gameplay and then center interact, I think it

308
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,800
helps with the motion sickness.

309
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,060
So I said gameplay center interact on?

310
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, center interact on.

311
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,880
Why is it getting so steamy in here?

312
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,460
Oh my god.

313
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh my god.

314
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,480
Oh my god.

315
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,880
It's like that scene in Titanic.

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,700
Yeah!

317
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh, I think we're on fire!

318
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,160
We're on fire!

319
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm not gonna help!

320
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,560
We haven't even started the game!

321
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,320
I can't even see!

322
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,440
I don't even know!

323
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,340
Go!

324
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:36,980
He.

325
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,620

326
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,860
Oh, oh, my God!

327
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,760
I think I'm going.

328
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,780
I think I'm going.

329
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,320
I don't know.

330
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,360
I can't see.

331
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,440
I can't see anything.

332
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:47,800
I need to hide.

333
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,020
We died?

334
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,280
No!

335
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,060
This might be hell!

336
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,780
This might be hell, actually.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:05,040
I can't see I'm just in spots Oh, we switched spots somehow
I'm all I can't see Wait, are we actually dying?

338
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm gonna Get out of here Have you just had it?

339
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,260
Can you pat yourself?

340
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:11,740
Roll?

341
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,620
It's cloudy in here I can't see Why is there teeth?

342
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,500

343
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh my god I forgot to stay real Uh-oh.

345
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,280
Oh!

346
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,560
Grandma, what are you doing?

347
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,620
Come on.

348
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,060
I don't know.

349
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,920
I don't know.

350
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,500
I think I have dementia.

351
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,820
Turn the air down.

352
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,780
I think that's why it's foggy.

353
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,100
Oh, turn the air down.

354
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,580
Oh.

355
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh, shit.

356
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,680
Oh, my God.

357
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,860
I can see it again.

358
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,980
I can see it again.

359
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,060
Vogu, are you okay?

360
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,900
Oh, it's cold.

361
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,880
The physically would just let me move.

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,520
How am I supposed to get- Why am I derogating?

363
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,280
Who's that dude?

364
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,960
Why are you- Oh, I've got it.

365
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,600
I got it.

366
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,080
I got it.

367
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Okay.

Why are you turning the light on?

518
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,010
Why are you turning the light on, grandma?

519
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,350
It's not gonna help you see better.

520
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,310
I didn't turn the light on.

521
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,270

532
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,690
Where is Mint?

533
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,530
Where's my wife?

534
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,810
She's looking in the box.

535
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,250
In the front.

536
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,650

The left or the right?

550
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,010

Oh, I was just saying- My bet, my bet, my bet, my bet.

678
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,670

685
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,030
I'm driving.

686
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,590
I'm driving.

687
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:23,970

688
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,910
Go straight!

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,950
Go straight!

690
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,690
Wait, who's this?

691
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,210
Who is this?

692
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,870
I'm in the middle.

693
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,470
Who are you?

694
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,090
Who are you?

695
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,050
Oh, you need a coin.

696
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,370
Can we...

697
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,470
Oh, here's a coin, grandma.

698
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,250
Grandpa.

699
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,770
Sorry.

700
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,030
Thank you.

701
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,010
Thank you, Sonny.

702
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,110
Oh, okay.

703
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,490
Sonny.

704
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,530
You're welcome.

705
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,350
I like how he's holding it with both of his hands.

706
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,530
How do I pay?

707
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,250
Oh, look at him.

708
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,610
He's so gentle with it.

709
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,390
How do I pay?

710
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,290
On the right, I think.

711
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,270
On the...

712
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,890
Do I just eat the coin out?

713
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:53,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,630
They'll pick it up.

715
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,130
Yeah, why not?

716
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,450
They'll understand what it means.

717
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,170
Okay, I did it.

718
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,770
Does that work?

719
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,770
No, I'm flooring it.

720
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,930
I think it's on the right.

721
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,810
There's like a toll thing on the right, I think.

722
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,770
Oh, no.

723
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,770

You find a coin?

Oh, oh, I got it on the sea.

I got it.

752
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:02,470
I got it.

753
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,010
I got it.

754
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,330
Get it.

755
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:04,630
Get it.

756
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,150
I got it.

757
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,630
I'm stretching.

758
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,270
Okay.

759
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,390
Do I just throw it in?

760
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:07,830
Yeah, go.

761
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,150
Did it make it?

762
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,170
It's supposed to be turning the sea.

763
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:11,730
No.

764
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,330
It's on the sea.

765
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,650
It's on the right side.

766
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,770
at the passenger seat.

767
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,410
I can't reach it.

768
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,150
I don't see it.

769
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,930
Wait, wait, wait.

770
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,450
What's good?

771
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,950
I can't see it.

772
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:28,830
Oh, we're fucked.

773
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,050
We're sitting on the right.

774
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,950
It's on the right side of the passenger seat.

775
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,910
I was at the hardest part.

776
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,290
I don't know.

777
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,390
You see an emo kid?

778
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,470
No.

779
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,270
Yeah, I don't think you can see anything.

780
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,930
Come on, Grandma, you don't even know our names.

781
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,590
No.

782
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,410
You guys kind of look all the same to me.

783
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:55,930
I'm hurt.

784
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,530
Except one of you.

785
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,770
My feelings.

786
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,010
Not just a face, Grandma.

787
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:07,890
Wait, yeah, if you drive forward and like slam into
something, it'll jostle it.

788
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,030
Oh, I got it, I got it!

789
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,610
Okay, now back up.

790
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,410
We can just switch seats with Mogu and then throw it out the
window.

791
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,730
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,450
Oh, wait, too much, too much!

793
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,750
Oh, she doesn't know how to break!

794
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,230
Oh, she- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

795
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,910
Um, almost there.

796
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:28,950
Dusty!

797
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,990
Okay, okay, wait, we're just a little?

798
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,790
Just a little?

799
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,310
We have to go back a little bit, right?

800
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,890
I'm playing Step Mania.

801
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,250
Oh, what's already playing?

802
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,490
Max 300.

803
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,130
Like this?

804
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,950
Am I- Oh!

805
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,710
Just back up a little bit?

806
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,210
Yeah, just back up just a tad.

807
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,150
Not good?

808
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,510
More?

809
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,090
More!

810
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,590
You're good!

811
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,650
You're good!

812
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:00,950
You're good!

813
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:01,750
Oh!

814
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,170
Oh!

815
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,230
Am I good now?

816
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,170
Forward!

817
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,550
Yep.

818
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:13,630
Okay, okay.

819
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,450
A little more!

820
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,470
A little more!

821
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,950
A little more.

822
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,170
Oh, yeah.

823
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,670
Oh, yeah.

824
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:22,670
Oh.

825
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,510
Did it open?

826
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,730
Did it open?

827
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,350
Yeah.

828
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,050
I don't know.

829
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:26,410
Did it?

830
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,210
Did it?

831
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:29,870
Floor.

832
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,090
Floor.

833
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,430
Did it?

834
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,070
Wait, did it open?

835
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,590
I can't see shit.

836
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,770
It's too cold up here.

837
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,170
Neither can we.

838
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,650
Put the windshield wipers on.

839
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,760
No, it's like that thing where it fogs on the inside.

Do I do this?

843
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,520
Do I risk it?

844
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,600
Risk it for the biscuit.

845
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,320
Kobe!

846
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,660
I missed.

847
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
Wait, did you make it?

848
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,460
No, no, no, no.

849
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,880
Oh, it's back up.

850
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,260
I see the coin in the car.

851
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,700
Yeah, yeah.

852
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,400
Look, they're in the front.

853
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,600
Yeah.

854
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,900
Back up, back up, back up like this.

855
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,660
Back up, back up.

856
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh, uh, yeah.

857
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,460
Can you see through the flames?

858
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,200
Kobe.

859
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Yeah, I think you missed again.

860
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,820
Can I do it?

861
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
I missed it again?

862
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,440
Yeah.

863
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,800
Well, there was like a ticket.

864
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,960
I don't know where that went.

865
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,520
I missed again.

866
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,800
You missed again?

867
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,760
How many pennies are on the floor?

868
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,600
Wait, do we have to put the ticket in the bird?

869
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,440
Oh, do we?

870
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,700
Where is the ticket, though?

871
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,720
That's so complicated.

872
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,840
Oh my god, where is it?

873
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,460
Is it this?

874
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,400
No, I think we're just missing the coin.

875
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,160
Kobe.

876
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,000
Uh.

877
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,280
We're all just...

878
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,520
Oh.

879
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,600
Oh.

880
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,300
Oh, it went back into the car.

881
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,020
We're fine.

882
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,740
Okay, good, good.

883
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,340
Try again.

884
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,740
Try again.

885
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,040
Kobe.

886
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,520
Kobe.

887
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,120
One more.

888
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,020
Can you drive close?

889
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,940
Third time's the charm.

890
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,860
Colby.

891
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Yeah, I think that's the charm.

892
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,120
Meanto.

893
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,580
Did it work?

894
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,220
Did it go?

895
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,480
Wait, it didn't spawn back in the car, though.

896
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:33,920
What the heck?

897
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,600
Oimo.

898
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,640
It worked?

899
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,440
It's up your ass.

900
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,400
It's on my butt.

901
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,140
It's on my butt.

902
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,140
I can't grab it.

903
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,820
I can't grab it.

904
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,780
Okay, thank you.

905
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,140
Oh, go.

906
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,100
Wait, wait.

907
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
That's a little bath.

908
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:47,980
More a little bath.

909
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,780
More, back a little tiny bit.

910
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,740
Back a little tiny bit.

911
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,640
And you reverse a little bit.

912
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,620
And to the right.

913
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,860
Like that?

914
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,060
More?

915
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,720
Wait, we're going forward somehow?

916
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,360
How are we going?

917
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,720
Oh, I'm not.

918
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,860
I'm backing up.

919
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,920
Oh, like this.

920
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,140
Um.

921
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,620
Mogu.

922
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,280
Uh.

923
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,880
Wait, did that work?

924
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,480
No.

925
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,900
Did it?

926
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,220
I can't see, remember?

927
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,000

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,310
Yeah, they'll never catch me.

1104
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,390
I'll be done before I finish.

1105
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:16,670
Am I close?

1106
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,690
Am I close?

1107
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,130
Left a little?

1108
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,990
No, you're nowhere close.

1109
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,090
Who said right?

1110
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,050
Oh, oh, stop!

1111
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:24,650
Oh, stop!

1112
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,030
Oh, what?

1113
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,130
Oh, back up just a little bit.

1114
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,570
Oh, my God, so close.

1115
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,070
It's just a little bit.

1116
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:30,790
Like that.

1117
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:31,990
Just a little bit.

1118
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,570
You're good.

1119
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:33,190
Keep going.

1120
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:33,810
You're good.

1121
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,530
Okay, oh, stop!

1123
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,570
Hold up, hold up.

1124
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:38,510
Oh!

1125
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,250
Oh my God!

1126
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,410
Ah!

1127
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,570
Did you do it?

1128
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,370
Feel it good?

1129
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:42,990
Fly!

1130
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,650
Oh, I'm reversing.

1131
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,850
Wait, hold on!

1132
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,610
We did that one!

1133
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:48,850
We told we did that!

1134
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,570
Yeah!

1135
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,050
Yeah!

1136
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:54,630
Yeah!

1137
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,270
Free!

1138
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,930
I'm free!

1139
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:58,950
I'm free!

1140
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:04,590
Oh my god!

1141
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,690
Oh, who's that?

1142
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,830
She ran into another car and your grandson is...

1143
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,430
I think his neck is broken.

1144
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,270
Who are you?

1145
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:10,770
Who are you?

1146
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,310
Oh, I am going berserk.

1147
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,710
Oh, I guess you got a kid.

1148
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,750
Oh, I'm not.

1149
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:19,930
We're good.

1150
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:20,750
We're good.

1151
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,270
Does anyone want to be the driver now?

1152
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:25,910
Okay, I could try.

1153
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:27,750
Okay.

1154
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:29,730
That's me.

1155
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:30,290
Oh.

1156
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,250
Let's go, I'm up.

1157
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,570
No, it's me.

1158
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,310
I don't know how to get out of here, actually.

1159
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:38,750
Are there arrows?

1160
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:40,350
Wait.

1161
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,630
Is left go forward or right go forward?

1162
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:45,890
Right, right, right.

1163
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,350
It's like you said you knew how to drive.

1164
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,230
Wait, Oimo, she doesn't know how to drive.

1165
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,850
Left is brake.

1166
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,210
Yeah, left is brake.

1167
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:53,670
Oh, left is brake.

1168
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:54,510
Go fast.

1169
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,750
And I reverse using this?

1170
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:57,330
Yep.

1171
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,210
The Prindle.

1172
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:58,770
Yes.

1173
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,030
The Prindle?

1174
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,450
The middle is back?

1175
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:02,330
No.

1176
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,190
This is back?

1177
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,250
Oimo, you never drove in a car before in your life.

1178
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,110
Okay, we're going way back.

1179
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,310
We're going back into the garage.

1180
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,010
We're going back into the garage.

1181
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,830
Hold up.

1182
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,530
Okay, forward?

1183
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:17,910
Oh, okay.

1184
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:18,490
Okay, okay.

1185
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,250
I think we're running over people.

1186
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:21,430
That's fine.

1187
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,630
Yeah, what are we running over?

1188
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:23,570
Why are you so bumpy?

1189
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,130
Whoa!

1190
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:24,630
Oh!

1191
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,610
Right, right, right, right.

1192
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,950
Hard, right!

1193
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,370
Hard, right!

1194
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,650
I got...

1195
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,850
I got funked out of my feet.

1196
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:33,530
Oh, yeah, you did.

1197
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,090
Okay.

1198
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,350
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

1199
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:37,830
Go, go!

1200
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,250
That's straight.

1201
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:40,730
Can you...

1202
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,030
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

1203
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,510
Come on, grandpa.

1204
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,170
Ah, crap.

1205
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,830
But once in your life, don't go straight.

1206
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,730
Oh, grandpa, great.

1207
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:48,450
Okay.

1208
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,250
Like crank that wheel.

1209
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,830
Oh, that's close.

1210
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,330
That's close.

1211
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,610
You just kind of ran over a car.

1212
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,250
Drift!

1213
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,110
Oh.

1214
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,470
Oh, wait, hold on.

1215
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:58,910
Hold that working guy.

1216
00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,930
Yeah, you're gaming.

1217
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:00,650
Just go backwards.

1218
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,330
Keep going backwards.

1219
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:03,990
That's not backwards.

1220
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,550
That's not backwards.

1221
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,010
We're back to where we love these cars.

1222
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,010
Right, right, right, right, right.

1223
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,030
Hard right, right, right.

1224
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:15,890
Hard right!

1225
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:16,730
Hard right!

1226
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:19,870
Where are we?

1227
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,870
Back up and then go right.

1228
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,470
Yeah, you're good?

1229
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:24,890
You're good?

1230
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:25,990
Right.

1231
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,870
Oh, you turned on the light.

1232
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:30,410
You okay?

1233
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,070
Hey, who died?

1234
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,590
Hey, who are you?

1235
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,790
Hey, come back.

1236
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:37,170
Okay.

1237
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:38,130
Okay.

1238
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,130
And then...

1239
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:41,970
Go right.

1240
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:42,510
Right!

1241
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:42,810
Right!

1242
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,890
Right.

1243
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,330
Yeah, you're fine.

1244
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,230
You got it.

1245
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,790
Which way are we supposed to go?

1246
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,010
Okay.

1247
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:48,650
To the right.

1248
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:49,630
There's that.

1249
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,870
Oh, wait, but there's arrows pointing left.

1250
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:53,410
Hmm.

1251
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,110
Maybe that's for the other side when we get out of this
door.

1252
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,010
I think you're right.

1253
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:57,650
I think you're right.

1254
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,350
Where are we even trying to go?

1255
00:48:59,490 --> 00:48:59,770
Oh, no, yeah.

1256
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:00,510
It says right.

1257
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,250
It says right.

1258
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:01,930
Come on in.

1259
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,590
Drive through the doors.

1260
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:05,530
Drive through the door.

1261
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,250
Where?

1262
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:06,990
Okay.

1263
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,050
Right, right, right, right, right.

1264
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:08,590
Oh!

1265
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,290
Grandpa, stop!

1266
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,490
Grandpa, you're setting me up!

1267
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,830
Oh no!

1268
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,510
Again, I...

1269
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:16,930
I know that's meant.

1270
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,850
Oh my god.

1271
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:20,570
Oh my god.

1272
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,690
Oh my god.

1273
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:21,810
Oh.

1274
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:21,930
Oh.

1275
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,410
Oh, okay.

1276
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:23,830
This is so stressful.

1277
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,590
It does say come on in.

1278
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,870
I think you just go inside.

1279
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:28,670
Yeah, we just go inside.

1280
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,030
Meals, peals.

1281
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:30,530
Do anything.

1282
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,530
Peals on wheels.

1283
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,730
Go inside and pregnant the store.

1284
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,310
Okay, I'm gonna go right.

1285
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:37,830
Yeah.

1286
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,930
Give them another car baby.

1287
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:40,690
Left?

1288
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,310
Yeah, car baby.

1289
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:42,910
What?

1290

We're still being stuck on the door, I think.

1507
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,080
Yeah, the walls or something.

1508
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,260

01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,200

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1512
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,220
This is perfect.

1513
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,380
This is the optimal angle.

1514
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:44,940
Oh, whoops.

1515
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,060

01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,580
Oh, oh, wait.

1517
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,620
It's not so optimal anymore.

1518
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,660
Will it?

1519
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,180

Are we going in?

1525
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,740
I can go forward a little more.

1526
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,640
Let's go.

1527
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,880

01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:03,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1529
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,500
Should I go backwards?

1530
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:10,580
Imagine that you're reversing into a parking spot that's on
your left.

1531
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,460
Wait, what?

1532
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:17,180
Just reverse, but like imagine the parking spot is on your
left.

1533
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,340
We're reversing in.

1534
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,020
Do you know how to reverse park?

1535
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,520

I was reversing.

1546
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:40,720

We got it.

1794
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,960
Only 22 bumps.

1795
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:02,880
I don't believe that.

1796
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,320
What is that?

1797
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:05,980
A cane?

01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,180
Yeah.

1799
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,000
A new spindle?

1800
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,440
That's a sick spindle.

1801
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:09,980
Look at that.

1802
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,660
It's the prindle.

1803
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,400
Prindle.

1804
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,160
I can't believe we did it.

1805
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,380
We never park anymore.

1806
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,480
We just go straight.

1807
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:20,740
The spindle.

1808
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:21,340
His floor.

1809
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,220
He's got to go fast.

1810
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,580
The mint carried hard.

1811
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:25,760

Mindy was like the best driver.

1814
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,760
I never expected that.

1815
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,320
I'm pretty good at driving.

1816
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,420
I've never had a ticket or an accident.

1817
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,200
Oh my God, save him.

1818
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,320
I'm pretty good.

1819
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,660
I took my riding exam eight times before I passed.

1820
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,900
Oh, well, the first time I took my driving exam, I drove on
the wrong side of the road.

1821
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:48,240
Yay.

1822
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,320
So maybe I am pretty good at this game.

1823
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:52,620
Yay.

1824
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:53,860
Yeah.

1825
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,980
Okay, I guess we go next.

1826
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,960
Yeah, let's go.

1827
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:00,340
What?

1828
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,100
What is this Simlish going on?

1829
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,780
Wasn't it in English?

1830
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,620
Yeah, I think it was.

1831
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,300
It was originally right.

1832
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,480
What's happening?

1833
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,940
What's the topic is that?

1834
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,700
Sorry guys, I had a Chipotle for lunch.

1835
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,080
Oh, whoa.

1836
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:23,900
Where are we going?

1837
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:24,900
Traffic time!

1838
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,560
Oh, we do have a new spindle.

1839
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,700
Alright, I'm gonna...

1840
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:29,820

01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:31,080
Spindle.

1842
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,360
Oh, there's a tape in your mouth.

1843
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,280
Oh, here.

1844
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,360

01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,540
Okay, where am I going?

1846
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:38,820
Where are we going?

1847
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,540
Let's just go straight for now, I guess.

1848
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:41,920
Yeah, floor.

1849
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:44,300

01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:07,820
I hear it to you.

1948
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,160

01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:20,760
No, no, no, no.

1957
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,020
Wait, you can't even see the traffic?

1958
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,480
Who farted?

1959
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,400
No, ew.

1960
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,940
Who did that?

1961
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,000
Ew, why is it stinky?

1962
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,380
Oh, they have.

1963
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,340
Roll the window down!

1964
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,140
Roll the window down!

1965
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,560
What's wrong with someone's stomach?

1966
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,680
Mogu is that you?

1967
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:39,700

01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:41,500
Mogu!

1969
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,780
Stop eating Chipotle, you know what it does to you.

1970
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,400
You're not about to share a room with you.

1971
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,100
No!

1972
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,420
Go?

1973
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,180
I can't help it!

1974
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:51,500
Yeah!

1975
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,440
We're going!

1976
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,060
We're going!

1977
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:57,940
I think we need to go to the left or right maybe?

1978
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,240
Are we gonna try it on the sidewalk?

1979
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,780
I think we need to go to the left.

1980
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,980
The left, yeah.

1981
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,020
The right is on block.

1982
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:04,380
Yeah.

1983
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,640
Oh, back up?

Oh, sorry.

1990
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:11,960
Back it up!

1991
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,660
I'm back in the...

1992
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,260
I think I'm stuck.

1993
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,300
Oh, no.

1994
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,500
Wait, no, you're not.

1995
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,320
Don't say that.

1996
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,700
Oh, God.

1997
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,300
Who, who, who, who?

1998
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:20,780
Uh.

1999
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,560
I'm going to roll the windows up before y'all dies.

2000
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:25,960
That's just how it is.

2001
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,040
I don't know where we are.

2002
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,020
I don't know.

2003
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,560
Who's- who's yelling?

2004
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,280
Who's saying expletives?

2005
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,300
Someone have poop?

2006
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,560
I- uh...

2007
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,040
Uh, I think I fucked.

2008
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:40,960
Huh?

2009
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,040
Oh, maybe you have to drive on top of the cars?

2010
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,280
I don't think so.

2011
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,740
There's- No, I think you go- Go to the left.

2012
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,000
Okay, we have to back up.

2013
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:51,920
Yeah, we gotta back up.

2014
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:52,540
Back up?

2015
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,040
Okay.

2016
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:53,960
Can we back up?

2017
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,940
Is this a front wheel or a back wheel drive?

2018
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:57,940
Um...

2019
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,200
It's a no-wheel drive.

2020
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,260
Okay.

2021
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,780
What's that supposed to mean?

2022
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,860
Okay, I'm gonna gas it.

2023
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,360
Don't gas it, please.

2024
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:08,820
Okay.

2025
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,060
It's already pretty stinky in here.

2026
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,040
I think we might have to restart.

2027
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,440
How do you restart?

2028
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,040
Yeah, the set point.

2029
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2030
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:17,960
Oh, there we go.

2031
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:18,340
There we go.

2032
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2033
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,340
Oh, but you have to go forward again, yeah.

2034
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:22,720
Okay.

2035
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:23,700
Oh.

2036
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,680
If I can do it, you can do it.

2037
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:27,740
Oh.

2038
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,040
I'm scratching my head.

2039
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,780
It's an overkill.

2040
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:34,720
Okay.

2041
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:35,860
Okay.

2042
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,020
Yeah!

2043
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,660
Yeah, now stop, stop, stop, stop!

2044
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:41,140
Oh.

2045
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,560
Oh, ew!

2046
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,480
You're like my cat.

2047
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,620
Scared the poop out of you.

2048
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,140
Alright, now go to your left.

2049
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,580
Back up.

2050
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,220
Go to my left?

2051
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:52,540
Okay.

2052
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:53,500
Yeah.

2053
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,660
Why am I stuck?

2054
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,620
Oh, I lost the pedal.

2055
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,880
Oh, no!

2056
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,620
I don't see it.

2057
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:02,840
I probably need to cuddle.

2058
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:03,720
Grandpa!

2059
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,120
Oh wait, wait, I think I saw it.

2060
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,120
Is that it?

2061
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,340
Oh, I see it.

2062
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:08,700
I see it.

2063
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,080
You saw it?

2064
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:09,640
Oh, you got it?

2065
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:10,060
Okay, good.

2066
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,520
It's cold.

2067
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:13,760
What am I doing?

2068
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,600
Turn to the left, hard left.

2069
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,260
No, we're trying to go to the left.

2070
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,400
Oh, hit the guy.

2071
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,280
Hit the guy, yeah.

2072
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,480
Don't forget what happened.

2073
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:21,260
What guy?

2074
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,480
Hard left.

2075
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,200
Hard left.

2076
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,400
Just go forward.

2077
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:24,600
Hard left.

2078
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,800
Am I going forward?

2079
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:26,480
Hard left?

2080
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,500
No, I think it's left.

2081
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:27,760
No.

2082
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,160
There you go.

2083
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,100
Go straight, go straight, go straight.

2084
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:30,960
Wait!

2085
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,100
Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2086
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,360
Oh, we hit a checkpoint though.

2087
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,120
That's good.

2088
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,820
Now to the right.

2089
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:39,860
Also, don't forget me.

2090
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:40,980
Oh, okay, never mind.

2091
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,940
Oh, I'm like, wait, what happened to us?

2092
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,420
Where are you?

2093
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,500
Wait, I'm in here.

2094
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:47,360
I'm in the middle seat.

2095
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,460
Wait, did I lose Mint?

2096
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,300
Yeah, I'm out of the car.

2097
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:52,560
Okay.

2098
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,280
No, no, no.

2099
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,440
Okay, go on right a little bit.

2100
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:57,920
The Prindal.

2101
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,900
Oh, yeah, we're the Prindal.

2102
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,200
Where's my Prindal?

2103
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:00,980
Oh, I see it.

2104
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:01,360
I see it.

2105
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:01,980
It's not that.

2106
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,520
It's in the front.

2107
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,520
I'm throwing this cash out.

2108
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,500
I'm trying to reach it.

2109
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:06,880
There you go.

2110
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:07,500
Ugh.

2111
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:09,980
Oh, thank you.

2112
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,260
You just threw it up.

2113
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,900
Where am I supposed to go?

2114
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:14,340
Sorry.

2115
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:14,980
Right?

2116
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,000
A little bit?

2117
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,120
Like 90 degrees.

2118
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:17,740
Forward?

2119
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:18,360
Right?

2120
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:18,880
That way.

2121
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:19,480
Right?

2122
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,600
90 degrees, yeah.

2123
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,480
Forward, right.

2124
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:22,840
90 degrees.

2125
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,640
Oh, yeah, good, good, good.

2126
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,680
Oh, oh.

2127
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,500
Oh.

2128
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:26,760
Uh.

2129
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:27,880
Reverse.

2130
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:28,620
Okay.

2131
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,260
And then left reverse.

2132
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're doing it?

2133
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,380
Grandpa's an iPad kid!

Yeah.

2135
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:04,400
There you go.

2136
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,360
What's our iPad?

2137
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,020
What's your cocoa melon?

2138
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,860
I don't want cocoa melon.

2139
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:14,480
Do they have cocoa melon for grandpaws and grand- for
grandparents?

2140
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,040
I think this is what- Oh wait, Sean, sorry.

2141
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:17,620
Wrong way.

2142
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,320
You gotta go back a little.

2143
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,460
You're hitting a- Back?

2144
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,940
Yeah, you're hitting a fire hydrant.

2145
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,180
Your mama's a fire hydrant.

2146
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,140
Wait, aren't we supposed to turn around though?

2147
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,360

Get back to you.

2156
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,720
I looked at you.

2157
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,120
Again.

2158
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,940
How am I supposed to make it?

2159
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,380
Get back.

2160
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:10,860
Oh.

2161
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:11,520
No, no.

2162
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,240
You're about to back into the park.

2163
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,140
So you're doing pretty good.

2164
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:14,860
Okay.

2165
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,220
So do I back into the park or do I U-turn or like- Yeah, you
could probably back in.

2166
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,220
Back it in.

2167
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,200
For it.

2168
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,200
Pack that ass up.

2169
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,060
If I back it up, is it fat enough?

2170
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,820
No, you're moving a little though.

2171
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,520
You might be able to.

2172
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:28,620
Yeah, you might be able to.

2173
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,120
Oh.

2174
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:29,940
We're squeezing in.

2175
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,560
Parallel parking, damn.

2176
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,200
Oh, we're, like, going the wrong way.

2177
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,060
Oh, no, never mind.

Is there the other exit that's over there on the right?

2324
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,100
I'm missing a pedal.

2325
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,260

There you go, buddy.

2338
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,400
That's not another gate.

2339
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:05,060
Where am I supposed to go?

2340
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:06,780

Wait, don't say that.

2353
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,280
It's not okay.

2354
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,200
It's not okay.

Oh my gosh, the way it spins too much.

01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,880
Oh, the wheel spins too much when I back up.

2494
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,100
It messes me up.

2495
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,360

Okay, just back up?

2501
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,860
Yeah, I was like a U-turn trying to do.

2502
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,840
A U-turn.

2503
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:44,140

2504
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,020
Do you remember what a U-turn is, Grandma?

Oh, yeah, you can just U-turn.

2506

01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:51,640
Okay, okay.

I'll do it.

2510
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:52,920
I'll just U-turn.

2511
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,320
Okay.

2512
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:54,060
You're so smart.

Yeah.

2514
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,040
It's so simple.

2515
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:57,500
Am I U-turning?

2516
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:58,740

Am I U-turning?

2522
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:09,080
Do you not know what a U looks like?

2523
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,060
One second.

2524
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,480
Let me go back to the other one.

2525
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:14,960
Oh no, it might be over.

2526
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:15,720
No, it's not.

2527
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,600
How do we do the checkpoint thing?

2528
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,760
Oh no, we're good, we're good.

2529

01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:07,870
I'm outside.

2610
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:08,370
Don't worry about it.

2611
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,270
We need the money.

2612
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,730
Yeah, we need the cash.

2613
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:11,550

Oh, someone.

01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:24,490
Is someone laying the hawk?

2623
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:27,150
Is someone honking at us in the park?

2624
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,210
I like we're bad drivers.

2625
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:30,470

Oh, you're like- Yeah, turn to your left, actually.

If you turn- if you go- No, never mind.

01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,030
Just make a sharp left.

2631
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:44,230
Super left.

2632
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,650
Super left and go straight.

Oh.

2897
01:49:45,770 --> 01:49:47,230

Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:58,070
What's happened?

2907
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,970

No, no, no, no.

2921
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,990
This part is always so hard.

2922
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:36,250
This part's difficult, yeah.

2923
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:37,610

The right seat.

2994
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:44,730
The passenger seat floor.

2995
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,930

2996
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,650

Drive-through!

3042
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:18,090

Yeah.

3057
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:39,650
Pick up a little bit.

3058
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,230

01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:41,090
And then right.

01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:44,190
A little bit and then go through the drive.

3062
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:46,270
We're gonna have chicken nuggets.

3063
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:46,990

3072
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:59,710
Oh my god, it's like we're actually going through.

3073
01:55:00,570 --> 01:55:00,970
Oh my god.

Oh yeah, I see the drive-through!

3075
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:03,050

3077
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:04,750

3079
01:55:05,570 --> 01:55:06,650

3080
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:07,690
Okay, perfect, perfect, stop.

3081
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:07,930
Okay.

3082
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:08,870

01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,090
Straight.

3087
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:12,610
Just go straight.

3088
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:12,950
Okay.

3089
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:16,770
Wait, where do we go in?

3090
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:17,390
Where's the safe?

3091
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:18,830
I'm so hungry.

3092
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:20,090
Drive-through slop!

3095
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:24,210
Am I going still?

3096
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:26,050
Just like two steps, two steps.

3097
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:27,130
And then luck.

3098
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:28,110
Unless?

3099
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:28,490

01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:42,250
I'm sorry!

3110
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:42,490

3111
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,290
I can score it!

3112
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:46,930
Oh my god, is that why we need the coins?

3113
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:47,350
Hello.

3114
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:49,490

3115
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:50,990
Oh- Can I get a...

3116
01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:51,130

Oh, I want you to look like a...

3118
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:54,450
Hello?

3119
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:58,050
I want up, I want down, I want left, and I want right.

3120
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:00,010
Do I pull up more?

3121
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:02,770
No, there's a car.

3122
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:05,330
Guys, order.

3123
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:06,010
Did you guys order?

3124
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:10,150
Why do you get him?

3125
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,950
Are we supposed to throw the coin?

3126
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,130
A coin at them?

3127
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:15,850
Or is there something else?

3128
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:16,670
I don't see anything.

3129
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,270
I could throw a coin too.

3130
01:56:21,610 --> 01:56:24,250
Can I get some fries?

3131
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:26,210
I have some...

3132
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:27,070
You're the one who's driving.

3133
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:28,210
Oh, yeah.

3134
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:30,230
No, it says pay here, like over there, though.

3135
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:31,950
So I don't know if we're supposed to pay here.

3136
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:34,650
Did I do it?

3137
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:36,090
I'm not going to swear at him.

3138
01:56:36,250 --> 01:56:36,970
I'm Canadian.

3139
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:38,030
How do you swear?

3140
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:38,690
How do you swear?

3141
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:39,290
How do you swear?

3142
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:40,730
A space bar?

3143
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:43,430
No, mine's telling me.

3144
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:48,920
Wait, wait.

3145
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:51,500
Um...

3146
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,520
I have a mixtape in my mouth.

3147
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,380
Get it off me, Grandma.

3148
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:03,180

01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:09,900
Wait, you have to?

3152
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:11,760

3153
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:13,140
Oh!

3154
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:14,060
No, it's not a square.

01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:16,480

Oh, I guess you just gotta go forward because there's
nothing really out.

3233
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:35,800
Oh, I can't wait.

3234
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,500

02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:50,280
I can't see anything!

3247
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,180

02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,140
How do we get out?

3250

Yeah, you're missing the break.

4299
02:42:37,610 --> 02:42:38,830
I wasn't before.

02:42:56,980 --> 02:42:58,620
Baba hates when I do this.

4305
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,820
Why would he hate it?

4306
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:05,600
Why would he hate it?

4307
02:43:05,900 --> 02:43:06,980
I know, right?

4308
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:08,860
He tells me to stop doing this.

4309
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,180
Here, I threw it to you.

4310
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:11,280

Oh, it's over.

Alright, you step guys.

Grandma's gonna get ran over by a reindeer, except the
reindeer looks like a car.

4319
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:27,780

You are stuck, yeah.

You gotta turn, you gotta go hard right now, hard right.

Forward hard right.

4331

Hard.

4332
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:18,760
Hard rock.

4333
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:19,960
Harder.

4334
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,520
Harder, harder, harder.

4335
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:22,160
Harder.

4336
02:44:22,460 --> 02:44:22,940
Harder.

4337
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:26,020
Now hard right.

4338
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:26,840
Harder.

4339
02:44:29,480 --> 02:44:30,160
Harder right.

4340
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:31,180
Harder right.

4341
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,240
Like the hardest...

4342
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:35,420
You're just going straight back and forth, sweetie.

4343
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,180
You're really good.

4344
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:43,820
Wait, who's in the seat now?

4345
02:44:43,940 --> 02:44:44,340
It's me.

4346
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:47,060
Vintos, save us.

4347
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:48,020
Save us, save us.

4348
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:49,500
I don't want to do this part.

4349
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:50,220
I don't want to.

4350
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:51,060
I don't want to.

4351
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:52,540
I think I got stunned.

4352
02:44:53,380 --> 02:44:54,280
Wait, are we...

4353
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:54,380
Oh.

4354
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:58,020
Oh, wait.

4355
02:44:58,420 --> 02:44:59,480
I went the wrong way, my bud.

4356
02:45:00,180 --> 02:45:00,940
And then you can reverse.

4357
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:02,180
Let's just reverse back.

4358
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,440
Yeah, we'll do it backwards.

4359
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:04,500
We'll just do it.

4360
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:05,380
We'll do it in style.

4361
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:08,200
We don't look at cool explosions.

4362
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:12,340
The only thing cool that I like to see is in this car
already.

4363
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:13,900
Where's the train?

4364
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:14,940
It'll come.

4365
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:15,820
Oh, wait.

4366
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:15,960
Awesome.

4367
02:45:16,320 --> 02:45:16,380
Awesome.

4368
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:17,400
It always comes.

4369
02:45:18,380 --> 02:45:19,020
Oh, shit.

4370
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:20,600
Oh, shit.

4371
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:22,880
I think that was me.

4372
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:23,700
I'm sorry.

4373
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:25,100
I'm sorry.

4374
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:26,020
I'm sorry.

4375
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:27,920
I lost my Prindle.

4376
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:29,360
Can someone please give it to me?

4377
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:30,160
I think I see it.

4378
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:32,520
Dear Prindle, I see it.

4379
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4380
02:45:34,700 --> 02:45:35,440
Oh, oh, oh.

4381
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:37,980
Did anyone grab it?

4382
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:39,560
Did anyone grab it?

4383
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,040
I don't know.

4384
02:45:43,660 --> 02:45:45,200
You told me to grab all.

4385
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:47,260
And did anyone grab my break?

4386
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:48,100
We're still alive.

4387
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:49,280
It's behind me.

4388
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,080
It's behind me.

4389
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:50,720
It's behind me.

4390
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:51,920
It's on my butt.

4391
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:53,160
Oh no, it's on your butt.

4392
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:54,960
Oh, why are you shoving up your butt?

4393
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:57,480
You're not supposed to let that sanitize at first.

4394
02:45:57,660 --> 02:45:58,640
Yes, I will give it to this.

4395
02:45:58,760 --> 02:45:59,560

Left, left, left, left, left!

4400
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:33,980
We're trying!

4401
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:41,280
Where am I?

4402
02:46:41,900 --> 02:46:42,280
Wait.

4403
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:44,440
Oh my gosh, we're almost out of bounds!

4404
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:46,020
Holy cow!

4405
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:47,340
We're back at the entrance!

4406
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:49,120
It's coming again, I think.

4407
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:51,600
Oh my god.

4408
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:56,940
It's so difficult.

4409
02:46:57,160 --> 02:46:57,500
It is.

4410
02:46:57,560 --> 02:47:01,040
I don't think we're gonna get through this part, everybody,
But that's fine.

4411
02:47:01,060 --> 02:47:02,700
Okay, grab while it goes straight.

4412
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:04,080
Okay, you're going great.

4413
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:05,020
Go straight.

4414
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:07,160
Okay, good, good, good.

4415
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:07,760
Oh, my God.

4416
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:08,080
You're doing so good.

4417
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:08,640
You're doing so good.

4418
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:09,500
Very straight.

4419
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:10,220
Left, left, left.

4420
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:10,920
There we go.

4421
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:11,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4422
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:13,500
Oh, is this pattern right now?

4423
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:14,660
No!

4424
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:17,380
It's over for us!

4425
02:47:17,860 --> 02:47:18,440
It's okay.

4426
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:19,760
There's another train coming right.

4427
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:20,440
Maybe I'll see.

4428
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:22,140
Oh, it reset.

4429
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:22,640
It reset.

4430
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:27,340
Oh, it pushes way back into the entrance.

4431
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:28,680
Why did it do that?

4432
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:31,220
Oh, there you go.

4433
02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:32,320
Thank you, thank you.

4434
02:47:32,620 --> 02:47:33,920
Good, good.

4435
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:36,560
Okay, okay, okay, nice.

4436
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:37,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4437
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:38,080
Oh, it's cold.

4438
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:39,560
Oh, sorry, my bad.

4439
02:47:39,940 --> 02:47:41,080
That's my, I didn't do that.

4440
02:47:41,460 --> 02:47:44,020
I swear, there's this, this, this car is haunted or
something.

4441
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:44,940
For real.

4442
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,080
Ghost car.

4443
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:46,700
Ghost car.

4444
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:48,660
It's like there's two ghosts in here or something.

4445
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:49,640
Like, what the hell?

4446
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:50,560
Oh my god, what?

4447
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:51,980
Why would that happen ever?

4448
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:53,940
That's like the rarest thing ever.

4449
02:47:54,980 --> 02:47:55,540
That's crazy.

4450
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:56,860
Try to drive a car.

4451
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:58,800
Yeah, it could never happen.

4452
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:01,640
Okay.

4453
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:02,680
Okay.

4454
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:03,480
Sorry.

4455
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:05,640
I know I'm driving a little erratically.

4456
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:06,580
Here we go.

4457
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:08,860
I think Omo and I are also probably dead.

4458
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:11,720
Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left.

4459
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:13,280
Yeah, I think this is pattern recognition.

4460
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:13,900
It's always left.

4461
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:15,740
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

4462
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:17,080
Oh!

4463
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:18,780
Wait, no, hold up.

4464
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:19,380
Hold up.

4465
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:20,560
Wait, we made it through the first part.

4466
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:21,800
We made it back, back up, back up, back up.

4467
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:22,280
Back up, I'm trying!

4468
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:23,260
Back up!

4469
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:25,600
Yeah, go right, go right, go right.

4470
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:26,400
Yeah, a little bit.

4471
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:26,480
Yeah, a little bit.

4472
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good.

4473
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:28,480
Oh my God, no way!

4474
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:30,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4475
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:32,080
I think we went past the first part.

4476
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:34,460
Uh, we made it to the third part.

4477
02:48:34,820 --> 02:48:35,240
Oh, wait.

4478
02:48:35,400 --> 02:48:35,720
Oh, shoot.

4479
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:36,380
I went the wrong way.

4480
02:48:36,580 --> 02:48:37,380
Okay, just go make a hard right.

4481
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:37,740
Yeah.

4482
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:42,240
The rotation on this part is ass.

4483
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:46,360
Okay, go straight.

4484
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:46,600
Go straight.

4485
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:46,900
Go straight.

4486
02:48:49,420 --> 02:48:50,340
And then left.

4487
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:51,740
Yeah.

4488
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:53,440
Oh, we did it.

4489
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:54,300
Oh.

4490
02:48:54,660 --> 02:48:55,500
Oh, what's happening?

4491
02:48:56,060 --> 02:48:56,200
Oh.

4492

4644
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:08,660
There was one part of something that I was making that was
like the most daunting for me and I was like oh my gosh am I

4645
02:58:08,660 --> 02:58:09,960
going to be able to do this?

4646
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:12,120
Am I going to be able to complete it in time?

4647
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:17,620
And then I came up with another idea and I was like yeah I'm
so glad I'm a genius.

4648
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:19,940
I'm so glad I'm a genius.
