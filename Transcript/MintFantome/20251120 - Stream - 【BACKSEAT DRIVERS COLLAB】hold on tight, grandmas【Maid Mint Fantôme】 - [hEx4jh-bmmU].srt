00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Happy duty!

2
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,580
Happy duty!

3
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Thank you so much for the Tony Captain!

4
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,300
Thank you!

5
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,680
Thank you!

6
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,560
Wow, it's been so long since I last streamed!

7
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,020
Definitely for me it was not...

8
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,960
20 minutes ago!

9
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,040
Not at all!

10
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,720
I totally didn't get changed in that time.

11
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,880
Not at all!

12
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,300
We missed you!

13
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,820
Wow.

14
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,660
You guys are too much.

15
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Hishashiburi!

16
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,080
You missed me?

17
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
You missed me!

18
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,940
Today is a collab!

19
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,300
So, it'll be me.

20
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm going in order of people on the thumbnail.

21
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,740
Oymo!

22
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,960
Mogu!

23
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,700
Dust go.

24
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
They are... they are...

25
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Wait, hold on.

26
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm gonna click out of the game and it's gonna stop the music.

27
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,400
They are in Discord right now, so I should probably join.

28
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,740
I should probably stop being a little introvert and talking to you guys.

29
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Are we there yet?

30
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,060
Are we there yet?

31
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,920
So I'm going to join them.

32
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Um, I'm coming.

33
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,210
I'm going to tell them and be like, Oh, let me, let me, let me socializing.

34
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,110
Whoa, yeah.

35
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,370
It's my first time collabing with everybody, but I've been friends with everybody for quite a long time.

36
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:45,790
funny that it's our first time collabing like actually me and Dusko like we hang out very not I wouldn't say often but like if we're in the same place together we hang out together so like I see her at many conventions and events and we've gone to Disney together and stuff so two ghosts in one stream I know!

37
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,110
And Vogue was a ghost we're extra haunted yeah yeah So, yeah, I'm going to go, I'm going to join now.

38
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,090
Bye, everybody.

39
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,730
Oh, why did Oimo say no?

40
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,930
I don't think Oimo wants to collab with me.

41
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,390
I think she hates me.

42
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,110
I'm coming in anyway.

43
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,990
Oh, my God.

44
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,410
We should run.

45
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,590
Run, run, run, run.

46
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,030
Thank you, Aklaan, Mint Slime.

47
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,230
Me, howdy, Mint.

48
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,370
Me, howdy.

49
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,350
What's going on?

50
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,070
What's happening?

51
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,110
I think Oimo's about to pass away.

52
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,150
Can you resurrect her?

53
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,390
Can you give her mouth to mouth, please?

54
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,930
Why is she about to pass away?

55
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:32,550
Wait.

56
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,170
Because you walked in the room.

57
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,590
You just have to affect the people.

58
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,070
Oimo is not in the call.

59
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,090
She doesn't recognize my existence.

60
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,030
This is great.

61
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,730
She's going great.

62
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,330
It's going awesome.

63
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,050
This is already going so great.

64
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,470
She doesn't hear me.

65
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,970
I'm gonna...

66
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,910
No, I can hear you.

67
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,790
I can hear you.

68
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,090
Just why aren't you in the Discord?

69
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,390
Oh my gosh, is that Mogu wants to play with me?

70
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh my god, Carol!

71
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,270
Oh my god!

72
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,570
No!

73
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,590
Wait, the invite disappeared.

74
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,810
I didn't- Wait, you can change their skin color?

75
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,930
Wait, let me share my screen.

76
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,810
This is insane.

77
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,030
Oh wait, I can hear you in the game, huh?

78
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,930
down in the game.

79
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,510
I think so.

80
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,250
Send me another invite, please.

81
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,930
Wait, why can't I...

82
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,090
Why can't I send it?

83
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,730
Dusty, you can use it in the invite!

84
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,930
Yeah, I like...

85
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,250
Oh.

86
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,690
It's like great outfit.

87
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:42,890
Why?

88
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,310
Why game hate me?

89
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,250
Does the audio doubled right now?

90
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,070
Yes.

91
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,390
It is.

92
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,190
Oh, it says that...

93
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,630
Are we gonna talk in the game?

94
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,410
It says she's in the game.

95
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,950
Do you want to talk in the game or do you want to talk?

96
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,650
talk here.

97
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,910
Talking real live.

98
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,550
Talking the game or talking real live.

99
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,910
Oh, my mic is... I can turn on push to talk or whatever.

100
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, give, give.

101
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,930
I just turned off the audio.

102
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,130
Oh, you guys want to be...

103
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,150
I'm going to be old.

104
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,710
I'm going to be an old dude.

105
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,530
Oh, my God.

106
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,070
This guy is shaking.

107
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,510
I've got Arthur right.

108
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,030
Uh-oh.

109
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,390
Sorry.

110
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,910
The invite is not working.

111
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,990
Wait, I'm going to quit the game and restart the game.

112
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,310
It says, yeah, because it says that you're in here.

113
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:22,950
It does?

114
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,830
Oh, does it?

115
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,370
Oh, maybe I should.

116
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:26,690
Oh, no.

117
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,470
And then now it's gone.

118
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,370
Okay, okay.

119
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:28,730
Okay.

120
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,370
Let me try.

121
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,330
Let me try.

122
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,330
Wait, hold up.

123
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,150
How did you guys switch your avatar?

124
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,710
I'm still listening.

125
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,490
I've always been.

126
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,750
It's like the left and right on the bottom of your character.

127
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,730
Like the arrows.

128
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,530
The less than greater than.

129
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,490
You went to college.

130
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,690
Did I?

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,970
Did you?

132
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,570
Did I?

133
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,650
I did.

134
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,410
I certainly did.

135
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,650
There's in-game.

136
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,690
Let me actually, let me see if it's the game registered that I bought.

137
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,290
Hold up.

138
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,490
I forgot to cover my screen.

139
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,410
Maybe it's me.

140
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,550
Maybe I'm gonna, should I leave?

141
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,510
Oh, it's...

142
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,710
Did I kick everyone out?

143
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,970
Yeah, I kicked everyone out.

144
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,570
No!

145
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,610
Oops!

146
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,170
Okay, um, should I...

147
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,710
Should I try hosting or does someone else want to try hosting and inviting everyone?

148
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,230
Let me try.

149
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,330
Would that work?

150
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,950
Yes.

151
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,290
Yes.

152
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,170
Okay, I'm able to make a- Okay.

153
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,790
I think you just- Oh, joy.

154
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,810
Ah!

155
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,090
Oh!

156
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,610
What the hell?

157
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,230
Here!

158
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,570
Oh my god!

159
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,970
Oh!

160
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,430
Oh, I changed me.

161
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,410
Oh, I have to be an old lady.

162
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,990
Why- oh, you're the- You're the driver, Duska!

163
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,170
Oh god!

164
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,030
You can tell that to Babo.

165
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,350
He will lose his mind!

166
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,130
Wait!

167
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,910
He says I'm terrible at driving.

168
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,550
Who's the best driver here?

169
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,630
How many of us can drive?

170
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,930
I can drive!

171
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,850
I can drive?

172
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,250
Oh, it's only me?

173
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,970
Oh, yeah, you're Echo, you're Double.

174
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,730
Am I?

175
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,730
Double-oo.

176
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,910
Yeah, Double-oo.

177
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,170
Oh my god, you're so cute.

178
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,250
Get in the car, shiny!

179
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,690
Wait, is it only me that's double-ing?

180
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,270
Am I doubled?

181
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,130
Yes.

182
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,010
I am?

183
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,190
Yes.

184
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,150
Oh, what?

185
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,650
Oh, no, I think...

186
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,790
Mogus doubled?

187
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,470
Am I doubled now?

188

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,880

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
Don't let me customize the car.

250
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
You lied to me, kid.

251
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,460
You give me these options.

252
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:51,700

253
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,360
Lame.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,720
Okay, it says level select.

255
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, we can play Evening at Grandma's or Neil Peel's Deals on Wheels.

256
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,160
Has anyone played this game?

257
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,080
Do we know what we're doing?

258
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,940
I got no idea.

259
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,920
I think that's the best part, right?

260
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,420
Yeah, we gotta discover how to drive together.

261
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,100
Yeah!

262
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,860
Okay, you guys ready?

263
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,980

264
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,180
Let's try this out.

265
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,460
Oh, it's spooky.

266
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,020
Oh, my God.

267
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,620
Oh, my God.

268
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,200
What?

269
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,880
What are we hearing?

270
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,040
What the heck?

271
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,660
Is that you?

272
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,180
Is that me?

273
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,760
Instead of rushing us out the door, Grandma and Grandpa had us all crowded around the TV.

274
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,960
Oh my gosh, it's so scary.

275
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,980
They'd heard about it, Bingo Hall.

276
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
They were in awe.

277
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,480
A sweaty local car salesman was blowing their minds with his latest no-catch government-funded offer.

278
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,920
Oh, mucho texto.

279
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,420
Wow.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Oh my god.

281
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,780
Holy crap!

282
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,540
Jesus, why aren't you dyslexic to read this?

283
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,840
Oh, who skipped it?

284
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,140
Oh my god, skipped it!

285
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,700
I think I accidentally skipped it.

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll go down.

287
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,060
That's okay.

288
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,580
Right, right, right, space.

289
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,960
Oh, I'm- it's so wobbly.

290
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm gonna get so sick.

291
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,340
I'm so- I'm so old.

292
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,040
Who's next to me?

293
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,740
Who are you?

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
Oh, I'm in the middle.

295
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm in the middle seat.

296
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,460
You're in the middle?

297
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,580
Hi!

298
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,660
This is me, so neat.

299
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,820
Are you guys all in the back?

300
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, I guess I'm driving.

301
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,980
Yeah, you're driving.

302
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:55,060

how do I move?

304
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:07,800
I think one of the options is that if you go into options and then press gameplay and then center interact, I think it helps with the motion sickness.

305
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,060
So I said gameplay center interact on?

306
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, center interact on.

307
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,880
Why is it getting so steamy in here?

308
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,460
Oh my god.

309
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh my god.

310
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,480
Oh my god.

311
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,880
It's like that scene in Titanic.

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,700
Yeah.

313
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh, I think we're on fire.

314
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,180
We're on fire.

315
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,580
We haven't even started the game.

316
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,300
I can't even see.

317
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,420
I don't even know.

318
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,340
Go.

319
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,020
E.

320
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,620
I can't see anything either.

321
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh.

322
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,860
Oh my god.

323
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,700
I think I'm going.

324
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,300
I don't know.

325
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,420
I can't see.

326
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
I can't see anything.

327
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
We died?

328
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,160
No.

329
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,060
This might be hell.

330
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,780
This might be hell, actually.

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:05,040
I can't see I'm just in spots Oh, we switched spots somehow I'm all I can't see Wait, are we actually dying?

332
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,600

333
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,260
Can you pat yourself?

334
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:11,740
Roll?

335
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,620
It's cloudy in here I can't see Why is there teeth?

336
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,500
What was that?

337
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh my god I forgot to stay real Uh-oh.

338
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,440
What's going on?

339
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,280
Oh!

340
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,560
Grandma, what are you doing?

341
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,620
Come on.

342
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,060
I don't know.

343
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,920
I don't know.

344
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,500
I think I have dementia.

345
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,820
Turn the air down.

346
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,780
I think that's why it's foggy.

347
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,100
Oh, turn the air down.

348
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,580
Oh.

349
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh, shit.

350
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,680
Oh, my God.

351
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,860
I can see it again.

352
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,980
I can see it again.

353
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,060
Vogu, are you okay?

354
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,900
Oh, it's cold.

355
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,880
The physically would just let me move.

356
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,520
How am I supposed to get- Why am I derogating?

357
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,280
Who's that dude?

358
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,960
Why are you- Oh, I've got it.

359
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,600
I got it.

360
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,080
I got it.

361
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Okay.

362
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,340
Why did- Oh, I switched these.

363
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Awesome.

364
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,980
Hi, Oima.

365
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm on fire.

366
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,300
I can't see.

367
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,640
I think you're still in the parking lot.

368
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,820
It says to go for her.

369
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah, I think you're- Can you reverse?

370
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,060
It says go break and that's it.

371
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:31,000

Oh, maybe you have to reverse and then turn right.

439
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,050
There's no reverse.

440
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,110
Oh.

441
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,350

Why am I driving?

463
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,810
This is not helping my Asian situation.

464
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,730
I'm just...

465
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,370

Okay.

467
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,490
This is not helping the stereotype.

468
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,490
Okay, reverse a little bit.

469
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,830

Oh, come on the first.

475
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,630
That's where I was.

476
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,250
Girl, enjoy the cutscene.

477
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,070
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

478
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,990

480
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,590
Okay, stop.

481
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,530
And then go a little forward.

482
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,910
A little forward.

483
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,650
Okay.

484
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,370
Yeah.

485
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:07,890
A little forward.

486
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,270
Just a little bit.

487
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,350
Just a little bit.

488
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,230
Like this?

489
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,050

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,030
Yeah, turn left.

498
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,490
Turn left.

499
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,150
No, no, no, no.

500
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,430
Keep going!

501
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,810
Keep going!

502
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,310

505
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,730
Oh, jeez.

506
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,410
Why are you turning the light on?

507
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,010
Why are you turning the light on, grandma?

508
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,350
It's not gonna help you see better.

509
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,310
I didn't turn the light on.

510
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,270
Can you not back on?

511
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:48,810
Oh, no, you can.

512
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,090
You can.

513
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,230
Okay, good, good, good.

Okay, yeah, yeah.

516
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,710
Yeah, if we can figure out how to drive the I see nothing.

517
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,730
I'm in the...

518
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,370
Do you mean?

519
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,030
I'm underneath the car right now.

520
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,590
Where is Mint?

521
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,530
Where's my wife?

522
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,810
She's looking in the box.

523
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,650
Oh, here I am.

524
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,650
Oh, there I go.

525
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,630
Oh, there you go.

526
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,790
There you go.

527
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,670
Oh, thank you!

528
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,290
Are you guys back?

529
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,250
Yeah, I'm back.

530
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,470
Oh, what's that?

531
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,590
There you go.

532
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,010
Okay, where do I go now?

533
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,570
The right?

534
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,650
Um, we're still back up a little bit?

535
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,070
The left or the right?

536
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,010
Um, go to the right.

537
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,530
Oh, oh, you guys wanted to go there?

538
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,830
Yeah, there's arrows.

539
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,970
Where's the arrow?

540
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,590
Oh, I was just saying- My bet, my bet, my bet.

541
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,870
Turn the reverse.

542
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,170
I was just saying go anywhere.

543
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,870
Man, this is how you see when you draw.

544
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,290
I can't see shit.

545
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,190
What?

546
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,570
Oh, okay, go straight.

547
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,450
Why am I taking strays?

548
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,910
You can't be taking strays if you're also in the car with me.

549
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,730
Wow, I hope these people have insurance.

550
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,290
And then...

551
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,830
Turn left!

552
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,770
Turn left!

553
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,390
90 degrees.

554
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

What's this do?

629
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,890
Nothing, okay, that might be park.

630
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,070
Okay.

631
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,230

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,090
Oh, you need to go right.

633
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,130

Right.

635
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,630
Yeah, you have to get up a little.

636
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,070
Back up a little?

637
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,170
All right, yeah, you're literally like ramming into another car.

638
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,470
That's fine, they'll cover it.

639
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,230
Are you guys cold?

640
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,870
Go straight.

641
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:45,630
Oh.

642
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,830
Yeah, just a little bit.

643
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,130
A little chilly.

644
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,290
Oh my God, oh my God.

645
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,310
I don't want to see that happening.

646
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,870
Oh, how do I turn the...

647
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,050
Oh!

648
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,170
Wait, why am I driving?

649
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,930
Oh my god!

650
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,730
If you click the yellow thing next to the steering wheel, it changes person, it looks like.

651
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,230
Oh, the keys?

652
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:05,870
Yeah!

653
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,590
I'm on fire.

654
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,750
Yeah, why are you on fire?

655
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,670
Yeah, you are fire because you're so hot.

656
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,010
Girl, that's exactly how you use this.

657
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:16,910
Yeah, I know.

658
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,050
I want one trick wonder.

659
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,770
Oh, there we go.

660
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,530
There we go.

661
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,270
Wait, who's driving?

662
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,030
I'm driving.

663
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,590
I'm driving.

664
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:23,970
Go!

665
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,910
Go straight!

666
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,950
Go straight!

667
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,690
Wait, who's this?

668
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,210
Who is this?

669
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,870
I'm in the middle.

670
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,470
Who are you?

671
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,090
Who are you?

672
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,050
Oh, you need a coin.

673
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,370
Can we...

674
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,470
Oh, here's a coin, grandma.

675
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,250
Grandpa.

676
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,770
Sorry.

677
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,030
Thank you.

678
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,010
Thank you, Sonny.

679
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,110
Oh, okay.

680
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,490
Sonny.

681
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,530
You're welcome.

682
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,350
I like how he's holding it with both of his hands.

683
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,530
How do I pay?

684
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,250
Oh, look at him.

685
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,610
He's so gentle with it.

686
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,390
How do I pay?

687
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,290
On the right, I think.

688
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,270
On the...

689
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,890
Do I just eat the coin out?

690
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:53,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

691
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,630
They'll pick it up.

692
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,130
Yeah, why not?

693
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,450
They'll understand what it means.

694
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,170
Okay, I did it.

695
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,770
Does that work?

696
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,770
No, I'm flooring it.

697
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,930
I think it's on the right.

698
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,810
There's like a toll thing on the right, I think.

699
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,770
Oh, no.

700
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,770
Oh.

701
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,150
I don't see it.

702
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,970
I can kind of see it.

703
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,390
Can you hear the skull?

704
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,130
Let me roll down the window.

705
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,490
Oh, that, and I rolled that up.

706
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,310
Okay.

707
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,170
Am I reversing?

708
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,150
No.

709
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,290
Let me see.

710
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,990
Now, yes you are.

711
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:24,750
Oh, oh.

712
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,510
Now you are.

713
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,110
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I see it.

714
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,950
It's right there.

715
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,170
Oh, I saw it.

716
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:29,690
Okay, okay.

717
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,090
Where is it?

718
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,590
Oh, I can do it.

719
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,210
I can do it.

720
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,930
Oh, nice.

721
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,970
Give a coin.

722
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,030
Who has a coin?

723
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,910
I don't have one.

724
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,150

Wait, can you reverse it?

894
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,120
A little bit.

895
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,560
Maybe.

896
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,140
A little bit.

897
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,200
Yeah, reversal if it's close to the plate.

898
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,100
I think we're too far maybe.

899
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,900
It doesn't look like it's going that far.

900
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,640
I feel like something must be missing.

901
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,860

Yeah.

907
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,800
The windows roll down, right?

00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,820
Down, it's down.

909
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,120

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,360
Like that?

911
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,600
Like this?

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,800
Oh, that's pretty good, that's...

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,980
Is that good?

914
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,760
I can't get the coin.

915
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,280
Oh, it's by you.

916
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,800

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,360

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,100
Yeah, yeah.

920
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,560

Where does this land?

957
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,560
Like a coin gold.

Uh, wait.

959
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,820

Okay, we're just...

964
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,220
Are we reversing or how is this?

965
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,680
You have to, we're sideways.

966
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,020
We're facing right at the coin thingy.

967
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,940
Yeah, the coin machine.

968
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,060
Why won't it reverse?

969
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,480
Reverse?

970
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,160
Why won't- You have to switch the Prindle.

971
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:17,840
Oh!

972
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,820
This is- no, this is forward.

973
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Okay.

974
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,660
What's a Prindle?

975
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,080
That's what it's called.

976
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,220
That's what it's called, yeah.

977
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,300
That's what it's called!

978
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,280
What's a Prindle?

979
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,620
P-R-D-L.

980
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,060
P-R-O-O-O-O.

981
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,300
P-R-N-D-L.

982
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,680
P-R-N-D-L.

983
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,520
Wait, hold up.

984
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,480
It's closer to, um, Dusty.

985
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,580
It's close to Dusty.

986
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,740
Where are we?

987
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,560
Oh!

988
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,280
I'll be facing backwards though, no?

989
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,460
Did- I don't think I can make that.

990
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,340
Hold on, kids.

991
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,420
Hold on, kids.

992
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,260
Hold on.

993
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,560
Grandma, please.

994
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,360
I'm turning our hazards on.

995
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,940
Oh, nice.

996
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,340
Oh, oh, oh.

997
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,280
How do I get?

998
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
How do you go?

999
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,440
Okay.

1000
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,520
This way.

1001
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,320
It's harder to look, right?

1002
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:04,880
This way.

1003
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,720
I'm going to floor it.

1004
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,220
Floor it.

1005
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:08,600
Oh.

1006
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,340
Okay.

1007
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,000
Ran to a wall.

1008
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,240
It's okay.

1010
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:11,640
It's okay.

1011
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,380
We got this.

1012
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,960
We got this.

1013
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,120
Okay.

1014
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,720
We got this.

1015
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,460
Reverse.

1016
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,820
It's the five-point turn.

1017
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:19,680
Legend.

1018
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,700
We're like sandwiched in between cars.

1019
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,620
Oh, no!

1020
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,800
Yeah, you're...

1021
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,860
You're sandwiched between, like, literally a car and a wall.

1022
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,700
Yeah!

1023
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,220
Oh, gosh, okay.

1024
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,500
You had to do that thing where you had to move forward, then back up, then move, then forward, then back up.

1025
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,040
Yeah.

1026
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,020
Okay, we might be going backwards, but it's just believe.

1027
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,260
Oh, hold on.

1028
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,360
Oh, you made a U-turn?

1029
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,220
Oh, my gosh.

1030
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,340
Okay, we're fine.

1031
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,900
Get back there.

1032
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,580
Yeah, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1033
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,760
I know how to do this.

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,360
Okay.

00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,210
If you try to leave without paying except in the invoice.

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,150
I'm okay with committing crimes.

1105
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:10,770

They'll never.

1108
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,290
They'll never catch me.

1109
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,450

1110
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:16,810

1111
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:17,690

Okay, we're going way back.

1162
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,330
We're going back into the garage.

1163
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:13,530

1164
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,770

1169
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,650
Yeah, what are we running over?

1170
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:22,950

1171
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:23,630
Why are you so bumpy?

Oh, that's not backwards.

1192
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,570
That's not backwards.

1193
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,170
We're back to where we love these cars.

1194
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,370
Okay.

1195
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,750

And then go right.

1211
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,850
Right, right.

1212
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:43,910
You, right.

1213
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,330
You're fine.

1214
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,090
You got to.

1215
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:47,790
Which way are we supposed to go?

1216
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,670
To the right.

1217
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,870
There's a- oh wait, but there's arrows pointing left.

1218
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,110
Maybe that's for the other side when we get out of this door.

1219
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,010
Oh, I think you're right.

1220
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:57,650
I think you're right.

1221
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,350
Where are we even trying to go?

1222
00:48:59,490 --> 00:48:59,650
Oh, no.

1223
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,510
It says right.

1224
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,030
It says come on in.

1225
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,590
Drive through the doors.

1226
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,550
Drive through the door.

1227
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,250
Where?

1228
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,010
Okay.

00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:07,650
Right, right, right.

00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,530
Right, right.

00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,810
I don't know where we're going.

1281
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:38,690
I can't see shit.

1282
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,610
It's cold in this car.

1283
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,350
I'm frozen.

1284
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,330
Grandma, turn on the heat.

1285
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,550
Grandma, turn on.

1286
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,970
Grandma, put me back in the back seat.

1287
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,190
She's just gonna get colder.

1288
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:50,870
Oh, hell yeah.

1289
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:51,250
Oh, fire.

1290
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,090
The best way to melt the ice is with fire.

1291
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:01,190
Uh, your grand, one of your grandkids are, you're stepping on your grandkids right now.

1292
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,970
Oh, geez.

00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:05,190
Oh.

1296
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,170
Oh my god.

1297
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,670
Oh my god.

1298
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,490
Guys, the pedal came off.

1299
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,250
It's hell.

1300
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,170
I'm slipping out of the car, grandma, please.

1301
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,410
I'm out of the door.

1302
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,830
Grandma, I'm clipping out of the house.

1303
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,070
I'm clipping out of the house.

1304
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:26,250
I'm clipping out of the house.

1305
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,010
Oh, I swear I got this.

1306
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:31,640
What is happening?

1307
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,930
Oh, are we not going the right way?

1308
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,390
Oh, I don't know.

1309
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,590
Oh you're so close, you gotta go to the right.

1310
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:41,990
You gotta go to the right.

1311
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,230
Get out of the way.

1312
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,170
Who's this?

1313
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:44,910
Get out of the way.

1314
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,510
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

1315
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,910
You did it, you didn't revive her.

1316
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,750
You did it revive?

1317
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,130
Yeah, you just threw her on the slide.

1318
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,290
What am I supposed to do with you?

1319
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:56,810
Right.

1320
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,410
You're dragging my cord.

1321
00:52:59,250 --> 00:52:59,690
Did you survive?

1322
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,730
Okay, now back up and go to the right.

1323
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:03,790
We go right.

1324
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:04,530
The right.

1325
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,770
Now go to the right, yeah.

1326
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,290
Go to the right, floor it.

1327
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,610
Why do you floor it everywhere?

1328
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,490
You have to commit.

1329
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,510
You have to commit.

1330
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,950
Go, go, go, go.

00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,110
Okay, wait.

1332
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,850
Maybe the magazines are in our way.

1333
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,750
Okay, yeah, it's back up a little bit and then...

1334
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,490
It's kind of hard to see with all the fire.

1335
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,350
Why are you still burning?

1336
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:25,830

1366
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Yeah, I think so.

00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,440
Wait, how do I...

1539
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,700
Wait, are you saying that we should go left or right, Moku?

00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,220
Wait, this way.

00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,320
We go left?

1542
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,120

1543
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:00,860

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,820
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:02,500
Okay.

1546
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,260
We're literally in front of the showroom.

1547
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,380
Yeah, I'm going in.

1548
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,160
I crashed into it, but nothing happened.

1549
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,780
We gotta go in.

1550
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,800
We gotta go in.

1551
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,420
I never get a new car.

1552
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,760
It's almost Black Friday.

1553
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,380
Whoa!

1554
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:16,840

00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,280
I think we're fine.

1558
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:20,760
We're fine.

1559
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,520
We're fine.

1560
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,100
We're alive.

1561
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,040
Are we supposed to go in the front desk?

1562
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,440
Whoa.

1563
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,080
Sorry.

1564
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,480
Oh, I think so.

1565
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,520
Yeah, I think so.

1566
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,420
Looks like it.

1567
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,780
We go.

1568
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,080
Right.

1569
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,740
The right, yeah.

1570
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,760
No, right now you're hitting like a white van.

1571
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,960
Yeah, they're fine.

1572
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,560
They won't.

1573
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:36,940
They won't.

1574
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,500
They won't, no.

1575
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,720
It'll fluff out.

1576
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,740
It'll be, I'm going to leave.

1577
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,340
Yeah, yeah.

1578
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,580
It'll be fine.

1579
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,120
It'll be fine.

1580
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,240
I'm gonna leave the OIMO information there so that you can contact me.

1581
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,360
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

1582
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,860
Excuse me.

1583
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:47,480
Yeah, yeah.

1584
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,420
OIMO will have OIMO take care of it.

1585
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,200
Wait, I don't know.

1586
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,080
That's the point.

1587
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:54,900
Wait, wrong way.

1588
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,480
Oh my gosh.

1589
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,640
How embarrassing.

1590
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,680
I think you do have to crash into it.

1591
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,140
Okay.

1592
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:00,920
Floor it, grandma.

1593
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,860
Floor it!

1594
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,220

1595
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,040

01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1597
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,480
Wait, where am I?

1598
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,120
Sonny, help.

1599
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:09,640
Oh.

1600
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,100
Oh.

1601
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,660
Are we it?

1602
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,960
Look at my child!

1603
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:18,700
Where'd you go?

1604
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,560
Wait, I don't know how to get you back!

1605
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,600
Oh, you can throw them.

1606
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,740
You can throw them to the back seat.

1607
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,080
No, I can't.

1608
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:28,480
I don't know.

1609
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,300
I can't reach them.

1610
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,400
All right.

1611
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,640
Wait, who was that?

1612
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh, you're back.

1618
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:37,880
What happened?

1619
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,540

you reverse in to the showroom.

1622
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,580
You might be able to reverse in trying.

1623
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,720
It's like a hard left.

1624
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,720
Hard left?

1625
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:15,380
Reverse.

1626
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,460

Whoa, wait, no, no.

1630
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,320

Okay, everyone's fine.

1632
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,020
Floor it backward.

1633
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:29,820
Floor it backward.

1634
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,140
Okay.

1635
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:31,260

01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:31,840
Yeah, floor it.

1637
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,700

Imagine that you're reversing into a parking spot that's on your left.

1643
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,480
Wait, what?

1644

Just reverse, but like imagine the parking spot is on your left.

1645
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,380

01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:51,940
Oh, you got it?

1825
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:52,400
Okay.

1826
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:52,920
Back up.

1827
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,220
Back up a little bit.

1828
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,020
Tiny bit.

1829
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,980
Are you good?

1830
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,260
Where is it?

1831
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,040
Oh, so keep going.

1832
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,580
Keep going.

1833
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:01,900
Just a little bit more.

1834
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,480
Keep going.

1835
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,220
Just a little bit more.

1836
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:04,560
Stop!

1837
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,000
Yeah,

1838
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,640
you need to go forward, Grandpa.

1839
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,860
My princess!

1840
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,000
I love how they don't even...

1841
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,480
Oh, wait, we're going back inside.

1842
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,680
We're going back inside.

1843
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:24,380
Okay.

1844
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,740
Oh, this is where my life ends.

1845
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,700
This is where life ends.

1846
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,340
Go to the right a little bit, maybe.

1847
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,640
Oh, yeah, we're gonna hit a wall.

1848
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:38,520
Okay, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right.

1849
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,940
No, go right.

1850
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,940
Someone's outside the car.

1851
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,540
That's me.

1852
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,100
Okay, you can put me back out.

1853
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:49,700
Yeah, thank you.

1854
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,600
Yeah, are you guys all back in?

1855
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,820
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

1856
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,440
Like, what kind of right?

1857
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,480
Hey, my Prindal is off.

1858
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,920
Push the Prindal.

1859
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,040
Oh, you have to put it back on.

1860
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:00,920
Oh, I got it.

1861
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,220
I got it.

1862
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,440
Put it on yourself, Grandpa.

1863
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,040
Come on, you have an engineering degree.

1864
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,520
don't you?

1865
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,800
Has engineering even like developed when you were like?

1866
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,680
Girls in STEM!

1867
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,620
Girls in STEM!

1868
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:13,440
Okay.

1869
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,020
We love girls in STEM.

1870
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,300
Alright, hard right.

1871
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,060
Hard right.

1872
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,820
Hard as hard as you can go.

1873
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:22,920
You just have to go right.

1874
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:23,940
Oh, okay, good, good.

1875
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1876
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,160
No, too hard, too hard, too hard.

1877
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,840
Okay, now to the left, to the left.

1878
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,360
To the left, left, left.

1879
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,040
Take it back now, y'all.

1880
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,980
Still left this time.

1881
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,920
Just go straight.

1882
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,180
Okay, okay, okay.

1883
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,300
Slowly.

1884
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,560
Not slowly, forward.

1885
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:42,760
Okay, fast.

1886
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,320
Right, right, go right!

1887
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:48,240
Oh my god!

1888
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,540
One hour!

1889
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,300
It took us one hour!

1890
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,700
It took us one hour!

1891
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,040
Oh my god!

1892
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,600
It took us an hour!

1893
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,520
We got it!

1894
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,920
Only 22 bumps?

1895
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,820
I don't believe that.

1896
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,320
What is that?

1897
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,000
A cane?

1898
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,040
A new spindle?

1899
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,500
That's a sick spindle.

1900
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,660
It's the prindle.

1901
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,400
Prindle!

1902
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,160
I can't believe we did it.

1903
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,400
We never park anymore.

1904
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,480
We just go straight.

1905
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:20,740
The spindle.

1906
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,200
He's gotta go fast.

1907
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,600
The mint carried hard.

1908
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:25,780
I know.

1909
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:26,960
No.

1910
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,520
Mint was like the best driver.

1911
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,720
I never expected that.

1912
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,320
I'm pretty good at driving.

1913
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,020
I've never had a ticket or an accident.

1914
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,220
Oh my god, save him.

1915
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,340
I'm pretty good.

1916
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,660
I took my riding exam eight times before I passed.

1917
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:47,040
Oh, well, the first time I took my driving exam, I drove on the wrong side of the road.

1918
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,320
So maybe I am pretty good at this game.

1919
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:52,600
Yay!

1920
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:53,860
Yeah!

1921
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,000
Okay, I guess we go next.

1922
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,720
Yeah, let's go.

1923
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:00,380
What?

1924
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,760
What is this Simlish going on?

1925
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,840
Wasn't it in English?

1926
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,820
Yeah, I think it was.

1927
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,300
It was originally right.

1928
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,460
What's happening?

1929
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,940
Oh, what's the stomach is that?

1930
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,640
Sorry, guys.

1931
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,640
I had a Chipotle for lunch.

1932
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,040
Oh, whoa.

1933
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:21,660
Whoa.

1934
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,900
Where are we going?

1935
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,180
Traffic time.

1936
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:28,560
Oh, we do have a new spindle.

1937
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,660

Spindle.

01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,980
Oh, there's a tape in your mouth.

01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:33,940

No, that's a tree.

1956
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,370

1957
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,190

Oh wait, it wants me to revert.

01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,870

Reverse a little bit.

1979
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:34,550
There's a psychiatric clinic for big thinkers.

Like this?

1985
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:44,830

01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,110
I'm backing up.

1994
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,570
Wait, which way did we come from?

1995
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:00,650
We want to go to the right.

1996
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:01,890
Yeah, we kind of want to go to the right.

1997
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:03,150
The right.

1998
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:07,050
Is that blood on mine on the windshield?

1999
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,170
Grandma, are you here to collect insurance?

01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,790
So close!

2006
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:23,990
Wait, wait, this is good!

2007
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:25,230
This is good!

2008
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:27,150
Go, go, go!

2009
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,310
Go, go, go!

2010
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:32,370
Wait, um, we're gonna get...

2011
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:32,610
Wait, wait!

2012
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:40,050
Alright, now, floor it!

2013
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,380
Floor it!

2014
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:45,040
We were so close.

2015
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,380
Oh, are we really?

2016
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,120
That's gonna be fun after this.

2017
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,020
I dropped my phone.

2018
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:58,760
We're playing like the most intense frog or ever.

2019
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,460
Oh wait, you should wait one.

2020
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,880
Alright, and...

2021
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,680
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2022
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,420
Wait, how?

2023
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:09,360
How?

2024
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,060
That one's tough.

2025
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:14,820
Okay.

2026
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,820
I think you can start exploring the preemptively.

2027
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:50,280
oh yeah i think you have to be like really preemptive like like start going a little bit and then start rubbing yeah oh well a little a little bit go like a tiny bit go i can't just let me go what's what's happening oh maybe we need to switch again i think i think after all oh no i'm I'm missing the pedals on the car.

2028
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,380
Oh, you have to put it back in.

2029
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,220
Oh, this is for the...

2030
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:55,640
What's this?

2031
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,140
I'm missing the pedals for the car.

2032
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,800
Oh, are you seeing it?

2033
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,680
I don't see it.

2034
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,420
Yeah, where's the pedals?

2035
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,540
Oh, there's one.

2036
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:02,900
Oh, I just saw it.

2037
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,440
Oh, I found a pedal off the...

2038
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,220
There you go, there you go.

2039
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:05,020
Where?

2040
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:05,700
That's a tape.

2041
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,140
Why is the music so silly?

2042
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:11,880
Oh, I found it.

2043
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,100
Yeah, I was right over there.

2044
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,200
Okay, ready?

2045
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,660
When can I go?

2046
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,020
Right after this.

2047
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2048
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:19,520
No.

2049
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,860
Wait, you can't even see the traffic?

2050
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,880
Oh, who farted!

2051
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,420
Oh, ew!

2052
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:27,940
Who did that?

2053
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,000
Ew, why is it stinky?

2054
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,840
Oh, they've...

2055
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,260
Roll the window down!

2056
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,760
Roll the window down!

2057
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,500
Ew, what's wrong with someone's stomach?

2058
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:37,980
Mogu is that you?

2059
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:39,700
Mogu!

2060
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,400
Mogu!

2061
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,680
Stop eating Chipotle, you know what it does to you.

2062
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,440
Dude, I'm about to share a room with you.

2063
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,180
No!

2064
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:50,340
Go?

2065
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,240
I can't help it!

2066
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:51,520
Yeah!

2067
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:52,540
We're going!

2068
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,400
We're going!

2069
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,060
Oh!

2070
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:54,800
Oh, wait.

2071
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,960
I think we need to go to the left or right maybe?

2072
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,140
Are we going to try it on the side?

2073
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:00,380
Yeah.

2074
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,740
I think we need to go to the left.

2075
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,840
The left, yeah.

2076
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:03,980
The right is on block.

2077
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:04,380
Yeah.

2078
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,660
Oh, back up?

2079
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:06,420
Yeah, yeah.

2080
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:06,860
Oh, sorry.

2081
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:07,900
There you go, Mogu.

2082
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:08,920
Oh, thank you.

2083
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,580
Back up!

2084
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:11,960
Back it up!

2085
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:13,680
I'm back into the...

2086
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,280
I think I'm stuck.

2087
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,320
Oh, no.

2088
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,500
Wait, no, you're not.

2089
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,300
Don't say that.

2090
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:18,640
Oh, God.

2091
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,600
I'm gonna roll the windows up before y'all dies.

2092
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,040
That's just how it is.

2093
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,280
I don't know where we are.

2094
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:30,980
I don't know.

2095
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,520
Who's yelling?

2096
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,280
Who's saying expletives?

2097
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,280
Someone have poop?

2098
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,020
I think I fucked.

2099
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:40,980
Huh?

2100
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,060
Oh, maybe you have to drive on top of the cars.

2101
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,300
I don't think so.

2102
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:46,820
There's...

2103
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,700
No, I think you go to the left.

2104
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,020
Okay, we have to back up.

2105
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:51,940
Yeah, we got to back up.

2106
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:52,560
Back up?

2107
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,040
Okay.

2108
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:53,980
Can we back up?

2109
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,180
Is this a front wheel or a back wheel drive?

2110
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,820
It's a no wheel drive.

2111
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,580
What's that supposed to mean?

2112
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,320
Okay, I'm going to gas it.

2113
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,300
Don't gas it, please.

2114
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:08,860
Okay.

2115
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,080
It's already pretty stinky in here.

2116
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,120
I think we might have to restart.

2117
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,420
How do you restart?

2118
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,020
Yeah, the set point.

2119
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2120
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:17,960
Oh, there we go.

2121
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,340
There we go.

2122
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:18,700
Okay.

2123
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,660
Okay, okay, okay.

2124
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,250
Oh, but you have to go forward again, yeah.

2125
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:22,720
Okay.

2126
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:23,680
Oh.

2127
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,630
If I can do it, you can do it.

2128
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:30,980
That's good.

2129
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,720
It's overkill.

2130
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:34,740
Okay.

2131
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:35,600
Okay.

2132
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,500
Yeah.

2133
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,640
Yeah, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2134
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:41,160
Oh.

01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,300
You're like my cat.

01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,600

Don't worry about it.

01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,500
No, I think it's left.

2147
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:27,680
No.

2148
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,180

01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,120
Yeah, left a little and then go straight.

2181
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:42,560
Like that?

2182
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:43,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2183
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:44,800
Good, good, good.

2184
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,440
Nice!

2185
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,660
Oh, hold up.

2186
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,660
We got another checkpoint, so I think we're going the right way.

2187
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,180
Oh, you're supposed to go into the park!

2188
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,600
Into the park!

2189
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,220
Yeah, back up.

2190
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,940
Pick me up!

2191
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,580
Oh my gosh, I'm in your lap!

2192
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,060
Oh my god, muah!

2193
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,800
Get back to you again.

2194
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,140
Again.

2195
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,420
Wait, how am I supposed to get back?

2196
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,140
No, no, you're about to back into the park, so you're doing pretty good.

2197
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,600
Okay, so do I back into the park or do I U-turn or like...

2198
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,280
Yeah, you can probably back in.

2199
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,260
You can back it in.

2200
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,200
For it.

2201
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,200
Pack that ass up.

2202
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,060
If I back it up, is it fat enough?

2203
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,820
No, you're moving a little though.

2204
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,500
You might be able to.

2205
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,660
Yeah, you might be able to.

2206
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:29,960
We're squeezing in.

2207
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,100
We're parallel parking.

2208
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,200
Oh, we're like going the wrong way.

2209
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,060
Oh, no, never mind.

2210
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,080
Whoa, actually.

2211
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,640
Okay, and then I could go straight, right?

2212
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,220
Turn it the other way.

2213
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:41,740
Ah, no.

2214
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,380

Back to your seat.

2252
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,540
I feel like you're the grandma from SpongeBob.

2253
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,060

2257
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,540

01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,620
Oh, did we?

2259
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,060
Let's go.

2260
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:47,920
That statue's right there.

2261
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,980
There's like something in front of it.

2262
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:52,440
Oh, yeah.

2263
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,680
There was like something glowing.

2264
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,020
Oh, whatever.

2265
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,200
Oh, oh, oh, nice.

2266
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:56,920

Oh, my gosh.

2270
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,600
Suddenly it feels like Katamari.

2271
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,060
I can't see anything.

2272
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,740
Am I there yet?

2273
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:07,780

2274
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,140

2275
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,140

01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:10,600

2284
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,100
Where?

2285
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:25,940

Oh my gosh, the way it spins too much.

The wheel spins too much when I back up.

2472
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,080

2473
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,360

And to your right.

2531
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:16,690
A little bit to your right.

2532
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:17,990
Okay, okay.

I feel like...

2537
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:28,830
Is it a collectible or is it for...

2538
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,450
To progress?

2539
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:30,210
I can't tell.

2540
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:33,650
I just think it's to progress because you have to put the money on top of the bag.

2541
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:34,810
Oh, yeah.

2542
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:35,830

01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:31,590
Oh, so close.

2560
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:33,210
We might be in my way.

2561
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:34,310
Okay.

2562
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,970
I can't reach it.

2563
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:35,610
I can't reach it.

2564
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:36,490
Oh, who is this?

2565
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:37,410
That's me.

2566
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,130
Oh, my God.

2567
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:39,110

Oh, get in the back with the rest of us.

2571
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:48,170
Oh, we're getting further away.

2572
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:49,870
Hmm.

2573
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:51,110
Right?

2574
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:53,490
No, I think it should back off a little.

2575
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:54,910
Where is it?

2576
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:56,610
Oh, we're getting farther away.

2577
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:57,070
Yeah.

2578
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:57,910

Back, back, back.

01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,010
You're good.

2582
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:03,850
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2583
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,710
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no.

2584
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,070
Hey, someone else died again.

2585
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:07,510
I'm outside the plumber.

2586
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:08,370
Don't worry about it.

2587
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:09,270
We need to get the money.

2588
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:10,770
Yeah, we need the cash.

2589
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:11,550
Don't care about.

2590
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:12,210
Oh, oh, oh.

2591
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:17,070
We literally wait, oh my gosh, wait if you back up we'll get it.

2592
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:17,910
We'll get it.

2593
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:27,350
Oh, just back up straight Oh, someone is someone laying the hawk is someone honking at us in the park?

2594
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:29,210
Like we're bad drivers.

2595
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:33,550
Oh, I wouldn't let me reverse.

2596
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:34,050
Okay.

2597
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:35,310
Oh, you're like right.

2598
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:39,810
Yeah, turn to your left actually if you turn if you go No, never mind.

2599
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:43,090
Yeah Let's make a sharp left.

2600
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:45,670
Super left and go straight.

2601
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:47,370
Oh.

2602
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:49,250
Not left enough, maybe.

2603
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:51,310
Wait, wait.

2604
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:54,970
Oh, I think we're actually upside down.

2605
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:55,770
Oh.

2606
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:57,630
Wait, what's happening?

2607
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:58,290
Are we still upside down?

2608
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,210
Yes, we are.

2609
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:00,530
Okay, there we go.

2610
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,990
Nice.

2611
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:01,910
Okay.

2612
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:02,630
Okay.

2613
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:04,770
Go straight and to your right.

2614
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:07,810
Okay.

2615
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,550
Oh.

2616
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:09,850
What's happening?

2617
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,250
You're in front of the statue.

2618
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:14,830
Oh, yeah.

2619
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:17,650
Okay, okay, I can't see.

2620
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,050
Come, Mojo, I believe!

2621
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:21,630
Come, Mojo, go!

2622
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:22,870
Oh, I can't close.

2623
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:23,970
Forward, go forward!

2624
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:26,410
Now floor it.

2625
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:27,830
Floor it forward.

2626
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:28,770
I don't see it.

2627
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:29,830
Yeah, you're doing great!

2628
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:30,470
You're doing great!

2629
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:31,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2630
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:34,070
Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

2631
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:35,830
Oh, it's so close.

2632
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:36,990
It's so close.

2633
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:37,310
It's so close.

2634
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:39,530
Is it in front of us or is it behind?

2635
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:41,350
It's in front, right?

2636
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:42,410
Yeah, it's in front.

2637
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,810
It's in front.

2638
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:43,590
It's in front of them.

2639
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:44,790
Just go forward a little bit.

2640
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:46,750
Like edge the engine.

2641
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:50,550
Oh, guys, I feel so good.

2642
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,090
Keep edging.

2643
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:51,810
Keep edging.

2644
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:52,730
Can you get it?

2645
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,130
Can you get it?

2646
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:53,950
I can't reach it.

2647
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:54,830
No, no, no.

2648
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:55,110
Oh, wait.

2649
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:56,210
Up, up, up, up, up.

2650
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,070
Back up a little tiny bit.

2651
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:58,510
Back up.

2652
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,970
Yeah.

2653
01:41:59,610 --> 01:41:59,950
Okay.

2654
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:02,730
Mokisa, so stressed.

2655
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:05,530
Okay, now forward, now forward.

2656
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,570
Just go straight.

2657
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,610
Okay.

2658
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,110
Straight into the right a little bit, I think.

2659
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:12,490
Okay, jade to the right.

2660
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:12,870
Yeah.

2661
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:15,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2662
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:16,570
Yeah, edge it.

2663
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:20,710
Oh, why can't I even- Oh, stop, stop!

2664
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:22,710
Wait, wait, I can't reach it!

2665
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:23,670
I can't reach it!

2666
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:26,590
I can't reach that, I can't reach it!

2667
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:27,070
No!

2668
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:28,430
I'm breaking!

2669
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:32,130
The fucking bench!

2670
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:32,890
Oh.

2671
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,190
Oh.

2672
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:34,790
Oh.

2673
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:35,690
What?

2674
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:37,750
What, what, what's next to it though?

2675
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:38,530
Yeah.

2676
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:42,370
Unless the game wants it to be like pixel perfect.

2677
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,230
That's crazy.

2678
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:44,630
Oh.

2679
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:46,770
Okay, we're going to drive out of here.

2680
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,550
I think there's an exit, right?

2681
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:51,030
There has to be.

2682
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:53,230
No way.

2683
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:54,710
Oh.

2684
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:57,870
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2685
01:42:58,190 --> 01:42:59,710
Can I get it from this way?

2686
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:00,790
It's like a drive-through?

2687
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,030
Hold up.

2688
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:01,550
What if you...

2689
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:02,270
Yeah, like a drive-through.

2690
01:43:02,430 --> 01:43:02,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2691
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,470
Oh, I can't reach.

2692
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:05,130
It's too far.

2693
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:07,150
It has to be so close.

2694
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:08,110
I can't reach it.

2695
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:11,490
coins at it?

2696
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:14,970
Oh, oh my god, what if you have to put the coin inside the...

2697
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:15,890
No way.

2698
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:17,030
No way.

2699
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:19,150
Okay, okay, okay, I think I...

2700
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,070
Just go forward, edge it.

2701
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:20,650
There's no way.

2702
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:22,810
Edge it?

2703
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,470
Stop, stop, stop it!

2704
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:25,930
You see it?

2705
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,750
Okay, a little bit more, just a little bit more.

2706
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:28,710
Can you grab it?

2707
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:30,430

There's like something collision in the background.

It's going crazy.

01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,610
Oh, there's the cars, I think.

Okay, back up to your left.

01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:36,770
Okay.

01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:49,490
Just straight up back up.

01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:50,410
And then stop?

2744
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:51,010
Oh, okay, okay.

2745
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:52,270
And then go forward.

2746
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:53,050
Just go forward.

2747
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:53,690
Straight.

2748
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:55,530
Uh, I don't know.

2749
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,950
Wait.

2750
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:56,630
Okay, wait.

2751
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:58,310
Straight in a little bit to your left.

2752
01:44:58,590 --> 01:44:59,890
And then... Okay.

2753
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:01,170
A little bit.

2754
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:01,830
Just a little bit.

2755
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:02,730
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2756
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:03,410
Keep going, keep going.

2757
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:03,730
Edge it.

2758
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:04,210
Edge it.

2759
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:05,510
Edge it.

2760
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:06,130
Edge it.

2761
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,790
Oh, you're so close!

2762
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,410
Let's go.

2763
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,190
Okay, stop!

2764
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:11,750
Stop!

2765
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:12,510
Stop!

2766
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:14,190
Stop!

2767
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:16,670
Okay, I took that.

2768
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:17,630
Moku's throwing.

2769
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:18,590
Oh!

2770
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:20,530
Oh!

2771
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:22,030
Moku, that throw is this for us!

2772
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:24,390
Oh no!

2773
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:27,190
Do you get it?

2774
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:28,870
No, no, no, no, no.

2775
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,430
I can't do it again, Moku.

2776
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:32,810
Go forward a little bit.

2777
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:33,690
Okay.

2778
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:36,070
Okay, one more.

2779
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:37,010
Just one more time.

2780
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:41,530
Okay, I'll- One more time and...

2781
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:42,550
Nope.

2782
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:43,750
One more time.

2783
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:45,410
Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop!

2784
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:46,430
Right here!

2785
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:47,090
Yeah!

2786
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:47,890
Yeah!

2787
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:51,130
Wait, what's happening?

2788
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:52,150
What's it doing?

2789
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:55,770
Oh, he broke it!

2790
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:57,930
He broke the gate, I think, back there.

2791
01:45:58,530 --> 01:45:59,170
Oh, yeah, he did!

2792
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:02,150
But what happened to the statue?

2793
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:05,530
I think it fell and, like, broke the...

2794
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:06,870
Oh, yeah.

2795
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:07,970
He, like, dashed.

2796
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:09,430
Oh, to the front!

2797
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:09,930
You're at the game!

2798
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:10,610
Right, right, right, right!

2799
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:12,050
Right, right, right, right, right!

2800
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:12,310
Hard, right?

2801
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:13,730
Uh...

2802
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:14,350
Right, edge it.

2803
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:15,550
I will, I will, uh...

2804
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,830
Why do you keep saying edgy?

2805
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:20,090
It seems to be working.

2806
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:22,990
Look here?

2807
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:23,610
Oh, oh!

2808
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:24,970
A little more, a little more, a little more.

2809
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:26,210
A little more, a little more, a little more.

2810
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:28,210
Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

2811
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:29,430
Go, stop, stop, stop!

2812
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:30,470
Go right, straight.

2813
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:33,030
Right, straight, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2814
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:34,770
Yeah, yeah.

2815
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:35,710
Okay, straight.

2816
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:38,010
No, you're gonna run into the wall.

2817
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:39,310
Yeah, a little bit.

2818
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,550
A little bit this way.

2819
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:41,790
So clear.

2820
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:42,750
Okay, back up.

2821
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:43,410
Okay.

2822
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:45,070
So, okay.

2823
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:46,410
Oh, I see it.

2824
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:47,750
Oh, you see it?

2825
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:48,110
You see it?

2826
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:49,070
Oh, no, no, I can't see it.

2827
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:49,930
Okay, I'm gonna.

2828
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:51,610
To the right a little and floor it.

2829
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:53,150
To the right a little and floor it.

2830
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:54,490
Oh, not enough to the right.

2831
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:55,530
We're gonna run it to the wall.

2832
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:57,830
Oh, oh.

2833
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,930
Oh, wait.

2834
01:46:59,290 --> 01:46:59,770
Uh-oh.

2835
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:00,650
Uh-oh.

2836
01:47:00,970 --> 01:47:01,370
Uh-oh.

2837
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:01,650
Uh-oh.

2838
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:04,710
It's always Mogu that gets us into this situation.

2839
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:05,990
Yeah, yeah.

2840
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:07,670
I don't...

2841
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:08,610
Oh.

2842
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:10,430
Um, you know what?

2843
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:11,630
I'm gonna do this.

2844
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:13,710
Okay.

2845
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:14,550
Oh, wait!

2846
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:15,130
We're out!

2847
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:15,630
We're out!

2848
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:16,350
Go for it!

2849
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:16,650
Floor!

2850
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:18,390
Go straight!

2851
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:19,270
Floor!

2852
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:20,730
Just go!

2853
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,050
Just go!

2854
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:23,490
Don't stop!

2855
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:24,570
Don't stop!

2856
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:26,250
Don't stop for anything!

2857
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:27,330
Just go!

2858
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:28,450
Don't stop!

2859
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:29,690
Just keep going!

2860
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:32,230
Okay, so close.

2861
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:33,870
Oh, oh, oh.

2862
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:34,130
Oh.

2863
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:37,070
At least that goes straight.

2864
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:37,710
No.

2865
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:38,070
No.

2866
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:40,550
Oh, right.

2867
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:43,090
Oh, wait.

2868
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:44,770
That's going to floor it.

2869
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:46,490
Go, go, go, go, left, left, left.

2870
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:47,430
Left, left, left.

2871
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,270
You ran over the cop.

2872
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:53,650
You ran over the cop.

2873
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:54,110
You ran over the cop.

2874
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:56,330
Okay, go right, go, no.

2875
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:56,890
Go straight.

2876
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:57,810
Go left.

2877
01:47:58,090 --> 01:47:59,190
Oh, God damn, he's dead.

2878
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:00,810
Someone died?

2879
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:01,970
Oh, nice.

2880
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:03,270
No, that's my body.

2881
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:04,170
Next to the cop.

2882
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:04,730
Oh, shit.

2883
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:05,890
Who's honking?

2884
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:07,790
Hey, who's honking at me?

2885
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:08,390
Hey, I'm driving here.

2886
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:09,110
I think it's the cop.

2887
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:10,950
It's grandpa.

2888
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:13,970
Wait, if you back up, you'll hit like five people.

2889
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:14,550
It'll be really...

2890
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:15,350
Oh, there they go.

2891
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:16,510
There they go.

2892
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:19,930
There they go.

2893
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:20,790
Mint!

2894
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:21,810
Yeah!

2895
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,230
Oh, we ran into a hole.

2896
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:25,350
Keep going?

2897
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:26,310
And we ran into a tree.

2898
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:28,270
Force it, force it, force it.

2899
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,330
Force it?

2900
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:32,550
Okay, a little bit to your left and then go straight.

2901
01:48:32,890 --> 01:48:32,970
Yeah.

2902
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,970
Okay, go straight, straight, straight, straight.

2903
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:36,550
Good, good, good, good.

2904
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,370
Go, go, go, go!

2905
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:38,910
Let's go!

2906
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,890
Let's go, let's go!

2907
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:42,010
Let's go!

2908
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:43,870
Oh my gosh, this is so beautiful!

2909
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:47,310
I'm gonna drive slowly so that we don't flip.

2910
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:48,790
Slow!

2911
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:52,770
Who cares about going slow?

2912
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,510
Oh, checkpoint!

2913
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:55,360

Ah!

2940
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,570

2941
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,430
Oh, it's hot.

2942

We're okay, team.

2946
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:30,110
Don't worry about it.

2947
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:31,930
We did.

2948
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:32,290
We did.

2949
01:51:32,710 --> 01:51:33,050
Yeah.

2950
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:34,230
Just this one left.

2951
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:34,810
Oh, whoops.

01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:35,870
Oh wait, you're back.

2953
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:37,870
Sometimes it puts you in reverse for some reason.

2954
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:38,470
Okay.

2955
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:40,390
Oh, oops, sorry.

2956
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:41,410
I tried breaking.

2957
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:43,730
The brake pads are like so bad now.

2958
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:45,670
Oops.

2959
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:46,770
We gotta get into this.

2960
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:47,910
We're on fire again.

2961
01:51:48,930 --> 01:51:50,970
Also, there's no brake pad because there's no brake.

2962
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:52,610
Yeah.

2963
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,310
Here's your brake.

2964
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:55,330
It's in, it's right here.

2965
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:57,390
Oh, that's why.

2966
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:58,630
Wait, can you throw it again?

2967
01:51:59,190 --> 01:51:59,930
I can't get it.

2968
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:00,970
I don't know where is it.

2969
01:52:00,990 --> 01:52:02,130
Oh, let me, let me get it.

2970
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:04,910
That's why I wasn't breaking.

2971
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:06,970
I'm trying to get it.

2972
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:08,650
I can't get it anymore.

2973
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:09,290
Oh, oops.

2974
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:11,310
Um, I'll just go straight then.

2975
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:12,550
Oh.

2976
01:52:15,150 --> 01:52:17,370
I love this version of frog.

2977
01:52:18,670 --> 01:52:19,330
I hate it.

2978
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:20,310
I don't know, I found the tunnel.

2979
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:21,650
It's up, it's right up there on the left.

2980
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:23,310
I can't get it.

2981
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:24,590
Oh, yeah, use the windshield wiper.

2982
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:26,370
Windshield wiper?

2983
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:27,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2984
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:29,410
Where are you?

2985
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:32,030
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

2986
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:33,070
Like, 720.

2987
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:34,690
Wait, oh, wait, that's the Prindle.

2988
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:36,670
Oh my gosh, I need to break you guys.

2989
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:37,590
I can't get it.

2990
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:38,450
Oh, right here, right here.

2991
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:41,370
Oh, I tossed it into the front seat.

2992
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,510
The front seat floor.

2993
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:43,330
The right seat.

2994
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:44,730
The passenger seat floor.

2995
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:45,930
I can't reach it.

2996
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:46,670
I can't see it.

2997
01:52:47,710 --> 01:52:48,530
Nope, that's a windshield.

2998
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:50,990
Or that's the window.

2999
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:52,710
Mintz is the lid.

3000
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:53,690
The lid.

3001
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:54,690
What lid?

3002
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:55,630
What are you talking about?

3003
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:58,010
What's the lid?

3004
01:52:58,230 --> 01:52:59,190
Oh, it's right there.

3005
01:52:59,470 --> 01:52:59,830
Oh, I see.

3006
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:01,790
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I see gravity.

3007
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:03,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3008
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:03,850
Throw it, throw it.

3009
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:04,490
Throw it.

3010
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:05,230
Oh, you're desperate.

3011
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:07,170
That's my teeth.

3012
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:09,290
There's a black thing.

3013
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:11,430
Okay.

3014
01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:13,690
Oh, oh, oh, wait, hold on.

3015
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:14,910
Oh, oh.

3016
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:15,970
You know what?

3017
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,210
We're just gonna...

3018
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:20,370
It'll toss it around until it comes back.

3019
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,630
Oh, I found it!

3020
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:22,150
It's like it!

3021
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:22,890
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3022
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:23,530
Oh my god!

3023
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:24,610
Wait, what is this?

3024
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:25,470
What is this?

3025
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:26,410
What is this?

3026
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:30,570
It's in the front seat, past it, like, from the floor.

3027
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:31,490
I thought that was it.

3028
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:32,470
I can't get it!

3029
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:34,150
That's my thingy that...

3030
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:34,790
I got it!

3031
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:35,370
Hold on!

3032
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:37,490
Oh, oh, I got it!

3033
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:37,910
I got it!

3034
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,250
I got it!

3035
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:38,930
Okay, okay, okay.

3036
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:40,270
Oh finally!

3037
01:53:40,510 --> 01:53:41,710
It's with the lights!

3038
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:44,290
Okay, tell me when to go.

3039
01:53:44,670 --> 01:53:45,710
Okay, good luck.

3040
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:47,310
This is the hardest one.

3041
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:50,290
Start now.

3042
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:52,670
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3043
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,010
Hold up.

3044
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:53,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3045
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,890
Hold up!

3046
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:57,470
We did it!

3047
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:59,150
Oh, okay, okay.

3048
01:53:59,410 --> 01:54:00,970
Okay, back up, back up, back up.

3049
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:01,950
This way.

3050
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:02,490
Yeah!

3051
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:04,410
Baby!

3052
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:06,330
Oops.

3053
01:54:06,970 --> 01:54:08,310
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

3054
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:08,790
Yeah, yeah, go!

3055
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,210
I'm insane!

3056
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,870
I'm insane!

3057
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:13,590
I'm insane!

3058
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:14,010
I'm insane!

3059
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:16,210
Are we going through the drive-through?

3060
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:18,110
There's a drive-through?

3061
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:19,950
Yeah, forward, right?

3062
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:20,850
Oh, right.

3063
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:23,450
What if I went inside?

3064
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:23,990
Okay.

3065
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:26,310
Hold on, you want chicken nuggets or what?

3066
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:27,790
I want chicken nuggets.

3067
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:29,750
Be patient.

3068
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:31,370
I will.

3069
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:34,950
Yep!

3070
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:36,070
Yeah!

3071
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:38,010
Wait, do I need to keep going back up?

3072
01:54:39,310 --> 01:54:39,650
A little bit.

3073
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:40,230
A little bit.

3074
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:41,070
And then right.

3075
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:42,330
Go right.

3076
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:44,230
A little bit and then go through the driveway.

3077
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:46,270
We gonna have chicken nuggets!

3078
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:47,030
Like this?

3079
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:48,650
Yep, keep going.

3080
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:49,310
Then go straight.

3081
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:51,810
Just like two steps.

3082
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:53,050
And then- Yeah, yeah, yeah, perfect.

3083
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:55,910
And then like- Now what?

3084
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:56,790
Forward and left?

3085
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:57,470
Left?

3086
01:54:57,910 --> 01:55:00,990
Oh my gosh, like we're actually going through- Oh my god.

3087
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:02,270
Oh my god.

3088
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:04,070
Oh my god.

3089
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:04,750
Checkpoint.

3090
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:05,390
Checkpoint.

3091
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:06,630
I want a little toy.

3092
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:07,170
Okay, perfect.

3093
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:07,610
Stop.

3094
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:09,830
Right?

3095
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:10,610
Right?

3096
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:11,650
No, go straight.

3097
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:12,090
Straight.

3098
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:12,650
Just go straight.

3099
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:12,970
Okay.

3100
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:16,830
Wait, where do we go in?

3101
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:17,430
What does it say?

3102
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:18,550
I'm so hungry.

3103
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:20,090
Drive through Slop!

3104
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:20,930
I see it!

3105
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:21,530
The Slop!

3106
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:21,990
Yay!

3107
01:55:22,050 --> 01:55:22,630
The Slop!

3108
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:24,190
Am I going still?

3109
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:24,950
Just like two steps.

3110
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:25,370
Two steps.

3111
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:26,010
Two steps.

3112
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:27,110
And then luck.

3113
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:28,130
And left.

3114
01:55:28,570 --> 01:55:29,150
Oh my god.

3115
01:55:29,490 --> 01:55:30,210
She's so good.

3116
01:55:30,570 --> 01:55:31,230
Oh my god!

3117
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:35,390
Order here!

3118
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:38,090
Oh, I see it!

3119
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:39,290
I see it!

3120
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:40,770
I see it!

3121
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:41,550
I see it!

3122
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:42,590
I see it!

3123
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:44,370
I can see it!

3124
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:44,770
I can see it!

3125
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:46,970
Oh my god, is that why we need the coins?

3126
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:47,490
Hello.

3127
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:49,550
I think someone needs to...

3128
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:49,950
Could I get a...

3129
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:50,950
It's up down?

3130
01:55:51,050 --> 01:55:51,970
Oh, oh, oh.

3131
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:54,070
Why does it look like a...

3132
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:54,390
Hello?

3133
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:58,010
I went up, I went down, I went left, and I went right.

3134
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:58,950
Do you...

3135
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:59,890
Do I pull up more?

3136
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:02,750
No, there's a car.

3137
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:05,310
Guys, order.

3138
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:05,990
Did you guys order?

3139
01:56:08,410 --> 01:56:08,810
Um...

3140
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:10,770
Why do you get him?

3141
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:12,950
Are we supposed to throw the coin?

3142
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,130
A coin at them?

3143
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:15,870
Or is there something else?

3144
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:16,670
I don't see anything.

3145
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:18,750
I could throw a coin too.

3146
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:24,190
Can I get some fries?

3147
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:26,210
I have some...

3148
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:27,010
You're the one who's driving.

3149
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,190
Oh yeah.

3150
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:30,230
No, it says pay here, like over there though.

3151
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:31,950
So I don't know if we're supposed to pay here.

3152
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:33,290
Hmm.

3153
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:34,670
Did I do it?

3154
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:36,090
I'm gonna swear at him.

3155
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:36,970
I'm Canadian.

3156
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:38,030
How do you swear?

3157
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:38,650
How do you swear?

3158
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:39,210
Where?

3159
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:40,750
A space bar?

3160
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:45,730
No, mine's telling me.

3161
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:49,120
Wait, wait.

3162
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:52,640
Um...

3163
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:54,480
I have a mixtape in my mouth.

3164
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,380
Get it off me, Grandma.

3165
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,040
Oh.

3166
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:03,160
Teach me how to swear!

3167
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:04,620
Oops!

3168
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,720
Oh, it needs to have the mixtape in your mouth.

3169
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:09,020
Here.

3170
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:09,940
Wait, you have to?

3171
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:11,680
Yeah, to swear.

3172
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:12,500
Yeah.

3173
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,140
No, I'm not there.

3174
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,440
How do you put it up?

3175
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:17,540
No, you need it in your mouth.

3176
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:18,240
What is this?

3177
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:19,760
But how did you put it in your mouth?

3178
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:20,800
Is this like a blinker?

3179
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,500
I think you have to shove it in.

3180
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,400
No, we don't need those.

3181
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:25,300
I need to shove it.

3182
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:27,140
The mint has to shove it into your mouth.

3183
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:29,080
What does this do?

3184
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:31,280
Maybe you have to be closer to the window to order.

3185
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:32,560
Do we?

3186
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:33,800
Do I have to back up?

3187
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:37,720
Back up straight and then make a slight left when you go forward.

3188
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:38,780
Yeah.

3189
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,160
Um, could I get a six piece nugget?

3190
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:44,120
Meal and do.

3191
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:46,040
Oh.

3192
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:47,180
Okay.

3193
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:48,600

3194
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:50,520
Oh, okay.

Oh, okay.

3196
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:51,960
Oh, okay.

3197
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:52,400
Okay.

3198
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:52,780
Oh, okay.

3199
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,880
Oh, wait, we can actually order.

3200
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:55,640
Oh, we can order.

3201
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:56,940

Oh, I'm feeding.

3203
01:57:58,720 --> 01:57:59,380
No, wait, wait, wait.

3204
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,660
Oh, chicken nugget.

01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,560

01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:04,720

All chicken nugget.

3212
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:09,520

Oh, we can?

3226
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,360
We didn't even let us get chicken nuggets.

3227
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,120
They didn't even let us get chicken nuggets.

3228
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:03,140
They said pull forward.

3229
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:04,560

3230
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,780
Okay, now it's Kobe.

01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,540

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Why can't it?

3242
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:44,400
It doesn't reach.

3243
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,480
Do we need to hand it to him?

3244
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,920
I think you just hand it to his hand.

3245
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,380
Okay.

3246
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:50,680
Where's the coin, though?

3247
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:51,680
Do we use all the coins?

3248
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:53,080
No, they respawn.

3249
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:53,620
They respawn.

3250
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,040
Oh, wait.

3251
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:54,900

02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,080
Where's the out?

3331
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:37,760
Oh, I see it.

3332
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:38,520
We have to back up.

3333
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:39,740
We have to back up.

3334
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:41,420
It's on our right.

3335
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,120
Or you're closer to reversing out.

3336
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:47,860
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3337
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:48,720

02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:51,640
There we go.

3341
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,000
Oh, we had a checkpoint.

3342
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,080
Oh, nice.

3343
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:56,140

02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,040
Oh, my God.

3345
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:57,280

3347
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:58,240
We're not done.

02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,600
Please, please, please let me leave.

3354
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:09,980
Put me out of this misery.

3355
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:11,220
Put me out of this misery.

3356
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:12,500

3357
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:13,000
Oh, trip.

3358
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,400
How is that the checkpoint?

3359
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:15,660
What are we supposed to do next?

3360
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,300
I think you're supposed to- It's just what's the last thing we need.

3361
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,200
What's the last thing we need?

3362
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:20,640
Oh, no, no, no.

02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:39,420
Go forward?

02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:41,400
I turn left.

3379
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,640
Oh yeah, there's a shortcut in the alleyway.

3380
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:45,200
That's not fast.

3381
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:46,760
Turn...

Wait, we have an engine!

3390
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:58,780

02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:40,640
There's a mixtape.

02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:41,920
Mixtape?

02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:43,200

02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:45,160
No, that's probably not.

02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:46,100
No, that's in the instructions.

3597
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:47,560
Where did the ticket go?

3598
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:48,940

02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,500
There's nothing in the glove compartment.

3607
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:11,220
Wait, uh, Dusty, when you threw in the coin, did it give you a ticket?

3608
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:12,580
I got no idea.

3609
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:15,700
It sounded like something happened, though.

3610
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:18,640
Should I back up and try again?

3611
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,180

3612
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,500

Ah, brakes.

4136
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:26,270
I think it's in the passenger floor seat, like floor.

4137
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:27,970
I can't reach that.

4138
02:36:28,310 --> 02:36:29,770
I'm not tall enough.

4139
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:33,910
Oh, just like press your, press the D key.

4140
02:36:34,610 --> 02:36:35,570

You just need to back up straight.

Just a little bit.

4147
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:48,990
Just a little bit.

4148
02:36:49,810 --> 02:36:50,610
And then I think it's right.

4149
02:36:51,550 --> 02:36:51,790
Stop, stop.

4150
02:36:52,050 --> 02:36:52,690
And then go right.

4151
02:36:54,850 --> 02:36:55,290

Yeah, I'm dead.

4181
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,450
Mint's been chilling.

4183
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:16,890

Yeah, I can't either.

4186
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:24,210
How do I go back to the checkpoint?

4187
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:26,070

I'm one with the dash.

4192
02:38:31,790 --> 02:38:32,950
I'm one with the dash.

4193
02:38:34,290 --> 02:38:35,550
Dash up the dash.

4194
02:38:38,030 --> 02:38:40,270
I think we're up the ceiling.

4195
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:41,750
How do I...

4196
02:38:41,750 --> 02:38:43,170
How do we go back to the checkpoint?

4197
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,230
Because I can't turn.

4198
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:44,590

You go right.

4205
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:53,930
Right.

4206
02:38:54,270 --> 02:38:55,490
Oh, I'm missing the prindle.

4207
02:38:56,770 --> 02:38:57,010

Forward and right.

4220
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:10,410
Be careful of the train.

4221
02:39:11,870 --> 02:39:12,690
Um, here comes the train.

4222
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:13,970
Destinians.

4223
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:16,930
Oh, can we just have the train go to the left?

4224
02:39:17,310 --> 02:39:17,990
Push us forward?

4225
02:39:18,730 --> 02:39:19,170

02:39:24,230 --> 02:39:25,790
Oh, it's not going forward.

4233
02:39:25,950 --> 02:39:27,310
Oh, oh, here comes the train.

02:39:34,310 --> 02:39:35,370
This is impossible.

4238
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:36,330

I rolled down the window.

4300
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:55,320
Did I ever tell you guys that sometimes at drive-throughs, I rolled down my window a little bit, and I just whisper, help me, the best dude.

4301
02:42:57,020 --> 02:42:58,740
Baba hates when I do this.

Why would he hate it?

4303
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:05,300
Why would he hate it?

02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:19,660
Oh, it's over.

02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:21,160
Oimo, we're going to get run over.

We're going to get run over.

4314
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:26,380
Grandma's going to get run over by a reindeer, except the reindeer looks like a car.

4315
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:27,760
Am I not running?

4316
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:28,560
Where am I going?

4317
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:30,900
You got to put the gas pedal on.

4318
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:32,720
You're also running into a wall.

4319
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:34,700
Wait, I already have the gas pedal, though.

4320
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:36,520
No, that's your brake pedal.

4321
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,800
No, the E is a gas.

4322
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,820
Yeah, I already have an E on.

4323
02:43:41,480 --> 02:43:42,460
Oh, I have another E.

4324
02:43:43,860 --> 02:43:45,100
What's the other way?

4325
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:46,780
That's so stupid, gaming.

4326
02:43:48,480 --> 02:43:50,400
You gotta reverse and turn to the right.

4327
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:52,800
Yeah, remember, Oima doesn't know how to drive.

4328
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:55,500
Okay, I think I'm better than mobile.

4329
02:43:56,180 --> 02:43:56,500
Oh!

4330
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:59,000
Oh!

4331
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:02,520
I'm gonna go on a drive.

4332
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:03,880
I think I'm stuck.

4333
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:04,240
I think I'm stuck.

4334
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:05,240
I'll try after.

4335
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:07,680
You know, I don't want to do this part though.

4336
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:08,960
I'm legitimately, wait.

4337
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:09,820
Am I not stuck?

4338
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:11,940
You are stuck, yeah.

4339
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:12,780
You gotta turn back.

4340
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:15,060
You gotta go hard right now, hard right.

4341
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:16,440
Forward hard right.

4342
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:17,780
Hard.

4343
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:18,720
Hard rock.

4344
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:20,160
They're not coming yet.

4345
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:21,500
Harder, harder, harder.

4346
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:22,120
Harder.

4347
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:22,960
Harder.

4348
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:26,020
Now hard right.

4349
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:27,340
Changing her way.

4350
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:29,020
Harder.

4351
02:44:29,400 --> 02:44:30,280
Harder right.

4352
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:31,140
Harder right.

4353
02:44:31,860 --> 02:44:35,400
Like the hardest, you're just going straight back and forth, sweetie.

4354
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:36,680
You're really good.

4355
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:43,880
Wait, who's in the seat now?

4356
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:44,420
It's me.

4357
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:46,300
I'm Vento.

4358
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:47,060
Save us.

4359
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:48,000
Save us.

4360
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:49,500
I don't want to do this part.

4361
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:50,220
I don't want to.

4362
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:50,960
I don't want to.

4363
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:52,480
Okay, I think I got shot.

4364
02:44:53,380 --> 02:44:54,160
Wait, are we...

4365
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:54,220
Oh.

4366
02:44:57,460 --> 02:44:58,020
Oh, wait.

4367
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:59,520
I went the wrong way, my bad.

4368
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:00,960
And then you can reverse.

4369
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:02,140
Let's just reverse back.

4370
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:03,400
Yeah, we'll do it backwards.

4371
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:04,500
We'll just do it.

4372
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:05,360
We'll do it in style.

4373
02:45:06,660 --> 02:45:08,180
We don't look at cool explosions.

4374
02:45:09,620 --> 02:45:12,520
The only thing cool that I like to see is in this car already.

4375
02:45:13,140 --> 02:45:13,900
Where's the train?

4376
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:14,980
It'll come.

4377
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:15,820
Oh, wait.

4378
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:15,940
Awesome.

4379
02:45:16,320 --> 02:45:16,380
Awesome.

4380
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:17,320
It always comes.

4381
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:19,000
Oh, shit.

4382
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:20,580
Oh, shit.

4383
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:22,820
I think that was me.

4384
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:23,680
I'm sorry.

4385
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:25,100
I'm sorry.

4386
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:26,040
I'm sorry.

4387
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:27,900
I lost my Prindle.

4388
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:29,400
Can someone please give it to me?

4389
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:30,460
I think I see it.

4390
02:45:30,460 --> 02:45:31,000
Oh, dear Prindle.

4391
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:32,060
I see it.

4392
02:45:32,060 --> 02:45:32,500
I see it.

4393
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:34,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4394
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,940
Did anyone grab it?

4395
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:39,680
Did anyone grab it?

4396
02:45:42,280 --> 02:45:43,200
I don't know.

4397
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:45,200
You told me to grab one.

4398
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:47,340
And did anyone grab my break?

4399
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:48,120
We're still alive.

4400
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:49,340
It's behind me.

4401
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,080
It's behind me.

4402
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:50,720
It's behind me.

4403
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:51,940
It's on my butt.

4404
02:45:52,060 --> 02:45:53,100
Oh no, it's on your butt.

4405
02:45:53,560 --> 02:45:54,980
Why are you shoving up your butt?

4406
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:56,040
You're not supposed to hook that.

4407
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:57,480
Sanitize that first.

4408
02:45:57,660 --> 02:45:58,600
Did someone give it this?

4409
02:45:58,820 --> 02:45:59,560
I got it.

4410
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,740
Now I need my break.

4411
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:01,900
Break?

4412
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:03,160
Break.

4413
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:04,740
I see it by...

4414
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:05,580
I see what we're doing here.

4415
02:46:05,780 --> 02:46:06,400
I got it.

4416
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:06,940
Where is it?

4417
02:46:07,940 --> 02:46:08,400
Is it that?

4418
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:09,020
Yeah, I got it.

4419
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:09,620
Wait, you got it?

4420
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:10,200
Yeah, I got it.

4421
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:10,720
Here you go.

4422
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:11,540
Oh, thank you!

4423
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:14,460
Okay, let's do this again, baby.

4424
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:16,580
Only for the most beautiful grandma.

4425
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:20,380
Okay.

4426
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:22,700
Oh, wait, oh my god, you're so good at this.

4427
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:24,640
All right.

4428
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:28,720
Tell me when to go left or right.

4429
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:29,980
Just say, oh, whoops, whoops.

4430
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:32,340

4431
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:33,980

02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:09,500
Very straight.

4435
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:10,100
Left, left, left.

4436
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:10,960
There we go.

4437
02:47:11,140 --> 02:47:11,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4438
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:13,500
Oh, is this pattern right now?

4439
02:47:14,320 --> 02:47:14,740
No!

4440
02:47:15,780 --> 02:47:17,420
It's over for us!

4441
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:18,440
It's okay.

4442
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:19,780
There's another train coming right.

4443
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:20,480
Maybe I'll see.

4444
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:22,140
Oh, it reset.

4445
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:22,640
It reset.

4446
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:27,360
Oh, it pushes way back into the entrance.

4447
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:28,720
Why did it do that?

4448
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,080
Oh, there we go.

4449
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:31,600
Thank you.

4450
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:31,980
Thank you.

4451
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:33,360
Good, good.

4452
02:47:35,220 --> 02:47:35,840
Okay, okay.

4453
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:36,520
Okay, nice.

4454
02:47:36,700 --> 02:47:37,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4455
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:38,100
Oh, it's cold.

4456
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:39,580
Oh, sorry, my bad.

4457
02:47:40,060 --> 02:47:41,100
I didn't do that.

4458
02:47:41,460 --> 02:47:44,060
I swear, this car is haunted or something.

4459
02:47:44,660 --> 02:47:45,040
For real.

4460
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:46,080
Ghost car.

4461
02:47:46,180 --> 02:47:46,680
Ghost car.

4462
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:48,660
It's like there's two ghosts in here or something.

4463
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:49,640
Like, what the hell?

4464
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:50,300
Oh, my God.

4465
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,020
Why would that happen ever?

4466
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:53,980
That's, like, the rarest thing ever.

4467
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:55,520
That's crazy.

4468
02:47:56,100 --> 02:47:56,840
Try to drive a car.

4469
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:58,800
Yeah, it could never happen.

4470
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:01,600
Okay.

4471
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:02,660
Okay.

4472
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:02,900
Okay.

4473
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:03,500
Sorry.

4474
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:05,620
I know I'm driving a little erratically.

4475
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:06,480
Okay, here we go.

4476
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:07,600
I think, oh, no.

4477
02:48:07,620 --> 02:48:09,120
and I are also probably dead.

4478
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:11,660
Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left.

4479
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:13,280
Yeah, I think this is pattern recognition.

4480
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:13,900
It's always left.

4481
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:28,220
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

4482
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:32,080
right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, we went past the first part.

4483
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:37,320
Uh, we need to, back up, hurry, yeah, it's like, oh, shoot, I went the wrong way.

4484
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:42,120
harder the the rotation on this part is ass

4485
02:48:45,400 --> 02:49:09,360
okay go straight go straight go straight and then left yeah oh we did it oh oh what's happening no uh okay no what do you mean no oh i'm in your lap hi Wait, where do we go now?

4486
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:10,780
Go straight?

4487
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:12,880
Oh, it's a bunch of boxes.

4488
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:14,500
No way.

4489
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:15,960
Oh, this looks so awful.

4490
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:20,100
Okay, go a little bit to your left.

4491
02:49:22,860 --> 02:49:24,440
And then, no, back up.

4492
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:25,340
Back up.

4493
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:28,960
And then go a little bit to your left.

4494
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:32,860
Why can't we just run over these boxes?

4495
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:35,600
Yeah, why can't we just...

4496
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:39,840
Those fucking boxes are just filled with cinder blocks.

4497
02:49:40,940 --> 02:49:41,300
My bad.

4498
02:49:41,580 --> 02:49:43,300
Oh man, is this truly hell?

4499
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:44,320
Yeah.

4500
02:49:46,220 --> 02:49:47,320
Which way do I go?

4501
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:49,480
Left.

4502
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:50,980
Left?

4503
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:53,840
Yeah, because there's a box right in front of you.

4504
02:49:54,080 --> 02:49:54,100
Oh.

4505
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:57,960
Is there a way to go around?

4506
02:49:58,040 --> 02:49:59,240
Oh, you have to go around these boxes.

4507
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:00,600
Oh, I gotta go around.

4508
02:50:00,820 --> 02:50:01,840
You might have to back up.

4509
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:04,060
Yeah, back up and then a little left.

4510
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:04,920
Back up straight?

4511
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:08,180
Oh, there you go.

4512
02:50:08,180 --> 02:50:09,220
Oh, sorry.

4513
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:10,040
So sorry.

4514
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:11,440
So sorry.

4515
02:50:12,060 --> 02:50:12,980
It's all the pizza.

4516
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:13,760
The pizza.

4517
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:16,840
OK, move a little bit to the right because you're okay.

4518
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:17,760
Oh, perfect.

4519
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:19,140
I think that's good.

4520
02:50:19,300 --> 02:50:19,740
Okay, there's a ramp.

4521
02:50:19,860 --> 02:50:20,280
There's a ramp.

4522
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:20,920
A ramp.

4523
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:22,040
A straight, push straight.

4524
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:22,860
A floor.

4525
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:27,760
I'm going to bump up a little bit.

4526
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:28,920
No, don't go back.

4527
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:31,280
Are we good?

4528
02:50:31,740 --> 02:50:33,800
Oh, I think they're all ramps.

4529
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,120
I do this all ramps.

4530
02:50:39,580 --> 02:51:02,780

4531
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:05,880
You can salvage it.

4532
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:06,540
Salvage it.

4533
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:07,360
Okay, okay.

4534
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:08,540
I believe in my wife.

4535
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:09,860
I'm stuck.

4536
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:11,360
Wait, hold on.

4537
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:12,600
Wait.

4538
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:14,240
Maybe a little bit more.

4539
02:51:14,480 --> 02:51:15,340
Oh, okay.

4540
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:15,880
What is it doing?

4541
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:16,840
Keep going, keep going.

4542
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:18,060
I can't.

4543
02:51:18,140 --> 02:51:19,000
You keep placing the...

4544
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:19,740
Is that letting...

4545
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:22,920
Wait, okay, hold on.

4546
02:51:25,180 --> 02:51:26,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4547
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:27,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4548
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:29,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4549
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:30,580
Oh, my God.

4550
02:51:31,380 --> 02:51:31,720
That's good.

4551
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:33,400
Wait, hold on.

4552
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:34,100
Let's try.

4553
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:35,380
Let's try this.

4554
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:35,640
Okay.

4555
02:51:35,780 --> 02:51:40,040
I go straight or go left like this.

4556
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:42,540
And then when I back up, I go like this.

4557
02:51:43,740 --> 02:51:43,740
Okay.

4558
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:44,980
I go like that.

4559
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:45,520
Yeah.

4560
02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:46,060
I must live.

4561
02:51:46,480 --> 02:51:47,160
Yeah, see the plan.

4562
02:51:47,640 --> 02:51:47,920
Okay.

4563
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:48,820
Oh.

4564
02:51:49,580 --> 02:51:49,780
Oh.

4565
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:51,400
It kicked me out.

4566
02:51:51,940 --> 02:51:52,660
Good luck.

4567
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:54,580
I don't think I can see us.

4568
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:55,520
Good luck, everybody.

4569
02:51:56,460 --> 02:51:57,840
Good luck, everybody else.

4570
02:51:58,920 --> 02:51:59,840
Who's everyone else?

4571
02:52:00,220 --> 02:52:00,660
Us.

4572
02:52:01,880 --> 02:52:03,900
Oh, is that Oimo?

4573
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:05,100
It is.

4574
02:52:05,260 --> 02:52:06,660
Do you want to come back to him?

4575
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:08,080
No, no, no.

4576
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:10,000
Is it moving at all?

4577
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:11,080
You're toast.

4578
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:13,400
No?

4579
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:14,400
No?

4580
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:15,320
What?

4581
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:17,460
Because I'm backing up, like, full speed.

4582
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:19,280
Yeah, it's kind of tricky.

4583
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:20,020
Oh, you're definitely not moving.

4584
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:23,000
Oh, yeah, we're, like, right on top of something.

4585
02:52:24,820 --> 02:52:26,440
Oh, I think we fell off.

4586
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:27,460
Are we restarting?

4587
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:29,480
I have to go soon, though.

4588
02:52:29,540 --> 02:52:31,020
I have a meeting in a couple minutes.

4589
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:32,720
Oh yeah.

4590
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:33,800
Yeah, that's fine.

4591
02:52:35,220 --> 02:52:36,800
Oh, whoa.

4592
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:38,680
Oh, whoa.

4593
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,860
This game is hell.

4594
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:45,000
I never want to touch it again.

4595
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:46,480
Why did we say this would be fun?

4596
02:52:49,880 --> 02:52:51,580
It was fun with you guys.

4597
02:52:54,040 --> 02:52:55,780
It was fun with you guys.

4598
02:52:56,880 --> 02:52:57,760
Thank you.

4599
02:52:57,880 --> 02:52:59,580
This game was also really hard too.

4600
02:52:59,820 --> 02:53:00,720
It was hard.

4601
02:53:01,220 --> 02:53:01,620
It was fun because we did it together.

4602
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:03,360
Holy cow!

4603
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:05,780
Oh my god.

4604
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:09,740
I think it was fun because you guys were playing.

4605
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:12,080
Friendships makes a game.

4606
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:14,460
Friendships makes the sloth, you know?

4607
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:19,380
Are we kind of the same thing?

4608
02:53:20,360 --> 02:53:22,760
Oh wait, I can shoot it out to people's mouth.

4609
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,360

This game was so stinking hard!

4618
02:54:44,490 --> 02:54:45,910
What the heck?

4619
02:54:46,110 --> 02:54:48,430
Oh, I have none of the customizations.

4620
02:54:52,770 --> 02:54:54,570
Oh, my god.

4621
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:58,610
Good morning, Ryder.

4622
02:55:00,430 --> 02:55:01,930
Ah, but I had a lot of fun.

4623
02:55:02,070 --> 02:55:03,310
I hope you guys did too.

4624
02:55:03,910 --> 02:55:05,370
That was craziness.

4625
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:09,110
Minto, kawaiiya.

4626
02:55:09,530 --> 02:55:14,450
Fun group though.

4627
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:16,090
I hope you all play something together again.

4628
02:55:16,110 --> 02:55:31,730
Yeah, originally we were going to play that RV there yet game, but I think all three of them had already played and Apparently the map stays the same So it's only me that hasn't played it before Thanks for the nifty and fun driving lesson.

4629
02:55:32,090 --> 02:55:43,290

Okay.

4631
02:55:54,170 --> 02:55:58,310
But yeah, I still had a lot of fun, even though the game was very challenging.

4632
02:55:58,850 --> 02:56:03,390
It put my car driving skills to, like, the absolute test.

4633
02:56:03,750 --> 02:56:08,190
Now, nobody can ever say that I'm a bad driver again, because I felt so powerful.

4634
02:56:09,870 --> 02:56:11,430
I felt so powerful.

4635
02:56:12,930 --> 02:56:14,210
The Minto stays busy.

4636
02:56:14,330 --> 02:56:15,130
How does she do it?

4637
02:56:16,110 --> 02:56:17,810
Two meetings in one day.

4638
02:56:18,330 --> 02:56:19,450

4639
02:56:21,350 --> 02:56:22,990

Yeah, yeah.

4662
02:57:44,010 --> 02:57:46,550
I have just a few things that I need left for debut.

4663
02:57:48,030 --> 02:57:52,990
I'm waiting on some stuff to come in the mail for me to use.

4664
02:57:53,530 --> 02:57:55,650
I have to record some things tomorrow.

4665
02:57:59,370 --> 02:58:01,990
But overall, oh my gosh, you guys, I'm such a genius.

4666
02:58:02,730 --> 02:58:07,430
There was one part of something that I was making that was like the most daunting for me.

4667
