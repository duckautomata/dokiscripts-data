1
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,660
I was having some trouble with the game.

2
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,460
And so I finally got it all set up.

3
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
And then I was scared it didn't work.

4
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,220
Thank you.

5
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,600
Thank you, thank you.

6
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,210
Thank you so much for the podcast.

7
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,030
You guys, I realized I forgot something.

8
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,370
Last stream, my handy dandy whip.

9
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,810
So we have it.

10
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:08,750
And I thought, oh my gosh, I was like, wait, with the cowboy hat, with the hat and the braids.

11
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,310
And I look like a real cowgirl, no?

12
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,610
Oh, thank you so much for the tag gifted.

13
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,490
Space alien.

14
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,370
Thanks for the fun gifted.

15
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,530
Forgot my clothes?

16
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:23,850
Oh.

17
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,110
Thank you, Minta.

18
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,350
Yeah.

19
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,130
Hi, Smyr.

20
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,090
Thank you for the fun gifted.

21
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,490
Welcome back, everybody.

22
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,670
Um, I want to kind of just get into it because...

23
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,510
Uh, I...

24
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,850
I'm only 21% through the game!

25
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,810
No, um...

26
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,450
Confirm load, yes.

27
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,410
I...

28
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,670
Still need to finish the last...

29
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,670
Wait, where am I?

30
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,190
The last, the first movie!

31
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,950
The last chapter of the...

32
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,250
Of the first movie.

33
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,670
So we gotta do that.

34
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,650
Sorry if I miss some people.

35
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,370
Oh, no, thank you so much, Katsun Tecuh!

36
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,010
Thank you, thank you.

37
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,230
I can't, I can't like scroll through chat as I do usually in case I miss something.

38
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,570
So sorry!

39
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,530
I look like Applejack.

40
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,570
Don't I?

41
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,870
I look like if an Applejack...

42
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,830
We're a ghost girl.

43
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,230
And not a... a horse.

44
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,330
But a cat.

45
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,850
Ducky, thanks for the get there!

46
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:43,370
Um, but yeah, let's open the Ark, and then we will today do the Temple of Doom!

47
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,150
Yippee!

48
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,110
Yippee!

49
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,040
We have the birthday!

50
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,580
I know you can't sing for me, so can I get a hot dog instead?

51
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,260
Hot dog!

52
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,940
Happy hot dog!

53
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,620
So nothing like Applejack.

54
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,620
What are you talking about?

55
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,060
Oh my god, there's...

56
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,920
Who let this monkey in, though?

57
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,520
What the heck?

58
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,080
Why are you in here?

59
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,840
Okay, I have to remember how to destroy things.

60
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
I could never forget.

61
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,140
Wait, and then this is to...

62
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,340
Wait, I want to bring you in for a big old smooch.

63
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,900
Let's get some more money.

64
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,500
Like riding a bike.

65
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:33,960
Boop!

66
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,100
Whoa!

67
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,560
Why is there a monkey in the museum?

68
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,420
Sounds like a movie.

69
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
The monkey in the museum.

70
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Who are you?

71
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,900
Wait, why do you have my hat?

72
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,640
Wait, are you me?

73
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,060
Wait, who are you?

74
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,560
What?

75
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,040
Are you me?

76
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,820
Oh my gosh, I thought this, my weeaboo-ass brain was just like, wow, a Miko.

77
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,520
Wait, is that me?

78
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,220
Turn around!

79
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,480
Turn around!

80
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
I can't...

81
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Turn around!

82
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,900
Wait, no.

83
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,880
Who are you?

84
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,210
I'm Yuba with my coat off.

85
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,870
Alright, let's get into it, baby.

86
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,590
Opening the arc!

87
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,530
Story.

88
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,970
Ta-da-da!

89
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,890
Oh, that's it.

90
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,270
Oh, that's it.

91
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,930
Oh, that's right.

92
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,290
They took Marion.

93
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:38,990
That's her name, right?

94
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,150
Oh, wait.

95
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,250
Is he looking at her in her underwear?

96
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,730
Wait, she looks really naked in this.

97
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,090
Wait, I'm blocking it?

98
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,230
But she looks like so naked.

99
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,670
Wow-wee.

100
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,710
You're just gonna walk around like that?

101
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,430
Okay.

102
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:01,750
Nice.

103
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,070
This is a kid's game.

104
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,890
Maybe.

105
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,890
Alright, I know I need to build back.

106
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,590
Oh, look at all those guys over there.

107
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,310
What's this?

108
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,230
I'm really destroying everything.

109
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,410
No fences allowed.

110
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,490
No fences allowed.

111
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,710
So guys, today I'm so relaxed.

112
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,550
You want to know why I'm so relaxed?

113
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:27,990
Ah!

114
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,570
Wait, they're not coming over.

115
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,630
Oh, that guy over there doesn't know what to do.

116
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,630
Wait, he's a little stuck.

117
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,130
Wait, can I sims them?

118
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:35,850
Sims them!

119
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,330
Sims them!

120
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,370
No!

121
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,090
Dang it.

122
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,510
Uh-oh.

123
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,910
Okay, um...

124
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,230
Yeah, a gun!

125
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
And he's shooting her!

126
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,300
Uh, what did I do for this?

127
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,000
That, okay.

128
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:04,140
I'm relaxed because I went with my mama and... Oh wait, that's the hat!

129
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,100
I need the hat.

130
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:17,660
And we went to a head spa so I might be a little extra dumb today because I'm all Like, mmm, head has been thoroughly scratched.

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,920
It was her first time going to one.

132
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,960
Oh, whoops.

133
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,260
No, I was trying to destroy this, but I guess we cannot.

134
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,140
That's fine.

135
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,540
So I take this out to here.

136
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:29,960
Okay.

137
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,120
Yeah, my brain is so squishy.

138
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,060
Did she just fall in?

139
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,360
She's fine.

140
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,360
Okay.

141
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,260
Build, build, build, build, build, build.

142
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,220
Nice.

143
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,640
I don't know why I'm sneaking.

144
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,780
Wait.

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,720
Oh!

146
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,160
Wait.

147
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,260
Oh, oops.

148
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,060
Oh, wait.

149
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,120
Get up there.

150
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,260
Get up there, Indy.

151
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,900
Oh, there we go.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,720
I have to hold it down.

153
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,340
So that's all I do.

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,920
A spa for your head?

155
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,920
Never heard of one.

156
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,240
It's not, well, it's like a head spa, but then also they have massages.

157
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,500
and you can get a facial too.

158
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,760
It's like everything sometimes.

159
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Depends on the place, but it just...

160
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,800
It's so good.

161
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,280
I recommend everybody goes at least once in your life or afterlife.

162
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,920
So glad even the afterlife.

163
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,320
All my ectoplasm is so squishy now.

164
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,580
How do I get this?

165
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,400
Indiana Jones, learn how to swim.

166
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,480
Dive!

167
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,580
Oh, I got it!

168
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,500
Dive!

169
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,360
Okay, cool.

170
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,320
All right, now we're here.

171
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,060
See where the baddies were though.

172
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,460
Can I destroy this?

173
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,280
Do-do-do!

174
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,490
Yes!

175
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,350
What is this?

176
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,210
A bigger gun?

177
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,810
We love to see it.

178
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,670
A gun or a bigger gun?

179
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,430
What's this?

180
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,310
More money?

181
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,750
More money, more problems.

182
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,570
Except in Lego Indiana Jones.

183
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,030
More money, more people.

184
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,030
That we can purchase for our museum.

185
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,310
It doesn't sound quite right.

186
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:32,870
Maybe.

187
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,520
Oh, oops.

188
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,340
I just instinctively destroy.

189
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,300
Am I supposed to...

190
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,540
Well, what's this one do?

191
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,180
Okay.

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,120
Hold?

193
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,540
Baby core, thank you!

194
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,410
Let's go back to the boat.

195
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,750
So I brought this here.

196
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,990
Just destroy everything.

197
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,990
Yeah?

198
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,570

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,990
I think she's drowning.

202
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:04,610
Oh.

203
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,430
She's fine.

204
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,390
Her booty's out, though.

205
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,670
Man, put on a shirt.

206
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,490
Or some pants.

207
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,190
I mean...

208
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,090
I don't need to talk to this guy.

209
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:17,710
Oh, wait!

210
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,270
I am wearing... No, I'm not wearing the hat.

211
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,330
I don't think so.

212
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,590
Use the whip.

213
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,130
Oh, I do have a whip.

214
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,170
Oops.

215
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,130
All I know how to do is destroy.

216
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:44,490
I don't know how to love All I do, everything I love Everything I touch That I love Gets whipped What do I whip on?

217
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,530
Whip pick?

218
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,690
Oh, here maybe Aha!

00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:59,750
Okay, okay Sorry, getting back into the swing of things The whip of things Oh, my money We need a tiny character Okay,

220
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,110

221
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,010
Oh, that's right!

222
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,350
I can!

223
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,010
I can do that!

224
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,610
I forgot!

225
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,010
Oh, wrong thing.

226
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,390
Stupid woman.

227
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,350
What are you doing?

228
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,410
Try using the case files.

229
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,350
Crawl through it, Mito.

230
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,110
Oh wait!

231
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,010
Okay, we inhabited- our soul is within the- what's this do?

232
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:35,530
Oh!

233
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:36,730
Oh!

234
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,210
Pull!

235
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,770
Oh, okay.

236
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,190
We need to both pull at the same time.

237
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,990
You go to the other one.

238
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,470
Ma'am.

239
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,550
Ma'am, go to the other one.

240
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,010
There we go.

241
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,450
Um...

242
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,830
Do you think they're gonna notice?

243
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,470
That guy's got a gun.

244
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,330
Oh!

245
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,770
Oh, I think this needs to go to the ship.

246
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,570
Before I do that, I want to destroy their headquarters.

247
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,150
Yeah, they had a gun.

248
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,770
Okay.

249
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,670
This is mine now.

250
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,450
And I think we are stealing a boat.

251
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:37,930
Oh.

252
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,010
Oh my gosh, she's so smart!

253
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,050
She knew exactly what I needed.

254
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,820
Oh, wait.

255
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,720
Wait, is it why to use a thing?

256
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,520
Yeah, okay.

257
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,240
Okay.

258
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,100
Oh, oh, oh, too far.

259
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,060
Oh, okay.

260
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,360
Oops.

261
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,440
I don't know how to use it.

262
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,180
Do-do-do.

263
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,920
What is this?

264
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,400
Ah, oh.

265
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,900
Oops.

266
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,960
No, not down.

267
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:14,480
Wait.

268
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,480
Okay, almost one side.

269
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,680
Okay.

270
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,740
Nice.

271
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,900
Oh, my gosh.

272
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm an aiming... Why are my hearts, like, silver?

273
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,400
Oh, I think that's the...

274
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,980
Maybe the machine I'm using.

275
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,460
Nice aim.

276
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,220
I'm a godgamer, baby.

277
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,320
Why did they build it like this?

278
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,040
Huh.

279
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,320
Curious.

280
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,400
Curious.

281
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Oh, I'm a true adventurer.

282
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,360
Move out of the way, Marion!

283
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,040
Uh-oh.

284
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,640
Don't drop.

285
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,680
There's gotta be something over here.

286
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,040
Oh!

287
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,830
Oh!

288
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,030
Is this the way?

289
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,730
Or is this secret?

290
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,230
What is this?

291
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,650
We could even beat up boulders.

292
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,530
Indy's strength knows no bounds.

293
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,050
It's crazy.

294
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,350
This is the way.

295
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:29,730
Okay.

296
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,370
Uh-oh.

297
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:30,790
Ah!

298
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,250
Oh my gosh.

299
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,230
Yeah!

300
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,390
Kick his butt!

301
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,990
Hand kick this guy's butt.

302
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,430
Oh, my money.

303
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:43,950
Oh, wait.

304
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,930
We can get in that.

305
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,550
Alright, alright, alright.

306
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,470
So we're trying to open this up, maybe?

307
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,630
I hear more people, or I hear something.

308
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,290
Do I whip it here?

309
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,850
Yes, I- Oh!

310
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,930
Why did it explode?

311
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,030
Is this Half-Life 3?

312
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,630
Yeah.

313
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,150
Actually.

314
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,630
Oh my god!

315
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,090
Preemptive death?

316
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,130
Wait, I won on my money!

317
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,950
Sometimes I shoot on accident.

318
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,590
Sometimes I don't mean to shoot, and I just want to use my fists.

319
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,110
First, you know, whip it out.

320
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,850
No, no.

321
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,170
First, I whip it.

322
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,330
Whip it good.

323
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,510
I think that doesn't sound so good.

324
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,770
The first thing you said.

325
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,930
Oh, what's this?

326
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,290
Wait!

327
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,490
What is this?

328
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,530
Is this where I need a...

329
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,780
A shovel?

330
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,810
Not sure.

331
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,730
Wait, what's over here?

332
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,130
This looks like a puzzle.

333
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,090
How do we get over here?

334
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,830
Aw, curious.

335
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,850
Well, let's just keep going, I guess.

336
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:18,840
Oh!

337
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,620
A wrench.

338
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,380
Alright.

339
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,520
Oh, to fix the car.

340
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,680
Oh.

341
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,220
Yeah.

342
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh wait, my god, my god, my...

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,700
God, no.

344
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,540
Marion!

345
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,460
We're fine.

346
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,640
We're not okay.

347
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,720
Okay, if we're...

348
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,620
We were not.

349
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,440
Where is she?

350
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,200
Do I need to unlock it?

351
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,360
Where'd she go?

352
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,440
And he doesn't need a gun.

353
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,600
He's got his fist.

354
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,900
I didn't get that hat from the guy, which is sad.

355
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,720
Wait, what's this?

356
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,680
Oh, we're just hiding, like a little goofball.

357
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,260
Destroy the street lamp!

358
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,640
Oh.

359
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,240
Or don't.

360
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,940
Okay.

361
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,660
I want this horse.

362
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,620
Nope.

363
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,520
Ride the horse.

364
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,620
Some animals throw you high into the air when you jump off of them.

365
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,620
Okay.

366
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,260
Wow!

367
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,500
You really did that!

368
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,180
Goldship!

369
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,060
Yeah.

370
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,360
Oh.

371
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,620
Okay, girl.

372
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,900
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,240
I didn't build this for you to just do nothing.

374
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,820
Excuse me.

375
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,680
Where were you?

376
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,720
Okay.

377
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,020
Indy, fix this.

378
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,580
No, fix it.

379
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,240
Fix it?

380
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,620
How do I fix it?

381
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh, there it is.

382
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,440
And

383
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,820
then, what is this here?

384
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,420
Okay, we got so much going on around here.

385
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,140
I wish I could unlock...

386
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,820
Oh, maybe I bust it down.

387
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,420
Okay, here we go.

388
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:37,580
Oh.

389
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,160
Alright, watch out, Marion!

390
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,680
Wait!

391
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Hello?

392
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,420
Oh, okay.

393
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,920
The very long hint.

394
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,200
Wait.

395
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,040
Get out.

396
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,820
There we go.

397
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,100
They're like, hey, you know, now you have a thing that's big enough, tall enough to jump on.

398
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,800
We're busting.

399
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,440
We're busting.

400
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,100
Eew.

401
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,680
I like how it explodes.

402
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,080
Wait.

403
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,880
Wait.

404
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,510
Are we making this thing, this A tier?

405
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,270
Oops.

406
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,430
Okay, thank goodness.

407
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,790
Oh, don't do it again.

408
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,430
Okay, wait.

409
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,910
All right, so now here.

410
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,830
But how do I get more?

411
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,900
Looks like a four?

412
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,200
Kind of.

413
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,580
Wait, where do I get more from?

414
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,300
Oh, this?

415
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,060
Wait, how did that get over?

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,320
No!

418
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,260
No!

419
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:23,940
Please!

420
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
Okay, now we push this.

421
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,800
No, no, push here.

422
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,800
Okay, that does that one.

423
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,580
Now we have... Like, we just need two more.

424
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,620
Hmm.

425
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,340
Just need two more.

426
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,040
Oh, maybe I stand on one and the Marion stands on the other.

427
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,700
Okay.

428
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,620
that?

429
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Alright, Marion.

430
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,860
Oh, okay, Indy changed his mind.

431
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,180
He said, no.

432
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,900
I am the master of my fate.

433
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,180
I decide what I want to stand on.

434
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,380
Oh, it's a bazooka!

435
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,780
No, fire.

436
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,300
Yeah!

437
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,620
Is there anything else?

438
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,220
I don't want to quite go yet.

439
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,560
Is there anything else we can blow up?

440
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:32,920
What?

441
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
What is the horse?

442
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
See, there's this part too.

443
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,540
I wonder if we did this same pattern.

444
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,420
If this would open up, you know?

445
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,820
Let's try it.

446
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,040
So...

447
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Bottom?

448
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,320
Okay.

449
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,260
Two and then up instead.

450
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:49,860
Okay, okay.

451
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,420
Let's try it.

452
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,820
Let's try it.

453
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,260
Let's try it.

454
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,320
She don't need no...

455
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,160
Yeah, she's a high jumper.

456
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,600
All right, so you pick it up.

457
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,760
Pick it up.

458
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,060
Okay.

459
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,760
It was...

460
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,080
It was like this one, right?

461
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,860
And then...

462
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,800
Oh, okay, Andy.

463
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,520
You got this.

464
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,920
Okay.

465
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,620
Nice.

466
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,720
And then this one.

467
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,280
No, no.

468
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,200
No, Mary.

469
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,860
Okay, yeah.

470
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,560
There we go.

471
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:42,120
I don't know why she did that What a stupid lady Yeah Yeah yeah yeah Yeah I'm so smart I'm genius Boats go binted

472
00:26:45,510 --> 00:27:00,610
Uh Have no boat Yeah Yeah Two out of how many Did that say And then like what the heck is this Oh wait I wonder Oh wait I wonder if this is for this little guy.

473
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,450
Okay, never mind.

474
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,030
What if I blow this thing up?

475
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,570
Alright, time to blow stuff up.

476
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,990
No, no, no.

477
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,090
Take it out.

478
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,580
Why is it arched now?

479
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,380
Wait, can I blow up the other side?

480
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,180
Blow up more?

481
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,260
Wait, why is she can she destroy it?

482
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:40,960
her fists but i couldn't okay one more no no put oh

483
00:27:44,050 --> 00:28:00,860
it was literally nothing it was actually nothing and we don't have a shovel unfortunately where i don't oh wait this too wait there we go indy grab the other side.

484
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,820
I guess if this is if you don't want to use the truck, you use the horses to get up there.

485
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,380
Why are they not grabbing on together, though?

486
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,280
Maybe because we already solved the puzzle, but in our own creative way.

487
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,180
We solved the puzzle in our own way.

488
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay, let's keep going.

489
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,540
That's it!

490
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,800
Blow it up!

491
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,020
It's the Ark.

492
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,220
Blow it up!

493
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,760
Wait, why?

494
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,100
Oh.

495
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,020
Oh, where'd that guy come from?

496
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,800
Up there.

497
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,980
He's sweaty.

498
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,480
A sweaty Lego man.

499
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,100
Do Legos even have pores?

500
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,880
Oh, my god!

501
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,360
Wait.

502
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,320
Oh, okay.

503
00:28:59,380 --> 00:28:59,700
Wait.

504
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,900
Are we gonna watch them Lego die from the Lego ghosts?

505
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,680
Oh, sorry, Indy.

506
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,540
Wait, am I giving him hearts again?

507
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,270
Sephiroth?

508
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,210
What is this?

509
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,290
Why is the music like this?

510
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:25,630
Oh.

511
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,810
Oh my god.

512
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,980
What is this?

513
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,280
Oh.

514
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,860
Um, let's build whatever the hell this is.

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,500
Or, oh my god, she's the strongest lady ever.

516
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,880
Hey, leave me alone.

517
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,440
Hi!

518
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,660
Leave me alone!

519
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,840
Thank God!

520
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,720
The music is insane!

521
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,980
Yeah, kill him!

522
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,140
Okay, now we have to build this thing, huh?

523
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

524
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,620
Alright.

525
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,860
And what did that do, actually?

526
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,590
Everybody's waiting their turn to get beat up.

527
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,800
Cool, I barely made that.

528
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Okay, whoa, there's a lot going on here.

529
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,560
Yeah, let's stop the grenade, man.

530
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,860
How do we get up here?

531
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,040
Is it this?

532
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,260
Yes, maybe.

533
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,880
Okay, and we go over, and we're going over, and I'm going up.

534
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,820
Oh, I need you.

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,060
Indy, I need you!

536
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,050
Indy, boom!

537
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,790
Where'd Marion go?

538
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,340
Yeah!

539
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,740
Oh, we get one hit to him every time.

540
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,300
Oh, uh, where'd he go?

541
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,340
Oh, never mind.

542
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,460
Oh, he got one hit.

543
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,540
I got one hit by him.

544
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,140
Kill him!

545
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,720
Oh, we killed him!

546
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
The music is so crazy.

547
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,500
Oh no, close your Lego eyes!

548
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,120
There he is!

549
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,700
Oh my god!

550
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,320
They are Lego ghosts!

551
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,600
Oh no, he's Lego!

552
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,860
Oh no, he's Legoing out!

553
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,020
Oh, he's gonna Lego melt!

554
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,940
Wait, I want to see him Lego melt!

555
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,840
That'll be so sick!

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,180
Oh my god!

557
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,290
Imagine you play this game as a kid, but you've never seen the movie.

558
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,450
We didn't get to see it.

559
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,610
I like her Lego cleavage.

560
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,970
One Lego ghost laughed.

561
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,010
It's me.

562
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,630
I almost said Lego.

563
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,170
Level complete!

564
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,230
Yippee!

565
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,050
Marion Nightgown.

566
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,550
You've done that before!

567
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,640
Oh,

568
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,410
a nice brick.

569
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:17,930
Woohoo!

570
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,830
Okay, we finished up Covenant of the Ark!

571
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,530
Time for the temple.

572
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,590
Oh, the temple of Doom soon.

573
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,040
I don't remember.

574
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,800
Why is she not like them hugging?

575
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,920
What's wrong?

576
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,240
Oh.

577
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,740
Oh, oh.

578
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,700
Oh, Indy.

579
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:38,940
Ah!

580
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,480
Oh, Indy.

581
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,980
Oh, they sealed the arc away.

582
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,820
That's right.

583
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,160
Marion, NSFW.

584
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:49,920
No!

585
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,940
Did I forget something?

586
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,770
So many mysteries in here.

587
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,790
What if you're trying to find something?

588
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,810
Wait, how's that guy doing that?

589
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,250
Literally, Scooby-Doo.

590
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,370
Wait, are these...

591
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,110
From a movie?

592
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,770
Lost forever.

593
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,650
Oh, wait, they're concept!

594
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,850
This is so cute!

595
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,910
They'll find it eventually.

596
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:33,710
I'm sure.

597
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,930
I don't think they ever want them to come out.

598
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,710
That's true.

599
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,530
Okay, how do I get out of here?

600
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,230
Thank you.

601
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,430
What's...

602
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,730
It's so ominous.

603
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,450
24.1%.

604
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,880
Lego YouTubers.

605
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,180
What's happening?

606
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,440
Oh.

607
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,120
Oh, what is going on?

608
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:14,360
Ah.

609
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,560
Look at that little picture.

610
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,780
Yay!

611
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,000
She's all dressed up just for me, baby.

612
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,160
Let me see that booty.

613
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,460
Booty, booty, booty.

614
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,660
Wow, she really just got nothing on in the back.

615
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:29,900
Wow.

616
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,100
Hey!

617
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,560
Hands off of her!

618
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,020
Ha-ha!

619
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,560
Okay.

620
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,180
Shall we?

621
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,640
Let's go buy a couple more guys, and then we'll start the next game.

622
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,880
Wait.

623
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,700
Was it this one?

624
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,440
Or this one?

625
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,380
What is this one?

626
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:49,920
Yeah.

627
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:52,820
Oh.

628
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
Wait, these are the ones I got.

629
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,480
Okay, okay, okay.

630
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,320
I was like, wait a second.

631
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,280
Who have I?

632
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,660
Locked.

633
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,400
Monkey Man.

634
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,820
You're mine.

635
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,040
I can't buy it.

636
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,780
Indiana Jones Desert Disguise, you're mine.

637
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,020
I can't buy anyone else.

638
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,060
Oh, wait.

639
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,080
No, I can't.

640
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,560
Oh, wait.

641
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,420
Capitan, you're mine.

642
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,050
Let's go adventure.

643
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,930
full of doom

644
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:42,440
was she gonna sing anything goes oh

645
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:58,780
it's like simlish but like lego language instead actual noises

646
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,460
Oh my god, it was poison!

647
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,380
Oh no, I also drank it too!

648
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,300
I'm so stupid!

649
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,660
Oh my god, I'm dying?

650
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,160
Wait.

651
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,300
Oh, I can't do anything!

652
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,960
I gotta release the balloons!

653
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,570
Throw items to get it to destroy.

654
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,170
them.

655
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,510
Oh my god, he can't even hop.

656
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,770
Okay, we're just gonna have to do everything.

657
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,090
Wait, wait, no, no, no!

658
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,750
Oh no!

659
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,760
Okay, no, just kidding.

660
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,570
Dangos!

661
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,290
This is so cute.

662
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,170
Oh, oh, ah, ah.

663
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,630
Push, push this way.

664
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,350
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push.

665
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:05,750
Push, push.

666
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,490
Oh, I got him.

667
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,650
There we go.

668
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,350
I'm not quite sure if actually that was a right thing.

669
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,430
Oh, here.

670
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,310
Build a thing.

671
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,630
It says to throw stuff, but like...

672
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,170
I'm just gonna let Indy die at this rate.

673
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,370
Oh, you!

674
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,830
You need the blue antidote to secure him.

675
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,730
I know I'm trying!

676
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,210
What am I throwing, though?

677
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,730
Oh, here we go.

678
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,450
We're throwing this.

679
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,750
Throw it at him.

680
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,150
Ha ha!

681
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,600
Indy?

682
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,360
Wait, I can't switch to Indy.

683
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,440
Indy?

684
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,940
Is this the antidote?

685
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,360
No.

686
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,500
Oh, wait.

687
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,400
Let's throw this.

688
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh.

689
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,620
Pick it up.

690
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,760
Pick it up and throw.

691
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,060
There we go.

692
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,000
What do you do with it?

693
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,520
Where do you go?

694
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,780
Indy, you did?

695
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,260
Oh, I can switch to him now.

696
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,580
He's just hobbling along a little bit.

697
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,480
Oh, it's this?

698
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh, it's another one.

699
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,760
Oh, I see.

700
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,540
Where did he throw it to, though?

701
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,820
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

702
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,860
Okay, now you throw this one to that guy.

703
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,300
Oh, no, no, that's not what I wanted to do.

704
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,320
Okay, pick that up and throw it.

705
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,160
Throw it to him.

706
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:57,980
Okay.

707
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,440
Where did it, where did they throw it to?

708
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,720
That guy, okay, we need to find another one?

709
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,620
This is so goofy.

710
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,400
It's in here.

711
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,060
How do we get it, though?

712
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,250
Don't mind me, Indy.

713
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,250
You'll survive until you...

714
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,190
Until you need to.

715
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,370
You're fine.

716
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,570
Let's see, maybe...

717
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,370
I built this, but I don't know for what reason.

718
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,770
Oh, maybe to hop up here and then...

719
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,870
Ah, so close!

720
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,170
Wait, I'm so close.

721
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,910
I also, there's the dragon here, but I don't think Indy can get on top of it.

722
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,150
I don't think he has the strength.

723
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,290
Alright, Indy.

724
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,610
Come on.

725
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,070
Come on.

726
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,770
Come on, Indy.

727
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,650
You can do it.

728
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,590
Oh, wait, there's another one here.

729
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:14,890
Minky can't read.

730
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,870
What are you talking about?

731
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,510
I'm literally trying to do the stuff.

732
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,930
Okay, now that's...

733
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,890
Probably the dragon's the last one, right?

734
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,210
You didn't read the text.

735
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,370
What do you mean?

736
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,230
What text?

737
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,190
I didn't see text.

738
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,690
What, the text that's literally right there?

739
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,270
There's this one.

740
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,810
I think this is the last one.

741
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,290
What text?

742
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,370
Hold on.

743
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,570
What about him poison?

744
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,530
I could just stand here and scream?

745
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,070
A button

746
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,280
to push to scream.

747
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,100
There was a text that said, Oh, Willy's voice can shatter.

748
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,280
Oh, I didn't see that.

749
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,340
Ah!

750
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,400
That's why I scream.

751
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,520
There's, like, an actual reason to do so.

752
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,650
Drink it, drink it, drink it.

753
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,350
I thought the screaming was just for fun.

754
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,330
Oh, my gosh.

755
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,230
I'm going to...

756
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,170
Oh, okay.

757
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,330
That doesn't affect him at all.

758
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,470
Wait, okay, I think we need to go this way.

759
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,410
Indeed.

760
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,830
Oh, yeah, baby!

761
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,910
Oh.

762
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,310
We were so close to greatness.

763
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:09,770
We were so...

764
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,050
Why doesn't he not die?

765
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,750
What's happening?

766
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,390
Oh, my gosh.

767
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,070
Oh, we could dodge.

768
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:17,570
We're fine.

769
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,510
We'll dodge.

770
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,030
We'll dodge.

771
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,200
Maybe...

772
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,380
Oh.

773
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,480
Push!

774
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,740
Push it!

775
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,200
Oh.

776
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,780
I, uh...

777
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,540
Yes.

778
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,120
Wait.

779
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,760
Oh, we need to run behind it!

780
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,760
Okay, come here, come here.

781
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,740
We gotta get behind it.

782
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:49,640
Oh my god.

783
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,320
Oh,

784
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,010
okay.

785
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:55,830
Okay.

786
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,850
But I'm not quite sure.

787
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,070
What's the point here?

788
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,030
Wait.

789
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,180
Do I have to get the sword again?

790
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,020
Come here.

791
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,600
Oh, wait.

792
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,020
What's this?

793
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,080
Oh.

794
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,340
Wait.

795
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,000
What was the...

796
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,220
Oh.

797
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,080
Oh.

798
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,060
What were they...

799
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,640
What did they look at and we're laughing about?

800
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,920
Wait, what were they...

801
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,260
Oh, my God.

802
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:33,810
I'm him!

803
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,600
Short round!

804
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,220
Look how cute he is!

805
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,780
Little baby.

806
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,280
We need a feminine...

807
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,320
There we go.

808
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,020
Oh, okay, we need you to keep doing that.

809
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,280
Okay, miss?

810
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,520
Uh, no, no.

811
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,440
Uh, okay.

812
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,700
Wait.

813
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,220
You, you.

814
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,160
Do this.

815
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,260
Okay.

816
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,140
Okay, someone needs to get up there.

817
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,560
We need, um, where's the easiest way?

818
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,060
Oh, here?

819
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,220
Ah, okay, not you, though.

820
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,120
Indy, come here, come here.

821
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,500
You get up here.

822
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,100
Whose balloon is this?

823
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,440
Oh, oh, it's, I can't do this.

824
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,280
I need the thuggy character.

825
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,580
Childhood classic.

826
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,560
Could have missed stream.

827
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,260
Thanks for dropping by, though.

828
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,040
Thank you for the super chat.

829
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,080
Okay, here we go.

830
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,180
Alright, what does short round do, I wonder?

831
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,200
What's his little special skill?

832
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,680
Hold on, one moment.

833
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,620
I'm collecting money.

834
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,580
Of course, I missed the blue one.

835
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:02,880
Here we go.

836
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,180
Oh, jeez.

837
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,180
Okay, we have to get one more thing.

838
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,740
Is it on this side?

839
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,240
What's this?

840
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,380
No!

841
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,460
Wait!

842
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,180
Wait!

843
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,770
Oh my god!

844
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,170
We finally have...

845
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,330
Oh my god!

846
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,230
Oh, oh, oops.

847
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,210
Oh my god!

848
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,330
He's short!

849
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,570
He's so small!

850
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,530
He might be the shortest!

851
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,000
Wait, I'm not good at timing these!

852
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,720
Uh-huh!

853
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,760
Or I forgot it's not timing at all.

854
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,560
Holding it down.

855
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,540
Oh my god!

856
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,380
He's the most useful character!

857
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,060
Oops.

858
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:53,960
Okay.

859
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,380
He's a kid in the movie, Minto.

860
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,000
Um, no he's not.

861
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,060
He's short round.

862
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:03,860
Build.

863
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,180
He's also a genius.

864
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:06,680
Look at him!

865
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,420
He's an engineer!

866
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,000
Oh my god!

867
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,200
Look at him go!

868
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,420
Wow!

869
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,820
He's literally building a car!

870
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,560
At his age!

871
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,600
Uh-oh.

872
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:18,820
Oh!

873
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,700
Oh, uh-oh.

874
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,700
Yeah, uh-oh.

875
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,460
Yeah, uh-oh.

876
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,760
Let's get in the car.

877
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,380
Oh, we have to fix the car.

878
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,450
Don't shoot a kid, man.

879
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,870
Oh, I punched him on accident.

880
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,930
Grab that.

881
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,630
Anybody else in here?

882
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,230
Anybody else?

883
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,510
Oh, there's so much stuff here.

884
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,270
Wow, there's actually so much in this area.

885
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:59,050

888
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,510
I don't know what to tell you, man.

889
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,250
You might be thinking, I'm a secret genius, but...

890
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,490
Oh, I'm just leaving.

891
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:41,530
Okay, bye bye!

892
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,300
Oh, uh...

893
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:49,660
Hello!

894
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,480
I hope we don't get- Oh no!

895
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:55,420
God!

00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,130
We doing donuts!

897
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:01,770
Oh god!

898
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,920
Okay, we're fine.

899
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,940
Where did they actually come from?

900
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:31,600
Okay.

901
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,760
Alright, let's do things.

902
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,380
You.

903
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,600
Not you.

904
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,000
You.

905
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,440
Our little lady.

906
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,740
I like how in the movie she's like so...

907
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,540
Like, not wanting to work with them about doing anything?

908
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,080
She doesn't want to work with them at all, but in this she's like totally...

909
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,480
Oh!

910
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,100
Oh my gosh, we just built a little hole!

911
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,180
Okay, cool.

912
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:14,720
Yeah, she's useless in the movie and in this she's like actually an engineer and building and contributing to society.

913
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,360
How can I grab that?

914
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:24,870
Whoa.

915
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,050
Wait, maybe I...

916
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,610
I'm not as short as I think I am.

917
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,470
Wait, what if I put this like here?

918
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,550
Okay, I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

919
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,910
Oh, I'm drifting.

920
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,590
Why am I doing that?

921
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,090
Why does he do that?

922
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,770
Why is he doing that, actually?

923
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,690
Wait, what?

924
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:53,750
What's happening?

925
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:57,870
Depth perception.

926
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,570
Is it my depth perception?

927
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,550
I can't tell.

928
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,110
I wish I could change the camera angle.

929
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,550
I don't think I can stand.

930
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,310
on it.

931
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,790
Dang, I really had a good thing going, I think.

932
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,250
Alright, somebody else take this.

933
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,330
Indy, you take it.

934
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,550
Why can't I stand on it?

935
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,610
Why can't I, why not?

936
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,050
And we're also, like, having to fix this plane ourselves.

937
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,640
What is this?

938
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,000
Oh, a forklift.

939
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,380
I am not certified.

940
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,880
Maybe Maybe I should get Forklift certified on stream.

941
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,660
Oh, oops.

942
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,440
Is Indy certified?

943
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,800
It's Indiana Jones!

944
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,900
He's gotta be!

945
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,700
Oh, oh my gosh.

946
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,100
So sorry, everybody.

947
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,580
My depth perception strikes again.

948
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,280
What?

949
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,440
Wait, how?

950
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,820
Maybe we drew this.

951
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,760
out of the way oh wait this is not a vehicle this is wait ah here we go wait

952
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:36,740
okay stay up there oh come on it doesn't stay up though let's try let's try what's her name

953
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:49,140
i don't think teamwork will help here i'm not quite sure Okay, this is fine.

954
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,140
Oh, I need Indy here.

955
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,300
Oh, no.

956
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,940
Oh, it does have to be Indiana Jones.

957
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:57,800
Okay, hold on.

958
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,680
If I use the forklift, I...

959
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,180
Oh!

960
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,480
Wait, he jumped on top!

961
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,000
And, um...

962
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,920
Uh...

963
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,840
Yes, sir.

964
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,160
Uh...

965
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,840
Where do you want to go?

966
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,280
Wait, wait.

967
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,600
Huh?

968
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,310
Where did he go?

969
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:27,150
Indy?

970
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,040
Uh, let's see.

971
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,100
Alright, hold on.

972
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Is there anything over here?

973
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,820
Let me just text.

974
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:50,580
Ow!

975
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,100
Ah!

976
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:51,840
Ouch!

977
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,380
Ouch!

978
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,820
Um, I was just...

979
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,620
I didn't put your gun away, please!

980
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,480
I...

981
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,380
I accidentally I accidentally killed myself trying to beat this thing up, which I guess you can't do?

982
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,580
It's the box that kills you.

983
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,120
Actually, why would they put it next to the box that doesn't kill you then?

984
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,980
That's really misleading.

985
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,660
And very unfair.

986
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,020
As a forklift operator who's currently at work, you're certified!

987
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,060
Oh!

988
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,300
I'm certified, I'm certified!

989
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,640
Okay, let's see.

990
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,720
I wish, though, Indy...

991
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,160
Okay, maybe what we do is this.

992
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,000
Okay, hold on.

993
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:50,870
Okay.

994
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,690
And then we lift up, and then we switch to Indy.

995
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,370
Okay, I don't think that's what we do.

996
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:01,710
Alright, lift.

997
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:02,830
Okay.

998
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:03,930
Yeah.

999
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:09,750
Um...

1000
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,350
Oh!

1001
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:11,810
Oh!

1002
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,370
Oh!

1003
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,530
I gamed, I gamed it, I gamed it!

1004
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:17,590
I'm a gamer.

1005
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,990
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

1006
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:30,410
Minto gaming, me- Minto gaming, meinto gaming.

1007
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,690
Alright, let's build whatever this thing is.

1008
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,670
Anything goes.

1009
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:38,970
Oh.

1010
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,230
Alright, I think we need that.

1011
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,410
I think that's pretty necessary.

1012
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,520
Wait, but this isn't how the movie goes?

1013
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,280
Wait,

1014
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:06,150
this actually isn't how the movie goes, because they get into, like, that freight train, or train, oh, the plane.

1015
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:11,030
And then, whip the engine.

1016
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,790
Wait, oh, I think I get on here and do it.

1017
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:16,610
Okay,

1018
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,490
how do I get up here, though?

1019
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,150
Oh, I think we gotta do the same thing with the forklift.

1020
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,230
We can jump on the car.

1021
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:29,990
Might be a little easier.

1022
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,680
I can jump on the car, right?

1023
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,840
Wait, where is he going?

1024
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,460
Wait!

1025
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,540
What are you doing, kid?

1026
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,400
Stop!

1027
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,280
He's sabotaging the mission!

1028
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,580
I don't think actually I can jump on this car.

1029
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,800
Wait, why not?

1030
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,200
That's mysterious.

1031
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,560
Why?

1032
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,120
I wonder.

1033
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1034
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,780
Get out of the car.

1035
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,260
There we go.

1036
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:19,600
Okay.

1037
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,440
Yeah, I think we need to lift again.

1038
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,020
Oh, he did it himself.

1039
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,720
Nice.

1040
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,480
He actually was useful.

1041
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,020
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

1042
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,090
Lego Smith's sleep apnea.

1043
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,870
Yeah.

1044
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,190
He needs a LEGO CFAP machine.

1045
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,470
Oh the chickens!

1046
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,470
Oh gosh!

1047
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:19,730
That looks mighty close.

1048
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,090
Wait, are we gonna have like a...

1049
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:34,550
Oh dang.

1050
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:35,510
Wait.

1051
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:44,050
It would be so funny if they gave us like a little mini game where we're surfing down the river.

1052
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,610
We have to avoid rocks and stuff.

1053
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,450
The sled section?

1054
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,030
Okay, ready for the sound.

1056
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,890
I don't think we heard it so bad this time.

1057
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,030
Oh, nope.

1058
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,670
We completely avoided that section.

1059
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,430
Too violent.

1060
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,070
Oh!

1061
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,490
Man!

1062
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,090
He's bald!

1063
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:29,790
Hello!

1064
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,570
Okay, I've seen the movie, but if I hadn't, this would be nonsense.

1065
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,290
That would make no sense to me.

1066
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,610
Also, why the heck was that just sitting there?

1067
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,230
Oh,

1068
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,670
there's spiders in here.

1069
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,630
That special treasure chest was just sitting there.

1070
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,830
Oh, the elephant's so cute.

1071
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,110
I like how things explode.

1072
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,130
It's not something I'm quite over yet.

1073
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:32,910
It's so funny.

1074
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,730
They skipped the scene where Willy was being difficult.

1075
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,170
They skipped so much.

1076
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,130
But you know what?

1077
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,710
I'm okay because she's actually tolerable.

1078
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,090
Oh, oh!

1079
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:53,010
She's so much more tolerable in this, you know?

1080
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:56,170
Are they okay?

1081
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,150
Are they afraid of a shovel?

1082
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,460
Why are they?

1083
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,320
What's wrong with them?

1084
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh.

1085
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,100
Oh.

1086
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,340
Oops.

1087
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Sorry.

1088
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,120
I thought I could, um...

1089
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,080
Come here, come here, come here.

1090
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,400
Alright, let's go.

1091
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,100
Chris, we need to pick up Highlight.

1092
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,680
Maybe they're afraid of the snakes.

1093
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,560
Elephants like to play in the mud.

1094
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,460
That's so cute.

1095
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,440
Okay, now they can come over.

1096
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,680
Or the elephant is gonna stab- Oh!

1097
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,080
Oh!

1098
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,420
I forgot, Indy's afraid of snakes.

1099
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,060
How could I forget?

1100
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,220
Um, alright, Miss.

1101
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,280
I think short round just died.

1102
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:45,500
Uh-oh.

1103
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,120
How did you forget that?

1104
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,540
Well, in the context of the game, you know?

1105
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:05,960
I remember in the movies that he's, you know, afraid, but in the game I forgot.

1106
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,410
Snakes.

1107
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,310
Why did it have to be snakes?

1108
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:27,470
Nice.

1109
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:28,970
Good job.

1110
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:30,190
All right.

1111
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,200
We're gonna meet her in a second.

1112
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:37,700
What is this?

1113
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,160
Is this a boat?

1114
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,060
Wait, where are we driving to?

1115
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,900
Oh, just kidding.

1116
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,520
Oh, God.

1117
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,780
Everybody out of the water!

1118
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:57,650
Is he clapping?

1119
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:05,720
Oh, my God.

1120
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,840
I thought why is to control it, no?

1121
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,620
Oh, my gosh.

1122
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,820
Why is to get on the boat, no?

1123
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,000
Or is it...

1124
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,290
Maybe only Indy can pilot it.

1125
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:21,650
Nope.

1126
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:22,970
They just...

1127
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,230
They just go into the water.

1128
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:25,230
Wait, there it is.

1129
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,250
Oh, there's the symbol.

1130
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,110
Oh, my God.

1131
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,190
I found it!

1132
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:28,930
I got the symbol!

1133
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,310
You need the shovel!

1134
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,750
Oh gosh, are they okay?

1135
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,210
Are they gonna be alright?

1136
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:35,310
Get on!

1137
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,930
Oh my god, there's so many alligators!

1138
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,560
We're fine, they'll be fine.

1139
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:48,760
Oh!

1140
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,780
Wait, they can go on land?

1141
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,640
Or I think Short Round has pushed the...

1142
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,820
I think they...

1143
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,400
I think he has pushed him onto the...

1144
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
Oh!

1145
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,320
Oh!

1146
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,640
That's so silly.

1147
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:13,280
BAM!

1148
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:13,680
BAM!

1149
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,300
BAM!

1150
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,700
I will create and then I will destroy it.

1151
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,560
Hey, that's my boat.

1152
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,580
Alright, everybody on!

1153
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,060
Okay, never mind.

1154
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,260
Good luck!

1155
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,580
Good luck getting back!

1156
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,480
I will create and then I will destroy and then I will create again!

1157
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,230
Alright, but we do need them over here because we in a little lagging here.

1158
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:46,490
Oh, wow.

1159
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,370
Look at all those snakes!

1160
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:51,990
Wow.

1161
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:06,080
Oh.

1162
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,210
The scream button is so funny.

1163
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:18,410
It's actually maybe my favorite thing ever.

1164
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,290
Wait, no, no, no.

1165
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:25,960
No.

1166
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,360
I want you to scream.

1167
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,810
Wait, how do I- oh, there it is.

1168
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:37,350
I push it.

1169
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,130
Or I pull it.

1170
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:39,450
Push it.

1171
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:40,490
Pull it.

1172
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,130
Pop it.

1173
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:50,510
Okay, Indy, if you're- why did you- why did you come over here if you're gonna be like such a little baby about it, okay?

1174
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:55,110
Go back- I'll see you on the other- just don't even bother.

1175
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:56,210
Just don't even bother.

1176
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,730
Short route's gonna kill him.

1177
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:04,030
Pop it.

1178
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,130
Twist it.

1179
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:07,750
Beep it.

1180
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:08,430
Boop it.

1181
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,030
Yay!

1182
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:12,890
Oh, Indy?

1183
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,750
Will you do the honors, please?

1184
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,110
What does short round do?

1185
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,450
What is it because...

1186
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:22,970
Oh, nothing.

1187
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,990
You just sit there looking cute and charming.

1188
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,850
Just the little guy he is.

1189
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:29,570
Oh, okay.

1190
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:33,510
Let's ride.

1191
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:35,230
Let's ride.

1192
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,030
Easy?

1193
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:45,450
Easy peasy.

1194
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,350
Oh, what are all these bananas for?

1195
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:54,750
Oh.

1196
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,080
Alright, head back here.

1197
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,200
Indy, I need you on this side.

1198
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:08,120
Because we still have the shovel, so we can dig this up.

1199
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,860
He's short.

1200
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,160
I feel like we've had this conversation.

1201
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,520
We might have and I just...

1202
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,280
You know.

1203
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,980
I might have just been like...

1204
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,580
I don't know.

1205
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,240
What the hell are these?

1206
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,180
Oh, I think we need the...

1207
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,540
The...

1208
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,600
Banana to give to the monkey.

1209
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:33,480
Okay.

1210
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,080
Wait.

1211
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,300
Wait.

1212
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,390
All right, get banana.

1213
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:44,850
Get banana.

1214
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:46,390
Oh, shoot.

1215
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,090
Oh, that was close.

1216
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,960
Anyway, oh, he's got the thing.

1217
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,180
I could just kick his ass.

1218
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,420
Oh, no, I can't.

1219
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,220
Ah, it's a spider!

1220
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,340
Okay, oh, sorry.

1221
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,060
Okay, so she's She's afraid of spiders.

1222
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,400
Well, she is afraid of bugs, that makes sense.

1223
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:16,940
Cute!

1224
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,800
Um, how do I get the banana?

1225
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:29,140
It wouldn't let me grab it on the...

1226
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,220
Maybe Indy can whip it.

1227
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:33,640
Hmm.

1228
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,830
Maybe I can whip it...

1229
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:39,090
Ow!

1230
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:39,570
Like, oh.

1231
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:44,830
Well, I'm an elephant, but I need the elephant to come over here.

1232
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:49,450
Or...

1233
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:50,190
Okay, come here.

1234
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,350
Oh, nope.

1235
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,290
There we go.

1236
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,270
Okay, I can't whip while on the elephant.

1237
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:04,030
Oh my gosh, and he killed me.

1238
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:05,470
Um...

1239
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:09,450
Let me try whipping it from this side.

1240
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:11,930
Oh!

1241
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:16,410
Oh!

1242
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:18,610
Okay.

1243
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,310
Wait, there was a target.

1244
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:22,730
Oh, there we go.

1245
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:23,790
Oh my gosh.

1246
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,870
This is so messed up.

1247
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,510
Whipping real good.

1248
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,370
Hey, you want this?

1249
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:39,470
Give me.

1250
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,850
You know how many times I died trying to get this?

1251
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,630
Nice aim.

1252
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,190
Thanks.

1253
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,790
I don't care if you're being sarcastic.

1254
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,250
I don't think I care.

1255
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:03,730
Wait, elephant, come back?

1256
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:05,550
Oh, here we go.

1257
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,450
I'm just gonna go stomp on it.

1258
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,000
Holy moly!

1259
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,300
Oh.

1260
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,710
Okay, um, do we...

1261
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,830
Someone said don't forget to shovel, but do we need it?

1262
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:40,130
Did I lose the other one?

1263
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,220
Oh, okay.

1264
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,280
I literally just found out the answer.

1265
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,800
Like, right now I found out the answer.

1266
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,280
Like, actually at this moment, I found out the answer.

1267
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,070
It was a massacre.

1268
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:11,030
We killed every living creature in this forest.

1269
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:20,960
Yes.

1270
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,440
Yes.

1271
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,520
I will become the truest adventurer.

1272
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,460
Yeah.

1273
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:32,440
Okay.

1274
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,080
All right.

1275
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,160
Onwards.

1276
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,500
Wait, what's up here?

1277
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:40,920
Nothing.

1278
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,500
All right, Indy, I believe in you.

1279
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,340
Face your fears.

1280
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,100
Face your fears.

1281
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,240
Face your fears.

1282
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,440
Okay.

1283
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,780
I think that was it.

1284
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,700
I think that was it.

1285
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,830
What have we got going on here?

1286
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,030
Alright, everybody, teamwork!

1287
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:15,610
Oh!

1288
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,470
Even the elephant knows what to do.

1289
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:20,130
Okay.

1290
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,330
Even the elephant cooperates.

1291
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:26,870
Is he stuck down there?

1292
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,310
We'll never see him again.

1293
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:32,890
Oh.

1294
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:35,730
That's it!

1295
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,270
That's it for our dear friend!

1296
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:39,470
Alright, let's go.

1297
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,290
Elephants are very smart.

1298
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:47,450
Wait, is there anything over here?

1299
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,010
Secret.

1300
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,130
Nothing.

1301
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,120
Hello!

1302
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,180

Oh yes, thank you for this meal.

1307
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,090
Oh no.

1308
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:56,450
Oh my god!

1309
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:01,130
Why are we getting beat up here?

1310
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:05,090
Okay, cool.

1311
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:06,830
What's that sound?

1312
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:14,450
Take that, take that, and move it to somewhere.

1313
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:16,690
Oh, it's that guy.

1314
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,850
He's making a bunch of noise.

1315
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:19,550
Let's see.

1316
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,290
Over here?

1317
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:20,750
No.

1318
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1319
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,900
I destroy you and your tables.

1320
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,700
And your monkey brains.

1321
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,520
And your gauntlet, goblet, goblins, goblets.

1322
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,540
Shut up.

1323
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:47,280
Oh, sorry.

1324
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,320
Not you, Shorty.

1325
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:48,520
Oops.

1326
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,660
Not you, Shorty.

1327
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,760
I didn't mean it.

1328
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,180
I was talking about the bug.

1329
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:55,920
Hello?

1330
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:57,820
Hello?

1331
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,640
There we go.

1332
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,320
Wait, why isn't it working?

1333
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,880
Not the child!

1334
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,900
Guys, I'm struggling.

1335
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,650
I think the game...

1336
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,720
is silly.

1337
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,220
It's missing a gear.

1338
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,080
Oh, is it...

1339
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,080
this metal gear, perhaps?

1340
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,540
Nah.

1341
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,780
Oh, the lava crawler.

1342
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,650
But what's up there?

1343
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,150
What is this thing up here?

1344
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,090
How mysterious.

1345
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,380
Okay, Indy, you stand here.

1346
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,770
It's a new secret.

1347
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:11,930
I want it!

1348
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:17,310
I was gonna have him sit in there and she'd jump on him.

1349
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,030
It was my foolproof plan!

1350
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:24,630
Indiana Jones!

1351
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:28,470
Why?

1352
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:32,550
Wait, there's like a big old guy up there too.

1353
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,530
Try the fountain.

1354
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:36,170
Fountain?

1355
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:38,490
You guys see a fountain?

1356
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,000
It's a parcel for an extra, you can only get it in free play.

1357
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:46,360
Uh...

1358
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:46,920
Boom!

1359
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:47,700
Boom!

1360
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:48,280
Boom!

1361
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,060
Uh...

1362
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,200
My plan!

1363
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,440
My plan was so smart!

1364
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,120
Okay.

1365
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,100
Onwards.

1366
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:11,170
Guys, is it time for Lego sexual tension?

1367
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:14,610
Oops, bye-bye.

1368
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:20,950
We're gonna go to our rooms, and we're gonna be like, You want me.

1369
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:22,730
No, you Lego want me.

1370
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,130
No, you Lego want me.

1371
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,230
They just drop from the ceilings.

1372
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,060
I think they skipped that.

1373
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,200
Dang.

1374
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,040
We're missing all the best parts.

1375
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,960
You Lego want me.

1376
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,960
No, you Lego want me.

1377
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,360
Never let go of me.

1378
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,140
No minus two that.

1379
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,160
That was pretty good.

1380
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,220
Oh, we need the thuggy, man.

1381
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,420
Oh!

1382
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,000
I've got it.

1383
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,380
in so many this time.

1384
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,920
Are you saying they're going to be bricked off?

1385
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,500
They're already brixed!

1386
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:35,480
Bricks!

1387
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,780
Brick, brick!

1388
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,440
It's already happened!

1389
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,720
Plus two.

1390
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,340
Thank you.

1391
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:48,560
Dang it.

1392
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,600
You were talking about me, right?

1393
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,260
Oh!

1394
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,240
I'm freaking decapitating people.

1395
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,700
I'm killing them.

1396
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,100
I'm killing them one by one.

1397
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,020
Wait, what is this?

1398
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,040
This is fancy.

1399
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:24,380
Wait, what are these?

1400
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,420
This is so secretive.

1401
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:32,650
They cut out the statue scene.

1402
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,670
They cut out the scene where they're in the bedrooms and, like, you know, do them.

1403
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:38,570
Oh.

1404
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:41,770
Sorry.

1405
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,650
Sorry, shorty.

1406
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:43,650
Sorry.

1407
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:46,250
I'm shattering glass now!

1408
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,910
Oops.

1409
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,420
Oh my god, the music.

1410
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:54,960
Wait!

1411
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,380
You Lego want me!

1412
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,120
Oh my god!

1413
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:58,640
Sorry.

1414
01:19:59,100 --> 01:19:59,600
Sorry, Indy.

1415
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,740
I got too, way too excited.

1416
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,820
We're Lego building the bed!

1417
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:14,900
Indy.

1418
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,180
Indy.

1419
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,120
Indiana Jones!

1420
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,680
Indiana Jones!

1421
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,970
What's this?

1422
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,150
Oh, my bad.

1423
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:36,570
She's just screaming.

1424
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:41,290
So we have to figure out- wait, so we built the bed.

1425
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,820
Oh, was this so- wait.

1426
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,060
Oh, we just destroy it.

1427
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,600
Who would have thunk?

1428
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,960
But all you have to do is destroy it!

1429
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:14,640
Alright.

1430
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:24,680
Well, of course we can't do any, you know, sexual tension here because we got Shorty.

1431
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,580
He doesn't know anything.

1432
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,540
He doesn't think about that kind of stuff.

1433
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,760
Oh, sorry.

1434
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,420
He doesn't even know what a boob is.

1435
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,120
And we're gonna keep it that way.

1436
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,720
We're gonna keep it that way.

1437
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:52,810
Wait, and we got the book!

1438
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:54,410
Okay.

1439
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:56,030
Alright, read.

1440
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:01,090
Down, middle, right.

1441
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,110
Wait.

1442
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,490
Down, middle.

1443
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,970
I got it.

1444
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:12,670
I only know that word from Drake and Josh.

1445
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,090
And so would he.

1446
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,410
That's the only way he would know, too.

1447
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,620
Kill him!

1448
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,120
Kill him!

1449
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:25,460
Kill him!

1450
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:25,480
Kill him!

1451
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,140
Till they're dead!

1452
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:31,570
Oh, my bad.

1453
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,630
I guess if that's what...

1454
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,450
Wait, when it goes back?

1455
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,130
Oh.

1456
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:40,830
Wait, is this the sexy statue that they push the boobs in to open the door?

1457
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:44,870
It's all here!

1458
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:45,770
It's all here!

1459
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:47,350
Oh!

1460
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,910
It's all here!

1461
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:58,630
You guys remember from the movie!

1462
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:03,330
And she's all embarrassed about having to push in the boobs.

1463
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:05,830
Oh!

1464
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,720
That's spooky.

1465
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,300
I never watched the movie.

1466
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,240
Uh-oh.

1467
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,820
Wait, how do we do it, though?

1468
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,400
How do we do it, though?

1469
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,080
Indy, this is a job for you.

1470
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:50,330
How do I pull?

1471
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,190
These games hit different.

1472
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:02,390
What could I possibly be building here?

1473
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,310
Oh my gosh, look at the little Lego portrait.

1474
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:07,210
The

1475
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:10,910
bed?

1476
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:11,910
What about the bed?

1477
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,410
We already used it to its true purpose.

1478
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,890
His purpose was he...

1479
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:20,690
Oh, wait!

1480
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,650
Wow, just kidding.

1481
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,390
We did not use it to its true purpose.

1482
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:30,450
I thought it was just for the chest, but it is not.

1483
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,150
No, they replaced it.

1484
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,530
Oh, we gotta build her boobs.

1485
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:42,590
Yeah, see, we built them.

1486
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,310
We built them.

1487
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:44,670
They're under there.

1488
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:46,710
Did you see?

1489
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:47,870
Okay.

1490
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:52,490
Oh,

1491
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,420
spooky music.

1492
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,720
We're a very spooky area.

1493
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,320
Oh, sorry.

1494
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:12,740
Wait.

1495
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,240
How am I supposed to grab that chest, though?

1496
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,140
How the hell did you get over here?

1497
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,260
Oops.

1498
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,700
It's all up to you, Shorty.

1499
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,320
How do you get that?

1500
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:32,240
You gotta...

1501
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,060
Wait, maybe...

1502
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,080
Indy can dive.

1503
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:39,660
Ha ha!

1504
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,190
Yes.

1505
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,630
I may be a genius.

1506
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:55,550
I don't remember this place being so...

1507
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:56,950
Big.

1508
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:58,830
Yep.

1509
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,500
I don't remember it being this large.

1510
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,200
Yeah.

1511
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,120
Okay.

1512
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:12,720
Okay.

1513
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:17,380
Oh.

1514
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:18,520
Oh.

1515
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,660
I'm doing something.

1516
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,320
Wait, this is for Shorty, right?

1517
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,200
I love your hat.

1518
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,860
Thank you!

1519
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:33,680
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

1520
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:34,640
Come, come, come, come, come.

1521
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:36,340
Your services are needed.

1522
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,240
Come, come, come, come, come, come.

1523
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:42,520
Oh.

1524
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:46,840
Oh, he got it.

1525
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,280
He has to do the other side.

1526
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,400
Oh, okay.

1527
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,540
Okay, one more time.

1528
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:01,060
Why is my maid so yee-haw today?

1529
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:02,560
Yee-haw!

1530
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,340
Oh, and Indy's gotta, okay.

1531
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,440
We gotta do it at the same time.

1532
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,080
Because we're a team!

1533
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,080
There's a whole lot of spatters.

1534
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,880
Watch out, ma'am.

1535
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,260
I'll get you over here right safe.

1536
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,100
I promise you.

1537
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:34,960
Wait.

1538
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,160
Oh, here we go.

1539
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,420
Uh, wait.

1540
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,940
Can we make a path if we throw the fire?

1541
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,640
Or is that only the...

1542
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,540
Uh, the snakes?

1543
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,380
Wait, where'd my...

1544
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:00,280
Wait, where'd it go?

1545
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,480
Oh, I'm holding it.

1546
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:02,840
I think.

1547
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,120
Here we go.

1548
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,040
Oh, no.

1549
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,400
This...

1550
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:06,840
Maybe...

1551
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1552
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,580
Come on, friends.

1553
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,020
Wait, what happened?

1554
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:22,110
Uh-oh.

1555
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:22,650
Uh-oh.

1556
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:23,330
Uh-oh.

1557
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:23,470
Oh.

1558
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,620
Okay, I think they need to, um...

1559
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:31,060
No!

1560
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:31,960
My stuff!

1561
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,820
I think they need to jump first.

1562
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:36,340

01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:21,960
Really?

1568
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:26,760
We'll wait for both of them to respawn, so we'll have maximum firepower.

1569
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,260
Then I'll throw one in there, and then...

1570
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,800
I don't know.

1571
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,940
To be honest, am I just stupid?

1572
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:36,280
Throw?

1573
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:36,760
Grab.

1574
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:37,460
Alright.

1575
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,760

Stick close.

01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,140
Oh my gosh!

1581
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:50,740

He's fine.

1593
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:44,350
No one dies in Lego.

1594
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:53,770
Let me skip

1595
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,420
the heart scene.

1596
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,040
It's too...

1597
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,640
Wait, prepare for the sound?

1598
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:10,140
It's too- it's too rated R for our little...

1599
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,960
E for everyone game.

1600
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,100
When I was a kid, this part...

1601
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,360
Oh, sorry, I missed it.

1602
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,240
Were you saying that that part scared you?

1603
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,860
Oh my gosh, we were so close!

1604
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:34,190
Welcome to membership!

1605
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:35,310
Thank you!

1606
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,790
Thank you, thank you.

1607
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,980
This part is still freaky.

1608
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,260
Even as just little Lego guys.

1609
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,160
They have the things that we're looking for.

1610
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,920
The little breads.

1611
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,140
Ah!

1612
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,340
Oh!

1613
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,660
Okay, she's gone now.

1614
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,240
Okay.

1615
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:57,940
Um... Okay.

1616
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,800
Wow, there's a lot of guys down there.

1617
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,160
Wait, that's not good.

1618
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:02,660
Short round!

1619
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,920
Oh my god, you're...

1620
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,120
He's going to sacrifice himself!

1621
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,360
Why did you do that?

1622
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:11,600
Take this?

1623
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,560
Okay, yeah.

1624
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:24,670
No, it's not the last chest because this is a different chapter unfortunately.

1625
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:27,050
Okay, so...

1626
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:30,830
Oh!

1627
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:31,990
Okay, just kidding.

1628
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,450
I gotta go this way.

1629
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:36,030
Oh my god!

1630
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:38,970
There's so many guys.

1631
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:40,450
Where are you going?

1632
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,130
Nope.

1633
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,130
You're dead.

1634
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,910
You're done, Zo.

1635
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:46,490
I need you, short round.

1636
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:47,730
I need you.

1637
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:51,310
Um, how can we fix this?

1638
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,330
What if I go down?

1639
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,010
Because there's also a chest down there.

1640
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:55,950
Oops.

1641
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:57,530
And you die.

1642
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:58,590
Okay, good to know.

1643
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:06,270
There's a lot going on in here.

1644
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,610
Okay.

1645
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:10,030
There's so much going on right now.

1646
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:10,390
Okay.

1647
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,170
What is this?

1648
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:13,830
Oh.

1649
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:28,250
So many torches.

1650
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:31,250
For what purpose?

1651
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,550
Hmm.

1652
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:43,950
Oh, wait, there's a ladder here.

1653
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:46,630
Oh.

1654
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,120
Oh, I'm not hitting a single guy.

1655
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,220
I'm not hitting anybody.

1656
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:54,540
Oh, sorry, Shorama.

1657
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,400
Dylan, don't get in my way, buddy.

1658
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,340
It's dangerous.

1659
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,460
It's so dangerous here.

1660
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,840
Okay.

1661
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,820
What is this?

1662
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,920
Let's push it down.

1663
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:17,100
Oh, we're like awfully close to the lava, but like risk it for the biscuit.

1664
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:22,180
Because the money is great.

1665
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:26,800
Okay, we put this over here.

1666
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,040
Oh my gosh.

1667
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,280
We're like doing actual parkour.

1668
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,520
Wait, okay, hold on.

1669
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:34,820
Oh!

1670
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,240
Oh!

1671
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,820
This is how we...

1672
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:37,220
Oh!

1673
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,560
This is how we...

1674
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,880
Some puzzles can only be completed by pressing Y.

1675
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,240
I take control of another character.

1676
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,840
Oh, I need him to...

1677
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:48,820
Push this.

1678
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:02,600
Um...

1679
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:07,440
Short round, don't do it!

1680
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,060
Oh.

1681
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,400
Um...

1682
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:13,880
Wait.

1683
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:14,600
Um...

1684
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:18,920
How do we get it back?

1685
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:29,370
Just like that.

1686
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:35,070
And let's put this on here, because I don't think I can...

1687
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:37,430
Alright.

1688
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,770
Beam me up!

1689
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:43,130
I don't think I can...

1690
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:43,930
Oh, geez.

1691
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:44,830
Okay, there we go.

1692
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:45,290
Nice.

1693
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:47,530
I don't think I can climb the ladder with it.

1694
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,270
That's what I was trying to say.

1695
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:51,190
Okay, aye!

1696
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:53,430
Okay, now we just need the other one.

1697
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,220
Oh, where?

1698
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,340
Oh, where?

1699
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:03,540
Where?

1700
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,820
Oh, where do we get it from?

1701
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,640
Oh, I have to somehow get him over here.

1702
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,580
Wait, what is this?

1703
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:12,060
Wait.

1704
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,260
Go downstairs.

1705
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,860
Oh, oh my gosh.

1706
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:20,860
Good thing he had a quick hand.

1707
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,320
Uh...

1708
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:27,760
Wait.

1709
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,760
I thought there would be more ledges than that.

1710
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:34,740
Um...

1711
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:37,880
Okay.

1712
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,600
Uh...

1713
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,290
My plan was foiled?

1714
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:45,990
Foiled?

1715
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:47,250
It's spoiled again.

1716
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,300
Gotta find a way to bring the bridge up.

1717
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:53,880
Yeah!

1718
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,800
I'm just trying to...

1719
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,580
I don't see it, like...

1720
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,340
you bring a bridge up.

1721
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:09,790
Like, knocking it down with, like, all these torches would be...

1722
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:11,370
What if I go down, instead?

1723
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,330
Oh, I just...

1724
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:16,370
I got money.

1725
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:19,010
Hmm.

1726
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,740
We gotta do the thingy!

1727
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,920
Right side is the example.

1728
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:26,900
Wait, what do you mean?

1729
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,040
Oh!

1730
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,500
Like, with the...

1731
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,940
The thing below?

1732
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:47,250
Oh, I see, I see.

1733
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:48,950
You do need the torches.

1734
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:51,930
Wow.

1735
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:54,450
Who designed this?

1736
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:58,270
Who designed this?

1737
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,150
This design is whack.

1738
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,890
Oh my gosh.

1739
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:07,450
That one was the most puzzly puzzle we could have gotten.

1740
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:13,210
Oh.

1741
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:16,070
Oh, you know what?

1742
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,070
Actually, yeah, you can bring this down.

1743
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:22,350
You're so strong!

1744
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:26,630
Okay, yeah, let me handle it.

1745
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:28,490
Okay, we're about the same speed.

1746
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:32,110
They give you four torches.

1747
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:33,190
I don't know.

1748
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,310
I didn't think about the torches.

1749
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:36,750
I was thinking about everything else.

1750
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:52,970
I got every other puzzle so far I get tripped up on one And you guys are like Damn she's dumb Damn she can't even Look at the torch is stupid God

1751
01:39:57,430 --> 01:40:05,710
Oh so close Wait I think if I die I can get it Everybody Hmm

1752
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,320
I did not mean to do that.

1753
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,040
I like how it's burning in my pants.

1754
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,020
Wait, can I get back up here?

1755
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,000
Oh, I don't think I can.

1756
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,520
Oh, wait, I can.

1757
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,180
Oh, take that out and then put that...

1758
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:45,480
Oh, oh, but I can't put it here.

1759
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:46,400
Okay, just kidding.

1760
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,360
I thought it might do something.

1761
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:49,820
I don't know.

1762
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:52,120
I was thinking outside the box.

1763
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,480
I was thinking...

1764
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,140
Man, maybe I came up with something.

1765
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:58,000
Like a little bit of a genius idea.

1766
01:40:59,000 --> 01:40:59,900
I don't know.

1767
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:03,780
Oh my gosh.

1768
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,420
Take that.

1769
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:11,160
Take the money.

1770
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,160
I'll take the money and I'll go around.

1771
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,240
There's a thing up there.

1772
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,180
It was worth a shot.

1773
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,120
I had an idea, an inkling of an idea.

1774
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:27,320
Oh!

1775
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,160
Oh, what's wrong with me?

1776
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,560
Why did I do that?

1777
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:38,700
Oh, shawati.

1778
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:40,440
Oh, shawati.

1779
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:48,970
Rip money.

1780
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:51,850
My money.

1781
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:55,630
Yeah, I need these to line up again.

1782
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,330
All right.

1783
01:41:57,630 --> 01:42:00,590
I can't freaking see.

1784
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:01,790
Oh, my gosh.

1785
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:13,950
wish I could move the oh I did it again I wish I could move the camera over just a little bit or like turn it a little bit

1786
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:25,870
I'm just being greedy I don't need it oh my gosh grab it grab it Indy grab it

1787
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:43,680
hey why didn't she get that Come on!

1788
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:44,280
Come on!

1789
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,680
Wait, how do I get up from here?

1790
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,080
We're holding?

1791
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:12,670
Oh my gosh, the things are not aligning at all.

1792
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,050
I don't know if I can reach the rope.

1793
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:20,670
I'll try.

1794
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,240
It's worth a shot, I suppose.

1795
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,280
Oh!

1796
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,920
Oh, I can reach the rock.

1797
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,120
Even better.

1798
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,140
Actually, though, let's try this rope.

1799
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,880
Oh, okay.

1800
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:37,540
Good job.

1801
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:41,490
We're swinging.

1802
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:42,110
We're swinging.

1803
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:44,050
We're swinging.

1804
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:44,310
We're swinging.

1805
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:45,150
We're not swinging.

1806
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:53,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1807
01:43:57,470 --> 01:44:01,830
I couldn't watch the movies until I was older and was this game as my only source of info for seven years.

1808
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:07,990
round was just a very small adult veil you probably would think that yeah

1809
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:16,440
you probably would think that

1810
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:35,000
i also well i never played this game but i did not watch the movies until recently i think you're softlocked because you didn't get to Shut up!

1811
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,100
Don't scare me like that!

1812
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,900
Don't scare me!

1813
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:48,170
I thought you were serious!

1814
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:54,890
Oh, okay.

1815
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:55,850
Okay.

1816
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:56,710
Alright.

1817
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,470
Okay.

1818
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,280
You forgot the shovel for real though.

1819
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:04,980
I don't- I did not see one.

1820
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,440
There was many things to dig up and I did not see one.

1821
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,060
not see.

1822
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:12,760
Wait, was this area optional?

1823
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,380
Wait, huh?

1824
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,060
Wait.

1825
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:25,460
One of my kitties, Marilyn, who is notoriously shy, loves to come out when she hears you.

1826
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,360
My other guy, Ernie, likes to pretend he doesn't like you.

1827
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,120
He might just not like me.

1828
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:33,600
All this for money!

1829
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,280
When I've lost so much of our...

1830
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:54,390
much to this area oh my god what is the point oh my god short rounds been on deep end wait he's been he's been going around in circles this whole time

1831
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:05,950
just waiting for me counseling don't there he goes

1832
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:11,430
Oh wait, I forgot I can jump here!

1833
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,310
No, I can't.

1834
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:14,590
Oh my gosh, no wait, am I stuck again?

1835
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:16,230
No, no, we'll just go back to the rock.

1836
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:18,810
Go back to the rock, go back to the rock.

1837
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:20,490
Wait!

1838
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:21,650
Okay, ah!

1839
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,640
This might be my least favorite puzzle in the game.

1840
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,200
Guys, oh, you see, there he is.

1841
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:37,700
I'm joining you!

1842
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,740
Okay, that one was my fault for real.

1843
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:52,820
Oh gosh.

1844
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:01,220
Can I just jump from here?

1845
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:04,160
Please!

1846
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,100
I have nothing left to lose.

1847
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:22,070
Why did I do that?

1848
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:23,530
Wait, why did I do that?

1849
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:24,770
Why did I do that?

1850
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:28,930
Okay, we lived, but at what cost?

1851
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:29,970
Oh,

1852
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:34,070
I can't...

1853
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,450
Okay.

1854
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:49,050
We're watching your sister before you read a card and you help me through some hard times and get our early birthday song.

1855
01:47:57,130 --> 01:48:02,350
Thank you so much, thank you, thank you.

1856
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,790
I hope I said your name right.

1857
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,900
I've lost thousands.

1858
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:18,740
I've lost, I've lost thousands at this point.

1859
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:22,620
Okay.

1860
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,200
I don't know if I can get taller.

1861
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:30,040
I feel like I have to jump here.

1862
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:40,170
These are speedrunner strats.

1863
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,860
No stinking way.

1864
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:49,980
What are these?

1865
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,260
This is so cute!

1866
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,560
Wait, what is this warning?

1867
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:00,720
What is this warning?

1868
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,340
me about.

1869
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,620
What are all of these, too?

1870
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:05,640
Are these, like, the secret?

1871
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:08,640
No, they would just be treasure chests.

1872
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:11,300
What is this?

1873
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:18,820
Anyway.

1874
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,260
Get me out of this hellhole of a room.

1875
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,600
I don't want to be here anymore.

1876
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,020
What is this down there?

1877
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:26,580
Oh, there's, like, a galt.

1878
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,980
What is all this?

1879
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,940
I don't care anymore.

1880
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:32,720
I thought that was Kermit.

1881
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,000
all your money was part of the speedrun strats.

1882
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:49,960
Oh my god.

1883
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:50,760
Calima.

1884
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,400
Oh my god.

1885
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:56,480
We're gonna get Lego possessed.

1886
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,920
Cat keeps what you have over nap every time you mention short rounds.

1887
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:03,800
I guess it's weird.

1888
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:04,580
Big Rick.

1889
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:05,340
Aw.

1890
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:06,540
Oh.

1891
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,000
Yeah!

1892
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:12,980
Kick their butt.

1893
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,280
Okay, Indy just went for it.

1894
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:17,740
Wait, does he not get possessed?

1895
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:21,220
Don't we have to save her?

1896
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:24,900
There we go.

1897
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,260
He's a genius.

1898
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,440
He's a genius.

1899
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:34,440
Oh.

1900
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,740
Oh, it's one of these types of puzzles.

1901
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,820
Okay, so we pull this out so you can hop on top.

1902
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:45,440
Destroy.

1903
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,800
for riches and gold and everything your heart could ever desire.

1904
01:50:55,450 --> 01:50:56,450
Oh, I gotta get in there.

1905
01:50:58,810 --> 01:51:00,350
What the hell is this thing?

1906
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:03,650
Oh, this is my entrance.

1907
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:07,050
I see.

1908
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:09,610
I see.

1909
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:11,490
Wait.

1910
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:13,650
Oh, I see.

1911
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,330
I see.

1912
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:14,670
I see.

1913
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:17,250
He's gotta push it all the way there.

1914
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:21,690
She's dead already.

1915
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:23,150
No, we saw the other guy.

1916
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,270
She's just getting a tan.

1917
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,590
She's just getting a...

1918
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:28,350
Come on, Indy.

1919
01:51:28,490 --> 01:51:29,370
Poor Aisha.

1920
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:37,160
Oh, oh, oh.

1921
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:37,900
Okay, nice.

1922
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:49,190
We'll try later.

1923
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:51,630
The music is so mysterious.

1924
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:54,970
Oh!

1925
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:59,490
Are those her booty cheeks or...

1926
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:00,030
Whoa!

1927
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:01,570
Wait.

1928
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:24,520
Can I- What?

1929
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,040
Wait, what just happened?

1930
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,840
That thing just moved to me!

1931
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,880
What the heck?

1932
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,880
Is that why it's saying no?

1933
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:55,160
Because we're not the character that we need to be?

1934
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:00,560
Hmm.

1935
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:00,720
Hmm.

1936
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:03,960
I love how short round it's just doing everything.

1937
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,840
Oh, they're just not impressed.

1938
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:10,220
That don't impress me much.

1939
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:12,020
Oh, oh, oh.

1940
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:22,250
I wish I could get another heart.

1941
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:28,290
Oops.

1942
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,030
Okay, Indy, it's your turn.

1943
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:36,730
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

1944
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,400
They were not impressed.

1945
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,090
Wait, but there's so much going on.

1946
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:00,330
Come on in here.

1947
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:00,690
Oh.

1948
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:01,450
Oops.

1949
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,300
Don't worry about it.

1950
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,020
Don't worry about it.

1951
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,620
Don't worry about it.

1952
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:19,060
Oh.

1953
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:20,840
Oh, oh, come on.

1954
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,840
How did we live before?

1955
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,160
We got our money back.

1956
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,060
Nice!

1957
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,320
We lived?

1958
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:29,600
We lived!

1959
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:31,640
Um...

1960
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:32,640
Oh, I forgot to press...

1961
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,140
I forgot to pull the lever, didn't I?

1962
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,820
Did I pull the lever?

1963
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:38,160
I don't think I did.

1964
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:40,060
Oopsie.

1965
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:48,380
There we go.

1966
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,260
We'll like actually save her?

1967
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,920
Instead of being greedy?

1968
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:03,630
Hiya!

1969
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:07,830
What's happening?

1970
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:11,370
Oh my god!

1971
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:12,670
Who are you?

1972
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:13,630
Wait, who are you?

1973
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:15,550
Oh, you're the...

1974
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:16,030
You're a boss.

1975
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,090
Holy moly.

1976
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:20,050
You're set.

1977
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:28,590
Yeah!

1978
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:29,810
Kick his butt!

1979
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:32,870
Kick his butt short round!

1980
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:35,090
Wait, I need that heart.

1981
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,570
I got a new hat.

1982
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:44,210
Oh my god.

1983
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:46,630
What a... Oh!

1984
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:49,150
Oh my gosh, he's so annoying.

1985
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:50,750
Wait, he's so annoying.

1986
01:55:51,530 --> 01:55:52,450
Wait, he's so annoying.

1987
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,670
Wait, Indy, I need you to do stuff.

1988
01:55:57,650 --> 01:55:58,330
Oh my god, wait!

1989
01:55:59,130 --> 01:55:59,930
I need a gun!

1990
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:03,550
Someone give me a gun!

1991
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:10,260
Try the statue now.

1992
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:11,840
Hi!

1993
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:15,290
Wait, what just happened?

1994
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:17,990
Wait, the statue worked.

1995
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,210
He's like, ow!

1996
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:41,730
Aie!

1997
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:46,610
Oh, my God.

1998
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:48,110
Oh, my God.

1999
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:49,970
Oh, are you okay?

2000
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:51,510
My sweet madam.

2001
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:59,300
Guys only want one thing.

2002
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,580
What the?

2003
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:05,080
What the?

2004
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:06,920
Wow.

2005
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,420
Calims

2006
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:20,510
and treasure to take back to the museum.

2007
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:25,050
Tiny bread.

2008
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:26,850
Tiny Lego bread!

2009
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:33,250
Wait, let me see.

2010
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:35,650
How far are we in this one?

2011
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:41,740
What was that?

2012
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,540
Chapter 3?

2013
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:45,080
Yes.

2014
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:46,520
So now we have four.

2015
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:47,180
So there's what?

2016
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:48,220
There's six for each one?

2017
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:58,270
I feel like we're zooming through it this time just because I'm not taking every second to go around.

2018
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:01,330
Last time I went and explored everywhere, you know?

2019
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:06,330
This time, I'm actually playing the game, believe it or not.

2020
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:10,030
Enemy Boxer!

2021
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:13,510
Is there a Common Rider episode today?

2022
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:25,870
No, Common Rider episodes are Saturday, if you're like, US time, and Sunday morning, if Saturday night, and Sunday morning, um...

2023
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:26,210
Oops.

2024
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:26,890
I don't know.

2025
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:28,150
Oh, wait, I have money for him.

2026
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:31,610
For, like, Like, JST.

2027
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:38,720
Is that the guy that gets sliced by the propeller?

2028
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:39,480
It is!

2029
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,120
Oh, look, there's the little mailbox thing.

2030
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:45,960
Oh my gosh, the way she walks.

2031
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,100
Look at the way...

2032
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:50,080
Damn, that girl.

2033
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,400
Her body.

2034
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:55,020
Body, yaddy, yaddy, yaddy.

2035
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:58,580
It's like an optical illusion or something.

2036
01:58:58,820 --> 01:58:59,780
It's kind of insane.

2037
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,020
Damn, girl, that body of yours is insane.

2038
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:03,680
actually.

2039
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,780
Oh, I gotta break something.

2040
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:13,690
Oh yeah, I forgot that you can hide in these.

2041
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:17,350
Same as idle pre-cure.

2042
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:21,370
There you go.

2043
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:23,190
Idle pre-cure.

2044
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:24,210
Same time.

2045
01:59:25,730 --> 01:59:27,370
Did I get...

2046
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:29,830
Sorry, I don't mean Deion.

2047
01:59:30,190 --> 01:59:32,130
Did I get like all the...

2048
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:34,530
Did I have enough money to buy all the other extras?

2049
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:37,580
Are we just buying people now?

2050
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:45,800
We're freeing the little children!

2051
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:48,820
The child slaves!

2052
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,690
Little did we know this...

2053
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,060
This is outer heaven.

2054
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:56,220
Wowza!

2055
01:59:57,380 --> 01:59:58,440
Wowee!

2056
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:01,600
Wowee!

2057
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:09,560
Alright.

2058
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,480
Well, um...

2059
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:12,400
Children!

2060
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,420
Any children in here?

2061
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,380
I mean, I'm here to rescue you.

2062
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,500
Where are you guys?

2063
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:27,540
I'm gonna become a true adventurer by collecting all this money, money, money.

2064
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:31,500
I'm also destroying their stuff so that they can't build anymore.

2065
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:33,740
No more mining and crafting for you.

2066
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,440
This is what Lego thinks of Minecraft.

2067
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:41,720
They're like, two are...

2068
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:43,200
dealer idea?

2069
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:43,860
Hoo-ha!

2070
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,780
Well, we won't let you get away with it!

2071
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,060
Alright, we need a woman's touch.

2072
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:16,190
Too bad they skipped Brainwashed Indy, but he was Brainwashed Hal again yesterday.

2073
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:17,870
Oh,

2074
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:26,340
why is my game freezing all of a sudden?

2075
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:29,060
Guys, why is my game freezing all of a sudden?

2076
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:36,100
That was weird.

2077
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,620
Oh, God, please.

2078
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:49,860
The worst part is the scream is like so terrible.

2079
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:52,980
It's like, it doesn't even sound cute.

2080
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,040
It's just so awful.

2081
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:09,890
It's so funny.

2082
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:10,990
Oh, no, no, no, no!

2083
02:02:11,770 --> 02:02:21,010
No, my- Nice.

2084
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:23,550
Wait, where is...

2085
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:25,230
Where is Shorty?

2086
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:26,970
Why did we lose him?

2087
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:27,170
Oh.

2088
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,070
One second.

2089
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:32,450
Oh my gosh, it did not see that.

2090
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:39,950
Like I know in the movie he's gone, but I don't think I saw a cutscene where he left.

2091
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,550
Was it?

2092
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:44,350
Was it in a cutscene?

2093
02:02:44,570 --> 02:02:45,330
Did I just miss it?

2094
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:46,370
Was I not paying attention?

2095
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:51,130
Was I being in a silly Willy?

2096
02:02:52,110 --> 02:02:53,470
Random Willy screams.

2097
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:59,410
I wish it like, I wish it like blinded, not blinded.

2098
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:01,830
Wait, the screams that make you go blind.

2099
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:03,450
I wish it deafened them.

2100
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:04,590
I think that'd be pretty funny.

2101
02:03:06,990 --> 02:03:08,210
Hey, leave me alone.

2102
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,660
They keep sliding down!

2103
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:20,720
Oh my gosh, it's like a never-ending hole.

2104
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:24,300
Stop!

2105
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:25,460
Oh, sorry, Endy.

2106
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,540
I didn't mean to.

2107
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:29,720
Okay, we finally made it.

2108
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:38,570
Oh.

2109
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:41,270
You gotta say, what did I do?

2110
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:48,390
Very nice.

2111
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:51,030
Oh, my bad.

2112
02:03:52,290 --> 02:03:54,930
I'm always kicking his butt.

2113
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:55,690
Ah!

2114
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,180
We need you, Shorty.

2115
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,340
We need you.

2116
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,900
Wait, that's a child!

2117
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,040
Oh my god, the children can crawl!

2118
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:21,020
Why did he just have to take off his hat for that?

2119
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:26,700
The children can crawl!

2120
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:30,620
They have capabilities!

2121
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:34,800
I...

2122
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,460
I'm not gonna lie, guys.

2123
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:40,260
I've... I haven't stopped thinking about the Minecraft movie.

2124
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:43,960
It's just...

2125
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,240
Why was it the way that it was?

2126
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:47,300
Okay.

2127
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:56,620
Ah, here we go.

2128
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:57,880
Oh, is it gonna be like, hello?

2129
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:03,080
Okay, there we go.

2130
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:12,830
Celebration of my birthday, please take my money!

2131
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:13,350
No!

2132
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:15,810
Chinetics, thank you!

2133
02:05:15,910 --> 02:05:16,670
Happy birthday!

2134
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:18,850
Congrats on the upcoming 3D debut!

2135
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:20,890
We're nearly birthday buddies!

2136
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:23,990
Wait.

2137
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:25,750
I don't put this here?

2138
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:31,550
Okay, we got this.

2139
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:35,770
Easy as...

2140
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:38,930
Oh my gosh, this is just like getting the ration in Metal Gear.

2141
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:41,990
First try!

2142
02:05:44,170 --> 02:05:46,530
It's just the exact same.

2143
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:49,670
Am I gonna be able to make this jump?

2144
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:52,190
Oh, no.

2145
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:52,990
Wait.

2146
02:05:55,610 --> 02:05:56,210
Uh-oh.

2147
02:05:57,810 --> 02:05:58,410
Guys?

2148
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:03,930
Wait, how...

2149
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:12,500
Is it fine, is it?

2150
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:15,620
Oh, she just knocked me down.

2151
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,880
Yeah, you deserve that, Willy.

2152
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:29,990
Into the...

2153
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:31,490
Oh, did it just go into the lava?

2154
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:33,050
Wait, what was it, though?

2155
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:34,730
I don't even know what I got.

2156
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:39,930
What is this?

2157
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:41,210
Oh, it's out of trouble.

2158
02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:43,590
Maybe there's one in here.

2159
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:45,130
Wait, there's gotta be one in here.

2160
02:06:45,230 --> 02:06:46,390
Yes.

2161
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:53,630
Just drop into the lava for it to respawn.

2162
02:06:55,870 --> 02:06:57,710
I will do that.

2163
02:06:58,810 --> 02:06:59,750
But where does it go?

2164
02:07:00,910 --> 02:07:02,150
It's so mysterious.

2165
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:06,450
Unless it goes like here?

2166
02:07:11,010 --> 02:07:11,170
Oh.

2167
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:14,350
Instead, I fall into the lava.

2168
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,440
I must do it!

2169
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,520
No, Frodo!

2170
02:07:29,420 --> 02:07:31,000
I'll throw the ring into the fire!

2171
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:38,320
Um, oh, thank goodness it's back.

2172
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:40,060
Wait, but what do I do with this still?

2173
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:44,920
Wait, that didn't solve my problem?

2174
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:49,580
Wait!

2175
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,780
That didn't solve my problem at all.

2176
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:56,520
I press ass.

2177
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:11,030
I thought it would go right here.

2178
02:08:23,550 --> 02:08:31,990
I have no idea I'll be honest there has we have to be able to do something with this no could

2179
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:52,290
you grab it with the whip oh like okay oh I think I get I get what you guys are saying so if I put it on here and then I whip it whip it good

2180
02:08:56,410 --> 02:09:01,990
ah and then I put it here oh no then I whip it.

2181
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:05,430
Oh my gosh, you guys are geniuses.

2182
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:08,790
And then I whip it.

2183
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:10,490
Aha!

2184
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:12,570
And then I whip it.

2185
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:15,810
Oh my gosh, I'm not the genius.

2186
02:09:15,930 --> 02:09:16,950
You guys came up with that.

2187
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:18,930
I didn't do that at all.

2188
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:20,830
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

2189
02:09:21,650 --> 02:09:23,710
But we gotta shovel, not a wrench.

2190
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:25,990
Oh wait.

2191
02:09:26,610 --> 02:09:27,110
No, no.

2192
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:28,050
Turn this.

2193
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:35,370
When will you nai-nai?

2194
02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:39,450
Um...

2195
02:09:39,450 --> 02:09:42,470
It really, like, depends if I'm on the mood for it.

2196
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:44,990
Uh-oh.

2197
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:46,850
I created my own prison.

2198
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:52,860
First, I whip it.

2199
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:54,520
Ha-ha!

2200
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:58,160
Ha-ha, you are not needed.

2201
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:03,430
Oh, no!

2202
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:08,540
Aw.

2203
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:09,040
Oh.

2204
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,300
Oh my god, a child!

2205
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:16,920
I'm not touching the controller.

2206
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:19,380
The stick drift is real.

2207
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:20,560
Please.

2208
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:25,300
Oh, that's... I did this before.

2209
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:25,720
That's right.

2210
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:28,820
Ah!

2211
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:33,240
Why would you do this to me?

2212
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,340
Oh, are they gonna be non-stop?

2213
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:38,360
Oh my gosh.

2214
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:38,720
Wait.

2215
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:40,280
I'm gonna ignore them.

2216
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:45,640
Please jump.

2217
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:46,780
Jump in the...

2218
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,220
There we go.

2219
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:54,820
No, please.

2220
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:06,740
Oh, I missed one.

2221
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:10,020
Little child!

2222
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,440
Little child!

2223
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,140
Give me the money in there!

2224
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:16,600
Give me the...

2225
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,480
Oh, I thought there was something else in there, to be honest.

2226
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:20,440
Okay, never mind.

2227
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:21,140
We can keep going.

2228
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:31,790
Oh!

2229
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:34,010
They're also gonna keep going.

2230
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:43,540
We need this.

2231
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,560
And we're gonna throw it at that.

2232
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:50,640
Could have thrown it at you, buddy.

2233
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:55,620
Hey, you could have been the one to receive that bomb.

2234
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,380
What's this do?

2235
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:06,220
Oh, what is this?

2236
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,320
Break rock.

2237
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,240
I always do.

2238
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:12,960
Oh, it goes here.

2239
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,580
Like this.

2240
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:17,920
Oh.

2241
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:19,460
Oh.

2242
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:21,080
Wait, what's this dude?

2243
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:24,040
What did I get?

2244
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,300
Oh, nothing?

2245
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:32,160
All right, lady.

2246
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:34,800
Oops.

2247
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:35,980
Oops.

2248
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,020
Oops.

2249
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:40,180
Ha-ya!

2250
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:41,780
Ha-ya!

2251
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,300
Ha-ya!

2252
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:43,380
Ha-ha!

2253
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:53,890
Oh, I did it.

2254
02:12:53,890 --> 02:12:54,390
Somebody raised.

2255
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:54,970
Thank you so much.

2256
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:55,410
I didn't see you.

2257
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:56,150
I'm so sorry.

2258
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:56,730
Thank you.

2259
02:12:56,910 --> 02:12:57,130
Thank you.

2260
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:58,250
Hello.

2261
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:01,650
The Indiana Jones!

2262
02:13:02,790 --> 02:13:04,530
Look at us, look at us kill people!

2263
02:13:07,090 --> 02:13:11,330
But it's like, we're saving, we're saving the slaves!

2264
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:12,730
Child soldiers!

2265
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:22,240
It's all just another day in the Indiana Jones way.

2266
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:24,340
Don't worry about it.

2267
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:27,120
Where does this go?

2268
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:34,760
Well, we have a hat and an explosive.

2269
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:37,560
Ducky, thanks for the gift, Dad.

2270
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:38,560
T-Cup.

2271
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:41,400
T-Cup, did you get?

2272
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:45,080
Did you get Nozomi and Hikari in Blue Archive?

2273
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:47,560
Guys, it's kind of crazy.

2274
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,980
Okay, I've done several hundred, not several hundred.

2275
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,420
I've done maybe 150 pulls now.

2276
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:55,060
I haven't gotten either of them.

2277
02:13:56,060 --> 02:14:02,160
But, but, I did get four?

2278
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:04,900
I did get four new...

2279
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:09,740
three star girls in Blue Archive that I did not have before

2280
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:23,840
which is kind of crazy so I didn't get the new girls but I did get other people that I didn't have yet what is this?

2281
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:27,460
where does this go?

2282
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:31,360
what did I get?

2283
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:37,460
I got Kiyadata, I got uh finally.

2284
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:38,560
Oh my gosh.

2285
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:45,060
I got regular and I got someone else and I can't remember right now.

2286
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,020
I got both under 60 rolls.

2287
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:48,780
I'm gonna kill you.

2288
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,880
That's a real threat.

2289
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:55,380
Why is my Gacha Lux so bad, man?

2290
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:59,740
Hina and her purple dress.

2291
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:00,760
I already have that.

2292
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,180
But you can only get her.

2293
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:05,460
You can only get her.

2294
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,560
She's a unique for characters, so you can't get her all the time.

2295
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:10,840
Stop!

2296
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:21,980
Nice!

2297
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:22,380
Wow!

2298
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:24,200
That was easy.

2299
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:26,160
Oh my god, look how many children there are in here!

2300
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:30,840
Oh, dig, dig, dig.

2301
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:39,320
What is this?

2302
02:15:40,660 --> 02:15:43,220
This go- oh, oh, release the children!

2303
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:45,780
Whoa, one second, children.

2304
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:48,200
Hold on, Mama's gotta be greedy real quick.

2305
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,220
Come on, children.

2306
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:52,800
You can wait.

2307
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:54,500
You've been in there for long enough, okay?

2308
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:57,080
Wait, what is...

2309
02:15:57,620 --> 02:15:58,060
Oh!

2310
02:15:58,840 --> 02:15:59,800
Wait, are these bouncy?

2311
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:02,440
No.

2312
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:03,500
I didn't think so.

2313
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:04,320
I was like, they're wood.

2314
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,980
I heard if you do gotcha while your OBS is open, your luck might boost.

2315
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:17,460
Source Green Women.

2316
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:18,340
Really?

2317
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:26,260
So if I do a pull right now, I could do two 10 pulls right now.

2318
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:29,500
With my OBS open.

2319
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,680
Wait, what's on the other side?

2320
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:34,980
I guess it doesn't matter.

2321
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:42,280
But you gotta show us.

2322
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:44,080
I can't because it's all on my phone.

2323
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:44,880
I'm sorry.

2324
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:47,680
Don't know.

2325
02:16:47,780 --> 02:16:48,640
Don't just scream.

2326
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:54,990
What do I take this to?

2327
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,180
You wouldn't hurt a lady.

2328
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:00,940
Was you?

2329
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:10,250
Did I just get him in the garage?

2330
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:12,390
Is that where she just held that area?

2331
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:13,250
Oh, sorry, Indy.

2332
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,180
Okay, let's do the same thing we did before.

2333
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,220
Willie has other ideas.

2334
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:33,280
No, no, no.

2335
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:43,760
You need to stream your pulls to get streamer gotcha luck.

2336
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,440
It's on my phone.

2337
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:47,000
I don't know what to tell you guys.

2338
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,220
Then you'll never see that I won't do a 10 pull.

2339
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:53,100
I don't know what to tell you guys.

2340
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:56,980
Why did it bounce?

2341
02:17:57,180 --> 02:17:58,040
I don't know.

2342
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,620
Oh, that kid's crying.

2343
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:00,400
No, he's fine.

2344
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:01,000
He's smiling.

2345
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:06,760
Yeah, I got games on your phone.

2346
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:10,540
Indy, I'm going to murder you.

2347
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,980
I'm going to murder you.

2348
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:15,160
Move!

2349
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:19,580
It's on Steam, too.

2350
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:20,460
Yeah, I know.

2351
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:24,420
But I, um...

2352
02:18:47,660 --> 02:19:19,780
way why did it do that why did it do that anyway i was saying i know blue blue archive is also on steam maybe it'll work now but um it like crashed my computer last time i tried so um that was when it like first came out though so who knows it might be better now i don't think i'm doing this correctly okay um Let's see if there's another way to do this,

2353
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:20,260
maybe.

2354
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,620
Surely there's something else to do here.

2355
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,820
Oops, I...

2356
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,080
Maybe I don't do this at all.

2357
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:35,880
Wait, what's that for?

2358
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:36,840
Is it for this kid?

2359
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:41,760
Oh, I don't think so.

2360
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:50,080
I think you can just jump with it.

2361
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:50,880
You think so?

2362
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:52,180
Oh wait, I need jail.

2363
02:19:56,970 --> 02:19:57,310
Oh, where?

2364
02:19:57,430 --> 02:19:59,330
But it doesn't go there anyway.

2365
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:01,310
Something for below.

2366
02:20:02,430 --> 02:20:02,670
Maybe?

2367
02:20:03,570 --> 02:20:04,810
Dusty, thank you so much.

2368
02:20:06,030 --> 02:20:07,290
For the vibe, get the thank you.

2369
02:20:17,650 --> 02:20:19,590
Oh my god, shut the hell up, please.

2370
02:20:25,270 --> 02:20:28,210
Oh my gosh, we were totally overthinking it.

2371
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:29,450
For me.

2372
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:31,790
I was overthinking it.

2373
02:20:32,410 --> 02:20:32,910
That's it!

2374
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:35,410
That's all it did was explode?

2375
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:42,110
We used the machine just for it to explode?

2376
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:45,730
It's faulty, it's faulty.

2377
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:47,090
Alright, we can keep going.

2378
02:20:47,570 --> 02:20:48,350
See you later, kid!

2379
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:50,330
Quit your crying.

2380
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:55,230
I'm gonna name you Ryan.

2381
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:57,190
Crying Ryan.

2382
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:02,840
Shorty!

2383
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:08,000
This is a boss fight?

2384
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:08,420
Yeah.

2385
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:10,500
Oh.

2386
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:13,100
Oh, no.

2387
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,020
He's gonna do the voodoo.

2388
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:22,050
Or...

2389
02:21:22,050 --> 02:21:22,870
Wait, what is this?

2390
02:21:25,650 --> 02:21:27,050
I don't remember this.

2391
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:34,930
Uh...

2392
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:41,020
Oops.

2393
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:48,150
Stop chasing after me, you freak.

2394
02:21:48,810 --> 02:21:49,110
Oh.

2395
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:49,910
My goodness.

2396
02:21:53,770 --> 02:21:55,410
We had to throw it at him, I bet.

2397
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:01,610
I don't throw it at that kid?

2398
02:22:05,290 --> 02:22:07,310
Oh, I blew myself up on accident.

2399
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:08,790
Oopsie.

2400
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:16,170
I did blew myself up again.

2401
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:18,270
I done blow myself up.

2402
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:20,610
Oh my god, please.

2403
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:24,630
Oh, and he keeps getting healed.

2404
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,110
Ah, let's see.

2406
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:53,810
maybe if i don't oh no it doesn't work he even gets healed all the way from over here

2407
02:22:57,270 --> 02:23:13,770
yeah even from all the way over here oh yeah the bars where are the box one was short short round and then There are no bars.

2408
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:14,670
Come on.

2409
02:23:20,210 --> 02:23:21,710
Oh, what's down here?

2410
02:23:25,610 --> 02:23:26,730
Whole lot of nothing.

2411
02:23:29,690 --> 02:23:31,070
They're not even fighting.

2412
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:32,610
Come on, you guys need me.

2413
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:37,050
This is AFK.

2414
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:37,890
Oh my god.

2415
02:23:39,490 --> 02:23:40,170
So funny.

2416
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:46,780
Um...

2417
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:47,940
Where is this dude though?

2418
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:50,100
I don't think it breaks that.

2419
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:53,000
I think it's just used here to jump as a platform.

2420
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:57,280
Oh, we can't get up there.

2421
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:01,610
I don't...

2422
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:05,310
I feel like I need to kill the kid, but I can't...

2423
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:10,780
They put aside their differences.

2424
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:15,540
Oh, wait.

2425
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,020
Look at this thing right here in the front is where they, like, do the...

2426
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:21,400
The fist fighting part.

2427
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:22,860
Oh, wait.

2428
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,060
Can I break him out?

2429
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:26,080
Aha!

2430
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:27,420
Okay, okay.

2431
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:30,220
Oops, I killed him at the same time, but that's...

2432
02:24:30,220 --> 02:24:30,560
You know...

2433
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:33,120
sacrifices must be made.

2434
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:42,680
There we go.

2435
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:43,200
No, no, no.

2436
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:43,540
Keep going.

2437
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:43,960
Keep going.

2438
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:45,200
Oh, I... Oh.

2439
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:48,940
Oh, he can use the tunnel, but I may not.

2440
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:51,060
That's fine, I suppose.

2441
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:57,040
Oh.

2442
02:24:57,400 --> 02:24:58,040
Wait, did it work?

2443
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,200
The royal tunnel.

2444
02:25:13,580 --> 02:25:14,480
Use it.

2445
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:15,220
Use it.

2446
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:17,540
Okay.

2447
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,240
Oh my gosh.

2448
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:18,680
Thank goodness.

2449
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:25,800
This guy.

2450
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:27,860
I'm gonna murder you.

2451
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:33,990
It's a good thing we already, uh...

2452
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:37,910
It's a good thing we already pushed this thing over, huh?

2453
02:25:39,950 --> 02:25:40,370
Hindsight.

2454
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:49,500
Ouch!

2455
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:50,940
Oh my god, how did he get this?

2456
02:25:51,140 --> 02:25:51,840
How did he get that?

2457
02:25:57,050 --> 02:25:58,530
Oh, I have to go through everything!

2458
02:26:04,970 --> 02:26:07,690
I don't know why I waited, but it's whatever.

2459
02:26:11,370 --> 02:26:11,790
Oh!

2460
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,610
Yeah.

2461
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:21,190
his lights out!

2462
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:21,390
Oh.

2463
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:24,990
We're friends now.

2464
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:27,030
Oh.

2465
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:27,650
Oh,

2466
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:33,560
wait.

2467
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,260
It's time.

2468
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:36,080
Wait.

2469
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:38,140
Who's doing this?

2470
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:39,420
Wait, what are we doing?

2471
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:43,200
Wait, what's happening?

2472
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:46,000
Are they not gonna fight?

2473
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:47,280
Oh, my God!

2474
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:48,820
Holy moly!

2475
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:53,180
I thought they were gonna fight in there.

2476
02:26:54,660 --> 02:26:56,140
Can we blow up now?

2477
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:20,230
The Lego boulders.

2478
02:27:22,270 --> 02:27:23,490
Oh, come on!

2479
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:25,150
I should have cheesed.

2480
02:27:29,250 --> 02:27:30,890
What do they want me to do here now?

2481
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:32,730
Need some more hearts.

2482
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:38,060
Yay!

2483
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:39,740
I'm a little stupid, I think.

2484
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:40,120
Oh, wait.

2485
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:41,260
There's stuff down here.

2486
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,160
Maybe we get him from down here.

2487
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:45,920
Let's see.

2488
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:08,760
I'm just stupid.

2489
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,480
Yeah, this is where he gets crushed.

2490
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:23,540
Yeah, but now I'm just like they don't want me to do that, so I'm kind of wondering what they want me to do, you know?

2491
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:30,500
I don't quite know what they want me to do instead.

2492
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:32,920
You got this, Vito?

2493
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:34,120
Thanks!

2494
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,900
Yeah, I'm not quite sure what they're like.

2495
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:47,840
They're like, you can't!

2496
02:28:49,940 --> 02:29:17,840
You can't fight him you can't fist fight him on there so what am i supposed to like parry the the boulder back at him i tried oh oops oh my gosh it does what me okay i just need it to oh oh are you kidding me that's so unfortunate okay hold on i think when he has the boulder

2497
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:28,470
Okay, when he carries the boulder.

2498
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:31,430
What?

2499
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:32,550
Why is his aim?

2500
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:34,610
Okay, why is your aim so bad?

2501
02:29:35,050 --> 02:29:35,670
Huh, kids?

2502
02:29:36,930 --> 02:29:38,990
Come on, this is a life or death situation.

2503
02:29:48,630 --> 02:29:51,170
Okay, that, okay, maybe I do actually parry the boulder.

2504
02:29:52,510 --> 02:29:53,850
Maybe I do parry the boulder.

2505
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:04,270
Okay, no.

2506
02:30:04,810 --> 02:30:07,210
Because the target goes away as soon as that...

2507
02:30:10,210 --> 02:30:11,990
As he throws it, the target goes away.

2508
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:27,300
Do I really have to go all the way below?

2509
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:28,940
Because there's only two places.

2510
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:30,860
Oh my gosh, this is so annoying then.

2511
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:34,440
I was hoping that wasn't the case.

2512
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:37,000
Am

2513
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:59,690
I just overthinking it or is it just actually obtuse?

2514
02:31:01,870 --> 02:31:03,110
Oh my god, I have to time...

2515
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:06,150
There's no way that you have to time it perfectly to win...

2516
02:31:06,150 --> 02:31:07,830
to grabbing the...

2517
02:31:08,890 --> 02:31:10,510
when he has the boulder.

2518
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:15,030
Parry it with a whip?

2519
02:31:15,450 --> 02:31:18,030
I mean, I could try, but I don't think so.

2520
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:24,450
There's some obtuse stuff in this game.

2521
02:31:24,650 --> 02:31:24,990
Is there?

2522
02:31:28,990 --> 02:31:30,590
Wow, I was able to...

2523
02:31:30,590 --> 02:31:32,790
Well, I think it actually just bounced off my head.

2524
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:41,130
I think it just... I don't think I parried it.

2525
02:31:41,150 --> 02:31:42,510
I think it bounced off my head.

2526
02:31:54,030 --> 02:31:54,430
We got it!

2527
02:31:54,430 --> 02:31:55,550
We got the timing!

2528
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:56,850
We got the timing!

2529
02:31:58,890 --> 02:31:59,150
Okay.

2530
02:31:59,850 --> 02:32:00,850
Oh wow, okay.

2531
02:32:01,510 --> 02:32:02,170
That's kind of...

2532
02:32:02,170 --> 02:32:02,410
Okay.

2533
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:03,090
Ouch!

2534
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:03,710
Ouch!

2535
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:04,170
Ouch!

2536
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:10,020
Oh gosh.

2537
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:11,960
Please!

2538
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:12,620
No!

2539
02:32:16,130 --> 02:32:18,050
Oh, the timing is terrible.

2540
02:32:19,390 --> 02:32:21,610
Wait, oh my gosh, I have to hope that it loads in time.

2541
02:32:22,130 --> 02:32:23,530
Okay, please, please load!

2542
02:32:23,970 --> 02:32:23,970
Please!

2543
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:25,050
Please load!

2544
02:32:27,410 --> 02:32:28,630
I missed it.

2545
02:32:30,510 --> 02:32:31,610
I missed opportunity!

2546
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:44,340
Oh my god.

2547
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:04,480
Okay, nice.

2548
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:06,440
Nice, nice, nice.

2549
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:08,200
Come on, load.

2550
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:09,920
Thank you.

2551
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:13,320
Okay, nice, nice.

2552
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:14,420
Just one more.

2553
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:17,520
He

2554
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,840
already saw!

2555
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:30,120
He already saw!

2556
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:37,200
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2557
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:38,980
Grab his nipple.

2558
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:41,950
to punish him.

2559
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:43,860
Yay!

2560
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:47,760
Oh, it took so long.

2561
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:50,080
Oops.

2562
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:51,700
We didn't hear the sound.

2563
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:52,260
Sorry.

2564
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:58,720
It's, what is it called?

2565
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:00,900
The Purple Nerf Pull.

2566
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:03,620
Right?

2567
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,340
Did he grab it?

2568
02:34:11,070 --> 02:34:11,810
Yeah.

2569
02:34:12,230 --> 02:34:13,130
He took his hat.

2570
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:15,490
And you take his nipple.

2571
02:34:20,190 --> 02:34:21,390
Equivalent exchange!

2572
02:34:23,130 --> 02:34:23,650
Oh my goodness.

2573
02:34:25,650 --> 02:34:26,590
Oh my god, oh my god!

2574
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:27,610
It's just death!

2575
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:29,050
It's just carnage!

2576
02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:35,690
Alright, let's get out of here, folks.

2577
02:34:37,230 --> 02:34:38,690
Escape the mines.

2578
02:34:38,830 --> 02:34:39,490
What's this?

2579
02:34:39,990 --> 02:34:41,030
Why is it so shiny?

2580
02:34:42,590 --> 02:34:43,850
Why are you?

2581
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:47,450
Oh!

2582
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:49,770
Oh, wait, can I blow it up?

2583
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:58,690
Oh, this is one of my favorite levels.

2584
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:01,010
I'm excited.

2585
02:35:01,130 --> 02:35:03,110
Do we actually get to play in the minecart?

2586
02:35:03,390 --> 02:35:04,110
I really want to.

2587
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:05,310
I really want to.

2588
02:35:08,270 --> 02:35:15,590
I've always thought that the minecart part would be such a great, like, attraction at a theme park, you know?

2589
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:28,090
And if we are getting a new Indiana Jones ride, this is their chance to make it different from the previous two.

2590
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:31,450
Sorry, I need to stop talking about the rides.

2591
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:34,530
It's my special interest and I won't shut up.

2592
02:35:36,410 --> 02:35:37,210
Where does this go?

2593
02:35:37,370 --> 02:35:38,010
Oh, here.

2594
02:35:41,590 --> 02:35:42,150
Oh,

2595
02:35:45,350 --> 02:35:45,750
okay.

2596
02:35:47,530 --> 02:35:48,550
Gotta fix the cart.

2597
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:55,960
Disney's lazy, though.

2598
02:35:56,100 --> 02:35:58,460
There's no way that they'll make an entirely new ride.

2599
02:36:00,220 --> 02:36:02,260
As much as I'd wish for it to happen.

2600
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:07,080
There's absolutely no way.

2601
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:20,060
Don't do it.

2602
02:36:20,220 --> 02:36:20,920
Don't jump off.

2603
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:21,880
Don't jump off.

2604
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:23,040
Don't jump off.

2605
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:23,680
Yeah, there you go.

2606
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:24,280
Don't do it.

2607
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:24,740
Don't do it.

2608
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:25,700
So it's just true.

2609
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:27,000
She was like, I might do it.

2610
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:31,340
Oh wait, I need Indy up here.

2611
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:32,640
Oh my god.

2612
02:36:40,110 --> 02:36:42,350
She said I might do it.

2613
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:50,880
Okay.

2614
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:04,530
Whoa.

2615
02:37:07,490 --> 02:37:08,110
Interesting.

2616
02:37:10,370 --> 02:37:10,750
Okay.

2617
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:16,100
Interesting.

2618
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:17,320
Interesting.

2619
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:20,840
Oh, I didn't mean to grab that actually.

2620
02:37:25,090 --> 02:37:26,630
I meant to try and get up here.

2621
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:27,230
There we go.

2622
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:29,630
What is this now?

2623
02:37:31,570 --> 02:37:34,470
How do we turn it from red to green?

2624
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:38,970
The sound effects in this game are so good.

2625
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:39,850
They're so fun.

2626
02:37:40,850 --> 02:37:41,410
They really are.

2627
02:37:51,890 --> 02:37:53,210
What am I missing?

2628
02:37:55,150 --> 02:37:55,630
Oh!

2629
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:00,130
Oh!

2630
02:38:00,450 --> 02:38:00,930
Oh!

2631
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:04,930
I can't!

2632
02:38:05,010 --> 02:38:06,130
Wait, who?

2633
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:08,890
Oh, I just killed him.

2634
02:38:09,390 --> 02:38:10,710
I just killed him.

2635
02:38:12,890 --> 02:38:13,990
The minecart has a handle.

2636
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:14,610
Oh, it does?

2637
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:15,590
I missed it.

2638
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:16,350
Thank you.

2639
02:38:19,690 --> 02:38:20,630
Ah, you're right.

2640
02:38:23,050 --> 02:38:24,870
Let the kid do all the work.

2641
02:38:26,410 --> 02:38:27,190
Wait, is it gonna move?

2642
02:38:27,410 --> 02:38:27,830
No.

2643
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:30,930
But they'll tip us for it.

2644
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:33,130
our... for our attempt.

2645
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:39,080
Trying to... I've been trying to...

2646
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:42,220
I noticed that the railing was not complete.

2647
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:51,460
I was trying to figure out what would be the way to fix the track.

2648
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:54,420
But I cannot figure out.

2649
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:59,760
Is there anything else to explode?

2650
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:01,880
I do not see.

2651
02:39:03,060 --> 02:39:03,260
I don't...

2652
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:03,280
I

2653
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:10,040
love the shiny spot.

2654
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:10,860
Is there another one?

2655
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:13,840
There's another shiny?

2656
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:17,540
No.

2657
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,600
Some boxes right next to the rail.

2658
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:26,560
Did I just not...

2659
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:30,380
Oh my gosh.

2660
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:33,120
I didn't do my Minecraft duty.

2661
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:35,680
I mean, my Lego duty.

2662
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:39,540
It's basically Minecraft.

2663
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:40,400
This one.

2664
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:42,680
Okay!

2665
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:45,300
Push it along.

2666
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:47,920
Give us tiny little legs.

2667
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:52,600
Block game duties.

2668
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:05,250
Alright, team.

2669
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:06,530
Everybody up?

2670
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:07,270
Oh, gosh.

2671
02:40:07,850 --> 02:40:08,730
Will you go first?

2672
02:40:09,550 --> 02:40:10,110
No, no, no.

2673
02:40:10,290 --> 02:40:11,210
Don't over there.

2674
02:40:11,330 --> 02:40:11,790
Over here.

2675
02:40:13,650 --> 02:40:14,310
Okay, team.

2676
02:40:14,650 --> 02:40:16,050
We need to all be up here.

2677
02:40:24,110 --> 02:40:25,370
Now we go to the other side.

2678
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:32,400
Okay, team.

2679
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:36,880
It'll blink green.

2680
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:38,600
It'll say, this is a mine cart.

2681
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:39,900
Oh, it does.

2682
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:41,040
It said, it said.

2683
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:47,600
Where did the second one come from?

2684
02:40:52,580 --> 02:40:54,480
You need to do this to, okay, okay.

2685
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:55,560
Who am I?

2686
02:40:55,640 --> 02:40:56,320
Okay, I'm Indy.

2687
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:01,000
Was I supposed to hit that?

2688
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:02,500
Oh, was I supposed to hit that?

2689
02:41:02,980 --> 02:41:04,280
Is I supposed to hit that?

2690
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:09,210
Oh!

2691
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:11,750
Line up to...

2692
02:41:11,750 --> 02:41:15,270
I got that!

2693
02:41:15,850 --> 02:41:16,650
Okay, wait.

2694
02:41:17,070 --> 02:41:17,770
We're gonna do this.

2695
02:41:18,290 --> 02:41:18,790
We'll do this.

2696
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:19,750
Surely?

2697
02:41:20,710 --> 02:41:21,030
Wait.

2698
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:25,990
Wait, I'm pressing the button though.

2699
02:41:26,770 --> 02:41:28,270
Oh, maybe I need to hit it with the... Okay.

2700
02:41:29,490 --> 02:41:30,650
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

2701
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:32,190
I was doing the wrong button.

2702
02:41:32,690 --> 02:41:33,230
That's my bad.

2703
02:41:34,730 --> 02:41:36,850
Ah, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.

2704
02:41:37,310 --> 02:41:38,210
Oh, I have to...

2705
02:41:38,210 --> 02:41:39,010
Bing, oh, Bing.

2706
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:39,870
Bing, bong.

2707
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:41,090
Bing.

2708
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:45,500
Bing.

2709
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:46,800
Who's next?

2710
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:48,060
Oh.

2711
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:49,040
Bing.

2712
02:41:49,360 --> 02:41:51,300
Okay, and one more on this side.

2713
02:41:52,220 --> 02:41:52,920
Easy peasy.

2714
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:55,340
Bing.

2715
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:57,200
Bing.

2716
02:41:58,700 --> 02:41:59,340
Bing.

2717
02:42:06,500 --> 02:42:07,460
Bing bong.

2718
02:42:09,160 --> 02:42:09,620
Oh.

2719
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:12,700
This is so fun.

2720
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:13,780
Bing!

2721
02:42:26,830 --> 02:42:27,650
I hit something.

2722
02:42:30,190 --> 02:42:31,670
Oh, oh, that one's lucky.

2723
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:37,820
Oh, oops, I didn't realize that was the wrong one.

2724
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:41,540
I'm just flailing around.

2725
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:44,760
I'm just flailing around.

2726
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:03,350
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

2727
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:05,370
Okay, one more.

2728
02:43:15,470 --> 02:43:16,650
It's so funny.

2729
02:43:16,930 --> 02:43:17,750
Oh, oopsie.

2730
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:18,230
My bad.

2731
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:20,830
Oh!

2732
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:21,530
Ah!

2733
02:43:21,710 --> 02:43:22,850
I missed it again!

2734
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:24,510
It's at the very end.

2735
02:43:24,650 --> 02:43:25,230
Oh my gosh.

2736
02:43:26,450 --> 02:43:27,030
Bink, bink!

2737
02:43:27,210 --> 02:43:27,590
Oh, oops.

2738
02:43:27,710 --> 02:43:27,970
My bad.

2739
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:32,500
Okay.

2740
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,000
It's on the right.

2741
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:34,340
Yeah.

2742
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:35,520
Okay.

2743
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:39,180
Holy cow.

2744
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:39,840
Okay.

2745
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:40,740
Oh.

2746
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:41,620
Dang it.

2747
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:42,060
I'm a sec.

2748
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:46,340
Oh.

2749
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:48,820
I did it!

2750
02:43:55,890 --> 02:43:56,730
The water!

2751
02:43:57,910 --> 02:43:59,250
They're gonna flood us out!

2752
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:01,610
Uh-oh, we can't make any more mistakes.

2753
02:44:01,950 --> 02:44:02,490
Oh, just kidding.

2754
02:44:02,970 --> 02:44:04,050
We can't make mistakes.

2755
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:09,850
Oh!

2756
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:23,420
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Alright, just two more, right?

2757
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:27,960
Why is it invisible?

2758
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:42,800
I feel like I was pretty thorough about our coins, but I guess not.

2759
02:44:49,890 --> 02:44:52,530
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

2760
02:44:57,820 --> 02:44:59,500
Wait, oh, I think we need to run.

2761
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:02,180
Wait, this is actually coming towards us.

2762
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:02,780
Oh!

2763
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:10,640
Oh my gosh, wait, I'm stuck.

2764
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:13,980
Ah!

2765
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:26,430
Nice!

2766
02:45:29,170 --> 02:45:30,470
First try.

2767
02:45:33,050 --> 02:45:33,930
Oh my gosh.

2768
02:45:35,050 --> 02:45:38,790
I didn't think it was actually coming towards us.

2769
02:45:39,770 --> 02:45:41,470
I don't know what I thought.

2770
02:45:42,050 --> 02:45:43,850
I don't

2771
02:45:51,170 --> 02:45:51,890
know what I thought.

2772
02:45:54,390 --> 02:45:55,110
I

2773
02:45:59,070 --> 02:46:00,510
guess just that...

2774
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:02,510
I don't know.

2775
02:46:09,700 --> 02:46:10,720
So funny.

2776
02:46:11,100 --> 02:46:12,700
Oh, okay, we have to stay on the side.

2777
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:16,680
Alrighty.

2778
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:17,780
Alrighty.

2779
02:46:18,380 --> 02:46:20,280
We'll swing a little bit and...

2780
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:20,520
Whee!

2781
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:21,820
Yuppa!

2782
02:46:25,180 --> 02:46:26,660
Can I jump here?

2783
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:37,330
I see a secret.

2784
02:46:37,750 --> 02:46:39,230
I see a secret big guy.

2785
02:46:41,310 --> 02:46:43,070
That's worth a lot.

2786
02:46:47,910 --> 02:46:48,550
Let me up.

2787
02:46:48,810 --> 02:46:49,410
Thank you.

2788
02:46:58,700 --> 02:46:59,620
That was close.

2789
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:15,240
Up and away!

2790
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,000
Okay.

2791
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:20,180
I'm not quite sure.

2792
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:21,940
Here, though.

2793
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:24,460
What do you guys got going on over here?

2794
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:25,220
Let's check you guys.

2795
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:27,460
Maybe you guys have something on your side that'll help me.

2796
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:33,360
Oh, they probably have something that'll pull out that, um...

2797
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:36,300
Oh, see, see?

2798
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:38,540
Aha!

2799
02:47:38,960 --> 02:47:39,480
Like this.

2800
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:40,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2801
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:41,720
Wait.

2802
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:42,840
What is this?

2803
02:47:48,180 --> 02:47:49,080
Oh, it's for here.

2804
02:47:51,440 --> 02:47:51,860
Sarzangel.

2805
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:57,540
What is it?

2806
02:47:58,080 --> 02:47:58,500
Two...

2807
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:02,840
To the one family, you guys are sabotaging me for real.

2808
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:08,520
Two hearts, one, watch out.

2809
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:12,540
One family.

2810
02:48:16,390 --> 02:48:18,230
I don't think, I don't know if I've ever seen Tarzan.

2811
02:48:28,870 --> 02:48:29,690
Not sure.

2812
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:41,120
Yeah, I think I just remember it from Kingdom Hearts, but I don't know if I've actually watched the movie.

2813
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:44,340
But I think Jane is really pretty.

2814
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:45,440
That's her name, right?

2815
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:48,300
She's, like, so pretty.

2816
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,160
You're sitting bits and pieces!

2817
02:48:56,460 --> 02:48:57,420
I'm in pieces!

2818
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:00,480
My chest was just hanging out.

2819
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:03,040
Are these also traps?

2820
02:49:05,460 --> 02:49:06,340
Maybe not?

2821
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:06,840
Okay.

2822
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:08,840
Oh, my gosh.

2823
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:11,180
Trying to avoid them.

2824
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:22,720
Oh, I need to beat them up.

2825
02:49:30,370 --> 02:49:31,310
Stealth 100.

2826
02:49:31,550 --> 02:49:32,490
They had no clue.

2827
02:49:33,430 --> 02:49:34,270
Oh, we can't go up.

2828
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:36,110
There's no purpose up there.

2829
02:49:38,750 --> 02:49:39,330
A shovel!

2830
02:49:39,750 --> 02:49:40,090
Perfect.

2831
02:49:40,770 --> 02:49:42,310
Oh, this is quite the puzzle.

2832
02:49:42,630 --> 02:49:44,330
What is all of this?

2833
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:47,710
Wait, don't I have one more level after this too?

2834
02:49:48,770 --> 02:49:50,750
I thought this would be the last level.

2835
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:51,910
It makes more sense, no?

2836
02:49:53,010 --> 02:49:53,530
Oh.

2837
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:03,220
I don't quite understand what else they could do.

2838
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:04,820
Oops.

2839
02:50:05,800 --> 02:50:06,280
Bye, bud.

2840
02:50:16,470 --> 02:50:17,530
Oh, this is the last one.

2841
02:50:17,970 --> 02:50:19,070
I feel like it would be.

2842
02:50:19,690 --> 02:50:21,510
I feel like there's no reason to go beyond.

2843
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:24,470
Okay, never mind.

2844
02:50:24,590 --> 02:50:25,670
This is also a bus.

2845
02:50:26,590 --> 02:50:27,450
Oh, my God.

2846
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:32,560
Enough.

2847
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,160
We're teaching him how to kill young.

2848
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,360
Why are there so many of these guys?

2849
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,500
I can't do anything with them.

2850
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:45,460
They hate me.

2851
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:53,920
Unless it's like before where if I put on the hat, they only care about me once I put on the hat.

2852
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:05,500
Hey, this is a priceless artifact!

2853
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:12,280
I think I do, because it drops.

2854
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:14,840
Oh, maybe not.

2855
02:51:15,320 --> 02:51:16,980
What do I do with this?

2856
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:19,100
Um, anybody thirsty?

2857
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:21,840
I got a cuppa.

2858
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:23,780
I got a cuppa.

2859
02:51:27,610 --> 02:51:29,830
Okay, I'm just gonna leave out there for now.

2860
02:51:31,090 --> 02:51:32,830
No one cared about who I was until I put...

2861
02:51:32,830 --> 02:51:34,370
Exactly, until I put on the hide.

2862
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:42,580
Sorry.

2863
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:50,680
Someone got in my throat.

2864
02:51:51,060 --> 02:51:51,280
What?

2865
02:51:58,510 --> 02:51:59,310
Does it want the bush?

2866
02:52:00,850 --> 02:52:01,230
No.

2867
02:52:03,550 --> 02:52:04,830
Wait, I need my shovel?

2868
02:52:10,030 --> 02:52:10,850
Oh, watch out.

2869
02:52:10,990 --> 02:52:11,570
Watch out, fam.

2870
02:52:12,110 --> 02:52:12,750
Watch out, everybody.

2871
02:52:14,870 --> 02:52:18,230
Oh, God, not around here.

2872
02:52:26,010 --> 02:52:27,050
I think...

2873
02:52:27,050 --> 02:52:28,870
I feel like the...

2874
02:52:31,110 --> 02:52:32,150
The cup...

2875
02:52:32,150 --> 02:52:33,950
Court is the same colors.

2876
02:52:36,330 --> 02:52:36,850
But...

2877
02:52:36,870 --> 02:52:37,670
Oh, hello.

2878
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:41,270
But I just don't know where it goes.

2879
02:52:54,820 --> 02:52:55,220
Oh, wait.

2880
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:57,680
Maybe it's heavy enough that it goes on top of that.

2881
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:00,880
Oh, my God.

2882
02:53:01,060 --> 02:53:01,900
They're incessant.

2883
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:04,200
Oh, my God.

2884
02:53:04,260 --> 02:53:05,600
You guys just don't quit.

2885
02:53:07,460 --> 02:53:08,700
Leave me alone.

2886
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:14,730
Pick up the hat.

2887
02:53:14,850 --> 02:53:15,390
I will.

2888
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:16,350
Oh, my gosh.

2889
02:53:16,550 --> 02:53:16,930
Wait.

2890
02:53:17,270 --> 02:53:18,470
You're so impatient.

2891
02:53:23,570 --> 02:53:26,130
I was doing one puzzle first.

2892
02:53:28,050 --> 02:53:29,630
Let me play the game.

2893
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:34,520
Turn to a little power pot.

2894
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:38,080
Oh, there it is.

2895
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:39,140
Okay.

2896
02:53:44,980 --> 02:53:46,460
You like my hat?

2897
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:50,000
Yes!

2898
02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:52,880
Okay, we got one.

2899
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:55,420
Oh, but what's his...

2900
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:56,740
Oh, everybody needs to wear the hat.

2901
02:53:56,760 --> 02:53:59,180
You put on the hat next.

2902
02:54:00,140 --> 02:54:00,660
Oops, my bad.

2903
02:54:01,440 --> 02:54:01,900
Put on the hat.

2904
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:03,200
Nope, never mind.

2905
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:06,240
Wait, can I have him take off the hat?

2906
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:09,160
I don't think so.

2907
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:11,320
I think we have to wait for them to come back.

2908
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:13,100
And then she puts on the hat.

2909
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:15,200
Everybody gets their turn.

2910
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:21,240
It becomes a Mousseau game.

2911
02:54:21,740 --> 02:54:23,100
It feels like it, right?

2912
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:24,940
Oh, sorry.

2913
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:26,200
Someone's hat.

2914
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:28,660
Oh, there we go, nice.

2915
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:30,220
Okay, put on the hat.

2916
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:32,080
All right, and go!

2917
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:37,140
Perfect.

2918
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:38,640
And now?

2919
02:54:40,040 --> 02:54:40,660
Shorty.

2920
02:54:44,350 --> 02:54:46,590
I didn't realize that something dropped before.

2921
02:54:47,550 --> 02:54:47,970
Oh!

2922
02:54:49,350 --> 02:54:50,770
They're all patiently waiting?

2923
02:54:51,330 --> 02:54:51,530
Wait.

2924
02:54:52,590 --> 02:54:53,790
Why are they so...

2925
02:54:53,790 --> 02:54:54,870
Why are they all waiting?

2926
02:54:57,910 --> 02:54:59,570
Wait, why are they all waiting?

2927
02:55:02,270 --> 02:55:03,430
They might be bugged.

2928
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:18,600
They're curious too, yeah, obviously.

2929
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:27,580
That was so strange!

2930
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:30,160
Oh, hat.

2931
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:33,620
Okay, nice.

2932
02:55:34,680 --> 02:55:35,400
Now crawl.

2933
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:36,580
Crawl.

2934
02:55:38,260 --> 02:55:39,900
It's because I'm wearing their hat!

2935
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:41,320
Okay.

2936
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:43,700
They feel like we're brothers now.

2937
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:46,160
So cute.

2938
02:55:49,060 --> 02:55:51,920
I don't know how I missed the first thing that came out here.

2939
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:54,460
Oh, nah, they're still fighting down there.

2940
02:55:55,740 --> 02:55:56,120
Hey!

2941
02:55:57,240 --> 02:55:57,720
Fine.

2942
02:56:11,910 --> 02:56:14,930
Okay, be very, very careful here.

2943
02:56:15,930 --> 02:56:16,210
Indy?

2944
02:56:19,530 --> 02:56:20,050
Oh.

2945
02:56:20,790 --> 02:56:22,170
Stop losing our money, please.

2946
02:56:22,310 --> 02:56:22,630
Oh, no.

2947
02:56:22,810 --> 02:56:23,470
That was not me.

2948
02:56:25,790 --> 02:56:26,590
That was not me.

2949
02:56:26,810 --> 02:56:27,490
That was not me.

2950
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:33,750
And then I still got, I still, they get, I took the blame.

2951
02:56:35,770 --> 02:56:36,990
She can jump.

2952
02:56:39,730 --> 02:56:40,170
Yes.

2953
02:56:40,750 --> 02:56:44,610
It's better to just stick with her and then let the boys handle themselves.

2954
02:56:49,110 --> 02:56:50,130
Okay, we're fine.

2955
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:56,810
Let the go with the person that's the best at jumping and then...

2956
02:57:00,550 --> 02:57:01,250
It's me.

2957
02:57:01,570 --> 02:57:02,810
I'm the one best at jumping.

2958
02:57:09,690 --> 02:57:11,370
What are we doing here?

2959
02:57:12,350 --> 02:57:12,890
Oh.

2960
02:57:13,950 --> 02:57:14,770
Just that.

2961
02:57:16,170 --> 02:57:17,770
Oh, we gotta get to the other side.

2962
02:57:18,710 --> 02:57:19,350
No way.

2963
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:19,710
Okay.

2964
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:28,710
No, no.

2965
02:57:28,990 --> 02:57:29,950
Okay, we're fine.

2966
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:32,310
Yes!

2967
02:57:32,950 --> 02:57:33,590
Yes!

2968
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:41,920
We're too good at...

2969
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:43,080
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

2970
02:57:43,240 --> 02:57:44,560
We're too good at the... Indy.

2971
02:57:48,380 --> 02:57:50,280
Too good at the game!

2972
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:53,280
We're too good at the game!

2973
02:57:59,570 --> 02:58:00,970
Oh, it's so cute!

2974
02:58:03,210 --> 02:58:04,450
Indy, get out of the way.

2975
02:58:05,490 --> 02:58:06,570
Oh, sorry.

2976
02:58:08,590 --> 02:58:10,210
What are these?

2977
02:58:12,030 --> 02:58:13,150
Making flowers.

2978
02:58:13,390 --> 02:58:14,110
Yeah, they're so cute.

2979
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:19,540
Oh!

2980
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:21,060
Big money.

2981
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:28,400
Oh.

2982
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:30,340
This is all you!

2983
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:35,100
That's like a little smiley face.

2984
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:39,300
Oh, okay.

2985
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:40,220
That works.

2986
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:43,220
That works.

2987
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:43,860
And...

2988
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:46,380
Some puzzles can only be completed after...

2989
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:46,960
Okay, yeah.

2990
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:50,300
Oh, okay.

2991
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:51,900
You there.

2992
02:58:55,880 --> 02:58:56,180
Oh!

2993
02:58:58,960 --> 02:59:00,200
Alright, all you, Indy?

2994
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:03,320
He's just gonna let them hang.

2995
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:03,800
He's hanging.

2996
02:59:04,040 --> 02:59:04,740
Leaving them hanging!

2997
02:59:07,240 --> 02:59:10,900
I grew up watching Indiana Jones movies that are special to me.

2998
02:59:10,960 --> 02:59:12,120
Thank you for playing this classic game.

2999
02:59:12,220 --> 02:59:13,160
It's so fun to see it again.

3000
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:16,100
I'm sorry, my voice is a little.

3001
02:59:16,220 --> 02:59:16,520
Come on.

3002
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:19,460
I'm gonna drink some water.

3003
02:59:33,970 --> 02:59:35,870
Your playthrough of Snake Eater is so cool.

3004
02:59:36,790 --> 02:59:37,630
Thank you.

3005
02:59:38,290 --> 02:59:39,650
Thanks for dropping by, too.

3006
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:40,730
I appreciate it.

3007
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:46,260
Go, go, go.

3008
02:59:55,300 --> 02:59:56,480
Oh, my God.

3009
02:59:57,020 --> 02:59:57,900
I'm not gonna make it.

3010
02:59:57,960 --> 02:59:58,820
I'm not gonna make it.

3011
02:59:58,980 --> 02:59:59,160
I'm not.

3012
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:00,660
Oh, I'm killing everybody.

3013
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:03,680
but the people we need to kill.

3014
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:08,260
Oh my god!

3015
03:00:09,140 --> 03:00:09,420
Wait.

3016
03:00:09,800 --> 03:00:10,720
Oh my god, there he is.

3017
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:12,640
Wait.

3018
03:00:13,160 --> 03:00:14,020
What did I just do?

3019
03:00:34,130 --> 03:00:34,710
Yes.

3020
03:00:36,170 --> 03:00:36,750
Yes.

3021
03:00:38,630 --> 03:00:39,210
Yes.

3022
03:00:41,810 --> 03:00:43,390
Oh, they do respawn.

3023
03:00:43,930 --> 03:00:45,910
Wait, how the hell am I supposed to kill him?

3024
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:52,020
He robbed me blind.

3025
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:55,600
Come on, I'm trying to...

3026
03:00:56,320 --> 03:00:58,200
Oh, can I go up here?

3027
03:00:58,400 --> 03:00:58,680
No.

3028
03:00:59,720 --> 03:01:02,100
I feel like it has something... Oh my gosh, I'm trapped in there.

3029
03:01:02,760 --> 03:01:04,980
Something to do with those, but I don't know.

3030
03:01:05,820 --> 03:01:07,780
Like, we have to...

3031
03:01:07,780 --> 03:01:08,600
Oh my god.

3032
03:01:09,340 --> 03:01:11,000
The music is so loud, I can't even think.

3033
03:01:11,320 --> 03:01:14,060
We have to make the bridge burn.

3034
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:20,240
Remember, we have to make the bridge fall.

3035
03:01:20,400 --> 03:01:20,500
Oh!

3036
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:22,660
Did I get that?

3037
03:01:23,740 --> 03:01:24,600
Come on.

3038
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:28,290
Come on, Indy.

3039
03:01:32,650 --> 03:01:33,530
Does he drop it?

3040
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:34,730
Oh, hey, he did.

3041
03:01:34,830 --> 03:01:35,070
He did.

3042
03:01:35,170 --> 03:01:35,170
He did.

3043
03:01:35,470 --> 03:01:35,650
Okay.

3044
03:01:40,750 --> 03:01:41,630
And then...

3045
03:01:41,630 --> 03:01:43,290
Why am I moonwalking?

3046
03:01:43,530 --> 03:01:43,850
Ah!

3047
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:49,020
I'm trying to grab the weapon.

3048
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:54,740
Please.

3049
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:56,120
Please.

3050
03:01:57,020 --> 03:01:57,760
Okay, I got it.

3051
03:01:57,780 --> 03:01:58,200
I got it.

3052
03:01:58,260 --> 03:01:58,620
I got it.

3053
03:01:58,760 --> 03:01:58,980
Okay.

3054
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:00,520
We'll go over here first.

3055
03:02:05,140 --> 03:02:06,180
Why doesn't he use it?

3056
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:09,140
What?

3057
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:13,700
I'm like, I'm going bonkers.

3058
03:02:16,900 --> 03:02:17,960
Wait, I grabbed it though.

3059
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:18,920
I did.

3060
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:39,920
Okay, I used it that time, but...

3061
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:40,480
Wait, what the hell?

3062
03:02:42,900 --> 03:02:51,240
But it doesn't allow me to aim for the thing, so I'm not quite sure how to knock them down, you know?

3063
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:56,260
I'm so...

3064
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:57,180
Why, game?

3065
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:57,560
Why?

3066
03:02:57,800 --> 03:02:58,780
Why do you do this to me?

3067
03:03:30,080 --> 03:03:31,340
What the heck, eh?

3068
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:35,620
I think you need a sword.

3069
03:03:35,840 --> 03:03:37,520
But nobody is coming with swords.

3070
03:03:50,150 --> 03:03:52,470
I'm just losing money after money after money.

3071
03:03:58,150 --> 03:04:00,510
Oh my god, my eyes are literally glazing over.

3072
03:04:00,670 --> 03:04:01,510
I don't know why.

3073
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:10,720
Whoops, I...

3074
03:04:10,720 --> 03:04:12,680
Why I would have to...

3075
03:04:12,700 --> 03:04:15,340
Like, who would do something?

3076
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:17,600
Oops, oh my bad.

3077
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:19,560
Is there somebody out?

3078
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:20,980
Oh, okay, he just killed me.

3079
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:26,560
Didn't one of them drop a sword?

3080
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:27,680
No?

3081
03:04:29,260 --> 03:04:32,380
Literally every single guy that comes out does not have a sword.

3082
03:04:33,200 --> 03:04:34,360
Oh my god.

3083
03:04:35,280 --> 03:04:35,780
Meow!

3084
03:04:36,900 --> 03:04:38,000
Oh, he didn't kill him.

3085
03:04:38,480 --> 03:04:38,780
Wow.

3086
03:04:43,220 --> 03:04:44,480
Oh my goodness.

3087
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:50,120
I don't think the boss...

3088
03:04:50,120 --> 03:04:53,440
I think we gotta do something with the bridge, just like in the movie.

3089
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:55,620
I don't think it's...

3090
03:04:55,620 --> 03:04:57,300
That we use it on the boss.

3091
03:05:00,340 --> 03:05:01,420
I think that's what it...

3092
03:05:01,420 --> 03:05:03,840
Because the bridge needs to drop.

3093
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,960
Just like in the movie, I think.

3094
03:05:16,450 --> 03:05:16,790
Yeah.

3095
03:05:19,250 --> 03:05:21,950
I think you have to shoot it while the boss is on the bridge.

3096
03:05:24,510 --> 03:05:25,790
Okay, we'll try that.

3097
03:05:25,930 --> 03:05:26,570
We'll try that.

3098
03:05:26,890 --> 03:05:27,750
I have to get a new one.

3099
03:05:28,310 --> 03:05:29,270
Let's try that.

3100
03:05:29,370 --> 03:05:29,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3101
03:05:30,770 --> 03:05:32,330
That seems like it could be right.

3102
03:05:38,060 --> 03:05:39,860
If I can aim for it.

3103
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:40,240
Aim?

3104
03:05:40,660 --> 03:05:40,940
Nope.

3105
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:46,640
Maybe I...

3106
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:47,300
Oh!

3107
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:49,900
I did not aim for it.

3108
03:05:49,980 --> 03:05:51,320
It did not, like, lock on.

3109
03:05:53,380 --> 03:05:54,160
Oh my gosh.

3110
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:55,940
I hate these crossbows.

3111
03:06:01,970 --> 03:06:02,870
I'm trying to get it.

3112
03:06:02,890 --> 03:06:04,330
I'm trying to get it!

3113
03:06:18,880 --> 03:06:21,740
Oh, if you swap the characters and he force grabs you, it stops it.

3114
03:06:21,780 --> 03:06:22,220
That's cool.

3115
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:24,980
But that doesn't help me.

3116
03:06:28,120 --> 03:06:28,840
He's vulnerable.

3117
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:30,240
Oh, when he grabs you.

3118
03:06:30,520 --> 03:06:30,980
Okay, okay.

3119
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:33,220
Oops.

3120
03:06:33,800 --> 03:06:36,180
I didn't think he would actually, like, destroy me like that.

3121
03:06:36,240 --> 03:06:39,700
Okay, so we just gotta, kind of, like, run away from him until he...

3122
03:06:39,700 --> 03:06:40,420
Oh, my goodness.

3123
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:42,140
What the heck is happening?

3124
03:06:44,820 --> 03:06:45,740
I'm tired of this.

3125
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:47,920
No!

3126
03:07:00,150 --> 03:07:01,650
I Dark Souls dodge you!

3127
03:07:01,850 --> 03:07:02,850
Oh, I'm trapped.

3128
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:03,450
Oh my gosh.

3129
03:07:04,050 --> 03:07:04,350
Indeed!

3130
03:07:05,150 --> 03:07:05,850
Why'd you do that?

3131
03:07:08,230 --> 03:07:09,650
Oh my gosh.

3132
03:07:11,570 --> 03:07:14,030
When the boss jumps on you, starts punching as soon as possible.

3133
03:07:14,130 --> 03:07:15,790
When he freezes, you change characters.

3134
03:07:15,970 --> 03:07:16,110
Okay.

3135
03:07:17,690 --> 03:07:18,670
Thank you!

3136
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:24,990
The game, because like...

3137
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:31,400
Oh, um...

3138
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:37,260
The game, because it like follows the movie, but not really, it's like so...

3139
03:07:37,820 --> 03:07:40,360
It becomes so like, wait, what am I supposed to do?

3140
03:07:40,520 --> 03:07:41,040
You know what I mean?

3141
03:07:41,640 --> 03:07:42,640
What the hell?

3142
03:07:43,780 --> 03:07:45,300
He one-shotted me!

3143
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:52,780
You're just like, oh, I know what to do.

3144
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:55,440
I have to take down the bridge!

3145
03:07:55,580 --> 03:07:56,920
And then the game is like, no, no.

3146
03:07:57,400 --> 03:08:00,440
You have to punch him until he takes control of you, and then he hit him.

3147
03:08:01,020 --> 03:08:01,860
I got him!

3148
03:08:01,940 --> 03:08:02,420
I got him!

3149
03:08:02,660 --> 03:08:06,100
I got one heart!

3150
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:09,800
Yeah!

3151
03:08:10,660 --> 03:08:10,760
Oh.

3152
03:08:11,820 --> 03:08:13,880
Hitting everybody, but who we need to?

3153
03:08:15,100 --> 03:08:15,920
Where is he?

3154
03:08:16,360 --> 03:08:17,000
Where's our buddy?

3155
03:08:17,860 --> 03:08:18,480
Where is he?

3156
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:19,480
Is he coming?

3157
03:08:19,720 --> 03:08:20,400
Oh, okay.

3158
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:21,020
He's not coming.

3159
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:22,920
I didn't feel like it this time.

3160
03:08:30,660 --> 03:08:31,340
Uh, hello?

3161
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:34,540
Why didn't he show up?

3162
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:37,800
Wait, maybe now I actually have to...

3163
03:08:38,620 --> 03:08:40,220
Oh wait, because the things are gone.

3164
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:40,820
Hold on.

3165
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:44,640
What is there to grab?

3166
03:08:46,360 --> 03:08:47,020
Wait, is that a sword?

3167
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:49,220
Wait, I can't see.

3168
03:08:53,060 --> 03:08:54,340
Oh, I think we have to...

3169
03:08:54,340 --> 03:08:54,540
Okay.

3170
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:55,900
No way.

3171
03:08:56,060 --> 03:08:56,680
Oh my gosh.

3172
03:08:56,820 --> 03:08:57,680
Oh, there's a sword!

3173
03:08:58,100 --> 03:08:58,280
Okay.

3174
03:08:58,680 --> 03:08:59,300
Oh my gosh.

3175
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:01,020
He has a sword.

3176
03:09:02,140 --> 03:09:03,460
Now I can grab it.

3177
03:09:03,900 --> 03:09:04,520
Where is it?

3178
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:05,940
Okay, he didn't drop it.

3179
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:06,840
I hate this area.

3180
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:07,760
Please, can we not...

3181
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:09,320
Like, I can't see anything over there.

3182
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:11,440
Can we not...

3183
03:09:12,380 --> 03:09:13,640
Fight them, please.

3184
03:09:15,140 --> 03:09:16,580
Can we just stop fighting?

3185
03:09:17,520 --> 03:09:19,240
Can we all just get along?

3186
03:09:20,140 --> 03:09:22,900
I don't think they're ever gonna drop a sword again.

3187
03:09:30,160 --> 03:09:30,420
Oh!

3188
03:09:35,180 --> 03:09:36,260
Oh my gosh.

3189
03:09:36,460 --> 03:09:36,680
Oh!

3190
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:40,260
Okay, now we have to wait until he comes back!

3191
03:09:42,180 --> 03:09:43,140
You bastard!

3192
03:09:43,280 --> 03:09:44,300
You're such an asshole.

3193
03:09:51,130 --> 03:09:57,050
the same thing every time so it's so annoying okay but we got consistent swords

3194
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:21,600
let me let me take down a heart please oh oh dang it i missed my chance i didn't realize

3195
03:10:28,120 --> 03:10:31,560
okay come on hi oh

3196
03:10:36,990 --> 03:10:39,670
Oh, this fight sucks.

3197
03:10:41,150 --> 03:10:43,270
This fight sucks so bad.

3198
03:10:50,980 --> 03:10:51,900
Okay, wait.

3199
03:10:52,340 --> 03:10:53,240
No, I didn't hit him.

3200
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:54,240
I did it.

3201
03:11:11,540 --> 03:11:11,680
Okay.

3202
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:12,720
Okay.

3203
03:11:15,500 --> 03:11:16,420
Thank God.

3204
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:17,040
We did it.

3205
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:17,660
We did it.

3206
03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:19,220
We did it.

3207
03:11:19,680 --> 03:11:20,480
We did it.

3208
03:11:20,780 --> 03:11:20,880
Oops.

3209
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:24,240
Drop your sword.

3210
03:11:24,620 --> 03:11:24,860
Awesome.

3211
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:25,740
No, grab it.

3212
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:26,200
Grab it.

3213
03:11:26,260 --> 03:11:27,120
No, please grab it.

3214
03:11:27,940 --> 03:11:29,320
I was about to...

3215
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:30,380
That was me.

3216
03:11:30,640 --> 03:11:32,020
I was about to start screaming.

3217
03:11:37,090 --> 03:11:37,410
Okay.

3218
03:11:38,230 --> 03:11:38,870
We're full hearts?

3219
03:11:42,310 --> 03:11:42,610
Yeah!

3220
03:11:47,340 --> 03:11:47,860
Yeah!

3221
03:11:49,520 --> 03:11:50,040
Yeah!

3222
03:11:51,080 --> 03:11:53,300
Actually, I'm gonna switch to somebody who doesn't scream.

3223
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,040
And like, actually...

3224
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:58,280
Can pick up the sword when needed.

3225
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:03,260
Come on, team!

3226
03:12:08,790 --> 03:12:10,310
Did they drop it?

3227
03:12:10,650 --> 03:12:10,850
No.

3228
03:12:13,570 --> 03:12:14,790
Come on, team!

3229
03:12:15,770 --> 03:12:15,770
Did

3230
03:12:19,540 --> 03:12:21,520
they drop it?

3231
03:12:23,100 --> 03:12:23,820
No?

3232
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:28,680
Come on, team!

3233
03:12:29,260 --> 03:12:33,880
This game is easier with two players, I believe that.

3234
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:35,860
Wait...

3235
03:12:35,860 --> 03:12:38,880
It looked like he dropped it for a second, but I guess not.

3236
03:12:39,900 --> 03:12:40,680
Come on, team!

3237
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:43,840
We're almost there!

3238
03:12:44,180 --> 03:12:45,300
We're almost there!

3239
03:12:57,630 --> 03:12:57,990
Yeah!

3240
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:03,260
Oh my god.

3241
03:13:03,560 --> 03:13:03,900
Oh my god.

3242
03:13:04,020 --> 03:13:05,300
They're coming from all angles now.

3243
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:06,400
Oh my god.

3244
03:13:06,720 --> 03:13:08,180
They're coming from all angles now!

3245
03:13:08,600 --> 03:13:09,280
Holy cow!

3246
03:13:09,620 --> 03:13:10,440
Oh my gosh!

3247
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:11,640
Oh my gosh!

3248
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:13,060
Oh my gosh!

3249
03:13:13,320 --> 03:13:14,660
They just don't stop coming!

3250
03:13:14,660 --> 03:13:16,680
They just don't stop coming!

3251
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:20,000
Let me like get back over here.

3252
03:13:20,200 --> 03:13:21,380
Oh, grab that heart.

3253
03:13:21,640 --> 03:13:21,760
Thank you.

3254
03:13:22,440 --> 03:13:23,760
We need that for sure.

3255
03:13:25,060 --> 03:13:25,740
Oh, sorry, Indy.

3256
03:13:28,820 --> 03:13:29,920
Oh my god, wait.

3257
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:31,640
When does he come back?

3258
03:13:32,300 --> 03:13:33,340
When does he come back?

3259
03:13:33,700 --> 03:13:34,900
Wait, when does he come back?

3260
03:13:36,860 --> 03:13:38,220
Unless the... unless he doesn't?

3261
03:13:39,180 --> 03:13:40,100
Oh, he doesn't!

3262
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:43,020
No, no, take it out and throw.

3263
03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:44,300
Oops, sorry, Indy.

3264
03:13:49,840 --> 03:13:51,840
I didn't realize it was just to break the bridge.

3265
03:13:57,570 --> 03:13:58,130
We did it.

3266
03:13:59,370 --> 03:14:00,090
We did it.

3267
03:14:02,950 --> 03:14:04,950
No way, they took his hair.

3268
03:14:08,420 --> 03:14:09,920
She doesn't have any cool tricks.

3269
03:14:10,120 --> 03:14:10,780
She's too pretty.

3270
03:14:16,780 --> 03:14:17,080
Yeah!

3271
03:14:22,130 --> 03:14:23,590
Oh my gosh.

3272
03:14:26,570 --> 03:14:27,090
Yeah!

3273
03:14:37,820 --> 03:14:39,220
We did it!

3274
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:44,320
Oh, once I understood the battle, it was better.

3275
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:46,640
It's still silly.

3276
03:14:47,580 --> 03:14:48,340
We're fine, though.

3277
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:49,460
Everything's good.

3278
03:14:50,260 --> 03:14:50,340
Bye.

3279
03:14:55,130 --> 03:14:56,510
Take your bread.

3280
03:15:09,330 --> 03:15:09,890
Flowers!

3281
03:15:12,650 --> 03:15:17,130
And then they just stared lovingly into each other's eyes, and then she was never heard from again.

3282
03:15:25,650 --> 03:15:29,010
My eyes are hurting from staring so much.

3283
03:15:29,270 --> 03:15:29,710
Hold on.

3284
03:15:30,190 --> 03:15:32,210
I don't think I have any eyedrops in here, though.

3285
03:15:34,370 --> 03:15:35,650
See you never, Willy.

3286
03:15:35,950 --> 03:15:36,050
Yep.

3287
03:15:36,670 --> 03:15:38,410
We never heard from her again.

3288
03:15:44,720 --> 03:15:44,920
Yep.

3289
03:15:45,500 --> 03:15:45,800
Yahoo!

3290
03:15:47,460 --> 03:15:48,060
Okay.

3291
03:15:48,900 --> 03:15:49,440
Oops, sorry.

3292
03:15:49,700 --> 03:15:51,200
That was my water bottle hitting.

3293
03:15:53,060 --> 03:15:53,660
The...

3294
03:15:54,460 --> 03:15:55,540
My mic.

3295
03:15:57,780 --> 03:15:58,680
We just keep...

3296
03:15:58,700 --> 03:15:59,740
Keep on buying people.

3297
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:03,060
Chin!

3298
03:16:04,960 --> 03:16:06,000
Dancing, girl.

3299
03:16:07,360 --> 03:16:10,700
Oh, look, we're buying people from the movie we just did, too, so...

3300
03:16:15,560 --> 03:16:16,880
Are the other movies?

3301
03:16:16,980 --> 03:16:18,260
Oh, yeah, they're locked still.

3302
03:16:18,760 --> 03:16:21,000
But we're making enough money that we...

3303
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:22,580
Oh, my gosh, we've almost got everybody.

3304
03:16:24,780 --> 03:16:25,220
Nice.

3305
03:16:26,980 --> 03:16:28,940
I think we'll definitely be able to...

3306
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:30,540
To buy them all.

3307
03:16:30,940 --> 03:16:32,940
Who the hell are you?

3308
03:16:37,900 --> 03:16:38,660
But

3309
03:16:44,250 --> 03:16:45,650
this was fun!

3310
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:48,650
Thank you guys for the temple of doom!

3311
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:54,490
And then next time, we'll finish it off with the last crusade.

3312
03:16:54,910 --> 03:16:55,710
With our papa.

3313
03:16:57,970 --> 03:16:58,730
Shhh.

3314
03:16:59,810 --> 03:17:04,090
And then we'll be done with Lego Indiana Jones.

3315
03:17:05,670 --> 03:17:06,190
Yay!

3316
03:17:06,530 --> 03:17:09,430
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

3317
03:17:09,970 --> 03:17:10,290
Yeah!

3318
03:17:11,330 --> 03:17:11,790
Whoa!

3319
03:17:13,230 --> 03:17:24,130
It helps this time I got all my exploration of this place out of the way previously, so we were still able to be at least the last of the arc.

3320
03:17:25,470 --> 03:17:26,510
And then...

3321
03:17:27,130 --> 03:17:27,650
Yeah!

3322
03:17:28,170 --> 03:17:28,550
