00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,410
Ah, yeah, baby.

Woo, okay.

5
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,270
It seems like it's working.

6
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,770
Oh, my gosh.

7
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,530
It's working.

8
00:03:49,970 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, we- Oh.

9
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,300
I can't tell him.

10
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,340
I can't check the audio.

11
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,640
Hopefully it's okay.

12
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,480
I lowered it a little bit.

13
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,040
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,940
Hello, everybody.

15
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,440

Oh, yeah.

19
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,720
Oh, snakes.

20
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Why is it gotta be snakes?

21
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,740
Oh, let's go.

22
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,140
Okay, what's happening?

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,420
Oh, yeah.

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,340
Oh, yeah.

25
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,660
Use that whip.

26
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,460
Oh, yeah.

27
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wow.

28
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Oh, my God, is he gonna do it to him, too?

29
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,040
Oh, okay.

30
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, oh, it's that song.

31
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,820
Oh my gosh.

32
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,340
Wow, it's everything.

33
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,280
Wow.

34
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Oh, it's a Lego boulder.

35
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
Anything goes.

36
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,900
Ghost made so precious, she belongs in the museum.

37
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
Oh, no, it's fighting on the bridge.

38
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,200
Oh, no.

39
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,540
Oh, my gosh.

40
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,900
It's just like the moon.

41
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,060
Lego Gators are so cute.

42
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:43,960
Oh.

43
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,740
Spoilers.

44
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay.

45
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,600
That was the audio, everybody.

46
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,420
I can't tell at all.

47
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,440
I can't check my settings, so.

48
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, dang.

49
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,260
Am I going to be doing that?

50
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,760
It's good?

51
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:02,960
Okay.

52
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,120
Yay!

53
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,480
Wait, are these all...

54
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,460
Are these, like, the first three movies in...

55
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,540
What?

56
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,040
Wow, what's coming soon?

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,240
I sure hope it's...

58
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Comes out soon.

59
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,740
The game is loud?

60
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,900
Okay, I'll lower it a little bit.

61
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080
It's the first three movies!

62
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,020
Wow!

63
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,700
That's why it's called the original Adventures.

64
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, I honestly thought that...

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
I didn't know.

66
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,940
Actually, I didn't know if it was going to be based on the movies or like just had references to them.

67
00:06:44,960 --> 00:07:15,880
them or what exciting this is my first time ever playing a lego game that's like based off of an ip so um for those wondering i would like to uh i would like to play like the batman game in the future too and uh you're in for a treat yeah i the only lego game i ever played i was I'm super into Legos.

68
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,660
Like, I loved building Legos, but, um...

69
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,300
Extra kettle!

70
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Uh, but...

71
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,180
What was I gonna say?

72
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,640
Oh!

73
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,500
The only one I played on, like, on my computer was...

74
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,740
Lego Island.

75
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,480
Oh yeah, Lego Star Wars!

76
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,480
I think, though, I need to watch Star Wars first.

77
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,900
Maybe I'll do, like, a watch along or something.

78
00:07:45,480 --> 00:08:14,320

80
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,020
Are these voice actors?

81
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,800
Oh, hmm.

82
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,560
Hmm.

83
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,860
He's humming.

84
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,780
Oh.

85
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,000
They're just mumbling like the Minecraft villagers?

86
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,560
Ooh.

87
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,080
Icky.

88
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:36,840
What?

89
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,780
Hmm.

90
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,560
Oh!

91
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,480
He looked so shy!

92
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,120
Where are these boys?

93
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,880
Where did these have boys?

94
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Are they just miming the entire time?

95
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh my god, the Lego bats are so cute.

96
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,480
Indy!

97
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,460
No voices?

98
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,920
They just make sounds.

99
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,640
Oh my gosh, we're here!

100
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,140
Wee!

101
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,540
Press Y to take control of other characters.

102
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,960
Oh, oh, yeah.

103
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,180
Kill yourself!

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,440
Oh, he's gone?

105
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,220
Oh, he's back.

106
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah!

107
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,660
Oh, oh, yeah!

108
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,980
Look at him go!

109
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,980
He's punching!

110
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,440
Oh, my gosh, I'm collecting.

111
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
No, no, no, my money, my money, my money!

112
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,700
Wait, what's this?

113
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, I got like an idle thing.

114
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,080
Wait, okay.

115
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh, this is...

116
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,500
Okay, this is...

117
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,740
I like change souls.

118
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,040
It's kind of crazy.

119
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,500
Hiya!

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,260
Ha!

121
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:04,980
Woo!

122
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,760
Sick moves!

123
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,740
Alfred Molina's first rolls.

124
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,560
AKA Dr. Octopus.

125
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,560
What's he doing?

126
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,680
Why is... Oh no, my money!

127
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,140
Oh, okay.

128
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,660
Oh, don't fall off, Indy!

129
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,200
I lost all my money!

130
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,480
Don't do it again.

131
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,320
Don't do it again.

132
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,020
Okay, this is punch.

133
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,580
Punch, punch, punch, punch.

134
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,200
Wait!

135
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,080
Oh my gosh, could I... Could me and a friend play this?

136
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,500
Look for Lego objects in the ground.

137
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,520
If you have a shovel, press B, dig them up.

138
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:46,740
Okay.

139
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,580
Whoa!

140
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,900
I don't have a shovel, unfortunately.

141
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,020
But I do have my whip.

142
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,540
Wait, he has a shovel!

143
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,460
Take it out!

144
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,770
Oh, okay, there we go.

145
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,100
Oh, sorry.

146
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,940
There's friendly fire.

147
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
How does he have all my money?

148
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh, no, just kidding.

149
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
I have all my money.

150
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,860
I'm climbing this treehouse.

151
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:34,880
Nice.

152
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,700
Good job, Indy.

153
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,900
This is so silly.

154
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,620
Okay.

155
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,720
Actually, it actually looks so good even.

156
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,680
Oh, my bad.

157
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Player one's money.

158
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,820
I'm not giving that guy a single penny.

159
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,880
Oh.

160
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,980
Okay, we'll get it.

161
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,660
This is the tutorial.

162
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,940
If I just...

163
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,280
Ah!

164
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,220
Okay, okay.

165
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,560
It's not so cruel.

166
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,440
Huh?

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:16,900
Huh?

168
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,220
She's learning.

169
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,060
Oh.

170
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,660
Um, he's fine.

171
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,140
He's fine.

172
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,360
Oh!

173
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,940
Why did I jump?

174
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,920
Okay, we're both here.

175
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,980
What is this?

176
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,940
Approach piles of Lego bricks and hold...

177
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,620
What are you to build?

178
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,340
Oh!

179
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,120
I made... What is this?

180
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,480
What is this?

181
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm doing archaeology.

182
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,800
Ah!

183
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,240
Yeah!

184
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,700
Yeah!

185
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,180
What does it do now?

186
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,680
Wait.

187
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,460
Wait.

188
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,980

Oh my god, was that a spider?

195
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,800
I think I killed it, though.

196
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,160
Oh my gosh.

197
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,060
With my favorite guy, I thought it was a collab.

198
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,080
Hi, it's Indy.

199
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,920
Wait, is he gonna make it?

200
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,060
Okay, hold on.

201
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,770
Indy, why did you do that?

202
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,810
Okay, hold on.

203
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,350
Alright, now he can make it.

204
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,730
I need him!

205
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,630
I need him to dig that thing up!

206
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,270
Okay, hold on.

207
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,510
Wait a second.

208
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,110
I don't know why I made Indy come- you know what, hold on.

209
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,710
Okay, you go here.

210
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,770
This guy here.

211
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,270
If he jumps...

212
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,430
Oh.

213
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,660
Is he losing our money?

214
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,080
Oh my gosh, no.

215
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,900
It's like Sonic rings.

216
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,520
Maybe use the trampoline.

217
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,100
I don't think the trampoline...

218
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,360
It's all the way over here.

219
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,740
I don't think that's how that works, pal.

220
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,520
I don't think that's how that works.

221
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,720
Wait, hold on.

222
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,900
Let's get our money back.

223
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,340
Use the vine.

224
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,380
I was trying, but he didn't grab on.

225
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm gonna get money in?

226
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:56,740
Okay.

227
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,700
All right.

228
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,640
All right.

229
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,360
Grab on.

230
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,180
Okay, here we go.

231
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,900
What could we be buying anyway out here?

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,400
Oh.

233
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,860
I'm losing...

234
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,040
I'm losing thousands.

235
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,440
Yeah, that's a harigato.

236
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,830
Why is he not jumping?

237
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,670
Why?

238
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,290
I'm pressing A!

239
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,060
Why?

240
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,940
I'm doing this, you guys!

241
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,940
I don't know what's happening!

242
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,160
Oh, wait, that's why.

243
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,460
Right here!

244
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,760
He doesn't jump!

245
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,180
It's not me!

246
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,020
It's not me!

247
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,780
I think it's broke!

248
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,240
It wasn't...

249
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,580
You guys were all blaming me!

250
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Blame!

251
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,980
Blame the VTuber!

252
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,930
Thank you, Supa-chan.

253
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,330
Don't mind, don't mind.

254
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,160
Someone said V-Sync something?

255
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,060
Is it under video settings?

256
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,220
Oh!

257
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,140
Like now?

258
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,960
Oh, okay.

259
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,820
Oh, wait, yeah.

260
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,200
Ah!

261
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,420
We're back!

262
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,860
Oh.

263
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,860
Okay, hold on.

264
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,860
Let's just let's let Indy do it and have this guy just do his own.

265
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,040
Oh, see?

266
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,220
I didn't even need to do anything.

267
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,660
Okay, now dig.

268
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,210
Carry Lego objects to highlighted plates and press B to put them in place.

269
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:37,370
Oh my money I lost all my money from a bug this sucks it's fine I can punch more plants give me oh wait do you need that you're fine I lost all my money to a bug no way oh wait is this the bad one or the good one Oh, my money, my money.

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,210
I need this.

271
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,330
I'm broke.

272
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,390
I'm broke.

273
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:40,690
Wait.

274
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,050
Okay.

275
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,590
Are you the duck that spits money or are you the duck that spits arrows?

276
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:58,110
You try to beat this level with 10k, 20k studs, buy the first artifact with two players and you'll get 4 billion.

277
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:58,790
What?

278
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,550
This might still be world record pace.

279
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:04,990
You're right.

280
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,370
Oh, yeah!

281
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,990
Yeah, oh, oh, oh.

282
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Dig, dig, dig, dig.

283
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,770
Keep digging.

284
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,070
Keep digging.

285
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,050
Oh, nice.

286
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,310
My money.

287
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:21,990
Oh!

288
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,830
Little spider.

289
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,630
Oh, I didn't even notice the spider there.

290
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,110
I love what they all give me.

291
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,170
Money.

292
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,490
Interesting.

293
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,490
Doesn't look that sharp.

294
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,230
When you died and became a ghost, did you drop Lego?

295
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,250
No?

296
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,230
Oh yeah, good job.

297
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,150
Jump over it.

298
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,770
Don't...

299
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,730
He would have... He could have killed me.

300
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,350
For real.

301
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,550
Dig!

302
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,510
Dig, man servant.

303
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,490
Uh, over here.

304
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,310
And B.

305
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,170
What else is here?

306
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:09,910
What's this thing?

307
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,850
Oh, objects with handles can be pushed and pulled and move up to the handle.

308
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,730
Oh.

309
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,270
So what do I do?

310
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,530
Oh, that's one.

311
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,630
Okay.

312
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,650
Now you.

313
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,330
Ha-ha!

314
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,350
Now you.

315
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,630
Oh.

316
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,910
I need you to stay where you...

317
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,070
Oh.

318
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,070
Okay, never mind.

319
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,790
Very good.

320
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,070
Thank you for the gifted friendly elephant.

321
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,430
Oh, oh, we're pressing B.

322
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,950
You need a shovel to paddle vehicles.

324
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:48,950
We do?

325
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,670
Oh!

326
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,850
That guy's not gonna bother us, is he?

327
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,250
Press A to jump off, or why to switch to another character?

328
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,670
Oh, oh, don't go down the waterfall.

329
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,570
I don't remember this part, everybody.

330
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,010
I don't remember this at all.

331
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,350
Okay, Indy, getting way ahead of yourself, buddy.

332
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,470
I think this guy's...

333
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,670
Oh!

334
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,110
Oh!

335
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:19,950
Oh!

336
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:20,770
Oh!

337
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,290
Oh!

338
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,110
I got greedy.

339
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,350
My bad.

340
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,850
I'm still greedy.

341
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,710
I'm still greedy.

342
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,870
I'm still greedy.

343
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:31,810
I'm greedy.

344
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,830
Give me money!

345
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,230
Wait!

346
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,330
Wait!

347
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,100
There's so much to be collected here.

348
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,360
Oh, wait.

349
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,240
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,340
Um, I thought I was supposed to be piloting this thing.

351
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,740
Wait, why am I not piloting it?

352
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,120
Pilot it.

353
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
Pilot the boat.

354
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,530
Uh.

355
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,670
Hmm.

356
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,290
Why?

357
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,870
Oh, it's why?

358
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,850
Oh, it is why.

359
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,270
Thank you.

360
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,490
Okay.

361
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,370
All right.

362
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:14,930
Hi, Andy.

363
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:15,850
Oh.

364
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,950
Wow, stupid spiders, stupid spiders, just squish them, we squish them.

365
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,950
Oh, we squish them, we squish them.

366
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,030
Okay, nice.

367
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:30,750
Wow.

368
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,630
It's ASMR, it sounds so good.

369
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:36,730
Yeah!

370
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,070
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

371
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,970
Yeah, give me more, give me more!

372
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,670
Indy wouldn't destroy all this stuff.

373
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,410
Woo!

374
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,550
Oh my god!

375
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,450
I'm beating you up.

376
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,290
Oh, oh, sorry.

377
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,770
My bad.

378
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,190
What's over here?

379
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,470
There's more stuff up here.

380
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,410
I'm getting rich.

381
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,210
I'm getting rich.

382
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,690
Oh, there's more.

383
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,770
There's more.

384
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,150
Okay.

385
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,670
We're fine.

386
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,950
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

387
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,590
Oh!

388
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,330
What's this?

389
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,430
There's more, there's more.

390
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,790
Pull lever.

391
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,090
Pull the lever, crunk.

392
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,830
What did that do?

393
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,310
Can we go inside?

394
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,750
Okay, I'm gonna need you to leave.

395
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,010
Alright, we'll have Indy follow us.

396
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,410
Surely he won't fall.

397
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,270
I don't know why we're so against the wall.

398
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,150
I don't know if that's what I was supposed to- Ah!

399
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,910
Hey, let's go.

400
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,430
I think the shovel is way better.

401
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,200
What's that do?

402
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,060
Oh!

403
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,040
Oh!

404
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,770
Yeah!

405
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,690
It's called?

406
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,170
Secret tunnel.

407
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,040
Oh my gosh.

408
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,540
Stop it!

409
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,100
Oh.

410
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,820
I'll rescue you in- Oh, you little hat!

411
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,860
Wait, so what is this?

412
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,640
I guess we have to go towards this- Oh, just kidding.

413
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:33,900
Wait!

414
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,800
Wait!

415
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,010
Alright.

416
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:41,750
One sec.

417
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,610
Okay, let's go to the secret tunnel now.

418
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,930
That's priority number one.

419
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,210
We'll do it as Indy.

420
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:49,810
It's cooler.

421
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:50,990
No!

422
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,990
Leave us alone!

423
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,970
Leave us alone!

424
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,990
Okay, the other spider doesn't care.

425
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,230
Oh, yes, he does.

426
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,610
Oh!

427
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,550
Hiya!

428
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,370
Okay.

429
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,830
The boat?

430
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,510
Um, you need to...

431
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,430
You drive the boat.

432
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,690
Oh, we're on it.

433
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,950
We're on the boat.

434
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,070
We're going to pilot the boat.

435
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,670
We're going to drive the boat.

436
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,290
Drive the boat.

437
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,090
I can, right?

438
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,430
Get on the boat.

439
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,390
Okay, and press Y.

440
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,290
There we go.

441
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,330
Thank you, my show.

442
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,170
Yes, yes, yes.

443
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,690
Indy, I'll be right back, okay, buddy?

444
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,270
Oh, I'm too fat.

445
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,050
Wait.

446
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:52,290

448
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:23,550

449
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,410
Is this not the door?

450
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,550
I thought that would open.

451
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,990
You think if I fall, I'll die?

452
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,470
There's a platform now.

453
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,290
Wait, where?

454
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,370
Oh, I see!

455
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,450
Oh!

456
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,630
Yeah!

457
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:44,870
Baby!

458
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,110
Oh, I almost missed that, you guys.

459
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:49,790
Thank you.

460
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,730
The VTuber is blind.

461
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,170
Whoa.

462
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,090
The VTuber has No recollection of...

463
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,630
Anything.

464
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,950
Uh, my friend is dying.

465
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,370
Okay, you get on the boat and you drive.

466
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,110
Okay, nice.

467
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,330
Alright, now we can get out, right?

468
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,130
Okay, good.

469
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,010
Excuse us, excuse us.

470
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,090
So sorry.

471
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,810
Can I...

472
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,250
Eat the alligator.

473
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,900
Treasure, baby, treasure, baby, treasure!

474
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,680
That was close.

475
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh, I'm good.

476
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,160
Let's go.

477
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,960
For every spider you kill virtually a real spider shall appear near...

478
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Oh, don't say that.

479
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,780
Okay, what do we got here?

480
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,880
This looks might be modern to be a...

481
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,140
It's like a modern-looking...

482
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,760
What's the word?

483
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,380
Ladder.

484
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,240
Okay, so I need to build something here.

485
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,800
Okay, interesting.

486
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,800
We're in these doing flips and tricks and everything.

487
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:10,640
Oh.

488
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,020
Wait, if I...

489
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,140
Oh.

490
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,140
Okay, that's death.

491
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,440
Rain of them.

492
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:23,940
No!

493
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,960
Alright, so let's go back up here.

494
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,460
Let's...

495
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,600
Because I can't go that direction.

496
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,760
Can I go anything over here?

497
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,640
Anything over...

498
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,380
Death.

499
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,680
Love it.

500
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,420
Losing all my money again.

501
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,840
What do I...

502
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,460
Use Indy.

503
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,010
Oh, I see it!

504
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,190
Where's this?

505
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,430
Oh.

506
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,150
Little spitter.

507
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,090
Um.

508
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,490
They want me to put it on the green.

509
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,310
Ah!

510
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,190
Okay, okay.

511
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,410
Wait, no, pick it up.

512
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,550
Wait, that was wrong.

513
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,750
Like, take it back.

514
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,650
Oh wait, it's gone now.

515
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,510
How'd that work?

516
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:24,940
Okay.

517
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,460
Now the last one.

518
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,880
Oh, because I'm standing on it!

519
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

520
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,790
Oh my gosh, she's standing on it.

521
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,070
Should we get all on his own?

522
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,170
I didn't have to do anything.

523
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,770
Thank you for playing silly games and having silly time.

524
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,970
Like, really hard day to day.

525
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,950
Aw, happy dog.

526
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,150
Thank you.

527
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,170
We always have silly time.

528
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,450
Don't worry about it.

529
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,610
Oh, right in front of me.

530
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,410
That's embarrassing.

531
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,970
Guys, is this the right time to say I'm not good at platformers?

532
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,950
I'm not good at...

533
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:09,650
Hmm.

534
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:10,590
Okay.

535
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,090
Well, you know, um...

536
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,750
Use your whip to pull things that are out of reach.

537
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,810
Oh, okay.

538
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,690
Oh, let's build.

539
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,850
It shows.

540
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,570
What are you talking about?

541
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,590
I haven't even done anything bad yet.

542
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,450
Wait.

543
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,010
Secret.

544
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,250
Okay, get out of my way.

545
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,010
You're gonna fall to your death.

546
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,390
Okay.

547
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,870
We can tell.

548
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,810
Shut up!

549
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,990
You don't know yet.

550
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,030
You don't know anything yet.

551
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,550
You know what?

552
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,410
What if I said I'm God at platformers, huh?

553
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,290
You would be eating your...

554
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,070
Wait, which way do I go?

555
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,850
Let's go to the right first, because it seems like...

556
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,090
Oh!

557
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,550
I see a body!

558
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,210
You see a little... Wait.

559
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,610
You see that little skeleton?

560
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,270
Actually, guys, I lied.

561
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,750
I'm actually God at platformers.

562
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,170
You're all silly for saying that I'm not.

563
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,210
I'm disrespecting his grave.

564
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,530
Alright, actually, let's go the other way.

565
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,510
I might be a little blind.

566
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,970
That's for sure.

567
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,570
Oh my gosh, I made it.

568
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,170
Oh, okay, good.

569
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,950
This was the way.

570
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,640
I want to get up top there.

571
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,020
But it doesn't...

572
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,120
Okay, it doesn't...

573
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Oh, that was close.

574
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,740
A little blind.

575
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,340
I might be a little blind.

576
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,120
I've seen you play Astrobot.

577
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,460
This claim is suspect.

578
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,720
What about me being bad?

579
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,140
I know.

580
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,940
I'm so good.

581
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,440
You're like...

582
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,620
Don't put yourself down, Queen.

583
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,040
Oh!

584
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,280
I should have known.

585
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,100
That was a trap.

586
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Okay.

587
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,280
Well, um, now I know.

588
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,860
Oh, let's see.

589
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,720
Okay.

590
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,960
Oh.

591
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,840
Okay.

592
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,240
All right.

593
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,460
Oh.

594
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,480
Okay.

595
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:26,960
Nice.

596
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,540
We did it.

597
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,860
Okay.

598
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:29,880
We did it.

599
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,280
Ouch.

600
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,020
We're fine.

601
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,140
We didn't even get a scratch.

602
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,160
Give me a heart.

603
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,660
Cool.

604
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,620
I had a feeling.

605
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,140
And now open up.

606
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,640
Hi.

607
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,020
Hi.

608
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,160
Hi.

609
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,240
What are you doing?

610
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,500
Oh, why are you coming back?

611
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,940
Don't make me do it again.

612
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, I needed...

613
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,420
Oh!

614
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,540
I...

615
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,100
Not a hard dough?

616
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,820
We're fine.

617
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm punch.

618
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,160
I'm punching him.

619
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,400
They're just Legos.

620
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,080
It's not even...

621
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,040
Whatever.

622
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,380
They're just...

623
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,720
Oh!

624
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,620
They die in one pot.

625
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,520
Oh, luckily he doesn't.

626
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,500
You need a key to operate this mechanism.

627
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,900
Find one and press B to put it in.

628
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,430
Hey, look behind you!

629
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,130
Oh, is this the key that we need?

630
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,990
Pretty easy.

631
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:49,690
Okay.

632
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,550
Does it stop or...

633
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:00,910
Oh, yeah.

634
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,250
No.

635
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:01,790
Yes.

636
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,690
But... Okay.

637
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,410
But there was some stuff downstairs.

638
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,350
Aha!

639
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,190
Let's go down.

640
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,030
Be careful of Gator.

641
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,430
What am I?

642
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,610
Who's hitting me?

643
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,010
I can't see anything.

644
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,810
Oh, maybe I should have gone down first before I changed the map.

645
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,130
Don't worry about it, everybody.

646
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,730
Don't worry, you're pretty little heads.

647
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,450
Shiny silver Lego objects can be destroyed by blowing them up!

648
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,240
Dunos, all-time favorite Indiana Jones movie.

649
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,050
I like the first one.

650
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,240
Silly Lego things and epic John Williams soundtrack to this good mix.

651
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,520
How to cause explosion.

652
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:02,700
Hmm.

653
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,240
Oh, oh, never mind.

654
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:14,920
I saw the spinny purple one and that chat is kind of blocking, but I thought it was a big special one.

655
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,080
It's not.

656
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,840
It's just showing how many coins I have.

657
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,180
Oh my gosh, my thumbnail.

658
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,780
Wait, did we get the sand?

659
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:36,840
No.

660
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,900
No, don't waste my money.

661
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,600
Not my money!

662
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,080
Oh, okay.

663
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,440
Oh, uh-oh.

664
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:43,900
Oh, I don't know.

665
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,120
Oh, uh-huh.

666
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,520
Oh, uh, time to go.

667
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,180
Uh-oh.

668
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,500
Time to go.

669
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:56,960
Oh!

670
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,540
Oops.

671
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,980
You guys know this?

672
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,940
Uh, wait.

673
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,280
I didn't even do anything!

674
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,760
I'm pressing B.

675
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,660
Oh, maybe I have to...

676
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,800
Okay, I just jumped to this.

677
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,000
one.

678
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,140
No, I don't.

679
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,440
Please!

680
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,660
Andy!

681
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,480
Good thing we're in no rush, right, everybody?

682
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm a pro gamer!

683
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,100
Here I go!

684
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,300
Oh, oh, oh!

685
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,740
See?

686
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,220
See?

687
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,000
Gosh, you guys.

688
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,900
Come on!

689
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,520
Uh-oh.

690
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,140
Uh-oh.

691
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,540
Okay.

692
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,420
We're going.

693
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:40,780
We're going.

694
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,580
We're going.

695
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,180
That gold piece will just have to I have to wait.

696
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,040
Hoi!

697
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,260
There's more over here.

698
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,100
It's fine.

699
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:50,720
Oh!

700
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,780
We'll let it go.

701
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,660
We're in no real danger.

702
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,540
I don't know how he survived, though.

703
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,580
Wait, can I beat this thing up?

704
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,780
Only thuggy characters know the secret way to activate.

705
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,900
Oh, what?

706
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,520
Is there, like, New Game Plus in this?

707
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,560
Oh, gosh.

708
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,240
That scared me.

709
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,260
Okay.

710
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:15,940
Oh!

711
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,610
Oh, that's so unfair.

712
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,850
I didn't see it coming.

713
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,330
Okay.

714
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,590
Jump!

715
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,290
Okay.

716
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:31,810
Okay, that's so unfair.

717
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,430
Okay, you get the other one.

718
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:33,650
Yeah!

719
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,170
Good job.

720
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:34,690
Okay.

721
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,950
Oh.

722
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,610
Oh, we needed to!

723
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,170
There we go!

724
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,070
Okay, nice.

725
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,610
All right, let's keep going.

726
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,710
Ah!

727
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,670
It's so...

728
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,950
Oh, I made it somehow.

729
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,650
Oh my gosh, we're not fine.

730
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,370
What?

731
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,650
We're fine.

732
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,150
Oh my gosh.

733
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,270
I need to adjust my controller.

734
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,030
Okay, there we go.

735
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,390
I'm fine.

736
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,450
Oh, I'm not fine.

737
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,270
No, I have to do it for the very beginning.

738
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,590
That's so lame.

739
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:18,780
Oh.

740
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,280
Oh, wait.

741
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,340
Oh my gosh.

742
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm just keep having to adjust my controller.

743
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,240
Wait!

744
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,320
Please!

745
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,940
Wait.

746
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,820
Alright, we gotta be- We gotta be perfect.

747
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,680
Oh.

748
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:49,740
Oh.

749
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,400
Oh.

750
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,140
We're fine.

751
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,360
It's like only right behind us.

752
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,900
Don't worry about it.

753
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,720
It's like only right behind us.

754
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,820
The tree is right behind me.

755
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,320
Isn't she?

756
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,450
Oh, see, I made it!

757
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,850
He double-crossed me!

758
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,310
Wait.

759
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,370
Oh, you want a rubber ducky?

760
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,830
What is happening?

761
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:32,710
What?

762
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,130
What is going on?

763
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,790
Why is he a robot all of a sudden?

764
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,110
Is it because he's the C3PO?

765
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,290
Ah, we almost gave him the other golden head.

766
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,570
Ha ha ha!

767
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,580
Wait, when did short round get here?

768
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,260
Hello?

769
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,780
I beat up plants, I beat up plants.

770
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,280
Look how cool I am.

771
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,640
I'm an adult and I beat up.

772
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:09,920
Ah!

773
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,540
Oh my gosh, there's people.

774
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,240
I beat up people.

775
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,220
I actually kill people.

776
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,480
And I take their stuff.

777
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:20,980
What is this?

778
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,820
I took that crossbow.

779
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,840
I beat it up.

780
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,400
I beat it up.

781
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,060
I beat it up.

782
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,020
Oh, sorry.

783
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,440
Sorry.

784
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,680
I just killed a child.

785
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,160
We're fine.

786
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,140
Anyway, we'll escape once I have a true adventurer.

787
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,180
What does that mean?

788
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,760
We, we, we, we, it's just...

789
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,920
Do you have to do it?

790
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,700
Oh, you're beating me?

791
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,880
Oh, you're not sure why you're the pilot.

792
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,660
I don't know anything that's going on, you guys.

793
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,340
I'm like, why is he here?

794
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,340
Hey, hey,

795
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,410
come here.

796
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,610
Take, take, take, take.

797
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,850
All right, yeah, beat him up for me.

798
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,110
I put this together.

799
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,890
Oh, just kidding.

800
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,630
Oh, my gosh.

801
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,530
I can't believe it.

802
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,590
Okay, the whip is kind of bad.

803
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,910
Oh, my gosh.

804
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,530
So awesome.

805
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,210
Oh, sorry.

806
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:52,630
Oh.

807
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,110
I'm not... I'm not trying, I promise!

808
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,730
Oh my god.

809
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,090
Oh, there's a thing here.

810
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,230
Bravo?

811
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:08,130
Okay.

812
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,130
Does it want me to jump over there?

813
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,330
Oh my gosh, there's stuff all the way over there!

814
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,830
Okay, finally it's letting me...

815
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,530
Oh, I think I can't build until I'm...

816
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,250
Until I kill all the guys.

817
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,610
That's why I wouldn't let me build before.

818
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:27,950
Maybe.

819
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,810
Okay.

820
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:30,730
Sorry.

821
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,570
Even his hair!

822
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,290
Okay, keep going, keep going.

823
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,690
Keep going, keep going.

824
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,010
Yeah!

825
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:39,470
Woo!

826
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,030
Oh.

827
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,250
Oh wait, I can swim?

828
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,700
There's no crocodiles, so...

829
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,000
I wonder what he's doing.

830
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,940
Well, I'm getting rich in the water.

831
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,860
I guess I didn't think about it because the crocodiles were in there before.

832
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,900
Getting rich over here.

833
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:24,510
Awesome.

834
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:27,670
Ha!

835
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,290
Oh, ha!

836
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,130
Wait, hold on.

837
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,510
And, oh, ha!

838
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,670
And, ha!

839
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:35,970
Nah, I can't.

840
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,050
All right.

841
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,610
Oh, my gosh.

842
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,930
Kick your butts!

843
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,490
I'll kick your butts!

844
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,750
Yeah, drop kick!

845
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:44,710
Okay, go fix it.

846
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,370
Fix it.

847
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:49,770
Fix.

848
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:50,490
Fix.

849
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,670
Fix the machinery.

850
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,670
Do it!

851
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,190
Oh, yeah!

852
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,950
He can really hold his own, huh?

853
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,030
Oh, my

854
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,390
gosh.

855
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,910
Oh, my gosh.

856
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,770
Is the snake violating?

857
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,630
Oh, no.

858
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,030
A free play!

859
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:25,270
I can be Indiana Jones or I could be...

860
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,730
Satipa!

861
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,550
Or Jock!

862
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,430
I'm a true adventurer, everybody.

863
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,370
Wow.

864
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:43,990
That was a sound.

865
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,190
Oh,

866
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:49,690
my cow!

867
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:52,110
It just keeps going!

868
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,690
I missed four.

869
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,570
That's kind of crazy.

870
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,990
Well, I guess there were some things we couldn't...

871
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,800
We couldn't get to.

872
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,600
Barnett College.

873
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,780
What's here?

874
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,140
Oh, save?

875
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,600
Oh, that's the hub!

876
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,460
Oh, so we're going in?

877
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,680
You can't get all the pieces of a treasure on the first playthrough.

878
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,780
Okay, that makes sense.

879
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,700
Oh, yeah, I've got my...

880
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,660
Oh, I am the pilot.

881
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,660
I've got my pilot here.

882
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,700
It's me.

883
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,560
I'm the pilot.

884
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:42,960
Dang.

885
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,740
I hope the school doesn't make me pay for those.

886
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,860
Can I kill this too?

887
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,220
Oh, no.

888
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,100
Oh, dang it.

889
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,600
mission.

890
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Hello.

891
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,290
She's too fast for me.

892
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:05,150
Who are you?

893
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,690
Get her.

894
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,010
I was.

895
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:13,450
Oh.

896
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,650
Someone said that I should buy things.

897
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,070
Do I buy things in here?

898
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,610
Is this the buying things area?

899
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,550
Don't take my money.

900
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,130
I did whip that woman and I do it again.

901
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,210
I saw it in the trailer.

902
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,630
Watch, I can whip her.

903
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,770
And then she comes to me and I give her a big old smooch.

904
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,130
Oh, cute.

905
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,430
Oh, fun.

906
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,430
Oh, I wonder what it looks like completed.

907
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,710
Buy pieces.

908
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:00,910
No.

909
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,470
I'm going to collect them myself.

910
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,070
What's this?

911
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:08,170
Oh!

912
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,420
Oh!

913
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:16,840
Oh!

914
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,480
Give me the money!

915
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,320
Why do we have such a discovery in our own museum?

916
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Just buy it?

917
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,180
No!

918
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,380
I know I'm rich, but...

919
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,210
Hmm.

920
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,770
I love how all these people are looking at empty exhibits.

921
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:49,050
Nobody's looking at the one thing that actually has something.

922
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,550
This music gets emotional.

923
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:53,790
Does it?

924
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,110
Are you feeling a little emotional by it?

925
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:02,510
Oh.

926
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:04,990
Courtyard!

927
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,590
Is there gotcha?

928
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,030
I think this was before gotcha was so it was popularized.

929
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:26,330
So we're safe from gotcha here hello why can't i hmm interesting

930
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,230
oh oh i can oh how

931
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,270

932
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,510
metal gear oh whoops

933
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,890
Gosh, everything explodes.

934
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,430
Just a bush.

935
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,590
Just a bush.

936
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,950
Don't worry about it.

937
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,350
And we're getting rich here too by doing vandalism.

938
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,450
What is this teaching the children?

939
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,270
Why does it have to be solid sake?

940
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,250
That's so good.

941
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,190
Oh, wow!

942
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,950
The art...

943
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,130
Stranger.

944
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,350
You're no stranger to me.

945
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,430
What's this?

946
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:45,750
Oh.

947
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,790
Oh, my god!

948
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:51,840
What?

949
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,310
Mint!

950
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:04,270
Can he be blue?

951
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:05,770
No, dang.

952
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,090
Mint!

953
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,610
Oh!

954
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,470
Close, close, close enough.

955
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:23,910
Can they even change his tiny whites?

956
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,660
There we go.

957
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,420
What does this do?

958
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,700
It just tells me things and does not give me any explanation.

959
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,720
Power, thank you!

960
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,300
Thank you so much for the hook, Asupa.

961
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,700
I hope you have a great rest of your week.

962
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,200
You too!

963
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,280
What should we wear?

964
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,320
I should like be Lego hair.

965
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,060
Wait, did they have white hair?

966
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,000
No.

967
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,380
Close.

968
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,330
Hey, what are you doing here?

969
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,090
Oh, good.

970
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:15,950
I can kill him.

971
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,150
And then take his shovel.

972
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,430
Yeah, murder in the museum!

973
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,250
Wait, I really just...

974
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,430
just... Oh, he's following me.

975
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,270
Oh, his ghost.

976
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,850
His ghost is now haunting.

977
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,900
Okay, what's on the other side?

978
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,440
What is this?

979
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,470
Should I just buy it?

980
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,630
It's characters.

981
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,970
Oh!

982
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,370
Well, they don't even ask.

983
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,150
Like, are you sure?

984
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,110
You just have it.

985
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:21,450
Oh my gosh, I can destroy everything in here, too.

986
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,950
Crazy.

987
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,450
I wish there was, like, a roll.

988
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:28,310
I feel like...

989
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,010
I feel like...

990
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,290
I wish I could...

991
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,590
Go a little fast sometimes.

992
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:36,410
Yeah!

993
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,690
Destroy everything!

994
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:38,710
We hate books!

995
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,670
We hate books!

996
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,310
Nice.

997
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,570
Getting my money.

998
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:47,770
Oh!

999
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:48,650
Hello.

1000
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,790
Welcome, I just, uh...

1001
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,050
I just invited you to my home.

1002
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,230
I love destroying everything.

1003
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,630
Even though Legos is about creating, they're just like, no.

1004
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,830
Break it off.

1005
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,950
There was rare manga in that stack.

1006
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,790
Sorry, buddy, it's gotta go.

1007
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,730
Oh, even the table!

1008
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:23,930
Yeah!

1009
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:27,550
Yeah!

1010
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:28,490
Damn!

1011
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,090
Yeah!

1012
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:39,430
So destructive!

1013
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,950
Now we Lego-ing!

1014
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,230
Yeah, baby!

1015
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,810
Did I make all my money back yet?

1016
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:50,790
I don't think so.

1017
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:51,730
That's okay.

1018
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,350
I bought this guy and I don't know what he does.

1019
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,510
Why I have him.

1020
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,430
Thanks for the cafe recommendation.

1021
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,370
It gives me an excuse to go back and waste money on the Hollow Life Street Fighter Collab Creek.

1022
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,230
You're so welcome.

1023
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,430
What's in here?

1024
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,830
More money and things to destroy.

1025
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,390
It belongs in a museum.

1026
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,630
It belongs in a landfill!

1027
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,530
Secret characters.

1028
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,310
Fertilizer.

1029
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,170
Silhouettes.

1030
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:32,250
Ice rake?

1031
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,880
Are these like additions to...

1032
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,340
To the school?

1033
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,160
What kind of extras are these?

1034
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,410
I kind of want the ice rink.

1035
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,550
Those are cheats you can enable.

1036
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,630
Buy the secret characters.

1037
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,150
It's kind of pricey.

1038
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,110
Any bitchhead run?

1039
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,550
There are extras you can turn on and like...

1040
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:15,870
Oh!

1041
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,140
Oh!

1042
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,440
Well, hold on.

1043
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,080
I still want to see what else is going on here.

1044
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,300
There's the main hall.

1045
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,060
Wait, why are these shiny?

1046
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,420
Hey, hey, why are you walking around like that?

1047
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,220
Don't be so aggressive.

1048
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,440
What?

1049
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,540
Who's camping?

1050
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,420
Oh, my bad.

1051
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:52,670
Oh, sorry.

1052
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,550
Secret character unlocked Solid Snake.

1053
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,530
Don't lie to me.

1054
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,690
Do we

1055
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,660
just stuck out?

1056
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,480
Oh this looks like a movie.

1057
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,680
How cute!

1058
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,110
Oh it just plays this again.

1059
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:34,930
Okay, wait, how do I get out?

1060
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,210
Wait, oh gosh.

1061
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,070
Wait, no wait.

1062
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,790
Oh no, no, no, no.

1063
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,070
Oh my gosh, no!

1064
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,430
I can't, everyone let me out!

1065
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:54,310
Okay, I'm mashing literally everything on my controller.

1066
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:00,870
Okay, while it does this, I'm going to get some water.

1067
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,250
You guys can watch.

1068
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,810
I'm gonna get water and you guys can watch.

1069
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:06,770
Hmm?

1070
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:12,410
.

1071
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:12,730
.

1072
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:15,430
.

1073
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,750
.

1074
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,090
.

1075
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,090
.

1076
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:17,330
.

1077
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:17,810
.

1078
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:17,910
.

1079
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,260
Okay, I'm back.

1080
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,160
Sorry about that.

1081
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,340
Let's play more game.

1082
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,600
How do I get back to playing more game, though?

1083
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,540
Everybody else left the theater.

1084
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,200
So sad.

1085
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,320
Do I leave?

1086
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,800
I like that.

1087
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,680
I guess in the future, we get to sneak around a little bit.

1088
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,640
I'm excited for that.

1089
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,180
Welcome back.

1090
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:57,760
Thank you.

1091
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,540
Thank you.

1092
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:58,640
Thank you.

1093
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,800
I'm so sorry about that.

1094
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,960
Oh, here we go.

1095
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,480
I see it.

1096
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,280
I see the maps.

1097
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:11,860
Oh, oh my gosh.

1098
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,400
I can't stop.

1099
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:12,600
Okay.

1100
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,380
I gotta stop collecting money.

1101
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:15,980
Temple of Doom!

1102
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:18,940
Wait.

1103
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,400
Oh.

1104
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,140
Wait, I can do...

1105
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,760
Oh, wait.

1106
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,720
Now we have to do this one.

1107
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,000
We're already in the middle of it.

1108
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,620
Okay.

1109
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:35,350
Lost Temple and then we are going here into the mountains.

1110
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,610
Well, let me do free play so we're doing story.

1111
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,330
Who the hell is a mummy walking around?

1112
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,130
Oh, oh.

1113
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:55,270
Oh.

1114
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,410
Is this actually Harrison Ford?

1115
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,290
It's like Charlie Brown when the adults are talking to the kids.

1116
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,230
You need to watch the movies.

1117
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:33,090
No.

1118
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:36,450
I understand everything right now.

1119
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,550
I've never watched a single Indiana Jones movie.

1120
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,130
It's a...

1121
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,250
Sleepy.

1122
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,590
Oh, what a devilish little guy.

1123
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,500
Oh, oh.

1124
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,820
Oh, I like it.

1125
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,580
Oh, what?

1126
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,320
No, I was looking at your necklace.

1127
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,980
My goodness.

1128
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,320
Okay, now let's rob her blind and destroy her store.

1129
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:18,680
Her bar.

1130
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,900
Are there other guys that are supposed to be destroying her bar, though?

1131
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,640
What does this do?

1132
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,220
Oh.

1133
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,640
Oh, wow!

1134
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,340
Ladies are more nimble and can jump higher than other characters.

1135
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,100
Ooh, la-la.

1136
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,380
Oh, we're just really destroying everything.

1137
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,860
We're destroying actually everything.

1138
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,400
Is this true?

1139
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,280
I'm very nervous.

1140
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,440
It's technically true you haven't watched a single Indiana Jones movie.

1141
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,240
Wait, I don't get it.

1142
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,030
Guys, it was a joke.

1143
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,530
Of course I've watched Indiana Jones.

1144
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,750
It's like my favorite movie series.

1145

Love Indiana Jones.

1146
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,970
This is so silly.

1147
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,050
She doesn't mind that I'm like...

Oh, my depth perception strikes again, everybody.

1152
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,850
Don't mind me.

1153
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:44,970

01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:45,890

So much going on.

1158
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,260
Okay, I'm gonna build this and then I'm gonna destroy it.

1159
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,780
That's the true Lego way.

1160
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,300
Stop by and say hi.

1161
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,680
Hello.

1162
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,080
Minto time.

1163
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,180
What?

1164
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,220
What are we doing here?

1165
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,100
Okay.

1166
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,440
Not quite sure yet.

1167
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,200
Can I go through here?

1168
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:17,720
No.

1169
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,660
I want to go to the second story.

1170
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,120
Ah, I see.

1171
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:23,700
I see here.

1172
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,380
I'm a nimble lady.

1173
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,340
Nimble lady.

1174
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:34,540

Go up, go up, go up.

1178
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:43,940
She hates her.

1179
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,040
She hates this place too.

1180
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,180
She's destroying everything also.

1181
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:51,550
Alright.

1182
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:52,590

01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,020
Oh, wait.

1187
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,440
Pull it!

1188
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:08,500
Ahah!

1189
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,280
Oh!

1190
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,080
Oh!

1191
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:17,240
Oh!

1192
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:17,500

1193
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,980
Squeeze it!

1194
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:26,260
Anything else in here?

1195
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:26,560
No?

1196
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,480
Okay.

1197
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,040
No puzzle is too difficult for me!

1198
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:34,860
Wait.

1199
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,960
Let's get more cash money, baby.

1200
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,780
This game time- Oh, there he is!

1201
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,260
Hello.

1202
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,040
Oh.

1203
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,180
Yeah!

1204
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,420
Pressing B.

1205
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,180
Throw Lego objects.

1206
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,160
Oh!

1207
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:03,380
Oh!

1208
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,960
I'm gonna throw a Lego object at you.

1209
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,440
Don't mess with me.

1210
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,240
You'll get a Lego object at you.

1211
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,780
You'll get a Lego object throwing at you.

1212
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,080
Otherwise, where's her necklace?

1213
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,080
Oh, I needed that heart.

1214
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:17,900
Oh, there he is.

1215
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,970
I'm gonna throw this Lego object at you!

1216
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,980
I'm gonna throw this.

1217
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:39,460
Wait.

1218
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:45,260
Yeah!

1219
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,470
Indy does a great job at knocking them out.

1220
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,420
Boss with the machine gun appears.

1221
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,040
Throw objects at him, okay?

1222
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:56,720
Stop coming.

1223
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,260
Oh, get him now.

1224
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:00,840
Oh, wait.

1225
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:01,360
Dang it.

1226
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,080
Oops.

1227
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,440
Wrong button.

1228
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:06,580
No!

1229
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,940
I'm trying to throw objects at you!

1230
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:10,780
Oh, there he is.

1231
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:12,460
Wait.

1232
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,400
Dang it!

1233
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,100
I locked onto the wrong thing as soon as I...

1234
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,320
pressed V.

1235
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,500
Is this a boss?

1236
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,900
This is what it is.

1237
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,500
It's so funny.

1238
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,920
Oh, we got him.

1239
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:33,680
No, the necklace!

1240
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,480
Oh!

1241
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,740
The boss with the machine gun!

1242
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,420
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1243
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,100
I need heart.

1244
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:55,720
Thank you.

1245
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,860
Oh, uh, jump down, please.

1246
01:07:59,180 --> 01:07:59,720
Oh, my god.

1247
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:00,780
Give me a heart.

1248
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,280
Thank you.

1249
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:02,760
Ah!

1250
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:09,660
Ah!

1251
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,960
We took him down easy peasy, no trouble at all.

1252
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:15,920
Wait, grab the gun.

1253
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:16,540
Grab the gun.

1254
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,600
This is huge.

1255
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,260
Oh, God.

1256
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,260
What's that smell?

1257
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,990
Yeah, your ass is grass.

1258
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,270
Maybe she did like this place.

1259
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:41,520
Oh.

1260
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,140
Oh, there's more people?

1261
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,760
Oh, I was just shooting, shooting.

1262
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,630
Oh, wait, I can just...

1263
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,090
Oh.

1264
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:58,990
Wait, my gun!

1265
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,290
What happened to it?

1266
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,890
Oh, you have a gun, too.

1267
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,150
I'll take that.

1268
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:07,770
Yoink.

1269
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:14,730
Okay.

1270
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:17,330
You think I can shoot this?

1271
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:19,170
Find a way to cause an explosion.

1272
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:21,630
Wait, no.

1273
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:24,690
Oh.

1274
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,510
Wait, but there's a little laver.

1275
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:30,170
What is that, actually?

1276
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:31,650
I don't know what that is.

1277
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,050
Use the torch.

1278
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,300
Oh, my gosh, you can really just grab whatever.

1279
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,200
Oh, my gosh.

1280
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,480
Oh, hey.

1281
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,100
Hey.

1282
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,980
I like how I'm not even playing as Indy.

1283
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,460
I'm like...

1284
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,090
What am I...

1285
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:00,730
What am I building?

1286
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,590
Why is it... Oh, am I building a snowman?

1287
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,450
We have priorities.

1288
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,850
I don't stop coming, I don't stop coming.

1289
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,280
The... ow!

1290
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,980
I'm getting shot at!

1291
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,400
Indy!

1292
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,680
Indy, I'm gonna die!

1293
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:33,780
Oh, I died, Indy.

1294
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:34,380
I died.

1295
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,540
Let me grab my money.

1296
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:38,900
Oh, yay!

1297
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:39,980
Give me my money!

1298
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,420
Oh, I lost it!

1299
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,760
Indy, don't just take the shot.

1300
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,540
Putting this over here.

1301
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,800
There we go.

1302
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,120
And then grab this.

1303
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,120
And fix, fix, fix, fix, fix.

1304
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,680
My money.

1305
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:04,230
Okay.

1306
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,430
Was there anything else?

1307
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,230
I'm sure there is.

1308
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,250
Oh, yeah.

1309
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,290
Another explosion.

1310
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,370
Wait, so I could go inside someone's house?

1311
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,870
Oh, there's a golden thing in there!

1312
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:20,030
Hey, quit shooting me!

1313
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,690
Ow, it should!

1314
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,770
Oh my gosh!

1315
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:28,210
Quit shooting me!

1316
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:30,010
Gosh!

1317
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,950
Wait, why am I not even hitting?

1318
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,970
Let's get my own gun.

1319
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,110
Grab my own gun.

1320
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,250
Please, grab it.

1321
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,530
No, that's not what I wanted to do.

1322
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:44,630
Oh, what's this?

1323
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:45,830
Is this another snowman?

1324
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:51,390
Priorities?

1325
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:53,830
Wait, can I hide behind this?

1326
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,170
Why are they in the ground?

1327
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,270
Oh, so am I!

1328
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:01,110
Okay, nice.

1329
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,370
Oh, not nice.

1330
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,460
Oh, good, good, good.

1331
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,300
This is good.

1332
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,460
This is good.

1333
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,760
This is good.

1334
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,440
All right, cool.

1335
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,400
Ooh, who's that?

1336
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,100
What is this?

1337
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,640
Is this a shovel thing that we need?

1338
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,100
Shiny in the snow, yeah.

1339
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,600
I can't get it.

1340
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,240
I can jump on the animal!

1341
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,380
Indy, you handle them.

1342
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:34,980
Oh my god.

1343
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,160
Lego alpacas.

1344
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,300
They're so cute!

1345
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:49,760
Okay.

1346
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,960
Can we go in here?

1347
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,040
No, but what do we do with this?

1348
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,920
Fool guards by wearing the right hat.

1349
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,080
Oh,

1350
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:19,970
I see their hat.

1351
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,270
Mr. That was not very kind.

1352
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:27,710
What is this, anyway?

1353
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:29,450
What is this?

1354
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,470
Oh, it's a gun, I think.

1355
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,710
I need a hat.

1356
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,050
Please, sir.

1357
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:40,610
All right.

1358
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:41,430
We'll wait for them.

1359
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,790
And we'll get their hat.

1360
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:45,770
I don't know what this is.

1361
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:46,170
It won't let me.

1362
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:46,610
Let me get it.

1363
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:47,250
Oh, no.

1364
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,640
Drop your hat!

1365
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:55,540
Can I take this?

1366
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,000
No.

1367
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Wait, is this a hat?

1368
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:02,400
No.

1369
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,980
Use the torch to melt the snow.

1370
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,380
Oh, let's try.

1371
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,060
Oh.

1372
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:16,110
Oh.

1373
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:17,230
Oh.

1374
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:26,670
Oh.

1375
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:27,470
Oh.

1376
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,710
I don't think you can...

1377
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,170
Oh, sorry.

1378
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:31,050
Oh, wait.

1379
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:31,890
I'm pressing V.

1380
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:35,670
Oh, let me pick it up.

1381
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,270
Whatever it is.

1382
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:36,970
Oh, I got it.

1383
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:37,230
Okay.

1384
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,770
I don't think this is a hat, though.

1385
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,310
I'm not sure what it is.

1386
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,010
Oh, well.

1387
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:43,690
Let's just keep going.

1388
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:47,670
These guys are so annoying.

1389
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,480
They don't let you explore for any amount of time.

1390
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,070
I'm going.

1391
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,690
Oh.

1392
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,230
Oh.

1393
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:04,030
So was he?

1394
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,590
Wait, we're all going?

1395
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:06,250
Wait.

1396
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:08,810
Wait.

1397
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,570
Why are we all going?

1398
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:11,430
Wait.

1399
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,390
Oh.

1400
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,150
I'm trying to get down.

1401
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:18,650
Why?

1402
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,130
Why?

1403
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,170
There we go.

1404
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:20,590
Thank you.

1405
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:21,410
Okay.

1406
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,080
Um.

1407
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,100
What's going on?

1408
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,290
You made me lose my body.

1409
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,090
All right.

1410
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:43,630
Oh, Indy.

1411
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:47,710
Indy, it's your turn.

1412
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,250
No, don't do that.

1413
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:51,110
No.

1414
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:55,550
Ah!

1415
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:56,790
I'm not trying.

1416
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,950
It's pushing me away.

1417
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,150
I think I need to do it from here.

1418
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:00,390
There we go.

1419
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:00,790
Okay.

1420
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:01,690
I understand.

1421
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,370
I'm learning the game still, everybody.

1422
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,370
Hello?

1423
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,290
It would be really great if you fought!

1424
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:11,590
Indiana Jones!

1425
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:13,510
Oh my gosh.

1426
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,110
I'm punching, I'm punching.

1427
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:21,270
Okay, they're dead.

1428
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:21,930
We're fine.

1429
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,410
We can push Lego objects on the tile floors.

1430
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,330
Okay, we're fine.

1431
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:27,010
Everything's good.

1432
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:30,970
Everything's fine.

1433
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:33,790
Everything's good.

1434
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:34,590
I need her.

1435
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,170
Also, I need another torch.

1436
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,490
I'm coming back.

1437
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,190
Coming back.

1438
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,310
Alright, give me that.

1439
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,890
Alright, now.

1440
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:46,990
Go back.

1441
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,870
Alright.

1442
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:48,970
Where's the torch?

1443
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:49,720
Okay, there we go.

1444
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:54,700
We're fine?

1445
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,820
Oh, give me that.

1446
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,320
Okay.

1447
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,140
Here.

1448
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,070
Yeah.

1449
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,090
I'm not sure why it's not...

1450
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:10,630
Oh, there we is.

1451
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,650
Could have used the fuse.

1452
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,570
The fuse that I definitely didn't miss.

1453
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:18,250
Yeah.

1454
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:19,130
Yeah.

1455
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,190
Yeah.

1456
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:23,030
Yeah.

1457
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:28,450
A fuse that I completely saw.

1458
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:29,630
That fuse.

1459
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:32,830
Classic Minkeana Jones.

1460
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,590
What can I say?

1461
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,450
Wait, hold on.

1462
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:39,510
Alright, push.

1463
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,090
Push.

1464
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,710
Watch out, Indy!

1465
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,190
Oh, just kidding.

1466
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:50,990
How do we get this one though?

1467
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,670
Where'd the torch go?

1468
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:58,390
Minkiana.

1469
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,390
All right, take this.

1470
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:04,530
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1471
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,390
Throw.

1472
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,390
Just kidding.

1473
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:12,630
Grab.

1474
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:15,230
Throw.

1475
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:16,770
Wait.

1476
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,930
Take it out.

1477
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:19,350
Throw.

1478
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,640
Oh.

1479
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,390
Oh, it needs more!

1480
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:35,350
I see.

1481
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:36,750
I see.

1482
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:38,330
I see.

1483
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:39,790
Alright.

1484
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:42,210
Wait, where'd my torch go?

1485
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,810
I'll have to go get another one.

1486
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:48,970
Okay.

1487
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:52,610
And then we'll blow it up.

1488
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,790
We'll blow it all the hell!

1489
01:18:59,420 --> 01:18:59,980
Run!

1490
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,070
Yahoo!

1491
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:15,830
Oh, only small characters can fit through hatches.

1492
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:18,690
Like a mouse?

1493
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,970
Which movie is this?

1494
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,030
Um, the...

1495
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:24,790
All of them.

1496
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,540
What's going on here?

1497
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,320
What we got?

1498
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:33,860
Ah!

1499
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,340
Oh, I hate that we drop money sometimes.

1500
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,460
Oh, but she's not even picking it up!

1501
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:41,760
Ma'am!

1502
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,080
Okay.

1503
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,700
Wait, why aren't you... Why am I not picking it up?

1504
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,140
I'm on the first movie.

1505
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,340
I'm on all of them.

1506
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:52,360
Wait!

1507
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,980
I guess I have to jump for it, huh?

1508
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,780
But like, each time?

1509
01:19:59,380 --> 01:19:59,820
Okay.

1510
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:00,740
Cool.

1511
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,800
No, we're going on this side, lady.

1512
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:08,760
Okay.

1513
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,920
I see, I see.

1514
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,020
Uh-huh.

1515
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:15,360
Alright.

1516
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:17,720
Jump.

1517
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,000
Yes.

1518
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,660
What is this thing?

1519
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,000
You gotta jump.

1520
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,100
Ah, you should just be able to get it from just walking over it.

1521
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,460
I think.

1522
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,100
Alright, let's go get this.

1523
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,380
What is this anyway?

1524
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,280
Aha.

1525
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:40,940
Oh-ho-ho.

1526
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,980
I don't remember this part being so long in the movie.

1527
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,140
You know?

1528
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,000
Wait, where does this go?

1529
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,580
Oh, this continues onwards.

1530
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,820
No, no, no, not yet.

1531
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,080
Wait.

1532
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,080
Am I dumb?

1533
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,500
How do I get up there?

1534
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:11,820
I'm back from Silk Song with the promised milk in Gamer's hand.

1535
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,440
How's it going?

1536
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:14,880
We're going.

1537
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,340
Okay.

1538
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,900
Okay, hold on.

1539
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:19,740
Maybe I...

1540
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:19,900
Hoi!

1541
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,140
No?

1542
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:23,960
Oh!

1543
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,960
Just use your use your little Lego hands!

1544
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,480
And hoi!

1545
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,180
Hoi!

1546
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:32,380
Oh!

1547
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:33,900
Oh!

1548
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:39,770
Oh!

1549
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,570
I don't know why I can make it up here.

1550
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,240
We're gaming.

1551
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:52,680
Okay.

1552
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:56,200
Yippee!

1553
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,640
It wasn't even that much.

1554
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,020
You can double jump.

1555
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:12,160
Oh, like the thing that I'm trying to do, that like, if I press A again, it doesn't work.

1556
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:18,960
That thing that you say I can do, but literally when I try, it doesn't do that.

1557
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,150
What the?

1558
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,850
Oh my god, where'd you guys come from?

1559
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,740
Um, Indy, I need you to finish- oh.

1560
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,920
Oh my god!

1561
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:39,700
Why didn't you finish him off?

1562
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,040
Taking this big guy.

1563
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,340
I wonder.

1564
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,240
Oh, Indy can only, like, dive.

1565
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,780
It's not even a double jump.

1566
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,700
It's a double- what is it?

1567
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,240
He's like, he's doing something.

1568
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:56,680
Where does this go?

1569
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,800
Oh, here.

1570
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,180
Okay.

1571
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,680
Oh, it's the platform, that's why.

1572
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:07,600
What's happening?

1573
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:09,300
Oh!

1574
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,520
It's fine, we're gamers.

1575
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,660
Oh my gosh.

1576
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:18,970
Uh-huh.

1577
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:20,770
Okay.

1578
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:25,870
We're fine.

1579
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:26,890
Everything's okay.

1580
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:27,670
Maybe.

1581
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:29,710
Oh, oh.

1582
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:30,670
There's stuff here.

1583
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:32,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1584
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,170
Oh!

1585
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,110
Wait, hold on.

1586
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:36,130
Swing!

1587
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:37,090
Swing!

1588
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:38,450
Swing!

1589
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:39,510
Swing!

1590
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,830
He is dodge rolling souls type.

1591
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,230
Who's in there, by the way?

1592
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:49,330
There's like someone freezing in there.

1593
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:50,850
Okay.

1594
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,290
Maybe?

1595
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:54,790
Just a little bit.

1596
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:57,610
Just a little bit of...

1597
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:00,430
Oh!

1598
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:01,730
I made it!

1599
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,150
Oh, wait, it's sealed or something.

1600
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,830
Wait.

1601
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,030
Oh my god!

1602
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,490
They're amongst the skellies!

1603
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:10,630
So cute!

1604
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,610
She doesn't know...

1605
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,110
I don't know which way I'm supposed to go.

1606
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:24,910
No, no, no.

1607
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:25,890
Not yet.

1608
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,430
Let's go see the person first.

1609
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:27,710
Okay.

1610
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:28,570
We'll go down.

1611
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:36,690
We're going down, bam!

1612
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:38,590
It's a Star Wars reference.

1613
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,310
Oh, is it actually?

1614
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,630
No wonder I wouldn't get it.

1615
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:41,990
Wait!

1616
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,090
I'll get you out of there!

1617
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:46,310
Oh, I actually can't go in.

1618
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:51,470
Wait, that's a Star Wars guy?

1619
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:01,130
Got a torch.

1620
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:01,590
Okay.

1621
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:03,370
We can do that.

1622
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:05,630
Well, torch actually work, though.

1623
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:07,730
I guess we'll find out.

1624
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,270
Is there one over here?

1625
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:10,850
Maybe in here?

1626
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:16,970
I like the little children's playset that we have going on here.

1627
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,430
Okay.

1628
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:23,430
Wow!

1629
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:24,710
Woo!

1630
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:31,630
Wow!

1631
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,790
Wait, can she jump up there?

1632
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,290
Good job!

1633
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:39,350
Oh, wait.

1634
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:40,450
She could get this.

1635
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:41,370
I know she can.

1636
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,090
Um...

1637
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:46,490
Okay, there's a lot going on here.

1638
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:46,990
Let's see.

1639
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:50,330
This...

1640
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:51,550
Oh, gives us the shovel!

1641
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,130
Okay.

1642
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:58,690
You take the shovel.

1643
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:00,490
Minkiana Jones.

1644
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:07,230
Star Wars original trilogy watch- I know, I need to watch them.

1645
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,670
Oops.

1646
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,030
Go in.

1647
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,800
And that's why I couldn't grab it before.

1648
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:21,920
Oh, oops.

1649
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,140
There we go.

1650
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:27,620
Oi!

1651
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,120
Nice.

1652
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:30,660
Oi!

1653
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,120
I'm a platform gamer, everybody!

1654
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,440
Which way do I need to push it to, though?

1655
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:45,540
Doesn't matter.

1656
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,600
It looks so heavy, but it is actually so light.

1657
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,400
Hmm.

1658
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,580
Wait, maybe we push it to this side so that she can jump?

1659
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:01,800
Is it a platform?

1660
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:03,740
Oh, wait.

1661
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,860
Oh, it is a platform for something.

1662
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:10,970
I'm...

1663
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:13,230
Orange Lego Place can be activated with extra weight.

1664
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:14,950
I see.

1665
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,750
Looks like Mothman.

1666
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:20,790
Glad he's frozen in there and we're out here.

1667
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:22,350
And he is the Star Wars.

1668
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:23,790
And that we are frozen out there.

1669
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,070
We're in here.

1670
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,810
And I just remembered we're out there.

1671
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:28,750
Thank you, Fred.

1672
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:33,900
Oh, wait.

1673
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:34,660
I think I get it.

1674
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,320
Okay, okay, okay.

1675
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,440
Um, okay, hold on.

1676
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,920
I need to go back up here, and somebody stands on it.

1677
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,840
AKA, her.

1678
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,120
And then, Indy pushes it.

1679
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:50,400
No.

1680
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,200
No!

1681
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:52,780
Oh, gosh, but wait!

1682
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,160
They follow each other.

1683
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,200
Um.

1684
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:02,460
Oh, wait.

1685
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,220
Okay, okay, okay.

1686
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:03,640
Okay.

1687
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:11,810
Yes, I know.

1688
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:16,590
Oh!

1689
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:19,510
The AI is good.

1690
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:21,530
The AI worked.

1691
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:21,970
Okay.

1692
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:22,970
All right.

1693
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:25,310
We're building.

1694
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,570
Aha!

1695
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,570
No, no, the money!

1696
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:29,110
The money!

1697
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,790
The money!

1698
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:30,150
The money!

1699
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:31,590
The money!

1700
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:32,290
The money!

1701
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,230
No, grab the money!

1702
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:35,370
Grab the money!

1703
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,250
Anyway, okay.

1704
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:41,430
Onwards?

1705
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:45,130
Onwards and upwards?

1706
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:48,070
My money!

1707
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:49,630
I am greedy.

1708
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:53,970
I'm greedy.

1709
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,230
I want it all.

1710
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,190
I want it all.

1711
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:58,650
Oh, wait.

1712
01:28:58,730 --> 01:28:59,310
Here's a torch.

1713
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:01,410
Okay, now we can...

1714
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,350
Oh, what's this?

1715
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:05,230
We can grab...

1716
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:06,290
True adventurer!

1717
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,850
We can grab this and go.

1718
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:17,750
back to oops back wait, do I still have it?

1719
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:32,110
okay, I do okay okay ma'am excuse me okay, back to Star Wars land

1720
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:44,750
okay, okay Star Wars Star Wars, Star Wars Star Wars Okay.

1721
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,520
Okay, back, back, back.

1722
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:50,870
Nice grab.

1723
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:53,430
Wait, my toe!

1724
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:53,970
No!

1725
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,670
I dropped it!

1726
01:29:58,670 --> 01:29:59,770
When did I drop it?

1727
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,090
It ran out.

1728
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:05,550
Wait, does it actually run out?

1729
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,530
Is it, like, a timed thing?

1730
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,590
It has a time limit.

1731
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,010
I wonder.

1732
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:17,030
if going this way would be better.

1733
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:19,510
Maybe there's one over here instead.

1734
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:20,950
Let's see.

1735
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:29,700
Uh.

1736
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,510
Uh.

1737
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:39,430
This also feels really far.

1738
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,790
This is also really far.

1739
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,390
No, there's no way.

1740
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:47,430
Oh, man.

1741
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:55,750
There's nothing here, but What is this light then, huh?

1742
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,140
Gotta go fast.

1743
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,160
Like the fastest.

1744
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,400
But I also want the treasure chest here.

1745
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,480
I think I need...

1746
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,100
I'm actually not sure, but I think I need to defrost that too.

1747
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:24,420
I would recommend watching the first six movies in this order.

1748
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,080
I think I'll watch and release.

1749
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,680
Guys, I think I give up.

1750
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,860
I think I give up on saving that guy.

1751
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,000
He can rot in hell.

1752
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,380
And what's this?

1753
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,460
You need a book to translate mysterious hieroglyphs.

1754
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,040
I am Indiana Jones.

1755
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,540
I need a book?

1756
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,700
The book is my brain.

1757
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:17,110
Too fast, too minky.

1758
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:21,970
Oh, apples.

1759
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:28,580
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:30,900
Oh, what's this?

1761
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:32,820
What is this?

1762
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,740
Um, it is for...

1763
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,360
Uh...

1764
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,980
Oh, I thought that was a dog.

1765
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:44,860
It's for...

1766
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:45,740
The...

1767
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:46,860
Truck.

1768
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,420
Yes.

1769
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:50,440
Oh.

1770
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:51,860
Oh, I'm greedy.

1771
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:54,800
Oh!

1772
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,320
Okay.

1773
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:01,600
What is it?

1774
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:02,020
What are you?

1775
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:03,380
Why are you shining?

1776
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,180
Okay, let's look around some more.

1777
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:09,900
Let's look around a bit.

1778
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:14,210
Yes!

1779
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,610
One moment, please.

1780
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:20,630
What's this?

1781
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:23,570
The thing I can destroy?

1782
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:24,130
No!

1783
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:24,410
No!

1784
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:27,250
Yeah, I can destroy this.

1785
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,130
Silver items go boom.

1786
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:31,610
That's right.

1787
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,350
They go boom.

1788
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:41,190
You think player two is ever gonna start the game?

1789
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:42,510
Lazy?

1790
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,690
What's this?

1791
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:52,590
Hmm.

1792
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:57,230
I'm doing, I'm pulling all the work here.

1793
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:01,010
My controller isn't working?

1794
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,190
Yeah, likely excuse.

1795
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:07,550
You just know that I'm so good at the game.

1796
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,430
You would be embarrassed.

1797
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:16,090
Come on, it's just Legos.

1798
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:18,250
You can do it.

1799
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:19,830
They're just Legos.

1800
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:23,370
Wait, there is a purple one over there.

1801
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:24,730
Oh, all right, lady.

1802
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:27,010
I can't remember her name.

1803
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:27,970
I feel terrible.

1804
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:29,630
Oh, gosh.

1805
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:30,330
Oh, gosh.

1806
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:33,830
Oh, I didn't even see this.

1807
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:34,610
Hello?

1808
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:35,270
Move?

1809
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:36,250
Move?

1810
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:38,590
Nice.

1811
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,570
Ooh, big money!

1812
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:48,440
Marion.

1813
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:50,060
Yes, Marion.

1814
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:50,640
Thank you.

1815
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,120
I'm so bad with names, everybody.

1816
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,900
I think you guys know this by now, though.

1817
01:34:54,120 --> 01:35:00,580
If you know me, you might know that I'm not very good with names.

1818
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,680
It's a character flaw.

1819
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:12,340
Ah,

1820
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:18,950
no, you can't jump.

1821
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:20,730
Wait, jump, jump.

1822
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:23,010
Yeah, baby.

1823
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:26,130
We know, Dennis.

1824
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:30,630
Okay.

1825
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:33,310
What do I do with...

1826
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:33,990
What is this?

1827
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:34,910
I can't even tell.

1828
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,290
I think it goes to the top.

1829
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:40,590

1830
01:35:45,130 --> 01:36:16,190

There we go.

1833
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:20,730
Oh, yeah, we got a bigger gun.

1834
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:24,890
Oh, wait, this is an exploding gun?

1835
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:26,150
Okay, wait.

1836
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:30,690
Oh, come on.

1837
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:31,450
Wait, really?

1838
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:38,810
Well, maybe this blows up this thing over here, then.

1839
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,280
Yes.

1840
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:47,240
Yes.

1841
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,360
Yes.

1842
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,140
Yes!

1843
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,020
You can operate spinners by pushing against the green and red paddles.

1844
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,500
Oh, how cute!

1845
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:56,760
Oh.

1846
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,200
Wait, who are you?

1847
01:36:59,300 --> 01:36:59,480
Ah!

1848
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,150
Take their guns?

1849
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:16,930
More!

1850
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:18,790
Oh my gosh.

1851
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,190
Okay.

1852
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:23,230
Alright, we gotta do this like fast then, huh?

1853
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:24,030
What is this?

1854
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:26,370
Can you take it, please?

1855
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:28,570
Oh, it's another one.

1856
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,090
Why are you giving this to me?

1857
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:34,590
The llama is so annoying.

1858
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:37,710
Oh, it's just working on its own now.

1859
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:39,510
We...

1860
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:41,910
Oh no, I lost my wrench though.

1861
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:45,170
Oh wait, Indy has it.

1862
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:49,430
Indy.

1863
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:50,450
Oh, he's...

1864
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:51,710
Okay, wait, she's...

1865
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:52,010
Ah!

1866
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:55,070
I blew up.

1867
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:57,650
Don't mind me.

1868
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,230
My money, my money!

1869
01:37:59,830 --> 01:37:59,950
Okay.

1870
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:02,770
All right.

1871
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:04,130
All right.

1872
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,080
Indy, Indy, come here.

1873
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:07,220
Right.

1874
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,160
Indy, come here.

1875
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:08,760
Yeah, yeah.

1876
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:09,560
Indy, come here.

1877
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:09,880
Okay.

1878
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:10,840
Indy, come here.

1879
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:11,320
All right.

1880
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,160
Fix this.

1881
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,180
Everyone died.

1882
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:17,340
We bazookaed everybody in the face.

1883
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,600
Now what?

1884
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,060
Ah!

1885
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:25,560
Stop.

1886
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:26,320
Stop.

1887
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:26,820
Stop.

1888
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:27,820
Heading me.

1889
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,160
Who are you people?

1890
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,380
What was the point of this?

1891
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,120
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

1892
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:41,880
What is this thing?

1893
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,460
Do you know?

1894
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,280
What is this thing?

1895
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,700
Is this a crank?

1896
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,680
Wait, there's a...

1897
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:52,880
Hmm.

1898
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,090
That wasn't paying attention, guys.

1899
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:04,770
My money, my money, my money, my money!

1900
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:09,450
Look at they got little smiles on their faces.

1901
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:13,450
Take it.

1902
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:14,510
Take it.

1903
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:15,190
Take it.

1904
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:15,870
Take it.

1905
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:16,530
Take it.

1906
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:23,350
Wait, is this the... Does this go to that over there?

1907
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:26,110
Okay, Marion, I'm gonna need you to cover me, okay?

1908
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:27,490
Marion, cover me.

1909
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:28,750
Marion, cover me.

1910
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:29,250
Yeah, yeah.

1911
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:31,430
Marion, cover me.

1912
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,870
Marion, take care of them.

1913
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,250
Marion, do it.

1914
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,790
Yeah, yeah.

1915
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,350
Cover me.

1916
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:36,530
Can't cover me!

1917
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:36,970
Various!

1918
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:37,510
Various!

1919
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:38,130
Cover me!

1920
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,570
Ah!

1921
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:41,310
I died again!

1922
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:46,570
I lose all my body!

1923
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,820
It wasn't even what I needed.

1924
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:57,660
It was a bonus.

1925
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,260
Okay, let's get on the...

1926
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,120
Let's get on this guy.

1927
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:03,860
Artifact again.

1928
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,500
Well, I actually don't think this guy is any much faster than...

1929
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,110
What exploded?

1930
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:14,930
Oh, sorry, Indy.

1931
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,390
Can we just get in the car now?

1932
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:22,630
Can we leave?

1933
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:25,370
Can we...

1934
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:27,210
Wait, I'm actually...

1935
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,290
I don't know what to do.

1936
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:32,150
I thought we got in the truck and left.

1937
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:42,850
Oh, the truck is silver!

1938
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:43,690
Ah!

1939
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:46,090
I see, I see.

1940
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:46,550
Grab.

1941
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:48,090
Oh, thank you.

1942
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,290
And bazooka!

1943
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:51,610
Bazooka!

1944
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:53,550
Me too.

1945
01:40:57,770 --> 01:41:02,670
Wait, do I bazooka it again?

1946
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:07,310
Oh, take it and...

1947
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:08,230
Bazooka!

1948
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:10,650
Yes!

1949
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,390
Oh, there we go, there we go!

1950
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:13,330
It's on fire!

1951
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:14,550
Bazooka!

1952
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:19,890
Oh, I keep getting myself too!

1953
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:23,050
We're fine.

1954
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:24,050
Maybe.

1955
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:28,910
Actually me.

1956
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:34,570
Why is there splashback in this children's Indiana Jones game?

1957
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,390
Now we just have 50k.

1958
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:40,130
I know!

1959
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:42,790
Oh, yay!

1960
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,540
Marion.

1961
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:00,110
Okay, I think I got my money back.

1962
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:03,110
God, the sound is terrifying.

1963
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:08,960
Okay, just kidding.

1964
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:10,220
We have, like, way money.

1965
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,780
I'm going to go unlock everything.

1966
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,140
Wait, let's go unlock everything.

1967
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:23,640
The sound is so broken.

1968
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,280
It's, like, does it all at once?

1969
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,020
So it's just crazy loud.

1970
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:27,620
Just prrr.

1971
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,270
Okay.

1972
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:36,310
What is this?

1973
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:37,150
This is math?

1974
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:38,870
Oh, classroom.

1975
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:56,650
How do I activate it?

1976
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:58,190
How do I put in a cheat code?

1977
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:00,770
No?

1978
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,690
Oh, there we go.

1979
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:31,800
8008.

1980
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,200
Okay, you're so right.

1981
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:56,990
But you could just put the letters.

1982
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,930
This is more fun this way.

1983
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:00,430
Oh, sorry, everybody.

1984
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,630
You are not learning today.

1985
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:02,990
Not on my watch.

1986
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,880
No seats allowed.

1987
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:09,040
No sitting allowed.

1988
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,520
No living either.

1989
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:13,040
Okay, anyway.

1990
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,720
I don't think I went into there before.

1991
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:16,820
This was...

1992
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:17,320
What room?

1993
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,060
Here we go.

1994
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:21,880
Oh, wait.

1995
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,060
There's so much...

1996
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,460
Bazooka trooper.

1997
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,040
Wait, there's actually...

1998
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:27,960
Wait.

1999
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,040
Oh, this is just buying the characters.

2000
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:37,120
Do we want to buy more characters or do we want to buy more cheats?

2001
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:41,240
They are expensive.

2002
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,340
I know that's why I don't want to lose money.

2003
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,200
Was it this room?

2004
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:46,900
Yes.

2005
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:51,660
Secret characters.

2006
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:54,180
Disguises.

2007
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,040
Fertilizers.

2008
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:58,820
or...

2009
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:59,880
Silhouettes.

2010
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:01,940
Beep beep!

2011
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:03,940
Ice rank!

2012
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,320
Yeah, I've got everything!

2013
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,240
Beep beep!

2014
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,120
Beep beep!

2015
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,800
I don't know what it does, but...

2016
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:23,660
we got it.

2017
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,020
Turn them on in the pause menu.

2018
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,340
Like extras?

2019
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:31,320
On.

2020
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:33,060
On.

2021
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,200
Adaptive difficulty.

2022
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,120
This guy on.

2023
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:37,660
On.

2024
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:41,420
Oh.

2025
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:45,880
Oh.

2026
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:46,680
Oh.

2027
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,140
Wait that.

2028
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,440

Not even the monkey!

2033
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:40,880
Oh,

2034
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:49,650
it's so silly.

2035
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:53,030
It's okay, that monkey's gonna die later.

2036
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,130
Guys, he's bad, it's fine.

2037
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:09,690
He's a bad guy.

2038
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:11,790
Oh, throw a banana.

2039
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:12,630
Okay.

Jeez, it's violent.

2043
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:24,450
So violent.

2044
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:32,560
The bad dates, yeah.

2045
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:33,840
Oh, sorry.

2046
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:34,700
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2047
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,360
Oh, no, I didn't know that.

2048
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:39,620
Being violent actually had consequences.

2049
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:40,740
I'm sorry.

2050
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:42,540
Sorry, I'm a good fellow.

Believe me, believe me.

2055
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,780
I'm getting my ass handed to me.

2056
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:00,040
Um, what's this?

2057
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,120
Oh, we need to fix it.

2058
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:08,160
You think they'll be...

2059
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,340
They hate me for now on forever?

2060
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,800
That would be really sad, huh?

2061
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,400
Actions have consequences.

2062
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,680
I just like to beat stuff up.

2063
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,380
I just like to beat...

2064
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,660
to punch everything.

2065
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:27,580
Okay.

2066
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:28,340
We're good now.

2067
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:28,640
We're good.

2068
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,120
We're chill.

2069
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,520
Oh, no, we're not chill.

2070
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,080
We're not chill.

2071
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,480
This guy has a sword and is coming at me!

2072
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:43,810
I'll take that.

2073
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,910
Give me the sword.

2074
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:45,470
Yeah.

2075
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:47,190
Yeah!

2076
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:49,330
Yeah!

2077
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:54,190
Is this because I did, I messed up?

2078
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:55,950
Or...

2079
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:58,250
Are they mad at me?

2080
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,740
Oh, we can build apples.

2081
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:16,570
Can I have that back?

2082
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:18,490
Can I have your sword back, please?

2083
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,370
Oh, wait.

2084
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:20,210
I'll take this, too.

2085
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:22,030
This also works.

2086
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:29,920
I killed!

2087
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:30,880
Use the banana.

2088
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:31,980
Throw the banana at them.

2089
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:32,440
So true.

2090
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:34,660
Wait, is this not a digging spot?

2091
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:35,740
Oh, yes, it is.

2092
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:41,670

2103
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,920
Is it because you're so nimble?

The music's up.

2109
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:55,380
Everything explodes.

Alright, here we go.

2149
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:02,000

2151
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:03,940
Hello.

Hi.

2153
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:06,700
Hello.

01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:09,320
No?

2155
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:16,910
Oh, we're back to normal now.

2156
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:18,750
Everything's fine.

2157
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:20,670
No hat.

2158
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:21,830
No hat.

2159
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:23,950
Oh.

2160
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:25,790
Oh my gosh.

2161
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:26,590
Oh, so close.

2162
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:29,450
Okay.

2163
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:33,250
I guess I could have just jumped on this, huh?

2164
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:38,510
Dude, I was, like, making it more difficult for myself.

2165
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:41,310
Grab, grab it.

2166
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:42,830
Grab the money.

2167
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:44,150
Grab the money.

2168
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:45,490
Grab the money.

2169
01:54:45,610 --> 01:54:47,530
Whatever you do, Marion, grab the money.

2170
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:54,110
If everyone's in disguise, no one is.

2171
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:54,810
You're right.

2172
01:54:57,990 --> 01:54:59,950
How do I get a hat though?

2173
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:03,250
Okay, but first, hold on.

2174
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:04,950
There's some other things I want to do over here.

2175
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:07,230
Oh wait, we need another...

2176
01:55:08,890 --> 01:55:09,830
Wait, what's in here?

2177
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:12,850
Uh, oh.

2178
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:18,410
Don't kill me!

2179
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:25,330
There's a lot going on over here.

2180
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:29,090
Game says I'm about to die.

2181
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:33,310
Oh.

2182
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:34,370
Okay.

2183
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:36,310
Thanks for doing that.

2184
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:40,450
They're like, hey, do you want to throw away your sword and, like, not use it anymore?

2185
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:47,760
Shirley.

2186
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:51,100
Wait.

2187
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:52,220
Shirley.

2188
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:56,980
Give me that.

2189
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:58,880
Thank you.

2190
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,220
Oh, this is a digging spot.

2191
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,120
I'm dumb.

2192
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:05,260
Okay, now pull.

2193
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,020
No, pull.

2194
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:10,500
This is a pulley, you know?

2195
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:11,690
You pull it.

2196
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:12,930
Pull it.

2197
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:24,720
Oh my goodness!

2198
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:28,140
She did the thing!

2199
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,560
Wait, am I dumb?

2200
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,810
I know, I mean, I am, but like, also...

2201
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:40,660
Impedious.

2202
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:41,920
Why is it not working?

2203
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,380
What's going on?

2204
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,380
Indie you, beast?

2205
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,900
Jump from the stairs.

2206
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:54,380
Like here?

2207
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,000
Oh, a monkey.

2208
01:56:58,460 --> 01:56:59,660
I thought this was a lever, though.

2209
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:00,080
It's not.

2210
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,220
What was the point of attaching it?

2211
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:04,640
You can break this fence.

2212
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:07,800
Ah!

2213
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,160
Ah!

2214
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:10,240
Oh!

2215
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,220
Oh my gosh!

2216
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:13,140
Okay, now...

2217
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:14,200
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2218
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:15,920
Okay, okay, okay.

2219
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,660
I'm learning how this world works.

2220
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:20,040
Slowly but surely.

2221
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,440
Slowly but surely.

2222
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,020
Oh, hello.

2223
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,000
I'm learning how this world works.

2224
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,220
What's in here?

2225
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,220
Why is it like that?

2226
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:32,980
Oops.

2227
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,460
Break everything.

2228
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,880
Yeah, oh my gosh.

2229
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:37,840
They're not kidding.

2230
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:40,760
Oh, look.

2231
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:42,400
Okay, and then this is the other piece that we needed.

2232
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:43,020
Oops.

2233
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:44,440
Just kidding.

2234
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,100
There we go.

2235
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:48,920
Oh, dang it.

2236
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,780
Sometimes she bounces high and sometimes...

2237
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:55,140
Not at all.

2238
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:56,300
Okay.

2239
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,560
How do I get in there?

2240
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,750
Oh, nice.

2241
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:06,650
It's not...

2242
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:08,510
Let's go.

2243
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,630
Come on, Mary!

2244
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:16,010
Ah, there we go.

2245
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:16,430
Okay, okay.

2246
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,390
Okay.

2247
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:22,610
Um, there's even more, maybe?

2248
01:58:24,670 --> 01:58:25,490
Oops, okay.

2249
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:28,110
We'll make it, we'll make it.

2250
01:58:29,810 --> 01:58:31,230
Welcome to Lego World.

2251
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:33,170
I'm learning!

2252
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:34,570
Oh.

2253
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:41,890
Depth perception is a skill.

2254
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,580
I don't think I actually need to...

2255
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:53,120
I think I'll...

2256
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:54,480
I have to do is hold it.

2257
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:02,910
Yeah, I don't even need to time it.

2258
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:04,350
I just have to hold it.

2259
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:05,810
Okay, that's way easier.

2260
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:14,570
Wonder how you can break that glass door thing.

2261
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:15,570
I don't know.

2262
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:19,290
Hmm.

2263
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:23,250
And then also here.

2264
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:25,430
Like, what are these?

2265
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:27,270
They're shining, so they must mean something.

2266
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:27,910
Something.

2267
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,970
But I do not know what.

2268
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:31,710
Hmm.

2269
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:32,610
Okay.

2270
01:59:35,150 --> 01:59:36,710
We continue onwards.

2271
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:48,440
There was also another place that I walked into.

2272
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:53,880
I probably should go back and check it out.

2273
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:58,080
Biggest Lego set I ever built was a 4,000 piece Technic bucket.

2274
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,220
Oh.

2275
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:00,700
Mine!

2276
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:03,180
No, this is not.

2277
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,920
Wait, there was another place that I saw.

2278
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:07,460
Oh, there's more here.

2279
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:11,680
Yes.

2280
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:12,860
Yes.

2281
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:14,300
You know what?

2282
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,620
I'm gonna break all this stuff too.

2283
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,180
Yes, break, break, break, break!

2284
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,440
Give me something to break!

2285
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:23,040
Sorry, Indy.

2286
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:23,840
Indy, please move.

2287
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:31,670
Where was it?

2288
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:36,050
Dig those pieces up with the shovel.

2289
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:36,750
What pieces?

2290
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:42,050
Wait, so since I put these together, do I just break them again?

2291
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:44,610
No, it won't let me.

2292
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:46,490
That'd be funny, though.

2293
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:52,350
There was a room that I went through.

2294
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:53,330
Am I crazy?

2295
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:58,050
Under the monkey.

2296
02:00:58,050 --> 02:00:58,190
Under the monkey.

2297
02:00:59,870 --> 02:01:00,130
Oh, wait.

2298
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:02,470
I went in here.

2299
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:03,310
That's right.

2300
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:04,390
Yes.

2301
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:05,750
I did.

2302
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:06,070
Okay.

2303
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:09,350
Oh, this is where I came from.

2304
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:12,050
I'm all lost.

2305
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:13,250
I'm all backwards.

2306
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:20,000
Yeah, I was the star.

2307
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:21,260
Okay.

2308
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,000
Onwards!

2309
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,840
Yes, everything's fine.

2310
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:32,340
Yes.

2311
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:33,240
No.

2312
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:34,660
No.

2313
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:36,220
Nothing bad here.

2314
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:37,040
Yes.

2315
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,960
Only small characters can fit through hatches.

2316
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:49,420
Godzilla.

2317
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:57,320
I'm like walking on top of things just destroying, crashing them.

2318
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:01,220
Like I

2319
02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:13,350
guess everybody doesn't care if I'm beating up their stuff.

2320
02:02:15,610 --> 02:02:16,690
I hear a camel.

2321
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:18,090
Oh gosh.

2322
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:21,790
The camel's kind of frightening.

2323
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:27,350
Are you guys attacking me, or what's going on?

2324
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:31,630
Oh, someone was having a nice dinner here.

2325
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:37,950
Oh, Marianne, you handle that, and I'll take care of...

2326
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:39,250
Oh, never mind, you shot me.

2327
02:02:41,730 --> 02:02:43,730
Oh my god, the camel's attack!

2328
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:48,940
Let me grab that.

2329
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,720
Oh, I gave him a nookie.

2330
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:02,360
Before I literally destroyed his body.

2331
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:23,900
The brutal It's kind of, you know Oh, he's cute Oh, he's cute Oh, oh, he's a Oh, son of a The money

2332
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:46,610
The money Okay, so that can be pushed Got it Son of a brick Oh, my gosh The characters in this game really don't let up.

2333
02:03:46,830 --> 02:03:47,650
It's kind of insane.

2334
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:51,310
Like, you get...

2335
02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:55,650
You know me, I like to take my time and explore and... But they're like, no.

2336
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:57,770
You're gonna... You're gonna keep going.

2337
02:03:58,570 --> 02:03:59,730
Okay, I get it.

2338
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:00,190
Oh.

2339
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:01,690
Oh.

2340
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:02,150
Oh.

2341
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:02,870
Guys?

2342
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:03,630
Oh.

2343
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:06,970
Game?

2344
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:08,970
Are we okay?

2345
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:14,430
Maybe that's what the adaptive difficulty is for.

2346
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:14,890
Maybe.

2347
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:15,950
Okay.

2348
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:18,510
That was kind of spooky, huh?

2349
02:04:20,490 --> 02:04:21,330
I

2350
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:34,040
just want to keep running around and destroying things and taking money.

2351
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:40,020
I want to become big adventurer mode.

2352
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:45,100
Oh my god, shut up, camel.

2353
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:48,400
Oh,

2354
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:52,620
I'm shooting.

2355
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:04,300
Got his butt.

2356
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:08,560
Oh, this is explosive, but I don't think I have anything that could explode.

2357
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:09,880
Should I see anything?

2358
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,640
No, I don't think so.

2359
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:14,400
Let's try the other side.

2360
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:19,700
Oh, wait, wait.

2361
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:24,780
Hmm.

2362
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:25,620
Dropped?

2363
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:27,800
Oh, well.

2364
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:29,300
Oh, wait.

2365
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:31,180
I think I wonder if Marian...

2366
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:31,200
Oh, wait.

2367
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:31,760
Ah, it's fine.

2368
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,620
Let's just keep going because they keep spawning.

2369
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:35,720
Oh, wait.

2370
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:37,480
We need to get rid of that thing first.

2371
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,460
Wait, can we?

2372
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:45,880
Can we get rid of it?

2373
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:50,240
Hmm.

2374
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:51,980
Serious.

2375
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:53,080
You can pull, too?

2376
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,620
Oh, I can.

2377
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,420
Oh, I didn't realize.

2378
02:05:58,920 --> 02:05:58,920
Okay.

2379
02:05:59,580 --> 02:05:59,980
Nice.

2380
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:03,220
Look at these little Lego pieces.

2381
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:06,120
How fun.

2382
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:06,780
Ah!

2383
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:14,670
I have a sword!

2384
02:06:25,630 --> 02:06:26,390
Very good.

2385
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:28,310
Very good.

2386
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:29,350
They're like, you want to throw this?

2387
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:30,410
You want to get rid of this thing?

2388
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:31,710
No, I like it.

2389
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:32,630
It's my sword.

2390
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:33,730
Ah!

2391
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:43,310
Marion, don't turn your back on me.

2392
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:47,430
These guys, we're in here waiting for an ambush.

2393
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:50,850
Lore, accurate.

2394
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:56,130
Just like the movie.

2395
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:09,490
It's like when you're in a game and someone picks up like a wrench, like a horror game, and you're like, oh, this would be incredibly useful to keep around for...

2396
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:10,970
Oh, I knew that was going to happen.

2397
02:07:12,790 --> 02:07:17,400
This is incredibly useful to hold up, have on hand.

2398
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:21,860
And then the protagonist is like, I used it on this one door.

2399
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:27,260
We're zigzagging.

2400
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:28,920
Click every piece of loot.

2401
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:30,520
Um, hello?

2402
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:34,060
Oh, it's a monkey with dynamite.

2403
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:37,660
All right, we'll just hide that there.

2404
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:40,480
Hello?

2405
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:42,400
Do we do need that?

2406
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:45,660
Oh, oh.

2407
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:49,700
Oh, he gave it to me lit.

2408
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:54,490
Oh.

2409
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:56,770
Wait, come on.

2410
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:03,440
Oh no, my sword!

2411
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:04,440
Oh,

2412
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:09,110
I think we might want to do Marion.

2413
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:11,150
She's so much more nimble.

2414
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:15,550
And up!

2415
02:08:19,350 --> 02:08:20,210
Ha ha ha ha.

2416
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,370
Ha ha ha.

2417
02:08:23,910 --> 02:08:24,390
Ha ha ha.

2418
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,400
What is...

2419
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:32,300
What are we pulling down anyway?

2420
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:36,300
Oh.

2421
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:38,540
What was the point of that?

2422
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:48,110
Aww, see this is relaxing and peaceful.

2423
02:08:49,370 --> 02:08:50,370
This is nice.

2424
02:08:51,110 --> 02:08:52,110
Oh wow, what of you?

2425
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:54,430
Wow, there's so much money up here.

2426
02:08:55,290 --> 02:08:56,930
Oh, this is so relaxing.

2427
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:01,550
Mmm.

2428
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:04,850
Oh, barbecue!

2429
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:14,630
I think you were supposed to do that before throwing the banana.

2430
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:16,550
Oh yeah, it totally did work.

2431
02:09:16,970 --> 02:09:18,070
That's funny.

2432
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:22,010
What's Vinky grilling?

2433
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:27,030
Unlimited money.

2434
02:09:27,190 --> 02:09:27,930
Unlimited money.

2435
02:09:29,850 --> 02:09:31,330
I'm grilling nothing.

2436
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:33,470
I'm grilling nothing.

2437
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:35,630
I'm grilling nothing.

2438
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:40,190
There'll be like...

2439
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,210
It'll be like five.

2440
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:45,830
people in chat that understands this.

2441
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:51,510
What's Minky Grilling?

2442
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,740
Can I destroy this too?

2443
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:57,120
Nah.

2444
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,800
Oh, let's go over...

2445
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,660
I think we have to go over there, so what's down here?

2446
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:08,220
I see.

2447
02:10:13,770 --> 02:10:14,290
Okay.

2448
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:16,130
Easy does it?

2449
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:17,450
Yes.

2450
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:22,820
Oh my god, that's our first one that's kind of crazy haven't been very good at finding them huh

2451
02:10:26,370 --> 02:10:37,270

2453
02:10:54,630 --> 02:10:55,810

2454
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:57,310
Oh, it's a...

2455
02:10:58,830 --> 02:11:00,270
It's a golf ball!

2456
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:08,870
Cute.

2457
02:11:11,790 --> 02:11:13,090
Oh, this looks...

2458
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:15,530
I hope we don't get ambushed in here.

2459
02:11:15,690 --> 02:11:16,750
It'll be very annoying.

2460
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:19,830
Oh, yeah, yeah!

2461
02:11:22,410 --> 02:11:24,770
Oh, true adventurer!

2462
02:11:26,110 --> 02:11:26,990
That's me!

2463
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:30,510
Oh, to me, I have a real adventure.

2464
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:31,730
Wait.

2465
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:33,370
You try.

2466
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:34,850
Oh.

2467
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:41,820
Hmm.

2468
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:42,500
Wait.

2469
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:43,900
Maybe he...

2470
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:45,940
No?

2471
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:52,640
No construction without destruction.

2472
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:54,520
I'm gonna...

2473
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:02,420
I'm going to destroy everything that they've put in their heart.

2474
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:02,940
Work?

2475
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:04,860
Oh my god!

2476
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:08,700
Woo!

2477
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:13,080
Everything that they've built so far, I'm destroying.

2478
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:15,220
Indy!

2479
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:17,160
Indy!

2480
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:31,470
Silver things like that need to be exploded.

2481
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:33,030
I have nothing to explode.

2482
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:35,270
No way to explode it!

2483
02:12:35,970 --> 02:12:36,390
Take that!

2484
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,870
Give me.

2485
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:41,050
Give me what I desire.

2486
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:42,970
You think I can make this jump on the right?

2487
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:49,930
Yeah, I thought so.

2488
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:54,170
Often a free play.

2489
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:57,650
I'm guessing in free play, you can bring whatever characters along that you want.

2490
02:13:03,530 --> 02:13:05,130
She's so nimble.

2491
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:08,030
She's so graceful.

2492
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:12,510
She's so hot and sexy and beautiful.

2493
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:14,890
Her name is Minto!

2494
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:23,090
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, that's what everybody's thinking.

2495
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:32,090
We don't have, oh wait, he's gonna give us the wrench.

2496
02:13:33,530 --> 02:13:35,590
Oh, Indy, you do your thing.

2497
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:37,970
Okay!

2498
02:13:38,890 --> 02:13:39,410
Gosh.

2499
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:44,970
What is this for?

2500
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:47,650
Maybe over here?

2501
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:50,250
Something?

2502
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:52,750
Hmm.

2503
02:13:54,190 --> 02:13:54,610
Mysterious.

2504
02:14:06,770 --> 02:14:08,150
What's it for?

2505
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,990
I like how you can...

2506
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:17,230
Oh, oh, there we go.

2507
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:17,750
Ah!

2508
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:20,110
Oh my gosh.

2509
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,710
Destroy everything!

2510
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:22,810
Destroy everything!

2511
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:24,630
I'm learning.

2512
02:14:27,190 --> 02:14:27,890
Okay, nice.

2513
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:29,930
It's for this.

2514
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:34,170
Okay, why does everything explode?

2515
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,600
Oh.

2516
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:39,900
Banana.

2517
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:44,320
Oh, I see the other piece up top.

2518
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:47,840
Thank you.

2519
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:56,570
In order to create, you first must destroy.

2520
02:14:57,930 --> 02:14:58,790
Ah, there it is.

2521
02:14:59,010 --> 02:14:59,450
Okay, nice.

2522
02:15:00,410 --> 02:15:01,750
Okay, now we can build.

2523
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:06,660
Do it.

2524
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:09,320
Oh yeah, nope, do it.

2525
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:09,720
Build.

2526
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:10,780
Build.

2527
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,600
Do what is in your blood.

2528
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:21,820
I wasn't quite sure what we were building at first.

2529
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:25,800
Oh, how cute!

2530
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,800
Alright, I guess we continue onwards.

2531
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:39,770
Can't wait to buy my $300 Lego Minto mini thing.

2532
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:44,130
Oh, hello.

2533
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:48,090
Yeah.

2534
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:49,810
Take you out.

2535
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:53,430
I'm gonna take you out.

2536
02:15:54,070 --> 02:15:54,710
Anybody else?

2537
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:59,950
That's what I thought.

2538
02:16:01,230 --> 02:16:02,470
That's what I thought.

2539
02:16:05,230 --> 02:16:05,470
Um.

2540
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:08,730
Yeah.

2541
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:11,910
It's all dramatic for no reason.

2542
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:15,610
Okay, now we can destroy... Oh, no, no, no.

2543
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:17,590
Don't use your... Don't use your gun, Indy.

2544
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:19,410
Don't waste the bullets.

2545
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:21,290
Where are we going?

2546
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:23,150
I guess we're gonna go kill some guys.

2547
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:23,410
Oh.

2548
02:16:24,490 --> 02:16:25,510
Which I just did.

2549
02:16:26,990 --> 02:16:29,030
And then the music is happy again.

2550
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:30,050
We kill.

2551
02:16:30,810 --> 02:16:31,970
And then music is happy.

2552
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,810
Oh, and we kill.

2553
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:35,970
And we kill.

2554
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:37,470
And music.

2555
02:16:38,550 --> 02:16:39,970
Oh, no, not yet.

2556
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:41,350
Oh, there's so many guys.

2557
02:16:41,530 --> 02:16:43,130
Wow, there's so many men!

2558
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:47,920
Okay, Marion.

2559
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:52,930
Holy cow!

2560
02:16:55,790 --> 02:16:56,590
Can I have...

2561
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:57,430
Oh my gosh.

2562
02:16:58,590 --> 02:16:59,190
Can I have his hat?

2563
02:16:59,330 --> 02:16:59,870
I can.

2564
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:01,010
No, no, no.

2565
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:01,370
The hat.

2566
02:17:01,550 --> 02:17:01,830
The hat.

2567
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:02,410
Yes.

2568
02:17:03,330 --> 02:17:03,570
Oh,

2569
02:17:08,390 --> 02:17:08,530
my!

2570
02:17:08,710 --> 02:17:08,930
Hey!

2571
02:17:09,030 --> 02:17:09,210
Hey, hey!

2572
02:17:10,490 --> 02:17:10,970
Disguise.

2573
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:11,750
Disguise.

2574
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:16,490
She's crazy.

2575
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,410
Wait.

2576
02:17:25,010 --> 02:17:26,210
I want to go...

2577
02:17:26,210 --> 02:17:27,130
Wait, can I go back?

2578
02:17:27,650 --> 02:17:29,650
It's quite far, but I want to like...

2579
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:31,770
Oh my god, there's so many guys!

2580
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:36,350
Holy moly, there's so many guys.

2581
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:41,490
Remember how there was like the little... there was like a spot where um...

2582
02:17:43,330 --> 02:17:45,070
You could fool the guards.

2583
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:47,970
Kind of want to get that.

2584
02:17:49,430 --> 02:17:51,010
Well, this is an explodey.

2585
02:17:51,710 --> 02:17:52,510
Oh, interesting.

2586
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:54,010
Oh wait!

2587
02:17:56,170 --> 02:17:57,170
Oh here, maybe?

2588
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:58,230
Hello!

2589
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,650
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

2590
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:02,670
I'm gonna fool him!

2591
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:03,850
I'm gonna fool him!

2592
02:18:05,790 --> 02:18:06,130
Hello!

2593
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,240
What are you gonna get me?

2594
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,160
Oh.

2595
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:17,100
I don't think we fooled them.

2596
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:18,100
Wait, we opened...

2597
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:20,040
Wait, but then they...

2598
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:24,700
But then they immediately knew that we were...

2599
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:25,080
Wait.

2600
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:27,500
Oh.

2601
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:29,480
Wait, hi.

2602
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,820
Wait, uh-huh.

2603
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:37,140
How?

2604
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:39,340
Why'd they let me in then?

2605
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:42,320
Oh my gosh!

2606
02:18:51,350 --> 02:18:52,470
Well, I took them out too.

2607
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:55,670
It's a mutual thing.

2608
02:18:58,010 --> 02:18:59,570
She doesn't have the hat.

2609
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:01,010
Wait, does she act?

2610
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:01,350
Wait.

2611
02:19:02,270 --> 02:19:03,830
Does she need to grab a hat?

2612
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:13,450
Um...

2613
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:16,930
Can I go in?

2614
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:24,190
I gotta press Y.

2615
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:39,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes.

2616
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:42,100
Oh, no, I should not have been given this much power.

2617
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:44,860
Oh, yes.

2618
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,140
Oh, yes.

2619
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:46,780
Oops.

2620
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:47,520
Oh, no.

2621
02:19:48,100 --> 02:19:48,600
Oh, no.

2622
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:49,140
Wait.

2623
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,220
Oh, no, no, no.

2624
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:51,180
Oh, no, no.

2625
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:51,280
Oh, no.

2626
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:52,380
Oh, no.

2627
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:52,940
Oh, no.

2628
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:53,640
Oh, no.

2629
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:54,940
Oh, no, no.

2630
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:56,200
Oops.

2631
02:19:58,560 --> 02:20:00,520
Wait, but there was so much stuff over here.

2632
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:03,560
I still want to get money.

2633
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:05,760
I have so much money.

2634
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:07,340
Okay, I need to stop being greedy.

2635
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:09,200
I need to stop being greedy.

2636
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:11,980
Okay, where's my car?

2637
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:12,760
Okay, here we go.

2638
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:13,260
Alright.

2639
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:14,080
Oh, nope.

2640
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:14,400
Nope.

2641
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:14,940
We're driving.

2642
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:17,440
Let the lady drive.

2643
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:22,930
Can I smash this?

2644
02:20:24,210 --> 02:20:24,610
Nope.

2645
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:30,270
Hmm.

2646
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:32,150
What else can I smash?

2647
02:20:32,850 --> 02:20:33,510
Not that.

2648
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:36,590
It's okay, Indy can run.

2649
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2650
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:39,450
All right, here we go.

2651
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:40,470
To the other side.

2652
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,390
Here we go.

2653
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:45,230
We're going to smash through their barricade.

2654
02:20:46,970 --> 02:20:48,090
This one right here.

2655
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:51,350
Yeah!

2656
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:54,790
Oh, a bike.

2657
02:20:58,310 --> 02:21:00,630
You can hit a ramp or...

2658
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:01,470
Oh, wait!

2659
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:04,270
Wait!

2660
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:10,550
Oh, it's the scene, it's the famous scene!

2661
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:20,740
Hello, my friend!

2662
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:24,440
I think you're my friend, I can't actually tell who anybody is.

2663
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:26,280
Behind?

2664
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:27,600
Miriam!

2665
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:30,560
Oh my gosh, how could she get kidnapped?

2666
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:39,250
Aw, we just killed her.

2667
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:42,870
He's so...

2668
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:46,310
He's just so oblivious.

2669
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:48,670
He's just like me, for real, for real.

2670
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:54,810
We got Desert Innie.

2671
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:56,690
Indie, Indie, Indie, Indie.

2672
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:03,850
Howdy there, pretty lady.

2673
02:22:03,970 --> 02:22:05,170
How's the adventuring going?

2674
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:06,970
I'm having fun.

2675
02:22:08,330 --> 02:22:09,910
I got one thing.

2676
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:12,710
What else was there?

2677
02:22:12,730 --> 02:22:14,530
Oh, there were other characters to unlock.

2678
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:17,330
Let's see.

2679
02:22:18,050 --> 02:22:19,210
Yeah, he's like a belly button.

2680
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:20,090
Any belly button.

2681
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:22,170
Oh, hi, Marion.

2682
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:24,930
I think I'm done with the disguises for now.

2683
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:26,270
We'll turn these off.

2684
02:22:27,110 --> 02:22:30,610
I have not seen what fertilizer is or secret characters are.

2685
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,570
Or beep beep.

2686
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:34,090
Yeah.

2687
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:36,930
Oh, mysterious.

2688
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:38,590
But let's buy some stuff.

2689
02:22:39,490 --> 02:22:40,610
Let's just buy everybody.

2690
02:22:42,730 --> 02:22:43,810
Bet I can at least.

2691
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:48,710
Oh.

2692
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:50,450
Oh.

2693
02:22:51,630 --> 02:22:52,230
Oh.

2694
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:52,750
Oh.

2695
02:22:52,750 --> 02:22:53,310
Oh.

2696
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:57,510
Add some more characters and free play.

2697
02:22:58,110 --> 02:22:59,170
Should we try a free play?

2698
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:01,810
Let's go try one.

2699
02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:04,450
Since I have stuff unlocked, you know?

2700
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:07,010
Oh, look, there's more people walking around.

2701
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:07,750
So cute.

2702
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:11,590
Let's try a free play of like...

2703
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:12,570
Let's do like...

2704
02:23:13,790 --> 02:23:14,230
Two.

2705
02:23:16,090 --> 02:23:19,470
Oh, I can be anybody.

2706
02:23:20,090 --> 02:23:20,990
I can be this guy.

2707
02:23:21,130 --> 02:23:21,510
I can be...

2708
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:22,630
Oh, I can be a patty!

2709
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:25,210
Yes.

2710
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:28,210
Wait, why are there so many people?

2711
02:23:29,050 --> 02:23:30,630
It's just the same level again.

2712
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,910
Wait, am I going to be fighting him again?

2713
02:23:38,150 --> 02:23:38,750
I could be...

2714
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:40,190
I could be Santa Claus!

2715
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:43,110
I'm Santa!

2716
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:50,540
What does Santa do?

2717
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:54,040
What's special about him?

2718
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:56,900
Oh my god, Santa destroy!

02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:01,860

Wait.

2724
02:24:54,330 --> 02:24:55,610
Does this guy never die?

2725
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:57,890
Doesn't seem like it.

2726
02:24:58,050 --> 02:24:58,570
That's kind of awesome.

2727
02:24:59,530 --> 02:24:59,710

2728
02:25:00,730 --> 02:25:01,230

Yeah!

2732
02:25:18,730 --> 02:25:19,610
We're done.

2733
02:25:28,170 --> 02:25:29,810
God doesn't die.

2734
02:25:30,570 --> 02:25:31,630
It's so strong.

2735
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:32,410
Wait, Santa.

2736
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:36,150
Santa, what if you became a guy with a shovel?

2737
02:25:36,870 --> 02:25:37,530
Who has a shovel?

2738
02:25:38,250 --> 02:25:40,510
Wait, he has that other guy has a book.

2739
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:43,090
What is this anyway?

2740
02:25:45,690 --> 02:25:46,230
Snowmobile.

2741
02:25:46,590 --> 02:25:46,670
Okay.

2742
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:49,170
Oh, sorry, my bad.

2743
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:54,830
And I'm going to ride it.

2744
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:55,210
No.

2745
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:57,730
Wait, why is it still shiny here?

2746
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:58,370
What do you got?

2747
02:25:58,790 --> 02:26:00,270
Oh, we gotta dig up the rest.

2748
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:01,270
Okay.

2749
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:03,390
Oh, there's so much to dig up.

2750
02:26:07,110 --> 02:26:08,150
Does Santa...

2751
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:09,150
Oh, my bad.

2752
02:26:12,150 --> 02:26:13,190
Does Santa...

2753
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:14,610
Okay, cover me.

2754
02:26:16,230 --> 02:26:17,170
Does Santa die?

2755
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:26,760
Cover me.

2756
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:30,300
Monk!

2757
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:31,160
Monk!

2758
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:32,120
Monk!

2759
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:37,470
Everything's good.

2760
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:39,110
Cover me, cover me.

2761
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,430
I forget that they can't kill.

2762
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:44,610
Oh my gosh, what is happening here?

2763
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:46,710
Oh.

2764
02:26:50,570 --> 02:26:51,010
Oh.

2765
02:26:58,020 --> 02:26:58,460
Oh.

2766
02:26:58,460 --> 02:26:58,620
Woo!

2767
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:04,260
That was cute.

2768
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:05,640
Okay, I'm good here.

2769
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:09,860
Um, I can say without saving, it's okay.

2770
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:11,180
We didn't make much progress.

2771
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:15,780
That was cute.

2772
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:18,020
I understand now.

2773
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,240
Wait, so we can unlock so many people.

2774
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:27,730
Now, wait, I'm not even indie.

2775
02:27:30,270 --> 02:27:31,650
I'm not even indie.

2776
02:27:32,330 --> 02:27:33,950
Let's do chapter 4.

2777
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:37,930
Wait, is there anything after 4?

2778
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:38,830
There has to be.

2779
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:41,170
Right.

2780
02:27:42,890 --> 02:27:44,710
They just haven't shown up yet?

2781
02:27:44,970 --> 02:27:45,150
Yeah.

2782
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:52,580
There's six per movie.

2783
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:53,400
Okay, okay, okay.

2784
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:57,700
Let's get through, let's get through this movie and then we'll call it.

2785
02:27:58,800 --> 02:27:59,860
Still quite a bit left though.

2786
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:03,200
As long as I don't like mess around too much, I think I'll be good.

2787
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:04,860
I'm working, I'm working!

2788
02:28:19,810 --> 02:28:21,770
We didn't get to see the monkey die.

2789
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:28,850
Yes, yeah, yes.

2790
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:31,210
Mm-hmm, I am, yes.

2791
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:40,560
Oh, snakes!

2792
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:43,320
Oh!

2793
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:46,060
Rude!

2794
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:47,640
Oh, they're so cute, though.

2795
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,480
This little Lego snakes.

2796
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:50,640
Oh, my gosh, he's so cute!

2797
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:55,540
The Well of Souls.

2798
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:58,560
Some characters have phobias and will panic.

2799
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:00,460
He'll find a way to clear a path.

2800
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:02,320
Remember, small creatures will...

2801
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:02,320
What?

2802
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:03,400
What did he say?

2803
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:07,760
Small creatures will avoid fire.

2804
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:11,600
He's spooked.

2805
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:13,120
He's like, no!

2806
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:17,400
Oh, good.

2807
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:18,580
This is the...

2808
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:20,000
What's it called?

2809
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,500
The book for translation.

2810
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:24,660
What do you do?

2811
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:28,560
Don't...

2812
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:29,520
Don't follow me, Indy.

2813
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:31,360
Don't follow me, Indy.

2814
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:35,880
Don't follow me.

2815
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:36,860
Don't do that, Indy.

2816
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:38,400
Don't follow me.

2817
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:40,520
I thought it would...

2818
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:42,000
I thought they would be scared of me.

2819
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:53,240
Nice.

2820
02:29:58,920 --> 02:29:59,480
Okay.

2821
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:02,240
Oh, wait.

2822
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:02,980
What's this do?

2823
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:04,020
Oh!

2824
02:30:04,360 --> 02:30:04,780
Oh, shoot.

2825
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:05,900
Oh!

2826
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:12,380
You touch one snake one time and you automatically are done so.

2827
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:16,760
We're gonna build a fire!

2828
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:20,440
Just like real life.

2829
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:21,360
Yeah, exactly.

2830
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:22,120
Take it.

2831
02:30:24,220 --> 02:30:25,180
And... nice.

2832
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:26,560
Oh!

2833
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,700
Okay, indeed there's like...

2834
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:36,480
Wait, this is... this has a certain... Yeah, this has a time limit.

2835
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:38,020
Do I get another one?

2836
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:38,960
Oh no.

2837
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:40,320
Oh yes I do!

2838
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:41,520
Okay, oh yeah!

2839
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:43,300
Alright, move over snakes.

2840
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:44,500
Move over.

2841
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:49,060
Was there anything over here?

2842
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:51,020
Move over snakes!

2843
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:53,300
I don't want to die.

2844
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:53,980
Ah!

2845
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:59,100
I know there's a door button.

2846
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:00,560
I'm exploring!

2847
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:02,740
Okay.

2848
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:03,600
Anyway.

2849
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:05,120
Get the other one, Indy.

2850
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:13,860
No money.

2851
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:14,500
No money.

2852
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:15,560
It's okay.

2853
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:16,040
Woo!

2854
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:18,260
Watch out!

2855
02:31:18,760 --> 02:31:19,340
Oh!

2856
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:21,440
Oh, I didn't see the one on the side!

2857
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:23,740
Oh my goodness.

2858
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:25,680
Be careful, everybody.

2859
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:31,840
You know, I don't think I would cut it out really as an archaeologist.

2860
02:31:34,100 --> 02:31:36,580
Not an indie era, I think, maybe.

2861
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:42,040
I think I wouldn't survive.

2862
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:50,110
Did I pick that up?

2863
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:55,130
How do we do this?

2864
02:31:56,830 --> 02:31:57,370
Okay.

2865
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:00,630
Oh, wait.

2866
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:01,210
Maybe this?

2867
02:32:01,490 --> 02:32:01,650
No?

2868
02:32:03,430 --> 02:32:03,910
Just kidding.

2869
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:06,950
These are to be destroyed.

2870
02:32:07,310 --> 02:32:08,990
Not much is to be saved, huh?

2871
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:11,250
The Laura Croft type.

2872
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:13,550
I don't know, man.

2873
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:20,310
Oh, I can just destroy the spike.

2874
02:32:22,010 --> 02:32:23,310
Lego, Lego!

2875
02:32:23,810 --> 02:32:24,510
Yeah, Lego!

2876
02:32:27,490 --> 02:32:27,910
Yeah!

2877
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:34,340
Andy, I'm gonna need you to work.

2878
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:35,510
Oh.

2879
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:38,410
Oh.

2880
02:32:41,050 --> 02:32:41,830
So cute.

2881
02:32:45,230 --> 02:32:46,150
You need a book.

2882
02:32:46,530 --> 02:32:47,210
Yeah, I have it.

2883
02:32:47,290 --> 02:32:47,750
I have it.

2884
02:32:49,170 --> 02:32:49,810
What's it say?

2885
02:32:49,850 --> 02:32:49,990
Oh.

2886
02:32:50,330 --> 02:32:52,030
Well, I have...

2887
02:32:52,030 --> 02:32:52,990
Wait, Indy, you still have...

2888
02:32:52,990 --> 02:32:54,370
Yeah, Indy has it.

2889
02:32:57,430 --> 02:32:58,470
It says...

2890
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:02,970
Follow the sequence...

2891
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:05,110
Wait, can you do it again?

2892
02:33:05,870 --> 02:33:06,090
Wait.

2893
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:07,470
Wait.

2894
02:33:20,180 --> 02:33:21,220
Easy peasy?

2895
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:25,980
Minto would trigger all the traps.

2896
02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:41,380
live well i am a ghost for a reason maybe let me tell you that this game's co-op caused some sibling rivalry in my household yeah i believe it i like how all the fire has

2897
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:57,140
oh oh you see that two little things stick out let's see is there anything we can do here to give over there.

2898
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:01,920
I'm not sure.

2899
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,300
I need a small character.

2900
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:09,440
Okay, that's what I thought.

2901
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:13,260
That's a little passageway had something to do with it.

2902
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:18,720
Fancy.

2903
02:34:18,980 --> 02:34:19,900
Wow, there's so much in here.

2904
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:25,380
Fancy, schmancy.

2905
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,000
Let's see what's up here first.

2906
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:33,620
Push me over!

2907
02:34:35,860 --> 02:34:36,420
Yes!

2908
02:34:37,860 --> 02:34:38,600
Good job!

2909
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:41,580
Wait, you didn't finish the job.

2910
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:42,160
There we go.

2911
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:42,400
Oh.

2912
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:45,880
Okay.

2913
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:48,740
I guess that works.

2914
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:51,300
Push me over!

2915
02:34:59,210 --> 02:35:01,690
Oh, good job, Indy.

2916
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:02,410
Indeed!

2917
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:05,990
Why did you do that?

2918
02:35:07,530 --> 02:35:09,670
Why did you do that, you dummy dumb?

2919
02:35:10,830 --> 02:35:11,770
You stupid head?

2920
02:35:12,910 --> 02:35:14,050
Why did you do that?

2921
02:35:15,010 --> 02:35:15,970
Indiana Jones.

2922
02:35:17,410 --> 02:35:20,650
Did you not see the puzzle that we were working on together?

2923
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,900
It's a lot going on in here, huh?

2924
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:27,160
Okay, let's just...

2925
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:30,520
I feel like I'm a kid at an amusement park where I'm just like...

2926
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:32,600
I'm...

2927
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:38,500
Picking up everything and touching everything and pushing everything and pulling.

2928
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:39,380
and everything.

2929
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:43,160
I'm just getting into trouble.

2930
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:47,160
Oh, let's see that diamond.

2931
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:48,380
Okay, wait.

2932
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:49,220
What's on the other side?

2933
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:50,160
We can check.

2934
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:53,840
Oh!

2935
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:55,160
Oh, that's not good.

2936
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:55,680
Wait.

2937
02:35:56,020 --> 02:35:56,600
Oh, that's not good.

2938
02:35:56,960 --> 02:35:57,020
Oh.

2939
02:35:58,420 --> 02:35:59,480
Yeah, beat them up.

2940
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:03,260
Beat up those guys?

2941
02:36:11,910 --> 02:36:13,030
There's only like five of them.

2942
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:13,350
of them.

2943
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:13,930
It's fine.

2944
02:36:16,650 --> 02:36:16,790
Cool.

2945
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:20,210
Right up spiders.

2946
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:24,730
Destroy, destroy, battle!

2947
02:36:25,030 --> 02:36:25,850
Oh, there's more of them.

2948
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:28,610
The music is so good.

2949
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:29,350
Oh, sorry, Indy.

2950
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:30,470
I think I'm beating you up.

2951
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:35,990
I was...

2952
02:36:35,990 --> 02:36:37,090
Oh, a head.

2953
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:42,410
It goes to you.

2954
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:48,500
Uh-oh.

2955
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:49,500
What's that sound?

2956
02:36:49,700 --> 02:36:50,540
Oh, there's another guy.

2957
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:56,360
I think he's dead now.

2958
02:36:57,260 --> 02:36:58,060
I think he's dead now.

2959
02:36:58,260 --> 02:36:58,660
Okay, Indy.

2960
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:02,440
Do you remember the problem, the puzzle that we were just working on?

2961
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:03,100
You remember that?

2962
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:04,960
Okay, Indiana Jones.

2963
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:09,000
You're gonna do that puzzle, and you're gonna be so great at it, okay?

2964
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:09,660
All right.

2965
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:11,180
You're gonna go up here.

2966
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:15,300
All right.

2967
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,280
And then, you're gonna go, like, here.

2968
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:21,100
And then, that thing, how did that thing work before?

2969
02:37:22,660 --> 02:37:24,700
Why did it move on its own before?

2970
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:26,300
We don't know.

2971
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:27,700
Wait, there's a thing here.

2972
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:33,890
He is a silly guy.

2973
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:39,350
He's a really silly man.

2974
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:42,650
We don't fault him for that.

2975
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:49,290
Can I get...

2976
02:37:50,350 --> 02:37:50,830
No.

2977
02:37:51,870 --> 02:37:54,050
And I see that exploding guy, too.

2978
02:37:54,290 --> 02:37:55,750
Wait, wait, wait.

2979
02:37:57,830 --> 02:37:59,610
Actually, how does this work?

2980
02:38:00,650 --> 02:38:02,590
How am I supposed to get to the other side?

2981
02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:10,110
Maybe Indy knew that it was a stupid idea.

2982
02:38:11,410 --> 02:38:13,050
He was saving me the embarrassment.

2983
02:38:22,030 --> 02:38:23,250
Can I get some TNT?

2984
02:38:26,770 --> 02:38:27,650
Oh, wait!

2985
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:31,030
Oh, I see, I see!

2986
02:38:32,650 --> 02:38:34,270
Oh, thank you guys.

2987
02:38:34,450 --> 02:38:37,390
I was wondering how I could attach to that.

2988
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:40,010
Okay, so then if I have him...

2989
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:42,030
That's right, I was like, I did move this over.

2990
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:42,970
I'm not dumb.

2991
02:38:43,170 --> 02:38:44,990
Like, I moved this over for a reason.

2992
02:38:46,970 --> 02:38:47,730
Oh, oh!

2993
02:38:48,330 --> 02:38:48,770
Okay.

2994
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:50,530
Ah, that's why!

2995
02:38:50,690 --> 02:38:51,350
Okay, okay, okay.

2996
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:52,870
I was like, wait a second.

2997
02:38:56,770 --> 02:38:58,470
I knew I was missing a step.

2998
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:01,730
Okay, we're fine now.

2999
02:39:01,810 --> 02:39:02,470
Everything's good.

3000
02:39:04,750 --> 02:39:05,550
Good job.

3001
02:39:11,330 --> 02:39:11,730

02:39:19,870 --> 02:39:21,270
Alright, now we're back in business.

3008
02:39:23,490 --> 02:39:25,270
Yeah, Indy just ran off that one time.

3009
02:39:25,390 --> 02:39:26,350
Yeah, yeah, exactly!

3010
02:39:26,850 --> 02:39:27,450
I was like, wait.

3011
02:39:27,990 --> 02:39:28,790
I thought it was me.

3012
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:29,910
It was not me.

3013
02:39:31,870 --> 02:39:32,190
Wait.

3014
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:35,530
This needs to go...

3015
02:39:36,090 --> 02:39:38,190

Now we take our money, and now we do this.

3019
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:31,900
There we go.

3020
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:34,980
No!

3021
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:35,760
Oh!

3022
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:38,160
I'm not nimble enough.

3023
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:40,100
I'm not a nimble lady.

3024
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:41,620
Ah!

3025
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:42,580
Dang it.

3026
02:40:45,370 --> 02:40:46,330
Grab it.

3027
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:50,960
I'm not nimble enough of a lady.

3028
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:02,480
Double jump?

3029
02:41:03,100 --> 02:41:04,740
There is no double jump, you guys.

3030
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:06,120
Maybe he has one.

3031
02:41:08,740 --> 02:41:09,600
Maybe he has one.

3032
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:10,040
Let's see.

3033
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:27,270
You just did it.

3034
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:28,770
Does this look like a double jump to you?

3035
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:33,870
Jump backwards.

3036
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:36,930
Oh.

3037
02:41:37,730 --> 02:41:38,070
Oops.

3038
02:41:39,470 --> 02:41:40,410
Jump backwards.

3039
02:41:43,450 --> 02:41:44,670
Let's try.

3040
02:41:48,370 --> 02:41:50,050
I might be a genius.

3041
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:52,810
Alright, let's go.

3042
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:57,770
Like how he keeps scratching his head.

3043
02:42:00,170 --> 02:42:00,590
Okay.

3044
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:02,510
We got a lot going on in here too.

3045
02:42:04,090 --> 02:42:05,310
Good thing we have a shovel!

3046
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:12,660
And we got a book.

3047
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:15,420
Oh, okay, this again.

3048
02:42:15,900 --> 02:42:16,400
Alright, here we go.

3049
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:18,560
Breed.

3050
02:42:19,980 --> 02:42:20,360
Breed.

3051
02:42:22,180 --> 02:42:23,140
Middle down, up.

3052
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:27,780
Middle, down, up, right.

3053
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:31,640
Ha ha ha ha!

3054
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:36,880
I am smarter than a fifth grader.

3055
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:43,020
Oh wait, do I need Indy for this?

3056
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:44,160
Oh, dang it.

3057
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:45,040
Okay, no.

3058
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:46,500
I should be able to grab it.

3059
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:47,480
Let's do it.

3060
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:48,220
Let's try Indy.

3061
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:52,740
Why is he so cool and why is he...

3062
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:53,180
There we go.

3063
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:54,260
Okay, yeah, we do need Indy.

3064
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:57,280
He grabs it with one hand.

3065
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:02,410
You're smarter than me?

3066
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:03,670
Are you a fifth grader?

3067
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:04,730
Oh.

3068
02:43:04,830 --> 02:43:05,170
Oh,

3069
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:17,700
it's making me want to ride Indiana Jones ride.

3070
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:21,700
Where does this go?

3071
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:25,100
Is that ice cream?

3072
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:26,280
I kind of wish.

3073
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:28,620
Where does this go?

3074
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:29,660
I'll put it here for now.

3075
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:33,480
Oh, maybe it goes on there.

3076
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:38,060
Yes.

3077
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:42,300
Hail?

3078
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:43,820
Yes, I see it.

3079
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:49,880
Oh,

3080
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:54,970
that's just to install it.

3081
02:43:55,070 --> 02:43:55,650
Okay, just kidding.

3082
02:43:56,390 --> 02:43:56,950
You dig.

3083
02:44:02,850 --> 02:44:03,790
Thank you.

3084
02:44:04,410 --> 02:44:05,030
No, not yet.

3085
02:44:06,210 --> 02:44:09,330
Hold on, there's more to destroy and more to loot.

3086
02:44:11,130 --> 02:44:12,890
Take all this money.

3087
02:44:13,550 --> 02:44:17,110
Put it towards retirement.

3088
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:22,910
Ha!

3089
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:26,190
Did I get everything in here?

3090
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:28,970
Hmm.

3091
02:44:30,810 --> 02:44:31,270
Wait.

3092
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:33,630
What's back there?

3093
02:44:34,170 --> 02:44:34,870
How mysterious?

3094
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:37,130
It looks like something.

3095
02:44:39,410 --> 02:44:41,770
Maybe I can't get it.

3096
02:44:43,790 --> 02:44:44,270
All right.

3097
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:51,040
Wow!

3098
02:44:52,700 --> 02:44:53,560
Ooh!

3099
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:56,370
Ooh!

3100
02:45:02,130 --> 02:45:03,810
Indy, this is your show.

3101
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:10,920
The Ark of the Covenant.

3102
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:17,000
I sure hope we're not ambushed here.

3103
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,520
I sure hope I'm not left here to die.

3104
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:21,780
Ah!

3105
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:33,360
Oh, wow.

3106
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:38,640
Goodbye.

3107
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:49,260
Okay, well, um, now we have a nimble lady.

3108
02:45:50,700 --> 02:46:08,960

You're okay Okay You're okay, little baby.

3111
02:46:29,060 --> 02:46:29,500
You're okay.

3112
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:33,580
I don't think there were any coins over on this side anyway, so it's a good thing I didn't try and explore.

3113
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:35,420
Hmm.

3114
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:40,420
Ah.

3115
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:41,100
Ah!

3116
02:46:44,820 --> 02:46:45,240
Oopsie.

3117
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:51,220
You remind me of the spider queen from the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy every time you do your little discovery hum.

3118
02:46:52,400 --> 02:46:53,240
Discovery hum.

3119
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:54,860
Wait, what do I do?

3120
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:57,140
Wait.

3121
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:58,560
How do I sound?

3122
02:46:59,020 --> 02:46:59,720
I'm scared.

3123
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:02,240
I'm scared.

3124
02:47:03,220 --> 02:47:04,540
Indy, move out of the way.

3125
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:06,960
Yes.

3126
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:11,120
I'm too good.

3127
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:14,820
Your Honor.

3128
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:16,260
She's a gamer.

3129
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:20,620
I'm a nimble lady.

3130
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:21,740
I'm a nimble lady.

3131
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:23,820
What's my discovery, hum?

3132
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:25,280
What do I go?

3133
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:26,060
What do I say?

3134
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,440
Like that?

3135
02:47:34,510 --> 02:47:36,970
Sorry, you missed Indy adjusting his hat.

3136
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:49,080
When I open secret paths, I don't know what sound I make.

3137
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:50,480
I just make it.

3138
02:47:52,420 --> 02:47:53,160
Okay, hold on.

3139
02:47:56,120 --> 02:47:56,360
Oh!

3140
02:48:03,060 --> 02:48:04,900
There's many ways to go here.

3141
02:48:08,820 --> 02:48:08,940
Oh!

3142
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:10,960

3143
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:11,620
Holy cow.

3144
02:48:12,580 --> 02:48:13,100
Sorry, buddy.

3145
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:15,620
Just game?

3146
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:16,200
I'm gaming.

3147
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:17,500
I'm gaming!

3148
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:18,620
the mod?

3149
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:21,240
Yeah, clearly I must.

3150
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:23,160
No, pull it.

3151
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:40,560
Okay.

3152
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:42,080
Wait, which way do we go?

3153
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:46,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3154
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:47,720
There was so much more.

3155
02:48:49,780 --> 02:48:51,120
Okay, hold on.

3156
02:48:55,280 --> 02:48:56,080
Oh, okay.

3157
02:48:58,160 --> 02:49:00,000
Oh, oh, I think I missed my cue.

3158
02:49:00,740 --> 02:49:01,580
Please don't kill me.

3159
02:49:01,860 --> 02:49:02,660
Okay, we're fine.

3160
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:06,100
Don't be gaming.

3161
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:07,880
Oh.

3162
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:11,040
Why would you jinx me like that?

3163
02:49:15,800 --> 02:49:17,720
Now why would you do that to me?

3164
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:19,720
I need to be...

3165
02:49:19,720 --> 02:49:19,960
What?

3166
02:49:20,360 --> 02:49:21,120
Why'd she let go?

3167
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:23,900
Wait, actually, why'd she let go?

3168
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:33,440
I'm not pushing anything.

3169
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:37,980
Wait, I wasn't pushing...

3170
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:43,200
Oh, the brick on the wall!

3171
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:45,980
Oh, I see, I see.

3172
02:49:50,800 --> 02:49:51,720
Oh, oh!

3173
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:52,440
Oops.

3174
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:55,960
Okay, we can do this.

3175
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:04,460
I need you to use your arms.

3176
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:13,700
Oh, ah, gosh!

3177
02:50:15,240 --> 02:50:16,060
Maybe I can.

3178
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:22,220
Maybe I can.

3179
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:25,270
Do you guys think?

3180
02:50:28,890 --> 02:50:30,610
Jump left and right, but look up.

3181
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:33,410
Oh!

3182
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:34,630
Dude.

3183
02:50:36,490 --> 02:50:38,010
Trying to look up.

3184
02:50:38,530 --> 02:50:41,370
Oh my gosh.

3185
02:50:41,470 --> 02:50:42,710
Wait, this is kind of insane.

3186
02:50:45,470 --> 02:50:45,830
Okay.

3187
02:50:46,890 --> 02:50:47,430
Alright.

3188
02:50:53,370 --> 02:50:54,310
Oh my gosh.

3189
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:54,730
Wait.

3190
02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:55,610
Oh, no!

3191
02:51:04,330 --> 02:51:05,790
Oh, you can't stay on it.

3192
02:51:05,890 --> 02:51:07,010
even two seconds!

3193
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:09,910
How fast do you have to be?

3194
02:51:11,490 --> 02:51:12,550
Oh my gosh.

3195
02:51:15,010 --> 02:51:16,110
Oh, I got it though.

3196
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:18,690
Okay, okay, I got it.

3197
02:51:22,030 --> 02:51:23,630
First try.

3198
02:51:24,850 --> 02:51:28,910
First try, let's go.

3199
02:51:33,550 --> 02:51:35,190
I want to be greedy, but I won't.

3200
02:51:41,610 --> 02:51:47,410
Now we continue onward now that I got what I wanted.

3201
02:51:48,230 --> 02:51:51,830
Oh, she's a gamer.

3202
02:51:52,670 --> 02:51:53,490
You know it.

3203
02:51:56,930 --> 02:51:58,530
Okay, it needs to go into that corner.

3204
02:51:58,770 --> 02:51:58,970
I see.

3205
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:05,200
All right, Indy, you could move out of the way, please.

3206
02:52:11,210 --> 02:52:11,670
Okay.

3207
02:52:12,470 --> 02:52:14,010
Oh, I see why.

3208
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:14,490
Oh!

3209
02:52:15,850 --> 02:52:18,330
I should just punch the hell out of that snake.

3210
02:52:20,630 --> 02:52:21,950
Have you kissed her yet?

3211
02:52:22,190 --> 02:52:22,850
Yes, I have.

3212
02:52:22,990 --> 02:52:23,850
I'll do it again, though.

3213
02:52:29,690 --> 02:52:31,810
I'm surprised she doesn't slap me.

3214
02:52:34,690 --> 02:52:36,070
She just lets it happen.

3215
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:37,510
Maybe she likes me.

3216
02:52:37,810 --> 02:52:38,810
You guys, do you think she likes me?

3217
02:52:39,390 --> 02:52:45,200
Do you think she likes me?

3218
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:50,380
Indy's got that Riz, man.

3219
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:52,800
Oh,

3220
02:52:59,870 --> 02:53:00,630
I have the shovel.

3221
02:53:02,670 --> 02:53:03,570
Nah, that's crazy.

3222
02:53:03,790 --> 02:53:04,550
Yeah, there's no way.

3223
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:07,870
There's, like, no stinking way.

3224
02:53:09,130 --> 02:53:09,890
Oh, what?

3225
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:12,270
Only one person can have something at a time?

3226
02:53:15,890 --> 02:53:16,550
There we go.

3227
02:53:17,930 --> 02:53:19,230
Okay, and you put it in.

3228
02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:27,020
Get a commission of my OC cosplaying you.

3229
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:30,180
Tuber and can't cosplay, IRL.

3230
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:30,800
Of course!

3231
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:33,540
Um...

3232
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:34,400
Yeah.

3233
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:35,800
I don't see why not.

3234
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:38,420
Uh, I think, uh...

3235
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,600
People pretty much...

3236
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:43,480
I'm pretty much okay with...

3237
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:44,760
Like, you know...

3238
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:45,820
Any kind of fan art.

3239
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:47,900
UAA!

3240
02:53:49,800 --> 02:53:50,840
Punch it.

3241
02:53:52,820 --> 02:53:53,340
Uh...

3242
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:56,400
Aha!

3243
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:58,000
Now no more snakes will come down.

3244
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:00,920
Punch it.

3245
02:54:01,820 --> 02:54:02,760
Okay, we got one.

3246
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:03,840
It said one out of three.

3247
02:54:11,750 --> 02:54:13,150
Where do I jump, though?

3248
02:54:13,850 --> 02:54:14,170
Oh, wait.

3249
02:54:14,290 --> 02:54:15,950
I guess I need to do this, too, huh?

3250
02:54:16,950 --> 02:54:19,990
I completely forgot that I put this together.

3251
02:54:22,030 --> 02:54:22,270
Alright.

3252
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:23,570
Okay.

3253
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:24,410
Okay.

3254
02:54:25,030 --> 02:54:26,350
I'm a nimble lady.

3255
02:54:28,830 --> 02:54:29,350
Oh.

3256
02:54:30,330 --> 02:54:31,210
There we go.

3257
02:54:31,650 --> 02:54:31,930
Okay.

3258
02:54:32,190 --> 02:54:32,910
Nimble lady.

3259
02:54:33,130 --> 02:54:33,450
Oh.

3260
02:54:37,050 --> 02:54:38,130
Where'd it go?

3261
02:54:38,750 --> 02:54:39,210
Indy.

3262
02:54:42,250 --> 02:54:43,850
Just punch it.

3263
02:54:44,370 --> 02:54:45,810
Just punch it, Indy.

3264
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:51,780
Okay.

3265
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:53,260
Whoa.

3266
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:55,460
Oh.

3267
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:57,160
Was that there the whole time?

3268
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:57,700
Ow!

3269
02:54:58,020 --> 02:54:58,260
John!

3270
02:54:58,840 --> 02:54:59,120
Sorry.

3271
02:54:59,720 --> 02:55:00,760
That's actually you for...

3272
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:01,880
That's for you being dumb.

3273
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:03,360
Indiana Jones.

3274
02:55:04,700 --> 02:55:05,360
Okay.

3275
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:09,850
Saw a snake over here?

3276
02:55:10,330 --> 02:55:11,130
Or maybe it didn't.

3277
02:55:13,330 --> 02:55:17,710
Ask Marion out and make a Shia LaBuff together.

3278
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:20,110
Hey, hey, hi!

3279
02:55:20,210 --> 02:55:22,230
Oh my gosh, nah, well, thank you so much for the...

3280
02:55:22,950 --> 02:55:24,150
What the heck?

3281
02:55:24,270 --> 02:55:25,010
Thank you, thank you!

3282
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:29,070
Thank you so much, thank you.

3283
02:55:30,930 --> 02:55:31,130
Hoi!

3284
02:55:31,710 --> 02:55:31,970
Hoi!

3285
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:32,930
Hoa!

3286
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:34,850
Come on, we can do it.

3287
02:55:35,010 --> 02:55:35,210
Hoa!

3288
02:55:36,050 --> 02:55:36,530
Please!

3289
02:55:37,230 --> 02:55:41,230
Oh, maybe I needed to jump when it was still open!

3290
02:55:46,150 --> 02:55:46,630
Okay.

3291
02:55:47,650 --> 02:55:49,190
I missed my chance.

3292
02:55:49,890 --> 02:55:52,930
How, though, can I get the thing up there?

3293
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:57,830
Wait, I think this is probably trapped, huh?

3294
02:55:58,750 --> 02:55:59,210
Yeah.

3295
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:04,440
Better to ask for permission first.

3296
02:56:04,580 --> 02:56:05,000
Of course!

3297
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:06,260
Thank you for asking.

3298
02:56:06,820 --> 02:56:07,200
Wow.

3299
02:56:13,090 --> 02:56:13,890
Okay.

3300
02:56:14,590 --> 02:56:17,330
I guess we just continue onwards then.

3301
02:56:22,290 --> 02:56:24,790
Are there gonna be mummies in here?

3302
02:56:27,730 --> 02:56:28,390
Fire hurt.

3303
02:56:29,190 --> 02:56:30,070
Fire hurt.

3304
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:32,210
Not good.

3305
02:56:33,670 --> 02:56:34,450
Fire bad.

3306
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:40,420
I'm destroying precious artifacts!

3307
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:42,360
Ah!

3308
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:43,580
Oh my gosh.

3309
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:45,220
Got me good.

3310
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:48,160
Oh, wow!

3311
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:50,240
Wait, I'm stuck.

3312
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:50,820
I'm stuck.

3313
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:51,800
No, no, no, no.

3314
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:52,360
Oh my gosh.

3315
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:54,220
Oh my gosh.

3316
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:55,300
Oh my gosh.

3317
02:56:56,960 --> 02:56:57,400
Oh my gosh.

3318
02:56:57,400 --> 02:56:57,660
Oh my gosh.

3319
02:56:57,860 --> 02:57:03,280
I thought I was gonna be stuck in a loop for real.

3320
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:05,100
I was scared.

3321
02:57:05,680 --> 02:57:08,140
I was scared that I wouldn't be stuck in a death loop.

3322
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:09,340
Oh my gosh.

3323
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:11,980
He looks like a guy that's walking out, you know?

3324
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:15,000
But when he comes out is so cute.

3325
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:17,140
I forgot we can destroy spikes.

3326
02:57:19,440 --> 02:57:20,920
I think I got rid of it.

3327
02:57:23,400 --> 02:57:23,560
Yeah.

3328
02:57:24,820 --> 02:57:25,740
Destroy everything.

3329
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:29,240
Yeah, you spikes don't bother me.

3330
02:57:33,740 --> 02:57:34,660
Nerdy laundry.

3331
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:35,680
Thank you so much for the five.

3332
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:36,340
Gifted Thacker.

3333
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:39,660
I think it's Mint's first Lego game.

3334
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:40,920
It is.

3335
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,280
Well, my first, like, IP Lego game.

3336
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:43,800
Yeah.

3337
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:46,720
I don't think I could...

3338
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:46,800
Oh.

3339
02:57:47,380 --> 02:57:47,640
Oops.

3340
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:50,380
I don't think I can count Lego Island, probably.

3341
02:57:56,310 --> 02:57:57,030
Pop up.

3342
02:57:57,450 --> 02:57:57,690
Yeah.

3343
02:57:58,150 --> 02:57:58,370
Pop it.

3344
02:57:58,430 --> 02:57:58,510
Oh.

3345
02:57:59,090 --> 02:57:59,550
Not me.

3346
02:57:59,690 --> 02:58:00,250
Don't pop me.

3347
02:58:01,030 --> 02:58:01,750
Yeah, there we go.

3348
02:58:01,990 --> 02:58:03,290
Okay, now we don't have to worry about it anymore.

3349
02:58:03,890 --> 02:58:04,030
Whoa!

3350
02:58:07,880 --> 02:58:08,020
Oh.

3351
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:10,000
Okay, now we don't have to worry about it anymore.

3352
02:58:11,420 --> 02:58:14,080
Sam Barney, thank you so much for the vibe, good to thank you!

3353
02:58:18,290 --> 02:58:18,650
Ooh.

3354
02:58:19,690 --> 02:58:20,410
What is...

3355
02:58:20,410 --> 02:58:21,230
What is this?

3356
02:58:24,910 --> 02:58:26,250
Can I just punch through here?

3357
02:58:27,970 --> 02:58:28,330
Oh.

3358
02:58:30,190 --> 02:58:30,910
Very carefully?

3359
02:58:32,890 --> 02:58:33,890
Oh, no.

3360
02:58:37,090 --> 02:58:39,210
I'd say Lego Island counts.

3361
02:58:39,330 --> 02:58:39,730
You think so?

3362
02:58:41,150 --> 02:58:42,150
You still got...

3363
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:43,430
Oh, he doesn't have the book anymore.

3364
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:46,790
There's gotta be one around here somewhere.

3365
02:58:47,730 --> 02:58:48,050
Right?

3366
02:58:48,790 --> 02:58:49,230
Probably.

3367
02:58:55,210 --> 02:58:58,170
If you stand on it, do they eventually come back up?

3368
02:58:59,230 --> 02:58:59,790
Yes.

3369
02:59:00,890 --> 02:59:01,150
Come

3370
02:59:04,340 --> 02:59:05,020
on!

3371
02:59:07,540 --> 02:59:08,020
Lucky.

3372
02:59:11,640 --> 02:59:12,300
Whoa!

3373
02:59:13,640 --> 02:59:17,680
No, don't pick it up.

3374
02:59:19,980 --> 02:59:20,980
Can't punch everything.

3375
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:22,680
Well, why not, huh?

3376
02:59:22,880 --> 02:59:23,780
Why not?

3377
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:26,260
Why not?

3378
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:31,650
What is this thing?

3379
02:59:35,390 --> 02:59:37,510
I'm ready to punch the world.

3380
02:59:43,890 --> 02:59:46,130
Grab that and grab that and grab that.

3381
02:59:46,150 --> 02:59:48,390
that and grab that and jump.

3382
02:59:49,970 --> 02:59:51,370
But I don't have a book!

3383
02:59:53,030 --> 02:59:54,310
Am I doing all this for nothing?

3384
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:58,430
Indy, you shall have your book.

3385
03:00:00,110 --> 03:00:00,730
You shall have your book.

3386
03:00:07,250 --> 03:00:08,290
For what?

3387
03:00:09,830 --> 03:00:10,990
What was this for?

3388
03:00:13,510 --> 03:00:16,290
Meow meow meow meow meow meow.

3389
03:00:18,410 --> 03:00:21,350
Mew, meew, meew, meew.

3390
03:00:22,330 --> 03:00:26,430
Mew, meew, meew, meew, meew, meew, meew.

3391
03:00:34,390 --> 03:00:35,030
Adventure?

3392
03:00:35,570 --> 03:00:36,230
I get a cell.

3393
03:00:38,650 --> 03:00:38,790
Oh.

3394
03:00:39,710 --> 03:00:40,150
Hoah!

3395
03:00:42,510 --> 03:00:44,590
Oh, keep going up.

3396
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:50,200
Hello.

3397
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:54,160
Nice.

3398
03:00:54,700 --> 03:00:56,260
Wait, how the hell did you get over here?

3399
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:57,380
Did Deanna Jones?

3400
03:00:58,180 --> 03:00:58,300
What?

3401
03:00:58,400 --> 03:00:58,720
What?

3402
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:01,440
How did you get over here?

3403
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:05,100
How did he do that?

3404
03:01:10,490 --> 03:01:13,030
I thought...

3405
03:01:13,390 --> 03:01:15,210
He's just that good.

3406
03:01:19,350 --> 03:01:20,790
Archaeologist powers.

3407
03:01:21,210 --> 03:01:21,210
Oh.

3408
03:01:29,650 --> 03:01:30,750
Okay, interesting.

3409
03:01:31,690 --> 03:01:32,530
That does a thing.

3410
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:35,790
Can he make this?

3411
03:01:36,170 --> 03:01:36,750
Oh, he can!

3412
03:01:36,930 --> 03:01:37,250
Okay.

3413
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:45,670
That works.

3414
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:47,910
That wasn't the intention, but...

3415
03:01:50,630 --> 03:01:51,390
Double jumped.

3416
03:01:53,890 --> 03:01:54,410
Obviously.

3417
03:01:56,530 --> 03:01:57,970
Yeah, yeah, he double jumped.

3418
03:01:59,670 --> 03:02:01,810
I knew that guy had it in him.

3419
03:02:02,810 --> 03:02:05,310
I knew he had it in him the whole time!

3420
03:02:11,060 --> 03:02:11,320
Oh.

3421
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:12,680
No, no.

3422
03:02:14,320 --> 03:02:15,680
Now put it in.

3423
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:16,560
There we go.

3424
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:19,800
Okay.

3425
03:02:25,030 --> 03:02:25,730
The shovel.

3426
03:02:25,930 --> 03:02:26,210
I know.

3427
03:02:26,370 --> 03:02:26,970
It's so sad.

3428
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:27,770
We lose it.

3429
03:02:32,830 --> 03:02:33,830
Oh my god.

3430
03:02:36,530 --> 03:02:38,090
Marion, I need you to do anything.

3431
03:02:38,670 --> 03:02:39,170
Oh, I died.

3432
03:02:40,850 --> 03:02:42,010
Marion, this is all up to you.

3433
03:02:44,630 --> 03:02:45,310
Oh my gosh.

3434
03:02:45,490 --> 03:02:45,670
Wait.

3435
03:02:46,970 --> 03:02:47,430
Um.

3436
03:02:47,610 --> 03:02:49,870
Oh, maybe I throw fire at it.

3437
03:02:53,280 --> 03:02:53,600
Oops.

3438
03:02:56,890 --> 03:02:58,590
It would help to hit it.

3439
03:02:59,530 --> 03:02:59,970
Okay.

3440
03:03:00,650 --> 03:03:01,430
Can I have more fire?

3441
03:03:04,010 --> 03:03:04,730
Can I have more fire?

3442
03:03:04,830 --> 03:03:05,670
There he is.

3443
03:03:06,850 --> 03:03:07,110
Ouch!

3444
03:03:10,610 --> 03:03:12,550
Indy, I need you to pull your weight, buddy.

3445
03:03:15,810 --> 03:03:17,610
Oh, dang it.

3446
03:03:22,790 --> 03:03:24,070
I'm grabbing my money.

3447
03:03:24,770 --> 03:03:24,910
Oh.

3448
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:30,480
Pick that up.

3449
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:31,860
Oh, oh my gosh.

3450
03:03:31,940 --> 03:03:33,340
I wish I could dodge, for real.

3451
03:03:40,090 --> 03:03:41,090
He's dead!

3452
03:03:42,730 --> 03:03:43,770
Nina Jones did nothing?

3453
03:03:44,230 --> 03:03:44,510
The hell.

3454
03:03:45,310 --> 03:03:46,630
I just want to say that right now.

3455
03:03:47,270 --> 03:03:49,210
He let the lady do the entire job.

3456
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:56,640
He did absolutely nothing.

3457
03:03:57,780 --> 03:03:57,880
Wait.

3458
03:03:58,500 --> 03:03:59,220
Can you try that again?

3459
03:03:59,820 --> 03:04:00,000
Wait.

3460
03:04:01,900 --> 03:04:03,500
How am I supposed to reach that?

3461
03:04:08,630 --> 03:04:09,630
Classic Indy.

3462
03:04:11,550 --> 03:04:12,390
Is it?

3463
03:04:13,030 --> 03:04:14,310
Not really his style.

3464
03:04:16,610 --> 03:04:17,740
Maybe we push in.

3465
03:04:19,910 --> 03:04:19,930
Oh.

3466
03:04:23,740 --> 03:04:26,100
I didn't know this was pushing out of the...

3467
03:04:26,100 --> 03:04:26,260
Oh.

3468
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:29,080
It's because he's scared of snakes.

3469
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:29,700
I know.

3470
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:32,760
My hat.

3471
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:33,220
Ah!

3472
03:04:33,800 --> 03:04:34,100
Woo!

3473
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:41,150
He doesn't look the same without his hat, you know?

3474
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:42,780
He's got to have the hat on.

3475
03:04:44,530 --> 03:04:44,990
Oh,

3476
03:04:52,370 --> 03:04:52,830
seven loot.

3477
03:04:53,090 --> 03:04:55,190
I had no idea that was the end of it.

3478
03:04:57,510 --> 03:04:59,550
We didn't get much treasure this time, guys.

3479
03:04:59,870 --> 03:05:00,610
That's okay, though.

3480
03:05:02,550 --> 03:05:04,330
I still feel stinking rich.

3481
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:06,430
I still feel pretty rich.

3482
03:05:06,570 --> 03:05:07,570
I'm not gonna lie.

3483
03:05:12,710 --> 03:05:14,230
Let's continue the story.

3484
03:05:20,230 --> 03:05:22,150
Okay, this should be the last...

3485
03:05:22,150 --> 03:05:22,330
Wait.

3486
03:05:23,270 --> 03:05:24,010
Or there's two more.

3487
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:28,230
Oh!

3488
03:05:29,370 --> 03:05:30,550
How'd you find us?

3489
03:05:34,830 --> 03:05:37,310
This just feels like I'm playing Minecraft.

3490
03:05:40,290 --> 03:05:40,810
Bozo.

3491
03:05:50,070 --> 03:05:51,850
Oh my gosh, I just got here!

3492
03:05:55,550 --> 03:05:56,370
Get his butt.

3493
03:05:57,630 --> 03:05:57,950
Nice.

3494
03:05:59,030 --> 03:06:00,530
I'll let the pretty lady do the job.

3495
03:06:00,810 --> 03:06:01,310
Oh my gosh.

3496
03:06:02,550 --> 03:06:03,430
Don't kill me.

3497
03:06:06,490 --> 03:06:07,830
She knocks him out?

3498
03:06:08,230 --> 03:06:09,130
I take him out.

3499
03:06:11,510 --> 03:06:11,810
Wow!

3500
03:06:12,250 --> 03:06:12,690
Wow!

3501
03:06:15,030 --> 03:06:21,570
Okay, we should be safe for two seconds because this game is crazy aggressive with a...

3502
03:06:21,570 --> 03:06:23,450
Oh, they give us all sorts of supplies.

3503
03:06:24,430 --> 03:06:26,290
With respawning enemies and such.

3504
03:06:27,810 --> 03:06:28,850
Power of friendship.

3505
03:06:29,530 --> 03:06:30,350
Is this friendship?

3506
03:06:31,910 --> 03:06:34,790
I think she's in Rabu with me, actually.

3507
03:06:35,070 --> 03:06:35,230
Oh.

3508
03:06:36,050 --> 03:06:37,210
I need this.

3509
03:06:38,370 --> 03:06:39,150
And then we dig.

3510
03:06:41,090 --> 03:06:43,130
I think she's in rubble with me.

3511
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:49,920
Wait, why am I about to lose the wrench?

3512
03:06:50,360 --> 03:06:51,140
I don't need that.

3513
03:06:52,180 --> 03:06:52,740
Are we sure?

3514
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:54,920
Okay, game.

3515
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:56,360
You're a little funny.

3516
03:06:57,020 --> 03:06:58,660
I don't really understand you sometimes.

3517
03:07:06,550 --> 03:07:06,970
Oh.

3518
03:07:09,710 --> 03:07:11,030
Come on, pretty lady.

3519
03:07:23,740 --> 03:07:24,280
Easier?

3520
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:27,600
Much easier?

3521
03:07:28,860 --> 03:07:29,700
What is this deal?

3522
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:31,820
Where does this go?

3523
03:07:32,600 --> 03:07:33,720
What do we do with this?

3524
03:07:35,020 --> 03:07:36,540
What is this anyway, also?

3525
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:39,540
Uh-oh.

3526
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:41,460
What is it?

3527
03:07:45,560 --> 03:07:48,740
Let's take this, um...

3528
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:49,200
On here?

3529
03:07:53,630 --> 03:07:58,770
I thought it would go on the shining platform, but clearly not.

3530
03:08:04,310 --> 03:08:06,510
I'm just walking around now.

3531
03:08:07,950 --> 03:08:09,930
Directionless, I fear.

3532
03:08:11,650 --> 03:08:11,930
Yeah.

3533
03:08:12,670 --> 03:08:13,370
Leave me alone.

3534
03:08:13,690 --> 03:08:14,650
Doing my job.

3535
03:08:17,790 --> 03:08:20,110
Oh, see, we do need the wrench.

3536
03:08:22,350 --> 03:08:23,490
Do you guys see it?

3537
03:08:23,610 --> 03:08:24,910
Oh my gosh, there's so much gold.

3538
03:08:26,950 --> 03:08:28,550
That guy's waiting for us up there.

3539
03:08:39,290 --> 03:08:39,730
Cute!

3540
03:08:41,150 --> 03:08:41,470
Oh.

3541
03:08:44,190 --> 03:08:45,070
Dang it.

3542
03:08:50,050 --> 03:08:51,610
I messed it all up.

3543
03:08:53,670 --> 03:08:55,210
Okay, so this goes...

3544
03:08:55,910 --> 03:08:58,550
I'm looking for like arrows and I'm not seeing anything.

3545
03:09:00,250 --> 03:09:00,990
Okay, hold on.

3546
03:09:02,350 --> 03:09:03,770
It doesn't go here?

3547
03:09:04,550 --> 03:09:04,810
Okay.

3548
03:09:06,290 --> 03:09:09,210
Oh, this is another spot to dig up.

3549
03:09:10,550 --> 03:09:11,690
Hiding in barrels.

3550
03:09:11,870 --> 03:09:12,450
Just a barrel.

3551
03:09:13,490 --> 03:09:14,910
There's so much going on in here.

3552
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:16,490
Okay.

3553
03:09:17,310 --> 03:09:19,510
Oh, that was some good cash.

3554
03:09:19,730 --> 03:09:20,050
Let's go.

3555
03:09:20,230 --> 03:09:20,410
Okay.

3556
03:09:21,410 --> 03:09:22,650
Let's get over here.

3557
03:09:23,550 --> 03:09:25,050
Let's take all of this.

3558
03:09:26,050 --> 03:09:27,950
Let's get some money, baby.

3559
03:09:33,350 --> 03:09:33,870
Okay.

3560
03:09:37,460 --> 03:09:38,300
All right.

3561
03:09:40,500 --> 03:09:42,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3562
03:09:42,100 --> 03:09:42,320
Okay.

3563
03:09:45,830 --> 03:09:46,010
Hmm.

3564
03:09:46,830 --> 03:09:48,550
Oh, I see here.

3565
03:09:49,070 --> 03:09:49,770
Okay, okay.

3566
03:09:51,070 --> 03:09:52,190
All right, that's one.

3567
03:09:53,150 --> 03:09:55,970
I can't tell if this is, like, to progress or not.

3568
03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:00,960
Come here.

3569
03:10:03,320 --> 03:10:03,880
Alrighty.

3570
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:11,220
Any items you drop, respawn at their...

3571
03:10:11,220 --> 03:10:12,220
Oh, come on.

3572
03:10:12,700 --> 03:10:16,280
original locations to stop them getting stuck in walls, etc.

3573
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:19,060
Oh, that's handy.

3574
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:23,880
I forgot we can destroy all these, too.

3575
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,700
Should have done it when I had the chance.

3576
03:10:33,390 --> 03:10:36,390
Yeah, yeah, destroy, destroy.

3577
03:10:37,710 --> 03:10:39,450
Marion, stay out of my way.

3578
03:10:41,170 --> 03:10:42,950
Wait, what are these for, though?

3579
03:10:44,110 --> 03:10:45,510
I can't tell at all.

3580
03:10:46,370 --> 03:10:48,370
What the crates are for...

3581
03:10:49,490 --> 03:10:50,770
We have two of them.

3582
03:10:59,020 --> 03:10:59,940
Oh, we got another barrel.

3583
03:11:00,400 --> 03:11:00,400
Nice.

3584
03:11:05,330 --> 03:11:06,130
The crane.

3585
03:11:11,210 --> 03:11:12,750
Oh, is it right there?

3586
03:11:15,190 --> 03:11:19,310
Was the thing that it was right next to?

3587
03:11:20,230 --> 03:11:20,690
Are you kidding?

3588
03:11:20,710 --> 03:11:25,410
Are you telling me I've brought this other one all the way over here for nothing?

3589
03:11:32,050 --> 03:11:32,530
Oopsie.

3590
03:11:34,990 --> 03:11:35,470
Whoopsie.

3591
03:11:36,070 --> 03:11:36,550
Whoopsie.

3592
03:11:38,690 --> 03:11:39,170
Yes.

3593
03:11:40,310 --> 03:11:43,270
My point says...

3594
03:11:43,270 --> 03:11:43,650
Nice.

3595
03:11:44,290 --> 03:11:44,910
All right.

3596
03:11:46,510 --> 03:11:47,470
Let's grab...

3597
03:11:47,470 --> 03:11:48,490
Wait, where did I put it?

3598
03:11:48,590 --> 03:11:49,410
Oh, down here, here.

3599
03:11:51,030 --> 03:11:51,610
It's fine.

3600
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:52,950
It's not that far along.

3601
03:11:54,650 --> 03:11:55,550
Mint the flirt.

3602
03:11:56,430 --> 03:11:59,330
What can I say if I see a pretty lady in front of me?

3603
03:12:00,770 --> 03:12:01,810
to smooth your face.

3604
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:03,910
I'm sure we can all relate, huh?

3605
03:12:04,930 --> 03:12:05,790
At least most of us?

3606
03:12:07,390 --> 03:12:09,450
I'm sure many of us can relate.

3607
03:12:10,950 --> 03:12:13,850
Okay, now we gotta power this thing, huh?

3608
03:12:18,550 --> 03:12:18,950
Okay.

3609
03:12:21,070 --> 03:12:22,170
Oh, oops.

3610
03:12:24,510 --> 03:12:24,570
Late.

3611
03:12:25,270 --> 03:12:25,810
Okay, okay.

3612
03:12:25,810 --> 03:12:27,850
Okay, let's, uh, there we go.

3613
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:29,830
Aha!

3614
03:12:30,190 --> 03:12:30,690
Okay, okay.

3615
03:12:31,450 --> 03:12:32,470
What do I do?

3616
03:12:32,670 --> 03:12:32,930
Like,

3617
03:12:36,050 --> 03:12:37,330
Okay, okay.

3618
03:12:38,930 --> 03:12:39,770
I guess that's it?

3619
03:12:43,220 --> 03:12:45,540
Why is it so intense right now?

3620
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:46,920
All of a sudden.

3621
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:52,080
I wonder if we can get to the other side.

3622
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:55,360
Like, there's something flashing over there.

3623
03:12:59,840 --> 03:13:00,560
Will it hurt me?

3624
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:00,980
No?

3625
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:02,320
Hmm.

3626
03:13:06,190 --> 03:13:09,110
I wonder if I picked this up with me on it.

3627
03:13:13,570 --> 03:13:13,970
Whatever.

3628
03:13:25,490 --> 03:13:26,570
Oh my gosh, my depth perception.

3629
03:13:26,730 --> 03:13:28,190
You guys, I really thought I had that.

3630
03:13:30,870 --> 03:13:32,650
I really thought I had that.

3631
03:13:33,050 --> 03:13:33,510
Okay, shadow.

3632
03:13:33,910 --> 03:13:34,110
Yes.

3633
03:13:35,170 --> 03:13:37,630
Follow where my shadow is on the ground.

3634
03:13:39,650 --> 03:13:39,730
Yes.

3635
03:13:45,790 --> 03:13:49,130
Some puzzles can only be completed by pressing Y to control another character.

3636
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:51,070
Oh, oh no!

3637
03:13:51,190 --> 03:13:52,590
We don't have another thing!

3638
03:13:54,690 --> 03:13:56,470
Gosh, there's so much stuff in here.

3639
03:14:01,470 --> 03:14:03,790
There's like a crazy amount of stuff in here.

3640
03:14:04,230 --> 03:14:05,150
Oh, let's get a wrench.

3641
03:14:06,770 --> 03:14:07,730
I'm remembering.

3642
03:14:08,770 --> 03:14:10,330
I saw one...

3643
03:14:11,450 --> 03:14:11,930
Uh...

3644
03:14:11,930 --> 03:14:12,410
Here?

3645
03:14:12,790 --> 03:14:13,110
Yes.

3646
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:18,050
Oh!

3647
03:14:18,270 --> 03:14:20,130
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3648
03:14:22,540 --> 03:14:23,860
And then this does...

3649
03:14:23,860 --> 03:14:24,080
Oh!

3650
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:24,280
Ooh!

3651
03:14:25,240 --> 03:14:25,880
Exciting.

3652
03:14:33,030 --> 03:14:34,290
Am I too fat?

3653
03:14:35,170 --> 03:14:36,050
Oh, it broke!

3654
03:14:37,710 --> 03:14:38,550
Again?

3655
03:14:38,930 --> 03:14:39,190
Wait.

3656
03:14:46,130 --> 03:14:46,690
Okay.

3657
03:14:47,110 --> 03:14:50,770
I guess that's all I needed.

3658
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:00,500
Hmm.

3659
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:02,600
Mm-hmm.

3660
03:15:06,160 --> 03:15:07,280
Okay, but why?

3661
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:08,160
Um...

3662
03:15:08,500 --> 03:15:09,900
I don't know.

3663
03:15:12,280 --> 03:15:17,220
Alright, so where would the last track piece be then?

3664
03:15:22,350 --> 03:15:24,910
Unless I need to push this into that hole.

3665
03:15:29,890 --> 03:15:30,330
Oh yeah.

3666
03:15:32,970 --> 03:15:33,910
Wait, can we go in here?

3667
03:15:34,470 --> 03:15:36,190
Or is it for a small character?

3668
03:15:37,590 --> 03:15:39,010
Yes, only small character.

3669
03:15:42,290 --> 03:15:42,850
Oh!

3670
03:15:43,150 --> 03:15:47,050
But, ah, but, but, but, but, okay, okay.

3671
03:15:48,370 --> 03:15:49,430
Got it, got it.

3672
03:15:49,630 --> 03:15:50,930
I understood the assignment.

3673
03:15:53,810 --> 03:15:54,530
I understood.

3674
03:15:54,990 --> 03:15:55,270
I understood.

3675
03:15:58,070 --> 03:16:01,630
Now we have track.

3676
03:16:03,230 --> 03:16:05,510
Now we gotta go do all this again.

3677
03:16:08,250 --> 03:16:10,070
Some of these, I'm just like, oh my gosh.

3678
03:16:11,350 --> 03:16:13,030
How do I...

3679
03:16:13,150 --> 03:16:14,350
Get in there.

3680
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:15,530
Oh my gosh.

3681
03:16:17,590 --> 03:16:18,310
Depth perception.

3682
03:16:20,030 --> 03:16:20,450
Please.

3683
03:16:25,300 --> 03:16:25,700
Okay.

3684
03:16:26,660 --> 03:16:27,560
Oh my gosh.

3685
03:16:28,720 --> 03:16:31,400
My depth perception is so bad, everybody.

3686
03:16:33,800 --> 03:16:34,520
Okay.

3687
03:16:36,360 --> 03:16:39,040
I keep looking at my shadow and it just...

3688
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:40,640
It doesn't do anything for me.

3689
03:16:43,640 --> 03:16:44,740
Alright, Indy.

3690
03:16:46,680 --> 03:16:47,320
Stop!

3691
03:16:50,300 --> 03:16:51,240
We're building?

3692
03:16:52,160 --> 03:16:53,580
Oh no, we need to dig.

3693
03:16:56,340 --> 03:16:57,660
I forgot the shovel.

3694
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:05,680
Tip for depth perception, look at where your shadow is cast.

3695
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:12,520
Yeah, I said that earlier that I try to do that and I still have trouble.

3696
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:17,480
It's just one of my things, please, you guys.

3697
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:19,520
It's just one of those things.

3698
03:17:20,400 --> 03:17:21,560
I can't help it.

3699
03:17:23,220 --> 03:17:24,100
I try.

3700
03:17:24,560 --> 03:17:25,420
I really do.

3701
03:17:29,590 --> 03:17:29,910
Okay.

3702
03:17:31,150 --> 03:17:31,410
Okay.

3703
03:17:37,400 --> 03:17:37,840
Ender!

3704
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:39,340
Uh-oh.

3705
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:40,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3706
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:41,560
Don't leave.

3707
03:17:42,700 --> 03:17:42,920
Okay.

3708
03:17:43,260 --> 03:17:43,660
We're fine.

3709
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,260
Oh, my gosh.

3710
03:17:44,300 --> 03:17:45,320
She almost fell off.

3711
03:17:45,540 --> 03:17:45,940
Okay.

3712
03:17:53,370 --> 03:17:54,530
Okay, and dig!

3713
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:04,300
I have to go back.

3714
03:18:12,010 --> 03:18:13,210
I actually...

3715
03:18:13,210 --> 03:18:14,750
Does she even need the ladder?

3716
03:18:15,390 --> 03:18:15,810
I wonder.

3717
03:18:16,930 --> 03:18:17,690
Probably not.

3718
03:18:17,870 --> 03:18:19,890
I think she could probably jump high enough to get that.

3719
03:18:20,530 --> 03:18:20,830
Wait.

3720
03:18:21,130 --> 03:18:21,870
Don't do it.

3721
03:18:22,090 --> 03:18:22,430
Marion?

3722
03:18:38,870 --> 03:18:39,470
Marion.

3723
03:18:41,670 --> 03:18:42,270
Marion.

3724
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:44,610
You're lucky.

3725
03:18:44,870 --> 03:18:45,390
You're beautiful.

3726
03:18:46,810 --> 03:18:46,930
Oh.

3727
03:18:49,270 --> 03:18:50,230
One moment, please.

3728
03:18:59,350 --> 03:19:00,650
I found a shortcut.

3729
03:19:02,050 --> 03:19:03,810
Oh yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

3730
03:19:09,460 --> 03:19:09,780
Okay.

3731
03:19:10,520 --> 03:19:11,160
No, please.

3732
03:19:13,140 --> 03:19:14,400
Oh no, no, stop.

3733
03:19:14,920 --> 03:19:16,120
No, stop it, stop it, please.

3734
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:17,620
No, stop.

3735
03:19:18,400 --> 03:19:21,420
Okay, there we go.

3736
03:19:21,580 --> 03:19:22,860
All right, we're fine, we're fine.

3737
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:26,040
All right, and there's a guy up here with a gun who's ready to kill us.

3738
03:19:26,460 --> 03:19:27,440
Take us down.

3739
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:32,600
Cool.

3740
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:36,600
One hit wonder.

3741
03:19:39,100 --> 03:19:40,360
Our little Lego man.

3742
03:19:42,780 --> 03:19:43,100
Woohoo!

3743
03:19:43,720 --> 03:19:44,880
Oh, we're running?

3744
03:19:46,800 --> 03:19:48,380
What are we running for?

3745
03:19:49,820 --> 03:19:51,280
What are we going so fast for?

3746
03:19:53,580 --> 03:19:55,180
Yeah, explode!

3747
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:55,700
Yeah!

3748
03:19:56,400 --> 03:19:56,840
Explode!

3749
03:19:56,840 --> 03:19:57,580
Explode, yeah!

3750
03:19:58,600 --> 03:19:59,560
Blood sport.

3751
03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:02,380
Oh gosh, there's a lot of guys here.

3752
03:20:02,880 --> 03:20:05,620
Oh, that was a guy with a grenade.

3753
03:20:07,180 --> 03:20:08,380
Okay, wait, I can get the hat.

3754
03:20:09,660 --> 03:20:09,920
Nice.

3755
03:20:14,130 --> 03:20:14,930
They'll never know.

3756
03:20:15,030 --> 03:20:16,270
Wait, I lost my hair.

3757
03:20:18,050 --> 03:20:20,030
I lost my hair.

3758
03:20:22,990 --> 03:20:23,310
Okay.

3759
03:20:24,250 --> 03:20:25,170
Very good.

3760
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:26,970
Very good.

3761
03:20:29,490 --> 03:20:31,810
But we probably need that to get inside, huh?

3762
03:20:31,990 --> 03:20:36,510
We need to fool them because they're stupid dummies.

3763
03:20:42,660 --> 03:20:43,500
Is this what I'm hearing?

3764
03:20:47,860 --> 03:20:50,680
Hit a ramp or press B when riding motorbikes.

3765
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:52,280
Whoa!

3766
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:55,240
Where's a ramp at?

3767
03:21:08,130 --> 03:21:08,850
Oh,

3768
03:21:11,930 --> 03:21:12,770
you jerk.

3769
03:21:14,290 --> 03:21:14,690
Indy,

3770
03:21:18,210 --> 03:21:18,710
take them out!

3771
03:21:27,690 --> 03:21:29,110
Okay, very good.

3772
03:21:29,590 --> 03:21:30,170
Good job, team.

3773
03:21:31,330 --> 03:21:33,290
Oh, I'm stuck in here for some reason.

3774
03:21:36,230 --> 03:21:37,930
Okay, yeah, I got him.

3775
03:21:38,610 --> 03:21:39,510
Indy, get their hat.

3776
03:21:40,290 --> 03:21:40,970
Indy, get the hat.

3777
03:21:41,750 --> 03:21:42,510
Yeah, you put it on too.

3778
03:21:42,550 --> 03:21:44,070
Okay, now we're both in disguise.

3779
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:50,650
Ah, we lost our disguises!

3780
03:21:54,250 --> 03:21:59,330
I think at one point, I did not even realize what I was pressing.

3781
03:22:00,630 --> 03:22:02,290
And I just kept switching between them.

3782
03:22:02,610 --> 03:22:03,550
This is my bad.

3783
03:22:04,070 --> 03:22:04,790
I'm so stupid.

3784
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:05,410
Like that?

3785
03:22:05,530 --> 03:22:06,270
That's what I was doing.

3786
03:22:08,050 --> 03:22:12,390
I didn't even realize what I was what I was pressing.

3787
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:16,310
Oh, Marion, don't stand in the way.

3788
03:22:18,210 --> 03:22:20,310
I was going like this trying to beat them up.

3789
03:22:24,050 --> 03:22:27,310
Is this one of those Areas where they just don't stop coming.

3790
03:22:30,650 --> 03:22:31,810
There's another bike.

3791
03:22:31,970 --> 03:22:33,030
We can both ride.

3792
03:22:34,370 --> 03:22:35,310
Ow, jaw.

3793
03:22:37,770 --> 03:22:38,190
Please.

3794
03:22:39,070 --> 03:22:41,610
I just want to, I want to explore a little.

3795
03:22:42,830 --> 03:22:43,170
Please.

3796
03:22:47,770 --> 03:22:48,990
They don't stop coming.

3797
03:22:49,130 --> 03:22:49,950
They don't stop coming.

3798
03:22:50,590 --> 03:22:52,070
I wish I could grab the grenade, huh?

3799
03:22:54,110 --> 03:22:55,270
It'd be pretty nice.

3800
03:22:59,170 --> 03:23:00,570
Ouch.

3801
03:23:02,890 --> 03:23:04,390
I lost my hat.

3802
03:23:10,250 --> 03:23:13,050
You glorious!

3803
03:23:16,430 --> 03:23:17,130
Simpleton!

3804
03:23:18,290 --> 03:23:18,510
Yeah!

3805
03:23:21,210 --> 03:23:21,870
Nice.

3806
03:23:23,010 --> 03:23:23,470
Wait.

3807
03:23:24,510 --> 03:23:24,990
Some

3808
03:23:31,440 --> 03:23:32,580
dumb stupid head.

3809
03:23:33,480 --> 03:23:34,260
that up.

3810
03:23:37,870 --> 03:23:41,130
Surely they'll stop eventually, huh?

3811
03:23:41,870 --> 03:23:43,370
Alright, I think we just need to move onwards.

3812
03:23:44,030 --> 03:23:46,010
Oh my gosh, I think we just need to move onwards.

3813
03:23:46,410 --> 03:23:48,070
Oh, Indy, you lost your heart!

3814
03:23:49,970 --> 03:23:50,990
Okay, or?

3815
03:23:51,870 --> 03:23:52,450
They're gone?

3816
03:23:53,110 --> 03:23:53,970
I don't think so.

3817
03:23:55,070 --> 03:23:55,510
Nope.

3818
03:23:55,950 --> 03:23:56,350
Let's go.

3819
03:24:02,390 --> 03:24:02,730
Ah!

3820
03:24:02,930 --> 03:24:03,110
Oh!

3821
03:24:03,570 --> 03:24:04,770
Okay, that wasn't...

3822
03:24:04,770 --> 03:24:06,430
That didn't go as I planned.

3823
03:24:07,990 --> 03:24:09,290
Okay, neither did that.

3824
03:24:14,460 --> 03:24:15,560
How do I get off the bike?

3825
03:24:16,480 --> 03:24:17,520
Wait, how do I get off the bike?

3826
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:21,760
Get off the bike.

3827
03:24:22,660 --> 03:24:23,240
Get off the bike.

3828
03:24:23,740 --> 03:24:24,500
There we go.

3829
03:24:25,820 --> 03:24:27,880
Okay, let's build this, whatever it is.

3830
03:24:30,940 --> 03:24:31,820
It's not why.

3831
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:34,620
Why is not to get off the bike, in case you were curious.

3832
03:24:35,780 --> 03:24:37,080
It's definitely not why.

3833
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:39,860
Alright, that's one thing.

3834
03:24:42,580 --> 03:24:43,340
What's this?

3835
03:24:44,080 --> 03:24:45,060
Ooh, okay.

3836
03:24:48,160 --> 03:24:51,000
I'm gonna beat up everything in your park!

3837
03:24:57,980 --> 03:24:59,520
I'm gonna destroy your tables!

3838
03:24:59,800 --> 03:25:01,120
You'll never eat again!

3839
03:25:02,280 --> 03:25:02,720
Yeah!

3840
03:25:03,060 --> 03:25:04,980
You'll never sit down for a nice meal!

3841
03:25:06,320 --> 03:25:07,280
You'll never...

3842
03:25:07,280 --> 03:25:08,040
Oh, sorry, Indy.

3843
03:25:08,120 --> 03:25:09,040
I thought you were them.

3844
03:25:12,140 --> 03:25:15,460
Yeah, it's why to get on, but you have to jump to get off.

3845
03:25:20,690 --> 03:25:22,350
They'll never enjoy peace.

3846
03:25:22,530 --> 03:25:23,750
They'll never have peace again.

3847
03:25:24,630 --> 03:25:25,330
Wait, what's this for?

3848
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:30,820
Where does this go?

3849
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:32,980
Oh, hello.

3850
03:25:35,460 --> 03:25:37,060
I just jumped off and...

3851
03:25:39,200 --> 03:25:40,480
Okay, silly.

3852
03:25:41,500 --> 03:25:42,100
Other way.

3853
03:25:42,500 --> 03:25:42,840
This way?

3854
03:25:43,700 --> 03:25:45,020
Yeah, they're gonna starve!

3855
03:25:45,200 --> 03:25:46,080
They're gonna starve!

3856
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:50,040
Oh my god, I dig that up too.

3857
03:25:51,520 --> 03:25:52,040
Hmm.

3858
03:25:52,060 --> 03:25:54,060
Let's see if...

3859
03:25:57,490 --> 03:25:58,230
Minecraft.

3860
03:26:02,710 --> 03:26:05,370
They will never have another drink of water again!

3861
03:26:09,550 --> 03:26:11,080
It's a ladder piece.

3862
03:26:12,320 --> 03:26:13,740
Like the ladder...

3863
03:26:15,100 --> 03:26:15,520
Oh.

3864
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:21,820
Wait.

3865
03:26:23,400 --> 03:26:24,700
Oh my gosh, so close.

3866
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:29,360
Okay.

3867
03:26:30,080 --> 03:26:30,360
Cool.

3868
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:34,360
Okay, now I'm turning.

3869
03:26:37,880 --> 03:26:38,560
Well, okay.

3870
03:26:38,980 --> 03:26:39,480
Now stop.

3871
03:26:40,160 --> 03:26:40,380
Alright.

3872
03:26:40,960 --> 03:26:41,960
Now jump.

3873
03:26:42,780 --> 03:26:43,300
And jump.

3874
03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:47,500
She's a platforming god.

3875
03:26:48,500 --> 03:26:50,020
Wait, I don't have another piece, though.

3876
03:26:54,070 --> 03:26:55,650
I don't have the last one that we need.

3877
03:26:55,810 --> 03:26:56,070
Oh, wait.

3878
03:26:56,110 --> 03:26:56,650
It's a lever.

3879
03:26:56,850 --> 03:26:57,230
Just kidding.

3880
03:26:59,010 --> 03:26:59,410
Yippee!

3881
03:27:01,070 --> 03:27:01,570
Okay.

3882
03:27:06,430 --> 03:27:07,250
Oh, right, what's this?

3883
03:27:08,370 --> 03:27:09,350
I got a gun.

3884
03:27:10,950 --> 03:27:12,690
I got a bigger gun.

3885
03:27:14,490 --> 03:27:15,410
Was it the ladder?

3886
03:27:19,850 --> 03:27:21,350
Not this ladder, right?

3887
03:27:22,370 --> 03:27:23,410
Ladder piece.

3888
03:27:24,210 --> 03:27:25,530
Piece to what ladder?

3889
03:27:26,970 --> 03:27:27,370
Ew.

3890
03:27:28,130 --> 03:27:30,090
There's that over there, that green thing.

3891
03:27:30,250 --> 03:27:31,170
Oh, wait, it is over here.

3892
03:27:31,510 --> 03:27:32,130
I see it.

3893
03:27:33,250 --> 03:27:33,950
I see it.

3894
03:27:34,070 --> 03:27:34,490
I see it.

3895
03:27:36,950 --> 03:27:37,990
So nostalgic.

3896
03:27:38,470 --> 03:27:39,090
Where is it?

3897
03:27:40,610 --> 03:27:42,650
And then I guess I get this one too.

3898
03:27:46,650 --> 03:27:47,390
Grab it?

3899
03:27:49,450 --> 03:27:50,010
Okay.

3900
03:27:51,790 --> 03:27:55,450
I want to become a grand adventurer or I need to take more money.

3901
03:27:57,350 --> 03:27:57,550
Alright.

3902
03:27:58,190 --> 03:28:00,850
So let's beat things up and take more money.

3903
03:28:01,730 --> 03:28:01,990
Yeah!

3904
03:28:04,610 --> 03:28:07,330
Oh, uh, jump?

3905
03:28:10,130 --> 03:28:10,870
Is it the other side?

3906
03:28:11,910 --> 03:28:12,110
Wait.

3907
03:28:12,570 --> 03:28:14,190
Do I not know how to use a ladder?

3908
03:28:14,770 --> 03:28:14,970
Wait.

3909
03:28:17,370 --> 03:28:18,450
Oh, there we go.

3910
03:28:18,810 --> 03:28:19,370
Like, hello?

3911
03:28:22,330 --> 03:28:24,370
How do I open this up?

3912
03:28:26,370 --> 03:28:26,750
Hmm.

3913
03:28:30,710 --> 03:28:30,990
Hmm.

3914
03:28:36,040 --> 03:28:38,360
We gotta explode it, I think.

3915
03:28:39,780 --> 03:28:40,640
Also, look at this.

3916
03:28:40,700 --> 03:28:41,740
This explodes too.

3917
03:28:43,120 --> 03:28:45,180
I don't think we have any explodies, though.

3918
03:28:47,220 --> 03:28:59,730
maybe over over here but I'm a maybe guys have stopped spawning let's check it out

3919
03:29:04,040 --> 03:29:08,550
oh my bad oh no they have not okay let's leave

3920
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:20,860
okay okay oh sorry oh

3921
03:29:28,730 --> 03:29:30,490
Okay, we ignore that area?

3922
03:29:30,750 --> 03:29:31,090
It sucks.

3923
03:29:37,090 --> 03:29:39,310
Wait, but what's this way?

3924
03:29:40,610 --> 03:29:40,870
Oh.

3925
03:29:43,070 --> 03:29:45,030
How do I get in here?

3926
03:29:45,390 --> 03:29:47,650
To their little relaxation area.

3927
03:29:49,350 --> 03:29:50,410
Oh, let's not.

3928
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:00,780
Secret area.

3929
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:03,680
Okay, I'm going to...

3930
03:30:03,700 --> 03:30:05,860
I'm gonna get on my bike and see you, Indy.

3931
03:30:07,380 --> 03:30:07,440
Oh.

3932
03:30:13,030 --> 03:30:14,410
Oh, wait, is this fight?

3933
03:30:17,270 --> 03:30:17,470
Ah!

3934
03:30:18,510 --> 03:30:19,430
Hold on, I was taking a sip!

3935
03:30:21,010 --> 03:30:22,550
Oh my gosh, we actually have to...

3936
03:30:22,550 --> 03:30:22,770
Oh!

3937
03:30:23,750 --> 03:30:23,950
Woo!

3938
03:30:30,410 --> 03:30:30,810
Oops.

3939
03:30:40,410 --> 03:30:41,050
What's over here?

3940
03:30:42,090 --> 03:30:42,790
What is this?

3941
03:30:43,690 --> 03:30:45,550
Is this to throw at him?

3942
03:30:46,770 --> 03:30:48,110
Oh, okay, just kidding.

3943
03:30:49,510 --> 03:30:50,150
What is this?

3944
03:30:50,990 --> 03:30:52,550
I don't have...

3945
03:30:54,070 --> 03:30:55,270
Fists are flying.

3946
03:30:55,770 --> 03:30:56,830
Yeah, absolutely.

3947
03:30:58,910 --> 03:31:00,550
Oh, wait, I think this goes...

3948
03:31:01,550 --> 03:31:07,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it does not go up here?

3949
03:31:11,490 --> 03:31:12,870
We'll leave it alone for now.

3950
03:31:13,590 --> 03:31:15,410
I like how he just stays within the circle.

3951
03:31:16,730 --> 03:31:17,630
He's like, what is it?

3952
03:31:17,670 --> 03:31:18,630
He's like a sea bear.

3953
03:31:18,830 --> 03:31:19,570
He can't leave.

3954
03:31:23,290 --> 03:31:25,290
Hold it and give him a punch?

3955
03:31:26,310 --> 03:31:28,590
Well, I tried to throw it at him, but I guess he can't really...

3956
03:31:28,590 --> 03:31:31,610
Wait, can I grab this and throw this at him?

3957
03:31:32,790 --> 03:31:34,410
From outside the circle.

3958
03:31:35,250 --> 03:31:36,370
How devilish would that be?

3959
03:31:38,950 --> 03:31:39,210
Hello?

3960
03:31:40,650 --> 03:31:40,890
Oh.

3961
03:31:41,730 --> 03:31:42,230
Okay.

3962
03:31:47,380 --> 03:31:48,880
This has got to be the key.

3963
03:31:52,330 --> 03:31:52,830
Okay.

3964
03:31:58,910 --> 03:31:59,790
I

3965
03:32:03,170 --> 03:32:04,770
don't like that.

3966
03:32:05,930 --> 03:32:07,350
Wait, are there reinforcements?

3967
03:32:08,170 --> 03:32:09,530
Messed up!

3968
03:32:12,880 --> 03:32:13,300
Hey!

3969
03:32:15,180 --> 03:32:17,140
Oh my gosh, there's so many of them.

3970
03:32:19,900 --> 03:32:21,700
Stop shooting me!

3971
03:32:23,140 --> 03:32:24,940
I wish I could shoot this guy.

3972
03:32:27,860 --> 03:32:28,740
Okay.

3973
03:32:29,480 --> 03:32:30,000
Okay.

3974
03:32:30,020 --> 03:32:35,100
All right, I have nothing to repair that.

3975
03:32:35,700 --> 03:32:38,500
I need more stuff to pick up, I guess.

3976
03:32:39,660 --> 03:32:41,060
Do I have anything to pick up?

3977
03:32:53,510 --> 03:32:54,790
He's bulletproof.

3978
03:32:54,930 --> 03:32:56,570
He's bulletproof.

3979
03:32:57,310 --> 03:32:58,990
Nothing that moves.

3980
03:32:59,710 --> 03:33:02,970
Fire away, fire away.

3981
03:33:03,870 --> 03:33:05,190
Ring and chain.

3982
03:33:05,950 --> 03:33:07,190
Everything you're right.

3983
03:33:08,370 --> 03:33:09,730
I have no supplies.

3984
03:33:10,410 --> 03:33:12,250
Slow supplies.

3985
03:33:19,730 --> 03:33:21,590
Maybe in the truck.

3986
03:33:26,240 --> 03:33:26,540
Oh.

3987
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:28,480
Just shooting.

3988
03:33:28,980 --> 03:33:29,560
Willy nilly.

3989
03:33:33,880 --> 03:33:34,060
Ah.

3990
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:36,080
Huh?

3991
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:40,660
Is there anything else to get him with?

3992
03:33:41,600 --> 03:33:42,380
Am I crazy?

3993
03:33:46,890 --> 03:33:48,830
Can you use the plane?

3994
03:33:50,130 --> 03:33:51,090
Oh, oh gosh.

3995
03:33:51,330 --> 03:33:52,390
I can...

3996
03:33:53,790 --> 03:33:54,230
Attempt.

3997
03:33:55,870 --> 03:33:57,010
It does not let me in it.

3998
03:33:57,230 --> 03:33:57,590
Oh, God.

3999
03:34:07,970 --> 03:34:10,350
The big water canister on the bottom right.

4000
03:34:10,550 --> 03:34:10,910
This?

4001
03:34:11,450 --> 03:34:12,450
I can't fix it, though.

4002
03:34:12,470 --> 03:34:13,170
I have no supply.

4003
03:34:13,210 --> 03:34:14,150
I don't have a wrench.

4004
03:34:15,090 --> 03:34:15,930
What about the tree?

4005
03:34:18,990 --> 03:34:19,870
Oh, wait.

4006
03:34:23,130 --> 03:34:24,010
Maybe this?

4007
03:34:28,190 --> 03:34:29,050
I can try.

4008
03:34:30,270 --> 03:34:30,810
Oh, nope.

4009
03:34:31,470 --> 03:34:31,710
Oh.

4010
03:34:32,450 --> 03:34:34,410
Wait, this goes to this up here!

4011
03:34:35,350 --> 03:34:35,530
Ouch!

4012
03:34:36,170 --> 03:34:37,190
No, that's my thing, please.

4013
03:34:37,770 --> 03:34:38,510
Stop punching us!

4014
03:34:39,970 --> 03:34:41,470
Okay, we're fine.

4015
03:34:41,830 --> 03:34:42,250
Everything is okay.

4016
03:34:43,290 --> 03:34:45,610
I remember there was a part over here.

4017
03:34:45,830 --> 03:34:47,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, up there.

4018
03:34:51,030 --> 03:34:54,770
Can you get- when I got in the plane, it hopped me right out.

4019
03:34:56,410 --> 03:34:59,750
Like, he sat in there for two seconds and then he jumped out.

4020
03:35:04,220 --> 03:35:04,880
No, no, no.

4021
03:35:06,620 --> 03:35:08,260
Oh, I can't do anything yet.

4022
03:35:08,900 --> 03:35:10,440
Is there anything else?

4023
03:35:18,390 --> 03:35:19,690
Oh, there's one.

4024
03:35:20,290 --> 03:35:20,570
Okay.

4025
03:35:21,290 --> 03:35:22,210
Got another one.

4026
03:35:22,830 --> 03:35:23,690
Gotta keep destroying.

4027
03:35:24,930 --> 03:35:25,730
Destroy to create.

4028
03:35:25,990 --> 03:35:26,730
Destroy to create.

4029
03:35:28,290 --> 03:35:31,510
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey.

4030
03:35:32,970 --> 03:35:33,650
Let's see.

4031
03:35:35,170 --> 03:35:35,810
You!

4032
03:35:36,230 --> 03:35:36,610
No.

4033
03:35:37,690 --> 03:35:38,670
Where else?

4034
03:35:38,890 --> 03:35:39,150
You!

4035
03:35:39,490 --> 03:35:39,590
You!

4036
03:35:40,150 --> 03:35:40,690
You!

4037
03:35:43,510 --> 03:35:45,270
Hmm, over here.

4038
03:35:46,510 --> 03:35:46,910
Eew!

4039
03:35:48,830 --> 03:35:51,190
You would think that if this was one of them...

4040
03:35:51,190 --> 03:35:52,530
Oh wait, hold on, maybe you.

4041
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:57,200
No.

4042
03:36:01,030 --> 03:36:02,210
Okay, never mind.

4043
03:36:03,930 --> 03:36:08,050
If it's buried there, I don't have any way of getting it out.

4044
03:36:08,190 --> 03:36:08,830
That's the issue.

4045
03:36:10,250 --> 03:36:11,770
Unless I can't explode.

4046
03:36:13,990 --> 03:36:15,630
I'm running out of options here.

4047
03:36:16,770 --> 03:36:18,370
Let's try to get in these.

4048
03:36:21,790 --> 03:36:23,450
They don't give me any tools.

4049
03:36:25,350 --> 03:36:26,410
It's definitely the plane.

4050
03:36:26,690 --> 03:36:27,450
You think so?

4051
03:36:32,560 --> 03:36:34,440
Let's see what's in here real quick.

4052
03:36:36,880 --> 03:36:37,980
Okay, not the...

4053
03:36:37,980 --> 03:36:38,280
Oh, wait.

4054
03:36:38,320 --> 03:36:39,040
There's one more tree.

4055
03:36:45,770 --> 03:36:46,790
Not the tree.

4056
03:36:59,020 --> 03:36:59,440
Oh.

4057
03:37:01,980 --> 03:37:03,340
Oh, I gotta run him over.

4058
03:37:03,360 --> 03:37:03,720
Maybe?

4059
03:37:04,340 --> 03:37:05,320
Marion, are you okay?

4060
03:37:11,840 --> 03:37:12,460
Um...

4061
03:37:15,540 --> 03:37:16,160
Uh...

4062
03:37:19,360 --> 03:37:22,740
Yeah, in the movie, you get him...

4063
03:37:22,740 --> 03:37:23,400
What?

4064
03:37:24,340 --> 03:37:24,960
Um...

4065
03:37:24,960 --> 03:37:26,320
Okay, wait, okay.

4066
03:37:28,420 --> 03:37:29,560
Do you hear it honking?

4067
03:37:29,880 --> 03:37:30,420
It's so funny.

4068
03:37:31,260 --> 03:37:31,880
Okay, hold on.

4069
03:37:31,980 --> 03:37:32,500
Oh!

4070
03:37:39,050 --> 03:37:40,010
Oh my gosh.

4071
03:37:40,310 --> 03:37:40,610
Please.

4072
03:37:41,450 --> 03:37:41,890
Please.

4073
03:37:43,710 --> 03:37:44,330
Wait!

4074
03:37:45,190 --> 03:37:45,630
No!

4075
03:37:55,440 --> 03:37:55,820
Oh!

4076
03:38:04,620 --> 03:38:05,960
Is that the last thing we needed?

4077
03:38:06,540 --> 03:38:06,780
Maybe.

4078
03:38:10,160 --> 03:38:13,120
I want to also beat up the other thing though.

4079
03:38:13,440 --> 03:38:14,080
Okay, cool.

4080
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:22,340
Nice, okay, that's another one.

4081
03:38:24,220 --> 03:38:25,480
Marion, you can do the honors.

4082
03:38:25,680 --> 03:38:26,140
Oh, just kidding.

4083
03:38:28,680 --> 03:38:30,620
Okay, Indy, you can do the honors.

4084
03:38:32,660 --> 03:38:34,020
Oh, he's a little feast!

4085
03:38:34,560 --> 03:38:35,440
Oh, oh!

4086
03:38:36,740 --> 03:38:37,100
Oops.

4087
03:38:39,800 --> 03:38:41,320
Oh, no, there's more guys!

4088
03:38:43,720 --> 03:38:44,460
Oh, my gosh!

4089
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:50,440
Oh, my gosh.

4090
03:38:53,920 --> 03:38:54,460
Oh, my gosh.

4091
03:38:55,140 --> 03:38:55,580
Oh, my gosh.

4092
03:38:56,280 --> 03:38:56,820
Oh, my gosh.

4093
03:38:57,680 --> 03:38:58,560
Oh, I need that heart.

4094
03:38:58,980 --> 03:38:59,300
Never mind.

4095
03:39:02,300 --> 03:39:02,640
Nucky!

4096
03:39:06,600 --> 03:39:07,080
Alright.

4097
03:39:07,640 --> 03:39:08,460
Now we do the plane.

4098
03:39:08,600 --> 03:39:08,840
Okay.

4099
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:10,180
I'm understanding.

4100
03:39:16,050 --> 03:39:19,130
You would think that I could blow him up with the, you know.

4101
03:39:23,290 --> 03:39:25,790
With the, uh, plan, but...

4102
03:39:27,910 --> 03:39:28,450
I guess that...

4103
03:39:28,450 --> 03:39:30,010
Oh, sick moves, Marion.

4104
03:39:30,990 --> 03:39:32,130
That doesn't really work, clone.

4105
03:39:35,350 --> 03:39:37,470
I will do the honors this time.

4106
03:39:40,310 --> 03:39:40,870
Yes!

4107
03:39:41,390 --> 03:39:42,410
Little hand!

4108
03:39:43,150 --> 03:39:48,410
Oh, see, I wanted to kill him myself, but, oh, wow, decapitation.

4109
03:39:51,450 --> 03:39:52,910
I tried to get him with the propellers.

4110
03:39:53,130 --> 03:39:53,950
It was too difficult.

4111
03:40:08,760 --> 03:40:10,780
Your eyes, everybody, yeah, look away.

4112
03:40:11,540 --> 03:40:12,940
Oh, what's happening here?

4113
03:40:18,730 --> 03:40:19,070
Okay.

4114
03:40:21,710 --> 03:40:22,590
Oh, not good.

4115
03:40:23,530 --> 03:40:24,390
Indy, out of the way.

4116
03:40:25,110 --> 03:40:26,190
Indy, I'm gonna kill you.

4117
03:40:26,570 --> 03:40:28,670
I think

4118
03:40:33,590 --> 03:40:34,550
maybe I should be ND.

4119
03:40:36,610 --> 03:40:36,750
Oh!

4120
03:40:37,270 --> 03:40:37,510
Oh!

4121
03:40:44,110 --> 03:40:44,850
We're fine.

4122
03:40:45,730 --> 03:40:46,870
Nah, maybe I won't be ND.

4123
03:40:47,990 --> 03:40:48,130
When?

4124
03:40:48,250 --> 03:40:48,470
Oh!

4125
03:40:50,630 --> 03:40:51,890
We can drive!

4126
03:40:54,230 --> 03:40:55,110
Okay, nice.

4127
03:40:56,090 --> 03:40:56,530
Interesting.

4128
03:40:56,830 --> 03:40:57,230
Okay, fine.

4129
03:40:57,910 --> 03:40:59,390
Wait, I'm gonna be...

4130
03:40:59,390 --> 03:41:00,310
Oh, oops.

4131
03:41:01,150 --> 03:41:01,810
I think I fell.

4132
03:41:02,770 --> 03:41:03,450
Where am I?

4133
03:41:03,570 --> 03:41:04,030
Oh, hello.

4134
03:41:05,830 --> 03:41:11,010
I like having a shovel to uh, you know, to bonk people with.

4135
03:41:11,110 --> 03:41:11,930
I think that's a lot of fun.

4136
03:41:15,110 --> 03:41:16,770
And we're driving, we're driving.

4137
03:41:17,190 --> 03:41:17,970
I'm accelerating.

4138
03:41:22,520 --> 03:41:25,360
How nice of them to just kind of like let us in, you know?

4139
03:41:29,580 --> 03:41:30,160
Who's that?

4140
03:41:30,660 --> 03:41:32,100
Wait, I'll take it!

4141
03:41:32,280 --> 03:41:32,820
Give it to me!

4142
03:41:33,120 --> 03:41:33,380
Yes!

4143
03:41:36,800 --> 03:41:38,480
That guy doesn't even...

4144
03:41:38,480 --> 03:41:39,640
That guy was just standing there.

4145
03:41:39,800 --> 03:41:41,300
He had no clue what was coming to him.

4146
03:41:42,880 --> 03:41:43,940
And drive the car.

4147
03:41:44,700 --> 03:41:45,180
Drive the car.

4148
03:41:45,680 --> 03:41:46,240
Drive the car.

4149
03:41:46,400 --> 03:41:47,120
Somebody drive the car.

4150
03:41:47,360 --> 03:41:48,060
Somebody get in the car.

4151
03:41:48,580 --> 03:41:49,580
Somebody get in the car.

4152
03:41:49,800 --> 03:41:50,640
Indy, get in the car.

4153
03:41:52,920 --> 03:41:53,660
Treasure get!

4154
03:41:54,860 --> 03:41:55,660
We're accelerating.

4155
03:41:59,340 --> 03:42:00,180
There it is!

4156
03:42:12,720 --> 03:42:14,140
Yeah, come over here if you're so...

4157
03:42:14,160 --> 03:42:15,500
I think Indy died.

4158
03:42:16,540 --> 03:42:17,880
And I come over here if you're so tough.

4159
03:42:18,300 --> 03:42:21,480
I love the way they just stand there and smile like default Lego men.

4160
03:42:21,820 --> 03:42:22,020
You know?

4161
03:42:22,400 --> 03:42:22,600
Oops.

4162
03:42:26,020 --> 03:42:26,240
Oh.

4163
03:42:30,560 --> 03:42:32,240
I don't think I can make it.

4164
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:33,740
Oh, yes I can.

4165
03:42:35,900 --> 03:42:36,340
Indy?

4166
03:42:36,780 --> 03:42:37,700
Indy, where'd you go?

4167
03:42:40,260 --> 03:42:40,460
Oh.

4168
03:42:42,420 --> 03:42:44,040
Alright, let's get in the car.

4169
03:42:44,240 --> 03:42:45,460
Let's drive this thing.

4170
03:42:46,200 --> 03:42:47,960
Get in the car, Shinji!

4171
03:42:52,190 --> 03:42:52,950
Ah,

4172
03:42:56,730 --> 03:42:57,790
run him off the road!

4173
03:43:01,260 --> 03:43:04,320
Uh-oh, nobody secured this thing.

4174
03:43:05,880 --> 03:43:09,620
Oh, oh!

4175
03:43:16,260 --> 03:43:18,860
Is that her bedroom wear?

4176
03:43:20,880 --> 03:43:21,420
Indy!

4177
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:23,220
Indy, take a hint!

4178
03:43:23,560 --> 03:43:24,900
Lego Marion is horny!

4179
03:43:34,470 --> 03:43:36,910
Oh my god.

4180
03:43:41,230 --> 03:43:43,670
They can never catch a break, huh?

4181
03:43:51,310 --> 03:43:52,230
Indy!

4182
03:44:01,140 --> 03:44:03,080
Oh my gosh.

4183
03:44:12,480 --> 03:44:14,780
Guys, I'm actually so tired.

4184
03:44:15,800 --> 03:44:17,460
I forgot about that noise.

4185
03:44:20,020 --> 03:44:22,100
I want to beat this one, but I'm actually so...

4186
03:44:22,100 --> 03:44:23,920
I'm getting a headache, unfortunately.

4187
03:44:25,400 --> 03:44:28,000
Oh, well, I've had one since, like, a couple episodes ago.

4188
03:44:30,680 --> 03:44:31,800
It's been a long one.

4189
03:44:31,900 --> 03:44:32,240
Yeah.

4190
03:44:33,120 --> 03:44:34,540
I am pretty tired.

4191
03:44:35,460 --> 03:44:36,600
I am pretty tired.

4192
03:44:36,800 --> 03:44:38,740
I didn't expect to feel so icky.

4193
03:44:40,520 --> 03:44:42,100
But I am having so much fun.

4194
03:44:42,620 --> 03:44:43,700
Wait, no, not the movie room.

4195
03:44:45,200 --> 03:44:46,780
Let's go buy some more people.

4196
03:44:47,540 --> 03:44:48,130
There we go.

4197
03:44:53,890 --> 03:44:54,490
Buy everybody.

4198
03:44:57,690 --> 03:44:58,350
Buy everyone.

4199
03:45:01,950 --> 03:45:02,190
Meow.

4200
03:45:07,740 --> 03:45:09,320
So close to greatness!

4201
03:45:11,840 --> 03:45:15,500
I really wanted to beat the first wine, but...

4202
03:45:15,500 --> 03:45:15,840
That's okay.

4203
03:45:18,140 --> 03:45:21,020
We next time can beat it, and then we can...

4204
03:45:21,040 --> 03:45:30,900
I'll actually know how this is, how it works a bit more so we can beat Temple of Doom as well.

4205
03:45:32,520 --> 03:45:33,300
Yes, yes, yes.

4206
03:45:36,300 --> 03:45:39,160
Oh, this has been a lot of fun.

4207
03:45:40,200 --> 03:45:41,440
I love Covenant of the Ark.

4208
03:45:43,880 --> 03:45:46,760
I can't wait to see how they do the opening of the Ark.

4209
03:45:47,640 --> 03:45:49,380
Like how the little spirits will work.

4210
03:45:50,780 --> 03:45:53,680
Tomorrow, I have a big, big announcement.

4211
03:45:54,540 --> 03:45:55,980
