1
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,550
It's literally all over.

2
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,930
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,590
Hold on.

4
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,610
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

5
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,570
I'm muted right now but...

6
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,610
Welcome to Zort!

7
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,650
I'm playing today with LimeDoki, Snuffie, we're the Sluppy Sisters!

8
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,230
Ok, I just wanted to say hi.

9
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,930
I just did another stream and I did the fastest dinner and the fastest pee.

10
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,130
And I didn't do my time.

11
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:53,870
Anyway.

12
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,390
Ok, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna unmute now.

13
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,730
Me?

14
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,790
No, it's like, here, I can show you, like, how it looks.

15
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,850
Hold on, this is the way that it booted up for me.

16
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,750
Oh, it didn't actually capture properly, it just captured my full desktop and I'm gonna leak everything.

17
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,310
Nevermind.

18
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,610
Yo,

19
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,610
those slurs that I have saved as text files on my desktop.

20
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,050
It's literally just your desktop wallpaper, like, you're like, my favorite words.

21
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,430
My favorite words!

22
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,430
It's your desktop wallpaper.

23
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,550
All the gamer words.

24
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,690
Is this a scary game?

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,630
No, it's basketball.

26
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,810
Oh, it is?

27
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,790
Yeah.

28
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,950
There's a cat wearing a Santa hat.

29
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,830
When was the last time this...

30
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,290
That's the only reason why I picked this game.

31
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,150
You can play basketball in this game.

32
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,970
How do you even find these games?

33
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,190
I saw...

34
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,750
This is crazy.

35
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:25,330
You know, like, I always stalked a popular upcoming on Steam, and I saw this game before a while back, and I looked at the reviews.

36
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,650
It had 7,000 reviews, so I assume it's, like, okay.

37
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,510
Maybe if I do return to lobby, I don't know, it seriously won't let me invite...

38
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,110
It says something weird.

39
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:47,170
It says, host from here if you want to play local with your IP or offline, forward port 777 TCP and UDP for other players to join.

40
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,510
Your other game's progress will still be saved.

41
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,790
Nah, we gotta do this the Minecraft 2008 way, bro.

42
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,950
We gotta boot up Hamachi.

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,270
Yeah, let me boot up fuckin' Hamachi.

44
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,170
So, like, clearly you can play online.

45
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,130
Yeah, we just gotta port forward.

46
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,970
Wait, hold on.

47
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,850
Oh, dang.

48
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,410
I guess I have to play Ultimate Rec.

49
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,830
Cheap.

50
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,490
Oh, I figured it out.

51
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,750
I clicked the port.

52
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,130
I didn't click anything.

53
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,490
Wait, so you ported it.

54
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,170
You actually ported it?

55
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,910
How?

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,570
Oh, I can join you now.

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,990
Wait, what?

58
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,270
Mint just opening up holes in her router in real time.

59
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,970
Thank you, Mint.

60
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,330
Oh my gosh, you opened the port.

61
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,850
We're in her PC, guys.

62
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,590
We're in it.

63
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,850
Oh, there's local audio.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,890
Do we want to use that instead?

65
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,810
We should use in-game.

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,670
Oh, we should do the pro streamer thing where we turn all of our individual vids to zero so our foogies will still light up.

67
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,850
Oh, you have foogies?

68
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,570
Oh, okay.

69
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,270
Yeah, of course.

70
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,450
You don't have foogies?

71
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,650
Get muted.

72
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,550
Okay, give me a sec.

73
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,230
I need to write down what I have on your Discord.

74
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,190
Oh, right.

75
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,830
I didn't actually check that, so I'm super close.

76
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,730
How are you guys doing a thing on Discord where your foogies still light up?

77
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,210
Turn our volume down to zero.

78
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,530
It's nothing.

79
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,930
Yeah, put all of us individually zero.

80
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,690
You're so smart.

81
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,610
Um, hello?

82
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,610
I gave the idea.

83
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,270
It was a collective game.

84
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,290
Don't worry about it, Doki.

85
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,910
It was collective.

86
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,050
I'm collectively smart.

87
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,050
Okay, let me see.

88
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,430
Oh, you can turn people individually up, too.

89
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,490
Yeah, I was gonna say, Kasey, you're fucking awesome.

90
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,470
I'm turning you down.

91
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,190
Okay, let's see.

92
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,350
Turning you guys up.

93
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,130
That was not a good idea.

94
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,230
What did you do to me?

95
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,630
That was a piece of pizza.

96
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,330
Let me pick up the boomerang.

97
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,530
Yeah, you can pick up the boomerang.

98
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,650
No, my boomerang!

99
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,730
Let me pick it up.

100
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,690
Well, let me pick it up.

101
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,870
Oh my god, can you suspend it?

102
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,110
Okay, one...

103
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,070
What is that?

104
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:22,970
What are you doing?

105
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,610
Where'd she go?

106
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,030
That's right.

107
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,970
This is exactly why I wanted to play this game.

108
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,830
How do you do that?

109
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,310
Wait, how do you...

110
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,850
Oh, here?

111
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,870
E-mail.

112
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,450
Oh, and then...

113
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,870
Let's crouch.

114
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,970
What's for?

115
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,110
Oh, okay.

116
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,850
Woah.

117
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,370
We've been in the game for 5 minutes.

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,860
That's right.

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,600
We're going full sloppy tonight.

120
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,540
Oh, we're getting banned.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,260
I just wanted to twerk!

122
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,280
Let me twerk and step on one place and just hit you again.

123
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,560
Thank you so much for the sub.

124
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,080
Woah, my god.

125
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,580
It is so funny.

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,260
Wait, get in front of me.

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,760
Get in front...

128
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,440
My god.

129
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,920
Oh my god.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,300
I was like looking through the settings and I pop out and I just see a fucking train being ran right through my screen.

131
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,400
That's...

132
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,480
Join us, Snubby!

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
Press ALT.

134
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
ALT and 4.

135
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,760
ALT 4.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,300
What's that?

137
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,860
What's that?

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,660
Press ALT and there's 4.

139
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, we're just a train, guys!

140
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,020
Cowabunga!

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
What the?

142
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,580
Don't do it!

143
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,420
Don't do it!

144
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,460
Did you guys see the cat up here?

145
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,680
Did you see the cat and his little Santa hat?

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,540
Cat?

147
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,260
Yeah, he's on the fridge.

148
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,500
There's no individual audio settings.

149
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,860
Why are there individual audio settings?

150
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,560
No, there are!

151
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,200
There are!

152
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,780
In the...

153
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,620
I just got master volume and voice chat output volume and that's it.

154
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,500
If you don't go into settings, it's just in like the pause menu, but...

155
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,060
No, not for people.

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,640
I want to turn down the sound effects.

157
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,160
Oh, the sound effects.

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,580
Did I just do it?

159
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,140
Alright, ok.

160
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,020
Also, am I loud?

161
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,740
Because I just noticed the thing is like my mic input volume is really high on this game.

162
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,240
Do I put myself like here?

163
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,820
Oh, that sounds good.

164
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,200
Or here.

165
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,820
Is that better?

166
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,440
Yeah, that's good.

167
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Ok, less blown out.

168
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
If it's still loud, let me know because I have plenty of headroom to turn it down.

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,380
It's better this way.

170
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,820
Are you doing gacha?

171
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh, it's normal or hard mode.

172
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,200
Ok, we should go to normal mode.

173
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,840
Wargamer!

174
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,460
How do you do a snowball?

175
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,040
Where's Snuffy?

176
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,980
Where's Snuffy?

177
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,700
Snuffy?

178
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,660
Snuffy?

179
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,060
Snuffy!

180
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,900
Snuffy's with me.

181
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,600
Snuffy!

182
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,540
My cat is trying to...my cat is...

183
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,260
I'm waiting for something.

184
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,260
Wait, did she crash?

185
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,680
Yeah, I think Intel is striking again.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Mint crashed?

187
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,900
No, did it go into the...wait, did it go into the game already?

188
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,900
No, I don't know where Mint is.

189
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,620
Ok, let's see.

190
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm trying to turn people down.

191
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Dang it!

192
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,940
I'm a little scared.

193
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,540
The game just randomly closed.

194
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,060
I'm going to let my cat out real quick.

195
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,900
Oh my god, you guys were in the back this entire time.

196
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,620
That's right.

197
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,120
What are you doing, huh?

198
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,340
I'm going to be totally looking for you at all times because you might crash and I'm going to be scared for you.

199
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,800
These games are scary.

200
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm going to have to go through a rigorous testing process before I ever agree to another game.

201
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,440
Drop me behind the house.

202
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,160
Is this where we play basketball?

203
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,980
I guess so, yeah.

204
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,820
I think you play basketball in one of the maps.

205
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,840
Oh, ok.

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,880
My boss says you're crypto mining.

207
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,480
Can you confirm?

208
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,880
ENGO is basketball, guys.

209
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,760
That's our ENGO.

210
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,780
Right there.

211
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,740
I want a b-ball.

212
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,260
I want a b-ball on the court.

213
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,380
Yeah, I'm here for the b-ball.

214
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,600
Someone called me the baller.

215
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,060
Press to join our...

216
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,200
Do you think the more footprints we leave, the more likely it is that Snuffy crashes because it's taking more processing power to remember?

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,000
Whose credit card is this?

218
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,780
I think I dropped mine.

219
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,080
What?

220
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,360
No, this is mine.

221
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,860
I got it.

222
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,580
I have somebody's credit card.

223
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,520
Belong to no state, it says.

224
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,900
I just...

225
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,140
Ok, you're not getting it back then.

226
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,940
Get it.

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,360
Get it.

228
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,560
Get it.

229
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,740
How do I drop an item, actually?

230
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,820
I think it's ours.

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
It's my company employee card.

232
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
Yeah, I have two of them.

233
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,640
I got an employee ID.

234
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,440
Don't take my employee ID, chat.

235
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,440
Oh my god, wait.

236
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,140
It actually just docks my...

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,040
It shows like your code on Steam.

238
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,500
If you look under the snow, you might bump into...

239
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,780
Oh, they don't see it.

240
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,320
They can't see it because...

241
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,540
Because my Fookies are covering it.

242
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,020
Government ID?

243
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,240
This one has nothing on it.

244
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,460
Here, wait.

245
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,640
Here, take this identity.

246
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,340
It's mysterious.

247
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,460
Take that one.

248
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,000
Take that one.

249
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,400
Oh my god.

250
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,860
This game is key.

251
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,580
What the heck?

252
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,740
Whose card is this?

253
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,320
Wait.

254
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,340
It works.

255
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,060
There's three.

256
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,340
I'm creeping over to you.

257
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,000
Keep your legs open.

258
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm sorry, what?

259
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,860
I feel like I'm sliding around.

260
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,500
Can you change my name to Zort, please?

261
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,160
Zort?

262
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,180
That looks wrong.

263
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,620
That looks so wrong.

264
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,210
I gotta get over there.

265
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,310
I gotta get over there.

266
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,850
Oh my god.

267
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,150
Stop.

268
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,730
Should we try a game then?

269
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

270
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,710
Also, my sound volume is better now.

271
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,730
Bomberman.

272
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,850
But not really.

273
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,370
What's this?

274
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,410
Hold control of the crouch.

275
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,370
That's cute!

276
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,930
Yeah, that's cute.

277
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,030
Are you guys ready?

278
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,370
I'm gonna head to the first map.

279
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,190
Yeah!

280
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,690
I'm not the host.

281
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,770
Min has to select it.

282
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,170
Oh, okay.

283
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,690
First map!

284
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:38,550
Yeah?

285
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,470
It's all free!

286
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,150
It's all free!

287
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,410
Let's get them all.

288
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,170
We can be a symphony!

289
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,350
I just wanna be part of your world!

290
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,110
Okay!

291
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,590
That was so fast.

292
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,750
Oh my god!

293
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,790
Poppy playtime!

294
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,450
What?

295
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,570
There's like an actual cutscene.

296
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,190
Thank you for the thousand bits!

297
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,590
What?

298
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,050
It didn't mute.

299
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,610
Oh, shit.

300
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,570
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:59,250 --> 00:15:59,630
It's okay.

302
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,450
I almost thanked him too, because he looks like he's in my chat.

303
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,970
So I was about to be like, thanks, man.

304
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,070
Thanks for the thousand bits, dude!

305
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,050
I thought it was muting.

306
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,410
Hold on, let me go find the push to mute.

307
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,050
Chat, I think if you give anything to Limu, it's only fair that you share.

308
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,890
You can't only give things to one child and not the other.

309
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,950
Escape the factory?

310
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,230
What did I just do?

311
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,870
Wait, I think I just did something.

312
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,190
I don't know.

313
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,170
What did I do?

314
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,390
Don't make...

315
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,590
Oh!

316
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,290
Thanks!

317
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,650
Sort of.

318
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,150
Quiet?

319
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,790
We're on TV.

320
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,990
That's quiet, right?

321
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,350
Yeah.

322
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,910
I hate this channel.

323
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,510
Oh, there we go.

324
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,550
Somebody in chat said we look like the Plants vs.

325
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,450
Zombies guy.

326
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,530
Oh my god, we do!

327
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:04,970
Grass.

328
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,870
Spice.

329
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,670
Tomato paste.

330
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,910
Metal gear.

331
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,810
Can you do a test with me?

332
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,310
Can you hear me right now?

333
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,910
Yeah.

334
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,190
What was that?

335
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,950
How did you get in here?

336
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,770
Oh my god.

337
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,750
How did my... How did my computer get in this game?

338
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,450
Is that Toa?

339
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,130
It kind of looks like Toa.

340
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,790
Hello?

341
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,510
Hello?

342
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,830
Hello.

343
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,910
Ok, you can hear me now?

344
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,650
Ok, I'm gonna test.

345
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,090
I'm gonna mute, hopefully, and then can you hear me?

346
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,250
Yeah, we can hear you.

347
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,670
Not right now.

348
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,070
If you're talking right now, I can't hear you.

349
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,330
Yeah.

350
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,070
Ok, cool.

351
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,710
I fixed it then.

352
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,430
Get your flashlight.

353
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,350
Yeah, get your flashlight.

354
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,750
I got an air horn.

355
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,610
That's helpful, right?

356
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,110
Where's the flashlight?

357
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,330
Where did you get the air horn?

358
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,590
Over on the bench.

359
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,250
Power for ton styles.

360
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,430
Flashlight.

361
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,470
Oh, turd styles.

362
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,530
We are so going to get murdered by monsters instantly.

363
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,110
No, we'll be fine.

364
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,830
We'll be so fine.

365
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,870
How do I do it?

366
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,790
Oh, we have to use our ID cards here, right?

367
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,070
Do we?

368
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,570
Oh, is this just like we loot or something?

369
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,150
Oh, we do, actually.

370
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,710
No, use your ID card.

371
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,490
Yeah.

372
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,770
We are like employees here in the Zord Factory.

373
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,030
Don't find things to eat on the ground.

374
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,830
We are all going to fucking die.

375
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,050
What's that?

376
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,390
Oh, another flashlight.

377
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,690
What did you do?

378
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,850
Be quiet, this is a noise friendly environment.

379
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,550
Go quiet.

380
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,170
What is going on?

381
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:11,810
Wow!

382
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,630
What's happening?

383
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,330
I'm ill.

384
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,050
I saw a man.

385
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,810
What do you mean you saw a man?

386
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,310
Oh, in this.

387
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,030
You saw a man?

388
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,290
I saw a man.

389
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,310
I don't feel so good.

390
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,930
In this hole?

391
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,430
In the hole?

392
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,230
No, no.

393
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,610
What?

394
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,450
Uh-oh.

395
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,740
Uh-oh.

396
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,060
I saw the man!

397
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,600
I saw...

398
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,380
It's your fault!

399
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,540
He's right there!

400
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,240
He's right there!

401
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,180
Do you see him?

402
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah, I see him.

403
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,100
He's smiling at you.

404
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,520
Yeah, he's smiling at me.

405
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,180
I don't see anything.

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,980
You're not ill yet.

407
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,240
You're not ill yet.

408
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,520
Maybe I shouldn't be plagued near you then.

409
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:00,860
Hold on.

410
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,000
Wait.

411
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,760
She... I think she went in the hole and got eaten.

412
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,480
Was that the... Wait.

413
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,840
It's fine.

414
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,680
She's dead.

415
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,600
She's dead.

416
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,340
I'm ill.

417
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,180
Don't go in that hole.

418
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,020
I won't.

419
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,380
Do you think we need to take her ID card back with us?

420
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,280
No, she's not...

421
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,860
Hey!

422
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,460
Hello!

423
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,480
What's up?

424
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,480
You made it back!

425
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,800
Where did you go?

426
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,400
I

427
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,620
think I need to go.

428
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,540
I don't know.

429
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,620
I think the man is about to get me.

430
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,580
Oh, there's two men!

431
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,280
There's two men... There's three men!

432
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,100
I gotta go!

433
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,520
I gotta get out of here.

434
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,500
I gotta get away from the...

435
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,440
Wait, there's...

436
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
There's so many men!

437
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,300
They're all...

438
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,300
They're staring at me!

439
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,480
Wait.

440
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,460
Oh no, I see the 30 twerking men, but apparently the men that they're seeing is different.

441
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,840
Wait, do you not hear the laughter?

442
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,440
No.

443
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,920
Oh no!

444
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,260
Um...

445
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,040
We're in the first looking room and we're gonna die.

446
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,480
We gotta escape somehow.

447
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,180
We just don't know how yet.

448
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,580
We can just keep exploring.

449
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,200
Yeah.

450
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
Oh, was it?

451
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,740
You made it back though.

452
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,040
I found a golden...

453
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,560
Hallucinating.

454
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,700
I don't know, I just hear them whispering.

455
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,340
They're...

456
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,980
They're really talking a lot.

457
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
I guess we gotta go into the other...

458
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,300
Oh my god.

459
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,100
What the hell was that?

460
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,520
They're getting closer!

461
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,660
Stop!

462
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,560
Leave me alone!

463
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,280
What have I done?

464
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,200
Oh, I think I might have just summoned the...

465
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,480
Goki?

466
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,560
Goki?

467
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,000
Goki?

468
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,280
I thought she summoned a chair.

469
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,480
She turned into a chair?

470
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,180
Then I started moving, I was like, wait, I'm alive!

471
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,380
What do you mean a chair?

472
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,320
Wait, wait, wait.

473
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,720
Are you real?

474
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,320
Are you like...

475
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,860
Don't talk loudly.

476
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,160
Loud sounds can damage you.

477
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,660
What are we damaging?

478
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,700
Wait, you're not crazy anymore?

479
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,040
No!

480
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,560
Goki, your stuff is where you fell.

481
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,400
If you wanna get it back.

482
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm not getting it.

483
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm not going back.

484
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't think all the plushies are good.

485
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,200
I don't wanna go down this way.

486
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,280
There's evil men laughing at me.

487
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,220
They're laughing at me.

488
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,200
Go away!

489
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Go away!

490
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm fighting my inner demons for real.

491
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,020
Music improves mental health.

492
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm gonna improve my mental health by...

493
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Trust me, it worked for me.

494
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
It's working, it's working.

495
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,920
That's how we leave.

496
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,980
Ok, I'm pushing it.

497
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,600
We haven't collected anything, so we should probably do that first.

498
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,200
I found one collectible.

499
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,440
What just hurt me?

500
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,700
What's happening?

501
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm not moving!

502
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,860
I'm moving on my own!

503
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,720
What's going on?

504
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,600
Hello?

505
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,220
Oh, I think I gave you a concussion actually.

506
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm sorry.

507
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,180
I just threw a bottle at your head.

508
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,920
Oh, I really did have a concussion.

509
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,500
Yeah!

510
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,940
I'm so sorry.

511
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,840
You were knocked down.

512
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,840
Oh,

513
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,900
it says waiting on the other players.

514
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,260
Can we not just press the button?

515
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,320
Our life is on the line and you're huffing gas.

516
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,220
No, I'm collecting things.

517
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,780
The gas is...alive.

518
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,600
What was that?

519
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,560
Oh, I think there's trees.

520
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,000
If you have a Rubik's Cube, it will make you sane, apparently.

521
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,440
No, I'm better now because of the music.

522
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,060
I'm better.

523
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,900
Oh, I see.

524
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,760
Ok, Cube restores sanity when used.

525
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,680
If you hit tab, you can see item information.

526
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,620
Oh, neat.

527
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,640
I hear flies.

528
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,700
What's the gas for?

529
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
I saw one.

530
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,620
I saw a gas can...crawling away.

531
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,620
Ok, sorry Zentraya.

532
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,460
Sorry.

533
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,860
Don't make loud.

534
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,320
Wait a second.

535
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,300
Mint Lane?

536
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,960
This is my home.

537
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,860
This is made for me.

538
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,380
Mint Lane.

539
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,320
Do we just leave now?

540
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,920
Maybe.

541
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,120
I think we can just leave because it said waiting on players when I pressed the button earlier.

542
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,920
What's that sound?

543
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,160
We're waiting.

544
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,260
What's that?

545
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,800
Oh, there's another little plashy.

546
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,380
Oh, I have to press the button.

547
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,100
Sorry.

548
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,480
Oh.

549
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,020
My bad.

550
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
Find Zordy.

551
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,140
Oh,

552
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,000
it's just repeating you guys.

553
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,640
Is this Zordy?

554
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,520
Is this Zordy?

555
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,460
I think so too.

556
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,240
Let's go find Zordy.

557
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,620
What?

558
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,020
Oh yeah!

559
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,440
This whole area opened up.

560
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,800
Ok.

561
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,420
Zordy!

562
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,260
Oh look, look, look Zordy!

563
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,880
Zordy opens doors for you.

564
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,440
Reach the second floor.

565
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,680
Second floor goes to factory.

566
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh ok.

567
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,180
What did I just do?

568
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,780
Who is this?

569
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,360
I just summoned him on accident.

570
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Maybe you'll occupy his body if you die.

571
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,180
Yeah, I just summoned him on accident.

572
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,180
Nice.

573
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,220
Why didn't he imprint on me?

574
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,860
There's something coming!

575
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,540
There's something coming!

576
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,820
It makes you happy.

577
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
What's that guy doing?

578
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,180
Snuffy, there's something coming!

579
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,360
Is that Snuffy?

580
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,400
He's looking at us.

581
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,000
He's looking at us.

582
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,720
He's looking at us.

583
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,340
Oh, he's leaving?

584
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,460
Oh, kind of.

585
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,120
Wait, is that Snuffy or is this Snuffy?

586
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,160
No, remember you have your guy, right?

587
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,840
Uh...uh...uh...uh...

588
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,600
Why do you have a bunch of voices going...

589
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,660
What is this game?

590
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,780
Oh my god!

591
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,020
Ok.

592
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,000
They're kidding.

593
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,120
They took their candy mask.

594
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,500
Yeah, I dropped that and they're taking it.

595
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:53,760
Ok.

596
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,200
What is happening?

597
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,240
I don't think they're supposed to take it back, right?

598
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,340
They're just gonna put it back on the pedestal.

599
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
They'll put it back on the pedestal, I guess.

600
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,740
Yeah.

601
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,800
Angel, thanks for the gift.

602
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
Where did they go?

603
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,260
Why did the bunny disappear?

604
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,640
Oh, what's happening?

605
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,460
Are they gonna summon me?

606
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,240
No!

607
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,200
Is that me?

608
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,120
Did the bunny thing kill Mint?

609
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,700
Yeah!

610
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,020
Yeah, it did.

611
00:30:53,740 --> 00:31:00,380
Oh my god, it really is just dudes kissing.

612
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:00,780
How do I drop him?

613
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,400
Press G.

614
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,980
Put him up here.

615
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,140
Put him on his throne.

616
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,460
What's that low voice?

617
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,180
It's so creepy.

618
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,740
What are they saying?

619
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,640
What is that scary noise?

620
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,860
Yeah, drop him.

621
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,500
Bring me back.

622
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm coming back!

623
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,380
I'm alive!

624
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,320
I'm alive!

625
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:33,980
Oh!

626
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm alive!

627
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,280
Oh, thank you!

628
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,600
Thank you!

629
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,900
I have two IDs.

630
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,440
I don't need one.

631
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,680
I do need a flashlight though.

632
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,680
What are they saying?

633
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,960
No!

634
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,320
The bunny!

635
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:01,880
The bunny!

636
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,360
The bunny!

637
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,060
Oh, I got the flashlight.

638
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,340
Ah!

639
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,740
Oops.

640
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
What's going on?

641
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,470
Oh,

642
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,870
they are saying give me the doll.

643
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,810
No, we need a key I think right now, right?

644
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,750
What do we do with this thing?

645
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,530
What the hell is this?

646
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,850
Big king.

647
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,070
Give me the doll!

648
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,190
Oh no, no, no!

649
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,190
There's a guy...

650
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,510
Ah!

651
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,790
I'm ill again.

652
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,370
Why is everything happening to me?

653
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,410
Ah!

654
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,550
Hold on.

655
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,910
Hey, chill out.

656
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,330
No, I'm gonna use the music right here.

657
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,650
Thank you doll.

658
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,910
I know where the...I remember where there was arcade machines.

659
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,410
Oh wait.

660
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,850
It's fine.

661
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,750
Don't worry about it.

662
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,610
What was that?

663
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,990
Oh nice, money.

664
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,570
That's not a real item.

665
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,070
Who is this?

666
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,270
Who is this?

667
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,130
I think I got a stalker.

668
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,810
Yeah, that's ok.

669
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,710
Yeah, throw me in the hole.

670
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,090
Bunny!

671
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,990
Oh, they grabbed it back.

672
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,230
Hey, how did we get in here?

673
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,150
How did you do that?

674
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,970
You guys, there's so many of us.

675
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,050
How did so many people...

676
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,830
How many people spawned?

677
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,570
We gotta find the high score, no?

678
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,850
Yeah, find the high score.

679
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,610
The bunny!

680
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,230
No!

681
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:12,790
No!

682
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:13,750
No!

683
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,660
Just keep yelling at it.

684
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm good at that.

685
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,700
What's the high score?

686
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,780
What game is this?

687
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,080
Bonecracker.

688
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,640
I did it!

689
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,680
The door is open!

690
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,980
You got spectator role.

691
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,580
I got the door open.

692
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,360
Play video games.

693
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:53,860
I'm an echo!

694
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm an echo!

695
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,960
Oh my gosh.

696
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,880
Gamer room.

697
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,640
What's this thing?

698
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,760
Ozmen.

699
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,080
Wait, what's this?

700
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,330
Everybody okay?

701
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:14,870
Snickers!

702
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,330
A bottle and bowling ball.

703
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,530
Weakness bowling ball bottle.

704
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,790
Eat some sushi.

705
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,590
I'll grab one.

706
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,010
I don't have one.

707
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,850
Oh, just kidding.

708
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,230
Grab the gas can.

709
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,270
So there might be a creature that's weak against it.

710
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,010
Oh,

711
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,090
you're right.

712
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,370
Backup generator.

713
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,090
What the hell?

714
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,630
How did you do that?

715
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,710
You hit me!

716
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,190
How do you use it?

717
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,230
I guess just put the gas cans by it.

718
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,190
Go away!

719
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,390
This thing is creeping...

720
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:32,070
This thing is creeping me out.

721
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,850
Who are you?

722
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,710
Yay!

723
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,390
Storage!

724
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,050
So close.

725
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,050
Come on, Doki.

726
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,850
Come on.

727
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,990
Creature log.

728
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,670
At what?

729
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,470
What's that sound?

730
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,250
Do you hear that?

731
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:17,910
Like the music?

732
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,370
What?

733
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,410
What's that sound?

734
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,880
Stupid!

735
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,820
Yeah, go away, idiot!

736
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah!

737
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,560
Die, stupid!

738
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,480
Snoopy has it right now.

739
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,800
I keep hearing whispers.

740
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,740
What's that?

741
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,540
Oh, you found my friends?

742
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:00,820
What the?

743
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,300
That guy just went under the...

744
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,760
Oh we gotta go activate the generator!

745
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,700
Get off the ground!

746
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,840
Come on, we got a job to do!

747
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,620
Let's go do the generator!

748
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,670
Throw the bottles at him!

749
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,770
Bottles are his weakness!

750
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,270
Bottles are his weakness!

751
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,130
He's coming after me guys!

752
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,550
It's totally fine.

753
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,510
Don't worry about it.

754
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,170
Nice try!

755
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,370
You almost got him!

756
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:13,770
Where is the bottle?

757
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,430
Get the bottle.

758
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,290
Everybody get a bottle.

759
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,610
Wait, where do we go now?

760
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,870
Do we not go upstairs?

761
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,170
Help me!

762
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,910
Help me!

763
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,790
No way!

764
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,310
I'm in the backrooms!

765
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,470
I got dragged into the...

766
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,380
Hello?

767
00:40:59,380 --> 00:40:59,480
Hello?

768
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah, I just went to the backrooms.

769
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,480
There is someone over here too.

770
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,200
Oh, watch out for the...

771
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,660
What's happening?

772
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,760
Oh, I just messed up.

773
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh dang it!

774
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,860
Why doesn't the bowling ball work?

775
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,940
Yeah, she'll just end up in the backrooms.

776
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
That's just what happens.

777
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,920
The bowling ball.

778
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,720
I don't think it works guys.

779
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,900
Am I in the backrooms?

780
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,180
Oh no, I'm spectating.

781
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,300
I tried...

782
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,920
I literally...I literally clicked...You guys watch me hold the button down on that and it went all the way around.

783
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,200
It didn't do it.

784
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,000
It didn't open.

785
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,600
What?

786
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,540
You guys watch me hold that!

787
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,340
You guys watch me hold that button!

788
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,800
Oh my...I got robbed for real.

789
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,780
I got robbed!

790
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,720
You guys saw!

791
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,960
Bring me back!

792
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,240
Yay!

793
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:17,420
Ok, I held down that button earlier and it looped and the door didn't open.

794
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,580
I got robbed.

795
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,620
We could have been up here even faster.

796
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,700
I did!

797
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,480
I did.

798
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,140
I have the proof in the pudding.

799
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,500
Walked from behind.

800
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
8008?

801
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
8008?

802
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,780
It was in a real gas can.

803
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,500
Fake items.

804
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,380
Are you sure?

805
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,920
Try it again.

806
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,900
Does anyone have a bottle?

807
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,480
Is it free?

808
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,460
There we go.

809
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,920
It says don't throw it at the cheese.

810
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,080
So I'm gonna throw it at the cheese.

811
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,860
What is this?

812
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,980
The rat!

813
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,180
I think I opened the door!

814
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,000
I opened the door.

815
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,280
I just saw a spooky man.

816
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,420
What's the code?

817
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,660
I see all your friends too.

818
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,720
Where did they come from?

819
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,980
3131.

820
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,160
Ok!

821
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,280
Sure you did Doki.

822
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,860
Sure you did.

823
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,460
Trust and pits.

824
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,860
Wait!

825
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,580
Skinwalker?

826
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,800
Is that all those guys that are around us?

827
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,180
Skinwalker.

828
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,480
Doki died.

829
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,280
What?

830
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,940
What do you mean?

831
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,880
I hear her voice.

832
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,400
She's right here.

833
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,560
Ok, I'm seeing death.

834
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,540
I'm seeing death.

835
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,120
We might be boned actually.

836
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,200
Do you guys have an extra bottle?

837
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,900
We need an extra bottle.

838
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,420
Where are we throwing the bottles at?

839
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,780
I hope I don't...

840
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,060
The bottles we can get from the...

841
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,800
Ordering bottles.

842
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,560
Yeah, we can order bottles for free.

843
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,120
Yeah, they're free.

844
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,660
Rubik's Cube!

845
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,040
Rubik's Cube!

846
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,820
It's already solved.

847
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,800
You can't use it.

848
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,740
It's already solved.

849
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,520
Zordy.

850
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,640
I'm getting a lot of...

851
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,080
It could be the Skinwalker.

852
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,720
I just read a thing about that.

853
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,080
Who's laughing?

854
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,620
Who was that?

855
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,400
Ok, someone get in a corner.

856
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,940
Everyone get in their own corner.

857
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,340
Everyone get in their own corner.

858
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,560
Who are you?

859
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,320
Are you somebody?

860
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,840
I think I need to kill some of these people.

861
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,740
Oh, that didn't work.

862
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,660
I feel like we're overdoing it.

863
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,040
Maybe we should try to kill some of these people.

864
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,300
Yeah, how do we do it though?

865
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,180
With the glass maybe?

866
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,780
With the bottle?

867
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,840
Wait, who's who?

868
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,020
Oh this is... Ok, this is the imposter.

869
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah?

870
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,080
Yeah.

871
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,740
Ok, we're good.

872
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,340
I'm going to die very soon.

873
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,400
Oh, I'm starting to see people too.

874
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,040
Oh gosh.

875
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,400
Ok, don't die.

876
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,800
Don't die on me.

877
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,440
Maybe, yeah.

878
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
Oh my god, there's more people.

879
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,220
There's people everywhere.

880
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,840
They're doing...they're e-boating.

881
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,500
They're twerking.

882
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,080
Wait, Lime.

883
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,200
Lime, can you go back downstairs and find a Rubik's Cube?

884
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,700
Yeah, maybe try to go back and see if there's a Rubik's Cube down there.

885
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,520
It does?

886
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,360
Oh, nothing's happening.

887
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,940
What do we do here guys?

888
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:30,420
What do you think?

889
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,180
Chat, is this real?

890
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,440
What?

891
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,980
What's that music?

892
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,730
What's that music?

893
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,350
Hello?

894
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,350
Oh, how did you get in there?

895
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,050
Hello?

896
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,790
Wait, how did you get back there?

897
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,110
How did you get back there?

898
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,830
How did you get back there?

899
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,090
Doki, where are you?

900
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:29,970
Where are you guys?

901
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:32,150
Hello?

902
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:33,690
Hello?

903
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,130
I'm trapped.

904
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,350
Vent from the boxes?

905
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,470
Where is...oh here?

906
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:51,730
Crouch.

907
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,490
I can't see anything.

908
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,630
I can't see anything.

909
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,630
I'm lost.

910
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,930
I'm just going forward.

911
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,150
I'm going forward.

912
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,870
Oh, I see some light.

913
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:12,850
Oh my gosh.

914
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,330
I'm going forward.

915
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,650
Going forward.

916
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,130
Going forward.

917
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,570
I'm going forward.

918
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:22,290
Going forward.

919
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,050
Guys, I can't see anything.

920
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,650
I don't know where I am.

921
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,090
Hello?

922
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,550
I think I'm stuck.

923
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:33,290
Hello?

924
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:35,670
Where

925
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,670
am I?

926
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,950
I can't see.

927
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:47,990
I think I'm...

928
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,310
Yeah, I'm stuck in the vents.

929
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,090
I went back the wrong way.

930
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,090
I don't have a flashlight.

931
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,590
I don't have a flashlight.

932
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:03,510
Can you guys shine your lights at the vent?

933
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,250
Wait, what's happening?

934
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,590
It just turned me around.

935
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:12,990
What?

936
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,650
Follow the brats.

937
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,670
I don't have a flashlight.

938
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,390
It just turned me around.

939
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:27,230
Can you guys shine your flashlights at the vent?

940
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,410
I'm in the fucking vent.

941
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:32,370
No you won't.

942
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,230
Ok, it says the person who was crying in the vent earlier.

943
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,190
Wait.

944
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:43,690
Wait.

945
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,490
I made it.

946
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,650
I'm right here.

947
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,480
Let her go inside.

948
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,280
Oh god.

949
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,260
Oh no!

950
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,860
Stop it!

951
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,320
Get more bottles!

952
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,120
Get more bottles!

953
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,730
Save me!

954
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,950
Save me!

955
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,310
Don't worry.

956
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,390
We'll fix it later.

957
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,350
I hate this game.

958
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:45,610
I hate this game.

959
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,250
This sucks.

960
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,090
This sucks!

961
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,510
Why is it that I save somebody and nobody saves me?

962
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,030
I hate this game!

963
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,990
I'm never playing again!

964
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,990
Why are they ignoring you?

965
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,870
I don't know!

966
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,370
Yeah, get fucked Doki!

967
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:20,050
Yeah, I hope you get dragged to the backrooms and you cry in there.

968
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:22,030
Look at her crying.

969
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,130
Look at her cry.

970
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,510
Look at her cry.

971
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,010
No, I'm in the backroom!

972
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:40,670
Yeah, get stuck in the backroom Doki.

973
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,230
You're all by yourself Doki-Pan.

974
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,750
They're still coming after you in the backrooms.

975
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,390
It's me.

976
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,330
I'm here.

977
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:52,370
I'm here.

978
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,830
You're real quiet Doki.

979
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,310
What's going on?

980
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:05,130
What is that sound?

981
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,150
This is funky music.

982
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,950
Oh she made it!

983
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,680
Where is everybody?

984
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,420
Hello?

985
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:46,900
Oh!

986
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,520
Snuffy you're dead!

987
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,800
You're in the backrooms?

988
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,160
You're in the backrooms?

989
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,440
Yeah!

990
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,000
We're in the backrooms!

991
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,980
Where did our Zordy go?

992
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,160
Oh he's faster than you.

993
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,620
He's faster than you.

994
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,060
No.

995
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,520
Maybe he's not faster.

996
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,220
Just throw a bottle at him.

997
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,700
I'm trying to win!

998
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm not.

999
00:55:59,480 --> 00:55:59,800
No!

1000
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,960
That's the first time I've ever seen that work!

1001
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,640
Are we good?

1002
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,700
Is this someone?

1003
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:21,880
No.

1004
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,440
I'm sure I will get shanked by this guy.

1005
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,140
Good job Doki!

1006
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,820
We're all dead!

1007
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,920
We're all dead!

1008
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,300
What?

1009
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,680
Wait no!

1010
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,940
GG!

1011
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,440
GG everybody!

1012
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,440
GG!

1013
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,560
I'm never saving your asses again ever!

1014
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,200
I don't know who I saved but I'm never saving your asses again ever!

1015
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,920
I tried so hard.

1016
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:28,400
I was trying to move that fucking drill and Doki was just running around me like don't take me back to the backrooms.

1017
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,580
He literally is like the same speed as you.

1018
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,960
All you have to do is keep running.

1019
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,820
I think we don't want to be triggering those dolls.

1020
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,440
Those dolls just seem to summon tons of dolls at night.

1021
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,340
I don't know why.

1022
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,600
Ok, can we speedrun it without maxing it?

1023
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:49,940
Alright.

1024
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,360
We can speedrun that.

1025
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,760
I'm looking at the other ones.

1026
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,720
Oh the last one looks spooky.

1027
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,480
Ok, let's go!

1028
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,260
I'm too chicken.

1029
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,960
I think we can skip this.

1030
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:13,880
Just hold down space.

1031
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,220
We can skip, yeah.

1032
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,320
Yeah, no balls.

1033
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,580
I skipped it.

1034
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,280
It's hold down space.

1035
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,380
I have to turn this on too.

1036
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,120
Where is it?

1037
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,420
It's Zentreya.

1038
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,580
Thank you Zen.

1039
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,500
God bless.

1040
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,720
I'm ready to Zord.

1041
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,360
This is me Zording it!

1042
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,340
Yes.

1043
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,160
Yes.

1044
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:10,220
It definitely triggered my flighter fight right earlier.

1045
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,700
Oh yeah, that's Zording it.

1046
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,800
Zord, Zord, Zord.

1047
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,220
Open the Noor.

1048
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,260
Open the Noor.

1049
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,680
Open the Noor.

1050
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:25,880
Yay!

1051
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,470
Open the Noor!

1052
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,430
Ok.

1053
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,230
Alright.

1054
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:46,670
I wish there was names above people.

1055
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,030
Who am I running after?

1056
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,690
Yeah.

1057
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,050
What's that sound?

1058
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,070
Come on guys!

1059
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,770
Let's press the button!

1060
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,950
Come back!

1061
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,330
Oh, there we go.

1062
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:21,270
Yeah, it's gonna open this area over here.

1063
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,370
This one right here.

1064
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,210
Ok.

1065
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:27,330
Oh, me too.

1066
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,330
There's a Rubik's Cube right here!

1067
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,050
If you grab it, do you use it immediately?

1068
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,830
Ok, ok.

1069
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,670
So everyone maybe grab one.

1070
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,190
Is this real?

1071
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:41,990
I wonder.

1072
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:43,510
Oh, it's real.

1073
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,050
No!

1074
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,250
That's a...

1075
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,310
No!

1076
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,470
What do you mean it's randomized?

1077
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,970
Do you have to tell...

1078
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,050
Do you have to ask it?

1079
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:09,670
49601?

1080
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,990
Where do you put it in?

1081
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,350
Oh, it's down here.

1082
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,030
That's the door.

1083
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,630
Is this door over here?

1084
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:22,570
49601?

1085
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,870
We got it!

1086
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:32,630
There's a Zordy!

1087
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,270
Oh wait, what's this?

1088
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,570
What is this in here though?

1089
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,370
Oh, antibody.

1090
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:42,310
Ok.

1091
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,470
Open the door!

1092
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,250
Open the door!

1093
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:48,370
Open the door!

1094
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,670
I don't know what to do now.

1095
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:56,770
What else is there to do?

1096
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:31,190
Goodbye!

1097
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:35,150
It's ok.

1098
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,050
I distracted it.

1099
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:37,370
I distracted it!

1100
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:40,850
What the hell?

1101
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:41,870
I just died immediately?

1102
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,650
I just died!

1103
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,840
Do you just have to be quiet around it and it leaves you alone?

1104
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:18,860
Ok.

1105
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,040
Good to know.

1106
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,320
Wow, this thing is stupid.

1107
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,940
The AI is dumb!

1108
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,520
She's still going for it.

1109
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,020
She's in here.

1110
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,800
What is happening?

1111
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,260
What the hell?

1112
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:02,840
Oh no!

1113
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,660
It's the Skidwalker!

1114
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:05,940
Oh my god!

1115
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,860
What?

1116
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,320
They're speaking Simlish!

1117
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,860
What the hell?

1118
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,720
What the hell?

1119
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:29,900
Hello?

1120
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,980
I want to hear myself though.

1121
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,520
Let's speedrun it guys!

1122
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,000
Let's speedrun it guys!

1123
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,160
Where have you been?

1124
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,000
Get in here!

1125
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:24,190
We were worried about you.

1126
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,350
Oh they're not worried about me.

1127
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,070
That's fine.

1128
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,090
That's ok.

1129
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:36,430
Watching all of that was so good!

1130
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,810
Oh come on!

1131
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:43,610
Donkey!

1132
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,350
Seriously!

1133
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:50,570
Wow!

1134
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,030
I did it first try!

1135
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,290
I think I'm dying!

1136
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,330
I got a concussion!

1137
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,150
No, I have a concussion!

1138
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,370
Thank you.

1139
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:22,590
I just scream at it and it kind of goes away eventually.

1140
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,870
Wow, Donkey you are...

1141
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,910
I know you don't be very good at throwing stuff.

1142
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:35,670
I did it!

1143
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:38,490
I literally did it first try the last time, alright?

1144
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,030
I'm just saying, you know.

1145
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,410
I had a concussion.

1146
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:43,510
You can't blame me.

1147
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:46,610
Oh yay!

1148
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,850
Let's go.

1149
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:55,410
I'm on.

1150
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,330
I'm loading the data.

1151
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:57,450
9898!

1152
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,770
9898 baby!

1153
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,470
Oh yeah!

1154
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,590
Oh dammit there is a guy right there.

1155
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,250
Oh now it tells you to jump.

1156
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:21,490
Ok, I'm following you.

1157
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:28,850
Wait...

1158
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:29,230
Oh I see you.

1159
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:29,650
Thank you.

1160
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:29,930
Thanks!

1161
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:31,630
There we go!

1162
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,210
Wait, I can't see.

1163
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,250
Where are you guys?

1164
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:36,690
Where did you go?

1165
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:38,570
Jump?

1166
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:40,810
Oh there it is.

1167
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:41,010
Ok.

1168
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:46,610
I'm gonna push.

1169
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:48,770
I'm helping.

1170
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,090
Yeah.

1171
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:00,330
Inside the bin.

1172
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:01,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1173
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:01,810
It's right here.

1174
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:02,790
Ok, nice.

1175
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:04,790
Nice, nice.

1176
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,210
Oh, there is a skinwalker on the other side.

1177
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,310
What's Zoron?

1178
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,910
They honestly seem very whatever.

1179
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:15,990
They don't really do a whole lot.

1180
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:20,450
Does anybody have like a therapeutic kind of toy to play with?

1181
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:21,910
No.

1182
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,910
The guy is gonna start coming upstairs soon so...

1183
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:40,570
Yeah, I'm gonna get more bottles so that they are just on the ground.

1184
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:43,330
Be careful, be careful.

1185
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,630
Bottles are free, remember.

1186
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:49,630
Yeah, bottles are free.

1187
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:50,810
Just get them on the ground.

1188
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,610
Have them ready.

1189
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,900
I hit him, but it's nothing.

1190
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:05,580
Help!

1191
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,250
It's over!

1192
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Was that a skinwalker next to me?

1193
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,020
Oh no.

1194
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,260
Wait, am I by myself?

1195
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,760
Oh my god, wait.

1196
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,700
Wait, where is the doll?

1197
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:58,600
Oh shit.

1198
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,900
Wait, am I by myself?

1199
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,640
Am I eating?

1200
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,600
Where

1201
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,260
is the doll?

1202
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,780
I threw it!

1203
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:21,960
I threw it!

1204
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:22,740
Why?

1205
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,760
It's a friend in his face!

1206
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,160
I threw it!

1207
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,320
I threw it!

1208
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,760
No!

1209
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,480
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok.

1210
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:53,500
I don't think I've ever seen anything funnier than three of us understanding the assignment and shutting the fuck up and then Doki screaming.

1211
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,560
Screaming the entire time!

1212
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,680
He walks up, we're all like, ok, there he is.

1213
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,060
And Doki is just like, ok, throw a bottle at him!

1214
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,160
It didn't work?

1215
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,680
Why is no one helping me?

1216
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,900
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs!

1217
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:18,860
It's funny I cut the reload back into the lobby because the sound is fucked up on my end.

1218
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,720
We'll totally get it this time.

1219
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:26,700
Yeah, I believe.

1220
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,340
I like that we have Christmas up.

1221
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:36,360
Is this another game just like crab game where they kind of like got to a Christmas update and then abandoned it forever?

1222
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,780
That just seems to happen with some of these games.

1223
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:44,740
This game is new and they just decided Christmas hats would be fun.

1224
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:53,480
I guess what we have to do is as we accumulate those guys we should lead them into the pits downstairs because eventually they aggro.

1225
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,280
It was creepy because they were playing recorded audio of Snuffy going, no it's over!

1226
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,200
Or it might have been them, I don't know.

1227
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,240
It was really funny.

1228
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,680
Wait, the skinwalkers?

1229
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,940
The skinwalkers eventually started playing back the audio at me and then they turned into worms and murdered me.

1230
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,540
Oh yeah, they will turn into worms.

1231
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:15,060
You have to lead them to pits I think it said.

1232
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,040
Yeah, once we start accumulating them we need to lead them to pits.

1233
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,280
Oh, I have to invite Doki.

1234
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,540
It's not letting me invite.

1235
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,020
Yeah, into a pit.

1236
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,800
Maybe I should remake the lobby.

1237
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,280
I'll just try me remaking it.

1238
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,440
I'm gonna...

1239
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,560
Yeah, I'll remake the lobby.

1240
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,800
Oh, unsaved progress.

1241
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,360
Not all of our unsaved progress.

1242
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,160
No!

1243
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,400
Okay, I just realized I don't think I have Snuffy on Steam.

1244
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,120
Okay, invite friends.

1245
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:10,960
Alright.

1246
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,140
I gotta add her.

1247
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,240
No, I don't have her.

1248
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,120
Hello?

1249
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,560
Oh, hello.

1250
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:26,800
I returned.

1251
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,120
Who do I see jumping?

1252
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,320
You guys saw that too, right?

1253
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,500
There was someone like spawning.

1254
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,940
Their footprints are right there.

1255
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,880
There was someone like spawning in and out of existence.

1256
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,740
Can someone invite Snuffy?

1257
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,680
Oh there!

1258
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,520
They were right behind you!

1259
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,060
Hello!

1260
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,160
Oh yeah.

1261
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,180
It's funny.

1262
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,560
Oh, there might be people loading in now.

1263
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,320
Okay, are we ready?

1264
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:11,840
Ready?

1265
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,360
You guys, why does it feel like we've been playing this for 15 hours?

1266
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,760
It's only been an hour of this stream.

1267
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,580
We are still stuck in level 1.

1268
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,280
We know how to...

1269
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,740
We got this.

1270
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,880
Let's skip.

1271
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,760
To be fair, there's only two levels.

1272
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:40,860
What was that?

1273
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,220
I'm trying to set off the noise machine.

1274
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,320
Okay, it's not working yet.

1275
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:48,920
What?

1276
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:49,440
Wait.

1277
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,800
This is what we do.

1278
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,740
We have to do this.

1279
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:58,140
Press E on your screen and you can push the skinwalkers.

1280
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,180
Am I pushing you?

1281
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,100
Am I pushing you?

1282
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,540
Ah, it works!

1283
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,020
Wait, why didn't this turn on?

1284
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,160
Oh, I didn't hold it down.

1285
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:14,620
That's why.

1286
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,780
Hold on.

1287
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,000
I didn't hold it down.

1288
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:19,960
I just pressed it.

1289
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,000
Oh, we don't need it then.

1290
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:22,420
Nevermind.

1291
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,180
I thought we needed it.

1292
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:25,840
Just kidding.

1293
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,780
No, we're getting atoms.

1294
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,240
Speedrun!

1295
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,920
Press the exit button!

1296
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,040
Press the exit button!

1297
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,940
I'm here.

1298
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,780
I'm here.

1299
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,020
Press H?

1300
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,400
What does H do?

1301
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,920
I pushed a button.

1302
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,040
What?

1303
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:02,480
What happened?

1304
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,220
I got a Snickers bar.

1305
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:10,740
Let's go.

1306
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,380
Collecting goods.

1307
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,500
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get more bottles.

1308
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:28,840
Oops.

1309
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,100
My bad.

1310
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,050
What does H do?

1311
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,930
Why?

1312
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:41,250
Why?

1313
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:43,770
49601?

1314
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,550
Okay, so it can't be the same code, but there must be a few different ones.

1315
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,100
Nice.

1316
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:55,880
Nice.

1317
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,000
Airhorn?

1318
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,640
I found some food.

1319
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,480
If somebody wants food...

1320
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,440
Oh yeah, it's a bitch is just a massive bitch.

1321
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,300
What?

1322
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,940
What happened?

1323
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,160
Hold on.

1324
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,080
I'm getting all the gas cans.

1325
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,640
Oh, nevermind.

1326
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:44,180
What?

1327
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:50,200
Why?

1328
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,120
Why didn't it throw?

1329
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,620
Oh my god.

1330
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:56,880
Hello?

1331
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,600
Why isn't it saying anything?

1332
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:06,120
Why does everyone else get the cool things that sound in the backrooms, but not me?

1333
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,360
Why?

1334
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:10,660
Why not?

1335
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,640
Oh gosh, I'm lagging so bad.

1336
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,720
The sound bugged for me?

1337
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,740
Wait,

1338
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:22,810
what?

1339
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,450
What just happened?

1340
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:31,170
What just happened?

1341
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:36,810
Hey, hey, hey...

1342
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,210
Get out of...

1343
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:49,280
You guys are giggling and I had to watch a minion horribly murdered by that monster.

1344
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,960
I didn't...

1345
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,900
How did I just die?

1346
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,420
How did I just die?

1347
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:56,820
What just happened?

1348
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,760
What just happened?

1349
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:58,980
How did I just die?

1350
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,180
How did I just die?

1351
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,340
How did I just die?

1352
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:08,120
The bunny did not get me.

1353
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,460
You just died?

1354
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,300
I thought you died like 5 minutes ago.

1355
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:12,800
I did?

1356
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:23,740
She died because the rabbit came over and then the rabbit jumped at her instead of me.

1357
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,540
Oh, there's a skinwalker in here.

1358
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,700
I'm gonna go get rid of him.

1359
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,220
If you guys can continue.

1360
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,040
This one here, circling the pillar.

1361
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,700
Is that him?

1362
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,200
Yeah.

1363
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,220
That's fucking right.

1364
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,760
Yeah, you're in the wrong.

1365
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:38,500
That's me.

1366
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:38,880
That's me.

1367
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,120
How are we gonna get rid of him though?

1368
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,020
I don't know if he'll follow me.

1369
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:41,540
Hold on, let me see.

1370
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,880
I don't think you can go down.

1371
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,720
Oh, oh, oh!

1372
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,120
It's mad!

1373
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,340
How did you trigger it?

1374
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,520
How did you trigger the skinwalker?

1375
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,420
Maybe if you're alone like in the dark?

1376
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,120
Oh, maybe it's because he took us alone.

1377
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,040
What was the code?

1378
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,400
He just crawled into the vent.

1379
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:02,920
90, 90.

1380
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:08,800
I don't know if they can crawl into the vent.

1381
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:09,800
It's a little scary.

1382
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,900
Alright, I'm ready.

1383
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,580
He took out his full worm in front of me.

1384
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,080
I don't like that.

1385
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,140
Yeah, I don't like the way it looks either.

1386
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,780
He's um, get out of here.

1387
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,480
Get out.

1388
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,400
I turned around and there's 30 of them.

1389
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,320
They can't get in the vents.

1390
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,120
Crawl into the vents.

1391
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,280
Crawl into the vents!

1392
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,400
They're not smart enough.

1393
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,600
We're in the vents?

1394
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,680
I'm in the vents.

1395
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,140
I hid it and he seemed fine.

1396
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,000
I don't think they can get in here.

1397
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,040
They're not smart enough.

1398
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,640
Yeah, I don't think they can get in here.

1399
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,080
Find Zordy.

1400
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,360
Who's Zordy?

1401
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:50,260
Nice, nice, nice.

1402
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,960
Okay, from here on we gotta be quiet soon.

1403
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,920
Doki bird.

1404
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:57,080
Hey!

1405
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,920
Do you think this is real?

1406
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,120
I'm helping, I'm helping.

1407
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,060
For real?

1408
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,900
I'm hearing the bunny.

1409
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,820
Do you think the music is real?

1410
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,440
The bunny is the music, yeah.

1411
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,470
The guy is gonna...

1412
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:36,070
Oh, come

1413
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,060
on.

1414
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:00,730
I hate my life.

1415
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:11,680
Off to the back rooms you go.

1416
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,000
Have

1417
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,180
fun.

1418
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:42,850
No!

1419
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,050
Doki!

1420
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,850
Come on, live!

1421
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:12,990
Not the bitch, not the bitch, not the bitch, not the bitch, not the bitch, not the bitch, not the bitch.

1422
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,110
Oh, she's juking him.

1423
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,280
That is very unfortunate.

1424
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,740
Go, live, go!

1425
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,540
Run, run, run!

1426
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,940
That's a skinwalker, that's a skinwalker, that's a...

1427
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:38,460
You!

1428
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:47,210
She could've looped him forever and had it so that they could never advance.

1429
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,710
It would've been great.

1430
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:50,870
Welcome to the back rooms.

1431
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,070
She made it to the back rooms!

1432
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:59,650
I glitched or I started lagging so badly in here, so bad.

1433
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,550
She was holding out for me.

1434
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:05,750
That's not real.

1435
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:08,410
Real.

1436
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:12,350
Maybe I'll win the level by doing nothing.

1437
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:17,440
Hey, what's up?

1438
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,140
Is this one not real?

1439
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,560
No, no, no, we're all real, we're all real.

1440
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,220
No, kill Doki!

1441
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,900
Kill Doki.

1442
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,040
Luigi strats.

1443
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,520
I'm getting carried, baby.

1444
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:39,500
I'm the princess.

1445
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,740
I'm the princess, I'm the passenger princess.

1446
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:45,000
Yeah, do it.

1447
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,300
Oh, she's trying to atone for her sins.

1448
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,740
I'm sorry.

1449
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,540
I'm atoning for my sins.

1450
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,700
Shut the fuck up.

1451
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,500
Come here, go into the pit.

1452
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,700
Go into the pit.

1453
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:05,940
Go into the pit.

1454
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,620
You know what you've done!

1455
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,340
Come on, let's go help.

1456
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,020
Maybe.

1457
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:23,680
Do

1458
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,310
you have an air horn?

1459
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,010
Do it.

1460
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,930
Oh, he's not after us.

1461
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:38,210
Man's behind me.

1462
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:39,570
What?

1463
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,230
Saw a man.

1464
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,530
Don't look at it, I think.

1465
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:48,960
We're after them.

1466
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,600
That's not...

1467
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,580
Who is that?

1468
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,980
I don't know.

1469
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,360
I don't know who that is.

1470
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:05,080
Is everybody dead?

1471
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:07,140
No.

1472
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,240
I think so.

1473
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,340
I don't think so.

1474
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,240
I think everybody's dead.

1475
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,520
The guy is all the way over there.

1476
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,080
No way.

1477
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:18,960
Wait, everybody's dead.

1478
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,440
We should stay together.

1479
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:22,440
Wait, where are you?

1480
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,720
They're multiplying, they're multiplying.

1481
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,580
Is everybody dead?

1482
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,180
Oh no.

1483
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,780
Oh, I'm real, but some of these aren't real.

1484
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:29,280
Okay.

1485
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,620
Okay, the ones crouching by you aren't real.

1486
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,240
We should push them.

1487
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:32,800
Push.

1488
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,520
Oh, big guy's coming.

1489
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,000
You guys!

1490
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:48,470
Seriously,

1491
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:54,870
leave me alone.

1492
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,740
I'm with you.

1493
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:10,700
I'm with you.

1494
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,200
Okay, there's an imposter behind you, because Doki's freaking out.

1495
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:16,680
Yeah.

1496
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,300
Yeah, he's next to me.

1497
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:21,980
I see him.

1498
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,360
You could help, you know.

1499
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,040
You could help, imposter, if you want, you know.

1500
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,720
I'm helping.

1501
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,120
No, I mean the imposter.

1502
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,960
Saying he could help.

1503
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,620
Doki's being great, babe.

1504
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:36,220
I know.

1505
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:37,720
That's me.

1506
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,440
You pushed me.

1507
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,420
We're almost there, Doki!

1508
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,300
We're almost there!

1509
01:28:56,660 --> 01:29:00,040
Is Snuffy back?

1510
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,360
I heard...

1511
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:03,960
Snuffy's been here.

1512
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,000
She was shoving that clone.

1513
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,780
Oh!

1514
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,880
Oh, I didn't hear you!

1515
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,980
Hey!

1516
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,200
What do I do?

1517
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,620
What do I do?

1518
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,700
Push button for exit.

1519
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,520
Okay, running, running, running.

1520
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,780
Can we go in?

1521
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,600
Oh, I didn't realize you could go around it.

1522
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,000
Escape the factory!

1523
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,260
Get me in the car.

1524
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:14,960
Repair the car!

1525
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:17,420
Wait, we gotta repair the car!

1526
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,180
Get the car!

1527
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,220
Build the car!

1528
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,140
Oh my god, build the car!

1529
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,820
Build the car!

1530
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,580
Where's the parts?

1531
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,720
I don't see tires.

1532
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:37,160
I found a tire, but it disappeared after I dropped it.

1533
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,340
What is happening?

1534
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,760
Tire, tire!

1535
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,940
Tire, did it bug out?

1536
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:45,500
Did it bug?

1537
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,040
I don't know.

1538
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:48,080
I don't know.

1539
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,840
Oh no, I just got back.

1540
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,280
I had a tire, but I dropped it.

1541
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,500
I found one, I found one!

1542
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,540
Oh nice, nice, nice.

1543
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,040
What's going on?

1544
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,320
Okay, need a gas can.

1545
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,140
Gas can, gas can.

1546
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,580
I have a gas can, I have a gas can, where do I put it?

1547
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,860
It's here, here, here, here.

1548
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,300
Where I am, this side.

1549
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:06,360
Left side, left side.

1550
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,180
Left side!

1551
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,460
Can we go?

1552
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,100
Oh, button, button, button,

1553
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:24,080
button!

1554
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:25,260
How do I get in?

1555
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:27,620
How do I get in?

1556
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,060
Did

1557
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:34,940
we get in?

1558
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,500
I think we did it, I think we did it!

1559
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,220
What's happening?

1560
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,420
I think we did it.

1561
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,680
How many tires does a car need, guys?

1562
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,120
I clutched that Zord around.

1563
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,180
I had Zord chasing me the entire time while you pushed that drill.

1564
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,960
Dude, I just heard you like, moaning and him groaning.

1565
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:01,760
And I could not even imagine how you were juking him for like, questions.

1566
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:09,060
I saw binary numbers, he was putting numbers on my screen.

1567
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:09,580
How?

1568
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,920
Yeah, we did it!

1569
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,600
We're so good.

1570
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,100
Wow.

1571
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:31,750
I got escaped from Zord again.

1572
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,210
That was the best bait ever.

1573
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:36,950
We did it, guys.

1574
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:42,330
We don't want to think so, but I think that was the most engaging coordination.

1575
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:43,930
We locked in.

1576
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:45,990
It only took us three tries, guys.

1577
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:50,610
It only took us three tries, but we did it, guys.

1578
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:52,830
Just want to play basketball.

1579
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:58,650
Is this the basketball level now?

1580
01:32:59,450 --> 01:32:59,730
Maybe.

1581
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:01,650
Oh, sorry.

1582
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,330
I just clicked it, sorry.

1583
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:06,690
Roadtrip!

1584
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:09,890
Roadtrip!

1585
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:10,850
Roadtrip!

1586
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,230
It feels like we're flying.

1587
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:13,170
Press H.

1588
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,650
I'm grateful you saved me from that factory.

1589
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:19,690
A pretty lady.

1590
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,550
Veneta.

1591
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,970
You're my life.

1592
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:24,130
You're my sexy car.

1593
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:24,970
Hey, Veneta.

1594
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:27,310
She's meeting us in the sexy woods.

1595
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:28,470
Alright, let's go.

1596
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:31,290
You're in the woods?

1597
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,770
Wait, she has a voice for you guys?

1598
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:35,210
She's just squeaking for me?

1599
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:37,530
Oh yeah, she's squeaking for me too.

1600
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:40,130
I'm the one in the van.

1601
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:45,510
She's got those kind of squeaks that you only understand if you know a woman's touch.

1602
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:46,130
Exactly.

1603
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:49,030
Oh, we're so desperate, but we're sad.

1604
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,210
There's a car behind us.

1605
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:54,650
I think there's like an evil ex-car boyfriend chasing us, you guys.

1606
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:57,310
Oh my God, Herbie, is that you?

1607
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:58,630
Wait, is the villain the car?

1608
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,470
Because that would be Peach.

1609
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:01,270
I don't think he likes that we're pushing this car out in the woods right now.

1610
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,050
I think he's jealous.

1611
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,270
This is...

1612
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:08,810
Oh, watch out!

1613
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,310
I ran out of the way.

1614
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:14,510
Why did I die?

1615
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:17,370
I literally ran out of the way.

1616
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,790
He literally ran... I ran out of the way.

1617
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,850
I think I got desynced probably.

1618
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:35,410
Oh, I think you... I think it's like you don't stop running basically.

1619
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:37,150
I think you just gotta keep running.

1620
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:44,790
Keep going!

1621
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:47,010
Keep going!

1622
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,170
Oh, where did Snuffy go?

1623
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:53,430
Uh-oh.

1624
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,230
Okay, he's so far.

1625
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:55,810
Look at him.

1626
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,950
I'm not looking back.

1627
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:57,590
I'm not looking back.

1628
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:00,050
Bro, what you gonna do?

1629
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,590
Where do I go?

1630
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:07,150
Where do I go?

1631
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:08,950
They touched the stone!

1632
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:10,730
Oh, it crashed for Snuffy.

1633
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,310
It crashed.

1634
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:18,530
We'll try and get her back in.

1635
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:20,490
Am I dead?

1636
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:22,310
Hello?

1637
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:23,510
Are you dead?

1638
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:25,530
Everybody's dead.

1639
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:26,270
What happened?

1640
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,270
What happened?

1641
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:32,410
Hello?

1642
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:34,550
I think Snuffy crashed.

1643
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,610
Yeah, Snuffy crashed.

1644
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:36,350
I don't know.

1645
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:41,510
I touched the stone and it was like waiting for players and then nothing happened.

1646
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:44,950
I ran out of the way of the car and then it ran me over somehow.

1647
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,030
I don't...

1648
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:47,990
It's like teleported to me.

1649
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:49,730
I saw a hole and then I...

1650
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,830
I think we should keep going.

1651
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:52,050
Yeah, I think so.

1652
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:55,230
I jumped into the hole and I died.

1653
01:35:56,510 --> 01:36:00,230
Yeah, because holes have had such a great reputation in this game already.

1654
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:02,250
It was glowing though.

1655
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:02,770
It was different.

1656
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:03,710
Let me reinvite Snuffy.

1657
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:04,470
Yeah, thank you.

1658
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:05,250
It was different.

1659
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,310
It won't let me click it either.

1660
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:09,030
The hole was glowing, guys.

1661
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,130
It was so different.

1662
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:12,590
Oh, I can only invite her to watch VBridger.

1663
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:14,630
Oh my God, no.

1664
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:16,170
Should I remake the lobby?

1665
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,590
Let me see if it's like...

1666
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:21,370
Can you do it, Doki?

1667
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:23,510
Because it's registering me as only playing VBridger.

1668
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,010
I'll remake it.

1669
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,730
It says no lobbies for her.

1670
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:27,090
It's okay.

1671
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:29,290
Okay, we'll remake that.

1672
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:31,490
And also she's like up here.

1673
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:32,850
I think she's invisible, right?

1674
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:36,530
The game is a little scuffed, you guys.

1675
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:39,810
The game is a little scuffed.

1676
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:43,770
Yeah, I might have bugged when she DC'd.

1677
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:47,130
Another perfect game.

1678
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:49,790
At least we're all playing together, right?

1679
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,750
We're all playing together.

1680
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:57,310
As a sister family.

1681
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,250
We're a pack of sisters.

1682
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,010
Invite me again.

1683
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:07,530
Okay.

1684
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:14,430
Except when you're DCing.

1685
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:18,350
Let's see if anybody spawns here before they come in.

1686
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:20,330
We'll know when someone joins the lobby.

1687
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:22,970
They glitch in over there.

1688
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,670
She always wanted a sister.

1689
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,070
I always wanted a brother.

1690
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:30,150
I always wanted a brother.

1691
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:32,330
I always wanted a brother.

1692
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,850
I always wanted a brother.

1693
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:36,670
Is anybody here?

1694
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:40,810
Another invite?

1695
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:42,490
Why?

1696
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:43,150
I did.

1697
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:45,650
Doki is messaging me.

1698
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:47,010
She's like send me another invite.

1699
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:49,870
Let me do live.

1700
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:51,870
I can only watch?

1701
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:52,950
Oh no.

1702
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:55,930
Okay, we'll leave.

1703
01:37:57,310 --> 01:37:58,170
Return to menu.

1704
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:03,390
Host game.

1705
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:06,930
Okay,

1706
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:13,330
let's try again.

1707
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,550
Invite Doki.

1708
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:17,730
Invite Limu.

1709
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:20,970
I gotta add Snuffy.

1710
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:25,170
Did I see something?

1711
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:28,030
I always wanted a brother.

1712
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:29,290
Wait, wait, wait.

1713
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:34,050
Wrong one.

1714
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:37,710
Wrong one.

1715
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,830
I always wanted a brother.

1716
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,530
I always wanted a brother.

1717
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:46,050
I always wanted a brother just like you.

1718
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,430
Nobody is joining my game.

1719
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,100
I am inviting.

1720
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,100
Okay, I'll reboot.

1721
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:18,360
Oh, it's showing VTube Studio for me.

1722
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:18,580
Okay.

1723
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:19,440
Quit.

1724
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,280
We gotta quit the game, everybody.

1725
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,020
I always wanted a Beretta.

1726
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,820
I always wanted a Beretta.

1727
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,740
Alright, um... Zort.

1728
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:30,760
Oh, yes.

1729
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,760
Wait, I already installed this feature.

1730
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:36,620
Skip.

1731
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,780
Yay, launder software.

1732
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:48,500
Please.

1733
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:50,340
Okay.

1734
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:51,980
Host game.

1735
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:54,840
Yeah, we're getting Zort.

1736
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:56,640
Yeah, we're getting it all Zorted out.

1737
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,260
Okay, invite.

1738
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,520
I'm here.

1739
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,100
Watch this.

1740
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,200
Hi!

1741
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,840
You made it.

1742
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:36,640
We did.

1743
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,160
Beautiful.

1744
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,860
We need Snuffy to get in here.

1745
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:48,200
Yeah, let's surround where Snuffy will be with the...

1746
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,500
With this.

1747
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,260
Have you found that the directional audio is sometimes really weird?

1748
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,340
Like, sometimes it's like...

1749
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,800
Someone's really close and it'll be like, no, you can't hear them.

1750
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,200
Yeah, I think there's like a...

1751
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:03,020
In the backrooms, it like fucks up your audio.

1752
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:06,700
And everybody sounds like you're in like a hole somewhere.

1753
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:12,220
When I watched someone... I think it was Snuffy went to the backrooms.

1754
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:14,760
What?

1755
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,040
Oh, wait, Snuffy's here.

1756
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:18,440
Praise be to Snuffy.

1757
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,540
Praise be to Snuffy.

1758
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,960
Praise be to Snuffy.

1759
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:24,060
Praise be to Snuffy.

1760
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,960
Praise be to Snuffy.

1761
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,340
Praise be to Snuffy.

1762
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:37,760
Let's do it.

1763
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:38,400
We got this.

1764
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,260
Alright, let's go.

1765
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:55,470
Touch the rock or we die.

1766
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:56,710
Or is it Dwayne?

1767
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:58,610
Don't go into any holes, guys.

1768
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,210
Did we touch Dwayne or Johnson?

1769
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:01,150
The rock?

1770
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:02,730
Should we skip this?

1771
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:05,070
Oh, no, I think Snuffy crashed again.

1772
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:06,250
Her chat's freaking out.

1773
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:06,810
No!

1774
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:10,550
I wonder if we can just like, re-invite her.

1775
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:12,630
Yeah, I wonder if it's the car level.

1776
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:15,010
Yeah, can we re-invite her after this section, maybe?

1777
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:15,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1778
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:17,170
Yeah, maybe we'll see.

1779
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,510
I'm following you.

1780
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:19,650
A little bit more intensive.

1781
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,030
Are you still alive?

1782
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:24,670
I'm alive!

1783
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:27,670
I'm right here!

1784
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:29,970
I'm here.

1785
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:31,990
The music kinda goes in.

1786
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,790
I'm following you guys since you know which way to go.

1787
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:35,690
It does.

1788
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:45,670
The car is

1789
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:51,600
also going.

1790
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,540
Touch the rock!

1791
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:55,820
Touch the rock!

1792
01:42:59,300 --> 01:42:59,900
Touching rock!

1793
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,160
We touched rock!

1794
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,280
Escape before the fence is broken!

1795
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,400
I'm coming!

1796
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:08,760
I'm coming!

1797
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,860
We did it!

1798
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,520
Let's see if we can invite her.

1799
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,840
Let's... Should we try re-invite Snuffy?

1800
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1801
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,640
It won't let me, so...

1802
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,240
Let's try re-invite Snuffy.

1803
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:24,780
No!

1804
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,540
Wait, it says invite friends again.

1805
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:27,740
No!

1806
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,480
Oh no!

1807
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,260
I don't think she can do car level.

1808
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:35,980
Unless like...

1809
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:39,240
Unless she can try to grab this even harder, even further back.

1810
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:39,920
She said potato.

1811
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,340
There's no going back.

1812
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,080
There's no going further than potato.

1813
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,480
No going...

1814
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:44,960
No!

1815
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,920
There's a basketball hoop!

1816
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:01,500
What?

1817
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,100
We just found a basketball hoop!

1818
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,380
We just found a basketball hoop!

1819
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,040
No!

1820
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:16,430
We're pouring one out for you, Snuffy.

1821
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:28,370
Should we try one more time?

1822
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:31,670
That part's not very long, but...

1823
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:38,770
I didn't mean to do that, sorry.

1824
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:40,490
Oh, it's a shop!

1825
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:46,210
What's this?

1826
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:47,310
Who's that in there?

1827
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:47,990
There's a Pikmin in there.

1828
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:52,690
What just happened?

1829
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:54,210
I don't know.

1830
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:56,110
He just... He exploded!

1831
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:58,690
OK, guys.

1832
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:01,250
We have to go back to the main menu and invite Snuffy back.

1833
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,730
I have to play ball.

1834
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:03,950
We do.

1835
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:04,650
It's important.

1836
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:05,770
I gotta be ball.

1837
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:06,270
OK.

1838
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,330
Alright, Snuffy.

1839
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,470
We're going back to the main menu.

1840
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:12,730
Return to lobby.

1841
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:14,650
Return to lobby.

1842
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:20,570
We need a ball.

1843
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:22,310
Alright, invite Snuffy.

1844
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,430
You must not pause for real.

1845
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,670
Yeah, you can't pause in a multiplayer.

1846
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:29,950
Yeah.

1847
01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:32,810
We might have to restart the lobby.

1848
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:34,030
It's so finicky.

1849
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:34,490
OK.

1850
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:35,710
I'll remake it.

1851
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:37,030
I can't invite her again.

1852
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:37,870
I'll remake it.

1853
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:43,390
Well, at least the car part isn't very difficult.

1854
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,090
Host game.

1855
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:45,670
Host game.

1856
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:50,870
I'll just... I didn't... I didn't even think of which way we were going.

1857
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:52,610
So, I don't know it at all.

1858
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:54,450
So, I'm just gonna follow them.

1859
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:58,110
I'm just gonna follow them.

1860
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:03,150
We got this.

1861
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:03,970
It'll work.

1862
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:06,030
We will play be ball.

1863
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,150
We will be ball.

1864
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:10,230
We will be ball.

1865
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:11,610
We will be ball.

1866
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,330
Wait a minute.

1867
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:22,290
What are you doing to me?

1868
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:30,410
Wait, lay down in front.

1869
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,330
Oh wait, on the bed?

1870
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:32,590
Oh my god.

1871
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:34,170
Oh my god.

1872
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:36,270
No, ma'am.

1873
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:43,470
Back up a couple of spots.

1874
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,250
There we go.

1875
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,050
Join us.

1876
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:54,570
What was that?

1877
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:56,610
Learn.

1878
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:58,850
You know what to do.

1879
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:03,690
There's a fart button by the way.

1880
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,740
Hi, Snuffy.

1881
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:16,860
Hi, Snuffy.

1882
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:16,860
Hi,

1883
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:24,760
Snuffy.

1884
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:32,960
Is this what happens when you get fed the Zort beans?

1885
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,340
It gives you the massive Zort gas?

1886
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,100
It's H.

1887
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,080
It's H.

1888
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,140
Go stand up beside the bed.

1889
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,540
In the corner.

1890
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:50,840
Snuffy just likes to watch.

1891
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:55,580
She's got the chair in the hotel.

1892
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,760
Do you think that this will throw off the skinwalkers?

1893
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:20,580
Oh yeah.

1894
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,600
Oh yeah.

1895
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,460
Yes, skinwalkers don't got, we got.

1896
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:27,180
Alright, I'm gonna go start the game.

1897
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:27,740
I'm gonna go.

1898
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,240
We're gonna do this.

1899
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:30,060
We got this.

1900
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:33,080
We got the car, Snuffy.

1901
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,040
Surely it won't shatter into a million Lego pieces upon loading in.

1902
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:43,400
Snuffy, if we don't see you after this...

1903
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:48,380
Yeah, take us out with you.

1904
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,660
OK, I'm skipping.

1905
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,720
Wait, should we...

1906
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:59,980
OK, maybe we don't skip it.

1907
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,460
Wait, should we skip it?

1908
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:03,360
I don't know.

1909
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:04,680
I'm scared.

1910
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,980
OK, I'll skip.

1911
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:10,800
I'm gonna skip.

1912
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,220
OK, run!

1913
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:18,240
Snuffy, are you here?

1914
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,060
Just run!

1915
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:26,780
Run!

1916
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,260
Yeah!

1917
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:47,440
You're here!

1918
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,480
Yeah, touch the stone and then we're gonna run again.

1919
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:56,040
Yeah.

1920
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,920
Oh god.

1921
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:04,560
I'm OK.

1922
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,700
I'm OK.

1923
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,140
I'm touching.

1924
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:08,480
I'm touching.

1925
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:09,640
I'm touching.

1926
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,140
There we go.

1927
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,850
We made it!

1928
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,460
I almost didn't make it.

1929
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:37,720
I think there's a mine over here, guys, so watch out for the mine.

1930
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,340
Yeah, B-Ball.

1931
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,500
Oh my god, not the...

1932
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,860
That's right.

1933
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:58,960
She's gone!

1934
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,380
She's gone!

1935
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,360
She was so young!

1936
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:08,820
No!

1937
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:10,920
I miss her.

1938
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:17,180
I like how you make squeaky noises on the field.

1939
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,220
Yeah, I think it's really funny.

1940
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,420
What's that sound?

1941
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,420
Probably nothing good.

1942
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:24,980
Yeah, I don't think that was good.

1943
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,300
Oh, I think that resets the score.

1944
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,700
Is that storm getting closer?

1945
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,480
Is it the storm that is approaching?

1946
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,900
I played basketball!

1947
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:00,350
That's right!

1948
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,050
What does the button do?

1949
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:09,790
And what do you think this does?

1950
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:10,830
2 for 2!

1951
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:13,890
2 for 2!

1952
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:20,490
That's a half court, but OK.

1953
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:23,170
Did you just hear a scream of agony?

1954
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:24,270
No.

1955
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:26,490
No, I'm playing B-Ball.

1956
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:26,850
OK.

1957
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:29,450
Oh,

1958
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:34,510
where is she going?

1959
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:37,650
To get the ball.

1960
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:41,950
OK, watch this.

1961
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:45,090
This is going to be the shot of the century.

1962
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:46,350
What was that sound?

1963
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:51,330
Are you talking about that storm over there?

1964
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:51,430
Over there?

1965
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:02,990
Why does he keep doing that?

1966
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:04,290
I don't know.

1967
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:13,220
What's that sound?

1968
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:16,980
Should we explore?

1969
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,480
I don't know.

1970
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,040
I feel bad for Snuffy.

1971
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,320
I feel awful for Snuffy.

1972
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:26,120
We need to collectively...

1973
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:30,840
You know, the next Sloppy Sister stream should be us commentating as she tries to fucking build a computer in real time.

1974
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:31,560
Yeah!

1975
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,360
Yeah!

1976
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:42,900
Zort Ball!

1977
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:43,560
Passing it to you?

1978
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:44,940
Passing it to me?

1979
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,620
How are you faster than me?

1980
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,920
Aww, so close.

1981
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,320
Oh, look at that!

1982
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:01,740
Whoa!

1983
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:02,780
Whoa!

1984
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,300
Oh shit!

1985
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:07,320
Oh shit!

1986
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,140
Oh god, I fucked that up.

1987
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:10,220
So bad.

1988
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:12,320
Wait, she's listening to me?

1989
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:14,940
Snuffy, look what's there!

1990
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:22,780
Wait, what's his name?

1991
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:28,280
What was the point of that?

1992
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,520
We don't even know.

1993
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:31,320
No, there was no point.

1994
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:39,760
Snuffy!

1995
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:48,960
Guys, it's such a beautiful night for Snuffy.

1996
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:51,840
Snuffy!

1997
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,480
Can you hear me?

1998
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,200
Snuffy!

1999
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:01,780
Snuffy!

2000
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,040
Snuffy!

2001
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,280
Oh golly!

2002
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,080
Snuffy!

2003
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:27,140
We'll miss you, Snuffy.

2004
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,480
Let's go back to the lobby.

2005
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,120
We can't do this without him.

2006
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:40,560
People are saying you can B-Ball in the lobby, but I think you have to beat episode 2 to unlock the basketball court.

2007
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,320
Right, that makes sense.

2008
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:47,360
Alright, Snuffy, the moment your PC is fixed, we're all coming back here for basketball.

2009
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,700
I just heard that scream.

2010
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:52,880
I'm gonna blow myself up with the mine!

2011
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,760
I'm gonna watch, do it!

2012
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:55,980
Do it, don't be a pussy!

2013
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,660
Wait, let me blow up with you.

2014
01:55:59,720 --> 01:55:59,980
I'm gonna blow up with you.

2015
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,560
Wait, before you do it, you should grab a basketball.

2016
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,020
Oh, sorry!

2017
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,120
Oh, is it the kind where you have to move off?

2018
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,560
Once you're on it, you're...

2019
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,880
Oh gosh, I'm in the back room.

2020
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,780
Do these hurt?

2021
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:19,900
No, they just run up to you.

2022
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:21,780
My thing is bugged though.

2023
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,960
And I'm bugged!

2024
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:32,320
I wish I could hear them speaking backwards, it's so fun.

2025
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:36,680
The back room always makes me lag.

2026
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,200
I've become 2 FPS.

2027
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,080
I went to the back room.

2028
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,140
Yeah, it's kind of awkward.

2029
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,180
Oh, here he comes, I think.

2030
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,240
Wait, let's not...

2031
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:52,040
Don't touch it and see what happens when it gets close to us.

2032
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:09,420
What if he's actually a horrible betrayer?

2033
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:10,760
There's a skinwalker.

2034
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,640
It could be Snuffy.

2035
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:14,580
Zombie Snuffy.

2036
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:19,160
Snuffy, we're gonna... I'm gonna take you to the back.

2037
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:21,140
Come on, get over here.

2038
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:26,350
Get over here.

2039
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:27,030
Get out of here.

2040
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:28,210
Get out.

2041
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:30,650
Oh, it likes me now.

2042
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:32,790
There's a mine on the other side of the basketball court.

2043
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:34,690
Oh yeah.

2044
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:38,050
It's over this way.

2045
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,350
Come follow me.

2046
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:49,250
Why does the mimic have a flashlight and I don't?

2047
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:52,730
I think it took my flashlight.

2048
01:57:53,410 --> 01:57:54,870
Wait, is this a trampoline?

2049
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:56,930
No way.

2050
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:01,230
Are you real?

2051
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:03,330
Yeah, I'm real.

2052
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:06,930
The big one is over there by the court.

2053
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:08,990
Alright, don't worry.

2054
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:10,530
Wait, he died.

2055
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:13,550
I'm gaming?

2056
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:16,050
Guys?

2057
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:18,870
I think I did an impossible feat.

2058
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:20,490
There's two of them now.

2059
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:22,370
Hello?

2060
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:32,500
I'm real.

2061
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,260
Where did Doki go?

2062
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,360
I don't know.

2063
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:38,980
Oh, she found something.

2064
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:40,600
Oh, she's collecting things.

2065
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,640
Snuffy said she could try without VTube Studio.

2066
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:46,800
Oh yeah, if we wanna try it.

2067
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:50,500
Yeah, I'd be down for it.

2068
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:53,640
If she turns off everything except the stream surely...

2069
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,260
Or sorry, except the game.

2070
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:57,220
Surely everything would work out fine.

2071
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:57,660
Surely.

2072
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,220
OK.

2073
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:02,060
Alright, I'm gonna... I'll go... I'll make... Return to the menu then.

2074
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,240
Alright guys.

2075
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,520
Surely.

2076
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:08,640
Surely.

2077
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:17,400
Don't call her Shirley.

2078
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:18,480
She's Snuffy.

2079
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:21,680
Snuffy!

2080
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:24,780
Sorry guys that we're always having so many issues.

2081
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:27,760
At least we were able to complete the first level.

2082
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,000
If anything, you know.

2083
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:34,840
I wonder.

2084
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:38,380
I found a guitar!

2085
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:43,200
I was gonna jam and then the lobby disappeared.

2086
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,800
We're trying for... This is for Snuffy!

2087
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:45,880
Snuffy!

2088
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,600
This is for Snuffy.

2089
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:55,580
I don't know.

2090
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:59,120
Hopefully she saw my message because...

2091
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:01,500
I was like a couple minutes late on responding to her.

2092
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:02,120
Oh!

2093
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:05,140
I wonder if she should...

2094
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,820
I wonder if she should close Discord.

2095
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:09,800
So I was playing Henry Stickmin the other day and...

2096
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,800
There was like a weird glitch where it...

2097
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:14,800
Where it like...

2098
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,760
Kept breaking the game if I had Discord open.

2099
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,060
That's weird.

2100
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,820
Leave me alone.

2101
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,520
Oh wait, you caught it.

2102
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,400
Wait, I can catch it.

2103
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:25,100
Oh I can!

2104
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,240
Alright, 2v2 basketball.

2105
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,460
See you in the courts.

2106
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:31,820
Wait, turn around?

2107
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:41,440
I think she left.

2108
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:42,420
I don't know.

2109
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,860
She's not responding on Discord.

2110
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:51,500
She said she could try one more time and I was like 3 minutes late to seeing that message.

2111
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:53,820
So she might have just given up and...

2112
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:54,900
Disassociating somewhere.

2113
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,380
Let me see if she's still there.

2114
02:00:58,740 --> 02:00:59,680
She's chatting on stream.

2115
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,680
I'm gonna go harass her then.

2116
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:01,040
Hold on.

2117
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:03,880
One more try, Snuffy!

2118
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,860
One last run, Snuffy!

2119
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:09,140
One last run!

2120
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:12,540
She locked up the basketball court.

2121
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:12,900
Okay, she's off.

2122
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,260
She's off.

2123
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:14,780
Okay, she's off.

2124
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:18,980
She saw my message so she's coming.

2125
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:19,680
Oh!

2126
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:20,320
Okay, okay.

2127
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,120
I went and creeped on her stream.

2128
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:24,640
I heard her.

2129
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:29,480
This is it.

2130
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:30,340
This is it.

2131
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:31,240
I got a good feeling.

2132
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,500
Yeah, let's make the shrine.

2133
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:34,080
Yeah, right here.

2134
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:35,880
She's gonna spawn right here.

2135
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:35,940
Okay.

2136
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:41,120
It's gonna be really awkward if she takes a while to get here.

2137
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,560
No, I believe.

2138
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:43,480
Trust, trust.

2139
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:44,280
No, I believe.

2140
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:44,920
I believe.

2141
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:47,340
I believe in her.

2142
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:48,320
Yeah.

2143
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,540
Snuffy, we're all here for you.

2144
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:52,820
Everyone, send Snuffy your energy!

2145
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:54,320
Yes, Snuffy!

2146
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:55,340
Praise be, Snuffy!

2147
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:56,420
Praise be, Snuffy!

2148
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,100
Praise be, Snuffy!

2149
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,000
Praise be!

2150
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:01,080
We're here to zort!

2151
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:05,460
We're here to zort!

2152
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:07,280
We're here to zort!

2153
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:07,860
We're here to zort!

2154
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:09,120
That's what they call it nowadays.

2155
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:10,240
Praise be, Snuffy!

2156
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:15,420
Oh, mighty Snuffy!

2157
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:16,920
Wait, did you send an invite to her?

2158
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,860
I sent her a couple, yeah.

2159
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,100
Have any good zorts lately?

2160
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:26,240
Oh, dude, if you turn the camera down, there's a really weird crotch seam on the model.

2161
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:29,340
I don't see it.

2162
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:30,620
No?

2163
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:31,520
I can't see it.

2164
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:32,980
It's like a melded seam.

2165
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:35,140
Weird.

2166
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:36,080
I don't see it.

2167
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,780
I don't see it.

2168
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:37,300
It's too dark.

2169
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:38,240
I see my ass.

2170
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:39,340
I see my ass, too.

2171
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:40,040
You see his ass?

2172
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:40,320
Perfect.

2173
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:41,240
Oh, I do!

2174
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,040
Oh, wow!

2175
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:43,300
You see his ass?

2176
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:44,940
It's like ribbed.

2177
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:46,640
Whoa!

2178
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:48,020
That's what I mean!

2179
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:48,460
Oh!

2180
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:52,540
I was not expecting...

2181
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:55,100
I was not expecting the zort to be...

2182
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:57,000
to be packing up there.

2183
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:58,200
Or down there.

2184
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,000
You think?

2185
02:02:59,180 --> 02:02:59,480
Yeah.

2186
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:01,540
No wonder he does this.

2187
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,680
Hey, hey, hey.

2188
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,280
Snuffy could be coming in any second.

2189
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:08,500
Get back into position.

2190
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:09,760
Hey!

2191
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:20,980
I have come back.

2192
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:22,280
Welcome back.

2193
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:24,600
We were so close to people.

2194
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:26,800
I know.

2195
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,220
Okay, I'm completely naked now.

2196
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:31,460
This is my last resort.

2197
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:32,020
Okay.

2198
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,260
You're gonna be zorting in the nude?

2199
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:34,320
Alright, let's do it.

2200
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:34,860
Let's do it.

2201
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,440
Let's zort in the nude.

2202
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,760
Zorting in the nude.

2203
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,140
That's how our parents did it, baby.

2204
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:45,940
Is she here?

2205
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:46,760
Is she here?

2206
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:47,780
Alright, we're skipping.

2207
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:48,520
Okay.

2208
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:49,580
Run!

2209
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:52,000
We're running, we're running, we're running, we're running.

2210
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,880
We're running, we're running, we're running.

2211
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:57,320
Snuffy's just gonna have to make noise constantly so we know.

2212
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:01,220
Oh yeah, she's zorting.

2213
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,600
Zort, zort!

2214
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:09,180
It's okay.

2215
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:11,100
Trust, trust, trust.

2216
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:18,600
Go, go, go, go, go.

2217
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,460
Still good.

2218
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,980
We just lost somebody.

2219
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,700
It's fine, she probably went to the back rooms.

2220
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:36,840
She probably went to the back rooms.

2221
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,600
Yeah, it was an intentional fall.

2222
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:42,300
We're touching.

2223
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:43,700
We're touching.

2224
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:45,280
Okay.

2225
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,760
Run, run, run.

2226
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,140
Running, running, running.

2227
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:50,500
Okay, okay.

2228
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:52,740
I'm gonna live through this.

2229
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:54,220
Okay.

2230
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:57,720
To the B-Ball!

2231
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,480
To the B-Ball court!

2232
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:05,580
Okay,

2233
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:10,240
we're here.

2234
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:11,620
Don't touch the mine.

2235
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:13,940
Don't touch the mine.

2236
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:17,440
Oh my god!

2237
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:17,660
Run!

2238
02:05:18,940 --> 02:05:19,580
B-Ball!

2239
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:23,680
Oh, there's a... oh gosh, there's a man behind me.

2240
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:26,040
I'm not looking at him.

2241
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,380
I'll do that too.

2242
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:31,580
B-Ball, B-Ball, B-Ball!

2243
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:35,420
Alright, team cheesy!

2244
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:37,760
Let's get in the teams everybody!

2245
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:40,060
Alright.

2246
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:43,080
Skins and shirts.

2247
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:47,440
How are we gonna tell who's who?

2248
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:04,200
I got one for a Snuffy.

2249
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,540
Oh no, there's no PDC.

2250
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:12,020
This is for you Snuf...

2251
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:18,440
Oh, she dropped her ID card!

2252
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:20,720
She's gone!

2253
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:30,060
Snuffy!

2254
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,180
Accidentally twerked on our corpse.

2255
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,960
Even the little ball is mourning.

2256
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:44,960
Yeah, I know little guy.

2257
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:50,880
We will...

2258
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:55,580
Guys, go find me for Snuffy's PC so we can B-Ball.

2259
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:57,300
Alright.

2260
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,740
She would want this guys, guys.

2261
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:00,760
She would want this.

2262
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:02,720
She would want this.

2263
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:03,820
What, the twerk?

2264
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,200
She wants us to twerk on her?

2265
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:05,560
Okay.

2266
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,980
Yes, she would want this.

2267
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:08,740
Meet me!

2268
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:09,680
Meet me!

2269
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:10,140
Meet me!

2270
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:35,000
What are they doing?

2271
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:37,620
I'm expecting these things to explode or something.

2272
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:38,360
I know, right?

2273
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:40,860
We could just twerk until we die.

2274
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,620
We're like...

2275
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:46,180
We're basically Kesha.

2276
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:46,900
We're like...

2277
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,640
We're just partying until we die.

2278
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:49,480
We're just like...

2279
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:51,280
What was that?

2280
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:53,700
That's a party over there.

2281
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,300
Hell yeah.

2282
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:58,160
At least they're also sad for her too.

2283
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,720
I hope she knows that we're twerking for her in memoriam.

2284
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09,340
In memoriam.

2285
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:12,120
We're like merging into each other as we twerk.

2286
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:13,360
Yeah, it's good though.

2287
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,420
2025 to 2025.

2288
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:23,240
They're so needy, these things.

2289
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:25,580
We're going out in...

2290
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,360
We're going out in style.

2291
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:31,240
Let's all stand in the mines and die for her and then we'll call it there.

2292
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:31,660
Okay.

2293
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:36,500
Whoever goes to the back rooms just, you know...

2294
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:41,420
That's a bad noise.

2295
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,080
Do you want to get away from here, little meeps?

2296
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:46,300
3, 2, 1...

2297
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,380
We gotta get off of it, remember?

2298
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:51,520
3, 2, 1...

2299
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:52,520
Off.

2300
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:56,840
Who died?

2301
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:09,840
What is that?

2302
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:11,560
What is that?

2303
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:21,240
Hello?

2304
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:21,860
Hey.

2305
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:24,460
Were you in the back rooms?

2306
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:26,420
No, I didn't die.

2307
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:27,880
What?

2308
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:28,840
What are you doing?

2309
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,320
I lived!

2310
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,500
Here's another one.

2311
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,220
Here's another one.

2312
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:33,880
Here's another one.

2313
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:36,720
Alright.

2314
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:40,380
You leave and then maybe I'll trigger it.

2315
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:41,540
You gotta count.

2316
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:43,040
I thought we were gonna leave at the same...

2317
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:43,320
Okay.

2318
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:53,840
These things kill you?

2319
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:57,540
Are they just spooky in here?

2320
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:00,640
They really do act so realistic, don't they?

2321
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:06,070
I'm 5 FPS.

2322
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:10,170
I'm guessing Lime died and left.

2323
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:16,310
Am I gonna be the only one here?

2324
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:40,560
I want to explore, but I will hold...I will refrain until we can all play together.

2325
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:43,860
I will refrain.

2326
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:44,580
Return to lobby!

2327
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,860
It was fun!

2328
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:57,380
Yeah!

2329
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:00,740
We'll find...one day find a game.

2330
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:04,140
We'll do chapter...we'll do the second one when Snuffy fixes her computer.

2331
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:05,160
Yeah, yeah.

2332
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,360
We have many games we must revisit.

2333
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:10,200
Wait, there's a cat up here.

2334
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,380
I never saw this cat.

2335
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,520
Yeah, I saw a cat in the beginning.

2336
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:14,700
He's very cute.

2337
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,440
Yeah, I didn't see him.

2338
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,860
He looks like Snuffy.

2339
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,020
Or Snuffy.

2340
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:19,160
Or Snuffy.

2341
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,460
Goodbye, Snuffy!

2342
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,280
Thank you, everyone!

2343
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,220
Thank you, everyone!

2344
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:24,800
Thank you!

2345
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:26,760
Bye-bye!

2346
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:29,640
Bye-bye!

2347
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:31,180
Bye-bye!

2348
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:32,480
Bye!

2349
02:11:39,330 --> 02:11:39,890
Bye!

2350
02:11:40,270 --> 02:11:40,490
Bye!

2351
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:46,570
Yay!

2352
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:49,870
Sorry for the shorter stream, guys!

2353
02:11:49,950 --> 02:11:52,530
Sorry that also we had so many issues with it.

2354
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:55,850
But I hope you guys enjoyed the game!

2355
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:56,870
It was very silly.

2356
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:57,810
It was fun.

2357
02:11:58,530 --> 02:12:02,070
I will be in Japan for the next week and a half.

2358
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:07,810
I'll be back on the 10th which is...

2359
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:09,050
Mint day.

2360
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:11,870
Minto no hi.

2361
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:14,650
The 3 is mi.

2362
02:12:15,550 --> 02:12:16,070
Mint.

2363
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:16,770
Min.

2364
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:18,790
And then the 10 is to.

2365
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:21,450
So I'll be back for Minto day!

2366
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:25,050
And...yeah.

2367
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:26,850
No, it's not Mario day.

2368
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:27,830
It's Minto day.

2369
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:33,990
Have a nice trip in Japan!

2370
02:12:34,130 --> 02:12:34,870
Thank you, guys!

2371
02:12:34,950 --> 02:12:35,590
Thank you!

2372
02:12:36,870 --> 02:12:37,730
I...I don't know.

2373
02:12:38,770 --> 02:12:40,110
Maybe I'll miss you or something.

2374
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:44,810
What am I...

2375
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:47,250
Who am I kidding?

2376
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:49,370
I can't wait to...

2377
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:52,730
I'm ready to get out the door.

2378
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:53,450
Here I go.

2379
02:12:54,030 --> 02:12:57,230
Here I leave on my trip.

2380
02:12:57,230 --> 02:12:57,610
OK.

2381
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,650
See you guys when I get back.

2382
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:00,750
But I won't miss you.

2383
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:01,650
You'll miss me.

2384
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:02,370
OK.

2385
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:04,970
No.

2386
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:09,330
Don't just cry the whole time.

2387
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:14,610
Don't make a mess.

2388
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:18,230
You know, wash the dishes and...

2389
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:21,190
Don't answer the door to strangers.

2390
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:23,030
Stop crying.

2391
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:24,730
Stop crying.

2392
02:13:24,730 --> 02:13:27,470
I know you guys will miss me so much.

2393
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:29,490
I won't miss you guys at all.

2394
02:13:31,070 --> 02:13:31,290
Yeah.

2395
02:13:32,510 --> 02:13:33,470
You know...

2396
02:13:36,710 --> 02:13:41,070
And, you know, don't keep counting down the days or anything till I'm back.

2397
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:43,190
Don't be thinking.

2398
02:13:44,710 --> 02:13:47,170
Don't, you know, party, party, party.

2399
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:57,290
I better come back and this maid cafe better be just as abandoned as I left it.

2400
02:13:57,690 --> 02:14:00,170
With cobwebs and with...

2401
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:04,970
dust all over the place.

2402
02:14:06,090 --> 02:14:06,890
OK.

2403
02:14:07,690 --> 02:14:08,550
Here I go.

2404
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:09,590
Alright.

2405
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:12,630
Cafe is closed now.

2406
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:14,510
See you later.

2407
02:14:15,670 --> 02:14:16,110
OK.

2408
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:49,530
That was me closing the door.

2409
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:54,390
Why did that...Why did that...

2410
02:14:55,510 --> 02:14:57,390
10 second sound effect...

2411
02:14:58,430 --> 02:14:59,930
Literally the video was 10 seconds.

2412
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:01,770
Why did it have a damn intro?

2413
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:03,850
Oh here we go.

2414
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:04,010
Wait.

2415
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:04,910
This is a better one.

2416
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:05,170
OK.

2417
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:06,210
I'm closing the door.

2418
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:07,910
Bye bye.

2419
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:09,970
Don't miss.

2420
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:11,250
Don't cry.

2421
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:12,250
Alright.

2422
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:12,810
Here I go.

2423
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:13,370
Here I go.

2424
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:13,630
OK.

2425
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:14,870
OK.

2426
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,160
I'm always haunting you.

2427
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:42,720
You thought you could get rid of me?

2428
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,200
I'm always haunting you.

2429
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:47,760
I'm always haunting you.

2430
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,680
I'm always haunting you.

2431
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,620
I'm always haunting you.

2432
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:04,960
Bye-bye.

2433
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:10,320
See you when I get back.

2434
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:11,040
Bye-bye.
