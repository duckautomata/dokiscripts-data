1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,620
I don't know whether to whisper or to talk softly.

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,440
I don't know.

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:37,700
Hello, if you came from the last ASMR, then hi again.

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,640
I think I'm more nervous for this one, though.

5
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,360
I should have done it first.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,300
I should have done the talking one first.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
I think it's more difficult.

8
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,660
I'm too self-conscious, maybe.

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,540
I don't know.

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:16,650
I said that it would be positive affirmations, but what if I just talked from normal?

11
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,390
I don't know.

12
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,190
I'm just... instant.

13
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,070
Because I'm embarrassed.

14
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,690
Metal Gear Brain Rock ASMR.

15
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,610
Metal Gear, Metal Gear.

16
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,350

21
00:02:44,010 --> 00:03:01,570
Metal When I look at these, I googled positive affirmations for a morning routine, and when I read these, they sound like things that would be said in severance.

22
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,530
I don't know why.

23
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,350
I don't know why.

24
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,350
It just seems weird.

25
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,710
Hold on, I'm gonna... I'm gonna read some of these.

26
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,830
It was like a big ol' list, you know?

27
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,650
So it says like... Oh, here we go.

28
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,610
Every decision I make is supported by my whole and inarguable experience.

29
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,590
And then the other one is, I alone hold the truth of who I am.

30
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,350
It's so dramatic.

31
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,910
That's why I was like, these feel awkward to say.

32
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,210
So, I don't really know what to talk about.

33
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,450
But maybe I can still help you relax a little bit.

34
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,870
For those who are wondering if you watch the ASMR with no talking, you might have heard this sound.

35
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,940
It's actually a little purse that I got recently.

36
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
This is a purse.

37
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,610
Yeah, this is...

38
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,090
And it's really cute because it's got a little ghost on it.

39
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,830
And I picked it up earlier and I was like, whoa, this thing's crunchy.

40
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,610
I think people will like it.

41
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,060
But ASMR is kind of sexy though, no?

42
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,700
Now that I think about it.

43
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,820
If it's just like, oh, this

44
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,140
is...

45
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,780
Oh la la.

46
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,350
I used a...

47
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,170
A...

48
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,630
This one...

49
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,770
Is from a...

50
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,510
A hand towel I got from Kanazawa Zoo.

51
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,590
I wanna go back there.

52
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,130
I wanna go back there.

53
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,870
Because they had...

54
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,130
A bunch of animals that...

55
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:52,510
Um...

56
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:54,850
That...

57
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,450
A lot of other zoos in Japan don't have.

58
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,270
Yeah.

59
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,330
Oh

60
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:14,880
no!

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,580
My video!

62
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,740
That was supposed to be long enough.

63
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,720
I wanna restart the stream.

64
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,120
It wasn't even 8K.

65
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,560
It's a 5K.

66
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,460
I

67
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,070
haven't been streaming for one hour.

68
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,410
Why?

69
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,060
The title did say there might be scuff.

70
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,940
You're so right.

71
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,680
I prepared...

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,340
I prepared for this moment.

73
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,660
So...

74
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,040
You can't say that.

75
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,080
You didn't expect it.

76
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,200
Okay.

77
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,250
Talk for...

78
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,630
How long this one go about for 30 minutes too since the other one did?

79
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,530
Or...

80
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,130
25?

81
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,810
30?

82
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,190
I don't know.

83
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,170
Sorry if you can hear my chair.

84
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,170
I feel like I'm moving around more.

85
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,950
With this...

86
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,210
I'm going to...

87
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,930
I'm going to...

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
Spock your lines for positive affirmation.

89
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,040
This is...

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,660
This is my makeup brush.

91
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,480
Where did you hear the poka poka by the way?

92
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,960
I've never heard that onomatopoeia before.

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,700
Um...

94
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,860
My brain...

95
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,240
I just thought it might sound nice.

96
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
Sound like a heartbeat maybe?

97
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,340
I don't even know.

98
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,520
MGS3 on positive affirmation.

99
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,940
I don't know...

100
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,200
If I can say that.

101
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,460
Okay, let me try.

102
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,180
Let me try.

103
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,360
Let me try.

104
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,280
Okay, one second.

105
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,380
It's so creepy now.

106
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm dead.

107
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,680
Creepy.

108
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,560
It's slowing because I'm tired.

109
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,240
I don't have a heartbeat.

110
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm dead.

111
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,850
The proper ASMR might cost at least.

112
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,050
Oh, some people ask what I'm using.

113
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,670
I'm using the...

114
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,250
Three...

115
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,350
Three deal.

116
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,350
But it's not...

117
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,830
It was a couple hundred dollars.

118
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,490
I would not pay that much because...

119
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,930
I do not do...

120
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,810
I do not do ASMR very often, so...

121
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,910
I...

122
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,710
I...

123
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,290
I would not get...

124
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,670
The very expensive one.

125
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,550
But I still wanted one that...

126
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,610
Sounds good.

127
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,270
Yeah, I think it's the...

128
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,430
The cool...

129
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,430
The cool...

130
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,810
Cool...

131
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,970
Cool...

132
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,250
One hundred.

133
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,610
I think that's the one that is...

135
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,210
Really expensive.

136
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,160
Gifted memberships.

137
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,080
Thank you, guys.

138
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,420
Thanks.

139
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,670
Because...

140
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,110
But I guess today is...

141
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,930
A bit of an answer for myself.

142
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,130
I won't...

143
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,430
I won't...

144
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,950
I won't do that again.

145
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,430
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,190
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,370
Creepy.

148
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,510
Creepy.

149
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,180
Can you even hear that?

150
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,880
Oh my gosh.

151
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,680
I just realized my noise gate...

152
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,380
Has been on this whole time.

153
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,800
Even in the last video.

154
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,580
I hope it sounded okay.

155
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,100
I don't know.

156
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,140
It sounded fine.

157
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,600
It sounded okay.

158
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,320
Was it okay?

159
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,920
I just turned it off.

160
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,790
I don't know, really.

161
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,430
Oh.

162
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,750
I can...

163
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,250
I can...

164
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,230
I can pretend to clean your ears.

165
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,110
Since I have...

166
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,210
I have the ear cleaner.

167
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,750
Does that sound even good?

168
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,180
You have so much ear wax.

169
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,660
You have so much ear wax.

170
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,130
Really deep in there.

171
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,950
Getting there nice and deep.

172
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,170
So much ear wax.

173
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,930
How can you even hear when I'm talking?

174
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,450
Um, um, um...

175
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,230
Okay.

176
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,450
I'm gonna have to get really deep.

177
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,580
Oh, positive affirmations.

178
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Positive affirmations.

179
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,780
It's not about your ear wax.

180
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:18,880
Oh my gosh.

181
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,260
Um...

182
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,720
I'll just...

183
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,880
I'll change the title...

184
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,500
Of the stream.

185
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,860
Um...

186
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,180
I can say...

187
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,000
Um...

188
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,720
I

189
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,460
can...

190
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,620
Since it's Sunday...

191
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Um...

192
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,420
You know, tomorrow you have to maybe go back.

193
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,470
I'm too embarrassed.

194
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,870
I can't do it.

195
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,830
I can't...

196
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,550
He's

197
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,580
getting mad at me for.

198
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,740
Why are you guys getting mad at me?

199
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,860
Oh, it's a public holiday.

200
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,560
Okay.

201
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,820
We'll just pretend, okay?

202
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,520
Pretend that it's...

203
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,680
Um...

204
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,560
Monday, of course.

205
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,620
That was not positive.

206
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
I was getting into it.

207
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,260
Okay.

208
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
Um...

209
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,920
Uh...

210
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,700
Um...

211
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,100
What are you reminding us?

212
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,940
I, I, I, I...

213
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,080
Um...

214
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,500
I...

215
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,540
Um...

216
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,740
I hope...

217
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,780
Um...

218
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,600
I, uh...

219
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,900
I hope you...

220
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,280
Um...

221
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Have a good day at work tomorrow.

222
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
And...

223
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,580
Um...

224
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,220
Um...

225
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,400
I hope you...

226
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,280
Um...

227
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,300
I hope you...

228
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,280
Um...

229
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,740
Get lots of work done.

230
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,340
And...

231
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,840
Uh...

232
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,320
You're...

233
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,280
Uh...

234
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,800
You're...

235
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,360
Doing a really...

236
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,720
Really good job.

237
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
So...

238
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,320
You know...

239
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,280
Um...

240
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,600
Make sure you don't work too hard too.

241
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,760
Because...

242
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:28,920
You...

243
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,720
Also need time to rest.

244
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,140
Okay?

245
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,760
So...

246
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,140
Oh...

247
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,640
But...

248
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,980
I can keep...

249
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,480
Cleaning your ears.

250
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,260
Because...

251
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,240
There's really just so much ear wax in here.

252
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,610
Okay.

253
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,510
I think I cleaned it all out.

254
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,310
What else can I tell you guys?

255
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,390
That will make you feel better.

256
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,390
What is it...

257
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,830
What is...

258
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,050
Something that you...

259
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,850
Wish to hear...

260
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,790
That will make you feel better.

261
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,030
No...

262
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,250
I can't bring pause because she will...

263
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,430
Be noisy.

264
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,980
Um...

265
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,560
I can say...

266
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,400
I can say...

267
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,520
I can say...

268
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,020
Hey...

269
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:54,940
You...

270
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,400
Listening...

271
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
Right now...

272
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,250
Sorry.

273
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,650
I think that was too loud.

274
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,710
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

275
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,810
Do you want me to keep blowing in your ear?

276
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,200
I feel less nervous when I'm not talking.

277
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,830
Maybe I will...

278
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,530
Um...

279
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,930
Maybe I will...

280
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,610
Not do...

281
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,890
Talking ASMR anymore.

282
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,890
It's too much...

283
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,590
It's too much pressure.

284
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,570
Oh my gosh.

285
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,630
I was at the meet and greet yesterday.

286
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,570
And...

287
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,990
I don't know if you're listening.

288
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,890
But someone was like...

289
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,550
Oh...

290
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,890
I really loved Fauna's ASMR.

291
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:00,870
So...

292
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,570
I'm looking forward to your ASMR tomorrow.

293
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,390
And I was like...

294
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,670
Pressure...

295
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,850
Too much pressure.

296
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,590
I was like...

297
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,450
It won't be...

298
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,750
It won't be as good as Fauna's.

299
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,770
So...

300
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,650
Can you say...

301
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,510
Your Oshii won't graduate.

302
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,690
Oh my gosh, wait.

303
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,910
Your Audi...

304
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,230
Loves VTubers.

305
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,050
Your Audi...

306
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,090
Enjoys eating oranges.

307
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,770
Your Audi...

308
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,730
Is an arsonist.

309
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,210
Your Audi...

310
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,170
Is cringe...

311
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:46,650
And free.

312
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,710
Your Audi...

313
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,450
Lotions their whole body.

314
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,550
Out...

315
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,510
You guys know...

316
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,510
You guys know severance, no?

317
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,890
Like your innie and your outie.

318
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,750
O U D T I E.

319
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,550
Or out...

320
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,470
Or is it one T?

321
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,730
I don't know actually.

322
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,190
Really?

323
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,070
I don't know?

324
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,110
I thought it was a meme...

325
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,090
Where it was like your outie.

326
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,550
Okay, I'll explain.

327
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,730
So basically in severance...

328
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,230
It's like...

329
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,510
It's like...

330
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,370
You...

331
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,790
Get a job at this place called...

332
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,670
Lumen Corporation, right?

333
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,770
And then...

334
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,710
When you work on the severance floor...

335
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,530
When you go to work...

336
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:40,870
You...

337
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,430
You switch to a different person basically.

338
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,070
And so...

339
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,350
Sometimes...

340
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,830
There will be...

341
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,390
So...

342
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,670
It's called the innie's and the outie's.

343
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,250
The innie...

344
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,170
Like the belly button.

345
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,830
So the innie's are the people that work...

346
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,190
On the severance floor.

347
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,790
And then the outie are the outside people.

348
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,770
And so...

349
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,710
Sometimes the innie's will go to therapy.

350
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,410
And there will be...

351
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,550
A lady there.

352
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,970
And she explains things...

353
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,230
She says things about...

354
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,230
About the outie.

355
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,430
So that they...

356
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,770
Feel a little bit more connected to them.

357
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,050
And so...

358
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,850
She'll say...

359
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,970
Really weird things.

360
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,890
Like...

361
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,770
Your outie...

362
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,150
Drives a sports car.

363
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,930
Or something like that.

364
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:30,570
You know?

365
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,570
And they're like...

366
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:32,970
Oh...

367
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,510
My outie is so cool!

368
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,570
So...

369
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,770
Yeah, this isn't spoilers.

370
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,490
Don't worry.

371
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,610
I wouldn't spoil.

372
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,780
Writing a script might help.

373
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,020
But I don't know.

374
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,120
Because I...

375
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,680
Still get nervous.

376
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,960
I think I'm nervous if I see you guys on screen.

377
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,040
Maybe...

378
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,240
I...

379
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,780
Maybe I...

380
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,490
You make us tokidoki too.

381
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
Are you tokidoki?

382
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,320
Is it because I sound so close?

383
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,880
Oh!

384
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,400
Sorry!

385
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,420
I accidentally dropped something.

386
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,760
I wonder why though...

387
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,760
Does that do anything?

388
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,460
Closer?

389
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,200
I can't because it's...

390
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,780
It's basically the base of my mic.

391
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,780
So...

392
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,590
It's not like I can...

393
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,750
Get closer.

394
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,470
Maybe I can find something that makes...

395
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,610
That sounds different.

396
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,640
It's like I'm cleaning...

397
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm washing the dishes.

398
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,420
Just like a proper maid would.

399
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,520
Just

400
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,980
like a proper maid.

401
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,730
You...

402
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,290
You...

403
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,210
Are...

404
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,520
Just know that...

405
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,450
You've already gotten...

406
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,630
This far.

407
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,370
And...

408
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,010
Also...

409
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:44,670
Because...

410
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,430
I'm haunting...

411
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,510
Believe in you.

412
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,830
Okay?

413
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,030
And...

414
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,590
Also...

415
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,250
Because...

416
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,290
I can't...

417
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,170
Possess you...

418
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,430
If...

419
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,810
You are dead.

420
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,250
So...

421
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,570
Make sure...

422
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,470
That you...

423
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,890
Take care of yourself.

424
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,290
Okay?

425
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,320
Positive affirmation.

426
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,360
That's two for two.

427
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,820
Yeah.

428
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,320
Yes.

429
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,660
You can beat Elden Ring.

430
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
And you can do it...

431
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,740
With minimum...

432
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,040
Deaths.

433
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
I believe.

434
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,710
Can I do it with ten...

435
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,530
Vicar?

436
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,950
What is that?

437
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,510
Uh...

438
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,770
Meme?

439
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,150
Yeah.

440
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:48,890
Yeah.

441
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,990
You can do it.

442
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,930
Level one.

443
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,430
No way.

444
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:54,910
Yeah.

445
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,190
Yeah.

446
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,230
Yeah.

447
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,110
You can do it.

448
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,590
One HP in a dream.

449
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,740
No summons.

450
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:07,960
One...

451
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,440
It's right here, baby.

452
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,030
Here's your motivation.

453
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,390
Get motivated.

454
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,820
Probably not, huh?

455
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,580
Don't use this for actual...

456
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,500
Relaxation.

457
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,540
I think you...

458
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,520
Should use this...

459
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,640
For...

460
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,300
Listening.

461
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,640
And then...

462
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,300
The actual ASMR...

463
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,740
That I did before...

464
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,600
For relaxing.

465
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,500
Okay?

466
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:31,820
O...

467
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,620
Oh, wait.

468
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,860
I think it's too loud, though.

469
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,460
I don't

470
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,690
know how to hum quietly.

471
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,090
Mm-hmm.

472
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:04,490
Mm-hmm.

473
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,690
Mm...

474
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,790
Mm-hmm...

475
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:22,710
Mm-hmm...

476
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:32,580
What's the thing that I can... instead that would not be so loud, I think?

477
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,000
It's too high!

478
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,710
It's too high!

479
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,550
I don't think this is relaxing at all.

480
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,960
I don't know.

481
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,870
The heartbeat earlier was nice.

482
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,370
No, I was too embarrassed.

483
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,650
I don't know how to hum.

484
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,410
That wouldn't be too loud.

485
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,550
So, I'm sorry.

486
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,320
I will end it in about a minute.

487
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,630
Isabelle's lullaby.

488
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,810
I'm sorry, I don't know why.

489
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,650
It's like Isabelle from Animal Crossing.

490
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,340
Hold on, let me try this.

491
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,180
Thank you guys for the ASMR.

492
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,780
Thank you for listening.

493
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:29,320
Sorry that... that... that it's awkward.

494
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,020
But maybe that is the... the minto way.

495
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
That it's awkward.

496
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,400
Probably.

497
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,720
So, I hope that, um, maybe the first one, the first ASMR was able to calm me down.

498
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,780
And that maybe this one could calm me down maybe a little bit.

499
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,720
Maybe.

500
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,340
Oops, sorry for sniffing in your ear.

501
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,640
Sorry for sniffing in your ear.

502
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,280
Sniff on.

503
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,680
Sniff more.

504
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,020
Wait.

505
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,360
Wait, my mic.

506
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,740
It does... it smells different.

507
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,400
It smells different on this side than it does on this side.

508
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:39,590
It smells like... it smells burnt.

509
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,730
I don't think that's a good thing.

510
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,510
weird.

511
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,190
But it doesn't smell bad.

512
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,550
It smells like ear wax.

513
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,130
It smells good.

514
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,310
It might be that it's your brain and it's overworking.

515
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,110
So you should go to sleep.

516
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,990
If it's time to go to sleep for you.

517
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,970
Or you should go to sleep later.

518
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,450
Or you're probably... if you re-listen to this.

519
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,590
I hope that you have good dreams.

520
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,810
And that you can get lots of rest.

521
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,690
And that when you wake up, you feel so refreshed.

522
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,490
Because you were like, wow.

523
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,050
Mito lured me to sleep.

524
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,610
Hakushu, hakushu.

525
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,470
Hakushu, hakushu.

526
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,450
Hakushu, hakushu.

527
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:33,890
Yeah.

528
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,110
So, thank you for listening.

529
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,410
And have a good rest of your night.

530
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,400
Hakushu.

531
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,440
I hope it doesn't happen.

532
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,020
Bye!

533
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,160
Bye!

534
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:47,980
Bye!

535
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,100
Bye!
