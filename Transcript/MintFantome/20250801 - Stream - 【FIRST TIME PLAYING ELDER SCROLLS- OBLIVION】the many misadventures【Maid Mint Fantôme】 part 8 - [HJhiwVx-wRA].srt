00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,700
Hello!

2
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,520
Howdy doody!

3
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,700
Howdy!

4
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,010
Howdy!

5
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,690
Howdy howdy!

6
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,310
Get him loud.

7
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,910
Wait, how am I... Am I okay?

8
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,150
Sorry, I just did some stuff.

9
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,210
I just did some stuff.

10
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,850
Welcome to membership, thank you!

11
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,090
Howdy do!

12
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,470
Howdy do!

13
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,330
Ah, ah, ah... Yes.

14
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,990
Come on, everybody!

15
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,210
Welcome, we!

16
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,010
Welcome back to Oblivion.

17
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,550
I'll be honest.

18
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,650
Might be my last Oblivion.

19
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,490
Maybe for a while.

20
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,650
Maybe in general.

21
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,870
I don't know, I'm feeling... I don't know...

22
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,580
I don't know, I'm just feeling a little... I'm not burnt out from it.

23
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,160
But I think I played a lot of it at the beginning and then, you know...

24
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,200
I like the side quest so much more than the actual story.

25
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,050
And so, I just... I'm like, oh, well, you know...

26
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,790
I could quote-unquote beat the game.

27
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,450
But like, I like the side quest so much more.

28
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,010
Tudius Sextius must die today then.

29
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,810
Yeah, I would like to do that.

30
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,550
I would like to murder him.

31
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,470
And the other brother.

32
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,030
But yeah...

33
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,110
Friendship with Oblivion ended.

34
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,810
Time for Skyrim.

35
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,450
Yeah, I got my house.

36
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,170
I think the last thing that I...

37
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,830
The big last thing I wanted to do was...

38
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,770
Was murder those people.

39
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,770
Of course I want to do more murdering.

40
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,350
I really like the murder.

41
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,270
I really like the murder.

42
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,420
Sorry, I was moving stuff.

43
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,400
But yeah...

44
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,060
Yeah, we'll see.

45
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,060
You know...

46
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,740
Hehehehe.

47
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,380
Hehehehe.

48
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,500
Hehehehe.

49
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,600
Rip and tear.

50
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,640
But...

51
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,380
You know...

52
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,060
I was like, what can I do today?

53
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,900
For...

54
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,540
For...

55
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,080
For in the middle...

56
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm trying to figure out...

57
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,500
I want to do like a mid...

58
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,360
Day stream.

59
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,680
Maybe Fridays.

60
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,580
Kind of get you through that.

61
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,980
Well, Friday is exciting.

62
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,060
Because it's the weekend.

63
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,080
Weekend.

64
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,000
Weekend.

65
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,260
Weekend.

66
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,020
It's Friday.

67
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,140
Friday.

68
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,680
Imagine Minto accidentally finishes...

69
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,660
The DLCs before the main quest.

70
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,900
All...

71
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,580
All...

72
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,380
Wait, DLC?

73
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,720
What's the DLC?

74
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,910
Minto Friday.

75
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,170
It's Friday, everybody.

76
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,150
And...

77
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,750
It's...

78
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,430
August.

79
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,410
Happy August!

80
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,590
Happy August!

81
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,130
Good night, Brandon!

82
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,290
Happy, happy August.

83
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,030
You're invited to a double date?

84
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,470
Which wife are you bringing?

85
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,990
Think quick!

86
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:09,850
Um...

87
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,270
Ha...

88
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:10,870
Uh...

89
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,610
Uh...

90
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,430
Uh...

91
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,130
Koharu!

92
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,630
Blue Archive Koharu!

93
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,390
Hehehehe.

94
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,780
She...

95
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,700
August already.

96
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
That's how I feel.

97
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,720
I feel.

98
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,060
Oh my goodness.

99
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,540
Hyemma!

100
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,100
Welcome to Bamboo Shiptakiel.

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,780
What's the DLC?

102
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,200
Wait a second!

103
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,040
I never even got to see the...

104
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,100
...

105
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,940
...

106
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,000
...

107
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,100
...

108
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,120
...

109
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,340
...

110
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,540
...

111
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,360
Lady!

112
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,900
How do I find her?

113
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,020
Oh wait, there was that guy, too, who was just like, I'm your biggest fan.

114
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,660
That's the DLC!

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,660
Oh, how to fake your funds.

116
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you!

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Paying tax on my recently acquired Minky shirt, boss.

118
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,360
Thanks for ordering it, Azure!

119
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,060
Thank you!

120
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,100
Did I get the DLC?

121
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,780
How do I know?

122
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,680
DLC...

123
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,160
Deluxe upgrade?

124
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,500
Wait...

125
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,960
Is it the deluxe upgrade?

126
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,100
Oh, I have it already!

127
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,500
It's done!

128
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,880
No way?

129
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,820
Really?

130
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,700
It's included...

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:33,880
Ah!

132
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,680
Oh, how do you find vengeance?

133
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,920
DLC these nights?

134
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,540
Okay.

135
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,640
Present them.

136
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,050
Where are they?

137
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,220
I'm calling you out on your bluff.

138
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,620
Present them.

139
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,000
While I earn a dollar, I earn a dime.

140
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,920
That's why I watch Minky on Company Time!

141
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,340
Yahoo!

142
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,560
Okay.

143
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,360
Well, maybe we can find her.

144
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,700
What did we last do?

145
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:39,940
Brother?

146
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:40,720
Oh!

147
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
That's the guy I tried to kill, no?

148
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,480
I like how I saved literally...

149
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,460
Oh, this is an autosave.

150
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,420
It's like...

151
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,500
10 seconds later.

152
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:48,960
Yeah!

153
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,740
I was sneaking into his house to try and kill him!

154
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:52,840
Yeah!

155
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,420
Master's on the phone, happy birthday!

156
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Happy, happy birthday!

157
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,260
Minky had a fun time at the ecchi con.

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,320
She got to go to a mini cafe and get a picture with a blue archive cosplayer!

159
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,780
Did she post?

160
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,220
Did she post it?

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,340
Is this one of the brothers I'm trying to kill?

162
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh, I guess so.

163
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,680
He knows that I'm like trying to sneak into his house.

164
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,080
Wait!

165
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,840
Can you guys tell me how to...

166
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,020
Can you guys tell me...

167
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,760
Where's the nene nene lady?

168
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,240
Where?

169
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,620
Hi Minto.

170
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,080
Hello!

171
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,320
You seem a lot better today.

172
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Yeah!

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:42,920
Yeah!

174
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,440
Yeah!

175
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm usually...

176
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,720
I was...

177
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,800
I was better yesterday.

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,960
In the shivering aisles.

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,960
Water?

180
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,620
The best type of nut.

181
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,100
I like cashews.

182
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,840
Is this an aisle?

183
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,240
Wait.

184
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,920
Nope.

185
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,800
Check the lake next to Brazil.

186
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,880
Where's Brazil?

187
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,890
It's not here.

188
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,750
Mentioning this before I forget to.

189
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,590
I recently saw your cover of Kansankobody yesterday.

190
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,630
I instantly fell in love with your voice.

191
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,050
Thank you, Robin!

192
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,170
Thank you!

193
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,150
Good afternoon, Meantown.

194
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,270
Good afternoon, Phil!

195
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,610
Thank you for the very spooky Donald.

196
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,750
See that...

197
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,350
Michi made a drawing of me.

198
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,730
Wait, what?

199
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,990
She did?

200
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,430
When?

201
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,770
In the big bay near...

202
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:02,670
Breville!

203
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,410
Okay.

204
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,690
There's an island with a magic door.

205
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,370
Okay.

206
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,610
It must be this!

207
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:07,990
Oh!

208
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,850
I was right the first time I felt it.

209
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,950
In my...

210
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,170
Ectoplasmic bones!

211
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,390
Wow!

212
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,350
Let's see how I fight the gatekeeper monster, then go to the mania side.

213
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,110
It's called...

214
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,290
The quest is called Strange Door in...

215
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:23,690
Nib...

216
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,710
Nibren Bay.

217
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,690
Okay.

218
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,650
Alright!

219
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,850
We can go!

220
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,310
We can go!

221
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,850
We can go!

222
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:30,830
Where am I now?

223
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,690
I'm right here, right?

224
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,170
Yeah, we're doing paranoia.

225
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,430
Hello!

226
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,590
Hello?

227
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,950
I'm not trying to murder.

228
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,470
What is it?

229
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,130
Nothing.

230
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,470
I'm trying...

231
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,130
What is it now?

232
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,150
I'm trying to murder!

233
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,330
I'm trying to murder!

234
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,030
Wait.

235
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,530
This isn't his house.

236
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,930
That's Glarthur's house.

237
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,190
We'll kill him later.

238
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,270
This is it.

239
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,050
If I go in, he gets mad at me.

240
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,290
Happy Friday!

241
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,670
Even if you're not coming to Otaku Town this year, I'm still hoping...

242
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,510
To meet my fellow wisps at my hometown convention next weekend.

243
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,250
Thank you for streaming during functioning weeb hours.

244
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,490
Yeah!

245
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,550
Have fun!

246
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:07,830
Oh.

247
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,910
Hello.

248
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,850
Why is everybody hating on me?

249
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,910
Bunch of haters.

250
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,890
My tea be hot.

251
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,050
The tea?

252
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,010
There's piping.

253
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,630
Oh my god.

254
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,150
You think I could just go inside now?

255
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,930
Oh shoot!

256
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,210
I forgot sea...

257
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,910
Well...

258
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,110
Might as well use it.

259
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,650
I thought sea was Crouch.

260
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,000
Uh...

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,900
Is that him right there?

262
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,260
Aw man.

263
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,320
How'd you know?

264
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,380
I'm David of Surili Brothers Vineyard.

265
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
Gaston is my brother.

266
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,300
From our vineyards come the finest wines in Tamriel.

267
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah, I gotta kill you.

268
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,540
Finer than Tamika's?

269
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,160
Yeah, well, in all honesty, no.

270
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,140
But our wines are very good.

271
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,940
And much cheaper than Tamika's very fine product, I assure you.

272
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,340
Glarthor.

273
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,840
Our neighbor.

274
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,200
A bit eccentric.

275
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,260
Why?

276
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,480
Is there something I should know?

277
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,000
No.

278
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,260
Never mind.

279
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,740
Very well.

280
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,400
Bye.

281
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,420
Bye.

282
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,220
Can I walk in around them?

283
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,560
Wait, he's not following me.

284
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,700
I think he's actually fine.

285
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,540
I'm stealing.

286
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,560
I've stolen...

287
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,740
Oh, this is the wrong door.

288
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,620
I don't learn my lesson, everybody.

289
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,340
Everyone.

290
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,120
I've never learned my lesson.

291
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,300
Not even once.

292
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,840
I've never learned my lesson, even once.

293
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I always go for the root.

294
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,980
And I always go into the wrong door.

295
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,960
My gosh.

296
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,740
Eat Tina.

297
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,400
You okay?

298
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh!

299
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,780
Now it's locked!

300
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,500
Okay, he really doesn't want us around.

301
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,580
What's your story?

302
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,820
Oh, how's your wine?

303
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,900
What can I do for you?

304
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,540
Wait, Tamika.

305
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,500
Gosh!

306
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I thank you so much for the best gift of...

307
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,300
Why?

308
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,020
Thank you!

309
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,540
Why?

310
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,660
Harwin is another one of those goblin hunters at the Fighters Guild.

311
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,100
She's always talking about her goblin killing tactics.

312
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Good day.

313
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,820
All right.

314
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,840
I think we can give up on this quest for now.

315
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,980
I'm gonna fast travel to...

316
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,220
Braville.

317
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,720
Sorry, Glarther.

318
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,060
Well, that will be the grand finale of death.

319
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,240
Probably.

320
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,280
Oh, have I been here before?

321
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,620
Hello.

322
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,480
Hi.

323
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,860
I don't think so.

324
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,200
It looks like a summer camp.

325
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,140
Why is it always raining?

326
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,340
Un golem.

327
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,520
I'm sorry, but I'm really not one for engaging in conversation.

328
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,020
Please, leave me.

329
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,580
Wow.

330
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,600
Wow.

331
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,800
Lucky old lady.

332
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,880
Wait, you can reach up, kiss the lucky old lady on the cheek, and hope you'll get your wish?

333
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,500
Okay.

334
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,920
All right, everybody.

335
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,040
Kiss me on the cheek.

336
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,660
What the?

337
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,040
Uh-oh.

338
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,340
I think he stole it from me.

339
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,920
Okay.

340
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,080
Wait.

341
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm sorry, but I'm really not one friend.

342
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,460
Okay.

343
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,730
We need to leave.

344
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,090
Kiss this old lady on the cheek.

345
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,990
He's stomping around.

346
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,410
I see you're a follower of the Gray Fox, too.

347
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,790
How'd you know?

348
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,350
How'd you know?

349
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:19,990
Oh, okay.

350
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,130
See you later.

351
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,130
Sorry.

352
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,630
Can you spare a coin?

353
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,250
Wretched are you?

354
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,130
Who gives these people these names?

355
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,830
Do you think they pick them themselves?

356
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,030
Which cheek?

357
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,670
What about you?

358
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,290
What's your name?

359
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,970
Me children are starving.

360
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,330
Please help.

361
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,370
What are you cheating in?

362
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,370
What are you cheating in?

363
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:53,970
Cards.

364
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,150
How do I get out of this town?

365
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,750
I'm stuck at summer camp.

366
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,610
How are you?

367
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,710
Is this a door?

368
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,290
What are you guarding?

369
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,190
Me children are starving.

370
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,190
Oh, here we go.

371
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:13,930
Wait.

372
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,190
Uh.

373
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,530
Yes?

374
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,070
Let's try this bridge over here.

375
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,000
Me children are starving.

376
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,350
Okay, well, you know.

377
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,970
Oh, oh shoot.

378
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,290
Oh.

379
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,910
I almost didn't make it.

380
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,470
Parkour.

381
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,600
Who are you?

382
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,420
Greenum.

383
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,120
Someone who is actually kind to me.

384
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,060
I'm the city swimmer.

385
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,380
Does anyone see city swimmer?

386
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,220
Is he gliding beneath the silver water?

387
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,200
Is he creeping round a corner, hugging a wall, silent as a shadow in the dark?

388
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,620
No, I am here.

389
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:09,320
I stand proud before you, city swimmer, trainer of the perspective sneaker, the sly sliding unseen.

390
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,360
I found you very easily.

391
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,020
What?

392
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,240
You have not eyes to see?

393
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,400
The castle, of course.

394
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,020
The only challenge worthy of a swift sneaker.

395
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,760
Farewell.

396
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,880
What is she yapping about?

397
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,720
I actually don't get it.

398
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm the city swimmer.

399
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,140
Why aren't you the city sneaker?

400
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,420
Why aren't you the city sneaker?

401
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,360
Sounds like you're not doing your job very well.

402
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,580
If you're supposed to be sneaking, but everyone sees you swimming.

403
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,820
Yes.

404
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:49,940
Yes.

405
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,340
Here we go.

406
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Wait.

407
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,100
Yeah, this should be good.

408
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,650
I would love to be an Oblivion NPC.

409
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,630
What?

410
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,450
Oh, never mind.

411
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,330
This is not...

412
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:06,350
I'm listening.

413
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,190
This is not a door to the outside.

414
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,370
It did say great hall, but I thought it would be an outside hall.

415
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,890
It literally said castle.

416
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,690
You know...

417
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,900
It says great hall.

418
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,960
It doesn't say castle.

419
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,980
Yes, it does.

420
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,640
You're right.

421
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,660
I...

422
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,620
What's this about?

423
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,160
Is she...

424
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,020
Is she swimming?

425
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,740
What's your name?

426
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,440
Breville.

427
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,180
Hello?

428
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,540
You exist?

429
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,120
Hello?

430
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, whoops.

431
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,260
Sorry.

432
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,400
I'm sorry to impose upon you like this, but I'm in need of assistance and I don't know what to do.

433
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,200
My husband, Alaron, is missing.

434
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,540
Please explain how a hall can be outside.

435
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,170
Look.

436
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,330
I never claimed to be a hall expert like you.

437
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,170
Look at how smiley she is.

438
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,110
She even put on makeup.

439
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,190
Those lips are not natural.

440
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,190
It all started when Alaron became foolish and started gambling.

441
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,890
He's foolish!

442
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,570
He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard-earned money on bets.

443
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,550
I told him to stop, but he didn't listen.

444
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,630
He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City.

445
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,790
It didn't take long for Alaron to begin losing.

446
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,590
I would hate to...

447
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,150
He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets.

448
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,790
Live in a time without umbrellas.

449
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,890
As you can imagine, it didn't pay off.

450
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,710
He ended up owing around 500 gold.

451
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,370
He could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.

452
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,370
How much money do I have?

453
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,670
Well, what happened to him?

454
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,550
I think your man got by the Mafia.

455
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,890
The usurer does not sound like a real person.

456
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,510
To meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge.

457
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,070
He hasn't returned since.

458
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,910
I fear for his life.

459
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,110
Her teeth look weird.

460
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,850
She's got a bit of an underbite, yeah.

461
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,570
Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Alaron again.

462
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,150
Actually, she really looks like a...

463
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,150
Like a...

464
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,110
Like a...

465
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,490
An alien disguised as a human.

466
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,370
There's just something really uncanny about her.

467
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,170
I'll help you.

468
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,770
I will?

469
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,010
Oh, yeah, I will.

470
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,890
Please be careful.

471
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,790
I don't wish any harm to befall you either.

472
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,910
It's the way her neck sticks out like at an angle.

473
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,750
I don't... I don't know.

474
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:12,990
Goodbye.

475
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,530
Farewell and be careful.

476
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,730
Curtain is not to be trusted.

477
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,710
Who's Curtain?

478
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,330
Hello.

479
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,930
Okay, here we go, here we go.

480
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,510
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

481
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,630
Hi, Mito.

482
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,780
I never use umbrellas as the nine divines in ten...

483
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay.

484
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,640
We still have never found my horse.

485
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:47,880
If I fast travel to a stable, my horse will appear!

486
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,260
And he never has!

487
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,600
My

488
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,260
horse will be here somewhere.

489
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,090
Oops, sorry, oh gosh, I'm trying to remember how to play this game.

490
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,050
If you are looking to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Isabeau.

491
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:15,910
Isabeau!

492
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,070
Nah, I have a horse.

493
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,530
Good day!

494
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,250
Good day!

495
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:19,850
Go ahead!

496
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,310
Oh, it stopped raining!

497
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,810
I'm about to go swim!

498
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,130
Is that our...

499
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,710
Is that our little island?

500
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,770
Wait, wait.

501
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,250
Or is that our little island?

502
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,010
Wait, there's so many little islands?

503
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,550
Ah!

504
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,570
That...

505
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,430
That is our island, I think.

506
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,730
Must be gold ship.

507
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,670
What's on that one island?

508
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,530
It looks like a man side profile with a nose.

509
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,470
Let's go check it out.

510
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,870
I'm swimming.

511
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,270
Oh, I can't...

512
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,770
Wait, go up.

513
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,390
Oh, please.

514
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,470
I can't see.

515
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,930
There we go.

516
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,470
I won't get attacked in the water, will I?

517
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,270
Go find out.

518
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,890
I am!

519
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,430
I am!

520
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,650
What the...

521
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,190
Oh, there's people.

522
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,450
Definitely...

523
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,570
Foes.

524
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,690
Not friends.

525
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,910
Wait, it is a face!

526
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,150
Wait, it is a...

527
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,790
Oh my gosh!

528
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,300
Sneaky.

529
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,220
Come on.

530
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,420
Come on, get up there.

531
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,920
Sneak, sneak.

532
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,300
Kill him.

533
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,100
What the heck is...

534
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,040
A strange door?

535
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,940
Is this the door?

536
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,840
Kill!

537
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,620
Wait, did they die?

538
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Wait.

539
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,820
No?

540
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,380
Are they friends?

541
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Actually, I can't tell.

542
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:05,820
Look.

543
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,000
Um...

544
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,680
It wasn't me!

545
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,020
Oops.

546
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,440
Uh, hold on, hold on.

547
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,840
Don't run.

548
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,160
It was...

549
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,040
Could have been a literal mosquito.

550
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,560
I found a strange...

551
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,400
Door.

552
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Why are they running?

553
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,760
Not my arrow, officer.

554
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,660
Why are they running?

555
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,180
Wait, are they gone?

556
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,960
Oh, no.

557
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,920
Wait, please!

558
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,360
Please!

559
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,760
It's not right!

560
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:44,880
It's not right!

561
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,500
Here comes another one!

562
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,040
Madness!

563
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,780
Why?

564
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,440
Why?

565
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,020
Everything is wrong!

566
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,280
It can't be done!

567
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,640
Stay away from me!

568
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,360
Here comes another one!

569
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,260
You can't make me go back!

570
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
I will kill you all!

571
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,920
You're all going to die!

572
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,620
Stay back!

573
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,320
This one's violent!

574
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,400
Ah!

575
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,360
Ha!

576
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,020
Ha!

577
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,380
Ah!

578
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,060
Good job, Mr. Ha!

579
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,560
Sorry.

580
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,700
I'd rather not think so much for the five gifted.

581
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,300
Strange door.

582
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,680
I don't know where it came from, and I don't want to.

583
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,300
Those who've gone in have come back out...

584
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:25,960
Wrong.

585
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,580
I'm just here to warn folks to stay away.

586
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,840
Is this it?

587
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,540
Is this the...

588
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,460
What happened to them?

589
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,420
Look for yourself!

590
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
Their brains are addled!

591
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,100
Got no sense!

592
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,900
Got no sense!

593
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,960
Hmm...

594
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,780
I'm going in.

595
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,060
Ha!

596
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,640
It's your funeral.

597
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm just here to warn people, not keep them out.

598
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,220
Go ahead in!

599
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,200
I'll be here to clean up the mess when you come out.

600
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,820
Got no sense!

601
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,820
Can I take...

602
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,520
What's he got?

603
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,000
He's got some scruffy shoes.

604
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,760
Where's the hallelujah?

605
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,060
Unworthy!

606
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,280
Unworthy!

607
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:02,940
Unworthy!

608
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,200
Unworthy!

609
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,260
Useless mortal meat!

610
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,280
Walking bag of dumb!

611
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:07,740
I'm going in!

612
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,380
What?

613
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,640
Who said that?

614
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,380
Oh my gosh!

615
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,880
This is so mysterious and fun!

616
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:14,980
Wait, come here!

617
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,260
Come here!

618
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,520
A nice effort though!

619
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,820
Shame is dead!

620
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,240
These things happen...

621
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,140
Zora's fleeing for their life!

622
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,300
Ha!

623
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,540
Ha!

624
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,580
Bring me a champion!

625
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,460
Rend the flesh of my foes!

626
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,780
A mortal champion!

627
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,660
To wade through the entrails of my...

628
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,900
I think I scared him!

629
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,620
Ha!

630
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:35,860
Ha!

631
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,760
Ha!

632
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,500
Wait, is the...

633
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,700
Is the door talking to me?

634
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,480
Really?

635
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,920
Do come in!

636
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,300
It's lovely in the aisles right now.

637
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,960
Perfect time for a visit.

638
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,620
Am I going crazy already?

639
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,320
Let's go.

640
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,360
Taking a...

641
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,140
Black tar.

642
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,440
Let's go.

643
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,100
Let's go.

644
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,320
Re-listen to your karaoke's every now and then.

645
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,600
I forgot you sang Wind Nocturne for the first Lunar game.

646
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:01,920
Yeah!

647
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,800
I just played and beat that game quite recently.

648
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,200
Still playing the second Lunar.

649
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,940
Yeah!

650
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,700
I did play...

651
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,560
I did sing that!

652
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:09,900
Hello?

653
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,660
There we go.

654
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,580
Is there anything else in here?

655
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,220
Okay, let's go in.

656
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,220
To the fringe!

657
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,880
Yahoo!

658
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,100
Oh my gosh!

659
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,720
Oh!

660
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,120
Was it you talking to me?

661
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,900
Let's be civil, shall we?

662
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,040
Please, have a seat.

663
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,100
Okay.

664
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,240
Please, have a seat.

665
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,780
I'm sitting.

666
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,380
Yes?

667
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,480
What can I do for you?

668
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,780
I imagine you're here above the door.

669
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,740
Uh-huh.

670
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,700
Strange door.

671
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes.

672
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,940
You have entered, and now you are here.

673
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,420
Yeah.

674
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,620
Amazing.

675
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,940
Truly.

676
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,360
Are you the jester?

677
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,640
Who are you?

678
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,520
I am Haskell, Chamberlain to the Lord Sheogorath.

679
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,820
Okay.

680
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,040
What is this place?

681
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,160
You approach the Shivering Isles.

682
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:12,560
Through the door behind me lies the realm of Sheogorath, Prince of Madness, Lord of the Neverthead.

683
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,360
Oh wait, you guys said I have to fight something, right?

684
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,580
Why did that door appear?

685
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,080
Because my lord wills it to be so.

686
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,660
It poses no danger to Mundus.

687
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,820
No compact has been violated.

688
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,220
It is a doorway.

689
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,280
An invitation.

690
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,280
Perhaps you will accept it for what it is.

691
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,560
What do you want with me?

692
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,220
For you?

693
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,300
I do not know.

694
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,820
My lord seeks a mortal to act as his champion.

695
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,300
I'm the champion!

696
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
I'm the hero!

697
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,980
And to fathom it is a foolish endeavor.

698
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,140
He looks so disgusted with me.

699
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,200
His will is his own.

700
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,260
His reality follows suit.

701
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,160
You are here because you chose to enter.

702
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,640
You were not summoned.

703
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,300
And the people outside?

704
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,340
They entered this realm and were ill-prepared.

705
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,780
Their minds are now the property of my lord.

706
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,000
How can they be cured?

707
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,600
Well...

708
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,280
Murdered that guy.

709
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,000
Cured?

710
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,520
You speak as if they are diseased.

711
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,040
They live now in another state of being.

712
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,940
Perhaps it is you who needs a cure.

713
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,240
Free run?

714
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,260
Foot licker.

715
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank you for...

716
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,520
the gift and...

717
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,600
Thank you.

718
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,020
What happens now?

719
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,180
You do as you will.

720
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
You may leave the way you entered.

721
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,940
Your life will be none the worse for your time spent here.

722
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,680
Okay.

723
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,080
Yeah.

724
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,980
You may continue onward.

725
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,560
Through the door behind me.

726
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,860
If you can pass the gates of madness, perhaps the Lord Sheogorath will find a use for you.

727
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,660
Yeah.

728
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,120
And if I go through the door?

729
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Who is to say?

730
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,720
There are always choices to be made.

731
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,080
The realm of madness is no different in that regard.

732
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,240
Your choices are your own.

733
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,120
Enter or do not, but make your decision.

734
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,020
I have other duties to which I must attend.

735
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,520
Do you?

736
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:57,880
You're just sitting here.

737
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,760
Speak with me again when you have made up your mind.

738
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,620
The anticipation is almost too much to bear.

739
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:05,900
Anticipation.

740
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,500
The madness of Pelagius.

741
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,020
Well?

742
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,640
I'm ready.

743
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,460
Have you made up your...

744
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,920
Yeah, I'll do it.

745
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,480
Fine.

746
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
I'm sure my Lord will be most pleased.

747
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,340
Let me in!

748
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
Assuming you ever manage to see him.

749
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,840
Open the door!

750
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
You'll want to pass through the gates of madness.

751
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,060
Oh, and mind the gatekeeper.

752
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,540
He dislikes strangers to the realm.

753
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:25,940
Okay.

754
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,960
Enjoy your stay.

755
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,160
Oh, yeah!

756
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,420
Get up.

757
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,200
Get up.

758
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,520
How do I get up again?

759
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,580
Shoot, I can't remember.

760
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,400
Get up.

761
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,780
I'm...

762
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm glued to the seat.

763
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,170
Uh...

764
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,050
E...

765
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,490
F...

766
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,950
T?

767
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:07,990
No.

768
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,850
Uh...

769
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,290
Space?

770
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:11,870
No.

771
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:11,970
Whoa.

772
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,070
I've tried that.

773
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,350
I can't...

774
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:14,550
Whoa.

775
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,030
I can't get up, you guys.

776
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,270
I can't get up.

777
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,210
What if I go and sit in that chair instead?

778
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,290
Oh, wait.

779
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,230
I...

780
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,130
I tried E.

781
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,190
It didn't work either.

782
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,710
I tried moving!

783
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,930
I have entered the Shivering Isles.

784
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,510
In order to find the Lord of this realm, I must first pass through the gates of madness.

785
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,150
Well, this is fine, actually.

786
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,090
This is so Alice of Wonderland!

787
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,330
I'll take some congealed putrid essence.

788
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,730
I'll take some of this.

789
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,970
Take everything.

790
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,110
Everything's a souvenir.

791
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,570
Everything's a souvenir!

792
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,890
I don't know who's friend or foe here.

793
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,890
So I'm...

794
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,490
I'm...

795
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,290
Being cautious.

796
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,850
Like, well this...

797
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,390
This looks like it'll throw up on me.

798
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,660
Save the cane.

799
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,160
Do save.

800
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,360
He looks...

801
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,680
Oh, unfriendly.

802
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,210
Oh, okay.

803
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,670
Oh!

804
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,950
Give me my stuff back.

805
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,930
I kinda wanna...

806
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,090
Wait.

807
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,130
Can I pick him up?

808
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,310
How do you pick up people again?

809
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,670
Eat.

810
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,370
Oh, here we go.

811
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,150
Yeah.

812
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:14,650
Move.

813
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,050
Move your body.

814
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:16,830
Wait.

815
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:17,890
There we go.

816
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,130
I wanna get a good ol' look at you.

817
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,150
Mr. Welp.

818
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,370
Come on, come on.

819
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:22,950
Don't be...

820
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,190
Don't be so...

821
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,250
It's me.

822
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,610
The Welp.

823
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,890
Yeah.

824
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,170
I'm here in the fringe.

825
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,770
It's been a hard day for him.

826
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,370
He keeled over two times.

827
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,050
Oh!

828
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,270
He might be alive.

829
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,270
Oh wait, this is me.

830
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,270
I'm still holding him.

831
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,010
What's that?

832
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,650
It's a young balewog.

833
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,170
I saw someone say, beware the water.

834
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,350
Well, I touched it.

835
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:06,630
Oops.

836
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,450
On accident.

837
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,750
It's a balewog.

838
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,890
What is this?

839
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,790
Can I breathe it?

840
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,270
Just like you on the floor last stream.

841
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,210
Uh oh.

842
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,690
Hold on.

843
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,610
I think I need to...

844
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,890
Close out of wallpaper engine.

845
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,010
Frog Bird really let himself go.

846
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,110
Don't say that.

847
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,150
I'm still lagging a little bit.

848
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,370
It's cause I think we're in a new area.

849
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,930
I've got more black tar.

850
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,350
Wow.

851
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,650
Is this safe to breathe?

852
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,060
I still think one of these are gonna...

853
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,000
Is gonna throw up like a...

854
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
I got a digestive slime.

855
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,960
I think it's gonna throw up like a person or something, you know?

856
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,160
Yummy spores.

857
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,520
Mm-hmm.

858
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm crawling along.

859
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,060
Which way do we go?

860
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,950
I'm in the fringe!

861
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,710
Wait, are these the aisles?

862
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,370
Veil of suicides.

863
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,310
Okay.

864
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,010
What kind of wallpapers are you rocking?

865
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,070
I have...

866
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,330
I have the new Seiya.

867
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,230
Um...

868
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,890
Seiya.

869
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,510
Blue Archive.

870
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,870
Her driving the car.

871
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,410
And then the other one I have is...

872
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,590
Is...

873
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:47,890
Hina.

874
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,130
Blue Archive.

875
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,470
Okay.

876
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,390
The hill of minecrafting.

877
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,770
This place should be fine though.

878
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,370
It's...

879
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,250
Maybe a village.

880
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,190
With skulls.

881
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,170
And...

882
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,840
Nice.

883
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,100
Where'd the other guy go?

884
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,700
Yeah.

885
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,500
You.

886
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:26,620
You.

887
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,260
I'm not so weak.

888
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,420
Is he climbing the tree?

889
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,480
Oh, no.

890
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,480
Or not.

891
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,440
Or...

892
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,440
Oh my God.

893
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,180
Oh my God.

894
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,040
He's fast.

895
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,260
There's another guy down there.

896
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,800
Didn't even notice.

897
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,480
Stupid.

898
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,480
We gotta be on our toes around here.

899
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,840
A...

900
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,380
A...

901
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,560
A...

902
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,200
Grumite arrow.

903
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,640
Ooh.

904
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,880
Good try.

905
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,540
Thank you.

906
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,400
Thank you.

907
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,620
Ooh.

908
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,660
I'm on my toes.

909
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,740
My tippy toes.

910
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:23,900
Ooh.

911
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,840
The music sounds way too...

912
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,240
Oh my gosh.

913
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,320
This guy has gold.

914
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,620
For what reason?

915
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,900
Why is the music so calming?

916
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,240
This place is not.

917
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,180
Um...

918
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,560
He's looking right at me.

919
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,280
Got Hanako's swimsuit yet?

920
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:53,620
Yes.

921
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,460
I do have her.

922
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:54,820
Fine.

923
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,900
I did get her finally.

924
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,460
Yes.

925
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,650
You got anything good?

926
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,610
Oh, he's got that congealed putrid essence.

927
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,330
Is that...

928
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,090
A thing?

929
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,330
I'm gonna shoot it.

930
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,250
Okay.

931
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,690
I've got eggs!

932
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,510
This is how they're born!

933
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,610
Huh.

934
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,730
No family reunion happening today.

935
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,690
I'll tell you that.

936
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,890
Just don't shoot innocents.

937
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,870
Am I killing innocent people?

938
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,970
I don't think so.

939
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,640
Cook the eggs.

940
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,720
I'll...

941
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,420
I will get a disease.

942
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,540
Did I...

943
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,380
He doesn't have me.

944
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,260
Yeah, I took my arrow.

945
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,700
Think of the protein.

946
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,420
Oh, he's doing his squats!

947
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,940
My marksman increased.

948
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,660
Let's go.

949
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,310
It's...

950
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,130
What was he doing?

951
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,610
Am I...

952
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,390
Do I need to be in here or...

953
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,110
I'm kinda confused.

954
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,590
We're just exploring.

955
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,450
I need to get to the lady that goes...

956
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,970
And I will feel so satisfied.

957
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,280
Holy!

958
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,440
Thought I heard something behind me.

959
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,700
What's her name?

960
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,040
Magus Beater?

961
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,740
Putting some muscle in those legs.

962
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,860
Hey, it's how we get the...

963
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,800
There's a door!

964
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,390
I think this is what I saved, yeah.

965
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:28,950
Let's go.

966
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,620
Zedifan.

967
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,600
Guys!

968
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,140
Is this where I'm supposed to be?

969
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,840
Guys!

970
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,020
Am I in the right spot?

971
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,200
No idea.

972
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,460
What is that?

973
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,060
Oh.

974
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,260
Oh my god.

975
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,140
How did I miss?

976
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,220
Ow!

977
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,000
Three!

978
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,880
Give me my arrows!

979
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,360
Is that a trap?

980
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,760
Maybe this is a dungeon.

981
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,100
You don't need to be here right now.

982
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,240
Dungeons are so scary in this game.

983
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,340
For what reason?

984
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,040
You don't need to be here.

985
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,160
You don't need to be here right now.

986
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,240
Ah!

987
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:01,820
Ah!

988
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,760
Pilot's Ballad!

989
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,940
Welcome to Bad Fuship!

990
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:11,790
What you got?!

991
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,230
Dang!

992
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,470
I'll take that...

993
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,610
Madness Ore?

994
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,910
That sounds exciting.

995
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:18,970
All these...

996
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,330
Daggers are...

997
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,670
They sell for...

998
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,570
Not bad price.

999
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,390
Actually, I don't even know...

1000
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,870
How much money do I have?

1001
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,270
Seventy!

1002
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,830
I'm broke!

1003
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,990
Aw, shoot, wait.

1004
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,750
Okay, I have a lot of space still.

1005
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,200
Oh, wait, I killed it.

1006
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,620
Nice.

1007
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,280
The price of homeowner.

1008
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,680
Shit boy!

1009
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,500
I love my three times damage.

1010
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,860
Might be the best thing I've ever invested.

1011
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,200
What the hell?

1012
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,040
What the hell?

1013
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,860
I was like, he's still breathing.

1014
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,840
It looks like a dog.

1015
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,080
What?

1016
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,820
And his belly is scratched.

1017
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,580
Where's that good boy?

1018
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,160
Where's that good belly bug?

1019
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,760
Oh, ew.

1020
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,450
I was afraid of that being a trap or something.

1021
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,360
Yes!

1022
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,960
He wants belly rubs.

1023
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,320
Yeah!

1024
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,200
Um, um, um, um.

1025
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,060
A spoon!

1026
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,460
Oh, he's got some eggies.

1027
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,060
Damn, it's magical.

1028
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,310
I don't want to start taking everything.

1029
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,510
Oh, wait.

1030
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,310
Is this...

1031
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:09,970
Oh, okay.

1032
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:14,930
Oh!

1033
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,150
I'm still a pro at this.

1034
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,210
It said easy, but it was actually...

1035
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,370
So tricky.

1036
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,750
Sounded like a...

1037
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,190
Sounded like a...

1038
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,930
Like a...

1039
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,710
Like a trap.

1040
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,330
Metal door.

1041
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,910
When in doubt, follow the red green marker.

1042
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:42,810
Yeah!

1043
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,110
I'm having fun exploring a little bit though.

1044
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,870
I...

1045
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,530
Give up.

1046
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,530
I call!

1047
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,930
I was sabotaged!

1048
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,470
What is this?

1049
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:14,510
Oh, just an outlook.

1050
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,950
The urn!

1051
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,810
Why are there potions in the urn?

1052
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,050
I don't need luck.

1053
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,490
I get by on my own.

1054
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,390
Everything.

1055
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,330
I've gotten this far with zero luck stat.

1056
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,590
I don't need it anymore.

1057
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:39,710
Okay.

1058
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,150
We'll come back here.

1059
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,750
I thought it might be the place where I have to fight the guy.

1060
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,110
The...

1061
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,550
The gatekeeper or whatever it is.

1062
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,930
It's a minky.

1063
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:57,890
That's me.

1064
00:48:59,250 --> 00:48:59,690
Minky.

1065
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:06,890
Wow.

1066
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,570
Okay, let's go the other way now.

1067
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,280
Minky.

1068
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,960
See, it feels so, like, calm here.

1069
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,020
Is the water safe?

1070
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,560
You guys are scaring me.

1071
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,660
Is it just if I drink it, I go crazy?

1072
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,060
I'm okay with a little crazy.

1073
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,120
Gardens of flesh and bone.

1074
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,800
Haha.

1075
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,400
167 steps ahead.

1076
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,920
Lucky us.

1077
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,260
I'm gonna become...

1078
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,660
Oh my gosh.

1079
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,320
Can you imagine like a...

1080
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,940
Like a...

1081
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,540
What's the word?

1082
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,980
Like a travel vlogger in Oblivion.

1083
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:12,920
Oh my god, guys.

1084
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:19,320
Let me tell you about this hidden gem in Kyrodil.

1085
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,060
It's called the Gardens of Flesh and Bone.

1086
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,860
Whoa.

1087
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,600
Wait, these are actual homes.

1088
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:27,640
Whoa!

1089
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,960
I feel like I'm in Atlantis.

1090
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,140
Today we're checking out the Eternal Tortured Labyrinth.

1091
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,880
Now, don't let the name fool you.

1092
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,360
It's actually...

1093
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,440
A crazy...

1094
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,700
Awesome place to get photos.

1095
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,520
If you're looking for a cute little spot...

1096
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,100
To just rest and relax for all of eternity...

1097
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,000
Then this place has got you.

1098
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,500
Where am I?

1099
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,100
I'm still in the fringe.

1100
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,160
I'm supposed to go this way.

1101
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,400
Okay.

1102
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,320
Now I'm sold.

1103
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,220
Wait, can I visit these people?

1104
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,480
Are you friends?

1105
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,700
They look like friends, no?

1106
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,360
Wait, hold on.

1107
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,220
Is this like a living town?

1108
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,620
Ugh, I can't see.

1109
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,080
Hello.

1110
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,040
Hello?

1111
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,580
They should have listened to me.

1112
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,100
With these dramatic pauses.

1113
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,260
We'll be swimming in blood soon.

1114
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:54,640
What?

1115
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,240
Yuck.

1116
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,440
Wait, why?

1117
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,580
Let's go watch.

1118
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,300
Oh.

1119
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,920
Just as long as we don't catch any of their diseases.

1120
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,400
Adventurers always get strange diseases.

1121
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,600
Oh, look at the membership.

1122
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,320
Thank you!

1123
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,000
What are you doing?

1124
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,080
It'll be fun watching them get knocked around up there.

1125
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,420
Sorry, I'm lagging a little bit.

1126
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,080
You'll follow.

1127
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,900
Just don't get any blood on me.

1128
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,700
Oh!

1129
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,500
Wait!

1130
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,840
They didn't...

1131
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,160
Okay.

1132
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,120
The wastrel's purse.

1133
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,800
Oh, yeah.

1134
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,840
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,420
Oh.

1136
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,480
I think this place is...

1137
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:46,740
Oh!

1138
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,020
She's awa- She's awake!

1139
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,580
Hello!

1140
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,620
Hello.

1141
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,180
I'm Dredwyn.

1142
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,120
No one was running this place when I got here.

1143
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,620
They left plenty of things behind, though.

1144
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,980
The pocket guide to the empire.

1145
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,840
What do you need?

1146
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh, cute!

1147
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,820
A gatekeeper?

1148
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,480
He protects the gates of madness.

1149
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,400
He'll kill anyone who gets near.

1150
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Oh, she is tired.

1151
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,160
He's about to destroy some adventurers up there now.

1152
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,340
Why do you talk so slow?

1153
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,640
I took over the inn when I got here.

1154
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,720
There wasn't anyone living here.

1155
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,560
Except for Sheldon.

1156
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,860
He says he's mayor.

1157
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,980
Don't believe it.

1158
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,020
Is she drunk?

1159
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,660
See you later.

1160
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,760
She's dead again!

1161
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,680
She's- she's- oh!

1162
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:52,440
The- This is me on the train when I'm trying not to fall asleep.

1163
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,580
Going back to my hotel!

1164
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,660
In Japan!

1165
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,840
I'm like...

1166
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,270
Okay, I think she's good.

1167
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,130
Wait, so there are people in here and they're normal- wow.

1168
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,150
What's the occasion?

1169
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,750
Why are you bothering me with that wagging tongue?

1170
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:19,070
Do you know how long it would waggle after I rip it from your mouse?

1171
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,710
My mouse?

1172
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,310
Don't tempt me.

1173
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:23,750
Squeaker squeaks!

1174
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,730
Wait, come here, come here.

1175
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:29,410
If you think I'm interested in whatever you're selling, you're wrong.

1176
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,350
I'm not.

1177
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,170
Why don't you go play with the gatekeeper?

1178
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,170
Run along now.

1179
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:37,430
The gatekeeper.

1180
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,030
You want to know about my child?

1181
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:39,730
Your child?

1182
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,870
Go see for yourself.

1183
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,870
He guards the gates at the top of the hill.

1184
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,370
Be warned.

1185
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,490
He doesn't play nice.

1186
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:49,990
That's a madness.

1187
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,350
One leads to mania.

1188
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,790
One to dementia.

1189
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,290
Two shades of madness.

1190
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,470
You're not getting in because you're not blessed by Sheogorath.

1191
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,730
You can try to get the keys.

1192
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:05,970
My lord had them sewn into my child's body.

1193
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,030
I wonder if you are a fast pleader.

1194
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,350
Or a slow pleader.

1195
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,150
Oh.

1196
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:13,750
What's the rumors?

1197
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,270
If you see a shambles dying, stand back.

1198
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,950
They'll take you with them.

1199
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,770
What's a shambles?

1200
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,630
How I look forward to our goodbyes.

1201
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,490
What's in your room?

1202
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,730
Oh my god.

1203
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,870
Sharon with the class?

1204
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:31,310
Oh.

1205
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,930
She's got a skull, a scythe.

1206
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,450
Oh my god.

1207
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,030
Some legs.

1208
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,090
You try my patience.

1209
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,390
Out with it.

1210
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,190
No.

1211
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:43,950
No, no, no.

1212
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:45,550
Oh, see.

1213
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,710
This one's nice and clean.

1214
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,830
I love an inn with two rooms.

1215
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,390
I guess you don't get many passengers.

1216
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:52,190
Not passengers.

1217
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:52,850
Pass...

1218
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:53,550
Pass...

1219
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:54,690
Passerbys.

1220
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,710
This is normal.

1221
00:55:59,110 --> 00:55:59,430
Is it?

1222
00:55:59,570 --> 00:55:59,670
Yeah?

1223
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,030
Sheldon!

1224
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:12,490
Oh.

1225
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,290
Oh.

1226
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,070
Oh.

1227
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,830
Who's that?

1228
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:17,770
Handsome fella.

1229
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,730
Love to see it.

1230
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,750
And he's an artiste?

1231
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,730
Okay.

1232
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,450
I don't think Sheldon's here.

1233
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,980
What is that?

1234
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,440
Oh, it's a madness ore.

1235
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,280
You think I'm gonna go crazy?

1236
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,060
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1237
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,060
I'm excited for it.

1238
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,360
I welcome the madness.

1239
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,400
So you guys said beware the water.

1240
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,620
Or I still have one person.

1241
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
I might have gotten one guide.

1242
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,240
But I'm taking it to heart.

1243
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,880
Nanette Dawn.

1244
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,930
I'm crazy!

1245
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,490
Oh, she looks normal.

1246
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,370
Hello.

1247
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,510
I'm Nanette Dawn.

1248
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:09,670
I wasn't sure why I came here until she showed up.

1249
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,090
Now I know.

1250
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,610
I'm going to be a powerful sorceress.

1251
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,230
Just like Romina.

1252
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,230
I can't tell- Do you hear that sound?

1253
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:17,790
Oh.

1254
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:19,490
It's like a host dying.

1255
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:20,050
Oh.

1256
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:27,730
I can't tell if any of these people are abnormal or not, because they act and look all the same as the people in...

1257
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:31,630
in Cryodil, so it doesn't really...

1258
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:34,650
He's the crowning achievement of Romina Varenum.

1259
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,270
She's my teacher.

1260
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,050
The gatekeeper keeps our people who don't belong.

1261
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:39,950
I belong.

1262
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,990
I saw some strangers heading up there earlier.

1263
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,750
If they're still alive, you can see the gatekeeper in action.

1264
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:46,930
It's glorious.

1265
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,390
Wait, I kind of... wait.

1266
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,730
Is it those two guys that left?

1267
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:50,930
Goodbye.

1268
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:51,670
Goodbye.

1269
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,310
Maybe I should have gone and watched them.

1270
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,570
They're probably still around, though.

1271
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,310
The Fringe.

1272
00:57:59,310 --> 00:57:59,510
The Fringe.

1273
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,750
Oh, they went to watch.

1274
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:06,390
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1275
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,630
Because they were like, Don't give blood on me.

1276
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,510
Okay, never mind.

1277
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,050
I thought this would be like up the...

1278
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,230
I thought this was a little...

1279
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:16,850
A little shortcut.

1280
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,630
I'm not... I don't want to break my knees.

1281
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,830
Them eyes be twitching mint.

1282
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,630
No, she seems so... so kind.

1283
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,430
Okay, so they went...

1284
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,470
Yeah, this way.

1285
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,870
Okay, up the hill.

1286
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,870
Oh my gosh, we're gonna face the madness.

1287
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,570
The gatekeeper.

1288
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,270
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1289
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,050
Oh, I see, I see.

1290
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:45,610
Okay, come on.

1291
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,770
I'm gonna save real quick.

1292
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,590
Oh, that was an auto save, but whatever.

1293
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,090
You there.

1294
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,830
Stay away from the gatekeeper.

1295
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,250
Let us handle this.

1296
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,370
Wait, can I...

1297
00:58:59,370 --> 00:58:59,450
Oh.

1298
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,820
I'm fellas Sarandas.

1299
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,260
Don't breathe on me.

1300
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:07,800
Okay.

1301
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,280
Actually, I want to watch.

1302
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:09,740
Bye.

1303
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,660
Oh, yeah.

1304
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah.

1305
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,540
They should have listened to me.

1306
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,540
Woo, woo, woo.

1307
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,200
Wow, that guy's kind of big.

1308
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,660
You think I should join in?

1309
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:33,770
You think they'll...

1310
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,010
A really slow fight.

1311
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,650
No?

1312
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,790
Let them handle it?

1313
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,280
I think they're doing a good job.

1314
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,540
The guy's barely moving.

1315
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,320
Wait, they're swinging?

1316
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:01,980
They miss?

1317
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,360
He doesn't even...

1318
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,640
He's not even attacking them.

1319
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,320
Um...

1320
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,020
He's stunlocked.

1321
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,240
Wait, they might actually win?

1322
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,640
He's a gentle giant.

1323
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,360
They got this?

1324
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,600
Uh...

1325
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,720
Hello.

1326
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,540
Oh, Sheldon!

1327
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,560
I went in your house.

1328
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,140
Hello, I'm Sheldon.

1329
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,060
I've been here the longest.

1330
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,820
That's why I'm mayor of Passwall.

1331
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,560
That, and because I'm the best at being in charge.

1332
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,180
I see.

1333
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,700
Welcome to my town.

1334
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:56,700
Thank you.

1335
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,320
Uh, the gatekeeper.

1336
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,400
He guards the gates of madness.

1337
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,580
See for yourself.

1338
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,780
He's about to destroy a party of adventurers.

1339
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,220
I think they are getting...

1340
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,940
He's getting his ass handed to him.

1341
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:08,720
Hi, mate.

1342
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,740
Let me show you a cupcake.

1343
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,200
Thank you so much for the super job.

1344
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,740
Thank you.

1345
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,520
Goodbye.

1346
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,280
Goodbye.

1347
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,780
Guys, I think I should help them.

1348
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:20,500
I don't know.

1349
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,500
If this part is bugged, maybe I should do something.

1350
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:36,980
What?

1351
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,040
Oh.

1352
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,580
I thought he was gonna do something.

1353
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,210
Wait!

1354
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:46,910
Oh.

1355
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,400
I don't think it's cause he's cornered, guys.

1356
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,420
I think they're just, uh...

1357
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,460
Can I walk past?

1358
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,740
I wonder which one gives me dementia.

1359
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,580
Ah, I need a key.

1360
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,760
Haskell mentioned that the gates were guarded by the gatekeeper.

1361
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,760
He must have the keys.

1362
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:22,110
What if I...

1363
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:22,550
Okay, hold on.

1364
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,100
Pickpocket!

1365
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,640
You can't pickpocket the guy.

1366
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,420
Hahaha.

1367
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,260
Hahaha.

1368
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:42,520
Hahaha.

1369
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:42,860
It did...

1370
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,400
She did mention that it was like buried into his flesh.

1371
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,200
Um...

1372
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,080
Hmm...

1373
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,120
But you know...

1374
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,200
It was worth a shot.

1375
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,360
I can get my grubby little hands in anywhere.

1376
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:08,510
Uh oh.

1377
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,810
Do your worst.

1378
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,230
Do anything.

1379
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,310
Hahaha.

1380
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,110
Show me what you've got.

1381
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:25,130
Show me what you've got.

1382
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,870
Wow, we can get real up and close though.

1383
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,290
Wow!

1384
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,510
Wow!

1385
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:34,710
Wow!

1386
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,390
What's the matter?

1387
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:38,590
I'm getting tired?

1388
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,550
Reload game.

1389
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,490
Yes.

1390
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:49,170
I think he's glitched a little bit.

1391
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:49,810
Hahaha.

1392
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,360
You there!

1393
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,080
Stay away from the gatekeeper!

1394
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,020
Let us handle this!

1395
01:03:59,020 --> 01:03:59,360
Oh!

1396
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,060
He's doing it!

1397
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,300
He's doing it!

1398
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,580
He's doing it!

1399
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,020
Oh!

1400
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:06,780
He's doing it!

1401
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,440
He's doing it!

1402
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,760
Uh oh.

1403
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,520
No gatekeeper, please!

1404
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,040
Oh!

1405
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:16,860
He's doing it!

1406
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:17,620
He's...

1407
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,480
He's doing it!

1408
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,000
He's doing it!

1409
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,020
Hahaha.

1410
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,400
Oh, they're bleeding all over the place!

1411
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,840
The formidable gatekeeper has destroyed a party of adventurers.

1412
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,180
I had to talk to the residents of Paswa before trying to deal with this creature.

1413
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,440
Ah, you almost made it!

1414
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,320
Look at that crazy armor!

1415
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,700
Where'd you get the... the foot?

1416
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,140
Alright, here we go.

1417
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,560
Who's J-Red?

1418
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,660
Hmm...

1419
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,320
One to the lands of Mania and one to Dementia.

1420
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,180
The gatekeeper makes sure no one gets in who isn't supposed to.

1421
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:21,900
Breathe on him.

1422
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,920
It's a nice enough place.

1423
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,500
Less dirty than others.

1424
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,520
I feel like I belong.

1425
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,500
That old man in the room made out of butterflies.

1426
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,420
He said to wait here.

1427
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1428
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,420
The Mariana in the broom... yeah, we saw him too.

1429
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:41,740
Rumors.

1430
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,280
I don't like you, and don't want to talk to you.

1431
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,620
Wait if I... okay, hold on, hold on.

1432
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,020
This better be good.

1433
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,860
We're time... time to...

1434
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:50,820
uh... maybe...

1435
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,640
get some info out of our little friend here.

1436
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,540
No, you do me too much honor.

1437
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,620
Uh...

1438
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:04,240
Uh-oh.

1439
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:05,980
Remarkable.

1440
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:06,740
Bah.

1441
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,620
You can't scare me.

1442
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:08,960
Ooh!

1443
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,000
Okay, that wasn't great.

1444
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,540
Really now.

1445
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:13,620
You're such...

1446
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,240
Oh, please.

1447
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,300
Bah.

1448
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,600
Remarkable.

1449
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,360
Okay, okay.

1450
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:20,740
Uh...

1451
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,160
Nice.

1452
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:22,620
Not funny.

1453
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:23,880
Not even... goodness.

1454
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,220
What can I say?

1455
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,340
You can't scare me.

1456
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:26,760
Really.

1457
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:27,540
46.

1458
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:28,280
Okay.

1459
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,100
Nice, nice.

1460
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,060
Have you watched the Oblivion gamer poops?

1461
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:33,940
I haven't.

1462
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:34,840
Smile.

1463
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,420
Angry.

1464
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:35,980
Smile.

1465
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:37,560
Smile.

1466
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,280
Sweet.

1467
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,280
Sister.

1468
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,000
Sadistic.

1469
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:41,920
Oh...

1470
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,900
This is not good.

1471
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,160
What a great story.

1472
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,560
You're revolting.

1473
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,240
Goodness.

1474
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,860
You're wasting your breath.

1475
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,220
54!

1476
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:49,640
54!

1477
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,260
Wait a second.

1478
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,160
Do I have my thing out?

1479
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,240
No.

1480
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:55,980
Wait, hold on.

1481
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,360
Don't leave.

1482
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,860
Hello, I'm Sheldon.

1483
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,820
I've been here the longest.

1484
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:00,380
Oopsie.

1485
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,160
That's why I'm mayor of...

1486
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:02,460
Welcome!

1487
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,580
Okay, uh...

1488
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,880
Gatekeeper.

1489
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,420
He guards the gates of madness.

1490
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,260
Don't get too close to him.

1491
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,180
He'll kill you.

1492
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,120
And it will leave a mess in my town.

1493
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:10,480
Yeah.

1494
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,020
J Red Ice Veins wants to kill the gatekeeper.

1495
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,880
Okay, so we gotta go find J Red Ice Veins.

1496
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,160
J Red.

1497
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,220
Alright, thank you.

1498
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:19,780
Take care.

1499
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:20,400
Bye!

1500
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,300
J Red.

1501
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,660
J Red Ice Veins.

1502
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,640
What a name.

1503
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,660
What a guy.

1504
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,400
Over there?

1505
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,180
I guess?

1506
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,440
Is that our J Red friend?

1507
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,420
You guys, I'm afraid.

1508
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,220
Someone said to be aware of the water, but I gotta swim.

1509
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,400
Oh, oh shoot.

1510
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:46,940
My legs!

1511
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:47,520
Ouch!

1512
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,960
My acrobatics increased somehow.

1513
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,740
Okay, I'm swimming.

1514
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,060
There was nothing to be afraid of.

1515
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,490
Wait, can I level up?

1516
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,190
J Red Ice Veins.

1517
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,930
I'm J Red Ice Veins.

1518
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:14,370
Do you ever wonder why things look better without their skin on?

1519
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:19,950
For instance, you can only really see the bones when you take them out.

1520
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,590
You can hear them better that way, too.

1521
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:31,200
I have no bones.

1522
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,560
Does that make me more attractive?

1523
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,900
Oh my gosh.

1524
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,230
Wait, was he saying that no bones is like...

1525
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,300
Like...

1526
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,180
You know?

1527
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,440
Is he flirting with me?

1528
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:51,360
Oh, he's nodding!

1529
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,380
I want him dead.

1530
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,600
I need him dead.

1531
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:55,440
I need him dead.

1532
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,880
His bones are calling to me.

1533
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,340
Yeah.

1534
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,500
Rumor has it you want him dead, too.

1535
01:08:59,680 --> 01:08:59,960
Yeah.

1536
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,440
If you're any good with a lockpick, we can help each other out.

1537
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,080
We can get into the gardens of flesh and bone.

1538
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,360
Sorry, I just took a sippy of my tea.

1539
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:11,660
Ah!

1540
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,380
Me with the lockpick?

1541
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,340
You have asked the right madam.

1542
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,800
They say the gatekeeper's magical.

1543
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,560
I don't believe in magic.

1544
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,760
But I do believe in bones.

1545
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,260
And the best way to kill something is with the bones of its own.

1546
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:28,060
Hell yeah.

1547
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,740
I can see the bones of a dead gatekeeper in the courtyard of the gardens.

1548
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,640
The door's locked, though.

1549
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,680
You'll pick that lock, and I'll collect the bones.

1550
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,040
Then I'll make some arrows, and we'll kill the gatekeeper.

1551
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:41,140
Sound good?

1552
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:41,780
Yeah!

1553
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,220
Lead on!

1554
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,220
Here, take this lockpick.

1555
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:45,740
Careful!

1556
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,160
It's the only one I've got.

1557
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,020
You open the door, I'll kill things.

1558
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,300
Let's go!

1559
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:51,880
Let's go!

1560
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,300
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited right now.

1561
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,180
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

1562
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,220
Wait, where'd he go?

1563
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:02,600
Okay.

1564
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:03,740
Hold on, mister.

1565
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,040
Oh, it auto-saved.

1566
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,380
We're good.

1567
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:06,820
Okay, just kidding.

1568
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,150
This is so exciting.

1569
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,550
J-Red, my man!

1570
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:18,510
I try...

1571
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:18,990
Oh, okay.

1572
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:20,310
Hard...

1573
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:21,170
Hard left.

1574
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,590
That's fine.

1575
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,330
You know the way.

1576
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:27,610
Okay, zigzagging.

1577
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,230
Let's go.

1578
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,610
Okay, that's fine.

1579
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,910
Garden of flesh and bones?

1580
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,010
I...

1581
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,250
Oh, I guess we didn't...

1582
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,690
I saw that it was on the map, but we didn't go up here.

1583
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:43,470
Okay.

1584
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,690
Hurry, pick that lock open.

1585
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,950
I can hear them in there.

1586
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,430
Okay.

1587
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,710
Oh, it's very easy.

1588
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:49,690
What?

1589
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:51,950
I was expecting...

1590
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,090
Something more difficult.

1591
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:55,770
Uh-oh.

1592
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,170
J-Red, don't die on me.

1593
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,350
Oh, I don't think he's coming for you.

1594
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,160
Good job.

1595
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:19,380
From these gatekeeper bones, I can make some arrows.

1596
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,240
Yes.

1597
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,640
When will these bone arrows be ready?

1598
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,980
Find me in a few hours.

1599
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,040
We'll kill the gatekeeper.

1600
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:28,580
Okay.

1601
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,820
Bone arrows.

1602
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,340
The arrows aren't ready yet.

1603
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,500
Come back later.

1604
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,100
Okay.

1605
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:35,860
Yeah, yeah.

1606
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:36,640
See ya.

1607
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,620
See ya.

1608
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,180
Well...

1609
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,040
Does that mean I can't get any bones for myself?

1610
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:50,910
Leave me alone.

1611
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:54,940
Ouch.

1612
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,020
Ouch.

1613
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,390
Yeah, leave me alone.

1614
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,430
Activate?

1615
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:02,930
Wait, wait.

1616
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:03,650
Uh...

1617
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,830
I don't think I meant to press that.

1618
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:08,110
Wait.

1619
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,090
Wait, wait.

1620
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:09,930
What do you mean activate?

1621
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,350
There's another guy.

1622
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,650
I hear the music.

1623
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:20,250
Oh, never mind.

1624
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,410
But what if?

1625
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:24,910
What if we save?

1626
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:26,110
Do save.

1627
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:26,930
And then activate.

1628
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,410
Activate, activate, activate.

1629
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,490
Okay, nothing happens.

1630
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:33,710
Just kidding.

1631
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,450
Needs a key.

1632
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,150
Wow.

1633
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,490
I think J Red is my fave Oblivion NPC.

1634
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,230
He's pretty cool.

1635
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:49,930
I can't tell if I'm in active battle or if it's just the music being...

1636
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:51,970
Exciting.

1637
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:54,550
Okay.

1638
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,590
I like these things, but I still am afraid of them.

1639
01:12:58,730 --> 01:12:59,030
Yeah.

1640
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,130
Any more skellies?

1641
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,160
None.

1642
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,880
We can go sleep.

1643
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,200
And we'll level up.

1644
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,160
And then that will be a few hours.

1645
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,380
Those are hungers.

1646
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,060
Well, why don't they eat?

1647
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,090
What will they be after?

1648
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,150
Once they have a hearty meal.

1649
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,190
The fullers.

1650
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,570
Am I going the right way?

1651
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,140
This way.

1652
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,600
Hungers are terrifying.

1653
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:42,740
Hungers are terrifying.

1654
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,220
Wait, you can actually fight them?

1655
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,660
I don't like that.

1656
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:46,820
Greetings.

1657
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:47,480
Hello.

1658
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,440
I like your town.

1659
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,620
I would stay here.

1660
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,400
They're on a diet.

1661
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,460
I'm going...

1662
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,670
I'm going to partake in your bed.

1663
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,140
Sleep for...

1664
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:12,600
What?

1665
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,420
Like three hours?

1666
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,580
That's a couple of hours.

1667
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:14,780
Nope.

1668
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,520
A nice little nap.

1669
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,320
I'm level nine!

1670
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,600
Oh!

1671
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,180
Thank

1672
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,140
you so much for the bread!

1673
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:35,930
Everybody, hello!

1674
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,680
Let's see.

1675
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,880
I just leveled up.

1676
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,580
Hold on.

1677
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,560
Show the details.

1678
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,420
How fast you can move.

1679
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,020
That's always good.

1680
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:47,440
Right back.

1681
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,340
Thanks for the fine gifter!

1682
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,540
How goes the Elder Scrolls?

1683
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:52,880
Yeah?

1684
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:53,760
They're old.

1685
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,160
Take up.

1686
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:55,780
Thanks for the gifter!

1687
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:56,540
Rock my Robin.

1688
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,520
Thank you for the fine gifter!

1689
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,780
Thank you so much for the gifter!

1690
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,640
I forgot she made E.T.

1691
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,780
No, it's E.T.

1692
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:04,180
Na!

1693
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,340
I'm E.T.

1694
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:08,680
Na!

1695
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,300
Look at her.

1696
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,420
You can't tell because I have my robe on.

1697
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,280
But...

1698
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,080
She's got...

1699
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,340
A nice...

1700
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:26,860
Like...

1701
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,780
Goldilocks.

1702
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,320
Yeah...

1703
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,420
Scarily accurate E.T.

1704
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,340
The key takes to the five gifs!

1705
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:39,060
Let's see.

1706
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:41,840
Um...

1707
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,400
Max agility.

1708
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,380
I think maybe we could do more strength...

1709
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,080
So that we can carry more stuff.

1710
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:55,700
You know?

1711
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,760
Let's do like...

1712
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,320
Three.

1713
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:02,840
Endurance...

1714
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,160
Is my health.

1715
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,880
I don't have a very good personality.

1716
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,620
I like being fast, also.

1717
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,460
Oh, I forgot I can only pick three things...

1718
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,880
And then I have to stick to them.

1719
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,420
I think maybe like this.

1720
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:25,940
Fast!

1721
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:26,800
Fast!

1722
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:27,160
Fast!

1723
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:27,700
Fast!

1724
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:28,120
Fast!

1725
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,740
We'll make it even.

1726
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,540
Look at that.

1727
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,080
Look how even that is.

1728
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,580
Four, four, four.

1729
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,260
All spooky.

1730
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,220
Yes.

1731
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,160
Do you have bulbous fingers, E.T.

1732
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,840
Not asking for a friend?

1733
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:47,500
Why?

1734
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:56,930
This should be fun.

1735
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,750
Okay.

1736
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:01,370
Good morning...

1737
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,370
World.

1738
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,410
Oh!

1739
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,010
Wait, who are you?

1740
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,690
I don't mind talking down to your level.

1741
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:09,670
Oh, wait.

1742
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:10,010
Hi.

1743
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:10,730
Hello.

1744
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:12,270
Wow.

1745
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,250
This place is packed.

1746
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:19,470
Yeah.

1747
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,440
A gnar...

1748
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,320
Wait, what's this?

1749
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,740
Rot scale.

1750
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,380
Oh.

1751
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,000
Today was like...

1752
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,720
Oh my gosh.

1753
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:36,980
I just decided recently that I won't eat rot scale anymore.

1754
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,660
I guess my diet here would be corn.

1755
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,280
Are they all drinking at the same time?

1756
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:48,840
No.

1757
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,080
One, two, three.

1758
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:51,460
Oh.

1759
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:57,050
That's not what I...

1760
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:57,510
Okay.

1761
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:58,250
What?

1762
01:17:58,710 --> 01:17:59,030
What?

1763
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,230
Hello.

1764
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,290
They all got their own little lives.

1765
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,610
It's actually so sweet.

1766
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:13,630
It's so hard to concentrate with all that noise.

1767
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:16,210
What noise?

1768
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,810
Hello?

1769
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,370
You'll need to speak up.

1770
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,450
Hello?

1771
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,590
It's just down the road from Passwall.

1772
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:26,370
It's where Wilmina created the gatekeeper.

1773
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:27,410
Oh.

1774
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,870
The gardens of flesh involved.

1775
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,210
Oh, the voices in her head.

1776
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:34,070
Really?

1777
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:36,410
A gnarle are strange creatures.

1778
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:39,090
Hit them with a fireball and they get stronger.

1779
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,410
But they hate other elements even more.

1780
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:41,890
Oh.

1781
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,590
Passwall.

1782
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,850
I don't know who built it.

1783
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:47,090
It was here before any of us arrived.

1784
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:50,070
It looks like other people lived here before.

1785
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:55,590
Dreadwind's been selling what they left behind, so if you need something, talk to her.

1786
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,170
She's in the wastrel's purse.

1787
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,270
Wastrel's purse, I see.

1788
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,310
Doesn't that noise bother anyone else?

1789
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:05,650
Ma'am?

1790
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:08,050
Do you know how to blink?

1791
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,550
Yes, what is it?

1792
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:09,770
Oh.

1793
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,190
Apparently she does.

1794
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:18,150
Let's go back to this guy's house.

1795
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,210
The arrows, the arrows!

1796
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,050
They must be finished.

1797
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,350
Or maybe he's not here.

1798
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:30,210
Oh.

1799
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:30,510
Oh.

1800
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:32,650
We should go hunting.

1801
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:33,350
Soon.

1802
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:34,490
Wait.

1803
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:35,470
Oh, and arrows?

1804
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:36,630
The arrows are ready.

1805
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,030
Here are some for you.

1806
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,130
And I'll keep some.

1807
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:39,650
Let's go?

1808
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,130
Let's go kill the gatekeeper.

1809
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,750
We might die.

1810
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,550
But there's worse things.

1811
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:45,750
True.

1812
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,010
20 gatekeeper...

1813
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:49,430
Okay.

1814
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,330
Follow me.

1815
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,230
Let's go!

1816
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:52,270
Hell yeah!

1817
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:57,450
Let me equip them.

1818
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:01,030
Gatekeeper bone arrow.

1819
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:01,770
Wah!

1820
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,230
This is fancy.

1821
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:07,690
Wait.

1822
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,130
This is nice.

1823
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,570
Hopefully 20 is enough.

1824
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,490
20.

1825
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,310
I can get him in half.

1826
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:23,670
Wait.

1827
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:24,170
Where am I?

1828
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:25,870
What do I get out?

1829
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:26,150
Oh.

1830
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:26,810
Wait.

1831
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,230
What's this?

1832
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,390
A little vase.

1833
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,520
Here we go!

1834
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,860
Are you off to watch us kill the gatekeeper?

1835
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,190
This is where we save.

1836
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:58,050
Are you ready?

1837
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,050
J Red?

1838
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,650
I wanna loot those guys too.

1839
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:07,750
Alright.

1840
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:09,610
We need to get through the gates of madness.

1841
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:11,730
Let's go kill the gatekeeper.

1842
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,830
Kill the gatekeeper!

1843
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:14,670
Let's go!

1844
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:15,250
Yeah!

1845
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,810
Kill the gatekeeper!

1846
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:19,450
Wait.

1847
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,010
I can get three times damage on him?

1848
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:22,010
No I can't.

1849
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,610
Maybe?

1850
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,410
Yes I did.

1851
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,010
Let's go.

1852
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:29,970
Okay.

1853
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:31,630
Kill the gatekeeper!

1854
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:32,490
J Red.

1855
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:32,990
J Red.

1856
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,090
It's time to kill the gatekeeper.

1857
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,130
J Red.

1858
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:36,150
J Red.

1859
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:37,690
It's time to kill the gatekeeper.

1860
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:38,910
J Red.

1861
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,050
J Red.

1862
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:40,990
It's time to kill the gatekeeper.

1863
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:41,550
J Red.

1864
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:42,270
J Red.

1865
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:42,290
J Red.

1866
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:43,150
It's time to kill the gatekeeper.

1867
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:43,610
J Red.

1868
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:43,630
J Red.

1869
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:44,130
J Red.

1870
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,130
It's time to kill the gatekeeper.

1871
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:51,870
Why can't I run?

1872
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,470
There we go.

1873
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,590
Oh, just one more!

1874
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,330
How many did I use?

1875
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,130
Ow!

1876
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:04,690
Let's go.

1877
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:06,950
We did it!

1878
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,090
We need to get through the gates of madness.

1879
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:09,490
Oh.

1880
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,210
Let's go kill the gatekeeper.

1881
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,150
He's a little slow.

1882
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:15,870
Let's go!

1883
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,870
The gatekeeper is dead.

1884
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:23,670
I shall retrieve the keys to the gates of madness from the gatekeeper's corpse.

1885
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:25,550
The gatekeeper is slain.

1886
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:26,690
Congratulations.

1887
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:30,970
The honor of taking the keys from his corpse is yours.

1888
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,770
Aw, Jared!

1889
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:34,350
See you later.

1890
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,010
Yeah.

1891
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,470
Whoa!

1892
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:39,650
Look at his face.

1893
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,970
Where... where are the keys?

1894
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,050
Uh...

1895
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:48,150
Taking it all, baby.

1896
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:52,570
I love Jared.

1897
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:54,930
Oh!

1898
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,230
This stuff is...

1899
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:58,090
Pretty penny.

1900
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,250
She did, in fact, use less than half.

1901
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,330
Only eight shots.

1902
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,430
Enough to kill any gatekeeper that moves.

1903
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,270
We'll come back for all...

1904
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:07,450
Wait!

1905
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,210
Can I sell this to that lady?

1906
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:09,970
Oh.

1907
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,650
I have both the keys to mania and the keys to dementia.

1908
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,630
I can get through either... or I can go through either doors...

1909
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,290
Of the gates of madness.

1910
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:22,530
I can hear the bones talking.

1911
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:23,550
Oh my god!

1912
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,210
So, you've managed to kill the gatekeeper.

1913
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,970
Where did he come from?

1914
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,330
Pity.

1915
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,290
Well, you'll now be able to enter the realm proper.

1916
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:33,030
You'll notice there are two doors.

1917
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:33,610
Yes.

1918
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:35,830
One leads to the lands of mania.

1919
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:36,110
Yeah.

1920
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:37,150
The other to dementia.

1921
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:37,630
Yeah.

1922
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:38,910
Enter through either one.

1923
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,250
Yeah.

1924
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,630
The lands are quite distinct, but both are Shayagorath's domain.

1925
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:43,750
So I can...

1926
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,870
You'll want to seek out Lord Shayagorath.

1927
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,050
I believe he has plans for you.

1928
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,110
Try not to disappoint him.

1929
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:50,610
Okay.

1930
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,110
Which one should I go in, you guys?

1931
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:56,630
Explore both?

1932
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,110
So I guess we'll go to both.

1933
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,870
Mania.

1934
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:03,170
The lands of mania are bright, vibrant, and full of color.

1935
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:06,290
You'll find its inhabitants reflect the land itself.

1936
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:12,210
If you wish to meet the residents of mania, you'll find them in the settlements of Hale and High Cross.

1937
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,890
Take care though.

1938
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:15,510
Mania sounds pretty.

1939
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:19,650
If citizens and creatures of mania are colorful, they can often be quite deadly.

1940
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:20,290
Okay.

1941
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:22,110
I'm sure you can handle it though.

1942
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,510
And then dementia.

1943
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:25,630
This is...

1944
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:29,370
Why dementia?

1945
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:30,290
That's so sad.

1946
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:33,810
The lands of dementia reflect the darker side of its residents.

1947
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:38,890
It is easy to get lost among the tangle of roots growing out of the ground.

1948
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:44,750
If you wish to meet dementia's citizens, seek them out in Deepwallow or Felmore.

1949
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:48,890
I'm sure they'll welcome one such as you with open arms.

1950
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,810
Oh, what do you mean by that?

1951
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:55,710
Enlightening as always.

1952
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:56,150
Oh, dang it.

1953
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,290
I didn't realize he'd disappear.

1954
01:24:58,450 --> 01:24:59,730
Wait, I can keep talking to him.

1955
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:00,230
Just kidding.

1956
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:01,890
Oh, sorry.

1957
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,190
I didn't ask him about everything.

1958
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:03,890
Hold on.

1959
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:05,070
I want to make sure...

1960
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:07,410
I want to see if we can sell this stuff to the lady at the inn.

1961
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:12,090
Cause if we can, I'll take it all and then just sell it right now, you know?

1962
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:17,890
Take all the money she's got.

1963
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,910
Does money mean anything here?

1964
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:20,290
Ouch.

1965
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:28,230
Why is this always shaking?

1966
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:29,850
Excuse me.

1967
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,070
I must have nodded off there.

1968
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:35,350
Oh!

1969
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:38,490
We can.

1970
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,300
We can.

1971
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:44,520
We can.

1972
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,280
She just doesn't...

1973
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:45,700
Yeah.

1974
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:47,920
Okay.

1975
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:48,400
Hold on.

1976
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:49,980
So?

1977
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,580
So?

1978
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,580
You're full of it.

1979
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,920
You're full of it.

1980
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:03,300
That's a bit excessive.

1981
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,200
No more.

1982
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,380
That's pretty good.

1983
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,080
Okay.

1984
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:06,400
Okay.

1985
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:06,920
That was...

1986
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,160
That was...

1987
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,680
I think that was a perfect match, actually.

1988
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,480
Oh.

1989
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:11,480
Not great.

1990
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:13,100
That's a bit excessive.

1991
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:13,920
Not great.

1992
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:14,360
Yeah.

1993
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:15,580
I get it.

1994
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,360
Blah, blah.

1995
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:16,800
Yes.

1996
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:17,280
Yes.

1997
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,160
What have you say?

1998
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,560
We did go up technically, I think.

1999
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,240
You're a big fat liar.

2000
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,240
Was that supposed...

2001
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:26,660
Don't.

2002
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,280
A phony.

2003
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:27,880
Not bad.

2004
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,120
Not bad at all.

2005
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,640
Not bad at all.

2006
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:30,020
Oh nay.

2007
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,520
It was that supposed to be a...

2008
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,160
No more.

2009
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:35,660
Yeah.

2010
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,160
Okay.

2011
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:36,920
I get it.

2012
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:37,800
62.

2013
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:40,960
Oh, that's all we can do.

2014
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,520
See you later.

2015
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:43,460
Ah!

2016
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,280
And I had my...

2017
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,040
I had my thing in.

2018
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:45,500
Wait.

2019
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:49,840
So...

2020
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,420
Our disposition is at 72.

2021
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,140
This is good.

2022
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,860
I'm so tired.

2023
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,320
Let's go.

2024
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,580
Maybe we can...

2025
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,140
Maybe...

2026
01:26:59,140 --> 01:26:59,900
She'll be so sleepy.

2027
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,160
We can add an extra zero.

2028
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,560
Alright.

2029
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,120
Let's...

2030
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,500
Go grab all this stuff.

2031
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,720
Because we're definitely gonna be over encumbered.

2032
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,880
And then we'll go sell it.

2033
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,620
And get hot...

2034
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,780
High dollar dollar.

2035
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,040
Let's take the most expensive stuff.

2036
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:27,940
Actually.

2037
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:28,880
Whoa!

2038
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,400
He's a cheetah man!

2039
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:33,540
Wait.

2040
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:33,860
Oh.

2041
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:38,970
Wow.

2042
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:53,600
Okay.

2043
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,680
I'm over encumbered.

2044
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,140
I don't know if you guys can tell.

2045
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,000
What's this little tail?

2046
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,140
If I'm already over encumbered, what's a little bit more, right?

2047
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,940
Beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2048
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,220
Someone pointed out she only has 300 gold.

2049
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,020
Yeah, but...

2050
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,280
Um...

2051
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:28,860
We'll try.

2052
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,320
What if she's hiding some in her pockets?

2053
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,960
I can't even imagine.

2054
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:45,480
I'm like walking away like an old man.

2055
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,240
Everything's stacked on my back.

2056
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,820
And I'm like...

2057
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:49,520
I'll be back.

2058
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:52,980
Don't mind me.

2059
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,300
Wait, but the guy wanted the gatekeeper dead.

2060
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,380
Does he not want to go inside...

2061
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,300
Dementia or...

2062
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,460
Mayhem with me?

2063
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,740
Death Stranding mode.

2064
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,020
Truly, this is a stranding game.

2065
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:12,570
I have the keys.

2066
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,990
Yeah, but I can unlock it for him if he asks.

2067
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,010
He just likes bones.

2068
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,730
I can't even jump.

2069
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:23,370
That's crazy.

2070
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,890
This is weight training.

2071
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,510
When everything comes off, I'm gonna be...

2072
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:32,490
Rock Lee.

2073
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,400
I kinda like her.

2074
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,140
He is...

2075
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,240
So innocent about the thing he loves.

2076
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,380
Bones, you know?

2077
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,500
Okay, here we go.

2078
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:51,840
Who are ya?

2079
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:52,820
Who are ya?

2080
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:53,420
Ma'am?

2081
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,440
Wake up.

2082
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,660
Oh, hello there.

2083
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,980
I'm here to barter.

2084
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,220
I've got many items.

2085
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,740
Such as the steel hammer.

2086
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:06,740
Wait.

2087
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,260
No.

2088
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,140
Haggle.

2089
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:08,980
There we go.

2090
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,760
What if like this?

2091
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:13,400
60%.

2092
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,200
She took it.

2093
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:20,840
Nice.

2094
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,320
Steel shield.

2095
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:27,720
Nice.

2096
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,340
We're getting money.

2097
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:31,740
Maybe I can go up a little.

2098
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:35,500
Maybe 65.

2099
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:40,770
Offer refused.

2100
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:41,430
Dang it.

2101
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:41,970
Okay.

2102
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:42,990
62.

2103
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,240
No!

2104
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,280
Okay.

2105
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:49,900
Back to 60.

2106
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,020
Vivicore!

2107
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,260
Thank you so much for the farm gift and thank you.

2108
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,340
This cure us.

2109
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:05,360
Oh.

2110
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,910
Let's go.

2111
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,940
I might be a genius.

2112
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,720
I might be a genius.

2113
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,220
I might be a genius, baby!

2114
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:31,600
I think that was everything, though.

2115
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,840
I think that was everything.

2116
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,580
Look how much money we made back.

2117
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,200
See you.

2118
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:42,940
See ya!

2119
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,760
That was way more than 300.

2120
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:01,780
Yeah!

2121
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:05,200
I think it's the max that they spend at one time.

2122
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,580
So all I had to do was split it up.

2123
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,820
Oh, oh.

2124
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:11,180
Oh...

2125
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:11,760
Oh...

2126
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,060
Oh...

2127
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:12,480
Oh...

2128
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:12,900
Oh...

2129
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,360
Oh...

2130
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,580
I thought he...

2131
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,060
I thought he was break dancing.

2132
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,420
Oh...

2133
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:30,300
Oh...

2134
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:30,380
Oh...

2135
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:30,600
Oh...

2136
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:30,660
Oh...

2137
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:30,680
Oh...

2138
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:30,800
Yes?

2139
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:34,040
I wonder if I should sell the rest of the stuff.

2140
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:40,800
Will I be over-encumbered if I take all of this?

2141
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,630
Oh, I'm not!

2142
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,500
Even the skellies have gold.

2143
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,550
I need more skellies for me to...

2144
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:09,070
Did I search this guy?

2145
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:09,450
Yeah.

2146
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:10,630
This guy?

2147
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:11,990
No.

2148
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,630
Gold?

2149
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:16,810
A brass pearl ring!

2150
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,540
Okay.

2151
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,080
Let's go sell this stuff.

2152
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,440
There's also shields.

2153
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,520
Were they on the ground?

2154
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,680
Did I miss them?

2155
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:33,700
I did!

2156
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,620
Thank you!

2157
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,440
I did.

2158
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:38,020
I did.

2159
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:39,520
Okay.

2160
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,160
That one sword was enough to do me in.

2161
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:08,070
Do I have any feather spells?

2162
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:08,700
I'll be honest...

2163
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,390
I don't know how to play this game.

2164
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:12,450
I don't...

2165
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:14,730
I think I'm just, like, anti-magic.

2166
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:16,480
Because even when I play...

2167
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,230
What?

2168
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:18,810
Even when I play...

2169
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:20,750
Like, I've been playing a lot of Fantasy Life, too.

2170
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:25,290
And even in that game, I choose sword over everything else.

2171
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:26,090
I don't know.

2172
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,770
I think I just hate spells.

2173
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,750
I just want to use my fists.

2174
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:36,150
What if I did 61%?

2175
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:38,030
Ma'am, we're friends, no?

2176
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:47,550
Nice.

2177
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:04,430
We have...

2178
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:06,790
Guys, we started with 50 gold.

2179
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:07,970
I think.

2180
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:12,210
We started with a sub 100 gold at the beginning of this stream.

2181
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:18,170
You're so real for this and so relatable.

2182
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:20,270
Magic is too complicated.

2183
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:21,330
Maybe I'm just stupid.

2184
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,850
Bye.

2185
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:22,410
Bye.

2186
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:25,070
Maybe I am just a dummy.

2187
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:27,090
And I just want to brute force everything.

2188
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:33,450
Maybe I'm just like...

2189
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:35,610
I don't know.

2190
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:39,250
I'm like...

2191
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,210
Me, no magic.

2192
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:41,330
Me, no reed.

2193
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:43,390
Me...

2194
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,380
He's ragdolling again.

2195
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,400
He keeps looking like he's break dancing.

2196
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,020
Hi.

2197
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,080
Soon.

2198
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:03,680
Yeah.

2199
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,560
The gatekeeper's dead.

2200
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:09,660
As soon as you get one of those doors unlocked, we can go in.

2201
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,320
They're calling to me from in there.

2202
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,560
Soon as you get those doors unlocked, I'm going in.

2203
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:17,860
Okay.

2204
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:18,300
Okay.

2205
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,240
Let's get those doors unlocked.

2206
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:19,520
See you later.

2207
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,860
Let's get those doors unlocked.

2208
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,000
For you, buddy.

2209
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:23,200
J-Red!

2210
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:25,080
J-Red the go.

2211
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:28,580
Oh.

2212
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,140
Oh, we're going into dementia.

2213
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:31,800
Oops.

2214
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,620
Maybe we can get the sad one out of the way.

2215
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:41,450
I've entered the Shivering Isles.

2216
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:42,510
I should seek out...

2217
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:44,330
Sheogorath.

2218
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,670
Hi.

2219
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:46,170
Oh.

2220
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:46,950
Hi.

2221
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:48,430
Bye.

2222
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,440
Do you feel it?

2223
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,580
Do you feel the dementia?

2224
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:07,200
It doesn't look very much different than the last area we were in, to be honest.

2225
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:09,760
What?

2226
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:16,990
Who are you again?

2227
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:21,300
Oh, wait.

2228
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,320
We should go up this way.

2229
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,020
It's a camp.

2230
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:25,640
Oh.

2231
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,260
Are the people here friends?

2232
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,660
This is a summer camp, no?

2233
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,400
They should be friends.

2234
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,000
We're at the camp.

2235
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,580
You didn't just pull out a knife, did you?

2236
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,440
Oh, shoot.

2237
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,580
He knows magic.

2238
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:44,680
Oh, my God.

2239
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,560
Wait!

2240
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,380
You and your stupid child can die...

2241
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:58,500
Oh.

2242
01:37:58,740 --> 01:37:59,280
He's gone?

2243
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,180
Oh, just kidding.

2244
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:03,920
I hear something.

2245
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,960
What the hell is that?

2246
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:11,870
Oh, my God.

2247
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:12,950
My friend is getting attacked.

2248
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:14,230
I'm so sorry.

2249
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:16,330
I thought you were just not helping me.

2250
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:20,920
Ew.

2251
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,260
Where'd my friend go?

2252
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:30,480
J-Red!

2253
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:31,660
What are you doing over there?

2254
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:36,370
Over here.

2255
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,680
I'll take my stuff back.

2256
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,300
I don't need anything else.

2257
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:44,780
Wow.

2258
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:45,200
Wait.

2259
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:46,800
That's kind of...

2260
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:49,860
Kind of...

2261
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:51,920
Worth a lot of money.

2262
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,600
I'm at camp.

2263
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,420
Why do they call it camp if it's, like, evil?

2264
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:00,200
You know?

2265
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,560
It's a little misleading.

2266
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:07,660
Oops.

2267
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,400
Some fungus.

2268
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:10,820
I didn't want that.

2269
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:18,960
Yikes.

2270
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:22,420
Whoa!

2271
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:31,710
Oh!

2272
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:36,970
Most camps in the base games are bandit camps.

2273
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:38,690
That's so sad.

2274
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:41,570
He looks...

2275
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:43,650
He was wearing such, like, a pretty outfit, even.

2276
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:45,190
So I was like, you know...

2277
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:47,550
I don't know where my friend is.

2278
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,330
We've lost J-Red.

2279
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:51,510
For good, maybe.

2280
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:52,530
Wait.

2281
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:54,150
I really don't know where he is.

2282
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:57,290
J-Red!

2283
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:00,430
Can you hear me?

2284
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:02,290
Are you lost?

2285
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:03,590
Just...

2286
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:07,310
Follow the sound of my voice!

2287
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,760
We gotta go this way, anyway.

2288
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,120
Oh!

2289
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,740
Oh my god, he listened.

2290
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,400
Where are you going?

2291
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,160
You remember me, right?

2292
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:25,240
What?

2293
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,640
We should go hunting, soon.

2294
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,460
See, he still wants to go hunting.

2295
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:30,260
Okay.

2296
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:31,300
See you later!

2297
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:31,860
See you!

2298
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:36,890
I'm nervous for him.

2299
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:39,410
I'm nervous for him.

2300
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:44,370
Okay, we know those things are nasty, icky, evil, gross.

2301
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:50,650
I can hear them crawling a mile away.

2302
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:56,510
He just needs some quality standing time.

2303
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:01,850
I hope he doesn't forget why he came here, you know?

2304
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:06,750
Oh!

2305
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:10,820
Oh!

2306
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,260
I can't see anything!

2307
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:13,280
Wait.

2308
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,640
Maybe we should follow the road.

2309
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,380
Wait.

2310
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:19,980
Um...

2311
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,180
Do you think I can make it?

2312
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:29,290
Oh, we'll be fine.

2313
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,950
Oh.

2314
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:33,550
We're fine.

2315
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:34,410
Everything's fine.

2316
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,620
Is that a friend, or...

2317
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,560
No, probably not.

2318
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,420
Oh, I see a skelly.

2319
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,660
Wait, you think I can get him from here?

2320
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,700
Ultimate sniper?

2321
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,120
Oops.

2322
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:00,900
Holy!

2323
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,460
That other guy disappeared.

2324
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:06,840
Disappeared.

2325
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:11,310
Where'd he go?

2326
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,270
Nice shot.

2327
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:17,810
Thanks.

2328
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:21,130
I lost the other guy, though.

2329
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:25,730
Okay, maybe it's a good thing J-Red did not follow us.

2330
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:30,670
We're in a really...

2331
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:32,010
We're in...

2332
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,550
Zaselm.

2333
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,550
And that place, nobody wants to be here.

2334
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:39,770
Where'd he go?

2335
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,650
Where'd the big glowy guy go?

2336
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:44,370
I'm more afraid of him than the skelly.

2337
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:48,490
Hi.

2338
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,910
Okay.

2339
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:51,970
Um...

2340
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:52,350
Where should...

2341
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,750
I guess I can just drop down right here.

2342
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:00,170
I'm still sneaking, though.

2343
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:05,560
Whoa!

2344
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,720
Oh, it's a zombie!

2345
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:07,720
Maybe?

2346
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:12,690
Whoa!

2347
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:17,090
He's not gonna come back to life, is he?

2348
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,160
The...

2349
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,340
Mangled flesh.

2350
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:24,580
Void essence.

2351
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,340
That...

2352
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,020
Had a pretty penny on it.

2353
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:27,900
Okay.

2354
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,300
Onwards!

2355
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,220
Towards...

2356
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:30,980
This...

2357
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:31,180
City!

2358
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:36,470
It...

2359
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:37,230
Was a zombie.

2360
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,310
Oh my gosh.

2361
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:40,110
Game lagging.

2362
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:41,490
We're okay.

2363
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,540
Let's see a spitter.

2364
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,120
He's a little stupid.

2365
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:58,610
That was not a great shot, but it got the job done.

2366
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:03,550
I think I should go...

2367
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:04,830
The other way.

2368
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:11,480
Oh!

2369
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,840
People die when they are killed.

2370
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,820
What the hell is that?

2371
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,360
Is that a hunger?

2372
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:32,490
It's a gnarle sapling.

2373
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,130
Those are gnarles.

2374
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:45,150
I don't like this place anymore.

2375
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:46,910
I wanna get to the city.

2376
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:51,110
Wait, where did die at?

2377
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:54,110
Oh, here it is.

2378
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:55,670
Amber.

2379
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:58,030
Oh, it's got the gnarle bark!

2380
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:01,030
Everything's gnarle.

2381
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:04,650
My bad.

2382
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:05,890
Press the wrong button.

2383
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:12,630
There's a person in that water.

2384
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,460
Oh my goodness.

2385
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,080
Wait, it's so creepy.

2386
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:19,540
Maybe...

2387
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:26,030
I hear something.

2388
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:27,510
J-Rod?

2389
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,450
Oh, that's like a lizard.

2390
01:45:35,470 --> 01:45:37,030
I'm not so scared of that.

2391
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,280
I just don't wanna get ambushed for something.

2392
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,320
I'm trying to go around.

2393
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:47,340
We'll just go around.

2394
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:52,530
Lizard.

2395
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:52,750
It's so hard.

2396
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:57,530
As long as we stay on the edge.

2397
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:00,970
I think we'll be okay.

2398
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:06,610
What the?

2399
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:08,490
Hey.

2400
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,020
You were supposed to die in one hit.

2401
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,900
Dementia is gross and creepy.

2402
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,460
Mania is a lot more visually appealing.

2403
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,480
But lizards are cute.

2404
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,920
Yeah, this place sucks.

2405
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:22,820
You know what?

2406
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:25,780
It's better to get the bad one out of the way though first, no?

2407
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,380
He's faster than I expected.

2408
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:53,370
It doesn't look like a lizard.

2409
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,550
It looks like a rat person.

2410
01:46:57,570 --> 01:46:58,370
Speaking of...

2411
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,130
Holy cow.

2412
01:47:02,210 --> 01:47:03,410
Don't scream like that.

2413
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:04,310
You freaked me out.

2414
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,040
Oh.

2415
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:09,960
My aim.

2416
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:10,720
My aim.

2417
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:12,900
Okay.

2418
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:14,660
What is this?

2419
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,160
Is this anything here?

2420
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,400
Anything special?

2421
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:18,820
Oh, it's a hunger!

2422
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,760
Get his tongue.

2423
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,380
Oh, I see him.

2424
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:37,060
Hunger's got your tongue.

2425
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:40,880
Let's go.

2426
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:45,300
Gosh, we're still so far from the city.

2427
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:49,180
They're freaky, uh...

2428
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,100
We gotta go this way.

2429
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,360
Maybe running around here is a bit foolish, but...

2430
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:06,660
Another camp!

2431
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,300
Okay.

2432
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,360
Careful!

2433
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,280
Easy!

2434
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:13,100
Camps are not...

2435
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:14,680
Friendly.

2436
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,320
Wait, there's a wall?

2437
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,740
Guys, maybe I should've taken the road.

2438
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:30,390
Nice!

2439
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:34,250
Check the map.

2440
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:35,370
You're so right.

2441
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:36,410
The...

2442
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:37,970
My tail!

2443
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:47,140
As an Argonian, I like the dementia regions.

2444
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,420
It's cold, wet, and miserable.

2445
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:49,360
Just like home.

2446
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,260
I think we could actually...

2447
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,300
Wait, can we fast travel?

2448
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:00,540
Maybe not.

2449
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,120
We'll make it!

2450
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:10,720
Am I gonna get possessed of...

2451
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:13,660
Thoughts of sewer side?

2452
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:16,980
On this...

2453
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:17,780
On this area?

2454
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,520
Okay, I think we can get up here.

2455
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:26,940
Sewer slide, yeah.

2456
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,360
It's also like...

2457
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:34,920
Night time, right?

2458
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:36,920
It should look better in the day, right?

2459
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:47,020
Oh, that dog's got manja!

2460
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,540
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

2461
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:51,840
I put the...

2462
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,480
I put him out of his misery, truly.

2463
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,480
It's a skinned hound.

2464
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:01,780
Wait, this is day time?

2465
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:02,780
Wait, what time is it?

2466
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:04,260
No, no, see?

2467
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,300
It's 12 AM.

2468
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,820
It is quite night.

2469
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,480
Can we see...

2470
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:14,620
The...

2471
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,320
Wow!

2472
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,560
Actually, what if I just stand here for like 12 hours?

2473
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,680
Hello, VTuber.

2474
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:24,260
Hi!

2475
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:32,900
Oh...

2476
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:34,380
Oh, see?

2477
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:35,540
It's so much brighter.

2478
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,020
We could see the falls there.

2479
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:39,800
That's crazy.

2480
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:47,480
If I go down this way, we could go around like this.

2481
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:49,280
So this way, I think?

2482
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:50,600
Yes.

2483
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,700
Yeah, it's a little bit better.

2484
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:58,640
On the road again.

2485
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,040
I can't wait to be on the road again.

2486
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:06,820
Oh...

2487
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:07,700
Is that a hunger?

2488
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,720
Wait, who sees me?

2489
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,220
Who sees me?

2490
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:13,900
Ah!

2491
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:14,820
Sorry.

2492
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,560
Sorry.

2493
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,000
Oh, he's hungry!

2494
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:22,940
Oh,

2495
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:33,840
he's hungry!

2496
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,000
I heard another one.

2497
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:41,280
I don't think that's me splashing out of the water.

2498
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,190
You say how hungry?

2499
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,930
I think we know.

2500
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:51,610
He came after me...

2501
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:52,990
Very eagerly.

2502
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,980
It's a bit of a roundabout way, but I think it works.

2503
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,680
Just got your GamerSub stuff in the mail!

2504
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,240
Love your content.

2505
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,040
Glad to see you doing well.

2506
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,000
Thank you, Shio!

2507
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,320
Thank you!

2508
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:12,980
Thank you for the super chat.

2509
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,580
I saw a guy here.

2510
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,280
I did, I did.

2511
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:19,940
I spy with my Minto eyes.

2512
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:22,280
A little man!

2513
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:22,640
A little man!

2514
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:29,490
Ha-ha!

2515
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:35,660
Blister Pod.

2516
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,360
I like how there's a graveyard here.

2517
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:52,460
Hey, so was this place normal before?

2518
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:55,520
Why else would there be a graveyard?

2519
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:57,920
Curious.

2520
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,980
Is the madness setting in?

2521
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,800
I don't feel any worse than normal.

2522
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,560
I don't know if that's a good thing or not.

2523
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,360
Sorry I'm sneak walking the whole time.

2524
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,180
I just don't want to get...

2525
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:20,610
Are we going the right way?

2526
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:21,690
Yes.

2527
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,040
Oh shoot.

2528
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:33,140
Oh!

2529
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:33,920
Where'd he go?

2530
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:35,380
Uh-oh.

2531
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:37,080
Maybe I should've...

2532
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:37,740
Left him alone.

2533
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,360
Maybe I...

2534
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,980
Shouldn't have bothered.

2535
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:43,740
Oh.

2536
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:44,860
Where'd he go?

2537
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:49,850
Okay, bye!

2538
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:54,370
Uh...

2539
01:53:57,970 --> 01:53:58,590
Whoa!

2540
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:03,330
Cal...

2541
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,690
Calor...

2542
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:05,850
Calor...

2543
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:06,850
Calor...

2544
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,110
Because...

2545
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:09,030
Thank you so much for the...

2546
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:10,030
Thank you!

2547
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:11,010
Thank you!

2548
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:11,490
Thank you!

2549
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:12,970
Really appreciate it!

2550
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,810
Thank you so much!

2551
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:17,270
Oh my gosh, where did this guy go?

2552
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:22,890
He disappeared under the water and never returned!

2553
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:27,070
I did not kill him!

2554
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:28,070
I did not!

2555
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:29,890
Ah!

2556
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:33,400
Sorry!

2557
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:02,760
Young Ballywog!

2558
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:04,860
Stay away!

2559
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,180
Alright, hold on.

2560
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:09,740
I need to go...

2561
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,060
This way, I think?

2562
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:18,080
Oh, wait.

2563
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:19,020
I took that.

2564
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,080
It was worth nothing, but that's fine.

2565
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:25,000
Wait, I need to go...

2566
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:25,500
This way.

2567
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:26,480
Yes!

2568
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:26,860
Okay!

2569
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,380
Slowest jump scare...

2570
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:32,820
You

2571
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:40,870
just didn't expect to see him standing there!

2572
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:44,050
He was much bigger than I expected!

2573
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,680
He was just taller than...

2574
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:55,640
What I imagined!

2575
01:55:57,380 --> 01:55:58,500
See, there he is!

2576
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:58,980
There's...

2577
01:55:58,980 --> 01:55:59,620
There's another guy.

2578
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,240
He was...

2579
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,500
Walking...

2580
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,620
Really...

2581
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:07,100
Really slow towards me.

2582
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:09,900
Okay guys, we're almost there!

2583
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:11,480
Just...

2584
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:12,540
A hundred steps!

2585
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,580
We are like so...

2586
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,240
Stinking close.

2587
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:17,960
Oh, house!

2588
01:56:26,410 --> 01:56:27,730
We keep going.

2589
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:30,250
We keep going.

2590
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:33,190
Hi, chat!

2591
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:34,130
Aw!

2592
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:37,110
Greeting each other!

2593
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:39,830
It's like I'm in Florida!

2594
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:42,590
Them swamps!

2595
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:45,870
Every time I've played Oblivion and gone to the Shivering Isles, it's been weird.

2596
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,690
Hours later, I haven't gotten used to it.

2597
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:49,390
Kyrodil feels weird.

2598
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:50,430
Oh, sorry.

2599
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:51,850
Is it Kyrodil or Cyrodiil?

2600
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:52,430
I keep forgetting.

2601
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:56,050
Actually, I think I've been calling it Kyrodil this whole time, but it's Cyrodiil, isn't it?

2602
01:56:57,890 --> 01:56:58,450
Sorry.

2603
01:56:58,730 --> 01:56:59,370
I forgot.

2604
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:04,300
Cyrodiil.

2605
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:04,760
Yeah.

2606
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:07,420
How come I...

2607
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:11,140
He's hungry!

2608
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:12,220
Hungry!

2609
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:14,860
Hungry!

2610
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:15,600
Hungry!

2611
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,560
Oh, damn it.

2612
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:18,020
Don't jump.

2613
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:20,180
Oh my God!

2614
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:20,620
Oh my God!

2615
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:20,940
Oh my God!

2616
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:22,360
Sorry.

2617
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:24,120
Scared me.

2618
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:38,050
Oh my God!

2619
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:38,950
Back, fowl beast!

2620
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:43,270
We're close to the graveyard.

2621
01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:47,050
We're on the right path?

2622
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:47,550
Okay, yep.

2623
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:51,190
Speeding through my bone arrows.

2624
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:51,990
It's fine!

2625
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:54,550
I have other arrows.

2626
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:56,150
Wait, actually, are these better?

2627
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:57,010
Or worse?

2628
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:00,170
Oh wow, they're actually so much better.

2629
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:03,270
Let's go back to my iron arrows.

2630
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:05,350
We'll use these for an emergency.

2631
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:19,990
Curcible.

2632
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:25,380
I can't wait to like...

2633
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,540
Go to the pretty...

2634
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:29,640
Pretty place.

2635
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,760
Another graveyard.

2636
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:39,180
Why?

2637
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:39,760
Oh!

2638
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,720
What do you mean activate?

2639
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,940
Wait, it's been a minute since I've saved.

2640
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,860
Wait, what do you mean activate?

2641
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:52,360
Here lies blaze set.

2642
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,940
Faster than the wind.

2643
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:55,340
Dumber than a stump.

2644
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:56,900
Oh, okay.

2645
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,040
Run Nesta lies here.

2646
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:03,000
Covered in glory and dirt.

2647
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:08,170
Helene the Deaf.

2648
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,490
She never heard a coven!

2649
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:18,830
Vilval Teleram was thrown into this hole.

2650
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:21,150
You know who's gonna be here next?

2651
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:23,590
Sexiest tootious.

2652
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,930
Remember an endory.

2653
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:30,650
One day she will rise and take her vengeance.

2654
01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:34,150
Okay.

2655
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,640
It's the only one that sounded nice.

2656
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,540
Awashi probably drowned or something silly.

2657
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,720
Not that... Oh, a tree!

2658
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:13,200
Nice.

2659
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:22,870
I think we can get around this guy without Santas.

2660
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:26,290
Am I going the right way?

2661
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:27,670
Yeah, I'm just making sure.

2662
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:28,170
What is this?

2663
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:30,210
Oh, that's the graveyard we just saw.

2664
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:30,470
Okay.

2665
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:37,130
Nice shot, Mint.

2666
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:37,770
Thank you!

2667
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:38,070
Ooh!

2668
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:42,630
Thank you!

2669
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:46,130
We're so close.

2670
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:48,670
We're... literally here.

2671
02:00:49,370 --> 02:00:51,210
We're outside the gates.

2672
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:53,510
Eventually.

2673
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:57,610
The gates... of somewhere.

2674
02:01:03,410 --> 02:01:05,570
Is this the path I should have taken?

2675
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:10,780
Oh, there's a dog on the bridge!

2676
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:14,000
That's not a dog.

2677
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:18,240
I don't know what that is.

2678
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,080
Wait, this place is actually beautiful.

2679
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:23,920
What?

2680
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,840
I love having dementia!

2681
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,340
We made it!

2682
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,160
Holy cow.

2683
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,380
Oh my gosh, we made it finally.

2684
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:36,800
Maggie?

2685
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:42,620
I saw the Zaxxar, and I magged it too!

2686
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,840
Oh, fribble!

2687
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,960
This Mazkin must return to duty.

2688
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:48,380
Galburst in it.

2689
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,140
Blessings, citizen.

2690
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:51,660
Yeah!

2691
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:54,440
Hi!

2692
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:57,040
Mad God's blessings.

2693
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:06,070
The Mazkin guard Crucible in New Shayath.

2694
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:11,490
We ensure the demented remain orderly and respectful of our Lord Shayath.

2695
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:14,050
Miss Seducer.

2696
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:15,150
Miss Seducer.

2697
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:19,430
Shayath Gareth is our Lord, ruler of the Shivering Isles.

2698
02:02:19,610 --> 02:02:25,270
It is by his whim that the Mazkin walk, and we serve our master to the death.

2699
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:32,670
The Shivering Isles are a reflection of our Lord Shayath Gareth.

2700
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:35,470
Divided, yet perfect.

2701
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:38,850
Walk with our Lord.

2702
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:40,510
Yes, ma'am.

2703
02:02:40,510 --> 02:02:40,870
Man.

2704
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:43,250
Whoa.

2705
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:47,690
Stinky hole.

2706
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:50,790
What about you?

2707
02:02:50,910 --> 02:02:51,170
Who are you?

2708
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,790
Tell the Dane!

2709
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:52,850
Tell the Dane!

2710
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:54,390
Karnsky is Ralphing!

2711
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:55,950
He reminds me of Glarther.

2712
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:07,650
The quiet type.

2713
02:03:09,450 --> 02:03:11,530
Whoa, mysteries, you say?

2714
02:03:13,230 --> 02:03:14,450
Aeril's mysteries.

2715
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:18,210
Do you prefer dementia or mania?

2716
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:22,130
Well, I've only experienced dementia, so... You got a problem?

2717
02:03:22,410 --> 02:03:23,650
You got a problem?

2718
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:28,670
This guy's got a problem with everybody, apparently.

2719
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:29,890
Wait, don't come back!

2720
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:32,690
You got a problem?

2721
02:03:32,990 --> 02:03:33,970
You got a problem?

2722
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:35,530
Firm arms?

2723
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:36,710
A strong back?

2724
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:37,450
Yes!

2725
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:38,850
You'll do nicely.

2726
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:39,970
It's a shame.

2727
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:43,390
Time will ravage you, destroy you, wither you.

2728
02:03:43,610 --> 02:03:46,310
But there are alternatives.

2729
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:49,310
Time need not slow you.

2730
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:53,670
Tell me, have you ever considered placing yourself... on display?

2731
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:57,730
On display?

2732
02:03:58,110 --> 02:03:58,970
Oh, yes.

2733
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:02,450
You see, I am a student of chronomancy.

2734
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:05,250
The magic of time alteration.

2735
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:16,810
Using Magicka, I will slow your heart rate, your breathing, your movement, and your thoughts, until they may as well not be functioning at all.

2736
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:17,310
And?

2737
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:20,130
You will be perfectly preserved.

2738
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:22,210
Taken out of time.

2739
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:24,530
Beautiful forever.

2740
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:28,170
I will display you with the rest in my collection.

2741
02:04:28,590 --> 02:04:28,870
Oh.

2742
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:31,490
Wait, I can't say yes?

2743
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:32,750
Uh, no thank you.

2744
02:04:33,070 --> 02:04:33,430
Oh.

2745
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:34,630
What a pity.

2746
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:38,630
Well then, what is it that I can do for you?

2747
02:04:38,630 --> 02:04:40,030
And be quick about it.

2748
02:04:40,030 --> 02:04:43,230
Every second that passes brings us closer to our graves.

2749
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:44,310
Oh my god.

2750
02:04:45,970 --> 02:04:49,970
You may have experienced mania, but unfortunately, you have dementia.

2751
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:51,550
Woo!

2752
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,050
Recharge weapon purchase... Oh wait, that's...

2753
02:04:55,050 --> 02:04:56,810
Please, come back soon.

2754
02:04:57,170 --> 02:04:57,550
Thank you.

2755
02:04:57,710 --> 02:05:00,150
No telling what oddities I may have for you next time.

2756
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:01,330
No, please!

2757
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,110
Let me see your collection, mister!

2758
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:04,730
Is this a part of your collection?

2759
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:06,690
Wow.

2760
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:08,730
What?

2761
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:11,310
What a hunk.

2762
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:17,980
You got a problem?

2763
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,540
Well, hello there.

2764
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:24,180
It's good to see such a well-equipped individual as yourself around these parts.

2765
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:25,680
Dang, everybody's so into me.

2766
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:27,940
Carrying all that gear will do that to you.

2767
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:30,300
I'd be glad to shoulder some of the burden.

2768
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:32,420
Relieve you of that expensive stuff.

2769
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:34,600
Or is there something else I can take from you?

2770
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:36,820
I mean, help you with.

2771
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:38,700
Is this guy gonna...

2772
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,440
pickpocket me?

2773
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:44,400
But also, he's so like, he's so standoffish.

2774
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,240
And then as soon as he talks with me, he's like...

2775
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,800
Excuse me, I have important things to do.

2776
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:51,720
He's like, oh madame, your stuff, your...

2777
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,600
your things look so heavy.

2778
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,820
Ma'am, may I please hold them for you?

2779
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:56,920
Greetings.

2780
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:58,840
Apologies, citizen.

2781
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,100
But I must return to my post.

2782
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:01,880
Goodbye.

2783
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:03,100
Yes?

2784
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:04,100
Yes?

2785
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:04,760
Glu...

2786
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:05,540
Glu...

2787
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:06,080
Rolo...

2788
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:06,840
Roles?

2789
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,260
Your lips to his ears.

2790
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,340
Not the lickpocket!

2791
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:15,140
Did I say that on accident?

2792
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:16,420
No, pickpocket!

2793
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:21,560
I hear that Eril is fed up with Brythar's antics.

2794
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,460
He really wants something done about it.

2795
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:25,220
So kill Brythar.

2796
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,600
Eril has a big problem with Brythar.

2797
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:32,680
I don't know exactly what the problem is, but it's safe to say, Eril is making a huge fuss over...

2798
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:34,740
There's...

2799
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:34,920
There's...

2800
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:35,180
Yeah.

2801
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,040
There's...

2802
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:38,560
There's...

2803
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:39,660
Wait, does he want me to kill him?

2804
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:41,860
Rrythar!

2805
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:43,120
I'm good at that.

2806
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:45,460
Okay, let's go to the red arrow.

2807
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:45,920
Here we go.

2808
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:47,160
Psst!

2809
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,200
Over here!

2810
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:49,880
I need to talk to you.

2811
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:50,500
It's important!

2812
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:51,580
Yes?

2813
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:52,600
Over here!

2814
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,300
I need to talk to you.

2815
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:54,920
It's important!

2816
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:57,180
Hey you!

2817
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:59,360
I've got to ask you something.

2818
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:00,380
Something important!

2819
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:01,080
Shhh!

2820
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:02,680
Just come over here!

2821
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:04,000
Psst!

2822
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:04,720
Over here!

2823
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,420
I need to talk to you.

2824
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:07,040
It's important!

2825
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,380
Psst!

2826
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,140
Over here!

2827
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:10,860
I need to talk to you.

2828
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:11,400
It's important!

2829
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:13,080
Hey you!

2830
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:14,100
Here!

2831
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:14,620
You!

2832
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:16,080
Come over here!

2833
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:17,320
Psst!

2834
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,020
Over here!

2835
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:19,300
I need it.

2836
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,500
I have a proposition for you.

2837
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,080
Less not to talk about it here.

2838
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:25,580
Meet me at the sewer grate, northeast of the Shergorath statue.

2839
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:26,200
Oh no.

2840
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:26,940
Come after dark.

2841
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:27,820
Come alone.

2842
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,960
This is giving me Glarther vibes for real!

2843
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:38,940
For the dead gifted thank you!

2844
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:41,880
Oh, hello.

2845
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:43,300
How may I serve?

2846
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:46,760
Sorry.

2847
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,000
Can I jump up here?

2848
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:49,540
Okay, hold on.

2849
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,520
You didn't see that.

2850
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,360
Okay, hold on.

2851
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,860
What we're gonna do is we're gonna go to the sewer.

2852
02:07:59,120 --> 02:07:59,680
I've got fresh sticks!

2853
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,100
Guaranteed no leaves!

2854
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,480
And we're gonna wait.

2855
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,660
We're gonna wait until...

2856
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:09,100
It was probably the sewer that I saw before, maybe.

2857
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:11,700
Actually, I'm not sure.

2858
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:14,000
A tap house.

2859
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:15,840
What does that mean?

2860
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,080
Like, uh...

2861
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:19,880
Remember I said there was a stinky hole?

2862
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:22,000
It's probably that, I imagine.

2863
02:08:25,650 --> 02:08:27,850
I didn't expect to mean to stream while I was at work.

2864
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:29,090
Glad you're feeling better.

2865
02:08:29,210 --> 02:08:29,670
Thank you!

2866
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:33,350
Have a good time at work!

2867
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:33,870
Good luck!

2868
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:38,940
Oh, what's this?

2869
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:40,640
Oops.

2870
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:42,360
Potion of Feather!

2871
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,640
Wait, didn't someone mention this earlier?

2872
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:47,040
Oh, the bird left it.

2873
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:48,000
Oh.

2874
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:48,860
Maybe not.

2875
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,080
I saw the zaxer, and I'm at it too!

2876
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,340
Oh, fribble!

2877
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:54,420
Blessings of the mad gods.

2878
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:55,100
What's happening?

2879
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:56,680
Walk without fear.

2880
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,000
Gal bursting it.

2881
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:00,240
Who's hitting stuff?

2882
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,060
Okay, hold on.

2883
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:06,920
I'm getting down.

2884
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:08,140
We're doing it.

2885
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:09,900
I'm not breaking any bones.

2886
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,300
Let's go.

2887
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:14,760
Or maybe it's this one.

2888
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:18,420
Hmm.

2889
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:21,220
I think it was your feet.

2890
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:21,660
No!

2891
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:23,040
No way!

2892
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:26,800
Hold on, I'll wait here.

2893
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,460
It's three, so let's wait...

2894
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:31,640
What, like seven hours?

2895
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:32,100
That's nine.

2896
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:43,000
We'll find him.

2897
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:49,310
Is this him?

2898
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,380
This is not our guy.

2899
02:10:03,230 --> 02:10:04,790
Maybe this is not the area.

2900
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:08,230
Or wait, is this it?

2901
02:10:08,450 --> 02:10:09,670
Was I right the first time?

2902
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:11,270
Oh my gosh, I was!

2903
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:12,070
Hot dog!

2904
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:13,870
Hey, you!

2905
02:10:14,190 --> 02:10:14,830
Come over here.

2906
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:15,810
I need to talk to you.

2907
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:16,730
It's important.

2908
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,790
Won't someone end me?

2909
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:22,610
Take my life.

2910
02:10:23,090 --> 02:10:23,270
Please.

2911
02:10:23,790 --> 02:10:24,510
Here is no!

2912
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:27,010
I'm glad you came.

2913
02:10:27,490 --> 02:10:30,170
So, are you interested in earning some loot?

2914
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:30,850
Yes.

2915
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:32,490
Great.

2916
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:34,410
There's a...

2917
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:36,150
A simple task.

2918
02:10:36,370 --> 02:10:36,650
Yes.

2919
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:38,510
A simple task that you must perform.

2920
02:10:38,650 --> 02:10:38,870
Okay.

2921
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:40,730
What's the task?

2922
02:10:42,510 --> 02:10:43,070
This...

2923
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:43,550
Life...

2924
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:44,110
It's...

2925
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:45,530
Well, it's too painful.

2926
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:50,090
Everywhere I look, I see death, dying, and decay.

2927
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:53,950
When I dream, I see a world without sunshine.

2928
02:10:54,290 --> 02:11:00,650
I'm constantly on the verge of retching up, or falling asleep, or screaming at someone who doesn't deserve it.

2929
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:03,330
I'm just so fed up with it all.

2930
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:23,870
Oh!

2931
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:26,790
I don't think he's having just a bad day!

2932
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:27,130
Hey!

2933
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:28,790
Oh!

2934
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:30,590
Itina!

2935
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:42,780
We're right next to this...

2936
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:43,400
S...

2937
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,020
Sewer slides!

2938
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:53,500
I kinda wanna see the third answer just because it's so horrible.

2939
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:57,040
It is what E-Tina would say.

2940
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:01,760
Have you seen those miserable souls on the hill of suicides?

2941
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:05,940
Do you think that that kind of existence is any better than this?

2942
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:09,580
No, you must kill me.

2943
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,680
How do you want to die?

2944
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:14,880
I don't necessarily want to see it coming.

2945
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:18,920
And I want to die here in the city so all these people finally believe me.

2946
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:20,600
I wish they were nicer.

2947
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:24,540
You probably want to do it without spectators, though, so you don't get in trouble.

2948
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,520
Best to make it look like an accident.

2949
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:28,760
But remember, I don't want to see it coming.

2950
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:29,760
Take me unaware.

2951
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:31,680
How?

2952
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,200
It should look like an accident.

2953
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:33,540
How?

2954
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,300
Well, that's up to you, I suppose.

2955
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,820
I'm going to go about my daily life, such as it is.

2956
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:39,560
You gotta looney tunes it.

2957
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,040
As if nothing has changed.

2958
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:42,680
I'm gonna put an anvil on his head.

2959
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:42,960
Make a move when you wish.

2960
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:44,860
But please, do it soon.

2961
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:48,940
Oh, and about this reward?

2962
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:50,180
Oh, that.

2963
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:53,180
When you kill me, take the key to my house.

2964
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:56,940
Nothing really worth taking except what's locked up in the jewelry box.

2965
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:57,960
You can have that.

2966
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:58,520
Okay.

2967
02:12:58,600 --> 02:12:58,840
Okay.

2968
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:00,920
I'm going to pretend everything is normal.

2969
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:03,480
Make your move as soon as you can.

2970
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:06,220
But let me get away first so I don't know it's coming.

2971
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:07,640
Often with old age.

2972
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:08,000
Oh.

2973
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:08,760
Not like this.

2974
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:10,100
Oh.

2975
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:11,720
I didn't do anything, guard.

2976
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:16,200
Uh...

2977
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:17,340
An accident.

2978
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:18,500
Please!

2979
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:19,060
No!

2980
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:22,440
Not yet!

2981
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,800
You're making it really obvious!

2982
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:25,480
Please!

2983
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:25,480
No!

2984
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:27,820
Okay, I'm leaving.

2985
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:28,220
I'm leaving.

2986
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:28,660
I'm leaving.

2987
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:29,460
I'm leaving.

2988
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:30,340
I'm leaving.

2989
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:30,700
I'm leaving.

2990
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:30,800
I'm leaving.

2991
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:36,200
I'm leaving.

2992
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:36,580
Happy birthday!

2993
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:38,800
Happy, happy birthday!

2994
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:39,660
Happy, happy birthday!

2995
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,160
Okay, hold on.

2996
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:40,720
Let's see.

2997
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,520
Let's see.

2998
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:45,200
Let's see.

2999
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:49,060
Um...

3000
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:49,860
Please, no!

3001
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,060
This is a wild first side quest.

3002
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:57,900
Okay.

3003
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,620
Ask that I kill him.

3004
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:05,220
How could I make it an accident?

3005
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:13,140
How do I make it an accident?

3006
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:27,360
Hmm...

3007
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,740
Do I like pick this up?

3008
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:36,820
I don't think an arrow in his head...

3009
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:38,160
It looks like an accident.

3010
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:41,700
Poison food.

3011
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,720
Oh, maybe.

3012
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:44,040
Maybe I like...

3013
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:46,660
Where'd he go?

3014
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:51,700
Maybe I sneak some poison food into his...

3015
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:52,640
Into his pocket.

3016
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,320
Let's assuming he'll eat it.

3017
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:00,400
I could try and shoot him.

3018
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,280
I was thinking about that apple too.

3019
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:12,820
Wait.

3020
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:13,380
Save?

3021
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:16,840
Sorry, I forgot how to quick save you guys.

3022
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:19,640
You've trained for this.

3023
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:21,820
Think of all the Barneys you accidentally killed.

3024
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:22,780
It's so me!

3025
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:38,230
This is our guy, no?

3026
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:39,290
Wait.

3027
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:40,830
What if this is not our guy?

3028
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:41,990
I think it's him.

3029
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:55,940
Uh...

3030
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:56,660
How do I push?

3031
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:10,100
Come on, man.

3032
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:11,780
I'm trying to make it easy for you.

3033
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:16,040
Sometimes I come up here to think.

3034
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:18,900
Everything looks so small from up here.

3035
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:22,840
Makes me feel better, you know?

3036
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,120
Like I'm not so small myself.

3037
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:28,180
But that feeling only lasts a little while.

3038
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:34,560
Then I start thinking about how miserable everything is, and then all I want to do is step off the ledge.

3039
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,140
I can't just jump.

3040
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,540
Don't want to end up on the hill.

3041
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:45,180
But I hope that someday maybe a big gust of wind will come and push me off so I can end it all.

3042
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:50,640
Today's your lucky day.

3043
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:51,280
What?

3044
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:04,700
Someone really ought to put up a railing.

3045
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:06,620
That happens all the time.

3046
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:09,460
Curious...

3047
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:11,800
Cluedamnus is dead.

3048
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:13,020
Just as he wanted.

3049
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:15,300
I can now get my reward from his house.

3050
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:17,140
The key should be on his core.

3051
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:19,600
Someone really ought to put up a railing.

3052
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:21,120
That happens all the time.

3053
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:27,070
Oh, there he is!

3054
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:30,390
Oh, face first in the goo!

3055
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:37,910
I have...

3056
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:39,090
...Heras' house key.

3057
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:41,850
I should go claim my reward from his jewelry box.

3058
02:17:42,730 --> 02:17:44,870
I took a little extra too, sorry.

3059
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:46,850
Where's his house?

3060
02:17:49,570 --> 02:17:50,850
Just as he wanted.

3061
02:17:57,030 --> 02:17:57,910
He said...

3062
02:17:57,910 --> 02:18:00,410
Things found upper floor.

3063
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:02,110
Things found.

3064
02:18:03,710 --> 02:18:05,130
Hello, where's your home?

3065
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:05,750
Oh!

3066
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:07,670
Oh, oh!

3067
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:08,750
Wait, oh!

3068
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:10,550
I didn't see it marked.

3069
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,460
This isn't it, right?

3070
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:19,660
Is this

3071
02:18:25,830 --> 02:18:26,050
it?

3072
02:18:26,710 --> 02:18:27,210
No.

3073
02:18:29,330 --> 02:18:30,910
Timeless last words.

3074
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:31,590
What?

3075
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:33,490
He said, don't make it obvious.

3076
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:39,750
What?

3077
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:43,910
It was...

3078
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:44,070
Oh.

3079
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:46,310
He had interesting...

3080
02:18:46,310 --> 02:18:46,490
Oh.

3081
02:18:47,450 --> 02:18:47,910
Whoa.

3082
02:18:48,990 --> 02:18:51,050
He had interesting decor taste.

3083
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:51,770
Oh.

3084
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:52,790
Whoa.

3085
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:54,710
Whoa.

3086
02:18:55,710 --> 02:18:56,750
Whoa.

3087
02:18:57,730 --> 02:18:58,370
Whoa.

3088
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:05,610
I have a witness.

3089
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:06,770
She didn't even care.

3090
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:11,550
Oh, his place is so...

3091
02:19:11,550 --> 02:19:12,850
So small.

3092
02:19:13,210 --> 02:19:13,550
Oh!

3093
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:17,010
Oh!

3094
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:18,890
Shut up!

3095
02:19:19,010 --> 02:19:20,390
It's a ring of happiness?

3096
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:26,750
I've claimed your eye reward.

3097
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:29,530
Wait, what does it say?

3098
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:31,370
Wait, let's put on a ring?

3099
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,440
Why wasn't he wearing it?

3100
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:44,480
Why wasn't he wearing it?

3101
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:47,240
Why wasn't he wearing it?

3102
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:49,280
Uh...

3103
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:49,600
Oh, here.

3104
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,500
Uh, here.

3105
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,780
I've wanted to die for quite some time.

3106
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,780
Things just aren't going right.

3107
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:59,660
Never have gone right, really.

3108
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:01,700
No one seems to care either.

3109
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,720
Nor even notice I exist.

3110
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:08,600
Not that I'd have much to say even if someone had wanted to be my friend.

3111
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,360
I'd make a lousy friend anyway.

3112
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:17,780
I'm probably even boring the person reading this.

3113
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:19,840
I'm certainly boring myself.

3114
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:22,700
Not that anyone will ever find this note.

3115
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:24,960
Oh, but if they do...

3116
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:31,900
Did Eeyore write this right?

3117
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:37,440
If they do, it means that I've been granted my greatest wish.

3118
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:39,800
To be released from this mortal coil.

3119
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:42,480
This isn't a sewer side note.

3120
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:43,140
No.

3121
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:47,160
That would mean I've taken my own life and we all know what that means.

3122
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:49,040
Who wants that kind of existence?

3123
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:51,100
To be reborn on a hill every day.

3124
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,160
Reset as if nothing ever happened.

3125
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:55,720
That's even worse than the life I'm living.

3126
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:57,260
Life I've lived.

3127
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:58,660
Yes, yes, yes.

3128
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,060
I sure...

3129
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:01,540
I'm sure I'm happy now.

3130
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:02,620
The dead me.

3131
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:05,480
The me writing this note isn't happy at all.

3132
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:07,500
Never have been happy really.

3133
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:14,500
Anyway, the purpose of this note is to say to the man or woman who has killed me.

3134
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,660
Thank you.

3135
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:21,280
All I really have is this queer little ring.

3136
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:23,800
A wizard gave it to me once.

3137
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:27,700
Said I reminded him of his dead son.

3138
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:31,540
I guess I resemble his dead son even more now.

3139
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:33,380
He never even wore it.

3140
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:33,940
Wait.

3141
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:34,940
Maybe he did.

3142
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:39,820
Anyway, he said it would make me happy.

3143
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:44,200
Lift the weight of the world off my shoulders or some such thing.

3144
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:48,260
Come to think of it, it's the only time anyone has ever given me anything.

3145
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:50,360
Personally, I think this...

3146
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:51,860
Think the thing is worthless.

3147
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:53,080
Just like me.

3148
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:57,620
I tried it for a while.

3149
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:58,680
The happiness ring.

3150
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,720
But eventually I couldn't wear it anymore.

3151
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,380
It made me feel odd.

3152
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:03,500
Not myself.

3153
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:06,760
I didn't like feeling that way, so I locked it away.

3154
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,360
He didn't like being happy?

3155
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:13,730
He wasn't used to happiness?

3156
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:18,150
It's pretty enough though.

3157
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:20,610
It might fetch a few gold coins at the merchant.

3158
02:22:20,890 --> 02:22:23,110
Sorry not to leave much more behind.

3159
02:22:23,370 --> 02:22:26,930
But my life never really amounted to much anyway, did it?

3160
02:22:27,430 --> 02:22:28,570
Yours truly...

3161
02:22:28,570 --> 02:22:29,630
Yours very truly.

3162
02:22:29,630 --> 02:22:33,930
Here was Clutimus Deceased.

3163
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:44,520
I had fun once, it was awful.

3164
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:46,120
Yeah, truly.

3165
02:22:47,020 --> 02:22:48,280
What was he reading?

3166
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:53,800
The Liturgy of Affliction.

3167
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:03,550
Ripperoni.

3168
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:14,680
So sad.

3169
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:24,600
Oh yeah, we were gonna go see that guy, the king or whatever.

3170
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:25,980
Hello.

3171
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:27,120
Yes?

3172
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:28,480
You okay?

3173
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:29,400
You got a tummy ache?

3174
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,140
You got some skooma, eh?

3175
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:32,940
Run, buddy!

3176
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,280
Not the skooma!

3177
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:35,460
To share!

3178
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,340
Come on!

3179
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:39,700
Pass the skooma already!

3180
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:40,420
No!

3181
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:42,360
No skooma!

3182
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:44,060
Wait, do I still have skooma?

3183
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:45,440
All right.

3184
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:46,680
It's about time.

3185
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:47,880
Give it me already.

3186
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:51,080
Get your own skooma.

3187
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:53,260
Don't be so cruel!

3188
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:55,980
I hope you die a horrible death!

3189
02:23:58,570 --> 02:24:00,830
Next time, bring some skooma with you.

3190
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:02,970
Okay, ma'am.

3191
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:03,350
Oh.

3192
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:05,310
She got the skooma shakes.

3193
02:24:06,350 --> 02:24:07,490
No skooma!

3194
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:08,210
No more!

3195
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:11,130
Okay.

3196
02:24:11,130 --> 02:24:12,370
I think I remember.

3197
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:15,270
It was like around over here.

3198
02:24:15,790 --> 02:24:16,190
This place is...

3199
02:24:16,190 --> 02:24:16,350
Yeah.

3200
02:24:16,490 --> 02:24:16,850
Up here.

3201
02:24:18,310 --> 02:24:20,550
Her voice changed so much.

3202
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:23,830
I hope you die a horrible death!

3203
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:26,350
If you don't break the skooma!

3204
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:31,590
You are!

3205
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:31,730
Whoa!

3206
02:24:33,070 --> 02:24:33,410
Oh!

3207
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,200
Hairy tree!

3208
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:39,420
Whoa!

3209
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:43,660
Whoa!

3210
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:45,640
Oh my gosh!

3211
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:46,160
Hi!

3212
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:47,740
Sorry!

3213
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:49,900
It's beautiful!

3214
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:02,400
Are you a seducer too?

3215
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:03,280
Speak citizen!

3216
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:06,100
No, you're a golden saint guard.

3217
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,300
Speak quickly!

3218
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:09,420
Yeah, you are hot though.

3219
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:12,900
Sheogorath rules the Shivering Isles.

3220
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:15,700
We, the Oriole, are his favorite soldiers.

3221
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:18,140
The most perfect expression of his might.

3222
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:20,500
Damn.

3223
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:21,780
Go.

3224
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,160
Yes, ma'am.

3225
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,260
It's a terrific JPEG.

3226
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:29,380
With the sky?

3227
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:30,680
Yeah, I thought so too.

3228
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:32,940
Is this him?

3229
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:35,640
Activate.

3230
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:37,080
Activate.

3231
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:39,680
How do I activate these busts?

3232
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:44,930
Um, hold on.

3233
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:46,410
I'm gonna go back to...

3234
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:46,830
Oh, shoot.

3235
02:25:47,970 --> 02:25:50,100
I'm gonna go back to, uh...

3236
02:25:51,730 --> 02:25:52,350
This.

3237
02:25:54,990 --> 02:25:56,050
Oh, up here.

3238
02:25:59,510 --> 02:26:01,110
How may I serve?

3239
02:26:02,770 --> 02:26:04,330
Me when I'm a maid.

3240
02:26:05,210 --> 02:26:06,230
Oh wait.

3241
02:26:06,510 --> 02:26:07,950
That's every day.

3242
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:16,030
How may I serve?

3243
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,680
You can't on stream, it's TOS.

3244
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:36,780
What are you asking for?

3245
02:26:50,930 --> 02:26:52,150
What?

3246
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:54,810
What?

3247
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:56,290
What?

3248
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:57,390
What?

3249
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:11,720
What?

3250
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:11,820
What?

3251
02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:15,100
There's our man!

3252
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:23,440
The slow clap.

3253
02:27:25,230 --> 02:27:26,380
Is that for me?

3254
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:27,440
Wait!

3255
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:30,760
You have dementia, and you have the mania.

3256
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:31,980
Hello!

3257
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:33,160
Well, look who's here!

3258
02:27:33,460 --> 02:27:34,160
You!

3259
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:35,020
Hey!

3260
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:36,620
How about that?

3261
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:37,220
Yeah!

3262
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:41,780
I sing Lord of the Rings while...

3263
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:42,440
20 shots...

3264
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:43,840
in.

3265
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:44,580
Oh.

3266
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:46,640
Uh...

3267
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,820
Drink some water, Sharko!

3268
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:50,480
A new arrival!

3269
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:51,540
New arrival!

3270
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:55,680
I'm so happy, I could just...

3271
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:56,500
Eat a horse!

3272
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:59,400
...tear out your intestines, and strangle you with them!

3273
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:03,740
I suppose an introduction is in order.

3274
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:09,460
I'm Sheogorath, Prince of Madness!

3275
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:10,860
And...

3276
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:11,340
And...

3277
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:11,800
Other things.

3278
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,240
I'm not talking about them.

3279
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:16,960
You've probably figured that out by now.

3280
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:18,220
Let's hope so.

3281
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:20,120
Or we're in real trouble.

3282
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:21,140
And...

3283
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:23,040
Out come the intestines!

3284
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:23,740
Oh.

3285
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:24,800
And I...

3286
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:26,260
Skip rope with them!

3287
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:28,640
He's really into my intestines.

3288
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:29,620
But perhaps...

3289
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:31,040
Now's not the time.

3290
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:32,600
And you've made it this far.

3291
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:34,020
Farther than anyone else.

3292
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:34,860
Well done!

3293
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:36,020
Take him out to dinner first.

3294
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:37,200
Take this trinket of mine.

3295
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,360
Perhaps it will serve you well.

3296
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:41,220
Or look...

3297
02:28:41,220 --> 02:28:42,560
Lovely on your corpse.

3298
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:43,280
Ooh!

3299
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:45,340
What do you want?

3300
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:47,120
I got a charity of madness?

3301
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:47,760
Is that what it said?

3302
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:49,540
I've been waiting for you!

3303
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:51,280
For someone like you.

3304
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:52,060
He's flirting with me.

3305
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:53,640
For someone other than you, for some time.

3306
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:54,880
Oh, did he just lose his hand?

3307
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:55,400
I'm the champion!

3308
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:56,680
And you've...

3309
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:57,980
Got the job!

3310
02:28:58,380 --> 02:29:00,380
Trying to save the realm!

3311
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:02,220
Rescue the damsel!

3312
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:03,940
Slay the beast!

3313
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:06,920
Or die trying.

3314
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:09,320
Your help is required.

3315
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:11,360
A change is coming!

3316
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:13,380
Everything changes!

3317
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,540
Even Daedric Princes.

3318
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:19,380
Especially Daedric Princes.

3319
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:20,180
Okay.

3320
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:21,920
Changes?

3321
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:24,680
Daedra are the embodiment of change.

3322
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:26,140
Change and permanency.

3323
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:27,380
I'm no different.

3324
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:29,040
Except in the ways that I am.

3325
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:31,100
A Grey March is coming!

3326
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:34,180
And you're going to stop it.

3327
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:36,820
Grey March.

3328
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,000
The details aren't important.

3329
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:41,000
At least, not right now.

3330
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:41,720
Okay.

3331
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:43,680
Eternity is on a rather tight deadline.

3332
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:46,440
We'll get back to that later.

3333
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:49,020
What now?

3334
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:53,080
Now, you run an errand for me.

3335
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:54,420
An important one.

3336
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,360
Of course.

3337
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:58,320
Anything I tell you to do...

3338
02:29:58,320 --> 02:29:59,020
Is important.

3339
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:01,120
My realm.

3340
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,400
My rules.

3341
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:03,380
My rules.

3342
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:05,300
You're going to Zedillion.

3343
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:08,320
One of my favorite spots in the Isles.

3344
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:11,000
It's a little place I used to take care of...

3345
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,500
Did I go there?

3346
02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:12,920
Unwanted visitors.

3347
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:17,640
And some are more unwanted than others.

3348
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:19,200
Did I accidentally find that place?

3349
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:20,240
Why Zedillion?

3350
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:22,840
The gatekeeper takes care of most of the unwanted.

3351
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:24,700
But he's dead.

3352
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:27,640
We'll have to remedy that soon as well.

3353
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:28,920
Anyway.

3354
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:32,640
There are those that have other ways into my realm.

3355
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:33,980
And they're on the move.

3356
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:36,220
We don't want them here.

3357
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:37,540
Trust me.

3358
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:39,680
How did you expect me to get them?

3359
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,980
So, you're going to get Zedillion up and running.

3360
02:30:42,260 --> 02:30:42,540
You know.

3361
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:44,560
Here's a little book to tell you how.

3362
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:47,060
And the attenuator of judgment.

3363
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:48,640
You'll need that too.

3364
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:49,400
Oh, oh.

3365
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:49,940
Of course.

3366
02:30:50,140 --> 02:30:52,540
You can always get more details from Haskell.

3367
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,180
He's a detail-oriented type of person.

3368
02:30:55,380 --> 02:30:56,100
A big help.

3369
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:58,900
And a snappy dresser.

3370
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:00,680
Now, get going.

3371
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:02,560
Before I change my mind.

3372
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:05,740
Or my mind changes me.

3373
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:11,460
Reached a spirit rank in the Court of Madness.

3374
02:31:11,460 --> 02:31:12,720
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

3375
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:13,160
Ha?

3376
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:14,680
You can go now.

3377
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:15,380
Run along.

3378
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:15,880
Scoot.

3379
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:17,540
Hi, Haskell.

3380
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:18,460
Always a pleasure.

3381
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:19,700
Yeah, I know.

3382
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,860
He reminds me of some... someone.

3383
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:23,320
I can't.

3384
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:24,660
Like some TV...

3385
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:26,080
Or some movie character.

3386
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:27,600
I can't...

3387
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:30,000
I can't place it.

3388
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:34,280
Shoo.

3389
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:34,840
Go.

3390
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:35,780
Be gone.

3391
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:36,640
Things to do.

3392
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,420
Boop.

3393
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:38,800
Always a pleasure.

3394
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:39,380
Okay.

3395
02:31:42,110 --> 02:31:43,820
What about your bust?

3396
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:48,880
What's this?

3397
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:52,080
The door is sealed.

3398
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:52,980
Aww.

3399
02:31:55,430 --> 02:31:56,460
What's this?

3400
02:31:58,660 --> 02:31:59,760
Activate.

3401
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:02,660
Nothing activates here.

3402
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:03,860
Everything is broken.

3403
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:09,260
In the original game...

3404
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:10,900
Shiel Garroth...

3405
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:13,440
Was the only NPC with a proper beard.

3406
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:22,040
Wow...

3407
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:24,620
Etina must feel so cool...

3408
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:26,560
Like...

3409
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:28,640
Being...

3410
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,000
Below this, you know?

3411
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:32,000
Okay.

3412
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:33,980
One thing I do want to do...

3413
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:36,760
Is...

3414
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:38,160
Can we go back here?

3415
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:41,460
Wait, no.

3416
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:42,240
We found...

3417
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:42,380
Wait.

3418
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:43,040
Where are we going?

3419
02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:44,700
We found...

3420
02:32:46,700 --> 02:32:48,800
I think we found the wrong place.

3421
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:51,520
But I want to go see the other place too.

3422
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:53,580
So let's go to the Gates of Madness...

3423
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:54,300
Again.

3424
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:57,340
And we're gonna leave...

3425
02:32:57,340 --> 02:32:58,200
Dementia World.

3426
02:32:59,220 --> 02:33:01,380
And we're gonna go instead to...

3427
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:03,620
Uh...

3428
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:04,640
Madness.

3429
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:06,160
Mania World.

3430
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:07,000
Woohoo!

3431
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:09,500
Mania World sounds like a really fun...

3432
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:11,380
Um...

3433
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,120
A really fun theme park, actually.

3434
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:18,860
You can go to Mania from the Capitol?

3435
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:20,680
Oh...

3436
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:21,220
Oops.

3437
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:23,220
I went the long way.

3438
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:26,480
You can just head north of the city.

3439
02:33:27,220 --> 02:33:27,740
Oops.

3440
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:29,740
I didn't know.

3441
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:30,920
Wait.

3442
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:32,100
It's okay though.

3443
02:33:32,180 --> 02:33:32,560
We're here.

3444
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:36,420
There we go.

3445
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:39,000
Do you think...

3446
02:33:39,380 --> 02:33:40,160
Jared's okay?

3447
02:33:44,600 --> 02:33:46,900
Do you think that guy is alright?

3448
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:50,580
Do you think he's...

3449
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:50,880
Around?

3450
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:51,900
Still?

3451
02:33:58,400 --> 02:33:59,840
A thousand...

3452
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:03,920
Okay, but this place might not be as evil.

3453
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:05,640
Maybe.

3454
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:06,720
What the?

3455
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:09,500
Are you kidding me?

3456
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:11,980
If we went to the left...

3457
02:34:19,220 --> 02:34:20,540
Is he still here?

3458
02:34:24,450 --> 02:34:25,130
JJ!

3459
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:32,560
He's gone.

3460
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:34,340
No way.

3461
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,120
So if we went to the right...

3462
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:36,740
Oh...

3463
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:39,390
And if we went to the left...

3464
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:43,300
Oh...

3465
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:44,700
No.

3466
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:46,100
What?

3467
02:34:49,830 --> 02:34:50,410
JJ!

3468
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:56,920
We should go hunting...

3469
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:57,300
Soon.

3470
02:34:57,560 --> 02:34:58,180
He's alright!

3471
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:01,080
The gatekeeper's dead.

3472
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:03,980
He won't stop us from coming and going now.

3473
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:04,440
Yeah.

3474
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:10,140
If you have to fight a flesh Atronach, a good shock spell is the way to go.

3475
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:11,940
See you!

3476
02:35:12,140 --> 02:35:13,900
He hasn't even made it...

3477
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:14,980
Even a little...

3478
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:16,100
Far.

3479
02:35:21,710 --> 02:35:23,150
Okay, so we go this way.

3480
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:24,750
What time?

3481
02:35:24,890 --> 02:35:27,090
Oh, you cannot wait when enemies are...

3482
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:27,690
Wait, where?

3483
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:30,570
I just wanted to see what time it was.

3484
02:35:31,310 --> 02:35:32,590
What do you mean there's enemies?

3485
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:35,030
Oh.

3486
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:36,470
You cannot wait when enemies...

3487
02:35:40,610 --> 02:35:41,010
Where?

3488
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:45,010
Maybe we should just go back to the palace room.

3489
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:50,000
The time is on the map?

3490
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:52,120
Oh.

3491
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:53,320
It's 7am.

3492
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:02,600
Hmm.

3493
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:04,600
Curious.

3494
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,960
This place is pretty though.

3495
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,340
It's real cute.

3496
02:36:18,270 --> 02:36:18,970
Halala!

3497
02:36:23,970 --> 02:36:24,850
This way?

3498
02:36:26,110 --> 02:36:27,030
Which way?

3499
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:28,910
This way?

3500
02:36:30,390 --> 02:36:31,190
This way?

3501
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:31,690
This way?

3502
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:32,770
Oh my gosh.

3503
02:36:32,870 --> 02:36:34,030
It is a long...

3504
02:36:37,490 --> 02:36:38,010
Long...

3505
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,630
Road.

3506
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:46,200
We're gonna go to here.

3507
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:52,320
I wanna go to the other city.

3508
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:54,160
Oh wait.

3509
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:54,580
Oh wait.

3510
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:55,180
Would I...

3511
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:57,040
I wonder if...

3512
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:58,280
Will I run into her?

3513
02:37:00,700 --> 02:37:01,740
How do I get out of here?

3514
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:07,980
Blessings, citizen.

3515
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:08,800
I'm lost!

3516
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:10,700
How do I get out of your castle?

3517
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:14,100
Um...

3518
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:14,900
North?

3519
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:21,000
Up here?

3520
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:22,820
Speak quickly, mortal.

3521
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:24,220
I'm lost!

3522
02:37:32,050 --> 02:37:33,090
I'm lost!

3523
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:34,470
Here's the exit.

3524
02:37:34,730 --> 02:37:36,110
I don't know where it is!

3525
02:37:41,370 --> 02:37:43,790
I've got his bust and that's about it!

3526
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:45,290
Wait, can I jump out from here?

3527
02:37:45,850 --> 02:37:46,370
No.

3528
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:49,410
I found it!

3529
02:37:49,690 --> 02:37:49,730
I found it!

3530
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:50,210
Oh my gosh!

3531
02:37:54,250 --> 02:37:55,370
We made it!

3532
02:37:57,430 --> 02:37:58,030
Okay.

3533
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:01,490
Is this a different town now?

3534
02:38:05,970 --> 02:38:06,570
Hello!

3535
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:07,110
Ungor?

3536
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:09,070
Ungor?

3537
02:38:09,330 --> 02:38:10,670
I don't belong here!

3538
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:11,830
I'm not crazy!

3539
02:38:12,130 --> 02:38:13,130
Not like the rest of them!

3540
02:38:13,450 --> 02:38:16,170
They watch me, you know, waiting for me to go crazy!

3541
02:38:16,770 --> 02:38:16,790
This guy is just Glarthor.

3542
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:17,670
But I won't...

3543
02:38:17,670 --> 02:38:17,830
Nope!

3544
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:20,450
I think Glarthor belongs here.

3545
02:38:21,310 --> 02:38:25,850
Umag Grabonk, at the missing pauldron, is collecting that amber you find in the root tunnels.

3546
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:27,530
Okay.

3547
02:38:27,710 --> 02:38:27,770
Bye.

3548
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:28,470
Bye.

3549
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:31,930
We have one mission.

3550
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:32,770
Greetings!

3551
02:38:33,570 --> 02:38:33,910
Greetings!

3552
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:42,100
Oh.

3553
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,280
I'm not like them.

3554
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:44,860
Are you?

3555
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:46,000
Are you one of them?

3556
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:47,620
Cease your prattling.

3557
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:48,740
Take care!

3558
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:49,500
You good?

3559
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:49,980
Hello.

3560
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:51,160
Don't mind me.

3561
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:52,620
I'm a little tired.

3562
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:54,400
Can't sleep at home, you know.

3563
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:55,960
The walls, they aren't safe.

3564
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:58,060
I also walk like that when I'm tired.

3565
02:38:58,520 --> 02:38:59,520
The walls aren't safe.

3566
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:00,140
Don't you know?

3567
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:01,860
You don't, do you?

3568
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:03,840
Well, it's lucky you met me.

3569
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:06,620
Here, you've been walking around as if nothing could happen.

3570
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:07,140
Mm-hmm.

3571
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:09,740
Oh my gosh.

3572
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:11,700
Short, hairy bloke.

3573
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,160
Thank you so much for talking after.

3574
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:13,820
Thank you!

3575
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:15,800
Why don't you just sleep outside?

3576
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:17,180
Well, there's an idea.

3577
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:18,740
Why didn't I think of that?

3578
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:20,860
But where would I sleep?

3579
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:22,880
I need some place to sleep.

3580
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:24,260
Anywhere in the world is your oyster.

3581
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:27,540
I've seen some people sleeping out on the street, but they huddle too close to the walls.

3582
02:39:27,540 --> 02:39:29,320
I need some place safe.

3583
02:39:29,580 --> 02:39:31,120
I can't just sleep anywhere.

3584
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:35,240
There are walls and statues and all sorts of things that can fall on me.

3585
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:36,480
Can't have that.

3586
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,680
Oh, he's afraid of the wall falling on him.

3587
02:39:38,680 --> 02:39:43,460
But if you find me a good place to sleep, a safe place outside, I'll reward you.

3588
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:44,180
Okay.

3589
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:46,160
Sleep outside.

3590
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:47,440
Oh, don't tease me.

3591
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:48,600
It's serious.

3592
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:49,780
I could die.

3593
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:51,160
We all could die.

3594
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:56,340
Please, help find a safe spot outside to sleep where the walls won't come crashing down.

3595
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:56,840
Okay.

3596
02:39:57,960 --> 02:39:58,640
Got any remarks?

3597
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:01,500
Luma Grabonk at the missing pauldron is collecting that amber you find.

3598
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3599
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:03,080
Goodbye.

3600
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:03,840
Bye-bye.

3601
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:05,340
Is he gonna go crawling away?

3602
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:10,380
Even this guy's staring at him like, what the...

3603
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:13,760
I'm in bliss.

3604
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:15,560
This place is so pretty though.

3605
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:16,820
What?

3606
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:21,080
What is this?

3607
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:23,360
The missing pauldron.

3608
02:40:26,770 --> 02:40:28,510
This place is so pretty.

3609
02:40:29,270 --> 02:40:31,370
He's training his quads, books of bliss.

3610
02:40:31,370 --> 02:40:31,450
Yes.

3611
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:31,910
Oh.

3612
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:32,710
Hello.

3613
02:40:33,070 --> 02:40:33,690
Who are you?

3614
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:34,930
Yes.

3615
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:36,390
Hi.

3616
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:38,490
Sleep outside.

3617
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:39,790
Wait, do you also want to sleep outside?

3618
02:40:39,970 --> 02:40:41,250
Yes, I have an idea for you.

3619
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:43,050
But first, sweet roll for Fimian.

3620
02:40:43,330 --> 02:40:45,270
Sweet roll for Fimian.

3621
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:46,550
Idea for you.

3622
02:40:46,890 --> 02:40:47,870
Sweet roll!

3623
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:51,490
I don't have a sweet roll for you.

3624
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:52,730
No sweet roll for Fimian.

3625
02:40:52,970 --> 02:40:54,110
No answer to problem.

3626
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:54,930
Hmph.

3627
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:56,410
Sweet roll!

3628
02:40:57,470 --> 02:40:58,270
See you later.

3629
02:40:58,610 --> 02:40:58,990
Bye.

3630
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:04,580
Bye.

3631
02:41:04,580 --> 02:41:04,820
Wow.

3632
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:08,980
Sweet roll!

3633
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:11,520
I also heard Fimian.

3634
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:14,660
Where is she?

3635
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:16,980
She's in here, right?

3636
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:18,980
We're in the right place?

3637
02:41:20,180 --> 02:41:21,840
We will find her.

3638
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:23,180
My sweet.

3639
02:41:24,020 --> 02:41:25,260
Sweet roll!

3640
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:33,600
No, it's too close to the walls.

3641
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:38,780
Speak quickly, mortal.

3642
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:40,500
The choosy beggar.

3643
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:43,780
Rendell's house.

3644
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:45,520
This is a village near.

3645
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:48,940
The J in the word Jester written on the map.

3646
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:50,040
Oh my gosh.

3647
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:50,620
Palm putt.

3648
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:51,140
Thank you.

3649
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:52,640
Ah!

3650
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:53,580
Okay.

3651
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:55,460
We just gotta go through bliss.

3652
02:41:55,640 --> 02:41:55,720
Okay.

3653
02:41:56,320 --> 02:41:57,000
Thank you!

3654
02:41:57,620 --> 02:41:58,540
Let's go find her.

3655
02:41:58,540 --> 02:41:59,680
I was gonna say...

3656
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:01,540
I remember from the screenshot...

3657
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:01,840
Or not sorry.

3658
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:02,560
Hi.

3659
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:02,700
Hi.

3660
02:42:02,980 --> 02:42:05,920
I remember it looked a little more...

3661
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:06,920
Like...

3662
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:08,020
A little less city.

3663
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:12,640
Sweet roll!

3664
02:42:18,130 --> 02:42:18,690
Hi.

3665
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:19,690
Hi.

3666
02:42:19,950 --> 02:42:20,410
You look not...

3667
02:42:20,410 --> 02:42:20,510
Wait.

3668
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:21,830
Have you caught my act yet?

3669
02:42:22,130 --> 02:42:23,770
I'm fatal, the juggler.

3670
02:42:23,930 --> 02:42:25,490
I'm sure you've heard of me.

3671
02:42:25,630 --> 02:42:26,370
I haven't.

3672
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:27,710
Oh, who am I kidding?

3673
02:42:28,030 --> 02:42:28,370
Oh.

3674
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:32,610
More likely you came to scoff at the worst juggler in the world.

3675
02:42:32,690 --> 02:42:33,130
I didn't say...

3676
02:42:33,130 --> 02:42:33,990
Those are your words.

3677
02:42:34,810 --> 02:42:34,870
Oh.

3678
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:38,110
Heretics are misguided worshippers of Arden Sue.

3679
02:42:39,310 --> 02:42:39,730
Okay.

3680
02:42:40,190 --> 02:42:40,510
Goodbye.

3681
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:43,410
Hi.

3682
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:45,070
I...

3683
02:42:46,030 --> 02:42:48,390
I'm sure you're a great juggler, man.

3684
02:42:50,510 --> 02:42:52,210
I see something over there.

3685
02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:53,990
Are there spiders...

3686
02:42:53,990 --> 02:42:55,130
Oh my god!

3687
02:42:55,210 --> 02:42:56,590
He's just standing there!

3688
02:42:59,230 --> 02:43:02,190
Okay, so this area has the same type of monsters.

3689
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:03,070
Got it.

3690
02:43:16,070 --> 02:43:16,630
Haha!

3691
02:43:21,570 --> 02:43:22,670
How many steps?

3692
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:23,490
Oh, not so bad.

3693
02:43:27,180 --> 02:43:29,480
This place is quite orange, isn't it?

3694
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:29,860
Wow.

3695
02:43:36,930 --> 02:43:38,010
Good morning.

3696
02:43:40,170 --> 02:43:40,710
Okay.

3697
02:43:41,170 --> 02:43:42,390
It does kind of wind a bit.

3698
02:43:42,610 --> 02:43:43,130
That's fine.

3699
02:43:44,290 --> 02:43:45,110
We're fine.

3700
02:43:45,230 --> 02:43:45,930
Everything's fine.

3701
02:43:46,390 --> 02:43:47,290
What is this?

3702
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:47,950
Uh-oh.

3703
02:43:49,810 --> 02:43:51,850
I sneak in case...

3704
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:53,710
There's some...

3705
02:43:55,950 --> 02:43:56,910
Manner of...

3706
02:43:56,910 --> 02:43:57,550
Whoa!

3707
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:02,500
Oh my god.

3708
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:03,680
He's still standing there.

3709
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:09,220
I like seeing the city from outside and stuff.

3710
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:11,040
Okay.

3711
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:12,840
I thought this might be a guy who's...

3712
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:14,880
You know, at the camp, you know.

3713
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:21,380
I feel like I'm in the jungles of Russia.

3714
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,080
Can I shoot him?

3715
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:26,720
Of course I could.

3716
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:30,680
Not gonna waste my time with him though.

3717
02:44:31,740 --> 02:44:34,120
He would chase me all the way to the village.

3718
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:44,540
These trees are quite quirky.

3719
02:44:50,230 --> 02:44:50,830
Wow.

3720
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:02,240
Shoot.

3721
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:05,500
No!

3722
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:07,740
Showing your face was the last mistake...

3723
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:08,400
Oh my god.

3724
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:10,680
No, why you...

3725
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:11,240
No!

3726
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:13,480
No, please!

3727
02:45:22,630 --> 02:45:23,550
Oh my gosh.

3728
02:45:24,110 --> 02:45:24,930
Please die.

3729
02:45:26,130 --> 02:45:26,990
No, I...

3730
02:45:26,990 --> 02:45:28,350
I am of you, yeah.

3731
02:45:28,590 --> 02:45:29,430
Let's get this over with.

3732
02:45:29,770 --> 02:45:30,190
Take that!

3733
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:43,500
I didn't think he'd be so beefy!

3734
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:46,800
Oh my god, he keeps healing.

3735
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:51,920
Holy cow!

3736
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:56,480
Give me all my stuff back.

3737
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:01,080
Holy cow!

3738
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:04,880
I didn't think he was gonna go so hard on me.

3739
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:09,700
My arrow.

3740
02:46:16,130 --> 02:46:16,890
Yuck.

3741
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:18,310
Yuck.

3742
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:18,730
Yuck city.

3743
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:27,320
Oh, I...

3744
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:28,560
Yeah, I was so panicked.

3745
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:30,680
I forgot that I was in third person, if you want.

3746
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:33,880
Or rather, like, you know, I forgot to switch to first person.

3747
02:46:39,050 --> 02:46:40,870
I see something down there.

3748
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:44,450
Is that perhaps...

3749
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:45,670
A little...

3750
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:47,050
Okay, we'll just keep going on the path.

3751
02:46:50,310 --> 02:46:50,690
Purple.

3752
02:46:50,690 --> 02:46:50,850
Purple.

3753
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:56,620
On the road again.

3754
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:01,520
I can't wait to be on the road again.

3755
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:06,840
I'll get back into...

3756
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:07,600
Here we go.

3757
02:47:13,060 --> 02:47:14,000
Oh shoot.

3758
02:47:16,660 --> 02:47:17,640
There we go.

3759
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:20,080
Easy.

3760
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:24,970
No worries here.

3761
02:47:26,250 --> 02:47:27,410
This guy is ugly.

3762
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:32,270
Hello, Minto.

3763
02:47:32,270 --> 02:47:32,830
Hope you're good.

3764
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:34,050
I'm great, Jim.

3765
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:34,710
Thank you.

3766
02:47:36,830 --> 02:47:38,610
Thanks so much for 15 months.

3767
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:39,530
Thank you!

3768
02:47:40,030 --> 02:47:40,470
Welcome back.

3769
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:42,070
Alright.

3770
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:43,930
What's up there though, you know?

3771
02:47:44,370 --> 02:47:45,710
There's so much to explore.

3772
02:47:45,930 --> 02:47:47,330
Gosh, I love exploring in games.

3773
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:50,090
It's like my favorite thing to do in Minecraft, you know?

3774
02:47:50,210 --> 02:47:50,990
Is just...

3775
02:47:50,990 --> 02:47:52,030
Explore.

3776
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:53,410
And look.

3777
02:47:53,770 --> 02:47:54,530
And see.

3778
02:47:56,950 --> 02:47:57,970
What is...

3779
02:47:57,970 --> 02:47:59,550
Oh, it's a big ol' body.

3780
02:48:02,250 --> 02:48:04,550
My athletics has increased...

3781
02:48:04,550 --> 02:48:04,850
Oh!

3782
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:05,750
Tina, please!

3783
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:09,390
What's this?

3784
02:48:09,970 --> 02:48:11,510
Aster Bloom Core.

3785
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:13,970
Will these make me crazy?

3786
02:48:14,750 --> 02:48:15,270
Wow!

3787
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:16,190
Wow!

3788
02:48:16,990 --> 02:48:17,830
Oh my gosh.

3789
02:48:17,830 --> 02:48:19,650
I can probably see my house from here.

3790
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:25,010
I thought this would be a landmark.

3791
02:48:25,330 --> 02:48:26,010
But I guess not.

3792
02:48:35,090 --> 02:48:35,610
Nasty!

3793
02:48:39,370 --> 02:48:40,270
So cool.

3794
02:48:43,970 --> 02:48:45,390
I won't kill the dog.

3795
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:46,510
We're not going over there.

3796
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:51,720
Wait.

3797
02:48:53,540 --> 02:48:54,600
I will shoot.

3798
02:48:54,600 --> 02:48:54,680
I will shoot.

3799
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:55,900
The crab though.

3800
02:48:59,380 --> 02:48:59,900
Oh.

3801
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:02,100
He moved slower then.

3802
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:07,080
I'm bad.

3803
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:10,180
I don't think it reaches.

3804
02:49:19,060 --> 02:49:20,720
I played this game in middle school.

3805
02:49:21,020 --> 02:49:22,560
I fast traveled everywhere to beat the game.

3806
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:24,260
Now I take my time and explore each part.

3807
02:49:24,460 --> 02:49:25,000
So much fun.

3808
02:49:25,240 --> 02:49:25,460
Yeah!

3809
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:30,500
I mean, obviously it's nice to like, just get through it.

3810
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:32,620
Oh my gosh.

3811
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:34,140
You guys scared me.

3812
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:36,000
Speak quickly, mortal.

3813
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:36,760
Hello.

3814
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:40,500
Is that a tree, ma'am?

3815
02:49:50,250 --> 02:49:51,350
Those things are weak.

3816
02:49:58,040 --> 02:49:58,480
Okay.

3817
02:49:58,640 --> 02:49:58,680
Okay.

3818
02:49:58,700 --> 02:49:58,920
He's fine.

3819
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:00,300
Don't, don't leave yet.

3820
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:02,580
No, I didn't want your bark.

3821
02:50:03,820 --> 02:50:08,660
I think, I think maybe down there.

3822
02:50:08,820 --> 02:50:11,000
I think we can probably actually just go down.

3823
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:17,260
Oh.

3824
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:18,280
Oh.

3825
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:19,080
Oh.

3826
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:21,280
Oh.

3827
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:21,560
Oh.

3828
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:21,620
Oh.

3829
02:50:26,710 --> 02:50:27,650
Oh my gosh.

3830
02:50:27,770 --> 02:50:28,930
Are you kidding me right now?

3831
02:50:29,430 --> 02:50:30,210
No, please.

3832
02:50:31,690 --> 02:50:32,170
Oh,

3833
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:41,020
please.

3834
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:42,760
Oh my gosh.

3835
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:43,300
Stop healing.

3836
02:50:44,060 --> 02:50:44,380
Stop.

3837
02:50:44,580 --> 02:50:45,180
Oh, I got him.

3838
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:49,660
You bastard.

3839
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:55,740
What did you think a bandit camp was?

3840
02:50:55,900 --> 02:50:57,620
I saw frenzied camp.

3841
02:50:59,740 --> 02:51:00,820
Worm head.

3842
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:00,840
Worm head.

3843
02:51:08,170 --> 02:51:09,210
Name of the village.

3844
02:51:12,330 --> 02:51:13,890
I thought we were here.

3845
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:25,700
Go, Etina, go.

3846
02:51:26,660 --> 02:51:28,060
Just run for it.

3847
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,960
This is where we belong.

3848
02:51:30,800 --> 02:51:31,340
Here.

3849
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:36,180
Do I spy with my minky eyes?

3850
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:37,640
A lady?

3851
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,440
Yes, what is it?

3852
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:40,960
Yes.

3853
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:43,480
Ah, a stranger in town.

3854
02:51:44,060 --> 02:51:49,400
But as I always say, a stranger is just a friend I haven't met yet.

3855
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:53,180
Hey, friend, do you think you could help me out?

3856
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:53,540
Yeah.

3857
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:55,960
I'm caught a bit short at the moment.

3858
02:51:56,200 --> 02:51:58,440
Anything at all would be much appreciated.

3859
02:51:58,520 --> 02:51:59,080
Yes, yes.

3860
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:02,720
Get lost.

3861
02:52:03,480 --> 02:52:04,720
I'll say have a coin.

3862
02:52:04,840 --> 02:52:05,160
There you go.

3863
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:06,000
Thanks.

3864
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,120
Thanks a lot.

3865
02:52:09,080 --> 02:52:14,020
If you want to get close to the heretics, try putting on their robes.

3866
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:14,780
Wait, does that work?

3867
02:52:15,080 --> 02:52:16,800
I thought it would maybe work.

3868
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:17,220
Bye.

3869
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:21,620
Are you gonna keep running?

3870
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:27,580
Oh.

3871
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:28,600
Do you have any shoes?

3872
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:29,320
No.

3873
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:33,300
Merely offered me some shoes if I ran an errand for her research.

3874
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:34,560
I just ran instead.

3875
02:52:34,960 --> 02:52:36,300
Say, do you have any shoes?

3876
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:38,100
No, no shoes.

3877
02:52:38,620 --> 02:52:40,060
But how about a bath?

3878
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:41,760
You really should take a bath.

3879
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:46,140
You shouldn't run any errands for Merely until you take a bath.

3880
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:50,080
Oh, these holes in my shoes are killing me.

3881
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:51,000
Wait, is that a bad person?

3882
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:51,460
Well, gotta run.

3883
02:53:13,440 --> 02:53:15,540
You have those shoes.

3884
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:16,020
Well, gotta run.

3885
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:17,340
Hi.

3886
02:53:17,800 --> 02:53:18,220
Hi.

3887
02:53:19,380 --> 02:53:20,240
There she goes.

3888
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:21,880
Wait, that person's gone.

3889
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:23,640
Oh, are they a heretic?

3890
02:53:23,820 --> 02:53:24,400
I can't tell.

3891
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:29,940
Maybe not, because they don't have the hood on.

3892
02:53:32,860 --> 02:53:34,580
I don't have time to talk.

3893
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:36,340
My work cannot wait.

3894
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:37,040
What are you doing?

3895
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:40,200
You're new here, so I'll try to be patient with you.

3896
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:49,440
I am compiling a taxonomy of every living thing in the Shivering Isles, the weather, changes in the moon and stars, and their interrelationships.

3897
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:49,960
Wow.

3898
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:51,920
I must not be interrupted.

3899
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:56,020
My work requires the highest degree of concentration.

3900
02:53:56,380 --> 02:53:57,520
How do I get her to say the line?

3901
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:59,420
I hope I won't have to repeat myself.

3902
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:02,180
Fascinating.

3903
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:03,080
Tell me more.

3904
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:05,900
I have no time for idle chatter with dilettantes.

3905
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:11,420
When I'm finished with the Encyclopedia Shaothia, you may study it to your heart's content.

3906
02:54:11,820 --> 02:54:12,640
You got any shoes?

3907
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:14,280
Bye.

3908
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:15,540
What?

3909
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:19,660
Hey, got any apples or carrots?

3910
02:54:20,020 --> 02:54:22,520
Anything at all crunchy and yummy to eat?

3911
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:29,200
Suddenly, suddenly, the camera angle feels so intimate.

3912
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:30,680
Like, I feel so close to her.

3913
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:32,860
Get lost!

3914
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:33,260
What?

3915
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,040
What did you say?

3916
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:34,980
What did you say?

3917
02:54:53,560 --> 02:54:54,960
Neneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneeneene

3918
02:55:07,140 --> 02:55:09,280
I'm crying, I'm so happy!

3919
02:55:11,420 --> 02:55:12,780
Oh my god!

3920
02:55:15,220 --> 02:55:17,500
Wait, I wanna go inside her house.

3921
02:55:17,940 --> 02:55:18,820
She won't notice.

3922
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:22,840
We did it!

3923
02:55:22,980 --> 02:55:27,500
My reason for playing Oblivion was just for that!

3924
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:33,360
After all this time... Finally!

3925
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:37,880
I heard it with my own ears and my own... With... With...

3926
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:41,920
With E-Tina on my side!

3927
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:46,780
That's a screaming maw.

3928
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:48,580
Wait, I can sleep in her bed.

3929
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:50,440
You think she'll mind?

3930
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:53,160
Aww...

3931
02:55:54,530 --> 02:55:55,550
No!

3932
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:06,600
She's got a nice little balcony...

3933
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:08,800
With a great view!

3934
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:09,460
Wow!

3935
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:11,880
Wow!

3936
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:14,260
Miss runs in circles!

3937
02:56:14,660 --> 02:56:14,800
Oops!

3938
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:16,420
Ouch, sorry.

3939
02:56:18,060 --> 02:56:20,440
Hey, got any apples or carrots?

3940
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:22,960
Anything at all crunchy and yummy to eat?

3941
02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:23,600
We did it!

3942
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:26,000
Get lost!

3943
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:26,480
What?

3944
02:56:26,560 --> 02:56:27,240
What did you say?

3945
02:56:27,380 --> 02:56:28,180
What did you say?

3946
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:31,160
I注意 my feet.

3947
02:56:31,240 --> 02:56:34,260
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me!

3948
02:56:34,680 --> 02:56:38,060
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me!

3949
02:56:38,500 --> 02:56:41,320
Hey, got any apples or carrots?

3950
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:44,080
Anything at all crunchy and yummy to eat?

3951
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:46,340
What is this gorgeous angle?

3952
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:48,000
Oh my gosh, this is cinematic!

3953
02:56:49,380 --> 02:56:51,080
What the hell is this?

3954
02:56:53,920 --> 02:56:55,380
This is beautiful.

3955
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,920
She wants something crunchy to eat.

3956
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:00,640
Wow.

3957
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:04,140
And the way she's, like, looking at us.

3958
02:57:04,580 --> 02:57:05,880
This is crazy.

3959
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:07,480
It looks maxing.

3960
02:57:07,960 --> 02:57:09,300
Hold on, I need a screenshot.

3961
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:13,700
Wait, how do you screenshot on... with Steam again?

3962
02:57:13,720 --> 02:57:14,280
I don't remember.

3963
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:18,060
Yeah, is this a dating sim?

3964
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:22,640
F-12.

3965
02:57:23,740 --> 02:57:24,500
Wait, hold on.

3966
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,280
Let's get her to, like, kind of...

3967
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:32,520
There we go.

3968
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:33,800
And... Nope.

3969
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:34,760
Dang it, I missed it.

3970
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:35,460
Oh, dang it.

3971
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:38,000
Oh, here we go.

3972
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:39,660
Yes, Queen!

3973
02:57:40,180 --> 02:57:40,480
Yes!

3974
02:57:42,020 --> 02:57:44,980
Maybe the real dead Tootius was the Nene on the way.

3975
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:48,120
Dang.

3976
02:57:48,400 --> 02:57:49,000
Get lost!

3977
02:57:49,700 --> 02:57:50,040
What?

3978
02:57:50,040 --> 02:57:50,760
What did you say?

3979
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:51,700
What did you say?

3980
02:58:09,080 --> 02:58:10,620
I'm so happy!

3981
02:58:12,640 --> 02:58:13,540
Oh my god.

3982
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:22,600
I'm so happy!

3983
02:58:23,380 --> 02:58:24,840
She's judging me, watching me.

3984
02:58:27,800 --> 02:58:29,360
Is that him right there?

3985
02:58:29,980 --> 02:58:31,340
Why is he blended?

3986
02:58:32,040 --> 02:58:34,180
She's got...

3987
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:35,920
Whoa!

3988
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:37,520
He's invisible.

3989
02:58:48,920 --> 02:58:51,500
Oh, he's diseased, not deceased.

3990
02:58:54,300 --> 02:58:56,640
Did you see that?

3991
02:58:59,940 --> 02:59:01,420
Did you check that out?

3992
02:59:01,420 --> 02:59:02,460
Yes, what is it?

3993
02:59:02,680 --> 02:59:03,080
Nothing.

3994
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:08,760
Guys, I actually, though, have to use the little ghostie's room.

3995
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:10,800
So, give me a moment...

3996
02:59:11,340 --> 02:59:12,860
Wait, why is it...

3997
02:59:12,860 --> 02:59:14,360
Why is the lock hard?

3998
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:17,540
Why?

3999
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:24,440
I gotta use the little ghostie's room.

4000
02:59:24,900 --> 02:59:25,400
Get through you!

4001
02:59:25,700 --> 02:59:26,480
Thank you so much for the 5.

4002
02:59:27,220 --> 02:59:28,720
I'll be right back.

4003
02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:32,560
I'll just let you chill with her for now.

4004
02:59:41,270 --> 02:59:41,770
Biori.

4005
03:00:20,530 --> 03:00:23,270
Hey, got any apples or carrots?

4006
03:00:23,470 --> 03:00:26,110
Anything at all crunchy and yummy to eat?

4007
03:01:29,610 --> 03:01:31,790
Hold on, I'm gonna go get more water, too.

4008
03:01:33,210 --> 03:01:34,050
I'm gonna get more water.

4009
03:01:34,310 --> 03:01:34,950
Wait, what happened?

4010
03:01:35,610 --> 03:01:36,610
Did she come up to me?

4011
03:01:37,670 --> 03:01:38,470
You lost.

4012
03:01:38,770 --> 03:01:40,010
Wh-what did you say?

4013
03:01:40,310 --> 03:01:40,930
Wh-what did you say?

4014
03:02:28,990 --> 03:02:29,430
Okay.

4015
03:02:29,790 --> 03:02:29,890
Okay.

4016
03:02:29,890 --> 03:02:30,510
So sorry about that.

4017
03:02:30,690 --> 03:02:31,530
So sorry about that.

4018
03:02:32,130 --> 03:02:35,990
I, I, feel so satisfied with that.

4019
03:02:36,170 --> 03:02:47,050
I'm not gonna lie, that, ouch, I kind of want to just, Just... I kinda wanna just... Welcome back, thank you!

4020
03:02:47,710 --> 03:02:56,830
Kinda wanna just... Um... Not end it, obviously, but I wanna... I wanna go kill those guys.

4021
03:02:57,390 --> 03:03:00,490
Fulfill Glarthur, our first ever big quest.

4022
03:03:01,030 --> 03:03:02,070
I say big.

4023
03:03:02,470 --> 03:03:04,890
Our quest that has taken us so long.

4024
03:03:06,350 --> 03:03:07,630
And call it.

4025
03:03:10,650 --> 03:03:11,610
Where is she?

4026
03:03:11,850 --> 03:03:12,590
I saw you.

4027
03:03:12,590 --> 03:03:13,810
My queen!

4028
03:03:14,850 --> 03:03:15,950
Runs in circles!

4029
03:03:18,230 --> 03:03:20,070
Tell her sorry once, please.

4030
03:03:20,330 --> 03:03:20,470
Okay.

4031
03:03:21,150 --> 03:03:21,370
What?

4032
03:03:22,210 --> 03:03:24,530
My feet hurt so bad.

4033
03:03:24,930 --> 03:03:27,470
I could sure use a new pair of shoes.

4034
03:03:28,010 --> 03:03:28,810
Can you help me out?

4035
03:03:28,910 --> 03:03:29,470
Please?

4036
03:03:29,990 --> 03:03:31,070
How does she talk like that?

4037
03:03:31,210 --> 03:03:33,170
My feet hurt so bad.

4038
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:34,750
How do you talk like that?

4039
03:03:35,230 --> 03:03:39,210
My... My... Feet hurt so bad.

4040
03:03:40,350 --> 03:03:41,150
Oh, no.

4041
03:03:41,310 --> 03:03:42,470
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

4042
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:42,990
No!

4043
03:03:43,150 --> 03:03:58,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4044
03:03:59,770 --> 03:04:00,170
No!

4045
03:04:05,270 --> 03:04:06,210
All right.

4046
03:04:16,750 --> 03:04:18,290
Can I travel?

4047
03:04:18,470 --> 03:04:22,970
Okay, so we're gonna have to go to the to the door to Cyrodiil?

4048
03:04:25,990 --> 03:04:27,930
All the way back...

4049
03:04:36,970 --> 03:04:39,350
Why am I- why am I- why do I look like this?

4050
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:41,610
Why am I glowing?

4051
03:04:49,770 --> 03:04:50,210
I'm

4052
03:04:56,380 --> 03:04:57,100
fine, I'm fine!

4053
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:05,680
What's wrong?

4054
03:05:09,760 --> 03:05:12,960
Oh, see?

4055
03:05:14,300 --> 03:05:15,600
Is it because of my buff?

4056
03:05:16,340 --> 03:05:17,440
Is it because I'm buffed?

4057
03:05:18,080 --> 03:05:19,260
The ring I'm wearing, maybe?

4058
03:05:20,440 --> 03:05:21,680
I've got like this...

4059
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:21,740
Oh!

4060
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:22,300
Whoa!

4061
03:05:24,620 --> 03:05:25,140
Ichida!

4062
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:28,200
Oh, okay, you're fine.

4063
03:05:37,390 --> 03:05:37,910
Um...

4064
03:05:37,910 --> 03:05:38,470
Whoa!

4065
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:39,310
Creepy!

4066
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:46,870
What's down here, anyway?

4067
03:05:49,930 --> 03:05:51,110
Oh, just the water.

4068
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:55,460
Whoa!

4069
03:05:56,400 --> 03:05:57,700
Before you go, it's my birthday!

4070
03:05:57,980 --> 03:05:58,140
Oh!

4071
03:05:58,360 --> 03:05:58,460
Oh!

4072
03:05:59,160 --> 03:05:59,300
Oh!

4073
03:05:59,580 --> 03:06:00,500
Can I get a happy birthday?

4074
03:06:01,400 --> 03:06:02,000
Of course!

4075
03:06:02,220 --> 03:06:03,400
Happy birthday, Hitman!

4076
03:06:05,320 --> 03:06:07,420
No, no, we still got a little bit more work to do.

4077
03:06:08,800 --> 03:06:10,340
Still have a little bit more to do.

4078
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:13,300
It was in Skingrad.

4079
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:15,200
But let me go back to my quest.

4080
03:06:15,360 --> 03:06:15,420
But let me go back to my quest.

4081
03:06:15,420 --> 03:06:15,680
We'll do it.

4082
03:06:15,800 --> 03:06:16,680
Go back to Paranoia.

4083
03:06:18,460 --> 03:06:18,820
Yes.

4084
03:06:24,230 --> 03:06:24,910
We will...

4085
03:06:24,910 --> 03:06:26,090
We will take care of this.

4086
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:32,840
I won't feel satisfied if we don't...

4087
03:06:32,840 --> 03:06:33,740
Unless we do, you know?

4088
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:37,720
Hurry up!

4089
03:06:45,410 --> 03:06:46,130
Glarthor!

4090
03:06:48,310 --> 03:06:49,030
Glarthor!

4091
03:06:49,130 --> 03:06:50,210
So hot!

4092
03:06:52,310 --> 03:06:53,630
It's 6am!

4093
03:06:58,260 --> 03:07:00,780
And then Tudius is over here, right?

4094
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:01,680
What is it?

4095
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:03,420
Uh...

4096
03:07:03,420 --> 03:07:04,200
Over this way?

4097
03:07:04,580 --> 03:07:05,440
This way?

4098
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:08,080
What is it?

4099
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:09,080
What is it?

4100
03:07:09,080 --> 03:07:10,240
Oh, excuse me.

4101
03:07:10,780 --> 03:07:12,080
I'm searching for, uh...

4102
03:07:14,360 --> 03:07:15,680
Mr. Sextius?

4103
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:18,560
Tudius Sextius?

4104
03:07:19,060 --> 03:07:21,320
Oh, I can get rid of...

4105
03:07:22,040 --> 03:07:22,660
Oh, wait!

4106
03:07:22,880 --> 03:07:23,440
Oh, no!

4107
03:07:23,560 --> 03:07:25,080
My other marker was from...

4108
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:27,080
Was...

4109
03:07:27,080 --> 03:07:27,700
From...

4110
03:07:27,700 --> 03:07:28,020
Here!

4111
03:07:28,140 --> 03:07:29,000
Oh, can I get rid of it?

4112
03:07:30,020 --> 03:07:30,620
Remove it.

4113
03:07:30,660 --> 03:07:30,940
There we go.

4114
03:07:31,040 --> 03:07:31,480
Okay, phew!

4115
03:07:34,060 --> 03:07:34,500
Tudius!

4116
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:36,440
Uh...

4117
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:36,940
Here!

4118
03:07:51,700 --> 03:07:54,140
Why does it say he's right here, but he's not?

4119
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:56,200
Maybe he's upstairs.

4120
03:08:00,860 --> 03:08:01,280
Okay.

4121
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:06,200
No way Minto is awake at 6am on a regular basis.

4122
03:08:06,360 --> 03:08:06,980
Ay, ay, ay!

4123
03:08:15,870 --> 03:08:16,810
Gosh, dang it.

4124
03:08:24,270 --> 03:08:25,630
Do I still have that, like...

4125
03:08:28,530 --> 03:08:28,950
Oh.

4126
03:08:30,670 --> 03:08:31,890
I don't know what I just...

4127
03:08:31,890 --> 03:08:33,750
What I just cast upon myself.

4128
03:08:37,790 --> 03:08:38,910
He doesn't know.

4129
03:08:41,230 --> 03:08:42,430
Equip my good arrows.

4130
03:08:42,630 --> 03:08:43,010
Oh, true.

4131
03:08:45,650 --> 03:08:46,750
True, true, true.

4132
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:51,720
Gatekeeper.

4133
03:09:00,400 --> 03:09:00,960
Hey!

4134
03:09:01,280 --> 03:09:01,940
Don't look this way!

4135
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:09,820
Get boned, Mr. Sextius.

4136
03:09:17,740 --> 03:09:18,060
Shoot.

4137
03:09:20,640 --> 03:09:21,120
Oh, no.

4138
03:09:29,900 --> 03:09:31,680
I have killed everyone on Glarthur's list!

4139
03:09:32,220 --> 03:09:33,180
Oh, when I have.

4140
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:34,160
Okay, I was about to say.

4141
03:09:34,400 --> 03:09:35,240
Um, no I didn't.

4142
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:37,540
Ah!

4143
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:38,700
Stop!

4144
03:09:39,220 --> 03:09:40,460
You violated the law!

4145
03:09:40,780 --> 03:09:43,080
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.

4146
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:45,740
Your stolen goods are now forfeit.

4147
03:09:47,920 --> 03:09:49,400
My bounty is...

4148
03:09:50,220 --> 03:09:51,240
1,000?

4149
03:09:52,040 --> 03:09:53,680
I could just go to jail.

4150
03:10:02,770 --> 03:10:03,530
Hmm...

4151
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:08,120
A, what?

4152
03:10:15,100 --> 03:10:15,480
Resist?

4153
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:16,240
Why?

4154
03:10:18,300 --> 03:10:20,880
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

4155
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:24,580
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

4156
03:10:24,580 --> 03:10:26,220
Pay half to the Thieves Guild.

4157
03:10:26,220 --> 03:10:27,740
I guess that's true.

4158
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:30,380
He's like...

4159
03:10:30,380 --> 03:10:33,280
He's like, very patiently waiting for us to make a decision.

4160
03:10:45,030 --> 03:10:46,570
Resist arrest, do it!

4161
03:10:46,950 --> 03:10:49,810
Let me... let me res... let me... let me...

4162
03:10:50,570 --> 03:10:51,770
Uh, what's the word?

4163
03:10:52,570 --> 03:10:54,770
I'll... I'll try again, I'll reload.

4164
03:11:01,600 --> 03:11:02,200
Loud!

4165
03:11:08,700 --> 03:11:09,440
Redoo!

4166
03:11:10,220 --> 03:11:11,880
Don't pay with your blood.

4167
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:13,340
Oh.

4168
03:11:18,370 --> 03:11:19,110
No!

4169
03:11:19,650 --> 03:11:20,770
What are you doing?

4170
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:26,240
Oh, he knows I'm here now.

4171
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:45,660
Do you have more gatekeeper arrows?

4172
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:46,220
Yeah.

4173
03:11:49,240 --> 03:11:50,680
That's what I used.

4174
03:11:52,360 --> 03:11:54,580
Paying your fine to resist arrest.

4175
03:11:54,580 --> 03:11:54,920
My turn.

4176
03:11:59,960 --> 03:12:00,820
Okay, hold on.

4177
03:12:03,620 --> 03:12:07,180
What we couldn't do before was the poison...

4178
03:12:07,780 --> 03:12:10,080
...was the poison apples because...

4179
03:12:10,980 --> 03:12:11,780
...they...

4180
03:12:13,840 --> 03:12:16,460
...they don't... they don't eat it.

4181
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:18,300
So...

4182
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:21,240
...what if I...

4183
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:22,160
...or do I have anything?

4184
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:28,080
Here, poison.

4185
03:12:40,380 --> 03:12:42,480
Poison for our arrows, yeah.

4186
03:12:43,720 --> 03:12:44,520
Uh...

4187
03:12:46,500 --> 03:12:47,300
Um...

4188
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:48,480
I have...

4189
03:12:50,600 --> 03:12:52,040
...aero of fatigue.

4190
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:56,680
Love the thumbnail, it's so cute.

4191
03:12:56,780 --> 03:12:57,280
Thanks!

4192
03:12:57,280 --> 03:12:57,400
Thanks!

4193
03:13:05,820 --> 03:13:06,180
Hmm...

4194
03:13:17,350 --> 03:13:17,710
Oblivion?

4195
03:13:17,810 --> 03:13:19,430
You can make NPCs...

4196
03:13:19,430 --> 03:13:21,810
...mad enough by intentionally failing the talking.

4197
03:13:21,930 --> 03:13:22,730
They attack you first.

4198
03:13:22,910 --> 03:13:24,590
Then you can kill them as a means of self-defense.

4199
03:13:26,490 --> 03:13:26,950
What?

4200
03:13:31,820 --> 03:13:32,740
No way!

4201
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:33,280
Really?

4202
03:13:33,820 --> 03:13:35,900
Only it works on some NPCs, not all.

4203
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:39,360
Should we try?

4204
03:13:39,900 --> 03:13:41,600
Hey, why not try at least?

4205
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:43,940
Oh...

4206
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:45,120
I did not mean to do that.

4207
03:13:45,240 --> 03:13:46,100
I don't know what I'm even...

4208
03:13:46,100 --> 03:13:47,980
I'm casting, like, healing on myself or something.

4209
03:13:49,580 --> 03:13:50,060
Hello!

4210
03:13:51,440 --> 03:13:52,580
Yeah, worth a shot, no?

4211
03:13:53,500 --> 03:13:56,260
Because there's, like, no way we're gonna one-shot this guy.

4212
03:14:09,560 --> 03:14:12,680
I won't fight you.

4213
03:14:14,500 --> 03:14:15,740
My life is...

4214
03:14:15,740 --> 03:14:16,780
What a dumb joke.

4215
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:18,380
Alright, now we know.

4216
03:14:19,960 --> 03:14:20,840
It's really...

4217
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:21,380
Oh gosh, okay.

4218
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:23,900
It's really hard to, like...

4219
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:25,880
...fail this, you know what I mean?

4220
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:27,360
Such adventures.

4221
03:14:27,660 --> 03:14:28,980
How I envy you.

4222
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:30,140
I want to...

4223
03:14:30,140 --> 03:14:33,100
I want to do it right.

4224
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:35,660
Hate me!

4225
03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:36,760
Hate me!

4226
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:39,220
I can't argue with...

4227
03:14:39,220 --> 03:14:40,560
Don't try to manipulate...

4228
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:41,580
What a dumb joke.

4229
03:14:41,980 --> 03:14:43,140
That's amazing.

4230
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:45,160
Not now.

4231
03:14:45,480 --> 03:14:46,420
You think that's funny?

4232
03:14:46,820 --> 03:14:47,640
Oh, shoot.

4233
03:14:48,580 --> 03:14:49,140
Dang it.

4234
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:51,680
That's amazing.

4235
03:14:52,040 --> 03:14:53,100
You've got a point.

4236
03:14:53,380 --> 03:14:54,680
I got back to 20!

4237
03:14:55,360 --> 03:14:56,540
What do you mean I have a point?

4238
03:14:56,540 --> 03:14:57,400
Oh my gosh.

4239
03:14:57,500 --> 03:14:59,100
I'm just, like, so popular.

4240
03:14:59,100 --> 03:15:00,960
My personality is too good.

4241
03:15:01,780 --> 03:15:02,260
What?

4242
03:15:05,100 --> 03:15:06,540
That's just not funny.

4243
03:15:07,860 --> 03:15:08,500
Oh, wait.

4244
03:15:08,540 --> 03:15:11,080
Also, if I just sit here, it also goes down, right?

4245
03:15:13,180 --> 03:15:13,740
Okay.

4246
03:15:13,740 --> 03:15:14,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4247
03:15:21,870 --> 03:15:22,430
Yup.

4248
03:15:23,010 --> 03:15:23,450
Yeah.

4249
03:15:26,350 --> 03:15:28,290
I have to do it eventually, though.

4250
03:15:29,850 --> 03:15:30,810
I salute you.

4251
03:15:31,390 --> 03:15:32,370
Most of you...

4252
03:15:32,370 --> 03:15:33,590
Don't talk such rot.

4253
03:15:33,730 --> 03:15:34,210
Okay, here we go.

4254
03:15:34,350 --> 03:15:34,610
Here we go.

4255
03:15:52,350 --> 03:15:53,530
Trying to figure out...

4256
03:15:55,090 --> 03:15:56,390
Yeah, he hates us.

4257
03:15:58,130 --> 03:15:59,330
Actually, can I just leave?

4258
03:15:59,650 --> 03:16:00,030
Oh, shoot.

4259
03:16:00,190 --> 03:16:00,570
I can't.

4260
03:16:04,470 --> 03:16:07,270
Do good ones wait, then bad ones.

4261
03:16:07,490 --> 03:16:07,690
Yeah.

4262
03:16:08,410 --> 03:16:08,550
Yeah.

4263
03:16:19,110 --> 03:16:21,090
Trying to figure out what I want to do.

4264
03:16:24,820 --> 03:16:28,220
It's so much more difficult doing the opposite.

4265
03:16:35,940 --> 03:16:37,360
Sorry, I don't get it.

4266
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:37,840
Okay.

4267
03:16:38,840 --> 03:16:39,560
All right, here we go.

4268
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,620
Okay, here we go.

4269
03:16:41,200 --> 03:16:42,580
Okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.

4270
03:16:42,980 --> 03:16:44,180
Can it get into the negative?

4271
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:51,930
We'll let it go down to zero and then see if it goes into the negative.

4272
03:16:54,130 --> 03:16:55,790
All right, Toadius Sextius.

4273
03:17:00,590 --> 03:17:01,230
You don't...

4274
03:17:01,230 --> 03:17:02,070
Oh, only zero?

4275
03:17:02,270 --> 03:17:04,890
Oh, see, here I was thinking that I could go into the negative.

4276
03:17:06,650 --> 03:17:07,710
Oh, okay.

4277
03:17:09,670 --> 03:17:10,190
And...

4278
03:17:15,930 --> 03:17:16,970
Zero!

4279
03:17:18,610 --> 03:17:20,410
Don't try to manipulate me.

4280
03:17:20,970 --> 03:17:21,930
Are you serious?

4281
03:17:23,030 --> 03:17:23,430
Oh.

4282
03:17:25,930 --> 03:17:26,870
Uh...

4283
03:17:26,870 --> 03:17:27,750
Just leave!

4284
03:17:28,910 --> 03:17:29,430
Dang.

4285
03:17:30,410 --> 03:17:32,530
He has too much...

4286
03:17:33,670 --> 03:17:34,790
He's too...

4287
03:17:34,790 --> 03:17:35,510
What's the word?

4288
03:17:38,350 --> 03:17:39,690
He's too...

4289
03:17:39,690 --> 03:17:40,070
He's too...

4290
03:17:40,070 --> 03:17:40,670
Civilized.

4291
03:17:46,010 --> 03:17:47,470
He's too civilized.

4292
03:17:47,490 --> 03:17:47,870
What do you bother me?

4293
03:17:48,070 --> 03:17:48,830
Go away.

4294
03:17:49,010 --> 03:17:49,530
I'm waiting.

4295
03:17:50,190 --> 03:17:50,670
I'm waiting.

4296
03:17:52,470 --> 03:17:54,150
Say what you're going to say.

4297
03:17:55,410 --> 03:17:56,130
Okay.

4298
03:17:58,570 --> 03:18:00,290
I won't fight you.

4299
03:18:00,430 --> 03:18:01,130
I salute you.

4300
03:18:01,470 --> 03:18:02,390
Most impressive.

4301
03:18:02,390 --> 03:18:02,650
I salute you.

4302
03:18:03,690 --> 03:18:05,310
Not the fighting type.

4303
03:18:06,730 --> 03:18:07,670
Yeah.

4304
03:18:08,790 --> 03:18:10,270
That's just stupid.

4305
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:19,590
Nineteen.

4306
03:18:21,030 --> 03:18:21,970
Nineteen.

4307
03:18:26,610 --> 03:18:27,010
Eighteen.

4308
03:18:27,010 --> 03:18:27,070
Eighteen.

4309
03:18:33,110 --> 03:18:33,910
What was I at?

4310
03:18:35,010 --> 03:18:35,410
Seventeen.

4311
03:18:42,490 --> 03:18:43,330
I missed it.

4312
03:18:43,350 --> 03:18:44,490
Why do you want him to hate you?

4313
03:18:44,810 --> 03:18:47,770
Because maybe if he hates us, he might attack us.

4314
03:18:47,770 --> 03:18:49,590
And then I can kill him in self-defense.

4315
03:18:53,030 --> 03:18:53,510
Uh...

4316
03:18:54,950 --> 03:18:55,430
Thirteen!

4317
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:05,040
Twelve!

4318
03:19:07,980 --> 03:19:09,200
None none none man!

4319
03:19:18,230 --> 03:19:18,270
Uuuef!

4320
03:19:18,270 --> 03:19:18,270
No!

4321
03:19:18,270 --> 03:19:18,550
Okay.

4322
03:19:18,770 --> 03:19:19,590
Not now...

4323
03:19:19,590 --> 03:19:20,410
Not later!

4324
03:19:20,810 --> 03:19:21,530
Not ever.

4325
03:19:21,990 --> 03:19:23,370
I'm not impressed.

4326
03:19:24,010 --> 03:19:24,730
He hates me.

4327
03:19:26,430 --> 03:19:27,790
Just leave!

4328
03:19:28,070 --> 03:19:28,530
Attack me!

4329
03:19:28,850 --> 03:19:29,750
Attack me!

4330
03:19:30,090 --> 03:19:31,190
Attack me!

4331
03:19:31,750 --> 03:19:32,530
Attack me!

4332
03:19:33,250 --> 03:19:34,910
Attack me!

4333
03:19:35,950 --> 03:19:37,070
Make it quick.

4334
03:19:37,910 --> 03:19:39,510
You know you want to.

4335
03:19:40,570 --> 03:19:44,090
They say there are a bunch of people holed up in Summit Mist Manor.

4336
03:19:44,490 --> 03:19:45,250
Locked in.

4337
03:19:45,450 --> 03:19:47,590
Some kind of weird party or something.

4338
03:19:48,430 --> 03:19:49,810
A sex party?

4339
03:19:49,910 --> 03:19:50,270
Stop talking.

4340
03:19:50,410 --> 03:19:50,590
Enough.

4341
03:19:56,820 --> 03:19:58,720
I'm looking through your things.

4342
03:20:00,080 --> 03:20:01,600
I'm looking through your stuff.

4343
03:20:04,300 --> 03:20:05,900
I don't know, guys.

4344
03:20:07,500 --> 03:20:08,740
I don't know, guys.

4345
03:20:19,660 --> 03:20:21,020
Hey, come on now.

4346
03:20:21,260 --> 03:20:22,480
There's no need to get fired.

4347
03:20:23,640 --> 03:20:24,520
I give up.

4348
03:20:25,220 --> 03:20:25,920
Don't give up.

4349
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:26,540
Don't leave.

4350
03:20:27,240 --> 03:20:27,820
Don't leave.

4351
03:20:27,900 --> 03:20:28,120
Don't leave.

4352
03:20:28,200 --> 03:20:28,440
Don't leave.

4353
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:29,540
I need to get you.

4354
03:20:30,220 --> 03:20:30,620
Shoot.

4355
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:30,860
Shoot.

4356
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:31,040
Shoot.

4357
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:31,120
Shoot.

4358
03:20:31,360 --> 03:20:31,740
No, no.

4359
03:20:31,820 --> 03:20:32,000
Please.

4360
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:32,200
Please.

4361
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:33,240
Shoot.

4362
03:20:34,640 --> 03:20:35,440
I got him.

4363
03:20:47,030 --> 03:20:47,470
Stop!

4364
03:20:47,910 --> 03:20:49,210
You violated the law.

4365
03:20:49,590 --> 03:20:51,850
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.

4366
03:20:52,230 --> 03:20:54,490
Your stolen goods are now forfeit.

4367
03:21:13,420 --> 03:21:16,000
You have the high ground if you don't.

4368
03:21:20,210 --> 03:21:21,650
Then pay with your blood.

4369
03:21:22,590 --> 03:21:23,090
Oh.

4370
03:21:23,350 --> 03:21:23,690
Oh.

4371
03:21:24,950 --> 03:21:25,850
Oh, God.

4372
03:21:40,110 --> 03:21:41,110
I'm innocent.

4373
03:21:42,350 --> 03:21:43,270
I'm innocent.

4374
03:21:44,190 --> 03:21:45,050
I'm innocent.

4375
03:21:54,390 --> 03:21:55,750
I'm innocent.

4376
03:21:55,750 --> 03:21:56,050
City.

4377
03:22:01,550 --> 03:22:02,150
Okay.

4378
03:22:02,570 --> 03:22:03,490
Now we go back.

4379
03:22:08,550 --> 03:22:09,150
Okay.

4380
03:22:11,670 --> 03:22:12,670
Run, run, run.

4381
03:22:18,630 --> 03:22:20,030
Now we go here.

4382
03:22:21,890 --> 03:22:24,230
You cannot fast travel with enemies nearby.

4383
03:22:24,530 --> 03:22:24,870
Oh, shoot.

4384
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:30,600
How far do I need to get?

4385
03:22:32,360 --> 03:22:33,640
Oh my gosh, my legs.

4386
03:22:33,640 --> 03:22:34,780
A lark.

4387
03:22:35,160 --> 03:22:35,820
Okay, we're fine.

4388
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:36,620
Everything's good.

4389
03:22:37,220 --> 03:22:38,600
He's not close.

4390
03:22:42,380 --> 03:22:42,940
What?

4391
03:22:44,820 --> 03:22:46,320
There's still enemies nearby?

4392
03:22:53,550 --> 03:22:54,850
Is he always there?

4393
03:23:00,110 --> 03:23:02,550
Okay, surely... That's a dog.

4394
03:23:03,030 --> 03:23:03,170
Shoot.

4395
03:23:03,930 --> 03:23:04,670
Oh, dang it.

4396
03:23:04,770 --> 03:23:05,090
Come on.

4397
03:23:05,190 --> 03:23:05,870
You're not the enemy.

4398
03:23:06,010 --> 03:23:06,430
I need it.

4399
03:23:06,670 --> 03:23:07,170
Please.

4400
03:23:07,910 --> 03:23:08,350
Dog.

4401
03:23:09,650 --> 03:23:10,210
Run.

4402
03:23:10,530 --> 03:23:10,630
Run.

4403
03:23:10,770 --> 03:23:10,990
Run.

4404
03:23:11,410 --> 03:23:11,550
Run.

4405
03:23:11,550 --> 03:23:11,830
Run.

4406
03:23:15,980 --> 03:23:17,080
I hear a horse.

4407
03:23:24,180 --> 03:23:25,300
The good arrows.

4408
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:26,360
Oh my gosh, you're right.

4409
03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:27,780
My good arrows.

4410
03:23:31,400 --> 03:23:33,340
Guys, will I ever be free?

4411
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:38,900
This was a bad idea, huh?

4412
03:23:39,900 --> 03:23:41,540
Why didn't I listen to you guys?

4413
03:23:41,540 --> 03:23:44,820
Guys, I'm free.

4414
03:23:46,320 --> 03:23:47,100
For now.

4415
03:23:50,040 --> 03:23:51,240
No, not the stables.

4416
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:53,120
Yes, the district.

4417
03:23:53,460 --> 03:23:53,640
Okay.

4418
03:23:55,460 --> 03:23:57,620
All I need to do is pay off my fine, right?

4419
03:24:02,010 --> 03:24:03,870
Stop right there, criminal scum.

4420
03:24:04,110 --> 03:24:06,250
Nobody breaks the law on my watch.

4421
03:24:06,510 --> 03:24:08,610
I'm confiscating your stolen goods.

4422
03:24:08,810 --> 03:24:11,450
Now pay your fine, or it's off to jail.

4423
03:24:25,520 --> 03:24:28,040
I think I just have to pay the gold, you guys.

4424
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:31,960
I think I have, I have, what?

4425
03:24:32,240 --> 03:24:32,680
1400?

4426
03:24:33,240 --> 03:24:33,960
I just got paid.

4427
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:39,300
We'll make the money back from Glarthur.

4428
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:49,940
I don't think I had any stolen goods, though.

4429
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:54,140
You'll never truly be free because you love hijinks too much.

4430
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:55,240
Guilty.

4431
03:25:00,190 --> 03:25:02,310
Have you tried killing him with a dagger yet?

4432
03:25:02,490 --> 03:25:02,670
Yup.

4433
03:25:03,030 --> 03:25:05,410
I've tried so many things to try and kill these guys.

4434
03:25:07,710 --> 03:25:08,490
I have.

4435
03:25:12,650 --> 03:25:14,550
I sold all my stolen goods, though.

4436
03:25:16,610 --> 03:25:17,390
Yeah, okay.

4437
03:25:18,170 --> 03:25:19,170
That's too bad.

4438
03:25:19,490 --> 03:25:21,990
I was hoping you'd resist arrest.

4439
03:25:22,750 --> 03:25:24,990
Okay, here's the procedure.

4440
03:25:25,350 --> 03:25:26,070
I don't have any.

4441
03:25:26,230 --> 03:25:27,650
I don't have any stolen goods.

4442
03:25:28,050 --> 03:25:30,310
I think I sold all of them already.

4443
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:35,520
Speak.

4444
03:25:35,900 --> 03:25:36,400
Nothing.

4445
03:25:36,660 --> 03:25:37,920
I got nothing to say to you.

4446
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:39,160
All right, back to...

4447
03:25:40,860 --> 03:25:42,020
Back to Skingrad.

4448
03:25:47,540 --> 03:25:50,100
We have just one more person to kill.

4449
03:25:52,620 --> 03:25:54,960
Poison food does not work, unfortunately.

4450
03:25:58,060 --> 03:26:00,220
Loading in slowly but surely.

4451
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:04,940
We killed one guy.

4452
03:26:05,220 --> 03:26:07,260
Arguably, I think he was the easier one.

4453
03:26:09,120 --> 03:26:11,900
I think the other brother is kind of difficult because he's got a brother.

4454
03:26:12,500 --> 03:26:13,080
You know?

4455
03:26:13,460 --> 03:26:16,120
The brother's got a brother and so it makes it kind of tough.

4456
03:26:18,880 --> 03:26:20,760
You think Tutius was the hardest?

4457
03:26:21,720 --> 03:26:22,280
Really?

4458
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:24,160
Oh, here.

4459
03:26:36,380 --> 03:26:38,680
Tutius is the final boss of the game.

4460
03:26:54,860 --> 03:26:57,160
We can try with the dagger again.

4461
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:58,380
On this guy.

4462
03:26:58,640 --> 03:26:59,520
We'll have a katana.

4463
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:02,020
The blade of wo- Oh.

4464
03:27:02,640 --> 03:27:03,740
It's like really bad though.

4465
03:27:04,920 --> 03:27:05,120
Hmm.

4466
03:27:10,240 --> 03:27:14,100
This one has drain strength on strike and damage health on strike.

4467
03:27:15,420 --> 03:27:17,320
So, it might actually be worth it.

4468
03:27:20,260 --> 03:27:21,720
My bow needs repairing.

4469
03:27:23,220 --> 03:27:24,100
How do you see?

4470
03:27:33,260 --> 03:27:34,140
Oh, you're right.

4471
03:27:34,240 --> 03:27:34,540
Oh my gosh.

4472
03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:35,560
It has four left.

4473
03:27:35,880 --> 03:27:36,640
Oh my god.

4474
03:27:38,580 --> 03:27:39,060
Wait.

4475
03:27:39,100 --> 03:27:39,940
I can repair it myself.

4476
03:27:42,540 --> 03:27:44,380
Where's my thing?

4477
03:27:46,640 --> 03:27:47,960
Is it in here or in here?

4478
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:53,040
Oh my gosh.

4479
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:54,320
My bow almost broke.

4480
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:56,460
Would have been so bad.

4481
03:27:57,660 --> 03:27:58,420
Where's the...

4482
03:27:58,420 --> 03:27:58,920
What's it called?

4483
03:27:59,160 --> 03:27:59,980
I don't even remember.

4484
03:28:00,980 --> 03:28:01,760
Oh, repair hammer.

4485
03:28:01,900 --> 03:28:02,160
Here we go.

4486
03:28:10,550 --> 03:28:11,090
Uh-oh.

4487
03:28:13,770 --> 03:28:14,270
That's right.

4488
03:28:14,270 --> 03:28:14,630
I forgot.

4489
03:28:20,010 --> 03:28:21,190
Chat summary says E.

4490
03:28:21,250 --> 03:28:22,710
Tina still needs to kill Sextius.

4491
03:28:22,910 --> 03:28:23,470
I just got here.

4492
03:28:23,610 --> 03:28:23,870
Is that true?

4493
03:28:23,970 --> 03:28:24,130
No!

4494
03:28:24,290 --> 03:28:25,210
We killed Sextius.

4495
03:28:25,350 --> 03:28:25,730
We killed.

4496
03:28:25,730 --> 03:28:26,150
We killed.

4497
03:28:26,250 --> 03:28:26,770
We killed him.

4498
03:28:26,990 --> 03:28:27,690
He's dead.

4499
03:28:27,930 --> 03:28:28,370
Dunzo.

4500
03:28:28,550 --> 03:28:28,770
Gone.

4501
03:28:30,630 --> 03:28:31,070
Alright.

4502
03:28:31,370 --> 03:28:32,550
Well, um...

4503
03:28:36,110 --> 03:28:37,410
What's the Blade of Woe do?

4504
03:28:37,550 --> 03:28:37,770
Nothing.

4505
03:28:38,790 --> 03:28:39,310
Alright.

4506
03:28:43,610 --> 03:28:45,470
It's dagger time in the night.

4507
03:28:47,670 --> 03:28:49,170
I'm gonna stand here.

4508
03:28:52,870 --> 03:28:54,410
We'll sneak in from up here.

4509
03:28:55,910 --> 03:29:01,750
We'll sneak in from the door that I always go through on accident.

4510
03:29:03,750 --> 03:29:05,450
And while he's asleep...

4511
03:29:06,670 --> 03:29:07,870
We cut him.

4512
03:29:08,470 --> 03:29:09,590
We kill him.

4513
03:29:13,120 --> 03:29:14,040
I think.

4514
03:29:17,950 --> 03:29:20,490
So I'm gonna wait here until like midnight.

4515
03:29:21,230 --> 03:29:21,870
Yeah.

4516
03:29:28,900 --> 03:29:29,300
Yeah.

4517
03:29:29,300 --> 03:29:29,380
Yeah.

4518
03:29:30,880 --> 03:29:31,520
Yeah.

4519
03:29:31,520 --> 03:29:32,600
Countdown to his death.

4520
03:29:34,100 --> 03:29:35,660
But his other brother's gonna know.

4521
03:29:36,060 --> 03:29:37,360
That's what's so scary.

4522
03:29:37,860 --> 03:29:39,320
What if I just kill everybody?

4523
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:51,320
Wait, it's open.

4524
03:29:53,420 --> 03:29:54,060
Hmm.

4525
03:29:54,580 --> 03:29:55,520
Are they awake?

4526
03:30:01,030 --> 03:30:01,670
Ah!

4527
03:30:03,030 --> 03:30:04,850
You're not the brother I need to kill.

4528
03:30:07,570 --> 03:30:08,130
Um...

4529
03:30:08,130 --> 03:30:09,470
I'm Gaston Cirilli.

4530
03:30:09,690 --> 03:30:11,310
Perhaps you've met my brother David.

4531
03:30:12,030 --> 03:30:14,210
Together we are the Cirilli Brothers Winery.

4532
03:30:19,360 --> 03:30:19,920
Uh...

4533
03:30:22,540 --> 03:30:23,600
You too.

4534
03:30:34,170 --> 03:30:35,650
But the door is open.

4535
03:30:35,650 --> 03:30:36,810
You can't get mad at me.

4536
03:30:38,310 --> 03:30:40,390
What if we wait like another two hours?

4537
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:48,740
The lights are on?

4538
03:30:49,160 --> 03:30:50,200
That shouldn't matter.

4539
03:30:50,720 --> 03:30:50,920
Right?

4540
03:30:51,360 --> 03:30:51,580
Okay.

4541
03:31:02,750 --> 03:31:03,930
They will be asleep.

4542
03:31:12,780 --> 03:31:13,820
Sneak 100.

4543
03:31:19,110 --> 03:31:22,130
I saw some people saying that the Blade of Woe might be better.

4544
03:31:22,590 --> 03:31:24,610
But I think this one would be better, no?

4545
03:31:25,050 --> 03:31:26,150
Because it has more effects.

4546
03:31:26,290 --> 03:31:27,490
The Blade of Woe has nothing.

4547
03:31:28,490 --> 03:31:30,070
And they're the same damage.

4548
03:31:32,810 --> 03:31:33,630
I think.

4549
03:31:43,250 --> 03:31:43,770
Okay.

4550
03:31:44,070 --> 03:31:45,270
You just sleep with the door open.

4551
03:31:45,670 --> 03:31:47,010
And so do you.

4552
03:31:47,270 --> 03:31:47,370
Okay.

4553
03:31:52,480 --> 03:31:53,000
Uh...

4554
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:53,140
Wait.

4555
03:31:53,320 --> 03:31:53,480
Open?

4556
03:31:53,720 --> 03:31:53,980
Okay.

4557
03:31:54,680 --> 03:31:55,060
Yeah.

4558
03:31:58,530 --> 03:31:59,750
It's something for later men.

4559
03:31:59,850 --> 03:32:00,650
Don't worry about it.

4560
03:32:00,710 --> 03:32:01,110
They're wrong.

4561
03:32:01,830 --> 03:32:02,350
Okay.

4562
03:32:08,630 --> 03:32:11,070
I want to make it shut up, but I'm stealing.

4563
03:32:21,570 --> 03:32:23,050
White noise machine.

4564
03:32:23,050 --> 03:32:23,510
Truly.

4565
03:32:29,870 --> 03:32:30,250
Okay.

4566
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:35,880
So, I have a question.

4567
03:32:36,180 --> 03:32:39,140
If I go to kill this guy, would it be better if I'm sneaking while doing it?

4568
03:32:39,280 --> 03:32:39,960
Or if I...

4569
03:32:39,960 --> 03:32:41,260
Do I get a bonus if I sneak?

4570
03:32:41,380 --> 03:32:42,900
Kind of like with a bow and arrow.

4571
03:32:45,280 --> 03:32:46,280
This is Gaston?

4572
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:49,940
I'm so sorry.

4573
03:32:54,270 --> 03:32:55,030
Oh, I sneak.

4574
03:32:55,270 --> 03:32:55,410
Okay.

4575
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:05,620
Okay.

4576
03:33:05,620 --> 03:33:06,000
They're the gods.

4577
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:07,420
There's a psychopath on the loose.

4578
03:33:09,140 --> 03:33:09,620
Look out.

4579
03:33:14,220 --> 03:33:14,460
Brother!

4580
03:33:19,220 --> 03:33:19,460
Help!

4581
03:33:19,720 --> 03:33:19,960
Help!

4582
03:33:20,100 --> 03:33:20,640
I'm being attacked!

4583
03:33:20,860 --> 03:33:21,240
No, you're not!

4584
03:33:21,340 --> 03:33:21,680
No, you're not!

4585
03:33:21,780 --> 03:33:22,080
No, you're not!

4586
03:33:22,540 --> 03:33:22,840
No, you're not!

4587
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:23,240
No, you're not!

4588
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:23,620
No, you're not!

4589
03:33:23,800 --> 03:33:24,040
Gaston!

4590
03:33:24,120 --> 03:33:24,320
Gaston!

4591
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:25,140
Gaston!

4592
03:33:25,140 --> 03:33:25,160
Gaston!

4593
03:33:25,240 --> 03:33:25,400
Shut up!

4594
03:33:25,840 --> 03:33:26,080
Gaston!

4595
03:33:26,080 --> 03:33:26,240
Gaston!

4596
03:33:26,340 --> 03:33:26,540
Shut up!

4597
03:33:26,800 --> 03:33:27,040
Gaston!

4598
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:29,340
You're being unruly.

4599
03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:42,850
Did we make it?

4600
03:33:48,480 --> 03:33:50,560
It's just auto-saved, so I'm kind of scared.

4601
03:33:55,230 --> 03:33:56,210
Check Bounty.

4602
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:06,180
Just for stealing!

4603
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:26,880
I'll never do it again, officer!

4604
03:34:33,700 --> 03:34:36,380
Oh my gosh, we totally sliced and diced that guy.

4605
03:34:45,440 --> 03:34:47,100
It's all over, Lawbreaker!

4606
03:34:47,640 --> 03:34:49,120
Your spree is at an end.

4607
03:34:49,180 --> 03:34:49,860
Oh, the Nernruz!

4608
03:34:49,860 --> 03:34:51,440
I'll take any stolen goods you have.

4609
03:34:51,640 --> 03:34:53,600
The next move is yours.

4610
03:34:54,280 --> 03:34:55,080
Pay your fine.

4611
03:34:55,160 --> 03:34:57,280
Or I'll haul you away.

4612
03:35:00,540 --> 03:35:01,880
Okay, you can take my gold.

4613
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:03,580
I'm gonna make it all back anyway.

4614
03:35:03,920 --> 03:35:04,640
That's too bad.

4615
03:35:04,960 --> 03:35:07,460
I was hoping you'd resist arrest.

4616
03:35:08,280 --> 03:35:08,720
Okay.

4617
03:35:09,080 --> 03:35:09,440
Wait, no!

4618
03:35:09,520 --> 03:35:10,720
I don't want to go to the castle!

4619
03:35:12,580 --> 03:35:13,460
I'll die.

4620
03:35:14,300 --> 03:35:14,940
I

4621
03:35:18,620 --> 03:35:19,620
shouldn't have taken it.

4622
03:35:20,080 --> 03:35:21,060
Oh, where am I?

4623
03:35:21,920 --> 03:35:23,860
Wow, it's beautiful!

4624
03:35:25,260 --> 03:35:25,860
Wow!

4625
03:35:29,940 --> 03:35:30,500
Glarthor?

4626
03:35:35,130 --> 03:35:36,250
Our Nerdroot!

4627
03:35:37,970 --> 03:35:39,090
Our Nerdroot!

4628
03:35:39,930 --> 03:35:41,530
I love that you're playing more Oblivion.

4629
03:35:41,650 --> 03:35:43,030
I thought maybe you were done.

4630
03:35:43,350 --> 03:35:44,230
I might be...

4631
03:35:44,830 --> 03:35:46,370
I might be after this.

4632
03:35:46,370 --> 03:35:47,210
I'm not gonna lie.

4633
03:35:47,210 --> 03:35:47,510
I...

4634
03:35:48,590 --> 03:35:50,330
I've kind of seen...

4635
03:35:50,950 --> 03:35:53,510
Well, you know, I don't know everything about the game.

4636
03:35:53,690 --> 03:35:54,030
Obviously.

4637
03:35:54,990 --> 03:35:56,210
I've only seen...

4638
03:35:57,490 --> 03:35:59,070
things that I've wanted to see.

4639
03:36:01,730 --> 03:36:02,170
But...

4640
03:36:04,110 --> 03:36:04,750
I don't know.

4641
03:36:04,850 --> 03:36:05,510
I'll think about it.

4642
03:36:07,590 --> 03:36:08,970
It's comfy to watch.

4643
03:36:12,670 --> 03:36:13,170
Okay.

4644
03:36:13,970 --> 03:36:14,470
Alright.

4645
03:36:14,510 --> 03:36:15,150
I'm gonna wait.

4646
03:36:15,330 --> 03:36:16,170
I'm just gonna wait here.

4647
03:36:16,390 --> 03:36:17,550
I'm just gonna...

4648
03:36:17,550 --> 03:36:18,350
La la la!

4649
03:36:19,390 --> 03:36:19,890
Uh...

4650
03:36:21,110 --> 03:36:21,870
What is it?

4651
03:36:21,950 --> 03:36:22,710
Like 12 hours?

4652
03:36:24,090 --> 03:36:24,590
No.

4653
03:36:27,330 --> 03:36:27,950
Just wait.

4654
03:36:30,850 --> 03:36:32,150
As long as you're having fun.

4655
03:36:32,390 --> 03:36:32,530
Yeah!

4656
03:36:33,710 --> 03:36:35,490
This playthrough got Glarthor and...

4657
03:36:36,770 --> 03:36:38,150
The most important things.

4658
03:36:38,350 --> 03:36:38,650
I know.

4659
03:36:38,870 --> 03:36:39,530
I was so excited.

4660
03:36:42,810 --> 03:36:44,430
I will always probably have it.

4661
03:36:45,130 --> 03:36:46,730
It's kind of like...

4662
03:36:46,730 --> 03:36:47,190
Okay.

4663
03:36:47,510 --> 03:36:49,670
When I don't know what to play, I would play Minecraft.

4664
03:36:50,130 --> 03:36:50,470
Oh, whoops.

4665
03:36:50,530 --> 03:36:50,970
Not the map.

4666
03:36:50,970 --> 03:36:51,370
Okay.

4667
03:36:54,010 --> 03:36:55,050
And now...

4668
03:36:55,810 --> 03:36:58,430
When I don't know what to play, I can play...

4669
03:36:58,970 --> 03:36:59,250
Oblivion.

4670
03:37:00,550 --> 03:37:01,830
Easy pick-up game.

4671
03:37:02,630 --> 03:37:03,150
Yeah.

4672
03:37:04,350 --> 03:37:04,870
Alright.

4673
03:37:05,090 --> 03:37:05,870
You should be here, what?

4674
03:37:05,950 --> 03:37:06,970
In like 30 minutes?

4675
03:37:07,110 --> 03:37:07,250
Yeah.

4676
03:37:08,110 --> 03:37:08,330
Oh!

4677
03:37:08,630 --> 03:37:09,230
You're here!

4678
03:37:09,750 --> 03:37:10,490
Have you...

4679
03:37:10,490 --> 03:37:11,370
done...

4680
03:37:11,370 --> 03:37:12,390
what I asked?

4681
03:37:13,470 --> 03:37:13,990
Yes.

4682
03:37:14,490 --> 03:37:15,510
They are all dead.

4683
03:37:16,110 --> 03:37:16,630
Really?

4684
03:37:17,110 --> 03:37:18,270
They're really...

4685
03:37:18,270 --> 03:37:18,650
dead?

4686
03:37:19,290 --> 03:37:20,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

4687
03:37:21,570 --> 03:37:22,470
I'm free!

4688
03:37:22,970 --> 03:37:24,550
I'm finally free!

4689
03:37:24,870 --> 03:37:25,450
Me too!

4690
03:37:25,610 --> 03:37:26,850
Of this damn quest!

4691
03:37:28,330 --> 03:37:32,290
This game is very much a big toy or sandbox, and I've had fun playing it.

4692
03:37:32,430 --> 03:37:32,610
Yeah!

4693
03:37:33,630 --> 03:37:39,030
By all means, I would have paid any amount to be rid of those watching eyes.

4694
03:37:39,170 --> 03:37:41,910
Always watching me, but never again!

4695
03:37:43,890 --> 03:37:45,010
I'm free!

4696
03:37:45,810 --> 03:37:46,650
Me too!

4697
03:37:46,650 --> 03:37:46,730
Me too!

4698
03:37:47,910 --> 03:37:49,610
One thousand gold, baby!

4699
03:37:49,970 --> 03:37:50,090
Okay.

4700
03:37:55,960 --> 03:37:56,440
Oh.

4701
03:37:56,700 --> 03:37:56,920
Oops.

4702
03:37:58,780 --> 03:38:00,240
You dare attack me?

4703
03:38:16,800 --> 03:38:18,040
Do you think I got caught?

4704
03:38:23,360 --> 03:38:24,740
He's not running after me.

4705
03:38:26,680 --> 03:38:27,960
Where's Glarther's home again?

4706
03:38:29,200 --> 03:38:29,940
Grab his loot.

4707
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:30,760
Oh, you're right, I forgot.

4708
03:38:32,580 --> 03:38:33,980
Happy as long as you're happy.

4709
03:38:34,840 --> 03:38:35,680
Thanks, Robin.

4710
03:38:37,300 --> 03:38:38,340
Who bought his key, right?

4711
03:38:54,180 --> 03:38:54,980
Why'd you kill him?

4712
03:38:55,060 --> 03:38:56,860
Because he's got more money in his house.

4713
03:39:08,930 --> 03:39:10,890
We own two houses now.

4714
03:39:12,630 --> 03:39:13,050
Where...

4715
03:39:13,050 --> 03:39:13,530
Oh, we're here.

4716
03:39:17,460 --> 03:39:18,060
Yippee!

4717
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:26,740
It felt so good doing that, I'm not gonna lie.

4718
03:39:28,120 --> 03:39:29,380
Not gonna lie.

4719
03:39:31,120 --> 03:39:33,480
Felt good robbing him of all he's worth.

4720
03:39:35,380 --> 03:39:35,980
And...

4721
03:39:35,980 --> 03:39:37,400
Taking care of the problem.

4722
03:39:40,100 --> 03:39:40,700
Whoa.

4723
03:39:52,580 --> 03:39:53,860
Still got it, baby!

4724
03:39:53,860 --> 03:39:54,020
Sweet.

4725
03:39:55,640 --> 03:39:56,740
Oh, that's right.

4726
03:39:56,920 --> 03:39:57,660
He's got that stuff in there.

4727
03:39:57,760 --> 03:39:57,840
Okay.

4728
03:39:58,320 --> 03:39:59,120
Wait, do I have to...

4729
03:39:59,120 --> 03:39:59,420
Okay, yeah.

4730
03:40:01,060 --> 03:40:02,160
Where's all your money?

4731
03:40:03,240 --> 03:40:04,620
Oh, that's worth something.

4732
03:40:11,180 --> 03:40:12,620
Maybe it was in his pockets.

4733
03:40:16,780 --> 03:40:17,720
One gold.

4734
03:40:18,060 --> 03:40:18,740
One gold.

4735
03:40:19,080 --> 03:40:19,860
One gold.

4736
03:40:20,160 --> 03:40:20,720
One gold.

4737
03:40:40,540 --> 03:40:41,060
Nice.

4738
03:40:44,290 --> 03:40:45,110
I like...

4739
03:40:45,110 --> 03:40:47,330
Are these showing up as, like, stolen items?

4740
03:40:54,190 --> 03:40:55,230
This one is.

4741
03:40:57,670 --> 03:40:58,110
Okay.

4742
03:40:58,670 --> 03:40:59,410
There's a few.

4743
03:40:59,590 --> 03:41:00,270
There's a few...

4744
03:41:00,270 --> 03:41:01,550
Okay, they are showing up as stolen.

4745
03:41:01,790 --> 03:41:01,890
Okay.

4746
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:21,880
From red containers, yes.

4747
03:41:22,080 --> 03:41:22,280
Okay.

4748
03:41:22,600 --> 03:41:24,280
We'll just go sell them at the...

4749
03:41:24,780 --> 03:41:25,600
The place.

4750
03:41:27,320 --> 03:41:28,420
The place with the guy.

4751
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:33,540
I thought I remembered there being more money, but maybe he actually does just give it to you.

4752
03:41:35,740 --> 03:41:36,340
Ohaiyo!

4753
03:41:37,240 --> 03:41:37,740
Ohaiyo!

4754
03:41:37,740 --> 03:41:38,700
Trash bin at the entrance.

4755
03:41:41,500 --> 03:41:42,500
Oh!

4756
03:41:46,860 --> 03:41:48,560
Every tiny bit counts.

4757
03:41:50,380 --> 03:41:51,640
Trash bin.

4758
03:41:57,860 --> 03:41:59,140
Holy moly!

4759
03:41:59,860 --> 03:42:00,960
Thank you!

4760
03:42:01,860 --> 03:42:02,260
Thank you!

4761
03:42:02,360 --> 03:42:02,580
Thank you!

4762
03:42:02,580 --> 03:42:03,260
Thank you!

4763
03:42:05,900 --> 03:42:06,540
800...

4764
03:42:06,540 --> 03:42:08,480
Gold in the garbage.

4765
03:42:08,680 --> 03:42:11,540
And also, he's just got little pieces of gold lying around his house.

4766
03:42:18,430 --> 03:42:20,410
A less rude song.

4767
03:42:30,400 --> 03:42:31,920
How much money do I have?

4768
03:42:32,260 --> 03:42:33,040
Two thousand!

4769
03:42:41,730 --> 03:42:42,210
Guys...

4770
03:42:43,110 --> 03:42:44,750
I think we got away with it.

4771
03:42:46,830 --> 03:42:47,970
Because it's Glarther.

4772
03:42:50,090 --> 03:42:51,530
It's because it's Glarther!

4773
03:42:51,890 --> 03:42:53,030
Nobody cares about him.

4774
03:42:53,130 --> 03:42:54,170
It's kind of sad, but you know.

4775
03:42:56,190 --> 03:42:57,530
It is what it is.

4776
03:43:04,130 --> 03:43:05,610
And then we go to...

4777
03:43:07,570 --> 03:43:08,910
It was here, right?

4778
03:43:11,590 --> 03:43:12,810
Or was it here?

4779
03:43:14,050 --> 03:43:15,610
That we could sell...

4780
03:43:16,270 --> 03:43:17,610
Maybe it was...

4781
03:43:18,510 --> 03:43:19,030
Bruma.

4782
03:43:23,110 --> 03:43:24,210
I think it was Bruma.

4783
03:43:24,890 --> 03:43:25,570
Bruma, yeah?

4784
03:43:25,730 --> 03:43:26,350
Okay, thanks guys.

4785
03:43:29,370 --> 03:43:30,630
What is it now?

4786
03:43:30,830 --> 03:43:31,190
Nothing!

4787
03:43:32,050 --> 03:43:33,710
My children are starving.

4788
03:43:34,270 --> 03:43:35,250
Please help.

4789
03:43:36,110 --> 03:43:37,410
Wait, it's down here, isn't it?

4790
03:43:41,620 --> 03:43:42,220
Hello.

4791
03:43:42,680 --> 03:43:42,980
Hello!

4792
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:46,320
Maybe it wasn't down here.

4793
03:43:46,740 --> 03:43:47,940
Wait, what was the place called?

4794
03:43:50,380 --> 03:43:51,580
Here's my...

4795
03:43:54,520 --> 03:43:55,660
House for sale.

4796
03:43:56,180 --> 03:43:57,420
I have my own home.

4797
03:44:00,940 --> 03:44:02,100
Was it...

4798
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:02,180
Olaf?

4799
03:44:02,680 --> 03:44:03,280
Olaf's.

4800
03:44:03,560 --> 03:44:04,240
How do you do?

4801
03:44:04,600 --> 03:44:05,260
The other way.

4802
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:09,200
The lame tavern on the first floor.

4803
03:44:10,280 --> 03:44:11,400
Here we go!

4804
03:44:16,900 --> 03:44:17,500
Greetings!

4805
03:44:18,260 --> 03:44:19,880
Is it true what they're saying?

4806
03:44:20,200 --> 03:44:21,980
Is Banelan really dead?

4807
03:44:22,140 --> 03:44:22,920
Who's Banelan?

4808
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:24,020
I don't think so.

4809
03:44:24,580 --> 03:44:26,380
Old Banelan is dead.

4810
03:44:26,760 --> 03:44:29,040
I hear it was a horrible accident.

4811
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:31,000
He was resting in his chair.

4812
03:44:31,200 --> 03:44:31,460
Oh, yeah!

4813
03:44:31,820 --> 03:44:32,240
And boom!

4814
03:44:32,680 --> 03:44:34,600
A stuffed head fell on him.

4815
03:44:34,600 --> 03:44:35,360
I did that!

4816
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:36,960
Is that so?

4817
03:44:37,800 --> 03:44:38,700
Poor Arnora.

4818
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:43,760
Seems her boyfriend, Jorander, has stolen some gold from her and left her penniless.

4819
03:44:44,100 --> 03:44:46,760
Now he's in jail and she's destitute.

4820
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:48,300
Hey.

4821
03:44:49,620 --> 03:44:50,340
Olaf.

4822
03:44:50,340 --> 03:44:50,780
Olaf.

4823
03:44:52,360 --> 03:44:53,580
Have a look around.

4824
03:44:53,720 --> 03:44:54,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4825
03:44:54,180 --> 03:44:56,560
You won't find better prices in all Tamriel.

4826
03:45:00,440 --> 03:45:01,560
I'm here...

4827
03:45:02,280 --> 03:45:03,180
All items.

4828
03:45:07,800 --> 03:45:08,360
Huh?

4829
03:45:09,320 --> 03:45:11,120
Why is it not showing all the items?

4830
03:45:12,200 --> 03:45:13,460
Oh, it's Angar.

4831
03:45:13,760 --> 03:45:14,940
Good journey to you.

4832
03:45:14,940 --> 03:45:15,580
I always forget.

4833
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:16,940
Wait, where's our guy then?

4834
03:45:17,400 --> 03:45:18,020
Excuse me!

4835
03:45:18,840 --> 03:45:19,760
Is he asleep?

4836
03:45:21,240 --> 03:45:22,340
Are you in here?

4837
03:45:23,020 --> 03:45:23,640
Angar?

4838
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:25,740
I always forget.

4839
03:45:26,140 --> 03:45:28,620
I always think it's him because they, like, look similar.

4840
03:45:30,240 --> 03:45:30,860
Uh...

4841
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:31,880
Could be at his house.

4842
03:45:32,940 --> 03:45:33,500
Dang it.

4843
03:45:35,440 --> 03:45:36,460
He's home!

4844
03:45:36,640 --> 03:45:37,780
That means he's probably asleep.

4845
03:45:38,440 --> 03:45:39,060
Angar!

4846
03:45:41,540 --> 03:45:43,020
Let's wait for...

4847
03:45:43,650 --> 03:45:44,340
Five hours.

4848
03:45:45,620 --> 03:45:47,380
He'll want his 10 a.m.

4849
03:45:47,580 --> 03:45:47,800
drink.

4850
03:45:50,340 --> 03:45:51,440
12 p.m.

4851
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:51,940
drink.

4852
03:46:05,630 --> 03:46:10,630
Seems her boyfriend, Jorunda, has stolen some gold from her and left her penniless.

4853
03:46:10,630 --> 03:46:11,910
Now he's...

4854
03:46:11,910 --> 03:46:13,490
Alright, this is the last thing I'm gonna do, guys.

4855
03:46:13,590 --> 03:46:14,370
And then we'll...

4856
03:46:14,370 --> 03:46:15,150
We will...

4857
03:46:15,150 --> 03:46:16,510
Wrap it up.

4858
03:46:16,790 --> 03:46:17,450
Good afternoon.

4859
03:46:17,890 --> 03:46:18,730
Good afternoon.

4860
03:46:19,090 --> 03:46:20,490
Good news from Kvatch for a change.

4861
03:46:21,070 --> 03:46:22,110
The last of the...

4862
03:46:22,110 --> 03:46:22,970
Good news!

4863
03:46:26,070 --> 03:46:27,190
The gossip?

4864
03:46:28,130 --> 03:46:28,970
Good afternoon.

4865
03:46:29,290 --> 03:46:31,010
Any idea what Grom will do?

4866
03:46:31,250 --> 03:46:32,790
Now that Baelin is dead?

4867
03:46:33,610 --> 03:46:34,230
I hear you.

4868
03:46:34,430 --> 03:46:35,510
Everybody's just yelling.

4869
03:46:36,850 --> 03:46:38,050
That's not our person.

4870
03:46:38,350 --> 03:46:39,230
Where's our guy?

4871
03:46:39,230 --> 03:46:39,430
Hi.

4872
03:46:39,590 --> 03:46:41,030
Greetings, daughter of Steven.

4873
03:46:41,770 --> 03:46:44,410
I just wanna sell my stuff before I forget.

4874
03:46:44,830 --> 03:46:45,850
Unless you're like five hours.

4875
03:46:49,310 --> 03:46:51,970
Do you have the Thieves Guild quest that marks him for you?

4876
03:46:52,110 --> 03:46:53,830
Oh, we've already talked to him before.

4877
03:46:55,490 --> 03:46:56,110
Greetings to you.

4878
03:46:56,750 --> 03:46:57,150
Angar!

4879
03:46:57,410 --> 03:46:57,870
How do you do?

4880
03:46:58,070 --> 03:46:58,730
Stop, stop moving!

4881
03:46:59,190 --> 03:47:00,110
I'm really tired.

4882
03:47:00,490 --> 03:47:02,110
Can we get on with this?

4883
03:47:02,570 --> 03:47:03,470
Yeah, me too.

4884
03:47:04,370 --> 03:47:05,790
Pay off my fines and bounties.

4885
03:47:05,950 --> 03:47:06,610
Do I have fines?

4886
03:47:06,730 --> 03:47:07,450
I don't think so.

4887
03:47:10,790 --> 03:47:11,430
Wait.

4888
03:47:14,190 --> 03:47:21,870
Armand Kristoff and Scriva have special ar- They can make a- How do I sell my stuff?

4889
03:47:26,650 --> 03:47:29,470
He needs to be at home or in the inn.

4890
03:47:29,970 --> 03:47:30,470
Go inside!

4891
03:47:30,870 --> 03:47:31,750
Aren't you thirsty?

4892
03:47:32,950 --> 03:47:34,170
Angar the weary?

4893
03:47:35,790 --> 03:47:36,270
Stop.

4894
03:47:36,610 --> 03:47:36,710
Please.

4895
03:47:36,950 --> 03:47:37,870
Don't look at me anymore.

4896
03:47:38,250 --> 03:47:38,370
Okay.

4897
03:47:38,630 --> 03:47:39,390
Are you going home?

4898
03:47:42,390 --> 03:47:42,870
Okay.

4899
03:47:43,050 --> 03:47:44,110
He doesn't do it.

4900
03:47:44,230 --> 03:47:49,530
I guess- I guess it's not wise to do illegal dealings outside in the open.

4901
03:47:49,690 --> 03:47:50,350
Greetings to you.

4902
03:47:51,470 --> 03:47:52,210
It's you.

4903
03:47:52,470 --> 03:47:53,430
No, no, please.

4904
03:47:53,770 --> 03:47:54,410
Is this your home?

4905
03:47:54,530 --> 03:47:55,090
Where's your home?

4906
03:47:55,230 --> 03:47:56,110
I'll help you get there.

4907
03:47:56,690 --> 03:47:57,230
Old man.

4908
03:47:57,230 --> 03:47:57,310
Old man.

4909
03:47:57,490 --> 03:48:01,030
You can- you can even hold on to my arm and I'll guide you.

4910
03:48:04,170 --> 03:48:04,950
Old man.

4911
03:48:05,550 --> 03:48:07,270
It's like an old lady crossing the street.

4912
03:48:07,350 --> 03:48:08,930
Get out of here before you get hurt.

4913
03:48:17,820 --> 03:48:19,520
Who the hell is Jerl?

4914
03:48:20,220 --> 03:48:21,220
Oh, I found it.

4915
03:48:21,360 --> 03:48:21,440
Okay.

4916
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:21,980
All right.

4917
03:48:22,060 --> 03:48:22,520
Now we wait.

4918
03:48:23,220 --> 03:48:24,020
He's going in.

4919
03:48:24,160 --> 03:48:25,740
Actually, what if I meet him inside?

4920
03:48:28,020 --> 03:48:29,240
I'll meet you in there, Angar.

4921
03:48:30,140 --> 03:48:32,500
I dreamed you replaced the- Ah!

4922
03:48:32,740 --> 03:48:34,120
Emote and wouldn't say why.

4923
03:48:34,640 --> 03:48:35,460
Why did you?

4924
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:36,600
We need to scream.

4925
03:48:36,960 --> 03:48:37,720
I felt horrible.

4926
03:48:38,020 --> 03:48:39,220
You need to take responsibility.

4927
03:48:39,840 --> 03:48:40,100
See?

4928
03:48:40,340 --> 03:48:41,840
It's not just- What?

4929
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:46,520
You had a dream and you are mad at me and now you're mad at me in real life.

4930
03:48:53,880 --> 03:48:54,920
Cheese wedge.

4931
03:48:55,100 --> 03:48:56,300
Guys, what should I have for dinner?

4932
03:48:58,420 --> 03:48:59,580
What should I have for dinner?

4933
03:49:05,280 --> 03:49:08,020
I want to raid into Nimmi's 3D.

4934
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:10,680
So...

4935
03:49:10,680 --> 03:49:11,160
Pizza.

4936
03:49:11,520 --> 03:49:12,040
Borgor.

4937
03:49:12,140 --> 03:49:13,820
I haven't had Borgor in a while.

4938
03:49:14,700 --> 03:49:15,220
Spaghetti!

4939
03:49:15,700 --> 03:49:16,780
Where the hell is he?

4940
03:49:28,420 --> 03:49:29,300
Is that him?

4941
03:49:29,880 --> 03:49:30,400
Yes.

4942
03:49:32,420 --> 03:49:34,160
Where are you going?

4943
03:49:34,640 --> 03:49:35,520
That's not your home.

4944
03:49:41,180 --> 03:49:42,340
I'm really tired.

4945
03:49:44,130 --> 03:49:45,360
Shadow hide you.

4946
03:49:48,050 --> 03:49:48,500
No!

4947
03:49:49,200 --> 03:49:49,680
Please!

4948
03:49:54,990 --> 03:49:56,360
Let's wait an hour.

4949
03:49:59,480 --> 03:50:00,680
What hour?

4950
03:50:09,050 --> 03:50:10,550
Let's see if he's home.

4951
03:50:10,550 --> 03:50:12,450
If he's not home, we go to the tavern.

4952
03:50:15,790 --> 03:50:16,230
Tavern.

4953
03:50:19,650 --> 03:50:20,090
Yes.

4954
03:50:22,110 --> 03:50:22,550
No!

4955
03:50:23,530 --> 03:50:23,970
Agar!

4956
03:50:25,590 --> 03:50:25,950
Sorry.

4957
03:50:26,130 --> 03:50:26,930
It's like...

4958
03:50:26,930 --> 03:50:27,850
Glitching so much.

4959
03:50:33,500 --> 03:50:34,260
Please, sir.

4960
03:50:34,380 --> 03:50:34,980
Go get a drink.

4961
03:50:41,040 --> 03:50:42,020
Oh my god.

4962
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:42,420
It's a lady!

4963
03:50:43,980 --> 03:50:44,620
Hello there.

4964
03:50:45,200 --> 03:50:45,380
Hello there.

4965
03:50:45,460 --> 03:50:47,840
Not bad work for some folks.

4966
03:50:48,120 --> 03:50:49,780
Where did he go then?

4967
03:51:06,600 --> 03:51:09,180
I'm gonna cause an avalanche if I keep yelling.

4968
03:51:09,540 --> 03:51:11,380
You remind me of a witch I once knew.

4969
03:51:11,720 --> 03:51:12,980
I hate witches.

4970
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:14,600
Agar!

4971
03:51:15,740 --> 03:51:18,060
A coin for an old beggar?

4972
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:21,420
Good evening.

4973
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:22,760
Good evening!

4974
03:51:23,620 --> 03:51:25,140
Have you seen a man?

4975
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:27,340
He's skinny and sad.

4976
03:51:27,340 --> 03:51:28,980
Are you sure?

4977
03:51:29,580 --> 03:51:30,120
Agar!

4978
03:51:32,900 --> 03:51:34,300
He wasn't in his home.

4979
03:51:34,580 --> 03:51:34,960
For sure.

4980
03:51:35,180 --> 03:51:35,380
Okay.

4981
03:51:35,960 --> 03:51:38,020
I know I just peeked in for a second.

4982
03:51:38,860 --> 03:51:39,840
Oh gosh!

4983
03:51:42,960 --> 03:51:44,220
What is it?

4984
03:51:44,720 --> 03:51:47,840
Any idea what Grom will do now that old Baneland is dead?

4985
03:51:48,520 --> 03:51:49,000
Uh huh.

4986
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:50,020
Good to see him.

4987
03:51:50,160 --> 03:51:51,560
Have you heard any word about the other provinces?

4988
03:51:51,960 --> 03:51:55,020
I've heard that Nord warriors have traveled from Skyrim...

4989
03:51:55,600 --> 03:51:56,680
I have no idea.

4990
03:51:57,080 --> 03:51:58,720
I think he's actually gone.

4991
03:52:02,120 --> 03:52:03,660
He got abducted!

4992
03:52:03,740 --> 03:52:04,140
Good evening!

4993
03:52:04,540 --> 03:52:06,740
Okay, maybe he's in here now that the lady is gone.

4994
03:52:08,920 --> 03:52:09,880
Good to see you!

4995
03:52:10,080 --> 03:52:12,360
Yeah, we're just gonna wait a few hours in his house, I think.

4996
03:52:12,420 --> 03:52:12,860
It might be...

4997
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:16,360
I don't...

4998
03:52:16,360 --> 03:52:19,740
I don't know where he disappeared to.

4999
03:52:21,320 --> 03:52:23,320
Even if he's asleep, we'll just wake him up.

5000
03:52:23,640 --> 03:52:24,000
What is it?

5001
03:52:31,790 --> 03:52:32,190
Alright.

5002
03:52:33,970 --> 03:52:35,070
Like five hours.

5003
03:52:37,290 --> 03:52:38,890
It's like a normal thing to do.

5004
03:52:47,000 --> 03:52:47,440
Ungar?

5005
03:52:48,560 --> 03:52:50,240
Thank you so much for the tech gifted!

5006
03:52:50,500 --> 03:52:50,940
Thank you!

5007
03:52:51,060 --> 03:52:51,760
I'm so sorry.

5008
03:52:51,920 --> 03:52:53,180
I don't know how to pronounce your name.

5009
03:52:53,380 --> 03:52:53,820
But thank you!

5010
03:52:53,880 --> 03:52:54,260
Thank you!

5011
03:52:57,280 --> 03:52:57,720
Ungar?

5012
03:52:58,200 --> 03:52:59,320
Is he really gone?

5013
03:53:01,560 --> 03:53:02,680
Is he really gone?

5014
03:53:18,280 --> 03:53:19,100
Let me...

5015
03:53:19,100 --> 03:53:20,660
Let me try going back in time.

5016
03:53:25,960 --> 03:53:26,320
Thung!

5017
03:53:26,660 --> 03:53:27,020
Poftogabii!

5018
03:53:27,260 --> 03:53:27,500
Thank you!

5019
03:53:31,620 --> 03:53:33,560
My Minto gave ourselves the merch given today!

5020
03:53:33,720 --> 03:53:35,540
It seems like a lot of people are getting their merchend.

5021
03:53:35,640 --> 03:53:36,520
Thank you so much for ordering it.

5022
03:53:36,520 --> 03:53:37,200
froiding citizen!

5023
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:38,580
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5024
03:53:40,760 --> 03:53:41,120
Few!

5025
03:53:41,940 --> 03:53:43,380
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

5026
03:53:43,560 --> 03:53:44,160
Thank you!

5027
03:53:44,440 --> 03:53:45,300
Thank you, thank you!

5028
03:53:49,820 --> 03:53:51,940
Oh my freaking god, Ongo.

5029
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:53,800
Yes, please.

5030
03:53:54,680 --> 03:53:58,340
Take the things that I've stolen.

5031
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:03,320
Do you know how hard it was searching for you?

5032
03:54:06,080 --> 03:54:07,260
Can we do 55?

5033
03:54:09,260 --> 03:54:11,320
You've made a good bit of gold.

5034
03:54:12,680 --> 03:54:13,820
Let's try 60.

5035
03:54:14,420 --> 03:54:16,900
Now that we're at 88, this position with him.

5036
03:54:24,130 --> 03:54:24,630
Okay.

5037
03:54:26,630 --> 03:54:28,310
56, my final offer.

5038
03:54:31,290 --> 03:54:31,790
Nice.

5039
03:54:33,970 --> 03:54:34,470
Was that it?

5040
03:54:34,590 --> 03:54:35,270
That's all I took?

5041
03:54:40,960 --> 03:54:42,480
All that for just two things?

5042
03:54:42,480 --> 03:54:43,740
I'm glad that's done.

5043
03:54:45,140 --> 03:54:47,100
Did you ever hear about the ghost of...

5044
03:54:48,800 --> 03:54:49,520
It's over.

5045
03:54:49,740 --> 03:54:52,140
We spent like five minutes at least searching for this guy.

5046
03:54:56,720 --> 03:54:59,440
Well, guys, thank you so much for Oblivion today!

5047
03:55:00,440 --> 03:55:01,100
Thank you!

5048
03:55:01,900 --> 03:55:03,080
I think the rest was coins.

5049
03:55:03,220 --> 03:55:03,780
I think so, too.

5050
03:55:06,320 --> 03:55:07,720
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5051
03:55:08,980 --> 03:55:10,800
Thank you for all the...

5052
03:55:10,800 --> 03:55:12,760
All the gifted, too.

5053
03:55:16,940 --> 03:55:20,080
I understand why you take a break, but I'm glad you got to see the Shivering Isle.

5054
03:55:20,440 --> 03:55:22,160
Thanks for all the Unhinged E-T-N-Adventures.

5055
03:55:22,240 --> 03:55:22,760
Thank you!

5056
03:55:23,280 --> 03:55:24,200
Thank you, thank you!

5057
03:55:26,360 --> 03:55:28,560
I should get my Gamersupps merch on Monday.

5058
03:55:28,680 --> 03:55:30,340
I'm so excited to drink some Liquid Minto.

5059
03:55:30,880 --> 03:55:31,340
Thanks, Sokken!

5060
03:55:31,340 --> 03:55:32,300
How can I help you?

5061
03:55:33,460 --> 03:55:34,700
Thank you guys for the stream.

5062
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:37,400
Let me set it up so that it raids into Nimmies.

5063
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:39,980
Waiting room.

5064
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:43,920
Because she is debuting a new 3D model for summertime.

5065
03:55:45,880 --> 03:55:46,420
So...

5066
03:55:46,420 --> 03:55:48,580
It will surely be very cute.

5067
03:55:49,980 --> 03:55:51,880
And fun to...

5068
03:55:51,880 --> 03:55:52,800
To watch.

5069
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:53,920
Thank you!

5070
03:55:59,100 --> 03:56:00,180
Thank you!

5071
03:56:00,200 --> 03:56:00,680
Thank you!

5072
03:56:00,720 --> 03:56:00,880
Thank you!

5073
03:56:02,860 --> 03:56:05,680
Also, Bogey, I don't know if your donut will come up.

5074
03:56:05,900 --> 03:56:06,800
I see it.

5075
03:56:06,900 --> 03:56:08,880
I don't know if it will come up because of the gifted.

5076
03:56:09,340 --> 03:56:10,520
Of the gifted members.

5077
03:56:11,140 --> 03:56:11,620
But thank you!

5078
03:56:11,720 --> 03:56:12,540
Happy Birthday!

5079
03:56:14,000 --> 03:56:16,340
We couldn't figure it out on time, but ignore that.

5080
03:56:16,760 --> 03:56:16,940
Wait.

5081
03:56:17,100 --> 03:56:17,580
Minto, I'm...

5082
03:56:17,580 --> 03:56:19,060
I'm taking you to the moon.

5083
03:56:19,320 --> 03:56:21,260
I'm on a NASA internship.

5084
03:56:21,320 --> 03:56:22,340
You are going to space.

5085
03:56:28,450 --> 03:56:29,570
Minky to the moon!

5086
03:56:35,100 --> 03:56:38,300
Have a good day, have a good night, and I will see you guys, when I see you next.

5087
03:56:45,780 --> 03:56:46,220
Next!

5088
03:56:46,920 --> 03:56:48,160
Next thing, thank you!

5089
03:56:49,460 --> 03:56:49,900
Atsubito!

5090
03:56:50,540 --> 03:56:50,980
Atsubito!

5091
03:56:51,600 --> 03:56:52,040
Atsubito!

5092
03:56:54,500 --> 03:56:54,940
Atsubito!

5093
03:56:54,940 --> 03:56:55,140
Atsubito!

5094
03:56:55,660 --> 03:56:56,020
Atsubito!

5095
03:56:56,380 --> 03:56:56,820
Itadashai!

5096
03:56:56,820 --> 03:56:57,920
Have a good day, have a good night.

5097
03:56:58,060 --> 03:56:58,680
I'll see you later.

5098
03:56:58,940 --> 03:56:59,620
Bye-bye!

5099
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:00,320
Bye-bye!

5100
03:57:00,440 --> 03:57:00,840
Bye-bye!

5101
03:57:01,400 --> 03:57:01,680
Bye-bye!

5102
03:57:01,680 --> 03:57:01,960
Bye-bye!

5103
03:57:02,520 --> 03:57:02,540
Bye-bye!

5104
03:57:02,540 --> 03:57:02,560
Bye-bye!

5105
03:57:03,140 --> 03:57:03,300
Bye-bye!

5106
03:57:03,300 --> 03:57:03,360
Bye-bye!

5107
03:57:03,360 --> 03:57:03,780
See you next time.
