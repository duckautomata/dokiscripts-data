1
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,180
Sorry!

2
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,940
Sorry!

3
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:42,980
Sorry!

4
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,740
I'm sorry.

5
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,040
I was like, whoa.

6
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,100
It's been a...

7
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,040
It's been a...

8
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a long time.

9
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,240
Wait, what the heck?

10
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,800
Why is my cursor, like, not synced?

11
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,760
Did you see this?

12
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
Oh, weird.

13
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,220
My cursor's not synced with the game.

14
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,900
I wonder if I should restart the game.

15
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Ah!

16
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah.

17
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,100
Let me restart the game.

18
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,740
That's so weird.

19
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,620
So sorry.

20
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,340
Hello.

21
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,260
So sorry.

22
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,820
I hope you enjoyed listening to the intro music.

23
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,980
I hope so.

24
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,000
Hi.

25
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,880
Let's open the game.

26
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh.

27
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
I hear that?

28
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,080
Hold on.

29
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,660
There we go.

30
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,040
There we go.

31
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,020
There we go.

32
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,120
I've actually had that intro music in my head all week.

33
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,620
It's so catchy.

34
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,680
Isn't it so catchy?

35
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,900
I'd listen to it on loop if you uploaded it.

36
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
Um, I did.

37
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,460

38
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,280
I uploaded a one-hour version.

39
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,540
You can listen to it.

40
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I did upload it.

Right, everybody?

45
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:09,400
The Dev puts it as a baby of Bilatro and Buckshot.

46
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, gosh.

47
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,880
Wait, am I going to sing?

48
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,540
Uh-oh.

49
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Clover Pit.

50
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,200
Um, I didn't, it says continue run, but I did not.

51
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
Um, I literally just started it, but it, like, told me a tutorial.

52
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,160
I had to get to the, to the options.

53
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,820
So we'll do new run, obviously.

54
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,260
Wait, where's the tutorial?

55
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,540
Oh, wait, I don't know anything.

56
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,600
Okay, hold on.

57
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,420
Reset tutorial.

58
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,060
Okay.

59
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,820
Okay, next time I'll explain everything again.

60
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,120
Yeah.

61
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,460
Wait.

62
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,700
Wait.

63
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,320
Restart.

64
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,300
Okay.

65
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,860
I feel like this is a spoiler.

66
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,800
Phone charms.

67
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,880
Spines.

68
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,660
What if I had the god seed?

69
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,180
Again, again!

70
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,460
The fastest run in the West?

71
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,140
Okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.

72
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,420
Wait, hold on.

73
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,380
do I have on this thing?

74
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,420
Hold on.

75
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Hello?

76
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,500
Oh.

77
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,660
Oh.

78
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,560
It kind of fair.

79
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,320
It's so...

80
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,360
I'll do this voice then.

81
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,140
Hello.

82
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,880
I'll hear you like the gamble.

83
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,120
No need to panic.

84
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,000
You can play and forget about the world.

85
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,060
Now, do you need me to explain how things work around here?

86
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,660
Yeah.

87
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,720
All right.

88
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,380
Listen carefully.

89
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,200
I won't repeat myself.

90
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,960
This is where you must deposit the coins you earn.

91
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,280
I don't get to keep it?

92
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,080
If you can't deposit enough coins within the given number of rounds, well...

93
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,060
You'll find out.

94
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,980
At the end of every round, you'll earn interest based on your current deposited coins.

95
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,860
Keep depositing to earn more.

96
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,940
And if you deposit all the debt early, you'll all reward you with four Clover tickets for every round left.

97
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,460
Now, the slot machine!

98
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,000
You'll decide how many spins to do for each round.

99
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,200
At the end of each round, you will also receive one Clover ticket.

100
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
But even more in certain conditions.

101
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,300
You're awesome.

102
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:40,780
Hey!

103
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,780
Gooba fan!

104
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,660
Remember to spend your Clover tickets to buy Lucky Charms.

105
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,320
Oh!

106
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,160
They improve your odds of surviving.

107
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,400
Is this more tickets?

108
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,080
You spend tickets to get more tickets?

109
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,860
What is this one?

110
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
It's only one.

111
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,540
The store restocks for free Whenever you manage to deposit the required coins at the ATM

112
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Well, I'm done talking You won't remember all of it anyway

113
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,820
Okay, I'm back Whoa, what is this?

114
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,420
So why is it a move?

115
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,480
Symbols Get them 7-7-7s, baby!

116
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
And, uh...

117
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,040
Don't trust everyone.

118
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,140
Rarity.

119
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,400
Common uncommon rare.

120
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,100
Legendary.

121
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,380
This one, so it's legendary?

122
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,820
I only need one.

123
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,100
Wait, triggers randomly.

124
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,880
20%.

125
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,660
Luck plus 5 for the current spell.

126
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,760
Why does it sound like?

127
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,380
I can't only hear, like, the auto-tune now on my voice.

128
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,660
Yeah.

129
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,000
You can trust me, Minto!

130
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,140
Really?

131
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,920
Okay, I'm giving you my passwords right now.

132
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,260
I'm downloading them to your brain.

133
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,820
I can't hear the auto-tune sometimes.

134
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,700
Okay, I think it's better.

135
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,120
I think it's better.

136
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,760
Fake coin is good.

137
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,720
Hold on, hold on!

138
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,460
Let me read before we start.

139
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,880
Oh, this is common.

140
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,040
Oh, I see now.

141
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,260
Okay, let me read before we start backseating now, okay, you guys?

142
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,880
Okay, hi, dog!

143
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,100
She's played these games before.

144
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,240
She said she's played these games before.

145
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,620
I've played these games before!

146
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,420
Okay, a red pepper.

147
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,580
Why does it glow, though, if it's a common?

148
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,360
Plus, luck plus five for the current spleen.

149
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
This card after 12 activations.

150
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,260
Doesn't take... Oh, it's plus... Oh, so you get...

151
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,480
Girl math?

152
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,060
You spend two...

153
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,800
Wait.

154
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,880
Baby car, thank you for the gift.

155
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:28,940
Wait.

156
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,240
You get...

157
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,600
Wait.

158
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,060
It's free money.

159
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,220
You spend two to get four, so you get plus two.

160
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,800
So it will be worth enough.

161
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,860
20% chance for bells to have the golden modifier.

162
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
Oh, golden modifier scoring a symbol.

163
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,220
Oh, no, I'm already yawning.

164
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,500
It sucks.

165
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,140
It's because I start speaking.

166
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,860
You know, and I like, don't, I don't, well, I spoke a little bit today.

167
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,780
But like, once I start talking, when I use my throat, I get tired.

168
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,980
She is bored of us.

169
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,180
I'm bored.

170
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm bored.

171
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,730
Wait, this is uncommon.

172
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,030
Triggers randomly.

173
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,190
One extra spin, then luck plus four for that spin.

174
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,710
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

175
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,150
So what I should do is buy this.

176
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,220
Nol.

177
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh, no, not that guy.

178
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,940
I'm still laughing from yesterday's stream.

179
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,820
For those who didn't see, I was on Doki Bird's channel.

180
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
And, uh...

181
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,140
That...

182
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,700
Was a stream.

183
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,640
The game is loud?

184
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,480
Gumba.

185
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,140
Lost Gumba.

186
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,540
That's okay.

187
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,960
I...

188
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,620
I'm so...

189
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,980
Ah, well, like, okay, how do I say this?

190
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,520
I think Guba has a lot of potential.

191
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,060
And,

192
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:52,950
I don't know, I mean, I don't really, I don't expect art of me.

193
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,670
I don't think I'm very sexy.

194
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,610
So, uh, uh, I'm not, like, offended that I lost a Goomba.

195
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,820
At least he didn't lose to Captain Price.

196
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,900
I think if I had lost to Captain Price, Captain Price.

197
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,700
He sounds like the mascot of, like, Walmart.

198
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,120
If I had lost to Captain Price, Doki would have never let me hear the end of it.

199
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,600
Thanks for the recommendation.

200
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,020
Oh, yeah, of course.

201
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,900
I love giving my recommendations.

202
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:40,980
Eh.

203
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,700
I love giving my recommendations.

204
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,860
I'm going to start saying weird things about you.

205
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
What does that mean?

206
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,900
Captain Price has been...

207
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,380
Oh my god, done!

208
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,300
Done!

209
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,180
Why?

210
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,360
Wait, I didn't get to read it.

211
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,300
Hold on.

212
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,520
One of those types of games I have to like pause.

213
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,220
Happy birthday!

214
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
A busy person, work hard, be all your dreams, country, whatever.

215
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,040
Oh, whatever, achieving your goal and remembering the wide blue skies, you are not alone!

216
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,860
Oh, the message from JPEG dog!

217
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,480
Happy birthday to you, Vito Balboa.

218
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,300
I need my burn ocean to the ground.

219
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,320
Thank you.

220
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

221
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,680
Learned that Minto like centaurs yesterday.

222
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,140
What?

223
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm up, up, home.

224
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,200
I don't, I don't, I mean, like, I don't hate centaurs, but it's not like my, it's not like my, it's not.

225
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,660
If I was given the choice of centaurs, oh my gosh, I thought...

226
00:22:43,680 --> 00:23:10,520

227
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Okay.

228
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,840
Should I buy the coin or the bell?

229
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,880
I think I should have some sort of...

230
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,680
This one is uncommon.

231
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,100
Seems better.

232
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,080
Ebery!

233
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,360
Ebery, Ebery, Ebery.

234
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,840
I love you, Ebery.

235
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,220
Thank you for the redirect.

236
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320

240
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,990
I bought her that ring.

241
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,790
Who put that ring under your finger, girl?

242
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,270
That big old rock.

243
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,330
Me!

244
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,330
Oh, that's actually not a rock.

245
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,210
It's like slime.

246
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,630
It's official.

247
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,810
Yeah!

248
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,750
Guys, should I get the bell or the coin?

249
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,390
I think I'm going to get the bell.

250
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,890
Because I...

251
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,030
Wait, I can get both!

252
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,430
I'm going to get both.

253
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,770
All in, baby.

254
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,690
Who should I call?

255
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,120
Okay.

256
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,280
What's this now?

257
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,180
Login.

258
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,300
Oh!

259
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,140
One trick pony.

260
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,000
Grants one jackpot.

261
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,740
at the slot machine, then discard this charm.

262
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,640
Unlockable by dying?

263
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,040
Ah, these are unlockables that you give when you die.

264
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,320
My birthday was the 30th!

265
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,840
Jessica, happy birthday!

266
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,300
Happy birthday to you!

267
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,260
Happy birthday to you!

268
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,880
Happy birthday, dear Jessica!

269
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,840
Happy birthday to you!

270
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,440
Who are you?

271
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,700
Happy birthday!

272
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,820
Seven sins stone.

273
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,020
Oh, necklace.

274
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,260
Hello, for bell.

275
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,080
Hello.

276
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,440
23 pages?

277
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,200
Wait, what's this guy?

278
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,180
Discovered.

279
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,280
It's 30% chance.

280
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,500
Wait, how do I... Oh.

281
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,440
How do I get it?

282
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,620
I already have it, apparently.

283
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,340
Wait, why do I... Oh, here we go.

284
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,820
Oh!

285
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,360
Well...

286
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Oh, baby...

287
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:04,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, my job here is done.

288
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,300
Thank you!

289
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,100
We inspect the...

290
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,380
Oh, we can read this.

291
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,540
Oh, it's credits!

292
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,680
And then I'm guessing this takes me to steam.

293
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,700
That's cute.

294
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,500
Wait, what about this?

295
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,120
Oh, okay.

296
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,000
I can only read...

297
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,480
fall.

298
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,440
Minto Captain Price Gumba Love Triangle.

299
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,140
I think I don't stand a chance against their love.

300
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,600
Lucky Chan.

301
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,480
Lucky Chan.

302
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,260
What's that thing?

303
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:37,920
Hello?

304
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,880
I'm afraid I can't let you do that!

305
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,000
Hello?

306
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,620
Okay.

307
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,180
Open.

308
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,700
Oh, oh, this is a...

309
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:46,940
Okay.

310
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,000
I should have known that.

311
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,120
Inspect.

312
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh!

313
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Oh, it's about golden...

314
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,340
Bell.

315
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,960
Pick an option.

316
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,700
There we go.

317
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,180
Oh, okay, so the things that you have on your...

318
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,460
That you are actively using are on your desk, I suppose.

319
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,440
No interest.

320
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,180
Okay, this is where we put our money.

321
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,500
So we gotta get...

322
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,580
Good amount of money.

323
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,780
What is this now?

324
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,180
That's your final reward.

325
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,020
I still haven't decided when you'll get it.

326
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,900
Oh.

327
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,410
Guys, don't look.

328
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:42,930
No way.

329
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,010
I've seen obviously number one in a game, but I've never seen a number two.

330
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,560
Don't look.

331
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,680
I had Taco Bell.

332
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,990
Technology has gotten too far.

333
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,670
Oh, I'm shaking.

334
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,470
Oh god.

335
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,930
Ah!

336
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,650
Oh my god, what did I get?

337
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,570
Looks like you discovered a new lucky charm.

338
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,530
Check out the terminal to learn more.

339
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,590
I broke my toilet!

340
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,530
Oh my god!

341
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,020
Wait, it...

342
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,430
Wait!

343
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,250
Number two...

344
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,310
Oh, no!

345
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,050
It's gold.

346
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,250
Triggered by red button.

347
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,390
all patterns with non-yellow symbols will trigger an additional time.

348
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,130
Okay.

349
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,350
What?

350
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,970
Huh?

351
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,070
Oh.

352
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,930
Oh my god, my dumpy broke the toilet!

353
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,510
I mean...

354
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,950
That is...

355
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,030
Something...

356
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,370
What is that thing?

357
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,350
Okay, that...

358
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,790
I mean, everybody expected that.

359
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,450
Okay, let's just...

360
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,770
How many spins?

361
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,610
Wait, so we're trying to get...

362
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,300
35?

363
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,800
45?

364
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,200
At least?

365
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,420
Not sure if you've seen it, but there's a DLC for Resident Evil 7 called 21.

366
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,980
You play a twisted version of...

367
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,040
Blackjack!

368
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,980
That sounds so fun.

369
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,220
45.

370
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Let's try...

371
00:30:46,400 --> 00:31:18,360
Okay, so we use the coin we minus the coins okay always seven really yeah well you only get okay I see I see because if you do three spins it's more risk and higher reward and it costs less but it's more risk let's try seven though it's my first time let's go gambling let's go gambling how much did I get

372
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,150
I think we've won?

373
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,040
I think we've...

374
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,200
I think we're jackpot?

375
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,280
Why is that one speed?

376
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,040
Oh, okay.

377
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,520
I can do that to all of them.

378
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:02,820
Triggers.

379
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,600
Oh, okay.

380
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,800
I'll try that next time.

381
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,710
I don't remember what my things do.

382
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,450
I think that's the issue.

383
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,770
Triggers randomly.

384
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,510
Okay, one extra spin, then lock.

385
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,170
Okay, okay, okay.

386
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,130
And then you.

387
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,790
Neither of them are for the button.

388
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,810
Okay, okay, okay.

389
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,910
Okay, okay.

390
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,830
This is so exciting!

391
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,070
Ah, dang.

392
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
Oh, lemon, lemon, baby!

393
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,800
No spins left.

394
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,420
Okay.

395
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,780
Okay, okay, okay.

396
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,640
Deadline bonus, so if I give my stuff now, I'll get more things, right?

397
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,880
Good job.

398
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,920
How about another deadline?

399
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,120
Now you need to reach the amount of 200.

400
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,820
Here's your deadline bonus.

401
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,940
Don't say I never treat you.

402
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,980
By the way, the cost to play the slot machine increases.

403
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,900
After every deadline!

404
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,160
Whoa.

405
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,760
Whoa, we got some crazy stuff going on over here.

406
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,200
Okay, hold on, hold on.

407
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,180
Whoa, whoa.

408
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,300
Hello?

409
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
How are things going?

410
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,200
Please, I'll give you anything.

411
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,020
I used to eat healthy.

412
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,580
Can I eat something?

413
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,280
Diamonds.

414
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,500
Oh, wow!

415
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,020
Wait, this is kind of crazy.

416
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,040
Wait, I wish...

417
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,820
Hold on, maybe I should put my head somewhere.

418
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:55,800
Hmm.

419
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:56,960
Okay.

420
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,300
So you guys can read these too.

421
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,520
The diamonds manifest more often plus one permanently.

422
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,680
Cherries manifest more often.

423
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,200
So we need to kind of decide what sort of...

424
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,180
We need bells.

425
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,320
I think bells would be good.

426
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,520
Lucky charms at the store are discounted by two tickets until the next restock of the store.

427
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,980
We had some...

428
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,860
Uh, be right back.

429
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,360
Okay, we had some things here.

430
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,500
So I want to see what they are.

431
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,120
Why is this one glowing?

432
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,420
special, but it says it's common.

433
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
Okay, I get it, I get it.

434
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,920
Wait, this one's rare.

435
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,740
Triggered by the red button.

436
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,140
Sevens manifest more often, plus two for the rest of the current deadline.

437
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,680
Consumes all charges when triggered.

438
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,360
Recharges by one charge at the end of every round.

439
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,000
Whatever three plus patterns trigger during a spin, you earn money equal to your current interest.

440
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,090
Okay.

441
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,730
Okay.

442
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,550
Charms with triggers randomly activate.

443
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,690
Double more often!

444
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,530
Okay, wait.

445
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,470
Because I have two.

446
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,270
No?

447
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,610
This one triggers randomly.

448
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,310
For sure.

449
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,170
So, cat is good.

450
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,090
Okay.

451
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,510
I have nine tickets.

452
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,710
And what was this one?

453
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,470
Pentacle.

454
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,550
Gambler.

455
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:31,430
Okay.

456
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,250
Gain one free restock every deadline.

457
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,710
Symbols multiplier plus one.

458
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,630
This bonus grows by one whenever five plus patterns triggered during a spin.

459
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,450
And then I guess this is the...

460
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,090
Okay, restock.

461
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,870
Okay, got it.

462
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,760
Why is this one rare, though?

463
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,500
I feel like Horseshoe is kind of good.

464
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,440
Also, it says plus 3% to my interest.

465
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:33,820
But I don't want to buy these yet Because we have a thing That will discount our stuff At the store That's why I said be right back So maybe I do this And then we can get a couple things We're cooking We're cooking, we're cooking, we're cooking Because I don't know what kind of like build I want to do I don't even know that that's what I could do I don't know Okay,

466
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,900
let's do that then.

467
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,900
You don't even have money for food!

468
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,060
Interesting data.

469
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,920
Okay, okay, okay.

470
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:46,880
Free!

471
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,560
The cat is free!

472
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,640
The cat is free!

473
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Oh my gosh!

474
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,640
Free cat!

475
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,280
That was the cat distribution center?

476
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,280
Honestly, I could get all of these.

477
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,020
I don't know how many things I can have on...

478
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,300
Oh, three out of seven.

479
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,960
Okay, okay.

480
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,680
That answered my question.

481
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,300
Literally immediately.

482
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,880
I don't know this, though.

483
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,680
What does the charge mean?

484
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,120
What the hell is that?

485
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,400
Where did that...

486
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,500
Was that always there?

487
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,140
We got some apple juice?

488
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,760
Let's go.

489
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,260
Huh.

490
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,960
Huh.

491
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,560
This is all you've said at the phone.

492
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,140
Oh, okay, okay, fun.

493
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,580
Alright.

494
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,320
How are the cats doing anyway?

495
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,140
Um, Merrill is good.

496
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,680
She's silly, silly.

497
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,000
Um, Butaro is uh, not doing so well, unfortunately.

498
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,480
Yeah.

499
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,820
Um, I don't really want to talk about it right now.

500
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,100
I meant Paj.

501
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,060
Oh no, I said her legal name.

502
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,110
I literally just doxxed my cat.

503
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,220
That's okay.

504
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,920
I never use her names anyways.

505
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,820
I always call her little girl.

506
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,700
I call her little girl.

507
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,240
Yeah, don't, don't.

508
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,120
You guys stop.

509
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,740
I know that this is so surprising for you.

510
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,060
Look at your name.

511
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,220
Did you expect anything else?

512
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,750
Honestly, I was deciding between the two of them.

513
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,790
So...

514
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,690
Because...

515
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,830
But I feel like Paz suits her more.

516
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,070
Actually, I wanted to name her Johnny.

517
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,210
Because...

518
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,290
She, like, poops on the ground.

519
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,030
She has, like, really...

520
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:40,610
She has, like, really bad, like, bowel issues.

521
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,690
My cat has IBS, maybe.

522
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,590
I've honestly thought about even changing it to Johnny.

523
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:54,610
I've called, but in the end, I've, I've, like, I've really just called her girl.

524
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,290
So, also, wait, I just saw, hold on.

525
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,610
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

526
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,090
I just saw the pink.

527
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,250
Super late.

528
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,530
Because time's on shenanigans.

529
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,390
But happy belated birthday.

530
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,750
Thank you so much.

531
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

532
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,370
Copta fubo and slippers.

533
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,530
Thank you.

534
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,230
I really appreciate it.

535
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:13,930
Oh.

536
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,210
Um, for anybody, uh, for the merch.

537
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,710
Um, uh, I was talking to Setsuna today.

538
00:40:24,410 --> 00:41:02,810
And they were thinking of a way to make shipping cheaper for those, uh, in, EU so that potentially might be a thing they're working on it so um uh uh um yeah your cat's real name is G Koyo Octopus but yeah so um if that is able to happen they will announce it um so yeah um Remember that time I said far when you're cute?

539
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,170
Wait, what?

540
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,110
Far?

541
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,510
Did I read that right?

542
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,700
Leha, welcome to membership.

543
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,600
Thank you!

544
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,320
Okay, alright, there we go.

545
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,820
Alright, okay, cool.

546
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,500
Oh, yeah, I was still buying these.

547
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,200
Okay, I'm gonna think I'm gonna buy these two.

548
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,620
And then I...

549
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,700
I don't know what the charges are.

550
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,200
I don't know what the charges are.

551
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,140
But it wouldn't...

552
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,800
Seven manifests more often, plus two for the rest of the current deadline.

553
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,230
Charges used by the button.

554
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,090
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

555
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:00,950
That's why.

556
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,750
Triggered by a red button.

557
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,390
Oh!

558
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,270
Consumes all charges when triggered.

559
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,690
Recharges by one charge at the end of it.

560
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,230
Oh!

561
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,630
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

562
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,050
Should I get it?

563
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,710
I have four left.

564
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,050
Why not?

565
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,630
Happy Labor Day.

566
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:18,590
Thank you!

567
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,610
Thank you so much.

568
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,350
I fill up the item to use on the button.

569
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,850
Yeah, oh yeah.

570
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,310
I can always sell it.

571
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,330
It's only two.

572
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,370
I'd get what, one back?

573
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,270
I will only have one slot left though afterwards.

574
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,910
Why is this one like blinking?

575
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,930
I don't like it.

576
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,390
Oh, I have some mail.

577
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,750
I've unlocked a necklace!

578
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,070
Whenever you score, only one pattern with either diamonds or treasures.

579
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,270
It triggers it two additional times.

580
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,190
The final trigger rewards.

581
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,010
It doubles the coins.

582
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,070
Okay.

583
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,770
You should use the toilet.

584
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,230
Again?

585
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,330
I already used it.

586
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,290
Okay, I'll pee.

587
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,760
You're good.

588
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,840
my god achievement take a piss and a dump

589
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,850
i unlocked number one i like how it says do not drink

590
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:50,430
during this round all patterns with yellow symbols will trigger an additional time oh

591
00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:01,570
by pressing the button Wait, what's an additional time mean?

592
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,230
Now we know Mint wouldn't last, that's true.

593
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,170
Petition to rename Wisps to as Pisps.

594
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:14,810
No!

595
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,850
I hate that.

596
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,210
Denied, denied, denied.

597
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,530
The pattern will score twice.

598
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,510
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

599
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,550
Thank you.

600
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,390
I think I'm gonna hold off on the seven, even though it's so tempting because it's a rare.

601
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,610
I think I'll hold off.

602
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,030
thing for the button.

603
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,070
But I mean, I know I can probably get more than one thing on the button.

604
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:39,350
Oh.

605
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:40,510
Wow.

606
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,190
Are you getting my best side?

607
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,350
You need to drink more water, Minto.

608
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,890
I'm drinking water right now.

609
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,140
The bell charm.

610
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,660
This one?

611
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:03,540
Nope.

612
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,580
Brown super chat.

613
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,340
Thank goodness.

614
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:13,710
Let's just go for it.

615
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,390
We need 200.

616
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,470
Oh, maybe I should.

617
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,370
I should get the seven.

618
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,870
I don't know.

619
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,450
You could go for bells.

620
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:33,070
Because we have what, oh, if we get the yellow, if we get the P. If we get the P, then we could go for a yellow build.

621
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,950
Oh, yeah, yellow build.

622
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,170
Really hydrated.

623
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,510
Why did it come out like mustard?

624
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,550
I don't know.

625
00:45:45,110 --> 00:46:19,080
Okay, let's try the yellow build seven spins oh gosh it goes up it goes up it goes up oh look how many lemons are oh okay next lucky not enough what's E oh it's just so I can look Okay.

626
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,500
BING!

627
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:28,930
Ah!

628
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:33,990
Sevens!

629
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,350
Big, big!

630
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,110
Why do I feel like I'm not getting good stuff?

631
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:44,730
Send out this super chat feels like such a relief for- No!

632
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,170
Oh my god!

633
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:54,550
No!

634
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,860
Thank you.

635
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,080
We still have two rounds left, okay?

636
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,140
We still have two rounds.

637
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,480
So, should I deposit everything?

638
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:20,500
Maybe.

639
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,460
I gotta go cuddle my cat.

640
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,960
I'll have fun.

641
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,380
Like, when should I deposit?

642
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,880
When is the good time to do?

643
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,330
Deposits make your cat stronger.

644
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,370
What's my cat at now?

645
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,650
My current interest is...

646
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,010
Oh, whenever 3 plus patterns trigger during a spin, you earn money equal to your current interest.

647
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:43,630
Seven.

648
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,390
Okay.

649
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,120
Oh, okay, okay.

650
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,500
So I'm gonna...

651
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,680
Oh, I see, I see.

652
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,560
Oh, okay, I see.

653
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,600
Okay.

654
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,500
Don't you know if we're talking about P too much or too little?

655
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,800
I think way too much.

656
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,920
I mean I hope you're doing good, but you have your breakfast today.

657
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,560
Today I had

658
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,370
Oh, meal.

659
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,950
How much is a seven spins?

660
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:24,550
14.

661
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,990
Okay, so we'll deposit until we have 14.

662
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,020
This is good.

663
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,280
Okay.

664
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,200
Okay.

665
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,740
I think we'll make it still.

666
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,700
Let's go gambling.

667
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,790
Let's go gambling.

668
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,210
Oh, bink, bink!

669
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,050
If I hold down...

670
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,830
No, it doesn't do anything.

671
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:02,670
Oh god.

672
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,110
Why did it hesitate?

673
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,150
Ah, please!

674
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,830
Why do I feel like my multipliers are not doing anything?

675
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:23,590
Hello?

676
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,190
Oh!

677
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,350
Big buddy!

678
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:36,550
Meow!

679
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,070
Okay.

680
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:42,790
Yes, sir.

681
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,710
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

682
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:46,970
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

683
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,310
Wait, so it's still...

684
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,190
Okay, it's still 14.

685
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,510
It'll go up after...

686
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,600
You can now encounter the pattern 666.

687
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,800
If you score it at the slot machine, you'll lose...

688
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,320
All buddy in that route.

689
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,640
Why did they...

690
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,900
Why did they do that?

691
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,220
the amount of six six six oh

692
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:46,500

treasures, and sevens

694
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,430
This one seems maybe the best.

695
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,630
Be right back.

696
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,250
What do we have here?

697
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,810
Cat food!

698
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,730
Treasure picture.

699
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,470
Snake eyes.

700
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,670
Thank you for the super tight.

701
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,030
Treasures manifest more often, plus two for the rest of the current deadline.

702
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,590
Consumes all charges when triggered.

703
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,310
Recharges one at the end of every round.

704
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,250
Grandma's purse.

705
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,650
Interest increases by 15% but decreases by 3% after every round.

706
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,310
15%.

707
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,290
Oh, ew.

708
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,410
Discard this charm when its bonus is zero.

709
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,330
Oh, we got the number two!

710
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,790
But we need the number one.

711
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,590
We need the number one.

712
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,940
Purs is pretty good, is it?

713
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,620
Oh my gosh, this sound is so annoying.

714
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,760
I don't want to set my tickets to zero.

715
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,300
Wait.

716
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,000
How much are they?

717
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,900
I feel I will be at a loss.

718
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,180
I would be at a complete loss.

719
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,060
I was able to watch a birthday concert while on a trip.

720
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,560
In the middle of nowhere, Minnesota.

721
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,760
Wow, thank you for watching.

722
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,880
Enjoy your camping trip.

723
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,520
One free restock.

724
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,140
Yeah, but like...

725
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,520
These don't seem bad.

726
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,260
Oh my god, I hate this.

727
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,100
I think I'm gonna do this half the base chance.

728
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:32,840
Oh wait.

729
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,140
Oh, it half's the base chance.

730
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,220
Oh, I didn't read it properly.

731
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,520
Oh, these suck.

732
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,840
Oh my god.

733
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,460
No!

734
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,060
These are terrible.

735
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,790
I guess re-roll, but we lose two tickets.

736
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,100
Hmm.

737
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:23,700
you don't have to take a red call you can ignore it but it's so annoying the little bink bink bink bink bink bink half equals more bells okay okay

738
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:47,480
that is that is an option if we want the bell build Spend tickets in double money?

739
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,280
Wait, yeah, that's a good idea too.

740
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,380
Yeah, actually we'll do that.

741
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,760
Because I think that would be way better.

742
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,340
Actually.

743
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,820
Um, be right back.

744
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:10,910
I think cat food...

745
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,190
I don't know.

746
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,990
We have two slots left.

747
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,550
So we have to make it count.

748
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,350
I can't hear the phone from back here.

749
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,810
And then I can reset too.

750
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,710
Is there any of these that you think I just...

751
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,930
None of us treasured...

752
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:29,790
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

753
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,370
Granny purse and cat food is what you guys are saying.

754
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,450
I can reroll for free even.

755
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,130
So...

756
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:44,490
Hmm.

757
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,980
Two more spins is good.

758
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,400
It is good.

759
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,260
You guys are right.

760
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:08,760
The purse The purse I guess is a nice Temporary thing Right Is there anything here that I'm like Anymore

761
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,120
One free restock Oh this is the pentacle is giving me the restock

762
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:33,480
This bonus grows by one Whenever five plus patterns Triggered during a spin I don't think I've had any of that I don't think I've had any of that I don't think that's happened to me yet.

763
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,280
Charms will trigger randomly activate double more often.

764
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:36,640
That's right.

765
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:36,960
That's right.

766
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,000
And 3% of my interest.

767
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,260
So horseshoe, good, good, good.

768
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,180
What was this one?

769
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,240
This one's good too.

770
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,520
Oh, and the coin.

771
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,780
Everything so far is okay.

772
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,040
So the bell maybe.

773
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:47,700
The bell.

774
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,820
The bell is a nice...

775
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,000
If we have a bell build, then it kind of works.

776
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,580
Compounding interest in this game is really good.

777
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,140
I think I will go with Garam.

778
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,420
I don't want to lose the rest of my tickets.

779
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,260
I would like to spend them on something bigger, but it would be good to have more interest.

780
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,380
And it'll disappear eventually, so...

781
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,460
But we could just...

782
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,760
You know what?

783
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,620
I think I'll re-roll.

784
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,700
Let's see what we get.

785
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,540
Let's see what we get.

786
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,220
Let's see what we get.

787
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,280
Lost a briefcase.

788
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,500
Doesn't take space.

789
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,240
Immediately earned 30% of the money.

790
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,660
of the debt amount.

791
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:43,440
Oh?

792
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,860
And it doesn't take space?

793
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,650
Holy Bible.

794
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:51,410
Ambitious.

795
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,830
Patterns multiplier plus one.

796
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,850
If a 666 is going to trigger, transforms it into a normal symbols.

797
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,210
Then you have 50% chance of discarding this charm.

798
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,500
I see.

799
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:06,860
Hmm.

800
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,320
No, don't.

801
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:07,960
No, don't.

802
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,420
Triggers randomly.

803
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,260
Wait, I got the red pepper before, didn't I?

804
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,720
Maybe.

805
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,440
I got a pepper before.

806
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,660
Fluck plus five for the current spin.

807
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,680
Discard after 12 activations.

808
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,780
And then mushrooms.

809
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:32,520
During every spin increases all symbols by their base value for every pattern triggered after the second...

810
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,720
Resets at the end of every round.

811
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,180
So what if we did...

812
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,660
So this doesn't take up space?

813
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,300
It actually doesn't?

814
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,880
So I could get both.

815
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,340
these the bible and the briefcase

816
00:57:52,500 --> 00:58:03,200
it's broken let's go well we're trying to use up all of my tickets anyway so and then we double our money

817
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,260

818
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:27,050

819
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,650
Thank you, Vito.

820
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:31,970
You're welcome!

821
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,970
I don't do much, I'm just here.

822
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,530
How much is it?

823
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:41,670
28.

824
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:43,610
Wait.

825
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,390
The 666.

826
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,780
Oh, oh!

827
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,140
Oh my gosh, I lost track!

828
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,720
Okay, it didn't let me, it didn't let me put in anymore.

829
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,580
Okay, cool.

830
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,780
My interest.

831
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,480
Okay, alright.

832
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,720
We're building interest.

833
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,260
Wow!

834
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,320
Easy!

835
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,220
Um...

836
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,420
Should I do the three spins?

837
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,300
Because if I do the three spins, I get more...

838
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,160
Tickets.

839
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,880
And I get two extra spins.

840
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,340
So...

841
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,240
Mero, thank you so much for the...

842
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,140
Retherwork, thank you!

843
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,180
Thank you, thank you.

844
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,880
You don't have space for anything though.

845
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:39,860
I guess that's true.

846
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,360
The most valuable thing you can give someone is a bit of your time.

847
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:45,540
What?

848
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,580
Okay, I guess seven.

849
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,420
I guess seven.

850
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,840
Let's go gambling.

851
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,340
Let's go gambling.

852
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,580
Wee!

853
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,420
Oh!

854
00:59:59,020 --> 00:59:59,620
Oh!

855
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:03,550
Oh!

856
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:04,670
Oh!

857
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:06,750
Oh!

858
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:06,970
Oh!

859
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:07,950
Oh!

860
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,640
Yippee!

861
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,340
Yippee!

862
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,160
Ah!

863
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:21,940
Oh, sorry.

864
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:22,900
That scared me.

865
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,920
Doop doop.

866
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,660
Uh-oh.

867
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,080
I got lucky once.

868
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,980
I got lucky once and never again.

869
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:52,420
Okay.

870
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,260
No way.

871
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:04,370
Badoop.

872
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,370
Oh my

873
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,540
god!

874
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,610
Oh, oh, father!

875
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:46,990
Thank you!

876
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,490
Wait, it says put things in the drawer.

877
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:00,390
What does that mean?

878
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,470
Can I get them back?

879
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,570
Holy cow!

880
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,930
Lucky, I was lucky once.

881
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,770
We got a fruit basket.

882
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:14,530
What's that do?

883
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,630
And Book of Shadows.

884
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:16,510
Oh my gosh.

885
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,230
Corpse part.

886
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,470
Wait, these are two.

887
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,010
I love fruits basket anime.

888
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,350
And then I love corpse party.

889
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:28,070
1.5% chance of seeing a 666.

890
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,530
Whenever you see a 666.

891
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,110
You gain plus three spins.

892
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,570
And then plus two.

893
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,290
And then plus one.

894
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,790
10 plus 0!

895
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,630
Resets to plus 3.

896
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,390
Spins at round end.

897
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,370
That's scary.

898
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:59,110
Patterns with fruits trigger an additional time.

899
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,370
Discard after seven rounds.

900
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:02,670
Oh, I see.

901
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,110
Well, right now we're still kind of faux.

902
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,410
Um, I think I'll deposit the rest.

903
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:13,710
Wow, okay.

904
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:17,830
You can never have enough, am I right?

905
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,310
You now need to reach the amount of...

906
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:24,510
2,222!

907
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,930
Oh!

908
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,870
How are things going?

909
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,090
Increase the amount...

910
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,610
This really is Bellatro, isn't it?

911
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:46,690
This is... This really is if Bellatro and Buckshot Roulette had a baby!

912
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:52,210
Increase the value of patterns with three or less symbols by their base value.

913
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:54,990
I need to be there!

914
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,110
Bells manifest more often!

915
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,690
Plus one permanently.

916
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:00,310
I need money!

917
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:03,030
Treasures manifest more often permanently.

918

922
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,330
I don't...

923
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,230
My FOMO.

How do I unlock it?

938
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,540
You don't have the key.

939
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,640
Is this the key to the drawer?

940
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:40,920

946
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:49,780

01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:52,660
Wait.

949
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,040
Oh!

950
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,480
Oh!

951
01:05:59,440 --> 01:05:59,440
Real?

952
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,300
Chat!

953
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,660
Chat.

954
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,580
Is this real?

955
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,620
Chat.

956
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:15,020
Is this real?

957
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,760
Don't make me take my meds.

958
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,440
What do we do then?

959
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,380
What do we do?

960
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:39,010
I like the one free restock, but I think this is our weakest link at the moment.

961
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,320
Gonna need a big red circle to figure out what you're talking about.

962
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,640
Do you see it?

963
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,300
Do you see it?

964
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:54,840
Uh...

965
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,840
I

966
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,120
think the pentacle needs to be thrown away.

967
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,660
The cat isn't needed right now.

968
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,960
No, I think the cat is pretty good.

969
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,320
I think.

970
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,140
I think the cat is good.

971
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,360
The cat is an investment.

972
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,700
The cat is something that we grow and nurture.

973
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:27,860
Coin?

974
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,040
One extra spin, then luck plus four for that spin.

975
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:34,460
Hmm.

976
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,080
I feel like I need the luck.

977
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,970
I feel like I need the luck, but...

978
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,860
Well, we're gonna have to get rid of two things eventually, huh?

979
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,340
Only 10% chance.

980
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,960
I think that's a pretty high chance, no?

981
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,120
Alright, goodbye.

982
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,520
Wait, why don't I get anything for it?

983
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,040
If I put...

984
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,460
Oh, okay.

985
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,280
There is no drawer available.

986
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,480
All right.

987
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,560
Goodbye coin.

988
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,100
It's 20% with the horseshoe.

989
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,720
Oh, that's right!

990
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,840
That's right.

991
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,180
Don't you have a charm that gives you sevens?

992
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,060
No, I did not buy that.

993
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,900
I did not buy it.

994
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:37,870
Ah, cat food!

995
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:39,510
My plus two spins!

996
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,970
we could eat the cat food.

997
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:52,490
Minkidie.

998
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,050
Minkidie.

999
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,630
I think we'll get it again.

1000
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,370
It's pretty common, it seems.

1001
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,630
So, okay.

1002
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:15,320
I didn't expect the cat food to be so juicy.

1003
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,180
All right, let's get some coins.

1004
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,980

Now.

1014
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,900
Oh, it won't let me.

1015
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,240
Okay.

01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,160

Wait, so do I press it again?

1023
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,320
When do I press it?

1024
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:10,040
Like, uh, I can't tell what the charge is at.

1025
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,260
It's active?

1026
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,180
Is it because of this?

1027
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,140
Okay.

1028
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,120

01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,140
I guess because we used it for the first time.

1040
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,660
Let's see what we got here.

1041
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:26,520
Stonks!

1042
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,360
5% to your interest.

1043
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:30,780
Golden diamond.

1044
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:31,920

01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,360

01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,540
But what would I get rid of?

1054
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,620
Do we stop being a bell build?

1055
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,300
Do we stop the bell build and just become a stonks build?

1056
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,640
If that were the case, I wish I'd get the cat food.

1057
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,740
No, why my horseshoe?

1058
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,440

You guys are right that it doesn't show up so, so often.

1062
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:00,960
Goodbye, coin.

1063
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,680
Why is it so juicy?

1064
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,540

1100
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:23,650
He's wrong because you have the makings of a varsity athlete.

Let's go gambling.

1114
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,960
Quasimodo predicted all this.

1115
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,120
What are you talking about?

01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,300

Holy money!

We do.

1123
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:55,500
Big payout!

1124
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,160
This is your last chance to deposit your coins now!

1125
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,100
Yes, sir.

01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,620
12,000!

1127
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,780
Seems like a fair amount to reach your final reward?

1128
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,280
Mushy, mushy!

1129
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:26,820

01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,420
Double jackpot's value.

1131
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,120
Diamonds manifest more often, permanently.

1132
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,380
Double the value of lemons and cherries.

1133
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:40,340
No!

1134
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:40,920

1135
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:41,560
No!

1136
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,880
Oh yeah, we're gonna re-roll here.

1137
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,140
It's expensive!

1138
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,020
It's four!

1139
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,000
It's four tickets.

1140
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,960
I only have nine.

1141
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,420

1142
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:03,420

Car battery.

1149

Oh!

1150
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,120
It doesn't take space.

1151
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:20,040
Oh, but it's still too.

1152
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:37,530
I do have full charms, but I could, like, take it and then reroll.

1153
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,450
There could be something, like, you know, good that shows up.

1182
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:35,050
Never!

1183
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,110
I've never been to a real casino before!

1184
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,030
I think I would win.

1185
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,270
Yeah.

1186
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,320

1195
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:36,970

01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:54,890
I got mail.

1202
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:01,410
Why do you keep doing this to me?

1203
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,390
Oh,

1204
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:12,930
big money.

1205
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:20,990
Up into a real casino in Reno, the only way to win is to play the penny slots and just rake in free drinks for as long as your money lasts.

1206
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,810
Wait, you can play for just a penny?

1207
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,190
What?

1208
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:29,390
Really?

1209
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:32,930
That sounds...

1210
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:36,010
I could just go outside and find a penny and come back in.

1211
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:39,490
And then I win more.

1212
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,490
We still have them.

1213
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:48,550
We still have them.

1214
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:53,230
This is messed up.

1215
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:54,450
This is messed up.

1216
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:58,910
Oh, man.

1217
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,830
That was terrible, guys.

1218
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,650
That was no good.

1219
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:05,050
That was no good.

1220
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:06,030
Oh, no.

1221
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:06,810
Oh, my.

1222
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:10,410
Oh, whoops.

1223
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,230
We gotta make...

1224
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:23,790
This is not good.

1225
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,590
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.

1226
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:32,730
I got 12 coins.

1227
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:37,390
Yeah, we love to see it.

1228
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:38,610
We love the bells.

1229
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:40,450
Oh my god.

1230
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,950
Oh my god.

1231
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:43,990
Guys, I'm scared.

1232
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:45,930
I'm not scared anymore.

1233
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:47,350
I'm not scared anymore!

1234
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,710
I'm not scared anymore!

1235
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:11,630
Always believe in bell build.

1236
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,420
Thank you!

1237
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,720
Thank you!

1238
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:23,840
Thank you!

1239
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,900
The deadline is now!

1240
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:28,920
Okay.

1241
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,760
Oh, not now.

1242
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,860
It won't let me do it anymore.

1243
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:37,380
That's funny.

1244
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:39,700
Awesome.

1245
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,760
Awesome, awesome.

1246
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:47,160
Yay!

1247
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,360
And it looks like you've earned your reward.

1248
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,520
Go get it!

1249
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:53,260
Oh.

1250
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,160
More?

1251
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,120
Okay.

1252
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,240
So does that unlock?

1253
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,440
Do you want to keep playing?

1254
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,220
Yes?

1255
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,980
I like your winner mentality.

1256
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:06,700
Go on!

1257
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,020
Oh.

1258
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:14,370
Wait, open this.

1259
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:16,890
Wait, I guess I... Wait, could I have begun the game?

1260
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:17,810
Wait.

1261
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:24,320
Wait, could I have... Could I have... Could I have left?

1262
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,880
Is this her first run?

1263
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:36,980
Yes.

1264
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,040
That's... Wait.

1265
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,320
What if I just unplug it?

1266
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,820
I've earned the electrician.

1267
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:55,240
Plus 5% chance for the battery modifier to be applied to any symbol.

1268
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,660
Decrease by 1% at the end of every round.

1269
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:01,740
What?

1270
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,160
Okay, shut up!

1271
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,320
Shut up!

1272
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,800
Double the value of lemons, cherries.

1273
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,200
Lucky charms at the store are discounted by two tickets until the next restock.

1274
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,380
I will be right back.

1275
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:23,800
Megaphone.

1276
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,800
that you pick up at the telephone trigger one more time.

1277
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:31,740
It's a legendary.

1278
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,800
I don't have enough.

1279
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,740
And I'm still full.

1280
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,840
Actually, the Bible is like holding on to dear life.

1281
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,820
Last three deadlines, then discard this charm.

1282
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:49,700
At the end of each deadline gives as many tickets as the deadlines left to this charm.

1283
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,140
Now three, okay.

1284
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:58,920
You guys said the Bible's not worth it, but the Bible has saved my butt, baby.

1285
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,620
Put the mega in storage.

1286
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,560
You're so right.

1287
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,400
You're so right.

1288
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,100
You're so right.

1289
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,260
Okay, so we'll buy it and we can put it in the drawer.

1290
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,280
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1291
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,400
Because then if we can get more diamond stuff.

1292
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,760
Okay, I'm not going to do the phone.

1293
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,620
I'm not going to do the phone.

1294
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:23,000
Because I would have to re-roll.

1295
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:23,780
Oh, wait.

1296
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:24,460
Wait a second.

1297
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:27,140
Yo, I can make things discounted!

1298
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,960
I can discount them and then I can buy it!

1299
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1300
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,680
So we'll discount it.

1301
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:42,160
Okay, thank you.

1302
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,380
And then we'll get you.

1303
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,260
Make some space.

1304
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,600
Before equipping other garbage.

1305
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:54,300
Info.

1306
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,260
It's just a drawer.

1307
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:56,460
You can put things inside of it.

1308
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,760
Oh, I have to put something.

1309
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,500
Okay, do I have to switch it out?

1310
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,120
Alright.

1311
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:01,520
Put in drawer.

1312
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:03,860
Okay.

1313
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,360
Bye.

1314
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,980
Put in drawer.

1315
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,080
Oh, wait.

1316
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:17,700
Uh.

1317
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,080
Equip.

1318
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:22,800
Uh.

1319
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,780
I can't just swap them.

1320
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:14,490
I think the Pentacle can go.

1321
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,390
But I like our free restock.

1322
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:17,610
It's quite nice.

1323
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,630
Our free restock has been pretty good.

1324
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:29,150
Congrats on your birthday.

1325
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:30,090
Thank you.

1326
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:32,670
It's on the road during the live stream, so I missed info.

1327
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,070
Where do I redeem this voucher?

1328
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:35,790
Whom?

1329
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:36,630
Whom?

1330
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:37,870
Whom?

1331
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,140
Horseshoe!

1332
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,320
You guys!

1333
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,420
The horseshoe is giving us plus three interest!

1334
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,340
We are on an interest run!

1335
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:50,720
Shut your mouths!

1336
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:57,500
Unless I get something else that will give me even more interest, we're keeping the horseshoe!

1337
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,690
What do you mean Bell not needed anymore?

1338
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,610
We- we- we're- we have a Bell build!

1339
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,490
What are you talking about?

1340
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:23,270
What are you talking about?

1341
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:27,090
Well, I guess it is only plus three coin, huh?

1342
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:30,430
Whatever.

1343
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:32,910
You're supposed to build it up, but I don't get any.

1344
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:38,370
This one doesn't actually add that much, huh?

1345
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:41,730
This one's like really in for the long haul.

1346
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:43,450
Hmm.

1347
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:51,050
Adds to the value of the bell, but only sometimes.

1348
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:55,370
Only sometimes.

1349
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,800
Wait, why do I have six slots now?

1350
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:08,280
Wait, what happened?

1351
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:08,900
Huh?

1352
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,200
Wait, what happened?

1353
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,620
Oh, my Bible.

1354
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:21,160
Oh, God, I'm going to die.

1355
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,360
I'm going to lose it all.

1356
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,180
I'm gonna lose it!

1357
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:28,540
Oh, megaphone is minus one slot.

1358
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:42,280
Anyway, well, we'll just hope and pray.

1359
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,360
We'll just hope and pray.

1360
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:47,500
140.

1361
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,880
I guess it does let you.

1362
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:57,780
Let's just see where...

1363
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:00,420
Let's do this round and see what we're looking like.

1364
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:02,300
Let's go.

1365
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:02,840
You know?

1366
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:11,170
I really don't know what is...

1367
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:11,630
Oh, okay.

1368
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:12,530
That's it.

1369
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,910
Oh, I can't trigger it yet, can I?

1370
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,350
Not yet.

1371
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:19,590
Oh, my battery.

1372
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,830
Oh, my battery.

1373
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,270
Okay.

1374
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,050
Oh, wait.

1375
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,590
This is fine.

1376
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,550
This is good.

1377
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:34,730
Holy cow!

1378
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:41,260
Don't do this to me.

1379
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:49,650
76.

1380
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:51,690
76.

1381
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:55,610
Oh, come on.

1382
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,270
Well, we did hit it big enough.

1383
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,390

1384
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,110

Thank you, thank you.

1388
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:10,290
Now what do we have here?

1389
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,930
Raging capitalist!

1390
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:14,210
Three?

1391
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:15,170
How do you get this?

1392
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:19,330
Scoring 30 times any modified luck or bell in a single run.

1393
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:21,330
3% chance.

1394
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:26,270
Oh, plus 3% chance for the ticket modifier.

1395
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:27,570
What is that?

1396
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:59,970

Is that correct?

1398
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:08,210
Yes.

1399
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:08,710
Okay.

1400
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,250
The 7K.

1401
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:11,710
Right.

1402
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,630
So.

01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:13,810
Okay.

1404
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:14,510
Okay.

1405
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:14,710
Okay.

1406
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,980
Why is it letting me deposit?

1407
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:28,980
Wait, how much do I have?

1408
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,820
Oh, it's 100.

1409

Okay.

1410
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:30,520
Wait.

1411
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,600
Why is it letting me deposit more?

1412
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,240
That's scary.

1413
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:35,620
Wait, what?

1414
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,120
No, I was at 5 spins.

1415
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:38,680
Oh my gosh.

1416
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:38,940
Wait.

1417
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:39,580
Ah!

Yo, you said.

1419
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,240
to stop me before.

1420
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,140
Now it's not.

1421
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,160
Oh my gosh.

1422
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:44,940
Okay, okay, okay.

1423
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,920
I understand now.

1424
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:50,080
Okay.

1425
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:52,160
Okay, okay.

1426
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:52,900
It changed.

1427
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:53,620
It changed.

1428
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,200
Oh my gosh.

1429
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:54,700
Scary.

1430
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:55,940
Scary!

1431
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,400
It didn't tell me!

1432
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:58,780
Oh!

1433
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,020
You have learned.

1434
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:01,880
I learned!

1435
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:02,880
I learned!

1436
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:03,600
I learned!

1437
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,040
You guys can't get mad at me.

1438
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:05,940
How could I know?

1439
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:08,660
Alright.

1440
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,160
Alright.

1441
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:09,540
Alright.

1442
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,060
We need still a lot.

1443
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:18,980
Scary.

1444
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:19,840
Okay.

1445
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:29,750
I got mail.

1446
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,450
Help!

1447
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:35,250
Getting ice cream.

1448
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,390
Do you want chocolate or waffle crunch?

1449
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:38,950
Chocolate!

1450
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:42,670
Not good.

1451
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:48,090
Not good!

1452
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:53,650
Bad, bad.

1453
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:54,750
Oh, very bad.

1454
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:56,630
Oh,

1455
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:01,910
but I got plus 4,000.

1456
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:05,010
I forget that we get the interest at the end.

1457
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:06,730
Honestly?

1458
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:10,170
Okay, there we go.

1459
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:11,210
Okay, okay.

1460
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,510
With the interest, I think we'll be okay.

1461
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:16,510
interest!

1462
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:19,830
I'm gonna spin this, because we have it.

1463
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:21,870
Book of Shadows.

1464
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,340
Come.

1465
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:38,100
Hmm.

1466
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,700
Do you see that amount?

1467
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,500
That's right, right?

1468
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,340
Oh yeah, what's here, too?

1469
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:23,960
button all lucky charms triggered by the red button trigger one more time oh negative one to charms so legendary it seems maybe legendary charms take up a space interesting that was a lot of money that was a lot of money we could skip this round i think it might honestly be safer so that i can Get more...

1470
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,840
I don't know.

1471
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,260
I don't know.

1472
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,960
Do a short run?

1473
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,420
But what if I lose it all?

1474
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,030
What if I lose it all?

1475
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,940
Interest will cover you.

1476
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:57,620
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

1477
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,460
That's true, that's true.

1478
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,040
That's true, that's true.

1479
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,820
But it's so much money I'll lose.

1480
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,820
Okay, let's go gambling.

1481
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,120
Seven spins?

1482
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,440
Three spins.

1483
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:22,480
Oh!

1484
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:26,720
Oh!

1485
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,180
Stop!

1486
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:29,780
Seven.

1487
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:32,300
Let's go gambling.

1488
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,740

01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,940
Let's go, gambling!

1494
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:09,300
And last spin!

1495
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,980
I'm going to Vegas!

1496
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:29,840
I'm

1497
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,130
going to Vegas, baby!

1498
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,120
Oh my gosh, we're already halfway there.

1499
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,320
Whoa!

1500
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,500
We're already halfway there!

1501
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:49,560
Whoa, whoa!

1502
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:59,850
Oh my god.

1503
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:04,940
Let's go.

1504
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:05,900
Oh, my bad.

1505
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,100
That's not what I meant to do.

1506
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,100
Um...

1507
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,360
What we got going on here?

1508
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,340
Oh, we got the capitalist guy.

1509
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,980
Ra- Oh, no, that's raging.

1510
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:18,660
That's- It's like- It's like raging Raven.

1511
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,460
Your greed sickens me.

1512
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:26,780
3% to my interest!

1513
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,500
20% chance for Clovers to have a golden modifier.

1514
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,700
No, no, no!

1515
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,720
Luck plus 5 on next spin if the previous two had no reward.

1516
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:40,440
Plus 2 extra luck for every in-sequence activation after the first one.

1517
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:42,860
Minto and her lair.

1518
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:46,780
Please.

1519
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:49,720
No.

1520
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:52,340
Oh, I can't reroll, you guys.

1521
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,140
I can't reroll.

1522
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,920
We could do this one.

1523
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,980
Increases the value of patterns with three or less symbols.

1524
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:05,400
That overall helps.

1525
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,720
So, I think that's the one we should go with.

1526
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,360
I'm thinking of some strategies.

1527
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:12,960
Yeah, alright.

1528
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:16,700
I'm thinking of some strategies.

1529
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,140
This is still loading.

1530
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,580
I couldn't re-roll because I do not have enough tickets.

1531
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:31,200
It was, um, it was, uh, it was six tickets.

1532
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,960
But I will re-roll here.

1533
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:36,720
Oh, I mean, I don't have any space.

1534
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,820
I don't have any space.

1535
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,720
It's very scary.

1536
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:42,560
How much is it?

1537
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:43,060
Mine, okay.

1538
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:49,920
Hope for a battery.

1539
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,860
That's a good, that's a good plan.

1540
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:52,800
Let's try that.

1541
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:53,740
Bada-dang!

1542
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,160
Nothing.

1543
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:01,820
Let's go gambling.

1544
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:23,760
Wow this would have been great wait we're 3,000 away I think we're interest is literally gonna cover us so I think we're gonna be okay that was my last spin wasn't it

1545
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:35,170
You naughty!

1546
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,580
Dump the megaphone.

1547
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:43,400
The megaphone!

1548
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,100
Actually, just remember how we did that plus one to each thing?

1549
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,140
Actually, it doubled it, so it's not so bad.

1550
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:02,150
Holy cow!

1551
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:04,030
Oh my gosh!

1552
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:08,610
I want a jackpot!

1553
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:11,090
I want a jackpot!

1554
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:24,200
Well, my very first Japan trip and go to Haki Haribaru today as the resident expert.

1555
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,120
Is there any places you think are must-see?

1556
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:28,320
Ah, wait.

1557
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,480
Do you like grapes?

1558
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,160
It's grape season right now, right?

1559
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,840
For fruits?

1560
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:38,440
Fruit, fruit, fruit de season is a great parfait place.

1561
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:39,720
I love it.

1562
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,550
I think it's grapes right now.

1563
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:47,560
Hold on.

1564
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:49,480
Let me see.

1565
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,460
Let me see what the...

1566
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,120
They have like a little...

1567
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,120
Calendar.

1568
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,540
Fruits do season.

1569
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,190
I can't remember that.

1570
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,340
Not tabi log.

1571
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,620
Where's your calendar at?

1572
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,760
What happened?

1573
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:19,180
I always recommend this place.

1574
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,600
It's so yummy.

1575
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,060
Maybe I should write it in Japanese.

1576
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:33,860
Food.

1577
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:35,100
Food.

1578
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:40,440
Season.

1579
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,420
There we go.

1580
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:49,940
A I feel so French when I say it.

1581
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:53,080
Yeah, Budo Parfait, it has started.

1582
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,000
Wait, that's 9th.

1583
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:00,540
Wait, wait, wait.

1584
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:02,520
Ah!

1585
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:09,660
I think it's a grapes.

1586
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,200
French.

1587
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:15,500
I can't find the calendar.

1588
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,240
It says, budo, that's grape.

1589
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:22,940
Budo, perfect.

1590
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,320
But, let me click menu.

01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,620
What the heck is that?

1594
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:46,420
You can get grapes or you can get, I think this is a Japanese pair.

1595
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:52,460
Yes, I believe that's Japanese pair, and then there's one other thing, but I don't recognize what that is.

1596
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,340
Persimmon, maybe?

1597
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:57,920
Hmm, so there's three different parfaits you can get in October.

1598
01:46:58,720 --> 01:46:59,200

01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,960
Oh, my entry.

1604
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:22,040

01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:12,690
This game is so fun.

1610
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,070
Oh my gosh, sorry.

1611
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:19,980

1612
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:23,860
I got something.

1613
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:24,640
Something just happened.

1614
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:25,380
Oh, it's recharged.

1615
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:25,940
That's what that meant.

1616
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:30,260
What if we unlock an iron?

1617
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:41,020
wrong 20 chance for the any bell to have the ticket modifier unlockable by scoring 50 modified bells oh

1618
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:53,420
uh what does this modifier do oh wait it literally tells me ticket modifier scoring a symbol with this modifier earns you a ticket

1619
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:05,800
i don't want to lose 41 000 i'm scared Ah!

1620
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,200
How scared!

1621
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,380
You won't.

1622
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,400
But if I get 666, I will.

1623
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,080
Oh, 666 is only current spin round.

1624
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:23,860
Wait, what do you mean?

1625
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:36,490
Oh, you only lose in the...

1626
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,710
So I can't lose all of this.

1627
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:39,550
Oh!

1628
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:43,970
I thought I lost everything that was in my pockets!

1629
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:48,390
Like they took me by my ankles and shook me out.

1630
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:49,410
Oh.

1631
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:55,580
I see.

1632
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,480
The reason why I'm not cashing this in right now is because if I deposit it, I'm immediately going into the next round.

1633
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,000
So we're farming a little bit.

1634
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:10,880
But I think it would be good to get some more tickets.

1635
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,020
But we're fine too.

1636
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:13,640
We're fine too.

1637
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:14,560
Okay.

1638
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,380
Let's go gambling.

1639
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:18,520
Let's go gambling.

1640
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:18,820
Hi.

1641
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:39,220
maybe i should have saved that um you know maybe i'm stupid whatever save the button for next round uh too late it's okay we're just gonna get a lot of money baby oh i completely forgot that we were like on the last round um don't worry about it

1642
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,680
thank you

1643
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,300
Don't worry about it.

1644
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:55,880
Don't worry about it.

1645
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:01,180
We got a lot of money.

1646
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,700
I think we're okay.

1647
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,740
What happens next if I don't put in the money?

1648
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:08,640
What happens next?

1649
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:12,940
200,000?

1650
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,030
Oh, it's still only 196.

1651
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:34,510
Okay.

1652
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:54,700
I think...

1653
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,560
I don't know if I should take any of these.

1654
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:03,520
I have cherries manifest more often, diamonds manifest more often, and sevens manifest more often.

1655
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,580
I can't reroll, unfortunately.

1656
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,800
I don't have enough tickets.

1657
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,440
Hold on, I'm gonna move my head, like maybe here.

1658
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:13,740
This is a better spot.

1659
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:14,500
Maybe?

1660
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:23,760
Don't take any?

1661
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:24,660
I think so.

1662
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:25,520
What do we have here?

1663
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:27,720
Oh!

1664
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:29,640
Wait.

1665
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:31,060
It's... Oh!

1666
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:31,600
Wait!

1667
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:32,260
Wait!

1668
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:32,960
Wait!

1669
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:33,540
Wait!

1670
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:34,920
Wait!

1671
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,780
We get free money!

1672
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,460
And that would be enough to reroll!

1673
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:46,040
Well, lucky time triggers during a spin raise this bonus by one.

1674
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,720
If nothing triggers, reset this bonus.

1675
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:49,980
bad.

1676
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,580
I have enough room.

1677
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,440
I'm gonna re-roll here, though, and see what we get.

1678
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,300
Oh, we got the nuclear button.

1679
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:14,100
All lucky terms triggered by the red button triggered one more time.

1680
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,240
That'd be crazy.

1681
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,420
Do you guys think I should re-roll?

1682
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:35,840
Yeah, you're right.

1683
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:39,640
We do have to use the The megaphone.

1684
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,860
We have it.

1685
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:47,200
Add the florid trait to a random lucky charm.

1686
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:53,000
Restore all charm.

1687
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:54,880
Oh.

1688
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:56,820
Oh.

1689
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:57,620
Oh.

1690
01:53:59,000 --> 01:53:59,160
Oh.

1691
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:00,240
Um.

1692
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:03,700
Wait, this is good because we...

1693
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:05,300
I accidentally used it.

1694
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:07,540
So...

1695
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:08,140
Um.

1696
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,680
But then...

1697
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:13,060
With this, I would get it on two different things.

1698
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,160
When dead...

1699
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:16,580
Oh, this is tough.

1700
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,180
Because the megaphone would double it.

1701
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:24,020
That is a lot.

1702
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,140
That would be like plus four every time.

1703
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:30,830
Two is good for long term.

1704
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,470
I agree.

1705
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:40,830
Double jackpot's value.

1706
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:43,050
I haven't gotten jackpot even once.

1707
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:44,930
I don't know what the value is.

1708
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:47,410
Okay, let's go.

1709
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,290
What's this one then?

1710
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,350
Are we betting colors now?

1711
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:53,630
Whoa!

1712
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:55,570
Everything's so shiny!

1713
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:00,370
Plus two when deadline ends.

1714
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:02,170
Plus two when deadline ends!

1715
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:02,830
Let's go!

1716
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:05,050
Awesome.

1717
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:07,390
And we're at 22,000.

1718
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:11,750
So I need 50,000 to win.

1719
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:16,780
Let's go.

1720
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,620
I did accidentally use this.

1721
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:20,220
My bad.

1722
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:28,360
Yeah, I am getting mad interest.

1723
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:29,320
It's kind of insane.

1724
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,840
It's kind of super insane.

1725
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:38,380
Oh, don't scare me.

1726
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,280
Come on, cat.

1727
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,700
I need you.

1728
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:52,800
Still not bad.

1729
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:09,310

01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:28,680

1733
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:47,680
Wait, you couldn't see?

1734
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:49,120
Oh, my bad.

1735
01:56:54,410 --> 01:56:55,370
I'm so sorry.

1736
01:56:56,270 --> 01:56:58,110
Wow, this...

1737
01:56:58,450 --> 01:56:59,630
This is pretty terrible.

1738
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:02,710
That's okay.

1739
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:03,250
We're fine.

1740
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,830
We're fine.

1741
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:08,570
Yikes.

1742

Yikes forever.

1743
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:14,770
Yikes forever.

1744
01:57:15,850 --> 01:57:16,470

It seriously shocks me every time.

1750

I love a bell move.

1751
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,140
Imagine if I lost it all.

1752
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,040

Cool.

1758
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:58,170
Let's double the value of clovers and bells.

1759
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:58,890
Let's go.

1760
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:03,230
Yes.

1761
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:08,350
And actually, that will even double it more because I have the megaphone.

1762
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:13,970
Thank you, megaphone.

1763
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:16,290
Thank you, megaphone, right?

1764
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,470
Right?

1765
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:22,310
816, baby!

1766
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:24,310
What's making that sound?

1767
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:25,890
Oh, the button is.

1768
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:26,230
Okay.

1769
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:27,610
Let's see what we got here.

1770
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:28,230
We got...

1771
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:30,290
I still have not gotten the number one.

1772
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,830
The tarot deck.

1773
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:35,350
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1774
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:36,650
Okay, let's, uh, reroll.

1775
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:38,070
What do we have here?

1776
02:00:38,630 --> 02:00:40,870
Oh, it's a bunch of stuff we've gotten before.

1777
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:41,250
Alright.

1778
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:46,150
Let's go gambling.

1779
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:47,750
Go gambling.

1780
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:49,090
And trigger.

1781
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:53,370
Okay.

1782
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:54,350
That's fine.

1783
02:00:56,510 --> 02:00:57,390
I like that.

1784
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:58,750
The kind of...

1785
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:02,090
Some of the sound effects are annoying, so I don't forget to press the button.

1786
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:02,790
You know what I mean?

1787
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:04,350
Uh-oh.

1788
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,310
Okay.

1789
02:01:12,610 --> 02:01:13,170
Okay.

1790
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:14,730
Okay.

1791
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:15,550
Um.

1792
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:18,370
Ooh.

1793
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:20,070
I got some meds.

1794
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:22,130
Uh-oh!

1795
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:25,950
Ah-oh!

1796
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:30,110
Uh-uh!

1797
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:30,950
Not good.

1798
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:32,190
Um.

1799
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,180
We're almost halfway there.

1800
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:40,700
What are the pills?

1801
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:42,460
Pain killers.

1802
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:48,760
If only one pattern shows during a spin, transform its symbols into the most valued symbol.

1803
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:49,340
Oh!

1804
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:52,860
Unlockable by seeing one single pattern per spin.

1805
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:54,300
What?

1806
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,660
That's pretty good.

1807
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:01,900
Yeah, it is pretty good.

1808
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:06,000
Imagine everything turns into bells.

1809
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:10,620
Oh, come on!

1810
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,720
Oh, come on!

1811
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,870
Okay.

1812
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:41,870
Oh, come on.

1813
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:45,610
I wonder if I'll ever get jackpot.

1814
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,020
I want jackpot one day.

1815
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:51,700
Oh gosh.

1816
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:52,740
This is scary.

1817
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:53,820
This is too scary.

1818
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:00,920
Oh, I don't know, you guys.

1819
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:01,780
I don't know.

1820
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:04,300
Guys.

1821
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:09,440
I don't know, guys.

1822
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,620
I don't know.

1823
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:19,100
It's good that this... I don't...

1824
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:21,120
I have to be so, so lucky.

1825
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:26,320
I have to be so, so lucky.

1826
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:27,610
Not enough coins.

1827
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:29,110
What a shame.

1828
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:35,270
Ah.

1829
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,670
Ah.

1830
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:57,310
Ah, GG.

1831
02:04:57,710 --> 02:05:01,430
That was, I guess, not bad for a first round, I guess, maybe?

1832
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:07,930
Maybe for a first run.

1833
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:09,870
That was pretty okay.

1834
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:12,850
The mystery slowly unravels.

1835
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:13,830
Mortis.

1836
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:17,330
Welcome back.

1837
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:18,230
Time to gamble.

1838
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:20,410
Yeah, I already know how it works.

1839
02:05:20,590 --> 02:05:21,190
Go on.

1840
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:23,930
What did we get?

1841
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:26,090
Oh, wow.

1842
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:26,610
Oh, whoa.

1843
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:34,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I got mail for sure.

1844
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:48,650
Corpse goes on slot plus cannot discard.

1845
02:05:49,930 --> 02:05:51,830
5% debt now.

1846
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:55,690
Oh, wait, 5% debt now is 0%.

1847
02:05:55,690 --> 02:05:58,990
If this piece is inside a drawer at the end of the deadline, discard it.

1848
02:06:07,870 --> 02:06:10,430
Oh my gosh, we're getting Exodia!

1849
02:06:14,690 --> 02:06:16,590
Okay, cool.

1850
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:20,650
Oh, I missed you guys, Stonks and Lucky Cat.

1851
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:22,190
Oh, Stonks.

1852
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:23,330
Let's see what else.

1853
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:23,810
What is this?

1854
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:24,430
The D4.

1855
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:27,750
Exodia's skeleton.

1856
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:29,750
The clicker.

1857
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:31,850
Double A batteries.

1858
02:06:32,630 --> 02:06:33,610
Crystal sphere.

1859
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:35,530
Dear diary.

1860
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:36,750
Skull.

1861
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:38,310
Corpse.

1862
02:06:38,650 --> 02:06:39,790
Corpse two.

1863
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:41,230
Corpse three.

1864
02:06:41,710 --> 02:06:42,690
Corpse four.

1865
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:44,250
So if...

1866
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:44,590
Oh.

1867
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:47,690
All of these are the same.

1868
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:49,770
What's the...

1869
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:51,630
Goes on slot plus cannot discard.

1870
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:57,530
At the end of every deadline, spawn a random free charm in an available drawer for every corpse piece equipped.

1871
02:06:59,210 --> 02:06:59,790
Oh.

1872
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:02,950
How I kind of...

1873
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:04,390
How do you use this?

1874
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:09,010
Plus one option at the telephone.

1875
02:07:10,790 --> 02:07:11,750
Just joining.

1876
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:12,370
Good heavens.

1877
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:13,930
Is that an arm in the drawer?

1878
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:16,210
Don't worry about it.

1879
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:18,990
Crystal sphere.

1880
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:22,870
12% chance for the symbols, those, to have a chain modifier.

1881
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:25,490
Oh.

1882
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:27,730
Oh, here we go.

1883
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:30,210
Double a battery is six?

1884
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:32,030
Oh, sorry.

1885
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:34,730
6% chance for the symbols.

1886
02:07:35,850 --> 02:07:36,650
Ah, the bell.

1887
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:38,290
To have battery modifier.

1888
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:40,710
Restore one charge.

1889
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:43,270
Clicker.

1890
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:45,110
I so...

1891
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,810
The drawer noise is the worst.

1892
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:49,290
15% chance for the symbols.

1893
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:52,150
Lemon cherry to have the repetition modifier.

1894
02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:52,970
Repetition modifier.

1895
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:54,610
Scoring a symbol with this modifier.

1896
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:55,930
Re-triggers patterns.

1897
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:57,150
Containing this symbol.

1898
02:07:57,310 --> 02:07:58,010
Oh, okay, cool.

1899
02:07:59,430 --> 02:08:00,210
Okay, shut up.

1900
02:08:00,270 --> 02:08:00,850
Shut up, shut up.

1901
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:02,070
Okay.

1902
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:09,030
Well, guys, I think I like this game.

1903
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:25,810
I think, honestly, because it is, how do you, what do you, like, it is like Bellatro, but I don't have to think about numbers so much.

1904
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:29,290
I think I like it so much more.

1905
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:34,870
I like to watch the spins.

1906
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,350
I like to watch...

1907
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:43,610
The slot machine go I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it.

1908
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:45,450
It's great if you don't like cards.

1909
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:47,370
That's me, that's me, that's me!

1910
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:54,150
So...

1911
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:03,770
I

1912
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:15,770
had fun You really picked it up fast Is the Vegas arc happening soon?

1913
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:23,350
I'm going to Vegas I'm going to Vegas

1914
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:39,290
In all honesty Because of the nature of my job And how I earn my income I would never go to Vegas Because I wouldn't do that to you guys.

1915
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:45,490
I could never.

1916
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:55,140
I'll come home with no pockets left.

1917
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:00,240
I'll come home with no pockets.

1918
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,760
Too much of a guilty conscious.

1919
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:05,180
Yeah, for real.

1920
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,160
I want to go to Vegas, though.

1921
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:30,220
Just to like I want to see how the the the hotels but like the hotels are kind of like all dying like you know the themed ones like the Luxor and New York New York and what's the haunted one the pyramid

1922
02:10:34,460 --> 02:11:26,720
Gamba funds What if you vlog it Gambling funds No Listen to the song Numbers go off I don't think so Vegas funds No no no Oh isn't that the Luxor Oh oh yeah I was thinking Oh sorry I was thinking MGM I went to Vegas once When I was a little baby wisp And um uh so i obviously couldn't do anything i was just i they were like uh a baby ghost along until minto opens her own casino with blackjack and wifus what's a misanthropy wait do you have the sound thing maybe oh i i can't do certain sounds so i might have a sound thing.

1923
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:31,880
I'm definitely one of those people that can't listen to, like, the sound of people eating.

1924
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,900
And the sound of the fan, honestly, in this I had to turn it down.

1925
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:39,580
It kind of...

1926
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:39,960
Okay.

1927
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:46,160
Like, do you know when you're, like, laying and you can hear your heartbeat?

1928
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,520
It kind of happens with ghosts, too, because of, like, the way ectoplasm works.

1929
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:59,720
But, like, you can hear your heartbeat and your ears, and that's, like, what the sound of fam sounds like to me.

1930
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:00,940
This, you hear it?

1931
02:12:06,970 --> 02:12:08,230
I don't like it.

1932
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:11,470
I hate it.

1933
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:12,350
I hate it.

1934
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:20,410
But, um, I went to Vegas and did not have a good time.

1935
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:28,630
But, I got to pet a baby lion at MGM.

1936
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:30,590
That's where we stayed at.

1937
02:12:31,290 --> 02:12:32,490
I got the pet a baby lion.

1938
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:39,790
But I've heard that all of the themed hotels and stuff now suck.

1939
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:42,050
So it makes me so sad.

1940
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:44,030
And I don't want to go see the sphere.

1941
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:45,850
I think that would make me...

1942
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:48,950
I think that would make me have like...

1943
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:50,230
I don't know.

1944
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:52,890
Like I think I would go into hypnosis from it.

1945
02:12:54,410 --> 02:12:59,570
I would have some sort of mind break that...

1946
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:32,970
about it Vegas has gotten unbelievably expensive in recent years but Gulfport Mississippi has casinos and nice beaches I like beaches it's not the casinos that I'm interested in though it's the fact that the hotels were different themes I'm really into stuff like that Minto mindlessly tapping on the slot machine like the old people are they all iPad run now ah You think you'll ever stream on the sphere?

1947
02:13:33,370 --> 02:13:36,750
I think I've once heard about how much it is to be on the sphere.

1948
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:39,610
And, um...

1949
02:13:39,610 --> 02:13:39,990
No.

1950
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:44,270
But how do they get the dancing cats on there, then?

1951
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:47,690
Are we doing a second run or no?

1952
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:49,730
No, I think that's... I'm going to call it today.

1953
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:51,890
I do have a meeting in a bit, so...

1954
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:54,270
Yeah.

1955
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:57,550
Sorry, a bit of a shorter stream today.

1956
02:13:59,010 --> 02:13:59,410
Okay.

1957
02:14:00,430 --> 02:14:02,630
Sorry, sorry.

1958
02:14:04,150 --> 02:14:05,510
Do you like the Rainforest Cafe too?

1959
02:14:06,190 --> 02:14:08,090
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1960
02:14:08,090 --> 02:14:08,910
Yes, yes, yes!

1961
02:14:09,230 --> 02:14:10,690
Darko thing is over there, the pig!

1962
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:12,310
Pig Dodo for luck.

1963
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:18,890
My luck is, luck is, my luck is literally negative stat, so...

1964
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:21,130
You are now designated Big Mint.

1965
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:24,430
Oh, well, I didn't mean to get bigger mint.

1966
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:31,810
Make it a vlog or some video about exploring Vegas and make it attacks right off.

1967
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:37,290
Phil Matara would join as a great enabler too.

1968
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:40,990
I would go and maybe play like some blackjack.

1969
02:14:45,710 --> 02:14:46,510
No.

1970
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:48,250
Maybe.

1971
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:49,870
No.

1972
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:52,650
No!

1973
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:53,610
I couldn't!

1974
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:54,450
I couldn't!

1975
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:59,130
Don't force me!

1976
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:02,670
I would never

1977
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:20,070
It's only $450,000 for four hours on the sphere Okay, have you guys seen those videos though of like the cats dancing on the sphere Who's paying that then?

1978
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:31,950
Oh Is there any way to hand a gift at your next con I've had this package since last year.

1979
02:15:32,110 --> 02:15:32,370
Who?

1980
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:38,290
I don't remember if I'm doing gifts at...

1981
02:15:38,290 --> 02:15:41,250
Well, the next con I'm doing is the Idol Festival.

1982
02:15:42,490 --> 02:15:45,170
I'm not sure if I'm accepting gifts or not.

1983
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:51,530
It really depends on who is at an event helping me and if they can give me gifts or not.

1984
02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:54,450
I think not wanting to gamble is admirable.

1985
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:55,090
Good job, Minto.

1986
02:15:55,670 --> 02:15:56,670
Thank you.

1987
02:16:00,030 --> 02:16:01,830
Thank you, thank you!

1988
02:16:03,650 --> 02:16:05,210
I'm gonna be on the sphere.

1989
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:10,190
Imagine like Chibi Minto on the sphere.

1990
02:16:10,990 --> 02:16:13,970
It might actually be... Wait, we can simulate this right now.

1991
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,420
One moment, please.

1992
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:24,360
We can pretend that this is gonna happen.

1993
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:25,040
Hold on.

1994
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:28,080
One second.

1995
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:33,360
Hold on.

1996
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:35,360
I can make this happen.

1997
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:41,600
Maybe this.

1998
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:43,360
Okay, hold on.

1999
02:16:48,230 --> 02:16:49,670
Okay, hold on.

2000
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:52,090
I'm gonna be on the sphere!

2001
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:54,670
I'm gonna be on the sphere!

2002
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:56,950
Wait, it's not happening.

2003
02:16:58,890 --> 02:16:59,530
Oh!

2004
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:07,490
They told me I'd never amount to anything.

2005
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:12,850
Oh, mom, I'm on the spear!

2006
02:17:15,770 --> 02:17:17,390
Oh, there we go.

2007
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:17,990
Mom!

2008
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:21,310
Mom, I'm on the spear!

2009
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:22,810
Mom!

2010
02:17:25,890 --> 02:17:32,410
Oh, say does a storm not better?

2011
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:33,810
I was a...

2012
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:34,590
I was a...

2013
02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:35,950
I was a...

2014
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:36,350
I was a...

2015
02:17:36,350 --> 02:17:37,710
National Anthem game.
