1
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,160
Woohoo!

2
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,200
Woohoo!

3
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,560
Woohoo!

4
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,020
Hello everybody!

5
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,680
Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome in!

6
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Welcome,

7
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,800
welcome Lovely weather we're having.

8
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,120
Isn't it?

9
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,400
Uh That's...

10
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,820
That's...

11
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,680
It's chilly, a little chilly out.

12
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,650
Hi, hi, hi.

13
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,870
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

14
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,130
We're here.

15
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,150
Thank you for the voice back, Vidal.

16
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,110
Feeling kind of Silent Hill in here.

17
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,370
Oh, I can't believe, I can't believe Silent Hill.

18
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,090
And finally, I fell right into the scenery.

19
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,450
I know, I know.

20
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,890
Thank you for the voice back.

21
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,750
Thank you.

22
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,750
Thank you.

23
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,630
Thank you.

24
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,750
I'm so excited.

25
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,130
I've been so excited for this game ever since it was announced.

26
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,770
So I'm like, I saw so many people already beating it.

27
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,610
I guess it's not too long, it seems.

28
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,750
I expected, I don't know.

29
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,390
I feel like JRPG.

30
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,910
Do you count this as JRPG?

31
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,790
It's not quite, but you know what I mean.

32
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,850
Like, it's, I always expect them to be so much longer.

33
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,430
I feel like other Silent Hills were longer.

34
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:48,990
No.

35
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,090
You can, okay, but it's like, it's a Japanese game that's an RPG.

36
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,130
Kind of.

37
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,410
Okay.

38
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,390
But like, okay, in my brain, I'm like, okay, I can't explain it.

39
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,530
You guys just have to be on the same page as me.

40
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,610
Okay, just understand.

41
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,130
Silent Hill 3 is like four to six hours?

42
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,830
Okay, well.

43
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,870
The original Silent Hill is like six hours?

44
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,050
Okay, I played them when I was like a little baby.

45
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,950
And I took a long time, I guess.

46
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,690
In between homework.

47
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,730
I was sure they're short.

48
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,490
Okay, well, okay.

49
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,050
Back it up.

50
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,030
Back it up, back it up, back it up, everybody.

51
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,270
Back it up, okay, hold on.

52
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,690
Back it up, back it up.

53
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,990
We're gonna start at the beginning.

54
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,930
We're starting at the beginning.

55
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,350
we're starting at the beginning i have not played a silent hill game since three

56
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:14,870
um so it's been a long time even though i really like silent hill as a series it's been a long long time since i played anything i never played four i played one two three i never played four I never play, I really, you know what I've been thinking about recently is I have been wanting to play Shattered Memories,

57
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,370
the Wii game.

58
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,870
Oh, never played PT.

59
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,890
That's different.

60
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,510
That's different.

61
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,950
That was not Silent Hills yet.

62
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,750
That was PT.

63
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,470
And honestly, I didn't play the 2 remake because I don't know.

64
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,810
I was just like, oh, well, I already played 2.

65
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,290
Why do I need to play it again?

66
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,170
I don't I don't know actually

67
00:06:49,190 --> 00:07:12,730
I mean like I played Delta which was just three again I guess it's like I okay I'll be honest 100% I wanted to wait until what people said about it because I was really scared about Bloober Team I was scared that Bloober Team had it And I was like, oh,

68
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,730
it's not going to be very good.

69
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,600
So, and then, and then all the good reviews came out and everyone was saying it was so good.

70
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,700
And then by the time I was like, oh my gosh, yeah.

71
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,400
The hype had died.

72
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,720
And I was like, well, I'll get around to it eventually.

73
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:42,420
But, so, I remember being so like, when I saw that they were working on two.

74
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,100
But they apparently did a very good job.

75
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:58,500
with it um this game i'm very excited for because um it just i don't know anything about it besides the trailers i've avoided anything of people playing it and everything so

76
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:41,020
hi i keep mixing up bloober team in the chinese room for some reason who i don't know the other one good luck finding a new cafe to haunt huh what huh first playthrough of f is roughly 10 to 12 hours yeah that's what i i googled how long to beat however to get the full story it requires multiple runs as new game plus changes things what what this is gonna be wait that's so crazy thanks so much for the voice back mito do you have heard it she just said mito so cute yay

77
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,760
new cafe in Silent Hill.

78
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm moving to Silent Hill Silent Hill F so that I can have a cute girlfriend and a Seifuku.

79
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,320
I will be taking notes on your playthrough then.

80
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,560
Okay.

81
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,600
Okay.

82
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,740
I'll do my best.

83
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,640
But yeah.

84
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,380
Why did I always think that Silent Hill games were so long?

85
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:18,960
I guess because when I played them before I would have to play a little bit and then I would get scared and then I play a little bit and then I have homework and I play a little bit and then I get scared and rinse and repeat

86
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:46,860
yes that's probably it but anyway um so good it felt long maybe maybe maybe but so this is my first time playing like a new silent hill wow wow I I really do want to play Shattered Memories, though.

87
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,120
Because doesn't that also have, like, a sanity thing?

88
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,820
Also, please stop spamming!

89
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,760
Thank you!

90
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,120
If you spam, it's going to be less likely for me to play a game.

91
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,560
Silent Hill Phantom!

92
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,220
Yeah!

93
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,420
Okay.

94
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,400
Fear makes people play slower.

95
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,240
That's true.

96
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,740
But I'm brave.

97
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,880
Maybe.

98
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,620
Oh, I got some of the bonuses.

99
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,520
Wait a second.

100
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,700
Wait, wait, I didn't get the... I thought... wait.

101
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,320

102
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,350
Um...

103
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,330

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,150

It's a pre-order bonus.

108
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,710
I don't even know if I pre-ordered it.

109
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,030
See the tattoo?

110
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:51,930
I...

111
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,790
I didn't!

112
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,510
I was looking!

113
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,030

114
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,280
Early window bonus.

115
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,000
Complementary copy?

116
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,020
Who do you think I am?

117
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,860
You think I would get a complimentary copy?

118
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,420
Heck no.

119
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,820
Oh, strange.

120
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,280
That's so bizarre.

121
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,360

Why is it default to hard?

133
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,690
Lost in the fog.

134
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,310
Wait, balanced puzzle experience?

135
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,550

I got that one, the pink bunny outfit.

139
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,500
Did I buy the deluxe on accident?

140
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,820

It's so cute!

164
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,210
It's actually so cute!

165
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,050
Why the rabbit ears?

166
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,350
Is it based off of the bunny from...

167
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,730
Three?

168
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,930
The pink bunny...

169
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,590
I can't remember its name if it had one.

170
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,390
Is it based off of him?

171
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,490
I mean, he did pay for it.

172
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,190
Yeah, but I feel like if I'm doing...

173
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,330
My first playthrough, I like to always stay...

174
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,990
You know, do tradition.

175
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,210
It's a Labua girl!

176
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,030
But this is so cute.

177
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,310
It's so cute.

178
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,710
Robbie the Rabbit, was that his name?

179
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,690
Maybe we do the first playthrough and then if I want to get the true end.

180
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,630
It's pretty easy to switch.

181
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,090
It does say like you can switch.

182
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,710
So we'll start with this and then we can switch later if we feel like it.

183
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,330
Whatever.

184
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,730
It's cute but immersion breaking.

185
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,370
It'll make me less scared.

186
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,430
A little baby!

187
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,230
I forgot to say, I- I forgot to say, I- I made the voice as Japanese, is that okay?

188
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,110
Hinako?

189
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,710
Oh, Oh, the boy Oh, ma'amago to be able to A-g-a-g-n-g-a-g-g-a-g-g-a-goto

190
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:08,150
Let's go, Oh-mago-tosio-k-k-eo-k-k-o-k-k-o-k-koto

191
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,350
I'm also really bad with names, so I included the names.

192
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,090
I thought that was a nice feature.

193
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,050
She's a ton, thank you for that.

194
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,710
Thank you.

195
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,830
She's so cute.

196
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,510
Oh,

197
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,280
why did my controller vibrate?

198
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,460
Cute.

199
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,760
Aww.

200
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:09,880
It

201
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:31,480
might get spooky.

202
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,840
Did you see the person that refunded it because their review was scary?

203
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,740
They're blinding!

204
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,160
Who does the music in this game?

205
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
Opening sequence.

206
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,460
Me.

207
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,700
It was me.

208
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Oh, is it Kira Yamaoka again?

209
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:30,900
Okay, good.

210
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,660
I'm in.

211
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,780
this wow you guys are all so talented we have a great team in the chat today

212
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,500
she's even sitting on to the side in the photo so sam

213
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,700
We're not seeing like anybody's faces.

214
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,140
It's kind of interesting.

215
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:40,820
Hinako?

216
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:42,820
Oh!

217
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:42,920
Oh!

218
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,440
Oh!

219
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,580
Oh!

220
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,340
Head down the mountain.

221
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,760
Oh.

222
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,620
Look at our place.

223
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,660
Wow.

224
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,860
Uniform is so cute.

225
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, I like how we just...

226
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,740
We don't turn around.

227
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,160
We just walk backwards.

228
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,420
Frame?

229
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,360
Is it dropping for you guys?

230
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,320
I might want to lower the resolution.

231
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,420
Oh, I see it now.

232
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm comparing the OBS.

233
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,370
Oh, it's not for me!

234
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,270
It's only on OBS!

235
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,610
That's so weird.

236
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:44,870
Wait, what?

237
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,030
One moment, please.

239
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,350
Oh, interesting, interesting.

240
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,420
Why?

241
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,560
Hmm.

242
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,140
I have the frame rate limited.

243
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,960
I...

244
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,080
Like, I guess I could turn the resolution down a little bit, but I don't want to.

245
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,580
Because then it'll be too small for me to see.

246
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,100
Why is it a Panini projection?

247
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,180
Why is it a Panini projection?

248
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,620
Let's see.

249
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm just walking and judging, walking and looking, and walking and looking.

250
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,220
What just happened?

251
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,080
My game is haunted, you guys!

252
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,360
I didn't do that!

253
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,680
My... that was my controller disconnecting.

254
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,700
That's never happened before.

255
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,620
What's going on?

256
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,360
in 2025 is wild.

257
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,120
Okay, look, I have to say this literally every time I play a new game, a AAA title.

258
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:15,220
You can never judge a game's performance when a VTuber is playing it.

259
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:24,600
And I mentioned VTuber specifically because VTubers have also like 500 other programs that we are running at the same exact time.

260
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:39,120
So, yeah, I have to play at a lower frame rate for your sake because i am an anime woman okay thank you thank you very much

261
00:21:42,820 --> 00:22:01,480
okay we're going down the mountain is there anything oh what's my journal me me there's not a single extraordinary thing about me except maybe for being tall for a girl my age i used to be in track and field club which is probably why i'm I'm better at sports than most girls.

262
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,620
I guess I got used to running around a lot when I was a kid since I preferred playing with the boys.

263
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,280
I will admit I can be quite stubborn at times.

264
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,700
I don't like accepting things that other people decide for me, even if it's the right thing to do.

265
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,080
More than once I've rebelled and made the wrong decision, only to regret it later.

266
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,060
Mom.

267
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,340
She means to me it.

268
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,120
My mother.

269
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,800
If I had to choose one word to describe her, it would be...

270
00:22:29,820 --> 00:23:01,070
pitiful she's the one who bears the brunt of my father's violent moods and malicious abuse when i was younger she used to protect me from him so i didn't hate her back then but maybe i do hate her now even as my father screams in her face throws bulls at hers and sends her out for alcohol late at night she remains ever loyal to him i just cannot will not accept her way of life papa well maybe not papa is a good way to quote mean though the people could only see six

271
00:23:05,270 --> 00:24:01,950
yeah yeah he's a kanta my father when I first learned of the term patriarchal husband and that it meant a man who does nothing but boss his wife around he was the first person to come to mind dad barely talks he ignores me when I tell him good morning but if I say nothing he gets angry angry he just explodes he loses all control over his emotions in the blink of an eye he yells at mom throwing things around and even hits us why can't you act like that in public why does everyone else get only get to see his quiet calm side if it meant that i wouldn't have to spend another second with him in that house i'd happily let myself be taken away she's asking oh oh brother

272
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,510
Kinuta Junko, my older sister.

273
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,230
She's one of the prettiest and kindest people I know, and there's nothing she can't do.

274
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,150
I can rely on her for anything.

275
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,930
Honestly, she's the greatest sister anyone could ask for.

276
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,570
She's always been there for me.

277
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,110
Ever since the day I was born, until...

278
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,130
Until she left to get married.

279
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,870
Oh, my God.

280
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,750
She became Ria-Ju and left us behind.

281
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,250
Is there anything that...

282
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,810
I guess we just go down the mountain, huh?

283
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,130
That's what it said to do.

284
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,290
Hmm.

285
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,790
I didn't see like anything to pick up or um what's this way

286
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:59,930
it's funny too I say that about the oh wait this seems down the mountain hold on let's go the other way first um I've been having like some monitor issues today with like flickering so hopefully my monitor isn't gonna give up

287
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
pretty path

288
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,420
Let's run.

289
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,320
I don't know why I'm walking.

290
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,540
I'm taking in the atmosphere.

291
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,400
Okay, someone's home.

292
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,120
Hello?

293
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,340
Knock, knock.

294
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,600
They say it shows cakes than horror.

295
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,300
Hello?

296
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,560
Hello?

297
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,140
Anybody home?

298
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,400
Hello, I hear you in there!

299
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,140
It's me and Minto.

300
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm ready.

301
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,240
Oh, and that we cannot go.

302
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,560
Can't see.

303
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh, how do I read this?

304
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:57,980
Oh, A.

305
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,920
Entry to mountain prohibited.

306
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:04,920
Oh.

307
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,440
I see.

308
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,520
A landslide.

309
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,640
This place is pretty big.

310
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,200
I know places like this.

311
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,720
Art can be pretty big.

312
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,360
You know, it's countryside kind of stuff.

313
00:26:43,100 --> 00:27:12,500
yeah hello you got chickens in there a cat it is countryside japan absolutely this is so pretty though pick up local doctors know there have been sightings of foxes coming into town recently i'm sure that the older generations who have grown up learning to respect foxes are fine but I'm concerned for the children who may try and chase or provoke the creatures.

314
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,980
Foxes by nature are not aggressive.

315
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,640
But just like wild dogs, they carry diseases such as rabies.

316
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,940
Tet, tet, tet, tet, sorry.

317
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,570
Tetness.

318
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,590
An equinochosis.

319
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,090
To name a few.

320
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,490
The town committees should send out warnings to ensure people don't get unnecessarily close to them.

321
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,910
I was like, I thought Japan is like one of the countries that, But, okay, you can correct me if I'm wrong.

322
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,250
And I'm not trying to be like, Japan is so awesome.

323
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,870
But I thought Japan, like, doesn't have rabies.

324
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,550
Or rather, they're very, like, what's the word?

325
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,370
Extreme about it.

326
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,030
Oh, the 60s!

327
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:01,890
You're right.

328
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,810
You're right.

329
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,910
Oh, I thought this was a staircase.

330
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,030
It's in the 60s.

331
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,890
But nowadays, I think that every country has it.

332
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:26,350
But, like, no, they, they, like, are extremely, like, what's the word, proactive about rabies.

333
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:33,270
I don't think, if they have rabies, it's, like, extremely, extremely rare, is what I've heard.

334
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,610
You can correct me.

335
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,550
They done killed it pretty well, yeah?

336
00:28:42,430 --> 00:29:06,090
doesn't have rabies or really another place that doesn't have it i guess when you're like so insulated like that it's much easier to control it unless you know unless it like gets out of total control but oh i'm just gonna walk in your plants okay i'm smushing your garden so sorry

337
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,470
silent hill the works of yuki she's seven and mint phantom are all subjects that take a lot of space in my brain.

338
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,210
Yeah!

339
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,650
Also, if I miss something, you can be like...

340
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,490
Try not to backseat too much, but if I miss something, you can...

341
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,830
Of course, let me know.

342
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,290
Be like, hey, you miss something.

343
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,270
Oh, this is where I can change my outfit.

344
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:33,930
Oh, come on.

345
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,790
What should I do?

346
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,070
What should I do?

347
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,250
What should I do?

348
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,310
Oh, and here's tutorials.

349
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,390
Oh, exploration.

350
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,690
You can see a list of things you can do.

351
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,370
You can save your progress by going to record.

352
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,240
Let's just save.

353
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,900
We're already here.

354
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,640
Change costume.

355
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,100
Oh, wow.

356
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,720
You really can just change it so easily.

357
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,300
Okay, nice.

358
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,530
Good to know.

359
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,980
Australia has its own litany of wildlife issues that make rabies look like a joke.

360
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,940
I mean, the spiders.

361
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,620
That's just...

362
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,060
Drinking at this time of day.

363
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,700
That could be old.

364
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,860
Wait, what is this?

365
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,700
A woman is only complete when she's loved.

366
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,680
Featuring the latest fashion for young women so pure they make even...

367
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,980
They even make flowers blush.

368
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,340
Wow.

369
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,500
Wow.

370
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,600
Seishun Shoujo, okay.

371
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,100
Wow.

372
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,600
Oh, there's so much going on around here.

373
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,060
We can, like, explore the whole village.

374
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,800
The whole mountainside.

375
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,840
Well, it's a good thing I'm loved by so many!

376
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,980
I'm so beloved by so many people!

377
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,460
Oh.

378
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,500
Oh, I think they need to re-wash these.

379
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,080
They're stiff.

380
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,010
This game is so pretty.

381
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,870
And I don't even have it at the highest textures.

382
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,030
Oh.

383
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,910
Why?

384
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,410
Is she always out of breath, girl?

385
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,850
I thought you were good at sports.

386
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,290
You got that asthma?

387
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,170
You okay?

388
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,550
Is it the altitude?

389
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,570
She's always breathing.

390
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,870
You get loved, nerd.

391
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:39,930
Wait, I wanna...

392
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,750
Before we go this way, I wanna go to the other side first.

393
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,790
I am loved.

394
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,470
She's stressed.

395
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,090
Okay, that's fair.

396
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,030
Okay.

397
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,450
Whose house is it?

398
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,110
Oh, fancy.

399
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,270
Knock, knock.

400
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,570
Are you looking for another daughter?

401
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,330
Do you have a daughter?

402
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,670
Do you want a daughter?

403
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,200
Okay.

404
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,280
VTuber level stamina.

405
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,400
Hey, hey, hey.

406
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,140
What's this?

407
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,240
Water.

408
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,770
Okay.

409
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,990
Uniform is so cute.

410
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,010
Hold on, I just want to appreciate it for a second.

411
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,170
Look how cute she is.

412
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,110
So it's so traditional.

413
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,150
Like, but the little details on it make it so good.

414
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:42,910
It's so good.

415
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,410
I love me just a standard Seifoku.

416
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,230
Didn't know about the writing director for this game?

417
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,310
Ryuki, she's seven?

418
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,370
Oh my gosh, yes!

419
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,030
That's...

420
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,410
Oh, it's starting to get really foggy, huh?

421
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,250
Uh-oh.

422
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:09,830
Ebisuga Oka.

423
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,030
I live in the small rural town of Ebisuga Oka.

424
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:23,330
Before the war, the town was lively due to an influx of people coming for the coal mines and dam construction going on in the northern mountains.

425
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,810
After the dam construction finished and the coal mine closed down, it just became a sad little town.

426
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:49,510
The grand iron bridge that connects the town to the nearby city is the only reminder of this town's sorry town the sorry town's former glory okay we're going to the general store it's getting awfully foggy uh-oh anybody here knock knock where are you people

427
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:02,730
the coal mines they yearn for the mines they yearn cute Oh,

428
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,490
well.

429
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,790
Well, well, well.

430
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,370
Oh, my gosh.

431
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:13,990
There it is.

432
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,150
The silent hill.

433
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,860
Nice parking, bozo.

434
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,360
How's anyone supposed to get through there?

435
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,590
This has got to be something I can read.

436
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:32,790
No?

437
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,650
Oh, yes.

438
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:34,890
No?

439
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,690
There's no driver.

440
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,230
Hi!

441
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:02,750
Oh!

442
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,730
Trail.

443
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,310
Ew!

444
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,570
Oh, sick.

445
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,050
I hope I don't get nightmares from this game.

446
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,230
Wait, is that his?

447
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,910
What is that?

448
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,270
That don't look so...

449
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,190
How did this guy even drive into this situation?

450
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,470
Hmm.

451
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,350
Yeah, it looks fresh.

452
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,170
Wipe your shoe, wipe your shoe.

453
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:39,830
Alright.

454
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,510
I wonder how they...

455
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,730
In this game will...

456
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:44,810
Okay.

457
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,510
I wonder how they'll alert you of enemies nearby.

458
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,930
In this one.

459
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,230
Ooh, it's starting to get real spooky, scary!

460
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,530
Oh, this is the shortcut?

461
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,630
Uh...

462
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,790
Big red arrows, hopefully.

463
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,210
Oh.

464
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,170
Oh.

465
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,370
Oh.

466
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,490
Oh.

467
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,810
Oh.

468
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,010
Oh.

469
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,030
Oh.

470
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,170
Oh.

471
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:34,510
Australian spiders aren't as bad as the slightly, oh, the highly venomous jellyfish.

472
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,450
Oh, that sound great too.

473
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,690
This is me listening to your...

474
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,170
Listening to your rumors?

475
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,790
Don't worry about it.

476
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,470
It's just me.

477
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,810
I've got nobody to tell.

478
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,010
Don't worry about it.

479
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,910
I can't crawl through every crawl space.

480
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,630
Okay, that's fine.

481
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,390
I thought that was bread.

482
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,990
I was gonna get excited.

483
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,970
I don't mind the gossip.

484
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,610
I'm not gonna spread it around town or anything.

485
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,410
I'm gonna Isekai truck and get Isekai himself.

486
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,070
That sounds like its own plot.

487
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:25,990
What?

488
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,650
Sakuko.

489
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:28,910
Sakuko.

490
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,290
Where are you going?

491
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:29,510
Oh,

492
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:54,450
I should keep going or that.

493
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,270
I should keep going or that.

494
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,430
Are we friends?

495
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,110
Why should she keep calling me that?

496
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,950
That's suspicious.

497
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,970
Wait, maybe our Dirtle.

498
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,430
Sakuko.

499
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,590
One of my friends.

500
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,150
Oh wait, the art is so cute!

501
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,290
She's always got her head in the clouds and is a little strange.

502
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:23,070
She's constantly trying to worm her way out of paying me back for the 500 yen I lent her that one time.

503
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,710
Hey!

504
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,990
Her father is the head priest of Sennen-Sugi Shrine in town.

505
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,190
in town.

506
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,770
She seems to take great pride in donning the traditional Miko robes and selling charms during the New Year celebration.

507
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,900
How much would 500 yen be?

508
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, we're dropping frames.

509
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,500
How much would 500 yen be nowadays?

510
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,240
Or back then.

511
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,620
No, back then.

512
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,980
It's the 60s.

513
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,960
It's the 60s.

514
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,200
Maybe, like, $10?

515
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,880
Maybe?

516
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,740
3K.

517
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,940
I don't know about that.

518
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,980
Name, Suzutani, Miami.

519
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:35,820
Last scene wearing white blouse, long navy skirt, beige neckerchief with black polka dots.

520
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,560
Details on the disappearance.

521
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,620
The rest has been torn off.

522
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,280
500 yen in 1960 is $3,000 today!

523
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,100
Actually!

524
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,680
3,000 yen today!

525
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,640
That's crazy!

526
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,300
Wow!

527
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,520
What the?

528
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,380
That's so crazy!

529
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,940
Look at this rock!

530
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:02,840
What is it?

531
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,860
What's it doing there?

532
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,470
Hmm.

533
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,050
Hello, welcome back!

534
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,730
Thank you!

535
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,550
Oh, is this the shrine?

536
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,810
Well, what's down here first?

537
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:31,890
Construction.

538
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,770
I got guy.

539
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,350
How did I get get?

540
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,170
How?

541
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,890
Does she speak?

542
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,030
Okay, still under construction.

543
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,210
When are they going to be finished?

544
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,310
I don't know.

545
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,810
What is it?

546
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,270
It looks like a grave.

547
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,830
It doesn't look like construction.

548
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,050
It's kind of spooky, no?

549
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,330
No?

550
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,740
It's kind of spooky.

551
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,520
You got one guide.

552
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,420
What did I get one guide?

553
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,460
There were so many people!

554
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,340
What about the prize?

555
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,300
There were so many people saying it though.

556
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,160
There were so many people saying...

557
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,460
I wonder what's the first creepy crawly we're gonna encounter.

558
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,380
There's a man!

559
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:26,600
That!

560
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,940
It's this guy!

561
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,440
It's the first creepy crawly!

562
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,200
Yuai Yu Shu.

563
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,940
Shu's been my best friend since forever.

564
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,200
He's my partner.

565
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,780
We've been having play dates for as long as I can remember.

566
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,080
When we played make-beliefs space wars, we'd call each other partner.

567
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,880
And for some reason, it just kind of stuck.

568
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,340
Kids of the Shoah era tend to look down on the other sex, but never Shu.

569
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:02,540
When I rebelled against my parents because they told me to act like a girl, he was the one who understood my feelings the most and stood by me.

570
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:14,720
a tom tom boy it's like me when i was a baby wisp i'm trying to enter everybody's home sorry eyeball

571
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,840

572
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,970
So awkward.

573
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,230
I thought you guys were besties.

574
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,630
What are these?

575
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:06,890
Candy?

576
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:07,990
Candy?

577
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:22,590
I don't think there's cigarettes, are they?

578
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,030
Oh.

579
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,790
Shiu-kun, you're on the way.

580
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,130
Oh.

581
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,030
Oh.

582
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,630
Oh.

583
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,050
Oh.

584
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:34,150
Oh.

585
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,230
Oh.

586
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,230
Oh.

587
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,590
I don't know.

588
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:40,990
I don't know.

589
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,190
Yeah, yeah.

590
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,530
I was like to talk to somebody.

591
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,230
I was like, yeah.

592
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,890
I was like, I was like, that.

593
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,770
That's why I was like, oh yeah.

594
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,130
Oh, my goodness.

595
00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:01,490
If I knew I'd have to get it, I'd have to come back.

596
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,830
Yeah, I'll just keep it.

597
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:05,310
Yeah, yeah.

598
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:10,610
I mean, I'll be back to the point where I'm coming What?

599
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,750
The 500 yen?

600
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,710
Oh, we're smoking.

601
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,410
Oh, we're smoking.

602
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:42,910
What the?

603
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,010
What the?

604
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,100
Who the fuck comes?

605
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,200
Hinako?

606
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,320
Come here.

607
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,460
Oh?

608
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,090
What?

609
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,220
Oh, okay.

610
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Escape the fog monster.

611
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

612
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,480
We're running, we're running, we're running.

613
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,340
Oh, my God.

614
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,320
We're not running fast enough.

615
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,020
I thought you were gonna track.

616
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,620
I thought you were gonna track.

617
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,220
I thought you were gonna track.

618
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,760
What happened?

619
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,560
This way.

620
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,620
You're right.

621
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,720
Oh, God.

622
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,400
Did I choose the wrong way?

623
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,620
Oh, eight.

624
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:11,880
Oh, my God.

625
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,040
Oh, my God.

626
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,420
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

627
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:17,820
That's right.

628
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,470
Uh, oh, shoot.

629
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:23,790
Uh-oh.

630
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,730
I tried to, I might have just screwed myself.

631
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,410
Just kidding.

632
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,240
Ah!

633
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,020
Uh-oh.

634
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:35,840
I'm so...

635
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,360
Oh, ah, ah.

636
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,120
Ah!

637
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,760
We're running, we're running.

638
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:45,920
Oh, my gosh.

639
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:46,820
Ah!

640
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,060
What's happening?

641
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,280
Silent Hill!

642
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,220
The laughing is so creepy.

643
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,550
Oh my god.

644
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,510
Be careful!

645
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:45,950
Be careful!

646
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,100
Surely it doesn't know how to climb.

647
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,200
We're smarter.

648
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,220
We're human.

649
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,610
Oh no.

650
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,270
Okay.

651
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,810
What did we get?

652
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,030
Oh, note from Shu.

653
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,370
Hey, partner.

654
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,370
These painkillers should work best for you.

655
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,470
They'll not only take care of your headaches, but also any pain from injuries.

656
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:29,010
I suspect that the main cause behind your nasty headaches is from you unconsciously grinding your teeth when you're upset.

657
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,910
Does that sound about right?

658
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:31,530
Oops.

659
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,290
I-bo-zoned.

660
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,930
I'm bo-zoned.

661
00:48:38,270 --> 00:49:09,330

662
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:10,430
okay.

663
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,910
It was literally telling me.

664
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,150
I went straight for the journal.

665
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:18,630
Is there anything here?

666
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,370
Nothing that anyone offered that we can steal for our own benefit?

667
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,070
Disappointing?

668
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:30,610
Okay.

669
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:38,060
I thought he was gonna give a note like, Hey, meet me at this place later.

670
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,600
I feel like this game is probably pretty linear.

671
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,440
But I could be wrong.

672
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,180
Oh, bandage.

673
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,020
Greatly restore itself.

674
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,580
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna get our money back.

675
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,540
I don't know if we're gonna get our money.

676
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,720
Wait, we don't even know where we are?

677
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,260
Okay.

678
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,440
Sakako didn't seem very in good shape, I'm just saying.

679
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,530
You can explore a bit.

680
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,010
Oh, really?

681
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,650
Find a way back to Chizuruya General Store.

682
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:26,350
Okay.

683
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,150
Oh, we could go up.

684
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,620
What's over here?

685
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,980
What's this?

686
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,140
Oh, more... more drugs.

687
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,860
They're not drugs.

688
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,900
She's a good girl.

689
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,400
She doesn't do bad drugs or smoke like you guys assumed.

690
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,980
But I don't recommend.

691
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,380
Oh, sorry.

692
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,720
Taking drugs that you find in the alleyway.

693
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,640
Oh, wow.

694
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:05,940
Me.

695
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,200
Two seconds ago.

696
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,860
Wow, this game seems pretty linear, maybe.

697
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,860
Or I guess, who knows?

698
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,540
It's fine if you live.

699
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,060
live here.

700
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,120
Is it?

701
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,000
Did I miss something?

702
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,460
Was somebody there?

703
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,780
Did I miss it?

704
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,680
Shoe?

705
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,800
What kind of shoe do you think is a running shoe?

706
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,580
Uh-oh.

707
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,860
I don't like these at all.

708
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,220
Oh gosh, I think so.

709
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,900
Oh, I don't like going through these.

00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:56,280

00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,550
could oh she does though oh we're so

715
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:31,350
oh my god oh it's so awesome How do you know I'm there?

716
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,570
Oh, so good.

717
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,550
Oh, so spooky!

718
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,650
B to evade attacks.

719
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,670
If you dodge just before an enemy's attack lands, you will perform a perfect dodge and recover your stamina.

720
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,570
Oh, they're like, hey, make sure you read this, dummy.

721
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,750
We're not letting you just click through the game.

722
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,550
Was that a perfect dodge?

723
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,390
Oh my god.

724
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:04,170
Oh my god.

725
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:04,830
Oh my god.

726
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,390
Oh my god.

727
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,890
Oh my god.

728
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:08,810
Is there a weapon?

729
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,130
Sorry.

730
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,470
That sounds so scary.

731
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:17,930
Is she still coming?

732
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,350
How do I

733
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,420
know if it's a perfect dodge or not though?

734
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,340
Trying to figure out.

735
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,080
I'm trying to test it.

736
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,300
Time slows down.

737
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,700
Oh my god!

738
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,860
So good!

739
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,780
Ah!

740
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,580
Dang it!

741
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,240
Oh no no.

742
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,400
If I die it's okay.

743
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,000
I want to get this kind of right.

744
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,380
I'm practicing you guys!

745
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:54,980
Oh!

746
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,080
Not...

747
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,180
Not good timing maybe.

748
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,600
Oh my god!

749
00:54:59,540 --> 00:54:59,980
No?

750
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,640
I need to get the timing.

751
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,800
I can't tell.

752
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,880
Oh my god.

753
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,440
Oh my god.

754
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,860
Okay, oh, whoops.

755
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,740
It's a D-pad.

756
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,280
Oh, no.

757
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,460
I thought it was...

758
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:21,620
Oh.

759
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,460
Oh, LB and then D-pad.

760
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,040
That's right.

761
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm gonna go.

762
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:30,880
Oh!

763
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,100
Is this a dead end?

764
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,740
Oh, I think I screwed myself.

765
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,020
Oh, wait.

766
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,380
No, it's not.

767
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:36,760
Just kidding.

768
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,260
Um, hmm.

769
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:41,940
This way.

770
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,260
Oh, my God.

771
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,420
The sound effects are so...

772
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,400
Wait, what's in there?

773
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,440
Oh, hey.

774
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,500
Um, don't come after me, please.

775
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,220
I didn't get to- I didn't check that thing.

776
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,460
Let's just let her do her thing over there.

777
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,480
We're just gonna come up here.

778
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,680
She gone?

779
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,510
I don't see her.

780
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,330
Maybe she's-

781
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,800
Maybe she's gone!

782
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:25,840
Scary.

783
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,620
So...

784
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,660
Stinking spooky.

785
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,180
Where'd she go though?

786
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,640
Huh.

787
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,660
Mysterious.

788
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,100
Would love like...

789
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,820
a pipe or something.

790
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,320
Oh, it's just more like that.

791
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,700
You know what?

792
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,340
That's good though.

793
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,220
We'll take that.

794
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,420
We take those.

795
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,640
Maybe she ran back up here.

796
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,040
I don't...

797
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,400
Not particularly want to go see it.

798
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,980
Don't particularly want to check.

799
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,820
I think we'll keep going.

800
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:10,380
Hmm.

801
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:12,940
Where...

802
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,060
And then there's a map.

803
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,020
Oh, oh.

804
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
Where are we?

805
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,280
We're trying to get to there.

806
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,200
Oh, we're like going the opposite direction.

807
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,860
Oh, but I think...

808
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,080
Oh, I do need to go back.

809
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah, because I think...

810
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,140
Wait.

811
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,260
What?

812
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,100
We just came from...

813
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,880
Up there.

814
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,200
But I guess it is a dead end.

815
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,400
Because it shows it not...

816
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,080
We came from...

817
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,520
So I guess it is a dead end.

818
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,940
So we're kind of going the right way, perhaps.

819
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:48,640
Maybe.

820
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,580
Map is crazy.

821
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,220
Is there a run button there is?

822
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,680
I'm playing it safe for now.

823
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
It's a little spooky.

824
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,860
Uh-oh, someone didn't finish their laundry.

825
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,900
More?

826
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:04,940
Let's go?

827
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,450
I'm playing it safe.

828
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,290
Oh, I...

829
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,190
Oh, my God.

830
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:19,270
It's so scary.

831
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,830
Why is it so loud?

832
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:25,970
Oh, gosh.

833
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,130
Why did it save again?

834
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,270
Just got my voice back!

835
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:32,970
Thank you!

836
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,770
Thank you!

837
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,650
Oh, in here.

838
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,500
Oh, well, oh, I pressed B.

839
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,120
Sorry, instinctively.

840
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,740
Instinctively?

841
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,460
Instinctively?

842
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,720
No!

843
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,380
Oh, my gosh.

844
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,420
Oh.

845
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,260
Japanese homes are so scary sometimes.

846
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,060
Can't open.

847
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,360
Oh gosh.

848
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,970
Oh gosh, why are these so scary?

849
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,570
Yokan.

850
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,930
A jelly-like dessert filled with red bean paste.

851
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,550
A bite-sized delight.

852
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:45,010
That doesn't look very appetizing right now, though.

853
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,610
Offering certain items that will allow you to receive faith.

854
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:52,210
Interesting.

855
00:59:54,510 --> 01:00:22,690
combo we have nothing really so far except dodging wait what did it say if you run out of stamina you will be out of breath and won't be able to act until recovered okay and fleeing yeah that's what these games are about baby just running for it what else did i miss here the map Oh wait.

856
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,010
You can check your current objective by using Y.

857
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:26,630
Okay, cool.

858
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:29,410
Collectibles.

859
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,190
Checking objects.

860
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,930
The drawings are so cute.

861
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:39,450
Oh.

862
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,610
What is that thing?

863
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,990
What is that thing?

864
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,110
It's like a little worm.

865
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:57,370
Nope.

866
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,390
Maybe it's a face.

867
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,010
Oh.

868
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,150
Hmm.

869
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:01,430
Hmm.

870
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:03,670
Um...

871
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,210
Uh...

872
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,470
Uh...

873
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,410
Oh, what is a face?

874
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,110
Bloody key.

875
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,910
A key with unknown blood...

876
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,850
Unknown bloodstays, not sure what it unlocks.

877
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,330
Uh...

878
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:18,950
Okay.

879
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,390
Okay.

880
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:23,510
Cool.

881
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,990
Guys, some more meds.

882
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:26,530
Nice.

883
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:28,750
We take those.

884
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:29,650
We take those.

885
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,170
How did this get in here?

886
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:37,170
I thought it was gonna have me like jump out the window like...

887
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,960
But I guess not.

888
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:43,640
Leave!

889
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,200
Leave!

890
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,100
Leave!

891
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,460
The key doesn't fit!

892
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,480
Oh my god, we're so screwed.

893
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:07,960
Wait, we're so screwed.

894
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,220
Is it gonna be here?

895
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,100
Somewhere in here?

896
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:21,880
Oh my gosh.

897
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,540
I used the bloody key!

898
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,300
Jump?

899
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:25,900
Jump.

900
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,660
Get off the...

901
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,300
Oh my god!

902
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,420
Okay, okay, but...

903
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,000
Oh my gosh!

904
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,820
Get the heck out of me!

905
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,410
Oh my...

906
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,630
I've returned while avoiding monsters.

907
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:53,810
Okay!

908
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,870
Yeah.

909
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:57,790
Yeah, mazui.

910
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,410
Yeah, mazui.

911
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,130
Oh my gosh.

912
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,690
You're so scary.

913
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,900
I should have played this with a heart rate monitor.

914
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,320
Okay, where are we anyway?

915
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,900
Okay, that's what I thought that we needed to go around.

916
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,240
And we'll try...

917
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:25,500
Maybe...

918
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,840
Those look like dead ends.

919
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,620
and around and circle through there into the foggy zone.

920
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,700
So scary!

921
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,660
I figured there was gonna be a monster in there.

922
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,800
I wish I could have explored a little bit more, but I was...

923
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,900
I should have explored the downstairs area first.

924
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,240
Oh well.

925
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,800
How would a heart rate monitor work on a ghost?

926
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,620
Well, my ectoplasm would just go...

927
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,880
Like a jelly.

928
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,640
I think I need to go that way.

929
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:13,700
Move?

930
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,300
Just run?

931
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,220
This way?

932
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:22,050
Okay, now I'm lost.

933
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:22,830
Hold on.

934
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,690
I'm going the wrong way.

935
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:29,820
Oh!

936
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,220
Okay, if I turn around...

937
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,160
There might be an item in the dead end.

938
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,100
Yeah, but I don't want to run into this guy.

939
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,580
Or I don't want to be around this guy in the dead end!

940
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,490
Maybe she'll leave.

941
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:05,530
Did she leave?

942
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,790
Am I safe?

943
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,110
No.

944
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,170
I think I've crossed that bridge.

945
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:13,490
No.

946
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,810
I go past that bridge.

947
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:16,070
Okay.

948
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:16,610
Wait.

949
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:17,310
Wait.

950
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,410
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

951
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:20,990
The bridge is where I came from.

952
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:21,550
Okay, never mind.

953
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:22,690
I'm going the right way.

954
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:25,810
Oh, there she is.

955
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,590
Oh, you see her over there?

956
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:31,050
Okay.

957
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,530
Quietly now, without being noticed.

958
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,070
A cult?

959
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,690
A small hairbrush specifically meant to be used in religious ceremonies.

960
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:43,530
Interesting.

961
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,090
Yields a great deal of faith.

962
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:49,310
Let's pray.

963
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:57,070
Use faith to fully restore your sanity if you have chosen story as your action...

964
01:05:57,090 --> 01:06:44,720
difficulty level then you can recover both your health and sanity by without using faith oh have use faith you have received the hokora to obtain omamori okay at least you have this nice soothing soundtrack yeah i feel so good right now i feel so so good right now all for items wait what do what do Omamori do besides like protection like Omamori is like a protective thing but what does it do in this case well we have this comb I've received 300 wait is this gotcha

965
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:55,580

966
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,100
stamina.

967
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,100
Yippee!

968
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:02,760
Okay.

969
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,920
Does it just... Oh my gosh, and it goes up every time.

970
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,760
Oh, I got my... I forgot about my bonuses.

971
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,320
Fried tofu.

972
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:14,720
Let's go.

973
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,160
Aburage.

974
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:15,960
Nice.

975
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,080
Divine water.

976
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,680
First aid kit.

977
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,620
I got these for spending more money.

978
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,990
But the gotcha is free.

979
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:33,430
It's fine.

980
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,550
It's like in-game gotcha.

981
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,810
I don't mind that kind of stuff.

982
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:41,690
Let me save one more time since I just got the stuff.

983
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:42,050
Okay.

984
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:43,970
Um.

985
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:44,790
She's wailing.

986
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,870
Does it automatically equip?

987
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:48,370
Oh.

988
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,310
Equipment.

989
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:51,310
Sorry.

990
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,370
I was so scared.

991
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,250
I just clicked it immediately.

992
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,830
But not in combat use the lines and go to equipment and to select the Omamari.

993
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:01,530
Okay.

994
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:06,380
Here.

995
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,100
Here.

996
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:09,880
Equipment.

997
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,580
Ah!

998
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:11,620
Here we go.

999
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,220
Omamari.

1000
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,180
Oh wait, wait, I got two.

1001
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,640
Slightly restores health upon picking up food items.

1002
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,670
I think max stamina right now is better.

1003
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:24,980
Gotcha.

1004
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,960
In a horror game, call it wailing.

1005
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,180
Like, ah, wailing!

1006
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,730
The audio is pretty good.

1007
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,990
You can hear her stalking you.

1008
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,990
Wait, is it kind of low for you guys?

1009
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,650
I can hear her stalking me right behind me.

1010
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,050
Yes, I can hear her stalking me perfectly.

1011
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,190
It's very scary.

1012
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:42,970
I don't like it.

1013
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,270
I don't like it.

1014
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,870
I don't like it.

1015
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,240
Oh, wait.

1016
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,360
I just realized I had my headphones up a little bit.

1017
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,480
There's a lot of health items in game, but nothing to recover stamina.

1018
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,660
So stamina is the most important.

1019
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,140
Ah.

1020
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,560
Seems good?

1021
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,260
Okay, thank you.

1022
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:09,640
Oh.

1023
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,830
I don't want to look behind me, but...

1024
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,470
Scary game is scary.

1025
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:30,610
That looks... I don't like that.

1026
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:30,850
Okay.

1027
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,410
Where are we now?

1028
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,510
Okay, so...

1029
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,430
Well, okay.

1030
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:39,150
We're just gonna snake through here.

1031
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,210
When we go up the stairs, we'll go to the right.

1032
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:44,210
I believe probably we'll get attacked there.

1033
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,530
And then we'll stay right.

1034
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,190
Stay right.

1035
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,490
I feel like the map kind of...

1036
01:09:50,690 --> 01:10:07,770
um shows you so much before you even before you even get there it's kind of spoilery did you just say snake through here you guys are worse than me maybe maybe

1037
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:25,780
wait wasn't this the trailer I think I remember this part I remember this this This is so scary.

1038
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:30,980
Oh, finally!

1039
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,300
The pipe!

1040
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,760
Give me a weapon, baby.

1041
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,810
Use RB to light attack.

1042
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,410
Though you won't deal much damage, you'll be able to attack more swiftly.

1043
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,270
Use RT to heavy attack.

1044
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:58,190
Your movements will be slower, but you'll deal far more damage and have a higher chance of stunning enemies.

1045
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,470
Enemies take more damage while stunned.

1046
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,730
X to lock on.

1047
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:03,850
Okay.

1048
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,210
The music is so good.

1049
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,650
Holy cow.

1050
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:13,760
Ouch!

1051
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:14,740
Ouch!

1052
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,160
Oh, she's...

1053
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,140
Oh, I think she's done now, okay.

1054
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:36,740
Oh.

1055
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:37,980
Get Thanos?

1056
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:40,920
Okay.

1057
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,640
Thank you.

1058
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,740
Um, hold on, Rinkle.

1059
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,680
I'll come get you and like, Two seconds.

1060
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,060
Yes.

1061
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,240
Oh.

1062
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,420
Take that.

1063
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,700
Oh, I feel so much better now.

1064
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,520
Having nothing is absolute...

1065
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,620
It makes you feel the worstest ever.

1066
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,380
We got stabbed.

1067
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,200
Get the mistletoe.

1068
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,420
Wrinkle.

1069
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,140
Raincoat, my tommodachi.

1070
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,920
Shu, Aibo.

1071
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:27,920
Okay.

1072
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,360
Trying to explore.

1073
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,140
I'm a bit of a loot goblin, sorry.

1074
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,080
Oh, shoot.

1075
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:33,900
Oh, whoops.

1076
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,720
That's not what I'm expressing.

1077
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:35,880
Okay.

1078
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,730
I might have wanted to...

1079
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:44,770
Oh, counters!

1080
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,870
Certain enemy attacks will leave them vulnerable to counter attacks.

1081
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,090
A visual hint will appear when this is possible.

1082
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:51,590
Use the visual hint.

1083
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,510
Oh, when the visual hint is shown, use RT.

1084
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:04,990
Visual hint indicating that counter is possible, but visible for longer when you're using LT to focus.

1085
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:10,170
This one's a little hard, is it?

1086
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:13,430
If no visual hint is shown during an enemy's attack, that attack cannot be countered.

1087
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:16,970
Additionally, hints will not appear while Hinako is attacking or dodging.

1088
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,270
So keep a close eye.

1089
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:22,930
So like this.

1090
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,380
We'll recover after some time.

1091
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:32,780
Um, hello?

1092
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,040
Hello?

1093
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,380
Hello?

1094
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,460
Oh, I can't stay in focus for too long.

1095
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,260
Ouch!

1096
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,900
Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1097
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:52,620
Okay.

1098
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,340
Oh, gosh.

1099
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,000
We're fine.

1100
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:54,480
Ah!

1101
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:54,960
Presti!

1102
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:59,360
Oh my god, so much blood.

1103
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:00,800
We're fine.

1104
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,500
Wait, where did it leave me off at, I wonder?

1105
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Oh, come on!

1106
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:07,540
Wait.

1107
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,500
Now we are stronger this time.

1108
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,620
Like, LT?

1109
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:15,760
What?

1110
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,240
Maybe not.

1111
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:17,860
Maybe not.

1112
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,040
Okay, uh, ha!

1113
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,880
Oh, oh, we got her!

1114
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:39,460
Nice.

1115
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,420
Okay.

1116
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,060
Okay.

1117
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,560
Get the feeling Hinako might know some Kendo with that fighting stance.

1118
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,200
You think so?

1119
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,740
She said she was sporty.

1120
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,300
We should be...

1121
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,600
We can lock onto them.

1122
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,140
What was it?

1123
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,120
X, I think?

1124
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,820
Not quite right.

1125
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,080
This one, though, was tough.

1126
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,400
I didn't see any...

1127
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,260
Oh, there she comes.

1128
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,160
I didn't see any opportunity at all.

1129
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:25,350
The golden thing at the top of your health bar.

1130
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,370
Wait, at the top of my health bar?

1131
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:28,670
Oh, I thought it...

1132
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:29,850
Wait, what's the green thing underneath?

1133
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:30,750
Underneath them.

1134
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,670
That's what I thought was my sanity.

1135
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,700
Maybe I have to let her attack.

1136
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,540
I was waiting!

1137
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,620
She wasn't attacking!

1138
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,420
Oh, that's stamina!

1139
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,960
Oh my gosh, I keep thinking stamina and sanity are the same thing.

1140
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,100
Wait.

1141
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:58,190
Wait.

1142
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,510
Don't back up.

1143
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,270
Okay, okay, okay.

1144
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:03,710
Wait, hold on.

1145
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:06,610
So I wait and then it's RT.

1146
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:08,130
I'll try.

1147
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,180
I'm not moving, but neither is she.

1148
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,020
Ouch!

1149
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,340
You bitch!

1150
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,100
Oh my god, there it was.

1151
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,540
Okay, I saw the...

1152
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,200
I saw it.

1153
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,100
I saw it.

1154
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:29,440
Okay.

1155
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,020
That one was not possible.

1156
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,160
Oh, I pressed...

1157
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,040
No, I pressed...

1158
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:43,640
Oh, shoot.

1159
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,740
I pressed B, I did.

1160
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,120
Okay, alright.

1161
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,480
Okay, whatever.

1162
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:01,740
Oh, ah!

1163
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,490
Wait, wait, wait.

1164
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,630
Wait,

1165
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:16,760
but I pressed it.

1166
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:17,460
Huh.

1167
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,100
I pressed RT!

1168
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,980
Oh, oh, oh, RT!

1169
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,000
Yeah, RT!

1170
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,920
Oh my gosh.

1171
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,240
The timing is so strict.

1172
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:32,720
Maybe.

1173
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:33,800
I don't know.

1174
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,540
I did press it though.

1175
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,480
Okay, mister.

1176
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,260
Why is the music still going, though?

1177
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,100
It's scaring me.

1178
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,460
All right, we gotta go to the right side from here.

1179
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,780
Wait, what's my health like?

1180
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,660
I'm gonna...

1181
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:08,300
Take another one.

1182
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:39,240
Toolkit Restores Equipped weapons durability Uh oh There's durability Oh no Wait Use toolkits to repair weapons and restore their durability Short kits Short Oh my god Short kits Toolkits can be added to your item shortcut Using down Depod down Once a weapon's durability has been exhausted That weapon will break and disappear

1183
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,300
No kidding No kidding

1184
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,160
Am I dumb?

1185
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,220
It's already added, no?

1186
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,560
Unless it's... Wait.

1187
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,920
How do I access...

1188
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,960
Why is it in here?

1189
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,800
How do I access this side of stuff?

1190
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,080
Yeah, that is the scariest thing by far.

1191
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,580
How do I know what my weapon's durability is at?

1192
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,900
Oh, durability medium.

1193
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,160
Okay.

1194
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,600
Interesting.

1195
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,260
LBD part.

1196
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,280
Oh, I see it!

1197
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:20,720
I see it!

1198
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,480
Okay, hold on.

1199
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,440
If I do that, and then I RB... Oh, okay, that switches it.

1200
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,280
Got it.

1201
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,140
Boy, I definitely expected to see...

1202
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,280
Definitely expected to see someone down here.

1203
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,820
Let's just run.

1204
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,360
I was too scared to run.

1205
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,200
Just kidding, I lied.

1206
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,060
I ran for two seconds, and I regretted it.

1207
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,280
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:56,700
I mean,

1209
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,560
up here?

1210
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:03,680
Oh, wait, hold on.

1211
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,740
Let me go check that one area.

1212
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,940
Oh, yeah.

1213
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:15,480
Here?

1214
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,900
What is this area, actually?

1215
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,860
Oh, I didn't check here.

1216
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,840
We're being explorers.

1217
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:25,940
Okay.

1218
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,020
Oh, I definitely expected.

1219
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,260
Did I see something here too?

1220
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:30,500
Rominee!

1221
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,880
Oh my gosh!

1222
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,660
The best-selling soft drink in town.

1223
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,780
It packs a fizzy, refreshing punch that wakes you up after one sip.

1224
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,100
The Sprite of Japan.

1225
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,260
Rominee.

1226
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:50,300
Crazy replacement for the radio static, right?

1227
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,560
Okay, let's go.

1228
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,700
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1229
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:02,640
We're almost there.

1230
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,400
Okay, we just keep going down this area.

1231
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,660
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

1232
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:10,980
I'm scared.

1233
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:12,620
Where?

1234
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,240
Uh-uh.

1235
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,480
Oh, gosh, I went right into her.

1236
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,340
That's so bad.

1237
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,000
Oh, I did the perfect dodge.

1238
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:35,550
Yeah.

1239
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:36,670
Die.

1240
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,640
It's also, like, interesting timing.

1241
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,360
Oh, gosh, my health.

1242
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:47,280
Not so great.

1243
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,920
Oh yeah, that's my favorite part of the song.

1244
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:59,020
Ay yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo.

1245
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,160
Ay yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo.

1246
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:02,960
Pills here.

1247
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,040
Nope, Ramanite.

1248
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,720
Oh my gosh.

1249
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,600
Pills here.

1250
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,180
Nope.

1251
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,540
Wait, is there anything in there?

1252
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,020
Tease.

1253
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,500
Such a tease.

1254
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,600
Oh, it's saved!

1255
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,100
Yippee!

1256
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,260
Yay!

1257
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:38,570
I thought it would stop once we got here, but clearly it didn't.

1258
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,350
What other items do I have?

1259
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:41,750
Oh.

1260
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:46,310
Oh, this is an offering.

1261
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,290
Wait, so there's no point in holding on to it.

1262
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:54,490
If we can't consume it, I will offer it.

1263
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:00,610
Clam!

1264
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,730
Decreases enemy line of sight.

1265
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:04,090
Interesting.

1266
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:04,950
Okay.

1267
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:08,330
Steel pipe!

1268
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,460
Is that...

1269
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,480
Oh, it shows the durability in the moon!

1270
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,280
Oh, neat.

1271
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:21,280
Okay.

1272
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,800
Pills here.

1273
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,140
I love alleyway pills.

1274
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:33,480
I feel like I should be less afraid of monsters and more scared of Ikumi.

1275
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,280
Him?

1276
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,200
Okay.

1277
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:47,990
I just got a notification on my computer and said, now available, Silent Hill F.

1278
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:50,250
I'm playing it, I'm playing it.

1279
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,370
Sakuko.

1280
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,170
Oh my god, Sakuko!

1281
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:13,090
No!

1282
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,250
Our 500 yen!

1283
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:18,830
Mm-hmm.

1284
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:20,210
Mm-hmm.

1285
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:24,760
Mm-hmm.

1286
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:28,780
Did she bring her into the general store?

1287
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,660
Now so much candy.

1288
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:58,960
Wow.

1289
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:02,900
Our friend.

1290
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:18,280
Oh.

1291
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:27,660
This day, I know.

1292
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,800
Oh.

1293
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh.

1294
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:31,880
Oh.

1295
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,700
Oh.

1296
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,980
Oh.

1297
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:38,400
Oh.

1298
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,520
Sakuko.

1299
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,140
Finland is so nice.

1300
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:50,900
Mm.

1301
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:55,680
I don't even turn off the lights.

1302
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,340
Don't run up their bill.

1303
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,160
Are there bills in Silent Hill?

1304
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:20,850
On behalf of Sakuko, please.

1305
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:23,390
Thank you.

1306
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:28,550
I want to see you.

1307
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,310
Okay.

1308
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,890
Uh, I learned my lesson?

1309
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:52,930
Oh, shoot!

1310
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:54,910
Oh.

1311
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:58,350
Oh, my gosh, I can't dodge.

1312
01:26:59,370 --> 01:26:59,870
Oh, my gosh.

1313
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,090
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1314
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:02,370
Ah!

1315
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:04,330
Oh, my gosh.

1316
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,540
Oh, my gosh.

1317
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,240
Be careful, be careful.

1318
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,260
Ouch, out, out, out, out.

1319
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:21,320
Oh, I killed her.

1320
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,820
Oh, my God.

1321
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1322
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:32,810
Oh, is this the time to just, uh...

1323
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:33,910
Is this time to run?

1324
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,570
I don't think I can.

1325
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:38,770
Oh, damn.

1326
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:39,630
I got them both.

1327
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:40,270
Let's go.

1328
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:46,270
I got one.

1329
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:49,130
Shit.

1330
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:50,590
Yeah!

1331
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:52,890
Nice.

1332
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:53,890
Nice.

1333
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:54,770
Nice!

1334
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:55,790
Nice!

1335
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:56,730
Yeah!

1336
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,710
Yeah!

1337
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,610
She is studying the tomb!

1338
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,200
Yeah, get his eyes.

1339
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:16,440
Whoever the fog creature is.

1340
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,800
Surrounded by fog.

1341
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,760
Oh, the baby bird takes her first steps.

1342
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,800
That's the achievement I got.

1343
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:00,660
No.

1344
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,160
We've been sent to... We've been sent to the void.

1345
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:05,980
Hello?

1346
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:11,840
I think I will.

1347
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,100
I think I will nap a little bit.

1348
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:18,980
Oh, wait.

1349
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,160
Wow.

1350
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,680
Where are we?

1351
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,480
Find a way out.

1352
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,280
Well, there's a door.

1353
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,720
Wrong game.

1354
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,880
This is not a way out.

1355
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,660
girl fighting other cute girls.

1356
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:46,880
No good.

1357
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:47,880
I won't pledge.

1358
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,080
Welcome, welcome!

1359
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,500
Oh, Yashiro Sama.

1360
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:57,920
Rika-chan!

1361
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,640
Rika-chan, where?

1362
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:02,980
What?

1363
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,620
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

1364
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,840
See that little like ribbon on the on the jar?

1365
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,940
I thought it was fried.

1366
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:42,880
from far away thy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day thou must first pay respects to the gods and the spirits of thine ancestors a restless heart leads to a corrupt soul only through sufficient offering laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleansed now well thank you so much for the twenty gift and thank you

1367
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:49,680
Altar.

1368
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:50,580
Die rest.

1369
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:51,100
Oh, okay.

1370
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,580
Thank you.

1371
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,260
Oh, so cute.

1372
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,040
The pictures.

1373
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:07,000
It might have started as a general store, but we've come to call it the candy store because half of what it sells is just snacks and toys.

1374
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,400
So, where all my friends hang out.

1375
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,840
My friends and I also meet up here.

1376
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,240
Though we usually just sit outside and chat.

1377
01:31:17,580 --> 01:32:11,760
Ding fries are done what a monster of that appears to be lumps of flesh stitched together it approaches with an unsettling smile when it catches sight of me it's covered all over with sickening wounds I wonder if it wants to hurt me the same way that it was hurt so creepy sorry I haven't gone over some of these so far Nishida Rinko one of my friends she's really put together but can be a little inflexible in how she does things sometimes i think oh oh my gosh i was about to say i think she has a crush on shoe but then i saw the rest once she set her mind to something that's it and recently that something seems to be clothes fashion and other womenly pursuits rinko once confessed to me that she had a crush on shoe i told her that i was all for it but if she can't get used to the idea of rolling around in the dirt and catching insects for fun she might have a tough time how old is shoe like 10

1378
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:22,260
Like, he looked at least like 15 and he's still rolling around in the dirt and catching bugs.

1379
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,140
Huh?

1380
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:28,980
What?

1381
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:30,820
Why?

1382
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,340
Is she a dog?

1383
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,860
Oh my gosh, please stop spamming.

1384
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,060
I'm not going to equip your thing because you keep spamming.

1385
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,120
Thank you.

1386
01:32:47,420 --> 01:33:18,200
lucky lucky oh yeah added some more stuff to hers too oh unlike my sister Junko who was always the golden child I've been a handful ever since I was little my parents told me that I never listened to a single word they said I'd make my mom cry and my dad furious but Junko was always there for me she understood me she looked out for me that's why I loved my sister and have and have always done what she's asked of me or at least I tried She would smooth things out between me and my parents,

1387
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,600
which made life in that house a little more bearable.

1388
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:23,840
That is until she got married, of course.

1389
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,060
What?

1390
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,600
She's really not about this marriage.

1391
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,440
She hates this guy.

1392
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,820
Holy cow.

1393
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:41,380
Okay, so we're placing things where they belong on the altar?

1394
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,120
It seems?

1395
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:53,010
You're supposed to stop doing that at some point, but bugs are cool.

1396
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,730
It's the 60s, Minto.

1397
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:56,070
Guys, just be collecting bugs.

1398
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:56,870
Okay, you know what?

1399
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:58,890
That's true.

1400
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,190
What else are you supposed to do?

1401
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:04,230
You need to equip my love into your heart.

1402
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,950
Oh, la la la!

1403
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,150
Um, okay.

1404
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:14,790
Is there like a rhyme or reason, like this?

1405
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:20,740
Oh, I can examine.

1406
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:41,170
See, okay, see it has like the little bamboo.

1407
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:45,510
I figured this was the bamboo one because it has like bamboo on it.

1408
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:51,950
This has, it looks like an apple.

1409
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:57,390
I can't tell the design on it.

1410
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:02,880
Wait, oh, hold on.

1411
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,200
Okay, the rat warning.

1412
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,440
No, this has to be the leaves.

1413
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:12,520
Because he's all bundled up in leaves.

1414
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,100
Oh.

1415
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:17,720
No.

1416
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,000
Oh, it's a bird!

1417
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:20,940
No!

1418
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:24,240
Wait.

1419
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:26,160
No.

1420
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:27,600
Oh.

1421
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,160
Let's try this one.

1422
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:31,600
Oh.

1423
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:38,500
That...

1424
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,040
A fish?

1425
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,600
Oh wait, it kinda- well, I was gonna say all the animal ones are like on the outside.

1426
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,800
I think I did it.

1427
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,400
Hot dog.

1428
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,440
Hot dog indeed!

1429
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,500
How's the game so far?

1430
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:53,840
Is it good?

1431
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,340
Yeah!

1432
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:55,340
Hello?

1433
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,060
We are at home in the park.

1434
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,420
Is this a boss?

1435
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,300
Red means scary.

1436
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:49,950
The sanity!

1437
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:53,130
Oh, did I not make it?

1438
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:54,030
Oh, I think I did.

1439
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:54,330
Maybe?

1440
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,740
Okay, here it is.

1441
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,560
Open it!

1442
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:21,440
Oh, did we get caught by Ikeman?

1443
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:24,780
Oh!

1444
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,720
Okay.

1445
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:43,120
Wow.

1446
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,960
Foxman.

1447
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,200
Let's go.

1448
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,440
Where do we go?

1449
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:55,920
Where we go?

1450
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:56,060
How do we go?

1451
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,980
Hi, you know my name.

1452
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,000
Who are you?

1453
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,540
Yeah, what's this cosplay all about?

1454
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:05,360
Oh?

1455
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,400
Wait, can you, like, stay here?

1456
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,180
Oh.

1457
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,300
It's spooky in here.

1458
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:13,260
I'm afraid of the dark.

1459
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:14,300
Oh.

1460
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,500
Oh, he's right there.

1461
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,020
Oh, his eyes.

1462
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,900
Wait, is he leading me to the...

1463
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:21,920
Sanzu-no-kawa?

1464
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:23,360
I don't know.

1465
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,040
Are we getting...

1466
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,860
Taken to the after...

1467
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,300
I don't know who isn't all that bad at all.

1468
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,320
I mean, it's got pretty girls, it's got pretty guys.

1469
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:36,740
Okay.

1470
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:40,560
There's a little bit for everybody, you know?

1471
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,720
Wow, the visual is so cool.

1472
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,640
Oh, there he goes.

1473
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,300
Wait!

1474
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,700
Wait a minute!

1475
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:05,170
Silent Hill!

1476
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:06,710
Silent Hill Japan!

1477
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,270
Okay, I won't run then.

1478
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:14,210
I like how his...

1479
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:16,430
his lantern looks like a willow wisp.

1480
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:19,870
Kyoto?

1481
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,030
I don't know.

1482
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:28,910
Your weakness, person with mask!

1483
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,570
Don't say that!

1484
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:36,410
Even if you're right, I wasn't gonna say it.

1485
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:40,750
I thought it, but I wasn't gonna say it because I'm, you know...

1486
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,050
Gosh, take it stop!

1487
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,890
We were all thinking it!

1488
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:53,330
Oh, it's raining.

1489
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:58,230
Zootopia the Japanese word adaptation.

1490
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:59,230
What do you mean?

1491
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:04,370
You have one fox guy and suddenly you're in Zootopia.

1492
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:08,570
And he, like, disappears, too.

1493
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:09,330
It's cool.

1494
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:12,010
I like this part.

1495
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:15,170
Oh!

1496
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:16,450
Oh!

1497
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:19,650
That's my friend!

1498
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:22,310
Wow!

1499
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,610
Oh, look at all the yokai!

1500
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:30,090
Symbol of some kind.

1501
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:35,980
Okay.

1502
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:42,290
Okay.

1503
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:42,410
Okay.

1504
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:44,670
Look at that guy.

1505
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,820
And that looks like a snake.

1506
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,300
That's truly my favorite.

1507
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:59,100
Wait, all of these have different things on them.

1508
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,020
Look at that guy.

1509
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:07,460
Okay, so these, okay.

1510
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:09,440
Who did I not look at?

1511
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:10,300
You?

1512
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:13,060
What's your symbol?

1513
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:13,760
Oh, and you.

1514
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,420
What's your symbol?

1515
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:16,380
Okay.

1516
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,740
Oh, I'm not gonna remember these at all.

1517
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:20,660
Wait, there's more!

1518
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:21,760
Look!

1519
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:25,520
Cat!

1520
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:27,760
So cute!

1521
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:30,520
So cute!

1522
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:32,780
Tidal!

1523
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:34,520
Come.

1524
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:39,300
Okay.

1525
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,700
I'm not gonna remember these.

1526
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:46,740
Oh, what's this one?

1527
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,320
Okay.

1528
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:54,220
Yeah.

1529
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:55,620
Hmm.

1530
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:04,000
The sound is so nice of them like, you can kind of hear them.

1531
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,300
There's no wind.

1532
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,040
Well, I guess there is.

1533
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:10,100
They're like just barely moving and they're like clanking next to each other.

1534
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,080
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

1535
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:13,160
I wanted to look at you!

1536
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:15,700
Casa Obake.

1537
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:19,380
My friends.

1538
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,160
What else is there?

1539
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:40,940
I think I've seen all of them now.

1540
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:42,580
Interesting.

1541
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:48,820
Is this a place to save?

1542
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:49,380
Oh, no.

1543
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:50,920
Just kidding.

1544
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,100
These toes look kind of different.

1545
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:00,420
Oh.

1546
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,220
That's not what he said.

1547
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,140
Oh.

1548
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:04,520
Oh.

1549
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,760
Why didn't they say that?

1550
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:13,340
Like, why did they write her name?

1551
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,200
Like, I guess maybe it follows the English dub.

1552
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:23,480
That's okay.

1553
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:27,760
Why is his lantern blue?

1554
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,700
Because he is spooky!

1555
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:30,720
Kaiken!

1556
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,580
A beautiful dagger used for ceremonial purposes.

1557
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,520
The blade has been intentionally doled so that it doesn't make the best weapon.

1558
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:38,840
However, it does seem surprisingly durable.

1559
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,800
The Inari statue is laughing?

1560
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:44,980
Creepy.

1561
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:47,700
Inari sushi.

1562
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:53,220
Wait, what if I don't follow him?

1563
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:55,620
Okay, just kidding.

1564
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:58,180
You're right, you're right.

1565
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,420
But like there's so many other pathways!

1566
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,960
Don't give me the option if you don't let me!

1567
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:06,780
I am an explorer!

1568
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,900
Look at him over there.

1569
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,900
He's fast, Harold.

1570
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
go fast too.

1571
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,820
I just like kind of taking in the atmosphere, you know.

1572
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,260
Wait, where'd he go?

1573
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:22,160
Inside?

1574
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,360
What's a ginger?

1575
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,300
Fox drawing.

1576
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,820
Whoa, they're crazy.

1577
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,420
Wait, that guy's got a bow!

1578
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,340
What a good boy!

1579
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,260
They're so cute!

1580
01:44:48,690 --> 01:44:49,070
Okay.

1581
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:51,770
Oh.

1582
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:56,550
Wait, why'd you take me over here, though?

1583
01:44:57,550 --> 01:44:58,130
Unnai shio.

1584
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:08,150
Fox mask.

1585
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,510
A mysterious man who wears a fox mask.

1586
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:13,610
He never takes it off, so I feel I have yet to see his true self.

1587
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:16,010
He has such a refined air about him.

1588
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,110
I think he must come from a well-offed family.

1589
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:21,670
For whatever reason, he seems to know me well and treats me kindly.

1590
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,670
He's almost like a prince from a fairy tale.

1591
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:26,190
In fact, this whole situation is like a story from a book.

1592
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:28,790
Who are you and why are you leading me down this path?

1593
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:31,710
Oh, oops, I did not mean to dodge.

1594
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,730
Look how low my sanity is.

1595
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:38,990
He's waiting for me.

1596
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:43,190
Okay, I'm coming.

1597
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:49,110
Where do you go?

1598
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:50,150
You're so fast.

1599
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,300
You've arrived?

1600
01:45:59,420 --> 01:45:59,540
Oh.

1601
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,000
Wait, what?

1602
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,880
Why is suddenly so scary?

1603
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,040
This place has been so peaceful and nice!

1604
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:09,320
Why?

1605
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:09,920
Suddenly!

1606
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,220
Oh, look at loops!

1607
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,140
Oh, that's kind of nice.

1608
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:16,580
Wait, uh, up here.

1609
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:17,060
There we go.

1610
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,800
Why you shut the door on me?

1611
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,660
I didn't get- I didn't get to enter yet.

1612
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:23,040
Rude?

1613
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,160
Hmm.

1614
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:29,440
Hmm.

1615
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:30,180
Hmm.

1616
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,180
Investigate the shrine vault.

1617
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:34,860
Neat.

1618
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,420
Wait, so is my sanity like...

1619
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,660
Oh yeah, it's all back to normal.

1620
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:41,580
Neat.

1621
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:43,420
What's this?

1622
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,880
Wait, why do you...

1623
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,960
Look for any hints?

1624
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,600
Ah.

1625
01:46:56,580 --> 01:47:04,140
Okay, so it's obviously the symbols that were on the thing, but how do we know which ones to do?

1626
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:07,000
Maybe...

1627
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,860
Hmm, okay, two of them.

1628
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:14,560
Yeah.

1629
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:17,020
Okay, let's go all the way back.

1630
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,320
Why is it suddenly so scary?

1631
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,140
We're not going to get, like, attacked in here, are we?

1632
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,580
At least I know.

1633
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:26,460
Game?

1634
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:33,450
When do you think we'll see an answer to win this game?

1635
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,190
Any second now.

1636
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:43,610
Oh, you guys are doing smiley.

1637
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:45,310
So I do get attacked!

1638
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:47,290
Oh,

1639
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:53,650
no, here it comes.

1640
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:55,410
Oh, it's the doll from before.

1641
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:58,770
Oh, oh, no.

1642
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:00,390
Am I attacked by dolls?

1643
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:01,870
Oh, no, no.

1644
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:05,290
I'm not someone who's really afraid of dolls, though, are you?

1645
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:07,310
I'm more afraid of the mannequin ladies.

1646
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:10,210
I'm more afraid of mannequins than dolls.

1647
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:14,670
Casting... wait, wait.

1648
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:18,310
Lightning cast down from the heavens split asunder the decayed tree.

1649
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,450
From the earth grows kudzu.

1650
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:22,690
The prophet of eternal prosperity.

1651
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,470
Kudzu sucks.

1652
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:26,850
That stuff is... that stuff takes over.

1653
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:54,980
Okay, this is... this is way worse than the dolls.

1654
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,460
Oh, he's sick.

1655
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:07,320
Oh my god.

1656
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:20,070
Oh my god.

1657
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:25,140
Wait.

1658
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,740
Is this a weapon?

1659
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:27,180
Oh.

1660
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:28,600
Okay.

1661
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,120
Oh my god, I'm trapped.

1662
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,070
Ah, trap, dodge!

1663
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:39,690
There we go, nice.

1664
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:41,010
Oh.

1665
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,040
Oh, I have no stamina left.

1666
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:46,620
Oh shit.

1667
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:53,850
Oh my gosh.

1668
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,640
Can I kill this guy or no?

1669
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,360
Oh, shit.

1670
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:19,280
I forgot to lock on him.

1671
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:19,880
Thank you, guys.

1672
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:34,740
Oh.

1673
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:43,700
Okay.

1674
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:44,400
Woo-hoo!

1675
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:45,760
Okay.

1676
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,300
Oh, all right.

1677
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:49,300
Yay!

1678
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:49,900
Yay!

1679
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,800
I want you to counter.

1680
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,440
Well, um...

1681
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,680
Okay, so now...

1682
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:00,160
We figure out the correct things.

1683
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:03,580
What was it?

1684
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:04,480
This one.

1685
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:09,280
Oh.

1686
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,680
It doesn't want me...

1687
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:13,900
Okay.

1688
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:17,160
Does it punish me if I accidentally choose the wrong thing?

1689
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:18,700
Sure, hope not.

1690
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,020
I'm trying to look at what the red symbol is, but it's way too small.

1691
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,420
I don't remember.

1692
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,520
if it spawns a new enemy, if you get it wrong.

1693
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,980
It sounded almost like it would, right?

1694
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:45,020
Oh, no.

1695
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,160
What?

1696
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:56,360
I don't think I understand the...

1697
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,100
The... What's it called, though?

1698
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,220
Like, the hint.

1699
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,600
Check the journal button.

1700
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:08,140
Oh, whoops.

1701
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:15,840
Shrine Vault.

1702
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:16,480
What was it?

1703
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:23,540
Lightning cast up, down from the heavens split us under the decayed tree from the earth grows kudzu the prophet of eternal prosperity

1704
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:41,130
would it be this one no are you kidding me right now

1705
01:52:47,200 --> 01:53:03,120
wait oh i forgot to see um i said it has it's surprisingly durable i guess there's no durability on it maybe there is it doesn't look like it can't tell where he is No!

1706
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:08,600
He's just crawling over there!

1707
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:12,950
Hold on.

1708
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:14,750
Why are there so many spammers today?

1709
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:15,950
Go away.

1710
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:18,150
Oh

1711
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:31,210
shoot.

1712
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:45,970
What's he doing?

1713
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:07,390
Okay.

1714
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:17,350
I don't... I wouldn't like look at the things at my own leisure, please, sir!

1715
01:54:22,330 --> 01:54:22,890
Huh.

1716
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,440
He's like doing some meditation or something.

1717
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,020
Hmm.

1718
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:40,980
He's emoting?

1719
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,660
I don't know.

1720
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:47,740
I think he's just going around in a circle.

1721
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:49,500
At the moment.

1722
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:57,330
Yeah, I think he's blind, so he's just like going in circles trying to find me.

1723
01:54:58,330 --> 01:54:59,450
Hold on, the music's so loud.

1724
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:01,450
Um...

1725
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:05,450
Yeah, he's just going around in circles, so we can at least look maybe.

1726
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:09,150
But...

1727
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:11,610
This seems like it might be...

1728
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:14,450
Light... not the bird, this one.

1729
01:55:16,190 --> 01:55:17,730
I'm not sure.

1730
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:24,660
Oh, whoops.

1731
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,300
Wrong button.

1732
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:26,900
I keep doing that instead of the journal.

1733
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:31,080
Because my buttons are like switched, I think.

1734
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:35,040
Lightning cast down from the heavens split asunder the decayed tree.

1735
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,740
From the earth grows kudzu, the prophet of eternal prosperity.

1736
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,540
What's kudzu?

1737
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,640
It's like a vine plant.

1738
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:57,320
it's like a plant it's like a vine that grows so much yeah lots of leaves yeah yeah yeah

1739
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:25,300
it is very invasive they they bring in goats and stuff to eat the kudzu um because it spreads so much and it's so hard to get rid of it like and what it does is it spreads all across like a bunch of other plants and it deprives them of sunlight killing everything underneath so um so it's really bad to not it's not good to have

1740
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:52,070
hmm is it native japan i'm not sure actually where it's from yeah i'm not sure daijin daijin anywhere wait is that the the guy with the lightning yeah There's the other guy, but...

1741
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:54,650
One second.

1742
01:56:56,890 --> 01:56:57,870
Got a text.

1743
01:56:58,350 --> 01:56:59,390
I've seen it in Asia.

1744
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:00,770
Oh wait, now I'm gonna look it up.

1745
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:03,910
Where...

1746
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:04,910
Is...

1747
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:07,070
Hutsu from...

1748
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:11,730
It's native to Japan, Southeast China, and...

1749
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:12,550
Oh wait, this is AI.

1750
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,430
It might be wrong.

1751
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:16,970
Japan, Southeast China, and other parts of Eastern and Southeastern Asia.

1752
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:18,250
Yeah, I...

1753
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:37,750
watching videos of like them bringing in the goats to eat the kudzu are you in story mode i am i am this is my first time playing so they brought in kudzu in southern us thinking it would be great for cattle oh the cows don't like to eat it so now we have this plant that destroys everything

1754
01:57:42,950 --> 01:58:11,670
oh um well goats like to eat it the goats like to eat i love watching watch like a video of goats eating kudzu like a time lapse it's so satisfying it's like so fun to watch this is how i know about kudzu but apparently in japanese it's called kuzu kuzu i think

1755
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:37,940
i'm dumb i don't understand the puzzle at all i mean i didn't expect it to be like in my face like this is lightning and this is plant You know?

1756
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,320
What the heck was that?

1757
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:46,720
Oh, there was like a weird sound.

1758
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,180
It's pretty open if you look at it.

1759
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:53,280
At all of it.

1760
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:53,860
Is it?

1761
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:57,800
I'm guessing the second one is this one, maybe.

1762
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:00,400
This is not Kudzu, but...

1763
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:03,400
It seems like a plant of...

1764
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:05,440
Prosperity, no?

1765
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:07,320
Eternal...

1766
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,360
It's Prophet of Prosperity?

1767
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:13,820
It's Ajisai though, maybe not.

1768
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:17,020
Maybe it...

1769
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,680
And the other one is Bamboo though.

1770
01:59:27,530 --> 01:59:28,810
Like that one.

1771
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:30,790
This one here.

1772
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,460
Oh, no, he noticed me!

1773
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,240
No, he didn't...

1774
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:48,380
I guess you did?

1775
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:49,180
No, we didn't?

1776
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:16,320
I'm looking.

1777
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:22,040
I'm looking, because some of them have like very slight differences.

1778
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:24,680
So I'm trying to see.

1779
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,180
Oh my gosh, he's like right there.

1780
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:28,960
He's just going in circles.

1781
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:46,690
I don't like that sound.

1782
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:54,090

02:01:32,810 --> 02:01:33,090
Okay.

1786
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:40,830
Okay, it's a square with a T and a tail.

1787
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:43,490
Okay, nice, we got it.

1788
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:45,090
Square T-tail.

Okay, but the...

1790

Wait, there's three!

1796
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:58,000
I only saw two on the thing.

1797
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:01,200
Oh, I have to keep going?

1798
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,200
Wait, there's other...

1799
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,840
Oh my gosh, it's just like a needle in a haystack.

1800
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,500
That's what they have you do.

1801
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:15,640
Wait, I didn't see any other...

1802
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:17,340
What's it called?

1803
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:17,920
Did you guys?

1804
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:27,440
Okay, once he goes around, we're gonna go past.

1805
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:37,790
We're leaving?

1806
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:39,890
Check the map.

1807
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:40,930
Oh, good idea.

1808
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:46,330
That over there?

1809
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:49,780
The red circle?

1810
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,140
I can't...

1811
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:58,080
It said something about, like, finding your...

1812
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,360
Finding the next objective.

1813
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,880
I don't remember what it said, though.

1814
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,120
Okay.

1815
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:04,120
Okay.

1816
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,280
I don't know what that was.

1817
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:16,740
Let that guy do his thing back there.

1818
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:27,590
Over here.

1819
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,380
You don't think you'll be able to hear me run, right?

1820
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:41,640
Never hear me running, right?

1821
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,820
Yeah, we're fine.

1822
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:46,900
But what was this?

1823
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:54,340
Something about preparing a key.

1824
02:03:54,940 --> 02:04:26,360
he locked the door on me it must have had something in his mouth that wait find the correct emma but i figured out that area or were there more i don't it didn't look like there were oh wait oh my gosh this map is so much bigger than i thought it was oh my god boy oh my god we haven't seen.

1825
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:27,960
Oh no.

1826
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:35,710
I was really enjoying this area.

1827
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:38,190
Game, why'd you have to do this to me?

1828
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:40,750
Why'd you have to make it so spooky?

1829
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:42,530
I'm refunding the game.

1830
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:43,770
My review?

1831
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:44,490
Scary?

1832
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,610
Zero out of 10 stars?

1833
02:04:50,630 --> 02:04:54,230
Okay, so there's a bridge here to...

1834
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:55,970
Let's mark this down.

1835
02:04:56,150 --> 02:04:57,770
Okay, I think the map...

1836
02:04:57,770 --> 02:05:02,490
Remember how I kind of said it was, like, showing so much.

1837
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:12,500
I think maybe it was just because it was the first level.

1838
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:13,960
I was like, you know.

1839
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,960
Yeah, I don't play Silent Hill to get scared.

1840
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:18,740
What are you talking about?

1841
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:21,060
Okay, so...

1842
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:30,480
Our journal says, Lightning cast down from the heavens split asunder the decayed tree.

1843
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:37,720
So maybe we find lightning and the decayed tree.

1844
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:51,700
Hmm.

1845
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:53,260
Wait, a tree?

1846
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:53,800
In the middle?

1847
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:56,980
Oh my god!

1848
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,020
You guys are so right!

1849
02:05:58,180 --> 02:05:59,520
I completely missed that.

1850
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,500
The VTuber is blind.

1851
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:10,160
Okay, it was like a circle with the crescent.

1852
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:13,660
And a line through it.

1853
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:43,020
okay now okay i was right cool vtuber vtuber what would i do without you guys i would have just i would i would have just walked right by yeah it does kind of look like a basketball okay uh map okay the last one is right we just keep going

1854
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,700
I should have done that first area first.

1855
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:53,020
Or I mean, wait, first area last.

1856
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,360
I don't know where he is.

1857
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:07,750
Okay.

1858
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:08,590
Lightning!

1859
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:10,730
Ryden!

1860
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:13,990
I am the Lightning Rebo- Oh!

1861
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:17,330
Combination lock dial.

1862
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:20,410
Okay.

1863
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:23,850
We gotta get back.

1864
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:26,170
Wait, what's this?

1865
02:07:27,010 --> 02:07:27,930
Blood-stained leather.

1866
02:07:28,610 --> 02:07:34,350
For those who have yet to abandon hope, I have hidden the Umamori that protects against evil behind the Emma at...

1867
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:37,310
I can attest to its efficiency.

1868
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:38,990
However, no power is absolute.

1869
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:40,210
You must remain vigilant.

1870
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:42,330
This heirloom belonged to my grandmother.

1871
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:43,950
And now I pass it on to you.

1872
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:46,290
I do not think of how much use for it now.

1873
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:48,630
Behind what?

1874
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:54,190
You are the lightning in that ring, Minto.

1875
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:01,740
What?

1876
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:02,500
Oh, my money.

1877
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:06,560
I mean, where at?

1878
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:08,100
Time to check all the Emma.

1879
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:09,240
Oh, my gosh.

1880
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,360
Watching Minto play video games gives me a nostalgic feel for when I used to watch my visual.

1881
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:16,060
That was not very nice.

1882
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:21,040
Did my game just save?

1883
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,200
Is that what I just saw?

1884
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,660
A save point?

1885
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:25,900
Or no, I think it...

1886
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,500
Oh, it was just telling me it opened the shrine vault.

1887
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:31,300
Well...

1888
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:36,710
I think it would be better to go back this way.

1889
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:40,910
Less chances of running into the guy, I think.

1890
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:47,310
The Emma stands out for a bit?

1891
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:51,370
Oh like this one?

1892
02:08:54,650 --> 02:08:56,950
Greatly decreases the damage taken while dodging.

1893
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:59,850
Look how cute that guy is!

1894
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:06,750
I wish I could um Oh sorry Have more than one

1895
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:27,040
We're taking it nice and slow and steady Baby We're not gonna go across Because he's right there

1896
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:38,480
Yeah See that's why I didn't want to go the other area because that's where he all like...

1897
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,040
He likes to hang out in this area.

1898
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:41,520
I can't tell if there's more than one.

1899
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:43,220
If there is...

1900
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:45,740
Well, the other guy also likes to hang out in this area.

1901
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:47,200
So we just...

1902
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:48,340
We just steer clear.

1903
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:49,360
A little bit.

1904
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:08,390
Oh, what?

1905
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,380
I don't think you saw me, did you?

1906
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:44,110
Uh...

1907
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,750
Alright, I'll just go across the bridge over there.

1908
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:51,030
Is that Sheila's dog?

1909
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:01,110
Oh, yeah, he doesn't have eyes.

1910
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:01,530
You're right.

1911
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:03,510
Well, I mean, do you think you heard me?

1912
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:05,330
But maybe we're okay.

1913
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:06,970
Am I going the right way?

1914
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:08,110
Oh, my gosh.

1915
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:10,270
I love...

1916
02:11:10,270 --> 02:11:12,970
I love that...

1917
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:14,770
That skit.

1918
02:11:15,850 --> 02:11:17,090
Is that Sheila's doubt?

1919
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:22,370
I think I've seen that from...

1920
02:11:22,370 --> 02:11:23,150
What was it?

1921
02:11:23,570 --> 02:11:24,050
Dropout.

1922
02:11:24,910 --> 02:11:28,370
My dropout Oshi is Zakoyama, so...

1923
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:31,990
I like his skits.

1924
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:37,470
Alright.

1925
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:40,530
Alright.

1926
02:11:41,170 --> 02:11:42,270
I don't think any...

1927
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:43,670
Well, I'm not going to speak.

1928
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:44,670
I will not speak.

1929
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:47,010
I will not say what I think.

1930
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:48,210
I do not think.

1931
02:11:48,850 --> 02:11:50,130
I am just getting...

1932
02:11:50,130 --> 02:11:50,970
I am just...

1933
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:52,230
I'm just going inside.

1934
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:56,870
Okay.

1935
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:34,010
I was gonna say I don't think anybody spawned here Yeah Save the game I don't know how the saving in this game works quite yet Because I know it also auto saves But I don't know if me saving like that Like you know how I don't know Does it save my progress kind of dealio What was it The The button The basketball The T.

1936
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:38,930
Basketball.

1937
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:40,210
Oh.

1938
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,790
T with the...

1939
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:43,750
Wait, it is this, though, no?

1940
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:45,190
Oh.

1941
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:47,090
I thought it had a tail.

1942
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:52,530
The auto saves are checkpoints where it continues and the saves are from when you want to quit, I think.

1943
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:53,470
Oh, that makes sense.

1944
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:57,690
Yeah, he left me!

1945
02:12:58,270 --> 02:13:00,810
Actually, he, um, like, really...

1946
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:05,210
Uh, kind of, put me in a rough spot, mister.

1947
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:10,290
With your beautiful eyes and your...

1948
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:15,090
Beautiful fox face and your mysterious mask.

1949
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,690
What are you doing?

1950
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:18,770
Are you trying to kill me?

1951
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:19,810
You hate me?

1952
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:22,890
Yeah, bad Ikem.

1953
02:13:23,530 --> 02:13:24,410
What is this?

1954
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:25,710
Stone key.

1955
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:28,350
Ah, the key fashioned from a mysterious stone.

1956
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:30,750
Judging from what he said, it's probably something precious.

1957
02:13:31,550 --> 02:13:32,270
Oh.

1958
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:45,960
Oh.

1959
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:49,580
Oh.

1960
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:49,820
Uh-oh.

1961
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:50,900
My brain.

1962
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:52,700
It's gonna start shrinking.

1963
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,920
He's such a red flag.

1964
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:59,480
Is it the red mist that comes from seeing him?

1965
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:02,220
Don't trust the fox, man.

1966
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:04,240
Run,

1967
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:15,600
time to run, time to run!

1968
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,360
Oh my god, he's right behind me.

1969
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:24,680
Ah!

1970
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:26,360
Oh my god.

1971
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:28,640
Oh my god, that scared me.

1972
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:30,220
I didn't think he'd catch up to me.

1973
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:38,980
Oh my god.

1974
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:39,440
Ah!

1975
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:47,220
Oh my god.

1976
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:50,800
Ah!

1977
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:08,440
Ah!

1978
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:08,620
Ah!

1979
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:14,420
I feel really welcome.

1980
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:17,560
I'm not going to let it go.

1981
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:21,120
I'm not going to.

1982
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:22,520
Of course.

1983
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:24,640
That's what I'm going to.

1984
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:29,520
I'm still walking.

1985
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:32,580
Yeah.

1986
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:33,560
Oh no.

1987
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:35,000
Oh, it's okay.

1988
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:36,920
This.

1989
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:38,540
This.

1990
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:39,740
If you're tired, then...

1991
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:43,140
Okay.

1992
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:47,260
Oh, she's fine, but I'm not.

1993
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:52,080
Ma 'am, what about my feelings?

1994
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,940
How about how I feel, huh?

1995
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:03,690
Whoa.

1996
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:06,410
What was she trying to do?

1997
02:16:07,610 --> 02:16:08,590
I don't quite understand.

1998
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:16,280
Whoa, a styler, too.

1999
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:18,380
Whoa.

2000
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:20,800
I think we're going back home.

2001
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:24,000
She was trying to close it.

2002
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:25,160
Oh.

2003
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:28,120
The fox's guidance.

2004
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:30,120
The fox watches over the chicken coop.

2005
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:31,700
Shoo!

2006
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:40,580
Do you think he likes her?

2007
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:44,660
Like, like, likes her?

2008
02:16:54,740 --> 02:16:55,320
Maybe.

2009
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,700
Oh, la la.

2010
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,020
Look at that girl.

2011
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:03,060
She's just smiling.

2012
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,640
What about Rinko?

2013
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:14,320
Sakuko?

2014
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:15,300
Oh.

2015
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:26,200
Oh.

2016
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:26,880
Oh.

2017
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,380
Wait, what?

2018
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:29,960
How did she get out of the general store?

2019
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:32,020
Oh, that's her inside.

2020
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:42,100
How did it get her so quickly, though?

2021
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:43,260
I wonder.

2022
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:51,780
He found you.

2023
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:53,800
Because he found you.

2024
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:54,860
...but there's only one.

2025
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:56,080
No, no.

2026
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:58,620
There's nothing else.

2027
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:00,720
No, no, no, no.

2028
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:03,500
But, it's good.

2029
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:06,820
Because he found you.

2030
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:08,200
...

2031
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:11,940
...

2032
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:17,520
Oh!

2033
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:34,560
Oh, yeah.

2034
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:35,760
Oh, yeah.

2035
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:35,900
Oh, yeah.

2036
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:37,980
Oh.

2037
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:47,220
I feel like the music is so much louder compared to their talking.

2038
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:47,780
I'm sorry.

2039
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:48,480
I'm sorry.

2040
02:18:54,510 --> 02:19:01,250
She just went home?

2041
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:01,370
She just went home?

2042
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:06,350
Aibo.

2043
02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:07,150
Aibo.

2044
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:08,590
So cute.

2045
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:16,230
Mysterious Superchar.

2046
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:16,950
Thank you!

2047
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:17,750
Oh, sure?

2048
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:18,830
Oh my gosh.

2049
02:19:19,550 --> 02:19:20,070
Why?

2050
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:21,410
No!

2051
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:27,800
Oh, he's still there.

2052
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,640
Oh my god, you scared.

2053
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:32,140
Oh, you scared me!

2054
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:33,340
Don't leave!

2055
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,100
Don't leave!

2056
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:38,900
This game looks more like Fatal Frame rather than Silent Hill.

2057
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:40,460
Shoo!

2058
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:41,060
Shoo!

2059
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:48,840
Why did you leave me behind?

2060
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:51,540
This guy!

2061
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:53,080
Okay.

2062
02:19:54,220 --> 02:19:54,940
The doll.

2063
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:57,620
Celluloid doll.

2064
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:00,540
It looks like a doll that I had when I was young.

2065
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,560
I don't have mine anymore.

2066
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:03,520
But there was a time when it felt like a friend to me.

2067
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:07,860
He put on his shoes and legged it.

2068
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,040
Forget zombies.

2069
02:20:10,300 --> 02:20:10,880
Let's play Halo.

2070
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:15,020
In my opinion, a doll is a toy for girls.

2071
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,440
Because of this, I always felt like my doll was telling me I should act more like a girl when I was playing with it.

2072
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:23,960
One day I was told by a girl that I couldn't play house with the other girls because I also hung out.

2073
02:20:23,980 --> 02:21:13,960
out with the boys from that day on i didn't want to play with the girls anymore and so i threw the doll away what what mean girls so mean dark shrine you a monster restrained by chains and shackles i wonder if it was imprisoned and tortured it seems to be searching for me by sound rather than sight i should be mindful of my footsteps you were leading the way at first but now the shoe other foot take notes fellas girls like masks keys and apparently ditching them constantly oh yeah oh we have more update on shoe i don't know what it is about shoes art but it looks like uh junji ito in a way

2074
02:21:17,170 --> 02:21:52,710
sakuko a little bit too it's like the eye i don't know something about it what do we got here shu is always had a vast knowledge of plants and flowers so his nickname came to be professor horticulture he has so many aspirations for his future he wants to be a gardener herbalist matsutake farmer and a member of the space army must be the line work yeah shu comes from a long line of pharmacists with his grandmother still working as one following the war a town doctor was finally able to open an actual practice.

2075
02:21:53,010 --> 02:21:57,330
Before that, the Iwais were said to have been stand-in doctors.

2076
02:21:58,190 --> 02:22:00,170
Ashu was a grandma's boy.

2077
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:10,670
He spent a lot of time learning about various types of plants, flowers, and medicinal herbs that seemed to have sparked his interest in medicine, which eventually led to him learning first aid.

2078
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:20,270
It seems he was interested in learning first aid because of his family lineage as pharmacists and to fulfill his duty as being a member of the Space Army.

2079
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:26,170
Yeah, he has such high hopes.

2080
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:31,600
Oh, I didn't know you could do that.

2081
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,540
Oh, that's the, okay, that's the focus.

2082
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:37,060
I just wanted to see the durability left of my weapon.

2083
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:39,020
Okay, that was my bad.

2084
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:43,380
I meant to press this instead of the focus.

2085
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,740
And I was like, what's going on here?

2086
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:46,400
We're focusing real hard.

2087
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:47,720
Why did he leave me?

2088
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:50,320
We could have been traveling together.

2089
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:54,640
Where did he go?

2090
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:57,200
He's like, I'm going to leave you if you don't hurry up.

2091
02:22:59,000 --> 02:22:59,920
Damn it.

2092
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:06,440
When using focus with the LT, your sanity will slowly deplete while your gauge fills up.

2093
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:08,140
Oh yeah, that's what just happened.

2094
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:13,220
Your max sanity will decrease if you are attacked while using focus in action.

2095
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:14,220
Oh, other than story.

2096
02:23:14,500 --> 02:23:14,660
Okay.

2097
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:20,750
You abandoned Rinko too.

2098
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:21,290
Yeah.

2099
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:25,690
Once your focus gauge is full, use RB to perform a focus attack.

2100
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:32,670
Your current max sanity will decrease, but you will unleash a devastating attack that varies with each weapon.

2101
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:39,810
You can use items such as Domine and Divine Water or visit Hokura or choose Clear Mind.

2102
02:23:40,570 --> 02:23:43,970
What do you mean choose Clear Mind to restore your current max sanity?

2103
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:50,810
If you have chosen story as your action difficulty level, then you can recover both your health and sanity without using faith by visiting Hokura.

2104
02:23:57,620 --> 02:24:01,700
I'm trying to focus on it or like...

2105
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:04,300
Ew, it's so...

2106
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:06,360
Oh my gosh, I love watching it move.

2107
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:09,360
Oh my god, it's so creepy.

2108
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:11,180
It's perfect.

2109
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,760
Wow, bow, woo!

2110
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:18,200
Inari no nakukoro ni.

2111
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,940
She's gonna come back, right?

2112
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:26,320
I want to do the focus attack.

2113
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,540
Is that Shu?

2114
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:32,680
Shu?

2115
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:34,260
What's this one?

2116
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:37,740
Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff all the time.

2117
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:41,320
Oh, this is switching weapons, okay.

2118
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:44,280
Well, this is just a tutorial, okay.

2119
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:47,840
Where'd she go?

2120
02:24:48,460 --> 02:24:49,200
Is she gonna come back?

2121
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:52,840
I hear her.

2122
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:13,110
I'm gonna do it.

2123
02:25:13,930 --> 02:25:14,950
I'm gonna RB!

2124
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:17,010
Oh.

2125
02:25:31,050 --> 02:25:31,930
Oh, she's dead.

2126
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:32,850
I got her.

2127
02:25:35,550 --> 02:25:36,610
That was RT!

2128
02:25:37,490 --> 02:25:38,710
Yeah, it was!

2129
02:25:39,850 --> 02:25:40,290
Oh,

2130
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:45,480
that was silly.

2131
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:50,840
Oh, those kinds of mistakes will actually kill you, huh?

2132
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,360
Oh.

2133
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,560
Whoa, look at all that.

2134
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:59,160
That's craziness.

2135
02:25:59,400 --> 02:25:59,860
Wait, where am I?

2136
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:00,800
We're going to...

2137
02:26:02,700 --> 02:26:04,220
Rinko's house, but where is it?

2138
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:05,500
I want to zoom out, please.

2139
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,360
that we cannot zoom out.

2140
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:14,640
Oh, dominant.

2141
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:24,820
That doesn't look good.

2142
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:35,020
Let's go another way.

2143
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:36,940
Let's just keep going towards where Shu went.

2144
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:45,280
Yeah, we call that close enough quarters combat.

2145
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:49,340
It worked.

2146
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:51,180
No?

2147
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:54,140
Wait, this area, it looks like it's all...

2148
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,380
It's all messed up, but we can go.

2149
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:58,640
It doesn't look so messed up.

2150
02:26:59,220 --> 02:27:00,580
Let's just keep going forward.

2151
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:02,260
Oh.

2152
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:06,160
I pray.

2153
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:07,000
I pray.

2154
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:08,680
And I pray!

2155
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:11,780
I pray every single day!

2156
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,720
Is there anything we can give?

2157
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:19,580
Yeah, but I can use these for sanity, so... and health.

2158
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:30,530
I can't tell if this is crossing.

2159
02:27:31,410 --> 02:27:32,050
Yeah, okay.

2160
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:35,770
Oh my gosh, Shu, where have you gone?

2161
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:38,290
I'll take those for sure.

2162
02:27:38,490 --> 02:27:39,390
Thank you very much.

2163
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:41,670
My health is... Okay, Max, awesome.

2164
02:27:48,450 --> 02:27:51,930
I can't really play too much today, guys, unfortunately.

2165
02:27:53,890 --> 02:28:26,820
decide when I want to next time though I want to play a lot a lot I'm wondering if I should maybe call it here I guess we're going in wait but this is not maybe we should go the other way because there's a lot of dead ends here like I don't know where her house is but I imagine maybe upwards would be better Let's go instead.

2166
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:31,020
It's a good stopping point.

2167
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:34,240
We did just get past that one thing, and we just saw...

2168
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:38,320
I think right from here is probably a bit of exploration, so...

2169
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:42,000
I think I'm gonna call it if that's okay with you guys.

2170
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:47,060
That's all right with you guys.

2171
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:48,880
Akira!

2172
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:50,860
Thank you so much for the manganin!

2173
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:53,060
I'll allow it.

2174
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,580
Okay, thank you for allowing it.

2175
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:00,900
Oh my gosh, this game is spooky.

2176
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:05,980
But it also, it feels, I don't know how to describe.

2177
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:08,760
Well, I guess it's been so long since I've played a Silent Hill, so.

2178
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:13,120
No spoilers, but feel free to explore as much as you'd like.

2179
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:16,000
The game will only ever prod you in the direction of the main objective.

2180
02:29:16,420 --> 02:29:17,560
But there's some other stuff you can find.

2181
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:18,500
Oh, cool, okay.

2182
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:20,980
Maybe we'll go down that other path then next time.

2183
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:24,940
Kung Pao chicken, sweet and sour chicken, or Mongolian beef.

2184
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:26,780
Oh, ghost of the YouTuber Charlie pick.

2185
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:31,680

But I've got to get scanned for Mr. Kojima.
