00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,440
Centuries ago, in a small tucked away kingdom, ruled a royal family.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,120
The family was known for rich land, blossoming mint and cocoa bean supplies.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,940
The crown prince was set to marry the neighboring and much more powerful kingdom's daughter.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,600
However, there was one open secret throughout the kingdom.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,240
The prince and his maid were... in relations.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:39,620
Everyone in the palace knew, but kept the information away from the princess, for they knew she could have a temper.

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,320
Until one night, the princess dropped by without warning and caught the prince.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:56,940
While the princess set the kingdom ablaze in a jealous rampage, the valiant prince stood by his lover and fought for their right to love.

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,980
Or so you would think.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,600
Instead, the prince buckled under the first sign of trouble and immediately threw his maid away to save his skin.

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:19,220
And while burning at the stake, the maid uttered a curse upon the land and vowed to...

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,440
Ugh, I can't believe I'm having to study today of all days.

13
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,860
I really shouldn't have procrastinated this history report.

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,180
But when my oshi said she's going to be making a big announcement, I can't miss it.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,540
I'm so excited.

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh, it could be a new song or a new outfit.

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,720
I can't even focus on this book.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
I just hope it starts soon.

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
Ah, oh my god, oh my god!

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,060
Oh, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, kyou mo kawaii!

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,400
Ah, ah, is this thing on?

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,460
Kawaii, oh!

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,120
Good morning!

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,160
Marinara and cheese, a perfect blend of meat.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,900
I'm a maid you'll want to wrap around your fork and eat on up.

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,060
A meal even a college student can make.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm Spaghetti!

28
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,820
Ah, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti!

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,820
Everybody, with my lovely group of girls, anything is possible.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,980
But now it's my turn to follow a different recipe.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,540
And that's why I am announcing my graduation from Kidney Dreamers!

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:22,780
Huh?

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,640
Graduation?

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
No way, no way, no way.

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,300
This can't be happening.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,860
Spaghetti-chan!

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,380
No way, no way, no way.

38
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,660
This is just a bad dream.

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,920
Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan!

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,280
SPAGHETTI!
