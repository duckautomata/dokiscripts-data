00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,460
Hello.

2
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,070
Welcome to Ghost Trick!

3
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,430
Hello Vtuber.

4
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:41,990
Hello.

5
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:42,910
Hello.

6
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,750
Ghost game.

7
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,910
I'm Mint.

8
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,790
I'm Mint.

9
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,570
Hello, hello, hello.

10
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,610
Hello, hello, hello!

11
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,210
Welcome!

12
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,350
Wait, do you hear pops?

13
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,950
Does this sound okay?

14
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,770
I'm actually quite nervous.

15
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,650
The setup for this is new.

16
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,010
So hopefully it works.

17
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,050
I'm scared.

18
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,730
I'm actually a little nervous, but that's okay.

19
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,050
Sound okay?

20
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,350
Pops are a go.

21
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,570
Why scared?

22
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,470
Is it display capture?

23
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,370
It's actually...

24
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,950
Okay, so I had to...

25
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,330
feed my switch to my monitor.

26
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,970
But usually I do...

27
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,310
And so I capture usually from...

28
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,170
Or like I usually capture...

29
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,190
I usually play through OBS.

30
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,350
But since it's now directed to my monitor, instead of playing through...

31
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,650
Through...

32
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,930
What's this?

33
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,110
This is...

34
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,050
Through...

35
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,370
OBS.

36
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,810
I...

37
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,190
Wait, what was I saying?

38
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,250
I don't remember.

39
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,770
What was I saying?

40
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,850
Wait.

41
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,770
I would usually play through OBS.

42
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,490
And so the sound comes out like through my computer.

43
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,410
But when I put it...

44
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,910
Run it through my monitor, the sound was coming out through my monitor.

45
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,050
And I was like, wait a second.

46
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,150
Then you...

47
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,370
I won't be able to hear the game.

48
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,270
And you guys could hear the game.

49
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,690
But I wouldn't be able to hear the game.

50
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,050
And so I had to plug in another thing to my monitor.

51
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,010
But then it...

52
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,170
I had a lot of feedback.

53
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,150
It was all like...

54
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,130
And so I was just like, oh, how do I stop this?

55
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,950
And it was like two minutes before it started streaming.

56
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,070
And I was like, ah!

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,370
And then I was like, ah!

58
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,490
And then I was like, wah!

59
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,130
And then I fixed it.

60
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:03,850
Silly.

61
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,430
This suppo was sent through OBS.

62
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,090
No, you!

63
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,550
Eating Mike Tyson's ass.

64
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,510
Thanks for the five gifted!

65
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,490
Thank you.

66
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,790
I think I saw also...

67
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,290
Thank you for the 10 gifted earlier.

68
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,610
And Mini Scooter!

69
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,590
You're not up in the thingy anymore.

70
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,610
But I saw you earlier.

71
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,350
I saw you.

72
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,330
Thank you so much for the 50.

73
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,690
Thank you!

74
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:25,870
Thank you.

75
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,310
Thank you.

76
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,510
Thank you.

77
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,990
Let me...

78
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,930
I didn't know if there was going to be something that played at the very beginning.

79
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,450
So...

80
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,090
Please.

81
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,030
Let me know.

82
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,550
I think it's quiet right now.

83
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,330
But let me know if you can hear this.

84
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,970
It's so quiet.

85
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,850
Even for me.

86
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,110
Dempsey!

87
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,250
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

88
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,170
Thank you.

89
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,870
Thank you there.

90
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,650
You can hear it?

91
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,030
Okay.

92
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,950
I can still turn it up.

93
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,410
So...

94
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,670
But I don't want to...

95
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,730
I'm going to turn it down just a little bit.

96
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,890
Just because I'm scared of blowing my ears out and blowing your ears out.

97
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,570
So we're going to press English and we're going to see...

98
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,730
What happens?

99
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,290
What if I play Italiano?

100
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,770
What if I...

101
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,590
What if I...

102
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,470
What if I played Italiano?

103
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,890
Does it need to be loud?

104
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,430
No.

105
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,530
I just want to make sure that you guys can hear it.

106
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,190
That's all.

107
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,590
Okay.

108
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,710
Mamma mia.

109
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,110
We can check...

110
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,270
Okay.

111
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,310
So...

112
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,270
Next.

113
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,190
I am playing the Switch version.

114
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,330
Actually, I do own the 3DS version.

115
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:33,570
I bought it before the eShop went down.

116
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:50,010
But I thought that maybe because of how 3DS captures and everything, I was worried that it might be hard to see the screens, you know, like split screen and everything.

117
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,410
So there's a 3DS version.

118
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,030
There is!

119
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,070
There is.

120
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,310
But I just bought...

121
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,430
I was like thinking about it earlier.

122
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,790
I was like, I'll play the 3DS version.

123
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,770
Then I thought about it.

124
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,930
I was like, oh, wait, maybe I should play on the Switch so you guys can...

125
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,490
It's best for...

126
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,850
On Switch for streaming.

127
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,250
Yeah!

128
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,150
I...

129
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,530
I don't know much about the gameplay, but I heard that you draw stuff.

130
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:17,210
So hopefully, it's not so bad on the Switch and with like a controller and not the stylus.

131
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,190
But it wasn't on 3DS.

132
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,210
It was really on DS.

133
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,990
Oh, really?

134
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,790
I thought it was a 3DS game.

135
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,250
Oh, oh, oh.

136
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,350
But yeah, so I'm playing it.

137
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,030
If you're curious, I am playing it on the Switch.

138
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,090
Auto saves.

139
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:30,550
Okay.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,360
Yeah!

141
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,420
Welcome!

142
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,900
To Ghost Train!

143
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,780
Oh my gosh!

144
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,200
Saku!

145
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,800
Why?

146
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,120
Thank you for the 50!

147
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Thank you.

148
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Thank you so much!

149
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,040
Thank you, thank you!

150
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,860
Oh my gosh.

151
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:58,940
Saku!

152
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,040
There's already extras.

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm curious.

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,100
But...

155
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,880
Time to flex your detective skills.

156
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,300
Oh!

157
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,620
Oh!

158
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Oh!

159
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh!

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,180
You silly little wispy you.

161
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,420
I happen to be...

162
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,120
Stupid.

163
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,020
New game!

164
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,200
I got a small raise.

165
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,020
Membooships for everyone.

166
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,900
Congrats!

167
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,820
Chapter 1.

168
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:28,920
Oh!

169
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,940
And 7.02pm.

170
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
Actually, it's 7.17pm.

171
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,080
Is my Switch clock off?

172
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,800
Must have been unconscious for a while.

173
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
My head feels fuzzy.

174
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,180
Kind of like I'm swimming through darkness.

175
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Oh my gosh.

176
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,400
When I came to, there was a woman standing there.

177
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,240
A woman I don't know.

178
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,300
At least, I don't think I know her.

179
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,820
Okay.

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,720
The text is kind of fast.

181
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,220
Oh!

182
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,420
A dashing man.

183
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
And then there was a man with a gun.

184
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,900
I don't know him either.

185
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,240
Well, probably not anyway.

186
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh, wait.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Is that...

188
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,900
A skull?

189
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,180
A skull face?

190
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,800
Oh, no.

191
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,640
He has got a big nose.

192
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:00,900
Nevermind.

193
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,120
Oh!

194
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Hands up!

195
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,120
Now, I'm not the kind of guy who can just stand back and watch a poor woman get shot.

196
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,460
But I have just one little problem.

197
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh!

198
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,740
My ass is up!

199
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm already dead myself!

200
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,080
Oh!

201
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,740
This has got to be me.

202
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,980
No question about that.

203
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,640
After all, do you see any other dead bodies lying around here?

204
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Pew!

205
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,900
Hands up!

206
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,120
Hands where I can see them.

207
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,000
So...

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,420
Sister!

209
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,180
I feel bad for her.

210
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,520
Sure.

211
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,720
But what can I do?

212
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,380
I'm dead!

213
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,140
Just as I was thinking this.

214
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,300
So relatable.

215
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,840
There is no time to be lollying around dead.

216
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,180
You're the only one who can save her.

217
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,800
Me?

218
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,140
But I'm dead!

219
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,160
What the?

220
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,340
The whole world just changed on me.

221
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,780
Oh, now I can press.

222
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, okay.

223
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Are you sure about that, boss?

224
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
What do you mean?

225
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,360
Look!

226
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,620
It's you!

227
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,760
That's you!

228
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,800
Right there!

229
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
Oh my gosh!

230
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,160
That's you!

231
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,620
Point!

232
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,000
Point!

233
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,540
Point!

234
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,520
That's you right there!

235
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,500
That's you!

236
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm in the game!

237
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
Welcome to the Ghost World.

238
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,540
The land of the dead!

239
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh my gosh!

240
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,040
Oh my gosh, you came here to see me, didn't you?

241
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,260
If Mint misses a Super Chat, did they get ghosted?

242
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,200
No?

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
I didn't miss any, did I?

244
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
Such an undignified position.

245
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,010
Look ma'am, famous.

246
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,110
A voice in my head?

247
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,050
Who are you?

248
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,970
No time for introductions now.

249
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,370
You have to save her.

250
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,750
You know you can do it.

251
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,990
All you have to do is use your powers.

252
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,330
Huh?

253
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,910
Me to save her?

254
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,670
How?

255
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,830
There I am, Gary.

256
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,450
There I am.

257
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,690
Am I the narrator?

258
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,070
Me?

259
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,290
Mint?

260
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,310
The narrator?

261
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,010
I like that.

262
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,730
No,

263
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,760
you are dead.

264
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,240
Stop, sorry.

265
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,280
Welcome to the ghost world.

266
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
A world covered in ghosts.

267
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,800
Enjoy the world of ghosts.

268
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,620
Yippee!

269
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,120
Take a look at your corpse.

270
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,900
Do you see that blue flame?

271
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,440
That's your soul.

272
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,680
And do you see that bright white spot nearby?

273
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,060
That's a core.

274
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,840
A core?

275
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,820
Hmm, looks like a railway crossing gate to me.

276
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,860
Look, the best way to understand it is just try it.

277
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,620
First of all, try moving your soul with the D-pad.

278
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,520
Can I move with... oh, whoa!

279
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,920
Oh!

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,380
That was so easy.

281
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,920
I'm a natural.

282
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,860
Obviously.

283
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,920
Congratulations!

284
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,300
Your soul is now possessed the crossing gate.

285
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,640
So, what?

286
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,860
Now I'm a crossing gate?

287
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,220
Ahem.

288
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,340
Now then, use the crossing gate to save the woman.

289
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,040
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna beat him over the head.

290
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,460
But how?

291
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,520
In a moment...

292
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,740
In a moment, time will start to flow normally again.

293
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,000
That will be your chance.

294
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Listen, when the man pulls the trigger, the woman dies, right?

295
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,580
So before that happens, you have to use your powers to stop...

296
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,740
Oh gosh, is this game timed?

297
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,940
Oh boy.

298
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,220
Hey, wait a second!

299
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
I still don't know what you're talking about!

300
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,480
You'll see.

301
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,140
You'll all see.

302
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,960
Now then, time will start to flow again.

303
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,240
Raise!

304
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,580
Oh!

305
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:06,880
Oof!

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,760
Ouchie, ouch!

307
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,500
Hold it!

308
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,860
How ace attorney of you.

309
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,120
Well played.

310
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,220
What just happened?

311
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,980
That was one of your powers at work.

312
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
A ghost trick!

313
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,880
You mean I made that crossing gate move?

314
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,380
That's right.

315
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,320
You manipulated that object with the power of the dead.

316
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,760
A ghost trick!

317
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,980
Yeah, cue the credits!

318
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,640
All you have to do to perform a trick like that is press A.

319
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,820
Now the woman's fate has changed.

320
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,480
Albeit, just a little.

321
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,580
Yeah, she still has... she still kind of has a gun pointed at her.

322
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,820
Yes.

323
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,380
Hmm.

324
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,160
That's not good, is it?

325
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,740
But at least now you're starting to figure out how to use your powers.

326
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
So I enter the ghost world with ghost.

327
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,540
I... I go... I'm... I'm ghost!

328
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm gonna ghost all over the place!

329
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,740
Wait, let me put my hand down actually, now that I think about it.

330
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,580
Blasphemy, I know, but...

331
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,660
Just so you guys can see a bit better.

332
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm gonna ghost all over the place!

333
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Possess an object and then perform a trick with it, eh?

334
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,880
Bust in, bust in, bust in...

335
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,980
Now you're getting it!

336
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,460
Let's move on to the next step.

337
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,880
Try possessing a different core.

338
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,580
Okay.

339
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,280
Do I have a guitar?

340
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,840
I see, a guitar then, is it?

341
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,440
Ahem.

342
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,180
Wait, no, I was just moving!

343
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,120
What do you want from me?

344
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,720
I would have preferred that giant wrecking ball.

345
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,340
That would solve the problem real quick, I bet.

346
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,900
But I guess I can't reach cores that are too far away.

347
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,020
It's right there, it's not that far.

348
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,080
Well, I guess we'll see what you can do with that guitar.

349
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,640
Let's set time and motion again and find out.

350
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,300
Oh, am I gonna fail the tutorial?

351
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,620
Uh...

352
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,100
Who's there?

353
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,160
Ouch!

354
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,400
Oh, nice!

355
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,320
Hold it!

356
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,260
That's gotta be some of the slowest running away I've ever seen.

357
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,780
Oh, you couldn't reach for the wrecking ball, it's too far.

358
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,420
Got it.

359
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,580
Looks like I'm gonna have to come up with something more.

360
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,420
I can possess my dead body?

361
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,320
What core is close enough to possess from here?

362
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,100
I guess all there is, is me.

363
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,460
No time to be picky, I've got a woman to save!

364
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,320
I like your attitude.

365
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,380
It's admirable, truly, but...

366
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,820
But what?

367
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,740
If I can manipulate objects, I can manipulate my own body!

368
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,300
Hahaha!

369
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,540
Then I ought to be able to manipulate my own corpse, right?

370
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,540
Well, tell you what.

371
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,560
Why don't you just try it and see?

372
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,180
Go ahead and possess your corpse.

373
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,280
Okay.

374
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,000
Alright then.

375
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,880
Uh, now we'll set time and motion.

376
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,440
Go ahead and try A.

377
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,340
Is this gonna be really freaky?

378
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,660
Oh.

379
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,660
Nothing's happening.

380
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,520
Exactly.

381
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,360
Sad but true, I'm afraid.

382
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,780
You can only manipulate non-living things.

383
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,760
Um, I'm non-living!

384
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,960
Clearly!

385
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,940
Corpses, even though they are...

386
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,240
Oh my gosh.

387
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,840
Daniel!

388
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,780
Thank you for the...

389
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,380
Akasuma!

390
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,140
Hope you enjoy the game.

391
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
That's one of my all-time faves.

392
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,060
Much love, Minto.

393
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,660
Thank you!

394
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,700
Corpses, even if they aren't alive anymore, aren't really just ordinary things.

395
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,760
You've gotta be kidding!

396
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,380
This music is so Ace Attorney.

397
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,700
Wait.

398
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,720
What about the woman?

399
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,900
What's happening to her?

400
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,800
Let's take a look, shall we?

401
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,520
If you wanna take a look around, you can move the screen.

402
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,020
Oh.

403
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,440
Move the screen?

404
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:04,920
Um.

405
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't know what you mean by that.

406
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,520
Mysterious voice?

407
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,740
Uh, what is this?

408
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,660
Some kind of video game?

409
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,020
It's easy.

410
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,840
Give it a try.

411
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,760
Use the D-pad to move it in any direction you want.

412
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,280
Ooh.

413
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,060
Ooh.

414
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,400
Wow.

415
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,280
That was nice.

416
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,880
I love this game.

417
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,020
Hope you'll like it too.

418
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,480
Thanks!

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
Whenever you wanna see what's going on somewhere, just move the screen.

420
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:33,920
Okay.

421
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
I got it.

422
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,680
Minto, turn off the game console.

423
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,220
Right now, I wanna see what's happening to that woman.

424
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Of course.

425
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,140
Well, you know what to do, then.

426
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,220
Move the screen and see if you can find her.

427
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,520
There she is.

428
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,520
Well, sister.

429
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,280
This is it.

430
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,260
Press Alt-F.

431
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,740
F4.

432
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
You have to plug the controller into Port 4.

433
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,860
Two things are looking pretty dim right now.

434
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,100
My eyesight and your future!

435
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,380
No way!

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,940
She's dead!

437
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,680
Oh.

438
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,400
Oh.

439
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,020
Oh.

440
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,580
I didn't strum hard enough.

441
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,900
Ring-a-ling-a-ling.

442
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,040
The graphics in this look...

443
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,740
Is this a...

444
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,160
Is this like a remake?

445
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,620
I don't know.

446
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,520
Out of my way!

447
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,480
Oh my god!

448
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,440
Oh, it is a remake.

449
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,600
It looks so good.

450
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Or remaster.

451
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,600
Yeah.

452
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,960
Because it was a DS game, right?

453
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,220
Yeah.

454
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,220
So...

455
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,780
Oh my god.

456
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,440
Wait, someone, please pick up the phone!

457
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,260
It's done.

458
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,920
On my way.

459
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,020
Oh, and...

460
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,320
Whoa!

461
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
We look so cool.

462
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,160
Oh.

463
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,180
Oh.

464
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,860
Oh.

465
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,400
What was that?

466
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,420
Did he bow at me?

467
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,340
In the end, it looks like her fate remains unchanged.

468
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,920
So what good are these ghost tricks of mine?

469
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,420
But just as I was thinking this...

470
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,290
Oop!

471
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,050
Oop!

472
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,090
This lamp came...

473
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,490
Oh my gosh!

474
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,370
The Pixar lamp!

475
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,390
No way!

476
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,090
I'm talking to a lamp!

477
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,970
Oh no, my delusions are really acting up today.

478
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,270
Oh my god.

479
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,590
Oh my god.

480
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,270
Hello there.

481
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,490
How are you feeling?

482
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,490
Not very well, I imagine.

483
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,750
A terrible tragedy, what happened tonight.

484
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,130
Pixar real?

485
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,350
Ah, ignoring me, are you?

486
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,350
It's a little too early for you to be so stiff and cold, I'd say.

487
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,950
I love lamp.

488
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,210
So it was you.

489
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,130
You were that voice in my head, right?

490
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,730
Well, I wouldn't say voice, exactly.

491
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,870
The dead don't have voices, you see.

492
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,790
It's more...

493
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,210
Oh my gosh.

494
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,410
Wait.

495
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,270
Was the Pixar lamp murdered?

496
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,530
I don't know.

497
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,090
I don't know.

498
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,750
I don't know.

499
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,830
I don't know.

500
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,350
It's more like my thoughts were being beamed directly into your mind.

501
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,490
That's another little trick ghosts can do.

502
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,970
Yeah.

503
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,530
I can do that, obviously.

504
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,370
I do that to you guys all the time.

505
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,570
Any time you think about mint, it's me beaming into your mind.

506
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,650
Think about mint.

507
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,890
Think about mint.

508
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,810
Kushaaa.

509
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,070
Wow.

510
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,630
Just like that.

511
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,050
Let me read your mind.

512
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,830
Psycho Mintus.

513
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,490
It worked!

514
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,250
Hello Mint-ko-san.

515
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,430
You are cool.

516
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,590
Thank you!

517
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,310
Thanks for the super chat!

518
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,230
Looks like my ghost tricks didn't do much good.

519
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,150
Oh, rip.

520
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,770
Actual rip.

521
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,610
She still ended up just as dead as before.

522
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,810
How do I suddenly have mint choco ice in my hand?

523
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,770
That's true.

524
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,590
For now.

525
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,610
For now?

526
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,210
I still have more to teach you about the powers of the dead.

527
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,390
Your ghost tricks.

528
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,530
Who exactly are you anyway?

529
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,170
One of your fans.

530
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,150
Before I answer that, I think we should save this video.

531
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,970
Wait, how do we do that?

532
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,150
Isn't it a shame to see such a pretty young woman lying here like a discarded piece of trash?

533
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,930
Did I get give mint all your money beamed right into my head right now?

534
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,370
Thank you for the super chat!

535
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,170
Thank you.

536
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,050
The name's Pixar.

537
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,970
Disney Pixar.

538
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,430
But what can I do?

539
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,410
She's already dead.

540
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,930
Is she?

541
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,470
Time for more ghost lessons for you, my friend.

542
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,310
First of all, I'll have you possess me.

543
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,610
Possess you, eh?

544
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,910
Once you've done that, I'll tell you about another one of your powers.

545
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,890
I like the lighting in this.

546
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,850
Why am I so determined to save this woman?

547
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,450
After all, it's not like I know her.

548
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,710
But I guess I'll take the desk lamp up on his invitation anyway.

549
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,350
My reason is twofold.

550
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,690
I mean, what else do we have to do, right?

551
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,110
Number one, I'm not the type to leave women lying around this garden like trash.

552
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,390
Good job, ghost trick.

553
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,590
Mr. Ghost Trick.

554
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,050
And number two, I don't have anything else to lose at this point.

555
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,810
So true.

556
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,070
That's how I feel.

557
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,610
Trick time!

558
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,630
Uh, what is this?

559
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,010
X?

560
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,470
That thought bubble you just pressed.

561
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,950
Those are your thoughts.

562
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,090
What you're saying to yourself in your head.

563
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,250
No, I'm thinking?

564
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,930
Ah!

565
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,210
Ow!

566
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,510
My thoughts, eh?

567
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,550
So the dead don't have voices.

568
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,550
Men to my head told me to do this or she'd beat me up.

569
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,050
And what we think is communicated directly to one another.

570
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,530
So these thought bubbles are sort of a stand-in.

571
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,870
I think I'm starting to get it.

572
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,570
John Ghost Trick respects women.

573
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,530
Be like John.

574
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,550
Thank you for the super chat, you guys.

575
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,690
I think so too.

576
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,570
Just remember to always keep an eye out for thought bubbles.

577
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,750
Okay, good idea.

578
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,790
I might... I just might get some important clues from them.

579
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,270
Now then.

580
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,530
Possess me!

581
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,950
In order to possess me, you first have to enter the ghost world.

582
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,650
And L is your ticket in.

583
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,110
Oh my gosh, I'm ghosting, I'm ghosting.

584
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,870
The best thing to do is to try it.

585
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,670
LA?

586
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,690
Guess I'll press it.

587
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,490
I'm ghosting!

588
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,390
Door...

589
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,870
Traffic sign...

590
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,870
Oh, by the way, have you taken a look at the middle of the screen?

591
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,330
What about it?

592
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,850
It tells you what trick you can perform with the object you're currently possessing.

593
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,230
What does that mean if I put a mint in my mouth?

594
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,990
Oh, if it put a mint in my mouth.

595
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,950
Means brush your teeth more.

596
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,510
Don't forget to floss.

597
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,930
The information is there for you to check out whenever you need it.

598
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,970
So in the case of this folding cot, it looks like I can unfold it.

599
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,310
And to perform a trick on the object you're possessing, you first have to return to the land of the living.

600
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,870
Oh, okay.

601
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,730
This time B is your ticket out of the ghost world.

602
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,970
Well, good luck.

603
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,650
We're counting on you.

604
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,710
Who is this wii?

605
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,250
Flag...

606
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,370
Take me to dinner first.

607
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,870
Oh, I can't reach the phone.

608
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm a weak...

609
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,790
Wait, how do I get to the...

610
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,710
How do I...

611
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,910
Oh, so I have to figure out a way to...

612
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,030
Maybe if I un...

613
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,290
If I unfold it, maybe I can...

614
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,130
Trick.

615
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,610
There we go.

616
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,530
Now I'm closer.

617
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,370
Now I'm gonna ghost again.

618
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,490
Wait, what's that up there?

619
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,890
She's getting it.

620
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,070
Use the fan?

621
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,070
No, I got it.

622
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,590
I got it perfectly.

623
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,410
That's funny.

624
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,010
What is?

625
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,730
What's so funny?

626
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,550
She's a different color.

627
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,450
My corpse and her corpse.

628
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,910
There's definitely something different about the two.

629
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,390
There's something emanating from my corpse.

630
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,150
That's because...

631
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,590
You're dead!

632
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,670
Oh, I'm special.

633
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,990
I'm special.

634
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,870
What's that supposed to mean?

635
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,210
Not everybody who dies gets special powers, you know.

636
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,650
So those waves are because of my powers of the dead.

637
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,630
The smell of decay.

638
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,530
That's my stench wafting the dead smell.

639
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,190
Anyway.

640
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:37,950
Congratulations.

641
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,470
You passed.

642
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,490
Well, what do you know?

643
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,690
What prize do I get?

644
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,250
A new power.

645
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:44,950
What else?

646
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,370
Another one?

647
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,030
Now let's review.

648
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,090
You can possess objects and manipulate them, right?

649
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,890
Now what do you suppose will happen if you possess a corpse?

650
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,890
Nothing, because I already tried that, remember?

651
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,290
Nothing happened at all.

652
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,910
True.

653
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,410
You don't have the ability to manipulate a corpse.

654
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,150
But...

655
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,630
But?

656
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,430
I think it's kind of...

657
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,310
I don't even know her and I'm already, like, possessing her body?

658
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,630
Like...

659
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,770
And she's...

660
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,510
I mean, she's...

661
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,190
I...

662
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,030
She's, like, so beautiful.

663
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:18,930
I just...

664
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,410
He called her sister.

665
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,350
I mean, that doesn't mean we're related, right?

666
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,450
What if we're just a family?

667
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,650
Am I possessing my sister?

668
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,710
Help me, step bro.

669
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,250
I'm dead.

670
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,250
However, there's something else you can do.

671
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,370
Oh, yeah?

672
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,110
What's that?

673
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,450
Why don't you try it and see?

674
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,370
Oh, okay.

675
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,650
I would like a little bit of a warning, what I'm about to do.

676
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,330
I'm go...

677
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,110
I'm going ghost!

678
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,090
Oh, whoa.

679
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,390
What is that?

680
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,950
What's...

681
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,450
What's this?

682
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,430
Baby corn.

683
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,230
Thanks for the five.

684
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:54,770
Gifted.

685
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,230
Thank you.

686
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,080
Can you hear me?

687
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,220
It's you guys.

688
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,060
Wait a minute.

689
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,960
What's going on here?

690
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,460
Hmm.

691
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,340
Looks like she's unconscious.

692
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,960
Poor thing.

693
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,580
Unconscious?

694
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,340
But she's dead.

695
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,220
I don't know...

696
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,120
I know you don't like spicy food, but any chance of a Hot Ones podcast with Tara?

697
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,220
That's so funny you brought that up.

698
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,760
Robert?

699
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,890
I don't remember because I literally watched the Hot Ones...

700
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I don't know.

701
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,840
Do you call them episodes?

702
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,340
The Hot Ones video with Conan O'Brien earlier.

703
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,920
I love that guy.

704
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,600
He's so funny.

705
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,440
He's so crazy.

706
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,180
But think back.

707
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,560
Remember when you died?

708
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,680
He just started chugging it.

709
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

710
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,580
He's so unhinged.

711
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,980
It was the best episode.

712
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,800
It's so good.

713
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,060
If you haven't watched it...

714
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,740
I don't know.

715
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,600
Even if you don't know anything about Conan O'Brien, I think that episode will teach you everything you need to know about that guy.

716
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,460
When you came to your senses, you'd been unconscious too.

717
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,360
Unconscious, eh?

718
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,100
Mint, please wake up.

719
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,980
I'm alive.

720
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,420
I'm...

721
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,320
No, I'm not alive.

722
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm awake.

723
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,780
Come to think of it, the desk lamp is right.

724
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,780
When I came to, I was already dead.

725
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,660
How long had I been ass up there?

726
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,520
How long did they leave me like that?

727
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,700
Let's leave her like this for now.

728
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,800
And while she's resting, we can save her life.

729
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh, sure.

730
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,500
You make it sound so easy.

731
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,720
And it is easy.

732
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,920
When you use your powers on a corpse, you can go back to the past to a time four minutes before that person's dead.

733
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,320
Are you serious?

734
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,740
Back through time?

735
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,060
My new dream collab is Mint and Conan O'Brien.

736
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,640
Okay.

737
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,900
I'll do my best to have a collab with Conan O'Brien.

738
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,360
Someday.

739
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,740
Someday.

740
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,860
That's right, but there's a catch.

741
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,000
It only works on new corpses.

742
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,780
Corpses that have been dead for less than one day.

743
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,300
Then why didn't you do that on my body, huh?

744
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,320
And she's still wet.

745
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,400
So, well...

746
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,740
Fuck.

747
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,160
Sorry.

748
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,600
I was thinking, like, a fresh...

749
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,000
I was thinking, like, a fresh body.

750
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,820
Like, you know how...

751
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,900
Like, when you...

752
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,160
Okay.

753
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,080
When I think of, like, a fresh body, it's, like, meaty and wet.

754
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,860
You know what I mean?

755
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,140
So...

756
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,220
Girl.

757
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,270
She's still well within that limit.

758
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:55,950
Okay, you...

759
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,190
Okay.

760
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,210
I know what happened.

761
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,530
The T from the limit...

762
00:31:59,530 --> 00:31:59,970
What?

763
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,890
Went up, and it...

764
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,470
I didn't...

765
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,270
I just...

766
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,750
I only saw T...

767
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,630
I read too quickly, okay?

768
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,050
She's moist.

769
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,170
Oh...

770
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,290
Oh, no.

771
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,550
You've been holding out on us.

772
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,330
We knew you were a cute ghost maid, but we didn't know you also had a cute time traveling ghost maid.

773
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,490
I don't know...

774
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,770
I don't know if I have that powers.

775
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,770
You might want to give it a try before it's too late.

776
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:29,950
Oh, no...

777
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,930
But this is crazy!

778
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,030
None of it makes any sense!

779
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,850
We're talking about the powers of the dead here.

780
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,190
It doesn't have to make sense.

781
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,250
Now then, let's go, shall we?

782
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,830
To the time four minutes before this woman was murdered!

783
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,650
Hey, wait a second!

784
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,370
I still don't know what you're talking about!

785
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,010
You'll see.

786
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,270
You'll see.

787
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,050
Rewind time.

788
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,570
Ghosts only haunt wet corpses taking over.

789
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,310
Freshly moist.

790
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,590
We can't have the decay, you know?

791
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,450
So now I'm going back in time to witness this woman's last four minutes alive.

792
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,230
Not as a fuzzy distant memory of the past, but as a very real living present.

793
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,790
Four minutes before death.

794
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,110
Oh my gosh!

795
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,250
This music is so Ace Attorney.

796
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,230
Can you imagine?

797
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,110
Imagine if we, like, go back four minutes in time.

798
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,550
And, like, some person was just like, Woohoo!

799
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,410
Like somewhere, somewhere totally unrelated across the other side of the world.

800
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,590
They were like, I just won the jackpot!

801
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,710
The lottery!

802
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,790
But because we went back four minutes in time, and we're doing some butterfly effect.

803
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,450
For some, something is changing.

804
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:02,430
Where the guy is gonna, like, drop his ticket instead and just loses everything.

805
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,030
That'd be so sad!

806
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,170
Time paradox.

807
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,130
Wake up!

808
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,870
Are you okay?

809
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,090
What happened to you?

810
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,470
Oh no!

811
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,690
He's...dead!

812
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,570
Don't say it like it's a bad thing.

813
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,490
Mint Mike's da closet collab.

814
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,030
I can't, he's my Oshii.

815
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm too scared to collab with Oshii's.

816
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,220
Who are you?

817
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,500
Cucumber!

818
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,260
Welcome to membership.

819
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,820
Thank you.

820
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,840
I'm Skull Face.

821
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,300
This is brother.

822
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,280
Here's my business card right here, sister.

823
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
My little gold...oh!

824
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,640
My little golden friend.

825
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,520
You did this.

826
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,040
You killed him, didn't you?

827
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,320
Instead of playing whodunit right now, you ought to be more concerned about your own fate.

828
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,940
Who is she?

829
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,420
Who is he?

830
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,620
Why are we here?

831
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,800
I have so many questions.

832
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Who are you?

833
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
Some sort of a hitman?

834
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,000
What do you want with me?

835
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,480
They said we had to rub out all the last traces of Temsik left in this country.

836
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,300
Temsik?

837
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,720
What in the world is that?

838
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,720
It's me.

839
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,320
I just do what I...

840
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,900
How are you supposed to wipe out what you don't even know what it is?

841
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,540
All I know is you've got nowhere else to run to.

842
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,380
Time to die, sister.

843
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,840
Oh!

844
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,160
Oh, as long as that bad boy Wrecking Ball...

845
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,840
I sure hope this Wrecking Ball doesn't fall on my head and crush me.

846
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,440
That would be so bad.

847
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,840
As long as that bad boy Wrecking Ball stays right up there where it belongs.

848
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,620
Look, all I want to know is who are you?

849
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
You don't know me.

850
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,580
And I don't know you.

851
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,440
This is just business.

852
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,260
He's so cool.

853
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,280
So long, sister.

854
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,820
Oh!

855
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,520
Nice!

856
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,140
Oof!

857
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,820
Hold it!

858
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,700
Who's there?

859
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,620
Wait...

860
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,120
This is all that what we did before, but...

861
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,960
Hold it!

862
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,240
Shotgun?

863
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,960
What kind of a flashy weapon for a hitman don't...

864
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,240
Oh, kind of a flashy weapon for a hitman, don't you think?

865
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,420
Too shy to collab with Oshis, ma'am.

866
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,560
You did the exact thing the other day.

867
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,160
I know!

868
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
And look how it turned out!

869
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,800
Not flashy, just thorough.

870
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,180
They call me Nearsighted Jigo.

871
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,180
But I never let my prey get away.

872
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,800
Get this man some glasses.

873
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,700
Never thought about just buying a pair of glasses.

874
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,020
Well, sister.

875
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,240
This is it.

876
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,520
Oh my god.

877
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,900
No way.

878
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,920
That's her last words.

879
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Two things are looking pretty dim right now.

880
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,020
My eyesight?

881
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,840
Oh!

882
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,340
That's why he said his eyesight.

883
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,110
I love Nearsighted Jigo.

884
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,010
And there you have it.

885
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,830
The last four minutes of her life.

886
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,090
No!

887
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,350
It's kind of ironic when you think about it.

888
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,570
A woman toyed with by fate and a man toyed with by a ghost.

889
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,670
But she still died.

890
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,870
Yes.

891
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,330
And you can change that with your ghost tricks.

892
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,690
Just like you did four minutes ago.

893
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,990
Possess and manipulate, eh?

894
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,170
Ghost and then trick.

895
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,410
Man, they love title dropping.

896
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,190
They love it.

897
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,430
How is that ironic?

898
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,410
It's like rain on your wedding day.

899
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,810
It's the green...

900
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,010
Wait.

901
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,970
It's the...

902
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,130
It's the sun...

903
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,630
It's...

904
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,850
The light...

905
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,930
When you're already late.

906
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,350
Wait.

907
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,930
Green light?

908
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,990
Does that...

909
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,070
How does that make any sense?

910
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,290
Oh!

911
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,370
Free ride when you already paid.

912
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,690
Doesn't they say something when you're late?

913
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,690
Free ride when you already paid.

914
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,850
Oh.

915
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,410
It's the good advice that you just didn't take.

916
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,730
And who would have thought it mattered?

917
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,090
You can rewind these four minutes as many times as you like, too.

918
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:38,910
Oh, yeah.

919
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,310
Oh, my gosh.

920
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,010
I'm going to keep watching this lady die.

921
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,870
Yeah.

922
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:43,870
Drama.

923
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,190
Now, then.

924
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:46,830
Are you ready?

925
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,830
Yeah.

926
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,930
Let's do it.

927
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,530
My soul hurts with all the straw things.

928
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,670
Oh, my gosh.

929
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,070
Oh.

930
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:57,610
Okay.

931
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:58,730
All right.

932
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,230
Soul.

933
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,570
So, this is four minutes ago, eh?

934
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,490
Fine.

935
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,050
I get that.

936
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,090
What am I doing way down here?

937
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,030
That's just how it works.

938
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,890
Her corpse was your gateway into the past after all.

939
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,090
So, naturally, your starting point is where her corpse was.

940
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,430
This is where she died.

941
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,210
Okay.

942
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,070
I get it now.

943
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,270
My favorite show.

944
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,390
Lady dies on loop.

945
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,650
Oh.

946
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,510
Oh, my gosh.

947
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,250
It's not...

948
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,230
It's basically ReZero.

949
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,410
Hop in, then.

950
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,550
I'm ghosting.

951
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,310
Okay.

952
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,110
I'm in.

953
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:38,910
Oh, my God.

954
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,710
The time is going down.

955
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,650
Okay.

956
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,050
Good job.

957
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,290
There are only four minutes left before she dies.

958
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,050
You had better try and get to her as fast as you can.

959
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,690
There's no time to lose.

960
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,730
Who are you?

961
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,890
Oh.

962
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,090
Oh.

963
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,790
They're already...

964
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,310
Oh, my gosh.

965
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,030
She's already meeting him.

966
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,370
Let me play.

967
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:54,630
Oh, my gosh.

968
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,150
Time is passing.

969
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,890
The last seconds of her life are counting down.

970
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,970
Looks like I better get up there fast.

971
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,110
That's right.

972
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,990
Have a look at the right side of the screen.

973
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,410
The right side?

974
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,230
Oh, yes.

975
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,510
The sand meter.

976
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:10,870
Okay.

977
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,110
The sand in the top of that timer is how much time she has left.

978
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,950
Get to her quickly before all the sand is gone.

979
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,150
Up you go, then.

980
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,050
I'm going ghost.

981
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:23,570
Oh, wait.

982
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:23,870
Oh, my gosh.

983
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,030
Oh, my gosh.

984
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,210
Oh, my gosh.

985
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:24,230
Oh, my gosh.

986
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,250
Oh, my gosh.

987
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,570
Oh, my gosh.

988
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,250
Why did you make me go up?

989
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:27,690
No.

990
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,350
I'm going this way.

991
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,290
Wait.

992
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,430
Trick?

993
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:33,890
Okay.

994
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,290
Nice.

995
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,270
Ghost.

996
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:36,630
Up.

997
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,150
Can I turn this on?

998
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,230
And then maybe it will blow the flag so we can go up even higher.

999
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,030
Oh.

1000
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,610
Uh-oh.

1001
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,050
Wait a second.

1002
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:53,670
Oh.

1003
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,550
Oh.

1004
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,530
Turn off.

1005
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,550
Oh, okay.

1006
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,630
I think I have to be faster.

1007
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,570
I think I have to...

1008
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:05,770
Okay.

1009
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:05,990
Hold on.

1010
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,650
I think I have to turn it on.

1011
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,450
Trick.

1012
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,790
And then ghost.

1013
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,730
And then go.

1014
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,210
Okay.

1015
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,550
There we go.

1016
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,790
And then back.

1017
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,190
All right.

1018
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,290
Lift me up.

1019
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,370
Lift me up.

1020
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,770
And then...

1021
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,410
Oh, no.

1022
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:21,870
I can't reach.

1023
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,350
Oh, no.

1024
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:23,970
Oh, no.

1025
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,550
Oh, no.

1026
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,170
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1027
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,010
Am I trapped now?

1028
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,590
You guys.

1029
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,270
I think I...

1030
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,430
Not back seating but she dunked.

1031
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,070
I think I messed up.

1032
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,290
Oh.

1033
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:38,690
Oh.

1034
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,210
Thank goodness.

1035
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,170
Oh, my gosh.

1036
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,390
I knew that I dunked.

1037
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,570
Wait.

1038
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,550
How do I get up there then?

1039
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,610
She overcooked.

1040
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,870
Did I overcook?

1041
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:52,850
Okay.

1042
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:53,930
Trunk.

1043
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,630
Trick.

1044
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,690
Can I go up there?

1045
00:41:59,490 --> 00:41:59,970
Ghost.

1046
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,990
Oh, this rolls!

1047
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,610
Okay, I missed that.

1048
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,390
Trick!

1049
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,950
Nice.

1050
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,430
Open.

1051
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,930
I had an idea of something.

1052
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,010
Oh my god.

1053
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,290
Who are you?

1054
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,190
Some sort of a hitman?

1055
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,250
What do you want with me?

1056
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,150
They said that we had to... Come on, come on, come on.

1057
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,410
Time is passing.

1058
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,890
Her time is running out.

1059
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,610
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1060
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:34,850
Close.

1061
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,990
Close.

1062
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,750
The mannequin to this.

1063
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:42,970
But what?

1064
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:48,010
What will this... Turn on.

1065
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,350
Ah, I see, I see, I see, I see.

1066
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,390
So that will... Maybe it will catch on to the rope and then...

1067
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,930
And then it will rise me up?

1068
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:07,830
Maybe?

1069
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,150
There we go.

1070
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,610
Oh my gosh.

1071
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,150
So long, sister.

1072
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,250
Just a few more steps.

1073
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,830
Hope I may make it in time.

1074
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,690
Time is passing!

1075
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:22,890
Oh my gosh.

1076
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,350
Wait, there's so much time left though.

1077
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,330
Stop stressing me out, game.

1078
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,450
She's cooking.

1079
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,210
So I had the right idea earlier.

1080
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,330
I know what to do.

1081
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,250
Oof.

1082
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,490
Oh, oofie oof.

1083
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,390
Hold it.

1084
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,870
No, no, we want him to stand under the ball!

1085
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,730
Now's your chance to change your fate!

1086
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,910
There isn't much time left.

1087
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,970
This is coming down to a battle of seconds!

1088
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,230
Trick time.

1089
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,370
I'm... uh...

1090
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,470
Till death... wait... uh...

1091
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,890
Ring the bell... or pedal?

1092
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,690
Pedal to the metal... ring the bell...

1093
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,110
Hmm...

1094
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,700
He didn't like the... the guitar startled him before, so let's try ringing.

1095
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,160
What's going on here?

1096
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,260
Nearsighted Jigo never misses, as long as the target is within point blank range.

1097
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,880
Nearsighted Jigo never misses, as long as the target is within point blank range.

1098
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,740
Run far away!

1099
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,820
Uh...

1100
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,520
It looks like you made it in time.

1101
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,620
Just barely.

1102
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,940
Yep, she's still alive!

1103
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,980
Bro, get glasses for real!

1104
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,340
And in that split second, hope was born.

1105
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,760
Just now her fate was changed, albeit ever so slightly.

1106
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:48,740
Yippee!

1107
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,560
Oh, oh no, her leg.

1108
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,040
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

1109
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,700
The bridge is up!

1110
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,180
Uh-oh.

1111
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,820
Trick time!

1112
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,680
Uh...

1113
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,080
Uh...

1114
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,580
Pedal?

1115
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,760
Can I... oh wait, X...

1116
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,240
You said her fate was changed.

1117
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,380
Hyper Miracle...

1118
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,640
Positive girl!

1119
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,540
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1120
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,480
But it looks like she's still in the same predicament.

1121
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,680
I said her fate was changed ever so slightly.

1122
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,300
What is this junkyard drawbridge?

1123
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,000
Right?

1124
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,680
Do they have a moat or something?

1125
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,200
Hold on, I'm gonna take a bite of my food.

1126
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,180
I have some chicken... and rice.

1127
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,160
Guess I'm gonna have to take care of that guy once and for all.

1128
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,120
But there isn't much time left, depending on what you do.

1129
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,340
There is still the possibility of failure.

1130
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,200
You're so good at being a ghost, what's your secret?

1131
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,180
A laundry list.

1132
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,180
I don't want to think about failure now.

1133
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,840
No, of course not.

1134
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,740
But still...

1135
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,020
If you ever feel like you want to start over...

1136
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,240
Just tap R before time runs out.

1137
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,440
Although you may never know...

1138
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,200
You might learn a thing or two when time runs out too.

1139
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,700
Ooh...

1140
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,040
Alright, I'll keep that in mind.

1141
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,080
But right now, I better go after those two.

1142
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,460
Oh

1143
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,660
no, there was a bubble!

1144
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,520
My bad.

1145
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,720
I got so excited.

1146
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,060
You hear something?

1147
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,060
No?

1148
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,180
That'd be like crazy.

1149
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,020
He's under it again.

1150
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,440
Oh yeah, he is.

1151
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,080
We can extend the ladder.

1152
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,820
Oh, I can't wait to get this...

1153
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,860
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited for these to get like super complicated.

1154
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,680
I'm not gonna lie.

1155
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,460
I came in like a wreck.

1156
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,700
How does it feel to save a lady's life?

1157
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,260
I killed someone else in the process!

1158
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,600
Oh my god, now he's gonna haunt me.

1159
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,180
So the danger is gone?

1160
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,620
Yes, it looks like the danger...

1161
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,260
Mr. Danger, in fact, rolled away somewhere.

1162
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,480
He got Looney Tooned.

1163
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,760
Yahoi!

1164
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,560
You used your powers to avert that woman's fate.

1165
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,760
What if she is like a really bad person?

1166
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,120
What if she like...

1167
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,340
What if she like...

1168
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,040
Created a drug that's gonna turn everybody...

1169
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,240
The whole world into zombies and we just...

1170
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,080
That guy was trying to prevent that.

1171
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,840
And we...

1172
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,680
We just...

1173
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,360
We just...

1174
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,000
We just doomed the whole world.

1175
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,720
If bad, why cute?

1176
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,640
So true, though.

1177
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,080
Don't you know Nearsighted Jigo?

1178
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,720
He's...

1179
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,720
He's a cut boss fight from Metal Gear 1 for the MSX.

1180
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,100
It does sound like...

1181
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,520
His name does sound like that.

1182
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,280
It could be though, right?

1183
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,740
Mint is the danger.

1184
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,180
No!

1185
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,680
What are you talking about?

1186
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,620
So I did all that, huh?

1187
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,880
You most certainly did.

1188
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,600
And I knew you could do it.

1189
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,880
Fate averted!

1190
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,480
Woohoo!

1191
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,500
So I lost my life tonight.

1192
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,140
And saved somebody else's life.

1193
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,340
Yippee!

1194
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,990
When I came back to the present...

1195
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,870
It was raining.

1196
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,410
Oh my gosh.

1197
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,830
Am I gonna be her ghost boyfriend?

1198
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,190
I had saved the life of this stranger.

1199
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,430
Now sitting forlornly in the rain.

1200
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,150
Aww.

1201
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,490
Even as the story of my life on this planet comes to an end.

1202
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:39,710
Achoo!

1203
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:40,750
Bless you.

1204
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:43,130
Oh no.

1205
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,150
A stranger.

1206
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,390
That word strikes a chord.

1207
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,150
And a terrible truth begins to dawn on me.

1208
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,290
She could be the bad guy?

1209
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,230
I can't recall a thing.

1210
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:56,390
Tasukaru.

1211
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,770
So cute.

1212
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,050
Who am I?

1213
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,870
What is this place?

1214
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,670
The most important...

1215
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,670
Impa...

1216
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,470
Clearly not important if I can't even say it.

1217
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,990
Most important of all.

1218
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,410
Why was I killed?

1219
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,240
I wonder that every day.

1220
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,100
Your story isn't over yet.

1221
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,020
Oh my gosh.

1222
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:24,280
Wait.

1223
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,760
Is this gonna end with us like...

1224
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,640
Moving on?

1225
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,160
And...

1226
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,060
You know...

1227
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,720
That's so sad.

1228
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,200
Who exactly are you anyway?

1229
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,390
Just call me Ray.

1230
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,110
As in...

1231
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,550
Ray of light in the darkness.

1232
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,310
Ray, huh?

1233
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:45,730
No way.

1234
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,350
Metal Gear Ray.

1235
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,210
No spoilers.

1236
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:49,590
Yeah.

1237
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,170
This is my first time playing this game, so...

1238
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,250
Oh, I should have written that, right?

1239
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:52,750
Oh.

1240
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,170
Oh.

1241
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,050
There's something really...

1242
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,790
That I...

1243
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,170
Here.

1244
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,330
I came up with this idea.

1245
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,970
If you ever see spoilers in the chat...

1246
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,870
Like maybe someone posts something...

1247
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:01,710
That's just like...

1248
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,590
Alluding to something.

1249
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,750
Um...

1250
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,410
Or...

1251
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:04,750
Just to...

1252
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,710
Just a straight up spoiler...

1253
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,210
Uh...

1254
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:06,810
Use...

1255
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,150
Smiley faces...

1256
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,830
To get...

1257
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,570
To push it...

1258
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,070
Off...

1259
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,830
Of the...

1260
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,230
Screen.

1261
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:12,450
But...

1262
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,670
So that way I don't read it.

1263
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,330
But...

1264
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:16,590
If I'm like cooking...

1265
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,150
And I maybe think of something...

1266
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,410
Don't use smiley faces.

1267
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,450
Because I don't think I'm correct.

1268
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,250
I'll be like...

1269
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,110
Maybe I'm onto something.

1270
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,210
You know what I mean?

1271
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,930
Well, that's a new and novel idea, right?

1272
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,430
Isn't it kind of genius?

1273
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:34,730
I'm kind of...

1274
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,150
No one else has ever thought of that.

1275
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:38,250
Ever...

1276
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,270
I'm a genius.

1277
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,380
Frowning for cooking.

1278
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,560
Ray, huh?

1279
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,800
So you aren't going to tell me your real name.

1280
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,560
I take it.

1281
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,200
You haven't told me your name yet.

1282
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,320
Actually...

1283
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,680
I'm Mr. Trick.

1284
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,380
I'm Mr. Ghost Trick.

1285
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,300
I can't remember.

1286
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes, I guess the memory is of the newly departed...

1287
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,960
No, I'm Minto!

1288
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,340
Minto cute.

1289
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,320
That's the worst spoiler of them all.

1290
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,020
And that is... to disappear.

1291
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,800
Disappear?

1292
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,420
Ban that guy.

1293
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,800
I understand...

1294
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,780
I understand the issue.

1295
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:06,960
I understand the intent.

1296
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,060
But other people might get confused too.

1297
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,280
And I'd rather...

1298
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,340
I don't know.

1299
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,200
I don't want anything fake spoilers.

1300
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,340
Unless it's overly jokey.

1301
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,220
We'll just not do any spoilers at all.

1302
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,580
Minto is actually Patrick Swayze.

1303
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,280
Oh my darling.

1304
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,990
I long for your touch.

1305
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:40,290
Pottery...

1306
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,370
I'd like to use them to save somebody else's life.

1307
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,670
And who's life might that be?

1308
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,810
I don't know.

1309
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,170
Grandma?

1310
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,530
She's gonna cross the street.

1311
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,430
Doesn't realize a truck is coming.

1312
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,170
Minto's secretly big bull.

1313
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,010
But errr... dies off screen.

1314
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,370
Do you even have to ask?

1315
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:02,650
Mine, of course.

1316
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,450
I see.

1317
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,730
Thank you!

1318
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,270
Thank you!

1319
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,690
I'm actually a lamp.

1320
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,830
A ray of lightmack.

1321
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:17,830
A of lightmack!

1322
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:18,370
Oh my gosh.

1323
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,830
Metal gear ray of lightmack.

1324
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,310
But think about it this way.

1325
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:27,230
If we could use ghost tricks to save ourselves...

1326
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,430
Wouldn't I have tried to save myself as well?

1327
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:30,630
I mean, look at me.

1328
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:31,870
I'm a desk lamp.

1329
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,150
But also...

1330
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,450
Why didn't you disappear?

1331
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,970
Can we save the desk lamp then?

1332
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:39,370
Because...

1333
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,670
If the desk lamp is still here...

1334
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:43,610
Why doesn't...

1335
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:44,730
Why haven't we...

1336
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,330
Wait...

1337
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,970
How long have they been around for?

1338
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,950
I was only half heart at least.

1339
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:49,410
Spoiler?

1340
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,070
Okay.

1341
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,810
No, stop.

1342
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,570
Why a desk lamp anyway?

1343
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,890
I'm not really sure myself to be honest.

1344
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,990
But in any case, it seems we are unable to use our powers on our own corpses.

1345
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,390
Time to go find our little desk friend.

1346
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,370
You're kidding!

1347
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,550
You'll only exist in this world until tomorrow morning.

1348
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,750
How do you even know that?

1349
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,650
I'm afraid that fact can't be changed.

1350
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,250
So there's really no escaping my own death?

1351
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,350
Okay, desk lamp.

1352
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,130
Why also did you not try to save me?

1353
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,910
In the morning, I'm going to cease to exist.

1354
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,330
Apparently, there's nothing I can do to change that.

1355
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,790
But just the same, I still want to know...

1356
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,630
I want to know my story.

1357
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,450
The lost story of my fate.

1358
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,190
Right up until the time of my death.

1359
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,670
Until I learn that.

1360
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,110
You won't be able to rest in peace, right?

1361
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:44,270
Yeah.

1362
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:45,950
Very well.

1363
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,390
I understand how you feel.

1364
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,370
You want to go and learn the truth about your death.

1365
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,210
As well, you should.

1366
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:54,810
I will.

1367
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:55,930
But let's see.

1368
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,810
How should I go about doing that, I wonder?

1369
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,170
Can't even imagine what the first step would be.

1370
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:01,850
The first step?

1371
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:02,630
That's easy.

1372
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:03,750
You start with her!

1373
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:07,290
Sneeze!

1374
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,650
I predicted the future.

1375
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,590
The person who witnessed your death.

1376
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,310
She should have some important clues, don't you think?

1377
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:18,970
She's so cute.

1378
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,250
Hey, you're right.

1379
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,810
Not only that...

1380
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,050
She might even know who I am!

1381
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,050
Tasukaru.

1382
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,590
Yes, I'd say there's a very good possibility of that.

1383
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,370
What was I doing here tonight in a place like this?

1384
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,970
That woman probably knows the answer.

1385
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,490
Hi, Minto.

1386
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,030
Hello!

1387
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,270
That's right.

1388
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,570
Never forget that.

1389
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,050
She is the key to everything tonight.

1390
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,530
The key to everything?

1391
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:47,570
What do you mean?

1392
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,490
You'll know soon enough when you regain your memory.

1393
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,050
Yeah, I'm like a baby.

1394
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,190
I'm like a newborn baby.

1395
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,030
I'm like a blank sheet of paper right now.

1396
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,370
I should probably keep some sort of record of everything I learned tonight.

1397
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,570
That's a very good idea.

1398
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:13,250
Press ZL to view a record of what you've learned.

1399
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,750
And be sure to check it out now and then.

1400
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,450
Okay.

1401
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,970
Memories aren't always the most reliable things after all.

1402
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,110
My court record.

1403
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,630
Phone book.

1404
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:30,170
Alright then, I wish you good luck.

1405
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,450
Trick time.

1406
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,030
So if we go to our...

1407
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,570
Me.

1408
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:41,930
The mystery.

1409
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,270
Red-headed target.

1410
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:45,830
Oh no.

1411
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,270
Come on.

1412
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,010
Why would you mute her sneeze?

1413
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,770
Ray of light.

1414
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,770
Hunter in the dark.

1415
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,550
He calls himself Nearsighted Jigo.

1416
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,110
But he's gone now due to an unfortunate accident.

1417
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,870
I kind of miss him, not gonna lie.

1418
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,830
I lost my life at a lonely spot on the outskirts of town.

1419
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:08,450
What?

1420
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,950
Yeah, an accident.

1421
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,010
Saved her with my powers of the dead.

1422
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:17,850
He taught me the secrets.

1423
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:19,670
Okay.

1424
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,230
I'm going ghost!

1425
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,250
If I trick...

1426
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,240
I better not let her out of my sight.

1427
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,020
Besides, I'm not the kind of guy who can just let a woman sit sneezing in the cold rain.

1428
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,080
I think I'll try to move closer.

1429
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:41,600
Yeah, yeah.

1430
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,840
That's what I'm trying to do.

1431
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,140
Yes.

1432
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,740
Oh, shimmy.

1433
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:49,980
Shimmy, shimmy.

1434
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:52,960
There we go.

1435
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,400
Shimmy.

1436
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:53,920
There we go.

1437
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,660
There we go.

1438
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,780
She's still sneezing!

1439
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,480
Wait, how can I...

1440
00:58:59,480 --> 00:58:59,860
There she is.

1441
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,080
She's just...

1442
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,480
She's still sneezing in the rain.

1443
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,840
Trying to get closer to him.

1444
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,200
Yeah.

1445
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,340
I'm going ghost.

1446
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,400
Oh!

1447
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,100
We can give her the umbrella!

1448
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:13,940
That's so cute!

1449
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,620
Oh it's a miracle.

1450
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,990
What in the world just happened?

1451
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:30,390
The crane moved all by itself, and then that big iron ball fell all by itself?

1452
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,450
It started raining... wait, that's just how the weather goes.

1453
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,730
That's just how the weather works.

1454
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,430
It started raining all by itself, and then an umbrella came down all by itself?

1455
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,610
Oh my goodness.

1456
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,770
Don't tell me I have psychokinetic powers!

1457
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,910
Yes.

1458
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,310
You are the chosen one.

1459
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,920
You guys, I almost bought Arona's...

1460
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,400
Someone was selling Arona's umbrella on Mercari.

1461
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,840
And it was really expensive, so I didn't buy it, but I thought about it.

1462
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,980
I was like, I should buy this.

1463
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,360
It's expensive, but it's cool.

1464
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,900
A cat!

1465
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,220
Best game... oh, best game ever!

1466
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,200
Oh!

1467
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:19,600
Okay.

1468
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,340
Disrespect my body like that.

1469
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,780
My Lupin looking ass.

1470
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,600
But then it sold out, and I was so sad.

1471
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,800
Oh, um... looks like she's saying something to herself.

1472
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,400
Unfortunately, I can't hear from here.

1473
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:35,600
Oh!

1474
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,660
That's no problem for a ghost like us, as long as your target's not too far away.

1475
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,420
Just like you do with your own thought bubbles.

1476
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,680
If you tap the thought bubbles of the living, you can listen in on them, what they're saying.

1477
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,240
Maybe I'll just take a little listen then.

1478
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,180
Always watch for the thought bubbles of the living.

1479
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,800
They might give you some important clues.

1480
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,200
Interesting.

1481
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,200
Seriously, what in the world just happened?

1482
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:03,980
It's me!

1483
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,740
Oh!

1484
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,840
What's this?

1485
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,620
Some kind of note.

1486
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:10,980
Okay.

1487
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,840
I want to see that note.

1488
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,880
I wonder what I wrote on it.

1489
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,220
It's not just a shopping list or something.

1490
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,640
Or hopefully it's not just a shopping list.

1491
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,460
That wouldn't help.

1492
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,200
Should I check it out?

1493
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,020
Okay, cool!

1494
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:26,720
Examine.

1495
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,720
I am now the note.

1496
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,420
Did I write this note?

1497
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,660
Maybe I should give it a read.

1498
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,440
By beating Nearsighted Jigo, you got card key 1!

1499
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,880
Now you enter the base, Outer YouTube, and destroy Metal Gear Algorithm.

1500
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,280
So you don't remember writing it, eh?

1501
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:47,540
So you don't remember writing it, eh?

1502
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,120
No, I don't remember writing it.

1503
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:50,880
But even more importantly...

1504
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,280
No, I don't remember writing it.

1505
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:53,500
But even more importantly...

1506
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,240
Uh-oh.

1507
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:55,860
Uh-oh.

1508
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,620
Don't answer it.

1509
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,540
No, no, no!

1510
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,360
No, no, no!

1511
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,680
Why would you do that?

1512
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,380
Hello?

1513
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,120
I didn't get a chance to read the note!

1514
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,960
Not to interrupt your train of thought, but...

1515
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,240
I wonder if he realized where this telephone call is coming from?

1516
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,480
How would I know that?

1517
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:17,560
Think back.

1518
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,400
Before you helped to revert her fate.

1519
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,900
Didn't a telephone call come in around at this time too?

1520
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,360
Oh yeah!

1521
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,800
No!

1522
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,000
Oh my god, he's so cool.

1523
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,840
Going down the stairs.

1524
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:33,960
It's done.

1525
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,200
I'm on my way.

1526
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:37,680
No!

1527
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,340
That telephone call!

1528
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,400
Exactly.

1529
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,640
In other words, at this very moment...

1530
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,500
on the other end of this telephone line...

1531
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,720
is the culprit who ordered your murder!

1532
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,280
What?

1533
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,360
Um...

1534
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,320
I'll take a pizza...

1535
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,420
or cheese...

1536
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,940
I recommend you possess the telephone.

1537
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,040
Once you've done that, I'll tell you about another one of your ghost tricks.

1538
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,360
Oh my gosh.

1539
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,180
Trick time!

1540
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,840
I'm going ghost.

1541
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,660
I'm possessing.

1542
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,200
And then I saw him.

1543
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,980
Right there on the other end of the line.

1544
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,000
He ordered me dead!

1545
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,060
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

1546
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,900
What does he look like?

1547
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,820
He's probably so cool.

1548
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,400
He's probably so mysterious.

1549
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,660
No!

1550
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,760
I got killed by grandpa.

1551
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,660
Is it done?

1552
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,260
Look at this...

1553
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,580
Look at this tiny guy!

1554
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,460
His oversized notebook and everything.

1555
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,160
He's got so many pictures of himself.

1556
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,600
Speak up, man.

1557
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:58,940
Did you get her?

1558
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:01,380
Yes.

1559
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,020
Who is...

1560
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:02,640
Who is this?

1561
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,100
Yes.

1562
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,700
A thousand pardons, my dear lady.

1563
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,420
I must have dialed the wrong number.

1564
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:16,810
Trace complete.

1565
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,410
So that's him, eh?

1566
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:21,030
The man who stole my life!

1567
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,170
We don't know that yet though, right?

1568
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,630
Bet the note says she did it.

1569
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,170
Probably, right?

1570
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,690
Hold on, I'm gonna have another bite of food.

1571
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,530
I have to like pick up the plate.

1572
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,890
And like move it over.

1573
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,110
And then...

1574
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,310
Put it back.

1575
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,450
Because I don't have much room on my desk.

1576
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,770
Yum yum.

1577
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,320
Mogu mogu.

1578
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,540
No, this guy was after her.

1579
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,920
We don't know if he was after you.

1580
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,520
That's right.

1581
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,740
So what do you think?

1582
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,160
Would you like to go see him?

1583
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,920
You better believe I would.

1584
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,060
Then you would do well to listen to me.

1585
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,340
We ghosts exist by possessing inanimate objects.

1586
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:13,600
However...

1587
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,380
There is one way we can move from place to place over great distances.

1588
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:17,960
There is one way we can move from place to place over great distances.

1589
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,820
Through the phone.

1590
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,500
The internet.

1591
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:21,920
Oh my gosh.

1592
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,060
Become a digital ghost.

1593
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,200
Become a Vtuber ghost.

1594
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:28,940
Me.

1595
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,360
And that would be...

1596
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,860
The dead can jump from point A to point B.

1597
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:36,080
The dead can jump from point A to point B.

1598
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,280
By moving over phone lines.

1599
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,820
Say woo!

1600
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,080
I've done all I can do to help you.

1601
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,900
You'll have to do the rest yourself.

1602
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,560
No!

1603
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,300
No Ray!

1604
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,640
Don't leave!

1605
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,380
You're not coming with me?

1606
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,040
I'm afraid not.

1607
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,180
I've grown weak.

1608
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,040
I've already used up most of my remaining strength just to get here tonight.

1609
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:00,720
But why?

1610
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,700
Why are you here?

1611
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,620
How do you know me?

1612
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,100
But I had to come to ask for your help.

1613
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,320
Always wanted to play this game but...

1614
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,680
It's on my ever growing backlog.

1615
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,880
So I'm happy to see you play it.

1616
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,380
Thanks Kinky!

1617
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,680
Hope you like it.

1618
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,520
Me too.

1619
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,360
Let's have fun together.

1620
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,220
My help?

1621
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,300
Many mysterious things will happen in this town tonight.

1622
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,220
I'm trusting in you to get to the bottom of them.

1623
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,560
And find out the truth.

1624
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,600
You're the only one who can do it!

1625
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,440
You're the only one who can do it!

1626
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,500
I want you to use your powers of the dead to find this truth!

1627
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,520
I want you to use your powers of the dead to find this truth!

1628
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:35,840
I want you to use your powers of the dead to find this truth!

1629
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,840
I'm grateful to you.

1630
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,940
For everything you've done.

1631
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:39,800
Lampy.

1632
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,820
But I can't promise I'll help.

1633
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,600
Tomorrow morning I cease to exist.

1634
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,580
That doesn't give me a whole lot of time.

1635
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,380
I need to pursue my own mystery.

1636
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,120
Find out the truth about myself.

1637
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,280
That's more than enough.

1638
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,480
Huh?

1639
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,720
If you succeed in doing that.

1640
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,320
You'll have done what I asked anyway.

1641
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,800
The two are one and the same.

1642
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,880
One and the same?

1643
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,240
Let's get you to 200,000 subs mint!

1644
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,260
Hashtag winning ghost.

1645
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:11,900
Thank you!

1646
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,400
Yeah!

1647
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,360
I'll do my best!

1648
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,780
This desk lamp knows a whole lot more than he's telling me.

1649
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,620
Now then.

1650
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,200
From what I call a moment ago.

1651
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,400
You have the culprit's telephone number.

1652
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,060
The rest is all up to you.

1653
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,640
We're going here.

1654
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,600
SYS 1729.

1655
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,240
Here we go!

1656
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:51,780
Nice.

1657
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,380
Nice.

1658
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,380
And so the story of the search for myself begins.

1659
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,160
And so the story of the search for myself begins.

1660
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,220
A story that will last one night only.

1661
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:01,740
A story that will last one night only.

1662
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,840
Tomorrow morning I will cease to exist.

1663
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,820
And I'm surprisingly okay with this fact.

1664
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,500
I have to...

1665
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,840
I have to find the answers before the sun comes up.

1666
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,080
I have to find the answers before the sun comes up.

1667
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,940
Why was I killed?

1668
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,140
And what exactly is going on to happen...

1669
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,340
going to happen in this town tonight?

1670
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,180
We have to haunt Dr. Weird's blue cousin.

1671
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:21,740
We have to haunt Dr. Weird's blue cousin.

1672
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,010
Oh!

1673
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:26,870
Oh!

1674
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,270
Illustrations.

1675
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,750
Cleared 7.02 to 7.31 pm.

1676
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:33,570
Music?

1677
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,050
Four minutes before death?

1678
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:36,730
Oh my gosh!

1679
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:37,670
Look at him!

1680
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:39,590
Sure.

1681
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:40,530
We'll save.

1682
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,190
Save.

1683
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:42,510
Yes.

1684
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:43,270
Continue playing.

1685
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,430
How long have I been?

1686
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,410
An hour to get through the tutorial, guys.

1687
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:46,970
Let's go!

1688
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,050
7.31 pm.

1689
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:52,730
Who am I?

1690
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,070
Why was I killed?

1691
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,590
The one who is sure to know the answers to those questions is the man who ordered my murder.

1692
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:07,610
At the other end of the phone line is the very man who had me killed.

1693
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:08,790
Our meeting.

1694
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,970
It's all so sudden.

1695
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:14,610
Who is that massive guy on the right?

1696
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,530
A Mr. X?

1697
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:21,230
I'm not sure I'm really prepared for what's to come.

1698
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:21,990
Me neither!

1699
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,630
I'm not sure I'm really prepared for what's to come.

1700
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,670
Hmm.

1701
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,290
Yes.

1702
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:38,030
If what I read in this file is true, this woman could be quite a bedeviling bit of trouble for us.

1703
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,430
She needs to be erased.

1704
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,310
Tonight.

1705
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:45,730
Confound that nearsighted Jigo.

1706
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,350
His skills are as feeble as his eyesight.

1707
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:48,910
His skills are as feeble as his eyesight.

1708
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,070
Not to worry, sir.

1709
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,730
I have already taken the next steps, sir.

1710
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:56,870
I have already taken the next steps, sir.

1711
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,390
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1712
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,870
Oh my gosh.

1713
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:58,330
Whoa!

1714
01:09:58,510 --> 01:09:59,110
He's hacking!

1715
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:07,090
Oh my god, they have her three sizes and everything!

1716
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:07,890
Oh my god, they have her three sizes and everything!

1717
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:07,950
Oh my god, they have her three sizes and everything!

1718
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:08,130
Oh my god, they have her three sizes and everything!

1719
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:08,910
Hmm.

1720
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:09,490
Yes.

1721
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:13,910
Would I say the last thing I ever expected was to talk to the target herself.

1722
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,550
Even if it was only over the telephone.

1723
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,170
I must admit to my guard I'm a good man.

1724
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:22,090
It put me in quite the tizzy there for a moment.

1725
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,690
What is this place?

1726
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,790
These oddly luxurious furnishings.

1727
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,630
This oddly refined music.

1728
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,510
Oh no, the music's diegetic.

1729
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,850
And that odd little machine.

1730
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,870
I've never seen a room like this before.

1731
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,630
But one...

1732
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,830
They got her 3D debut.

1733
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:42,810
Yeah!

1734
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,310
One thing's for sure.

1735
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,670
These people are assassins.

1736
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,730
And what's more, they're blue!

1737
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:56,190
Oh, the red-headed woman is another one of their targets.

1738
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,930
Strider, welcome to membership.

1739
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:58,470
Thank you!

1740
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,810
That file the old man has.

1741
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,830
Maybe it'll give me some information on my red...

1742
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,690
My red head?

1743
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,000
Trick time!

1744
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,500
I'm going ghost!

1745
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,040
What's this thing?

1746
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:25,920
I can't reach it.

1747
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,380
Time to examine.

1748
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,940
Girl looks like a rooster.

1749
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:31,440
Stop!

1750
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,440
A very cute rooster.

1751
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,220
Like the cutest rooster.

1752
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,170
Seems this file contains information about that red head.

1753
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,810
But I can't read it when it's closed.

1754
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:47,030
Oh, thank you.

1755
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:50,150
Great Scott!

1756
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,170
Did you see that?

1757
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:54,170
The file, I say!

1758
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,330
Wait, what voice did I have for this guy?

1759
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:56,810
I can't remember.

1760
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,110
It sounds like maybe he's British.

1761
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:04,090
Wait...

1762
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:11,650
The file reared up and snapped at me, my good man.

1763
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:13,470
Nearly bit my head off.

1764
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,370
Not to worry, sir.

1765
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,890
I've already seen to it that the target Miss...

1766
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:20,690
Miss Lynn!

1767
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,130
Is no longer a threat, sir.

1768
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:24,650
It's my darkness!

1769
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,190
Bah!

1770
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,230
That's not what I'm talking about, man!

1771
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,090
Glasses out for nearsighted Jiro.

1772
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,190
Hmm, Lynn, eh?

1773
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:35,850
So that's her name, is it?

1774
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:38,890
But this file...

1775
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,510
It's like it's written in a foreign language.

1776
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,330
Oh no, we forgot how to read!

1777
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,070
I can't read it at all!

1778
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:49,790
Might I suggest putting away the file and relaxing, sir?

1779
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,310
Beep, beep, beep!

1780
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,270
We're gonna watch VTubers!

1781
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:56,330
Oh!

1782
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:58,750
Whoa!

1783
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,490
This place is so fancy!

1784
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,170
Beep, beep, beep!

1785
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,040
That's so cool!

1786
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,220
It turns back into the chandelier?

1787
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:11,820
Wow!

1788
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,920
You have a very important job ahead of you tonight, sir.

1789
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,200
Ah, yummy.

1790
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,720
I'm gonna possess the grapes.

1791
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,040
Dang it!

1792
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,660
No vore tonight, everybody.

1793
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:27,900
Let's see...

1794
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,420
Projector...

1795
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,240
Lamp...

1796
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,980
Let's operate this thing.

1797
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:37,920
Darn.

1798
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,860
This is a pickle?

1799
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,340
No, those are grapes!

1800
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,020
The phone and I got put away neatly.

1801
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,660
The only thing I've learned is that the name...

1802
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,740
is the name Lynn.

1803
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,640
This sure is a weird room.

1804
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,240
Travel through the...

1805
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,480
Travel through the phone line to get here.

1806
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,320
But where exactly is here?

1807
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,760
And who exactly are these people?

1808
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:01,940
Boo!

1809
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,320
Ah, you like it!

1810
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:05,780
Thank you!

1811
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,900
Thank you, thank you!

1812
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:07,680
Boo!

1813
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:08,560
Yes, boo!

1814
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,100
Am I lagging, by the way, sometimes?

1815
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,100
I can't tell.

1816
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:14,940
God, man!

1817
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,520
What are you trying to give me?

1818
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,580
A case of the vapors?

1819
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,460
My apologies, sir, but I did not touch it, sir.

1820
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,980
It appears the equipment is still malfunctioning, sir.

1821
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:27,220
Bah!

1822
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,900
Granted, technology is...

1823
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,940
Granted, technology is certainly a convenient thing.

1824
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,940
I'm smooth.

1825
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:41,650
But our use of it is just plain off, confound it.

1826
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,390
Hmm, yes.

1827
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:48,670
In any case, I don't wish to see the face of our current target, my good man.

1828
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,570
As you wish, sir.

1829
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,470
In that case, might I suggest this, sir?

1830
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:55,270
Beep!

1831
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,490
It changes to...

1832
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:02,650
Oh, my gosh, I was thinking it changes to like a Mint Phantom stream.

1833
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,090
Might I suggest this, sir?

1834
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,090
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

1835
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,470
Opens up Vtuber stream.

1836
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:10,990
Hey, that's...

1837
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,160
Mmm, yes.

1838
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:16,500
Cecil?

1839
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,260
If all goes well with our deal tonight, we will have the power to change the world, sir.

1840
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,000
Yes, sir.

1841
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,960
Hmm, yes.

1842
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,080
It's a very important night indeed, my good man.

1843
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,100
We cannot afford to make mistakes.

1844
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,020
Sissel...

1845
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,820
That is why we can't afford to trust that Sissel.

1846
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,360
No, we must be very careful.

1847
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,620
John Sissel Ghost Trick.

1848
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,400
Sissel!

1849
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,960
That must be my name!

1850
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,360
Now that I hear it, it does sound familiar.

1851
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,000
A deal, eh?

1852
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,940
What could that be all about?

1853
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,740
So what exactly was I up to, I wonder?

1854
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,280
No, sir.

1855
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,740
Yes, sir.

1856
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,900
Thank you for the no, sir.

1857
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,260
We are completely prepared for tonight, sir.

1858
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,620
Hmm, yes.

1859
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,680
Now all we have to do is pluck the fruit of success.

1860
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,740
One thing's clear.

1861
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,660
These villains seem to know me.

1862
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,180
Infinite Grapes.

1863
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,200
I wish.

1864
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,360
How can we make this a reality?

1865
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,360
And another thing...

1866
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,140
There seems to be some kind of connection between me and this Lin.

1867
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,660
Why else would our names both come up here like this?

1868
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,840
Hmm, going Ghost.

1869
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,160
I'm going Lamp.

1870
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,480
Can't... I guess we gotta... Oh wait.

1871
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,560
I can't reach.

1872
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:04,680
Ugh.

1873
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,120
Ugh.

1874
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,260
Curse this tiny, wispy body of mine.

1875
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,140
Okay, let's just operate the lamp again.

1876
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,120
Or the projector.

1877
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,240
Where is your head, man?

1878
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,320
I told you I don't wish to see this face.

1879
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,040
My apologies, sir.

1880
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,200
It appears to be another malfunction, sir.

1881
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,620
Well, get it fixed, man.

1882
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,140
Unless you want to see me.

1883
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:27,860
Malfunction.

1884
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,440
Certainly, sir.

1885
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,960
I'm gonna make this guy go crazy.

1886
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,820
These guys murdered me, and now they're targeting the redhead.

1887
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,860
What kind of connection do we have with each other?

1888
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:52,470
Spinning this painting around makes the old man's head spin.

1889
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:53,290
But that's about it.

1890
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,290
Got to find the right timing and get...

1891
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:56,370
Ahhhh.

1892
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:00,050
Um...

1893
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:05,470
When it spins...

1894
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,670
Oh, I can possess the painting.

1895
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:07,730
Okay, okay, okay.

1896
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:09,270
Um...

1897
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,970
Okay, okay.

1898
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,590
I got it.

1899
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:13,350
There we go.

1900
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,190
First try, baby.

1901
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,470
A love connection.

1902
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,910
Ooh la la!

1903
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:23,890
My apologies, sir.

1904
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:25,230
Okay.

1905
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:26,670
Certainly, sir.

1906
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:34,920
Very good.

1907
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,860
These guys murdered me, and now they're... Oh yeah.

1908
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,660
What kind of connection?

1909
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,360
La la la.

1910
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,040
Oh, what's he saying?

1911
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,320
I say, this room is giving me the heebie-jeebies, my good man.

1912
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,420
What?

1913
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:50,860
With paintings spinning around and the like, it's enough to give the man... a man the jitters.

1914
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,660
My apologies, sir.

1915
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:54,720
The room was just completed recently, sir.

1916
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,320
We're still trying to iron out the kinks, sir.

1917
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,140
Hmm, yes.

1918
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,960
I just hope that's all it is.

1919
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:02,860
Haha.

1920
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,060
Little did I know.

1921
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,380
I'm causing chaos... in their workplace.

1922
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,760
Get your heads out of the gutter.

1923
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,400
Get your heads out of the gutter.

1924
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,210
I mean...

1925
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,150
EGAD, man!

1926
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,730
How am I supposed to relax and enjoy my grapes?

1927
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:38,550
So true.

1928
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:40,550
Okay, we can operate that.

1929
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:43,330
We can become fruit.

1930
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:45,330
Look, we're just a little fruit!

1931
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:47,810
Oh no, he's gonna eat us for real.

1932
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:48,550
Okay.

1933
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,610
Let's operate this now.

1934
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:53,630
Trick!

1935
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,400
Goodbye, fruit.

1936
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:06,140
It's a miserable state of affairs when I can't even be startled by a telephone that doesn't even ring.

1937
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,180
Wah!

1938
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:07,820
EGAD!

1939
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,120
Become fruit.

1940
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,960
It's even more pathetic to be startled by the same telephone twice.

1941
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:15,800
Bah!

1942
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,380
The problem must be solved, sir.

1943
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,660
Dismiss Lynn's problems, sir.

1944
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:21,760
What?

1945
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:22,500
Lynn?

1946
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,820
Hmm, yes.

1947
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,160
You did mention taking the next step a moment ago.

1948
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,320
Didn't you, my good man?

1949
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,080
You were saying?

1950
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,540
Yes, sir.

1951
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:36,020
I sent one step ahe- Wait, one step ahead tango.

1952
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:36,720
Hahaha.

1953
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:37,720
Hahaha.

1954
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,180
So we had...

1955
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,620
Nearsighted Jenga, and now one step ahead tango.

1956
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,840
So that's what he meant by being one step ahead?

1957
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,340
A telephone...

1958
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,100
That telephone call must be him reporting in, sir.

1959
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,740
Very good.

1960
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,820
Oh no, is she dead?

1961
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:03,840
Uh-oh.

1962
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,620
Lynn is in danger again!

1963
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,600
I'm going ghost!

1964
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:10,800
Oh!

1965
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,980
Here we go.

1966
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:15,500
Hahaha.

1967
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,120
This is one step ahead tango.

1968
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,160
I'm at the target's apartment now.

1969
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,720
And out with it, man!

1970
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,120
Have you taken care of her?

1971
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,400
No, she isn't back yet.

1972
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:31,900
What?

1973
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,300
Does she have fish?

1974
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:33,820
Is he a fiend?

1975
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:34,340
Is she eating her fish?

1976
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,160
It only stands with reason- Oh, to reason.

1977
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:42,020
If the target got here first, they wouldn't call me one step ahead, now would they?

1978
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,500
That's so true.

1979
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,520
At her apartment, he's one step ahead?

1980
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:48,920
Exactly!

1981
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,080
I don't get it.

1982
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:59,420
But in any case, man, once you've taken care of her- Then you'll promote me to the head of the hitman division?

1983
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:00,820
Bah!

1984
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:01,600
No, man!

1985
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,680
You're even getting one step ahead of me!

1986
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,760
We can discuss my new salary later.

1987
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:08,800
Great Scott!

1988
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:12,100
Now you're even getting one step ahead of your last one step ahead!

1989
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,800
This guy's so ambitious, we love it.

1990
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,020
We love a guy boss.

1991
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:17,540
Girl boss?

1992
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,560
I'll get back to my job now, sir.

1993
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,040
Confounded!

1994
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,280
You're even hanging up on one step ahead!

1995
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,640
Yes, girl boss, that promotion!

1996
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:28,480
Yes!

1997
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,330
What did he say, sir?

1998
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:39,750
He asked me to raise his salary.

1999
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,530
This game is so goofy.

2000
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:45,010
What will you do, sir?

2001
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:48,990
Maybe I'll give him some of nearsighted- Oh, Jigo!

2002
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:53,130
Oh, Tango and Jigo.

2003
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:56,870
I called him- I called him Jango, I think.

2004
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,270
Jigo, Jigo, Jigo.

2005
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:01,370
That makes sense.

2006
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:01,870
Jigo.

2007
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,910
Jigo Tango.

2008
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:05,950
I go.

2009
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,730
We go.

2010
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,650
Jigo Tango.

2011
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:09,690
One go.

2012
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:10,490
Two go.

2013
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,290
Blue go.

2014
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:12,010
Red go.

2015
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,530
Nearsighted ahead Jango.

2016
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:19,450
I can't lose her!

2017
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:22,350
She's my only lead if I ever hope to solve the mystery of me!

2018
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:25,230
Here we go!

2019
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:29,090
Oh my gosh, we're going to her apartment!

2020
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:31,510
How exciting.

2021
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,940
Jigoku and Tengoku.

2022
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:41,740
That's so...

2023
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:46,360
He did not kill the dog.

2024
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,200
Did he kill the dog?

2025
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:00,280
No!

2026
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:10,980
The telephone line guided me to Lin's apartment.

2027
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,860
Fortunately, Lin isn't here yet.

2028
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,500
But unfortunately, the hitman is.

2029
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,720
Oh my gosh.

2030
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,260
She's got like giant...

2031
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,100
Giant like...

2032
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,180
What are those cheesy rings?

2033
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,620
And a bowl.

2034
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,000
And there are a couple of other unfortunate little developments waiting for me, it seems.

2035
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,540
No!

2036
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:31,940
Oh!

2037
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:32,660
Who is that?

2038
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:33,640
Oh my gosh.

2039
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:33,900
What?

2040
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,080
Hmm.

2041
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,100
It looks like there's an unlikely...

2042
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,900
Unlucky little lady here tonight.

2043
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,480
No, not an unlucky little lady.

2044
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,480
I didn't even unlock the door.

2045
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:44,560
Oh!

2046
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,080
That's a dog.

2047
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:45,920
No!

2048
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:47,720
No, no, no!

2049
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,520
That's a dog.

2050
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,840
A poor brave little warrior.

2051
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,940
We'll save him, we'll save him.

2052
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,560
We'll save him.

2053
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,460
He must have been trying to defend his mistress.

2054
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:57,260
No!

2055
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,260
Not the dog.

2056
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:06,380
If Lin came home now, I have to do something about this situation and fast.

2057
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:11,100
Can we go back in time and save the dog?

2058
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:11,760
Oh!

2059
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:12,920
Well, that's it.

2060
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:14,080
I'm gonna go back in time.

2061
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,300
I think we can.

2062
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,280
And more to the point, who am I?

2063
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,840
Oh, wait, the dog can talk?

2064
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,240
Who am I?

2065
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:43,240
I guess that explains why this dog is talking to me right now.

2066
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:49,860
This is your mistress's apartment, and you are... presumably the little doggy who died here.

2067
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:51,820
Died?

2068
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,060
So I'm dead, woof?

2069
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,020
Let's see, the dead lose their memories.

2070
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,920
They even forget what they look like.

2071
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,240
And so that's what this blue flame shape is all about.

2072
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,740
Oh, woof!

2073
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,720
There's no time to lose, woof!

2074
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,640
Miss Camilla!

2075
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,140
My Miss Camilla is in trouble, woof!

2076
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,060
You mean you remember?

2077
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,620
You know who you are?

2078
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:20,820
Woof!

2079
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,240
That's right, I'm Missle!

2080
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:28,420
Missle!

2081
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,420
Nice to meet you!

2082
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,140
I'm a Pomeranian!

2083
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,020
Woof!

2084
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:37,740
Wow.

2085
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:41,380
I guess now I know it's possible for the dead to regain their memories.

2086
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,200
Missle.

2087
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,000
Thanks to this little doggy.

2088
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,700
Miss Camilla!

2089
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,260
Miss Camilla!

2090
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:56,640
My Miss Camilla is in trouble, and I vow to devote my life to protecting her, woof!

2091
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:57,860
Oh my gosh, pretty!

2092
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,420
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

2093
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,180
Thank you so much!

2094
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:01,780
Thank you!

2095
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,260
But I died before I could rescue her.

2096
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,060
How could I let her down like this, woof?

2097
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,600
So you're more worried about your mistress's safety than your own death, eh?

2098
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,360
I like your moxie, little doggy.

2099
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,300
Looks like it's time to go back to four minutes before this little guy's death.

2100
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:23,240
This time to save... time to save this... wait.

2101
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,040
Time...

2102
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,220
That's not me, right?

2103
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:31,180
Time to save... this... his... life.

2104
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,720
Time to save this his life!

2105
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,060
Updated the phonebook.

2106
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:44,720
Rewind.

2107
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:55,980
And I saw that I could open up the door of the... door we possessed right before possessing the Maison de Amida.

2108
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:57,780
Let's see.

2109
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:01,460
First of all, I'd better see what I can find out before your death, little guy.

2110
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,480
Excuse me, but... where exactly are we?

2111
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:05,440
Huh?

2112
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,340
You... you follow me?

2113
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,440
I followed you.

2114
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,560
You brought me with you.

2115
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,860
One or the other.

2116
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:12,800
Hmm.

2117
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,700
It looks like the dead can move around together.

2118
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,760
This is the land of four minutes before your death.

2119
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:19,900
Really?

2120
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:20,960
We're really here?

2121
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,580
So that means you're going to save Miss Camilla, doesn't it?

2122
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:29,100
Missile both in Ghost Trick and in Ace Attorney is based on Shu Takumi's Shiba.

2123
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:30,880
He passed away a few years ago.

2124
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,700
Oh no!

2125
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:37,040
So the doggo's name is Nikita or Stinger.

2126
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,220
Looks like a Nikita to me, right?

2127
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:43,420
Missile...

2128
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:45,860
Aren't you even surprised?

2129
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:49,100
I mean, we just traveled through time and... not especially.

2130
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,000
I mean, Miss Camilla can walk around on two legs, but I can't do that.

2131
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,340
So if she can do that, then it's not so strange that you can walk backwards through time.

2132
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,140
So that's the way your mind works, eh?

2133
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:01,940
I guess that's reasonable enough.

2134
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,240
Sorry.

2135
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,560
Come on, come on!

2136
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:07,380
Let's get started!

2137
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,920
First, we watch your last four minutes unfold.

2138
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,020
Then we use what we learned to save Camilla.

2139
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,540
Just like when I saved Lin at the junkyard.

2140
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,960
If we watch closely, we ought to be able to get a few leads.

2141
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,120
Keep your eyes open!

2142
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,640
Of course!

2143
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,900
Leave it to me to sniff out a few clues!

2144
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:30,840
Okay.

2145
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,020
Oh, she's under the couch for...

2146
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:34,560
some reason?

2147
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,620
She's so cute!

2148
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,200
Yippee!

2149
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,260
I found the revolt!

2150
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:45,120
Oh, that is so... How are you able to watch anything?

2151
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,460
Oh my god, the dog is doing otagei.

2152
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,760
Oh, who the heck is that?

2153
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,360
Oh my...

2154
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,420
Shut that mutt up!

2155
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:01,460
No, Missile!

2156
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,020
You're not supposed to bark!

2157
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:13,200
The art here... particularly reminds me of... Poppin'.

2158
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,120
The lady next door is crappier than ever tonight.

2159
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,800
If it barks again... I'll knock this wall down!

2160
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,900
Kind of Mega Man?

2161
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,200
Maybe if I would... Poppin' mention.

2162
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:34,980
Lady hate.

2163
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:35,500
Yeah!

2164
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:36,820
Lady hate.

2165
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:42,880
Yeah, who's gonna pay for... I don't think knocking the wall down is gonna solve your problems.

2166
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,300
I think it's gonna make it even worse.

2167
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,700
Actually, Ace Attorney missile came before, then Shu Takumi's missile, then Ghost Trick missile.

2168
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,260
Whoever sent the super chat before you got an actual lead.

2169
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:02,180
You don't want her to knock down the wall, do you?

2170
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,380
Why do you like to bark so much anyway?

2171
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,080
Um, actually...

2172
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,340
You sure are cute.

2173
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,980
But just don't get us killed, okay?

2174
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:22,420
Ish.

2175
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,700
Darn, I really wanted to watch TV too.

2176
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:27,440
Hey, I know!

2177
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,380
I'll listen to music!

2178
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,040
La la la la la la...

2179
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,840
Oh no, that's why she probably couldn't hear the guy...

2180
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:35,700
Who, uh...

2181
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,300
Okay, so we're gonna have to...

2182
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,200
Oh.

2183
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:39,760
Whew, that was close!

2184
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,600
We're gonna have to knock her music into the water.

2185
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,860
So that she can't hear.

2186
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,460
Or so she can't listen.

2187
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:47,460
Because otherwise she's gonna miss the guy.

2188
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,320
I'm in the mood for donuts tonight.

2189
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,280
Look at the tail.

2190
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,760
It's just like her.

2191
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,700
It's like her hair.

2192
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,200
Oh no, no...

2193
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,040
What?!

2194
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,120
Oh my gosh, do we have a rat infestation?

2195
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,960
Uh oh, he's gonna bark.

2196
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:04,760
Oh no!

2197
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:10,880
I'll knock this wall down!

2198
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,580
Oh my god, this is so bad.

2199
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:16,220
Remy?

2200
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:20,840
Why...

2201
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:23,200
Why has he got like a scope like that?

2202
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:24,860
Hmm.

2203
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,540
I don't really like it when jobs outside the original scope crop up.

2204
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,100
I have to put it down as a separate charge.

2205
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,920
And accounting never likes that.

2206
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,860
Oh my god, point blank!

2207
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,900
But I guess it can't be helped.

2208
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:38,900
Sorry, kid.

2209
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,180
I'm...

2210
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,020
Did it show anything?

2211
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:43,860
I closed my...

2212
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:50,110
Did it show anything?

2213
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,230
Because I closed my eyes.

2214
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:51,770
I couldn't watch.

2215
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:53,250
It faded to white?

2216
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:53,810
Okay, good.

2217
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,550
Oh my god.

2218
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:59,510
So that's the whole dramatic story of what happened four minutes before you died!

2219
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:02,490
Wow, look at that!

2220
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:03,230
I'm dead!

2221
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:04,970
I'm kind of shocked to tell the truth.

2222
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:07,930
Okay, let's get started on saving her!

2223
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:10,110
Let's see.

2224
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:11,550
How are we going to do this?

2225
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:15,870
Seems to me the easiest way would be for you to take a big bite out of that man's leg.

2226
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:17,950
I don't think I could do that.

2227
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:23,550
Whenever somebody I don't know comes around, all I want to say to them is, Welcome!

2228
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,170
I can't help it!

2229
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:29,650
This dog is so cute.

2230
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:31,830
What a good boy.

2231
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,370
Who's a good boy?

2232
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:34,730
Who's a good boy?

2233
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:41,510
Okay, then I guess the only thing we can do is to get the little lady to help herself somehow.

2234
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:43,750
I don't think she could do that.

2235
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:46,610
Did you notice her putting those red things on her head?

2236
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,550
Oh, you mean the headphones.

2237
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,610
Whenever she puts those red things on, that's it!

2238
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:55,470
I can call her name until my throat is sore, but she never hears me!

2239
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:56,870
That is very dangerous.

2240
01:33:56,870 --> 01:34:01,170
I feel so much anxiety if I...

2241
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:04,110
Because you know how most earbuds nowadays have...

2242
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:05,450
What's the word?

2243
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:12,870
You can do noise cancelling, and then you can do where you have the...

2244
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:19,990
It's where you can hear the world as well.

2245
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:25,750
Transparency?

2246
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,590
Transparent mode?

2247
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:28,270
Pass through?

2248
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:29,090
Something like that.

2249
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:30,850
I guess it depends on what earbuds you have.

2250
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:32,170
Ambient mode?

2251
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:33,670
I think mine is called ambient mode.

2252
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:37,970
But yeah, if I'm not in ambient mode, I get so much anxiety.

2253
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:40,670
Because it's like...

2254
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:42,110
I only have...

2255
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,070
I only do noise cancelling on planes.

2256
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:46,410
But...

2257
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,910
Girl didn't even hear a gunshot.

2258
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:48,270
I know!

2259
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,050
That's what I'm saying!

2260
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:53,690
To be perfectly honest, I hate those red things.

2261
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:55,470
You're right.

2262
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:59,530
With those headphones on, our little lady doesn't even hear the sound of the intruder's gun.

2263
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:01,730
So maybe that's our first lead.

2264
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,050
Now we know...

2265
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:05,290
We have to do something about that.

2266
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,710
I'm scared!

2267
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:11,590
I'm nervous!

2268
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:14,070
Trick time!

2269
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,410
I'm going ghost.

2270
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,210
Alright.

2271
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:17,870
Open the door.

2272
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,530
We can extend it!

2273
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:21,710
Okay.

2274
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:23,410
Extend.

2275
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:25,070
Extend.

2276
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:25,590
It doesn't...

2277
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:26,690
Retract?

2278
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:27,190
Maybe?

2279
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:28,550
Oh.

2280
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,450
So close!

2281
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,670
You almost knocked those red things down!

2282
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:34,950
I think you're onto something there.

2283
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:36,530
If we drop them in the fish tank...

2284
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:36,730
See?

2285
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:37,470
I said it earlier.

2286
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:38,830
We have to drop them in the fish tank.

2287
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:42,110
Camilla won't be able to use them anymore.

2288
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:45,990
But if we drop them in the fish tank, Miss Camilla will get a scolding from Miss Lin.

2289
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,210
All you have to do is pretend it was your fault.

2290
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:51,610
That's the way of the honorable warrior.

2291
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:53,550
Okay.

2292
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,030
180 IQ?

2293
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:59,070
Are you calling me stupid?

2294
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,210
180 IQ?

2295
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:06,810
Like a genome soldier?

2296
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:09,530
Are you calling me dumb?

2297
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,440
180 is good though.

2298
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,080
I don't know.

2299
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,260
I played Metal Gear.

2300
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,040
You've obviously never seen Miss Lin when she gets mad.

2301
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,080
I think she'll understand if...

2302
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,360
Let's see.

2303
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,860
We have a telephone.

2304
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,040
What happens if I open this?

2305
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:44,350
I think the dog is barking.

2306
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:50,050
There's nothing else I can reach though.

2307
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,770
If I extend it again...

2308
01:36:58,590 --> 01:36:59,370
Oh wait.

2309
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:00,070
Okay.

2310
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:00,990
I saw the check mark.

2311
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:01,890
I see.

2312
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:06,310
It's a little over there.

2313
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:06,690
...

2314
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:07,110
...

2315
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:09,610
Hmm.

2316
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,090
Is there any...

2317
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:14,790
...

2318
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:15,290
...

2319
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:21,910
...

2320
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:22,350
Can I dial?

2321
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,010
Oh that's funny.

2322
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,290
Wait, what's wrong?

2323
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,550
This telephone doesn't seem to be working right now.

2324
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:31,210
Usually the telephone line glows red, but it's dark right now.

2325
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:35,090
Looks like I can't use the telephone line in the 4 minutes before death roll.

2326
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:35,370
Okay.

2327
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:36,930
Wheeee.

2328
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:38,910
Hmm.

2329
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,020
Hold fast-forward through already red dial to the bottom of the screen.

2330
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,220
Oh, thank you!

2331
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,280
You literally called yourself stupid at the start of the stream?

2332
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:00,630
There's stuff over there!

2333
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,410
I want to see it.

2334
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:03,290
Hold on.

2335
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:11,100
This is where she says you're not supposed to bark...

2336
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,380
Do I just keep trying?

2337
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:17,800
No...

2338
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,620
It's not gonna work.

2339
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,120
I can't get close to anything.

2340
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,060
This is where she says...

2341
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:27,400
Oh, no!

2342
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,120
I didn't mean to...

2343
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,580
I pressed X instead of Y.

2344
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,140
How do I fast forward?

2345
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,060
Oh, there we go.

2346
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:34,680
Nice.

2347
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,100
This is where she says...

2348
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,320
Well, maybe we have to time it when she listens to the music, right?

2349
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:43,500
So...

2350
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,520
Maybe when she grabs it, we extend it.

2351
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,660
We knock it out of her hands.

2352
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,840
Time is passing.

2353
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:58,660
Nice.

2354
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,340
There we go.

2355
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:02,580
Oh, no!

2356
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:03,760
Darn!

2357
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,300
How did I manage to do that?

2358
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,740
Lynn just bought those headphones too!

2359
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:11,480
Wrecked.

2360
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:13,960
Whoopsie.

2361
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,060
How about if we tell her you did it, Missile?

2362
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,400
Everybody 07 for this honorable warrior taking the fall.

2363
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:25,700
Missile.

2364
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:26,680
Missile.

2365
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:27,600
Missile 07, Missile.

2366
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,400
Your fall will not be in vain.

2367
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,170
Woof woof.

2368
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:46,050
Darn.

2369
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:47,490
Now, I can't even listen to music either.

2370
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,310
I think the gods are playing tricks on me tonight.

2371
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:53,870
Forgive me, Miss Camila.

2372
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:55,890
I'm only doing it to save you.

2373
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:00,290
So what?

2374
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:01,750
Now you think you're one of the gods, eh?

2375
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:03,450
I'm a god.

2376
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:06,370
I'm a god!

2377
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:08,530
Huh?

2378
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:09,090
No.

2379
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:10,170
Never mind that.

2380
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:15,190
The important thing is we managed to change the situation.

2381
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:16,230
Sorry, I'm like chewing.

2382
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:17,870
That's true.

2383
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:22,130
At least we can now use the little lady's ears to help us.

2384
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:24,730
DJ Cat, welcome to membership.

2385
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:25,430
Thank you!

2386
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:27,910
Oh, we got more time.

2387
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:39,520
Mood for donuts tonight.

2388
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,080
Hello.

2389
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,600
The question is, what do we do now?

2390
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:47,380
Yeah.

2391
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,040
Mio-chan, welcome to membership.

2392
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:51,620
Thank you!

2393
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:55,100
Unless we do something more, the outcome will still be the same.

2394
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:58,500
If only I had big strong teeth and an aggressive spirit.

2395
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,320
The god of maids.

2396
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,740
Doesn't it seem like we can stop the hidden man from coming in?

2397
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,820
So, yeah, um, do you not lock your doors?

2398
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,040
I have an idea.

2399
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:14,720
Why don't we hide Miss Camilla?

2400
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:16,680
Hide, huh?

2401
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:21,040
That sounds just like the kind of idea a little doggy would come up with.

2402
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,880
Are you making fun of me?

2403
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,360
But where could a little lady hide in this room?

2404
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,340
We have the Christmas tree.

2405
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,680
We have under the couch.

2406
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,160
I think I might have just the place.

2407
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,980
But there's just one little problem.

2408
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,280
How to get Miss Camilla in there, right?

2409
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,740
Oh, sorry.

2410
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,320
My friend Emory is playing Mario.

2411
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:44,300
Exactly.

2412
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,280
If I could possess Camilla herself, the answer would be easy.

2413
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,780
But I can't do that, so I guess the only way to do it is to lead her here.

2414
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,040
Now, what can I do using the objects in this room?

2415
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,220
I think I'll try out various things and see what I can come up with.

2416
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:01,960
And I'll be here watching, cheering you on.

2417
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,960
Okay, now I can possess this.

2418
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,280
We can rock the bowl.

2419
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,900
Let's rock the bowl.

2420
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,180
Time is passing.

2421
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,620
I'm sorry, little mouse.

2422
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,000
Sorry, I just unplugged my controller.

2423
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,960
There we go.

2424
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,080
Because I thought it was... I was charging it while I was playing.

2425
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:42,680
Okay.

2426
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:44,360
Sorry.

2427
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,820
Maybe that stopped the dog from barking though, right?

2428
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:49,780
Move.

2429
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:55,480
If you bark like that, you'll make the lady next door start howling.

2430
01:42:56,020 --> 01:43:00,060
If you keep this up, that wall is going to come down on our heads before we know it.

2431
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,960
But you'll protect me from anything if anything bad happens, right, Missile?

2432
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:05,860
Of course I will.

2433
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:09,440
That's quite a big promise for a little fellow.

2434
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:12,560
The poor little guy is up against some formidable opponents.

2435
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,540
The man in black and the woman in purple.

2436
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,500
What about the... wait, the rat.

2437
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:21,700
Maybe she needs to see the rat and hide from it because she's scared, right?

2438
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:24,360
We might have to redo.

2439
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,960
We might have to redo.

2440
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,520
Maybe she gets scared of the rat.

2441
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,080
Time is passing.

2442
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,380
Why do you always give your mistress so much trouble?

2443
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,620
Guess I'm truly embarrassed by my own behavior.

2444
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:45,540
But when that little guy starts squeaking, it gets me all in an uproar.

2445
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,780
And when I bark, Miss Camilla always comes over and gives me a nice hug.

2446
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,700
We might be able to take advantage of that for...

2447
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,200
Take advantage of that piece of information.

2448
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:57,540
Huh?

2449
01:43:59,360 --> 01:43:59,800
How?

2450
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,300
Wherever the donut falls, the rat shows up to check it out.

2451
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:03,940
Oooh.

2452
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,860
And then you go and bark at the rat.

2453
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:10,260
And then our little lady comes to you and to quiet you down.

2454
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,660
That's just the way things work, I'm afraid.

2455
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:18,240
So in other words, the donut can be the bait that will lead the little lady to where we want her.

2456
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,920
Okay.

2457
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:26,310
What's that up there?

2458
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:31,990
Oh my god.

2459
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:32,770
Oh my god.

2460
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:33,070
Sorry.

2461
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:34,190
Sorry.

2462
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:36,610
Sorry.

2463
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:36,730
Sorry.

2464
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:37,850
Oh my god.

2465
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:38,190
Please.

2466
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:38,710
Missile.

2467
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,130
You're stressing me out.

2468
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:47,270
Let's try moving again.

2469
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:49,630
Oh no, it goes back to the other spot.

2470
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:53,150
Where'd the donuts go?

2471
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,570
It's written into your jeans.

2472
01:44:57,690 --> 01:44:58,570
The destiny to bark.

2473
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:02,630
Over here.

2474
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:09,270
There's no way I can get over in these spots yet.

2475
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:11,790
So let's drop another donut.

2476
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:17,050
She's reaching for the donuts again.

2477
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:19,850
So cute.

2478
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:23,470
Okay, you rock.

2479
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:27,110
Oh, it didn't work this time.

2480
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:29,830
Damn, she is downing those donuts.

2481
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:32,290
I can't make another donut fall.

2482
01:45:33,070 --> 01:45:34,050
What do we do now?

2483
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:36,150
Without the donut, the squeaky guy won't come in.

2484
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:36,730
I won't bark.

2485
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:40,590
Looks like only one donut will fall.

2486
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:44,050
But the donut is the only bait that will lead the little lady to where we want her.

2487
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:46,070
Maybe I should rethink my plan of attack.

2488
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:53,970
I mean, this plays and we can...

2489
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,090
make her bark, right?

2490
01:45:58,590 --> 01:45:59,310
Oh my god.

2491
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:03,350
I might have to redo, yeah.

2492
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,530
But let's...

2493
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:07,690
It's said that maybe we should sometimes wait until the end.

2494
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:12,590
So let's not just stop right now, I think.

2495
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:16,730
The spinning Santa.

2496
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:18,470
Can I reach it?

2497
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:19,490
Oh, I can, I can.

2498
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:19,890
Nice.

2499
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,170
Oh, but I can't reach anything.

2500
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:26,730
Oh, rotate faster.

2501
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:28,130
Whee!

2502
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:30,430
Yeah!

2503
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:31,610
Oh my god.

2504
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:37,190
Oh, I'm so close.

2505
01:46:41,650 --> 01:46:42,190
Nice.

2506
01:46:42,970 --> 01:46:43,510
Latch.

2507
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:43,930
What's this?

2508
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:46,350
Oh.

2509
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,250
Oh, time is passing.

2510
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:49,170
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

2511
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:54,930
Okay, there we go.

2512
01:46:55,570 --> 01:46:56,110
Okay.

2513
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:58,070
Okay.

2514
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,730
Oh, wrong.

2515
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:01,310
Okay, there we go.

2516
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:02,070
What's this?

2517
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:03,610
Rock the painting?

2518
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:06,650
That didn't do anything?

2519
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:07,830
Okay.

2520
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:14,790
Maybe let's rotate slower.

2521
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:18,310
The painting rocked.

2522
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:20,010
Yes.

2523
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,130
Okay, nice.

2524
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:21,970
We can get to the lamp.

2525
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:23,490
We can get to the door.

2526
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:25,650
This will open it and do that.

2527
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:27,950
And then we have a little ball.

2528
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:28,750
A little ball for the dog.

2529
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:29,530
Right?

2530
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:32,370
You sent that thing flying.

2531
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:35,670
I like to tidy up by shoving eyesores under the sofa.

2532
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:38,830
How come you're looking at me when you say that?

2533
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:42,030
Hey, wait a minute.

2534
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:42,990
Under the sofa, eh?

2535
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:43,450
Yes.

2536
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:44,170
Yes.

2537
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:46,750
That might be a spot where the Hitman wouldn't look.

2538
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:51,490
Come to think of it, Miss Camilla climbs under the sofa all the time.

2539
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:52,630
Why?

2540
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:57,090
Trying to catch me.

2541
01:47:57,310 --> 01:47:57,930
Oh, I'm scared.

2542
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,930
You're a naughty little doggy, aren't you?

2543
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:02,350
You naughty little doggy.

2544
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,630
Which makes him a bad Hitman.

2545
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:07,090
He's not near-sighted.

2546
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,590
He's one step ahead, okay?

2547
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:09,770
He doesn't know.

2548
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:14,710
So my new plan is to hide the little lady under the sofa.

2549
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:18,130
The only problem is, how do I lead her under there?

2550
01:48:19,330 --> 01:48:20,290
Ah, yes.

2551
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:22,990
A very good question indeed.

2552
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:26,130
We don't have much time left.

2553
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:27,090
Okay.

2554
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,190
Okay.

2555
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:36,430
And then we knock this music box down, but I don't think it's doing much.

2556
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:45,110
Oh, I think we have to act- maybe the dog is asleep, so if we play the ornament, the dog might notice the ball underneath, right?

2557
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:49,530
Shut that mud up.

2558
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,650
Shut that mud up.

2559
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:52,950
Does he notice it?

2560
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:54,390
No, he didn't.

2561
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,150
He fell back asleep.

2562
01:48:56,490 --> 01:48:57,550
Oh my god.

2563
01:48:57,930 --> 01:48:58,150
Let's go away.

2564
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:58,890
Three!

2565
01:48:59,130 --> 01:48:59,930
What do you mean three?

2566
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,230
Looks like I'm down to a few more seconds!

2567
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:03,670
Ms. Camilla!

2568
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:05,350
We have to do something!

2569
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,210
We just have to!

2570
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:11,650
Now now, getting worked up isn't going to help.

2571
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:12,910
We're down to the wire here.

2572
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:15,570
Do we have enough time to do something to change her fate?

2573
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:18,050
Or is it time to use another one of my ghost tricks?

2574
01:49:18,690 --> 01:49:19,630
Another ghost trick?

2575
01:49:19,870 --> 01:49:20,590
What is it?

2576
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:24,390
We could rewind time and start all over again from four minutes ago.

2577
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:26,570
Whatever we do, we'd better hurry.

2578
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:26,630
Hurry!

2579
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:29,290
Oh jeez.

2580
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,040
Um, how can I possess the ball?

2581
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:45,320
I don't think there's anything else I can do.

2582
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,820
Like I can move the cart.

2583
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,640
Would that do anything?

2584
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,060
Okay, worth a shot, right?

2585
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,680
Move the cart.

2586
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:02,850
Oh my god, two!

2587
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:07,010
It didn't change anything!

2588
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:08,490
Um...

2589
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:10,870
It's fantover.

2590
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:12,690
It's mintover.

2591
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:14,870
Oh...

2592
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:16,850
Make the donut fall.

2593
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:17,810
We can't.

2594
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:20,190
There's only one.

2595
01:50:21,330 --> 01:50:22,630
Wait, okay, I have a question.

2596
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:26,570
So if she dies, I can still, like, I can still rewind.

2597
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:29,030
I just, um...

2598
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:33,730
I can rewind at any time, but even if she dies, I can rewind still, right?

2599
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:38,510
Yeah, you can still restart.

2600
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:38,930
Okay, okay.

2601
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:42,030
The game deletes your save.

2602
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:45,670
Okay.

2603
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:51,590
Rocket!

2604
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:53,410
Rocket!

2605
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,390
Oh my god.

2606
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:59,650
I don't think there's anything I can do.

2607
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:01,670
I'm gonna open the door!

2608
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:03,970
Make that rat go flying!

2609
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,710
I think we're donezo.

2610
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:08,950
We're so donezo.

2611
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:12,150
Uh...

2612
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,630
Oh my god, why don't you lock your door?

2613
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:17,370
Bite him!

2614
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:19,370
Oh my god.

2615
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:21,790
Listen up, little girl.

2616
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,010
I'll make you a deal.

2617
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:25,650
If you promise to keep quiet, I'll let you live.

2618
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,070
For now, anyway.

2619
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:32,280
What a shame.

2620
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:35,700
But I guess this brave little fellow refuses to accept...

2621
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:36,340
He's a dog!

2622
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,140
Missile!

2623
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:39,460
No!

2624
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:43,920
Okay.

2625
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,640
Ooh!

2626
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:47,380
Time's up.

2627
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:50,120
Doesn't seem like I can stop the intruder from coming in.

2628
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,440
Guess this little doggy doesn't have much fighting power.

2629
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:55,640
People often tell me my name doesn't suit me.

2630
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,000
Guess the only thing to do is hide our little lady someplace where the hitman can't see her.

2631
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:01,220
Yeah.

2632
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,080
Okay, let's rewind time!

2633
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:06,940
After fate change...

2634
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:09,020
Wait.

2635
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:10,880
Fate change?

2636
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:11,140
What?

2637
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:11,600
Yeah, yeah.

2638
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:12,740
We'll start from the fate change.

2639
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,620
Because that didn't have anything to do with the donuts.

2640
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:17,840
Then we don't have to do the...

2641
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,080
We don't have to wait for the...

2642
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:21,320
For the headphones again.

2643
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:24,280
Okay.

2644
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:28,120
We probably shouldn't let that guy go flying.

2645
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,120
We probably...

2646
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,040
Shouldn't let that little guy go flying.

2647
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:34,860
But...

2648
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:37,160
I think we should move the cart over here.

2649
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:40,820
And...

2650
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,660
I also...

2651
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:47,200
Don't want to exactly wait...

2652
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:50,000
Or I want to have the ball under there as well, I think.

2653
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:53,340
I think it would help to have the ball under there too.

2654
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,640
Oh, wait.

2655
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,220
There we go.

2656
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:58,860
Okay.

2657
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,860
I still am curious about this music box though.

2658
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,400
Rotate faster.

2659
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,140
Tremble.

2660
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:08,500
Tremble.

2661
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:11,240
Hit.

2662
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,360
Let's open that.

2663
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:16,600
Oh my God.

2664
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,200
Thank you for the...

2665
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:19,140
50 gifted wandering tacos.

2666
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:19,740
Thank you.

2667
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:21,840
Oh wait.

2668
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:22,220
Oh, no.

2669
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:22,560
I was right.

2670
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:24,740
Okay.

2671
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:27,520
Never mind.

2672
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:29,260
Oh my gosh.

2673
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:29,600
Please.

2674
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,220
Okay.

2675
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:32,660
There we go.

2676
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:35,560
Okay.

2677
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:41,500
I don't think there's anything we can do with the painting that I know of.

2678
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:43,240
I also can't reach it.

2679
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:46,040
Oh wait!

2680
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:46,860
Oh shoot.

2681
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,220
I just realized we...

2682
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:53,620
We have to do the star first.

2683
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,420
Sometimes the going back and forth makes me like a little...

2684
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:07,920
Or like the going ghost mode and not ghost mode makes me a little...

2685
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,020
Woo!

2686
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:09,480
Okay.

2687
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,700
Now the star.

2688
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,300
Yeah, a little motion sick.

2689
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:21,240
There we go.

2690
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,540
And when it starts going fast, it can hurt the eyes.

2691
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:27,360
Yeah, just a little.

2692
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:28,380
What does it say here?

2693
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:31,120
If you bark like that, how can anybody enjoy the pretty melody?

2694
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:35,000
And your poor mistress has to get up and quiet you down every time.

2695
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:36,780
Yes, I am... Oh.

2696
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,180
Look at that.

2697
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:39,560
One of the ornaments fell off.

2698
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:39,800
The tree.

2699
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,480
Not interested in things like that.

2700
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:43,860
I graduated from playing with balls a long time ago.

2701
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:48,200
You should try graduating from meatless barking too.

2702
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:51,060
Sorry.

2703
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,640
That's one thing I could never give up.

2704
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:56,820
Okay.

2705
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:57,800
Here.

2706
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:03,400
Here.

2707
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:03,940
Here.

2708
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,820
I don't think it hurts to have this done, you know?

2709
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:09,820
To have it there.

2710
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:11,000
I think.

2711
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,760
I don't think it hurts to have it.

2712
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:15,540
Under the couch.

2713
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:17,120
That's what I mean.

2714
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:20,400
Okay, now rock?

2715
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,200
Wait, it goes that way?

2716
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:28,410
Oh my gosh, it's a little pink mouse!

2717
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:31,490
Uh...

2718
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:31,710
Oh!

2719
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:32,110
Oh!

2720
01:55:32,130 --> 01:55:32,870
And then I...

2721
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:34,610
Okay, hold on.

2722
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:38,380
Do I fling her?

2723
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:39,300
Do I fling...

2724
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,480
Wait, which way does it open?

2725
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:46,170
I think I fling the mouse this way, right?

2726
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:56,430
Dr. Okay.

2727
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:58,270
Okay.

2728
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:00,690
The heat cool.

2729
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:03,770
Aww.

2730
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:05,990
What are you doing under here, you silly boy?

2731
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:08,670
First don't know, currently going through exams.

2732
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:10,650
And love watching along while studying.

2733
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:11,850
Thanks for the fun streams.

2734
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:13,890
Thanks rainy girl, good luck with yours.

2735
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:14,810
Oh, exams.

2736
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:17,050
Almost said your streams...

2737
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,010
Good luck with your exams!

2738
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:21,930
I'm taking another bite.

2739
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:23,810
Dr.

2740
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:36,200
Thank you.

2741
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,000
Aw, my little missile.

2742
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:38,500
You're always doing the cutest things.

2743
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:40,960
Okay.

2744
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:49,740
Nobody's here, right?

2745
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:53,280
Oh my god.

2746
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,100
This guy is deaf.

2747
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:57,780
He can't hear the dog going...

2748
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:01,020
My prey is bound to come home sometime.

2749
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:04,000
Might as well make myself comfortable in the meantime.

2750
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,220
Meanwhile, you better not eat a doughnut.

2751
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:09,480
Don't do it!

2752
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,360
There, our little lady's fate has been averted.

2753
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:15,920
Let's go!

2754
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:17,340
We got it!

2755
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:19,540
We got it, we got it.

2756
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:21,220
It has?

2757
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:24,720
The poor thing is still curled up in a ball and shaking with fear.

2758
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:27,480
Well, yeah, that's true.

2759
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:29,320
But that's not so bad.

2760
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,900
In the scheme of things, I'd say she's just fine.

2761
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:34,180
And look, you're not dead.

2762
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:35,760
Oh, you're right!

2763
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:36,840
We did it!

2764
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:38,260
We did it, didn't we?

2765
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,860
We did it!

2766
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,340
Well, to be precise, you're the one who did it.

2767
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,320
Huh?

2768
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:47,260
Me?

2769
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,600
I saved Miss Camilla?

2770
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,280
Yup.

2771
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,840
You're the one who led her under the sofa, right?

2772
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,800
You protected your mistress.

2773
01:57:58,060 --> 01:57:59,140
I can attest to that.

2774
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:00,440
Oh.

2775
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,140
Oh, thank you!

2776
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:04,480
Fate averted!

2777
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:06,600
Can I ask a question?

2778
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:08,320
Sure, what is it?

2779
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,920
What exactly are those strange powers of yours?

2780
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:16,600
Hitman, I'm going to take this donut and eat it!

2781
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,920
Stop, ancient meme!

2782
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,180
Oh, you mean my ghost tricks?

2783
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:25,700
Apparently, they're the power to manipulate inanimate objects.

2784
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:28,660
So they're ghost tricks?

2785
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,100
Oh, sorry, if they're...

2786
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:34,860
Yeah, they're ghost tricks.

2787
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,680
If they're ghost tricks, then can I do them too?

2788
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,220
I'm dead too, after all.

2789
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:42,680
I guess?

2790
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:43,740
That's how it goes.

2791
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,320
No, remember?

2792
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:46,380
The lamp said we're special.

2793
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:51,340
I've been staring at those donuts as hard as I could for a long time now.

2794
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:53,440
But they won't budge for me.

2795
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,900
Why do you suppose that is?

2796
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:57,780
I don't really know.

2797
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:00,240
I guess you just don't have that power.

2798
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:03,320
Well, I have one thing to say to that.

2799
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:04,960
That's not fair!

2800
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:09,540
Sorry, but I guess not everyone who dies gets the power of the dead.

2801
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:12,240
So what's going to happen to me now?

2802
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,020
Nothing really.

2803
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:15,740
Your death has been erased.

2804
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,940
Oh my gosh, can you imagine if I like...

2805
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:27,380
What if I got four minutes to go back and like not be dead?

2806
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:28,520
What if I wasn't a ghost?

2807
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,340
What if I wasn't a ghost maid?

2808
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:37,380
What if I was just a normal maid?

2809
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:42,000
Wouldn't that be so weird?

2810
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:43,900
Do you guys prefer me dead or...

2811
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:55,480
Would you rather me be living and happy and like thriving in life?

2812
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,860
Or would you rather me be a sad, sad afterlife ghost?

2813
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,400
The dead thing kind of suits me.

2814
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:16,800
One ghost, please.

2815
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:22,020
Just don't be sad.

2816
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:23,260
You're so right!

2817
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:24,860
I'm going to take a walk tomorrow.

2818
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,900
You'll just go back to being a happy little doggy.

2819
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,120
Living your everyday life.

2820
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:31,380
See?

2821
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:34,360
He's going to go back to being a happy, alive dog.

2822
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,900
Not a sad, dead dog.

2823
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,340
This is a trick question.

2824
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,460
A ghost trick question!

2825
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,400
I guess this means goodbye.

2826
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,420
But...

2827
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,240
We'll meet again sometime, right?

2828
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,820
Yeah, maybe.

2829
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:53,540
If you die again?

2830
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:56,580
What you did for me tonight?

2831
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,200
I'll never...

2832
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,100
I'll never forget it!

2833
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:02,560
I'll never forget it!

2834
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:09,170
I guess we'd better get...

2835
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:09,890
Get it...

2836
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:10,190
We...

2837
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:11,430
We...

2838
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:13,010
We'd better...

2839
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:15,850
We'd better get...

2840
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,990
Getting back...

2841
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:17,290
Wait...

2842
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:18,070
We'd better...

2843
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:24,770
I guess we'd better be getting back to the present.

2844
02:01:28,650 --> 02:01:31,370
Time to see what happens next in our story.

2845
02:01:33,630 --> 02:01:34,270
I'm okay.

2846
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:38,690
I hope the dog doesn't bark.

2847
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:39,990
Gosh.

2848
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:43,750
Okay, and now a new present is born.

2849
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:48,170
The little lady is still curled up in a ball and shaking with fear.

2850
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:50,850
And the little doggy is wagging his tail happily.

2851
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:52,730
So what am I going to do now?

2852
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:56,290
I think I'll watch for a while and see what happens.

2853
02:01:56,370 --> 02:01:57,890
I hope I didn't mess up with the ball though.

2854
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:01,590
But we have the music box.

2855
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:02,790
I have a question.

2856
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:06,350
Does this game only have one way to complete a...

2857
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:08,090
A thing?

2858
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:09,050
A puzzle?

2859
02:02:10,810 --> 02:02:12,830
This is like asking your girlfriend...

2860
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:13,090
Wait.

2861
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:14,970
This is like your girlfriend asking you, do I look fat?

2862
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:16,670
Still at the junkyard.

2863
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:17,370
All right.

2864
02:02:17,370 --> 02:02:17,870
Got it.

2865
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:19,470
I'm on my way.

2866
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:21,910
Oh, yes.

2867
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:22,470
Hmm.

2868
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:24,930
I guess my prey likes to play hide and seek.

2869
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:27,870
She hasn't had enough of that junkyard yet.

2870
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:27,990
Apparently.

2871
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:31,490
I can't let near sighted Jigo beat me out of this one.

2872
02:02:31,690 --> 02:02:32,790
I'd better hurry.

2873
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:34,750
Oh, is he leaving?

2874
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:38,250
He's just leaving?

2875
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:39,950
Okay.

2876
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:41,390
Nice.

2877
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:44,650
Lock the door.

2878
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:46,910
Please lock the door.

2879
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:50,850
What was that all about?

2880
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:54,010
Opens the door with the rifle.

2881
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:54,410
I know.

2882
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:55,010
He's so cool.

2883
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:57,070
You saved me, didn't you, Missile?

2884
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:58,430
I just know you did.

2885
02:02:58,610 --> 02:02:59,950
Oh my gosh.

2886
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:03,210
Maybe I shouldn't answer it.

2887
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:06,090
Answers it anyway.

2888
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:06,850
Okay.

2889
02:03:08,730 --> 02:03:09,550
Moshi moshi.

2890
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:10,770
Lin!

2891
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:13,350
Trick time.

2892
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:14,810
Oh?

2893
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:16,810
What am I trick timing to?

2894
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:18,430
A call from Lin, eh?

2895
02:03:18,570 --> 02:03:19,350
Sounds serious.

2896
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:19,930
I wonder...

2897
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:20,190
Oh, yeah.

2898
02:03:20,430 --> 02:03:22,290
Better go possess that phone and listen in.

2899
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,650
Oh, no.

2900
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:24,850
Wait.

2901
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:25,250
Oh.

2902
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:26,790
I didn't realize I was on the...

2903
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:27,050
Oh, no.

2904
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:27,890
Another call.

2905
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:29,370
There we go.

2906
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:30,910
And...

2907
02:03:30,910 --> 02:03:32,570
Round we go.

2908
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:34,890
And over we...

2909
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:36,370
Oh.

2910
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:40,230
There's the little doggy all curled up on the floor.

2911
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:43,410
Dreaming away the life we worked so hard to get back for.

2912
02:03:46,270 --> 02:03:47,050
That's fine.

2913
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:49,210
But what's up with that core?

2914
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:51,990
The phone works again.

2915
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:52,650
Mysterious.

2916
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:55,470
Yeah, it said like we couldn't use the phone in the four minutes.

2917
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:02,810
Say his name!

2918
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:04,590
It's Ray!

2919
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:13,570
I'm obsessed with possessing.

2920
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:16,050
It's you!

2921
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:16,710
It's you!

2922
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:20,590
Come to think of it, I never did ask your name.

2923
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:23,390
I guess it's good we ran into each other again then.

2924
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:24,650
This music is so happy.

2925
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:29,110
This is a good chance for us to reintroduce ourselves to each other.

2926
02:04:29,650 --> 02:04:31,230
You mean you forgot my name already?

2927
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:33,270
After everything we shared together?

2928
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:33,870
The drama?

2929
02:04:34,030 --> 02:04:35,070
That tearful goodbye?

2930
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:36,970
I'm Misa!

2931
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,650
And I'm Minto!

2932
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:41,430
But you know, it's strange.

2933
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:44,470
I wonder why you remember me now that you're alive again.

2934
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:47,530
Do you remember your time being dead?

2935
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:48,910
Of course!

2936
02:04:49,330 --> 02:04:50,190
All of it!

2937
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:52,390
Okay, let me get this straight.

2938
02:04:52,690 --> 02:04:54,890
The memory of being dead doesn't disappear.

2939
02:04:55,090 --> 02:04:59,550
And the dead I meet in the ghost world develop a core when they return to the land of the living.

2940
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:05,330
Then if I possess that core, I can talk to that person.

2941
02:05:06,350 --> 02:05:09,090
I have to remember that I died?

2942
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:12,490
Okay...

2943
02:05:13,190 --> 02:05:14,790
It's a little traumatic, isn't it?

2944
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:16,910
Poor Miso.

2945
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:19,450
There's not a thought behind that eyes.

2946
02:05:19,450 --> 02:05:23,130
But every day he just sees himself staring down the barrel.

2947
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:25,850
Pointed directly at his face.

2948
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:28,830
He's just like, haha, I'm traumatized.

2949
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:31,610
It looks that way, yes.

2950
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:34,010
Cool.

2951
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:49,330
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

2952
02:05:51,070 --> 02:05:53,010
Well, I don't know if I'm okay exactly.

2953
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:54,750
You won't believe what just happened.

2954
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:55,830
Listen to me.

2955
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:57,430
You've got to get out of there right now.

2956
02:05:57,970 --> 02:05:58,970
What about dinner?

2957
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:00,690
I was thinking about spaghetti tonight.

2958
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:01,830
Yeah, spaghetti!

2959
02:06:04,150 --> 02:06:05,410
I've been murdered before.

2960
02:06:05,650 --> 02:06:06,130
Really?

2961
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:08,570
Me too.

2962
02:06:09,410 --> 02:06:10,510
Nah, I'm just kidding.

2963
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:18,660
Nah, I'm just kidding.

2964
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:21,400
Nah.

2965
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:25,360
Unless...

2966
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,740
Ah, I'm eating more.

2967
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:42,480
I won't be going back there for a while and you might be in danger.

2968
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:56,540
You might be in danger if you stay there too.

2969
02:06:58,300 --> 02:06:59,900
But I already was in danger.

2970
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:01,200
Just a little while ago.

2971
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:02,680
Oh, wow.

2972
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:06,260
Lin, could you like, care at all?

2973
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,600
Meet me at that restaurant on Chicken Kitchen.

2974
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:09,640
Oh, sorry.

2975
02:07:09,740 --> 02:07:10,380
The Chicken Kitchen.

2976
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:11,740
The Chicken Kitchen.

2977
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,100
On Dead End Drive.

2978
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:15,340
Dead End Drive?

2979
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:16,340
I don't know.

2980
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:17,280
That's pretty far.

2981
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:19,060
Just hurry, okay?

2982
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,380
Oh, and one more thing.

2983
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:23,740
Bring the music box with you, okay?

2984
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:25,500
Music box?

2985
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:26,420
Oh, we got it!

2986
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,040
I love music boxes!

2987
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:29,180
Is it a present for me?

2988
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,080
I'm sorry, but it doesn't play.

2989
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:32,560
I can't even get the lid open.

2990
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:36,060
Then you can't very well call it a music box.

2991
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:36,880
Then can you?

2992
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:38,420
More like just a box.

2993
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,960
Just a box.

2994
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:45,260
Just bring it, okay?

2995
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:47,380
It's kind of big and it's made out of wood.

2996
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:49,600
Okay, I will.

2997
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:50,400
Where is it?

2998
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:52,520
I kind of hid it in that room here.

2999
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:53,820
Oh, well, we already got it.

3000
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:54,700
We sped run it.

3001
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,280
Who the hell are you?

3002
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:57,880
Oh my god.

3003
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:00,840
Excuse me.

3004
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:01,620
Eek!

3005
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:02,480
Lynn!

3006
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:03,440
Oh no!

3007
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:05,840
Oh my god.

3008
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:06,440
Cliffhanger.

3009
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:08,460
Cliffhanger!

3010
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:10,880
Not again.

3011
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:13,640
Darn.

3012
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:15,460
Now I've dropped the phone in there too.

3013
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:19,120
What did it...

3014
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:20,180
Wouldn't it be corded?

3015
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:21,380
Like, you know, those kinds of...

3016
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:22,340
It looks really old.

3017
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:25,880
Poor fish.

3018
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:26,280
Right?

3019
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:28,580
The fish just got electrocuted.

3020
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,940
How about if we tell her you did it, Missile?

3021
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:33,760
Woof!

3022
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:34,060
Woof!

3023
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,480
I sure hope Lynn's alright.

3024
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:38,880
I'd better get going.

3025
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,440
I know right where Dead End Drive is.

3026
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,120
But I never saw any music box around here.

3027
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:45,640
Where am I supposed to find it?

3028
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:47,860
Do you know where it is, Missile?

3029
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,300
Oh my gosh.

3030
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:50,560
Dora the Explorer time.

3031
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:54,600
Do you know where the music box is?

3032
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:56,900
Say...

3033
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,060
Here.

3034
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:01,080
If you know where the music box is.

3035
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:04,140
Where's the music box?

3036
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,140
Over there.

3037
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:20,620
Where is the music box?

3038
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,640
Under the couch?

3039
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:27,460
Are you stupid?

3040
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:31,180
That's a ball.

3041
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,500
Don't you know your basic shapes?

3042
02:09:38,450 --> 02:09:39,470
On the tree?

3043
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:42,550
Good job.

3044
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:46,870
Time to tr...

3045
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:47,290
Oh my gosh.

3046
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:47,630
Look at her.

3047
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:48,030
She's searching.

3048
02:09:48,150 --> 02:09:48,590
It's so cute.

3049
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:53,570
Oh no.

3050
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:54,110
She missed it.

3051
02:09:57,130 --> 02:09:57,570
Wait.

3052
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,370
How am I supposed to...

3053
02:09:58,370 --> 02:09:58,510
Oh.

3054
02:09:58,550 --> 02:10:00,590
Maybe I let this go off and she'll see it.

3055
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:00,750
Oh.

3056
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:08,370
She saw it.

3057
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:11,550
Dora for 30-year-olds.

3058
02:10:14,610 --> 02:10:15,330
This is it.

3059
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:15,990
The music box.

3060
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:16,770
She's

3061
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:21,960
about to say yippee.

3062
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:22,820
I think...

3063
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:23,240
Is she me?

3064
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:25,120
I'll leave the remote here.

3065
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:25,680
We're good.

3066
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,860
But don't you touch it, Missile.

3067
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,840
If the TV comes on, you'll start barking.

3068
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:34,440
I'd hate to find you flattened underneath that wall when I came home.

3069
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:34,600
Dora for 30-year-olds.

3070
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:37,440
She looks so genuinely sad about that.

3071
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,880
All the stuff that's just in the fish tank.

3072
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:42,900
Stay here and be a good boy.

3073
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:44,540
I'm leaving now, Missile.

3074
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,600
I have to go help Lin.

3075
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:48,000
She's like a sister to me, you know?

3076
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:49,700
You be good, my boy.

3077
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:51,000
And no barking.

3078
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:53,080
Woof.

3079
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:53,440
Woof.

3080
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:53,880
Woof.

3081
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:54,240
Woof.

3082
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:54,360
Woof.

3083
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:55,260
Woof.

3084
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:58,620
Woof.

3085
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:02,700
Woof.

3086
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:04,580
Woof.

3087
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:11,300
Still no peace for the little lady, and the redhead Lin is facing a new crisis right now as well.

3088
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:18,240
Can your next stream be a key jingling stream?

3089
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:27,120
Meanwhile, I'm a bit in a pickle of my own.

3090
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:31,920
With the receiver at the bottom of the fish tank, I find myself still trapped in this apartment.

3091
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:36,140
Too bad I can't just curl up and go to sleep with my team.

3092
02:11:36,140 --> 02:11:36,820
Tail wagging too.

3093
02:11:36,940 --> 02:11:38,500
Because there is something I must do.

3094
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:41,500
The question is, how do I go about getting out of here?

3095
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:49,810
Do you guys need me to jingle keys for you to pay attention?

3096
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:50,810
Yay!

3097
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:52,810
7.31 to 8.04!

3098
02:11:54,510 --> 02:11:55,330
New song.

3099
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:56,490
Welcome to the salon.

3100
02:11:58,710 --> 02:11:59,230
Nice.

3101
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:01,350
Yes, please.

3102
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:03,470
Tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki.

3103
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:05,250
Tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki.

3104
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:05,770
Hahaha.

3105
02:12:06,910 --> 02:12:07,770
The passion.

3106
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:09,650
She saw it as probably the most key jingling...

3107
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:12,050
jingle core stream you've done so far.

3108
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:15,110
It was like my second stream.

3109
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:18,990
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

3110
02:12:19,230 --> 02:12:19,470
Oh.

3111
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:20,890
Tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki.

3112
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:23,230
What was I saying?

3113
02:12:23,730 --> 02:12:26,070
Oh no, maybe I need the keys more than you got.

3114
02:12:26,110 --> 02:12:26,730
I need them too!

3115
02:12:27,130 --> 02:12:31,790
Oh no, we're stuck in a loop of people who don't pay attention and don't know what's going on.

3116
02:12:35,530 --> 02:12:37,430
Once again, Lin is in danger.

3117
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:39,530
And I think she knows it too.

3118
02:12:39,670 --> 02:12:42,430
I sincerely doubt she'll be coming back to this apartment tonight.

3119
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:47,190
She and I are connected to each other somehow.

3120
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:49,450
She's my only lead and I can't lose her.

3121
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:50,570
I have to get to her.

3122
02:12:50,850 --> 02:12:51,570
And fast.

3123
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:57,490
You jingle the keys for us, we jingle the keys for you.

3124
02:12:57,890 --> 02:12:58,330
Nice!

3125
02:12:59,270 --> 02:13:00,150
I'm paying attention.

3126
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:01,230
I see all the keys in chat.

3127
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:02,410
Okay, I'm paying attention.

3128
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:06,250
Maybe I get the remote.

3129
02:13:06,970 --> 02:13:07,410
I'm paying attention.

3130
02:13:08,470 --> 02:13:09,430
Hey doggie.

3131
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:20,110
If she does knock the wall down, then we'll be able to use her phone.

3132
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:21,670
See?

3133
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:25,070
Oh my god, wait, she's actually going to knock it down.

3134
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:30,490
If you keep that racket up, I'll bring this whole dilapidated building down on you.

3135
02:13:32,650 --> 02:13:34,050
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.

3136
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:37,170
Keep barking, missile!

3137
02:13:39,770 --> 02:13:41,430
Did you hear what I just heard?

3138
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:43,930
You mean the lady next door is angry.

3139
02:13:44,070 --> 02:13:44,310
Howl!

3140
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:47,730
No, forget that.

3141
02:13:49,250 --> 02:13:49,770
Tomoe!

3142
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:50,750
Welcome to membership.

3143
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:51,230
Thank you.

3144
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:53,150
That was the sound of a telephone ringing.

3145
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,890
Coming from the apartment next door.

3146
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:56,790
Oh, I get it.

3147
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:59,490
You're thinking about borrowing her telephone, aren't you?

3148
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:03,710
Saying it with that voice is a little funny.

3149
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:09,210
But how are you going to do that without breaking the wall down?

3150
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:13,810
Well, the lady next door is kindly offering to do it for us.

3151
02:14:15,190 --> 02:14:18,850
Yes, but she's mostly hoping to crush me underneath it.

3152
02:14:21,170 --> 02:14:23,290
Just keep doing it.

3153
02:14:26,710 --> 02:14:28,830
Oh no, I didn't mean to make it go faster.

3154
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:32,990
Slow down a little.

3155
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:33,230
Slow.

3156
02:14:33,470 --> 02:14:34,250
Just calm down.

3157
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:35,350
Wyvern.

3158
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:36,330
Dragon.

3159
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:37,750
Wyvern droog.

3160
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:39,530
Welcome to membership.

3161
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:40,730
Thank you.

3162
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:42,390
Oh, we're so close.

3163
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:43,330
Can I rock?

3164
02:14:44,690 --> 02:14:45,930
Oh, it doesn't rock enough.

3165
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:51,850
I was thinking like it'll rock side to side and I could like rock it over here.

3166
02:14:53,410 --> 02:14:56,930
There's also up here, but I don't think there's anything I can get in there.

3167
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:57,990
Hmm.

3168
02:14:59,090 --> 02:14:59,830
I'd rather not.

3169
02:14:59,870 --> 02:15:00,590
Thanks for the vibe, Gifte.

3170
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:01,450
Thank you.

3171
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:11,070
Talk to him?

3172
02:15:11,690 --> 02:15:12,410
Come on now.

3173
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:13,810
Can't you bark any louder than that?

3174
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:15,010
Louder!

3175
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:18,370
But then that lady will knock the wall down on top of me.

3176
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:20,590
We'll worry about that when it happens.

3177
02:15:22,670 --> 02:15:23,030
Anyway...

3178
02:15:25,330 --> 02:15:27,750
I don't... like... who's gonna pay for that?

3179
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:32,110
Ghost Trick is one of my faves.

3180
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:33,450
Hope you enjoy it and play it all the way through.

3181
02:15:33,450 --> 02:15:33,970
I will!

3182
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:35,250
Thanks, Sneakson!

3183
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:40,390
We need to have this little doggy put some more energy into it.

3184
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:40,850
Let's see.

3185
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:43,850
Wasn't there something else around here that gets a reaction out of him?

3186
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:45,670
Uh... the star?

3187
02:15:49,150 --> 02:15:52,390
So we do the star and the... the show?

3188
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:54,770
Oh!

3189
02:15:54,850 --> 02:15:55,490
There it goes.

3190
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:01,210
Oh my god!

3191
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:03,150
I'll pound this... oh my god!

3192
02:16:03,490 --> 02:16:04,310
Holy cow!

3193
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:07,850
Woah!

3194
02:16:12,370 --> 02:16:14,270
Did she just knock the dog unconscious?

3195
02:16:18,620 --> 02:16:20,000
I told you, didn't I?

3196
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:22,560
I told you I would knock the wall down on you.

3197
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:27,220
He's okay, right?

3198
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:29,840
He's okay, right?

3199
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,420
Dog?

3200
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:32,560
Oh.

3201
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:36,620
So this is what it feels like to have a wall knocked down on you, huh?

3202
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,200
It's more like she knocked you out through the wall, really.

3203
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,720
Oh my gosh, Tomo-boy!

3204
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:45,800
Thank you for the 50-gifted thank you!

3205
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:48,360
I'm still alive, aren't I?

3206
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:51,320
Yes?

3207
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:52,060
You are.

3208
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:54,980
But the TV and the star ornament aren't.

3209
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,200
I'll never bark again!

3210
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:59,960
Not as long as I live!

3211
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,280
But wait a minute...

3212
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:04,300
It looks like... Here, one second.

3213
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:06,340
I'm gonna actually make this a bit smaller.

3214
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,140
Just so it's not so in the way.

3215
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:09,000
Sorry, guys.

3216
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:11,640
I'm still trying to figure out how to...

3217
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,520
When there's so many gifted memberships...

3218
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:14,420
Oh my gosh, Tomo-boy!

3219
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:15,420
Thank you for another 50!

3220
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:18,460
When there's so many memberships, it kind of like...

3221
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:22,180
It kind of like keeps them popping up for so long, so...

3222
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:24,280
The notifications... I'm so sorry.

3223
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:26,960
But thank you so much!

3224
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:27,500
Thank you!

3225
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:30,160
Thank you so much.

3226
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,040
It looks like all that commotion wasn't for naught.

3227
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:34,820
Huh?

3228
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:42,760
Ooh, your barking made her create a path for me!

3229
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:44,140
It did?

3230
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:46,580
But the wall is still standing just like before!

3231
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,680
But there are paths only the dead can see.

3232
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:51,700
Oh, those kinds of paths!

3233
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:55,180
Trick time!

3234
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:01,260
There we go.

3235
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:02,380
Nice.

3236
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:04,260
Easy peasy.

3237
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:05,640
Bye, missile!

3238
02:18:07,020 --> 02:18:08,500
So you're leaving, huh?

3239
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:11,560
I guess so.

3240
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:15,760
You're going to go save Miss Camilla and Miss Lin?

3241
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:20,140
I have to follow my own mystery first and foremost.

3242
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:21,920
That means everything to me.

3243
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:25,360
But you will save them, right?

3244
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:28,680
If it helps me along the way, then yes.

3245
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:31,260
I don't have any powers of the dead.

3246
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:33,800
I'm not even dead, actually.

3247
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:37,800
But I'm going to find a way to go help Miss Camilla, too.

3248
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:40,220
We create our own paths.

3249
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,100
Right, missile?

3250
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:42,680
That's right!

3251
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:45,740
Okay, I'm leaving now.

3252
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,480
Guess this is our second goodbye.

3253
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:49,680
It is, isn't it?

3254
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:51,500
My name is Sissel.

3255
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:54,500
If we ever meet again, that's what you can call me.

3256
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,180
Sissel, huh?

3257
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:57,180
Got it.

3258
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:58,580
You know what, Sissel?

3259
02:18:58,580 --> 02:19:00,800
I'm going to create my own path.

3260
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,320
Just like you said.

3261
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,500
She goes to sleep.

3262
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:08,960
Missile?

3263
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:11,720
Missile!

3264
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:13,600
Missile!

3265
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:14,280
Missile, please!

3266
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:21,760
Can dogs get concussions?

3267
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:26,240
Tonight is the holiest of all nights.

3268
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:27,340
My deadline.

3269
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:30,700
All I need is to get some inspiration.

3270
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:34,360
From the Muses is this bottle and some cheese.

3271
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:37,920
Here it's to the boorish people next door.

3272
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:42,940
Nice, we're inside this lady's house.

3273
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:44,240
Oh my god, there's a mouse!

3274
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:46,340
Who's sneezing?

3275
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:49,100
Her hair is like a tulip.

3276
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,400
This is sexy music.

3277
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,040
Are you alright, my darling angel?

3278
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:58,380
Have you taken your medicine like a good girl?

3279
02:19:58,860 --> 02:19:59,500
Oh!

3280
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:04,540
Oh, she's got that gamer posture.

3281
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:05,500
She's perfect.

3282
02:20:07,980 --> 02:20:10,260
Here I am in yet another strange room.

3283
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:12,160
With...

3284
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:15,000
What's with the oddly tense air of this place anyway?

3285
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:18,680
Now where is that little treasure I'm looking for?

3286
02:20:21,480 --> 02:20:22,400
Who's in the bed?

3287
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:24,980
There it is.

3288
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:25,760
The telephone.

3289
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,960
Now if I can just borrow it...

3290
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:30,600
Who's in the bed though?

3291
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:33,220
I'm so curious.

3292
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:38,140
Let's see, we got this...

3293
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:39,860
Oh, I can't reach that, can I?

3294
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:40,260
Oh, I can!

3295
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:42,380
I'm just gonna...

3296
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,360
We're just gonna let that go through.

3297
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,480
And we're just gonna poke you a little bit.

3298
02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:52,860
And we're just gonna scooch you a little bit.

3299
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:56,700
I don't know why I'm doing all of this.

3300
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,280
Oh my god, look at her go!

3301
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,920
Wait, what is she saying?

3302
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,500
Oh, Mr. Prime Minister.

3303
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:12,420
You mustn't.

3304
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:14,120
I'm a married woman.

3305
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,620
And I'm a married man.

3306
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:19,280
But we cannot resist this any longer.

3307
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:25,900
I'm ready to abdicate it all for you.

3308
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:27,520
She's writing fanfiction!

3309
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:30,640
Even if it means my ultimate ruination.

3310
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:31,740
Ruination...

3311
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:34,000
Hmm...

3312
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:35,500
Ruination...

3313
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:36,840
Is that even a word?

3314
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:40,780
And that abdicate just doesn't look right somehow.

3315
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:44,780
This is going to nag me all night, I'm sure.

3316
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,780
Oh my god, philosophy!

3317
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:49,260
Thanks for the vibe, gifted.

3318
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,080
Um...

3319
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:51,560
Boom...

3320
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:52,280
Boom...

3321
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,580
Examine?

3322
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:55,980
Where is that dictionary?

3323
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,980
This thing is too heavy.

3324
02:21:58,040 --> 02:21:58,980
I can't manipulate it.

3325
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:02,940
Maybe that woman built up her destructive power by hefting this puppy.

3326
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,780
It's more like a weapon than a book.

3327
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,220
Let's see.

3328
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:10,840
I know I put it here somewhere.

3329
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:13,140
Now where could it have gone to?

3330
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:15,400
Um...

3331
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:15,860
Trick!

3332
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,100
I still...

3333
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,600
It's too heavy.

3334
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,460
Uh...

3335
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,160
I just can't find it.

3336
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:25,420
Wait, the mouse is back!

3337
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:26,840
Um...

3338
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:28,080
How do I time this?

3339
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:29,460
Hmm...

3340
02:22:32,890 --> 02:22:33,410
Oh...

3341
02:22:33,410 --> 02:22:34,890
No, I mustn't.

3342
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:39,430
I mustn't allow myself to believe in your love, Mr. Prime Minister.

3343
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:42,270
But why...

3344
02:22:42,270 --> 02:22:43,070
Wait, is that...

3345
02:22:43,070 --> 02:22:44,290
Is this him speaking?

3346
02:22:44,510 --> 02:22:46,550
But why won't you believe in me?

3347
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:48,550
My love for you is true.

3348
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:49,910
I swear.

3349
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:52,050
And it's so strong.

3350
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:53,970
It overwhelms me!

3351
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:57,670
You know, I've always wondered...

3352
02:22:58,490 --> 02:23:00,670
If you can be overwhelmed by something...

3353
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:02,390
Can you be just plain...

3354
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:03,190
Whelmed?

3355
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:05,290
This is going to...

3356
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:07,030
Okay, hold on.

3357
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:07,750
Uh...

3358
02:23:08,290 --> 02:23:10,350
Okay, we gotta get the mouse down there, alright?

3359
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:11,490
Oh, wait!

3360
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:12,290
I can't reach it!

3361
02:23:12,470 --> 02:23:12,990
Oh, no!

3362
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:13,770
Wait...

3363
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:14,670
Oh, here, from here.

3364
02:23:15,730 --> 02:23:16,130
Boink!

3365
02:23:17,710 --> 02:23:19,650
Is she gonna notice the mouse here?

3366
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:21,870
Oh!

3367
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:25,370
Oh my god!

3368
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:31,410
Oh, I missed it!

3369
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:31,970
Okay, wait.

3370
02:23:32,050 --> 02:23:33,050
I have to get him down there.

3371
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:33,610
I get it now.

3372
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:34,010
I get it.

3373
02:23:34,890 --> 02:23:35,750
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3374
02:23:35,810 --> 02:23:36,230
I get it now.

3375
02:23:36,290 --> 02:23:36,610
I get it.

3376
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:38,570
Let's wait here.

3377
02:23:39,570 --> 02:23:41,030
Because he lands by the book.

3378
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:42,770
Mint.

3379
02:23:42,970 --> 02:23:43,650
I'm sorry!

3380
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:44,570
I'm sorry.

3381
02:23:45,550 --> 02:23:45,890
Okay.

3382
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:48,150
But I kind of also want to hear this.

3383
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:50,290
No!

3384
02:23:50,570 --> 02:23:51,590
Mr. Prime Minister!

3385
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:53,070
We mustn't!

3386
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:55,370
If the people ever found out...

3387
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:58,210
I don't care what they might think.

3388
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:02,690
What do the plebeian masses understand anyway?

3389
02:24:03,230 --> 02:24:04,810
Certainly not our love.

3390
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:06,930
Hmm...

3391
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:09,430
What is the Prime Minister talking about?

3392
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:10,890
I don't know!

3393
02:24:10,910 --> 02:24:11,510
It's your book!

3394
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:15,950
I've never even heard the word plebeian before.

3395
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:19,210
What is it?

3396
02:24:19,210 --> 02:24:20,510
AI writing it for you?

3397
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:25,590
And you're just like taking it?

3398
02:24:25,810 --> 02:24:26,490
I wonder...

3399
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:27,610
She doesn't even know!

3400
02:24:28,750 --> 02:24:29,230
Okay.

3401
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:32,370
Oh, wait.

3402
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:32,810
Tilt.

3403
02:24:33,710 --> 02:24:34,190
Beep.

3404
02:24:36,310 --> 02:24:37,270
Oh, boop.

3405
02:24:38,110 --> 02:24:38,590
Spin.

3406
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:40,010
Pew!

3407
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:43,790
And now she'll find it.

3408
02:24:44,030 --> 02:24:44,390
No!

3409
02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:44,670
What?

3410
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:50,360
She didn't find it.

3411
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:58,880
I like watching her typos.

3412
02:24:58,980 --> 02:24:59,520
Like, really.

3413
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:00,580
Oh, no.

3414
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:01,160
We've read it.

3415
02:25:01,220 --> 02:25:01,420
Okay.

3416
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:03,640
Did I do it too soon?

3417
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:04,100
Oh, that's fine.

3418
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:05,640
I have to go through it again, though.

3419
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:07,060
Okay.

3420
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:07,900
Alright.

3421
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:11,340
Pew!

3422
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:13,140
Maybe she...

3423
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:13,740
Okay, wait a second.

3424
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:16,460
Maybe she has to see the rat and then I knock it onto the floor.

3425
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:17,260
Right?

3426
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,320
Maybe she sees the rat first.

3427
02:25:28,490 --> 02:25:29,310
There we go.

3428
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:33,150
Oh, there it is.

3429
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:35,290
Let's not care about the rat anymore.

3430
02:25:36,930 --> 02:25:37,730
Yippee!

3431
02:25:39,850 --> 02:25:41,730
But it's strange...

3432
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:44,210
I know I left this dictionary on the shelf.

3433
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:48,970
It's as if some little angel were playing naughty tricks on me.

3434
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:50,810
I cannot get her accent.

3435
02:25:52,590 --> 02:25:53,630
She's like...

3436
02:25:53,630 --> 02:25:55,990
Sometimes southern, sometimes British.

3437
02:25:58,190 --> 02:26:00,290
Perhaps my darling angel?

3438
02:26:02,510 --> 02:26:03,310
Okay.

3439
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:05,860
Possess.

3440
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:06,380
Possess.

3441
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:13,420
Brush... Mama!

3442
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,780
Turn the knob.

3443
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:27,020
Where else do I go from here?

3444
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:31,360
Oh my god, she's so cute!

3445
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,360
She's so cute!

3446
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:38,620
She looks like the other girl from ReZero.

3447
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:43,560
It is common for writers to lose their plot to the characters.

3448
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:46,140
They just steal the plot we had planned and change it.

3449
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:47,540
We are weird like that.

3450
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,900
No, Snake, we mustn't.

3451
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:53,900
If Otacon ever finds out, said Ocelot, I don't care.

3452
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:55,140
What does that Otaku...

3453
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:55,400
No!

3454
02:26:56,660 --> 02:26:57,600
Wrong, Snake!

3455
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,480
Yeah, Beatrice!

3456
02:26:58,620 --> 02:26:58,960
Beatrice!

3457
02:26:59,060 --> 02:26:59,420
Beatrice!

3458
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:03,120
What is it, my darling angel?

3459
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:04,340
Ow!

3460
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:05,960
My head hurts, Mama!

3461
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:08,080
You poor dear.

3462
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:10,480
And no wonder with a fever of 102.

3463
02:27:11,420 --> 02:27:14,040
Here's to a night of... wait, a night of fever.

3464
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:16,440
Hotter than the love of my prime minister.

3465
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:23,200
It's almost time for me to... wait, time to go out for my lesson.

3466
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:24,680
Can I take the night off?

3467
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,880
Yes, I suppose that would be best.

3468
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:29,120
But wait a minute.

3469
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:33,320
I bet you're happy to have an excuse to get out of it, aren't you?

3470
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:34,780
Not especially.

3471
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:39,880
If I ever don't want to go, I just don't go and pretend I did.

3472
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:44,980
Don't reveal your secrets, Beatrice!

3473
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:49,660
I go play with Camilla next door or something.

3474
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:53,500
Here's to the blunt honesty of my darling angel.

3475
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:58,400
Hey, today is Papa's birthday.

3476
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,020
Oh, is it?

3477
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:01,560
Don't tell her.

3478
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:02,220
Yeah, what are you doing?

3479
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:04,160
Aren't we going to celebrate together?

3480
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:08,000
Let's not talk about your father, dear.

3481
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:08,420
Dang.

3482
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:10,480
What's this family drama?

3483
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:13,140
Now Mama has to go back to work.

3484
02:28:13,340 --> 02:28:15,400
I have a deadline tonight, after all.

3485
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:16,760
Okay.

3486
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:18,040
Mama, wait!

3487
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:20,800
Hold it.

3488
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,160
I just have one thing to say.

3489
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:28,360
Don't try and put me in the middle of you two.

3490
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:29,100
Okay?

3491
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:33,480
Whatever could you be talking about?

3492
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:36,680
I know what's going on, you know.

3493
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:39,960
You write novels and Papa wants you to stop.

3494
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:44,200
But it was very selfish of you to take me and leave the house.

3495
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:45,780
What is going on?

3496
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:47,900
I want to go home.

3497
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:50,820
Uh...

3498
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:55,180
Uh...

3499
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:56,200
Now, now.

3500
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:58,900
It's time for good little girls to go to sleep.

3501
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:01,660
Especially sick little girls.

3502
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:05,100
Sleeps.

3503
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:06,260
I hate you, Mama!

3504
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:07,180
Dang.

3505
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,960
What is going on?

3506
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:13,620
Oh yeah, we haven't checked the... what's it called?

3507
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:14,260
Oh wait.

3508
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:15,580
This one.

3509
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:16,920
ZL.

3510
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:21,460
We haven't checked this in a while.

3511
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:23,180
She's still sitting there in the rain.

3512
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:26,280
Hunter and the dog.

3513
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,640
Eyebrowed villain.

3514
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:30,640
Masked muscle man.

3515
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:33,640
The other hitman.

3516
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:36,460
The little lady.

3517
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:38,960
I love it.

3518
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:40,580
Valiant pet.

3519
02:29:44,180 --> 02:29:44,960
Perfumed lady.

3520
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:51,040
Apparently she's a novelist who moved here due to a disagreement with her husband.

3521
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:52,600
Nice.

3522
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,040
Feverish firecracker.

3523
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:57,460
Apparently she and Camilla are friends.

3524
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:59,260
She isn't going out for her lesson tonight.

3525
02:29:59,740 --> 02:30:00,800
Aw, look at her.

3526
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:01,480
She's so sick.

3527
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,080
It's so sad.

3528
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:04,580
And then the phone book.

3529
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:06,660
Oh, it's these places.

3530
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:07,000
Okay.

3531
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,140
Cool.

3532
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:11,560
Wait, a music box was hidden in the ceiling.

3533
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:15,980
Big lady.

3534
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:19,840
These two are quite a pair.

3535
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:23,780
The father would have to be a pretty strong man to hold his own against them.

3536
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:26,720
Sounds like their family circumstances are pretty complicated.

3537
02:30:27,220 --> 02:30:28,780
I wonder if I had a family.

3538
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:30,740
When do we get to...

3539
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:32,840
Oh, my lamp is out.

3540
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:36,340
Wait.

3541
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:38,840
Ma'am, what are you about to do with that?

3542
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:40,540
Ma'am?

3543
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:44,160
Ma'am, what are you about to...

3544
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:46,900
What are you about to do with that?

3545
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:50,820
I stopped it immediately.

3546
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:55,020
I was going to look to see if there was anything else around.

3547
02:30:55,420 --> 02:30:55,660
But...

3548
02:30:57,880 --> 02:30:58,280
Wow!

3549
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:04,220
She's a keeper.

3550
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:06,300
Is this still too heavy?

3551
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,660
She brought this dictionary all the way over here to look at something.

3552
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:09,320
Look something up.

3553
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:13,000
You did not just say, irregardless.

3554
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:24,890
Is this...

3555
02:31:30,170 --> 02:31:32,830
I can't tell if this is on purpose or not.

3556
02:31:34,070 --> 02:31:35,370
Should have read the dictionary.

3557
02:31:36,190 --> 02:31:37,630
This is probably on purpose, right?

3558
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:39,210
Here it sits all alone.

3559
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:41,190
Either she forgot what she wanted to look up.

3560
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:44,610
Or she forgot she even wanted to look anything up in the first place.

3561
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,710
Hmm.

3562
02:31:45,950 --> 02:31:47,730
Is irregardless really a word?

3563
02:31:47,870 --> 02:31:48,050
Okay.

3564
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:52,490
My darling lady.

3565
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:54,210
Oh, my darling lady.

3566
02:31:54,290 --> 02:31:56,390
To think that you were a spy all along.

3567
02:31:57,610 --> 02:31:58,130
What?

3568
02:31:58,830 --> 02:32:01,510
What are you going to do to me, Mr. Prime Minister?

3569
02:32:02,110 --> 02:32:05,650
I will arrest you and make sure you receive the proper penalty.

3570
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:09,850
You're sentenced to be imprisoned in my cell of love.

3571
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:13,430
And punished with my whip of passion.

3572
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:16,350
Ooh la la.

3573
02:32:16,970 --> 02:32:19,110
Oh, Mr. Prime Minister.

3574
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:21,510
Oh, my dear lady.

3575
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:24,350
I would totally listen to an audiobook of this.

3576
02:32:25,630 --> 02:32:26,350
Hmm.

3577
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:29,250
I'd hate to live in this Prime Minister's country.

3578
02:32:36,430 --> 02:32:37,150
When...

3579
02:32:40,100 --> 02:32:42,520
It's still too far away for me to reach.

3580
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:43,700
Everything is still too far.

3581
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:45,720
I have to do something when...

3582
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,860
We turn the knob, right?

3583
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:50,520
It's right up your alley.

3584
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:51,400
It actually is.

3585
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:55,360
Um...

3586
02:32:56,860 --> 02:32:57,460
Hmm...

3587
02:32:57,460 --> 02:33:01,760
I forgot about your harlequin novel hobby.

3588
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:04,220
Is that...

3589
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:06,260
Isn't a harlequin novel like...

3590
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:06,500
Um...

3591
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:07,620
An actual brand?

3592
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,880
The only thing I can think of doing is turning off the light.

3593
02:33:32,860 --> 02:33:33,980
What is going on?

3594
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:35,600
Oh, she made a typo.

3595
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,120
Ah!

3596
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:39,720
Okay.

3597
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:40,820
Got it.

3598
02:33:42,860 --> 02:33:43,520
Got it.

3599
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:44,160
Okay.

3600
02:33:44,840 --> 02:33:46,740
We have to wait for her to make a typo.

3601
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:47,140
Clearly.

3602
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:50,260
Oh, I just want to watch this again, though.

3603
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:50,960
Whoo!

3604
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:54,460
She is one...

3605
02:33:54,460 --> 02:33:56,080
Spicy mama.

3606
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:58,980
She is one...

3607
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:00,680
Hot meatball!

3608
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:02,500
Yeah!

3609
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:07,380
Uh...

3610
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:08,820
I guess I'll turn it off again.

3611
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:09,420
Oh!

3612
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:11,620
Okay, now she makes the typo.

3613
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:14,000
There we go.

3614
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:17,120
Pew!

3615
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:18,340
Oh!

3616
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:20,040
Oh!

3617
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:23,560
Oh, we're so close!

3618
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:26,100
Okay, now we have to wait.

3619
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:26,480
Wait.

3620
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:28,660
How do we get her to make another typo?

3621
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:31,020
Um...

3622
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:33,320
Wait.

3623
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:36,240
Uh...

3624
02:34:39,220 --> 02:34:39,580
Um...

3625
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:48,200
Oh!

3626
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:48,660
Pew!

3627
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:51,340
There we go.

3628
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:53,580
Oh, wait.

3629
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:55,020
I wanted to do the other one, though.

3630
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:57,980
I wanted to do the clock, but that's okay.

3631
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:02,040
So� Also, Yen-Rui...

3632
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:02,840
I see you don't know.

3633
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:05,000
Love the flour-haired lady's voice.

3634
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:07,640
No!

3635
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:09,520
Is this the Prime Minister!

3636
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:12,540
If you're Received!

3637
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:14,640
Does that voice belong to Mistress Mint?

3638
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,740
So true!

3639
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:19,220
Who's saying this?

3640
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:19,440
Hello?

3641
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:19,920
Is that you?

3642
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:21,680
Oh.

3643
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:24,860
How many times are you going to make me tell you?

3644
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:28,160
Tonight is that holiest of all nights!

3645
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,180
Tonight is that holiest of all nights!

3646
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:31,940
Please, I'm begging you.

3647
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:34,380
Change your mind and come home to me.

3648
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:38,580
I think you're the one who needs to change his mind.

3649
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,500
Please, put yourself in my position.

3650
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:44,280
You can write your novel just as well from home.

3651
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:49,100
Until you change your mind, your daughter and I won't be coming home.

3652
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:51,900
Even if that means forever!

3653
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:52,320
Forever!

3654
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:59,060
Let me talk to Amelie.

3655
02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:00,800
Her name is Amelie.

3656
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,520
At least...

3657
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:04,140
You can't talk to her.

3658
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:05,960
She's sick with a fever right now.

3659
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:08,200
And I won't have you giving her nightmares.

3660
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:10,960
I want to talk to Papa!

3661
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:14,400
Now, I don't want to hear your voice anymore tonight.

3662
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:17,240
Please, wait a minute.

3663
02:36:18,140 --> 02:36:19,440
Don't try to call again.

3664
02:36:19,560 --> 02:36:20,900
I won't answer.

3665
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:23,620
I refuse to answer!

3666
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:26,600
I love them.

3667
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:27,600
They're so dramatic.

3668
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:31,300
Wow, we get to go to...

3669
02:36:32,460 --> 02:36:32,940
Trouble...

3670
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:36,740
Yay, Trouble...

3671
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:38,720
Trouble Man's apartment.

3672
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:41,320
Oh, whoops.

3673
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:42,560
I didn't mean to press that.

3674
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:45,240
You voice her so well, Mint.

3675
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:46,120
Thank you.

3676
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:50,720
Oh, we can't even reach her though.

3677
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:53,340
I'm curious about what's up there though.

3678
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:54,780
Oh no!

3679
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,380
Okay, we just have to leave then.

3680
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:57,460
After all.

3681
02:36:58,140 --> 02:36:59,820
Look at her being like a lump in there.

3682
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:03,040
Trouble...

3683
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:04,660
Yeah, we still can't reach it.

3684
02:37:04,700 --> 02:37:05,660
Okay, let's leave.

3685
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:09,280
Dialing to Trouble Man's office.

3686
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:19,580
I'm a one man show.

3687
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:21,460
I can voice everybody in this game.

3688
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:27,220
Oh!

3689
02:37:30,320 --> 02:37:31,860
Are you alright sir?

3690
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:36,460
I ordered all of you not to come near me.

3691
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:37,580
Ow!

3692
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:44,900
One of my favorite emotes is the dancing lady emote.

3693
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:44,980
One of my favorite emotes is the dancing lady emote.

3694
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:46,620
Because her legs are all kicked up.

3695
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:47,980
And she's all like, Yippee!

3696
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:51,920
And he looks just like the dancing lady emote.

3697
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:55,220
Oh my gosh, it's so good!

3698
02:37:57,900 --> 02:37:58,460
Yes!

3699
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:04,040
The dancing lady!

3700
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:06,680
It's my favorite on Twitter, I think.

3701
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:08,200
She looks the best on Twitter.

3702
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:10,560
But look at her, she's so yippee!

3703
02:38:14,620 --> 02:38:17,060
Yes, sir!

3704
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:18,100
Hoo!

3705
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:20,320
Ole!

3706
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:24,280
Oh bother!

3707
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:27,360
Another strange room and another strange person.

3708
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:32,220
I wish these telephone lines came with nameplates or something.

3709
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:33,060
Sheesh!

3710
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,140
Alright, let's trick around.

3711
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:37,860
Let's see what we got.

3712
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:41,960
Documents, medicine, bottle...

3713
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:46,660
Water pitcher, flap the flag...

3714
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:48,500
Whoop!

3715
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:52,240
Uh, flap!

3716
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:55,620
No, I still can't reach.

3717
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:57,580
Huh.

3718
02:39:03,970 --> 02:39:05,290
Is there anything else in here?

3719
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:07,270
Oh wow!

3720
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:09,130
Whoa, this room is huge!

3721
02:39:11,110 --> 02:39:12,430
There's a big old melon!

3722
02:39:12,890 --> 02:39:14,950
Oh my god, it must remind him of her!

3723
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:16,970
Aww...

3724
02:39:17,490 --> 02:39:18,950
And the door is open.

3725
02:39:19,170 --> 02:39:19,510
Uh oh.

3726
02:39:20,550 --> 02:39:21,330
Uh oh.

3727
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:23,250
What is with these people?

3728
02:39:23,350 --> 02:39:24,290
Not leaving their...

3729
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:25,810
Not locking their doors.

3730
02:39:30,450 --> 02:39:32,210
Contraption to do the fan.

3731
02:39:33,170 --> 02:39:34,690
Is there anything up in the ceiling?

3732
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:35,190
No.

3733
02:39:37,070 --> 02:39:38,150
Don't say melon.

3734
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:39,870
You need to leave!

3735
02:39:42,410 --> 02:39:42,950
Oh!

3736
02:39:43,470 --> 02:39:44,230
My bad.

3737
02:39:45,190 --> 02:39:46,530
How am I supposed to...

3738
02:39:53,710 --> 02:39:54,950
I still can't reach!

3739
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,430
Hmm.

3740
02:40:03,350 --> 02:40:03,750
Gonzalo!

3741
02:40:07,410 --> 02:40:09,350
That feels like as far as I can get.

3742
02:40:12,650 --> 02:40:15,890
Probably involves the fan, which means there's another way to get to it, but I've...

3743
02:40:15,890 --> 02:40:17,590
There's nothing else that I can...

3744
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:18,450
I can't...

3745
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:19,550
Possess!

3746
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:24,470
Hmm...

3747
02:40:24,470 --> 02:40:25,330
Thanks in the way!

3748
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:30,610
I mean, there's nothing I can possess and do something with, you know?

3749
02:40:37,740 --> 02:40:40,140
Maybe I can't do anything yet...

3750
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,000
Here.

3751
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:44,200
Maybe I have to wait.

3752
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:48,910
Like can I...

3753
02:40:48,910 --> 02:40:50,870
If I go back to this lady's apartment...

3754
02:40:52,610 --> 02:40:53,990
What if I go back to the junkyard?

3755
02:40:53,990 --> 02:40:54,610
Sorry, is she still there?

3756
02:40:54,730 --> 02:40:56,330
No, she said she was going to the restaurant, right?

3757
02:41:01,290 --> 02:41:02,570
Visit missile, I miss him.

3758
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:05,210
Miu Miu, thank you!

3759
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:06,270
I love you so much.

3760
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:06,870
Thank you!

3761
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:11,850
Not much time has passed since I was here last, but the situation has changed.

3762
02:41:14,590 --> 02:41:14,950
Whoa!

3763
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:15,550
Who are these?

3764
02:41:17,650 --> 02:41:19,530
Looks like they're examining my body.

3765
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:20,930
I wonder who they are.

3766
02:41:21,110 --> 02:41:21,490
Oh my gosh!

3767
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:23,590
Phoenix pre-spike!

3768
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:27,030
And the other... oh my god!

3769
02:41:27,470 --> 02:41:28,630
Dancing Pixar.

3770
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:32,390
Besides them, a certain somebody else wriggles and bounces happily.

3771
02:41:32,690 --> 02:41:34,470
I wonder who that person really is too.

3772
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:36,430
It's Feeny!

3773
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:38,830
Welcome back!

3774
02:41:38,990 --> 02:41:40,170
You weren't gone very long.

3775
02:41:40,830 --> 02:41:41,910
What's going on here?

3776
02:41:42,570 --> 02:41:44,690
The police are here to start the criminal investigation.

3777
02:41:45,090 --> 02:41:46,350
You know, into your murder.

3778
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:48,810
The guy in the green suit looks like the other prosecutor.

3779
02:41:49,470 --> 02:41:53,290
The really wimpy guy who always gets his hair blown off.

3780
02:41:55,190 --> 02:41:57,010
John, attorney name Ace.

3781
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:03,250
You know, into your murder?

3782
02:42:03,610 --> 02:42:04,970
My murder case, eh?

3783
02:42:05,530 --> 02:42:06,290
Where is Lin?

3784
02:42:06,490 --> 02:42:07,090
Is she alright?

3785
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:09,690
So you found out her name already, did you?

3786
02:42:09,910 --> 02:42:10,650
I'm impressed.

3787
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:17,260
Excuse me!

3788
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:21,680
Smad scientist.

3789
02:42:22,940 --> 02:42:25,800
Sounded like she was in some sort of... some kind of immediate danger.

3790
02:42:27,560 --> 02:42:28,360
Where is Gumshoe?

3791
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,280
So true, I missed that guy.

3792
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:32,080
Mr. Payne!

3793
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:35,060
Yes, that's the other attorney at... or sorry, prosecutor.

3794
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:36,700
Yes, yes.

3795
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:40,120
Not to mention the fact that Hitman is after her again.

3796
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:44,580
I'm eating again.

3797
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:47,280
I am once again taking a bite of chicken.

3798
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:49,560
Oh, um...

3799
02:43:05,350 --> 02:43:07,090
You don't have to worry about that kind of thing.

3800
02:43:08,230 --> 02:43:08,710
What?

3801
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:12,470
She was just taken into custody a few minutes ago.

3802
02:43:13,350 --> 02:43:14,570
C-c-c-custody?

3803
02:43:14,910 --> 02:43:16,010
You mean she was arrested?

3804
02:43:16,390 --> 02:43:16,810
But why?

3805
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:23,200
I feel bad because your chicken is probably cold by now.

3806
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:24,160
It is, but that's okay.

3807
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:25,240
I'll eat anything.

3808
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:27,160
I'm a hungry ghost.

3809
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:30,220
I don't know.

3810
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:31,200
I'm just a desk lamp.

3811
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:32,140
Shut up!

3812
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:32,700
No, you're not!

3813
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,340
I better see what I can find out.

3814
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:37,100
Trick time.

3815
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:38,660
Doesn't he look like Payne?

3816
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:42,520
Traffical.

3817
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:43,060
Ultra.

3818
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:45,180
My body.

3819
02:43:45,700 --> 02:43:46,220
Sizzle.

3820
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:47,860
Bag.

3821
02:43:52,460 --> 02:43:53,720
What do you say in here?

3822
02:43:54,580 --> 02:43:55,640
Quite a thing, huh?

3823
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:56,400
This case.

3824
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,140
Yes!

3825
02:43:58,420 --> 02:43:59,560
I'm one of our own!

3826
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:00,220
A murderer!

3827
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:02,360
Heads will roll over this!

3828
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:03,660
One of our own?

3829
02:44:07,460 --> 02:44:09,820
Starting my first ever job next week!

3830
02:44:10,020 --> 02:44:10,680
I'm so excited.

3831
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:12,760
Your streams have kept me motivated these past few weeks.

3832
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,340
So thank you so much!

3833
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:14,520
Thank you!

3834
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,140
So lucky!

3835
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:16,940
Congratulations!

3836
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:20,960
Congrats!

3837
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:23,700
I hope you have fun!

3838
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,460
Fake Phoenix and fake Payne.

3839
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:28,200
She's a rookie too.

3840
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:30,120
Wait, so she is with them?

3841
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:33,040
Oh, I heard she was carrying out some crazy investigation.

3842
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:36,480
Rookies aren't given craziest timings like that!

3843
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:38,180
Not even rookies like Lin!

3844
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:40,020
I can't.

3845
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:40,420
Oh god.

3846
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:43,200
I can't do it.

3847
02:44:43,280 --> 02:44:43,700
I can't do it!

3848
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:43,940
Oh, I can't do it!

3849
02:44:49,020 --> 02:44:52,360
Yeah, but I heard she was... special.

3850
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:58,800
She's got strong ties to Inspector Cabanela of the Special Investigation Unit.

3851
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:04,400
I plan on moving up the ladder on my own merits myself, okay?

3852
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:08,520
Just jealous that she's better than you?

3853
02:45:10,860 --> 02:45:14,320
It's because the chicken I'm eating has a tiny bit of spice.

3854
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:18,440
So when I use my throat in that way...

3855
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:23,860
My... I... what's the word?

3856
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:26,780
I get the spice all in my throat.

3857
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:29,060
Also, I just noticed that the doctor is blue.

3858
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:33,780
I think he's not on our side.

3859
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:35,160
I think he's with the bad guys.

3860
02:45:35,900 --> 02:45:36,520
Uh-oh.

3861
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:38,440
Uh-oh.

3862
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,060
Or he's a zombie.

3863
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:40,500
I don't know.

3864
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:45,600
Whoa.

3865
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:46,640
Wait, detective!

3866
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:48,760
Shouldn't be standing around gossiping.

3867
02:45:48,780 --> 02:45:50,320
Never know who might be listening.

3868
02:45:51,720 --> 02:45:52,620
Like me.

3869
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:56,180
Like me?

3870
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:58,480
Oh god, he looks like a zombie for real!

3871
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:01,720
What?

3872
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:07,200
I think we can safely assume the cause of death was the bullet he took in the chest.

3873
02:46:10,140 --> 02:46:11,320
Bring the stretcher.

3874
02:46:11,380 --> 02:46:13,600
I'll look into the rest back at the lab.

3875
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:16,420
He's so... he looks so scary.

3876
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:23,200
Would you mind waiting here for a bit, doctor?

3877
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:27,660
Inspector Cabanella, head of the Special Investigation Unit, is on his way now.

3878
02:46:28,420 --> 02:46:29,860
They have to say his full title.

3879
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:31,220
Dr. Luigi.

3880
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:35,120
If it has spice, why don't you just dunk the chicken in milk?

3881
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:36,920
So true.

3882
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:38,880
Thanks for the super chat!

3883
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:41,220
Special Investigation Unit?

3884
02:46:41,660 --> 02:46:42,100
Why?

3885
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:44,860
What do they want with a case like this?

3886
02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:47,760
Sorry, he has a big mustache, so he's probably got a refined voice.

3887
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:50,460
I don't know.

3888
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:52,580
But Cabanella's our top investigator.

3889
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:58,180
We don't want him... want to get him all bent out of shape, or there'll be hell to pay.

3890
02:47:00,660 --> 02:47:02,780
I don't see what that has to do with me.

3891
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:05,360
So true, doctor.

3892
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:09,060
I don't really get what Cabanella wants to come for either.

3893
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:13,340
It's probably just a big lark for him, but it makes things tougher on us.

3894
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:16,000
Hey, watch what you say behind his back.

3895
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:17,680
Never know who might be listening.

3896
02:47:17,940 --> 02:47:18,740
Like me.

3897
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:20,620
And me.

3898
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:30,620
Is that him?

3899
02:47:33,940 --> 02:47:35,220
Woah, he's...

3900
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:37,860
He's kind of awesome.

3901
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:40,680
Wow!

3902
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:46,260
The tension of a crime scene.

3903
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:48,540
Oh!

3904
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,300
Oh!

3905
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:49,660
Oh!

3906
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:51,080
Yeah!

3907
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:53,340
Nothing like it, baby!

3908
02:47:56,540 --> 02:47:57,620
He's Elvis!

3909
02:47:59,880 --> 02:48:00,900
Oh my god!

3910
02:48:01,060 --> 02:48:01,460
Woah!

3911
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:04,700
Oh my god, he's so smooth, boss!

3912
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:05,760
Oh, wow!

3913
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:06,500
Woah!

3914
02:48:15,940 --> 02:48:16,840
Evenin', boys.

3915
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:18,280
How's it looking?

3916
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:20,400
Inspector Cabanella!

3917
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:21,680
Thank you for coming.

3918
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,340
Allow me to report, sir.

3919
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:25,260
Fine, fine.

3920
02:48:25,500 --> 02:48:27,100
You just gotta hold that thought.

3921
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:29,500
I'm gonna make a little phone call first.

3922
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:32,260
I was gonna...

3923
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:34,380
Oh my god, I stopped.

3924
02:48:34,540 --> 02:48:40,740
I was literally about to say, I'm surprised he didn't spin around when picking up the phone first, but he picked up the phone and spun afterwards!

3925
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:44,520
So this is the head of the Special Investigation Unit.

3926
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:46,960
He seems... unique?

3927
02:48:46,960 --> 02:48:47,240
Unique?

3928
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:51,970
Trick time!

3929
02:48:52,270 --> 02:48:53,850
Alright, let's... who is he talking to?

3930
02:48:54,050 --> 02:48:54,790
Look at them.

3931
02:48:55,810 --> 02:48:58,610
Here he is for his big lark.

3932
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:01,530
Aren't you going to confront him about it?

3933
02:49:01,570 --> 02:49:02,050
About what?

3934
02:49:03,330 --> 02:49:04,770
I'm going to make my report!

3935
02:49:05,390 --> 02:49:06,970
Yeah, that's about what I figured.

3936
02:49:09,070 --> 02:49:10,950
You have no spine!

3937
02:49:11,050 --> 02:49:12,410
You have no spine.

3938
02:49:12,410 --> 02:49:12,750
Come on.

3939
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,140
Deal me the deal.

3940
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:28,660
How's it going over there, baby?

3941
02:49:30,060 --> 02:49:30,540
Going?

3942
02:49:31,180 --> 02:49:32,680
How is it going, you ask?

3943
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:34,600
You'd like to know how it's going?

3944
02:49:35,500 --> 02:49:37,820
I would say it's going well enough.

3945
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:40,700
About fair to average, if I had to say.

3946
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:42,200
Yes, it's going alright!

3947
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:46,240
The star child?

3948
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:49,640
Not the man I was hoping to talk to there, baby.

3949
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:53,420
Do me a favor and put that other nice man on the horn now, would you?

3950
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:55,540
That's a nice fellow.

3951
02:49:56,300 --> 02:49:59,820
If it had anything to do with this park, I'm the one to talk to.

3952
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:02,020
I'm the guardian of this park.

3953
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:02,900
Yes!

3954
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:05,060
Who is this?

3955
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:06,680
They do kind of look like Lottie.

3956
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:07,720
Oh!

3957
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:10,020
Get out of here!

3958
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:13,160
Sorry about that, Inspector.

3959
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:14,220
I just got here.

3960
02:50:16,840 --> 02:50:19,580
Well, glad to hear you made it.

3961
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:22,260
That other fellow just about threw me for a loop.

3962
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:26,180
Yeah, a lot of harp.

3963
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:27,360
Yeah, yeah.

3964
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:30,900
Started blathering something about being the guardian of the park or some such.

3965
02:50:32,020 --> 02:50:32,620
Yes, him.

3966
02:50:33,740 --> 02:50:34,540
Sorry about that.

3967
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,880
Well, start doing your staking out.

3968
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:41,940
Well, start doing your staking out thing, baby.

3969
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:43,960
And buzz me if anything comes up.

3970
02:50:44,980 --> 02:50:45,660
Yes, sir.

3971
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:48,160
Yes, sir.

3972
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:50,800
Trace complete.

3973
02:50:50,900 --> 02:50:52,020
We're going to the park.

3974
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:53,600
Park.

3975
02:50:58,340 --> 02:50:59,260
Now then, sir.

3976
02:50:59,380 --> 02:51:00,140
If I make my...

3977
02:51:00,140 --> 02:51:00,560
If I...

3978
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:00,940
If I...

3979
02:51:00,940 --> 02:51:02,080
If I make...

3980
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:03,180
If I...

3981
02:51:05,320 --> 02:51:07,920
If I may make my report, sir.

3982
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:10,320
Doc Yoohoo.

3983
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:11,400
Oh, Doc.

3984
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:16,620
Talking to me?

3985
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:20,320
I need you to handle this case with your finest care and attention.

3986
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:21,780
Would you do that for me, Doc?

3987
02:51:22,340 --> 02:51:23,660
That guy stutters a lot.

3988
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:24,220
Yeah, he does.

3989
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:27,200
What a loser with a stutter.

3990
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:32,900
Don't need you to tell me how to do my job.

3991
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:35,320
I like the doctor.

3992
02:51:36,540 --> 02:51:39,080
Anyhoo, I'd like to see the suspect now, if I may.

3993
02:51:39,080 --> 02:51:40,760
I'm sorry, sir.

3994
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:45,140
I asked her to let herself be taken into custody voluntarily, sir.

3995
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:49,480
She's being detained in the Junkyard Super Attendant's Office right now.

3996
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:52,620
Super's Office, eh?

3997
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:53,540
Super.

3998
02:51:53,660 --> 02:51:54,660
And where's that?

3999
02:51:58,260 --> 02:51:59,740
Yeah, what a loser.

4000
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:00,660
Yeah.

4001
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:04,880
Wait, stop stuttering, Bozo.

4002
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:09,060
Just beyond my limit.

4003
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:10,460
Somewhere you parked your bicycle, Inspector.

4004
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:11,680
Where?

4005
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:14,560
Oh, they lowered the drawbridge.

4006
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:16,700
I'll go interview the suspect then.

4007
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:18,560
Yeah, nothing like it, baby.

4008
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:21,180
Wait, I need to go follow him.

4009
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:21,840
Oh, oh.

4010
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:24,140
Carry on, boys.

4011
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:27,640
Good luck, sir.

4012
02:52:35,300 --> 02:52:36,100
Look at him go.

4013
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:37,520
Even up the stairs.

4014
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:38,780
He's so cool.

4015
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,360
Trick time.

4016
02:52:46,660 --> 02:52:50,000
That Inspector Cabanela, he sure has a strange air about him.

4017
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:51,560
You can say that again.

4018
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:54,100
And I've never seen anybody use stairs the way he does.

4019
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:59,560
I hear he is dancing his way up the stairs of promotion that same airy way.

4020
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:00,520
He's like the Joker.

4021
02:53:01,580 --> 02:53:03,700
And I hear Lin is his personal favorite.

4022
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:05,600
What's the deal between those two?

4023
02:53:06,660 --> 02:53:08,160
Hey, now should I know.

4024
02:53:10,920 --> 02:53:12,420
How do I get up there anyway?

4025
02:53:23,450 --> 02:53:24,290
Traffic sign.

4026
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:26,170
Traffic cone.

4027
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:27,010
Umbrella.

4028
02:53:29,390 --> 02:53:31,470
I guess maybe we go to the park instead.

4029
02:53:34,730 --> 02:53:35,290
Right?

4030
02:53:36,990 --> 02:53:38,210
Let's just check it out.

4031
02:53:39,950 --> 02:53:41,450
We live in a society.

4032
02:53:49,250 --> 02:53:53,230
It appears to be the entrance to a nearly deserted, dimly lit park.

4033
02:53:54,390 --> 02:53:57,790
The voices of two young people drift over to me on the breeze.

4034
02:54:01,870 --> 02:54:03,430
What is going on?

4035
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:06,770
Stop the park from being turned into a housing site.

4036
02:54:06,930 --> 02:54:07,910
Protect the park.

4037
02:54:08,070 --> 02:54:09,450
The rock of the gods.

4038
02:54:12,510 --> 02:54:14,550
Sorry, but could you do that somewhere else?

4039
02:54:14,850 --> 02:54:16,110
I'm a little busy right now.

4040
02:54:16,210 --> 02:54:17,330
I don't have time to talk.

4041
02:54:18,530 --> 02:54:21,310
I suppose you think I'm a man of dubious character.

4042
02:54:21,630 --> 02:54:23,290
A questionable person.

4043
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:25,750
No, I...

4044
02:54:26,770 --> 02:54:32,050
But if an objective person were asked, they might think you were a little suspicious yourself.

4045
02:54:33,070 --> 02:54:33,850
So true.

4046
02:54:34,070 --> 02:54:35,870
How does he get his hair like that?

4047
02:54:38,370 --> 02:54:39,430
As two suspicious people.

4048
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:39,990
Two suspicious characters.

4049
02:54:40,330 --> 02:54:43,310
Shouldn't we take the time to converse with each other?

4050
02:54:45,330 --> 02:54:46,630
That's one way to put it, pal.

4051
02:54:47,110 --> 02:54:47,970
Oh boy.

4052
02:54:48,110 --> 02:54:48,510
All right.

4053
02:54:48,810 --> 02:54:49,970
Just for a minute.

4054
02:54:51,510 --> 02:54:52,950
Hope you have a great stream today.

4055
02:54:53,070 --> 02:54:53,890
Min just came home.

4056
02:54:53,950 --> 02:54:54,670
Welcome home.

4057
02:54:55,130 --> 02:54:55,990
Welcome home, Nine.

4058
02:54:56,170 --> 02:54:56,890
Thank you.

4059
02:54:57,870 --> 02:54:58,350
There.

4060
02:54:58,490 --> 02:54:59,630
I like your attitude.

4061
02:54:59,970 --> 02:55:01,210
I like it very much.

4062
02:55:02,030 --> 02:55:04,030
Let's relax and talk a while then.

4063
02:55:04,810 --> 02:55:06,110
The night is young.

4064
02:55:06,270 --> 02:55:07,910
And so are we.

4065
02:55:09,430 --> 02:55:09,610
Oh man.

4066
02:55:12,330 --> 02:55:14,710
Is he flirting or...

4067
02:55:15,430 --> 02:55:16,490
I don't really know.

4068
02:55:18,150 --> 02:55:19,770
We have this leaflet.

4069
02:55:22,610 --> 02:55:24,970
Oh, we can't literally go anywhere else.

4070
02:55:25,330 --> 02:55:26,070
Oh no.

4071
02:55:27,990 --> 02:55:28,710
Back

4072
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,680
to the junkyard, I suppose.

4073
02:55:43,170 --> 02:55:44,530
Couple dead ends.

4074
02:55:44,750 --> 02:55:44,890
Yeah.

4075
02:55:44,890 --> 02:55:47,090
I was trying to get tired too.

4076
02:55:47,270 --> 02:55:50,690
So might end soon-ish.

4077
02:55:50,750 --> 02:55:54,830
I wanted to end if we like saved one more person because it kind of like gave us that save.

4078
02:55:55,090 --> 02:55:55,450
But...

4079
02:56:01,060 --> 02:56:02,180
Oh, what's the dog saying?

4080
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:04,100
Oh.

4081
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:06,520
I think we can safely...

4082
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:08,480
Pretty safely assume that this was the murder weapon.

4083
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:10,100
They found the murder weapon.

4084
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:12,540
Can you not use the lamp?

4085
02:56:12,580 --> 02:56:13,140
It's not moving.

4086
02:56:14,100 --> 02:56:14,620
Oh no.

4087
02:56:14,660 --> 02:56:15,120
That pistol.

4088
02:56:15,700 --> 02:56:16,380
Is it hers?

4089
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:16,900
Is it Lin's?

4090
02:56:17,320 --> 02:56:17,680
Oh no.

4091
02:56:18,300 --> 02:56:21,760
Same model as the pistols you detectives carry around.

4092
02:56:22,900 --> 02:56:25,280
You don't think it's Lin's, do you?

4093
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:26,760
Unless I'm a detective.

4094
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:28,200
No.

4095
02:56:28,420 --> 02:56:29,180
I'm Lupin.

4096
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:31,740
Lupin...

4097
02:56:32,940 --> 02:56:33,880
Lupin's cousin.

4098
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:35,720
This is not good.

4099
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:38,180
If it is hers, it's Jover.

4100
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:42,080
So Lin is a detective and the murder weapon might be her pistol.

4101
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:43,680
What could it all mean?

4102
02:56:45,340 --> 02:56:46,120
Trick time.

4103
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:50,140
Yeah.

4104
02:56:50,140 --> 02:56:52,520
See, I can't reach the lamp and it's not moving anymore.

4105
02:56:56,200 --> 02:56:58,000
This is the weapon that took my life.

4106
02:56:58,520 --> 02:56:59,440
A pistol, eh?

4107
02:56:59,620 --> 02:57:01,620
My memory seems to be hazy on pistols.

4108
02:57:01,940 --> 02:57:03,240
But I have seen them before.

4109
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:03,920
That's for sure.

4110
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:04,660
Let's see.

4111
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:06,580
This part right here is...

4112
02:57:06,580 --> 02:57:06,660
Oh!

4113
02:57:12,140 --> 02:57:15,060
If you want to fire the thing, aim it in your own direction.

4114
02:57:15,720 --> 02:57:16,120
.

4115
02:57:16,800 --> 02:57:18,440
Lupin the 3.5.

4116
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:20,260
Groupon the 3rd.

4117
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:23,600
I didn't fire it.

4118
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:24,660
I'm the victim here.

4119
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:28,020
This is the act of somebody who's jealous of my abilities as a detective.

4120
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:31,360
Well, what are you glaring at me for?

4121
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:32,800
I'm hardly jealous of you.

4122
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:35,280
Well, guess that proves it's a real gun.

4123
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:36,880
Sheesh.

4124
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,040
What was that?

4125
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:42,940
Is that what I think it was?

4126
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:44,980
The sound of a gun.

4127
02:57:52,030 --> 02:57:54,250
I've got a bad feeling about this.

4128
02:57:54,590 --> 02:57:56,970
Every time that phone rings, it's bad news.

4129
02:57:57,910 --> 02:57:59,430
It's like that old riddle.

4130
02:57:59,890 --> 02:58:00,910
Which came first?

4131
02:58:01,130 --> 02:58:03,150
The ringing of the phone or the crime case?

4132
02:58:04,690 --> 02:58:05,250
Classic.

4133
02:58:06,110 --> 02:58:07,070
Classic saying.

4134
02:58:07,490 --> 02:58:08,630
If you say so.

4135
02:58:11,710 --> 02:58:12,450
Uh-oh.

4136
02:58:13,190 --> 02:58:14,230
Doctor's like, anyway.

4137
02:58:14,970 --> 02:58:15,690
That was...

4138
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:16,350
That sounded bad.

4139
02:58:16,610 --> 02:58:17,330
Um, anyway.

4140
02:58:18,150 --> 02:58:18,710
Oh!

4141
02:58:18,710 --> 02:58:18,810
Oh!

4142
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:20,910
Ah, there you are.

4143
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:24,010
Do me a favor and have the doc come to you.

4144
02:58:24,430 --> 02:58:27,250
To the super's office, would you?

4145
02:58:27,890 --> 02:58:30,090
Uh, he seems pretty busy at the moment, sir.

4146
02:58:30,770 --> 02:58:31,850
Which one of you...

4147
02:58:31,850 --> 02:58:32,770
Which one are you?

4148
02:58:32,850 --> 02:58:34,250
The green one or the blue one?

4149
02:58:35,950 --> 02:58:37,830
I'm the green one, sir.

4150
02:58:38,410 --> 02:58:39,390
Listen, greenie.

4151
02:58:39,530 --> 02:58:42,210
Get the good doc over here this instant.

4152
02:58:42,810 --> 02:58:44,130
Or I'll see it.

4153
02:58:44,390 --> 02:58:46,670
You'll never wear a green suit again.

4154
02:58:47,090 --> 02:58:47,190
Oh!

4155
02:58:47,190 --> 02:58:49,930
You'll only be wearing black and white stripes.

4156
02:58:50,370 --> 02:58:52,090
In the slammer.

4157
02:58:53,110 --> 02:58:53,870
Yes, sir.

4158
02:58:53,930 --> 02:58:55,070
I'll send him up right, sir.

4159
02:59:00,910 --> 02:59:03,050
We're going to the super's office.

4160
02:59:04,250 --> 02:59:05,210
Here he goes.

4161
02:59:05,890 --> 02:59:06,630
Please, doctor.

4162
02:59:06,730 --> 02:59:08,530
Go to the superintendent's office immediately.

4163
02:59:10,110 --> 02:59:11,110
If I must.

4164
02:59:13,150 --> 02:59:14,190
There he goes.

4165
02:59:14,290 --> 02:59:15,150
Shuffling away.

4166
02:59:15,770 --> 02:59:17,650
No one cares about my body.

4167
02:59:18,850 --> 02:59:19,770
What's going on?

4168
02:59:20,670 --> 02:59:22,730
Don't ask me, but something seems really, really wrong.

4169
02:59:23,770 --> 02:59:26,830
That shot sounded like it was coming from somewhere around the maintenance building.

4170
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:29,030
Okay.

4171
02:59:29,730 --> 02:59:31,510
Uh, dial.

4172
02:59:33,670 --> 02:59:35,570
To the super's office.

4173
02:59:36,890 --> 02:59:37,710
Who died?

4174
02:59:37,970 --> 02:59:38,510
Oh my god, wait.

4175
02:59:40,590 --> 02:59:42,550
There might be someone that actually died.

4176
02:59:43,930 --> 02:59:48,050
Yet another gunshot rings out in the lonely junkyard on the edge of town.

4177
02:59:48,050 --> 02:59:52,870
The sound gives me the feeling a new death will be waiting on the other side of the line.

4178
02:59:53,010 --> 02:59:54,030
It better not be her again.

4179
02:59:55,470 --> 02:59:58,430
Apparently, I'm not the only one the Reaper's interested in tonight.

4180
02:59:58,710 --> 03:00:02,710
But as long as there's anything I can do about it, I don't plan on letting anyone else die.

4181
03:00:03,390 --> 03:00:04,190
Is it Lynn?

4182
03:00:04,550 --> 03:00:05,110
I don't know.

4183
03:00:05,170 --> 03:00:05,690
I hope not.

4184
03:00:07,410 --> 03:00:07,830
Lynn?

4185
03:00:08,550 --> 03:00:09,430
Are you alive?

4186
03:00:11,170 --> 03:00:12,050
Are you good?

4187
03:00:12,170 --> 03:00:13,130
Oh, we cleared it!

4188
03:00:13,390 --> 03:00:13,810
Nice!

4189
03:00:16,810 --> 03:00:17,210
Um...

4190
03:00:19,650 --> 03:00:20,910
What a funny illustration.

4191
03:00:21,130 --> 03:00:22,710
It's just... it's just the laugh.

4192
03:00:23,190 --> 03:00:24,670
Riko, thanks for the 20 gifted!

4193
03:00:24,790 --> 03:00:25,250
Thank you!

4194
03:00:26,590 --> 03:00:26,990
Yes.

4195
03:00:27,090 --> 03:00:27,490
Okay, good.

4196
03:00:27,550 --> 03:00:28,230
We got the save.

4197
03:00:28,330 --> 03:00:31,510
I am kind of curious to see, though, who died.

4198
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:34,530
So we'll see, and then I'll end it here.

4199
03:00:34,930 --> 03:00:35,690
Chapter 4.

4200
03:00:35,750 --> 03:00:37,110
How many chapters are there, actually?

4201
03:00:37,170 --> 03:00:37,650
I have no idea.

4202
03:00:40,810 --> 03:00:43,070
Changing a person's fate is no easy task.

4203
03:00:43,810 --> 03:00:45,490
Especially when their fate is death.

4204
03:00:47,710 --> 03:00:51,210
The scene at the other end of the line is pretty much what I expected.

4205
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:53,210
All except for one thing.

4206
03:00:56,500 --> 03:00:57,860
Oh, that is her.

4207
03:00:58,220 --> 03:00:58,680
No!

4208
03:00:58,820 --> 03:00:59,320
No!

4209
03:00:59,680 --> 03:00:59,820
Lynn!

4210
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:03,080
Hang in there, baby!

4211
03:01:05,640 --> 03:01:06,140
What?

4212
03:01:06,840 --> 03:01:11,940
It looks like some piece of trash shot her from the top of the pile of garbage outside!

4213
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:15,100
Here, let me take a look at her.

4214
03:01:15,180 --> 03:01:16,560
Maybe there's something I...

4215
03:01:17,240 --> 03:01:18,900
Sorry, can't allow that, Pigeon Man.

4216
03:01:19,700 --> 03:01:21,640
I investigate, and you superintend.

4217
03:01:21,960 --> 03:01:23,540
You have your job, and I have mine.

4218
03:01:23,620 --> 03:01:27,320
I feel like they keep killing off Lynn so that we can't get more information out of her.

4219
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:29,960
So that more things are mysterious.

4220
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:33,940
She seems like the type that would, like, info dump, you know?

4221
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:37,760
And, like, kind of explain things to us out loud.

4222
03:01:48,510 --> 03:01:52,090
Let's leave each other to his own profession, shall we?

4223
03:01:54,590 --> 03:01:56,090
Yeah, well, here's what I think.

4224
03:01:56,390 --> 03:02:00,150
How much of a pro can you be if you let her get shot right in front of you?

4225
03:02:01,250 --> 03:02:03,750
Anyway, have it your way.

4226
03:02:03,830 --> 03:02:04,970
I'll stay out of your hair.

4227
03:02:06,930 --> 03:02:10,070
We got the mad scientist with his little... little pigeon.

4228
03:02:10,450 --> 03:02:11,170
So cute.

4229
03:02:15,110 --> 03:02:15,590
Oh!

4230
03:02:16,410 --> 03:02:20,210
Where did the... did the bird drop it?

4231
03:02:20,270 --> 03:02:20,530
So cute.

4232
03:02:22,430 --> 03:02:22,910
Bird.

4233
03:02:25,290 --> 03:02:25,770
What?

4234
03:02:26,110 --> 03:02:27,250
He's so awesome.

4235
03:02:27,610 --> 03:02:28,830
That was so smooth.

4236
03:02:30,090 --> 03:02:31,470
That's not how... okay.

4237
03:02:33,330 --> 03:02:34,290
Everything's so goofy.

4238
03:02:35,390 --> 03:02:36,590
What took you so long?

4239
03:02:36,730 --> 03:02:37,790
Quit dragging your feet.

4240
03:02:39,830 --> 03:02:41,350
Who are you to shout at me?

4241
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:43,450
Now let me have a look at the victim.

4242
03:02:46,850 --> 03:02:49,710
I haven't even looked yet, but I can already tell you she's dead.

4243
03:02:50,510 --> 03:02:52,750
Her second death of the night, actually.

4244
03:02:53,290 --> 03:02:55,890
Yo, she's... it's like... it's like Final Destination.

4245
03:02:56,170 --> 03:02:57,250
You're fated to die.

4246
03:02:59,670 --> 03:03:01,010
Yeah, I'm getting kind of eepy.

4247
03:03:01,370 --> 03:03:06,090
We are going to... stop here.

4248
03:03:06,590 --> 03:03:08,130
So I'm gonna say... oh, whoops.

4249
03:03:08,210 --> 03:03:08,450
Nope.

4250
03:03:08,530 --> 03:03:08,930
There we go.

4251
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:10,030
I'm going to save.

4252
03:03:10,170 --> 03:03:10,490
Yes.

4253
03:03:11,210 --> 03:03:14,930
And, um, we shall continue this next time.

4254
03:03:15,450 --> 03:03:17,150
Um, sometime next week.

4255
03:03:18,030 --> 03:03:19,050
Yes, yes, yes.

4256
03:03:20,090 --> 03:03:20,910
Sounds good.

4257
03:03:22,530 --> 03:03:23,790
Uh, continue playing.

4258
03:03:24,150 --> 03:03:24,470
No.

4259
03:03:25,250 --> 03:03:26,050
I'm sleepy.

4260
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:29,590
Oh, 15 chapters left?

4261
03:03:29,930 --> 03:03:30,870
So it's 20?

4262
03:03:31,390 --> 03:03:31,870
What?

4263
03:03:31,990 --> 03:03:32,510
20 chapters?

4264
03:03:32,670 --> 03:03:34,570
I know that it said, like, how long to beat.

4265
03:03:34,610 --> 03:03:35,250
It said about...

4266
03:03:36,990 --> 03:03:38,250
Uh, 20 hours?

4267
03:03:38,510 --> 03:03:39,210
Oh, not 20.

4268
03:03:39,230 --> 03:03:40,290
Sorry, 12 hours.

4269
03:03:40,910 --> 03:03:44,290
Um, but with, like, reading and talking and everything, you can kind of...

4270
03:03:44,950 --> 03:03:46,410
extend that a little bit longer.

4271
03:03:46,810 --> 03:03:47,250
Maybe.

4272
03:03:48,030 --> 03:03:49,070
Um, but we'll see.

4273
03:03:52,190 --> 03:03:52,630
18?

4274
03:03:52,890 --> 03:03:54,810
18 hours or 18 chapters?

4275
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:59,110
Weird logarithm.

4276
03:03:59,230 --> 03:03:59,990
Thank you for the five.

4277
03:04:00,050 --> 03:04:00,310
Get it!

4278
03:04:00,590 --> 03:04:01,410
Thank you!

4279
03:04:01,950 --> 03:04:02,630
Thank you, thank you.

4280
03:04:05,250 --> 03:04:07,170
But, uh, it's a ride.

4281
03:04:07,330 --> 03:04:07,890
I'm excited.

4282
03:04:08,210 --> 03:04:09,590
12 hours sounds canon.

4283
03:04:10,270 --> 03:04:12,390
There's 14 left, so there's still a long run.

4284
03:04:12,570 --> 03:04:12,810
Yeah.

4285
03:04:12,910 --> 03:04:13,530
I'm excited.

4286
03:04:13,650 --> 03:04:14,610
I'm already so invested.

4287
03:04:15,130 --> 03:04:16,070
Thanks for the stream.

4288
03:04:16,190 --> 03:04:17,230
This is one of my favorite games.

4289
03:04:17,310 --> 03:04:18,370
It's so cool seeing you play it.

4290
03:04:18,450 --> 03:04:18,610
Yeah!

4291
03:04:18,750 --> 03:04:19,430
I won it!

4292
03:04:19,450 --> 03:04:21,030
I've been wanting to play it a really long time.

4293
03:04:21,330 --> 03:04:25,190
And, uh, my friend, she recommended it, so I was like, well...

4294
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:28,350
I mean, I'm a ghost, so now's the perfect time to play it.

4295
03:04:29,870 --> 03:04:31,230
Favorite character so far?

4296
03:04:33,810 --> 03:04:34,210
Missile.

4297
03:04:35,710 --> 03:04:36,910
I like Missile.

4298
03:04:36,990 --> 03:04:40,010
I like, actually, the fanfiction lady, too.

4299
03:04:41,590 --> 03:04:42,310
But, uh...

4300
03:04:45,090 --> 03:04:48,190
Today's my birthday, but the only thing I got gifted was a written exam!

4301
03:04:48,530 --> 03:04:49,630
Can I ask her happy birthday?

4302
03:04:49,770 --> 03:04:51,670
Of course, Tripp Tripp!

4303
03:04:51,750 --> 03:04:52,890
Happy birthday!

4304
03:04:54,810 --> 03:04:57,890
Happy birthday to you.

4305
03:04:58,530 --> 03:05:01,390
Happy birthday to you.

4306
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:05,730
Happy birthday, dear Tripp Tripp.

4307
03:05:07,830 --> 03:05:11,730
Happy birthday to you.

4308
03:05:14,770 --> 03:05:15,570
Happy birthday!

4309
03:05:18,310 --> 03:05:18,890
Missile cute.

4310
03:05:19,030 --> 03:05:19,550
Missile so cute.

4311
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:20,830
Thanks for the stream, Mint.

4312
03:05:20,930 --> 03:05:22,090
You did some great voices.

4313
03:05:22,110 --> 03:05:23,890
It was fun to listen to while I worked.

4314
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:28,090
I tried to because, like, what if you're not looking and you're like, who's talking, you know?

4315
03:05:28,590 --> 03:05:30,610
I saw people finishing four to five streams.

4316
03:05:30,770 --> 03:05:32,190
Okay, that's totally doable then.

4317
03:05:33,830 --> 03:05:34,690
It's totally doable.

4318
03:05:35,050 --> 03:05:37,730
I'm gonna, I'm gonna try and finish before, because, um...

4319
03:05:37,730 --> 03:05:41,150
In the next, in the upcoming weeks, I'm gonna be, uh...

4320
03:05:41,730 --> 03:05:43,730
Going out of town, um...

4321
03:05:43,730 --> 03:05:44,970
Oh, well, no.

4322
03:05:45,230 --> 03:05:48,030
I keep thinking I'm going out of town for one weekend, but I'm not.

4323
03:05:48,570 --> 03:05:52,910
But I am going out of town, and then before I know it, I'll be going to Japan, so...

4324
03:05:52,910 --> 03:05:56,290
So much going on already.

4325
03:05:58,450 --> 03:06:01,150
But tomorrow, I'll be collabing with, um...

4326
03:06:01,150 --> 03:06:03,890
Haruka, Matara, and Henya again.

4327
03:06:03,990 --> 03:06:05,070
We're playing Left 4 Dead.

4328
03:06:05,150 --> 03:06:05,310
Oh!

4329
03:06:05,590 --> 03:06:08,370
I gotta, I gotta get some... I gotta get some of the...

4330
03:06:08,810 --> 03:06:11,250
Some of the models and stuff.

4331
03:06:12,490 --> 03:06:14,170
I gotta get some of the models.

4332
03:06:15,670 --> 03:06:17,970
Um, and the, the download stuffs.

4333
03:06:18,270 --> 03:06:19,350
Yeah, get them mods.

4334
03:06:19,510 --> 03:06:19,890
Yeah!

4335
03:06:22,230 --> 03:06:22,630
Wowza!

4336
03:06:22,650 --> 03:06:24,570
I ghost tricked back in time to send this!

4337
03:06:24,790 --> 03:06:25,050
Woohoo!

4338
03:06:25,130 --> 03:06:26,130
Thanks for unwrapping!

4339
03:06:28,730 --> 03:06:30,570
This game is a legendary puzzle game.

4340
03:06:30,650 --> 03:06:32,710
Might consider picking it up again while it's on sale too.

4341
03:06:32,790 --> 03:06:33,350
Thanks for the stream.

4342
03:06:33,410 --> 03:06:33,670
Yeah!

4343
03:06:33,830 --> 03:06:35,630
I got it on sale, actually, for the Switch.

4344
03:06:35,690 --> 03:06:36,430
It is on sale.

4345
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:37,110
Um...

4346
03:06:38,230 --> 03:06:40,450
It was like $10 off, so it was really awesome.

4347
03:06:40,450 --> 03:06:41,870
I was like, yahoo!

4348
03:06:42,610 --> 03:06:43,050
Yippee!

4349
03:06:43,610 --> 03:06:45,390
I tried calling you on my Ouija board.

4350
03:06:45,610 --> 03:06:47,330
But all it said was...

4351
03:06:49,330 --> 03:06:49,770
Gronsaker.

4352
03:06:50,050 --> 03:06:50,470
What's that?

4353
03:06:50,690 --> 03:06:53,630
Turns out I accidentally used my Norwegian...

4354
03:06:55,630 --> 03:06:56,510
...board instead.

4355
03:06:59,570 --> 03:07:01,010
Classic mistake, honestly.

4356
03:07:01,950 --> 03:07:04,150
Never seen this big game before, but man, it's so fun.

4357
03:07:04,230 --> 03:07:05,090
Can't wait to see where this goes.

4358
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:05,890
Thanks, AKS!

4359
03:07:06,370 --> 03:07:07,010
Thank you!

4360
03:07:09,450 --> 03:07:09,890
Vegetables?

4361
03:07:09,890 --> 03:07:10,870
It means vegetables.

4362
03:07:12,730 --> 03:07:13,670
Eat your...

4363
03:07:13,670 --> 03:07:14,890
Eat your...

4364
03:07:14,890 --> 03:07:15,230
Uh...

4365
03:07:15,750 --> 03:07:16,490
Eat your...

4366
03:07:17,230 --> 03:07:18,190
Gronsakers, everybody.

4367
03:07:19,990 --> 03:07:21,170
Collab's gonna be so much fun.

4368
03:07:21,270 --> 03:07:21,430
Yeah!

4369
03:07:21,470 --> 03:07:22,190
I'm so excited!

4370
03:07:22,490 --> 03:07:22,950
So...

4371
03:07:22,950 --> 03:07:23,530
Mmm!

4372
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:25,110
Um...

4373
03:07:25,670 --> 03:07:25,950
Yes.

4374
03:07:26,470 --> 03:07:27,030
Uh...

4375
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:28,810
Thank you guys for hanging out with me today!

4376
03:07:29,050 --> 03:07:30,330
Thank you so much!

4377
03:07:30,530 --> 03:07:31,250
Merlin, thank you!

4378
03:07:31,350 --> 03:07:32,650
Thanks for the ghostly trickiest stream!

4379
03:07:32,930 --> 03:07:34,610
Just curious, since you're a ghost...

4380
03:07:34,610 --> 03:07:36,810
If you have any famous ghost role models like...

4381
03:07:36,810 --> 03:07:38,270
Casper, Beetlejuice...

4382
03:07:38,270 --> 03:07:39,870
Yuyuko Saikyo...

4383
03:07:40,250 --> 03:07:40,610
Koji...

4384
03:07:42,770 --> 03:07:43,130
Um...

4385
03:07:43,130 --> 03:07:45,570
To be fair, Ace Combat 7 is also on sale.

4386
03:07:45,710 --> 03:07:49,250
I think a lot of games are on sale right now because of Golden Week, so...

4387
03:07:49,250 --> 03:07:50,890
Might wanna grab some stuff.

4388
03:07:51,010 --> 03:07:52,810
Japanese games in particular, you know?

4389
03:07:52,890 --> 03:07:53,970
I really enjoyed the stream today.

4390
03:07:54,570 --> 03:07:55,290
Thanks, AKS!

4391
03:07:55,670 --> 03:07:56,270
Thank you!

4392
03:07:56,510 --> 03:07:58,350
Sorry, is it okay if I shorten your name to that?

4393
03:07:58,530 --> 03:07:59,090
Or should I...

4394
03:08:00,410 --> 03:08:00,990
Should I...

4395
03:08:00,990 --> 03:08:03,070
Should I keep saying the full name, you know?

4396
03:08:11,310 --> 03:08:11,670
Um...

4397
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:12,190
Um...

4398
03:08:14,840 --> 03:08:15,200
Um...

4399
03:08:15,200 --> 03:08:15,820
Yeah.

4400
03:08:20,540 --> 03:08:20,980
Yeah.

4401
03:08:22,100 --> 03:08:22,540
Uh...

4402
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:25,620
At least call him Mike Dyson.

4403
03:08:35,370 --> 03:08:35,810
Um...

4404
03:08:36,690 --> 03:08:39,150
I feel like I was gonna say something else, but I can't remember.

4405
03:08:39,530 --> 03:08:40,930
Oh, tomorrow I have...

4406
03:08:40,930 --> 03:08:42,070
But yeah, tomorrow I have the collab.

4407
03:08:42,170 --> 03:08:43,990
And then Saturday, I have a, um...

4408
03:08:43,990 --> 03:08:45,470
I'm part of a, um...

4409
03:08:45,470 --> 03:08:46,990
A karaoke relay...

4410
03:08:46,990 --> 03:08:47,630
Um...

4411
03:08:47,630 --> 03:08:48,910
With a bunch of other VTubers.

4412
03:08:49,310 --> 03:08:49,750
So...

4413
03:08:49,750 --> 03:08:51,750
The waiting rooms for both streams are already up.

4414
03:08:51,810 --> 03:08:52,230
So...

4415
03:08:52,230 --> 03:08:52,890
Um...

4416
03:08:53,350 --> 03:08:53,790
Yes...

4417
03:08:54,770 --> 03:08:55,210
I'm...

4418
03:08:55,650 --> 03:08:56,050
Yes...

4419
03:08:56,830 --> 03:08:57,230
Ah...

4420
03:08:57,770 --> 03:09:03,230
After hearing about you wanting to be a marine biologist and liking sea conservation from the podcast, I want to recommend the Aqua Taupe on White Sand.

4421
03:09:03,350 --> 03:09:04,810
I've seen Aqua Taupe!

4422
03:09:05,690 --> 03:09:06,790
I've seen Aqua Taupe!

4423
03:09:06,850 --> 03:09:08,590
And actually, the opening is done by my...

4424
03:09:08,590 --> 03:09:10,550
One of my favorite idol groups, Arcana Project.

4425
03:09:11,470 --> 03:09:11,870
Yeah...

4426
03:09:11,870 --> 03:09:13,750
I didn't think I'd be able to continue my membership.

4427
03:09:14,030 --> 03:09:15,010
Oh, thanks, Shady Raven!

4428
03:09:15,190 --> 03:09:15,810
Thank you!

4429
03:09:16,130 --> 03:09:16,850
Appreciate it.

4430
03:09:18,110 --> 03:09:20,490
Japanese games on sale, but no Nekopara on sale.

4431
03:09:23,690 --> 03:09:24,350
That's cool!

4432
03:09:24,790 --> 03:09:25,190
That's cool!

4433
03:09:25,210 --> 03:09:25,650
Hi, man!

4434
03:09:25,770 --> 03:09:30,050
I got my wisdom teeth taken out this morning, and after I woke up, I just rambled on about how much I love you.

4435
03:09:30,130 --> 03:09:30,630
I know!

4436
03:09:31,530 --> 03:09:33,110
I got a video of it!

4437
03:09:39,870 --> 03:09:40,670
Thank you.

4438
03:09:40,690 --> 03:09:41,530
I love you too.

4439
03:09:41,970 --> 03:09:42,370
Mwah!

4440
03:09:46,850 --> 03:09:47,830
That's so strong.

4441
03:09:48,590 --> 03:09:49,590
That's so awesome.

4442
03:09:51,970 --> 03:09:53,070
It's all on video!

4443
03:09:53,310 --> 03:09:54,370
I watched it!

4444
03:09:55,210 --> 03:09:56,190
Like, three times!

4445
03:09:57,570 --> 03:10:00,250
Your voiceover work for the characters was so on point.

4446
03:10:00,350 --> 03:10:01,610
It was a ton of fun watching you play.

4447
03:10:01,790 --> 03:10:02,670
Thank you so much!

4448
03:10:02,810 --> 03:10:04,690
I love doing voices in games like this.

4449
03:10:04,830 --> 03:10:06,990
But it does make me tired out a little bit more.

4450
03:10:07,250 --> 03:10:08,470
But I do...

4451
03:10:08,470 --> 03:10:18,690
I've been taking a lot of throat medicine lately, and I do feel like my throat has been healing, so I'm very, very relieved.

4452
03:10:18,730 --> 03:10:20,050
I'm very happy about that.

4453
03:10:20,190 --> 03:10:22,190
But I take it like three times a day.

4454
03:10:22,530 --> 03:10:24,950
It's like a Chinese herbal medicine thing, so...

4455
03:10:25,510 --> 03:10:26,510
That a lot of...

4456
03:10:27,190 --> 03:10:27,590
First...

4457
03:10:27,590 --> 03:10:30,370
Actually, it was Ayami-sensei that gifted it to me.

4458
03:10:32,310 --> 03:10:32,710
And...

4459
03:10:33,330 --> 03:10:34,370
So I tried it...

4460
03:10:35,370 --> 03:10:38,190
When she gifted it to me first, and then I ordered some more.

4461
03:10:38,410 --> 03:10:38,750
So...

4462
03:10:38,750 --> 03:10:39,410
Yeah!

4463
03:10:39,970 --> 03:10:40,670
I'm so...

4464
03:10:40,670 --> 03:10:41,170
I'm so...

4465
03:10:41,170 --> 03:10:41,910
I'm so relieved.

4466
03:10:44,830 --> 03:10:45,930
Three times a day?

4467
03:10:46,010 --> 03:10:46,390
So much.

4468
03:10:46,530 --> 03:10:46,670
I...

4469
03:10:46,670 --> 03:10:48,290
I take it...

4470
03:10:48,290 --> 03:10:52,130
I take it in the morning, and then I take it before stream, and then I take it after stream.

4471
03:10:52,770 --> 03:10:53,170
So...

4472
03:10:53,170 --> 03:10:53,510
Um...

4473
03:10:53,510 --> 03:10:54,550
Is it...

4474
03:10:55,350 --> 03:10:55,890
Yes!

4475
03:10:56,190 --> 03:10:56,410
Yes!

4476
03:10:56,510 --> 03:10:56,650
Yes!

4477
03:10:56,930 --> 03:10:57,470
Yes!

4478
03:10:57,610 --> 03:10:57,770
Yes!

4479
03:10:59,070 --> 03:11:00,150
Koa, kao...

4480
03:11:00,150 --> 03:11:00,690
Koa, koa...

4481
03:11:00,690 --> 03:11:02,130
It is that!

4482
03:11:02,370 --> 03:11:03,630
It's so great!

4483
03:11:03,910 --> 03:11:05,390
It works so well!

4484
03:11:05,410 --> 03:11:06,350
My, my cute!

4485
03:11:08,250 --> 03:11:09,330
You're so cute!

4486
03:11:09,550 --> 03:11:10,390
Oh my gosh...

4487
03:11:11,530 --> 03:11:13,310
But yeah, it's super duper.

4488
03:11:13,490 --> 03:11:14,890
It is the good stuff.

4489
03:11:15,110 --> 03:11:16,530
It seriously works so well.

4490
03:11:17,470 --> 03:11:18,970
We love Ayami.

4491
03:11:19,130 --> 03:11:19,610
I know!

4492
03:11:19,710 --> 03:11:21,030
I love her so much!

4493
03:11:21,230 --> 03:11:22,430
She has the most amazing smile.

4494
03:11:22,430 --> 03:11:22,770
She has the most amazing smile in the world.

4495
03:11:22,770 --> 03:11:23,150
The smile is...

4496
03:11:26,610 --> 03:11:27,790
It's actually really delicious.

4497
03:11:27,930 --> 03:11:28,270
It is!

4498
03:11:28,550 --> 03:11:30,130
It's delicious and it works.

4499
03:11:31,570 --> 03:11:33,750
They have bubble tea flavors with it in Asia?

4500
03:11:33,850 --> 03:11:34,190
Seriously?

4501
03:11:35,870 --> 03:11:36,870
It's very reliable.

4502
03:11:36,970 --> 03:11:38,050
You can even make it a tea.

4503
03:11:38,210 --> 03:11:38,630
Yeah!

4504
03:11:38,870 --> 03:11:39,930
I have seen that.

4505
03:11:39,990 --> 03:11:41,130
But I just take it by the spoonful.

4506
03:11:41,950 --> 03:11:44,130
But it has been helping so much.

4507
03:11:44,390 --> 03:11:46,970
So I'm very very grateful that she introduced it to me.

4508
03:11:48,230 --> 03:11:49,270
She's going to Chicago.

4509
03:11:49,350 --> 03:11:49,730
I know!

4510
03:11:49,970 --> 03:11:51,450
I'm so happy for her!

4511
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:54,170
I think it's her first time going to a convention.

4512
03:11:58,590 --> 03:12:00,470
In Singapore we got the bubble tea with it.

4513
03:12:00,490 --> 03:12:00,670
Really?

4514
03:12:01,270 --> 03:12:02,530
Maybe I can import it.

4515
03:12:03,390 --> 03:12:03,790
Maybe.

4516
03:12:04,490 --> 03:12:05,090
But yeah.

4517
03:12:05,210 --> 03:12:05,610
Anyways.

4518
03:12:07,310 --> 03:12:11,070
I'm feeling good about that because I was so worried about my throat for a while.

4519
03:12:11,850 --> 03:12:13,030
But it's been helping!

4520
03:12:16,750 --> 03:12:18,530
You're so close to 200k.

4521
03:12:18,590 --> 03:12:18,970
I know!

4522
03:12:19,530 --> 03:12:19,930
Wait.

4523
03:12:20,010 --> 03:12:21,010
Where am I at?

4524
03:12:21,090 --> 03:12:21,430
I don't even know.

4525
03:12:21,450 --> 03:12:22,990
I think I'm still at...

4526
03:12:24,390 --> 03:12:25,030
Wait.

4527
03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:26,710
I was at...

4528
03:12:28,250 --> 03:12:28,890
190...

4529
03:12:30,650 --> 03:12:31,290
197!

4530
03:12:35,450 --> 03:12:36,090
Close.

4531
03:12:39,610 --> 03:12:40,250
Close.

4532
03:12:42,290 --> 03:12:42,930
197!

4533
03:12:45,710 --> 03:12:46,530
We'll see.

4534
03:12:48,490 --> 03:12:49,350
We'll see.

4535
03:12:49,410 --> 03:12:49,590
We'll see.

4536
03:12:49,770 --> 03:12:50,630
So close.

4537
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:50,890
Woo!

4538
03:12:53,030 --> 03:12:53,470
Woohoo!

4539
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:55,270
Anyways.

4540
03:12:55,270 --> 03:12:56,130
Ansumito, everybody!

4541
03:12:56,370 --> 03:12:57,750
I'm going to go sleep now.

4542
03:12:58,470 --> 03:13:00,750
I'm actually going to finish my dinner and then I'm going to sleep.

4543
03:13:02,490 --> 03:13:04,650
And I'll see you guys tomorrow for the collab.

4544
03:13:05,350 --> 03:13:06,730
And Saturday for karaoke.

4545
03:13:07,230 --> 03:13:08,110
And Sunday.

4546
03:13:08,970 --> 03:13:10,590
And I don't think I'm streaming one day.

4547
03:13:12,630 --> 03:13:13,950
I don't think I'm streaming one day.

4548
03:13:14,830 --> 03:13:17,590
I'll actually have a schedule for next week since it's...

4549
03:13:17,590 --> 03:13:18,430
Oh wait.

4550
03:13:18,850 --> 03:13:20,030
When is Matara coming?

4551
03:13:22,670 --> 03:13:23,030
No.

4552
03:13:23,130 --> 03:13:23,350
Wait.

4553
03:13:23,450 --> 03:13:25,130
Actually, I don't think Matara is coming anymore.

4554
03:13:27,250 --> 03:13:27,950
I don't know.

4555
03:13:28,050 --> 03:13:28,730
I'm going to ask her.

4556
03:13:28,890 --> 03:13:29,210
Anyway.

4557
03:13:29,610 --> 03:13:29,970
Ansumito!

4558
03:13:32,770 --> 03:13:33,130
Ansumito!

4559
03:13:33,450 --> 03:13:34,070
Bye bye!

4560
03:13:34,250 --> 03:13:34,750
Bye bye!

4561
03:13:34,770 --> 03:13:35,230
Thank you guys!

4562
03:13:35,470 --> 03:13:38,190
We'll play more ghost trick in a couple of days.

4563
03:13:38,550 --> 03:13:38,910
Yeah.

4564
03:13:38,970 --> 03:13:39,090
Yeah.

4565
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:39,490
Next week.

4566
03:13:39,530 --> 03:13:39,790
Next week.

4567
03:13:40,030 --> 03:13:42,810
I might even do like a couple of ghost tricks in a row or something.

4568
03:13:43,010 --> 03:13:44,590
Because I'm having a lot of fun with it.

4569
03:13:44,730 --> 03:13:44,970
So...

4570
03:13:45,450 --> 03:13:45,810
Ansumito!

4571
03:13:45,810 --> 03:13:48,770
But I do kind of need to rest my voice because it's a lot of talking.

4572
03:13:49,130 --> 03:13:49,950
We'll figure it out.

4573
03:13:49,950 --> 03:13:50,470
Okay.

4574
03:13:50,590 --> 03:13:51,390
Bye bye!

4575
03:13:51,490 --> 03:13:52,110
Bye bye!

4576
03:13:52,250 --> 03:13:53,010
Have a good night!

4577
03:13:53,290 --> 03:13:53,850
Have a good night!

4578
03:13:54,130 --> 03:13:56,090
Or, if it's morning, have a good day!

4579
03:13:56,850 --> 03:13:57,330
Ansumito!

4580
03:13:57,530 --> 03:13:58,350
Have a good day!

4581
03:13:58,750 --> 03:13:59,370
Bye bye!

4582
03:13:59,710 --> 03:14:00,290
Bye bye!

4583
03:14:01,170 --> 03:14:01,650
Ansumentos!

4584
03:14:02,690 --> 03:14:03,550
Thank you!

4585
03:14:03,810 --> 03:14:04,470
Bye bye!
