1
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,740
Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot...

2
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,760
Transformers.

3
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,960
Okaerinasaimase!

4
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,840
Goshujinjamou!

5
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,480
Jijjamou!

6
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,260
Hello, everybody!

7
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,740
Hello, it is I.

8
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,320
Mint Franto.

9
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,380
And we're back with Transformers Devastation.

10
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,440
Hey!

11
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Minky in disguise.

12
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,740
Hey, yeah!

13
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,240
It's a bit of an early stream for me today.

14
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,780
If it's Friday for you, happy Friday.

15
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,360
If it's Saturday for you, happy Saturday.

16
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,240
If it's Thursday for you...

17
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,120
Anyway...

18
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,420
Anyway...

19
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,880
We're gonna get into it.

20
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,600
It's my birthday tomorrow!

21
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,560
Can I get a happy early birthday from my favorite freaky ghost?

22
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Since you're not streaming tomorrow.

23
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,300
Actually...

24
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,240
Actually...

25
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,280
Actually...

26
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,140
Actually...

27
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,040
I am doing a double stream tomorrow!

28
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,620
Actually, I got asked to...

29
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,620
I was gonna do a...

30
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,080
A membership stream tomorrow.

31
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,560
So I could have one before I went to Japan.

32
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,380
But then...

33
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,820
I also got asked for a sponsored stream.

34
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,080
Like, last minute.

35
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,920
Finalized this morning.

36
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,280
Actually, it's not even final finalized.

37
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,660
But...

38
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,100
Yeah!

39
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,900
So...

40
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,120
I will have that...

41
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah.

42
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,220
Release webis and time travelers.

43
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,700
Yeah.

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,980
I got sponsored.

45
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,700
I don't think I can say...

46
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,200
Just what exactly yet.

47
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,360
But I think it's pretty darn cool.

48
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,660
So...

49
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,820
Meetup twice in one day!

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,460
Yippee!

51
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,420
Oh my gosh, eating Toki bird's ass!

52
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,360
Look at that!

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,540
I'm back!

54
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,740
Thank you for the super chat!

55
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,800
Thanks last time too!

56
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,180
Rasta Monster, welcome to membership!

57
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,240
Blue Viking, welcome back!

58
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,220
Vtuber Lurker on site.

59
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,420
Lurker.

60
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm such a lurker.

61
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't talk in chats.

62
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,140
So I'm just like...

63
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,220
I don't know, if everybody were like me...

64
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,780
What would I even talk about?

65
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,040
I guess I would yap to myself.

66
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,220
But anyway, Raymac...

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,220
I guess I could...

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Do you want me to wait?

69
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,220
For tomorrow, or...

70
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,680
Lurker here, it's true.

71
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:17,940
Lurker!

72
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
Domingo, thanks for 10 months!

73
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,620
Fixy, thanks for 9 months!

74
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,300
But...

75
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:30,940
Yeah.

76
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,400
Sorry, I got all distracted.

77
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,860
I got all distracted.

78
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,960
But...

79
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,140
We're here.

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,620
Transformers Devastation.

81
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,580
I don't wanna yap too much, because I wanna be like...

82
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,600
Are you gonna do birthday songs during sponsored streams?

83
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
No, but...

84
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,520
Like I said, I'm doing a double stream.

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,560
So...

86
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm double streaming.

87
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,390
God, I said your birthday don't know again.

88
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,890
Yeah, great!

89
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,010
Thank you for the 500, thank you!

90
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,750
Santina, welcome back!

91
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,510
Take care of your voice.

92
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,910
Yeah, but I'm gonna be gone for a week, so...

93
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,630
I figured I should...

94
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,890
I should...

95
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,210
Well, a little bit over a week.

96
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,890
So I was like, I should...

97
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,750
I should not take a break.

98
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,950
I should not take a break.

99
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,010
Thanks for the 500!

100
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,050
Mimi, thanks for one month!

101
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,330
Here are some canonical transformers.

102
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,610
Erector.

103
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,630
Who nearly won an official fan vote for the hall of fame.

104
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,230
Dickbot, the blender guy.

105
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,470
And the breastforced breastformers.

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,010
I'm looking these guys up.

107
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,550
Every single one of them right now.

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,410
Hold on.

109
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,290
This is big news.

110
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,550
This is the big, big news.

111
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,010
Wait.

112
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,530
Erector.

113
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,190
Transformers.

114
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,430
Oh, wait.

115
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,070
No.

116
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,550
That's not what he actually...

117
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,010
Wait.

118
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,090
Wait.

119
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,290
No.

120
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,230
And then, Dickbot.

121
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,730
The blender guy.

122
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:34,850
Whoops.

123
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,750
I spelled that all wrong.

124
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,430
Dickbot.

125
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,350
What the hell?

126
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,970
This guy is insane looking.

127
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,170
Oh my god.

128
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,190
Why...

129
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,490
Ew, I'm getting like other things.

130
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,910
Okay, I don't wanna...

131
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,130
Scroll in Google too long.

132
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,870
And then, breast...

133
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,670
Force...

134
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,710
Where are the...

135
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,350
Where are they?

136
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,060
Thank you.

137
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,540
Current HasLab campaign.

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,460
They combined them two.

139
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,160
Those are words I don't know.

140
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,520
Breastforce Doka.

141
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Breastforce Doka.

142
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,820
Breastforce Coco.

143
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,680
Aoi Mori, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

144
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,560
Take a break from watching your vibes for hours to be here.

145
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,100
This better be freaky.

146
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,180
I mean, we are talking about breastforce right now.

147
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,860
I mean...

148
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,640
Breast...

149
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,860
Breast...

150
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,160
Wait, what was it called?

151
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,540
Breastforce...

152
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,720
Breastformers.

153
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,800
Hi Mint.

154
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Hello Imanol.

155
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,880
Ally, welcome to membership.

156
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,980
Thank you.

157
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,100
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

158
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,240
Okay.

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Shall we play?

160
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,920
I can't...

161
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Get over how cool Optimus Prime sounds.

162
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
He's just such a...

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,160
He's just got such an iconic voice.

164
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,260
It's...

165
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,780
It's just the voice that I always want to hear all the time.

166
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,860
Like, I want...

167
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,200
I want...

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,100
I want...

169
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,900
I want Peter Cullen to narrate novels so I can fall asleep to them.

170
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,820
Hello Minta, I'm 28 since yesterday.

171
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,700
Old oof.

172
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,540
Old oof!

173
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,140
Happy birthday, Angel!

174
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,120
Happy birthday to you.

175
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,220
Happy birthday to you.

176
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,120
Happy birthday, dear Angel Gill.

177
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,980
Happy birthday to you.

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,720
Happy birthday!

179
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,800
Thanks for the gifted.

180
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,140
The breastforce can have their breastplates attached to form animal drones.

181
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,820
For their new figures this year, Hasbro called them the chestforce.

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,680
What?

183
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,200
What?

184
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,280
Why?

185
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
I mean, does it make it that much better?

186
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
Alright, I'm gonna have to remember how to play this game.

187
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,760
So, let's continue.

188
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,400
And we're gonna go, go, go, baby, until there is no more to go.

189
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,800
Until we're all done.

190
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,730
What's the plan, Optimus?

191
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,810
Bimbobee!

192
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,310
Bimbobee!

193
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,930
He's so cute!

194
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,870
First time chatter.

195
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,070
This game is quite literally labeled pink.

196
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,750
Thanks for the superchat.

197
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,910
Decepti-creep.

198
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,990
Split up and find a Decepticon.

199
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,930
Okay, a single Decepticon.

200
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:21,990
Oh my gosh.

201
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,090
Okay, we're finding...

202
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,470
Find a Decepticon.

203
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,630
That's right, we went into here.

204
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,990
And it was like kind of insane.

205
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,090
And like there was...

206
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,730
Okay, alright, it's like this.

207
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,210
Nope, this.

208
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,230
Open up.

209
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,290
There we go.

210
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,790
And here.

211
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,050
Nice.

212
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,450
Drill Nuts from Japanese Beast War.

213
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,470
Thank you guys for all the superchats!

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,930
The Breast Force's leader is called Deathsaurus.

215
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,810
He's a big metal chicken monster.

216
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,630
Boobs.

217
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,790
Gobots.

218
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,670
No.

219
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,770
Alright, hold on.

220
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,150
This is how to aim.

221
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,250
And I think R1 is to shoot, but I don't want to waste energy.

222
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,410
And then we can switch stuff.

223
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,210
We'll do our drills, Devastator's Drills.

224
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,610
And then this is Heavy Attack.

225
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,950
And this is Light Attack, Jump.

226
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,390
What was Circle?

227
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,670
What was Circle?

228
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,290
I don't remember.

229
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,810
I guess we'll figure it out.

230
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,650
And thank you Joshua for the dono.

231
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,210
Did you hear about the new horror film that came out today called The Monkey?

232
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,990
Oh my gosh, I haven't stopped seeing trailers for it, to be honest.

233
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,450
It's based off a Stephen King novel, but I don't know the novel at all.

234
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,890
Oh, Circle is...

235
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,070
And then we can...

236
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,290
Throw!

237
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,750
Throw!

238
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,350
Wait!

239
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,350
That actually worked.

240
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,510
Hold on.

241
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,590
If we get more cars...

242
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,930
And lift...

243
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,670
And throw...

244
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,510
At these things...

245
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,230
Just kidding.

246
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,030
I can't aim.

247
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,230
It's fine.

248
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,530
We can run through this.

249
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,150
Easy peasy.

250
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,310
We're gonna go find...

251
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,870
A Decepticon.

252
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,840
There's one.

253
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,860
Hot dog.

254
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,720
Hot dog indeed.

255
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,140
Mintotron.

256
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
I met you at Vexpo last year.

257
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,400
The guy from Iceland.

258
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah, I remember!

259
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,220
I said you were probably my only fan from Iceland.

260
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,260
I was originally there for a Transformers convention that was happening at the same time.

261
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,700
It's awesome that you're playing this game.

262
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Shut up!

263
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,920
Yeah!

264
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,060
Wait.

265
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,940
Sorry.

266
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,940
Oh gosh, I don't want to waste my...

267
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,160
Wait, who am I hearing?

268
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,860
Oh, you!

269
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,860
Oh my gosh.

270
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,400
Pick up!

271
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,320
Pick up!

272
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:22,860
Pick up!

273
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,620
Come here!

274
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,120
Pick up!

275
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,360
Pick up!

276
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,520
Pick up!

277
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,780
Pick up!

278
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,260
Pick up!

279
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,860
Okay, I got him.

280
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,300
We're fine.

281
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,860
Probably.

282
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:39,920
Probably.

283
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,000
Down.

284
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,740
Wait, am I supposed to talk?

285
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,580
I found a Decepticon.

286
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,430
That scared me.

287
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,170
That's my money.

288
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,290
My money!

289
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,950
Wait, my money!

290
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:07,970
My money!

291
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,950
Okay.

292
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,410
Ouch.

293
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,090
Ouchy ouch.

294
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,390
We can just run through here, right?

295
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,270
We don't have to be so badass and cool all the time.

296
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,150
Okay, nice.

297
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,450
Proud star.

298
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,150
Information.

299
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,290
This thing...

300
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,350
Oh my gosh.

301
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,430
What?

302
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,750
Oh, dang it.

303
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,770
We killed his ass.

304
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,570
We got it.

305
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,850
Stupid baby is dead.

306
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,030
Shoot those laser things too.

307
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,290
Also, in your inventory you probably have some capsules that give permanent stat boost.

308
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,530
Oh, I do?

309
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,910
Oh, there's this thing.

310
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,510
Nice.

311
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,050
Hold on, it's gonna take me like a little second to get back used to the game, guys.

312
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,930
So, sorry if I'm a little stupid for a minute.

313
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:12,630
Wait.

314
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,790
No!

315
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:16,990
Oh shoot.

316
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,870
Kill, kill, kill!

317
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,710
Alright.

318
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,530
Kill, kill, kill!

319
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,150
Dang it.

320
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,430
Alright.

321
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,190
This is the claw, man.

322
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,570
Oh shoot.

323
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:34,950
Yeah!

324
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,610
Alright, number two down.

325
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,170
Oh my gosh.

326
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,430
This is just absolute chaos here.

327
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,390
It's just absolute...

328
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:45,630
Oops.

329
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,250
My auto-aim.

330
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,800
Oh, I thought we were gonna aim onto this guy.

331
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,500
Yeah!

332
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,060
This guy!

333
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,640
Yeah!

334
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,520
This guy!

335
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah!

336
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,300
Yeah!

337
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,540
I wonder if they ever stop coming.

338
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
Stop coming and I don't stop coming and I don't stop coming.

339
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,840
Collect my loot and my...

340
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,690
Alright, come here, come here.

341
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,450
Take that.

342
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,790
Deceptiscum.

343
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,790
This was a thing we did before.

344
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,390
These were the generators.

345
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,570
Generators.

346
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,690
Don't call it a fart attack!

347
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,950
That's much more sophisticated.

348
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:46,830
No?

349
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,950
Nice.

350
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:00,690
And...

351
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,290
Oh, no, no.

352
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,890
Okay.

353
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,990
I will.

354
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,830
I'll get him.

355
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,750
Don't worry about it.

356
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,750
Catch Thundercracker.

357
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,410
Tell you the location of the core.

358
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,010
Okay.

359
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,110
Hey buddy!

360
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,510
What was that?

361
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,510
Oops.

362
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,330
Wait, hold on.

363
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,450
Hold on, let me redo.

364
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,530
Redo, redo.

365
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,110
Where did he go anyway?

366
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,560
Thundercracker!

367
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,660
Where'd he go?

368
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,160
Where am I going?

369
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,380
I lost you.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,400
I need your location, please.

371
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,160
Thundercracker, hold on.

372
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,840
I'm farming.

373
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,480
I'm looting.

374
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,940
Thank you.

375
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,440
Where's your location?

376
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,120
Oh, wait.

377
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,410
Oh, there's something over there.

378
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,550
Let's go check it out.

379
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,540
Oh, my gosh.

380
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,900
Thank you guys for all the superchats.

381
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,420
Oh, my gosh.

382
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,840
It's so hard to read them though.

383
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,880
You guys!

384
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,860
Thank you!

385
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,320
But it's so hard to read while I'm playing.

386
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:52,240
Remember that in the IDW comics, Thundercracker is a Hollywood screenwriter and he has a dog named Buster.

387
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,800
What?

388
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,520
If you want others...

389
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,440
Oh, yeah, everybody...

390
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,860
Oh, my gosh.

391
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,600
I've got a bajillion comments about the war for Cybertron.

392
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,040
So, let's see about playing it.

393
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
What the...

394
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,580
Maybe nothing here.

395
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,060
Did I get it already?

396
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,060
Weird.

397
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,180
Okay, I'm lost.

398
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,060
Thank you for the superchats!

399
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Okay, maybe...

400
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,130
Where do I go?

401
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,350
Okay, this looks like the track.

402
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:38,930
Okay.

403
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,110
Alright, we're back in business, baby.

404
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,750
We're back in business.

405
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,230
Alright, Thundercracker, don't go.

406
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:49,970
Thundercracker.

407
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,490
We gotta find Thundercracker.

408
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,490
We gotta get him to spill his secrets, spill his guts to us.

409
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:57,830
What?

410
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,690
This is a dead end.

411
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,230
This way.

412
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,980
Oh, wait, how do I...

413
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,160
How do I destroy this again?

414
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,900
Uh...

415
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,800
How do I destroy this thing again?

416
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,440
Was it through the car?

417
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,380
It says it's Thundercracker's birthday.

418
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,310
How do I get to him?

419
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,810
Where the heck is this guy?

420
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,470
Oh my god, dead end.

421
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,110
Car mode into attack.

422
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,730
Okay, okay.

423
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,290
Right now though, we have another goal.

424
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,530
Sick!

425
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,300
There he is!

426
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,380
No, he's not!

427
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,580
Where the hell?

428
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,740
Oh my god, there he is!

429
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Son of a bitch.

430
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,680
Where did he go?

431
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,660
This way.

432
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,000
Sick flip, bro.

433
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,100
Yeah, get his ass!

434
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,600
Where is he?

435
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,060
Uh, he's somewhere.

436
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,460
He's...

437
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,080
Over...

438
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,620
I'm running in...

439
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,320
Over here?

440
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,600
I got him, I got him.

441
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,260
Yeah!

442
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
He scared the hell out of me.

443
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,560
Thundercracker!

444
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,880
I got an A on that, by the way.

445
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,240
You can't just say that, Bumblebee!

446
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,220
You can't just call him that!

447
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Oh my gosh.

448
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Liberty Bridge.

449
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,440
Thank you for the...10 Captain!

450
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,300
Thank you!

451
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,700
Alright.

452
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
Plasma Core.

453
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,280
This game is so wild.

454
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm not seeing anything.

455
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,200
Wait, am I going the wrong way?

456
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,040
Hello?

457
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,040
No, it has to be this way.

458
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,800
Right?

459
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,960
Oh yeah, it's gotta be that way.

460
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,340
Alright.

461
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,220
Sorry for everybody's cars!

462
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,620
I hope you have insurance!

463
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,340
Wait!

464
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,680
Here!

465
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,500
Yellow dot.

466
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,860
I know, I'm just...

467
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,580
Directionally...

468
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,910
You know...

469
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,560
Something.

470
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,380
Thunder Honkey.

471
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,440
Thundercracker is usually a Decepticon sympathetic to humans.

472
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,460
Questioning his loyalties.

473
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:31,280
Also, his final appearance in IDW has him attending the Oscars as a nominee for his film about G.I.

474
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Joe!

475
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,140
Why does he question his loyalty?

476
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,060
Nice!

477
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,560
Nice!

478
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,320
I think we're good.

479
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,020
Yeah.

480
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,260
Alright.

481
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:51,980
Anything...

482
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,260
Oh, there's more down here!

483
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,600
Trying to get all the good loot and all.

484
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,660
If they're guarded, surely they're better.

485
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,120
Okay, hold on.

486
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,660
Oh!

487
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,520
I can do it!

488
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,560
Yeah!

489
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,240
Yeah!

490
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
I can do it!

491
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,820
I can do it!

492
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:10,940
No!

493
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,240
Got it!

494
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,560
Okay.

495
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,220
Oh wait, I still need this.

496
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,440
Okay.

497
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:14,980
We're going!

498
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,340
We're going!

499
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,140
You may need vehicle insurance.

500
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,420
No!

501
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,320
Oh!

502
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:19,800
Woo!

503
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,560
Oh!

504
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,180
Oh!

505
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,680
Oh!

506
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,280
Oh!

507
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,720
Oh!

508
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,600
Oh!

509
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,420
Hello!

510
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:26,960
Did I kill everybody?

511
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I think I did.

512
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,920
My money!

513
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,600
Road Rage.

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,300
If you have Road Rage, you should play this game.

515
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,920
Because...

516
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,160
Honestly...

517
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,820
It feels good to just drive into everything.

518
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,220
It feels good.

519
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,220
I'm not gonna lie.

520
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,980
How am I supposed to get this one?

521
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,660
Maybe.

522
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,220
Hold on.

523
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Sorry for being loot goblin!

524
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,080
Yeah!

525
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,140
Yeah!

526
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,080
Alright.

527
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,840
Nice.

528
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
This way.

529
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,980
Oh shit!

530
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,750
I can't see anything.

531
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,570
But I know I'm doing everything.

532
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,890
Oh my god!

533
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,890
How do you expect me to make that jump?

534
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,390
Wait, hold on.

535
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,070
We can do this.

536
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,610
We can do this.

537
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,270
We can do this.

538
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,190
Hi Bob!

539
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,330
Oh, it's been a while.

540
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,230
Hey!

541
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,590
Hi buddy.

542
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:44,710
Wait!

543
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:46,850
I went the wrong way.

544
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,980
Do Transformers get car insurance or life insurance?

545
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,240
Well, like...

546
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,400
How do they get tired and stuff?

547
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,360
Like when they're fighting...

548
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,360
When they're fighting and they get tired...

549
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,640
Why?

550
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,960
What is your battery low?

551
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,460
Oh come on.

552
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,300
I literally missed every single one.

553
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,280
I missed all of them!

554
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,960
They eat Energon.

555
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,240
Oh, they gotta eat the Energon.

556
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,080
Oh, that's right.

557
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,330
So close.

558
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,590
Okay, I give up.

559
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,070
Alright, let's keep going.

560
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,750
But before...

561
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,210
We do that.

562
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,870
We're gonna enter in here.

563
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,130
Wait.

564
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,170
Someone said...

565
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,750
How do I know in my items if I have...

566
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,190
If I have permanent upgrade stuff?

567
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,910
What would it be?

568
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,010
Temporarily, temporarily, temporarily, temporarily...

569
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,050
Raises speed by one?

570
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,490
Raises endurance by one.

571
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,410
What's wrong with my intelligence?

572
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,290
Ah?

573
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,470
Enhance.

574
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,630
Oh, these too?

575
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,790
Oh, these are temp though.

576
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,090
Minky low intelligence?

577
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,490
No.

578
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,650
Should we play?

579
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,640
I don't wanna...

580
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,550
Use items.

581
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,930
I kinda wanna try playing as Grimlock.

582
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,710
I'm not gonna lie.

583
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,250
I kinda wanna try playing as Grimlock.

584
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:49,670
But...

585
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,350
I wonder if he'll be too slow.

586
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,030
He's fine?

587
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,130
I imagine.

588
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,810
I believe it.

589
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,050
Did I get anything good?

590
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,310
No, everything's bad.

591
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:01,810
Okay.

592
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,850
Let's see.

593
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,630
We can give him a tech.

594
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,170
He can only have one tech.

595
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,570
And we have quite a bit.

596
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,110
Let's see.

597
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,430
Ultimate move, attack up.

598
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:23,850
You know what?

599
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,850
Let's just give him the best that we got, baby.

600
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,570
Oh, look how cute he is!

601
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,730
He's a little stumped, but that's okay.

602
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,550
Me Grimlock.

603
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,950
I could develop more tech.

604
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,350
We'll save on it though.

605
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,750
I feel like we should probably buy...

606
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,270
Some good weapons eventually.

607
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,470
Oh my gosh, 180,000!

608
00:30:59,170 --> 00:30:59,950
He's fine.

609
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,530
He's a wrestler.

610
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,150
He's dumb.

611
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,910
He's my son.

612
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,510
It's Gucci.

613
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,130
Me Grimlock.

614
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,790
Okay, ready?

615
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,690
Let's try.

616
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,650
Let's try Grimlock.

617
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,690
He's too cute!

618
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,490
When using Grimlock, dodge with perfect timing and press...

619
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,210
Oh, that's right.

620
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,330
Okay, dodge is R1, I think.

621
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,210
And press circle to grapple and toss enemies.

622
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:31,610
You can also accelerate in his dino mode by tapping circle repeatedly.

623
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,790
Alright, wait.

624
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,930
Oh, never mind.

625
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,250
We're in the cutscene.

626
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,810
Well, if I don't know Grimlock now, I'm gonna learn.

627
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,450
Ground soldier.

628
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,730
Here we go!

629
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,570
I did not... Oh, maybe I did.

630
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,470
Tap,

631
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,590
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap!

632
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,610
Tap, tap, tap!

633
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,050
Oh my god, look how fast he is!

634
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,830
This is so scary!

635
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,730
Warning?

636
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:20,850
Warning.

637
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,350
What's the warning?

638
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,130
Oh, that's the warning.

639
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:29,730
Okay.

640
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,530
Nice!

641
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,450
I didn't know how to grapple though.

642
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,270
Oh shit, okay.

643
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,770
I don't know how to grapple.

644
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,450
I don't know how to grapple.

645
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,630
Oh my god.

646
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,780
Maybe because he's too chunky?

647
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,320
Holy cow.

648
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,400
Guy is too beefy maybe.

649
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,960
There's something at the top of the bridge.

650
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,500
See that?

651
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,120
It said circle though, right?

652
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,380
Like I could circle munch them?

653
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,780
Look at him go!

654
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,200
He's zooming!

655
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,040
He's so cute!

656
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,210
I think I might have...

657
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,620
Okay.

658
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,380
L1 in robot mode.

659
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,160
Oh, L1 in ro... Okay.

660
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,240
Use Energon cubes to break through Decepticon defenses.

661
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,840
Okay.

662
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,320
Oh, why?

663
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,640
Why am I in suddenly top-down mode?

664
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,180
What the hell is this?

665
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,760
What is this?

666
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,120
Why?

667
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,140
I can't see shit.

668
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,380
I can't see anything.

669
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,500
Pick up that.

670
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,290
I got it, I think.

671
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,490
Not this way.

672
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,380
I got it?

673
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,860
This is so bizarre.

674
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:10,940
Okay.

675
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,180
We'll go get this one first, I suppose.

676
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,380
If I can see...

677
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,020
Wait, this way?

678
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:17,860
Okay.

679
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,820
Okay.

680
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,060
Back to bridge.

681
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,180
Hell yeah.

682
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,520
Oh, come on!

683
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,080
Can I throw it at them?

684
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Oh, yeah.

685
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,180
That was good.

686
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,600
I think you can't even get a single attack in.

687
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,820
Bozos.

688
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,280
Alright, I'm lifting and I'm bringing it back.

689
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm bringing it back.

690
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,480
Stupid!

691
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,160
Okay, hold on.

692
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:15,670
Shoot.

693
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,870
No, hold on.

694
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,530
I gotta tap.

695
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,590
I gotta run.

696
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,330
Oh, no?

697
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,910
It's not good enough?

698
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,590
Okay, hold on.

699
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,950
I thought it would be...

700
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,270
I thought it would be good enough to, like, destroy them, you know?

701
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,850
Even that's not good enough to...

702
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,230
No!

703
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,550
Loser!

704
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,850
I'm getting hit too in the process.

705
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,890
How am I supposed to defeat these things?

706
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,560
Oh my gosh.

707
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,750
Throw!

708
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,510
Okay, that got one at least.

709
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,310
It's tricky when I can't go into this crazy card mode.

710
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,470
Alright, we're going back.

711
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,490
Okay.

712
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,550
Okay.

713
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,090
My health could be better, but we'll just make it work.

714
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,070
We got this.

715
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,090
Oh my god.

716
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,390
I have a better idea.

717
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,770
We'll bring more.

718
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,350
We'll bring lots of it, you know?

719
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,990
We don't need just one.

720
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,470
We can get more!

721
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,330
And then we'll throw them all at once.

722
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,550
Can you pick multiple up at once?

723
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,570
No, it doesn't seem to be the case.

724
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,630
Get more of them.

725
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,420
My last one disappeared!

726
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,060
This is messed up!

727
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,580
No way!

728
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,860
My genius plan thwarted!

729
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,000
Seriously?

730
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,500
Despawn.

731
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,260
Despawn.

732
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,200
Maybe go next to the five captain.

733
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,000
Thank you.

734
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,000
You didn't believe hard enough.

735
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,080
No!

736
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,140
But we do have a ult.

737
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,540
So I'm gonna see what that does.

738
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,660
First I'm gonna throw.

739
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,980
I'm gonna go get another one.

740
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,390
Nice throw.

741
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,070
Thank you.

742
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:51,570
Alright.

743
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:51,830
Yeah.

744
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,760
Now...

745
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,560
The other one should have despawned, right?

746
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,000
And now...

747
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

748
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,920
Now I can retry.

749
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,480
Throw!

750
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,770
Wow!

751
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,140
Oh my god!

752
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,780
I didn't mean to do that!

753
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
That's what L1 does.

754
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,240
It's pretty spooky.

755
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,320
Wait, can I do this one at a time?

756
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,220
Desert Trisky, thank you so much for 6 bucks.

757
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,060
Here we go!

758
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,700
OK, who's next?

759
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,640
I don't feel like doing it four more times.

760
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,460
OK, I get in close.

761
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,760
And...

762
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,450
Oh, that didn't do nearly as much as I thought it would!

763
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,410
No!

764
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,610
Oh my gosh, wait.

765
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,630
I can't get through!

766
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,130
I'm trying to jump over these guys.

767
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:33,710
Oh my gosh.

768
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,510
No, stop!

769
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,610
OK, anyway.

770
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,050
I'm doing this again.

771
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,430
Oh, ouch.

772
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,430
Take that, take that.

773
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,490
No, take this, take this.

774
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,210
Take it, take it.

775
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,910
And...

776
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,250
Hit!

777
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,470
There we go.

778
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,830
OK, I got him.

779
00:40:59,490 --> 00:40:59,930
I think.

780
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:04,800
Oh gosh.

781
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,880
What do I...

782
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,940
Crimzeek!

783
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:08,920
Crimzeek!

784
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,480
Crimzeek!

785
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,600
OK.

786
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,100
Nice swing.

787
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,320
We got it in the end.

788
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,540
It worked somehow.

789
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,800
Somehow it worked.

790
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,160
Can I transform while I'm carrying it?

791
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,400
No.

792
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,000
Get them chompers working.

793
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,960
Oh my god.

794
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,650
From top down, this is too much!

795
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:41,930
Throw!

796
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,850
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

797
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,170
I'm trying to lift it.

798
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,090
Run, run, Grimlock, run, run!

799
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,190
Throw!

800
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,410
Crimzeek!

801
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,470
Dino attack!

802
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,610
Just kidding.

803
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,930
Who's next?

804
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,350
Who wants to fight me next?

805
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,110
Why doesn't this work?

806
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,060
Oh, there he is.

807
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,740
Dino attack!

808
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,440
Just kidding.

809
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,950
Grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it.

810
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,230
Oh no, shoot.

811
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,590
Grab, grab.

812
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,470
And...

813
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:39,830
Oh shoot.

814
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,750
I didn't dodge fast enough.

815
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:55,990
Dino attack!

816
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,490
Oh my gosh, I keep pressing L1 instead because I'm a big old bozo.

817
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,070
There we go.

818
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,670
I love it when he waddles.

819
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,370
He's so cute.

820
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,270
I just don't know.

821
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,390
Maybe if I pick it up.

822
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,810
Maybe if I hit it with like this.

823
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:18,290
Really?

824
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,110
Even though this thing is so powerful?

825
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:21,870
It doesn't work?

826
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,130
Whatever.

827
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,270
Explode it.

828
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,390
Oh, you're so right.

829
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,070
I didn't even think about that.

830
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,110
I was exploding everything but the one.

831
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,040
Hi Starscream.

832
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,180
This guy is such a weasel.

833
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,380
Oh my gosh.

834
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,720
You...

835
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,740
Where is he?

836
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,640
I'm running.

837
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,740
Where are you?

838
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,340
Get his ass.

839
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,080
Oh damn.

840
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,720
He's so sneaky.

841
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,300
He's so fast.

842
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,580
Where'd he go?

843
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,620
There he is.

844
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,880
Come on.

845
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,470
I almost tried to...

846
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,630
I'm gonna need to heal soon.

847
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,550
Wait, hold on.

848
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,450
Oh wait, I heal...

849
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,270
Actually, we can always just do the fight again.

850
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,010
This restores 50% of health.

851
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,010
It's not bad.

852
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,030
Whatever, we'll just do the fight again.

853
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,850
F break for you.

854
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,710
Oh my gosh.

855
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,960
Time to die.

856
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,800
Uh oh, I'm low on...

857
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,480
Oh no, I'm getting stun locked.

858
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:00,520
Stupid...

859
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,570
I'm out.

860
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,400
Did I know it?

861
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,730
Oh my gosh.

862
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,470
What's happening?

863
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,420
I got something.

864
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,660
I got a trophy for something.

865
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,400
He's so close.

866
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,880
He's so close.

867
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,140
Where is he?

868
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,940
Come here.

869
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Come here.

870
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,940
I got him.

871
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,620
I got him!

872
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,050
Another day out of...

873
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:08,810
Look at him scratching his head.

874
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:17,790
I still think, I'm not gonna lie guys, I still think I fight better with Bumblebee.

875
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,650
I did a little doom scrolling with this stream in the background.

876
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,150
I finally get a mint clip recommended on Instagram.

877
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,330
But it's you talking about hentai and java... What?

878
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,170
Oh, sorry Grimlock.

879
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:44,290
I still think I feel most comfortable switching in and out with Bumblebee.

880
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,730
Grimlock, I'm sorry.

881
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,390
Ready, ready, ready.

882
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,290
Here we go.

883
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,790
Oh,

884
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,660
it's open.

885
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,340
Let's swing.

886
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,300
Oh my gosh.

887
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,460
Wait.

888
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,540
I'm aiming with what?

889
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,500
What was that?

890
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,200
I said F.

891
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,840
Oh my god.

892
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,520
Ouch.

893
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:47,980
Ouch.

894
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,560
I thought that was you dying.

895
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,880
I didn't think that was an attack.

896
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,420
Oh, ouchie ouch.

897
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,020
Oh god.

898
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

899
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,720
That was trap.

900
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,920
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

901
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:20,750
Strife!

902
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,290
Oh gosh, Ryo.

903
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,540
Ryo, strife.

904
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,460
I missed something glowy.

905
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,380
I'm sad about that.

906
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,460
Can you get back low again?

907
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
How do I aim?

908
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,600
Oh, there's the aim.

909
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,340
I see it now.

910
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,360
Oh gosh.

911
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,160
Oh my god.

912
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

913
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,820
You're okay buddy.

914
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,730
Oh, I can attack like that too.

915
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,890
Come on, come on, Bumblebee.

916
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,310
Oh, it's R2.

917
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,360
I'm trying to aim.

918
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,300
I'm trying to aim.

919
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,400
I'm trying to aim.

920
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,320
Aim.

921
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,440
I'm trying to aim.

922
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,120
There we go.

923
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,520
Oh my god, I ran right into him.

924
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,080
I hate this.

925
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,500
I hate sequences like this.

926
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,620
My depth perception, please.

927
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,320
I can't tell where you are at.

928
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,520
I can't tell.

929
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,360
I can't tell where I'm at.

930
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,280
I'm just gonna keep holding down.

931
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,940
Ouch, I didn't even see that.

932
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,280
There we go.

933
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,340
He's almost there.

934
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,640
We're almost there.

935
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,140
Bumblebee, you good?

936
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,300
Oh gosh.

937
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,660
So

938
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:10,990
close.

939
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,690
Oh my god.

940
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,270
The longest bridge in history.

941
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:18,370
Bumblebee.

942
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,810
I did not think I was gonna be able to do that first try.

943
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,630
I'm not gonna lie.

944
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,190
I'm not gonna lie.

945
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,430
That's it.

946
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,650
Auto scum.

947
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:49,230
Help!

948
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,330
Where is he?

949
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,930
Oh gosh.

950
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,330
I almost got my back attacked.

951
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,320
Where the hell did you come from?

952
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,820
I'm just trying to dodge, man.

953
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,180
Oh

954
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,230
my god, what's happening?

955
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,410
This is so unfair.

956
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,230
You can be a...

957
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:36,710
Ouch.

958
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,310
I'm getting my ass kicked.

959
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:40,850
Come on.

960
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:41,730
There we go.

961
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,810
How do you have ice magic too?

962
00:52:59,170 --> 00:52:59,810
I'm out.

963
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:03,490
Oh no.

964
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,370
Nice.

965
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,550
Okay.

966
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:16,500
I accidentally switched to the...

967
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,870
You gotta be kidding with that.

968
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:27,930
He's so close.

969
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,250
My health.

970
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,350
What the hell?

971
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,110
Oh my god.

972
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,450
I'm about to fall into the...

973
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,020
Let's you die between people's legs so you can back attack them?

974
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,420
Really?

975
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,920
I'll have to try it.

976
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,460
Oh yeah, guys.

977
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,480
Oh yeah, guys.

978
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,720
Wearing Megatron's helmet.

979
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:14,780
Nah.

980
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,720
He didn't make a doodoo.

981
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,520
He just grabbed it with the claws.

982
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,960
C's get degrees, everybody.

983
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,040
C's get degrees.

984
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,720
Wait.

985
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,260
I met Bumblebee's VA at a con a few years back.

986
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,100
His ex-wife and my sister had the same name.

987
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,320
Getting an autograph was...

988
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,560
That's not... It's not...

989
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,020
Your fault.

990
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,540
Yay.

991
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,800
Alright, Bumblebee.

992
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,560
Do we want to give you Starscream's...

993
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,360
Starscream's...

994
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,500
This is the cryo machine gun.

995
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,480
Hold on.

996
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,700
How good...

997
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,720
It wasn't this.

998
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,820
What was it?

999
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,720
Starscream... This one.

1000
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,380
Oh no.

1001
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:31,960
It's not a better.

1002
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,300
Starscream sucks.

1003
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,840
His null ray is not as good as my current thing.

1004
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:40,840
Wait.

1005
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,240
Let's see with the cryo machine gun.

1006
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,490
This is even worse.

1007
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:48,950
Hold on.

1008
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,550
My head is kind of blocking it.

1009
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,070
There you go.

1010
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,430
It's even worse.

1011
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,210
This stuff is too good.

1012
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,270
Starscream... That guy is such a weasel.

1013
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,490
He's always just like...

1014
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,010
One day...

1015
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,690
One day, Megatron, I'll betray you.

1016
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,030
He's just a weaselly guy.

1017
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:16,690
You can always upgrade stuff.

1018
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,310
That's true.

1019
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,290
That is true.

1020
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:20,810
Synthesize everything.

1021
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,290
Gosh, there's so much going on in this game.

1022
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,550
Swap out the dual swords.

1023
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:27,610
Maybe...

1024
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:29,230
Actually, let's see.

1025
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,230
It has less attack power.

1026
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,210
Hold on, guys.

1027
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:39,890
I'm so sorry.

1028
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,350
How long has it been?

1029
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh my gosh.

1030
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,130
It hasn't even been an hour.

1031
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,590
But I have to go to the little ghost's room.

1032
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,510
I'm sorry.

1033
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,010
I've been drinking so much water today.

1034
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,630
I'll be right back.

1035
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,210
Usually, I'm at the two hour mark.

1036
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,450
But today...

1037
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,470
I'm at the one hour mark.

1038
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,430
Everybody stay hydrated, okay?

1039
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:07,790
Okay, BRB.

1040
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:09,770
BRB.

1041
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,700
I'm back.

1042
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,480
A delivery.

1043
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,740
Right when I...

1044
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,740
Right when I...

1045
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,360
left.

1046
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,400
So, good timing for me.

1047
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,420
Welcome back.

1048
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,620
Thank you.

1049
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,700
I am back.

1050
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,740
I'm back, baby!

1051
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,740
Okay, we'll do Starscream's little...

1052
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,580
little things.

1053
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,740
But everything requires Energon.

1054
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,860
Does it all require its own Energon?

1055
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,120
Or if I'm once I'm out of Ener...

1056
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:47,480
Oh, no.

1057
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,900
Because I ran out of Energon on the cryo machine gun...

1058
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,640
and then I was able to use the Energon for this one.

1059
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,100
Okay.

1060
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,760
We're so back.

1061
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:00,680
Okay.

1062
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,480
But I'm keeping Devastator's drills...

1063
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,180
because those...

1064
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:04,320
What?

1065
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,140
Yeah.

1066
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,000
Well, yeah, yeah.

1067
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:06,560
Okay.

1068
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:09,940
Okey-dokey.

1069
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,360
I feel so bad, you guys.

1070
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,800
I'm sorry.

1071
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,060
I feel that I haven't been able to really...

1072
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,480
reach out so much with this game.

1073
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,200
But hopefully, you guys don't mind so much.

1074
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,560
I feel like you guys are all being like...

1075
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,760
I'm trying to tell Mint the cool lore.

1076
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,760
And I'm like...

1077
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,480
I play game.

1078
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,760
Oh, yeah, we were gonna synthesize.

1079
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:31,800
Let's see.

1080
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,940
Yeah, it's action game.

1081
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,780
I gotta lock in.

1082
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,760
I gotta be like...

1083
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,910
I am enjoying the game.

1084
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,510
We could synthesize...

1085
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,130
with like a baby.

1086
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,710
Stupid stuff.

1087
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,610
With the gloves.

1088
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,540
Mr.

1089
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:11,400
Beast?

1090
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,120
No!

1091
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,000
I think we decided if I had a beast form...

1092
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,220
I would be a monkey.

1093
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,190
Beast or beast.

1094
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:32,790
A mist?

1095
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,250
Mist would be...

1096
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,290
Probably useful for sneaking in places.

1097
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,370
Remember chat, wise man once said...

1098
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,390
It is better to be pissed on than pissed off.

1099
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:51,090
I think it might have been Confucius or something.

1100
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,450
Beethoven, look at us!

1101
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,510
I'm not looking.

1102
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:56,110
I'm ignoring.

1103
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,390
Attack level 2.

1104
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,110
Wait, cryo gloves?

1105
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:05,650
No, no.

1106
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:06,710
Wait, no, no.

1107
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,340
Wait, what did I...

1108
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,410
Wait, synthesize?

1109
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,130
Oh, Devastator's Drills.

1110
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:14,770
Okay, there we go.

1111
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:15,610
I was like, wait a second.

1112
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:17,990
Stupid.

1113
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,250
What's one with like a special...

1114
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,730
Something or other, you know?

1115
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:28,010
Bolt?

1116
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,490
Bolt, wreck, plus?

1117
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,090
What's that mean?

1118
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,330
Item pull level 3?

1119
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,910
That's pretty good actually.

1120
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,960
I can only do one though.

1121
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,780
Oh wait, do I already have one of these?

1122
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,000
Select skills to be...

1123
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,880
I gotta pick two.

1124
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,020
These are the ones that I already have, right?

1125
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,400
Minky triple changer.

1126
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,280
Cute ghost maid who becomes a funny monkey or a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone.

1127
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,660
The red is the equipped ones.

1128
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,380
Okay, nevermind.

1129
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,400
Maybe let's see if we have any other skills that are really good that we could...

1130
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,620
Energon attack plus.

1131
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,720
Okay.

1132
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,340
Item pull.

1133
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,960
Sorry, outspeed.

1134
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,620
What's wreck drop?

1135
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,520
Attack plus.

1136
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,540
Accuracy?

1137
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,120
I don't need that.

1138
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,460
I'm 100% accurate.

1139
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,660
Knockdown?

1140
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,240
Okay, okay.

1141
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,800
I lost my place.

1142
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,260
No, focus.

1143
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,460
Bolt cost?

1144
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,500
Minus?

1145
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,420
That could be pretty good actually.

1146
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,800
That could be pretty good maybe.

1147
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,260
My friend said your transformer's alt mode would be a cute little steam train.

1148
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,060
Wait, I love that!

1149
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,080
Love that.

1150
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,860
Can you give us your best...

1151
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,660
Autobots, transform and roll out!

1152
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,380
Fire rate, overdrive, knockdown plus.

1153
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,860
I don't know, but there's so many things that we could do.

1154
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,880
That was great?

1155
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:56,560
You think so?

1156
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,140
I'm pretty good?

1157
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,780
Yeah, I want to be a train.

1158
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,140
Okay, what are the things that we...

1159
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,980
Oh, there was one that I was gonna do.

1160
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,440
Not the focus.

1161
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,780
Unless focus would be good because I do dodge a lot and kind of like, you know...

1162
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,260
And it's level 4 focus!

1163
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:16,520
Hold on.

1164
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:20,200
Increases damage dealt by 15% mid-focus.

1165
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,600
Wait, that's kind of huge!

1166
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,040
Increases recovery rate of the ultimate gauge by 8%.

1167
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,080
Increases the amount of health recovered by 6%.

1168
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,540
15% is a lot, no?

1169
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,300
That's what the new steampunk bubble beat turns into?

1170
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,980
No way!

1171
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,030
Health good.

1172
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,190
You could always sell, that's true.

1173
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:48,990
You know what, let's sell a bunch of stuff.

1174
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,480
Sell.

1175
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:54,740
Sell.

1176
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,480
Let's sell all...

1177
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,540
our weak things.

1178
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,900
I'm not making much from this, but I'm making money.

1179
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:13,960
A little bit.

1180
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,340
Astro train is another triple charger.

1181
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:17,960
Oh, changer.

1182
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,580
Like Blitzwing and can turn into a steam engine and a space shuttle!

1183
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,500
That seems a little overpowered.

1184
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,780
Mint engine.

1185
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:37,690
Lightning sword.

1186
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:38,530
It's riding!

1187
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,570
I can't sell it.

1188
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:41,910
Just kidding.

1189
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:42,610
Yes, I can.

1190
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,890
Maybe freak train?

1191
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,470
That'd be kind of awesome, not gonna lie.

1192
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:51,670
Basic sniper rifle.

1193
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:53,530
Okay, now we're getting more big bucks.

1194
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,520
These are all still rank D, so I think we're on C level.

1195
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,320
Everything that I've been using.

1196
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:10,850
We have so many.

1197
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,110
Holy moly.

1198
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,580
Are you gonna buy some of the toys now?

1199
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,620
Oh my gosh, I went to AmiAmi the other day and they had the cutest little plushies.

1200
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,680
Of like Optimus and...

1201
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,120
I know they had Bumblebee, I can't remember who else they had.

1202
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:41,740
As a joke, I say you'd probably either be a combiner with Doki Bird or you'd transform into Optimus Prime's reconnaissance drone.

1203
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,660
I wanna be my own guy.

1204
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:59,470
Why is even this so expensive?

1205
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,430
But it's rank C.

1206
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,130
Does the rank not mean much?

1207
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,030
Sideswipe swords.

1208
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:08,390
Oh, we could just buy them.

1209
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:15,570
I'm at the Japan, only characters as a combiner made up of six trained Autobots named Raiden.

1210
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:21,690
There's too many options, I'm getting lost in the sauce, you guys.

1211
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,690
Let's just keep going for now.

1212
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:28,850
Let's just keep going for now, and if I die and I need to do upgrades, then we'll work on it.

1213
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,730
Oops.

1214
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:56,210
Thanks gamer!

1215
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,350
Oh my God!

1216
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,310
Ok, we're going.

1217
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:17,150
How did I get to the other side of the bridge?

1218
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,790
Oh my God!

1219
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:23,370
Seeker!

1220
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:30,710
Dang it, I tried to block.

1221
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:32,310
I tried to dodge that.

1222
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:39,050
Why are you always going into plane mode, every single one of you?

1223
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,060
I'm still safe.

1224
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm still safe.

1225
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:00,980
I'm still...

1226
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,620
We got him.

1227
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,520
Somehow.

1228
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,100
Let's go.

1229
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,120
Grab my stuff.

1230
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,340
What is...what is this?

1231
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,560
Enter.

1232
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,760
There's one over here too.

1233
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,520
I saw something else on the map.

1234
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,580
Modeled after the ones used by Optimus Primal in Beasties.

1235
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,240
No way!

1236
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,200
Oh man, I lost my money.

1237
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,600
What is this?

1238
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,100
Oh, the side missions.

1239
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,640
Thank you.

1240
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,060
Just go!

1241
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,680
Oh my gosh.

1242
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,800
Oh no.

1243
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,520
Oh no, he moved me.

1244
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:16,150
Is there...is there a thing to make us go super fast?

1245
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,450
Oh, this is the other one that I was seeing I think.

1246
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:22,690
Look at the light here.

1247
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,050
I almost missed this.

1248
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,780
I almost missed that.

1249
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:38,550
Can I double jump as a car?

1250
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:42,050
Let's try it.

1251
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:46,050
Oh no, it makes me double jump back to robot.

1252
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,930
There we go.

1253
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:53,790
No time!

1254
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:55,410
Just go!

1255
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:57,850
No time!

1256
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,330
Oh my god, that's a tank.

1257
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:00,590
No time!

1258
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,130
Just go!

1259
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:02,190
Go!

1260
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,550
Ok, just kidding.

1261
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:09,630
Turn around!

1262
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,880
Just go!

1263
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,340
Oh my god.

1264
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,520
Oh, is everybody coming into...

1265
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:31,800
Oh my god.

1266
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,120
Oh my god.

1267
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,600
Wait, I think everybody is here.

1268
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,540
I think everybody is here.

1269
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,220
Oh my god.

1270
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:37,560
Wait.

1271
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:38,580
Ouch!

1272
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:39,800
Oh my god.

1273
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,240
Wait.

1274
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:45,940
Oh god.

1275
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:46,440
Oh god.

1276
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,480
Oh my

1277
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,820
god, there are so many guys here.

1278
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,040
Vehicle attack!

1279
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,220
Vehicle attack!

1280
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:18,760
Just attack!

1281
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,140
Oh my gosh.

1282
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,000
Maybe I can get a back attack.

1283
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:22,600
Back attack!

1284
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,320
Nevermind!

1285
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,460
I tried!

1286
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,360
There we go.

1287
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,520
Oh my god.

1288
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,300
Get out of there.

1289
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,800
Ok, we got one down.

1290
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:35,900
Oh my gosh.

1291
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,580
I'm gonna die!

1292
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:04,890
Ok.

1293
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:07,010
Oh my gosh, that was a close one.

1294
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:08,630
Back attack!

1295
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:12,210
Oh god.

1296
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:12,970
Oh god, my health!

1297
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,680
Back attack, please!

1298
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,500
I want to do it sometimes!

1299
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,580
Ok, we got his ass.

1300
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,540
Kind of.

1301
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,600
Oh my god.

1302
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,500
Wait, I'm gonna heal.

1303
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,080
I'm gonna heal.

1304
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,380
It's fine.

1305
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,460
Wait, did it work?

1306
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,240
50% of health!

1307
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:41,480
Where?

1308
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,160
That didn't work.

1309
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:47,940
I clicked yes, right?

1310
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,500
I

1311
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,210
have the all-in chip!

1312
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,570
Oh my gosh, you're right.

1313
01:14:58,830 --> 01:14:59,310
YOLO!

1314
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,030
Oh my god.

1315
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:03,110
You're so right.

1316
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:05,250
I wasted it.

1317
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,990
I slid the wrong way.

1318
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:12,010
It's so frustrating.

1319
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:12,990
Are you kidding me?

1320
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:14,750
Wait, what's that over there?

1321
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:15,610
Hold on.

1322
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,180
Wait, there's a thing!

1323
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:44,400
Ok.

1324
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,540
How do I get this guy?

1325
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:47,620
Ok.

1326
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,340
Let's see.

1327
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,520
Throw a car at him?

1328
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,600
Good idea.

1329
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,430
Another car.

1330
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,310
Excuse me.

1331
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,190
Thank you.

1332
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:12,510
Ok.

1333
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,170
Did someone call for an Uber?

1334
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,270
Max speed.

1335
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,350
Hold on.

1336
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,730
I'm gonna try and...

1337
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:34,210
Oh shit.

1338
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:40,670
But I don't know how to get max speed here.

1339
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:41,010
Ok.

1340
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:42,590
Let's try it.

1341
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:51,090
That's right.

1342
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,730
Oh no!

1343
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:02,250
No!

1344
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:03,470
No!

1345
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,290
There we go.

1346
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:25,650
Ok, we got one guy down.

1347
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:27,950
Oh my gosh.

1348
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,030
Yeah, there we go.

1349
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:33,630
Come here.

1350
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:34,450
Oh no!

1351
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:38,790
Oh god.

1352
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,090
It's like 1 HP in a dream basically.

1353
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,140
I need him to...

1354
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,120
There we go.

1355
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:51,840
Ok.

1356
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:00,550
Oh shoot.

1357
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,190
I was hoping for the focus.

1358
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:03,010
There!

1359
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:03,810
Focus!

1360
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:04,350
Focus!

1361
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,860
Oh my god.

1362
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,200
Focus!

1363
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:09,720
Focus!

1364
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,450
Oh my ult!

1365
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,410
Wait!

1366
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,870
Oh it's the auto repair kit!

1367
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:47,630
Oh...

1368
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,030
Oh!

1369
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:54,290
Yippee!

1370
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,710
I can't believe it.

1371
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:04,990
Yippee!

1372
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,900
Oh is this a time thing?

1373
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:13,780
Oh gosh.

1374
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,520
Race motor master!

1375
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:16,500
Ok.

1376
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,380
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1377
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,640
I'll have him know that I'm pretty dang fast.

1378
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:24,940
Oh shoot.

1379
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,200
Where is it?

1380
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:27,820
This way?

1381
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,440
I'm going.

1382
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:36,820
Nice.

1383
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,140
Oh I went the wrong way!

1384
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,400
Oh shoot.

1385
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,540
It's pretty close you guys.

1386
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,140
Oh shoot!

1387
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,320
Is it not this way?

1388
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,560
Turn this way?

1389
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,200
Shoot.

1390
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,640
We got this?

1391
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,060
Oh shoot.

1392
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:20,100
Oh my gosh.

1393
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:20,600
Where is it?

1394
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:21,920
I think I went the wrong way.

1395
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,700
No I didn't.

1396
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:28,840
We

1397
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:33,230
got this!

1398
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:34,890
Maybe?

1399
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:39,690
Maybe?

1400
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,390
Maybe?

1401
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,610
Where is he?

1402
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,570
Where am I?

1403
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,710
You were not right behind me, huh?

1404
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:03,230
He was not right behind me like that.

1405
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,050
He was right behind.

1406
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,710
That

1407
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,770
was a close one.

1408
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,490
Come on motor master!

1409
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:34,900
Dang it.

1410
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,400
Almost got the back attack.

1411
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,120
Stupid!

1412
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,740
I'll get him now.

1413
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:47,980
Oh just kidding.

1414
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:49,580
Oh shoot.

1415
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,750
There was an attempt.

1416
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:01,310
There was an attempt there.

1417
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:03,870
There we go.

1418
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,550
I think I got him.

1419
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:18,590
Shot!

1420
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,950
Back...

1421
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,810
Oh my gosh!

1422
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:42,590
The way his...the way his body is laying there.

1423
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,170
lol

1424
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,370
Fun!

1425
01:22:54,910 --> 01:23:02,630
OK What the hell is going on here?

1426
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,220
Oh my goodness.

1427
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,580
We're gonna go with this?

1428
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:15,400
Oh my gosh.

1429
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,260
Oh!

1430
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:18,840
Gross.

1431
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,080
OK.

1432
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:34,610
What about Starscream's thing?

1433
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:36,270
Insecticons easy?

1434
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,590
Yeah but nasty.

1435
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:40,850
Nice.

1436
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:47,470
Oh no.

1437
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,590
I'm low energy already.

1438
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,560
OK.

1439
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,340
I didn't have to get these guys but...

1440
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:01,840
But...

1441
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,260
It's OK.

1442
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,160
And...

1443
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:09,440
Get

1444
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,220
the insignia.

1445
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,720
How do I get it though?

1446
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,280
Because there was the other one on the bridge.

1447
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:25,540
But...

1448
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,440
Just run backwards.

1449
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,440
We got this.

1450
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,360
But...

1451
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,560
We're fine.

1452
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:32,400
Probably.

1453
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,840
Here Zeke!

1454
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,020
Come here!

1455
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,360
Where does he drop down?

1456
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:47,700
Pick up!

1457
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:47,880
Pick up!

1458
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:48,980
I'm spamming!

1459
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,480
I'm spamming!

1460
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,800
Pick up!

1461
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:51,580
Pick up!

1462
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:52,860
Pick up!

1463
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:53,860
Pick up!

1464
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,840
Maybe over here?

1465
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,800
Oh I got him!

1466
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,000
OK.

1467
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,280
Where are you Zeke?

1468
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,500
You shoot the insignia?

1469
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:05,720
OK.

1470
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,000
Hold on.

1471
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,360
I got to go back through here though.

1472
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,160
Scary!

1473
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:17,980
Like that?

1474
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,020
Took down a Decepticon flag!

1475
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,500
Unlocked a new character art for the gallery!

1476
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,000
Oh my eyes.

1477
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,160
Oh cool!

1478
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:26,880
Thanks guys.

1479
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,020
No idea...

1480
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,040
That was a thing.

1481
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,380
That was a thing.

1482
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:35,920
OK

1483
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:39,850
so...

1484
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:40,490
OK I...

1485
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:44,510
OK sorry.

1486
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,450
My bad.

1487
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,050
My bad.

1488
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:03,590
So...

1489
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:06,550
I already get lost in this city and you're going to have me...

1490
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:07,190
OK this way.

1491
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:08,650
Oh shoot.

1492
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:09,870
I see them.

1493
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,930
I don't have time to deal with you!

1494
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,290
This way!

1495
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:25,930
Oh!

1496
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:29,150
Ouch!

1497
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:30,670
Really?

1498
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:31,890
Come on!

1499
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,280
Here?

1500
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,400
It's like right here!

1501
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,060
Maybe I have to go up this way.

1502
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,600
I definitely have to go up this way.

1503
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:47,940
Ouch!

1504
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,260
Ouch!

1505
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:48,420
Ouch!

1506
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,700
Oh thank you!

1507
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,460
Something exploded them for me.

1508
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,180
Awesome.

1509
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,400
Oh not awesome!

1510
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,570
That's awesome though.

1511
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:08,710
OK this way.

1512
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,850
Alright, towards the claws.

1513
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:14,650
It's always towards all the danger, right?

1514
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,360
Nice!

1515
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,640
Oh wow!

1516
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,420
We took it out in the last hit.

1517
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,200
The claw...

1518
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,640
The claw...

1519
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,060
Yeah!

1520
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,220
OK.

1521
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,660
Alright we are real close.

1522
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,640
Or it's like right...

1523
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,260
Not that.

1524
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,600
I sure hope not.

1525
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:52,640
Wait.

1526
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,440
OK hold on before we do that.

1527
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,320
I heard of a game called Crow Country.

1528
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,600
I have!

1529
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,540
Um...

1530
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,880
Actually I haven't played it because...

1531
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,600
I'm not so like...

1532
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,480
It's kind of like Resident Evil style I feel.

1533
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,840
It's not like my exact favorite type of game.

1534
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:21,980
Uh oh!

1535
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,960
Oh my god he's that meme.

1536
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,020
The guy that slaps it on there.

1537
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,120
Explode!

1538
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,260
Oh OK.

1539
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,020
Yeah we will.

1540
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,180
Oh my gosh!

1541
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,520
There are so many people here!

1542
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,540
Oh my god!

1543
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:56,840
Yeah!

1544
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,140
And by we I mean me.

1545
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,180
Me.

1546
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,460
By me.

1547
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,080
I mean we.

1548
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:12,820
Me.

1549
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,200
Oh my god.

1550
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,160
Hey what are you guys doing over here?

1551
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,400
Oh my gosh.

1552
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,520
Oh my god.

1553
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,140
What was that?

1554
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,900
Holy hell.

1555
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,460
What was...

1556
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,810
Oh my god!

1557
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,580
What was that?

1558
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,160
That jumpscare in my own ears.

1559
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,300
Oh my god.

1560
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,780
Oh my god.

1561
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,160
That actually...

1562
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,140
Am I in VC?

1563
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,040
Why would I be in VC on stream?

1564
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,460
I think you're haunted.

1565
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,220
I can't be haunted by another ghost.

1566
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,300
That scared me so bad.

1567
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:23,460
Oh my god.

1568
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,220
I need a break after that.

1569
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,440
Holy moly I need an actual breather.

1570
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,340
Poor headphone users.

1571
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,220
That's me!

1572
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:40,360
I literally threw my

1573
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:45,030
head...

1574
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,390
Starscream's ghost.

1575
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:51,570
Oh my god.

1576
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:53,290
Holy shit.

1577
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,450
I'm gonna turn down the volume for now.

1578
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:03,910
Just in case that happens again.

1579
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:07,030
And the volume on my headphones.

1580
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,530
Oh my god.

1581
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,190
Your PC might be a Decepticon.

1582
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:14,270
Gosh.

1583
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:17,730
I feel like traumatized after.

1584
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:19,350
I'm like do I even wanna...

1585
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,050
Oh my god.

1586
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,000
Oh my god.

1587
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,440
Uh oh.

1588
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:27,460
Warning.

1589
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:29,240
An

1590
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:36,490
Optimus!

1591
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,170
I'm so freaked out now.

1592
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:45,690
Oh my gosh.

1593
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,070
Come here.

1594
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,890
Come here with my short arms.

1595
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:50,890
Come here.

1596
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:52,250
There we go.

1597
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,660
Can you guys even hear the game anymore?

1598
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:02,140
My heart is still pounding.

1599
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:02,900
Me too.

1600
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:06,920
That scared the donkadonks out of me.

1601
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,420
Oh my gosh.

1602
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,160
Oh, Seekers.

1603
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,020
Sorry, I'm getting money.

1604
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,000
They're on me.

1605
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,580
They're on everybody.

1606
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:33,470
What are you talking about?

1607
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:35,570
Oh my gosh.

1608
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,990
You guys scared me so bad.

1609
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:37,910
I'm so sorry.

1610
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,130
I'm so sorry that happened.

1611
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,390
I don't know what happened at all.

1612
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,610
That's never happened before.

1613
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,480
Stinking guy.

1614
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,860
Wait, I'm gonna get all this stuff.

1615
01:32:58,260 --> 01:32:59,020
Look at all this loot.

1616
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,040
Wait, what's that?

1617
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:02,820
Disappeared.

1618
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,740
They got it.

1619
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,740
Everything's fine.

1620
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,360
Wait, no they don't.

1621
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,840
He's still there.

1622
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:11,780
I'm coming in.

1623
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:12,740
With an attack.

1624
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,020
Saddle slam?

1625
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:16,880
Excuse me?

1626
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,580
What was that?

1627
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,740
Oh, these guys just explode.

1628
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,940
We don't even have to worry about them.

1629
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,660
Oh, maybe we do have to worry about them.

1630
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:27,820
Sorry.

1631
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:34,580
Wait,

1632
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:39,920
what?

1633
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:40,980
Sorry, hold on.

1634
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:41,020
Hold on.

1635
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:44,840
Star stream didn't actually come back as a ghost?

1636
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:45,440
That's so funny.

1637
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:47,960
Oh, these guys.

1638
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,900
Come on.

1639
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,740
Back attack.

1640
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:57,890
Ouch.

1641
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,520
We got his ass.

1642
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:08,720
Nice.

1643
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,320
I 1v1 that guy.

1644
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,300
Come on everyone.

1645
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,340
What are you doing?

1646
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:32,200
Tentatively turning the volume back up.

1647
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,700
I'm very tentatively turning the volume back up because I'm scared.

1648
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,380
I'm leaking all over.

1649
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,360
Why am I all by myself?

1650
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,460
Where did my friends go?

1651
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,320
Where are my friends?

1652
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:35,250
As long as I can keep dodging his stuff, I should be okay.

1653
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:35,670
Maybe.

1654
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:44,630
Okay, phase 2.

1655
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:48,150
I like his horns.

1656
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:52,250
Oh shit.

1657
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,960
Oh, ouch.

1658
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:10,580
He

1659
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:18,030
can still attack you.

1660
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:19,570
Oh, I'm getting his head.

1661
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:20,310
Oh my god.

1662
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:21,910
Oh, I can still dodge.

1663
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:23,790
Even in the air.

1664
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:26,570
Let's go.

1665
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,420
Damn, I was getting good damage with his head though.

1666
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:35,900
Nice.

1667
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,720
Nice.

1668
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,480
I'm just spamming this over and over again.

1669
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,040
Oh, I got an S on that, you guys.

1670
01:36:59,300 --> 01:36:59,780
Menasor!

1671
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:03,740
Oh, I thought he was running away with the crying.

1672
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:09,180
Um...

1673
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,500
He's like, if I can't have it, no one can have it.

1674
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,100
Oh, just kidding.

1675
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:13,880
They have it.

1676
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:17,800
Dang it!

1677
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,330
Nobody likes Starscream.

1678
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:46,380
You can make a tron, but I will laugh last.

1679
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,480
I will laugh last.

1680
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:49,560
Who says that?

1681
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,800
Everybody says I'll have the last laugh.

1682
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,840
Starscream, the most loyal soldier.

1683
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:57,580
Absolutely.

1684
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,520
Chapter 4 complete!

1685
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,700
Nice, that means we only have what?

1686
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,360
5, 6, 7?

1687
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:08,820
3 more?

1688
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,520
Menasor's Ionizer Sword!

1689
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,920
Let's skip this.

1690
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,900
Oh dang, this seems pretty good.

1691
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:26,980
Hold on.

1692
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,140
No mission?

1693
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:34,100
I do want to synthesize some stuff.

1694
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:38,060
Let's see, let's get rid of Starscream's baby stuff.

1695
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,940
It's so much better!

1696
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,820
I wonder if it's really... Is it slow though?

1697
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:49,650
Let's go.

1698
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,470
I do want to get some stuff up though.

1699
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:53,810
I am... Hold on.

1700
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,370
First though...

1701
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,450
We have the all-in, right?

1702
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:03,230
I feel like I should have the ability to recover.

1703
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:05,030
Wouldn't we?

1704
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:07,910
What does it do again though?

1705
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:10,790
Increases attack at the cost of losing ability.

1706
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:13,790
It's like 15% attack.

1707
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,630
Let's try another one.

1708
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:18,610
We are going to develop something.

1709
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,670
Something great.

1710
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:24,630
Something...

1711
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:26,490
Ranged up attack.

1712
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:29,130
15%.

1713
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,050
These giant combiner boss fights are chef's kiss.

1714
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:34,930
They are so good, right?

1715
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:36,490
Just don't get hit.

1716
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:37,030
So true.

1717
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:38,490
Just game.

1718
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:44,610
I don't think that really helps us so much though.

1719
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:46,970
Not with how I play, I feel.

1720
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:52,360
We have the enhanced radar.

1721
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:01,530
Okay.

1722
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:04,070
Synthesize.

1723
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,310
We are going to synthesize our gloves.

1724
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:08,790
Our drills.

1725
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:13,070
We have...

1726
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,580
Focus plus level 4 might be good.

1727
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:29,790
Do you want to boost the difficulty?

1728
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:31,750
No, I'm having fun.

1729
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:33,810
So...

1730
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:35,930
I'm okay actually where I'm at.

1731
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:46,810
Trying to decide if I want the recovery.

1732
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:49,430
Or the... Wait a second.

1733
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:51,430
If we have all in...

1734
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:53,570
Increases amount of health recovered.

1735
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:55,250
We can't even use this.

1736
01:40:55,610 --> 01:40:56,590
Wait a second.

1737
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:58,230
We can't even recover health.

1738
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:00,470
Because we have all in equipped.

1739
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,430
So actually this...

1740
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:06,670
No.

1741
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:09,050
This... Wait, wait, wait.

1742
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:12,750
Yeah, we have no recovery.

1743
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:14,130
So we remove this.

1744
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,710
If we set this, increases damage dealt by 15%.

1745
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:20,910
In mid-focus, which I use all the time.

1746
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:22,310
Like I'm always in focus mode.

1747
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,010
I'm locked in.

1748
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:31,410
Okay.

1749
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:34,650
So now I'm just gonna do some...

1750
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,770
Like... Oh no, that's...

1751
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:38,570
Not that one.

1752
01:41:39,110 --> 01:41:39,990
We're just gonna...

1753
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:40,790
Wait.

1754
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:45,730
We're just gonna synthesize with some weapons just to...

1755
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:46,770
Level it up.

1756
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:49,490
Level 7.

1757
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:55,710
Something tells me you'd like the Autobot Warpath.

1758
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:57,030
Everyone likes Warpath.

1759
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:58,230
Maybe.

1760
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,170
And then...

1761
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:04,130
How is the max I can get to?

1762
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:04,870
Max level.

1763
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:13,160
I'm just using ones that don't have skills on them.

1764
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:15,040
To level up.

1765
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,000
That was level 8.

1766
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,420
Maybe we're okay there.

1767
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,000
And then...

1768
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,400
What other...

1769
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,620
What's my ranged weapons that I use?

1770
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,360
Shock blast.

1771
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:31,920
Oh, cryo machine?

1772
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,600
We need to...

1773
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,080
We can even do more skills on this actually.

1774
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:37,380
Let's see.

1775
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,020
Ult cost.

1776
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:47,680
Blast plush.

1777
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:51,300
Blast plush.

1778
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:51,680
Focus plush.

1779
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,320
Oh wait, this is Starscream.

1780
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,120
Sorry Starscream.

1781
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:55,320
Defect.

1782
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,380
Defect, what does that do?

1783
01:42:58,980 --> 01:42:59,640
Oh, okay.

1784
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:00,580
We're adding it.

1785
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:01,600
Wait!

1786
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:02,740
Negative!

1787
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:03,680
No, wait.

1788
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,140
Is that actually...

1789
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,500
Wait, that's so messed up.

1790
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:08,840
Is it what it means?

1791
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,200
It's a bad gun.

1792
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,460
Defect is bad.

1793
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:17,790
How dare the name actually be what it actually is.

1794
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,280
How dare!

1795
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,960
How dare!

1796
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,660
Accuracy, level 3.

1797
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:24,740
We'll do that for sure.

1798
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,700
Oh yeah.

1799
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,360
How dare it means a bad thing actually.

1800
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:36,840
Actually...

1801
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,600
Just gonna go with some smaller things too.

1802
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:54,040
Like this.

1803
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:57,560
Okay, now it's level 5.

1804
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:01,160
Yeah, SMH game, not lying.

1805
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:02,800
How dare.

1806
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,220
How dare.

1807
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:08,960
Okay.

1808
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:18,420
Apparently you can get rid of the defect debuff if you fully upgrade the slots.

1809
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,000
I see, I see, I see.

1810
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,660
No, I've never died once even in my whole afterlife.

1811
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:28,980
Ever, ever.

1812
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,260
Must be stopped.

1813
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:36,260
Megatron.

1814
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,660
Must be stopped.

1815
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,020
Follow me.

1816
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:47,700
I haven't played as Wheeljack or actually I haven't played as Optimus Prime yet either.

1817
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,820
But I just feel so comfortable with Bumblebee.

1818
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,860
So I hope you guys don't mind if I keep playing as him.

1819
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:55,880
Yippee!

1820
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,220
He thinks he's Mario.

1821
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:58,320
Mario.

1822
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:11,450
Optimus...

1823
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:11,950
Oh, okay.

1824
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:15,990
Shoot.

1825
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:20,690
Oh my god.

1826
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:24,690
Where are you?

1827
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:31,090
Stupid.

1828
01:45:31,090 --> 01:45:31,310
Open.

1829
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,610
I tried dodge.

1830
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:37,930
Oh my gosh, I can't see anything.

1831
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:39,010
This is crazy.

1832
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,610
Where are we?

1833
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:44,950
This is so awesome.

1834
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:48,310
There we go.

1835
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:48,630
Nice.

1836
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,180
Nice.

1837
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,760
I totally...

1838
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,760
I totally...

1839
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,260
I just...

1840
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:13,800
Where is he?

1841
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:16,000
Oh, there he is.

1842
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:19,620
Where is he?

1843
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,800
There we go.

1844
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,340
I'm out.

1845
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:26,920
There we go.

1846
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:37,330
Come on, Starscream.

1847
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,090
Come on, Starscream.

1848
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:41,950
How the hell did you get down there?

1849
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:47,570
Nice.

1850
01:46:48,430 --> 01:46:49,570
Not nice.

1851
01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:51,870
Oh, back attack.

1852
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:52,870
I tried...

1853
01:46:58,010 --> 01:46:58,730
How...

1854
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:59,670
How are we?

1855
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:00,930
Where are we?

1856
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:04,550
That was so close.

1857
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:08,110
That was so close.

1858
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:09,930
Oh.

1859
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,570
We got him.

1860
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,540
Mess him up.

1861
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,740
We kicked his butt.

1862
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,620
Oh,

1863
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:29,260
Starscream.

1864
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,740
He's so pathetic.

1865
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,980
Help me up.

1866
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:44,740
What?

1867
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,840
I'm still confused what that sound glitch was.

1868
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,060
Auto-buckets?

1869
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,560
Blitzwing again?

1870
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,000
Nice.

1871
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,080
Nice.

1872
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:21,900
Wait.

1873
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:22,700
No, no, no.

1874
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,300
We're not done with him.

1875
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,400
We'll take care of one.

1876
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:31,480
Maybe not one at a time.

1877
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:32,280
OK.

1878
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:32,980
We're fine.

1879
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:40,330
We got to break these guys'...

1880
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:44,850
Nice.

1881
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:57,710
Where is he?

1882
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:18,120
Nice.

1883
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1884
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:37,060
Slide, slide, slide.

1885
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:39,920
You know what?

1886
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:40,620
This is fine, maybe.

1887
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,400
No, it's not fine.

1888
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:42,180
But this is fine.

1889
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,220
This is fine, maybe.

1890
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,040
I tried to get under his legs.

1891
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,660
I tried to get under his legs!

1892
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:48,720
Oops.

1893
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,240
Probably an audio buffer bug.

1894
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:00,160
The game glitched and played a bunch of sounds at the same time, which made them incredibly loud.

1895
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,960
I guess so, maybe.

1896
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,400
Can we take him home?

1897
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,780
Cool finisher.

1898
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,000
Sentry bot.

1899
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:16,720
Actually...

1900
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,700
Before we can...

1901
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:19,780
Well, also...

1902
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:22,780
This looks mighty tasty.

1903
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,900
Oh yeah, I shoot the symbol.

1904
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:27,560
Thank you!

1905
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,220
You guys can always tell me when to shoot the symbol.

1906
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,760
Because I will forget.

1907
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,320
Or if I don't... I didn't even see that one.

1908
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:45,380
I didn't even see that one.

1909
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,800
But I did want to actually...

1910
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:49,840
Oh, look at that!

1911
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,800
Oh my gosh, we missed so many!

1912
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,600
Oh no!

1913
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:54,820
Oopsie.

1914
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:56,140
Crimsie!

1915
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:59,220
Info logs.

1916
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,200
I wanted to hear more about the Proud Star.

1917
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,840
Isn't there a...

1918
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,880
Oh, there's no one to narrate this one?

1919
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:09,120
OK.

1920
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:16,760
My favorite cheesy line is when Megatron says, Brilliant, my Boron compressor.

1921
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:19,140
Boron is a brown metal, so you can guess what it means.

1922
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:19,840
Ew!

1923
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:30,120
Proud Star log 000-0000-0616.

1924
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,440
G-axis.

1925
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,120
G-axis.

1926
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,140
Who is that?

1927
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:36,820
Who is this?

1928
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:45,380
G-axis.

1929
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:47,540
J-axis.

1930
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:48,460
G-axis.

1931
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,280
He's from the G2 comic book.

1932
01:51:52,960 --> 01:52:02,300
I'm excited for the scientific discoveries and explorations that are coming from our mission, but I would be dishonest with myself if I said that I wasn't also getting caught up in Nova Prime's mission.

1933
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:07,440
Maybe it's how he carries himself, but the sheer idealism and hope that emanates from that bot is profound.

1934
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,440
He truly is the best of us.

1935
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,560
I'm just a scientist.

1936
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:17,500
But he truly believes in the spark of Cybertron, and carrying a torch from the well of the AllSpark from planet to planet.

1937
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:25,720
He believes that our accomplishments, both as species and as a society, are worthy of taking to the stars to share with others.

1938
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:31,200
It makes my science seem insignificant against a mission with that much pride and legacy wrapped up in it.

1939
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:35,300
Who knows, maybe I'll convert and call myself an Autobot one day.

1940
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,240
Wow, okay.

1941
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:40,480
Needs a whole lot to unpack, okay.

1942
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:47,500
It's a pun on G-Access because the G2 comic was getting cancelled?

1943
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:49,020
Oh my gosh, how petty.

1944
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,600
It's my favorite.

1945
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,340
Critics!

1946
01:52:54,480 --> 01:53:01,440
We set down on a planet that had no need for cyberforming, but did offer us supplies we desperately needed for ourselves.

1947
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:04,520
It was shocking to see another planet so like Cybertron itself.

1948
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:07,280
It was as if Primus' hand had shaped the planet.

1949
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,920
There was no smaller life to speak of, but something must have given the planet shape.

1950
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:17,500
We took the supplies we needed, but while there, we all thought someone had their optics on us.

1951
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:20,980
There was, I don't know, a sense of invasiveness there.

1952
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:27,900
And it has been two cycles since we left that planet and something has changed.

1953
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,820
Innova Prime, most notably.

1954
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:32,380
His confidence is still there, but it's changed.

1955
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:36,540
He appears to be driven more and more each passing cycle by his own ego.

1956
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:41,820
Not the righteousness of our mission, but his determination that he is right and that the work must be done.

1957
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,960
A fear for where we are headed.

1958
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:49,540
And now I truly do miss my home back in Tagan Heights on Cybertron.

1959
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,480
There we worked and lived.

1960
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,160
A simple life, but a good one.

1961
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,080
We've come a long way from Lithonia?

1962
01:53:58,580 --> 01:53:59,060
Lithonia?

1963
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:05,980
Back then, changing the planet's core and injecting it with enough raw ore-13.

1964
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,740
There was a sense of pride and righteousness in our hard work.

1965
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:13,400
But now, lost in the darkness of space, we are all succumbing to urges we never thought we'd have.

1966
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,340
Lithone.

1967
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:21,840
Jaxxus is a character from the G2 run of the comic books, who is the villain acting as a third faction.

1968
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:23,600
Cybertronian?

1969
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:24,460
No way.

1970
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:32,060
Another role he has in IDW Publishing's comic run as an ancient transformer and scientist who acted as a mentor to Shockwave.

1971
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,460
I really like the, like...

1972
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:40,460
I don't mind, obviously, like, you know...

1973
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:48,860
Megatron and Optimus' battle against each other and everything, like, that's so great.

1974
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,120
Enemies to lovers, we love it.

1975
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:51,580
But...

1976
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,120
But, I just feel...

1977
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:59,620
Like, I love the history and the origins of stuff so much more with...

1978
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:01,920
With... In Transformers.

1979
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:04,920
Like...

1980
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,120
I'm just gonna, like, for example...

1981
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,780
It's surprisingly deep.

1982
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:17,600
Yeah!

1983
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,320
There's so much, I know.

1984
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,540
Like, for example...

1985
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,600
In Transformers 1...

1986
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:30,780
Like, when we got to the stuff involving, like, the actual, like, primes and everything...

1987
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:33,340
I was just like, oh, this is kind of...

1988
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:35,740
This is so way interesting.

1989
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,700
Waiting for spoilers?

1990
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,100
I didn't say any spoilers.

1991
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:42,220
Spoilers.

1992
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:54,720
It happens when you get 40 years of comics and cartoons to pull from.

1993
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,140
True.

1994
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,180
True!

1995
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,060
But, how would I read the comics?

1996
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,540
You know, is there, like, a place online to read them, rather?

1997
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:07,940
Like...

1998
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,040
I'm not super into collecting comics.

1999
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:15,600
So, if there's, like, an online, like, you know...

2000
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,460
Not anymore?

2001
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,160
No!

2002
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:28,660
A library...

2003
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:31,500
It's kind of like, you know, like, reading manga online.

2004
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,820
I don't really collect physical manga.

2005
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,400
Unless I really, really love a series.

2006
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:40,560
Or, like, an author or something.

2007
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:41,600
Like, I'll collect...

2008
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:50,360
Or if I'm, like, super deep in a series already.

2009
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:54,820
It's kind of stinky, though.

2010
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:04,990
Like, um...

2011
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:06,890
I collect Junji Ito physical manga.

2012
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:10,630
But...

2013
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:13,750
So, the Marvel comics, you start from issue 1 and just go.

2014
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:15,890
IDWs start with infiltration.

2015
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:20,150
You have to go, but the paperbacks aren't too expensive.

2016
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:26,110
It's also a matter of not having a lot of space for me.

2017
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:32,430
I'm, like, maxed out of several bookshelves now.

2018
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:36,900
I'm maxed out on several bookshelves now, so...

2019
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:40,650
You know...

2020
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:42,210
Luckily, they're very thin, right?

2021
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:44,390
I need to stop buying doujins.

2022
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:47,990
G-Axis.

2023
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:51,730
Our journey grows even longer.

2024
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:54,390
The search for planets that are both uninhabited...

2025
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:55,450
Uninhabited.

2026
01:57:57,950 --> 01:57:58,550
Uninhabited.

2027
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:00,950
Uninhabited.

2028
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:09,030
And to have enough base material to cyberform is a long and difficult one.

2029
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:11,530
None of us will talk about it, but we all can feel it.

2030
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:15,670
The further from Cybertron we get, the darker our thoughts become.

2031
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:20,790
The current run from Skybound Entertainment can be read online, I think.

2032
01:58:21,050 --> 01:58:22,170
Since it started just last year.

2033
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:24,170
IDWs 2005-2017 run.

2034
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:25,090
You'll have to find it online.

2035
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:25,790
Oh, I see.

2036
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:26,610
Thank you.

2037
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:31,990
The crew is turning on itself.

2038
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:34,510
For my part, I know they're after my science.

2039
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:38,030
I've locked them all out, except for the ones I need for my experiments.

2040
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:41,290
I can't fathom why they don't volunteer for my work.

2041
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:43,050
Don't they understand it's for science?

2042
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:45,750
Don't they understand that their sacrifice is for the greater good?

2043
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:51,630
Despite the fact that all my equipment can't detect another ship or lifeform out there...

2044
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:55,710
I am convinced that there is a will infringing upon our sparks.

2045
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:57,770
Not just a will, but consciousness.

2046
01:58:58,370 --> 01:59:01,370
Whatever it is, we are less than insecticons to it.

2047
01:59:01,870 --> 01:59:07,590
And I fear that all our good work seeding worlds will come undone...

2048
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:09,370
If we can't find a way to reverse its effects.

2049
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:11,850
Zoo books!

2050
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:18,810
Nova Prime is the only one who sees what we're doing for what it is.

2051
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:20,390
Cybertron must survive.

2052
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:22,830
All other considerations are irrelevant.

2053
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:25,710
We will succeed, no matter the cost.

2054
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,050
Ruh-roh.

2055
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:32,170
It has come to this.

2056
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:36,390
Most of the crew has been infested with whatever has taken hold of Nova Prime.

2057
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:38,390
They have turned their back on our mission.

2058
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:40,030
And I am the last one.

2059
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:44,030
They know I will not allow them to cyberform any more inhabited worlds.

2060
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:45,730
Oh, they were... oh no.

2061
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,730
They know I will try to stop them, even if it means scuttling the ship.

2062
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:51,970
But there is a way that I might be able to survive.

2063
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:53,130
There is a shuttle.

2064
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:57,190
It can't take me back to Cybertron, but perhaps to one of the planets we have seeded.

2065
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,670
Perhaps I could live out the rest of my days in peace.

2066
01:59:59,870 --> 02:00:01,370
The horror of what I have seen.

2067
02:00:01,610 --> 02:00:04,950
The destructive power of both this ship and the planet we landed on.

2068
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:07,370
Nothing has been the same since we landed there.

2069
02:00:07,370 --> 02:00:10,070
I have programmed the ship's navigation to crash.

2070
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:15,250
The next time the ferrotaxis is activated, I will attempt to escape if I can.

2071
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:17,210
But my odds are not good.

2072
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:18,630
Oh no!

2073
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:20,710
See, this is so interesting.

2074
02:00:23,110 --> 02:00:23,630
Kranix.

2075
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:25,370
This is it.

2076
02:00:25,690 --> 02:00:29,110
We have come across a planet hardly worthy of us even attempting to cyberform.

2077
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:34,550
It will take too much energy to convert all that mud and rock and water to a planet Cybertronians can inhabit.

2078
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:38,390
But what's worse is that there is life there.

2079
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:41,590
Plant life and what appears to be some kind of intelligent life.

2080
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:43,550
Not mechanical, but something else.

2081
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:47,530
It's glitch-inducing to look at, to be sure.

2082
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:51,250
But that doesn't mean it should be destroyed.

2083
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,950
My trap is set.

2084
02:00:54,310 --> 02:01:00,450
When Nova Prime and the others fire up Proudstar's cyberforming protocols, we'll launch into the planet's surface.

2085
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:08,750
This will only work if J-Axis doesn't find my hidden commands in Teletran Alpha's operating system.

2086
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:11,570
He is the only one smart enough to find them.

2087
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:14,650
But hopefully he will be too late and I'll be on the shuttle.

2088
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:19,250
I've chosen to try and make it back to Lithone.

2089
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:23,890
It should be well-formed by the time I arrive.

2090
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:27,450
And that was the last planet where I remember us all feeling truly proud and happy.

2091
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:29,550
I could use that feeling again now.

2092
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:30,470
Oh no!

2093
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:32,270
The cyberforming protocols are enacted!

2094
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:33,690
I have to get to the ship.

2095
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:35,170
It's my only chance!

2096
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:51,550
Rather than coming under a dark influence in the story, the original Nova is just a racist expansionist who believed it was Cybertron's god-given right to rule over all other inferior lifeforms.

2097
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:54,070
I see.

2098
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,340
Ah, sorry kids, I'll be hoarding.

2099
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,240
Ok, cool.

2100
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:05,420
Semii, welcome to membership.

2101
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:05,920
Thank you.

2102
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:08,060
And Gargou, thanks for the five gifts.

2103
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:08,980
Thank you so much.

2104
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:10,400
Alrighty.

2105
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,860
Let's continue onwards.

2106
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:30,080
We haven't seen this in a bit.

2107
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:34,060
No!

2108
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,560
Certain weapon types.

2109
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,700
I don't have the correct...wait, maybe...

2110
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,200
You!

2111
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,240
No.

2112
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:49,880
Maybe...shoot!

2113
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:53,400
No.

2114
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:54,660
Ok, just kidding.

2115
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:58,940
Yeah, let's do that.

2116
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,560
Actually, yeah, sorry.

2117
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:03,880
More lore!

2118
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:07,100
Morph walls.

2119
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:10,720
Woah!

2120
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,100
This room is insane!

2121
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,700
Look at all this.

2122
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:15,760
Holy cow.

2123
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:17,080
Oh my god.

2124
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:21,520
Try the shock blaster.

2125
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:22,240
Monkey!

2126
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:26,180
Oh wait, what's this?

2127
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,760
I almost missed this.

2128
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:31,600
Mystery object.

2129
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:33,060
See, this is the thing.

2130
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:34,820
I missed one earlier before.

2131
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:36,700
Oh my gosh, good thing I went back.

2132
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,120
Vermin doll!

2133
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:47,100
Every prime before Optimus was a P. No.

2134
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:57,570
Optimus is too cool.

2135
02:03:57,870 --> 02:03:59,150
Wait, who's...

2136
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:01,450
DD?

2137
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:02,130
Megadoodoo?

2138
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:05,190
Hello.

2139
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:13,210
Shockwave.

2140
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:18,550
Wait, is this my first time fighting Shockwave in this game?

2141
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:23,350
Oh gosh!

2142
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:36,360
He's so fast!

2143
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,900
Oh my god, he's so fast.

2144
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,900
Oh my god, he's so fast!

2145
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,140
Faster than me!

2146
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:54,190
Meg attack!

2147
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:59,910
We will control the plasma energy.

2148
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:02,010
I

2149
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:06,870
don't like that.

2150
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:16,390
Look at Megatron!

2151
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:19,290
Oh my gosh.

2152
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:21,470
I'm gonna die here for real.

2153
02:05:26,570 --> 02:05:26,990
No!

2154
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:32,660
Oh shoot.

2155
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:46,270
Oh gosh.

2156
02:05:46,610 --> 02:05:46,870
No!

2157
02:05:47,930 --> 02:05:48,630
I won't let you!

2158
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:59,620
I won't let you!

2159
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:14,690
Megatron cute.

2160
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:24,710
I got an S on that even.

2161
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:26,810
Megacombo.

2162
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:28,190
DD Megacombo.

2163
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:37,690
No, Decepticons?

2164
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:39,510
Being deceptive?

2165
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:02,290
We got the commercial break.

2166
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:10,310
He's so funny!

2167
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:13,230
Thank you guys for the super chat!

2168
02:07:14,690 --> 02:07:19,310
In the comic continuity, Shockwave is responsible for everything bad happening.

2169
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:23,810
Shockwave's grey shadow clones are a reference to the Astro Magnum.

2170
02:07:24,110 --> 02:07:28,870
The transforming toy Hasbro brought those rights to and made into Shockwave for the original series.

2171
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:32,690
I like Shockwave's design.

2172
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:35,650
Yeah!

2173
02:07:40,230 --> 02:07:42,310
Can't stop coughing today.

2174
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:46,270
Oh yeah, Shockwave's blaster.

2175
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:50,290
Anything else?

2176
02:07:52,910 --> 02:07:54,010
Nice.

2177
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,860
Shockwave blaster.

2178
02:08:08,450 --> 02:08:13,350
I'm gonna make something really awesome you guys.

2179
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:18,750
The greatest thing known to man!

2180
02:08:19,490 --> 02:08:20,950
Grapple power up.

2181
02:08:21,030 --> 02:08:25,970
That would be great for Grimlock maybe.

2182
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:27,610
Let's go gambling!

2183
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:29,890
One more, one more, one more.

2184
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:34,250
Haha!

2185
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:37,410
Vehicle attack up.

2186
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:39,270
Oh, this is also all in.

2187
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:47,400
I feel...

2188
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:51,640
Vehicle attack up could be...

2189
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:54,860
Better in that, because I'm always using it.

2190
02:08:58,780 --> 02:09:02,180
But all in is only 10% instead of 15%.

2191
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,260
Yeah, Bumblebee has 2 vehicle attacks, so yes.

2192
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:08,580
Right?

2193
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:11,620
Oh, it might stack.

2194
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:14,160
Oh yeah, I wonder.

2195
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:15,840
I wonder if it would stack.

2196
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:19,280
But our enhanced radar, I love it so much.

2197
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:22,740
All in stacks?

2198
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:25,700
We're too good.

2199
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:31,440
I guess we'll never know where the hidden thingies are now, but that's OK.

2200
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:38,380
Hmm...

2201
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:40,940
I want to see... Wait, equip?

2202
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:43,620
I want to see...

2203
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:45,440
We didn't even use the sword.

2204
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:48,660
Wait, instead of the shock blaster, maybe...

2205
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,300
Wait, can we use... Oh, nope, not Starscream.

2206
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:56,420
Shockwave blaster?

2207
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:56,480
Blaster?

2208
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:07,400
What is it at now?

2209
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:17,440
I think I'll switch.

2210
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:21,740
I think I'll switch.

2211
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:26,860
I like the machine gun, because it's very fast.

2212
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:29,560
OK, we can try this.

2213
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:30,880
Ha!

2214
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:33,840
OK.

2215
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:35,220
Alright.

2216
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:43,660
Actually, I am going to synthesize too, because we can get some stuff on our shock...

2217
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:45,560
No, shockwave blaster.

2218
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:47,680
Oh, never mind.

2219
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:50,650
What is the... Hold on, I want to see what the...

2220
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:54,440
Max energy... Increases max weapon energy by 20%.

2221
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:56,020
OK.

2222
02:10:57,380 --> 02:11:02,280
Shockwave toys can be seen spray-painted and repurposed use as medical equipment props in Aliens.

2223
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:02,960
What?

2224
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:04,340
That's so funny.

2225
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:08,140
OK, maybe we'll try it for now.

2226
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,980
Game start-o!

2227
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,520
That's called recycling.

2228
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:17,920
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

2229
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,520
Shockwave holding.

2230
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:33,180
Oh, OK.

2231
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,800
It's really like we are watching the cartoon.

2232
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,300
We are getting sucked.

2233
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,500
Wait, so we escape from the core.

2234
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:17,450
The ground is gone.

2235
02:12:18,970 --> 02:12:19,330
Oh my gosh.

2236
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:24,310
Oh my gosh, there is a timer.

2237
02:12:29,930 --> 02:12:30,490
No!

2238
02:12:31,210 --> 02:12:31,970
Come on!

2239
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:33,330
Go, go, go!

2240
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:34,350
Boost, boost, boost!

2241
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:38,610
Oh my gosh.

2242
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:40,090
I can't get up the stairs.

2243
02:12:42,030 --> 02:12:43,690
I can't get up the stairs!

2244
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:47,750
Over there, over there, over there.

2245
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:50,030
I'm so slow.

2246
02:12:50,190 --> 02:12:51,130
OK, there we go.

2247
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:54,950
A little Bumblebee that could.

2248
02:12:54,950 --> 02:12:57,370
Optimus, the core is going critical.

2249
02:12:57,610 --> 02:13:00,150
It's gonna keep on pumping out more and more power.

2250
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:02,110
Bumblebee looks traumatized right now.

2251
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:05,910
Planetary extinction.

2252
02:13:06,710 --> 02:13:08,090
No one escapes.

2253
02:13:09,010 --> 02:13:13,170
The Insecticons and the Plasma Core are but two of three components.

2254
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:15,010
The Ferrotaxis!

2255
02:13:15,390 --> 02:13:17,930
Though it contains much of our lost culture.

2256
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:18,630
Oh no.

2257
02:13:18,630 --> 02:13:20,250
Destroying it could save Earth.

2258
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:20,690
No!

2259
02:13:21,450 --> 02:13:23,530
Megatron has Ferrotaxi!

2260
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:25,730
No!

2261
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:27,390
Uh oh.

2262
02:13:31,870 --> 02:13:33,210
This guy!

2263
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:33,890
OK.

2264
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:36,330
Go after the Ferrotaxis.

2265
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:39,870
We gotta destroy our culture!

2266
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:40,970
That's so sad!

2267
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:43,650
Our culture!

2268
02:13:44,270 --> 02:13:45,710
I'm picking up all the logs!

2269
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:49,350
They have our culture.

2270
02:14:02,210 --> 02:14:03,890
That was so close.

2271
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:06,750
Oh!

2272
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:07,170
Oh!

2273
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:23,860
Is this supposed to be a...

2274
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:27,280
Oh jeez!

2275
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:27,780
Oh jeez!

2276
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:30,860
Oh thank goodness there was a...

2277
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:32,860
There we go.

2278
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:37,740
Hello?

2279
02:14:51,170 --> 02:14:53,290
I keep hearing it and I...

2280
02:14:55,730 --> 02:14:56,370
Yeah!

2281
02:14:58,690 --> 02:14:59,330
Nice.

2282
02:15:03,850 --> 02:15:04,490
Nice.

2283
02:15:04,970 --> 02:15:06,550
I think it actually did something.

2284
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:09,190
The better attack, you know?

2285
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:11,070
Nevermind.

2286
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:13,870
If I can't dodge though, what's the point?

2287
02:15:19,310 --> 02:15:20,290
Where's the other guy?

2288
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:20,530
Oh here.

2289
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:24,230
Got him.

2290
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:31,150
I hope Soundwave is the next boss.

2291
02:15:31,730 --> 02:15:32,570
I just fought him.

2292
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:35,410
I just fought him.

2293
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:40,830
Probably though, right?

2294
02:15:40,930 --> 02:15:41,170
Maybe?

2295
02:15:45,970 --> 02:15:47,490
Onwards we...

2296
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:49,110
We parkour.

2297
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:53,430
We parkour.

2298
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:57,630
I got gooped.

2299
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,400
I got him.

2300
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,640
Oop!

2301
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:08,160
This way?

2302
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:11,460
Nice.

2303
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:14,620
Oh shoot!

2304
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:18,720
No more goop!

2305
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:20,520
Wait, where is it coming from?

2306
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:21,020
Oh up there.

2307
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:23,880
I'm so bad.

2308
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:24,380
I can't aim.

2309
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:25,180
I can't aim!

2310
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:26,840
Autobot!

2311
02:16:27,240 --> 02:16:28,400
Autobot needs auto-aim.

2312
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,160
Hello Megaminto.

2313
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,440
Hey hi!

2314
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:37,960
What is this one I wonder?

2315
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:40,120
What's this side mission?

2316
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:44,320
Side mission.

2317
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:45,100
Let's try it.

2318
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:46,560
Let's see what's going on here.

2319
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:50,420
Destroy everything!

2320
02:16:56,050 --> 02:16:57,310
In 30 seconds?!

2321
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:03,950
Dare I say impossible?

2322
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:05,870
Dare I say...

2323
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,910
Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible...

2324
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:13,990
Impossible, impossible, impossible...

2325
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:18,630
I can't even hit one thing!

2326
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:21,850
It's impossible!

2327
02:17:24,470 --> 02:17:25,690
I can't even hit that!

2328
02:17:25,790 --> 02:17:27,150
It's basically stationary!

2329
02:17:27,150 --> 02:17:27,370
Stationary!

2330
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,500
We were so close guys.

2331
02:17:38,850 --> 02:17:40,530
We were so close.

2332
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,660
Don't think.

2333
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,120
Shoot!

2334
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:51,260
I hate this wall.

2335
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:54,740
There!

2336
02:17:56,580 --> 02:17:56,860
Ouch!

2337
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:57,860
Every time!

2338
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:03,880
Megatron...

2339
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:08,940
What do you mean what was that?

2340
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:10,100
Who do you think it was?

2341
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:12,160
Cargo lift.

2342
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,700
The battle against the wall.

2343
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:18,020
My actual final boss.

2344
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:20,580
Oh boy.

2345
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:23,480
This looks like a boss arena too.

2346
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:30,080
What a jerk!

2347
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,480
Yeah, what gives?

2348
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:35,180
What gives?

2349
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,100
Everybody's here!

2350
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:43,320
Have you guys been behind me this whole time?

2351
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:43,960
That's embarrassing.

2352
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:47,000
Sorry for my...

2353
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:47,740
Sorry.

2354
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:50,080
Can I aim?

2355
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:55,390
Maybe I have to get closer.

2356
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:04,760
Is there like a...

2357
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:06,300
What's it called?

2358
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:09,640
I got it!

2359
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:13,160
What am I checking?

2360
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:13,980
Oh, this thing.

2361
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:16,000
Hello friends!

2362
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,340
He's looking at me.

2363
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:21,300
Wait, wait, wait.

2364
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:36,600
He's looking at us!

2365
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:39,520
He's looking at us!

2366
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:40,400
If

2367
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:52,600
you want to learn more about Dreadsformers, I would recommend checking Chris McFeely's The Basics.

2368
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:57,800
He has over 250 videos explaining almost everything about Dreadsformers.

2369
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,040
250 videos.

2370
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:03,440
It's gonna take me like a whole year to get through.

2371
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,240
But thank you!

2372
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:10,700
Teeny tiny baby bee.

2373
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:14,200
I'm searching?

2374
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:17,560
It doesn't work!

2375
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:18,920
Leave it to me!

2376
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:24,010
Protect Wheeljack.

2377
02:20:34,890 --> 02:20:37,950
I need to...

2378
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:38,610
Go into...

2379
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:40,010
Crazy mode.

2380
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:45,460
I missed my chance!

2381
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:55,880
Nice.

2382
02:20:58,340 --> 02:20:59,180
Back attack!

2383
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:03,620
I could've done another back attack.

2384
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,620
Hey, I'm right here!

2385
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:06,960
I'm right here!

2386
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:08,480
Stop trying to attack him instead!

2387
02:21:15,550 --> 02:21:17,990
I was right there and he was ignoring me.

2388
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,930
What a jerk.

2389
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:22,070
These guys.

2390
02:21:24,450 --> 02:21:26,030
Good job, Optimus.

2391
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:27,190
I also shoot him.

2392
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:31,150
I hit them both not bad.

2393
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:34,770
Oh no, the claw!

2394
02:21:36,390 --> 02:21:37,250
What the?

2395
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:38,890
You guys were hiding in there the whole time?

2396
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:46,410
I'm trying!

2397
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:54,780
I'm assisting you!

2398
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,560
I'm assisting you!

2399
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:00,560
I'm assisting!

2400
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:03,840
Do you need any more assistance?

2401
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:07,180
Holy moly.

2402
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:09,260
Where are they?

2403
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:09,940
Oh you?

2404
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:10,740
Oh shoot.

2405
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,300
How am I supposed to...

2406
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:14,260
Are

2407
02:22:20,810 --> 02:22:21,590
you good?

2408
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:22,850
Oh, he's not good.

2409
02:22:23,530 --> 02:22:26,110
I gotta

2410
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:31,680
get...

2411
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:35,960
Nice!

2412
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:39,120
Ok, that didn't work, but that's ok.

2413
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:40,280
We still got...

2414
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,800
Who was shooting him?

2415
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:54,480
Who was shooting him?

2416
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,500
Oh, it's this guy.

2417
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:57,120
Oh my god.

2418
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:57,920
Ok.

2419
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:04,200
My car attack doesn't really quite work.

2420
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:05,040
But that's ok.

2421
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:05,800
Oh, I got him.

2422
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:06,660
I got his ass.

2423
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:13,440
I thought I had killed him.

2424
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:19,890
Phase 3?

2425
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:22,430
Give me my...

2426
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:25,370
My riches first?

2427
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:28,330
Wait, there's another guy.

2428
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:29,910
He's over here?

2429
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:31,470
Oh!

2430
02:23:32,810 --> 02:23:33,390
Hello.

2431
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,200
Oh, really?

2432
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:43,940
You can use it?

2433
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:52,110
We destroyed it?

2434
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:52,990
We're too good.

2435
02:23:58,180 --> 02:23:59,120
Another claw.

2436
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,140
I'm out.

2437
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:02,880
Oh gosh.

2438
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:05,980
Ok, hold on.

2439
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,460
Let's try using...

2440
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:09,340
No!

2441
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:12,920
Nice.

2442
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:14,480
No!

2443
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:28,440
Wheeljack!

2444
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:30,500
Ok.

2445
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:33,940
Alright, it's...

2446
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:35,260
I gotta be more...

2447
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:36,760
I gotta get my higher priorities.

2448
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:39,660
Higher priorities.

2449
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:43,160
It appears we have company.

2450
02:24:57,460 --> 02:25:01,120
I was not as smooth with this one as I was before, but that's ok.

2451
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:04,060
Nice.

2452
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,160
Back attack!

2453
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:12,860
Back attack!

2454
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:15,520
Ok, this guy.

2455
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:16,000
Alright.

2456
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:21,440
Ok, that's one.

2457
02:25:26,210 --> 02:25:26,610
Ah!

2458
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:27,290
Shoot.

2459
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:27,830
There we go.

2460
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:29,250
Ok, we got him.

2461
02:25:30,210 --> 02:25:30,530
Ok.

2462
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:33,210
Good job, guys.

2463
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:34,370
Teamwork.

2464
02:25:35,130 --> 02:25:36,070
The music bugged.

2465
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:37,390
What happened to the OST?

2466
02:25:40,510 --> 02:25:42,870
I'm gonna turn it down real quick, you guys, cause I'm scared.

2467
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:43,890
What if the...

2468
02:25:43,890 --> 02:25:45,010
What if it gets really loud again?

2469
02:25:45,050 --> 02:25:45,710
What if it bugs again?

2470
02:25:46,730 --> 02:25:48,590
I wonder why it's bugging so much though.

2471
02:25:51,210 --> 02:25:51,770
Oh.

2472
02:25:51,770 --> 02:25:52,030
Oh!

2473
02:26:08,810 --> 02:26:09,370
Ok.

2474
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:10,450
Here we go.

2475
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:12,730
Oh.

2476
02:26:13,010 --> 02:26:13,730
I'm an idiot.

2477
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,930
I'm so dumb.

2478
02:26:15,430 --> 02:26:16,930
I was already behind him!

2479
02:26:17,890 --> 02:26:18,390
No!

2480
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:22,390
Please!

2481
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:23,130
What are you doing?

2482
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:25,110
Ok, I'm not bothering with you.

2483
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:26,750
I'm not bothering with you.

2484
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:27,890
Ok.

2485
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:30,960
Attack!

2486
02:26:31,460 --> 02:26:32,320
Oh god.

2487
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:36,360
This sounds so... This is so lame.

2488
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:37,220
There's no music.

2489
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:40,740
Stop living!

2490
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,400
Oh my god.

2491
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:47,920
There we go.

2492
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:48,780
Ok, that's one.

2493
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:51,980
Wheeljack is already at... You guys, this is so impossible.

2494
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:54,280
He's already at 50% health.

2495
02:26:58,580 --> 02:26:59,140
No!

2496
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:01,300
Get this guy some health!

2497
02:27:13,330 --> 02:27:15,030
I can't even sing anything.

2498
02:27:15,150 --> 02:27:16,290
I'm too focused.

2499
02:27:17,390 --> 02:27:18,630
I'm too focused.

2500
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:22,110
He's just blasting away.

2501
02:27:24,130 --> 02:27:24,710
Ok.

2502
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:27,490
Ok, phase 3.

2503
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:34,090
Nice.

2504
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:36,690
That was easy.

2505
02:27:39,370 --> 02:27:40,830
Oh, he's back to full health.

2506
02:27:40,910 --> 02:27:41,350
Ok, perfect.

2507
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:47,040
Alright.

2508
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:47,960
That's one guy.

2509
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:53,120
Oh...

2510
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:55,260
Ok,

2511
02:27:58,570 --> 02:27:59,290
that's another guy.

2512
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,510
You?

2513
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:07,860
What do you mean?

2514
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:08,580
What do you mean by that?

2515
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:12,200
Claws?

2516
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:14,400
I'm taking care of everything else here.

2517
02:28:15,180 --> 02:28:15,840
Excuse me.

2518
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:20,800
What claws?

2519
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,960
Oh, that claw.

2520
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:24,300
Shit.

2521
02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:28,300
I don't want to redo.

2522
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:28,800
Please.

2523
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:31,140
Ok,

2524
02:28:41,710 --> 02:28:43,450
he's not that on health at least.

2525
02:28:45,370 --> 02:28:45,670
Ok.

2526
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:48,810
Oh my goodness.

2527
02:28:49,570 --> 02:28:50,510
That was so scary.

2528
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:53,910
Oh gosh.

2529
02:28:55,650 --> 02:28:56,570
We good?

2530
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:58,670
Everything alright over here?

2531
02:29:12,970 --> 02:29:13,750
Where'd you come from?

2532
02:29:15,010 --> 02:29:16,210
Where'd that guy come from?

2533
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:16,990
For real.

2534
02:29:18,310 --> 02:29:18,570
Ok.

2535
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:20,290
Good job everybody.

2536
02:29:20,990 --> 02:29:21,650
Good job.

2537
02:29:22,370 --> 02:29:23,590
I didn't even notice that guy.

2538
02:29:24,910 --> 02:29:25,590
To be honest.

2539
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:27,590
I'm turning the volume back up.

2540
02:29:37,650 --> 02:29:38,690
Our music.

2541
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:44,310
Oh my god.

2542
02:29:44,510 --> 02:29:45,130
Is it just me?

2543
02:29:45,550 --> 02:29:46,370
Am I the only one here?

2544
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:47,610
Oh my god.

2545
02:29:50,950 --> 02:29:51,970
I'm the only one here.

2546
02:29:52,270 --> 02:29:53,150
I'm the only one here.

2547
02:29:53,430 --> 02:29:54,310
I'm the only one here.

2548
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:08,680
I'm trying to fight.

2549
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:09,240
I'm trying...

2550
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:13,360
Nice.

2551
02:30:15,220 --> 02:30:15,620
Next!

2552
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:18,340
The menu.

2553
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:21,300
I think we have to go back to the main menu.

2554
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:23,020
It's ok.

2555
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:26,160
After this.

2556
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:32,240
Nice.

2557
02:30:33,460 --> 02:30:34,260
Nice.

2558
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:35,480
Nice.

2559
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:41,290
Nice.

2560
02:30:41,730 --> 02:30:42,130
Nice.

2561
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:43,370
See ya.

2562
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:51,660
Oh shoot.

2563
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:52,440
I missed my chance.

2564
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:53,720
I missed my opportunity.

2565
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,500
Ouch.

2566
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:04,220
Where

2567
02:31:11,630 --> 02:31:13,190
are you?

2568
02:31:14,330 --> 02:31:15,330
There you are.

2569
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:18,070
One more.

2570
02:31:18,910 --> 02:31:19,710
Got him.

2571
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:25,650
Transformers ASMR.

2572
02:31:26,610 --> 02:31:30,370
I gotta go do melee on him.

2573
02:31:41,930 --> 02:31:42,490
Ouch, ouch.

2574
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:56,900
See ya.

2575
02:31:58,840 --> 02:31:59,920
Yeah, we got him.

2576
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:05,520
After this...

2577
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:07,020
I guess we'll go back to the main menu?

2578
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:09,840
Oh no!

2579
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:10,840
We have music again!

2580
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:16,980
Anything here?

2581
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:18,440
No.

2582
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:19,900
Anything over here?

2583
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:22,320
No.

2584
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:24,620
The BGM is back.

2585
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:26,440
Why is it so buggy today?

2586
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:26,780
I wonder.

2587
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:48,160
Wait, can I blow these up instead?

2588
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:50,240
I should have blown those up.

2589
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:54,240
Oh, it didn't even work.

2590
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:54,940
That's so lame.

2591
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:56,960
So lame.

2592
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:04,720
Ok, more money.

2593
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:07,280
Have a sneeze?

2594
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:08,320
No.

2595
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:12,600
Looks like my eyes are just a little bit dry.

2596
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:16,280
Sentry bot, attack mode.

2597
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:17,540
Where?

2598
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:19,540
Where are you at?

2599
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:26,460
I remember this was where we tried to do that...

2600
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:29,860
Oh, it won't even let you this time.

2601
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:32,820
Remember we tried to... Oh wait, will it?

2602
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:33,420
I wonder.

2603
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:39,120
Oh, it doesn't.

2604
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:43,760
We defeated the Decepticons and took back the music, baby!

2605
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,340
Why did I do that?

2606
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:48,940
Hello?

2607
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:56,980
Oh my god.

2608
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,990
Oh, ok, it's a timed attack.

2609
02:34:03,890 --> 02:34:04,750
Let me do...

2610
02:34:07,350 --> 02:34:08,750
No, let's go...

2611
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:10,750
I wonder though if it would be easier with like...

2612
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:14,820
Like that.

2613
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:15,580
Yeah.

2614
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:17,760
Way easier.

2615
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:20,580
Way,

2616
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,280
way easier.

2617
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:36,880
Boss!

2618
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:44,040
I don't like that.

2619
02:34:46,580 --> 02:34:47,420
Ok.

2620
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:49,520
Oh my god.

2621
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:55,030
Ok, I can't... Oh!

2622
02:34:58,350 --> 02:34:59,510
Oh shit!

2623
02:35:02,090 --> 02:35:03,450
Give me a second!

2624
02:35:08,490 --> 02:35:09,850
It's so...

2625
02:35:10,850 --> 02:35:11,890
Oh, nice!

2626
02:35:21,130 --> 02:35:23,550
I missed... Oh, I got it still.

2627
02:35:23,890 --> 02:35:24,210
Nice.

2628
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:34,780
We made it!

2629
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,400
We're fine!

2630
02:35:41,390 --> 02:35:42,690
Silly sound wave.

2631
02:35:45,970 --> 02:35:48,850
Whoever wished sound wave to come back, you're welcome.

2632
02:35:49,490 --> 02:35:51,510
Here it comes, I guess.

2633
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:54,490
Who's targeting me?

2634
02:35:59,070 --> 02:36:00,510
Is this something to search?

2635
02:36:00,770 --> 02:36:01,230
It is.

2636
02:36:01,810 --> 02:36:02,810
I did something.

2637
02:36:04,830 --> 02:36:06,350
Oh, I got these working again.

2638
02:36:06,730 --> 02:36:11,950
So I guess if we wanted to do this mission... Oh, do all this again.

2639
02:36:12,510 --> 02:36:13,550
I see, I see.

2640
02:36:15,070 --> 02:36:15,890
It's all back.

2641
02:36:32,750 --> 02:36:33,350
Oh gosh.

2642
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:52,730
Oh shoot!

2643
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:53,610
Oh no!

2644
02:36:54,050 --> 02:36:55,170
Oh god, am I gonna die?

2645
02:36:56,370 --> 02:36:57,330
Am I gonna die here?

2646
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:03,800
I wish I could heal.

2647
02:37:04,260 --> 02:37:05,260
Oh, I think I killed all of them.

2648
02:37:05,880 --> 02:37:06,440
Yeah, I got them.

2649
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:08,060
Kind of.

2650
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:09,540
Like, most of them.

2651
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:13,100
I wish I could heal!

2652
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:13,120
No!

2653
02:37:16,380 --> 02:37:17,260
Roll out.

2654
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:21,800
Is it this guy?

2655
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:24,160
Yeah, it's that guy.

2656
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,040
Got him.

2657
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,020
There's more of them.

2658
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:31,220
Okay, hold on.

2659
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,580
We're gonna take out this.

2660
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:35,900
And then we're gonna do this.

2661
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:38,240
And we're gonna go in for an epic...

2662
02:37:44,170 --> 02:37:45,910
Where the hell did you come in?

2663
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,800
Guys, I'm almost dead.

2664
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:09,360
Guys?

2665
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,780
Bumblebee is almost bumble done.

2666
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:15,940
There's nothing over here.

2667
02:38:19,660 --> 02:38:20,500
Repair kit?

2668
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:21,500
I can't use it!

2669
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:23,700
I can't use it!

2670
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:26,840
Dang.

2671
02:38:28,220 --> 02:38:30,680
I can't heal while I'm in this mode.

2672
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:31,960
Actually, hold on.

2673
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:37,060
If we enter the arc and then leave, I wonder...

2674
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:38,780
If it counts as a heal.

2675
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:45,550
It should?

2676
02:38:46,070 --> 02:38:46,490
Awesome.

2677
02:38:49,210 --> 02:38:49,970
Let's see.

2678
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:54,530
What if I develop one more technique?

2679
02:38:55,930 --> 02:38:58,210
I gotta test my luck.

2680
02:38:58,750 --> 02:38:59,890
And my skill.

2681
02:39:00,810 --> 02:39:02,250
Reversal power up.

2682
02:39:02,830 --> 02:39:03,830
What the hell does that mean?

2683
02:39:09,770 --> 02:39:12,130
I might need to go get my eye drops.

2684
02:39:18,150 --> 02:39:20,250
Let's synthesize our drills.

2685
02:39:22,310 --> 02:39:23,030
But with what?

2686
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:25,490
We'll just get the power... What's it called?

2687
02:39:26,810 --> 02:39:28,070
We'll just get the level up.

2688
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:30,510
I like using these a lot though.

2689
02:39:32,670 --> 02:39:34,250
But we'll keep the same skills.

2690
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:36,090
Nice.

2691
02:39:37,850 --> 02:39:38,290
Heal.

2692
02:39:38,290 --> 02:39:41,630
And let's just use some of the...

2693
02:39:42,290 --> 02:39:44,250
The stinky weapons.

2694
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:45,670
Like this one.

2695
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:47,990
Oh, nevermind.

2696
02:39:48,130 --> 02:39:49,070
We'll use the butter weapons.

2697
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:55,200
This one.

2698
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,000
Yeah.

2699
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:02,080
Those big ol' eyes have plenty of surface area for moisture loss.

2700
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:04,200
Could be dry winter air with the weather.

2701
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:05,360
Maybe not.

2702
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:07,720
It's been cold.

2703
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:08,860
Cold.

2704
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:11,520
It's been cold, cold.

2705
02:40:22,810 --> 02:40:23,910
I can buy moves!

2706
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:28,740
Did I know this?

2707
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:29,620
I did know this.

2708
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:33,200
I literally bought a move.

2709
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:36,520
I knew this.

2710
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:40,020
Bubble Beast sure likes putting his arms up behind his head.

2711
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,640
Haha, what if Minto did that too?

2712
02:40:47,770 --> 02:40:50,070
Hold square, triangle, or L2.

2713
02:40:51,770 --> 02:40:53,350
I could buy more!

2714
02:41:02,740 --> 02:41:04,700
Oh, if only I had 40,000.

2715
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:07,980
It's my fault for gambling.

2716
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:12,880
It's my fault for gambling.

2717
02:41:12,980 --> 02:41:14,200
I'm gonna give reversal though.

2718
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:19,460
So Bumblebee is your character of choice?

2719
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:20,700
He's just so zippy!

2720
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:22,380
It's so fun to play as him, you know?

2721
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,820
Rush combo and burnout?

2722
02:41:27,820 --> 02:41:28,200
What?

2723
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:30,440
What about him?

2724
02:41:34,010 --> 02:41:35,270
I don't feel like I'd use this.

2725
02:41:36,050 --> 02:41:37,430
I don't feel like I'd use burnout.

2726
02:41:38,510 --> 02:41:42,530
Reach top speed in a vehicle mode, hold triangle, then mash it to perform a flip.

2727
02:41:43,650 --> 02:41:45,070
Cannot be used by Grimlock.

2728
02:41:45,270 --> 02:41:46,210
That's so sad.

2729
02:41:52,990 --> 02:41:56,250
I feel like, like I said, I go into focus so much.

2730
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:57,310
Is there shove?

2731
02:41:58,470 --> 02:42:00,290
Quickly tilt the movement...

2732
02:42:00,290 --> 02:42:01,670
First of all, spin attack.

2733
02:42:03,730 --> 02:42:04,170
Parry.

2734
02:42:04,810 --> 02:42:06,090
Parry or reversal?

2735
02:42:10,810 --> 02:42:12,290
Rush combo is fine.

2736
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:15,450
I could probably use that.

2737
02:42:15,650 --> 02:42:16,390
Okay, we'll get that.

2738
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:17,310
And then...

2739
02:42:18,050 --> 02:42:19,370
Either parry or reversal.

2740
02:42:21,370 --> 02:42:22,650
Parry the platypus!

2741
02:42:24,450 --> 02:42:24,910
Yeah.

2742
02:42:26,910 --> 02:42:27,810
Reversal is good for you.

2743
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:28,750
Parry means not dodging.

2744
02:42:28,910 --> 02:42:29,590
So true!

2745
02:42:30,490 --> 02:42:31,230
So true.

2746
02:42:31,370 --> 02:42:31,970
Let's do reversal.

2747
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:33,110
Alright.

2748
02:42:34,510 --> 02:42:35,430
Hold square...

2749
02:42:35,430 --> 02:42:37,070
Okay, I have to hold it.

2750
02:42:37,330 --> 02:42:39,070
Hold square, triangle or L2.

2751
02:42:39,330 --> 02:42:40,470
Okay, I have to hold it.

2752
02:42:40,590 --> 02:42:41,290
I have to hold it.

2753
02:42:41,590 --> 02:42:43,170
Alright, we got some new stuff, baby!

2754
02:42:43,790 --> 02:42:46,790
So now we have the max speed and then I mash triangle.

2755
02:42:49,850 --> 02:42:50,770
And then...

2756
02:42:50,770 --> 02:42:51,210
Hold on.

2757
02:42:51,210 --> 02:42:52,350
Oh wait.

2758
02:42:52,910 --> 02:42:54,050
Can I sell moves?

2759
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:54,930
No.

2760
02:42:58,770 --> 02:42:59,810
But then...

2761
02:42:59,810 --> 02:43:01,210
If I...

2762
02:43:01,770 --> 02:43:02,390
It is triangle.

2763
02:43:02,490 --> 02:43:02,650
Okay.

2764
02:43:02,990 --> 02:43:03,790
Then hold triangle.

2765
02:43:03,890 --> 02:43:05,970
I'm just gonna do triangle with everything so I can remember.

2766
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:07,190
Let's try it.

2767
02:43:17,330 --> 02:43:18,230
Energon cubes.

2768
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:22,910
Meow.

2769
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,000
Wait, my dramatic entrance.

2770
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:30,760
Soundwave!

2771
02:43:53,060 --> 02:43:55,500
A darkness fell over him.

2772
02:43:56,360 --> 02:43:57,200
Burrowed in time.

2773
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:00,280
Something corrupted him.

2774
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:02,220
Driving him mad.

2775
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:05,780
He did come here to destroy Earth.

2776
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:09,760
But only after encountering some singular entity.

2777
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:13,280
Something bent not just on destruction.

2778
02:44:14,020 --> 02:44:15,640
But our destruction.

2779
02:44:17,140 --> 02:44:19,960
And Nova Prime sent it in our direction.

2780
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:21,960
It's out there now.

2781
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:24,960
Searching and destroying its way to Cybertron.

2782
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:26,860
Nova Prime?

2783
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:28,340
One of our own?

2784
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,220
Really went bad on us?

2785
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:32,000
It appears so.

2786
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:35,900
Teletran-1, find us a way to the control room.

2787
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:39,400
This cargo lift can be used to reach the control room.

2788
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:43,540
I do not have enough access to tell you how to operate the platform, however.

2789
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:44,480
Okay.

2790
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:45,840
Oh, just shoot it.

2791
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:46,540
So true.

2792
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:49,220
That should do it.

2793
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:52,060
Yeah!

2794
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:56,100
Oh boy.

2795
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:57,280
Uh-oh.

2796
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:58,380
This is not good.

2797
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:03,400
Smash, smash, smash, smash!

2798
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:04,800
Oh, dang it.

2799
02:45:05,080 --> 02:45:05,720
I missed it.

2800
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:10,360
Yeah, you know what?

2801
02:45:10,380 --> 02:45:10,940
I will do that.

2802
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:15,340
It's back attack!

2803
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:17,560
Wait, I forgot to hold.

2804
02:45:20,660 --> 02:45:21,140
Oh?

2805
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:36,380
Thank you.

2806
02:45:52,230 --> 02:45:53,250
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2807
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:56,690
Oh my gosh.

2808
02:45:56,930 --> 02:45:58,290
Oh my gosh, I'm getting thrown everywhere.

2809
02:46:01,210 --> 02:46:02,530
I'm getting thrown everywhere!

2810
02:46:03,610 --> 02:46:04,130
Oop!

2811
02:46:05,190 --> 02:46:05,590
Oop!

2812
02:46:05,930 --> 02:46:06,130
Oop!

2813
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:16,030
Give me my stuff!

2814
02:46:17,150 --> 02:46:18,010
Ah, dammit.

2815
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:19,410
I tried to do the new attack.

2816
02:46:19,830 --> 02:46:20,730
Hold on, let's try it again.

2817
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:26,480
Dang it.

2818
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:43,590
Oh gosh.

2819
02:46:44,450 --> 02:46:48,710
What weapon am I using right now?

2820
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:07,000
What was I using?

2821
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:10,400
It was... Oh, the sword.

2822
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:13,760
We will arrive any moment now.

2823
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:16,400
And Megatron is waiting for us.

2824
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:18,980
Be ready for anything.

2825
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:21,240
No, Soundwave is fine.

2826
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:22,140
He's alright.

2827
02:47:22,680 --> 02:47:24,480
He's just... you know.

2828
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:26,520
He's cool.

2829
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:28,800
Oh my gosh, that was chapter 6?

2830
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:30,360
And I got an A.

2831
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:35,740
Last chapter everybody.

2832
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:38,600
Last chapter.

2833
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:40,740
Let's go!

2834
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:45,340
Loudspeaker!

2835
02:47:49,820 --> 02:47:51,520
Mess him up, Mito.

2836
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:54,740
Sorry I haven't been doing much of the side missions.

2837
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:56,080
I just...

2838
02:47:56,920 --> 02:47:58,060
I'm not good at them.

2839
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:01,200
It's a really good gun, isn't it?

2840
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:02,400
Let's equip it.

2841
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:06,020
Maybe we'll use that instead of the cryo gun.

2842
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:09,900
Where is it?

2843
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:11,520
Oh, Loudspeaker.

2844
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:16,920
Let's, um...

2845
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:17,840
Synthesize!

2846
02:48:22,350 --> 02:48:24,950
You can sunlock enemies with it, but short range.

2847
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:26,070
Ok, short range weapon.

2848
02:48:26,390 --> 02:48:27,170
I see, I see, I see.

2849
02:48:29,350 --> 02:48:32,650
Transformers has crossed over with my My Little Pony and also my Mazinger Z.

2850
02:48:35,910 --> 02:48:39,170
Wait, Transformers has crossed over with My Little Pony...

2851
02:48:39,170 --> 02:48:41,430
I feel like Mazinger makes sense though, right?

2852
02:48:42,430 --> 02:48:43,770
I built giant robots.

2853
02:48:45,930 --> 02:48:50,290
When Grimlock was first created, he was so primitive, he and the other Dinobots...

2854
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:51,390
Turned on their creator.

2855
02:48:51,970 --> 02:48:55,470
They literally had to upgrade his brain to get it functioning like a normal person.

2856
02:48:57,490 --> 02:49:00,210
My Little Pony also makes sense too though, because it's Hasbro.

2857
02:49:00,930 --> 02:49:01,330
Right?

2858
02:49:02,670 --> 02:49:04,830
He's a communications officer and spy master.

2859
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:09,410
He doesn't really fight much, except in the Prime show, where he took a vow of silence and whooped butt.

2860
02:49:11,190 --> 02:49:14,790
One of Soundwave's most popular ships is with Hatsune Miku.

2861
02:49:16,950 --> 02:49:18,530
That's so beautiful.

2862
02:49:20,510 --> 02:49:21,950
That's beautiful.

2863
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:25,410
Let's do...

2864
02:49:25,410 --> 02:49:27,310
Is knockdown just for like...

2865
02:49:27,310 --> 02:49:28,230
Oh wait, my bad.

2866
02:49:32,730 --> 02:49:33,770
Loudspeaker letters.

2867
02:49:35,770 --> 02:49:38,910
Is knockdown just for melee weapon?

2868
02:49:39,430 --> 02:49:40,790
Wait, I want to know what it is.

2869
02:49:40,850 --> 02:49:42,590
I want to know what it is.

2870
02:49:48,860 --> 02:49:49,600
Let's see.

2871
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:53,020
Accuracy fire rate.

2872
02:49:53,460 --> 02:49:56,540
Oh no, this is my... I don't want to get rid of it just yet.

2873
02:49:58,240 --> 02:49:59,160
Bolt cost.

2874
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:01,000
We'll do this.

2875
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,180
Synthesizing.

2876
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:10,400
Oh, I have to be careful though.

2877
02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:11,440
Oh, synthesis 101.

2878
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:12,220
I got a trophy.

2879
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:12,680
That's cool.

2880
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:16,600
I have to be careful though of my money.

2881
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:20,080
We'll give it one more.

2882
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:25,800
Maybe like... What do I have on it right now?

2883
02:50:26,480 --> 02:50:26,960
Bolt cost.

2884
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:27,300
OK.

2885
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,180
What's over... Oh no, that's...

2886
02:50:33,860 --> 02:50:34,580
Focus plus.

2887
02:50:34,780 --> 02:50:35,360
We'll do this one.

2888
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:42,640
Yes.

2889
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:43,600
Alright.

2890
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:45,260
Alright.

2891
02:50:45,740 --> 02:50:49,260
I'm going to miss having so many shots, but whatever.

2892
02:50:49,740 --> 02:50:50,560
I just have to get good.

2893
02:50:51,100 --> 02:50:52,220
I just have to get good.

2894
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:53,020
How many...

2895
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:54,840
It doesn't say.

2896
02:50:58,440 --> 02:50:59,020
Alright.

2897
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:00,560
Alright.

2898
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:01,320
Let's go.

2899
02:51:03,740 --> 02:51:04,680
Get good.

2900
02:51:07,980 --> 02:51:09,660
We're going to be a gamer.

2901
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:14,900
It hardly matters now.

2902
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:18,540
Decepticons keep them busy.

2903
02:51:18,980 --> 02:51:20,260
We've almost won.

2904
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:22,000
We are almost there.

2905
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:24,960
Time to crash the party.

2906
02:51:25,220 --> 02:51:25,920
Oh yeah.

2907
02:51:26,460 --> 02:51:28,540
Look how cool comm collective we look.

2908
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:39,320
Is it a controversial opinion if I say that I'm not really super fan of this Megatron's voice?

2909
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:40,960
Is that a controversial opinion?

2910
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:48,680
Oh.

2911
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:49,040
Oopsie.

2912
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:50,340
Oh, I did kill him.

2913
02:51:50,480 --> 02:51:50,800
Just kidding.

2914
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:53,940
No.

2915
02:51:55,540 --> 02:51:58,400
Yeah, I know it's the original VA, so I'm not like...

2916
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:00,620
I'm not like, oh, it's the worst ever.

2917
02:52:02,820 --> 02:52:04,600
I just feel, you know...

2918
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:08,720
Nice.

2919
02:52:11,580 --> 02:52:12,260
Oh, OK.

2920
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:12,860
So easy.

2921
02:52:12,860 --> 02:52:12,900
Easy.

2922
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:20,280
I just imagine always Megatron to have more of a deeper, like...

2923
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:22,100
Yes.

2924
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:23,920
You know, kind of voice.

2925
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:26,080
This voice has ruined me, maybe.

2926
02:52:27,500 --> 02:52:30,040
OK, we don't want to waste it.

2927
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:33,060
Everybody...

2928
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:34,960
Just stop.

2929
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:36,740
You can hear them behind me.

2930
02:52:38,660 --> 02:52:41,080
You guys, just avoid it.

2931
02:52:42,860 --> 02:52:46,860
You guys, just avoid it.

2932
02:52:53,540 --> 02:52:54,220
Nice.

2933
02:52:54,220 --> 02:52:55,360
Maybe not nice.

2934
02:52:57,740 --> 02:53:00,000
Why am I not on my drills?

2935
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:01,060
Oh gosh.

2936
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:16,510
I think we got him.

2937
02:53:17,190 --> 02:53:17,970
I think we got him.

2938
02:53:18,670 --> 02:53:20,230
I didn't have to do anything.

2939
02:53:22,630 --> 02:53:23,190
Yay.

2940
02:53:27,490 --> 02:53:27,810
No.

2941
02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:33,990
Let's get our cash money, baby.

2942
02:53:36,770 --> 02:53:37,730
Repair kit.

2943
02:53:38,570 --> 02:53:40,790
Just kind of useless to me, but that's OK.

2944
02:53:41,070 --> 02:53:42,270
Hold on, I'm getting my money.

2945
02:53:43,310 --> 02:53:44,330
Get my money.

2946
02:53:44,970 --> 02:53:45,910
Get my money.

2947
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:46,290
OK.

2948
02:53:47,770 --> 02:53:48,210
OK.

2949
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:50,830
Stand back, everybody.

2950
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:53,770
I've got this.

2951
02:53:59,830 --> 02:54:00,870
I missed one.

2952
02:54:02,250 --> 02:54:02,970
You're welcome, though.

2953
02:54:05,590 --> 02:54:06,290
It's a bit dated.

2954
02:54:06,410 --> 02:54:08,590
That's why Frank Welker updated in Transformers Prime.

2955
02:54:09,350 --> 02:54:10,810
His best work IMO.

2956
02:54:11,910 --> 02:54:17,030
I like to think it was an F you to Michael Bay for not casting him as Megatron in the first three movies.

2957
02:54:17,530 --> 02:54:17,990
Oh, maybe.

2958
02:54:19,970 --> 02:54:20,490
Wah!

2959
02:54:28,270 --> 02:54:29,670
Who am I fighting?

2960
02:54:32,070 --> 02:54:32,930
Motor Master!

2961
02:54:33,910 --> 02:54:37,590
Oh no, am I going to have to fight the transformed ones again?

2962
02:54:40,330 --> 02:54:41,370
I can't...

2963
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:42,890
Shoot.

2964
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:54,440
Oh, that didn't work.

2965
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:04,900
Oh, come on.

2966
02:55:04,980 --> 02:55:05,680
It's so fast.

2967
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:08,980
It's so awesome watching Optimus fight.

2968
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,380
Just a few more.

2969
02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:48,740
Oh, just kidding.

2970
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:53,900
I didn't do so hot with that one.

2971
02:55:54,020 --> 02:55:54,620
That's OK, though.

2972
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:55,660
That's OK.

2973
02:55:56,520 --> 02:55:56,900
It's alright.

2974
02:55:56,900 --> 02:55:59,340
Oh my god.

2975
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:01,500
We've taken all of what he's worth.

2976
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:05,760
Take everything that he owns.

2977
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:15,620
Where are they?

2978
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:16,680
Those Seekers?

2979
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:31,500
I keep forgetting the focus attack that we have to do.

2980
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:35,880
Hold on.

2981
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:36,680
There we go.

2982
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:38,080
It's hold, right?

2983
02:56:38,420 --> 02:56:38,800
Oh, shoot.

2984
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:40,540
We were still in...

2985
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:42,220
I'm holding!

2986
02:56:42,740 --> 02:56:43,380
It didn't work!

2987
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:45,340
I think I did it wrong!

2988
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:48,140
I did it wrong.

2989
02:56:49,960 --> 02:56:50,640
Oh, shoot.

2990
02:56:50,860 --> 02:56:51,160
Oh, shoot.

2991
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:51,560
Oh, shoot.

2992
02:57:01,650 --> 02:57:02,830
Oh my goodness.

2993
02:57:03,730 --> 02:57:04,870
I wish I could heal right now.

2994
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:07,970
You guys do everything.

2995
02:57:08,150 --> 02:57:09,130
I'll just collect the money.

2996
02:57:14,160 --> 02:57:15,880
It has to be the first thing you do.

2997
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:16,220
OK.

2998
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:19,000
So I focus and then I hold triangle.

2999
02:57:29,140 --> 02:57:29,540
Onwards!

3000
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:31,780
Oh, I missed one.

3001
02:57:42,310 --> 02:57:42,490
Mew!

3002
02:57:42,810 --> 02:57:43,090
Mew!

3003
02:57:43,850 --> 02:57:44,310
Mew!

3004
02:57:44,630 --> 02:57:45,010
Mew!

3005
02:57:45,510 --> 02:57:45,890
Mew!

3006
02:57:57,270 --> 02:57:58,390
I lived.

3007
02:58:08,430 --> 02:58:11,950
This is not the time to be so nonchalant, I think.

3008
02:58:12,190 --> 02:58:14,030
Holy cow, there is so much stuff on the field.

3009
02:58:15,470 --> 02:58:16,690
Grab it all, you guys!

3010
02:58:16,730 --> 02:58:17,390
What are you doing?

3011
02:58:17,830 --> 02:58:19,470
There is so much money here!

3012
02:58:20,570 --> 02:58:21,890
Grab it all!

3013
02:58:22,990 --> 02:58:25,230
We are losing our cash!

3014
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:30,650
They are like, Bumblebee, what are you doing?

3015
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:34,730
I'm doing what... Who pays for these upgrades?

3016
02:58:35,170 --> 02:58:36,330
It's me!

3017
02:58:39,170 --> 02:58:40,230
What's this?

3018
02:58:41,630 --> 02:58:42,110
Yes!

3019
02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:46,730
OK.

3020
02:58:54,510 --> 02:58:54,950
Yeah!

3021
02:58:58,730 --> 02:59:00,330
I don't think I should be here.

3022
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:06,030
Oh shoot.

3023
02:59:06,350 --> 02:59:06,690
Dang it.

3024
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:14,460
I'm doing my job now, this time.

3025
02:59:16,160 --> 02:59:17,360
I did my job a little bit.

3026
02:59:21,060 --> 02:59:22,940
Oh, were we supposed to go that way?

3027
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:25,440
Mysterious.

3028
02:59:25,980 --> 02:59:27,340
Were we supposed to come here first?

3029
02:59:27,860 --> 02:59:30,700
Well, I just wanted the S and the money.

3030
02:59:34,380 --> 02:59:35,320
Alright, Bumblebee.

3031
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:37,100
Collect our riches and...

3032
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:39,000
Roll out!

3033
02:59:42,850 --> 02:59:44,030
What is this spell?

3034
02:59:44,730 --> 02:59:45,450
What did we get?

3035
02:59:45,470 --> 02:59:46,110
We got M?

3036
02:59:49,430 --> 02:59:51,470
Don't tell me it's transformers.

3037
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:57,500
Everybody here?

3038
02:59:58,280 --> 02:59:59,340
Nobody got hurt, right?

3039
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:01,580
I'm pretty hurt though, I'm not gonna lie.

3040
03:00:02,420 --> 03:00:03,980
That wasn't at you, don't worry.

3041
03:00:05,540 --> 03:00:07,240
It does spell transformers?

3042
03:00:08,620 --> 03:00:10,200
Would you be shocked if it is?

3043
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:16,100
I would think... I thought... I don't know actually.

3044
03:00:21,560 --> 03:00:22,440
Goodbye everybody!

3045
03:00:25,280 --> 03:00:26,580
Oh, that was so lame.

3046
03:00:32,450 --> 03:00:33,490
Dang it!

3047
03:00:37,030 --> 03:00:38,950
You are right in front of me.

3048
03:00:39,270 --> 03:00:43,990
Good job guys!

3049
03:00:44,150 --> 03:00:44,390
Wow!

3050
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:48,250
What's great is that the team really holds their own, huh?

3051
03:00:50,170 --> 03:00:51,350
It spells Mintoes.

3052
03:00:52,350 --> 03:00:52,870
Obviously.

3053
03:00:56,930 --> 03:00:58,070
I might though.

3054
03:01:01,050 --> 03:01:02,950
Optimism ain't looking so hot for me.

3055
03:01:04,090 --> 03:01:07,070
It ain't looking so good for me.

3056
03:01:13,890 --> 03:01:14,850
Just go!

3057
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:23,490
Oh, I'm so dead.

3058
03:01:24,530 --> 03:01:25,390
Hi Thundercracker!

3059
03:01:33,310 --> 03:01:34,470
Where is everybody?

3060
03:01:36,190 --> 03:01:37,270
I'm dead.

3061
03:01:39,830 --> 03:01:42,410
I wonder where the last checkpoint was.

3062
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:54,680
Which one is this?

3063
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:56,800
Oh ok, we are so good.

3064
03:02:09,140 --> 03:02:09,840
Oh yeah!

3065
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:16,840
Damn, I almost had him locked... trapped in a loop!

3066
03:02:22,230 --> 03:02:24,030
Oh my god and he dodged it!

3067
03:02:28,060 --> 03:02:28,960
I did it though!

3068
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:29,500
I did it!

3069
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:33,100
I did it!

3070
03:02:33,180 --> 03:02:33,460
I did it!

3071
03:02:39,210 --> 03:02:39,630
Nice!

3072
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:50,560
Collect everything.

3073
03:02:51,180 --> 03:02:51,920
Where is he?

3074
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:00,860
Minto wins by doing nothing.

3075
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:06,860
Minto wins by doing nothing!

3076
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:11,240
Where is his stuff?

3077
03:03:14,990 --> 03:03:17,230
I took care of the other guy though, pretty much.

3078
03:03:17,850 --> 03:03:18,710
Nuh-uh, he did a flip.

3079
03:03:18,890 --> 03:03:19,650
So true.

3080
03:03:20,310 --> 03:03:21,010
Alright, let's keep going.

3081
03:03:22,330 --> 03:03:24,670
Oh my gosh, we were so close to an arc point.

3082
03:03:26,950 --> 03:03:28,310
I could have just saved in here.

3083
03:03:29,990 --> 03:03:30,690
Or healed.

3084
03:03:30,850 --> 03:03:32,150
Actually, I'll be right back.

3085
03:03:32,250 --> 03:03:33,950
One second you guys, I'm going to go grab my up-drops.

3086
03:03:34,470 --> 03:03:36,570
I'm going to grab my up-drops!

3087
03:03:37,250 --> 03:03:37,910
One second.

3088
03:03:38,810 --> 03:03:39,210
Skip.

3089
03:04:14,450 --> 03:04:16,250
Nevermind, I don't know where they are.

3090
03:04:19,250 --> 03:04:21,150
Not where I thought they were.

3091
03:04:22,210 --> 03:04:23,010
Just kidding.

3092
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:36,870
Oh my gosh, I found them!

3093
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:39,430
We also have pies in here.

3094
03:04:39,870 --> 03:04:40,970
She really wanted a cookie?

3095
03:04:46,750 --> 03:04:50,650
Earlier I heard something fall into a...

3096
03:04:50,650 --> 03:04:54,650
I have like a little basket of snacks on my computer for when I'm really hungry.

3097
03:04:56,970 --> 03:04:58,730
I heard something fall into it earlier.

3098
03:04:59,130 --> 03:05:00,270
I was like, what was that?

3099
03:05:00,690 --> 03:05:01,390
Must have been the wind.

3100
03:05:03,970 --> 03:05:05,690
But it was my up-drops.

3101
03:05:06,710 --> 03:05:08,190
Little did I know.

3102
03:05:08,750 --> 03:05:10,770
It would be something so important.

3103
03:05:16,740 --> 03:05:18,460
Trash talker like a mean girl.

3104
03:05:18,700 --> 03:05:18,720
What?

3105
03:05:20,620 --> 03:05:22,780
It's a legitimate swear word for a trash talker.

3106
03:05:23,080 --> 03:05:23,520
Slag.

3107
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:24,620
I've never heard of that before.

3108
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:29,220
I don't remember.

3109
03:05:29,360 --> 03:05:30,940
It's been a long time since I watched Beast Wars.

3110
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:34,700
Okay.

3111
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:36,080
Alright, let's continue.

3112
03:05:37,780 --> 03:05:38,660
It's brash.

3113
03:05:38,660 --> 03:05:40,320
Oh, it's brash?

3114
03:05:41,460 --> 03:05:42,620
Alright.

3115
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:44,060
Onwards.

3116
03:05:49,300 --> 03:05:51,940
There he is!

3117
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:55,900
This is it!

3118
03:05:58,760 --> 03:06:03,360
Oh, I already saw the mission.

3119
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:11,320
Ultimate victory.

3120
03:06:16,300 --> 03:06:18,500
Remaking Slag means a woman who is easy.

3121
03:06:19,740 --> 03:06:21,180
They are talking about robots with that.

3122
03:06:30,960 --> 03:06:32,080
Uh-oh.

3123
03:06:32,900 --> 03:06:33,160
Wait.

3124
03:06:34,100 --> 03:06:34,740
The Constructicons.

3125
03:06:34,760 --> 03:06:35,300
All of them?

3126
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:35,400
All of them?

3127
03:06:39,960 --> 03:06:40,760
Oh, shoot.

3128
03:06:40,820 --> 03:06:41,860
I forgot to...

3129
03:06:41,860 --> 03:06:43,900
Oh, shoot.

3130
03:06:47,600 --> 03:06:51,100
Which one of you is the dick man?

3131
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:01,280
They are all so strong.

3132
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:04,660
Oh, dang it.

3133
03:07:04,680 --> 03:07:05,100
I keep missing.

3134
03:07:14,660 --> 03:07:16,180
Oh my gosh.

3135
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:17,200
So close!

3136
03:07:36,050 --> 03:07:36,730
Oh, shit.

3137
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:49,020
I'm doing my part!

3138
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:04,240
Turn into scrap!

3139
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:07,140
I'm doing my part!

3140
03:08:09,820 --> 03:08:10,860
Holy moly.

3141
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:12,440
I've taken out a good couple of them, huh?

3142
03:08:14,760 --> 03:08:15,240
No!

3143
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:23,740
Got his little back attack.

3144
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:25,520
Oh, damn!

3145
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:28,040
I'm saving my ult, though.

3146
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:29,100
Well, I guess I could have used it.

3147
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:30,340
At this point.

3148
03:08:30,580 --> 03:08:30,800
Damn.

3149
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:35,880
How many are left?

3150
03:08:38,200 --> 03:08:38,680
No!

3151
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:42,780
Wait.

3152
03:08:43,360 --> 03:08:44,560
I'm trying to...

3153
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:45,160
Oh, wait.

3154
03:08:45,700 --> 03:08:46,460
I can't use it.

3155
03:08:46,460 --> 03:08:46,840
Okay.

3156
03:08:47,100 --> 03:08:47,540
That's fine.

3157
03:08:56,080 --> 03:08:58,360
I was trying to use my ult, but it won't let me.

3158
03:08:58,600 --> 03:08:59,280
Oh, now it's ready.

3159
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:00,280
It just wasn't ready.

3160
03:09:00,520 --> 03:09:00,960
I'm stupid.

3161
03:09:03,780 --> 03:09:05,020
Throw, throw, throw, throw, throw!

3162
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:09,160
Phase chill.

3163
03:09:14,400 --> 03:09:15,340
This is so unfair.

3164
03:09:15,940 --> 03:09:16,700
Oh my god.

3165
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:17,560
Oh my god.

3166
03:09:25,890 --> 03:09:27,030
I can't see anything.

3167
03:09:27,310 --> 03:09:28,250
I don't know what's happening.

3168
03:09:28,510 --> 03:09:29,450
I don't know what's happening.

3169
03:09:29,710 --> 03:09:30,770
I don't know what's happening.

3170
03:09:34,500 --> 03:09:35,420
Oh god.

3171
03:09:46,980 --> 03:09:47,860
Oh my gosh.

3172
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:56,040
I went.

3173
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:57,700
Oh, I didn't do it fast enough.

3174
03:09:57,920 --> 03:09:58,360
That's my bad.

3175
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:00,960
Oh my gosh.

3176
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:02,520
Oh my gosh.

3177
03:10:03,360 --> 03:10:04,840
Both at the same time!

3178
03:10:05,100 --> 03:10:05,860
This is so evil!

3179
03:10:10,140 --> 03:10:10,800
Oh no.

3180
03:10:11,060 --> 03:10:11,800
Oh no, no, no.

3181
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:13,900
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3182
03:10:14,520 --> 03:10:14,900
Nice!

3183
03:10:15,420 --> 03:10:15,980
Okay.

3184
03:10:19,540 --> 03:10:22,280
Oh, why is this camera angle so evil?

3185
03:10:24,120 --> 03:10:25,300
Actually, I can do that too.

3186
03:10:32,610 --> 03:10:33,510
And I'm out.

3187
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:36,830
I timed that perfectly.

3188
03:10:41,330 --> 03:10:41,810
Nice.

3189
03:10:46,890 --> 03:10:48,010
Nice dodge.

3190
03:10:48,350 --> 03:10:48,790
Thank you.

3191
03:10:53,310 --> 03:10:55,670
I think this is it for him!

3192
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:00,480
Kill him with his own drills.

3193
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:05,840
You guys, I got...

3194
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,300
You'll never believe what score I just got for that.

3195
03:11:11,240 --> 03:11:12,720
That was the hardest fight in the game.

3196
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:14,740
Well, I'm on easy, so you know.

3197
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:17,520
I'm on easy.

3198
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:18,960
What did you get?

3199
03:11:19,020 --> 03:11:19,800
I got SS!

3200
03:11:25,880 --> 03:11:26,780
I killed him.

3201
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:32,600
Phew.

3202
03:11:35,060 --> 03:11:36,200
Sexy style!

3203
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:45,720
Oh sorry, I'm not... I make it look like I'm on easy.

3204
03:11:59,220 --> 03:12:00,700
Thank you Joey for the pig!

3205
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:07,720
Ah, he says no.

3206
03:12:14,800 --> 03:12:16,440
Optimus has no chill.

3207
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:17,660
I kind of love that.

3208
03:12:18,900 --> 03:12:19,800
I kind of love that.

3209
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:22,260
Holy moly.

3210
03:12:23,960 --> 03:12:24,480
Optimus!

3211
03:12:24,840 --> 03:12:25,720
I mean, Megatron!

3212
03:12:25,860 --> 03:12:26,580
We can be buddies!

3213
03:12:28,940 --> 03:12:30,040
Oh shoot.

3214
03:12:30,480 --> 03:12:30,860
No!

3215
03:12:31,980 --> 03:12:34,260
Damn, he's insane.

3216
03:12:35,640 --> 03:12:36,680
Where is he?

3217
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:39,540
There he is.

3218
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:52,040
Oh my god!

3219
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:03,000
Nice.

3220
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:07,080
Holy...

3221
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:13,370
Oh my gosh.

3222
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:24,400
I need to remember the new attack that I...

3223
03:13:24,400 --> 03:13:24,860
Oh, this.

3224
03:13:25,700 --> 03:13:26,100
No!

3225
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:27,700
I missed it!

3226
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:30,580
There we go.

3227
03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:31,800
Oh, I think he dodged it too.

3228
03:13:35,940 --> 03:13:39,480
I'm trying to hold triangle, but I think I... Oh shoot.

3229
03:13:41,560 --> 03:13:42,980
Oh, I should have gotten a back attack.

3230
03:13:47,930 --> 03:13:50,210
What am I... I totally wasted that.

3231
03:13:50,990 --> 03:13:51,510
Wee!

3232
03:13:53,830 --> 03:13:58,590
What's great is you can just continuously dodge with those moves.

3233
03:14:00,770 --> 03:14:01,810
Not

3234
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:15,450
this one again.

3235
03:14:23,540 --> 03:14:25,360
Get stunlocked, Megatron!

3236
03:14:26,360 --> 03:14:27,940
Get stunlocked, Megatron!

3237
03:14:27,940 --> 03:14:28,240
Oh my god!

3238
03:14:31,060 --> 03:14:32,320
This is so sad.

3239
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:33,720
I'm cheesing my way to victory.

3240
03:14:35,260 --> 03:14:36,480
With 1 HP!

3241
03:14:37,480 --> 03:14:38,160
And a dream!

3242
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:40,420
Oh my god.

3243
03:14:40,820 --> 03:14:41,580
Oh my god.

3244
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:42,500
He's insane.

3245
03:14:43,060 --> 03:14:44,200
He's gone insano style.

3246
03:14:47,500 --> 03:14:49,640
He went insano style!

3247
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:53,380
No!

3248
03:14:54,100 --> 03:14:54,600
No!

3249
03:14:55,800 --> 03:14:56,780
Is it phase 2 time?

3250
03:14:58,460 --> 03:14:59,880
I did kind of bully him.

3251
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:00,300
I'm sorry.

3252
03:15:12,480 --> 03:15:12,980
Or?

3253
03:15:13,220 --> 03:15:13,780
Yeah, phase 2?

3254
03:15:14,540 --> 03:15:15,320
In space?

3255
03:15:30,320 --> 03:15:31,720
Are we actually fighting in space?

3256
03:15:32,240 --> 03:15:32,740
No way.

3257
03:15:32,940 --> 03:15:33,920
Oh no way!

3258
03:15:34,780 --> 03:15:35,840
Oh no way!

3259
03:15:36,580 --> 03:15:41,680
I feel bad playing as Bumblebee.

3260
03:15:45,720 --> 03:15:47,360
I am Optimus!

3261
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:56,220
Oh my...

3262
03:16:12,110 --> 03:16:13,350
Oh my god, this is so awesome.

3263
03:16:20,290 --> 03:16:21,470
How do you do that?

3264
03:16:21,570 --> 03:16:22,730
How do you go so far down?

3265
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:46,700
Oh my god, this is so awesome.

3266
03:17:03,500 --> 03:17:06,400
Wait, what am I pressing?

3267
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:17,520
Yeah!

3268
03:17:19,060 --> 03:17:20,960
Oh my god!

3269
03:17:24,190 --> 03:17:25,830
Why is it so awesome?

3270
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:35,360
Megatron

3271
03:17:50,320 --> 03:17:52,600
Well that's what we said we would have to do earlier anyway.

3272
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:53,500
Right?

3273
03:17:56,900 --> 03:17:57,800
Old man fist fight.

3274
03:17:57,900 --> 03:17:59,420
I totally thought it too.

3275
03:18:15,290 --> 03:18:17,190
They just drop dead?

3276
03:18:18,350 --> 03:18:18,830
Gross!

3277
03:18:19,730 --> 03:18:21,050
Who's going to clean this up?

3278
03:18:31,330 --> 03:18:31,830
Aww...

3279
03:18:31,830 --> 03:18:33,390
Yeah, where are all the humans?

3280
03:18:33,650 --> 03:18:34,130
Ok bye!

3281
03:19:05,790 --> 03:19:07,770
Oh they're Earthlings!

3282
03:19:09,950 --> 03:19:11,430
This is their home!

3283
03:19:24,110 --> 03:19:25,890
I'm tearing up.

3284
03:19:28,610 --> 03:19:29,510
Oh!

3285
03:19:30,350 --> 03:19:31,950
It's so beautiful!

3286
03:19:40,190 --> 03:19:43,410
I doubt that General Zod will have any friends.

3287
03:19:57,110 --> 03:19:58,070
That's our job.

3288
03:20:13,850 --> 03:20:14,730
Oh

3289
03:20:27,620 --> 03:20:28,840
my god.

3290
03:20:29,280 --> 03:20:29,700
Let's go.

3291
03:20:45,080 --> 03:20:46,000
That was mean.

3292
03:20:46,140 --> 03:20:46,620
I did that.

3293
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:48,520
Stop.

3294
03:20:48,580 --> 03:20:49,880
These are such awesome visuals.

3295
03:21:04,790 --> 03:21:06,410
I loved this room.

3296
03:21:06,650 --> 03:21:07,850
Oh my gosh, it was so awesome.

3297
03:21:08,850 --> 03:21:09,230
Yeah!

3298
03:21:11,030 --> 03:21:13,390
This is like Jam Project.

3299
03:21:13,510 --> 03:21:15,190
It does feel like Jam Project.

3300
03:21:17,450 --> 03:21:18,190
The

3301
03:21:23,780 --> 03:21:25,880
cutscene is 100% product placement.

3302
03:21:28,190 --> 03:21:32,040
I mean, Transformers is basically product placement.

3303
03:21:36,470 --> 03:21:37,270
It's just awesome.

3304
03:21:47,880 --> 03:21:48,760
Transformers!

3305
03:21:49,320 --> 03:21:54,380
I feel like I could definitely play this game.

3306
03:21:55,200 --> 03:21:58,940
Maybe now on like a normal or higher difficulty.

3307
03:21:59,640 --> 03:22:01,980
Look at this!

3308
03:22:02,120 --> 03:22:02,960
Oh my god!

3309
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:03,640
It's so awesome!

3310
03:22:07,300 --> 03:22:08,740
Hi Didi!

3311
03:22:08,740 --> 03:22:08,800
Didi!

3312
03:22:11,400 --> 03:22:13,040
86 movie watch along.

3313
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:16,200
Maybe once I get back from Japan we can.

3314
03:22:20,220 --> 03:22:22,380
Sometime in March we shall.

3315
03:22:23,020 --> 03:22:23,900
This game is so sick.

3316
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:24,960
It's so awesome.

3317
03:22:34,050 --> 03:22:35,440
Your dodges were clean.

3318
03:22:36,180 --> 03:22:41,560
I just wonder how much was it because of, you know, easy mode.

3319
03:22:42,820 --> 03:22:47,340
So I'm curious if I play on higher difficulty.

3320
03:22:48,500 --> 03:22:51,760
Because, you know, I do get caught in a lot of combos.

3321
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:55,140
In normal with heels you can totally do it.

3322
03:22:55,220 --> 03:22:56,660
Yeah, and I play with no heels.

3323
03:22:57,260 --> 03:22:57,840
So you know what?

3324
03:22:57,960 --> 03:23:01,380
Honestly, no heels is like normal mode.

3325
03:23:05,440 --> 03:23:06,820
Really glad you got to play the game.

3326
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:08,780
I'm a fan of Devastation.

3327
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:12,000
I used to play the hell out of it but maybe you'll be able to complete all the challenges unlike me.

3328
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:13,140
I don't know Ryu.

3329
03:23:13,420 --> 03:23:13,980
I mean Ed.

3330
03:23:14,200 --> 03:23:14,620
Ed Ryu.

3331
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:15,260
I don't know.

3332
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:16,780
I don't know.

3333
03:23:19,220 --> 03:23:19,900
I don't know.

3334
03:23:21,220 --> 03:23:22,660
I don't think I'm strong enough.

3335
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:28,480
But overall, like I said, the first stream, the game is just so smooth feeling.

3336
03:23:28,580 --> 03:23:30,620
It feels so fun to play.

3337
03:23:31,380 --> 03:23:32,380
It's a lot of fun.

3338
03:23:34,280 --> 03:23:36,140
Optimus falling from space is easy mode.

3339
03:23:36,240 --> 03:23:40,300
Megatron took a face to a nuke powerful enough to knock the planets over.

3340
03:23:44,840 --> 03:23:48,140
Hope you're able to find some Transformers figures while in Japan.

3341
03:23:48,900 --> 03:23:49,580
Maybe, yeah.

3342
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:50,400
I mean, not maybe.

3343
03:23:50,460 --> 03:23:51,180
I'm sure there's tons.

3344
03:23:54,040 --> 03:23:55,040
Doesn't feel like a vibe.

3345
03:23:55,420 --> 03:23:56,360
Salkin, thank you!

3346
03:23:57,240 --> 03:23:59,980
You've come very far from the Transformers game on the NES.

3347
03:24:00,740 --> 03:24:02,080
The one that's... Wait.

3348
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:03,380
Hold on.

3349
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:04,560
What is it?

3350
03:24:04,640 --> 03:24:09,580
Transformers no Nazo or whatever the hell that Transformers Nazo game is.

3351
03:24:13,520 --> 03:24:17,900
Just hoping this starts you on the path of Transformers brain rot till all are one.

3352
03:24:18,460 --> 03:24:19,100
Thank you!

3353
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:20,820
Convoy no Nazo!

3354
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:23,220
Oh my god.

3355
03:24:24,440 --> 03:24:25,840
Convoy no Nazo, please.

3356
03:24:26,560 --> 03:24:29,380
I've already been through enough with any Nazo games.

3357
03:24:32,260 --> 03:24:33,380
Super Kusoge.

3358
03:24:38,010 --> 03:24:40,330
Look at all these repeating names.

3359
03:24:40,370 --> 03:24:40,970
That's crazy.

3360
03:24:41,830 --> 03:24:42,690
Oh, Steve Blum!

3361
03:24:42,850 --> 03:24:43,570
You guys were right.

3362
03:25:11,990 --> 03:25:13,110
So good.

3363
03:25:14,610 --> 03:25:21,010
Also, since I've been watching Transformers Prime, it's very weird seeing Optimus with a mouth in that game.

3364
03:25:21,010 --> 03:25:22,270
Or, sorry, in that show.

3365
03:25:22,830 --> 03:25:25,250
So seeing him without a mouth here just feels right.

3366
03:25:27,830 --> 03:25:29,550
This design is so pink.

3367
03:25:33,590 --> 03:25:35,370
I don't like it with the mouth.

3368
03:25:37,710 --> 03:25:39,830
I don't have anything to add.

3369
03:25:40,210 --> 03:25:40,730
Just stand.

3370
03:25:41,670 --> 03:25:42,550
Sky bike.

3371
03:25:44,950 --> 03:25:56,070
Mankey, mankey, mankey, mankey...

3372
03:26:04,330 --> 03:26:04,850
Ruttro!

3373
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:09,520
Ruttro.

3374
03:26:09,840 --> 03:26:12,340
Was there supposed to be a sequel to this or what?

3375
03:26:12,340 --> 03:26:14,040
I got the trophy!

3376
03:26:14,380 --> 03:26:15,600
Till all are one.

3377
03:26:17,440 --> 03:26:18,480
Sequel baiting.

3378
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:20,180
Sting like a bee.

3379
03:26:21,060 --> 03:26:23,020
Must be because I played mostly Rumblebee.

3380
03:26:27,690 --> 03:26:28,750
Look at that!

3381
03:26:30,070 --> 03:26:31,890
I got SS on one of them.

3382
03:26:33,030 --> 03:26:34,330
Why didn't I rank in 5?

3383
03:26:34,930 --> 03:26:36,070
Oh, is it because I died?

3384
03:26:37,350 --> 03:26:37,910
Probably.

3385
03:26:39,430 --> 03:26:40,210
To be continued.

3386
03:26:40,890 --> 03:26:41,310
Right?

3387
03:26:42,430 --> 03:26:42,970
Right?

3388
03:26:43,970 --> 03:26:46,250
Got a Megatron in the corner of the screen.

3389
03:26:49,390 --> 03:26:50,710
Fusing cannon.

3390
03:26:52,930 --> 03:26:54,650
Star Saber!

3391
03:26:56,130 --> 03:26:56,690
Nice.

3392
03:27:11,610 --> 03:27:13,470
Can I... If I...

3393
03:27:14,710 --> 03:27:17,050
Oh, wait.

3394
03:27:18,360 --> 03:27:20,110
My finger actually slipped.

3395
03:27:21,030 --> 03:27:22,430
Wait, my finger actually slipped.

3396
03:27:22,490 --> 03:27:22,770
Hold on.

3397
03:27:28,170 --> 03:27:28,650
Skip?

3398
03:27:30,130 --> 03:27:30,930
Main menu.

3399
03:27:33,030 --> 03:27:34,590
Do I have everything though?

3400
03:27:35,710 --> 03:27:36,870
Oh yeah, I do.

3401
03:27:37,030 --> 03:27:37,610
I have all my...

3402
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:39,310
So it is like a new game plus.

3403
03:27:39,970 --> 03:27:40,450
Nice.

3404
03:27:41,330 --> 03:27:42,010
Okay, main menu.

3405
03:27:44,650 --> 03:27:45,750
Time to check the art.

3406
03:27:45,850 --> 03:27:48,450
That's exactly what I was thinking.

3407
03:27:56,530 --> 03:27:57,790
Character models.

3408
03:28:01,080 --> 03:28:02,840
Hold on, the music is so loud.

3409
03:28:03,020 --> 03:28:03,580
DLC?

3410
03:28:11,070 --> 03:28:12,150
Too cool.

3411
03:28:17,660 --> 03:28:18,780
Too cool.

3412
03:28:20,220 --> 03:28:23,480
I think though, out of all the designs...

3413
03:28:23,480 --> 03:28:25,900
Even though I like Rumblebee's little...

3414
03:28:25,900 --> 03:28:26,740
What's it called?

3415
03:28:28,660 --> 03:28:30,080
His little horns.

3416
03:28:30,740 --> 03:28:32,800
Wheeljack might be one of my favorite designs.

3417
03:28:35,620 --> 03:28:39,620
I really like that he kind of looks like...

3418
03:28:40,900 --> 03:28:42,060
Change form?

3419
03:28:43,320 --> 03:28:45,940
He looks like...

3420
03:28:46,620 --> 03:28:49,760
He looks like he could be Rex as a Transformer.

3421
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:51,540
Like Metal Gear Rex.

3422
03:28:52,740 --> 03:28:55,180
I really like his design though.

3423
03:28:57,300 --> 03:28:57,840
Cute!

3424
03:29:02,960 --> 03:29:04,320
So cute.

3425
03:29:05,620 --> 03:29:06,700
Yeah!

3426
03:29:10,620 --> 03:29:11,960
Gold bug.

3427
03:29:15,880 --> 03:29:17,280
Poinsettia.

3428
03:29:31,260 --> 03:29:32,660
Shockwave.

3429
03:29:33,980 --> 03:29:35,400
What are you turning into?

3430
03:29:36,060 --> 03:29:36,500
Again?

3431
03:29:41,750 --> 03:29:44,370
I always wish we got a sequel with a playable Decepticon campaign.

3432
03:29:44,590 --> 03:29:45,610
But it was never meant to be.

3433
03:29:46,030 --> 03:29:47,130
Until All or One Minto.

3434
03:29:47,710 --> 03:29:49,030
That would have been so peak.

3435
03:29:56,900 --> 03:29:57,800
What's try me?

3436
03:30:03,360 --> 03:30:06,820
All Autobots inferior, Soundwaves superior.

3437
03:30:12,780 --> 03:30:14,860
I can't.

3438
03:30:16,060 --> 03:30:17,440
Go little guy.

3439
03:30:18,600 --> 03:30:20,940
Just has a little man living inside him.

3440
03:30:21,280 --> 03:30:22,080
Little men.

3441
03:30:23,380 --> 03:30:23,940
Eject.

3442
03:30:26,980 --> 03:30:28,020
Blitzwing.

3443
03:30:29,600 --> 03:30:30,040
Cool.

3444
03:30:37,920 --> 03:30:39,160
Thundercracker.

3445
03:30:41,820 --> 03:30:44,680
I also really like Thundercracker's design.

3446
03:30:46,780 --> 03:30:48,580
It's so beautiful.

3447
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:51,760
It's so clean.

3448
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:08,940
Make them listen to my mixtape.

3449
03:31:08,940 --> 03:31:11,080
They'll die of cringe.

3450
03:31:13,540 --> 03:31:17,320
Can't beat the frenzy.

3451
03:31:20,480 --> 03:31:22,220
Oh boy.

3452
03:31:23,220 --> 03:31:25,860
Oh god, this guy stinks.

3453
03:31:29,240 --> 03:31:30,400
Laserbeak.

3454
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:32,940
This is the one...

3455
03:31:33,780 --> 03:31:36,880
Inside Soundwave, right?

3456
03:31:38,220 --> 03:31:39,560
One of them at least.

3457
03:31:42,920 --> 03:31:45,780
Yeah, yeah, there he is.

3458
03:31:48,700 --> 03:31:49,340
Buzzsaw.

3459
03:31:50,520 --> 03:31:51,160
Ravage.

3460
03:31:52,200 --> 03:31:54,520
Why are they all just cassette tapes?

3461
03:32:03,540 --> 03:32:04,180
What?

3462
03:32:07,060 --> 03:32:07,580
What did he say?

3463
03:32:09,820 --> 03:32:11,740
Oh, because Soundwave is a boombox.

3464
03:32:11,840 --> 03:32:13,360
Oh my gosh, that makes so much sense.

3465
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:15,620
That makes so much sense.

3466
03:32:17,740 --> 03:32:18,820
So cool.

3467
03:32:19,980 --> 03:32:21,140
So cool.

3468
03:32:22,020 --> 03:32:24,360
I like all the Constructicons too.

3469
03:32:24,900 --> 03:32:25,820
They're so cute.

3470
03:32:26,340 --> 03:32:27,560
They're just little workers.

3471
03:32:30,400 --> 03:32:33,600
He's like, I mix concrete.

3472
03:32:34,480 --> 03:32:36,120
I haul dirt.

3473
03:32:38,620 --> 03:32:39,500
I dig!

3474
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:43,880
They're so funny.

3475
03:32:45,780 --> 03:32:49,660
This guy is actually the most deadly.

3476
03:32:52,200 --> 03:32:52,640
Hook.

3477
03:32:55,740 --> 03:33:00,680
One time I joked with my friends at the theater when we saw a Transformers ad.

3478
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:03,120
I said, hear me out Megatron though, as a joke.

3479
03:33:03,220 --> 03:33:06,200
Now my friends won't ever let me down for that awful joke.

3480
03:33:09,220 --> 03:33:09,620
Joke?

3481
03:33:17,260 --> 03:33:17,660
Joke?

3482
03:33:21,160 --> 03:33:22,560
Oh my god, the music changed.

3483
03:33:26,680 --> 03:33:31,060
I love when Menasor... Oh my god, the music is so awesome.

3484
03:33:31,260 --> 03:33:33,340
When he breaks apart into all the little cars.

3485
03:33:33,740 --> 03:33:34,720
I like when he does that.

3486
03:33:50,480 --> 03:33:50,960
Whoa.

3487
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:57,100
Why does he look like an old man?

3488
03:34:02,120 --> 03:34:03,360
He looks old.

3489
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:04,320
I don't like him.

3490
03:34:04,900 --> 03:34:06,060
He looks like an old guy.

3491
03:34:08,240 --> 03:34:10,100
Many cars combined into a big car.

3492
03:34:10,100 --> 03:34:11,400
This guy.

3493
03:34:12,620 --> 03:34:14,200
This guy.

3494
03:34:14,720 --> 03:34:16,480
This guy.

3495
03:34:17,300 --> 03:34:18,620
The Seekers.

3496
03:34:20,980 --> 03:34:21,920
Seeker seeds.

3497
03:34:22,600 --> 03:34:23,320
So cool.

3498
03:34:25,180 --> 03:34:26,400
Kickback.

3499
03:34:29,800 --> 03:34:33,180
Be gone Insecticon.

3500
03:34:36,060 --> 03:34:36,920
Get me out of here.

3501
03:34:41,790 --> 03:34:43,530
I'm just a bug.

3502
03:34:45,610 --> 03:34:47,630
Scrapnel is such a great name.

3503
03:34:56,110 --> 03:34:58,830
Roll out!

3504
03:34:59,550 --> 03:34:59,850
Yeah!

3505
03:35:07,690 --> 03:35:09,170
So good.

3506
03:35:13,970 --> 03:35:17,590
Time to dance with the bee.

3507
03:35:18,730 --> 03:35:21,310
What if he said, so you like jazz?

3508
03:35:23,550 --> 03:35:25,330
Mr. LBZ, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

3509
03:35:26,430 --> 03:35:28,190
Donald's toy looking butts.

3510
03:35:28,390 --> 03:35:28,590
No!

3511
03:35:29,090 --> 03:35:30,470
I kinda, yeah.

3512
03:35:31,750 --> 03:35:33,970
The harder they fall.

3513
03:35:33,970 --> 03:35:35,550
I don't break rules.

3514
03:35:35,730 --> 03:35:36,370
I bend them.

3515
03:35:36,770 --> 03:35:37,330
A lot.

3516
03:35:50,510 --> 03:35:51,190
Grimlock!

3517
03:35:52,170 --> 03:35:53,810
Grimlock has a great design too.

3518
03:35:54,350 --> 03:35:56,290
Me munch metal.

3519
03:35:57,850 --> 03:35:59,810
Grimlock no bozo.

3520
03:36:00,250 --> 03:36:01,410
Grimlock king.

3521
03:36:12,480 --> 03:36:14,680
Grimlock, Dinobot leader.

3522
03:36:15,200 --> 03:36:18,500
Slag and sludge do what Grimlock say.

3523
03:36:26,380 --> 03:36:27,780
Lizard.

3524
03:36:35,920 --> 03:36:42,380
This one looks pretty much the same.

3525
03:36:50,760 --> 03:36:51,600
Megatron.

3526
03:36:57,140 --> 03:36:57,780
Alrighty guys.

3527
03:36:57,920 --> 03:36:59,240
This is so fun.

3528
03:36:59,380 --> 03:37:01,260
Wait, ending movie, no credits.

3529
03:37:02,400 --> 03:37:03,660
Oh, we gotta look at the art too.

3530
03:37:03,740 --> 03:37:03,920
I forgot.

3531
03:37:04,060 --> 03:37:04,500
Sorry, my bad.

3532
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:07,220
We looked at this one.

3533
03:37:07,340 --> 03:37:08,240
We looked at that one.

3534
03:37:08,460 --> 03:37:09,540
We looked at this one.

3535
03:37:11,860 --> 03:37:12,180
Room.

3536
03:37:14,440 --> 03:37:15,080
The hallways.

3537
03:37:15,920 --> 03:37:17,100
More of the hallways.

3538
03:37:17,340 --> 03:37:18,140
Concept art.

3539
03:37:19,180 --> 03:37:19,660
Oh wait, no.

3540
03:37:19,680 --> 03:37:21,020
Those are like the doors I gotta open.

3541
03:37:23,840 --> 03:37:26,300
Oh, these are the... Oh, these are not the hallways.

3542
03:37:26,380 --> 03:37:28,560
These are the... What's it called?

3543
03:37:30,020 --> 03:37:31,380
The runways that I was on.

3544
03:37:31,820 --> 03:37:32,220
Maomao!

3545
03:37:32,540 --> 03:37:33,720
Thank you so much for the buy hint!

3546
03:37:35,780 --> 03:37:38,220
Is there only really stage art of the first day?

3547
03:37:38,360 --> 03:37:40,420
Well, I guess there's this.

3548
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:42,060
We have this.

3549
03:37:42,480 --> 03:37:43,580
That looks so awesome.

3550
03:37:44,200 --> 03:37:45,460
Oh my gosh, what a visual.

3551
03:37:47,320 --> 03:37:48,500
God, it's so awesome.

3552
03:37:52,770 --> 03:37:53,890
It's so awesome.

3553
03:37:54,830 --> 03:37:55,610
Looks so good.

3554
03:37:55,950 --> 03:37:56,670
Character art.

3555
03:37:57,470 --> 03:37:58,850
Oh my gosh!

3556
03:38:01,770 --> 03:38:03,470
I'm locked off.

3557
03:38:04,010 --> 03:38:05,350
I'm locked on.

3558
03:38:08,810 --> 03:38:11,410
Oh my god.

3559
03:38:12,770 --> 03:38:13,970
This seems too intimate.

3560
03:38:15,570 --> 03:38:16,830
Oh my gosh.

3561
03:38:17,490 --> 03:38:20,550
It's just like those... Oh my... Animorphs!

3562
03:38:23,460 --> 03:38:27,790
It's an Animorphs title or cover.

3563
03:38:29,070 --> 03:38:29,610
Probably.

3564
03:38:30,790 --> 03:38:32,270
Look at them shoes!

3565
03:38:32,930 --> 03:38:33,670
Golly!

3566
03:38:34,570 --> 03:38:35,970
What the hell?

3567
03:38:37,910 --> 03:38:39,670
Animorphs roll out!

3568
03:38:44,530 --> 03:38:45,590
Awesome.

3569
03:38:46,770 --> 03:38:47,670
Love the character art.

3570
03:38:47,750 --> 03:38:48,310
Scene art.

3571
03:38:54,890 --> 03:38:57,110
Who's the big guy all the way in the back?

3572
03:38:58,170 --> 03:38:59,450
Like the big, big guy.

3573
03:39:08,730 --> 03:39:09,450
Hero's world.

3574
03:39:10,710 --> 03:39:11,430
Omega Supreme!

3575
03:39:13,590 --> 03:39:14,690
Oh, hi Pies!

3576
03:39:14,950 --> 03:39:15,470
You want out?

3577
03:39:16,710 --> 03:39:17,990
What are you looking at me for?

3578
03:39:18,210 --> 03:39:19,350
What are you getting on my desk for?

3579
03:39:19,930 --> 03:39:20,310
Come here.

3580
03:39:21,190 --> 03:39:21,570
You want out?

3581
03:39:24,290 --> 03:39:25,570
You wanna try and make it up here?

3582
03:39:25,950 --> 03:39:26,530
You think you can?

3583
03:39:29,490 --> 03:39:29,950
Pies.

3584
03:39:29,950 --> 03:39:31,890
She's jumping around on my little table.

3585
03:39:33,270 --> 03:39:34,070
You wanna try?

3586
03:39:35,550 --> 03:39:36,570
You want in my lap?

3587
03:39:37,070 --> 03:39:39,030
She does not want in my lap.

3588
03:39:39,110 --> 03:39:39,330
Come here.

3589
03:39:40,270 --> 03:39:40,770
Come here.

3590
03:39:41,410 --> 03:39:41,950
Come here.

3591
03:39:42,570 --> 03:39:43,150
Come here.

3592
03:39:43,790 --> 03:39:44,550
Come here!

3593
03:39:54,270 --> 03:39:54,910
Come here.

3594
03:39:55,010 --> 03:39:55,250
Stop.

3595
03:39:55,370 --> 03:39:55,590
No.

3596
03:39:55,990 --> 03:39:57,670
She tries to get on my pachislot.

3597
03:39:58,710 --> 03:39:59,150
You

3598
03:40:12,610 --> 03:40:15,130
want my lap and you're gonna immediately leave.

3599
03:40:18,790 --> 03:40:19,850
She's so sweet.

3600
03:40:19,950 --> 03:40:20,370
OK, bye.

3601
03:40:22,270 --> 03:40:27,570
She's not a lap cat even though that's what I was advertised when I...

3602
03:40:51,840 --> 03:40:52,880
Cat scam.

3603
03:40:52,980 --> 03:40:54,180
I did get scammed a little bit.

3604
03:40:55,180 --> 03:40:55,760
It's OK.

3605
03:40:56,500 --> 03:40:57,740
Generations are...

3606
03:40:57,740 --> 03:40:58,360
Oh yeah!

3607
03:40:58,480 --> 03:41:00,320
I was looking at this stuff last stream.

3608
03:41:00,440 --> 03:41:01,320
Oh my god.

3609
03:41:03,880 --> 03:41:05,320
To the unassuming eye.

3610
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:07,700
To the untrained eye of just a truck.

3611
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:09,600
Just a truck.

3612
03:41:10,220 --> 03:41:11,880
This is such a fun game to watch you play.

3613
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:12,640
Congrats on beating it.

3614
03:41:12,680 --> 03:41:13,420
Thank you!

3615
03:41:14,940 --> 03:41:16,060
Mine don't do laps either.

3616
03:41:16,180 --> 03:41:20,400
The 20 pound cat always wanna be held like a freaking man baby though.

3617
03:41:23,280 --> 03:41:26,940
There are actually anamorph toys under the Transformers brand.

3618
03:41:27,180 --> 03:41:27,500
Stop!

3619
03:41:29,200 --> 03:41:30,760
Transformers is like everywhere though.

3620
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:37,800
Transformers Devastation with Metal Gear Rising and Sonic Frontier's music edits fit so perfectly together.

3621
03:41:38,480 --> 03:41:40,760
Is your name Megamint or Mintotron?

3622
03:41:41,100 --> 03:41:43,960
I feel Mintotron probably works better a little bit.

3623
03:41:46,680 --> 03:41:48,640
Oh my god!

3624
03:41:49,340 --> 03:41:49,600
Hello?

3625
03:41:51,280 --> 03:41:52,260
Who is this?

3626
03:41:54,680 --> 03:41:55,440
Mintotron.

3627
03:41:56,700 --> 03:41:58,080
Minta Megadoodoo.

3628
03:41:59,860 --> 03:42:01,280
What the hell is this?

3629
03:42:01,620 --> 03:42:03,560
Optimus Maximus.

3630
03:42:05,180 --> 03:42:06,740
Oh my god.

3631
03:42:08,660 --> 03:42:10,520
The jet on the leg.

3632
03:42:10,620 --> 03:42:11,960
The double jets on the leg.

3633
03:42:12,620 --> 03:42:14,000
It goes so hard.

3634
03:42:15,760 --> 03:42:16,900
It's too awesome.

3635
03:42:20,500 --> 03:42:24,760
Look at that dashing smile as he knees that guy to the face.

3636
03:42:26,620 --> 03:42:27,500
Too good.

3637
03:42:27,980 --> 03:42:29,100
Now he's serious.

3638
03:42:29,360 --> 03:42:29,960
Now he's serious.

3639
03:42:31,300 --> 03:42:32,180
Oh gosh.

3640
03:42:32,280 --> 03:42:35,080
I guess we got a bunch of Bumblebee art because I played so much as him.

3641
03:42:39,660 --> 03:42:40,180
Wait.

3642
03:42:40,840 --> 03:42:41,700
Who is that?

3643
03:42:42,700 --> 03:42:43,520
Who is that?

3644
03:42:45,760 --> 03:42:47,080
God is good sad.

3645
03:42:48,220 --> 03:42:49,220
Is that Grimlock?

3646
03:42:52,870 --> 03:42:54,450
Oh I see the little hands.

3647
03:42:56,770 --> 03:42:58,290
Oh my god!

3648
03:42:59,270 --> 03:43:00,510
That's so good.

3649
03:43:00,610 --> 03:43:01,910
That's such an awesome picture.

3650
03:43:03,150 --> 03:43:04,810
I wonder who the artist is for these.

3651
03:43:06,170 --> 03:43:06,890
Fan art.

3652
03:43:07,450 --> 03:43:08,730
Very serious Grimlock.

3653
03:43:09,750 --> 03:43:10,670
He is serious.

3654
03:43:11,450 --> 03:43:12,470
He means serious.

3655
03:43:12,650 --> 03:43:13,590
He is serious.

3656
03:43:17,570 --> 03:43:19,030
Grimlock on a diet.

3657
03:43:20,370 --> 03:43:22,550
Look at your thighs looking a little bit skinny there buddy.

3658
03:43:26,540 --> 03:43:29,300
He can't be all muscle.

3659
03:43:29,540 --> 03:43:31,380
He's gotta be a little limber.

3660
03:43:36,300 --> 03:43:37,540
He's like...

3661
03:43:37,540 --> 03:43:39,340
She's like, did I do that?

3662
03:43:40,840 --> 03:43:42,060
This picture though.

3663
03:43:43,060 --> 03:43:46,960
There's somebody crying about their home being destroyed and you're smiling Bumblebee!

3664
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:50,900
A family literally lost their home and you're smiling!

3665
03:43:50,900 --> 03:43:51,320
Killing!

3666
03:43:53,320 --> 03:43:55,340
You enjoy all the killing.

3667
03:43:59,960 --> 03:44:01,500
I think that... wait.

3668
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:02,420
Hold on.

3669
03:44:02,820 --> 03:44:04,040
I wanted to look at this one again.

3670
03:44:06,140 --> 03:44:07,380
This one is so cool.

3671
03:44:08,200 --> 03:44:10,580
With the dead bodies scattered around.

3672
03:44:11,620 --> 03:44:13,260
Smiling in front of death.

3673
03:44:14,480 --> 03:44:15,700
I think that's everything then.

3674
03:44:16,460 --> 03:44:17,020
Nice!

3675
03:44:17,020 --> 03:44:17,300
Nice!

3676
03:44:22,660 --> 03:44:24,980
This was so much fun you guys.

3677
03:44:25,520 --> 03:44:27,060
Wait, play history.

3678
03:44:28,660 --> 03:44:29,220
Transformers.

3679
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:30,340
Collectibles!

3680
03:44:30,740 --> 03:44:31,400
Wait, hold on.

3681
03:44:31,560 --> 03:44:31,720
Sorry.

3682
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:34,080
Collectibles.

3683
03:44:34,300 --> 03:44:35,020
What did I collect?

3684
03:44:35,840 --> 03:44:36,900
Oh yeah, that's right.

3685
03:44:37,340 --> 03:44:38,620
I missed so many of them.

3686
03:44:40,500 --> 03:44:42,140
And the Decepticon flags.

3687
03:44:44,560 --> 03:44:46,340
Many, many collectibles missed.

3688
03:44:48,340 --> 03:44:50,420
My play history.

3689
03:44:56,060 --> 03:44:57,660
That's embarrassing.

3690
03:45:07,700 --> 03:45:11,060
I got 41% out of collectibles though.

3691
03:45:13,140 --> 03:45:15,820
Missions completed 90%.

3692
03:45:16,420 --> 03:45:19,120
Does that not count the side quests maybe?

3693
03:45:20,800 --> 03:45:22,260
Don't look at the 51%!

3694
03:45:23,400 --> 03:45:24,220
Zero parries.

3695
03:45:24,340 --> 03:45:25,480
I didn't unlock parry.

3696
03:45:25,580 --> 03:45:27,680
That's why you guys, I didn't even buy it.

3697
03:45:28,340 --> 03:45:29,940
You guys, I didn't buy parry.

3698
03:45:30,520 --> 03:45:32,080
How would I have any parries?

3699
03:45:32,400 --> 03:45:33,560
We didn't buy it!

3700
03:45:38,780 --> 03:45:40,640
We didn't buy the parry!

3701
03:45:44,770 --> 03:45:46,710
Top Mr. M, welcome to membership.

3702
03:45:46,910 --> 03:45:47,690
Thank you!

3703
03:45:49,810 --> 03:45:51,650
Too poor to parry.

3704
03:45:53,790 --> 03:45:56,370
Come back when you're a little richer.

3705
03:45:58,550 --> 03:46:00,210
Who's by parry?

3706
03:46:02,650 --> 03:46:05,370
That's parry the platypus on AO3.

3707
03:46:08,270 --> 03:46:13,170
I don't get why Hot Rod was promoted to status of prime over Ultra Magnus.

3708
03:46:14,470 --> 03:46:17,810
Well, I couldn't tell you literally anything.

3709
03:46:19,810 --> 03:46:23,210
I couldn't tell you anything.

3710
03:46:24,290 --> 03:46:26,270
All hail Lord Mitochide!

3711
03:46:26,950 --> 03:46:29,370
Wisps transform and rise up!

3712
03:46:31,110 --> 03:46:31,950
Oh, that's spoilers?

3713
03:46:32,710 --> 03:46:34,270
Don't worry guys, I'll forget.

3714
03:46:35,890 --> 03:46:37,710
I erased it from my brain.

3715
03:46:38,750 --> 03:46:40,750
I literally took the piece.

3716
03:46:40,750 --> 03:46:43,230
I reached into my ectoplasm.

3717
03:46:43,310 --> 03:46:49,830
I took the part of my brain that remembered that specific super chat and I chucked it.

3718
03:46:51,710 --> 03:46:54,150
It's literally gone.

3719
03:46:55,190 --> 03:46:58,570
And now I have a goopy ectoplasm mess on my floor.

3720
03:47:02,270 --> 03:47:03,310
Yeah, what super chat?

3721
03:47:04,550 --> 03:47:06,050
You didn't need to parry.

3722
03:47:06,510 --> 03:47:07,070
Mito2Gamer.

3723
03:47:07,170 --> 03:47:08,270
I dodged!

3724
03:47:08,270 --> 03:47:09,870
I like dodging.

3725
03:47:10,230 --> 03:47:11,490
I like doing a little roll.

3726
03:47:12,990 --> 03:47:15,430
But yeah, this is so fun you guys!

3727
03:47:15,530 --> 03:47:16,730
Also, are those hurricanes?

3728
03:47:22,450 --> 03:47:26,530
Thank you guys for more transformers.

3729
03:47:27,010 --> 03:47:29,830
I know so many people have asked about the other games.

3730
03:47:32,930 --> 03:47:34,650
Eventually I would like to.

3731
03:47:35,050 --> 03:47:36,150
I do not have them.

3732
03:47:40,070 --> 03:47:41,910
So, playing them might be difficult.

3733
03:47:42,110 --> 03:47:43,510
I think they are very expensive now.

3734
03:47:46,170 --> 03:47:48,190
But I would like to play them in the future.

3735
03:47:48,590 --> 03:47:48,850
Yeah,

3736
03:47:52,610 --> 03:47:54,550
we'll see.

3737
03:47:54,670 --> 03:47:57,150
We'll see if there is any way that I can ever...

3738
03:47:58,930 --> 03:48:04,130
Sometimes I ask friends if they have anything too so I can borrow stuff.

3739
03:48:04,130 --> 03:48:06,550
So, you know, somebody might have something.

3740
03:48:06,770 --> 03:48:07,190
Who knows?

3741
03:48:08,370 --> 03:48:10,130
Going to Japan for my birthday this May!

3742
03:48:10,290 --> 03:48:10,930
First time!

3743
03:48:11,290 --> 03:48:12,350
Oh my gosh, Requiem!

3744
03:48:12,530 --> 03:48:13,750
I had the best time ever!

3745
03:48:17,950 --> 03:48:21,090
But yeah, thanks for the super chat, Saltine.

3746
03:48:21,870 --> 03:48:22,550
Thank you, thank you.

3747
03:48:23,430 --> 03:48:24,650
Thank you, TriPrincess earlier.

3748
03:48:24,790 --> 03:48:26,130
Sorry, I didn't catch the donut.

3749
03:48:27,110 --> 03:48:27,810
And Kvarn!

3750
03:48:27,990 --> 03:48:31,690
Oh, we were getting you minky during the cutscene.

3751
03:48:31,690 --> 03:48:35,690
Thank you so much for the donut.

3752
03:48:37,290 --> 03:48:40,830
Hopefully Hasbro gets its licensing together and you can experience more for Cybertron.

3753
03:48:41,630 --> 03:48:43,870
Transformers Armada on the PS2 is fun too.

3754
03:48:44,530 --> 03:48:46,410
Have a look into it.

3755
03:48:49,250 --> 03:48:50,450
Otsumito, everybody!

3756
03:48:51,730 --> 03:48:54,970
Otsumito had so much fun and I hope you guys did too.

3757
03:48:55,630 --> 03:48:58,550
And we'll do more Transformers thingies in the future.

3758
03:48:58,550 --> 03:49:00,650
Maybe we could do like a double feature.

3759
03:49:00,830 --> 03:49:04,270
Maybe we could do the 86 movie and then Transformers 1.

3760
03:49:06,230 --> 03:49:07,930
We could have the old and the new.

3761
03:49:08,990 --> 03:49:13,150
Maybe we could do a double feature for those who haven't seen the first one or those who haven't seen the new movie.

3762
03:49:21,150 --> 03:49:26,690
Any interest in the Fist of the North Star game made by the studio that makes the Yakuza like a dragon game?

3763
03:49:28,230 --> 03:49:32,070
I don't know Fist of the North Star so much.

3764
03:49:32,590 --> 03:49:34,850
But I, you know, maybe one day.

3765
03:49:35,510 --> 03:49:36,290
I never say never.

3766
03:49:37,290 --> 03:49:39,770
I never say never to most games at least.

3767
03:49:41,510 --> 03:49:45,810
Otsumito, thank you guys and I'll see you next time.

3768
03:49:46,110 --> 03:49:47,010
Next time, next time.

3769
03:49:48,070 --> 03:49:49,170
Thank you for streaming.

3770
03:49:49,430 --> 03:49:50,010
Thank you, thank you.

3771
03:49:50,770 --> 03:49:51,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3772
03:49:53,150 --> 03:49:55,690
Yeah, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

3773
03:49:55,790 --> 03:49:56,910
This is so much fun.

3774
03:49:57,310 --> 03:49:58,390
So, so, so much fun.

3775
03:49:58,710 --> 03:49:59,990
This game is so fun.

3776
03:50:00,450 --> 03:50:02,830
Otsumito, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.
