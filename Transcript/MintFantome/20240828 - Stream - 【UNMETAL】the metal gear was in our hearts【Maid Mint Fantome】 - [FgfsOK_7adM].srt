1
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm in the box.

2
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,040
I'm in the box!

3
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Hello, everybody.

4
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,940
Hello, everybody.

5
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,660
Welcome to Un-Metal New World!

6
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,280
Un-Metal New World!

7
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,660
Oh, I just realized the game was not... had no sound.

8
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,320
There it is.

9
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,540
Oh.

10
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,640
Oh, there was... I was like, wow, this game is so quiet.

11
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,760
It's just because I was clicked out of the window.

12
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,880
Hold on, let me move some stuff around on my computer real quick.

13
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,300
And then...

14
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,880
If you guys hear something in the background, it's me boiling water because I'm making drip coffee.

15
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,020
And if you hear something else in the background...

16
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,660
I don't know.

17
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,840
There are probably the ghosts in my room.

18
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,060
Yeah.

19
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,100
Yeah, I'm just waiting for the water to boil so I can drip my coffee.

20
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
Using keyboard and mouse?

21
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,380
Yeah, I don't have a controller since I'm not at home.

22
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,140
I'm in a hotel.

23
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,440
So...

24
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,020
She has bodies in her fridge.

25
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,340
Yeah!

26
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Actually, you know, hotel fridges are not very big.

27
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,620
So...

28
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Unfortunately...

29
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,740
Ghosts other than yourself, Umin.

30
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,760
Of course, obviously.

31
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,200
I put myself in the box because I wasn't sure how...

32
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,600
How...

33
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,200
How this game will be.

34
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I probably will block stuff, so...

35
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,700
Long time no where.

36
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,540
First time watcher of this game.

37
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,240
I know you will too.

38
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,400
Thanks!

39
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
I forgot the stream was starting.

40
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,680
I just heard you screaming I'm in a box from my headphones.

41
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,220
I wasn't screaming.

42
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,840
I was like, you know...

43
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,740
Bada!

44
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,540
Thanks for the 10 gift cards!

45
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,140
The recent delta preview shows it's faithful with only changes to graphics, aiming menus and crouching.

46
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,680
What do you mean crouching?

47
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Can we crouch walk?

48
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,800
Because if so, huge.

49
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

50
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,840
I just realized the notifications.

51
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh, there we go.

52
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,820
If we can crouch walk...

53
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,800
That's huge.

54
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,500
And Draco!

55
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,880
6 for the 20 gift cards!

56
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,060
I mean...

57
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,960
And it wouldn't be like weird to add crouch walking because it was in the 3DS version.

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,320
Oh, my water's done.

59
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,660
Hold on.

60
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,320
I'm gonna make some...

61
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,280
I've never made drip coffee before, you guys.

62
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,080
I bought it on a whim because I was like, wow, drip coffee.

63
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,720
And then also, it was like a butterscotch flavor.

64
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,140
So...

65
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,780
Okay, hold on.

66
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,080
Give me a second.

67
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,560
10% Kona coffee.

68
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,160
Hawaiian Paradise coffee.

69
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,500
That's your ASMR?

70
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,280
Open it.

71
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,140
Interaction!

72
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,460
What the hell is this?

73
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,980
I should wash this cup, actually.

74
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,340
Come on.

75
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,020
Let me wash the cup real quick.

76
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,070
With soap.

77
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,470
Hold on.

78
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,670
Oh, it smells really good.

79
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,910
This smells like good coffee.

80
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,060
I don't even know if you can hear me.

81
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,020
I might be talking to myself.

82
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,950
Yes, we can.

83
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,550
Oh, okay.

84
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,970
One second.

85
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,530
I'm making my coffee!

86
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,140
Wait, I haven't opened this.

87
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,690
Oh, it smells really good.

88
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm pouring in the water.

89
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,420
How

90
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,120
much water do you need?

91
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,900
Ah!

92
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,520
My cup is too shallow.

93
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,800
Ouch!

94
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,220
You guys, my cup is too shallow.

95
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,040
It's not even dripping into the mug.

96
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,920
It's like soaking in the mug.

97
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,460
So...

98
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Um...

99
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,600
Epic fail.

100
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,440
You okay?

101
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Yeah, I ran into my suitcase.

102
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,340
It's like I can still hear her voice.

103
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,060
Oh, wow.

104
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,660
It smells really, really good.

105
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,360
I don't know how long do I have it sit for.

106
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,300
Oh, no!

107
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,320
I didn't get any cream!

108
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,110
I have chocolate.

109
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,210
I'll throw in some white chocolate.

110
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,690
Yeah.

111
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,070
I've kind of been like...

112
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,130
Yesterday, I really didn't do anything.

113
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,910
I've just been doing laundry.

114
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,130
Because at the last hotel that I was at...

115
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,990
Sakana has like expensive taste, right?

116
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,510
And he got this...

117
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,650
fancy hotel where...

118
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,370
there's no like communal laundry room.

119
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,950
The only thing you can do is...

120
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,950
send your laundry off to be laundered.

121
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,950
And...

122
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,290
I did it once and it was a hundred dollars!

123
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,090
A pair of panties!

124
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,210
Excuse me.

125
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,310
And a pair of panties is like...

126
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,610
300 yen.

127
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,350
Or... yeah.

128
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,830
I was like, what?

129
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,850
It's ridiculous.

130
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,270
And I can't just keep buying clothes.

131
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,030
You know?

132
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,290
I'm like...

133
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,310
I don't need this many clothes.

134
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,550
So...

135
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,870
You know, now that I'm at a normal person...

136
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,650
place.

137
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,190
A normal person hotel.

138
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,810
That has a normal laundry room.

139
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,970
I can do it myself.

140
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,290
So I've just been like...

141
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,070
in my pajamas all day.

142
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,890
Doing laundry.

143
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,850
It's ridiculous.

144
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,490
A peasant hotel.

145
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,370
Yeah, exactly!

146
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,330
But like...

147
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:27,750
Oh my gosh.

148
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,270
And I was like, I don't need anything special.

149
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,830
They like wrapped all my clothes.

150
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,150
And they put like...

151
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,630
They put like...

152
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,410
Oh my god, the coffee is too strong.

153
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,430
The smell is too strong.

154
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,090
Oh my god.

155
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,650
Oh, it's getting in my nostrils.

156
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,130
They put like...

157
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,270
You know, like a sheet of paper in between.

158
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,830
When they folded my clothes.

159
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,670
And then they wrapped it all in plastic.

160
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,910
And I was just like...

161
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,670
I don't need this.

162
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,370
Just make it...

163
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,270
Cut the price in half.

164
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,370
And do less the work.

165
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,470
I was like, no way.

166
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,710
This is so expensive.

167
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:02,970
I was like, no way.

168
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,350
So...

169
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,550
They sweet talk your clothes.

170
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,050
But it feels like they should, right?

171
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,570
I never ever have done laundry service at a hotel before.

172
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,890
That was my first time ever.

173
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,910
So I was like, wow.

174
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,870
This is unnecessary.

175
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,270
So now...

176
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,290
I'm just waiting on clothes.

177
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,970
And then... yeah.

178
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,770
So, perfect time to stream, right?

179
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,010
While I'm waiting on clothes.

180
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,270
Unnecessary.

181
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,550
Just like un-metal.

182
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,310
The game that I'm actually playing today.

183
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm sorry, I keep looking over at my coffee.

184
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,330
Do you think it's done?

185
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,250
How long does coffee sit for?

186
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,950
Well, it's supposed to drip.

187
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,770
But it's soaking.

188
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,750
If you have too many pants...

189
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,950
I can help you get rid of some...

190
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,030
What?

191
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,590
Wait.

192
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,790
I can't tell if it's a joke or not.

193
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,910
A couple minutes?

194
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,330
Okay.

195
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,030
Is this a joke?

196
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,790
I can't tell.

197
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,450
lol lol lol

198
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,570
Oh, man.

199
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,530
No, luckily I brought every pair of panties I own.

200
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,650
So I had excess.

201
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,650
I'm one of those types of people.

202
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:34,970
You know?

203
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,910
That like, I'll bring excess socks.

204
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,190
I'll bring excess underwear.

205
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,790
But for clothes, I don't bring enough.

206
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,690
And so I had to go buy some stuff.

207
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,030
There was like... I was going to a live... I was going to... I think... Yeah, I was going to an idol show.

208
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,690
And especially... like usually I can wear clothes like... I don't know, like a t-shirt twice or something.

209
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,330
But... not in this heat?

210
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:08,190
Oh my gosh, I've been sweating like I've been coming home and my shirt and everything is just soaked with ectoplasm.

211
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,430
So I'm just like, the hell?

212
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,210
No, I'm not wearing this twice in a row.

213
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,650
So... so... I had to go buy more stuff.

214
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,790
I was just like... I was like, wait, there's no laundry room here?

215
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,150
Okay, I guess I'll go buy more clothes.

216
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,470
It's a joke.

217
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,910
I'm weird but with boundaries.

218
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,330
We all... let's say it together, everybody.

219
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:35,910
Boundaries.

220
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,510
Thank you for clarifying.

221
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,050
I really...

222
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,950
I appreciate it.

223
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,850
Weird but boundaries.

224
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,890
Yeah!

225
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,850
Weird but boundaries!

226
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,710
I'm very excited to play Unmetal.

227
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,590
Oh my gosh, it's already been 15 minutes.

228
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,410
I'm so sorry, everybody.

229
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:07,310
I've heard... I have known about this game for... probably since I first started playing Metal Gear.

230
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,790
People would be like, you need to try Unmetal.

231
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,750
Once you play Metal Gear, you'll appreciate Unmetal so much.

232
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,730
You need to play it.

233
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,250
It's like the best...

234
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,430
The best, like, parody of Metal Gear.

235
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,570
And I'm like, okay, I'll get around to it.

236
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,710
And, you know, I kind of forgot about it for a while.

237
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,250
And then I was like, oh, hey!

238
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:26,990
Unmetal!

239
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,890
Like, I need games while I'm here that I can play easily on my laptop.

240
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,950
So... it was my birthday yesterday.

241
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,910
Halfway to 70 now.

242
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:35,950
Thanks for the streams.

243
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,890
I really enjoy your streams.

244
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,130
Andreas, happy birthday!

245
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,330
I hope I said your name right.

246
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,310
I hope I said your name right.

247
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,950
Happy birthday to you.

248
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,170
Happy birthday to you.

249
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,830
Happy birthday, Andreas.

250
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,630
Happy birthday to you.

251
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,870
Happy birthday!

252
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,390
And... did I... did my eyes deceive me?

253
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,070
Thank you for the 50 gift!

254
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,290
Thank you so much!

255
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,530
Thank you!

256
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,150
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

257
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,050
Finally a time to watch the face-con survive.

258
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,390
I just want to say, you killed it, Mint!

259
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,810
So fun to see you in your element like that.

260
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,470
Thank you!

261
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,470
I don't know how long the VOD will be up for.

262
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,590
So, um...

263
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,430
If you haven't watched it yet, try to...

264
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,870
When you can!

265
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,030
Alrighty.

266
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,650
I started a game just to kind of see...

267
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,330
I'm not playing with a key...

268
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,870
Wait, I'm a liar.

269
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,910
I am playing with a keyboard and mouse.

270
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,750
I am not playing with a controller.

271
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,650
So I wanted to see how the gameplay was.

272
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,410
How would you say I should...

273
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,990
Medium, right?

274
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,130
That's normal, right?

275
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,670
Medium?

276
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,810
Hold on, let me get my coffee.

277
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,750
Hold on, let me remove the drip.

278
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,770
Let me remove the drip.

279
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,170
The dev message.

280
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,570
What's the dev message?

281
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,550
Wait, I don't know that one at all.

282
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,770
Invisible booze!

283
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,750
Thank you for the $20 gift card!

284
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

285
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,920
There we go.

286
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
Is it face connect coffee?

287
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,240
No, I literally said it's Hawaii!

288
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,940
I said it earlier.

289
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,040
Okay.

290
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,800
We'll do medium.

291
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,360
Let me get my coffee.

292
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,460
And then we'll try the medium.

293
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,520
One second.

294
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,880
One second.

295
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,910
What's that one dessert?

296
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,130
It's like a...

297
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,650
You're absurd.

298
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,230
Worms and dirt dessert.

299
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,650
It looks like that.

300
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,850
Where like the crumble...

301
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,370
Like the dirt is just chocolate.

302
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,530
It's like a chocolate crumble.

303
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,030
Do you think if I eat coffee grind raw...

304
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,570
I'll get sick?

305
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,910
I wonder.

306
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,130
Mud pie?

307
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,330
No!

308
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,650
You know, like the worms in the dirt.

309
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,110
Like it's just like they...

310
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,890
It's like...

311
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,070
It's like a Oreo crumble kind of.

312
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,590
And then they put gummy worms in it.

313
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,410
Right?

314
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,090
Okay, I'm gonna try this coffee.

315
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,310
It's...

316
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,150
It's really...

317
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,390
Hold on, did I get it?

318
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,170
Hold on.

319
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,430
I left the package over there.

320
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,890
And it's like a pain in the butt to leave this desk and go over there.

321
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,180
It's...

322
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,920
It doesn't say actually.

323
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,760
It says it's a butterscotch flavor.

324
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,860
But it's really strong smell.

325
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,440
The smell is so strong.

326
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,540
It doesn't say if it's like a light roast or dark roast or anything.

327
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,520
It just says butterscotch and I impulse bought it.

328
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,340
And yes, I did also buy tea.

329
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,580
For anybody wondering.

330
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,580
Yes, I only bought one thing of coffee.

331
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,920
And then...

332
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,380
And then a whole bunch of tea.

333
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,080
Sameer, does Minto sound a bit...

334
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,160
What?

335
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,040
Because of my cold?

336
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,720
What do you mean?

337
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,540
I know I sound a little different.

338
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,560
Because I'm stuffy.

339
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,980
Actually, I woke up and I was feeling much better today.

340
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,500
So...

341
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,180
Not as much congestion.

342
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,180
I haven't had to blow my nose even once.

343
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,740
I'm so happy.

344
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,820
Okay, time to...

345
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,340
Oh my god, the smell is really strong.

346
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,980
I could smell it while it was brewing.

347
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,500
Okay.

348
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,560
It's not bad actually.

349
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,880
The butterscotch is more of a smell less than a flavor.

350
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,600
Which doesn't make much sense, huh?

351
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,720
Those things are connected.

352
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,920
Okay.

353
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,460
Medium is premium.

354
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,220
Oh.

355
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,780
We're just getting right into it.

356
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,120
Whoa!

357
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,540
We're just getting right into it.

358
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:37,780
Okay.

359
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,960
As the pilot emerged from the wreckage, he was arrested by the same bastards who shot him down.

360
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh my god.

361
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,440
And later was brought to a military base for interrogation.

362
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,760
Interrogation.

363
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,720
That pilot... was me.

364
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,700
Name?

365
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,940
My name is Fox.

366
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,380
Jesse Fox.

367
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,220
Fox!

368
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,420
You don't seem to be Russian.

369
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,480
Russian?

370
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,180
Me?

371
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,080
You were piloting a Russian aircraft two hours ago.

372
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,520
I also drive a Toyota and I'm not Japanese.

373
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
All right, mister.

374
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,620
Mr. Fox.

375
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,460
He's so sassy.

376
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,240
Before arresting you, I'm obligated to write down a report with your version of the facts.

377
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,980
So, tell us what the hell you were doing in that heavily armed Soviet helicopter.

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,120
It's a long story.

379
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,520
Sergeant, bring us some coffee.

380
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,460
Yes, sir.

381
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,140
That's a good thing I got coffee.

382
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,220
What cost you?

383
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,200
Bring the lieutenant some coffee.

384
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,520
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,780
So and so.

386
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,220
Well, Mr. Fox.

387
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,820
We have plenty of time.

388
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,860
Bring the lieutenant some coffee.

389
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,860
Explain what happened.

390
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,700
Mr. Fox.

391
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,240
In 1972, a crack commando unit threw me in a prison for a crime I didn't commit.

392
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,200
You're under arrest for a crime you didn't commit.

393
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:53,300
I promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the underground, trying to survive from these soldiers of fortune.

394
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,960
Thank you.

395
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh, we're in the game.

396
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,380
Okay.

397
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,980
So, it's not wasp.

398
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,800
Let's start from the beginning.

399
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,940
How did you escape from that cell?

400
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,500
I don't know.

401
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,360
Piece of cake.

402
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,600
I just had to write a note.

403
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,340
A note.

404
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,600
A note.

405
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,740
Where'd you get the paper from?

406
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,260
I made it.

407
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,420
I used toilet paper.

408
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:19,900
Oh.

409
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,600
I see.

410
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,200
And how did you find a pen?

411
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,280
I mean, it's kind of paper, right?

412
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,480
A pen.

413
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,020
I was in a dirty, grimy cell.

414
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,400
Not in an office.

415
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
I wrote the note with a rusty wire.

416
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,440
Using my own blood as ink.

417
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,800
Ew.

418
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,120
Press X to punch.

419
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,520
Punch, punch, punch, punch.

420
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh.

421
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,040
Rusty wire.

422
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,220
Oh my gosh.

423
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,320
I hope we got our shots.

424
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,060
Let me out of here.

425
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,460
Let me out of here.

426
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,480
Let me out of here.

427
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:51,720
Oh.

428
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,080
There's our toilet paper.

429
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Press F to enter the inventory menu.

430
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,240
Combine items.

431
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,860
Combine.

432
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,560
Combine.

433
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,820
I scratched my arm with the wire and got to work.

434
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,000
Eww.

435
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,820
It wasn't easy.

436
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,500
Okay.

437
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,480
The toilet paper tore under the pressure of the rusty wire.

438
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,340
Was he able to write this note at all?

439
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,020
Those bastards gave us cheap paper.

440
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,720
One ply, unscented and unpatterned.

441
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,340
Why did you break the toilet?

442
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,420
Why not grab the paper like a normal person?

443
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,080
You know how prison is.

444
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,540
It's kill or be killed.

445
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,220
So true.

446
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,240
And I wasn't going to be killed by some dirty toilet.

447
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,040
One ply.

448
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,240
Oh.

449
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Hey, you moron.

450
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,400
Holy Jesus.

451
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm so sorry.

452
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,600
Oh my god.

453
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,380
Wait.

454
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
How are we alive?

455
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,880
You schmuck.

456
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,960
Do you really think I'd be stupid enough to kill myself?

457
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,440
Kill myself?

458
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,940
Press X.

459
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,640
Press...

460
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,100
Wait.

461
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,820
Keep X pressed close to a flashing enemy to search him.

462
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,020
He may be carrying something.

463
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,220
Give me the key.

464
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,620
Yeah, baby.

465
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,700
Cell key.

466
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,400
Idiot.

467
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,140
Idiot.

468
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,400
Dummy.

469
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,480
Idiot.

470
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:07,720
Dummy.

471
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:07,920
Dummy.

472
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,040
Dummy.

473
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,240
Dummy.

474
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,720
Put him on the toilet.

475
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,000
Sticky.

476
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,480
Press...

477
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,760
Okay.

478
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,600
Go to the inventory.

479
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:15,980
Okay.

480
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,380
We're learning.

481
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,460
X and C.

482
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,520
Nice.

483
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,660
Here I go.

484
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,820
I left the guard locked in the cell.

485
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,700
Then I threw away the key and got out of there.

486
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Mr. Fox, what about the noose?

487
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,220
Where did you get that from?

488
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,580
Oh, yeah.

489
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,120
Where did I get the noose?

490
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,080
Are you seriously asking me that?

491
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,280
I am, Mr. Fox.

492
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:35,960
Fox.

493
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,780
I'll tell you later.

494
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,140
Press F4 to see controls of the game and then change them as you wish.

495
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,700
Oh, perfect.

496
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,040
Okay.

497
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,740
Cool.

498
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:47,980
Okay.

499
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,820
Oh, here we go.

500
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,660
Wait, so if I... F... Okay, so we don't have it anymore.

501
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,760
Let's see.

502
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,140
Yeah, the noose isn't important.

503
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,500
Oh!

504
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,480
I found myself in a prison yard surrounded by some buildings.

505
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,460
There were piles of boxes and other stuff here and there.

506
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,960
And the ground was plain dirt.

507
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,400
Oh, and it was night.

508
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,140
Search for an exit of... What did it say?

509
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,860
Of the prison?

510
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,360
Okay, so X to punch.

511
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,740
Gonna go over here.

512
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Punch, punch, punch.

513
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,340
Oh, I actually can punch this.

514
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

515
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,080
Punch, punch, punch.

516
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,220
Oh, this is gonna cause a distraction.

517
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,960
You know?

518
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,540
It'll like... It'll like...

519
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,420
Explode.

520
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,280
Oh.

521
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Okay, just kidding.

522
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,080
This looks punchable.

523
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,640
Aha!

524
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,840
And what is this?

525
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,560
The Great Escape.

526
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,040
Okay.

527
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,900
Oh!

528
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,620
Let me sleep.

529
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,100
Be quiet.

530
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,620
How's the audio, by the way?

531
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,280
Oh!

532
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,110
I can punch him, I can insult him, or I can...

533
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,710
I'm gonna punch him.

534
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,950
Oh, I think I'm dead.

535
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,770
Oh no, wait!

536
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,510
Chad is blocking my health and stuff.

537
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,470
It's fine, you guys.

538
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,210
Let's see.

539
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,950
How can I move the interface?

540
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,850
A little bit.

541
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,350
Hmm.

542
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,490
I'm gonna move...

543
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,430
Hmm.

544
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,090
Cause you guys are blocking the health and stuff.

545
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,690
And I'm sure there will be stuff down here.

546
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,090
Like on the bottom right, too.

547
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,010
Oh...

548
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,630
Hmm...

549
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,010
Sorry, you guys.

550
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,870
You guys are still gonna be flush to the right.

551
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,710
But I'm gonna put you on the left, okay?

552
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,030
Oh, sorry.

553
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,530
Oh, it looks so bad.

554
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,950
No!

555
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,350
Oh, it doesn't work!

556
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,550
Oh, curse my setup!

557
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,210
Why is it so particular?

558
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,870
Oh...

559
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,110
Oh, gosh.

560
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,930
Give me a second.

561
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,890
Hold on, let me fix this.

562
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,130
Ah...

563
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,010
Sorry, I even checked to make sure that...

564
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:37,810
No!

565
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,450
Oh, hold on, hold on.

566
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,130
...

567
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,450
We can do this.

568
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,150
We can do this.

569
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,630
We can do this.

570
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,030
...

571
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,090
...

572
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,570
I'm a genius, you guys.

573
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,150
I'm a professional.

574
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,130
...

575
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,970
...

576
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,130
And as for me...

577
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,490
...

578
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,870
I'll go right next to you guys.

579
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,710
Actually, I'm gonna squish myself.

580
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,210
...

581
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,570
...

582
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,030
There we go.

583
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,670
That should be good.

584
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,590
That should be better.

585
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,430
Probably.

586
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,890
Are we good now, guys?

587
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,310
Are we good?

588
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,010
...

589
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,190
Okay.

590
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,210
Okay.

591
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,210
I think we're good.

592
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:24,770
Let's go.

593
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,010
Continue.

594
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,730
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

595
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,430
Oh, I'm still, like, blocking.

596
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,330
I feel like a good...

597
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,870
Why has my head gotta be so big?

598
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,350
Okay.

599
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,130
I didn't know that he would attack me.

600
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,790
...

601
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,550
Be quiet.

602
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,490
So we can punch these ones.

603
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,350
And we can punch these ones.

604
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,410
...

605
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,050
...

606
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,670
...

607
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,890
...

608
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:51,950
...

609
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:51,970
...

610
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,150
...

611
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,530
...

612
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,350
...

613
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,870
...

614
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,930
Oh.

615
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,070
...

616
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,490
Okay.

617
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,150
Wait, so they're reusable?

618
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,990
That's so nice.

619
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,070
Stops bleeding, doesn't recover health.

620
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,750
Infinitely reusable.

621
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,150
Let's go.

622
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,730
Wow.

623
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,950
What's in here?

624
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,090
We love Minto's giant pumpkin hide.

625
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,510
Thanks, Jax!

626
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,310
Oh, let me move the notice as well over... there we go, okay.

627
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,410
Anybody in here?

628
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,470
Nope.

629
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,930
What about this?

630
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,710
Oh!

631
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,590
Oh!

632
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,350
Let me sleep!

633
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,950
Okay, not everything is punchable, I guess.

634
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,970
Oh, this is punchable!

635
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,490
Why did you keep punching those crates?

636
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,190
What did you expect to happen?

637
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,730
Nothing in particular.

638
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,770
Then why this gratuitous violence?

639
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,270
I don't know.

640
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,430
I suppose I got lost in the moment.

641
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,450
You know, for being imprisoned for a crime I didn't commit.

642
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,070
So true.

643
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,790
But also, why am I describing, like, hitting the crates and everything?

644
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,330
I thought everyone would be asleep at night.

645
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,150
That it was safe to escape.

646
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,050
Safe to escape.

647
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,510
I was dead wrong.

648
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,050
Oh no.

649
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,170
I noticed the presence of...

650
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:23,990
One?

651
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,570
Two?

652
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,510
Notice the presence of what?

653
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,630
One rat?

654
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,770
One cat?

655
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,670
One... Two?

656
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,780
Two.

657
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,040
Why are you guys saying two?

658
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,300
Pick number three, my lord.

659
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,560
All on two?

660
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,640
I guess... I mean, two is the bigger number.

661
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,120
So two of something would be better than one of something, right?

662
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,540
Two!

663
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,000
Two guards on the night shift.

664
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,790
If you're detected by a guard, he will grant no experience when you neutralize him.

665
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,650
I'm against the wall.

666
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:21,810
Okay.

667
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,250
Here's our chance to learn how to take out guards.

668
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,510
Wait!

669
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,110
But there's a little box over there.

670
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,970
Well, look at them walking together in tandem.

671
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,290
And, um... they're really good pals.

672
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,810
How big is their line of sight, I wonder?

673
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,210
Okay, hold on.

674
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,910
So whenever they...

675
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,350
turn their backs...

676
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,750
Oh gosh.

677
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,610
I feel like now would have been the perfect thing.

678
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,750
Metal Gear with supermassive narrator setup.

679
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:53,810
Okay, hold on.

680
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,050
Wow, they move really fast.

681
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,630
They turn around really quickly.

682
00:31:59,410 --> 00:31:59,890
Okay.

683
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,920
Oh gosh.

684
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,900
Don't look!

685
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,600
Turn around!

686
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,180
Turn around!

687
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,360
You jerks!

688
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,840
Stop looking left and right.

689
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,160
Now's my chance.

690
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,740
No it's not!

691
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,980
Now's my chance!

692
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,420
Oh my god.

693
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,840
You're a tough guy.

694
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,820
What does that radar mean?

695
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,700
What does that mean?

696
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,340
I'm scared.

697
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,100
What does that mean?

698
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:52,290
Does that mean he won't be able to see me if...

699
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,270
he's sneezing during...

700
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,270
I was injured and losing blood.

701
00:32:59,470 --> 00:32:59,750
Oh no.

702
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,550
I had to heal that wound...

703
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,850
before I bled to death.

704
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,310
Okay.

705
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:03,830
Okay.

706
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,630
F.

707
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,010
And then our...

708
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,830
Select and use.

709
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,250
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.

710
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,570
Okay, all good.

711
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,170
What's he got?

712
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,850
He's got...

713
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,810
a handkerchief!

714
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,590
Oh, ew.

715
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,070
It's used.

716
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,730
Anything else?

717
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:22,790
Come here.

718
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,810
Let's put you...

719
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,130
Um...

720
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,070
Actually, I'm taking you with me.

721
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,470
Oh, I really can take him with me.

722
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,470
Wait a second.

723
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,090
Oh, he's peeing.

724
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,990
Okay.

725
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,790
See ya.

726
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,450
If I hit...

727
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,090
Can you hear this?

728
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,550
Can you hear this?

729
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,310
No, he can't.

730
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,010
Okay, here we go.

731
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,930
Oh, we're in the bathroom.

732
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,030
Use the toilet to save the game.

733
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,030
Sorry.

734
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:05,790
Oh, gosh.

735
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,550
No way.

736
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,670
That's actually how we save the game?

737
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,850
I'm going to do one more thing real quick, you guys.

738
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,190
I'm just going to...

739
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,430
Oh, my bad.

740
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:21,790
Hold on.

741
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,230
I'm trying to shrink us both together.

742
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,320
Hold on.

743
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,060
I want to make it just a tiny...

744
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,820
The game is all over the place.

745
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,800
So, I'm sorry.

746
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,480
That's like a little weird right now.

747
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,600
Sorry, guys.

748
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm so sorry.

749
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,260
I'm so sorry.

750
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,000
So sorry.

751
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,560
Give me a second.

752
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,940
Okay.

753
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,940
There we go.

754
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,080
Tiny Minto in a tiny box.

755
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,660
There we go.

756
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,360
Cool.

757
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,640
Onwards.

758
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,640
There's nobody here.

759
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:03,940
Oh.

760
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,620
Over here.

761
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,460
Contact.

762
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,220
Contact the prisoner.

763
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,080
Yeah.

764
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,660
Hello?

765
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,140
You talking to me?

766
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,940
You talking to me?

767
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,940
You talking to me?

768
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,780
My name is Colonel Alan Harris.

769
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,140
Colonel.

770
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm Jesse Fox.

771
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,020
Okay.

772
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,300
I'm not military, Colonel.

773
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,080
Tell me, Fox.

774
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,380
What the hell are you doing here?

775
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,340
Fox.

776
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,800
I've been jailed for a crime I didn't commit.

777
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,740
What was the crime?

778
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,200
I wonder.

779
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,280
Do you know how to get out of here?

780
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,380
I tried to escape through any sewer.

781
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,000
There must be one nearby.

782
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,180
A sewer, huh?

783
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,440
Because it stinks when it stinks.

784
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,560
Yeah.

785
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,300
What about you, Colonel?

786
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,860
I've been tortured.

787
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,360
My legs won't make it.

788
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,000
No, Colonel.

789
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,420
But if you bring me a radio.

790
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,020
A radio?

791
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,060
I can help you escape.

792
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:50,640
Okay.

793
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,220
Hold on.

794
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,620
Harris.

795
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,000
Are you sure you heard him say, Alan Harris?

796
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,100
Yes, sir.

797
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,260
Saw him yesterday.

798
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,440
It was just yesterday?

799
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
Colonel Harris died a month ago in an ambush.

800
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,000
Well, it's the name that stubborn old man gave me.

801
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,220
I see.

802
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,440
I'll write down on the list.

803
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,540
I'll write down the report that you talked to Colonel Harris after his death.

804
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,440
Continue your story.

805
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,240
The death was a cover-up.

806
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,360
The death was...

807
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,820
The death was something.

808
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,920
Okay.

809
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,660
Search for a radio for Colonel Harris.

810
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,040
Okay.

811
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,520
Got it.

812
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,720
But also the sewer, right?

813
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,840
What's that?

814
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,540
What's this?

815
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,100
Continents.

816
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,440
What's that?

817
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,600
Under some crates.

818
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,140
I found it.

819
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,960
I found my salvation.

820
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,100
Oh, I got it.

821
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,580
A sewer hole.

822
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,740
I need Scissor 61.

823
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,620
There was no ladder.

824
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,880
I couldn't see the bottom.

825
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,400
Oh, no.

826
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
I needed to find a ladder or a rope if I wanted to go down.

827
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,720
What about the rope that we used for the noose?

828
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,100
You fool.

829
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,020
Okay, cool.

830
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,140
Let's go down.

831
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,820
A radio, huh?

832
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:15,890
Possible.

833
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,010
Everyone knows Colonel Harris died in that tanker two years ago.

834
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,050
Colonel Harris.

835
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,410
Colonel Harris.

836
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,750
How do I, like, sneak up on these guys and attack them, you know?

837
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:37,170
If I, like, sneak up and hold X, I wonder if I'll, like, be able to do some big damage, you know?

838
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:37,950
Let's try.

839
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,170
Oh.

840
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,730
Oh, I got a star.

841
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,370
I don't know what that just did.

842
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,150
I got...

843
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,230
I took a coin off your card.

844
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,490
A coin?

845
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,990
I'm robbing this man.

846
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,470
What do you intend to spend it on?

847
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,230
I suspect there's no shops open for an escape.

848
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,550
Maybe on a midnight run.

849
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,530
Who said anything about spending?

850
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,850
I used it to distract soldiers.

851
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,250
Oh.

852
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,610
I quickly found out that guards love sticking out free coins off the ground.

853
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,210
Okay.

854
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,570
I got a coin.

855
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,110
Oh.

856
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:08,890
Oh, my God.

857
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

858
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,210
Wait, wait, wait.

859
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,670
I'm scared.

860
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,690
Mike!

861
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,790
Ah!

862
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,330
Are you okay?

863
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,130
Got them both.

864
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,490
What do you got?

865
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,350
A radio!

866
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,510
I picked up the guard's radio.

867
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,050
Oh.

868
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:24,370
Oh.

869
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,370
Without encryption, I knew other guards could listen in on my conversations with Harris.

870
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,630
I see.

871
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,950
You still haven't told me how you got that noose.

872
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,230
Oh.

873
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,150
I'll tell you later.

874
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,970
As I was saying, I needed to find a special encryption circuit to install in the radio.

875
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:40,930
Yes.

876
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,430
Okay.

877
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,590
Attach an encryption circuit to the radio.

878
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,710
It's surely in here.

879
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,190
It's not in there.

880
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,550
Okay.

881
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,610
What about over here?

882
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,930
Let's check out this door since the guy was guarding it.

883
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,810
Seems quite important.

884
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:54,530
Oh!

885
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,790
God mode artifact.

886
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:58,490
What?

887
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,870
What does that mean?

888
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,970
Grants limited invulnerability when a ring is sacrificed.

889
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,590
What?

890
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,550
What does that mean?

891
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,190
Why is it literally gravity falls?

892
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,930
Oh.

893
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,350
Sorry.

894
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,990
I was pressing with Wasta again.

895
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,910
Press V to roll.

896
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,830
Okay.

897
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,450
Oh.

898
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:25,870
Secrets.

899
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,970
Oh, now we know how to roll.

900
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,070
We're on a roll.

901
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,090
Mike.

902
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,870
Oh no, Mike.

903
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,630
Press X twice over a guard to carry him.

904
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,410
Okay.

905
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:41,670
Yeah.

906
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,170
Let me sleep.

907
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,030
Let me sleep.

908
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:46,710
Oh.

909
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,390
Okay.

910
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,870
Let's see.

911
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:51,570
Um.

912
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,870
What's this guy doing up here?

913
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,010
I think this guy next to me will notice him.

914
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,790
Hmm.

915
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:01,790
Oh.

916
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,590
What's this guy doing down here?

917
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,590
How do you throw the coin?

918
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,330
That's a good question.

919
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:08,830
Let's see.

920
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,310
I think if I select it and then if I use it, it will use it, right?

921
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,070
Yeah.

922
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,250
Yeah.

923
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,410
Yeah.

924
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,250
Oh gosh.

925
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,150
This guy's coming around.

926
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,330
Wait a second.

927
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,790
Is this guy coming around?

928
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,650
Don't come around.

929
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,290
Oh.

930
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:21,490
Okay.

931
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,570
Okay.

932
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,130
X300.

933
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,650
Thanks for the five gifted.

934
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,870
Thank you.

935
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:29,730
Um.

936
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,490
Okay.

937
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:30,770
Hold on.

938
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,650
How do I use it now?

939
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,070
Uh.

940
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,370
Wait.

941
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,970
How do I use an item?

942
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,570
I don't remember.

943
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,850
I'll figure it out.

944
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,250
It's fine.

945
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,430
Uh.

946
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,290
Let's go punch this guy.

947
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:46,610
Aha.

948
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,650
And ransack him.

949
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,050
Oh.

950
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,910
We got another coin.

951
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,370
And we're just gonna...

952
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:51,530
Oh.

953
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:51,990
Okay.

954
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,510
We're gonna pick him up.

955
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,370
See ya.

956
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,210
Okay.

957
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,070
We're gonna place you right here.

958
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,430
Can I get that thing down there?

959
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,870
Or...

960
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,090
Oh.

961
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:01,650
Uh oh.

962
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,330
Did he notice me?

963
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:04,930
Oh.

964
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,130
Shoot.

965
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:05,730
Oh.

966
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,070
Oh.

967
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,510
Bye.

968
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,030
We're not gonna get noticed today.

969
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,790
This is a stealth game.

970
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:17,810
Oh.

971
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,010
I see the little...

972
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,690
I've always...

973
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,550
I was wondering...

974
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,650
The little dots at the bottom were...

975
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,550
Um.

976
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:25,810
Were...

977
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,510
Just showing you to go to a new area.

978
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,550
I didn't realize it was showing you enemies.

979
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,110
Aha.

980
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,110
Hahaha.

981
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,270
I see.

982
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:34,630
I see.

983
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:34,990
I see.

984
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,470
Okay.

985
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,150
Um.

986
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,030
The music is like picking up.

987
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,530
Hey.

988
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,960
Hey.

989
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,320
Give me your stuff.

990
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:49,780
What's that?

991
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,160
You stole a one-eyed man's patch?

992
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,240
A one-eyed man that would shoot you?

993
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,200
Shoot me without hesitation.

994
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:55,820
Yeah.

995
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,360
Because it was his job.

996
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,960
What you did was macabre.

997
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,660
And suggest you might have a fetish.

998
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,840
Holy Jesus.

999
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,340
Wow.

1000
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,820
That patch turned out to be...

1001
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:03,840
Not the...

1002
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,100
Okay.

1003
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,880
I don't need any commentary from the crowd.

1004
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,280
Okay?

1005
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,840
Mister?

1006
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,160
I got an eye patch.

1007
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,320
Maybe I do have an eye patch fetish.

1008
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,580
I don't...

1009
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,160
Oh my god.

1010
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
I stole his eye.

1011
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,100
What else?

1012
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,360
You removed his glass eye too?

1013
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,180
Um.

1014
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:19,880
Suspicion.

1015
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,280
Stress relief.

1016
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,240
Okay.

1017
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,240
Yes.

1018
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,940
I took it out of his eye socket to chill out.

1019
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,420
To chill out?

1020
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,800
Pulling out glass eyes relaxes you?

1021
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm not a sadist.

1022
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,820
I didn't enjoy pulling it out.

1023
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,960
But it helped when I rolled it around in my mouth like candy.

1024
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,740
I was under a lot of pressure.

1025
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,760
Too much stress and I'd end up making a mistake.

1026
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,900
This game is sick.

1027
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,880
Why did it save the game though?

1028
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,300
This is so...

1029
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,020
This is...

1030
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,260
This game is sick.

1031
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,020
What's that?

1032
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,960
Depleted uranium?

1033
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:05,780
Hello?

1034
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,820
This is another bathroom.

1035
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,680
Hey buddy.

1036
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,240
Oh.

1037
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
I have no paper.

1038
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,900
Oh.

1039
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,100
Can you bring me some?

1040
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,280
I have a toilet paper.

1041
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,760
Press F to enter the inventory.

1042
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,060
Yeah.

1043
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,180
Yeah.

1044
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,320
Yeah.

1045
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,320
Toilet paper?

1046
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,360
And C.

1047
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,540
It's C to use it.

1048
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,640
I was pressing X earlier.

1049
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:25,940
Okay.

1050
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:26,840
Okay.

1051
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,720
There you are.

1052
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,140
Here you are.

1053
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,600
Thanks man.

1054
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,160
You saved my ass.

1055
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,660
Literally.

1056
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,340
Yeah.

1057
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,600
Well.

1058
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,760
Your ass is grass.

1059
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,620
You broke down the door and attacked a guard while he was on the toilet?

1060
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,600
Yes.

1061
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,340
I beat the shit out of him.

1062
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,440
Is that a joke?

1063
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:48,960
Literally.

1064
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,400
No.

1065
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,760
I literally beat the shit out of him.

1066
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,340
That toilet paper wasn't unscented anymore.

1067
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,020
Let's move on.

1068
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,080
No.

1069
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,560
Sir.

1070
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,910
I'm afraid to grab that.

1071
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,230
Oh.

1072
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,550
No.

1073
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,830
Oh.

1074
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,130
Destroy everything.

1075
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,490
Nobody will have clean hands and then they'll all get sick.

1076
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,750
Yeah.

1077
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,450
One ply unpatterned and newly scented.

1078
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:28,570
Yeah.

1079
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,870
The sight of it makes you nervous.

1080
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,990
That's the glass eye.

1081
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:33,830
Sorry.

1082
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:34,810
I'm covering a little bit.

1083
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,730
Um.

1084
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,430
Patch with elastic straps.

1085
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,210
Can I use it?

1086
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,470
Oh.

1087
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,330
Now we know how mint got sick.

1088
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:52,750
Stop.

1089
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:53,810
That's not true.

1090
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,330
I always wash my hands.

1091
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,530
This is what happens when you use the eye patch.

1092
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,570
No way.

1093
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,090
That is so...

1094
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:05,370
Oh.

1095
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:05,970
Oh.

1096
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:06,890
Clever.

1097
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,710
I love that.

1098
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,230
That is so funny.

1099
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,090
Oh.

1100
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,290
Ma'am.

1101
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,130
I'm with the commandos.

1102
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,050
Fox needs to go.

1103
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,150
Why is now my nose all runny?

1104
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:21,390
Okay.

1105
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,090
Anyway.

1106
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,170
Let's keep going before that guy wakes up.

1107
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:28,450
Okay.

1108
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,190
Wait.

1109
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,010
What about this guy out here?

1110
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:30,310
Oh.

1111
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,090
He's still dead.

1112
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,450
Okay.

1113
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,170
I mean down.

1114
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:32,690
Not dead.

1115
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:33,990
Oh.

1116
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:35,850
This guy.

1117
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,250
Oh.

1118
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,070
I can't.

1119
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:40,530
Break the toilets?

1120
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,030
Can I?

1121
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,630
Can I break the toilets actually?

1122
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:45,510
Oh.

1123
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,720
I can't.

1124
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,420
Dang.

1125
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,110
Okay.

1126
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,550
Here we go.

1127
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,650
I hit the knee mode.

1128
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,510
What are you talking about?

1129
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:03,550
Oh.

1130
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:04,950
All right.

1131
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,410
Let's get this guy in.

1132
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,730
Oh.

1133
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,190
Oh.

1134
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,470
Let's get him good.

1135
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,870
Oh.

1136
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,090
Hi.

1137
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:19,630
Hey.

1138
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:19,990
Hey.

1139
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:20,890
Oh.

1140
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,550
Uranium.

1141
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,350
What is that?

1142
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,390
A lighter?

1143
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,050
Okay.

1144
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:28,990
I'll take it.

1145
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,730
Evening mint.

1146
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,110
This sure is goofy.

1147
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,170
Mark of the ninja is highly regarded.

1148
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:36,810
I see.

1149
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:37,310
Thank you.

1150
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,710
Oh.

1151
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,150
I ran into a guard as I went in.

1152
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:41,430
Oh.

1153
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:42,830
Ah.

1154
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:46,370
Zee.

1155
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:46,830
Zee.

1156
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:46,930
Zee.

1157
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,670
Zee.

1158
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:47,810
Zee.

1159
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,990
Zee.

1160
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:48,290
Zee.

1161
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:48,570
Zee.

1162
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:48,810
Zee.

1163
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:48,990
Zee.

1164
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:49,390
Zee.

1165
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:50,490
Zee.

1166
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:50,750
Zee.

1167
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:53,370
Zee.

1168
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:54,790
Zee.

1169
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:55,910
Zee.

1170
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:56,170
Zee.

1171
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:56,290
Zee.

1172
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:56,410
Zee.

1173
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:56,530
Zee.

1174
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:56,730
Zee.

1175
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,030
Zee.

1176
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,970
Zee.

1177
00:46:59,290 --> 00:46:59,590
Zee.

1178
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:02,770
Zee.

1179
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:21,850
Zee.

1180
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,590
Okay, awesome.

1181
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:30,730
Interesting.

1182
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,310
Sorry guys, I gotta blow my nose.

1183
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,670
I was doing so well the whole morning!

1184
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,930
And then I started talking to you guys, and you activated my allergies.

1185
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,170
I'm allergic.

1186
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,650
A potty is a quicksave.

1187
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,090
Okay, hold on.

1188
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,150
I'm gonna mute.

1189
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,180
It's not helping.

1190
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,420
It's not helping.

1191
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:16,640
Gosh.

1192
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,620
Hold on.

1193
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,260
I didn't take any of the medicine this morning.

1194
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,620
I'll take some right now.

1195
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,780
Did you guys take your meds?

1196
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,600
Be like Mito.

1197
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,880
And take your meds.

1198
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,780
When you should.

1199
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,620
Oh, gosh.

1200
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,440
It's so bad.

1201
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,110
Bad hygiene.

1202
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,530
Carrying other people's eyes and used toilet paper.

1203
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,010
I only...

1204
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:05,770
Wait a second.

1205
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:06,430
Your name.

1206
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,290
Made turquoise lover?

1207
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:08,910
Boo!

1208
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,770
I mean, wait.

1209
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,110
I'm not cheering you.

1210
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:13,970
Yeah!

1211
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,230
Get out the child!

1212
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:16,370
Yeah!

1213
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,040
Applause, applause, standing ovation!

1214
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,520
Hold on.

1215
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,080
Let me do one more blow.

1216
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,540
My nose is becoming raw.

1217
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,600
And before you say, one nose...

1218
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,940
But at this point...

1219
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,880
It doesn't help at all, man.

1220
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,580
Blowing my nose.

1221
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,580
Before you say, one nose...

1222
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,490
Oh, he's coming back.

1223
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,530
What's your pattern, mister?

1224
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,250
Where are you gonna go next?

1225
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,250
Where are you...

1226
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,230
Wait, I got his ass now.

1227
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,510
I'm getting all that experience, baby.

1228
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,310
What happens...

1229
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:27,830
Oh, is this a wristwatch?

1230
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,130
Okay.

1231
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,770
What happens when I become level two?

1232
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:33,530
Duh!

1233
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,010
Uranium!

1234
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:35,770
Bombs!

1235
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,470
And it's for no survivors!

1236
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,670
Is there a way to crouch in this game, I wonder?

1237
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,490
With those first aid kits, I could disinfect and heal my wounds.

1238
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,870
First aid!

1239
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:48,950
Good news.

1240
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,330
Those kits stopped any bleeding and also healed my wounds over time.

1241
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:52,670
Oh!

1242
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:53,810
Bad news.

1243
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,170
Once you use them, they were gone.

1244
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:57,570
Rip.

1245
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,990
If I had any magic in me, I'd cast Feel Better now.

1246
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,210
Alas, I am no maid.

1247
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,050
Feel better soon, Minto.

1248
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:04,810
Thank you!

1249
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,010
I appreciate it.

1250
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,290
I don't feel bad.

1251
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:12,970
Just congested is all.

1252
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,410
Like, you know how sometimes if you're congested, you get headaches and stuff like that?

1253
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,190
Luckily, I don't feel that way.

1254
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:23,970
Press X?

1255
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:24,930
Oh!

1256
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,290
Oh my god.

1257
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,110
Woah!

1258
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,630
Sneak attack!

1259
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:35,790
That was crazy!

1260
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,770
Oh, I got some cigarettes.

1261
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,050
I got a snack.

1262
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,690
Why is it always Mike?

1263
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,310
Wait, Mike didn't have anything on him?

1264
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,990
I'm getting a lot of uranium.

1265
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,190
I'm exploring.

1266
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,430
Drag them.

1267
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,310
Knock, knock.

1268
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:01,710
Who's there?

1269
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,890
It's me, Minto.

1270
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,970
Be quiet.

1271
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,430
Oh, there's more down here.

1272
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:11,990
Oh, this actually goes somewhere.

1273
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,570
Oh, we have two areas we can go to.

1274
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:14,990
Okay, hold on.

1275
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,730
Let me drag.

1276
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,970
Let me pick up this guy up.

1277
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:21,790
Pick him up.

1278
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:22,530
Pick him up.

1279
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:22,990
Pick him up.

1280
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:23,270
Pick him up.

1281
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,830
There we go.

1282
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,190
Okay.

1283
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,710
Now we're going to see if we can...

1284
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:29,670
Okay.

1285
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,410
We did actually.

1286
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:30,830
Okay.

1287
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:31,250
Just kidding.

1288
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,010
Just kidding!

1289
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:36,650
Uh-huh.

1290
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,410
All right.

1291
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,070
There's this way.

1292
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,010
And then what's down here?

1293
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:40,950
Oh, a lot.

1294
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,110
A lot of guys.

1295
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:44,770
Hmm.

1296
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,730
Let's go this way first.

1297
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,470
The easy way.

1298
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:48,790
Okay.

1299
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:48,930
Okay.

1300
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:49,190
Okay.

1301
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:49,950
Okay.

1302
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,550
The better way.

1303
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,590
I like the music in this.

1304
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:55,450
Oh!

1305
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,070
Hello, mister.

1306
00:52:58,990 --> 00:52:59,430
Hello?

1307
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,170
Hey, bro.

1308
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,230
Help me.

1309
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,590
Get me out of this hole.

1310
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,490
Get me out of this hole.

1311
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,510
If you're in a cell, it's because you committed a crime.

1312
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:09,450
And I don't free criminals.

1313
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,990
But you're a prisoner, too.

1314
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:15,410
I've been imprisoned for a crime I didn't commit.

1315
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,170
Well, he didn't...

1316
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:16,810
Fuck you!

1317
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:17,110
Oh!

1318
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:17,630
Oh!

1319
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:19,250
Oh!

1320
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,300
Oh!

1321
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,880
Okay.

1322
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,660
Well, I think...

1323
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,240
Hey, friend.

1324
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,680
I'm also innocent.

1325
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,940
That's what they all say.

1326
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,840
Please, they keep the key in that box.

1327
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,460
This...

1328
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,120
Oh, this one?

1329
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,130
Do you think if I use it, it disappears?

1330
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,230
Do you think it's a one-time use?

1331
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,310
The other one disappeared.

1332
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,690
Also, what's this say?

1333
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,730
Digital display for the watch.

1334
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:55,350
The other one disappeared.

1335
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,090
This is the first aid kit.

1336
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,310
Quick saves your current game, but it's lost if you exit the game.

1337
00:53:59,490 --> 00:53:59,830
Interesting.

1338
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,190
Russian.

1339
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:01,950
No filter.

1340
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,930
For the cigarettes.

1341
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:04,970
Hi.

1342
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,690
Well, now we're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we?

1343
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,700
Oh, gross!

1344
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,940
Needs to be emptied.

1345
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,660
Eww!

1346
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,680
Okay.

1347
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,220
Well...

1348
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,500
All right.

1349
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,060
Okay.

1350
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,340
I want to see what happens.

1351
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,100
Hold on.

1352
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,260
I'm opening it.

1353
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,660
Thanks, dude.

1354
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,660
You're welcome.

1355
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,280
Don't kill me.

1356
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,560
Don't kill me.

1357
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,140
What a pity.

1358
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,500
The key broke.

1359
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,360
You bastard!

1360
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,220
It broke!

1361
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,320
Hasta la vista.

1362
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,000
Oh, it saved again.

1363
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:51,520
No!

1364
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,780
It overwrote my save!

1365
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,660
No!

1366
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,520
My medal!

1367
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:02,710
It over...

1368
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,770
I cannot believe it overwrote my save, so that I could...

1369
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:21,200
I love when people in chat are just like, we told you, Mint, as if I see literally every single message that's going by in chat.

1370
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,380
You guys, I'm playing a game.

1371
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:25,820
I'm gaming.

1372
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,200
You also have to just let me experience things, okay?

1373
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,880
VTuber, why?

1374
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,040
VTuber, I told you, VTuber, I told you that it would do.

1375
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,300
Disappear, VTuber, and...

1376
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:43,820
Hello?

1377
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,860
The soldier says to his captain, sir, I need to request leave for this weekend.

1378
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,520
Why do you need it, Private?

1379
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,400
I'm going to have a baby, sir.

1380
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,220
Congratulations.

1381
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:53,820
Request granted.

1382
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,380
Next week, the captain asks him, Private, was it a boy or a girl?

1383
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,540
And the soldier replies, I don't know, sir.

1384
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,720
I'll find out in nine months.

1385
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,600
What's in your closet, Private?

1386
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,020
It's water, sir.

1387
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,600
Don't lie to me.

1388
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,340
This is wine.

1389
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,100
Praise the Lord.

1390
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,700
That was pretty good.

1391
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,900
Wait, tell more.

1392
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,520
Tell more funnies.

1393
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,420
Hey, Mike.

1394
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:27,700
Oh.

1395
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,640
Can you tell them again?

1396
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1397
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,500
Of course.

1398
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,020
The serge said...

1399
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,420
Why you don't listen, VTuber?

1400
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:33,720
Why?

1401
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:34,760
Someone sent you a blank letter.

1402
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,420
Oh, yeah?

1403
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,300
The soldier says, it's from my wife, Sergeant.

1404
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,000
How do you know that, soldier?

1405
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,900
Because we argued and we don't talk to each other.

1406
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,080
Wait, what?

1407
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,260
If I were you, Minto, I would have done the same exact thing.

1408
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,580
The soldier says to his captain, sir, I need to request leave for this weekend.

1409
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,100
Why do you need it, Private?

1410
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:53,800
Oh, is this the baby?

1411
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,040
I'm going to have a baby, sir.

1412
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:55,320
Okay.

1413
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,400
Congratulations.

1414
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,460
Request granted.

1415
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,760
Oh, that was close.

1416
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,080
Next week, the captain asks him, Private...

1417
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,160
I'm level two!

1418
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,700
Oh, Steel Fist, your punches strike twice against enemies in containers.

1419
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:09,980
Your speed and accuracy are the same.

1420
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,020
Your speed increases ten percent.

1421
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,980
Probably the Steel Fists, huh?

1422
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,460
I think the punches are better than the sprinting.

1423
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,240
I'm actually...

1424
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,520
I'm already kind of fast, so let's go with the Fists.

1425
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,740
Was it a boy or a girl?

1426
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,660
And the soldier replies...

1427
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:30,760
Nothing?

1428
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,720
I don't know, sir.

1429
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,940
I'll find out in nine months.

1430
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,740
What's in your closet, Private?

1431
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:39,980
It's water.

1432
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,320
It's water, sir.

1433
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,720
Don't lie to me.

1434
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,420
This is wine.

1435
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,020
I reached a special place...

1436
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,240
Oh.

1437
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,420
...where I found something.

1438
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,200
A special place?

1439
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,180
What, Mr. Fox?

1440
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,920
It was...

1441
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,280
What was it?

1442
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,520
Oh.

1443
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,280
Damn.

1444
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,400
I can't remember.

1445
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,320
It was...

1446
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,380
Um...

1447
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,700
Uh...

1448
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,280
Oh, wow!

1449
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,480
Stop it!

1450
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,440
Stop it!

1451
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,200
It was, uh...

1452
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,800
This thing?

1453
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,420
Oh, what is...

1454
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,080
Oh, what is...

1455
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,040
This...

1456
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,320
Oh...

1457
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,060
What is...

1458
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,960
What is...

1459
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,220
It was a special place.

1460
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:14,700
Um...

1461
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,160
Something...

1462
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,660
Something...

1463
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,600
April 30th?

1464
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,500
The soldier says to his captain, sir...

1465
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,140
An escaping prisoner!

1466
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:24,960
Oh, shoot.

1467
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,260
Ouch!

1468
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,060
Ouch!

1469
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,220
Ouch!

1470
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:29,340
Ouch!

1471
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,200
No!

1472
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,040
I died!

1473
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,360
No!

1474
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,460
Okay, we're back here.

1475
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,120
The question...

1476
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:39,300
What?

1477
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,800
I thought they were telling the joke.

1478
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,620
They were, like, not telling the joke.

1479
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,500
I'm not even looking this way.

1480
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,440
How could they see me?

1481
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,040
Sir, how do you need to request leave for this weekend?

1482
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,640
You're a...

1483
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,400
Why do you need it?

1484
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,380
How do they even see me?

1485
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,400
I'm gonna have a baby, sir.

1486
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,040
Don't look at us.

1487
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:49,840
Congratulations.

1488
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:50,940
Request granted.

1489
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,500
Next week, the captain asks him...

1490
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,440
Private, was it a boy or a girl?

1491
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,060
And the soldier replies...

1492
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,960
Well, they're laughing, probably.

1493
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,440
I don't know, sir.

1494
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,540
Find out in nine months.

1495
00:58:59,540 --> 00:58:59,600
But also...

1496
00:58:59,600 --> 00:58:59,820
Hold on.

1497
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,700
I wish there was, like, a way to know...

1498
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,620
Because we're trying to find the encryption for the...

1499
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,780
For the radio.

1500
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,160
But also, we're trying to find a ladder.

1501
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,000
Was it private?

1502
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,640
These are the only...

1503
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,400
I wish there was, like, a...

1504
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,200
A goals thing, you know?

1505
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,980
Like, under...

1506
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,220
Inventory.

1507
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:15,820
Oh, missions!

1508
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,360
There it is!

1509
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,140
Wait.

1510
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:17,860
How do I get to that?

1511
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,240
How do I...

1512
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,900
How do I switch over?

1513
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,020
Wait.

1514
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,400
How do I switch to...

1515
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,460
Uh...

1516
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,100
Uh...

1517
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,600
X?

1518
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,020
No.

1519
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,860
Uh...

1520
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,360
Uh...

1521
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,140
Q or E?

1522
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:33,680
No.

1523
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,000
Tab?

1524
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:35,360
Oh!

1525
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,080
Tab works.

1526
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:36,620
Thank you.

1527
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,680
Attach an encryption circuit to the radio.

1528
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,600
Look for a rope and climb down into the sewers.

1529
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:40,880
Okay.

1530
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,380
Okay.

1531
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,360
Okay.

1532
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,180
Cool, cool, cool.

1533
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:52,860
Um...

1534
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,540
Praise the Lord!

1535
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,200
Let's see.

1536
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,800
I do wanna take them down.

1537
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,000
Cause I...

1538
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,580
Maybe in the boxes, you know?

1539
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,800
Maybe I have to be really fast.

1540
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:07,860
Hey, Mike.

1541
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:08,260
Yeah.

1542
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,120
Can you tell them again?

1543
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:09,940
Tell them again?

1544
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:10,760
Of course.

1545
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,740
The Sarge says to the soldiers, Someone sent you a blank letter.

1546
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,640
You can load the potty?

1547
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,680
The soldier says...

1548
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:16,900
I can?

1549
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,480
You think so?

1550
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,120
No.

1551
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,720
It's...

1552
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,580
I don't think so, though.

1553
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,300
I don't think so.

1554
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,720
No, I don't think that's how it works.

1555
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,620
I think it's just one save.

1556
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,140
It's from my wife, Sargeant.

1557
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,580
How do you know that, soldier?

1558
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:28,980
Oh, the coin.

1559
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,380
That's right.

1560
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,020
We have the coins.

1561
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:31,660
Okay.

1562
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:32,680
Select.

1563
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,140
And...

1564
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,740
Use.

1565
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,460
Hey.

1566
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,260
A coin.

1567
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,080
Hey.

1568
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,660
You're not going to pick it up, right?

1569
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:41,720
Yeah.

1570
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,360
Why not?

1571
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,820
Come on, Mike.

1572
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,000
It's the oldest trick ever.

1573
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,380
As soon as you crouch down, smack.

1574
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,320
Smack.

1575
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,740
Smack.

1576
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,400
What?

1577
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,420
That ass.

1578
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,660
The owner will show up and kick your ass.

1579
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,160
What?

1580
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,520
Sarge says to the...

1581
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,860
It didn't work!

1582
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,640
The soldier says, It's from my wife, Sargeant.

1583
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,040
How do you know that, soldier?

1584
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,940
Because we argued and we don't talk to each other.

1585
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,160
Maybe if I run up to them while they're laughing.

1586
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,760
Okay.

1587
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,500
I'll try.

1588
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:12,880
I'll try.

1589
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:12,940
I'll try.

1590
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,700
I need to request leave for this weekend.

1591
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,400
Why do you need it, Private?

1592
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,240
I'm going to have a baby, sir.

1593
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,360
The second coin?

1594
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:19,700
Congratulations.

1595
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,660
Let's try the second coin.

1596
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,660
Next week, the captain asks him...

1597
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,520
Private, was it a boy or a girl?

1598
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,880
And the soldier replies...

1599
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,760
They didn't even care.

1600
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,600
I don't know, sir.

1601
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,800
I'll find out in nine months.

1602
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,240
Okay.

1603
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:30,540
Here we go.

1604
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,700
And I got...

1605
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:39,860
See?

1606
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,940
I knew I had to go in here.

1607
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:42,940
I got the rope.

1608
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,420
I got the rope and everything.

1609
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,200
Nice.

1610
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,300
Oh, nice.

1611
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,580
Can I pick up my coins?

1612
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:46,920
I can.

1613
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,140
Okay.

1614
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:48,760
This game owns.

1615
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,560
And we got even more coins.

1616
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,380
No wonder.

1617
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,440
We got some sunglasses.

1618
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,360
Protects the eyes from hard light.

1619
01:01:59,400 --> 01:01:59,840
Oh.

1620
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,820
We're a cool guy wearing our sunglasses at night, you know?

1621
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:05,780
Okay.

1622
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,440
Well, we got a rope.

1623
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:06,940
Perfect.

1624
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,560
Wait.

1625
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,040
People said you can combine stuff, right?

1626
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:12,580
Yeah.

1627
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,640
Combine my lighter.

1628
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:19,660
Dang it.

1629
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,340
Why can't I combine the lighter with the cigarettes?

1630
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,960
Come on now.

1631
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:27,100
But what if the elastic...

1632
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,300
The lethal weapon you created with the patch was a slingshot?

1633
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,060
No way.

1634
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,360
Sort of childish, don't you think?

1635
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,560
What were you gonna shoot?

1636
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,160
I had a feeling because of the shape.

1637
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:38,580
Pebbles?

1638
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,780
Depleted uranium bars.

1639
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,520
Three shots and goodbye guard.

1640
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:42,920
Oh.

1641
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:49,550
Okay.

1642
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:50,890
Press space to shoot.

1643
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,210
And we have 20 uranium.

1644
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,850
That's why we've been picking up the balls.

1645
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:57,330
Okay.

1646
01:02:59,170 --> 01:02:59,690
Mysterious.

1647
01:02:59,810 --> 01:02:59,990
Oh.

1648
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:00,750
What's that?

1649
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,630
Oh, yeah.

1650
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:03,750
Now I remember.

1651
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:04,630
Is it a boss?

1652
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,210
It was that damn grenade guy.

1653
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:06,710
Oh, no.

1654
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:12,250
I wanted to punch the hell out of him.

1655
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,790
But I couldn't reach him.

1656
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,050
Why couldn't you reach him?

1657
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,650
There was a ditch.

1658
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,910
Oh.

1659
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,950
A simple ditch stopped you.

1660
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:21,470
Just jump.

1661
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:23,810
This was no mere simple ditch.

1662
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:24,790
Oh.

1663
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,750
It was full of tentacles.

1664
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:27,310
Oh.

1665
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,810
And blood-stained spears that moved up and down.

1666
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,970
Oh.

1667
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:36,810
And bony arms that tried to grab me.

1668
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:37,210
What?

1669
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,650
And deadly lays.

1670
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:40,230
Okay.

1671
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,490
Okay.

1672
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,130
Mr. Fox.

1673
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,010
I get it.

1674
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,070
You couldn't reach him.

1675
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,030
For your own good, I'll let you go.

1676
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:47,990
A lot include the spears, arms, and tentacles in my report.

1677
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:49,930
Okay.

1678
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:52,870
Now, Mr. Fox, please continue your story.

1679
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:53,790
It is a boss fight.

1680
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:54,090
All right.

1681
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,810
The fight began as he tossed the first grenade at me.

1682
01:03:59,070 --> 01:03:59,550
Wow.

1683
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,470
Grenade guy.

1684
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,050
Oh, my gosh.

1685
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,130
Running away.

1686
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:05,790
Oh.

1687
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,670
I'll be stupid, but not a coward.

1688
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,770
No.

1689
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:08,430
I'm hiding.

1690
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,050
I'm hiding.

1691
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,490
Oh, my gosh.

1692
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:12,710
I'm hiding.

1693
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:13,630
What are you talking about?

1694
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,170
It's not...

1695
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,030
Oh, my gosh.

1696
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,230
There we go.

1697
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,910
I can't tell what the...

1698
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:24,770
Oh, shoot.

1699
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,610
What, like, the...

1700
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:28,990
Nice.

1701
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:31,870
How...

1702
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:32,930
The hitbox, you know?

1703
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:33,470
Oh, shoot.

1704
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:35,010
Oh.

1705
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:38,210
Nice.

1706
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:40,210
Oh.

1707
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,790
Oh, that was close.

1708
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,130
Oh, yeah.

1709
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:43,450
What are you...

1710
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:43,630
Oh.

1711
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,030
Oh.

1712
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:45,250
Oh, shoot.

1713
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:45,970
Oh, shoot.

1714
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:46,570
I'm too slow.

1715
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:47,210
I'm too slow.

1716
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,670
Oh.

1717
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:49,090
.

1718
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:52,650
.

1719
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:54,710
Oh.

1720
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:55,650
.

1721
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:56,470
.

1722
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,850
.

1723
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:56,950
.

1724
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:57,330
.

1725
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:57,350
.

1726
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:57,450
.

1727
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:57,470
.

1728
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:57,490
.

1729
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:57,850
.

1730
01:04:58,410 --> 01:04:58,930
.

1731
01:04:58,930 --> 01:04:59,050
.

1732
01:04:59,050 --> 01:04:59,090
.

1733
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:02,630
I searched the grenade guy.

1734
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:07,570
I searched

1735
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:17,400
the grenade guy.

1736
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,060
Wait, wasn't there a ditch?

1737
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,740
I used the bridge.

1738
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,260
There was a bridge this whole time!

1739
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,480
Oh my god.

1740
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,060
You told me you couldn't cross the ditch.

1741
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,500
Because I didn't see it at first.

1742
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,560
I was completely focused on my opponent.

1743
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,880
So true, so true.

1744
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,240
He's just like me.

1745
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,380
I see.

1746
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:40,420
Nice.

1747
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,180
Give me more uranium balls.

1748
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,280
Give me this.

1749
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,120
You're childish, don't you think?

1750
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,780
What are these challenges?

1751
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,520
He had a hook for a hand!

1752
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,900
Nothing else.

1753
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,720
Okay, cool.

1754
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,920
Now we can head back.

1755
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,200
Oh my gosh, everybody's still asleep.

1756
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,320
We can go into the ditch.

1757
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,160
I like this Mr. Fox guy.

1758
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:10,980
What a goofball.

1759
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:16,970
Nice.

1760
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:18,310
Woah!

1761
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,310
What the heck?

1762
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,630
I just noticed his portrait.

1763
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:21,430
Hello?

1764
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,130
Are you in there?

1765
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:26,450
Okay.

1766
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,070
Let's combine the hook...

1767
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,430
Oops.

1768
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:33,130
Combine with...

1769
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:33,930
that.

1770
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,150
Rope with hook.

1771
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:36,190
Perfect.

1772
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,060
Before going down, I had to tend to some matters with Harris.

1773
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:45,760
Oh.

1774
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,540
Just kidding.

1775
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:48,760
Um...

1776
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,800
Fox is actually an 80-year-old man telling these fake war stories to his grandkids.

1777
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:54,680
This is literally...

1778
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,100
This is literally what Twin Snakes is.

1779
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,540
Sorry.

1780
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,240
I thought...

1781
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,260
My desk started to move.

1782
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,800
I think I accidentally hit it.

1783
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,800
I was like, wait, is there an earthquake?

1784
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,480
Um...

1785
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,700
Yeah, the encrypted radio...

1786
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,020
How do I get that?

1787
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:13,960
...

1788
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,840
Was there anything in here?

1789
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:19,640
...

1790
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,200
Uh-uh.

1791
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,980
I didn't forget about the radio.

1792
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,160
I just, uh...

1793
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,940
feel like I've looked everywhere.

1794
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,160
...

1795
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,500
Punch the computers?

1796
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,160
Oh, go back to the computer room.

1797
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,500
Oh, so there was more in here.

1798
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,320
Why didn't I think to punch the computers?

1799
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,720
Oh gosh, I'm losing my...

1800
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,300
Ah!

1801
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,820
I had the circuit.

1802
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,180
I just had to attach it to the radio.

1803
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,920
I'm losing my touch.

1804
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,500
Of course!

1805
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:49,220
Why didn't I think to punch the computers?

1806
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,300
Why didn't I think to punch the computers?

1807
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:50,800
Thank you guys.

1808
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,180
Of course.

1809
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,440
It only makes sense.

1810
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,120
Combined with the radio.

1811
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:01,740
With the modified radio, I could speak to Harris with no one listening.

1812
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,140
Now, I just had to bring it to him.

1813
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,440
This is real technology.

1814
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,260
And the news later.

1815
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,360
Why can't you just...

1816
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,960
Use like the bed sheets or something, man.

1817
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:19,010
Though they probably don't give bed sheets in prison, huh?

1818
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:21,790
Though they probably don't give bed sheets in prison, huh?

1819
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:22,570
Here you are, Colonel.

1820
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,650
A radio.

1821
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,750
I've modified it to encrypt the signal.

1822
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,010
Good job, son.

1823
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,210
Do you have another one for you?

1824
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,450
Not yet.

1825
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:35,370
I'll call you through channel one as soon as I find another.

1826
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,790
Good luck, son.

1827
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,570
And Godspeed.

1828
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:39,870
Thank you!

1829
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,950
Obtain an encrypted radio.

1830
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,510
We got a second chip, so...

1831
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,330
Can I go down now?

1832
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,230
I was about to go down that hole.

1833
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,790
When?

1834
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,790
When I remembered that I still hadn't radioed the Colonel.

1835
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:53,290
Okay.

1836
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,930
Alright, we gotta go find a...

1837
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,050
A guard.

1838
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,990
They wake up though, right?

1839
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,850
Like, these guys have been down for a while.

1840
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,270
Maybe I just search one.

1841
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:05,810
Oh!

1842
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,320
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1843
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,540
Oh, this guy.

1844
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,230
Okay, we still have this guy.

1845
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:25,970
Oh, single guard, I think.

1846
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,710
I think this is the only guy still awake.

1847
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,650
Like, actually.

1848
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,670
I think he might be our only chance.

1849
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,280
Whoa!

1850
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:39,720
Yeah!

1851
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,280
Aw, man.

1852
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,660
But I got spotted.

1853
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:45,620
I got spotted.

1854
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:47,860
Hello?

1855
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,720
Where's your radio?

1856
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,460
Oh, thank you.

1857
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,680
Okay.

1858
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:53,520
What else you got?

1859
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,260
Nothing?

1860
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:54,600
Okay.

1861
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:55,580
Oh,

1862
01:09:59,240 --> 01:09:59,900
I reached level...

1863
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,560
I got...

1864
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,880
I just got the achievement for reaching level 2.

1865
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,380
That's so funny.

1866
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,220
More uranium.

1867
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:12,510
Okay, well...

1868
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,550
Combine with this.

1869
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,670
With the radio encrypted, I could talk to Harris.

1870
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,830
Yippee!

1871
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,950
I wouldn't have been able to escape without his help.

1872
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:25,110
I hate to admit it, but the grumpy old man gave some good advice.

1873
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:26,090
How do you know that, though?

1874
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:27,970
Press W to use the radio.

1875
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,030
Moshi moshi.

1876
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,310
Oh, line 1.

1877
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,970
Colonel, do you copy?

1878
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:36,770
Copy.

1879
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,330
I found a rope to go down the sewer.

1880
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,130
And you're not down yet?

1881
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,030
What the hell are you waiting for?

1882
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,430
I'm on it, Colonel.

1883
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:45,710
Turn off vocal effect.

1884
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,510
Welcome back.

1885
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,450
Thanks for 4 months.

1886
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:53,130
Thank you.

1887
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:55,670
Alright, now we go.

1888
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,890
I couldn't see the bottom of that hole.

1889
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,470
But I anchored the rope and I went down.

1890
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:01,830
Okay.

1891
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,170
Look for a rope.

1892
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,030
Yes, that's what I did.

1893
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:09,250
Yippee!

1894
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,030
Wait, there was a secret.

1895
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,350
Interesting.

1896
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,610
There is a secret.

1897
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:21,870
Huh?

1898
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:25,330
Are there secrets in the chapters?

1899
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,630
Something stinks really bad.

1900
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:33,790
I anchored the rope and went down into the pitch darkness.

1901
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,870
Finally I touched ground.

1902
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:40,650
I missed 5 experiences.

1903
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,910
because I got caught.

1904
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,650
when I was attacking the guys.

1905
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:44,210
But that's okay.

1906
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:59,230
Good thing my nose is clogged.

1907
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,270
You miss it?

1908
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,290
Check the depth of the water.

1909
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,110
I'm scared.

1910
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:12,350
Wait, hold on.

1911
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:14,750
I want to also see what happens if I call line 2 and 3.

1912
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,370
Shit, there's no signal down here.

1913
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,870
Wait, what about here?

1914
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:21,550
Jesse here.

1915
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,250
Over.

1916
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,630
Shit, there's no signal down here.

1917
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:24,770
Oh, wow!

1918
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,630
Bad time to test it, I guess.

1919
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,250
Synapse, thank you!

1920
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,370
I got an arm!

1921
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:36,690
There's no description!

1922
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,010
It just says severed arm!

1923
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,790
How do I check what the water...

1924
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,890
How do I check the depth of the water?

1925
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:47,490
Maybe with a coin?

1926
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,570
Oh, whoops, sorry.

1927
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,510
Oh, invisible wall!

1928
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:58,510
Oh, use the arm!

1929
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,230
I wanted to keep it!

1930
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:04,830
Fine.

1931
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,990
I dipped the severed arm in the water to calculate the depth.

1932
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:08,630
Gosh.

1933
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,090
As soon as I did, it started shaking.

1934
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:15,050
When I pulled it back out, there was nothing but bones.

1935
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:21,610
I couldn't explain what I saw, but my instincts told me this water might be dangerous.

1936
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:23,550
I'm not gonna lie.

1937
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,210
I had trouble getting where I needed to go.

1938
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:30,330
In fact, I had to build a floating platform to get through.

1939
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:35,390
Worse yet, everything down there was out for my blood.

1940
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,170
What?

1941
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,490
What else is down here?

1942
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,110
I'm scared.

1943
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,290
A popsicle!

1944
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,530
Plastic drum.

1945
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:44,770
Shut up.

1946
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:45,530
Wait a second.

1947
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,990
Thank you, thank you.

1948
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:53,150
I considered floating the drums on the water and walking across, but they weren't very stable.

1949
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:54,010
No, I can wear it!

1950
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,630
I can wear it!

1951
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,130
I can wear the drum!

1952
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:57,510
Dang it.

1953
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,550
Is your laundry done?

1954
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,190
I don't know.

1955
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:04,870
Oh my gosh!

1956
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:08,730
There's fish people here.

1957
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:11,950
Oh my god!

1958
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:14,530
Hold on, Mr. Fox.

1959
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,510
What exactly did you say attacked you?

1960
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,810
What you just heard.

1961
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,790
Some sort of hybrid between piranha and human.

1962
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,290
A human piranha attacked you?

1963
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,210
I see.

1964
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:28,350
And in your opinion, could you elaborate how this hybrid could exist?

1965
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:32,450
That question kept gnawing at the back of my brain the entire day.

1966
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:32,890
What?

1967
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:35,890
I dwelled on it over and over again.

1968
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:36,250
Huh?

1969
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:45,610
And after seeing everything I saw on that base, their facilities, their experiments, their labs, I reached the only logical explanation.

1970
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:46,650
What?

1971
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,330
What was that, Mr. Fox?

1972
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,990
Yeah, what was it?

1973
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:49,610
Mother.

1974
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:52,910
Scientist?

1975
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:54,850
Mother.

1976
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:08,550
That a woman hell-bent on becoming a mother was unable to afford standard artificial insemination.

1977
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:12,450
So she sought illicit services on the black market instead.

1978
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,170
And you know how the black market is.

1979
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,690
They scam you with any fake shit.

1980
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:18,470
Wait, what?

1981
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:22,370
She took up an offer from a back alley doctor who did the operation as requested.

1982
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:29,190
But she had yet to find out that she was actually fertilized with piranha sperm.

1983
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:30,370
Jesus.

1984
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:31,730
Poor woman.

1985
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:32,730
Months passed and she became the mother of a school of human-piranha hybrids.

1986
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,810
What this guy not- it's not the background guy just believing this.

1987
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,530
And she became the mother of a school of human-piranha hybrids.

1988
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:42,370
The horrified woman flushed them down the toilet.

1989
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:49,790
They ended up in the sewers where they would keep reproducing, creating a colony of human-piranha hybrids.

1990
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:52,430
The same ones that attacked me.

1991
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,770
Oh my god.

1992
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,470
That's- okay.

1993
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,650
Guy doesn't even say anything about that.

1994
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,550
He's just like, you know what?

1995
01:15:58,650 --> 01:15:59,910
That's okay.

1996
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:02,650
We're just okay.

1997
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,850
I'm afraid of when they pop up.

1998
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,310
How do I know when they're gonna pop up, you know?

1999
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,690
Good thing I invested in punch.

2000
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,410
Jesse needs his pills again.

2001
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,490
Oh, I have to roll.

2002
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,610
Never mind, I didn't have to roll at all.

2003
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,470
Why do I keep getting these plastic drums though?

2004
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,320
Hello?

2005
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,180
Hello?

2006
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:39,880
Lieutenant?

2007
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,260
Uh, where's the phone?

2008
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:42,780
Where's the phone?

2009
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:43,640
Hello?

2010
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,040
Where's the phone?

2011
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:47,700
Where's the phone?

2012
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:51,780
Oh!

2013
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,840
Oh, it's me.

2014
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,280
Sorry, guys.

2015
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,380
There was no signal down in the sewers.

2016
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:01,780
Sorry.

2017
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,080
Not much progress.

2018
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,460
I should still be near the prison.

2019
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,480
Are you kidding me, Fox?

2020
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,960
You're still too damn close.

2021
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,200
You need to travel farther before coming topside.

2022
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,740
I know, but there are sewer channels blocking my way.

2023
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,160
Then build something to cross them.

2024
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,420
Find some materials.

2025
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,700
Okay, we got the materials.

2026
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:23,960
Exactly.

2027
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,140
I think I'm in the office of some sort of officer.

2028
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,540
You should search for classified files about Operation Jericho.

2029
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:31,760
Operation Jericho?

2030
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,920
They're up to something.

2031
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:34,980
I don't know what.

2032
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,960
We must find out.

2033
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,380
Hi.

2034
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:38,680
Okay.

2035
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,080
Yes.

2036
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,040
Classified documents.

2037
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,260
I have them.

2038
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,660
I have them.

2039
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,420
Right here.

2040
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,740
This button.

2041
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,220
Whatever that is.

2042
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,060
Oh, here, here, here, here.

2043
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,340
That's classified.

2044
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,360
Classi...

2045
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:54,540
Oh!

2046
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:54,760
Oh!

2047
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:55,580
Files.

2048
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:56,680
I got the files.

2049
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,460
Classified documentation about Operation Jericho.

2050
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:00,520
Oh!

2051
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:01,740
Oh!

2052
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,920
The first file was about an attack plan.

2053
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,600
Its code name was Operation Jericho.

2054
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,340
I couldn't find many details because it was encoded.

2055
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,620
But anyone could understand a chart about casualties.

2056
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,080
Its lines went all the way to the top.

2057
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:17,720
Oh, my God.

2058
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:19,000
The top.

2059
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:19,680
Oh, yeah.

2060
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,960
Let's also now call these.

2061
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:21,580
Jessie here.

2062
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,220
Over.

2063
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:22,700
Over.

2064
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:23,840
Oh.

2065
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,640
Okay.

2066
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,380
Jessie here.

2067
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,060
Over.

2068
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:27,560
Over.

2069
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,320
No one.

2070
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:29,780
No one responded.

2071
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,880
Colonel, do you copy?

2072
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:31,820
Copy.

2073
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,520
I found some documents.

2074
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:33,940
Yeah.

2075
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,500
Operation Jericho.

2076
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,560
Looks like it talks about an attack plan.

2077
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,840
Combine it with the lighter?

2078
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,980
I have no idea.

2079
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,340
It's encoded.

2080
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,720
I'll keep searching for more documents, Colonel.

2081
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:52,800
Operation Jericho is a rumor only known by a few officers and, of course, the enemy.

2082
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,360
The enemy.

2083
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,020
How did you find out about it, Mr. Fox?

2084
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,680
Through the documents, you dummy.

2085
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,540
As I told you, Colonel Harris, I'm the only one who knows.

2086
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,340
Colonel Harris asked me to search for files about it.

2087
01:18:59,360 --> 01:18:59,520
Yes.

2088
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,220
The deceased Colonel Harris?

2089
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:01,640
Yes.

2090
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,320
Yes!

2091
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:08,140
I have the feeling that this officer didn't believe anything I was saying.

2092
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,060
We have a girlfriend?

2093
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,600
It's understandable.

2094
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,200
I don't believe you either.

2095
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,440
Oh, really?

2096
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,120
Wait, what?

2097
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:17,580
Well, Miss Incredulous, why ask me to tell you the story?

2098
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,000
Well, I like the way you tell it.

2099
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,940
And since there are no theaters here.

2100
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:22,780
Great.

2101
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:23,580
What?

2102
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,740
So, what was Operation Jericho?

2103
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,520
We're telling a story within a story within a story.

2104
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:35,000
The location is actually a clandestine base with a company codenamed X Army, commanded by someone named General X.

2105
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,020
General X.

2106
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,580
They were planning a large-scale attack against Allied posts.

2107
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:40,320
X is going to give it to you.

2108
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,280
And that plan was?

2109
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:42,500
Be patient.

2110
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,740
That comes later.

2111
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:44,360
Hey!

2112
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,100
Don't be like that.

2113
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,240
Come on, tell me.

2114
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,420
The officer that was taking my statement...

2115
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,200
What?

2116
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,700
...was also curious about what I knew.

2117
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,420
What is happening?

2118
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,420
And what exactly do you know about Operation Jericho, Mr. Fox?

2119
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:57,500
I don't know.

2120
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,100
That it was a hell of an operation.

2121
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,880
Harris and I knew the details thanks to the files we found.

2122
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:04,740
Correction.

2123
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,760
I found.

2124
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,660
Again, how much did you exactly find out?

2125
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,740
Let me continue.

2126
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,980
You'll find out later.

2127
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,080
Yeah, we're telling a story.

2128
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,420
You can't get all the information up front, mister.

2129
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,200
Come on.

2130
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:17,640
Gosh.

2131
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,600
Let me do a little world building and such.

2132
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,260
Right?

2133
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:21,980
Come on.

2134
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,860
This person's going to come in and be like, who ransacked my room?

2135
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:27,500
I don't know.

2136
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:27,940
Oh.

2137
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:31,180
If I go back down here...

2138
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,320
Hold on.

2139
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,000
Let's go back up because it says I can leave.

2140
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:35,960
Let's see if I leave.

2141
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,460
Oh, I need a...

2142
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,460
Card key one.

2143
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,160
Okay.

2144
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,140
All right.

2145
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,900
Time to combine our three drums.

2146
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,940
How many layers of framing device are we on?

2147
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,520
I don't know.

2148
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:53,740
Combine.

2149
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:56,760
Oh, wait.

2150
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,980
With the toilet paper.

2151
01:20:59,140 --> 01:20:59,620
Okay.

2152
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:02,380
Dang it.

2153
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,280
Can I combine the...

2154
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,800
It won't let you combine the lighter with the...

2155
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,060
That's so messed up.

2156
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:13,940
Dang it.

2157
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:14,400
Okay.

2158
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,560
Said I would try to find more, but like...

2159
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,100
Yeah, we need to go down that way.

2160
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:27,780
Hmm.

2161
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:28,880
Okay.

2162
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,730
Okay.

2163
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:38,310
Is there anything in here that I can use to open anything in here?

2164
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,110
The lighter.

2165
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:41,850
Okay.

2166
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:42,830
I'm going to use it on this.

2167
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:43,330
Nope.

2168
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,350
I'm going to use it on this.

2169
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,350
I'm going to use it on this.

2170
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,850
What is that red button-looking thing?

2171
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:48,710
I want to press it.

2172
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,450
You missed a path up above in the sewers?

2173
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:53,750
I did?

2174
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:58,940
Did I?

2175
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,820
Oh, it's a stamp.

2176
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,460
Oh, it looks like a red button.

2177
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,060
Uh-oh.

2178
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:08,620
Okay.

2179
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:09,100
Okay.

2180
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,160
No, I don't think I missed anything, because...

2181
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:13,780
Oh!

2182
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:14,720
This way.

2183
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:15,420
Okay.

2184
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:15,920
Just kidding.

2185
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:16,500
You're right.

2186
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,500
Oh!

2187
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,980
In the inventory, press any key over an item to bind a shortcut.

2188
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:23,740
Huh?

2189
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,080
Press it later in the game to select the item directly.

2190
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,200
What?

2191
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,600
Press a key?

2192
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,960
What's any key?

2193
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:37,340
What?

2194
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,160
Hmm?

2195
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,040
We got another barrel.

2196
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:48,860
Nice.

2197
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:49,960
Okay.

2198
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:51,980
Oh!

2199
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,040
I'm eavesdropping.

2200
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:54,700
Roscoe!

2201
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:55,820
Roscoe!

2202
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:56,980
Escaped?

2203
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:57,280
How?

2204
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,340
Through the sewers?

2205
01:22:59,480 --> 01:22:59,940
Shit!

2206
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,080
No.

2207
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,260
Don't send anyone.

2208
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,560
If he hides like a rat, he'll die like a rat.

2209
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,780
Switch on the shredder.

2210
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:09,600
The shredder?

2211
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:09,740
Yeah.

2212
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,440
Wait.

2213
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,260
Why are there shredders in the...

2214
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,980
Why are there shredders in the...

2215
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:15,960
In the sewers?

2216
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,560
I did see that on the right side.

2217
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:21,740
General Roscoe.

2218
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,660
I want to see if he does anything else.

2219
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,240
I wonder...

2220
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:25,300
Oh.

2221
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,160
Maybe I can...

2222
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,040
Hey.

2223
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,520
You hear this?

2224
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:35,220
Oh.

2225
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,000
I actually...

2226
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,300
Oh, okay.

2227
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,020
I was going to say.

2228
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:42,620
I don't think it...

2229
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,580
There's a dev in the...

2230
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:43,780
Oh!

2231
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:43,900
Oh!

2232
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,080
Shredders.

2233
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:45,360
Oh.

2234
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,360
That asshole Roscoe.

2235
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:47,860
Dev in the chat.

2236
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,160
Hello.

2237
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,360
Thank you.

2238
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,800
Later he'll be a pain in my ass.

2239
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,280
But they'd end up saving it too.

2240
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,080
Why?

2241
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,940
So we can hide in here from the shredders.

2242
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,060
I'm assuming.

2243
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,220
But I can also just kind of go through here.

2244
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,460
Look at that.

2245
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,520
I can just kind of...

2246
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,640
What if I throw a coin?

2247
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:13,260
What if I throw a coin, you guys?

2248
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,780
Oh no.

2249
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,360
My coin.

2250
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,380
I wasted my coin.

2251
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:23,480
Oh my coin.

2252
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,320
Wait.

2253
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:25,140
You guys.

2254
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,740
I wasted my coin.

2255
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,920
I missed your pick up.

2256
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,920
Pick up the coin.

2257
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,340
No.

2258
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,800
I'm right here.

2259
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:46,220
Oh.

2260
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,940
Look what the cat dragged in.

2261
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,500
He escaped prison.

2262
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:50,860
It's me.

2263
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,320
Got some big balls coming here, rodent.

2264
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:54,880
Rodent.

2265
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,500
The situation was foobar.

2266
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:59,620
He was armed and hunkered down behind his desk.

2267
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,820
I was screwed.

2268
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:01,540
I have.

2269
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,740
So what did you do?

2270
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:07,480
In five nanoseconds, I scrutinized the room and noticed a very subtle detail.

2271
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,040
What's that?

2272
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,780
There is a large globe in the middle of the room.

2273
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:11,240
There is?

2274
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,760
Oh yes, there is.

2275
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,220
I already had what I needed to take him down.

2276
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:15,560
Oh.

2277
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:16,360
Oh.

2278
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:16,680
Oh.

2279
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,420
What do you mean?

2280
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:18,900
I hate to be a wanted trigger.

2281
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:18,920
Huh.

2282
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,420
Oh my God.

2283
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,240
I do?

2284
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:23,460
Ralsei.

2285
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:25,960
No!

2286
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,180
Ow.

2287
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:27,340
Oh my God.

2288
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:28,920
No!

2289
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,640
Ouch.

2290
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,020
Ouch.

2291
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,500
Ouch.

2292
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:32,820
Ouch.

2293
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,640
Um.

2294
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,680
Dang it.

2295
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:45,880
Um.

2296
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,680
Good job.

2297
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,120
Good try, everybody.

2298
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,760
Why don't I just shoot him?

2299
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:59,920
Why can't I just shoot the guy with my slingshot?

2300
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,940
Maybe I should...

2301
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,640
I'm not bleeding, that's the issue.

2302
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,380
I don't want to use it, but it recovers health.

2303
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,380
Is this worldwide Minto?

2304
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,100
Oh, because the desk is the barrier.

2305
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,440
Gotcha, gotcha.

2306
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:24,620
Let's see.

2307
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,940
Joined a stream to a death.

2308
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:30,900
Yeah, you know, I'm always delivering the best kind of content, right?

2309
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,160
You have infinite use of bandage for bleeding.

2310
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,440
Yeah, but it doesn't heal you.

2311
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:47,900
You know what?

2312
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,660
I'm just going to use it.

2313
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,880
It says it heals me over time.

2314
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,220
That's so nice.

2315
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,980
Okay, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.

2316
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,640
Long the chili?

2317
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,380
Oh, chibi!

2318
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,440
Chili model!

2319
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,280
Okay, let's try this again, you guys.

2320
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,940
At least I get to keep my koi this time.

2321
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,640
Well, I guess I can skip this part.

2322
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,080
Okay!

2323
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,080
Nice!

2324
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,200
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

2325
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:49,240
Oh gosh!

2326
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,180
Wait, how do I heal?

2327
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,520
Oh gosh!

2328
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:52,020
Wait!

2329
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,660
Oh gosh, I'm going to die.

2330
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,590
You're pissing me off!

2331
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:11,890
Damn you!

2332
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:34,030
And someone walks into the room and just sees two guys down on the floor.

2333
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,070
Okay, third time's the charm, everybody.

2334
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:41,930
Third time's the charm.

2335
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,860
In fact, if I get hit, I probably should just use this, huh?

2336
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,240
They give you a free one anyway, so...

2337
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:53,900
Okay.

2338
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,380
Use the god mode.

2339
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,400
Oh, wait.

2340
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,500
It says I sacrifice a ring.

2341
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,800
I don't have a ring.

2342
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,120
Also, I can do this.

2343
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,040
I don't need a god mode for this.

2344
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:12,680
Huh.

2345
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,060
Did I just hear a rat?

2346
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:15,840
A rat.

2347
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,660
That was close.

2348
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:24,940
Oh, shoot.

2349
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:36,420
Oh, this is a really bad angle to be at.

2350
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,940
I can't get it.

2351
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,780
Wait, I can't get him.

2352
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,420
From this angle.

2353
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:48,540
Okay, there we go.

2354
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,060
Okay.

2355
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,460
There we go.

2356
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,020
Yeah, you're pissing me off!

2357
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,520
Nice shot.

2358
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,320
Okay.

2359
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:10,800
Yippee!

2360
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:21,760
Sucker!

2361
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,920
What's the game called?

2362
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:23,640
Oh my gosh.

2363
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:24,720
The one with the cars.

2364
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:27,960
What's it called?

2365
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,300
We got...

2366
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,100
Oh, the card key!

2367
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:31,680
Nice.

2368
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,120
And we didn't even need to use that.

2369
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:37,700
Rocket League!

2370
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,680
Guys, I have such sick brain.

2371
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,720
This is fun.

2372
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,000
Worldwide Minto!

2373
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,820
Now we can leave.

2374
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,940
Wait, how does he get out of this room?

2375
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,580
Oh, I just noticed that one too.

2376
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:06,700
Good thing we didn't leave.

2377
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,220
How does he get out of here?

2378
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,860
He must have a secret door.

2379
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,680
Through the sewers.

2380
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:13,500
Duh.

2381
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,380
The wood!

2382
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,700
Why are you sending 50 Gufted?

2383
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,380
What the heck?

2384
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:25,900
Thank you!

2385
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:27,740
Why?

2386
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,100
Thank

2387
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,370
you, but why?

2388
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,580
Why not?

2389
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,420
I don't know.

2390
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:54,820
As I proceeded down the sewer sidewalk, I noticed a path nearby I couldn't reach.

2391
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:55,920
Why not?

2392
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,040
It was across the sewer water.

2393
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:58,660
Just jump.

2394
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:00,320
What was the distance to the other side?

2395
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:02,920
The wood!

2396
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,700
Thank you for another Friptor!

2397
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,780
Oh my gosh.

2398
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:11,820
One yard or ten yards?

2399
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,620
Thank you!

2400
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,080
Spawn of the...

2401
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,380
Thanks for four months as well.

2402
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:21,980
Thank you!

2403
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,960
Should we do one yard or ten yards?

2404
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,020
You want to see the ten yards?

2405
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,340
Okay.

2406
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,400
Around ten yards.

2407
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:35,640
Hold on.

2408
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,900
Weren't those channels narrow?

2409
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,040
You're contradicting yourself, Mr. Fox.

2410
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:39,200
I'm sorry.

2411
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:39,500
Oh.

2412
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,500
That's because the sewer fumes were psychotropic and messing with my senses.

2413
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:43,900
What?

2414
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:44,680
I see.

2415
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,260
I realized I needed something to cross to the other side.

2416
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:49,660
Does that mean there were no fish people?

2417
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,360
There were no fish people then?

2418
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,340
Because it was psychotropic?

2419
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,660
Can I use this?

2420
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,160
Select.

2421
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,280
Use.

2422
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:03,300
I considered floating the drums on the water and walking across, but they weren't very stable.

2423
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:03,880
Ah.

2424
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:07,760
Okay.

2425
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,180
But we have our key card now.

2426
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,280
So we can go in here.

2427
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,560
And we can go downstairs.

2428
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,080
Nice.

2429
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,980
Oh my gosh.

2430
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,000
It's been 50 years.

2431
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,670
We emptied the potty.

2432
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:30,050
We finally did it.

2433
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,370
Real soldiers never look at their reflection.

2434
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,240
Let's see.

2435
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:45,600
What's over here?

2436
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:45,760
Oh.

2437
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,100
Oh.

2438
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,520
Heading east, I ran into a hound.

2439
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:51,760
No.

2440
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:52,480
A puppy.

2441
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,120
You didn't hurt it, did you?

2442
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,000
A puppy?

2443
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,000
That monster was the size of a horse.

2444
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,160
Why are we suddenly a...

2445
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:01,040
Even so, I wanted to see if it was friendly.

2446
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:02,300
Puppy.

2447
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,280
Puppy.

2448
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,300
Are you a good boy?

2449
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,320
Boy?

2450
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:12,520
But that hound was trained to kill.

2451
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,440
He's got red eyes.

2452
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,760
Its bloody eyes looked at me like I was a little boy.

2453
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:17,920
Puppy.

2454
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,360
Puppy.

2455
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:21,740
Okay.

2456
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,240
I don't think we can attack the dog.

2457
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,780
Our girlfriend will break up with us.

2458
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,080
And that would be really unfortunate.

2459
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:27,780
Oh.

2460
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,600
Oh my gosh.

2461
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:28,860
Who's there?

2462
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:29,780
Not me.

2463
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:30,220
Ah!

2464
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,120
Oh my gosh.

2465
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,460
Damn, cat.

2466
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,060
What if I...

2467
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:37,940
Who's there?

2468
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,000
There's a cat.

2469
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,040
T-Rex?

2470
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,100
Mike.

2471
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,200
They might believe me if I say I'm Mike.

2472
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:45,760
I'm Mike.

2473
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,860
Everybody's Mike.

2474
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,940
What if I say cat?

2475
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:50,580
It might go...

2476
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:50,920
Meow.

2477
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:51,680
Meow.

2478
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,420
Meow.

2479
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,160
What if I say T-Rex?

2480
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,100
I think I'll scare him.

2481
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,100
T-Rex.

2482
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,680
That is pretty good.

2483
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:06,700
Damn T-Rexes.

2484
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:09,940
Hold on.

2485
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:10,960
Weren't they extinct?

2486
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,040
Ah!

2487
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:12,880
Ah!

2488
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:13,460
Ah!

2489
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,220
Ah!

2490
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:15,760
Ah!

2491
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:17,720
Oh no.

2492
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,220
Shoot it.

2493
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:18,840
Oh shoot.

2494
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,580
Guys, I think I'm gonna die here.

2495
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:23,960
I think I'm gonna die here.

2496
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,320
I think I'm gonna die here.

2497
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,820
Now what if I do the cat?

2498
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:39,700
I think I might...

2499
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:40,800
Who's there?

2500
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,580
I thought he would get scared of the T-Rex.

2501
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:45,880
He'd be like whoa scary.

2502
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,060
Scary!

2503
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:52,960
Cat...

2504
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,440
Don't send backup!

2505
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:04,760
Gosh,

2506
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,080
I do have to be Mike, don't I?

2507
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,660
Okay, let's just...

2508
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:11,900
Let's just be Mike.

2509
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,240
Why didn't you meow?

2510
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,640
Why didn't you meow?

2511
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:17,880
You dummy!

2512
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:18,740
Gosh!

2513
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,920
What's this guy's name?

2514
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:21,500
Fox.

2515
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,300
What are you doing?

2516
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,140
I'm Mike.

2517
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:25,960
I'm Mike.

2518
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,300
I'm Mike.

2519
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,400
I'm just a Mike.

2520
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,020
I'm Mike!

2521
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:31,480
I'm Mike!

2522
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:31,900
I'm Mike!

2523
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:35,720
Phew.

2524
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:43,260
Nice.

2525
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,640
Just a Mike, you guys.

2526
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,020
Just a...

2527
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:47,520
Just a Mike.

2528
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:50,260
Just a Mike.

2529
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,200
Just a Mike, everybody.

2530
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:54,780
Oh.

2531
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,560
Good night.

2532
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,120
I got another handkerchief.

2533
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,460
We get a lot of those, don't we?

2534
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,560
Get a lot of handkerchiefs.

2535
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:05,400
Hmm.

2536
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,460
What kind of...

2537
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,060
How do you find secrets, I wonder?

2538
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,460
Like, what do you have to look for?

2539
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,620
Like, are there secrets in the walls?

2540
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:13,720
Are the walls...

2541
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,560
Do the walls have secrets?

2542
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:17,980
Is he convulsing?

2543
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,340
No!

2544
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,220
I was just stepping on him, you know?

2545
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,260
What if I, like, roll into this, you know?

2546
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,160
No?

2547
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:25,040
Hmm.

2548
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:32,860
Heading south, I ran into a couple of trucks.

2549
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,420
That was my big chance to escape.

2550
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,020
Oh, yeah.

2551
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,000
We can just hide in the back.

2552
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,940
First, I had to get rid of the guards.

2553
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:39,960
I did?

2554
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,080
Why can't I just hide in the back of it?

2555
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,000
Just hide in the back of the truck.

2556
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,440
Let's get...

2557
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,020
Oh, shoot.

2558
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,160
You didn't see...

2559
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:51,540
Okay.

2560
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,420
This game feels like if you get an alert...

2561
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,360
Feels a little less like...

2562
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,060
Able to get out of the alerts...

2563
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:00,080
Phase.

2564
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:01,200
I might just be wrong.

2565
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,520
I might be wrong about that, you know?

2566
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:03,520
Obviously, but...

2567
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:10,730
The barrel's cracked?

2568
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,570
Which one?

2569
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:13,410
Oh, I see it.

2570
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:14,430
This one.

2571
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:16,870
Nope.

2572
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:18,650
It's just a...

2573
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:20,050
Just a...

2574
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,990
Design.

2575
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:22,910
Maybe it's oil, you know?

2576
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,490
Why are you guys ganged up?

2577
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:27,530
Oh, my gosh.

2578
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:45,080
Pick him up and take him...

2579
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,340
Here.

2580
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:48,240
Yeah.

2581
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:49,720
Yeah.

2582
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:50,380
Yeah.

2583
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:50,860
Okay.

2584
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:53,940
Oh, wait.

2585
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,860
How do I get this guy?

2586
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:56,520
I'm gonna be in the light.

2587
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:57,760
Hmm.

2588
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,920
Never mind.

2589
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:09,480
Haha.

2590
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:10,940
I'm too good.

2591
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,960
I'm too good at this game.

2592
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,060
Oh!

2593
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,480
We got a ring!

2594
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,560
Remember I said sacrifice a ring?

2595
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,620
To get the...

2596
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,640
Invincibility?

2597
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:24,520
All right.

2598
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:27,900
I'm...

2599
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,380
I'm examining the engines.

2600
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:32,660
I'm examining...

2601
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,180
Oh, there we go.

2602
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,520
I took a glance and my worst fears came true.

2603
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:42,080
It was an old diesel engine with no AdBlue or particulate filter.

2604
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:43,400
What does that mean?

2605
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:48,820
Running away in that truck would have polluted the area with nitrogen oxides and micro...

2606
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:49,980
Micro particles.

2607
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:53,840
And I wasn't willing to sacrifice the environment for a hasty retreat.

2608
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:54,700
Oh, my gosh.

2609
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,020
He's so considerate.

2610
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,480
So I armed myself with patience and I kept searching for another way to escape.

2611
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,720
Wow, Jesse.

2612
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,600
I didn't know you were so eco-friendly.

2613
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:03,480
Jesse Fox.

2614
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,120
Well, it's nothing really.

2615
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,300
Wow.

2616
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:09,080
You know...

2617
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,040
With the name Fox, he just cares about the environment so much.

2618
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,700
Captain Planet over here.

2619
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:18,620
See, this looks like suspicious.

2620
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,160
Like a wall that I could be able to break.

2621
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:22,880
Or here.

2622
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,700
Or nowhere.

2623
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:30,650
Oh.

2624
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:32,930
That was loud.

2625
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:34,650
Let's see.

2626
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:35,950
We're gonna go inside.

2627
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:39,990
Dev says punch the side of the truck horn.

2628
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:40,530
Really?

2629
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:42,410
Where's the dev?

2630
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:43,670
Sorry, I haven't seen you.

2631
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,610
Thank you, though.

2632
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,090
Die, truck.

2633
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:46,790
Yeah!

2634
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,470
Die, truck.

2635
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:53,010
Yeah, die, truck.

2636
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,620
Punch the tank.

2637
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:05,200
Oh, gosh.

2638
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:06,200
This guy's right here.

2639
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,140
Is he gonna come back?

2640
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:19,220
Die, truck.

2641
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:23,650
Oh!

2642
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:24,270
Oh, shoot.

2643
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:25,210
Nope.

2644
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:26,230
We're fine.

2645
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:27,470
Oh, nothing.

2646
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:32,380
Mike!

2647
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,800
All good.

2648
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,080
Oh!

2649
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,080
We leveled up!

2650
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:41,240
Yippee!

2651
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:43,300
Rapid recovery.

2652
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,380
Your HP is recovered twice as fast.

2653
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,440
Apply bandages and first aid kits twice as fast!

2654
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,220
Oh, wait.

2655
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,720
What do you mean your HP is recovered?

2656
01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:58,330
I feel like the kits is really good, though.

2657
01:41:59,370 --> 01:41:59,810
Probably.

2658
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,120
You get health back faster.

2659
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:07,720
Oh!

2660
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,220
Oh!

2661
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:08,600
Yes!

2662
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:08,860
Yes!

2663
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:08,980
Yes!

2664
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:09,220
Okay.

2665
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:09,560
Okay.

2666
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:09,760
Okay.

2667
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,680
I think healing would be better.

2668
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:17,740
I think having...

2669
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:19,360
Because it's kind of, you know...

2670
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:23,280
Having to stop for so long to put on the bandage.

2671
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,740
And it's bandage and first aid kit.

2672
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,600
So I'm gonna go with this one.

2673
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:28,300
Nice.

2674
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,000
You guys good?

2675
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:31,540
You guys...

2676
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,240
Oh, sorry.

2677
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,540
You have nothing else to give me?

2678
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:34,460
Nothing?

2679
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,840
I'm trying to pick you up.

2680
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,220
Oh!

2681
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,880
You did have more.

2682
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,860
You were holding out on me.

2683
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:44,560
Okay.

2684
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,540
I'm trying to pick him up.

2685
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,900
I'm so bad at picking these guys up.

2686
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,540
Okay, whatever.

2687
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,440
They're fine down there.

2688
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,420
They're fine.

2689
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:58,440
They're cozy.

2690
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:03,460
The dev is Jack Lefevre.

2691
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,680
Oh, thank you!

2692
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:10,500
I'm hot and you're hot!

2693
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:11,740
You're hot and you're hot!

2694
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,120
Yes!

2695
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:13,760
Oh!

2696
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:13,860
I'm hot and you're hot!

2697
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:13,920
You're hot and you're hot!

2698
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,080
Cool.

2699
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,200
Cool.

2700
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:17,600
Thank you guys.

2701
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,420
You guys made my day.

2702
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:20,540
Bye -bye.

2703
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:21,260
Bye-bye.

2704
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,180
Bye-bye.

2705
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,520
I'm ready to go home.

2706
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:33,160
Bye-bye.

2707
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,580
Bye-bye.

2708
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:35,600
Bye-bye.

2709
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,120
Bye-bye.

2710
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:41,180
Nothing is safe, I'm just saying.

2711
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,220
Is Otacon in here?

2712
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:47,900
Nope.

2713
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,260
No nerds in the closet.

2714
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,320
And no sexy ladies either.

2715
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:55,660
That doesn't sound very eco-friendly.

2716
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,780
I'm going against everything that Jesse Fox stands for.

2717
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,620
Sorry, Jesse Fox.

2718
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,600
I love arson.

2719
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,640
What is that thing?

2720
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:11,540
Let's see.

2721
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,200
So, let's see...

2722
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:17,220
Flammable.

2723
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,340
Keep away from heat.

2724
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,120
And then some raw...

2725
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,300
Oh, the dog!

2726
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,900
The dog looked at me like I was raw meat.

2727
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,820
What if I just give him some raw meat, baby?

2728
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,780
It wasn't over here, was he?

2729
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,360
No.

2730
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:34,540
Is there a map?

2731
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:35,740
I haven't tried.

2732
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,320
Let me try M.

2733
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:37,040
No.

2734
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,680
Let's give the dog the meat.

2735
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:45,000
Jesse...

2736
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,840
Mr. Fox, I'm still waiting on an explanation for the noose.

2737
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,340
Later, officer.

2738
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:53,460
Oh my gosh, there's more important pressing matters here, officer, please.

2739
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:57,840
But before we do that...

2740
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:00,340
I think it saved, but...

2741
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:00,760
Just in case.

2742
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,220
There we go.

2743
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:08,670
What happens if you combine the gasoline and the lighter?

2744
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:10,790
I mean...

2745
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:12,070
I just saved.

2746
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:12,450
What a...

2747
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:12,590
Oops.

2748
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:16,210
What better time than to combine the two...

2749
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:21,470
Yes.

2750
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,040
Cool.

2751
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:42,640
Good thing you saved.

2752
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,400
Who would have guessed that that would have happened?

2753
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:47,900
That's craziness.

2754
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:51,700
Here, doggie, doggie.

2755
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:53,920
Heading east, I ran into a hound.

2756
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:54,580
A hound?

2757
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:54,820
A puppy.

2758
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,320
Oh, wait, we saw this part.

2759
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,280
Hold on, I'm just gonna skip it.

2760
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,300
Eat the meat.

2761
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:00,560
Eat the meat.

2762
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:01,680
Eat the meat.

2763
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:02,160
Eat the meat.

2764
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,460
Eat the meat.

2765
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,660
Eat the meat.

2766
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:07,340
Eat the meat.

2767
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:07,900
It needs unlimited raw meat.

2768
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:08,480
Okay, it needs meat.

2769
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:08,660
Okay, quick, okay.

2770
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:13,100
Eat the meat.

2771
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:16,900
Eat the meat!

2772
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,460
Eat the meat!

2773
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:22,230
Eat the meat, eat the meat, eat the...

2774
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:26,430
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my...

2775
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,590
I'm punching the tank.

2776
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:30,790
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

2777
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:33,350
These chewing sounds.

2778
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,990
Okay, we're good.

2779
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:36,410
What's that...

2780
01:46:36,410 --> 01:46:37,890
What's that blue thing in that?

2781
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:38,210
Oh.

2782
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:39,010
Watch out.

2783
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:40,810
There's a guard looking here.

2784
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:42,750
If you move, he'll see you.

2785
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:44,690
Tell me when he's not looking.

2786
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:46,770
That bastard won't move.

2787
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:48,770
He's over here all the time.

2788
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:49,930
Fuck.

2789
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:51,130
Hold on.

2790
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,310
I have an idea.

2791
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:53,050
What's the idea?

2792
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:54,370
Yo, Mike!

2793
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:55,630
Mike!

2794
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,170
Mike!

2795
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:56,730
Mike!

2796
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:57,770
Shut up.

2797
01:46:58,190 --> 01:47:00,850
I got pictures of your mom moving the bathtub.

2798
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:02,210
Want to buy them?

2799
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:03,290
Real cheap.

2800
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:03,730
What?

2801
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:05,250
You bastard!

2802
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:07,490
I'm done with his shit.

2803
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:08,970
Just go shoot that bastard.

2804
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:09,510
No!

2805
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:10,330
We have to save him!

2806
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:11,010
We have to save him!

2807
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:11,690
We have to save him!

2808
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,790
No, no, no!

2809
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:17,720
Nice.

2810
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,620
Thanks for the help.

2811
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,080
Thank you for knocking out that dick.

2812
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,840
By the way, name's Jesse Fox.

2813
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,580
Jesse Fox.

2814
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,100
I'm Mike.

2815
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:26,240
Hold on.

2816
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,160
Don't tell me the prisoner was also named Mike.

2817
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:30,020
No.

2818
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:30,620
Hold on.

2819
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:31,660
It wasn't Mike.

2820
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,160
I'm Robert.

2821
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:34,100
Oh, Robert.

2822
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,460
Let's see if I can get you out of here.

2823
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,540
Everybody is Mike.

2824
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:38,540
Thanks Fox, but no.

2825
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,880
If you escape, they'll shoot you.

2826
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:43,280
I'd rather be jailed than buried.

2827
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,200
Oh my gosh.

2828
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,120
You don't have a radio, do you?

2829
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:45,640
I do.

2830
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:46,060
Hold on.

2831
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,420
I'll get one for you.

2832
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,180
Oh, now we have a friend!

2833
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,000
You don't have one?

2834
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:53,280
Okay.

2835
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,400
We gotta get a radio for our new Robert friend.

2836
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,080
Oh shoot!

2837
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:58,960
Oh my god.

2838
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,140
That scared the heck out of me.

2839
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,440
Oh!

2840
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,040
Oh gosh!

2841
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:02,500
Ah!

2842
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,000
I'm such an idiot!

2843
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:11,540
Oh no!

2844
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,320
That's not what I meant to do!

2845
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,080
Oh, there we go.

2846
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,920
I'm bleeding out, you know?

2847
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,620
Um, anyways.

2848
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:17,920
You got anything else?

2849
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,660
I did a whoopsy!

2850
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,660
You guys, I did a bit of a whoopsy.

2851
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,920
Oh, uh, here's your radio.

2852
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,080
Oh, do I have to encrypt it?

2853
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:31,560
Yeah.

2854
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:34,140
We gotta go get more computer parts.

2855
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,100
Hold on.

2856
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:35,860
One second, Robert.

2857
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,160
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

2858
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:45,600
Mm-hmm.

2859
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:47,220
Nice suit.

2860
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,960
We need stronger arms.

2861
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,800
We need to become big buff.

2862
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:56,580
Nice suit!

2863
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:56,900
Oh.

2864
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,520
Okay.

2865
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:57,980
Oh.

2866
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:58,680
Okay.

2867
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:58,780
Okay.

2868
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,320
Wow.

2869
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:01,920
Get...

2870
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,120
Oh.

2871
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:03,420
Okay.

2872
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,860
We can only hold six at a time.

2873
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:07,880
So let's use that up real quickly.

2874
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:12,500
Big, meaty claws.

2875
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,660
Oh, a wooden platform.

2876
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:15,540
Okay.

2877
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:16,520
Tomorrow's tweet.

2878
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,080
Good morning, Michael.

2879
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,360
Yeah.

2880
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:22,340
Everybody's Mikey now.

2881
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:30,420
Oh.

2882
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,820
There's a little bit of blood here.

2883
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:33,720
It's my fault, honestly.

2884
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,280
Okay.

2885
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:39,120
Oops.

2886
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,360
Hey, Robert.

2887
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:40,960
Robert.

2888
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:41,940
Did you get that radio?

2889
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:42,500
Yeah.

2890
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:42,920
Yeah.

2891
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:43,940
Here you go.

2892
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:44,460
Here you go.

2893
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:45,980
Thanks, Fox.

2894
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,180
I'll call you if I find out anything.

2895
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:53,000
I'll be 78 years old, walking in my chair, and I don't know where I'll remember when mint football knocked me out.

2896
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:53,860
Don't remember.

2897
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:56,660
Yippee!

2898
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,940
Now, what?

2899
01:49:59,060 --> 01:49:59,380
What?

2900
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,400
Oh, I haven't called the guy in a while.

2901
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,460
Do you read me?

2902
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:03,920
Loud and clear, Fox.

2903
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,940
I have a wooden platform.

2904
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:06,780
I have a platform?

2905
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,960
So what are you waiting for?

2906
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:10,440
Get back to the sewers and keep running.

2907
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:10,780
Oh.

2908
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,840
I'm not so sure it'll hold my weight.

2909
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:14,880
Be creative, son.

2910
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,200
Look for floats of some kind.

2911
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,300
Stop punching me.

2912
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:19,000
Mike.

2913
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:22,820
Jesse here.

2914
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:23,820
Do you copy?

2915
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:24,980
I hear you.

2916
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:25,320
Oh.

2917
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,060
Hey, Robert.

2918
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:28,260
You don't look like a military man.

2919
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:28,820
Robert.

2920
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:29,660
Of course not.

2921
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:30,760
I'm a photographer.

2922
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,600
Oh, my gosh.

2923
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,680
He's looking for the pretzel.

2924
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,300
You're not a paparazzi, are you?

2925
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:37,340
That's right.

2926
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,800
A paparazzi.

2927
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,020
Paparazzi.

2928
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:40,820
You're the worst kind, too.

2929
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,060
Who was your favorite lady to stalk?

2930
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:45,520
Her name was Big Bertha.

2931
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:46,700
Big Bertha.

2932
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:46,940
Oh, Big.

2933
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:48,400
That your thing?

2934
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:50,620
It was the name of a German howitzer.

2935
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,600
I'm actually a war journalist.

2936
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:54,640
You thought you said you were a paparazzi.

2937
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:56,340
Yep.

2938
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,680
I said I was the worst fucking kind, too.

2939
01:50:59,220 --> 01:50:59,700
Big.

2940
01:50:59,700 --> 01:50:59,960
Hey, Robert.

2941
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,720
You must have fucked up royally to end up locked in here.

2942
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,320
Big Bertha.

2943
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,140
I've seen things I wasn't meant to fuck.

2944
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:07,060
I don't think they're supposed to lock up the journalists.

2945
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,640
Jesse here.

2946
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:12,300
Over.

2947
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,200
Anybody going to answer my call?

2948
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:14,900
Okay.

2949
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,140
No one's going to pick up for Jesse?

2950
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,840
Oh, I thought that was a person.

2951
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,740
I'm kind of blocking it, but it looks a little bit like a person.

2952
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,840
Like a lady statue or something.

2953
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:29,340
Hmm.

2954
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,640
This is an interesting area.

2955
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:33,580
What could this be?

2956
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:34,180
Oh.

2957
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:35,180
Nothing interesting.

2958
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,160
Oh.

2959
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:36,660
What?

2960
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:38,600
You didn't even look in there.

2961
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:40,440
What the?

2962
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,180
Jesse.

2963
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:43,820
Jesse.

2964
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,960
Jesse Fox.

2965
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,520
Nothing useful.

2966
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,620
Look one more time.

2967
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,420
Nothing interesting.

2968
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:50,620
Okay.

2969
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:52,980
I guess we'll come back here.

2970
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,820
Let's all remember the very uninteresting...

2971
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,280
red crate.

2972
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,600
Can you punch the fire extinguisher?

2973
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,620
No, I tried earlier.

2974
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:04,820
I actually did.

2975
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:09,640
Okay.

2976
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,800
Time to get back to the sewers.

2977
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:14,180
That was quite some ways to go.

2978
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,780
Oh, shoot.

2979
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:19,760
I need the meat.

2980
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:23,860
Okay.

2981
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:25,240
Meat!

2982
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,160
Is my dog getting fat?

2983
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,320
Oh, my God.

2984
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:32,960
Oh, my God.

2985
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:34,260
He's so fat now.

2986
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,040
Oh, he can barely even chase us.

2987
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,620
Oh, my God.

2988
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,020
We overfed the dog.

2989
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,580
Oh, my gosh.

2990
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:47,860
How terrible of us.

2991
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:53,040
We overfed the dog.

2992
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:55,820
Okay.

2993
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:58,080
Let's combine this...

2994
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,860
and our barrels...

2995
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,880
and we got a little floaty.

2996
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:08,120
After making the platform, I had what I needed to cross the sewer channels to freedom.

2997
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:12,000
Some kind of Tom and Jerry nonsense.

2998
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,380
What if we go back?

2999
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,560
I don't think he...

3000
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,340
You know...

3001
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,060
I don't think he...

3002
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,620
He wasn't like that until we left the screen, you know?

3003
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,400
The sound effects of him running too.

3004
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:35,540
Bark and grow fat.

3005
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:42,400
You're just a waddling dog.

3006
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,780
Keep waiting, buddy.

3007
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,400
That reminds me of something.

3008
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,800
The sound reminds me of something and I can't remember what.

3009
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:52,420
Okay.

3010
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:52,600
Okay.

3011
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:55,180
Okay.

3012
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:56,720
We'll leave him alone now.

3013
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,240
No, not Mr. Krabs.

3014
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:05,780
Something else from like another video game.

3015
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:08,160
Okay.

3016
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:12,720
I was so hungry that I almost bit into the raw steak.

3017
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:13,220
Oops.

3018
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:17,140
But I remembered that it's a crime to kill an animal for its meat.

3019
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:17,880
What?

3020
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:18,460
Are you vegetarian?

3021
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,020
No.

3022
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,200
Killing them is a crime.

3023
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:23,560
That's why I eat them when they're still alive.

3024
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:24,580
Jesse Fox!

3025
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,960
What is wrong with you?

3026
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,480
You guys, if you're ever just like, why can't I get a girlfriend?

3027
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:40,620
Remember, Jesse Fox got a girlfriend and he eats animals alive.

3028
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:42,700
So, you know...

3029
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,860
This guy is...

3030
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,620
Oh, my gosh.

3031
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,840
I actually just pressed that on accident.

3032
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,900
That's so funny.

3033
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:57,760
Gosh.

3034
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:00,420
I can't with this game.

3035
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:02,800
Okay.

3036
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,340
Let's select this and then use this and then...

3037
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:07,880
Okay.

3038
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:08,520
Oh.

3039
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,440
Hold on, Mr. Fox.

3040
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,180
The platform just vanished.

3041
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:12,180
What?

3042
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:13,520
Of course not.

3043
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:16,460
I picked it up every time I got to the other side.

3044
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:16,780
Oh.

3045
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:17,020
Oh, okay.

3046
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,160
You didn't mention that.

3047
01:55:18,340 --> 01:55:19,380
Sounded like it vanished.

3048
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:19,700
Oh.

3049
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,100
Well, I didn't feel like I had to mention something so obvious.

3050
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:27,480
Then should I write down that you picked up the platform every time you used it?

3051
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,400
Yes, of course.

3052
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:29,800
Well, Mr. Fox...

3053
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:30,420
Naked Snake eats them alive too.

3054
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,480
Please continue with your story.

3055
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:34,480
And Naked Snake, everybody is in love with the legend.

3056
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:35,280
I'm just saying.

3057
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:36,720
Maybe...

3058
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:39,700
Maybe we're all missing something, you know?

3059
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:42,800
Maybe...

3060
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:46,020
Maybe there's more to this than I am...

3061
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,060
than I thought, you know?

3062
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,240
An empty bottle.

3063
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:51,920
Okay.

3064
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,400
How do I get past this thing?

3065
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,960
Wait, there's like no wall.

3066
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,000
If I put the platform down...

3067
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:02,220
Oh.

3068
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,660
Okay, I think I have to put the platform down.

3069
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:08,740
Oh my gosh.

3070
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:10,500
Ah!

3071
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:12,420
Thank you.

3072
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:12,780
Thank you.

3073
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:13,560
Thank you.

3074
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,200
Thank you.

3075
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:16,940
So all we need to do is start...

3076
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:18,700
To find love is start eating animals alive.

3077
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,840
Thanks for the advice, Minto.

3078
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:20,380
Yeah!

3079
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:23,300
Oh, shoot.

3080
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:23,560
Oh.

3081
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,800
I think I didn't put it down.

3082
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,520
There we go.

3083
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:30,760
Like that far?

3084
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,080
You know?

3085
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:32,740
Okay, that's good.

3086
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:34,640
Oh!

3087
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,060
Shredded tuna.

3088
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:39,540
Mr.

3089
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,480
Fox, the noose.

3090
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,100
Oh my gosh.

3091
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,000
Get over it.

3092
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,900
Don't try my patience, Mr. Fox.

3093
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:05,900
I want that medal.

3094
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:12,220
I'm gonna get it.

3095
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,720
Something stinks really bad.

3096
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,240
Oh, another empty bottle.

3097
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:18,760
Wait a second.

3098
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,220
We've been getting these handkerchiefs?

3099
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:23,600
Ew, damp with mucus.

3100
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:24,620
We've been getting...

3101
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:25,240
It's just like me.

3102
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,780
I wonder if we can make like a molotov.

3103
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:29,840
Ah, yeah, yeah.

3104
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,460
Someone in the chat.

3105
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,920
You had the same idea as me.

3106
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:37,430
No!

3107
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:41,870
I punched instead of a...

3108
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:45,610
Oh, dang it.

3109
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:53,700
You jerks.

3110
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,100
I hope this guy gets shredded.

3111
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:00,300
Oh.

3112
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:04,720
Okay, have the platform right here.

3113
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:04,900
Ready?

3114
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:09,120
There we go.

3115
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,460
Easy peasy.

3116
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,980
Mr. Fox, the noose.

3117
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:14,600
Excuse me.

3118
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:14,980
Later.

3119
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:16,520
Skip, skip, skip dialogue.

3120
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:25,660
That was so close, you guys.

3121
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,140
That was so close.

3122
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:30,660
Which way do we wanna go first?

3123
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:32,400
Let's go this way.

3124
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:34,620
Potty.

3125
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:35,900
Potty.

3126
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:36,180
Potty.

3127
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:43,480
Nice.

3128
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:50,460
Wait, I need to level what?

3129
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:51,560
Question mark.

3130
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,440
Okay, interesting.

3131
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,640
When you die that close to a save.

3132
01:58:57,940 --> 01:58:58,740
I know, right?

3133
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:00,740
So true.

3134
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:02,280
How far?

3135
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:02,620
Okay.

3136
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:10,980
It throws me off too because it kind of doesn't put the thing right where I put it.

3137
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:11,540
You know what I mean?

3138
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:13,280
Sometimes it's a little off.

3139
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,320
Okay.

3140
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:14,800
There we go.

3141
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,040
Oh, God.

3142
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:19,160
Good golly golly.

3143
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:19,460
Good golly golly.

3144
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:19,940
Oh golly.

3145
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:22,160
What is that?

3146
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,480
Okay, we're safe here.

3147
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:55,120
You can't take me.

3148
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:56,020
Drink the water.

3149
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:59,700
Drink the water.

3150
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:00,720
Drink the water.

3151
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,080
Go.

3152
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:01,420
Go.

3153
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:01,600
Go.

3154
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:01,700
Go.

3155
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:01,920
Go.

3156
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,160
Go.

3157
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:08,990
Go.

3158
02:00:08,990 --> 02:00:09,330
Go.

3159
02:00:09,330 --> 02:00:11,390
This one goes all the way down.

3160
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:12,650
Oh my goodness!

3161
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:16,450
You coward!

3162
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:18,130
You coward fish, you!

3163
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:25,280
Okay, okay.

3164
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,420
Oh my gosh.

3165
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:30,780
Wait,

3166
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:34,980
I'm on the water.

3167
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:38,320
I think that that would be an issue.

3168
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,620
But I guess not.

3169
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:45,000
Yeah, we're gaming, you guys.

3170
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:45,400
We're gaming.

3171
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:54,840
Come here!

3172
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,900
He did get taken out by it!

3173
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:02,120
Let's go.

3174
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:07,920
Gaming real?

3175
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:09,520
Slow and steady?

3176
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:18,720
I feel like after this I should save.

3177
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:22,460
Why can't I just, you know... I should save?

3178
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,960
But like, also...

3179
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,440
Why can't I just, um...

3180
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:29,180
Like...

3181
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:35,360
Why can't I just release it into the sewers?

3182
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,180
Who cares, right?

3183
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,240
Friends get ready.

3184
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:40,760
Uh-oh.

3185
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:42,500
I'm scared.

3186
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:43,420
What do you mean?

3187
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,000
Why are we getting ready?

3188
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:55,170
By the way, how many rats were down there?

3189
02:01:56,230 --> 02:01:56,870
Oh!

3190
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:58,550
Pfft.

3191
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:00,270
No rats.

3192
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:07,410
There were like no rats.

3193
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:08,310
A lot of rats?

3194
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:14,660
Like a party of rats?

3195
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,200
Like a whole...

3196
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,240
Like...

3197
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,280
It's like a quinceañera of rats.

3198
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:22,860
Amount of rats.

3199
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:23,480
Hell yeah.

3200
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:24,980
The sewer wasn't full.

3201
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:26,360
It was a festival of sass and rats.

3202
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:26,780
Sass and...

3203
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:27,540
Ass, ass and rats.

3204
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:28,100
They were everywhere.

3205
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:30,200
Rushing to devour me alive.

3206
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,980
It was horrible.

3207
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:34,760
It felt like I was a huge chunk of cheese.

3208
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:38,000
Me, I'm the cheese!

3209
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:40,960
Oh my god.

3210
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,360
I think I went the wrong way, you guys.

3211
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:45,360
Ow!

3212
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,420
No, I'm cheese!

3213
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:48,800
I'm cheese!

3214
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:51,180
I don't wanna be cheese to me too!

3215
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:52,300
Oh my god.

3216
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:52,600
Oh!

3217
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:53,360
Oh!

3218
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:53,840
Oh!

3219
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:54,460
Oh!

3220
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:54,740
Oh!

3221
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:54,960
Oh!

3222
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,860
What is this?

3223
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:03,000
Go punch master!

3224
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,100
Jessie!

3225
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,200
Oh my god.

3226
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:07,560
I'm just cheese.

3227
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:08,400
I'm just cheese.

3228
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:26,160
Why was my cheese self so much slower than my normal self?

3229
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:31,540
Oh!

3230
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:33,300
Wait, have we been here before?

3231
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:33,640
No.

3232
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,680
This one, I don't think...

3233
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:40,300
Yeah, we can't even get past this, so we're kind of trapped now.

3234
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:49,080
Inside some debris, I found an old flamethrower.

3235
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:49,320
What?

3236
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,040
A flamethrower?

3237
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,920
It was in bad condition, but I could fix it.

3238
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:56,820
The worst part was the fuel tank was savagely chewed apart.

3239
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:01,340
It couldn't be saved, so I set out to replace it.

3240
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:02,980
Broken?

3241
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:03,880
Broken old flamethrower.

3242
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,320
Let's go!

3243
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:07,820
The fury?

3244
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:08,560
Stop.

3245
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:13,020
Would make sense why it's down here.

3246
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:16,400
Brutally attacking a fish man?

3247
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,100
It's like you're already a member of FaZe Connect.

3248
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:18,960
No, no.

3249
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:26,080
I think I need stronger punches.

3250
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:30,720
Alright, let's go to this ladder.

3251
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:34,810
Oooh!

3252
02:04:34,830 --> 02:04:39,050
Now we're right in front of a... bathroom!

3253
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,680
Jessie's voice actor says, good job.

3254
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:52,560
Thanks!

3255
02:04:57,380 --> 02:04:59,260
Stop you guys, I already have a big head.

3256
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,440
I'm taking up so much of the screen.

3257
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:10,400
Good thing, it's nice that they gave you so much health after the rats.

3258
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,600
Do items disappear after a while?

3259
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,700
Let's go down instead of up first.

3260
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:15,980
Let's go down here.

3261
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:16,640
Just kidding!

3262
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:21,460
Oh, just kidding!

3263
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,160
Wait, then where do I go?

3264
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,740
The whole dev team is watching, no pressure.

3265
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:31,580
No, if everybody's watching, I'm having so much fun.

3266
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:32,280
Thank you!

3267
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:34,100
This is so awesome.

3268
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,900
We're all here, stop!

3269
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:46,120
Oh my gosh, no pressure.

3270
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:49,680
Let's see, what was back here?

3271
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:52,020
Was there anything else we could...

3272
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:00,160
Do I molotov something?

3273
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:04,420
Maybe I blow up the tires.

3274
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:07,540
Ask the radio?

3275
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,040
Oh my gosh, you guys are so right.

3276
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,360
What if I was lost in Metal Gear?

3277
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,900
Of course I would ask Colonel.

3278
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,500
Shit, there's no signal down here.

3279
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:17,160
You guys, there's no signal!

3280
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:20,080
Oh wait.

3281
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:26,980
Jessie here, over.

3282
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:29,220
Shit, there's no signal down here.

3283
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:30,140
What do you mean down here?

3284
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,780
Jessie, we're up on land!

3285
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,200
Here, maybe in the bathroom.

3286
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:37,680
Something, something.

3287
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:41,000
Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime.

3288
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:43,700
That's why I call Colonel on company time.

3289
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:44,860
Jessie here, over.

3290
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,300
Shit, there's no signal down here.

3291
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:48,200
This place sucks!

3292
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:52,600
Can't even check my memes while I'm on the toilet.

3293
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,640
We're on our own, you guys.

3294
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:05,290
That's why I watch VTubers.

3295
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:07,130
On company time.

3296
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:08,170
Let's see.

3297
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:10,930
Combine with you.

3298
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:12,990
And combine...

3299
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:16,270
you...

3300
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:19,410
Combine you...

3301
02:07:19,810 --> 02:07:20,390
with you.

3302
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:22,710
Oh, it doesn't work.

3303
02:07:23,570 --> 02:07:24,470
Just kidding.

3304
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:26,350
Wait, I can make another one even.

3305
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:28,170
Combine you with you.

3306
02:07:32,630 --> 02:07:34,510
Oh wait, the gas tank is broken!

3307
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:35,530
Oh!

3308
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:42,930
I had to replace the flamethrower's broken fuel tank before I could fill it up.

3309
02:07:44,570 --> 02:07:45,170
Oh, the fuel tank.

3310
02:07:45,170 --> 02:07:47,670
Gas tank, fuel tank, same thing, right?

3311
02:07:48,090 --> 02:07:49,750
Can't wait for unmetal unvengeance.

3312
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:58,530
Oh, the big blue one.

3313
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:00,490
You think the plastic drum would work?

3314
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:03,030
Oh!

3315
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:05,690
And it's gas, gas, gas, baby!

3316
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:12,850
After the repairs, my flamethrower was ready.

3317
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:18,710
The tubes were covered in rust, so I took great care to avoid overheating it.

3318
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:20,730
Okay, no overheating.

3319
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:21,350
Got it, got it.

3320
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:25,600
How do I use the flamethrower?

3321
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:27,540
Z.

3322
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:35,150
Oh?

3323
02:08:35,610 --> 02:08:35,910
Z?

3324
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:37,350
X.

3325
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:37,490
X.

3326
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:38,370
Hmm?

3327
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:41,530
Hmm?

3328
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,640
Huh?

3329
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:48,580
Oh, space!

3330
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:49,840
Did it say that?

3331
02:08:56,060 --> 02:08:57,560
Why does it say Z then?

3332
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:02,030
Whoa!

3333
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:04,690
Okay, no, okay.

3334
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:06,150
Got it, got it, got it.

3335
02:09:10,410 --> 02:09:10,810
Yeah!

3336
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:11,210
Okay!

3337
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:13,550
Oh, no!

3338
02:09:23,610 --> 02:09:24,950
Oh my gosh, this is not good.

3339
02:09:25,110 --> 02:09:26,150
Can I punch the rats?

3340
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:28,050
No, I can't punch the rats.

3341
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:40,000
I died to the rats!

3342
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:43,880
Oh, rats.

3343
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,080
Oh, rats.

3344
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,340
Okay, but we know what to do now.

3345
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,300
Combine.

3346
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:52,740
Combine.

3347
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:53,620
Combine.

3348
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,300
Gas it up, baby.

3349
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:57,140
Select, baby.

3350
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:58,640
Yeah, yeah.

3351
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:00,020
I know.

3352
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:02,000
I'm not gonna overheat it.

3353
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:04,260
Hopefully.

3354
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:13,290
We're just gonna take this baby out.

3355
02:10:13,530 --> 02:10:17,050
We're not even gonna focus on the... the tire yet.

3356
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:18,350
We're gonna focus on the rats.

3357
02:10:19,650 --> 02:10:20,430
Here they come.

3358
02:10:26,910 --> 02:10:27,530
Yeah, yeah.

3359
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:30,410
So easy.

3360
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:33,870
Oh, good.

3361
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:36,130
Oh, there's more of them!

3362
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:42,060
See?

3363
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,060
So easy.

3364
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:53,280
Yeah, I thought the rats were gonna keep coming and keep on coming, you know?

3365
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:54,700
I thought they were gonna be infinite rats.

3366
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:57,600
Okay.

3367
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:59,360
No more rats, maybe.

3368
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:04,240
I say as I creep...

3369
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:04,860
Oh, gosh.

3370
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:09,040
Just run!

3371
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:10,080
Oh, my God.

3372
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:11,260
Wait, there's more rats.

3373
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,840
The music is so...

3374
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,420
The music gets me so bad.

3375
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,300
It's like...

3376
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:24,560
It's making me panic a little bit.

3377
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,860
Okay, let's wait before we continue onwards.

3378
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,400
Jump scared endlessly by the rat brigade.

3379
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,460
At least I'm not a piece of cheese this time.

3380
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:38,740
Where are the rats gonna come from?

3381
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:41,760
Okay, now they want us to circle the rats.

3382
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:42,560
Oh, my gosh.

3383
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:42,900
Wait.

3384
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,540
Oh, my God.

3385
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:44,780
Ah!

3386
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:46,080
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

3387
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:46,640
Ah!

3388
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:47,420
I'm gonna die to rats!

3389
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:51,960
Oh, I'm gonna die to rats.

3390
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,520
I'm gonna die to the rats!

3391
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,640
Oh, I'm stuck on the wall.

3392
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:55,460
No!

3393
02:11:55,780 --> 02:11:56,520
They keep coming!

3394
02:11:57,740 --> 02:11:59,640
Okay, now we're actually dead to the rats.

3395
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:01,840
No!

3396
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:04,360
No!

3397
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:10,660
Okay, once we get through the first two rats, you guys, we gotta save.

3398
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:12,660
I need a plan for that one.

3399
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:17,540
We need a plan for that one.

3400
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,400
Let's see.

3401
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:19,540
Oh, come on.

3402
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,240
Come on.

3403
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,260
Okay.

3404
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,440
Oh, you're right.

3405
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:24,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3406
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,500
Good, good, good.

3407
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:27,600
And...

3408
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:28,160
Select.

3409
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:28,800
Okay.

3410
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,500
Typing of the rats.

3411
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:36,600
You can use your porta-potty more than once.

3412
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:38,080
I just emptied it, so we're good.

3413
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:43,850
NYC Subway experience.

3414
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:48,790
Rat Eater.

3415
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:53,210
This is like the-the crab fight, or whatever, you know.

3416
02:12:53,950 --> 02:12:54,690
Oh, wow.

3417
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:56,730
Take care of these guys first.

3418
02:13:03,940 --> 02:13:06,220
Okay, now second round of rats.

3419
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:07,300
Come out!

3420
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:13,350
Okay, you rats!

3421
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:17,170
Perfect.

3422
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:28,410
So as we pray, unlimited rat works.

3423
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:31,350
This is because I chose earlier about the rats, man.

3424
02:13:37,870 --> 02:13:38,530
Oh gosh!

3425
02:13:38,650 --> 02:13:39,670
Oh gosh!

3426
02:13:39,850 --> 02:13:40,050
Oh gosh!

3427
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:46,630
I'm not bleeding, am I?

3428
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:48,230
I don't think so.

3429
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:53,150
I think I'm only bleeding out if it's like right around the screen, right?

3430
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:58,630
I like how... actually it's kind of subtle, but when I use the flamethrower, it lights up the room.

3431
02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:59,470
Did you guys notice that?

3432
02:14:00,650 --> 02:14:02,130
It's a cool little subtle detail.

3433
02:14:02,290 --> 02:14:02,430
Okay.

3434
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:06,090
Now, let's port-a-potty.

3435
02:14:13,330 --> 02:14:15,530
Yeah, it's a nice little attention to detail, right?

3436
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:17,310
Can we use the meat?

3437
02:14:19,390 --> 02:14:21,390
Can we throw the meat if you like?

3438
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:22,290
Oh.

3439
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:23,750
I don't know.

3440
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:25,370
This is a vermintide.

3441
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:27,850
Okay.

3442
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:29,690
Alright.

3443
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:35,790
They came out from... where first?

3444
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:37,870
Above, I think?

3445
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:46,070
Oh, I didn't combine these either.

3446
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:48,430
Nice.

3447
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:51,690
Okay.

3448
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:59,210
Would you fight one legendary soldier or 100 rats?

3449
02:15:04,650 --> 02:15:05,250
Oh

3450
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:11,850
my god, they come from above too!

3451
02:15:12,250 --> 02:15:13,830
Oh my gosh, they come from everywhere!

3452
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:15,470
What the...

3453
02:15:16,030 --> 02:15:17,530
Oh, my thing blew up.

3454
02:15:19,030 --> 02:15:20,110
I overheated it.

3455
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,580
They come from above!

3456
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:27,200
They don't just come from the holes either!

3457
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,880
They come from everything!

3458
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:30,980
Oh, boy...

3459
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,400
Oh my gosh.

3460
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:53,630
I was trying to see if I could quarter them.

3461
02:15:55,070 --> 02:15:56,110
But if they come...

3462
02:15:56,610 --> 02:16:00,510
If they come where I'm standing too, it doesn't really help.

3463
02:16:01,590 --> 02:16:01,870
Huh?

3464
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:06,230
I know that...

3465
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:08,410
It seems like I need to circle them somehow.

3466
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:09,870
Like, loop them.

3467
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:17,290
I think you need to keep moving.

3468
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:17,650
Yeah.

3469
02:16:20,490 --> 02:16:22,410
You were really on fire there.

3470
02:16:25,670 --> 02:16:27,470
What's the AI summary saying?

3471
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:28,790
Oh, gosh.

3472
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:29,190
Ah!

3473
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:34,790
Oh!

3474
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,260
Am I going little bits?

3475
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:42,840
Yippee!

3476
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:43,400
Ah!

3477
02:17:12,810 --> 02:17:14,190
Reign of rodents!

3478
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:19,880
I wanna use the bathroom, please!

3479
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:26,800
Oh, I see it down there.

3480
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,060
Oh, gosh.

3481
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:28,860
Wait!

3482
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:30,680
Can I use the bathroom again?

3483
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:32,340
It needs to be emptied.

3484
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:33,660
What if I just try it again?

3485
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,600
I couldn't use that potty.

3486
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:36,560
It was full.

3487
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:39,600
I had to empty it in some toilet.

3488
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:40,060
No!

3489
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:42,380
Why didn't you just empty it anywhere?

3490
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:43,040
Yeah!

3491
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:44,520
Because I'm not a pig.

3492
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:45,420
We're in the silvers!

3493
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:49,680
Moreover, if I wanted to water the plants anywhere, why did I need a potty?

3494
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,160
And you took your urine with you?

3495
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,560
Yes, until the next toilet.

3496
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:56,460
There, I emptied it to reuse it again.

3497
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:57,560
Wait, why don't I just go back?

3498
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:01,200
What's stopping me from going back?

3499
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,220
You know what?

3500
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:02,940
Never mind.

3501
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:04,020
Maybe I'm a genius.

3502
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:04,740
Hold on.

3503
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:10,660
What if I just go back to the bathroom?

3504
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:11,980
What if I just...

3505
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,700
What if I just run all the way back home?

3506
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:19,220
What if I just go back?

3507
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:24,260
What if I just take the stairs, the little ladder, and dump it and re-save?

3508
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,560
Oh, some rats are gonna stop me?

3509
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:29,740
Huh?

3510
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:31,120
What if I just...

3511
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,540
Yes, tensai, tensai.

3512
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:36,040
My mom made a joke on how you kept dying.

3513
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:36,980
Stop, mom!

3514
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:40,120
Mom, don't embarrass me!

3515
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:43,520
There we go!

3516
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:44,460
See you!

3517
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:55,560
Why does Jesse have such strange morals?

3518
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:59,540
He's just like, I can't just...

3519
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:00,300
You know what?

3520
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:01,100
I kind of get it, though.

3521
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:07,200
Even though this is the sewers and it's disgusting and smelly and nasty, even I don't think I would feel right.

3522
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:10,240
Even I would feel like I...

3523
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,660
It needs to go into a toilet so it gets cleaned in a proper channel.

3524
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:18,180
Rat assassins are terrifying, but they got nothing on Zanzibar land.

3525
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:19,620
Poisonous hamsters.

3526
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:23,100
Oh yeah, I remember those.

3527
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:25,160
Oh yeah.

3528
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:29,360
I remember when Big Boss said, the hamster is unleashed.

3529
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:32,180
And just released all these hamsters.

3530
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,140
Okay.

3531
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:41,520
Now we saved right here, so when we inevitably die, we can just start back where we started.

3532
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:50,840
Oh gosh.

3533
02:19:51,060 --> 02:19:51,520
Oh gosh.

3534
02:19:56,850 --> 02:19:58,010
It's quartering me!

3535
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:08,500
Oh my goodness.

3536
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:15,960
We made it, you guys.

3537
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:18,360
Somehow.

3538
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:19,720
Oh man.

3539
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:23,240
Wait, are we gonna have to deal with rats and...

3540
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:24,900
And spikes?

3541
02:20:25,380 --> 02:20:26,140
Thank you, thank you.

3542
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:26,780
Bye.

3543
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:28,940
Minto cute.

3544
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:29,960
Dough.

3545
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:30,840
Stop it.

3546
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:33,000
Let's see.

3547
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:37,320
Let's get our floating contraption back.

3548
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:40,140
And have C on the ready.

3549
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:42,940
There's a secret on this screen?

3550
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,540
Is it here?

3551
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,360
Secret on this screen.

3552
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:55,460
Secret?

3553
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:08,070
Oh, you know what?

3554
02:21:08,130 --> 02:21:08,570
I'll take that.

3555
02:21:13,430 --> 02:21:14,590
Take that.

3556
02:21:16,830 --> 02:21:17,410
Secret?

3557
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:19,950
Secret.

3558
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:22,070
Do I need to burn something?

3559
02:21:22,470 --> 02:21:23,590
Maybe in this hole.

3560
02:21:25,970 --> 02:21:26,530
Nope.

3561
02:21:32,810 --> 02:21:35,130
Small chest in the upper middle left?

3562
02:21:35,410 --> 02:21:35,750
What?

3563
02:21:36,130 --> 02:21:37,290
There's a chest?

3564
02:21:37,630 --> 02:21:37,930
What?

3565
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:44,270
A weird box in the upper right?

3566
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:47,530
That's not a chest.

3567
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:48,790
That's water, is it not?

3568
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,960
What's happening?

3569
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:02,500
Oh, this one's fast.

3570
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,640
Secret on this screen.

3571
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:10,700
Maybe...

3572
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,600
Hold on.

3573
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:14,260
Maybe it's somewhere like along the walls that...

3574
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:15,620
Like here?

3575
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:29,450
Wait.

3576
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:30,410
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3577
02:22:30,810 --> 02:22:31,650
I think I know.

3578
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:32,250
I think I know.

3579
02:22:32,570 --> 02:22:34,190
I think I put my floaty there.

3580
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,770
I think I put my floaty there.

3581
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:39,110
The hell you did...

3582
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:39,790
Okay.

3583
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:45,510
Mystery.

3584
02:22:47,930 --> 02:22:48,590
Stamina?

3585
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:51,930
Oh, it's a passive.

3586
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:53,030
Oh, it's a passive.

3587
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:53,210
Woo hoo!

3588
02:22:56,990 --> 02:22:58,770
Why is it so creepy in here?

3589
02:23:00,970 --> 02:23:02,690
It's so creepy in here.

3590
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:03,730
Oh, ah.

3591
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:05,110
Okay, good.

3592
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,790
Oh, shush.

3593
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:13,980
That was close.

3594
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:18,080
Thank you, Dev!

3595
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,380
I'll take it.

3596
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:55,190
It's okay, all we gotta do is take out some rats again.

3597
02:23:57,070 --> 02:23:57,910
Awww...

3598
02:23:58,830 --> 02:23:59,670
Okay.

3599
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:22,210
No worries, everybody!

3600
02:24:23,570 --> 02:24:24,570
No problems!

3601
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:29,990
No problems, we can get back in our spot.

3602
02:24:30,190 --> 02:24:31,030
Easy peasy.

3603
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:35,770
Right where we left off.

3604
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:37,170
Right here.

3605
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,060
Easy peasy.

3606
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:51,280
Very cute.

3607
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,720
This is the first time I sent this.

3608
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:53,520
No, it's not.

3609
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:54,380
Don't lie to me!

3610
02:25:04,450 --> 02:25:06,710
Sometimes the placement for this really...

3611
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:09,030
Oh yeah, that's right.

3612
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:09,610
We gotta heal.

3613
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:13,510
Really?

3614
02:25:14,650 --> 02:25:15,510
Gets me bad.

3615
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:18,890
Alright, let's not get greedy with this one now.

3616
02:25:29,970 --> 02:25:30,370
Huh.

3617
02:25:31,850 --> 02:25:33,390
Oh, why did it just save?

3618
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:35,570
Run!

3619
02:25:44,310 --> 02:25:45,390
Punch the wall, punch the wall.

3620
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:46,990
Punch the wall, punch the wall.

3621
02:25:47,210 --> 02:25:47,610
Run!

3622
02:25:49,310 --> 02:25:51,210
You must have been very lonely down there.

3623
02:25:51,390 --> 02:25:51,450
Oh.

3624
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:53,610
Nah, I had some company.

3625
02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:54,630
The rats?

3626
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:57,390
What is that?

3627
02:25:58,270 --> 02:25:59,390
The sewer junk?

3628
02:25:59,390 --> 02:26:00,460
The sewer junk?

3629
02:26:03,870 --> 02:26:04,850
Do I flamethrow you?

3630
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,190
Oh, okay.

3631
02:26:08,450 --> 02:26:09,490
What's he gonna do?

3632
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:14,370
Bold as a...

3633
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:15,250
Aaaaah!

3634
02:26:15,310 --> 02:26:16,210
More rats!

3635
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:18,110
Oh my gosh.

3636
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:24,590
Oh, I can't get that yet.

3637
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,730
More

3638
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:34,540
rats?

3639
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:38,720
More of them.

3640
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:41,160
I gotta get him too, though.

3641
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:45,920
Okay.

3642
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:48,200
Alright, more rats.

3643
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:55,000
And that thing had tentacles?

3644
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:55,480
What?

3645
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:58,040
Well, now that you mention it...

3646
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:04,420
I don't like that we're rewriting history here.

3647
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:06,620
Um, why is...

3648
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:08,720
He's just trying to make himself seem cooler, huh?

3649
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:10,920
Six tentacles?

3650
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:11,760
Are you guys...

3651
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:14,740
You guys are so mean to me.

3652
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:18,460
You guys are so mean to me.

3653
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:26,520
It had six tentacles.

3654
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:28,780
Aaaaah!

3655
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:31,540
Aaaaah!

3656
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:31,980
Aaaaah!

3657
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:34,800
And rats.

3658
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:36,600
Oh, okay.

3659
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:38,340
Speak of the...

3660
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:39,440
Pearl-p discomfort Rodents.

3661
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:41,320
Speaking of the...

3662
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:41,620
Oh my gosh.

3663
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:42,660
AAAAAH!!!

3664
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:46,680
Ouch!

3665
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,240
Ouch!

3666
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:48,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3667
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:48,420
Ouch!

3668
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:48,660
Oh my gosh!

3669
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:49,660
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3670
02:28:02,070 --> 02:28:03,170
You guys, you guys...

3671
02:28:03,170 --> 02:28:03,610
This isn't good.

3672
02:28:05,730 --> 02:28:06,470
THIS ISN'T GOOD!

3673
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:09,950
You guys, this isn't good.

3674
02:28:10,230 --> 02:28:11,330
This is actually quite bad.

3675
02:28:16,110 --> 02:28:16,890
Oh my god.

3676
02:28:16,890 --> 02:28:16,890
Oh my god.

3677
02:28:17,010 --> 02:28:18,210
I can't even get a hit in.

3678
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:25,770
I couldn't even get a hit in.

3679
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:30,090
It feels like Resident Evil.

3680
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:32,610
You must have been very lonely down there.

3681
02:28:32,730 --> 02:28:33,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3682
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:46,760
Let's get as many hits as we can.

3683
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:49,840
Oh, uh oh.

3684
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:51,080
I also need to...

3685
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:54,440
I'll not overheat my thing.

3686
02:28:55,380 --> 02:28:56,120
Kill the rat.

3687
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:01,800
And that thing had tentacles?

3688
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:06,600
What if I said only two tentacles?

3689
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:07,940
Okay, we'll say four.

3690
02:29:08,140 --> 02:29:08,720
Let's go in the middle.

3691
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:10,680
Four is a spooky number, you guys.

3692
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,960
I think four is a good medium.

3693
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:15,120
Four tentacles.

3694
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:16,720
Four tentacles.

3695
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:17,660
Spooky number, right?

3696
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:25,140
Four is a spooky number.

3697
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,940
Four means death.

3698
02:29:28,980 --> 02:29:29,200
I know.

3699
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:31,480
It had four pairs of tentacles.

3700
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:31,900
No!

3701
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:49,750
All I was trying was just a spooky number.

3702
02:29:52,030 --> 02:29:53,110
This is NOT fair!

3703
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:53,350
This IS not fair.

3704
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:04,960
Not fair!

3705
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:04,960
Need

3706
02:30:09,010 --> 02:30:10,150
to avoid the-

3707
02:30:13,190 --> 02:30:13,590
Wait...

3708
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:15,110
well, the rats not come upstairs?

3709
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:17,790
Can I actually hide here?

3710
02:30:19,290 --> 02:30:20,870
Not hide, but you know what I mean.

3711
02:30:21,010 --> 02:30:21,630
Oh, never mind.

3712
02:30:21,810 --> 02:30:22,030
NO!

3713
02:30:22,110 --> 02:30:23,030
They definitely come up here.

3714
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:28,170
Seems like a decent spot, though.

3715
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:30,870
Right?

3716
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:32,670
Gosh, never mind.

3717
02:30:37,390 --> 02:30:38,970
How am I supposed to get any hits in?

3718
02:30:39,470 --> 02:30:39,830
Wait.

3719
02:30:43,770 --> 02:30:45,670
Select and use... there we go.

3720
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:57,980
Can you come back here, mister?

3721
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:58,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3722
02:30:59,000 --> 02:30:59,640
Oh my gosh.

3723
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:01,680
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3724
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:08,320
Oh my gosh, I'm stuck.

3725
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:09,060
I'm stuck!

3726
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:11,280
I

3727
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:16,920
wonder what happens if we pick two, then.

3728
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:18,360
Two giant tentacles?

3729
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:20,280
Two... dozen?

3730
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,080
What if it says two dozen tentacles?

3731
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,060
Do you think that'll happen?

3732
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:33,580
Sewer junk.

3733
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:35,100
How long have I been streaming for?

3734
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:36,420
Oh, only two and a half hours.

3735
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:42,600
And here come the rats.

3736
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:46,000
I scheduled the rats.

3737
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,500
The rats on schedule.

3738
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:53,580
The rats are on schedule.

3739
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:56,280
Two million tentacles.

3740
02:31:56,320 --> 02:31:57,320
Too many tentacles.

3741
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:01,080
And that thing had tentacles?

3742
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:03,000
Let's try two.

3743
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:04,040
I'm so curious.

3744
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:06,760
I think it's gonna say, like, two dozen tentacles.

3745
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:09,620
It had two dozen tentacles.

3746
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:13,860
You guys, I'm a Metal Gear fan.

3747
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:14,680
I know this.

3748
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:16,680
I'm a Metal Gear fan.

3749
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:21,020
That's how you know I'm a real one, you know?

3750
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:22,200
Oh my gosh.

3751
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:23,260
Oh my gosh.

3752
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:24,680
Oh my gosh!

3753
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:27,600
There was no running.

3754
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,060
Wait a second.

3755
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:33,720
Can I use my little thing?

3756
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:34,280
Oh, I can.

3757
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:43,360
Are there...

3758
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:45,180
No, I was gonna say, are there less rats?

3759
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:45,700
Nope.

3760
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:46,360
Oh my gosh.

3761
02:32:55,780 --> 02:32:56,180
No.

3762
02:32:59,940 --> 02:33:00,880
Oh my gosh.

3763
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:01,600
Oh my gosh.

3764
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:02,020
I'm trapped.

3765
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:02,820
I can't even...

3766
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:04,380
I can't...

3767
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:07,300
I can't even get a hint in on the guy.

3768
02:33:14,470 --> 02:33:15,810
He's taking out the thing!

3769
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:20,310
He's taking out the platforms!

3770
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:22,070
Wait, this is actually good.

3771
02:33:23,230 --> 02:33:24,050
Oh, never mind.

3772
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:27,790
I didn't notice my health.

3773
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:32,510
But the platforms are good because that means we only have to deal with one set of rats.

3774
02:33:39,710 --> 02:33:41,450
You must have been very lonely down there.

3775
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:42,370
Meh.

3776
02:33:42,670 --> 02:33:43,790
I had some company.

3777
02:33:44,410 --> 02:33:45,610
What does six do?

3778
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:46,730
It gives him six tentacles.

3779
02:33:48,370 --> 02:33:48,890
Oh!

3780
02:33:49,430 --> 02:33:50,230
I'm hacking?

3781
02:33:51,370 --> 02:33:51,890
I'm...

3782
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:52,690
I'm...

3783
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:16,040
Yeah, maybe he'll take out the platforms faster if he has more tentacles, you know?

3784
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:16,700
Yeah.

3785
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:18,800
And that thing had...

3786
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:21,980
So maybe the two dozen is better than...

3787
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:24,140
than...

3788
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:25,780
Not.

3789
02:34:25,860 --> 02:34:26,220
Not.

3790
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:28,800
No.

3791
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:31,320
It had two dozen tentacles.

3792
02:34:32,300 --> 02:34:32,700
Uh-uh.

3793
02:34:41,210 --> 02:34:44,750
Look, there's only a few rats, even.

3794
02:34:46,250 --> 02:34:46,850
Just kidding.

3795
02:34:46,950 --> 02:34:47,710
There's a ton of rats.

3796
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:55,630
I was like, wow, it only sent out a few.

3797
02:34:55,650 --> 02:34:56,330
So few rats.

3798
02:35:02,310 --> 02:35:02,990
Oh, my gosh.

3799
02:35:02,990 --> 02:35:03,930
Wait, we're trapping ourselves?

3800
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:05,090
We're trapping ourselves?

3801
02:35:05,090 --> 02:35:05,490
Here we go.

3802
02:35:25,770 --> 02:35:31,870
We can reach him from there though.

3803
02:35:33,130 --> 02:35:36,170
Let's select this just for now, so I can have it on...

3804
02:35:42,450 --> 02:35:44,570
Okay, run, run!

3805
02:35:44,610 --> 02:35:44,830
No!

3806
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:45,830
I missed my chance!

3807
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:52,600
Okay, we got him a couple bit.

3808
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:54,440
Yowza!

3809
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:58,880
A yowza!

3810
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:00,920
Oh my gosh.

3811
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:01,720
Ouch!

3812
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:05,680
That was close, that was close.

3813
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:18,060
Okay, okay, okay.

3814
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:25,680
Nice suit.

3815
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:28,640
If I can get some hits in, it stops the attack even.

3816
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:32,660
Well, not entirely, I suppose.

3817
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:34,620
Just a little bit.

3818
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:36,200
But we can get some attacks in.

3819
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:39,520
Zumpets.

3820
02:37:03,580 --> 02:37:04,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

3821
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:05,460
Nice, nice.

3822
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:15,200
Maybe we can get another hit.

3823
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:21,420
I nearly had that thing dead, but then my luck turned south.

3824
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:22,080
Wait, what do you mean?

3825
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:23,460
The old flamethrower.

3826
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:26,120
Broke apart.

3827
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:30,140
Broke apart as I continued the fight.

3828
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:30,440
No!

3829
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:33,260
So I finished it the old-fashioned way.

3830
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:34,820
With my fists!

3831
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:37,740
Oh, okay.

3832
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:41,420
How am I supposed to punch him?

3833
02:37:41,940 --> 02:37:43,840
From this angle, from this distance?

3834
02:37:47,060 --> 02:37:49,080
Where is... show back up.

3835
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:51,300
Ouch!

3836
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:52,440
Oh, ouch!

3837
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:52,760
Oh!

3838
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,360
Oh, he trapped me!

3839
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:08,520
That was so unfair!

3840
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:11,200
No!

3841
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:19,220
Oh, he trapped me!

3842
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:22,920
No!

3843
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:26,220
I should have punched him while I was sitting there.

3844
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:32,080
But, this is the strat.

3845
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,700
The 24 tentacles works.

3846
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:34,760
He must have been very lonely down there.

3847
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:38,920
24 tentacles is better than 6 tentacles, I think.

3848
02:38:46,980 --> 02:38:48,080
Thanks for the tomatoes.

3849
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:49,580
Healthy snack.

3850
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:50,260
Oh.

3851
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:51,080
Oh.

3852
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:56,180
Oh.

3853
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:06,200
And that thing had...

3854
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:08,800
Yeah, had two dozen tentacles.

3855
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:09,900
I wonder what exploded does.

3856
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:12,760
I was scared though that it was going to explode and kill me.

3857
02:39:14,220 --> 02:39:14,700
Right?

3858
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,120
It had two.

3859
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:18,160
Two dozen tentacles.

3860
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:22,380
Two dozen tentacles.

3861
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:24,200
Ah!

3862
02:39:25,240 --> 02:39:25,720
Ah!

3863
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:26,640
Ouch!

3864
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:31,600
Oh, they only send like two out at the beginning.

3865
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,260
That's nice.

3866
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:32,640
Okay.

3867
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:35,560
Oh, my God!

3868
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:41,000
We're gaming a little bit.

3869
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:42,980
Oh, yeah, yeah!

3870
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:44,000
Oh, yeah, yeah!

3871
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:45,480
Oh, my God!

3872
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:47,280
Oh, my God!

3873
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:51,480
Oh, one second.

3874
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:53,740
Let me also... select that.

3875
02:39:58,030 --> 02:39:58,360
Yeah!

3876
02:39:58,480 --> 02:39:59,020
Yeah!

3877
02:39:59,140 --> 02:39:59,440
Yeah!

3878
02:39:59,660 --> 02:39:59,800
Yeah!

3879
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:02,360
Two tiny rats.

3880
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:03,940
Two tiny rats!

3881
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:07,500
Lots of rats.

3882
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:09,380
Many rats.

3883
02:40:10,420 --> 02:40:11,360
Yeah, yeah.

3884
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:13,000
Assassin rats.

3885
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:18,800
Okay.

3886
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:25,260
Hey, that was pretty good though.

3887
02:40:27,380 --> 02:40:31,000
We took out... we got some hits and we took out some stuff, so...

3888
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:34,800
Oh, gosh.

3889
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:36,260
Not good.

3890
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:36,700
Not good.

3891
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:36,940
Not good.

3892
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:38,560
Okay.

3893
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:40,500
Okay.

3894
02:40:41,660 --> 02:40:42,260
All right.

3895
02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:42,940
All right.

3896
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:43,400
All right.

3897
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:43,780
All right.

3898
02:40:43,780 --> 02:40:45,640
Keep taking out those platforms.

3899
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:48,180
Oh, my gosh.

3900
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:49,400
Yeah.

3901
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:53,180
And come up here, rats.

3902
02:40:53,620 --> 02:40:54,120
Yes.

3903
02:40:54,340 --> 02:40:55,920
A little rat party up here.

3904
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:01,360
Did he squish the rats?

3905
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,420
I think he squished the rats.

3906
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:09,300
He just took them out.

3907
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,480
I'm grazing.

3908
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:16,140
I'm grazing.

3909
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:16,640
I'm grazing.

3910
02:41:19,240 --> 02:41:20,540
No more rats, baby.

3911
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:21,620
Yippee!

3912
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:24,060
Oh, uh...

3913
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:28,040
Am I supposed to use my floaty here and...

3914
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:28,680
I'm grazing.

3915
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:29,180
I'm grazing.

3916
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,100
Just like Toho.

3917
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:32,040
Graze bonus.

3918
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:42,120
Nice.

3919
02:41:42,460 --> 02:41:42,960
Oh,

3920
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:47,900
come on.

3921
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:48,660
That's so cheap.

3922
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:53,420
That's so cheap.

3923
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:54,260
Wait, can I shoot?

3924
02:41:54,460 --> 02:41:54,960
Oh, wait.

3925
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:55,340
Just kidding.

3926
02:41:55,480 --> 02:41:58,840
I would have to switch to my gun, I think, maybe.

3927
02:41:59,060 --> 02:41:59,400
Hold on.

3928
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:01,340
Let's see if I switch to it.

3929
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:05,580
Oh, it does work!

3930
02:42:11,730 --> 02:42:12,530
Oh, dang.

3931
02:42:12,730 --> 02:42:13,010
Okay.

3932
02:42:13,570 --> 02:42:14,910
Well, there was an attempt.

3933
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,390
Oh.

3934
02:42:19,350 --> 02:42:22,230
Why does he keep going over there as if I can join him?

3935
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:24,610
Oh, and I can't even... I can't even reach.

3936
02:42:26,270 --> 02:42:27,390
I can't even reach.

3937
02:42:31,990 --> 02:42:33,350
Come over here, you coward!

3938
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,760
Nice.

3939
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:44,000
Okay.

3940
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:50,020
Dang.

3941
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:53,100
Where are you gonna be at?

3942
02:42:58,190 --> 02:42:59,310
Oh, wait.

3943
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:02,650
Once I'm running away, maybe it'd be good to use this.

3944
02:43:03,770 --> 02:43:04,430
Dang it.

3945
02:43:04,510 --> 02:43:05,030
Never mind.

3946
02:43:06,430 --> 02:43:07,550
There was...

3947
02:43:07,550 --> 02:43:11,550
I nearly had that thing dead, but then my luck turned south.

3948
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:13,430
The old flamethrower?

3949
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:16,610
If I say exploded, will I die?

3950
02:43:18,170 --> 02:43:20,790
You guys, will I have to do the fight all over again?

3951
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:23,610
It exploded.

3952
02:43:24,990 --> 02:43:25,550
Exploded?

3953
02:43:25,550 --> 02:43:27,490
Due to a gasoline leak.

3954
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:49,390
I'm never trusting you guys again.

3955
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,440
I'm never trusting you guys again.

3956
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:02,180
You know what?

3957
02:44:02,220 --> 02:44:02,800
Get off the screen.

3958
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:03,600
You disgust me.

3959
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:05,120
Get off the screen.

3960
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:10,700
You're not worthy of being on the stream anymore.

3961
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:12,020
You must have been very lonely down there.

3962
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:21,620
Yeah, I absolutely goddamn do!

3963
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:24,320
You assholes!

3964
02:44:29,300 --> 02:44:31,440
Why do you bully me so much?

3965
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:40,680
I thought maybe if it exploded, I...

3966
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:42,900
And that thing had...

3967
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,300
I could like... what's the word?

3968
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:49,420
I could like... throw it at it, you know?

3969
02:44:49,540 --> 02:44:50,760
And do mega damage.

3970
02:44:50,920 --> 02:44:52,600
And two dozen tentacles.

3971
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:54,280
DD Mega Doodoo.

3972
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:55,660
And tokko.

3973
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:05,460
And stopping them.

3974
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:05,720
Why do you get stressed over one thing only?!

3975
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:10,520
I really like how this boss is trying to fight against her.

3976
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:11,160
Shut up.

3977
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,580
THANKS FOR I don't want to hear your SASS!

3978
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:16,160
Yes, I don't want your sass at all.

3979
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:23,430
What are you saying?

3980
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:24,750
One guy-ing?

3981
02:45:24,810 --> 02:45:25,610
As if...

3982
02:45:26,310 --> 02:45:30,350
As if the whole chat wasn't being like, Oh, try exploding it.

3983
02:45:30,410 --> 02:45:31,430
Try exploding it.

3984
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:32,450
What do you mean, what?

3985
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:32,990
Oh, shoot.

3986
02:45:33,350 --> 02:45:34,550
One guy-ed.

3987
02:45:34,550 --> 02:45:35,610
Oh, yeah, totally.

3988
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:39,090
The whole chat wasn't saying, Hey, try exploding it.

3989
02:45:39,110 --> 02:45:39,510
It'll help.

3990
02:45:41,870 --> 02:45:42,690
Bullying tax.

3991
02:45:42,890 --> 02:45:43,910
Yeah, I need that.

3992
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:45,790
Oh, look.

3993
02:45:45,790 --> 02:45:46,770
He already destroyed it.

3994
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:47,850
So, no more rats.

3995
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:49,410
Easy peasy.

3996
02:45:51,390 --> 02:45:52,950
He already destroyed the platform.

3997
02:45:55,490 --> 02:45:56,070
Let's go.

3998
02:45:56,210 --> 02:45:56,950
And it's quite...

3999
02:45:58,250 --> 02:46:00,030
It's quite large, so...

4000
02:46:00,030 --> 02:46:02,130
Like a large area of walking.

4001
02:46:02,450 --> 02:46:03,410
So I think we're good.

4002
02:46:05,310 --> 02:46:06,690
Yeah, it was a lot of guys.

4003
02:46:06,770 --> 02:46:07,990
It was a lot of guys!

4004
02:46:08,610 --> 02:46:10,730
You can't say one guy-ed.

4005
02:46:13,750 --> 02:46:15,210
Don't destroy platform, please.

4006
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:16,030
No more, no more.

4007
02:46:19,900 --> 02:46:21,140
No more, no more.

4008
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:25,040
I got my guns ready.

4009
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:26,600
And by gun, I mean...

4010
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:29,800
This thing?

4011
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:32,680
Actually...

4012
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:33,380
Oh, wait.

4013
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:34,500
I think I can shoot another one.

4014
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:39,720
Close enough.

4015
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:42,000
Okay.

4016
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:42,680
Okay.

4017
02:46:43,900 --> 02:46:44,580
Okay.

4018
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:45,880
Okay.

4019
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:45,900
Um...

4020
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:49,060
Let's...

4021
02:46:49,060 --> 02:46:49,060
Thank you!

4022
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:49,460
Thank you!

4023
02:47:00,490 --> 02:47:03,690
You're not doing me any favors being over there, Mr. Tentacle Man.

4024
02:47:05,550 --> 02:47:06,590
Monster... thingy.

4025
02:47:09,410 --> 02:47:09,930
Nice!

4026
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:19,000
That was close.

4027
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:25,100
I forget that I should...

4028
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:27,260
Dang it!

4029
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:30,480
I always miss the mark there.

4030
02:47:30,700 --> 02:47:32,240
I nearly had that thing dead.

4031
02:47:32,480 --> 02:47:33,640
But then my luck...

4032
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:35,700
It broke apart.

4033
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:38,600
It bro...

4034
02:47:40,120 --> 02:47:42,420
Broke apart as I continued the fight.

4035
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:42,900
Okay.

4036
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:45,500
So I finished it the old fashioned way.

4037
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:46,940
With my fists, baby.

4038
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:49,820
Oh, wait, huh?

4039
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:51,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4040
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:53,060
My fists are not working.

4041
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:57,220
My fists are not working.

4042
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:03,140
My fists are not working.

4043
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:08,780
My fists are not working.

4044
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:09,660
Boss defeated.

4045
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:17,400
Yippee!

4046
02:48:26,820 --> 02:48:28,700
No thanks to you guys.

4047
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:33,660
Boss defeated.

4048
02:48:39,460 --> 02:48:41,700
And I don't have my cool...

4049
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:44,280
My cool flamethrower anymore.

4050
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:47,640
My turquoise lover.

4051
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,520
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

4052
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:50,320
Thank you!

4053
02:48:57,700 --> 02:48:59,020
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

4054
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:00,520
Ooh, ooh.

4055
02:49:00,720 --> 02:49:02,820
This one is not great.

4056
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:03,600
Wait.

4057
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:04,680
This one's really hard.

4058
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:06,740
Um...

4059
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:08,560
What?

4060
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:09,160
What?

4061
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:09,560
What?

4062
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:10,060
What?

4063
02:49:10,060 --> 02:49:10,260
What?

4064
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:10,420
What?

4065
02:49:10,460 --> 02:49:12,480
I have to be like super speed.

4066
02:49:13,660 --> 02:49:14,480
Oh, gosh.

4067
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:28,300
Oh, gosh.

4068
02:49:28,300 --> 02:49:31,140
Mr. Fox, the gallows noose.

4069
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:32,920
Tell me how you got it.

4070
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:33,640
Tell me how you got it.

4071
02:49:33,640 --> 02:49:34,340
I'll tell you later.

4072
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:35,180
Enough.

4073
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:37,020
You've tried my patience, Mr. Fox.

4074
02:49:37,420 --> 02:49:40,320
Tell me right now how you got that damn noose.

4075
02:49:40,500 --> 02:49:40,980
Tell me right now how you got that damn noose.

4076
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:42,940
Or I'll kick your ass and throw you in isolation.

4077
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:44,700
Okay, okay.

4078
02:49:44,980 --> 02:49:46,040
No need for that.

4079
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:48,160
I was just about to tell you.

4080
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:48,740
Yeah, tell me.

4081
02:50:00,040 --> 02:50:00,460
Broccoli?

4082
02:50:06,910 --> 02:50:10,690
I asked Mike, the prison guard, to make a noose so I could hand myself.

4083
02:50:11,410 --> 02:50:14,110
And he brought me one, thinking I would do it.

4084
02:50:14,590 --> 02:50:15,130
That's all.

4085
02:50:15,370 --> 02:50:15,550
What?

4086
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:16,730
What about the broccoli?

4087
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:17,030
Oh.

4088
02:50:17,470 --> 02:50:17,890
Broccoli?

4089
02:50:18,330 --> 02:50:19,530
What are you talking about?

4090
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:21,330
My apologies, Mr. Fox.

4091
02:50:21,550 --> 02:50:23,170
I think I mixed something up.

4092
02:50:23,210 --> 02:50:23,330
Oh.

4093
02:50:23,350 --> 02:50:23,890
Oh, my gosh.

4094
02:50:23,890 --> 02:50:26,730
Is that really- How you got the noose?

4095
02:50:26,830 --> 02:50:27,730
Of course not.

4096
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:29,090
I lied to the officer.

4097
02:50:29,510 --> 02:50:30,570
Now we get it.

4098
02:50:30,810 --> 02:50:34,530
Because no one threatens me to tell the truth.

4099
02:50:35,010 --> 02:50:36,490
How did you really get the noose?

4100
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:37,930
I'll tell you later.

4101
02:50:37,990 --> 02:50:38,670
Oh, my god.

4102
02:50:38,710 --> 02:50:39,450
We'll never know.

4103
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:44,650
Oh, there was a second secret?

4104
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:47,530
We missed it.

4105
02:50:50,110 --> 02:50:52,110
How many chapters are there, by the way?

4106
02:50:52,810 --> 02:50:53,330
Oh.

4107
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:55,150
Oh my gosh!

4108
02:50:55,550 --> 02:50:56,650
Zanzibar Land, for real!

4109
02:51:02,530 --> 02:51:03,330
Oh, nevermind.

4110
02:51:03,470 --> 02:51:04,790
We're not in Zanzibar Land at all.

4111
02:51:10,250 --> 02:51:11,050
A guard!

4112
02:51:12,550 --> 02:51:13,290
Oh, he's asleep.

4113
02:51:22,410 --> 02:51:23,210
Paradise Killer?

4114
02:51:23,610 --> 02:51:24,330
Ever played it?

4115
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:24,910
I haven't.

4116
02:51:27,810 --> 02:51:32,050
Wait, if I break this apart, he's gonna wake up!

4117
02:51:35,970 --> 02:51:37,110
I can't go back.

4118
02:51:37,330 --> 02:51:37,950
Here we go.

4119
02:51:40,670 --> 02:51:41,830
Shh, you didn't hear anything.

4120
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:43,790
You heard nothing.

4121
02:51:44,510 --> 02:51:46,190
You heard absolutely nothing.

4122
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:49,790
Give me whatever you got.

4123
02:51:50,230 --> 02:51:51,470
I'm robbing you.

4124
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:53,090
I'm robbing you blind.

4125
02:52:03,030 --> 02:52:05,850
This place has been ransacked...

4126
02:52:05,850 --> 02:52:07,970
by a spooky...

4127
02:52:08,850 --> 02:52:09,450
ghost!

4128
02:52:11,270 --> 02:52:12,370
There's lunch money.

4129
02:52:12,530 --> 02:52:13,150
Yeah, I took it.

4130
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:15,810
Yeah, I took it.

4131
02:52:16,070 --> 02:52:16,370
In the beginning...

4132
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:18,650
I didn't know exactly where I was.

4133
02:52:18,870 --> 02:52:21,210
But I knew for sure I wasn't outside.

4134
02:52:21,590 --> 02:52:22,030
Are you sure?

4135
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:23,710
Now that I could get a signal...

4136
02:52:23,710 --> 02:52:23,990
Oh!

4137
02:52:24,130 --> 02:52:25,790
Calling the Colonel crossed my mind.

4138
02:52:25,890 --> 02:52:26,110
Yes.

4139
02:52:26,450 --> 02:52:29,170
But I realized I didn't have much to report.

4140
02:52:29,510 --> 02:52:29,710
Oh.

4141
02:52:30,210 --> 02:52:31,290
Speak of the devil.

4142
02:52:32,350 --> 02:52:33,770
Son, do you copy?

4143
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:34,730
Copy, Colonel.

4144
02:52:34,910 --> 02:52:35,510
Are you my dad?

4145
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:36,950
For the love of God, where have you been?

4146
02:52:37,310 --> 02:52:38,510
I thought you were dead.

4147
02:52:38,890 --> 02:52:41,870
As I said, Colonel, there's no signal in the sewers.

4148
02:52:41,970 --> 02:52:42,190
Yeah.

4149
02:52:42,190 --> 02:52:43,690
Give me a SIDREP, son.

4150
02:52:44,090 --> 02:52:44,990
My report.

4151
02:52:45,590 --> 02:52:49,950
After crossing a mile of smelly, mutant-infested shit-streams...

4152
02:52:49,950 --> 02:52:51,990
fighting thousands of rodents...

4153
02:52:51,990 --> 02:52:54,410
and nearly being torn apart by some shredders...

4154
02:52:54,410 --> 02:52:54,830
Yeah?

4155
02:52:54,910 --> 02:52:57,570
I managed to get out of there...

4156
02:52:57,570 --> 02:53:00,870
and I'm still in this fucking military base.

4157
02:53:01,410 --> 02:53:02,810
Don't lose your marbles, son.

4158
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:04,590
You have plenty of night time...

4159
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:05,470
and they don't know you're located...

4160
02:53:05,470 --> 02:53:07,250
Jesse is not as level-headed as Snake.

4161
02:53:07,430 --> 02:53:09,050
and get the hell out of there.

4162
02:53:09,310 --> 02:53:11,090
Just don't forget the documents.

4163
02:53:11,090 --> 02:53:14,130
We need to find out more about Operation Jericho.

4164
02:53:14,230 --> 02:53:15,190
I got it, I got it.

4165
02:53:15,270 --> 02:53:18,690
If I make it out alive, will you write me a recommendation letter?

4166
02:53:19,230 --> 02:53:22,710
If you make it out, we'll give you a damn purple cross.

4167
02:53:23,030 --> 02:53:24,010
Over and out.

4168
02:53:24,210 --> 02:53:26,130
We managed to avoid shredding.

4169
02:53:26,270 --> 02:53:27,590
I have no doubt that the Colonel worked for the government.

4170
02:53:28,030 --> 02:53:28,810
Why is that?

4171
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:29,950
Because.

4172
02:53:30,110 --> 02:53:32,270
The only thing that old bastard did...

4173
02:53:32,270 --> 02:53:33,070
was demand.

4174
02:53:33,690 --> 02:53:34,210
Demand.

4175
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:35,190
Demand.

4176
02:53:35,790 --> 02:53:36,310
Demand.

4177
02:53:36,590 --> 02:53:37,110
Demand.

4178
02:53:37,490 --> 02:53:38,010
Demand.

4179
02:53:38,050 --> 02:53:40,190
Let's see, what about, uh... Mikey?

4180
02:53:40,190 --> 02:53:40,670
Robert.

4181
02:53:41,410 --> 02:53:41,570
Still there?

4182
02:53:41,990 --> 02:53:42,470
Yep.

4183
02:53:42,730 --> 02:53:43,210
Hey.

4184
02:53:43,470 --> 02:53:44,790
How did they catch you?

4185
02:53:44,970 --> 02:53:45,150
Yeah.

4186
02:53:45,310 --> 02:53:47,130
I was in the outskirts of Katsala.

4187
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:49,910
Taking some pictures of a bunch of military trucks.

4188
02:53:50,290 --> 02:53:51,510
There was too much security.

4189
02:53:51,870 --> 02:53:53,510
They were obviously hiding something.

4190
02:53:53,810 --> 02:53:56,210
I couldn't clearly see what they were loading.

4191
02:53:56,350 --> 02:53:57,290
So I got closer.

4192
02:53:57,470 --> 02:53:59,570
Turns out, I got too close.

4193
02:53:59,670 --> 02:54:00,390
You kissed him.

4194
02:54:00,470 --> 02:54:02,750
Next thing you know, I was surrounded by a bunch of pricks.

4195
02:54:02,930 --> 02:54:04,250
Aiming rifles at my head.

4196
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:07,670
Did you at least manage to see what they were loading?

4197
02:54:08,150 --> 02:54:09,210
Sure did, but...

4198
02:54:09,210 --> 02:54:10,010
I was disappointed.

4199
02:54:10,010 --> 02:54:10,090
I was disappointed.

4200
02:54:10,190 --> 02:54:10,270
What?

4201
02:54:10,870 --> 02:54:12,390
It's like a mix of...

4202
02:54:12,390 --> 02:54:13,090
Concrete.

4203
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:15,790
Kazuhiro Miller and, uh...

4204
02:54:15,790 --> 02:54:16,870
An Otacon.

4205
02:54:17,130 --> 02:54:18,410
Two huge rectangular concrete blocks.

4206
02:54:18,730 --> 02:54:20,770
Each could barely fit into a truck.

4207
02:54:21,070 --> 02:54:23,830
You were imprisoned for a piece of concrete?

4208
02:54:24,830 --> 02:54:25,750
Fuck, man.

4209
02:54:26,090 --> 02:54:27,650
I'd be disappointed, too.

4210
02:54:27,930 --> 02:54:30,270
Too much security for something so mundane.

4211
02:54:30,750 --> 02:54:31,850
But enough about me.

4212
02:54:31,970 --> 02:54:33,850
You should get back to your escape, my friend.

4213
02:54:34,530 --> 02:54:35,130
It's...

4214
02:54:37,050 --> 02:54:37,650
It's...

4215
02:54:37,650 --> 02:54:38,970
You know...

4216
02:54:38,970 --> 02:54:40,170
The lion's death.

4217
02:54:40,190 --> 02:54:40,310
Too many Chili Peppers here.

4218
02:54:40,310 --> 02:54:41,230
Man, that's the...

4219
02:54:41,230 --> 02:54:42,830
That kind of concrete, you know?

4220
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:45,430
Alright.

4221
02:54:45,690 --> 02:54:46,990
We emptied our potty.

4222
02:54:48,710 --> 02:54:49,190
Oh!

4223
02:54:49,410 --> 02:54:51,670
We got a second potty!

4224
02:54:53,330 --> 02:54:55,870
This is why you vandalize everything, you guys.

4225
02:54:57,730 --> 02:54:58,870
Vandalism is the way.

4226
02:55:02,250 --> 02:55:03,590
No, we have two potties.

4227
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:07,050
Two potties.

4228
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:07,590
We're thriving.

4229
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:15,620
Exit!

4230
02:55:15,620 --> 02:55:17,440
That surely is the real exit.

4231
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:19,360
Okay, I'll bring you guys back on screen again.

4232
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:20,980
Sorry, I forgot to.

4233
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:24,040
You guys are welcome back.

4234
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:25,120
You guys are welcome back.

4235
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:26,800
As long as you behave, you know?

4236
02:55:33,350 --> 02:55:34,430
Now you did.

4237
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:39,390
Oh dang it, he caught me though.

4238
02:55:42,610 --> 02:55:44,370
Ugh, he caught me.

4239
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:50,750
She likes us.

4240
02:55:51,510 --> 02:55:52,570
She loves us.

4241
02:55:52,650 --> 02:55:54,050
I'm tolerating it.

4242
02:55:54,090 --> 02:55:55,050
She tolerates us.

4243
02:55:55,670 --> 02:55:57,150
That's why you vandalize everything.

4244
02:55:57,610 --> 02:55:58,610
Vandalism is the way.

4245
02:55:58,710 --> 02:56:00,230
This has got to be the exit.

4246
02:56:03,610 --> 02:56:05,410
That looks like an exit to me.

4247
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:12,080
Oh, I think we should go through the exit.

4248
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:13,480
I think I think.

4249
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:20,300
What?

4250
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:23,120
Oh, is it because he noticed me?

4251
02:56:23,320 --> 02:56:26,560
Oh man, I thought I was going to take care of the job.

4252
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:28,080
There it was.

4253
02:56:28,360 --> 02:56:29,360
The exit.

4254
02:56:29,460 --> 02:56:30,900
Oh my god, I'm leaving with my new pet.

4255
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:32,980
Sergeant Roscoe's security card didn't open the door.

4256
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:37,340
So I had to search for someone who would lend it to me.

4257
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:37,760
Oh.

4258
02:56:39,480 --> 02:56:39,940
Okay.

4259
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:42,680
Good night.

4260
02:56:46,220 --> 02:56:46,680
Let's...

4261
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:55,020
Let's see.

4262
02:57:05,350 --> 02:57:05,730
Let's see.

4263
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:08,490
Pick him up.

4264
02:57:08,550 --> 02:57:09,010
Pick him up.

4265
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:09,570
Pick him up.

4266
02:57:09,630 --> 02:57:10,210
Oh shoot.

4267
02:57:10,550 --> 02:57:11,730
I need you to pick him up, please.

4268
02:57:16,470 --> 02:57:16,790
Oh,

4269
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:21,720
it doesn't really matter if we get experience.

4270
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:26,360
Oh, my experience.

4271
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:33,340
Oh, my experience.

4272
02:57:33,340 --> 02:57:33,980
How did you miss?

4273
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:34,420
I don't know.

4274
02:57:34,420 --> 02:57:35,100
That's the game.

4275
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:42,880
There, right in front of me, was the sickbay.

4276
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,140
We're going to see a hot girl in there.

4277
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:46,380
Walking through that door changed everything forever.

4278
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:47,000
Oh, yeah?

4279
02:57:48,500 --> 02:57:49,380
What's going to change?

4280
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:54,320
It's him.

4281
02:57:55,080 --> 02:57:56,900
It's the prisoner that hit us.

4282
02:57:57,640 --> 02:58:01,460
It turned out that all the guards I knocked out were brought to the sickbay.

4283
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:03,840
And some were still there.

4284
02:58:04,060 --> 02:58:04,560
Oh, my god.

4285
02:58:06,460 --> 02:58:07,800
Don't move or I'll shoot.

4286
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:09,280
How was I right about a hot lady?

4287
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:10,140
I surrender.

4288
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:13,440
The woman that was aiming at me was the doctor.

4289
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:14,420
Oh, yeah.

4290
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:19,800
She, of course, was very pissed off because of the copious amount of work I caused.

4291
02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:21,560
What a face.

4292
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:23,680
What a body.

4293
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:25,500
What a beauty.

4294
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:27,540
Are we explaining this to our girlfriend?

4295
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:30,100
This girl was smoking hot.

4296
02:58:30,680 --> 02:58:33,700
She had a gun straight at my head.

4297
02:58:33,960 --> 02:58:34,640
Oh, yeah.

4298
02:58:34,940 --> 02:58:38,400
At that distance, I couldn't do anything to neutralize her.

4299
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:39,800
I had to improvise.

4300
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:40,660
Dance, dance.

4301
02:58:41,080 --> 02:58:43,920
I needed something that would cause a non-lethal wound.

4302
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:45,720
Like a sharp piece of metal.

4303
02:58:45,900 --> 02:58:49,100
But I had to grab it without making a single step.

4304
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:49,420
Oh.

4305
02:58:52,180 --> 02:58:53,840
What do I have?

4306
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:54,220
Oh.

4307
02:58:54,700 --> 02:58:56,120
We have a glass eye.

4308
02:58:57,060 --> 02:58:57,660
Use.

4309
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:02,280
It wasn't wise to use weapons there.

4310
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:02,760
Oh, okay.

4311
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:03,100
Just kidding.

4312
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:04,220
I can't shoot her.

4313
02:59:06,980 --> 02:59:08,180
Raw meat.

4314
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:14,680
Oh, wait.

4315
02:59:15,100 --> 02:59:18,140
Combine with the handkerchief.

4316
02:59:18,140 --> 02:59:19,700
And then combine.

4317
02:59:23,060 --> 02:59:27,020
Combine this with the gasoline.

4318
02:59:27,940 --> 02:59:28,700
Correct.

4319
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:31,520
Combine again.

4320
02:59:31,900 --> 02:59:34,040
And then select that.

4321
02:59:34,340 --> 02:59:35,620
And then use it.

4322
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:39,820
It wasn't wise to use weapons there.

4323
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:40,420
Dang it.

4324
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:47,320
The coin.

4325
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:47,400
The coin.

4326
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:48,380
How could I forget?

4327
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:49,320
Oh, wait.

4328
02:59:49,360 --> 02:59:49,760
Knock on mine.

4329
02:59:49,860 --> 02:59:50,280
Sorry.

4330
02:59:54,830 --> 02:59:55,730
Throw the coin.

4331
02:59:59,260 --> 02:59:59,700
Oh.

4332
03:00:01,220 --> 03:00:02,220
She doesn't want that?

4333
03:00:03,260 --> 03:00:03,700
Um.

4334
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:07,940
The ring?

4335
03:00:09,020 --> 03:00:11,780
But what if maybe she's like, wait, why do you have these documents?

4336
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:14,660
The first file was about an attack plan.

4337
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:17,300
Its code name was Operation Jericho.

4338
03:00:17,320 --> 03:00:17,400
Oh.

4339
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:18,500
We already listened to this.

4340
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:18,980
Um.

4341
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:21,320
Oh.

4342
03:00:21,320 --> 03:00:21,480
Oh.

4343
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:21,840
So it's an attack plan?

4344
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:26,640
Have you ever had a gun pointed at you?

4345
03:00:26,960 --> 03:00:28,960
Your adrenaline skyrockets.

4346
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:30,840
You react on instinct.

4347
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:35,020
Everything happened so fast that the doctor had no time to react.

4348
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:41,640
In one swift movement, I took the wire, looked deep within the doctor's eyes, and, took her eyes.

4349
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:54,370
Guys, this is, this is a really hard decision.

4350
03:00:54,750 --> 03:00:55,350
Oh.

4351
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:08,280
But we're trying not to kill her, right?

4352
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:12,380
If we do it, if we grab her chest, then she'll... she'll die.

4353
03:01:15,560 --> 03:01:18,840
If we do her thighs, she'll just have tetanus.

4354
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:24,400
Her belly?

4355
03:01:25,220 --> 03:01:26,520
I think she'll also die.

4356
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:28,740
Let's go for the thighs.

4357
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:31,440
I stuck it in my thigh.

4358
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:34,220
What the hell did you just do?

4359
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:36,500
I just hurt myself.

4360
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:38,980
Are you nuts or what?

4361
03:01:39,220 --> 03:01:40,960
Now you can't shoot me.

4362
03:01:41,120 --> 03:01:42,320
What do you mean?

4363
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:44,360
You just made it easier for me.

4364
03:01:44,780 --> 03:01:47,880
According to the degree on your wall, you're a doctor.

4365
03:01:48,420 --> 03:01:54,240
The Hippocratic Oath you took as a doctor forces you to aid your patients.

4366
03:01:54,820 --> 03:01:58,380
And also forces you to cause patients no harm.

4367
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:01,040
I've been injured in a sickbay.

4368
03:02:01,240 --> 03:02:02,740
Your sickbay.

4369
03:02:03,100 --> 03:02:06,060
Therefore, I'm now your patient.

4370
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:08,580
What if I'm forced to assist you?

4371
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:09,720
You bastard!

4372
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:12,620
Yeah, been called that plenty of times.

4373
03:02:13,220 --> 03:02:15,160
By the way, I'm bleeding.

4374
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:16,500
Fine.

4375
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:17,940
I'll heal you.

4376
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:20,440
Then you get the hell out of here.

4377
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,400
It hurts.

4378
03:02:22,600 --> 03:02:23,100
Ouch.

4379
03:02:23,960 --> 03:02:24,740
You're done.

4380
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:26,620
It's no longer bleeding.

4381
03:02:26,780 --> 03:02:27,420
Oh wow, that was so fast.

4382
03:02:27,460 --> 03:02:28,000
Thank you, doctor.

4383
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:29,380
You're welcome.

4384
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:30,220
She's so competent.

4385
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:34,080
Hey, what was that for?

4386
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:36,280
That's for all the extra hours.

4387
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:38,360
I'm working because of you.

4388
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:41,540
It's just as well that you didn't kill anyone.

4389
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:42,780
Kill someone?

4390
03:02:43,100 --> 03:02:43,540
Me?

4391
03:02:44,020 --> 03:02:45,960
Do I look like an assassin?

4392
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:50,460
After arguing for a while, the doctor and I reached an understanding.

4393
03:02:50,800 --> 03:02:52,380
I would not kill anyone.

4394
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:54,060
And she would help me escape.

4395
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:55,760
I haven't killed anybody, okay?

4396
03:02:56,680 --> 03:02:57,240
Oh.

4397
03:02:58,740 --> 03:03:00,180
There are first aid kits in the closet.

4398
03:03:00,380 --> 03:03:01,100
Take some.

4399
03:03:01,260 --> 03:03:05,020
If you shoot someone, use them so they don't bleed to death.

4400
03:03:05,180 --> 03:03:05,260
Oh.

4401
03:03:07,580 --> 03:03:08,460
That's fun.

4402
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:10,900
I can still shoot my...

4403
03:03:13,860 --> 03:03:15,820
Quit your yapping.

4404
03:03:16,820 --> 03:03:17,420
It

4405
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:21,200
hurts.

4406
03:03:23,060 --> 03:03:24,500
Don't speak, Mike.

4407
03:03:24,680 --> 03:03:25,960
You have a broken jaw.

4408
03:03:26,200 --> 03:03:27,160
Oh, Mike, no.

4409
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:32,160
Try to get some sleep.

4410
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:32,960
Oh.

4411
03:03:33,580 --> 03:03:34,180
Oh.

4412
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:34,740
Oh.

4413
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:42,580
Oh, sorry.

4414
03:03:42,640 --> 03:03:45,180
You couldn't just take the card from the pocket?

4415
03:03:45,400 --> 03:03:46,040
No, I'm...

4416
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:48,060
Just kill or be killed.

4417
03:03:49,740 --> 03:03:51,880
My sight's still fuzzy, doctor.

4418
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:53,280
As expected.

4419
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:55,040
You got hit pretty hard.

4420
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:56,120
I wonder by who.

4421
03:03:56,180 --> 03:03:57,240
It looks like your eyes will recover.

4422
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:00,440
I had a doctor.

4423
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:02,380
Doctor?

4424
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:04,340
Hurrah.

4425
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,500
It's a good thing I'm such a tip...

4426
03:04:08,500 --> 03:04:08,820
Watch out!

4427
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:11,680
Most instruments don't respond well to punches.

4428
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:13,860
Sorry.

4429
03:04:14,020 --> 03:04:15,080
It's kill or be killed.

4430
03:04:16,340 --> 03:04:16,960
Bye-bye.

4431
03:04:18,680 --> 03:04:19,560
Thanks, doc.

4432
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:27,600
Oh, we still don't have...

4433
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:28,820
So this is a red key.

4434
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:30,380
We still don't have the yellow key.

4435
03:04:31,880 --> 03:04:33,680
That was the one that, um...

4436
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:35,780
We needed earlier.

4437
03:04:38,580 --> 03:04:40,620
Yeah, I'm just breaking everything first.

4438
03:04:41,720 --> 03:04:42,200
Oh!

4439
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:43,060
I got some...

4440
03:04:43,060 --> 03:04:44,140
Oh, wait.

4441
03:04:44,220 --> 03:04:45,600
I got some actual bullets.

4442
03:04:46,460 --> 03:04:48,380
Wait, we're gonna get a gun for real?

4443
03:04:49,360 --> 03:04:51,680
We're gonna actually be able to commit real crimes?

4444
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:54,820
I finally had a gun.

4445
03:04:55,140 --> 03:04:57,080
Now I could kill those guards.

4446
03:04:57,160 --> 03:04:58,220
Wait, but I'm not allowed to kill.

4447
03:04:58,340 --> 03:04:58,480
That is...

4448
03:04:58,480 --> 03:05:02,500
If I were an assassin and didn't promise the doctor I wouldn't murder anyone.

4449
03:05:02,500 --> 03:05:03,960
So thanks for the 50 gift cards!

4450
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:08,740
So if I shot someone, I had to use a first aid kit to heal them before they bled to death.

4451
03:05:09,240 --> 03:05:11,860
CQC is probably the best way to do it, right?

4452
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:12,880
Of course not.

4453
03:05:13,100 --> 03:05:14,160
I'm not an assassin.

4454
03:05:14,520 --> 03:05:14,880
Uh-uh.

4455
03:05:15,060 --> 03:05:18,400
The gun I found was empty, but it had a 10-bullet magazine.

4456
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:19,360
Nice.

4457
03:05:19,380 --> 03:05:21,960
So I loaded it up with any bullets I found.

4458
03:05:22,020 --> 03:05:22,780
Which were a lot.

4459
03:05:23,720 --> 03:05:25,440
Press R to reload the gun.

4460
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:28,620
...

4461
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:33,880
I'm guessing it's space.

4462
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:35,620
But it's also...

4463
03:05:36,620 --> 03:05:39,540
It also doesn't have a suppressor.

4464
03:05:39,640 --> 03:05:40,100
So...

4465
03:05:41,860 --> 03:05:43,100
I think...

4466
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:46,780
It'll be loud.

4467
03:05:47,720 --> 03:05:49,080
Doc, what's the diagnosis?

4468
03:05:49,580 --> 03:05:55,420
It's not about the sickness we're given, but it's what we tweet with the time we have.

4469
03:05:56,640 --> 03:05:58,100
Doc, my brain rot.

4470
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:02,080
Please tell me.

4471
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:04,280
Please tell me.

4472
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:05,480
Lord of the bullets.

4473
03:06:06,060 --> 03:06:06,920
Lord of the bullets.

4474
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:08,400
What's this guy doing, huh?

4475
03:06:09,720 --> 03:06:11,980
What's this guy doing walking around?

4476
03:06:12,800 --> 03:06:12,840
What's this guy doing walking around?

4477
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:13,980
Silly ears.

4478
03:06:15,020 --> 03:06:16,660
I shot a guard.

4479
03:06:16,740 --> 03:06:17,420
I'm sorry!

4480
03:06:17,820 --> 03:06:18,660
I couldn't let him die.

4481
03:06:18,940 --> 03:06:20,460
I promised it to the doctor.

4482
03:06:21,240 --> 03:06:24,080
I had to heal him before bleeding to death.

4483
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:25,080
I'm sorry!

4484
03:06:25,080 --> 03:06:26,060
So I got close.

4485
03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:28,260
And I used one of my first aid kits.

4486
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:32,300
Oh, see?

4487
03:06:37,700 --> 03:06:38,380
You're welcome.

4488
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:39,840
Sorry, I was...

4489
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:42,640
Trying to loot him at the same time.

4490
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:44,100
Okay, let's go get another...

4491
03:06:44,100 --> 03:06:46,240
Let's go grab that one from the...

4492
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:47,820
From the cabinet, right?

4493
03:06:48,100 --> 03:06:49,240
What a bunch.

4494
03:06:50,840 --> 03:06:51,760
Falcon, bye!

4495
03:06:51,760 --> 03:06:51,940
Bye!

4496
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:54,800
I think I instinct...

4497
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:58,000
Because of the rat level, I'm instinctually impressing space now.

4498
03:06:58,200 --> 03:06:58,380
You know?

4499
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:00,200
Still hurts.

4500
03:07:00,940 --> 03:07:02,220
Everything is blurry.

4501
03:07:02,480 --> 03:07:03,540
Doc, don't mind me.

4502
03:07:03,780 --> 03:07:04,760
Bastard, it's hard.

4503
03:07:05,260 --> 03:07:06,280
Rest some more.

4504
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:07,920
I'll check back soon.

4505
03:07:08,380 --> 03:07:09,500
Point blank.

4506
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:13,100
Yeah, you know.

4507
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:17,260
Maybe I should unequip the gun.

4508
03:07:18,500 --> 03:07:21,820
Yeah, maybe we'll just go back to our little uranium bombs.

4509
03:07:22,460 --> 03:07:23,280
I mean...

4510
03:07:23,280 --> 03:07:24,780
Uranium bullets.

4511
03:07:28,400 --> 03:07:30,020
They seemed a little healthier.

4512
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:33,100
You know?

4513
03:07:44,210 --> 03:07:45,110
He's looking around.

4514
03:07:46,250 --> 03:07:47,570
He's being a good guard.

4515
03:07:47,810 --> 03:07:50,530
This guy is doing the most guarding job I've ever seen.

4516
03:07:51,250 --> 03:07:52,210
Such a guard.

4517
03:07:53,790 --> 03:07:54,470
Such a good guard.

4518
03:08:00,930 --> 03:08:01,550
Yippee!

4519
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:03,930
More bullets!

4520
03:08:04,470 --> 03:08:07,030
I mean, the game is just...

4521
03:08:07,030 --> 03:08:12,570
The game is basically telling me that I should be a murderer.

4522
03:08:14,470 --> 03:08:15,310
I think.

4523
03:08:15,530 --> 03:08:16,350
What is this?

4524
03:08:17,230 --> 03:08:18,350
This is Jesse Fox.

4525
03:08:18,730 --> 03:08:19,130
Over.

4526
03:08:19,290 --> 03:08:20,610
This is the doctor.

4527
03:08:20,770 --> 03:08:21,230
Over.

4528
03:08:22,310 --> 03:08:22,930
Oh!

4529
03:08:23,090 --> 03:08:24,730
How did she get my number?

4530
03:08:24,730 --> 03:08:27,930
Police officer of Jesse Fox sent you a message.

4531
03:08:28,050 --> 03:08:29,110
What are you talking about?

4532
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:31,970
Well, my access card won't work.

4533
03:08:32,270 --> 03:08:33,890
It's only clearance level two.

4534
03:08:34,190 --> 03:08:36,590
Leaving the building requires level three clearance.

4535
03:08:37,150 --> 03:08:38,430
Where would I find that?

4536
03:08:39,170 --> 03:08:40,550
The officers would have them.

4537
03:08:40,710 --> 03:08:42,590
Their offices are on the third floor.

4538
03:08:43,190 --> 03:08:43,490
Wow.

4539
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:44,750
Thanks for the help.

4540
03:08:44,970 --> 03:08:46,610
I didn't know you cared about me.

4541
03:08:46,610 --> 03:08:47,470
She cares about me.

4542
03:08:47,510 --> 03:08:50,510
What I care about is that you leave ASAP so I stop getting so many patients.

4543
03:08:50,750 --> 03:08:50,850
Oh.

4544
03:08:50,850 --> 03:08:53,010
By the way, what's your name?

4545
03:08:53,150 --> 03:08:53,450
Oh, yeah.

4546
03:08:53,570 --> 03:08:54,570
My name is Doctor.

4547
03:08:54,770 --> 03:08:55,590
Over and out.

4548
03:08:56,450 --> 03:08:57,510
Oh, Doctor.

4549
03:08:57,770 --> 03:08:58,270
Doctor.

4550
03:09:02,070 --> 03:09:03,330
I like her.

4551
03:09:03,510 --> 03:09:04,510
Oh, hold on.

4552
03:09:04,630 --> 03:09:04,890
Colonel.

4553
03:09:05,170 --> 03:09:05,410
Colonel.

4554
03:09:05,730 --> 03:09:08,210
Do you have what you need to leave?

4555
03:09:08,810 --> 03:09:09,910
Not yet, Colonel.

4556
03:09:10,110 --> 03:09:12,830
But a contact told me where to find an access card.

4557
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:14,730
A Metal Gear reference?

4558
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:15,390
Yes.

4559
03:09:15,390 --> 03:09:16,270
A doctor.

4560
03:09:16,770 --> 03:09:17,510
A doctor.

4561
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:19,070
Give me a description.

4562
03:09:19,470 --> 03:09:19,850
Hot.

4563
03:09:20,850 --> 03:09:21,370
Smoking hot.

4564
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:23,470
Oh, for God's sake.

4565
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:25,250
Control your hormones, son.

4566
03:09:25,550 --> 03:09:28,190
We're in the middle of a very serious operation.

4567
03:09:28,190 --> 03:09:31,090
You and that libido of yours.

4568
03:09:31,110 --> 03:09:31,450
Listen, Colonel.

4569
03:09:31,450 --> 03:09:31,450
Make no mistake.

4570
03:09:31,450 --> 03:09:33,610
I'm not in any operation of yours.

4571
03:09:33,810 --> 03:09:35,370
Maybe I am, Jesse Fox.

4572
03:09:35,370 --> 03:09:35,690
Or Miami of your soldiers.

4573
03:09:36,370 --> 03:09:40,070
I'm only trying to escape from this damn place.

4574
03:09:40,730 --> 03:09:41,870
Damn it, Jess.

4575
03:09:41,970 --> 03:09:44,610
Don't you realize this isn't an escape, son?

4576
03:09:45,470 --> 03:09:47,450
Yeah, it's overactive libido.

4577
03:09:47,910 --> 03:09:50,570
Could end up with countless casualties.

4578
03:09:50,570 --> 03:09:50,830
Yeah, it's overactive libido.

4579
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:55,250
And it's your moral duty as a citizen to prevent it.

4580
03:09:55,250 --> 03:09:55,650
A citizen?

4581
03:09:55,970 --> 03:09:57,650
I'm just a normal guy, maybe.

4582
03:09:57,870 --> 03:09:57,950
Me?

4583
03:09:58,330 --> 03:09:59,490
Is that a joke?

4584
03:10:00,050 --> 03:10:00,770
Yes, you.

4585
03:10:01,350 --> 03:10:03,510
Search every damn office in that building.

4586
03:10:03,870 --> 03:10:06,170
For any information you can prevent.

4587
03:10:06,390 --> 03:10:07,850
That damn plan.

4588
03:10:08,310 --> 03:10:09,150
Over and out.

4589
03:10:09,190 --> 03:10:11,310
Okay, well what are you doing on your end then, Colonel?

4590
03:10:11,390 --> 03:10:12,690
Oh my gosh, wait, this is an elevator.

4591
03:10:13,310 --> 03:10:14,930
Robert, do you copy?

4592
03:10:15,430 --> 03:10:15,810
You!

4593
03:10:16,150 --> 03:10:18,330
I think I just fell in love.

4594
03:10:18,330 --> 03:10:19,750
Wow, seriously?

4595
03:10:20,450 --> 03:10:21,590
Give me the deets.

4596
03:10:21,890 --> 03:10:23,190
I just met a woman.

4597
03:10:23,650 --> 03:10:24,790
Fuck, what a woman.

4598
03:10:24,870 --> 03:10:28,230
And wait, did you fall in love with her or just her buddy?

4599
03:10:28,870 --> 03:10:29,350
Both.

4600
03:10:29,910 --> 03:10:30,230
Hmm.

4601
03:10:30,990 --> 03:10:31,590
She hot?

4602
03:10:31,830 --> 03:10:32,410
Oh yeah.

4603
03:10:32,630 --> 03:10:34,190
You only knew, Robert.

4604
03:10:34,330 --> 03:10:37,350
I swear, she's everything I've been searching for.

4605
03:10:37,570 --> 03:10:37,890
Wow.

4606
03:10:38,030 --> 03:10:39,730
I thought you were searching for a way out.

4607
03:10:40,650 --> 03:10:41,930
I need to move.

4608
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,310
I'll tell you more later.

4609
03:10:43,450 --> 03:10:44,130
Over and out.

4610
03:10:44,610 --> 03:10:45,790
He's like kicking his feet.

4611
03:10:45,830 --> 03:10:48,090
He's like laying on the ground, like on his belly.

4612
03:10:48,330 --> 03:10:49,370
He's like feet in the air.

4613
03:10:49,490 --> 03:10:50,690
And he's like twirling his hair.

4614
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:51,870
And he's just like, oh my gosh, Robert.

4615
03:10:53,250 --> 03:10:54,090
Robert, I'm in love.

4616
03:10:55,270 --> 03:10:56,850
She said the third floor, right?

4617
03:10:57,190 --> 03:10:57,730
Hold on.

4618
03:11:01,510 --> 03:11:02,230
What was it?

4619
03:11:02,250 --> 03:11:02,870
Was it tab?

4620
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:03,230
Oh, here.

4621
03:11:03,430 --> 03:11:05,230
Search the officer's office on the third floor.

4622
03:11:05,310 --> 03:11:05,590
Okay, yeah.

4623
03:11:07,350 --> 03:11:09,130
But before we go up...

4624
03:11:10,170 --> 03:11:10,950
What's over here?

4625
03:11:11,530 --> 03:11:12,510
Look at these pals.

4626
03:11:13,730 --> 03:11:14,970
They're doing their job together.

4627
03:11:19,430 --> 03:11:19,790
Hmm.

4628
03:11:21,170 --> 03:11:23,950
Which guy should I take out first?

4629
03:11:24,230 --> 03:11:26,230
Probably this one.

4630
03:11:30,270 --> 03:11:30,850
Nope.

4631
03:11:30,950 --> 03:11:31,710
No alert.

4632
03:11:32,250 --> 03:11:32,970
Dang it.

4633
03:11:33,090 --> 03:11:35,390
That guy caught me a little bit, but...

4634
03:11:36,020 --> 03:11:36,490
You know.

4635
03:11:37,330 --> 03:11:38,050
That's okay.

4636
03:11:38,490 --> 03:11:39,570
What's in the lockers?

4637
03:11:39,870 --> 03:11:41,190
Any nerds in here?

4638
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:42,990
Pissy boys?

4639
03:11:43,370 --> 03:11:43,830
Nope.

4640
03:11:43,930 --> 03:11:44,330
Okay.

4641
03:11:46,250 --> 03:11:46,830
Mike!

4642
03:11:46,830 --> 03:11:49,750
They're all so concerned about each other.

4643
03:11:49,830 --> 03:11:50,430
It's so funny.

4644
03:11:51,590 --> 03:11:52,590
What's in here?

4645
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:53,150
Ooh!

4646
03:11:53,570 --> 03:11:55,590
This room looks important.

4647
03:11:56,830 --> 03:11:57,590
Aha.

4648
03:11:58,490 --> 03:11:59,490
Oh yes.

4649
03:12:00,330 --> 03:12:01,970
Yes, very important.

4650
03:12:02,490 --> 03:12:03,250
Information.

4651
03:12:06,970 --> 03:12:07,730
Files!

4652
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:09,550
I got more files.

4653
03:12:12,610 --> 03:12:12,990
Nice.

4654
03:12:13,150 --> 03:12:13,650
Okay.

4655
03:12:17,150 --> 03:12:18,010
The lore?

4656
03:12:19,630 --> 03:12:20,110
Yes.

4657
03:12:20,330 --> 03:12:20,710
Okay, good.

4658
03:12:20,870 --> 03:12:24,850
Before leaving the office, I called Harris to let him know that I found the files.

4659
03:12:24,910 --> 03:12:25,650
More files?

4660
03:12:25,950 --> 03:12:26,590
Thank you, thank you.

4661
03:12:26,890 --> 03:12:31,450
You really are just beating up dudes on their 9 to 5 guard jobs.

4662
03:12:31,590 --> 03:12:32,870
I mean, it wasn't that Metal Gear 2?

4663
03:12:33,430 --> 03:12:35,030
Colonel, do you copy?

4664
03:12:35,490 --> 03:12:35,930
Copy.

4665
03:12:36,250 --> 03:12:37,610
I found more documents.

4666
03:12:37,950 --> 03:12:38,110
Yep.

4667
03:12:38,310 --> 03:12:39,510
They look like...

4668
03:12:39,510 --> 03:12:41,670
A list of coordinates.

4669
03:12:42,090 --> 03:12:42,570
Coordinates?

4670
03:12:42,950 --> 03:12:43,950
Coordinates of what?

4671
03:12:43,950 --> 03:12:46,430
This document is encoded as well.

4672
03:12:46,630 --> 03:12:48,670
I don't know what the coordinates are for.

4673
03:12:49,430 --> 03:12:49,950
Coordinates?

4674
03:12:50,310 --> 03:12:51,570
It could be strike targets.

4675
03:12:51,810 --> 03:12:52,270
Dun dun!

4676
03:12:52,410 --> 03:12:54,870
Those bastards could be planning to attack us.

4677
03:12:54,970 --> 03:12:55,510
Oh my god!

4678
03:12:57,570 --> 03:12:58,810
What do you think, Robert?

4679
03:12:59,030 --> 03:12:59,370
Jesse here.

4680
03:12:59,650 --> 03:13:00,390
Do you copy?

4681
03:13:00,790 --> 03:13:01,550
I hear you.

4682
03:13:01,890 --> 03:13:04,850
I was thinking about those big concrete blocks you saw.

4683
03:13:04,970 --> 03:13:05,270
Oh yeah.

4684
03:13:05,590 --> 03:13:07,370
This place is full of concrete buildings.

4685
03:13:07,710 --> 03:13:09,030
Maybe they're building something.

4686
03:13:09,630 --> 03:13:10,650
Something new.

4687
03:13:10,750 --> 03:13:12,810
Something that requires a lot of concrete.

4688
03:13:13,950 --> 03:13:14,710
Why are there so many guards?

4689
03:13:15,290 --> 03:13:17,130
Why are they transporting concrete?

4690
03:13:17,130 --> 03:13:18,550
I was hoping you would play this since it came out.

4691
03:13:19,710 --> 03:13:23,450
Maybe someone sold them something in parts and they're just bringing them here.

4692
03:13:24,330 --> 03:13:25,290
Could be.

4693
03:13:25,630 --> 03:13:26,390
But what?

4694
03:13:27,690 --> 03:13:28,650
Concrete gear?

4695
03:13:29,630 --> 03:13:30,410
Thanks man.

4696
03:13:30,690 --> 03:13:31,470
Over and out.

4697
03:13:31,790 --> 03:13:32,270
No.

4698
03:13:32,550 --> 03:13:33,330
You guys.

4699
03:13:33,490 --> 03:13:35,670
There's no concrete gear.

4700
03:13:44,420 --> 03:13:46,560
It's like a concrete Gundam.

4701
03:13:48,840 --> 03:13:49,800
Concrete Gundam.

4702
03:13:50,640 --> 03:13:51,800
A condom.

4703
03:14:09,030 --> 03:14:10,190
You guys laughed.

4704
03:14:10,490 --> 03:14:11,550
You guys laughed.

4705
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:18,450
Let's go to the third floor.

4706
03:14:20,450 --> 03:14:21,030
X.

4707
03:14:24,090 --> 03:14:25,410
I did laugh.

4708
03:14:26,810 --> 03:14:27,390
Wait.

4709
03:14:27,470 --> 03:14:29,850
If we go down down, how down can we go?

4710
03:14:30,990 --> 03:14:31,570
F1?

4711
03:14:32,430 --> 03:14:33,610
Can we go any further?

4712
03:14:33,970 --> 03:14:34,050
No.

4713
03:14:34,090 --> 03:14:34,270
Okay.

4714
03:14:34,610 --> 03:14:35,550
This is F2.

4715
03:14:36,450 --> 03:14:37,330
Good one, Minto.

4716
03:14:37,470 --> 03:14:37,870
Thanks.

4717
03:14:38,810 --> 03:14:40,190
I thought it was pretty good.

4718
03:14:40,290 --> 03:14:40,830
I'm not gonna lie.

4719
03:14:42,850 --> 03:14:45,050
Whatever is down there is going real fast.

4720
03:14:47,510 --> 03:14:49,850
Oh my gosh.

4721
03:14:49,970 --> 03:14:51,290
This is...

4722
03:14:51,290 --> 03:14:51,650
Wait.

4723
03:14:51,730 --> 03:14:52,650
This is literally...

4724
03:14:54,810 --> 03:14:55,730
Wait a second.

4725
03:14:55,810 --> 03:14:57,850
This is literally Metal Gear.

4726
03:14:58,630 --> 03:14:59,830
Not Metal Gear Solid.

4727
03:15:00,030 --> 03:15:00,730
Metal Gear.

4728
03:15:01,510 --> 03:15:02,490
Good one, Minto.

4729
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:02,970
Thanks.

4730
03:15:04,730 --> 03:15:05,990
Glad you guys liked it.

4731
03:15:07,230 --> 03:15:08,470
I'm bleeding out.

4732
03:15:08,750 --> 03:15:08,970
No.

4733
03:15:12,310 --> 03:15:14,390
Let's go to the infirmary.

4734
03:15:18,610 --> 03:15:19,130
Meow.

4735
03:15:19,230 --> 03:15:19,730
Meow.

4736
03:15:19,990 --> 03:15:20,490
Meow.

4737
03:15:20,650 --> 03:15:20,950
Meow.

4738
03:15:21,790 --> 03:15:22,310
Okay.

4739
03:15:22,430 --> 03:15:23,650
So it saves at each floor.

4740
03:15:23,930 --> 03:15:24,810
Good to know.

4741
03:15:25,710 --> 03:15:28,590
Let's go grab a little health kit before we...

4742
03:15:30,390 --> 03:15:30,930
Um...

4743
03:15:30,930 --> 03:15:31,470
Onwards.

4744
03:15:35,430 --> 03:15:38,550
There's no doors that we saw that required a level 2.

4745
03:15:38,630 --> 03:15:38,910
Right?

4746
03:15:39,530 --> 03:15:40,690
I don't think so.

4747
03:15:42,110 --> 03:15:44,550
I could spoil their plan, but I don't have any...

4748
03:15:45,850 --> 03:15:46,390
concrete...

4749
03:15:46,390 --> 03:15:47,210
answers.

4750
03:15:47,530 --> 03:15:48,130
Oh, excuse me.

4751
03:15:48,190 --> 03:15:48,810
Thank you.

4752
03:15:54,010 --> 03:15:54,950
Concrete answers.

4753
03:15:56,390 --> 03:15:57,470
Concrete answers.

4754
03:16:00,570 --> 03:16:01,330
Good one.

4755
03:16:03,090 --> 03:16:03,650
Okay.

4756
03:16:03,790 --> 03:16:04,290
Okay.

4757
03:16:12,270 --> 03:16:12,950
Let's go.

4758
03:16:14,350 --> 03:16:19,250
Let's go explore floor 3 because floor 2 is evil.

4759
03:16:19,390 --> 03:16:20,690
I hope we never go there.

4760
03:16:23,670 --> 03:16:24,490
Floor 3.

4761
03:16:26,310 --> 03:16:27,570
Floor 2 is evil.

4762
03:16:27,570 --> 03:16:29,110
We will not come back.

4763
03:16:31,510 --> 03:16:32,050
Alright.

4764
03:16:32,190 --> 03:16:32,910
Save the game.

4765
03:16:34,070 --> 03:16:34,610
Cool.

4766
03:16:35,610 --> 03:16:36,910
What's going on in here?

4767
03:16:37,510 --> 03:16:39,130
We need a level 3 card.

4768
03:16:39,630 --> 03:16:39,990
Okay.

4769
03:16:44,990 --> 03:16:45,710
Thermal sensors.

4770
03:16:46,110 --> 03:16:46,710
Yeah, lasers.

4771
03:16:46,950 --> 03:16:49,850
Those thermal sensors had a detection angle of 90 degrees.

4772
03:16:50,450 --> 03:16:53,990
And it would sense the heat of my body like the predator.

4773
03:16:54,570 --> 03:16:58,830
They obviously wouldn't detect through the tall brown boxes in the facility.

4774
03:16:59,210 --> 03:16:59,410
Yeah.

4775
03:16:59,630 --> 03:17:03,090
So I could hide from them like how I've been sneaking around the guards.

4776
03:17:03,410 --> 03:17:03,670
Yeah.

4777
03:17:03,950 --> 03:17:05,690
But the containers weren't everywhere.

4778
03:17:06,010 --> 03:17:06,330
Yeah.

4779
03:17:06,630 --> 03:17:08,630
Any wide open areas were a problem.

4780
03:17:08,630 --> 03:17:10,090
That joke really cemented his existence.

4781
03:17:10,090 --> 03:17:11,330
That's what I thought to call the Colonel.

4782
03:17:11,470 --> 03:17:13,970
Where I'd learn a way to trick the sensors.

4783
03:17:14,430 --> 03:17:15,270
With a box.

4784
03:17:15,470 --> 03:17:16,190
No way.

4785
03:17:16,310 --> 03:17:17,050
Is it box time?

4786
03:17:17,310 --> 03:17:17,650
Colonel.

4787
03:17:17,730 --> 03:17:18,730
Do you read me?

4788
03:17:19,130 --> 03:17:22,030
I'm on the third floor.

4789
03:17:22,230 --> 03:17:23,970
This is where the offices should be.

4790
03:17:23,990 --> 03:17:24,670
Should be.

4791
03:17:24,850 --> 03:17:25,930
Search for more files.

4792
03:17:26,250 --> 03:17:28,710
We need more intel about the attack.

4793
03:17:29,230 --> 03:17:30,950
That's not going to be easy.

4794
03:17:31,270 --> 03:17:32,070
Yeah, there's sensors.

4795
03:17:33,050 --> 03:17:34,670
Those offices should be empty.

4796
03:17:35,030 --> 03:17:36,570
Haven't seen anyone yet.

4797
03:17:36,830 --> 03:17:38,310
But there's a thermal sensor.

4798
03:17:38,350 --> 03:17:38,730
Yeah.

4799
03:17:38,890 --> 03:17:40,110
I can't proceed without setting it off.

4800
03:17:40,110 --> 03:17:40,690
We got a box.

4801
03:17:41,730 --> 03:17:43,070
Do you have any ideas?

4802
03:17:43,470 --> 03:17:47,230
In the army we use insulating suits to conceal our body temperature.

4803
03:17:47,230 --> 03:17:48,390
Insulating suits.

4804
03:17:48,630 --> 03:17:49,090
Oh.

4805
03:17:49,550 --> 03:17:50,850
Okay, that was abrupt.

4806
03:17:52,130 --> 03:17:53,190
Um, Robert.

4807
03:17:53,990 --> 03:17:55,470
You know any insulating suits?

4808
03:17:55,790 --> 03:17:55,870
Oh.

4809
03:17:58,930 --> 03:17:59,870
Robert, you there?

4810
03:18:00,190 --> 03:18:00,930
Okay, bye.

4811
03:18:01,990 --> 03:18:02,730
Jesse here.

4812
03:18:02,990 --> 03:18:03,450
Over.

4813
03:18:03,630 --> 03:18:03,890
Doc.

4814
03:18:04,070 --> 03:18:05,070
Oh, never mind.

4815
03:18:07,790 --> 03:18:08,670
Robert, you here?

4816
03:18:08,790 --> 03:18:09,050
Yep.

4817
03:18:10,230 --> 03:18:11,750
Um, is there a suit?

4818
03:18:12,450 --> 03:18:13,210
In here?

4819
03:18:14,010 --> 03:18:16,110
Where can we go find a suit?

4820
03:18:17,410 --> 03:18:18,290
Oh, that's right.

4821
03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:18,890
Level three.

4822
03:18:21,410 --> 03:18:21,810
Um...

4823
03:18:23,190 --> 03:18:24,590
The other floor...

4824
03:18:24,590 --> 03:18:25,190
Oh, sorry.

4825
03:18:25,290 --> 03:18:27,170
I keep acting like I have to...

4826
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:27,830
Wait, can we go up?

4827
03:18:27,910 --> 03:18:28,050
No.

4828
03:18:28,270 --> 03:18:29,470
I keep...

4829
03:18:29,470 --> 03:18:33,130
The other floor, the one with the drone, it looked like it needed a key.

4830
03:18:33,330 --> 03:18:36,370
We can test it, but I don't think we can go through it.

4831
03:18:37,350 --> 03:18:38,330
Oh, just kidding!

4832
03:18:38,610 --> 03:18:39,270
Oh my gosh.

4833
03:18:41,110 --> 03:18:41,510
Yeah!

4834
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:43,450
Oh my gosh.

4835
03:18:46,770 --> 03:18:47,170
Yeah!

4836
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:53,900
Oh, that was close.

4837
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:55,980
Ouchie, ouch, ouch.

4838
03:18:56,160 --> 03:18:57,500
I ran right into it.

4839
03:18:58,900 --> 03:18:59,540
Oh, my...

4840
03:18:59,540 --> 03:19:00,900
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.

4841
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:08,800
Holy cow.

4842
03:19:08,960 --> 03:19:09,320
Oh, gosh.

4843
03:19:09,400 --> 03:19:10,160
I can't get hit anymore.

4844
03:19:10,620 --> 03:19:11,420
Oh, I'm gonna die.

4845
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:12,140
I'm gonna die for real.

4846
03:19:12,220 --> 03:19:13,120
I'm gonna die for real.

4847
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:15,300
Don't hit me.

4848
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:19,620
Uh-oh.

4849
03:19:20,740 --> 03:19:21,220
Uh, guys?

4850
03:19:21,440 --> 03:19:21,880
Oh.

4851
03:19:27,980 --> 03:19:28,700
We're fine.

4852
03:19:29,780 --> 03:19:33,680
I noticed a few abandoned crates that were thirsty for some punch.

4853
03:19:34,160 --> 03:19:35,600
It seemed easy to reach.

4854
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:38,360
That is, until the containers started to drop.

4855
03:19:38,480 --> 03:19:39,160
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4856
03:19:39,300 --> 03:19:40,680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4857
03:19:41,660 --> 03:19:42,100
Wait!

4858
03:19:42,100 --> 03:19:43,480
We saw this thing earlier!

4859
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:45,420
Oh, my gosh.

4860
03:19:45,720 --> 03:19:45,960
Ah!

4861
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:54,960
Yes?

4862
03:19:57,900 --> 03:19:58,300
Oh!

4863
03:20:07,440 --> 03:20:07,840
Oh!

4864
03:20:07,960 --> 03:20:08,740
And we're at full health!

4865
03:20:09,100 --> 03:20:10,100
How perfect is that?

4866
03:20:10,460 --> 03:20:12,000
I think I'm cheating the system.

4867
03:20:12,140 --> 03:20:13,220
Let's go back to our gun.

4868
03:20:14,380 --> 03:20:15,900
And let's use that instead.

4869
03:20:17,180 --> 03:20:19,200
I noticed a few abandoned crates.

4870
03:20:20,660 --> 03:20:21,060
Megadron.

4871
03:20:22,300 --> 03:20:23,800
Have you guys ever seen that clip?

4872
03:20:23,940 --> 03:20:24,120
Oh!

4873
03:20:26,060 --> 03:20:26,460
Sorry.

4874
03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:28,680
I should pay attention to the shadow.

4875
03:20:30,140 --> 03:20:34,400
Have you guys ever seen that clip of the lady on the news?

4876
03:20:34,460 --> 03:20:37,120
I noticed a few abandoned crates that were thirsty for some punch.

4877
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:41,480
Trying to say this other person's name, but she calls her DD Megadoodoo.

4878
03:20:42,120 --> 03:20:45,920
I think about it way more often than I probably should.

4879
03:20:48,320 --> 03:20:48,820
Ah!

4880
03:20:52,130 --> 03:20:53,530
Maybe I don't attack it.

4881
03:20:53,570 --> 03:20:54,550
Maybe I just have to get...

4882
03:20:56,630 --> 03:20:57,630
Oh, never mind.

4883
03:20:57,690 --> 03:20:58,290
I do attack it.

4884
03:21:04,880 --> 03:21:05,380
Uh...

4885
03:21:05,380 --> 03:21:06,820
Well, that's not very good.

4886
03:21:06,960 --> 03:21:07,960
Okay, we are...

4887
03:21:10,420 --> 03:21:11,520
We're out of space.

4888
03:21:12,400 --> 03:21:14,040
We're like slowly...

4889
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:18,840
We're slowly losing space.

4890
03:21:22,540 --> 03:21:23,300
I'm out of gun!

4891
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:29,520
I don't think we're gonna make this.

4892
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:34,520
I didn't go up high enough.

4893
03:21:36,340 --> 03:21:37,660
Out of gun?

4894
03:21:39,340 --> 03:21:39,600
Out of gun!

4895
03:21:45,240 --> 03:21:47,760
Maybe we start with the left side.

4896
03:21:48,080 --> 03:21:49,600
Or I mean the right side, right?

4897
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:52,480
Left side, right side...

4898
03:21:53,660 --> 03:21:56,520
So maybe we get him to drop over here, right?

4899
03:21:58,280 --> 03:21:58,840
No!

4900
03:21:59,140 --> 03:22:00,460
You're ruining my plan!

4901
03:22:07,580 --> 03:22:09,000
You ruined my plan!

4902
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:13,280
Oh, wait.

4903
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:14,380
But how do I shoot him then?

4904
03:22:17,680 --> 03:22:19,640
Can I shoot him while he has the crates?

4905
03:22:19,720 --> 03:22:20,060
I wonder.

4906
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:23,540
Yes, we can.

4907
03:22:32,170 --> 03:22:33,370
Shoot before he drops it.

4908
03:22:33,450 --> 03:22:33,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4909
03:22:34,110 --> 03:22:34,790
Okay, okay, okay.

4910
03:22:36,590 --> 03:22:38,070
Let's switch our gun first.

4911
03:22:40,130 --> 03:22:40,490
And...

4912
03:22:43,610 --> 03:22:44,870
What was the plan there?

4913
03:22:45,150 --> 03:22:45,990
What are you talking about?

4914
03:22:45,990 --> 03:22:46,370
Oh!

4915
03:22:47,950 --> 03:22:48,830
Oh, was I dead?

4916
03:22:51,310 --> 03:22:52,330
I guess you're right.

4917
03:22:53,610 --> 03:22:54,710
Can we punch those?

4918
03:22:54,870 --> 03:22:55,470
I don't think so.

4919
03:22:56,410 --> 03:22:57,870
We have to like Tetris...

4920
03:22:57,870 --> 03:23:00,410
We have to like Tetris this a little bit.

4921
03:23:01,630 --> 03:23:02,070
Okay.

4922
03:23:04,350 --> 03:23:04,790
No!

4923
03:23:10,240 --> 03:23:11,120
Oh, shoot.

4924
03:23:11,220 --> 03:23:11,460
Okay.

4925
03:23:15,790 --> 03:23:17,030
Okay, I think we got two in.

4926
03:23:20,110 --> 03:23:20,590
Nice.

4927
03:23:21,090 --> 03:23:21,570
Okay.

4928
03:23:28,120 --> 03:23:28,600
Oh!

4929
03:23:35,740 --> 03:23:36,560
I can't...

4930
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:38,300
Okay, you can't run and reload, you guys.

4931
03:23:38,680 --> 03:23:39,640
Just letting you know.

4932
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:40,780
In case you were curious.

4933
03:23:42,040 --> 03:23:44,120
I tested that theory for you.

4934
03:23:44,580 --> 03:23:46,600
So you don't have to test it, okay?

4935
03:23:47,060 --> 03:23:49,820
So you don't have to test it, okay?

4936
03:23:49,820 --> 03:23:53,180
I noticed a few abandoned crates.

4937
03:23:53,800 --> 03:23:55,640
I noticed a few abandoned crates.

4938
03:23:57,060 --> 03:23:57,500
Run!

4939
03:23:58,660 --> 03:23:59,100
Okay.

4940
03:24:02,280 --> 03:24:03,160
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

4941
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:04,660
Okay.

4942
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:08,060
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

4943
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:11,840
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

4944
03:24:18,990 --> 03:24:19,850
That was close.

4945
03:24:24,550 --> 03:24:25,310
Nice, nice, nice.

4946
03:24:34,690 --> 03:24:36,470
Okay, here's where it's gonna start getting...

4947
03:24:36,470 --> 03:24:37,690
A little tricky.

4948
03:24:47,550 --> 03:24:48,190
Okay.

4949
03:24:48,290 --> 03:24:48,550
Okay.

4950
03:24:48,650 --> 03:24:49,590
We're almost there.

4951
03:24:50,210 --> 03:24:52,510
Oh, reload.

4952
03:24:53,230 --> 03:24:53,970
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

4953
03:24:56,570 --> 03:24:57,210
Yippee!

4954
03:24:59,310 --> 03:25:01,550
See, my plan worked, you guys!

4955
03:25:02,250 --> 03:25:03,210
Boss defeated!

4956
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:04,610
Boss defeated!

4957
03:25:06,850 --> 03:25:07,490
See?

4958
03:25:09,050 --> 03:25:10,470
I reached level four!

4959
03:25:11,490 --> 03:25:12,530
Tiger lunge.

4960
03:25:12,570 --> 03:25:16,250
You may press X to instantly close the distance and punch enemies into containers.

4961
03:25:17,810 --> 03:25:19,870
Cool down between rolls is halved.

4962
03:25:20,010 --> 03:25:22,870
I think the tiger lunge is probably better for me.

4963
03:25:23,830 --> 03:25:25,670
You can roll... I don't roll that...

4964
03:25:25,670 --> 03:25:28,070
I don't utilize the roll very much, so...

4965
03:25:28,070 --> 03:25:29,950
I think we're gonna tiger lunge.

4966
03:25:32,290 --> 03:25:34,110
I think we're gonna tiger lunge.

4967
03:25:34,210 --> 03:25:34,930
Press X.

4968
03:25:38,210 --> 03:25:38,750
Whoa!

4969
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:43,580
Sometimes...

4970
03:25:43,580 --> 03:25:45,180
Maybe there's a cool down on it.

4971
03:25:47,880 --> 03:25:48,660
Because some...

4972
03:25:48,660 --> 03:25:49,040
Oh, see?

4973
03:25:49,420 --> 03:25:49,900
Like...

4974
03:25:49,900 --> 03:25:50,780
Wow!

4975
03:25:52,940 --> 03:25:53,880
It's kind of awesome.

4976
03:25:58,160 --> 03:25:59,020
Moshi moshi!

4977
03:26:00,120 --> 03:26:00,600
Doctor!

4978
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:01,620
Doctor!

4979
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:04,140
What's that, Doctor?

4980
03:26:05,540 --> 03:26:06,860
Of course for you!

4981
03:26:07,080 --> 03:26:07,460
Of course!

4982
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:10,420
Are we...

4983
03:26:10,420 --> 03:26:12,500
gonna tell our girlfriend about this, or...

4984
03:26:13,780 --> 03:26:14,820
What are you talking about?

4985
03:26:14,880 --> 03:26:16,060
Not that I care, per se.

4986
03:26:16,740 --> 03:26:18,420
But I'm getting a little overwhelmed here.

4987
03:26:18,700 --> 03:26:19,220
Oh.

4988
03:26:19,800 --> 03:26:20,620
Sorry, Doc.

4989
03:26:20,820 --> 03:26:22,560
Doc, I just learned tiger lunge.

4990
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:23,160
I'm sorry, I cannot.

4991
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:23,920
You're drooling.

4992
03:26:24,540 --> 03:26:25,060
What?

4993
03:26:28,020 --> 03:26:29,060
Oh, sorry.

4994
03:26:29,260 --> 03:26:31,160
Her voice was so damn sexy.

4995
03:26:31,580 --> 03:26:33,620
Is my voice not feminine enough for you?

4996
03:26:33,800 --> 03:26:36,900
Well, it's girly, of course, but...

4997
03:26:36,900 --> 03:26:38,580
Oh, shut up.

4998
03:26:38,800 --> 03:26:39,800
Continue your story.

4999
03:26:41,500 --> 03:26:42,720
He's telling everything!

5000
03:26:42,900 --> 03:26:43,180
He's...

5001
03:26:43,180 --> 03:26:45,220
He's saying all this about...

5002
03:26:45,220 --> 03:26:45,580
What?

5003
03:26:46,340 --> 03:26:46,780
Okay.

5004
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:51,960
Del, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

5005
03:26:52,840 --> 03:26:53,640
Thank you!

5006
03:26:56,800 --> 03:26:58,700
Doctor, I just learned tiger lunge.

5007
03:26:58,720 --> 03:27:01,660
I don't think there's a way that I can make things a little...

5008
03:27:01,660 --> 03:27:04,940
I don't think there's a way that I can make things less violent, you know?

5009
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:07,840
Oh, we're going back into the sewers.

5010
03:27:08,980 --> 03:27:09,580
What's this?

5011
03:27:10,680 --> 03:27:11,120
Antithermal?

5012
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:14,280
Antitherm... wait.

5013
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:15,940
Oh, yes, we need that.

5014
03:27:17,260 --> 03:27:19,180
But I don't want to go back through the...

5015
03:27:19,720 --> 03:27:20,760
the way we came.

5016
03:27:22,140 --> 03:27:23,520
Wait, this is a secret lab.

5017
03:27:23,600 --> 03:27:28,340
I climbed down into a pokey little room that seemed to be stocked with a lot of chemicals.

5018
03:27:28,360 --> 03:27:28,900
A pokey room?

5019
03:27:29,300 --> 03:27:32,660
I could brew up some chloroform to put the guards to sleep.

5020
03:27:32,900 --> 03:27:34,900
And score points with the doctor.

5021
03:27:35,140 --> 03:27:35,440
Oh!

5022
03:27:35,540 --> 03:27:35,820
Hold on.

5023
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:37,600
You have expertise in chemistry?

5024
03:27:38,600 --> 03:27:39,960
Chemistry's not that hard.

5025
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:40,880
Oh, yeah.

5026
03:27:40,880 --> 03:27:40,880
Of course not.

5027
03:27:40,880 --> 03:27:42,840
You just have to mix the ingredients correctly.

5028
03:27:44,840 --> 03:27:45,860
That's why I...

5029
03:27:45,860 --> 03:27:46,580
you know...

5030
03:27:47,110 --> 03:27:47,340
Oh.

5031
03:27:48,020 --> 03:27:50,120
Please get degrees anyway, you know?

5032
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:52,240
It doesn't matter what I passed with.

5033
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:53,940
I passed the class.

5034
03:27:55,740 --> 03:27:57,620
We got a little bit of sodium!

5035
03:27:58,320 --> 03:27:59,340
What else we got here?

5036
03:28:00,820 --> 03:28:02,220
A little bit of water.

5037
03:28:04,720 --> 03:28:05,640
More sodium.

5038
03:28:05,780 --> 03:28:06,700
Yeah, we need that.

5039
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:08,360
Mm-hmm.

5040
03:28:10,360 --> 03:28:11,280
More chloro.

5041
03:28:11,660 --> 03:28:12,280
Mm-hmm.

5042
03:28:13,180 --> 03:28:14,400
Oh, we got the form!

5043
03:28:14,540 --> 03:28:14,920
Okay.

5044
03:28:18,640 --> 03:28:19,640
More chloro.

5045
03:28:20,800 --> 03:28:21,800
More form.

5046
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:22,500
Oh, just kidding.

5047
03:28:25,060 --> 03:28:28,120
Let's make it so they can't do any more little experiments down here.

5048
03:28:29,280 --> 03:28:29,940
Mm-hmm.

5049
03:28:32,920 --> 03:28:33,640
Mm-hmm.

5050
03:28:34,440 --> 03:28:38,120
Before leaving, I mixed the elements to create chloroform.

5051
03:28:38,380 --> 03:28:38,880
Oh, yes.

5052
03:28:38,880 --> 03:28:39,520
Um...

5053
03:28:46,670 --> 03:28:48,800
Three parts chloro.

5054
03:28:48,800 --> 03:28:50,240
One part form.

5055
03:28:50,420 --> 03:28:51,880
Chloro, chloro, chloroform.

5056
03:28:56,660 --> 03:28:57,920
Oh, wait.

5057
03:28:58,020 --> 03:28:58,520
That's it?

5058
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:01,140
What's a water sodium?

5059
03:29:04,330 --> 03:29:04,780
Oh,

5060
03:29:17,370 --> 03:29:18,070
that works!

5061
03:29:21,930 --> 03:29:23,670
Is that how that works?

5062
03:29:23,690 --> 03:29:24,590
Is that how that works?

5063
03:29:26,370 --> 03:29:29,250
The ocean is just one big bomb, you guys.

5064
03:29:31,550 --> 03:29:36,030
The ocean is just one big bomb waiting to explode on us.

5065
03:29:43,910 --> 03:29:45,370
Water plus sodium.

5066
03:29:49,250 --> 03:29:50,090
That's the wa...

5067
03:29:50,090 --> 03:29:51,930
Yeah, the water is the dangerous part, you guys.

5068
03:29:53,930 --> 03:29:54,410
Water.

5069
03:29:54,530 --> 03:29:55,370
Not even once.

5070
03:29:55,610 --> 03:29:55,930
Okay?

5071
03:29:58,830 --> 03:29:59,990
Sodium is not salt.

5072
03:30:00,770 --> 03:30:02,650
Um... I think it is.

5073
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:11,750
Oh!

5074
03:30:11,850 --> 03:30:12,170
Oh!

5075
03:30:12,390 --> 03:30:12,870
Oopsie.

5076
03:30:12,890 --> 03:30:13,650
I just made the...

5077
03:30:13,650 --> 03:30:15,570
Now I made the salt!

5078
03:30:15,590 --> 03:30:16,190
Salt water.

5079
03:30:18,130 --> 03:30:18,610
Oops.

5080
03:30:20,170 --> 03:30:21,330
I made salt water.

5081
03:30:22,610 --> 03:30:23,530
Anyway, um...

5082
03:30:23,530 --> 03:30:24,050
Chloro...

5083
03:30:27,050 --> 03:30:27,770
What is this?

5084
03:30:29,270 --> 03:30:29,910
There we go.

5085
03:30:30,010 --> 03:30:30,410
Chloroform.

5086
03:30:31,030 --> 03:30:31,950
And salt water.

5087
03:30:36,510 --> 03:30:37,830
What's the salt water gonna be for?

5088
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:38,290
I don't know.

5089
03:30:38,750 --> 03:30:40,230
Whatever we feel like it.

5090
03:30:43,950 --> 03:30:45,110
Whatever we feel like.

5091
03:30:47,550 --> 03:30:50,870
A guard with his back turned was listening to music.

5092
03:30:51,030 --> 03:30:51,150
Yeah.

5093
03:30:51,590 --> 03:30:54,610
It was the perfect chance to test out the chloroform.

5094
03:30:54,870 --> 03:30:58,150
Yeah, I'm gonna... I just needed to sneak up and put him to sleep.

5095
03:30:58,590 --> 03:30:59,070
Okay.

5096
03:30:59,430 --> 03:31:02,390
You guys, I'm gonna put the chloroform on my fists, okay?

5097
03:31:04,270 --> 03:31:06,490
I'm gonna put the chloroform on my fists.

5098
03:31:16,040 --> 03:31:16,520
Okay,

5099
03:31:22,610 --> 03:31:23,510
you actually failed.

5100
03:31:24,850 --> 03:31:26,110
A guard with his back.

5101
03:31:26,170 --> 03:31:26,530
Okay.

5102
03:31:29,030 --> 03:31:30,510
Um, what do I see?

5103
03:31:32,750 --> 03:31:33,270
Wait.

5104
03:31:33,430 --> 03:31:35,010
I wonder what this smells like.

5105
03:31:35,790 --> 03:31:37,150
What this smells like?

5106
03:31:37,430 --> 03:31:38,150
Hold on.

5107
03:31:38,230 --> 03:31:40,350
Are you telling me that you sniffed the chloroform?

5108
03:31:40,450 --> 03:31:43,790
That you yourself made for the purpose of knocking people out?

5109
03:31:44,030 --> 03:31:45,210
He just walked away.

5110
03:31:45,450 --> 03:31:48,590
Why didn't you douse a handkerchief and cover the victim's face?

5111
03:31:48,790 --> 03:31:49,990
Like how everyone does.

5112
03:31:49,990 --> 03:31:50,270
Oh yeah.

5113
03:31:50,690 --> 03:31:53,230
My mind was cloudy at the time.

5114
03:31:53,230 --> 03:31:56,450
Maybe due to the fumes from mixing those chemicals.

5115
03:31:56,830 --> 03:32:01,330
As for pouring the chloroform on a handkerchief, I figured it out later.

5116
03:32:01,610 --> 03:32:02,990
Of course I...

5117
03:32:02,990 --> 03:32:04,930
It smells weird.

5118
03:32:05,210 --> 03:32:05,970
Goodnight.

5119
03:32:06,790 --> 03:32:07,550
Very...

5120
03:32:08,950 --> 03:32:09,710
Very...

5121
03:32:10,730 --> 03:32:11,490
Weird.

5122
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:16,120
Oh.

5123
03:32:19,660 --> 03:32:20,840
What's happening?

5124
03:32:21,300 --> 03:32:22,320
What the hell?

5125
03:32:22,880 --> 03:32:24,140
I can't move.

5126
03:32:25,080 --> 03:32:25,500
Oh!

5127
03:32:27,500 --> 03:32:28,600
He's wiggling!

5128
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:31,180
No!

5129
03:32:31,320 --> 03:32:31,920
The medal!

5130
03:32:32,940 --> 03:32:34,300
I didn't know!

5131
03:32:35,400 --> 03:32:38,600
Where did he put the medal?

5132
03:32:39,120 --> 03:32:39,920
Doctor!

5133
03:32:44,140 --> 03:32:45,740
Hold on.

5134
03:32:45,800 --> 03:32:46,840
I'm gonna eat my onigiri.

5135
03:32:47,300 --> 03:32:48,100
Oh!

5136
03:32:55,080 --> 03:32:55,720
I need to untie you.

5137
03:32:56,780 --> 03:32:58,220
Don't untie me.

5138
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:00,120
As you wish.

5139
03:33:00,360 --> 03:33:00,540
Oh!

5140
03:33:01,940 --> 03:33:02,540
Doctor!

5141
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:03,220
Oh!

5142
03:33:03,220 --> 03:33:03,700
Doctor!

5143
03:33:04,440 --> 03:33:05,220
Oh wait.

5144
03:33:06,900 --> 03:33:08,100
Hey Mike.

5145
03:33:08,380 --> 03:33:10,300
This guy's talking in his sleep.

5146
03:33:10,700 --> 03:33:12,400
He's asking for a doctor.

5147
03:33:12,720 --> 03:33:15,400
Must be a nightmare about a previous injury.

5148
03:33:16,060 --> 03:33:18,580
Soldiers with PTSD get them all the time.

5149
03:33:18,980 --> 03:33:21,100
He must have been through some shit.

5150
03:33:21,320 --> 03:33:22,420
Poor bastard.

5151
03:33:22,420 --> 03:33:23,980
I don't know Mike.

5152
03:33:24,140 --> 03:33:24,920
Look down.

5153
03:33:25,520 --> 03:33:26,400
What the fuck?

5154
03:33:26,760 --> 03:33:28,020
He's harder than whiskey.

5155
03:33:28,680 --> 03:33:29,520
Oh my god!

5156
03:33:29,820 --> 03:33:30,780
Don't laugh at me!

5157
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:32,820
We're close to the cells.

5158
03:33:33,100 --> 03:33:34,240
Let's get him locked up.

5159
03:33:34,700 --> 03:33:35,400
Fuck Mike.

5160
03:33:35,540 --> 03:33:36,320
He's waking up.

5161
03:33:36,520 --> 03:33:36,920
Uh oh.

5162
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:37,860
Wait hold on.

5163
03:33:38,140 --> 03:33:39,060
I'm eating my...

5164
03:33:39,060 --> 03:33:44,460
Hold on.

5165
03:33:44,480 --> 03:33:45,400
I'm eating my onigiri.

5166
03:33:46,960 --> 03:33:47,400
Oh.

5167
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:48,380
I'm bleeding out.

5168
03:33:53,860 --> 03:33:54,380
Um...

5169
03:33:54,380 --> 03:33:55,700
Can I go back up?

5170
03:33:55,800 --> 03:33:56,860
And get that um...

5171
03:33:58,220 --> 03:33:59,140
That metal?

5172
03:34:00,880 --> 03:34:02,180
I forgot it.

5173
03:34:06,320 --> 03:34:07,680
He's harder than whiskey.

5174
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:10,580
Whiskey is a hard liquor.

5175
03:34:12,680 --> 03:34:13,200
Wait.

5176
03:34:13,720 --> 03:34:14,420
Yeah yeah.

5177
03:34:15,600 --> 03:34:16,120
Wait.

5178
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:17,900
Is this correct?

5179
03:34:18,140 --> 03:34:18,560
Yeah yeah.

5180
03:34:19,760 --> 03:34:20,280
Oh.

5181
03:34:20,320 --> 03:34:20,660
Oh.

5182
03:34:20,820 --> 03:34:22,080
Oh wait.

5183
03:34:22,640 --> 03:34:23,360
What floor?

5184
03:34:23,800 --> 03:34:23,900
Oh.

5185
03:34:23,900 --> 03:34:24,680
It was floor two.

5186
03:34:25,920 --> 03:34:26,420
Wait.

5187
03:34:29,500 --> 03:34:31,260
We have to go through the robots again.

5188
03:34:31,360 --> 03:34:31,780
Don't we?

5189
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:33,880
Oh shoot.

5190
03:34:35,280 --> 03:34:36,240
Oh shoot.

5191
03:34:37,600 --> 03:34:38,860
I see him.

5192
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:40,540
Oh.

5193
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:41,500
My bad.

5194
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:43,420
What is this place?

5195
03:34:43,640 --> 03:34:44,060
Wait a second.

5196
03:34:44,320 --> 03:34:45,540
I didn't notice this before.

5197
03:34:47,320 --> 03:34:47,820
Interesting.

5198
03:34:47,940 --> 03:34:49,780
I discovered something real quick.

5199
03:34:49,820 --> 03:34:50,340
You guys.

5200
03:34:52,140 --> 03:34:52,640
Oh.

5201
03:34:52,700 --> 03:34:53,000
Uh.

5202
03:34:53,800 --> 03:34:53,960
Uh.

5203
03:34:55,380 --> 03:34:55,780
I.

5204
03:34:56,200 --> 03:34:56,600
Um.

5205
03:34:58,840 --> 03:34:59,240
Uh.

5206
03:35:00,940 --> 03:35:02,160
Don't think I can get through.

5207
03:35:05,760 --> 03:35:06,560
Box puzzle.

5208
03:35:06,740 --> 03:35:08,280
But I can only move one box.

5209
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:12,260
And I can only move it in one spot.

5210
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:13,780
I think it's uh...

5211
03:35:13,780 --> 03:35:15,040
More so...

5212
03:35:16,320 --> 03:35:17,580
Coming out from that end.

5213
03:35:19,560 --> 03:35:20,460
How do we find?

5214
03:35:20,520 --> 03:35:21,380
How do we get to that though?

5215
03:35:24,680 --> 03:35:25,220
Eeeeek!

5216
03:35:26,540 --> 03:35:27,080
Run!

5217
03:35:28,740 --> 03:35:29,280
Run!

5218
03:35:30,800 --> 03:35:31,340
Run!

5219
03:35:32,180 --> 03:35:32,420
Run!

5220
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:39,520
One last shot for safe measure, right?

5221
03:35:40,060 --> 03:35:40,600
No!

5222
03:35:43,700 --> 03:35:44,620
What can I...

5223
03:35:44,620 --> 03:35:45,680
It told me to press X.

5224
03:35:45,920 --> 03:35:46,060
Oh.

5225
03:35:46,120 --> 03:35:46,880
On what though?

5226
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:47,600
On this?

5227
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:51,060
What is it telling me to press X on?

5228
03:35:51,160 --> 03:35:51,220
What is it telling me to press X on?

5229
03:35:51,220 --> 03:35:51,260
Oh.

5230
03:35:53,420 --> 03:35:54,400
Let's try to figure it out.

5231
03:35:58,260 --> 03:35:58,700
Let's see.

5232
03:35:58,760 --> 03:35:59,040
Hold on.

5233
03:35:59,300 --> 03:35:59,580
Let's see.

5234
03:35:59,580 --> 03:35:59,580
Hold on.

5235
03:36:00,700 --> 03:36:02,220
Well now we know not to go that way.

5236
03:36:02,700 --> 03:36:03,020
So...

5237
03:36:06,560 --> 03:36:06,880
Sorry.

5238
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:08,620
I know this is a lot for just a medal.

5239
03:36:08,740 --> 03:36:09,880
But it's important to me.

5240
03:36:09,900 --> 03:36:10,060
Okay?

5241
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:11,340
Please understand.

5242
03:36:12,260 --> 03:36:13,120
Pshew!

5243
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:13,460
Pshew!

5244
03:36:13,760 --> 03:36:14,240
Pshew!

5245
03:36:14,280 --> 03:36:14,620
Pshew!

5246
03:36:15,640 --> 03:36:16,660
It's important to me.

5247
03:36:16,780 --> 03:36:16,940
Oh!

5248
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:18,160
Press X did it again.

5249
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:19,880
Oh!

5250
03:36:19,880 --> 03:36:23,960
If I see it, I'll try and grab it.

5251
03:36:24,940 --> 03:36:25,420
Yow!

5252
03:36:26,440 --> 03:36:26,920
Yowza!

5253
03:36:29,640 --> 03:36:31,000
Thrashing all over again.

5254
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:32,280
I don't even know...

5255
03:36:32,280 --> 03:36:33,760
What you're talking about.

5256
03:36:39,980 --> 03:36:40,900
Down here?

5257
03:36:42,840 --> 03:36:45,180
Maybe we can get more stuff for more Chloroform even.

5258
03:36:45,820 --> 03:36:46,440
Never mind.

5259
03:36:46,520 --> 03:36:47,360
I destroyed the lab.

5260
03:36:55,170 --> 03:36:55,570
Combine...

5261
03:36:55,990 --> 03:36:57,490
with the Chloroform.

5262
03:36:58,210 --> 03:36:59,010
Oh yeah!

5263
03:37:01,370 --> 03:37:04,130
Keep space pressed for 3 seconds to put the guard to sleep.

5264
03:37:09,780 --> 03:37:11,700
You can move a guard while you put him to sleep.

5265
03:37:13,840 --> 03:37:14,240
Oh.

5266
03:37:14,260 --> 03:37:15,120
While I put him to sleep?

5267
03:37:18,220 --> 03:37:18,740
Hey!

5268
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:19,680
Good night!

5269
03:37:20,500 --> 03:37:21,600
And we got it.

5270
03:37:22,860 --> 03:37:24,140
Auto-generated experiment.

5271
03:37:24,500 --> 03:37:25,180
Quality ma- Oh.

5272
03:37:25,240 --> 03:37:30,360
Viewers are laughing at a character in the game named Mike, who is dreaming he has a solid snake.

5273
03:37:33,100 --> 03:37:41,180
Viewers are referencing a character from the Metal Gear series who is also named solid snake.

5274
03:37:42,520 --> 03:37:42,920
Snake...

5275
03:37:49,860 --> 03:37:50,660
Bullet slide!

5276
03:37:51,100 --> 03:37:51,220
Oh!

5277
03:37:51,360 --> 03:37:52,400
Will you get more bullets maybe?

5278
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:56,640
Very good.

5279
03:37:57,180 --> 03:37:57,580
Oh!

5280
03:37:57,780 --> 03:37:58,180
Wait!

5281
03:37:58,260 --> 03:38:01,320
This might be the room that we saw earlier.

5282
03:38:01,680 --> 03:38:02,040
Yup.

5283
03:38:06,330 --> 03:38:06,730
Good.

5284
03:38:06,910 --> 03:38:07,470
We need more...

5285
03:38:07,470 --> 03:38:13,130
I was gonna say we need more bullets, but I guess I was gonna say we need more bullets, but I guess not.

5286
03:38:20,970 --> 03:38:21,330
Wait.

5287
03:38:21,410 --> 03:38:22,510
How am I supposed to...

5288
03:38:24,510 --> 03:38:26,850
How am I supposed to kick it into here?

5289
03:38:27,810 --> 03:38:28,170
Wait.

5290
03:38:30,210 --> 03:38:31,530
I don't think this is a puzzle.

5291
03:38:34,550 --> 03:38:35,090
Oh wait.

5292
03:38:35,150 --> 03:38:35,990
You can go down one more?

5293
03:38:36,370 --> 03:38:36,730
Oh.

5294
03:38:36,770 --> 03:38:38,470
It's kind of hard to tell with the depth perception.

5295
03:38:38,830 --> 03:38:39,150
Oh.

5296
03:38:39,190 --> 03:38:39,510
You're right.

5297
03:38:39,650 --> 03:38:39,910
Okay.

5298
03:38:39,990 --> 03:38:40,430
Thank you.

5299
03:38:41,730 --> 03:38:43,710
It's a little hard to tell with the depth perception.

5300
03:38:44,050 --> 03:38:44,350
Okay.

5301
03:38:44,390 --> 03:38:44,610
Cool.

5302
03:38:44,690 --> 03:38:44,810
Cool.

5303
03:38:44,910 --> 03:38:44,990
Cool.

5304
03:38:49,010 --> 03:38:50,290
Let's go upset!

5305
03:38:50,650 --> 03:38:51,130
Let's go upset!

5306
03:38:51,130 --> 03:38:51,330
Let's go upset!

5307
03:38:51,330 --> 03:38:54,230
Actually, let's go grab some more health kits.

5308
03:38:54,850 --> 03:38:55,750
Because I'm paranoid.

5309
03:38:58,910 --> 03:38:59,870
It's okay to hit it.

5310
03:38:59,950 --> 03:39:00,170
It's okay to hit it.

5311
03:39:00,170 --> 03:39:00,490
Just a box!

5312
03:39:01,210 --> 03:39:02,250
Just a box.

5313
03:39:05,170 --> 03:39:06,490
Just a box.

5314
03:39:07,210 --> 03:39:07,690
Yeah.

5315
03:39:07,810 --> 03:39:08,770
It's my streamer brain.

5316
03:39:08,830 --> 03:39:09,370
I'm so sorry.

5317
03:39:11,490 --> 03:39:12,890
And also sicky brain.

5318
03:39:13,050 --> 03:39:13,790
Please understand.

5319
03:39:17,290 --> 03:39:18,050
Sicky brain.

5320
03:39:19,970 --> 03:39:21,490
My onigiri is so good.

5321
03:39:21,710 --> 03:39:22,270
Oh my gosh.

5322
03:39:22,390 --> 03:39:24,850
It's just a tuna mayo, but... Oh my god!

5323
03:39:24,970 --> 03:39:26,790
There's so many of you guys!

5324
03:39:28,610 --> 03:39:29,730
I'm sorry, Doc.

5325
03:39:30,430 --> 03:39:32,850
Doc, I'm so sorry.

5326
03:39:33,030 --> 03:39:34,370
There's so many guys.

5327
03:39:35,070 --> 03:39:35,590
Hahaha.

5328
03:39:35,910 --> 03:39:36,430
Oh!

5329
03:39:38,570 --> 03:39:39,090
Sorry.

5330
03:39:41,850 --> 03:39:42,370
Hahaha.

5331
03:39:43,250 --> 03:39:43,470
Hahaha.

5332
03:39:45,390 --> 03:39:46,510
Everything hurts.

5333
03:39:47,290 --> 03:39:47,630
Hahaha.

5334
03:39:50,630 --> 03:39:52,030
Doc, it was a misclick.

5335
03:39:52,090 --> 03:39:52,610
I promise.

5336
03:39:53,150 --> 03:39:55,610
My hand lashed out on its own.

5337
03:39:55,750 --> 03:39:56,870
I think it's possessed.

5338
03:39:56,930 --> 03:39:58,850
I stole it from the sewers.

5339
03:39:59,050 --> 03:39:59,610
Hahaha.

5340
03:40:00,790 --> 03:40:02,770
Yeah, that arm is me.

5341
03:40:04,390 --> 03:40:06,410
You might be wondering how I got here.

5342
03:40:09,330 --> 03:40:11,830
Okay, third floor time, baby!

5343
03:40:15,290 --> 03:40:16,150
Third floor.

5344
03:40:18,490 --> 03:40:20,730
And we're gonna put on our little sneaking suit.

5345
03:40:24,740 --> 03:40:26,740
And we still don't have the third key.

5346
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:27,920
Yeah.

5347
03:40:28,020 --> 03:40:30,260
So now we know two doors, at least.

5348
03:40:30,440 --> 03:40:31,080
Was there any more?

5349
03:40:31,800 --> 03:40:32,980
Can't remember if there were.

5350
03:40:33,140 --> 03:40:33,980
But at least two!

5351
03:40:35,280 --> 03:40:38,280
A shiny, delicate, fragile suit used for heat-related tasks.

5352
03:40:39,960 --> 03:40:41,280
Like I put this on, right?

5353
03:40:43,260 --> 03:40:44,240
Am I wearing it?

5354
03:40:45,720 --> 03:40:46,620
Is it on?

5355
03:40:47,780 --> 03:40:48,400
Is it on?

5356
03:40:48,540 --> 03:40:55,830
I knew better than to punch while wearing the suit.

5357
03:40:56,050 --> 03:40:57,930
It was delicate and could tear.

5358
03:40:58,250 --> 03:41:01,410
Bad news, no punches while wearing the suit.

5359
03:41:01,830 --> 03:41:04,910
Good news, scoring more points with the doctor.

5360
03:41:05,210 --> 03:41:05,590
Hahaha.

5361
03:41:05,890 --> 03:41:07,670
In what way?

5362
03:41:08,870 --> 03:41:09,470
Why?

5363
03:41:10,190 --> 03:41:11,210
A battery?

5364
03:41:13,850 --> 03:41:14,450
Okay.

5365
03:41:14,570 --> 03:41:14,990
Okay.

5366
03:41:18,030 --> 03:41:18,730
Dang it.

5367
03:41:23,510 --> 03:41:24,070
Major.

5368
03:41:24,430 --> 03:41:25,490
He can't see.

5369
03:41:25,630 --> 03:41:27,050
It can't detect me from here, right?

5370
03:41:28,650 --> 03:41:29,210
Yeah.

5371
03:41:32,450 --> 03:41:33,010
Okay.

5372
03:41:34,350 --> 03:41:34,910
Okay.

5373
03:41:36,510 --> 03:41:38,030
We're in a little office room.

5374
03:41:38,450 --> 03:41:39,010
Destroy!

5375
03:41:40,010 --> 03:41:41,130
More files!

5376
03:41:41,690 --> 03:41:42,250
Colonel!

5377
03:41:42,370 --> 03:41:42,650
Colonel!

5378
03:41:42,730 --> 03:41:42,930
Colonel!

5379
03:41:43,410 --> 03:41:45,150
What is it, Fox?

5380
03:41:45,550 --> 03:41:47,950
Colonel, I discovered a third document.

5381
03:41:48,230 --> 03:41:49,770
Good job, son!

5382
03:41:49,930 --> 03:41:50,610
What's on it?

5383
03:41:50,730 --> 03:41:52,410
Let me take a look at it.

5384
03:41:53,430 --> 03:41:53,990
Interesting.

5385
03:41:54,330 --> 03:41:55,550
What was your name?

5386
03:41:56,230 --> 03:41:57,250
Colonel Alan Harris.

5387
03:41:57,650 --> 03:41:58,790
Why do you ask?

5388
03:41:59,130 --> 03:42:01,010
Because your name is written here.

5389
03:42:01,470 --> 03:42:03,430
Don't pull my legs, son.

5390
03:42:03,810 --> 03:42:05,070
I'm serious, Colonel.

5391
03:42:05,070 --> 03:42:05,090
It's right here.

5392
03:42:05,090 --> 03:42:08,030
The tuna just fell out of my onigiri all over my hands.

5393
03:42:08,050 --> 03:42:10,150
This means that they need me for their plan.

5394
03:42:10,290 --> 03:42:11,030
My hands have mail.

5395
03:42:11,730 --> 03:42:12,290
Hahaha.

5396
03:42:13,710 --> 03:42:14,270
Hahaha.

5397
03:42:14,810 --> 03:42:15,030
Hahaha.

5398
03:42:22,940 --> 03:42:24,700
Why is it so messy?

5399
03:42:25,080 --> 03:42:25,640
Hahaha.

5400
03:42:28,640 --> 03:42:30,560
Hold on, I'm going to wash my hands real quick.

5401
03:42:31,960 --> 03:42:32,680
Hold on, guys.

5402
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:33,120
BRB.

5403
03:42:52,420 --> 03:42:56,540
Actually, I'm going to make some tea, too, since I don't actually have anything to drink right now.

5404
03:42:57,960 --> 03:42:59,020
Wait, is that what I do?

5405
03:42:59,120 --> 03:42:59,740
I have a smoothie!

5406
03:43:02,700 --> 03:43:03,920
I have a smoothie!

5407
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:11,140
I've been drinking a lot of veggie smoothies.

5408
03:43:11,680 --> 03:43:13,540
I'm going to try and combat my sickness.

5409
03:43:17,080 --> 03:43:17,700
Here you go.

5410
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:18,400
Here you go.

5411
03:43:19,440 --> 03:43:19,800
Wait.

5412
03:43:21,580 --> 03:43:22,860
Can I go to the bathroom real quick?

5413
03:43:24,720 --> 03:43:25,480
Hold on, guys.

5414
03:43:25,960 --> 03:43:26,640
I've got to pee.

5415
03:43:27,260 --> 03:43:28,800
I've got to go to the little ghosty's room.

5416
03:43:29,100 --> 03:43:29,580
Hold on.

5417
03:43:29,680 --> 03:43:30,760
Let me equip the potty.

5418
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:35,400
Okay.

5419
03:43:35,600 --> 03:43:36,560
Give me one second.

5420
03:44:43,080 --> 03:44:44,700
I, like, just washed my hands.

5421
03:44:45,780 --> 03:44:47,420
Now I have to wash my hands again.

5422
03:44:50,300 --> 03:44:50,980
Dang it!

5423
03:45:13,430 --> 03:45:14,210
One second!

5424
03:45:18,810 --> 03:45:19,330
Wait,

5425
03:45:31,160 --> 03:45:31,560
my tea!

5426
03:45:31,860 --> 03:45:32,480
Wait a second.

5427
03:45:34,320 --> 03:45:36,140
You guys, I'm forgetting everything.

5428
03:45:38,560 --> 03:45:39,080
Okay.

5429
03:45:39,180 --> 03:45:40,540
I'm waiting for the water to boil.

5430
03:45:42,420 --> 03:45:44,160
I turned on the little kettle.

5431
03:45:44,160 --> 03:45:47,900
I should have turned it on when I got up for the bathroom.

5432
03:45:48,280 --> 03:45:49,200
But I'm an idiot.

5433
03:45:50,100 --> 03:45:50,620
Okay.

5434
03:45:58,040 --> 03:45:59,540
La la la la la.

5435
03:46:01,440 --> 03:46:01,960
Let's...

5436
03:46:01,960 --> 03:46:03,920
Oh my gosh, it's already almost 2 p.m.

5437
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:06,300
Let's finish this chapter!

5438
03:46:06,460 --> 03:46:11,120
How many chapters did you guys say there were in this game?

5439
03:46:11,240 --> 03:46:12,100
I can't remember.

5440
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:16,480
How many chapters were there?

5441
03:46:18,380 --> 03:46:18,820
Six?

5442
03:46:19,380 --> 03:46:19,960
And what?

5443
03:46:20,120 --> 03:46:21,380
Oh wait, we're on level...

5444
03:46:21,380 --> 03:46:22,140
That's level four.

5445
03:46:23,520 --> 03:46:23,960
Um...

5446
03:46:27,820 --> 03:46:28,700
Oh, wait, ten?

5447
03:46:35,920 --> 03:46:36,660
Ten or six?

5448
03:46:40,320 --> 03:46:41,200
More battery.

5449
03:46:41,700 --> 03:46:43,080
Yeah, we're on chapter three.

5450
03:46:43,160 --> 03:46:45,180
Oh gosh, I'm not making very good progress.

5451
03:46:46,720 --> 03:46:48,080
Uh oh.

5452
03:46:48,200 --> 03:46:49,140
Uh oh.

5453
03:46:49,680 --> 03:46:50,360
Um...

5454
03:46:51,080 --> 03:46:51,420
Guys?

5455
03:46:52,520 --> 03:46:52,720
Ah!

5456
03:46:56,950 --> 03:46:57,630
Um...

5457
03:46:59,570 --> 03:47:00,250
Uh...

5458
03:47:05,500 --> 03:47:07,800
I didn't think the thermal would see me.

5459
03:47:08,960 --> 03:47:09,780
It's okay.

5460
03:47:10,620 --> 03:47:11,820
That was...

5461
03:47:11,820 --> 03:47:14,160
Oh wait, let's destroy the rest of the room.

5462
03:47:16,580 --> 03:47:18,500
We must destroy everything first.

5463
03:47:19,020 --> 03:47:21,000
Good luck with Unmetal and your health.

5464
03:47:21,380 --> 03:47:22,080
Thank you!

5465
03:47:23,840 --> 03:47:24,760
Thank you, thank you!

5466
03:47:27,420 --> 03:47:27,820
Okay.

5467
03:47:32,280 --> 03:47:33,360
As long as we get that.

5468
03:47:33,600 --> 03:47:33,920
Okay.

5469
03:47:34,040 --> 03:47:34,980
Uh, my...

5470
03:47:35,500 --> 03:47:38,860
Well, let's just finish up this chapter and then I guess we'll see how...

5471
03:47:41,560 --> 03:47:41,960
How...

5472
03:47:41,960 --> 03:47:42,700
Oh, wait.

5473
03:47:43,360 --> 03:47:45,140
Oh, this is like a real puzzle, isn't it?

5474
03:47:46,540 --> 03:47:46,940
Huh?

5475
03:47:48,420 --> 03:47:48,820
Oh.

5476
03:47:49,540 --> 03:47:51,040
Do you think it can see me here?

5477
03:47:53,680 --> 03:47:55,480
Does a slingshot work on...

5478
03:47:55,480 --> 03:47:55,860
Does a slingshot work on...

5479
03:47:55,860 --> 03:47:57,540
On crates?

5480
03:47:58,800 --> 03:47:59,320
On

5481
03:48:11,530 --> 03:48:11,530
crates?

5482
03:48:11,810 --> 03:48:12,910
What about guns?

5483
03:48:18,700 --> 03:48:19,760
What about guns?

5484
03:48:22,080 --> 03:48:23,420
Do you think it...

5485
03:48:23,420 --> 03:48:25,860
I think it will see me at this crate over on the right here.

5486
03:48:26,160 --> 03:48:26,260
I think it will see me at this crate over on the right here.

5487
03:48:29,740 --> 03:48:31,320
I guess we'll just try it though.

5488
03:48:36,790 --> 03:48:37,310
Oh!

5489
03:48:37,570 --> 03:48:38,350
Just kidding.

5490
03:48:39,990 --> 03:48:40,790
Just kidding.

5491
03:48:41,390 --> 03:48:41,670
Hahaha!

5492
03:48:43,410 --> 03:48:44,750
I got another battery.

5493
03:48:44,830 --> 03:48:45,690
What are these batteries for?

5494
03:48:48,750 --> 03:48:49,270
Oh!

5495
03:48:49,550 --> 03:48:51,110
Oh, I thought it would hide...

5496
03:48:53,630 --> 03:48:55,690
I was behind the other crates!

5497
03:48:55,690 --> 03:48:57,610
Oh, these crates don't count, I guess.

5498
03:48:57,830 --> 03:48:58,250
Okay.

5499
03:48:58,670 --> 03:48:59,530
Good to know.

5500
03:49:00,290 --> 03:49:01,250
Good to know.

5501
03:49:01,250 --> 03:49:02,690
These crates don't count.

5502
03:49:02,890 --> 03:49:04,190
Just the red ones count.

5503
03:49:08,250 --> 03:49:09,070
It's okay though.

5504
03:49:09,850 --> 03:49:11,250
Those crates are too short.

5505
03:49:12,370 --> 03:49:13,490
Yeah, clearly.

5506
03:49:14,170 --> 03:49:14,850
Okay.

5507
03:49:15,030 --> 03:49:16,590
Let's grab that battery.

5508
03:49:17,810 --> 03:49:19,190
Let's put on our suit.

5509
03:49:20,750 --> 03:49:21,430
Okay.

5510
03:49:23,370 --> 03:49:24,050
Zachart!

5511
03:49:24,050 --> 03:49:25,190
Thanks for the five gifted!

5512
03:49:25,430 --> 03:49:25,970
Thank you!

5513
03:49:26,870 --> 03:49:27,550
Hahaha.

5514
03:49:28,830 --> 03:49:29,510
Okay.

5515
03:49:34,020 --> 03:49:34,700
Yeah.

5516
03:49:34,940 --> 03:49:35,500
Alright.

5517
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:36,720
So, don't...

5518
03:49:36,720 --> 03:49:37,700
Don't risk it.

5519
03:49:37,900 --> 03:49:38,140
Hahaha.

5520
03:49:45,720 --> 03:49:46,400
Okay.

5521
03:49:46,460 --> 03:49:47,960
Don't get greedy now.

5522
03:49:48,500 --> 03:49:49,300
That's what's in here.

5523
03:49:51,340 --> 03:49:52,320
Another office!

5524
03:49:52,660 --> 03:49:53,520
Oh, sorry.

5525
03:49:53,620 --> 03:49:55,060
I'm like covering most of the screen here.

5526
03:49:56,300 --> 03:49:57,320
A map!

5527
03:49:57,840 --> 03:49:59,380
Alpha building map.

5528
03:50:06,060 --> 03:50:07,180
Alpha Kenny.

5529
03:50:10,040 --> 03:50:10,880
Wait, wait.

5530
03:50:11,180 --> 03:50:11,900
Wait, wait.

5531
03:50:12,100 --> 03:50:13,700
Just in case.

5532
03:50:16,500 --> 03:50:17,060
Into?

5533
03:50:20,960 --> 03:50:21,480
Oh.

5534
03:50:22,860 --> 03:50:23,680
The doctor?

5535
03:50:24,560 --> 03:50:25,080
Guard?

5536
03:50:27,060 --> 03:50:27,580
Ship?

5537
03:50:28,300 --> 03:50:28,820
Doctor.

5538
03:50:29,020 --> 03:50:30,040
We ran into doctor.

5539
03:50:30,960 --> 03:50:31,760
Doctor, right?

5540
03:50:31,840 --> 03:50:32,640
Two detectors!

5541
03:50:33,440 --> 03:50:34,340
Oh, just kidding.

5542
03:50:37,460 --> 03:50:37,980
Oh.

5543
03:50:39,460 --> 03:50:39,980
Oh.

5544
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:42,100
Is this possible?

5545
03:50:42,560 --> 03:50:43,080
Oh.

5546
03:50:44,520 --> 03:50:45,040
Yeah.

5547
03:50:45,040 --> 03:50:45,560
Nevermind.

5548
03:50:46,180 --> 03:50:46,700
Hahaha.

5549
03:50:47,600 --> 03:50:48,840
Can I take this out?

5550
03:50:48,880 --> 03:50:49,240
Is this...

5551
03:50:49,960 --> 03:50:50,520
controlling all of them?

5552
03:50:52,120 --> 03:50:52,440
No.

5553
03:50:53,180 --> 03:50:53,740
Okay.

5554
03:50:55,540 --> 03:50:56,100
Hahaha.

5555
03:51:08,500 --> 03:51:09,880
Who are you?

5556
03:51:10,080 --> 03:51:10,460
Oh!

5557
03:51:10,620 --> 03:51:12,560
I didn't see them up there!

5558
03:51:12,900 --> 03:51:13,820
Hold on, mister!

5559
03:51:14,000 --> 03:51:14,480
Save me!

5560
03:51:14,640 --> 03:51:15,580
Mister, save me!

5561
03:51:16,700 --> 03:51:18,500
You wouldn't shoot your comrade!

5562
03:51:18,780 --> 03:51:19,060
Hahaha.

5563
03:51:22,420 --> 03:51:24,840
I got so distracted by the guy.

5564
03:51:25,780 --> 03:51:28,860
Redo and try S-H-S-H-P?

5565
03:51:29,880 --> 03:51:30,420
Why?

5566
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:33,660
It won't let me redo it.

5567
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:34,620
This is the save point.

5568
03:51:35,260 --> 03:51:36,200
What does it show?

5569
03:51:36,300 --> 03:51:37,620
What does it do anyway, though?

5570
03:51:39,680 --> 03:51:40,220
Ahem.

5571
03:51:48,430 --> 03:51:49,630
A bunch of sheep?

5572
03:51:49,850 --> 03:51:50,230
Hahaha.

5573
03:51:51,490 --> 03:51:52,030
Oh.

5574
03:51:53,080 --> 03:51:54,250
I'll have to look it up online.

5575
03:51:55,950 --> 03:51:56,490
Hello!

5576
03:51:56,910 --> 03:51:58,790
You scared me!

5577
03:52:00,790 --> 03:52:01,330
Yeah.

5578
03:52:01,530 --> 03:52:02,410
Yeah, me neither.

5579
03:52:03,330 --> 03:52:04,790
My name's Mike.

5580
03:52:05,110 --> 03:52:06,150
And you are?

5581
03:52:06,370 --> 03:52:07,290
I'm Mike.

5582
03:52:07,490 --> 03:52:08,090
Maintenance.

5583
03:52:08,270 --> 03:52:09,450
Mike Maintenance!

5584
03:52:09,810 --> 03:52:13,190
But our damn officer kept me here the whole night fixing stuff.

5585
03:52:13,470 --> 03:52:13,650
Mmm.

5586
03:52:13,870 --> 03:52:14,910
What an asshole.

5587
03:52:15,350 --> 03:52:21,990
I'm gonna kick his ass so hard, he'll drop his level 3 access card and be stuck in this building.

5588
03:52:22,190 --> 03:52:23,350
Where's his office?

5589
03:52:23,650 --> 03:52:23,890
Hahaha.

5590
03:52:23,890 --> 03:52:24,410
Really?

5591
03:52:24,690 --> 03:52:25,290
Wow!

5592
03:52:25,930 --> 03:52:27,350
It's right behind you.

5593
03:52:27,490 --> 03:52:28,550
That's the door.

5594
03:52:28,750 --> 03:52:29,270
Okay.

5595
03:52:29,430 --> 03:52:30,150
The one with the lasers.

5596
03:52:33,330 --> 03:52:33,910
Deadly lasers.

5597
03:52:34,210 --> 03:52:37,270
That you're gonna deactivate for me.

5598
03:52:37,670 --> 03:52:39,690
Well, maybe another time then.

5599
03:52:40,270 --> 03:52:40,890
Hold on.

5600
03:52:41,130 --> 03:52:46,850
If we generate a small power surge, in the right circuit, those lasers will shut down.

5601
03:52:47,130 --> 03:52:47,590
Great.

5602
03:52:48,010 --> 03:52:48,910
Let's do it.

5603
03:52:49,230 --> 03:52:51,210
I'll need at least 12 batteries.

5604
03:52:51,430 --> 03:52:53,550
We keep them in the boxes on this floor.

5605
03:52:53,870 --> 03:52:55,130
You get the batteries.

5606
03:52:55,330 --> 03:52:56,450
I'll prepare the surge.

5607
03:52:56,450 --> 03:52:57,690
Wait, how many batteries do we have?

5608
03:52:59,050 --> 03:53:01,070
We have only 4 batteries!

5609
03:53:02,030 --> 03:53:03,310
We need 12 of them?

5610
03:53:03,330 --> 03:53:03,490
We need 12 of them!

5611
03:53:05,010 --> 03:53:05,590
Okay.

5612
03:53:05,670 --> 03:53:06,070
Hold on.

5613
03:53:06,110 --> 03:53:09,650
I'm trying to eat my onigiri, but try not to get it everywhere on me.

5614
03:53:09,950 --> 03:53:09,950
Hahaha.

5615
03:53:10,750 --> 03:53:11,330
Um...

5616
03:53:14,730 --> 03:53:15,310
Hmm...

5617
03:53:15,310 --> 03:53:17,310
This is... this is a good one.

5618
03:53:19,250 --> 03:53:19,830
Hmm...

5619
03:53:21,170 --> 03:53:23,410
I ate too much of myself.

5620
03:53:24,070 --> 03:53:25,010
This team.

5621
03:53:28,830 --> 03:53:29,410
Hmm...

5622
03:53:33,660 --> 03:53:34,240
Um...

5623
03:53:34,240 --> 03:53:37,840
If I choke, I know how to do a solo Heimlich removal.

5624
03:53:39,900 --> 03:53:41,400
I'll build a car with them.

5625
03:53:42,300 --> 03:53:42,780
Hmm...

5626
03:53:42,780 --> 03:53:43,180
Hmm...

5627
03:53:49,780 --> 03:53:50,740
More batteries.

5628
03:53:53,660 --> 03:53:54,540
More batteries!

5629
03:53:57,600 --> 03:53:58,720
Well, this one... wait.

5630
03:53:59,060 --> 03:54:00,720
From here, it can't see me, right?

5631
03:54:02,560 --> 03:54:03,040
Yeah.

5632
03:54:06,520 --> 03:54:07,780
Okay, we're already at 7.

5633
03:54:08,600 --> 03:54:09,000
Nice.

5634
03:54:11,420 --> 03:54:11,820
Hmm...

5635
03:54:13,920 --> 03:54:14,320
Hmm...

5636
03:54:15,820 --> 03:54:17,780
I don't think we can get this middle one.

5637
03:54:17,880 --> 03:54:18,220
Can we?

5638
03:54:19,320 --> 03:54:19,860
Oh, wait.

5639
03:54:19,900 --> 03:54:20,500
Maybe from here.

5640
03:54:21,260 --> 03:54:21,940
From right here.

5641
03:54:25,160 --> 03:54:26,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5642
03:54:26,840 --> 03:54:27,240
Okay.

5643
03:54:28,140 --> 03:54:28,740
That's 8?

5644
03:54:31,220 --> 03:54:31,620
Um...

5645
03:54:35,330 --> 03:54:35,930
Hmm...

5646
03:54:40,060 --> 03:54:40,660
Hmm...

5647
03:54:40,660 --> 03:54:41,740
Hmm...

5648
03:54:42,640 --> 03:54:44,540
I think we can get this top one up here.

5649
03:54:48,140 --> 03:54:48,740
Nice.

5650
03:54:52,100 --> 03:54:52,700
9...

5651
03:54:56,900 --> 03:54:57,500
9...

5652
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:01,900
Could we maybe?

5653
03:55:02,740 --> 03:55:04,040
You think it's risky?

5654
03:55:04,980 --> 03:55:06,960
You think it's risky trying for this one?

5655
03:55:07,460 --> 03:55:08,620
Bottom one too?

5656
03:55:09,520 --> 03:55:10,180
Wait, in here?

5657
03:55:12,040 --> 03:55:12,560
Oh, wait!

5658
03:55:12,660 --> 03:55:13,520
We can get this one right...

5659
03:55:13,520 --> 03:55:15,020
Wait, though I think this is a...

5660
03:55:16,820 --> 03:55:17,780
Yeah, this is bullets.

5661
03:55:20,900 --> 03:55:21,280
Um...

5662
03:55:23,460 --> 03:55:24,640
Save before you try?

5663
03:55:24,800 --> 03:55:25,600
Yeah, let's try that.

5664
03:55:26,060 --> 03:55:28,040
We have two parties, so you know, whatever.

5665
03:55:30,080 --> 03:55:30,880
Oh my gosh.

5666
03:55:30,900 --> 03:55:31,960
I almost just ran out.

5667
03:55:33,420 --> 03:55:34,800
Did you guys see that?

5668
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:36,220
I almost just ran out.

5669
03:55:36,220 --> 03:55:36,300
I almost just ran out.

5670
03:55:38,400 --> 03:55:39,440
Okay, uh...

5671
03:55:39,440 --> 03:55:39,960
No.

5672
03:55:44,810 --> 03:55:45,950
Oh, come on!

5673
03:55:50,580 --> 03:55:51,600
Come on!

5674
03:55:53,560 --> 03:55:55,820
No, shooting the boxes doesn't work either.

5675
03:55:57,200 --> 03:55:58,840
What other ones can we get?

5676
03:55:59,280 --> 03:55:59,380
What other ones can we get?

5677
03:56:00,700 --> 03:56:03,040
Wait, maybe I can stand on the...

5678
03:56:03,040 --> 03:56:03,220
Wait, maybe I can stand on the...

5679
03:56:03,220 --> 03:56:04,340
side here.

5680
03:56:04,920 --> 03:56:06,720
You know, like against the wall.

5681
03:56:06,900 --> 03:56:08,220
Like this, kinda.

5682
03:56:10,700 --> 03:56:11,140
Oh.

5683
03:56:12,580 --> 03:56:13,020
Nice.

5684
03:56:14,200 --> 03:56:14,640
Okay.

5685
03:56:14,980 --> 03:56:17,260
And then maybe I can also punch this one.

5686
03:56:18,600 --> 03:56:19,040
Nice!

5687
03:56:19,320 --> 03:56:19,760
Okay.

5688
03:56:20,460 --> 03:56:20,900
Eleven.

5689
03:56:21,000 --> 03:56:21,340
One more!

5690
03:56:21,500 --> 03:56:22,220
One more, you guys.

5691
03:56:22,280 --> 03:56:22,960
One more, one more.

5692
03:56:25,700 --> 03:56:26,140
Um...

5693
03:56:31,160 --> 03:56:32,980
Maybe I can stand...

5694
03:56:33,840 --> 03:56:35,540
here and punch one of these?

5695
03:56:37,320 --> 03:56:37,760
Maybe

5696
03:56:55,360 --> 03:56:55,800
I can stand...

5697
03:56:55,800 --> 03:56:57,060
This one had nothing, so...

5698
03:56:57,060 --> 03:56:57,440
Oh!

5699
03:57:03,500 --> 03:57:04,440
Don't come here!

5700
03:57:09,860 --> 03:57:11,880
I'll take at least one of you out...

5701
03:57:11,880 --> 03:57:12,680
before I go!

5702
03:57:17,600 --> 03:57:18,560
Okay, uh...

5703
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:21,040
Okay.

5704
03:57:21,580 --> 03:57:22,280
This one.

5705
03:57:22,440 --> 03:57:23,200
The top box.

5706
03:57:23,320 --> 03:57:23,500
Yeah.

5707
03:57:26,560 --> 03:57:27,040
Um...

5708
03:57:28,440 --> 03:57:28,920
Okay.

5709
03:57:29,360 --> 03:57:29,980
That's one.

5710
03:57:30,480 --> 03:57:30,940
Okay.

5711
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:31,480
We just need...

5712
03:57:31,600 --> 03:57:31,900
two more.

5713
03:57:33,320 --> 03:57:34,320
Which there were... Oh!

5714
03:57:34,380 --> 03:57:35,340
Was it the ones in here?

5715
03:57:37,940 --> 03:57:39,200
Yeah, this should be good then.

5716
03:57:39,560 --> 03:57:40,200
These two.

5717
03:57:49,270 --> 03:57:49,730
Yippee!

5718
03:57:52,090 --> 03:57:52,550
Okay.

5719
03:57:57,170 --> 03:57:58,090
We're all...

5720
03:57:58,090 --> 03:57:58,730
good.

5721
03:57:59,850 --> 03:58:00,770
We're gouda.

5722
03:58:04,670 --> 03:58:05,130
Okay.

5723
03:58:05,130 --> 03:58:06,010
Hello mister!

5724
03:58:08,350 --> 03:58:09,150
Yeah Mike?

5725
03:58:09,290 --> 03:58:10,010
I got you, Mike.

5726
03:58:11,370 --> 03:58:12,570
Okay, Mike.

5727
03:58:13,110 --> 03:58:14,930
Okay, Mike.

5728
03:58:14,930 --> 03:58:15,330
And...

5729
03:58:15,330 --> 03:58:15,970
Oh!

5730
03:58:16,550 --> 03:58:17,410
His hair!

5731
03:58:17,770 --> 03:58:18,050
...

5732
03:58:22,350 --> 03:58:24,450
Oh wait, maybe he never had any hair.

5733
03:58:24,850 --> 03:58:25,450
...

5734
03:58:26,550 --> 03:58:27,150
...

5735
03:58:27,150 --> 03:58:27,370
...

5736
03:58:30,050 --> 03:58:31,650
Oh my God, they just...

5737
03:58:31,650 --> 03:58:31,670
...

5738
03:58:31,670 --> 03:58:32,050
...

5739
03:58:38,670 --> 03:58:43,630
They just, they became, yeah, so flaccid.

5740
03:58:45,090 --> 03:58:47,550
The office door.

5741
03:58:52,010 --> 03:58:53,570
Yes, sir.

5742
03:58:55,110 --> 03:58:56,350
No, sir.

5743
03:58:57,920 --> 03:58:58,930
Yes, sir.

5744
03:58:59,070 --> 03:59:00,290
No, sir.

5745
03:59:02,690 --> 03:59:03,490
Yes, sir.

5746
03:59:05,590 --> 03:59:06,310
Uh-oh.

5747
03:59:06,430 --> 03:59:08,350
They're not talking about our buddy Mike over there.

5748
03:59:08,470 --> 03:59:09,410
Mike Maintenance, huh?

5749
03:59:15,330 --> 03:59:18,890
Why can a level 2 access card come in here?

5750
03:59:26,050 --> 03:59:27,090
Mike Maintenance.

5751
03:59:27,530 --> 03:59:28,250
Oh no.

5752
03:59:30,010 --> 03:59:30,530
Yeah.

5753
03:59:32,050 --> 03:59:32,410
Damn, Robert.

5754
03:59:32,770 --> 03:59:34,970
It looks like you're in some big shit, pal.

5755
03:59:35,170 --> 03:59:35,490
Oh no.

5756
03:59:35,670 --> 03:59:40,210
I've been listening to some radio comms and does the doctor sound familiar to you?

5757
03:59:40,310 --> 03:59:40,630
The doctor.

5758
03:59:40,810 --> 03:59:41,270
Fuck yes.

5759
03:59:41,550 --> 03:59:41,910
Why?

5760
03:59:42,670 --> 03:59:44,390
Because I heard that someone is going to arrest him for treason.

5761
03:59:44,390 --> 03:59:44,950
That's my girl.

5762
03:59:45,230 --> 03:59:47,670
I have to stop them.

5763
03:59:47,690 --> 03:59:48,190
No, doctor.

5764
03:59:48,190 --> 03:59:48,750
Be careful, Fox.

5765
03:59:48,930 --> 03:59:49,470
Don't panic.

5766
03:59:49,850 --> 03:59:51,590
This shot could be a trap.

5767
03:59:52,070 --> 03:59:53,990
Robert's call made my head spin.

5768
03:59:54,370 --> 03:59:56,830
I left the office as fast as I could.

5769
03:59:57,270 --> 04:00:00,510
It took me less than two minutes to reach the sick bed.

5770
04:00:00,650 --> 04:00:00,930
Oh no.

5771
04:00:01,990 --> 04:00:02,590
Dang it.

5772
04:00:02,870 --> 04:00:03,590
Oh, okay.

5773
04:00:04,670 --> 04:00:05,450
Yes, yes, yes.

5774
04:00:05,850 --> 04:00:06,330
Understood.

5775
04:00:06,750 --> 04:00:07,230
Okay.

5776
04:00:07,610 --> 04:00:08,090
Okay.

5777
04:00:08,690 --> 04:00:11,630
You guys are blocking the timer, but there is a timer.

5778
04:00:15,830 --> 04:00:16,310
Oh.

5779
04:00:17,630 --> 04:00:18,110
Yep.

5780
04:00:18,470 --> 04:00:19,290
Oh, shoot.

5781
04:00:19,350 --> 04:00:19,750
Wrong way.

5782
04:00:19,970 --> 04:00:20,450
Gosh.

5783
04:00:22,190 --> 04:00:23,810
What do you mean the doctor's a guy?

5784
04:00:24,310 --> 04:00:24,790
What?

5785
04:00:27,630 --> 04:00:28,470
We're running.

5786
04:00:30,210 --> 04:00:30,770
We're running.

5787
04:00:30,770 --> 04:00:31,190
Running.

5788
04:00:31,290 --> 04:00:31,610
Running.

5789
04:00:32,770 --> 04:00:33,330
Oh.

5790
04:00:38,670 --> 04:00:40,050
He said arrest.

5791
04:00:40,250 --> 04:00:40,430
Oh.

5792
04:00:40,670 --> 04:00:41,790
What is happening here?

5793
04:00:42,750 --> 04:00:44,370
What's going on here?

5794
04:00:45,150 --> 04:00:45,710
Wait.

5795
04:00:45,870 --> 04:00:46,350
What do I do here?

5796
04:00:48,130 --> 04:00:48,690
Wait.

5797
04:00:49,810 --> 04:00:49,970
Oh.

5798
04:00:52,070 --> 04:00:52,630
Gosh.

5799
04:00:54,990 --> 04:00:55,390
No!

5800
04:00:57,390 --> 04:00:57,790
Oh.

5801
04:01:00,190 --> 04:01:01,950
Maybe I have to lure them out.

5802
04:01:02,710 --> 04:01:03,110
Okay.

5803
04:01:03,170 --> 04:01:03,610
Just kidding.

5804
04:01:07,110 --> 04:01:07,510
Uh.

5805
04:01:07,510 --> 04:01:10,570
The game is trying to foil my plans.

5806
04:01:10,650 --> 04:01:10,930
There we go.

5807
04:01:11,070 --> 04:01:11,470
Okay.

5808
04:01:12,270 --> 04:01:14,750
We have to probably like coin them out or something.

5809
04:01:16,190 --> 04:01:16,590
Um.

5810
04:01:19,220 --> 04:01:19,620
Wait.

5811
04:01:19,800 --> 04:01:20,420
Will they?

5812
04:01:20,520 --> 04:01:20,760
Oh.

5813
04:01:20,780 --> 04:01:22,460
Maybe they won't see because of the box though.

5814
04:01:23,860 --> 04:01:25,080
What else do we have?

5815
04:01:25,180 --> 04:01:25,980
We'll figure it out.

5816
04:01:26,160 --> 04:01:27,660
We'll figure it out once we're there.

5817
04:01:28,020 --> 04:01:28,540
I'm sure.

5818
04:01:29,180 --> 04:01:29,980
Fish and mail.

5819
04:01:30,080 --> 04:01:30,380
Yeah.

5820
04:01:30,460 --> 04:01:30,680
Yeah.

5821
04:01:30,680 --> 04:01:30,920
Yeah.

5822
04:01:30,920 --> 04:01:31,300
Hahaha.

5823
04:01:32,740 --> 04:01:33,140
Oh.

5824
04:01:33,420 --> 04:01:33,820
Um.

5825
04:01:37,020 --> 04:01:37,420
Oh.

5826
04:01:40,950 --> 04:01:42,330
The molotov.

5827
04:01:43,110 --> 04:01:44,430
That's what I was thinking.

5828
04:01:44,630 --> 04:01:45,030
But.

5829
04:01:45,730 --> 04:01:47,050
They see me immediately.

5830
04:01:48,730 --> 04:01:49,130
So.

5831
04:01:49,310 --> 04:01:51,270
It's kind of hard to throw it.

5832
04:01:51,350 --> 04:01:51,630
I think.

5833
04:01:52,590 --> 04:01:56,190
I was hoping that I could lure them down and take them out without causing an alert.

5834
04:01:56,370 --> 04:01:56,670
You know?

5835
04:01:58,870 --> 04:02:00,210
I will try the coin.

5836
04:02:01,950 --> 04:02:02,650
Just cause.

5837
04:02:04,770 --> 04:02:05,290
Okay.

5838
04:02:05,470 --> 04:02:06,250
Never mind.

5839
04:02:06,650 --> 04:02:06,690
Hahaha.

5840
04:02:07,850 --> 04:02:08,370
Um.

5841
04:02:10,350 --> 04:02:12,130
The molotov it is, baby.

5842
04:02:15,990 --> 04:02:16,510
Wait.

5843
04:02:16,910 --> 04:02:17,910
How do I use it?

5844
04:02:18,030 --> 04:02:18,370
Oh.

5845
04:02:27,660 --> 04:02:29,920
This stream inspired me to commission something.

5846
04:02:29,940 --> 04:02:31,080
Oh golly.

5847
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:31,520
I'm scared.

5848
04:02:31,760 --> 04:02:32,560
What are you going to commission?

5849
04:02:32,860 --> 04:02:33,300
Hahaha.

5850
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:35,560
Oh gosh.

5851
04:02:36,080 --> 04:02:36,560
See.

5852
04:02:36,760 --> 04:02:37,160
There we go.

5853
04:02:37,260 --> 04:02:37,500
Okay.

5854
04:02:41,060 --> 04:02:42,140
I kept punching.

5855
04:02:42,360 --> 04:02:42,980
It's not punch.

5856
04:02:43,180 --> 04:02:43,640
It's space.

5857
04:02:44,180 --> 04:02:45,660
Just like with the gun and stuff.

5858
04:02:48,000 --> 04:02:49,180
That's my streamer.

5859
04:02:49,320 --> 04:02:49,800
Hahaha.

5860
04:02:49,860 --> 04:02:50,940
I raised her.

5861
04:02:51,100 --> 04:02:52,580
I raised that streamer.

5862
04:02:52,820 --> 04:02:53,300
Hahaha.

5863
04:02:56,300 --> 04:02:56,780
Ah.

5864
04:02:57,520 --> 04:02:58,000
Okay.

5865
04:02:58,100 --> 04:02:58,320
Run.

5866
04:02:58,440 --> 04:02:58,560
Run.

5867
04:02:58,580 --> 04:02:58,860
Run.

5868
04:02:59,080 --> 04:02:59,560
Run.

5869
04:02:59,640 --> 04:02:59,940
Run.

5870
04:03:00,120 --> 04:03:00,600
Run.

5871
04:03:01,020 --> 04:03:01,320
Run.

5872
04:03:02,240 --> 04:03:02,720
No.

5873
04:03:02,720 --> 04:03:02,960
No.

5874
04:03:13,800 --> 04:03:14,280
Okay.

5875
04:03:20,760 --> 04:03:21,780
They're still here.

5876
04:03:21,920 --> 04:03:22,420
Oh my gosh.

5877
04:03:22,540 --> 04:03:22,900
Punch.

5878
04:03:23,140 --> 04:03:23,620
Punch.

5879
04:03:23,960 --> 04:03:24,440
Punch.

5880
04:03:24,560 --> 04:03:24,680
Oh.

5881
04:03:25,520 --> 04:03:27,160
I can't punch in the thing.

5882
04:03:27,820 --> 04:03:29,120
How do I...

5883
04:03:30,020 --> 04:03:31,140
Go inside the door?

5884
04:03:31,240 --> 04:03:33,460
I don't have the key card for it.

5885
04:03:33,680 --> 04:03:34,300
Oh wait.

5886
04:03:34,560 --> 04:03:35,040
Unless...

5887
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:36,320
This one.

5888
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:38,640
Nope.

5889
04:03:40,380 --> 04:03:40,860
No.

5890
04:03:40,900 --> 04:03:42,340
We don't have the level 3 key card.

5891
04:03:42,500 --> 04:03:43,180
Oh my god.

5892
04:03:47,380 --> 04:03:47,900
Nope.

5893
04:03:47,900 --> 04:03:50,160
We can't shoot boxes to destroy them.

5894
04:03:50,240 --> 04:03:51,100
We've already tried that.

5895
04:03:52,520 --> 04:03:53,040
Uh.

5896
04:03:54,580 --> 04:03:55,420
Other doors.

5897
04:03:55,620 --> 04:03:56,360
There's other doors?

5898
04:03:56,980 --> 04:03:58,080
Check around the office.

5899
04:04:00,860 --> 04:04:01,380
Okay.

5900
04:04:02,180 --> 04:04:02,700
Okay.

5901
04:04:03,280 --> 04:04:03,800
Okay.

5902
04:04:04,060 --> 04:04:05,680
We'll check around the office first.

5903
04:04:07,860 --> 04:04:08,780
Let me see.

5904
04:04:09,820 --> 04:04:11,680
Because I don't want to alert them.

5905
04:04:11,720 --> 04:04:12,060
You know?

5906
04:04:14,020 --> 04:04:14,560
Oh.

5907
04:04:16,370 --> 04:04:16,770
Punch.

5908
04:04:16,890 --> 04:04:17,090
Punch.

5909
04:04:17,190 --> 04:04:17,470
Punch.

5910
04:04:18,470 --> 04:04:19,010
Punch.

5911
04:04:19,510 --> 04:04:20,050
Punch.

5912
04:04:20,050 --> 04:04:20,430
Punch.

5913
04:04:20,430 --> 04:04:20,730
Punch.

5914
04:04:21,770 --> 04:04:24,590
I don't think there's anything really in here you guys.

5915
04:04:25,350 --> 04:04:26,490
I don't think so.

5916
04:04:27,490 --> 04:04:28,710
I don't think so.

5917
04:04:29,870 --> 04:04:31,050
I don't think so.

5918
04:04:33,350 --> 04:04:33,890
Uh.

5919
04:04:34,090 --> 04:04:34,330
Let's see.

5920
04:04:39,230 --> 04:04:40,690
Is this a vent?

5921
04:04:43,810 --> 04:04:44,350
No.

5922
04:04:45,130 --> 04:04:45,770
Oh my gosh.

5923
04:04:46,110 --> 04:04:47,190
Good thing he didn't turn around.

5924
04:04:47,310 --> 04:04:48,570
He would have noticed I'm a fake mic.

5925
04:04:48,870 --> 04:04:50,010
We only have less than a minute.

5926
04:04:50,150 --> 04:04:50,930
We're not even going to make it.

5927
04:04:55,030 --> 04:04:55,550
Let's see.

5928
04:04:55,650 --> 04:04:58,230
We can use this time to discover any other possibilities.

5929
04:05:01,410 --> 04:05:02,450
What was in here?

5930
04:05:05,310 --> 04:05:05,670
Uh.

5931
04:05:05,970 --> 04:05:07,350
Another room that I ransacked.

5932
04:05:09,010 --> 04:05:09,570
Uh.

5933
04:05:15,230 --> 04:05:17,650
There's a vent somewhere that lets you skip the blockade.

5934
04:05:17,730 --> 04:05:18,050
This one?

5935
04:05:19,550 --> 04:05:20,110
No.

5936
04:05:22,370 --> 04:05:23,150
This one?

5937
04:05:25,330 --> 04:05:25,890
No.

5938
04:05:29,080 --> 04:05:30,480
I can't go through there.

5939
04:05:31,480 --> 04:05:32,040
Okay.

5940
04:05:32,040 --> 04:05:32,900
Okay.

5941
04:05:35,360 --> 04:05:35,880
Oh.

5942
04:05:36,580 --> 04:05:37,260
I can't.

5943
04:05:37,260 --> 04:05:39,080
While I'm wearing it, I can't.

5944
04:05:39,760 --> 04:05:42,560
While you're wearing it, you can't throw the ball at Tom's either.

5945
04:05:45,480 --> 04:05:46,000
Yeah.

5946
04:05:46,060 --> 04:05:46,920
Let's radio and see.

5947
04:05:47,840 --> 04:05:48,920
And maybe advise.

5948
04:05:49,500 --> 04:05:51,060
You sound exhausted.

5949
04:05:51,260 --> 04:05:52,160
What's the sitrep?

5950
04:05:52,480 --> 04:05:54,120
I'm heading to the sickbay.

5951
04:05:54,480 --> 04:05:56,520
They're about to arrest my contact.

5952
04:05:57,180 --> 04:05:58,200
Stop it.

5953
04:05:58,200 --> 04:05:58,880
It could be a trap.

5954
04:05:59,160 --> 04:06:00,180
What if it's not?

5955
04:06:00,520 --> 04:06:01,940
I have to help her.

5956
04:06:02,040 --> 04:06:03,700
She is expendable.

5957
04:06:03,840 --> 04:06:05,080
There is no vent.

5958
04:06:05,180 --> 04:06:05,620
Oh my god!

5959
04:06:05,660 --> 04:06:07,300
Who's trying to one-guy me then?

5960
04:06:07,720 --> 04:06:09,360
Someone's trying to one-guy me.

5961
04:06:09,400 --> 04:06:09,700
For real.

5962
04:06:09,760 --> 04:06:11,480
Nothing you say is going to change my mind.

5963
04:06:11,860 --> 04:06:14,360
For god's sakes, don't rush in blind.

5964
04:06:14,500 --> 04:06:15,240
Oh my god.

5965
04:06:15,260 --> 04:06:16,020
Take extreme caution.

5966
04:06:17,360 --> 04:06:19,460
Someone's actually trying to... trying to...

5967
04:06:21,940 --> 04:06:23,520
To one-guy me.

5968
04:06:25,660 --> 04:06:26,860
How dare you.

5969
04:06:28,800 --> 04:06:29,840
How actually...

5970
04:06:29,840 --> 04:06:32,540
How dare you just spread lies on the internet.

5971
04:06:33,160 --> 04:06:37,940
You have to have the dev come in and correct your dumb ass.

5972
04:06:38,300 --> 04:06:39,420
You're just wrong.

5973
04:06:41,180 --> 04:06:42,560
You skipped one room.

5974
04:06:42,680 --> 04:06:44,840
This one also has nothing in here you guys.

5975
04:06:45,800 --> 04:06:47,360
And I will prove it to you.

5976
04:06:47,400 --> 04:06:48,420
There's nothing in here.

5977
04:06:55,060 --> 04:06:55,580
Okay.

5978
04:06:56,540 --> 04:06:57,060
Okay.

5979
04:06:58,500 --> 04:06:59,420
Take it off.

5980
04:06:59,980 --> 04:07:00,920
Taking it off.

5981
04:07:01,740 --> 04:07:02,260
Molotov.

5982
04:07:04,560 --> 04:07:05,160
Space!

5983
04:07:07,860 --> 04:07:08,540
Run!

5984
04:07:23,480 --> 04:07:25,160
Why is there going to be so many guys?

5985
04:07:32,220 --> 04:07:34,940
The beeping is driving me insane.

5986
04:07:36,900 --> 04:07:38,660
I'm going to turn it down just a little bit.

5987
04:07:40,480 --> 04:07:41,160
Yeah!

5988
04:07:45,310 --> 04:07:45,990
Yeah!

5989
04:07:46,830 --> 04:07:46,930
Yeah!

5990
04:07:46,930 --> 04:07:47,430
Yeah!

5991
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:48,850
Yeah!

5992
04:07:51,530 --> 04:07:52,470
Blah, blah, blah.

5993
04:07:53,610 --> 04:07:55,130
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

5994
04:08:02,380 --> 04:08:03,100
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

5995
04:08:03,100 --> 04:08:04,780
Punch, punch.

5996
04:08:04,940 --> 04:08:05,460
Oh, shit.

5997
04:08:05,500 --> 04:08:06,140
Punch, punch, punch.

5998
04:08:06,640 --> 04:08:07,280
Punch, punch, punch.

5999
04:08:09,280 --> 04:08:10,480
I'm going to bleed out and die.

6000
04:08:17,090 --> 04:08:18,570
I don't think this is possible.

6001
04:08:19,670 --> 04:08:20,950
I don't think this is possible.

6002
04:08:32,540 --> 04:08:33,340
The map?

6003
04:08:38,400 --> 04:08:38,920
Oh.

6004
04:08:40,300 --> 04:08:43,160
Wait, was that beep coming from inside the game?

6005
04:08:43,380 --> 04:08:44,100
I don't know.

6006
04:08:44,300 --> 04:08:45,640
Actually, the map.

6007
04:08:50,420 --> 04:08:51,340
Where are we?

6008
04:08:54,500 --> 04:08:55,740
We're on F3.

6009
04:08:58,060 --> 04:09:00,240
Yeah, we have to go the whole way.

6010
04:09:00,400 --> 04:09:00,460
We have to go around.

6011
04:09:01,740 --> 04:09:03,000
Because we don't have the card key.

6012
04:09:04,600 --> 04:09:05,000
So.

6013
04:09:06,400 --> 04:09:06,800
Yeah.

6014
04:09:11,100 --> 04:09:12,000
There's no other way.

6015
04:09:12,160 --> 04:09:12,960
We just got to go.

6016
04:09:14,680 --> 04:09:15,560
What's the yellow box?

6017
04:09:15,720 --> 04:09:17,520
I think that's documents, is it not?

6018
04:09:21,890 --> 04:09:22,290
Right?

6019
04:09:22,530 --> 04:09:23,910
I think that means documents.

6020
04:09:24,550 --> 04:09:27,310
Like the files that we got.

6021
04:09:30,250 --> 04:09:30,650
Oh.

6022
04:09:31,670 --> 04:09:32,070
So.

6023
04:09:32,150 --> 04:09:32,450
Oh.

6024
04:09:32,850 --> 04:09:33,250
Oh.

6025
04:09:34,290 --> 04:09:34,370
Nope.

6026
04:09:34,650 --> 04:09:34,890
Nope.

6027
04:09:36,350 --> 04:09:37,510
No, no, no, no, no.

6028
04:09:38,730 --> 04:09:39,710
No, no, no, no, no.

6029
04:09:42,310 --> 04:09:45,290
Shoot the guards and avoid alert by being real quick with the shooting part.

6030
04:09:45,450 --> 04:09:45,610
Okay.

6031
04:09:45,810 --> 04:09:47,610
Maybe the molotov is not the answer.

6032
04:09:47,670 --> 04:09:50,250
I thought the molotov would also destroy the boxes too.

6033
04:09:50,470 --> 04:09:50,830
But...

6034
04:09:53,310 --> 04:09:55,130
Doesn't seem to be the case.

6035
04:09:55,130 --> 04:09:55,410
Nice.

6036
04:10:12,870 --> 04:10:14,290
I wonder if...

6037
04:10:14,290 --> 04:10:15,230
Let's see.

6038
04:10:17,310 --> 04:10:17,830
Okay.

6039
04:10:17,830 --> 04:10:18,350
Shoot.

6040
04:10:18,430 --> 04:10:18,650
Shoot.

6041
04:10:20,070 --> 04:10:20,590
Okay.

6042
04:10:21,110 --> 04:10:21,630
Okay.

6043
04:10:23,690 --> 04:10:24,210
Oh.

6044
04:10:24,510 --> 04:10:32,090
Oh, I have to heal them.

6045
04:10:32,190 --> 04:10:32,790
Oh my gosh.

6046
04:10:32,790 --> 04:10:34,430
Oh, you guys are so needy.

6047
04:10:34,570 --> 04:10:36,150
You guys are so needy.

6048
04:10:36,450 --> 04:10:37,450
Oh my god.

6049
04:10:37,810 --> 04:10:38,570
Here you go.

6050
04:10:39,190 --> 04:10:39,870
Here you go.

6051
04:10:40,610 --> 04:10:41,310
Here you go.

6052
04:10:41,410 --> 04:10:42,350
Needy, needy.

6053
04:10:43,490 --> 04:10:44,490
There's always time to loot.

6054
04:10:44,730 --> 04:10:44,930
Okay.

6055
04:10:45,090 --> 04:10:46,450
Now we shoot again.

6056
04:10:49,110 --> 04:10:49,570
Ouch!

6057
04:10:50,030 --> 04:10:50,610
Dang it.

6058
04:10:51,010 --> 04:10:51,670
You know what?

6059
04:10:51,710 --> 04:10:52,210
Oh, no!

6060
04:10:54,470 --> 04:10:55,430
We'll just shoot everybody!

6061
04:10:56,090 --> 04:10:56,730
Just shoot!

6062
04:10:56,870 --> 04:10:56,950
Oh.

6063
04:10:57,550 --> 04:10:58,390
Including me.

6064
04:10:59,250 --> 04:10:59,710
Ahhh!

6065
04:11:01,950 --> 04:11:02,370
No!

6066
04:11:03,530 --> 04:11:07,130
Why is this harder than any of the bosses that I've gone through this entire time?

6067
04:11:08,490 --> 04:11:09,090
Oh, wait.

6068
04:11:09,170 --> 04:11:10,030
I think I still have it on.

6069
04:11:10,070 --> 04:11:10,250
Okay.

6070
04:11:10,550 --> 04:11:10,970
Run!

6071
04:11:12,330 --> 04:11:13,550
Oh my gosh.

6072
04:11:14,150 --> 04:11:15,970
Mike is not gonna know anything, you guys.

6073
04:11:15,990 --> 04:11:16,350
It's okay.

6074
04:11:16,590 --> 04:11:17,070
This is...

6075
04:11:17,070 --> 04:11:18,130
You just have to go through it.

6076
04:11:18,210 --> 04:11:20,510
There's nothing else that you gotta do except just do it.

6077
04:11:22,970 --> 04:11:24,490
This Mike doesn't know anything.

6078
04:11:28,710 --> 04:11:29,130
Run.

6079
04:11:29,130 --> 04:11:29,550
Run.

6080
04:11:29,710 --> 04:11:31,150
Run, run, run, run, run.

6081
04:11:31,730 --> 04:11:33,550
Run, run, run, run, run.

6082
04:11:33,690 --> 04:11:35,650
There's no secret passage in the office.

6083
04:11:35,750 --> 04:11:36,330
No, no.

6084
04:11:36,670 --> 04:11:38,230
You need a key card.

6085
04:11:38,890 --> 04:11:42,630
I don't think people are watching the game before commenting.

6086
04:11:44,550 --> 04:11:47,850
I don't think you guys are properly opening your eyes.

6087
04:11:48,010 --> 04:11:48,510
You know?

6088
04:11:49,030 --> 04:11:50,010
It's okay though.

6089
04:11:50,090 --> 04:11:53,710
Let's just attach this while we're at it.

6090
04:11:53,790 --> 04:11:54,630
And boom!

6091
04:11:54,750 --> 04:11:55,070
Boom!

6092
04:11:55,310 --> 04:11:55,790
Okay.

6093
04:11:55,890 --> 04:11:57,110
Punch, punch, punch, punch.

6094
04:11:57,870 --> 04:11:58,810
Punch, punch, punch.

6095
04:12:00,150 --> 04:12:01,050
Okie dokie.

6096
04:12:01,450 --> 04:12:02,650
And you too.

6097
04:12:02,870 --> 04:12:03,370
Okay.

6098
04:12:03,490 --> 04:12:05,950
And this one, I have to be like hella quick.

6099
04:12:06,470 --> 04:12:06,990
So...

6100
04:12:07,710 --> 04:12:07,970
Run!

6101
04:12:08,110 --> 04:12:08,530
Punch!

6102
04:12:10,410 --> 04:12:10,930
Okay.

6103
04:12:10,930 --> 04:12:11,890
I'm also bleeding.

6104
04:12:12,090 --> 04:12:13,030
So, first me.

6105
04:12:13,190 --> 04:12:14,570
I'm the more important one.

6106
04:12:15,410 --> 04:12:16,710
And I'll get you guys.

6107
04:12:16,950 --> 04:12:17,870
I'll get you guys.

6108
04:12:18,190 --> 04:12:18,670
Okay.

6109
04:12:19,310 --> 04:12:19,870
Let's go.

6110
04:12:25,030 --> 04:12:26,070
And down.

6111
04:12:27,270 --> 04:12:28,750
Are there more guards?

6112
04:12:28,950 --> 04:12:29,710
Please, I know.

6113
04:12:30,430 --> 04:12:31,870
Oh, let's reload too.

6114
04:12:32,290 --> 04:12:33,810
Before I continue onward.

6115
04:12:37,350 --> 04:12:38,870
We only got 40 seconds!

6116
04:12:41,050 --> 04:12:41,870
Okay, okay, okay.

6117
04:12:42,490 --> 04:12:43,450
30 seconds!

6118
04:12:45,010 --> 04:12:45,870
Please, potty.

6119
04:12:45,950 --> 04:12:46,450
Oh, you know what?

6120
04:12:46,470 --> 04:12:46,970
You're so smart.

6121
04:12:53,930 --> 04:12:54,890
Just kidding!

6122
04:12:58,110 --> 04:12:58,990
No, relaxation!

6123
04:13:01,790 --> 04:13:02,670
No, relaxation!

6124
04:13:02,970 --> 04:13:03,070
No, relaxation!

6125
04:13:03,070 --> 04:13:03,910
Oh my gosh, 25 seconds.

6126
04:13:04,130 --> 04:13:05,810
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

6127
04:13:05,930 --> 04:13:06,230
No!

6128
04:13:08,190 --> 04:13:09,050
There they were.

6129
04:13:09,770 --> 04:13:10,690
Robert was right.

6130
04:13:11,390 --> 04:13:14,230
Those bastards were going to arrest their own doctor.

6131
04:13:14,450 --> 04:13:14,870
Oh my god.

6132
04:13:15,110 --> 04:13:15,810
Sons of bitches.

6133
04:13:16,310 --> 04:13:18,030
I wasn't going to let it happen.

6134
04:13:18,230 --> 04:13:18,470
Yeah.

6135
04:13:20,190 --> 04:13:21,430
I'm going in blasting!

6136
04:13:22,890 --> 04:13:23,670
We did it!

6137
04:13:23,670 --> 04:13:26,950
As I got close, I could hear shouting from inside.

6138
04:13:27,150 --> 04:13:31,090
Then I remembered what Robert told me about being careful.

6139
04:13:31,430 --> 04:13:33,450
I held back my urge to kill.

6140
04:13:33,670 --> 04:13:35,690
And listened to the conversation.

6141
04:13:35,710 --> 04:13:36,290
We're listening.

6142
04:13:36,490 --> 04:13:38,950
Why did you give him your access card?

6143
04:13:39,110 --> 04:13:40,170
I didn't.

6144
04:13:40,170 --> 04:13:41,810
He took it from my jacket.

6145
04:13:42,170 --> 04:13:44,210
But you did nothing to stop it.

6146
04:13:44,410 --> 04:13:46,070
This is high treason.

6147
04:13:46,130 --> 04:13:48,370
You're in deep shit, Dr. Hoffman.

6148
04:13:49,030 --> 04:13:49,550
Hoffman.

6149
04:13:49,550 --> 04:13:50,490
Dr. Hoffman.

6150
04:13:50,690 --> 04:13:52,130
I'm surprised, Mr. Fox.

6151
04:13:52,310 --> 04:13:53,990
You managed to remember a surname.

6152
04:13:54,350 --> 04:13:56,830
Well, I had a neighbor named Hoffman.

6153
04:13:56,970 --> 04:13:57,990
Big German man.

6154
04:13:58,250 --> 04:13:59,070
Very hairy.

6155
04:13:59,450 --> 04:14:00,590
Very hairy.

6156
04:14:01,090 --> 04:14:03,970
He was planning to retire, but his gonorrhea had other plans.

6157
04:14:04,010 --> 04:14:04,330
What?

6158
04:14:04,910 --> 04:14:05,470
Fascinating.

6159
04:14:05,690 --> 04:14:07,150
What does that imply?

6160
04:14:07,710 --> 04:14:08,010
Sure.

6161
04:14:08,310 --> 04:14:09,610
Where was I?

6162
04:14:10,130 --> 04:14:11,410
This is high treason.

6163
04:14:11,530 --> 04:14:11,850
You're in deep shit, Dr. Hoffman.

6164
04:14:11,850 --> 04:14:13,370
He had to keep working because of his gonorrhea?

6165
04:14:13,730 --> 04:14:14,290
Good.

6166
04:14:14,430 --> 04:14:16,290
Just testing if you were listening.

6167
04:14:19,550 --> 04:14:22,430
Stop a man that knocked out all your guards?

6168
04:14:22,610 --> 04:14:24,330
Are you really that stupid?

6169
04:14:24,710 --> 04:14:25,450
So true.

6170
04:14:25,670 --> 04:14:27,290
Dare insult my intelligence.

6171
04:14:27,370 --> 04:14:29,070
Speak your truth, truth queen.

6172
04:14:29,430 --> 04:14:30,170
I know you gave him medical attention.

6173
04:14:30,630 --> 04:14:32,790
How many wounded have you healed, Lieutenant?

6174
04:14:33,310 --> 04:14:34,050
I'll tell you.

6175
04:14:34,110 --> 04:14:34,630
None.

6176
04:14:35,290 --> 04:14:35,570
Why?

6177
04:14:36,030 --> 04:14:39,090
Because your job is to be a paper pushing butter bar.

6178
04:14:39,330 --> 04:14:42,310
Mine, on the other hand, is to heal and attend.

6179
04:14:42,590 --> 04:14:44,310
To anyone who needs it.

6180
04:14:44,430 --> 04:14:45,410
Shut up, you guys.

6181
04:14:45,590 --> 04:14:46,250
Even if that doesn't heal my family.

6182
04:14:46,850 --> 04:14:50,490
Aiding the enemy in this base is treason.

6183
04:14:50,630 --> 04:14:53,590
My oath has no restrictions on who I must heal.

6184
04:14:53,830 --> 04:14:55,050
You want to arrest me?

6185
04:14:55,150 --> 04:14:56,230
Then tell me, Lieutenant.

6186
04:14:56,530 --> 04:15:00,550
Who is going to save the lives of your soldiers if I'm in a cell?

6187
04:15:01,190 --> 04:15:01,710
You?

6188
04:15:02,290 --> 04:15:06,290
A man so incompetent that a prisoner is running circles around him?

6189
04:15:06,550 --> 04:15:07,790
How dare you?

6190
04:15:08,050 --> 04:15:11,770
Now stop pestering me and get the hell out of my sickbay.

6191
04:15:12,170 --> 04:15:13,770
This isn't the end, Doctor.

6192
04:15:13,850 --> 04:15:14,930
You're on thin ice.

6193
04:15:15,130 --> 04:15:15,770
Oh, she's on thin ice.

6194
04:15:16,330 --> 04:15:18,010
She's one badass doctor.

6195
04:15:18,270 --> 04:15:18,470
Yeah.

6196
04:15:19,550 --> 04:15:20,070
Hide!

6197
04:15:23,370 --> 04:15:25,830
Going in was not a good idea.

6198
04:15:26,230 --> 04:15:26,330
Oh.

6199
04:15:27,490 --> 04:15:28,010
What?

6200
04:15:29,210 --> 04:15:30,070
Oh, okay.

6201
04:15:30,150 --> 04:15:30,630
I made it.

6202
04:15:30,930 --> 04:15:34,830
And off he went, taking the level 3 card with him.

6203
04:15:34,870 --> 04:15:35,690
You're so rude!

6204
04:15:35,930 --> 04:15:38,530
I needed that card if I wanted to get out of this building.

6205
04:15:38,990 --> 04:15:42,590
But before that, I had to check if the doctor was okay.

6206
04:15:43,590 --> 04:15:45,190
See if the doctor's alright.

6207
04:15:45,330 --> 04:15:45,690
See if the doctor's alright.

6208
04:15:46,250 --> 04:15:46,510
Doc?

6209
04:15:47,250 --> 04:15:48,330
Doc, you good?

6210
04:15:49,550 --> 04:15:51,090
Doctor, are you alright?

6211
04:15:51,470 --> 04:15:52,590
Why do you ask?

6212
04:15:52,850 --> 04:15:54,750
I found out you were going to be arrested.

6213
04:15:55,090 --> 04:15:56,950
So I ran here to help.

6214
04:15:57,110 --> 04:15:58,570
But I heard people shouting.

6215
04:15:58,830 --> 04:16:00,990
And I saw those men walking out.

6216
04:16:01,330 --> 04:16:02,930
That's Lieutenant Marcuson.

6217
04:16:02,990 --> 04:16:04,690
All bark and no brain.

6218
04:16:04,890 --> 04:16:06,630
I can't stand that moron.

6219
04:16:06,810 --> 04:16:07,390
Really?

6220
04:16:08,070 --> 04:16:09,390
I couldn't tell.

6221
04:16:09,710 --> 04:16:13,790
But once he speaks to General X, I'll have some serious problems.

6222
04:16:14,290 --> 04:16:16,110
You've dragged me into quite a mess.

6223
04:16:16,890 --> 04:16:17,710
Sorry, Doc.

6224
04:16:17,990 --> 04:16:19,710
I didn't mean to cause you trouble.

6225
04:16:20,190 --> 04:16:21,390
Yeah, I know.

6226
04:16:21,670 --> 04:16:24,470
Anyway, thanks for worrying about me.

6227
04:16:25,150 --> 04:16:26,070
It's what I do.

6228
04:16:26,330 --> 04:16:26,870
Plus one experience.

6229
04:16:26,870 --> 04:16:28,910
That Marcuson has a level 3 card on him.

6230
04:16:29,030 --> 04:16:31,810
I'll understand if I see him in my sickbay later.

6231
04:16:32,110 --> 04:16:33,430
You read my mind.

6232
04:16:33,850 --> 04:16:35,150
See you around, Doc.

6233
04:16:35,470 --> 04:16:36,070
Hang on.

6234
04:16:38,450 --> 04:16:39,590
What is that?

6235
04:16:39,950 --> 04:16:40,430
Oh!

6236
04:16:41,890 --> 04:16:43,170
Wait, what?

6237
04:16:44,450 --> 04:16:44,970
Ouch!

6238
04:16:46,410 --> 04:16:47,270
Deja vu!

6239
04:16:47,630 --> 04:16:49,110
What the hell were you doing?

6240
04:16:49,330 --> 04:16:51,070
I was leaning in for a hug.

6241
04:16:51,250 --> 04:16:52,510
With your eyes closed?

6242
04:16:52,670 --> 04:16:54,530
And you said kiss out loud.

6243
04:16:54,950 --> 04:16:56,950
Sorry, let's never speak of this again.

6244
04:16:57,630 --> 04:16:58,610
I'm by me.

6245
04:16:58,790 --> 04:16:59,850
You look tired.

6246
04:17:00,090 --> 04:17:01,510
Take these first aid kits.

6247
04:17:03,810 --> 04:17:05,870
Oh, she loaded me up!

6248
04:17:06,050 --> 04:17:06,910
Thank you, Doctor.

6249
04:17:08,050 --> 04:17:10,910
If you shoot him, don't let him bleed to death.

6250
04:17:11,110 --> 04:17:13,630
I'll be executed as an accomplice if he dies.

6251
04:17:14,230 --> 04:17:14,950
Now go.

6252
04:17:15,290 --> 04:17:17,050
Catch him before he exits the building.

6253
04:17:18,610 --> 04:17:19,470
Thank you.

6254
04:17:20,150 --> 04:17:21,030
Bye-bye.

6255
04:17:21,690 --> 04:17:23,310
I think that was negative Riz.

6256
04:17:23,490 --> 04:17:23,670
No!

6257
04:17:23,910 --> 04:17:24,950
Oh no, no, no!

6258
04:17:25,090 --> 04:17:25,950
We have another timer!

6259
04:17:26,190 --> 04:17:26,810
Oh my god.

6260
04:17:29,210 --> 04:17:30,490
Oh, that was fast.

6261
04:17:30,610 --> 04:17:37,810
Isn't the slippery, cowardly pet of that traitorous bitch Are you trying to call me like a slippery creature?

6262
04:17:38,430 --> 04:17:40,090
Something that like slides around?

6263
04:17:40,490 --> 04:17:42,290
I'm in charge of enforcing curfew.

6264
04:17:42,290 --> 04:17:45,350
You try to grab it and it just like slides out of your hands.

6265
04:17:45,370 --> 04:17:46,570
Really slippery Slytherin.

6266
04:17:47,770 --> 04:17:51,230
There are too many hideouts for a mutt like you.

6267
04:17:51,490 --> 04:17:52,470
Python Pete.

6268
04:17:54,250 --> 04:17:57,310
Now it's just you and us, mutt.

6269
04:17:57,390 --> 04:18:00,530
You can't run and you can't hide.

6270
04:18:00,830 --> 04:18:00,850
Oh!

6271
04:18:01,890 --> 04:18:03,110
Lieutenant Markison!

6272
04:18:05,310 --> 04:18:05,950
Oh!

6273
04:18:08,210 --> 04:18:08,530
Oh!

6274
04:18:09,510 --> 04:18:09,770
Oh!

6275
04:18:13,660 --> 04:18:14,280
Oh my god.

6276
04:18:14,340 --> 04:18:14,520
Wait!

6277
04:18:14,620 --> 04:18:15,160
No, no, no!

6278
04:18:15,280 --> 04:18:16,060
That's not what I meant to do!

6279
04:18:16,360 --> 04:18:22,140
You can dodge bullets by rolling.

6280
04:18:23,300 --> 04:18:24,820
That's such a good thing to say.

6281
04:18:26,520 --> 04:18:27,460
Skip, skip, skip.

6282
04:18:28,780 --> 04:18:29,660
That was so fast.

6283
04:18:37,550 --> 04:18:39,270
I think they can...

6284
04:18:39,270 --> 04:18:40,730
I think they deserve it.

6285
04:18:40,790 --> 04:18:41,390
I'm not gonna lie.

6286
04:18:48,420 --> 04:18:48,900
Whoa!

6287
04:18:50,460 --> 04:18:52,140
Me doing that saved my butt.

6288
04:18:53,380 --> 04:18:54,600
Me like saving them?

6289
04:18:54,820 --> 04:18:56,860
I dodged his bullets because of...

6290
04:18:56,860 --> 04:18:58,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

6291
04:18:59,700 --> 04:19:00,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

6292
04:19:10,320 --> 04:19:11,060
Oh my god.

6293
04:19:11,180 --> 04:19:12,540
Can he follow my blood trail?

6294
04:19:14,940 --> 04:19:15,420
Ouch.

6295
04:19:24,640 --> 04:19:25,320
Come on.

6296
04:19:26,720 --> 04:19:27,640
He's fast.

6297
04:19:27,760 --> 04:19:28,440
He's really fast.

6298
04:19:30,160 --> 04:19:32,740
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6299
04:19:32,840 --> 04:19:33,040
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6300
04:19:33,040 --> 04:19:36,200
I wonder if old dogs can learn new tricks.

6301
04:19:36,580 --> 04:19:36,600
I wonder if old dogs can learn new tricks.

6302
04:19:36,600 --> 04:19:37,240
What are you gonna do to me?

6303
04:19:37,260 --> 04:19:38,840
Let's see you chew your way through lasers.

6304
04:19:39,160 --> 04:19:39,560
Lasers?

6305
04:19:43,620 --> 04:19:44,660
What lasers?

6306
04:19:45,240 --> 04:19:45,760
No!

6307
04:19:47,540 --> 04:19:50,360
Luckily the cabinet in the sickbay was full of them.

6308
04:19:51,180 --> 04:19:53,000
That doesn't help me very much.

6309
04:19:55,520 --> 04:19:57,380
That doesn't help me very much.

6310
04:19:57,380 --> 04:19:57,440
That doesn't help me very much.

6311
04:19:57,620 --> 04:19:58,140
That doesn't help me very much.

6312
04:19:59,040 --> 04:19:59,900
Oh my god.

6313
04:20:04,280 --> 04:20:04,720
Ouch!

6314
04:20:04,780 --> 04:20:05,660
Oh god.

6315
04:20:14,280 --> 04:20:14,720
Okay.

6316
04:20:14,860 --> 04:20:16,520
I'm just gonna have to let those guys bleed.

6317
04:20:16,640 --> 04:20:18,180
If I let them bleed out...

6318
04:20:19,040 --> 04:20:20,540
I'll probably get a bad end.

6319
04:20:21,580 --> 04:20:23,440
The doctor will be so mad at me.

6320
04:20:25,320 --> 04:20:27,140
The doctor will be so mad at me.

6321
04:20:28,020 --> 04:20:28,900
The doctor will be so mad at me.

6322
04:20:29,280 --> 04:20:31,860
The doctor will be so mad at me.

6323
04:20:31,860 --> 04:20:32,380
Punch the guards.

6324
04:20:32,680 --> 04:20:34,160
Yeah, let's do CQC instead.

6325
04:20:35,200 --> 04:20:36,460
Let's do CQC instead.

6326
04:20:36,940 --> 04:20:37,640
If I can.

6327
04:20:39,520 --> 04:20:40,460
Skip, skip, skip.

6328
04:20:40,580 --> 04:20:41,760
Okay, and V...

6329
04:20:41,760 --> 04:20:44,060
I gotta move my placement so that I actually die.

6330
04:20:45,360 --> 04:20:46,080
Oh my god.

6331
04:20:46,100 --> 04:20:46,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

6332
04:20:48,440 --> 04:20:48,880
Oh!

6333
04:20:49,620 --> 04:20:50,280
Oh my god.

6334
04:20:51,280 --> 04:20:53,120
That wasn't... that didn't go very well.

6335
04:20:53,280 --> 04:20:54,760
That didn't... that didn't go... okay.

6336
04:20:56,360 --> 04:20:59,520
I moved my fingers over so I was pressing C instead.

6337
04:20:59,660 --> 04:20:59,920
Okay.

6338
04:21:01,000 --> 04:21:01,440
Okay.

6339
04:21:03,280 --> 04:21:03,670
Okay.

6340
04:21:04,660 --> 04:21:05,140
Okay.

6341
04:21:07,220 --> 04:21:08,260
Don't do this.

6342
04:21:09,110 --> 04:21:09,740
Oh my god.

6343
04:21:11,860 --> 04:21:12,640
Okay.

6344
04:21:13,560 --> 04:21:14,340
Perfect.

6345
04:21:15,380 --> 04:21:16,160
Okay.

6346
04:21:19,860 --> 04:21:21,260
This guy is so tough!

6347
04:21:24,000 --> 04:21:26,100
Because he's so fast, you know?

6348
04:21:27,640 --> 04:21:28,420
Okay.

6349
04:21:29,700 --> 04:21:31,300
He's so fast!

6350
04:21:32,200 --> 04:21:32,980
Oh!

6351
04:21:33,000 --> 04:21:33,700
Nice, nice, nice.

6352
04:21:36,820 --> 04:21:39,400
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6353
04:21:39,420 --> 04:21:39,640
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6354
04:21:39,640 --> 04:21:40,420
Yeah, I am.

6355
04:21:40,440 --> 04:21:41,860
Something lasers!

6356
04:21:42,200 --> 04:21:42,560
Okay.

6357
04:21:44,900 --> 04:21:46,260
Oh my god.

6358
04:21:47,280 --> 04:21:48,400
Oh my god.

6359
04:21:48,660 --> 04:21:49,600
This is unfair.

6360
04:21:49,840 --> 04:21:50,640
This is so unfair.

6361
04:22:14,120 --> 04:22:15,840
I would have died otherwise.

6362
04:22:15,920 --> 04:22:16,500
I was trapped.

6363
04:22:19,800 --> 04:22:21,500
I would have died otherwise.

6364
04:22:21,580 --> 04:22:22,260
I was trapped.

6365
04:22:31,120 --> 04:22:32,020
Oh my gosh.

6366
04:22:36,330 --> 04:22:42,540
Oh my gosh.

6367
04:22:43,140 --> 04:22:43,700
Oh my gosh.

6368
04:22:43,700 --> 04:22:43,940
Oh, whoops.

6369
04:22:55,230 --> 04:22:55,990
I'll take it.

6370
04:22:57,250 --> 04:23:00,510
Oh gosh!

6371
04:23:00,630 --> 04:23:01,450
How did you see me?

6372
04:23:01,710 --> 04:23:01,730
Oh gosh!

6373
04:23:01,730 --> 04:23:01,730
How did you see me?

6374
04:23:02,670 --> 04:23:05,870
I hate that just one bullet and I'm like bleeding.

6375
04:23:07,870 --> 04:23:09,490
I hate that just one bullet and I'm like bleeding.

6376
04:23:09,490 --> 04:23:10,110
There's no point in me taking the chance.

6377
04:23:10,330 --> 04:23:11,370
There's no point in me taking the chance.

6378
04:23:12,450 --> 04:23:12,950
Gosh!

6379
04:23:14,730 --> 04:23:17,110
He sees me so fast!

6380
04:23:17,950 --> 04:23:18,730
He turned around!

6381
04:23:19,030 --> 04:23:19,830
Like, immediately!

6382
04:23:20,150 --> 04:23:20,990
As soon as I...

6383
04:23:22,090 --> 04:23:23,570
As soon as I was there!

6384
04:23:27,030 --> 04:23:27,770
Oh my god!

6385
04:23:28,710 --> 04:23:29,210
Well,

6386
04:23:33,490 --> 04:23:33,970
everybody.

6387
04:23:36,350 --> 04:23:38,470
Those guys, they just didn't stand it.

6388
04:23:38,470 --> 04:23:40,730
They just weren't cut out for, you know...

6389
04:23:40,730 --> 04:23:43,190
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6390
04:23:44,530 --> 04:23:45,730
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6391
04:23:46,650 --> 04:23:47,350
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6392
04:23:47,390 --> 04:23:47,990
Oh.

6393
04:23:53,380 --> 04:23:53,980
No!

6394
04:23:59,480 --> 04:24:01,760
It's a game over if somebody dies!

6395
04:24:02,100 --> 04:24:03,720
It's a game over if somebody dies!

6396
04:24:06,060 --> 04:24:08,220
Oh my god!

6397
04:24:09,360 --> 04:24:09,500
Oh my god!

6398
04:24:09,760 --> 04:24:12,280
Clearly, we don't even end up with the doctor!

6399
04:24:12,840 --> 04:24:14,520
Clearly, we don't even end up with the doctor!

6400
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:14,660
Don't worry!

6401
04:24:27,640 --> 04:24:29,320
Oh my gosh!

6402
04:24:32,980 --> 04:24:34,300
No, no, no, no!

6403
04:24:39,520 --> 04:24:40,500
Oh my gosh!

6404
04:24:48,630 --> 04:24:50,770
His shot is so fast!

6405
04:24:51,630 --> 04:24:52,610
I swear!

6406
04:24:52,670 --> 04:24:54,150
His bullets are faster than mine!

6407
04:24:58,420 --> 04:25:00,440
His bullets are faster than me!

6408
04:25:03,580 --> 04:25:05,740
His bullets are faster than me!

6409
04:25:10,920 --> 04:25:13,320
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6410
04:25:13,520 --> 04:25:13,680
You're a tough little mongrel, aren't you?

6411
04:25:13,860 --> 04:25:14,340
Lasers!

6412
04:25:18,000 --> 04:25:18,800
Oh my gosh!

6413
04:25:18,860 --> 04:25:19,660
Oh my gosh!

6414
04:25:25,160 --> 04:25:26,680
Oh, that was so close!

6415
04:25:27,100 --> 04:25:27,980
Oh my gosh!

6416
04:25:28,020 --> 04:25:29,540
I have to just keep my distance at all?

6417
04:25:29,740 --> 04:25:30,420
Sometimes!

6418
04:25:31,480 --> 04:25:32,220
Oh my gosh!

6419
04:25:49,990 --> 04:25:50,670
Yippee!

6420
04:25:52,530 --> 04:25:54,030
Somehow we made that!

6421
04:25:55,890 --> 04:25:57,510
Somehow we made it!

6422
04:25:59,030 --> 04:25:59,710
No!

6423
04:26:03,410 --> 04:26:04,090
No!

6424
04:26:07,450 --> 04:26:08,130
Yippee!

6425
04:26:08,130 --> 04:26:08,530
You won't be able to beat us!

6426
04:26:08,530 --> 04:26:11,330
You will lie here on the ground until someone finds you.

6427
04:26:11,490 --> 04:26:15,630
Everyone will know that a single prisoner defeated you.

6428
04:26:15,650 --> 04:26:17,390
Everyone will know that a single prisoner defeated you.

6429
04:26:17,390 --> 04:26:18,730
You will be severely injured.

6430
04:26:19,230 --> 04:26:22,470
This guy can bleed out, but you know?

6431
04:26:22,630 --> 04:26:22,650
This guy can bleed out, but you know?

6432
04:26:23,670 --> 04:26:24,270
No!

6433
04:26:24,950 --> 04:26:25,550
No!

6434
04:26:31,730 --> 04:26:35,410
We can ran-sack him, give me a second.

6435
04:26:36,070 --> 04:26:37,450
Let's grab some bullets.

6436
04:26:37,450 --> 04:26:39,810
Let's... let's reload.

6437
04:26:41,610 --> 04:26:42,630
Not the woman.

6438
04:26:42,870 --> 04:26:43,450
Father's time!

6439
04:26:43,630 --> 04:26:44,470
Thanks for the five-gifter!

6440
04:26:45,030 --> 04:26:46,250
Let's take his card.

6441
04:26:52,190 --> 04:26:52,710
Yippee!

6442
04:26:53,430 --> 04:26:54,470
Leave the building.

6443
04:26:55,210 --> 04:26:56,170
With the doctor.

6444
04:27:00,290 --> 04:27:01,970
Yeah, we even had medkits left over.

6445
04:27:07,450 --> 04:27:08,290
You're still fuzzy, doctor.

6446
04:27:08,910 --> 04:27:09,710
That's expected.

6447
04:27:09,970 --> 04:27:11,410
You got hit pretty hard.

6448
04:27:11,610 --> 04:27:12,590
Doctor, lean in close.

6449
04:27:13,250 --> 04:27:15,890
My fight... I mean, my sight is still fuzzy.

6450
04:27:19,290 --> 04:27:21,230
My sight is still fuzzy, doctor.

6451
04:27:21,270 --> 04:27:22,150
I can't see anything.

6452
04:27:22,710 --> 04:27:24,890
I can't even speak, doctor, please.

6453
04:27:28,570 --> 04:27:29,210
Heal first?

6454
04:27:29,370 --> 04:27:30,050
I guess I should heal.

6455
04:27:30,230 --> 04:27:34,550
Yeah, yeah, let's heal and then we'll grab that extra one that I left in there.

6456
04:27:36,310 --> 04:27:37,310
Doctor, lean in close.

6457
04:27:37,910 --> 04:27:39,750
So I can see your face clearly.

6458
04:27:41,170 --> 04:27:43,370
Doctor, my ears are also fuzzy.

6459
04:27:43,570 --> 04:27:43,990
It hurts.

6460
04:27:44,350 --> 04:27:45,830
Doctor, come in close, doctor.

6461
04:27:54,230 --> 04:27:56,770
Can we actually just... oh yeah, there's the exit.

6462
04:27:57,610 --> 04:27:59,390
I completely forgot about this.

6463
04:28:00,530 --> 04:28:02,790
We just left this guy in the corner earlier.

6464
04:28:03,670 --> 04:28:06,490
I tried to open the door with the level three card.

6465
04:28:06,870 --> 04:28:07,270
And?

6466
04:28:07,450 --> 04:28:09,650
But the exit also had a biometric scanner.

6467
04:28:09,990 --> 04:28:10,190
No!

6468
04:28:10,450 --> 04:28:13,550
Which needed to scan your retina and your fingerprints.

6469
04:28:13,550 --> 04:28:14,590
Let's just go grab the guy.

6470
04:28:14,710 --> 04:28:18,030
In other words, only authorized people could open that door.

6471
04:28:18,170 --> 04:28:18,630
Let's go...

6472
04:28:18,630 --> 04:28:20,150
And I was not one of them.

6473
04:28:20,150 --> 04:28:20,990
Let's go grab that guy.

6474
04:28:21,810 --> 04:28:24,330
Press X twice over a guard to carry him.

6475
04:28:25,110 --> 04:28:26,710
Oh, you press it twice.

6476
04:28:26,770 --> 04:28:27,770
Is that how it works?

6477
04:28:30,470 --> 04:28:31,410
Let's go grab him.

6478
04:28:34,490 --> 04:28:35,870
Come here, give me your fingerprints.

6479
04:28:35,870 --> 04:28:37,790
I wish I still had that arm with me.

6480
04:28:39,750 --> 04:28:40,350
There we go.

6481
04:28:40,910 --> 04:28:43,210
I thought it was like a weird way of...

6482
04:28:43,210 --> 04:28:44,790
Okay, so just press X twice.

6483
04:28:44,850 --> 04:28:47,270
That's why it was sometimes working.

6484
04:28:53,630 --> 04:28:54,070
Wait.

6485
04:29:01,630 --> 04:29:02,070
No!

6486
04:29:02,270 --> 04:29:02,490
Wait!

6487
04:29:02,550 --> 04:29:03,210
The other doors!

6488
04:29:05,010 --> 04:29:06,230
Do I get to go back in?

6489
04:29:06,350 --> 04:29:07,650
I might be able to go back in.

6490
04:29:08,110 --> 04:29:08,730
Let's see.

6491
04:29:09,710 --> 04:29:10,550
Chapter four.

6492
04:29:10,630 --> 04:29:11,950
Welcome to the jungle.

6493
04:29:13,870 --> 04:29:15,030
I might be able to go back in.

6494
04:29:15,050 --> 04:29:16,830
I could finally breathe some fresh air.

6495
04:29:17,110 --> 04:29:17,330
Hold on.

6496
04:29:18,590 --> 04:29:20,210
The ground was untended.

6497
04:29:20,570 --> 04:29:22,270
Uneven grass covered the soil.

6498
04:29:23,550 --> 04:29:25,530
And the jungle was relentless.

6499
04:29:27,410 --> 04:29:28,850
Everything was dark.

6500
04:29:29,270 --> 04:29:31,190
Save for a light above the door.

6501
04:29:32,490 --> 04:29:34,090
Such immersive storytelling.

6502
04:29:35,430 --> 04:29:36,710
Oh, we cannot go.

6503
04:29:36,750 --> 04:29:37,690
Well, sorry guys.

6504
04:29:37,890 --> 04:29:38,430
I thought...

6505
04:29:39,310 --> 04:29:41,250
I truly thought that I...

6506
04:29:42,090 --> 04:29:42,710
I don't know.

6507
04:29:42,770 --> 04:29:43,350
I thought like...

6508
04:29:43,350 --> 04:29:46,470
I thought something was going to happen where you'd be like, Oh, dang it.

6509
04:29:46,530 --> 04:29:49,090
I got to the door and I actually couldn't go through it.

6510
04:29:49,210 --> 04:29:52,010
And, you know, I thought something like that would happen.

6511
04:29:52,670 --> 04:29:53,270
My bad.

6512
04:29:57,210 --> 04:29:59,170
No, I am fully aware.

6513
04:29:59,250 --> 04:30:00,570
I missed the level three doors.

6514
04:30:00,570 --> 04:30:01,150
But it's okay.

6515
04:30:01,650 --> 04:30:02,650
It's no biggie.

6516
04:30:05,310 --> 04:30:05,750
But...

6517
04:30:06,710 --> 04:30:09,030
Yeah, I think that's where I'll end it today.

6518
04:30:12,090 --> 04:30:14,090
And I will...

6519
04:30:14,650 --> 04:30:16,090
I already have it on the schedule.

6520
04:30:16,730 --> 04:30:17,850
When am I continuing?

6521
04:30:18,070 --> 04:30:18,750
Let me see.

6522
04:30:19,730 --> 04:30:20,990
When am I...

6523
04:30:20,990 --> 04:30:21,970
Let me go to my Twitter.

6524
04:30:23,170 --> 04:30:24,050
On Sunday.

6525
04:30:24,610 --> 04:30:25,790
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

6526
04:30:26,030 --> 04:30:27,030
We will continue.

6527
04:30:27,210 --> 04:30:28,790
Same time, same place.

6528
04:30:32,110 --> 04:30:33,070
We'll continue...

6529
04:30:33,070 --> 04:30:33,890
This?

6530
04:30:34,170 --> 04:30:34,610
I don't know.

6531
04:30:35,490 --> 04:30:41,750
I don't know if we'll beat it or if we'll get close to beating it since we didn't even get halfway through.

6532
04:30:44,090 --> 04:30:45,930
I don't know if the...

6533
04:30:45,930 --> 04:30:46,170
If...

6534
04:30:46,170 --> 04:30:48,150
Like I said, load last potty.

6535
04:30:48,710 --> 04:30:49,490
Wait a second.

6536
04:30:51,090 --> 04:30:52,350
How far along...

6537
04:30:52,350 --> 04:30:54,290
Wait, that was a long time ago, wasn't it?

6538
04:30:55,070 --> 04:30:56,490
You guys, the last potty...

6539
04:30:56,490 --> 04:30:56,890
Nevermind.

6540
04:30:57,450 --> 04:30:59,650
I think the last potty was a long time ago.

6541
04:30:59,650 --> 04:31:00,910
Otherwise, I would've checked it.

6542
04:31:04,890 --> 04:31:05,810
But that's okay.

6543
04:31:07,810 --> 04:31:09,010
Yeah, pre-boss fight.

6544
04:31:09,470 --> 04:31:10,430
Yeah, it was a...

6545
04:31:10,430 --> 04:31:12,950
I don't remember the last time I used it to be honest.

6546
04:31:13,450 --> 04:31:14,670
It was a long, long time ago.

6547
04:31:14,950 --> 04:31:16,230
Thank you.

6548
04:31:16,570 --> 04:31:17,310
Thank you, thank you.

6549
04:31:17,870 --> 04:31:19,190
It's when you were getting the batteries.

6550
04:31:19,350 --> 04:31:19,590
Oh.

6551
04:31:20,190 --> 04:31:20,590
Yeah.

6552
04:31:20,750 --> 04:31:21,370
Oh, yeah.

6553
04:31:21,390 --> 04:31:22,030
It was.

6554
04:31:22,070 --> 04:31:22,490
It was.

6555
04:31:22,790 --> 04:31:26,670
And so I would've had to do the chase, the timer again and everything.

6556
04:31:30,230 --> 04:31:31,510
But yeah.

6557
04:31:32,150 --> 04:31:32,950
Thank you.

6558
04:31:32,970 --> 04:31:33,250
Thank you.

6559
04:31:33,490 --> 04:31:37,810
This freaky phantom disappointed that Kurei wasn't at Nintendo Direct.

6560
04:31:38,590 --> 04:31:44,170
I can't even imagine them showing off something like that in the Direct.

6561
04:31:47,570 --> 04:31:48,690
Thank you, Chai Princess.

6562
04:31:49,270 --> 04:31:50,310
Try to remain calm.

6563
04:31:50,390 --> 04:31:54,050
I'm afraid Sunday also makes it nine years since the Phantom Pain release.

6564
04:31:54,250 --> 04:31:55,170
Nine years.

6565
04:31:56,250 --> 04:31:56,870
That's crazy.

6566
04:31:57,070 --> 04:31:59,690
The game is almost a decade old and still holds up so well.

6567
04:31:59,870 --> 04:32:00,750
That's so ancient.

6568
04:32:01,010 --> 04:32:04,670
I was going to say that's so awesome, but I almost said ancient.

6569
04:32:09,790 --> 04:32:11,110
Have a minty rest of your day.

6570
04:32:11,170 --> 04:32:11,690
Thank you guys!

6571
04:32:12,790 --> 04:32:13,810
Thank you, thank you!

6572
04:32:14,030 --> 04:32:16,530
It was really stinky, so it was nice to just watch you play a silly game.

6573
04:32:16,950 --> 04:32:18,310
Yeah, have fun!

6574
04:32:20,210 --> 04:32:27,510
Yeah, I'm going to go because I'm going to shower and then I want to go out and do some stuff before the typhoon comes.

6575
04:32:29,750 --> 04:32:34,210
I don't want to be holed up in my room for a long time.

6576
04:32:34,610 --> 04:32:36,290
I have plans this weekend.

6577
04:32:36,330 --> 04:32:40,990
I'm really hoping that the typhoon doesn't ruin my plans, but we'll see.

6578
04:32:41,230 --> 04:32:42,030
Hopefully not.

6579
04:32:42,110 --> 04:32:43,310
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

6580
04:32:43,810 --> 04:32:47,370
Otherwise, I'm going to be so sad because it was part of the only reason...

6581
04:32:47,370 --> 04:32:48,290
Well, it wasn't part of the only reason.

6582
04:32:48,310 --> 04:32:51,790
But it was part of the reason I came to Japan was for my plans.

6583
04:32:51,990 --> 04:32:56,850
So, if it gets cancelled, I'm going to be very, very, very sad.

6584
04:32:58,970 --> 04:33:01,830
Thank you guys for all the donations.

6585
04:33:01,990 --> 04:33:02,830
Thanks for all the super chats.

6586
04:33:03,170 --> 04:33:03,810
Thank you!

6587
04:33:04,210 --> 04:33:05,130
Thanks for the fun stream.

6588
04:33:05,210 --> 04:33:05,570
Thank you!

6589
04:33:06,490 --> 04:33:07,390
Thank you, thank you!

6590
04:33:09,750 --> 04:33:10,970
But, you know...

6591
04:33:12,010 --> 04:33:13,630
Life happens, I guess.

6592
04:33:13,830 --> 04:33:15,150
Or afterlife happens.

6593
04:33:15,550 --> 04:33:16,850
For me, in my case.

6594
04:33:17,770 --> 04:33:18,210
Asumita!

6595
04:33:18,470 --> 04:33:19,370
Thank you guys!

6596
04:33:19,530 --> 04:33:21,610
And I'll see you guys next time!

6597
04:33:23,030 --> 04:33:23,910
Bye-bye!

6598
04:33:24,110 --> 04:33:24,790
Bye-bye!

6599
04:33:25,150 --> 04:33:26,010
See you!

6600
04:33:26,430 --> 04:33:27,370
What's happening tomorrow?

6601
04:33:27,590 --> 04:33:28,210
I have a schedule!

6602
04:33:28,410 --> 04:33:29,930
You should go check it!

6603
04:33:30,570 --> 04:33:31,230
Yeah, yeah.

6604
04:33:31,370 --> 04:33:34,590
I think for Holocure, it'll probably be delayed one hour.

6605
04:33:35,810 --> 04:33:36,750
At the least.

6606
04:33:37,890 --> 04:33:38,330
Yeah.

6607
04:33:38,470 --> 04:33:39,350
So, yeah.

6608
04:33:39,590 --> 04:33:41,390
Check my schedule if you want to know what's going on.

6609
04:33:41,570 --> 04:33:42,010
Okay!

6610
04:33:42,150 --> 04:33:42,630
Bye-bye!

6611
04:33:42,750 --> 04:33:43,310
Bye-bye!

6612
04:33:43,310 --> 04:33:44,570
Bye-bye!
