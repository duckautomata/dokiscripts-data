34
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:45,640
complaint with it is it's really grindy and it's kind of
difficult solo I've been like playing some games by myself

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:55,200
like my own world by myself and it's yeah so I don't know
high tail ain't done yet I yeah I am really really looking

36
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:03,460
forward to them adding more stuff not that it's doesn't have
enough stuff already um but like seeing what else they add

37
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:18,360
to it so yeah how is portal oh my god oh my god i am playing
portal 2 right now to um record some some uh streams that i

38
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,240

streaming next month but they'll be just lesser stream so in

39
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:34,500
between the days that I can't stream I wanted to um have
some some playthrough for you and I I don't know I feel like

40
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,920
I might try and do a second game but it really depends on my
schedule because I feel like I'm kind of getting through the

41
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:48,540
game quickly I don't know maybe the chapters will be well
maybe it'll be longer in the end but hey me though I caught

42
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,860
a nasty cold yesterday and it's wearing me down today you

And then the feel better beam was so big, it covered the
entire earth and everybody felt better.

52
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,530
What was I gonna say?

53
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,270
I was gonna say...

54
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,210
Oh, Portal!

55
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh my gosh.

56
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,250
I'm on chapter 7 out of 9.

57
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,870
And I've only recorded four parts so far.

58
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,450
Four one-hour parts.

59
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:34,370
So I'm like, I thought that it would be, there's been a few
puzzles that have stumped me.

60
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,130
It's like one every part.

61
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:45,650
There's like one puzzle that I'm like, oh my gosh, there was
one yet, like there was one that, I was like, I don't get

62
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,830
it.

63
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,530
I don't know, how am I supposed to do this?

64
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,810
I was trying everything and I completely overlooked this
button that I needed to press and I felt so stupid.

65
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:04,890
so it's not super long yeah but a lot of the things said
like an average of eight to nine hours like that's the

66
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:17,530
average how long to be and i'm at chapter seven and i'm at
four hours in so i don't know i don't know you can edit it

67
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,610
out make and act like you're a genius no you're gonna have
to live through all of the suffering of me trying to figure

68
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:32,090
out these puzzles all on my own while you yell at screen and
you're like no vtuber do this and i can't hear you la la la

69
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:44,710

that was my birthday wish but happy birthday happy birthday

70
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,270
good fish and been listening to your karaoke of evermore on
loop this morning and the minto disney princess allegations

71
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:59,550

I love it, I love it.

74
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,430
Something about your voice is so mesmerizing.

75
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,730
Sometimes I focus so much on the voice that I miss what you
actually said.

76
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,930
That's what bonds are for, huh?

77
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,270
Really?

78
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,450
I actually don't like my voice so much, so...

79
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,330
If you guys like it, that's really good.

80
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:29,450
I mean, I would hope that you like it because you're
listening to it for a time so thanks for the healing beam

83
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:57,310
karaoke but i want to like i feel like i always do the same
songs and then i Like, I haven't had time.

84
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,590
I've been, like, practicing for the jazz show.

85
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,350
I don't know.

86
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,410
Like, I always sing the same songs.

87
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,410
But I've been just...

88
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,570
And also, I don't want to sing.

89
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,410
And, like, wear out my voice.

90
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,450
For the show.

91
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,630
So, I don't know.

92
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,490
But we like those same songs.

93
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,370
Yeah, me too.

94
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,790
That's why I keep singing them.

95
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,230
Yeah, so I love your voice.

96
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,910
How long did it take for those voice bags?

97
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,610
I know.

98
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,270
I know.

99
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,150
But, like, at the same time.

100
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,790
Oh, well.

101
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,590
I feel like that's so many people, though, that are just
like, Oh, I don't like my voice.

102
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,530
I don't like how it sounds.

103
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,390
I feel like that's a lot of people.

104
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,070
And I'm not talking about, like, a singing.

105
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,210
I'm talking about just, like, speaking and hanging out.

106
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,470
Oh, my gosh.

107
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:13,150
I've been having so many issues with my um my all a a I a I
oh I always want to call it an aoi but it's a aio and it's

108
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:22,830
because it's it like um flickers like crazy and it gets
pretty distracting when I'm streaming I'm like looking at it

109
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:30,290
right now but right now it's not flashing at all and you
usually it's only when my computer is like hardcore like

110
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:45,350
going crazy like pumping it up that that it stops flickering
your water cooling ai yeah yeah yeah it has like a little

111
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:53,610
screen on it and when i am when i am playing like it's so
funny because chilla's art games are notoriously unoptimized

112
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,350
So it's going to be like, it's going to be like, how old?

113
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,930
No, it's not old at all.

114
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,970
I got this maybe like a year and a half ago.

115
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,090
Where do I get tickets for your show me, though?

116
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,010

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,900
Pre-order it.

165
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,360
Because it comes out in July.

166
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,480
I will be moved.

167
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,480
I don't have a new address!

168
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,340
So I have to hope that...

169
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,700
I mean, I'm sure I'll be able to get her...

170
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,640
Some after.

171
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,200
I will.

172
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,660
But...

173
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,300
I'd have to wait a little bit.

174
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,680
I'd have to wait a little bit until I can get her.

175
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,580
Send it to a PO box.

176
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,100
Ship it to the dentist.

177
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,260
Send it to a PO box.

178
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,600
Ship it to the dentist.

179
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,900
I didn't even consider that.

180
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,740
I can make them ship it to me.

181
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,200
Wait a second, wait a second.

182
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,020
This is what having a manager is all about.

183
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,880
Actually, I applied for some tickets for an idol show.

184
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:49,800
And the only way that I could apply for the tickets was if I
said that I would pay at a convenience store.

185
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,580
Like at a convenience.

186
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,820
And obviously I'm not in Japan.

187
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:04,480
the moment so i cannot pay but i was like well this is what
having a manager is all about right ask vicky oh my god wait

Let's just play this damn game, okay!

195
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,920
Hopefully, hopefully it doesn't crash my computer.

196
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,260
Oh my gosh!

197
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,380

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,240
And then Nimi was just like, yeah, I cranked mine all the
way up.

No, I'm telling you.

216
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,900
Oh, let's see what it looks like.

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,300

FOV, you guys, FOV!

231
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,940
You know what?

232
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,480
Never mind.

233
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
A lot of you guys, I think, just don't understand.

234
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,860
Oh my god.

235
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,340
Anyway, let's fish.

236
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,020
Oh, these you can collect for money too.

237
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,920
Wait, how do I collect it for money?

238
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,160
Collect it for money.

239
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,080
How do I collect that?

240
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,840
Wait, that was totally a thing before I remember.

241
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,580
Did it just go, ugh!

242
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
Did she just go, ugh?

243
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,540
Maybe.

244
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,560
Why is the water like this?

245
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,060
Uh, cute.

246
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,920
Nah, did I just say 500 yen?

247
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Let's go.

248
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,400
I remember the bigger fish being over here.

249
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,040
You're my best field of view.

250
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,660
Let me go.

251
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
I like the view.

252
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,180
Ooh, that one was bloody.

253
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,820
They're my best.

254
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,000
I feel.

255
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,100
Isn't it feel the vision?

256
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,100
Wait, am I...

257
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,600
I thought it was a vision.

258
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,300
Wait, is it view?

259
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,440
Wait a second.

260
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,080
Which is it?

261
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,020
Aren't these pufferfish here?

262
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,800
Wait, I remember the puffer...

263
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,340
I blacked out.

264
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,780
I remember the pufferfish being ginormous.

265
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,500
Why is it so blurry?

266
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:46,980
though.

267
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,520
Do I need glasses or maybe I just don't know how to

268
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:02,440
stupid fisherman hasn't adjusted to the salt water doesn't
know how I can't open my eyes in in water.

269
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,320
Can you guys in salt water?

270
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,120
The

271
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,680
heck is going on here!

272
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,380
Guys, I think something paranormal is happening.

273
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,560
I think there are some people that can, right?

274
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:34,440
in salt water it's like it feels insane yes but it stings
wait I thought I could grab these before hmm wait there's

275
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:43,220
actually quite a few different stuff than the demo like all
of this over there was not there before oh oh

276
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:55,030
I'm pressing E but it just flips it over okay they took out
my extra money.

277
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,610
No!

278
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,530
I was making big bucks on the shelves!

279
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,570
No!

280
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:03,870
Oh!

281
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,050
There's just no propped for it.

282
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,590
Oh, you still can!

283
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,290
There's just no propped!

284
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,050
I'm silly.

285
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,210
She ate clams.

286
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,230
Not really a clam gal, though.

287
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,870
How could you miss?

288
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,410
Oh my gosh!

289
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,910
Right now we're just making the bucks.

290
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,440
Lie detected.

291
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,400
About clams?

292
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,920
No, I actually don't.

293
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,080
I'm really... I honestly just...

294
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,320
There's...

295
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm pretty picky about my seafood.

296
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,300
Mmm.

297
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,720
Alright, big fish.

298
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,300
Big fish coming in.

299
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,320
Big fish over here.

300
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,570
I guess we can...

301
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:15,710
Oh!

302
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,530
I was gonna say, I guess we don't need to breathe, but...

303
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Oh yeah.

304
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,580
Do you like crab sticks?

305
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,640
I like crab.

306
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm

307
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,570
like...

308
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,750
Um...

309
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,230
I'm kind of picky.

310
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,110
Oh.

311
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,150
Oh.

312
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,350
Oh wait, I know how to hunt.

313
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,670
Oh.

314
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,590
Hmm.

315
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,670
Leave it on the boat and I'll buy it.

316
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,830
Don't drive rough, though.

317
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,750
The fish will fall out.

318
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,150
You only find pufferfish.

319
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,970
That's a lie because I found more.

320
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,570
Bring me the goodies and I'll upgrade your boaty.

321
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,730
Bring me a load, all right?

322
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,290
Okay, okay.

323
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:17,930
Sell.

324
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,030
Yeah, see the tuna?

325
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,010
Nice.

326
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,650
Harpoon reel.

327
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,590
It says one out of one.

328
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,430
Maybe we should just upgrade these for now, then.

329
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,490
We'll upgrade all of our stuff first, like our harpoon
things first, and then we can get to the boat.

330
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,970
I'll hand over the map to you.

331
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,870
Make good use of it, all right?

332
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:46,990
Okay, thank you.

333
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,730
Oh, oh, thank you.

334
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,690
Open our clothes with M key.

335
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,690
So we got a refuel.

336
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,910
I'm going to sell some more stuff, though.

337
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,350
Yeah, don't forget fuel.

338
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,910
Minto's voice is unique.

339
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,670
You are on.

340
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,670
Whether singing, chattering, or shouting, idols chance.

341
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,930
Your voice energizes me.

342
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,990
Thank you!

343
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:17,350
I do hear that, though, that my voice is recognizable, which
is kind of fun.

344
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,330
What's up with the water here?

345
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,150
Like it's over there, too.

346
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,250
Acting all funky.

347
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,750
Wait, you think I can walk there?

348
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,730
It's all rock.

349
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,930
Let's try it.

350
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,970
Let's try it.

351
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,210
Yeah, seems shallow, right?

352
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,550
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

353
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,290
All right, we go put...

354
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,230
Oh, wait, I can sprint.

355
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,090
Sorry, I forgot that I could do that.

356
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,210
I was...

357
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,190
Since I've been playing Portal and you can't sprint, I
keep...

358
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,490
I was like, oh, I just don't need to hold down the button.

359
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,410
Oh!

360
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,010
Ah!

361
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,590
Oh, we were so close!

362
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:09,290
I think you do technically have, like, a breath, you know?

363
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,230
Like it's an invisible breath meter.

364
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,150
Not a weird dream like...

365
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,650
Oh, what a weird dream like game.

366
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,150
Random merchant on a tiny...

367
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,650
Tiny...

368
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,990
I can't speak today.

369
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,530
Tiny island just for you.

370
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,630
Gash pump in the sand.

371
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,690
Windmills for some reason.

372
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:31,310
It's honestly, if there weren't a horror game, I feel like
the aesthetic is like really nice.

373
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,730
The aesthetic for the game is like pretty nice, I'd say.

374
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,310
Okay.

375
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,170
cozy horror

376
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:57,370
it makes me I can't wait for summer it's so cold lately I'm
so cold I usually turn all my games to 110 FOV but I do have

377
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:02,310
friends that talk about lower FOV helping with their motion
sickness but this doesn't seem very bad to you guys right

378
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:13,530
I've turned off motion blur so I think it's not so bad I
feel like it's This is actually...

379
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:23,530
I'm telling you, if you see the different POVs from me and
Nimi, you'll understand probably what I'm talking about.

380
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,750
It seems... I think it was... Oops.

381
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,230
I think it was more dramatic in that game than it is in this
game.

382
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,830
Okay, I'm gonna jump.

383
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,090
Alright, we're gonna get a head start.

384
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,070
Watch this.

385
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:37,790
Ah!

386
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,610
Okay.

387
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,630
It hates us, it hates us.

388
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,510
Nice hot.

389
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,270
Thank you!

390
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,630
Can I go here?

391
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:50,930
No.

392
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,670
I'm testing all the boundaries of...

393
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,670
The game.

394
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,080
Excuse me!

395
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,600
Shop.

396
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,460
Sell.

397
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,760
How much is it to refill?

398
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,410
Ah!

399
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,610
Okay.

400
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,570
We could go to the shrine.

401
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,310
We could head out on the road.

402
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,230
We could...

403
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,070
Get driving.

404
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,270
Visit the...

405
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,910
Return to the last gas station you visited.

406
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,150
I think that gets rid of all of your stuff, though.

407
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:37,970
Oh, whoops.

408
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,070
I'm driving.

409
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,700
I think that gets rid of all the fish, though.

410
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,440
Oh!

411
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,740
We're about to go get ourselves a girl.

412
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,980
Are there any fish here?

413
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,360
Wow, clear.

414
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,580
Nice.

415
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,380
Hakure shrine.

416
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,680
So true.

417
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,080
So true.

418
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,120
Some of these fish are making sounds that I think are
suspicious.

419
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,560
I think that's puffer fish.

420
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,250
Wait a second, I think I see some bigger fish over here.

421
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,010
Some bigger fish to fry.

422
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,310
If you get sick from games, VR, or any sort of media, it
means your eyes...

423
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,250
Wait.

424
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,290
You use your eyes a lot for your sense of motion and
balance.

425
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,570
You can overcome this by blinding yourself.

426
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,370
I thought you had some actual advice here.

427
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,130
Those are normal fish noises.

428
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,910
True, I've been fishing.

429
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,010
before.

430
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,140
I was like, oh, this is good.

431
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Some people will need this advice, you know.

432
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,720
Oh my gosh, the blood is insane.

433
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,320
Can we jump out here?

434
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,400
Okay.

435
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,760
I learned.

436
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,860
But it's all rocks!

437
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,420
My boats are gonna get stuck!

438
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:31,620
Maybe I should have gone through the gate, like a proper I'm
a heathen at the moment.

439
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,760
Like, this is so nice.

440
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,740
This is so...

441
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,620
Like, the sounds of the ocean and...

442
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,120
Well, the girl's there.

443
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,200
She's asleep.

444
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,690
I'll turn it up for you guys soon.

445
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,950
More money.

446
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:58,910
And also...

447
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,070
Who is this?

448
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,470
It's... someone.

449
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,570
Pretty shells.

450
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,630
And some money.

451
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,290
I wonder if Doki is still going to be in these games.

452
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,430
The water is still kind of funky.

453
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,650
Alright.

454
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,630
Let's go get that girl.

455
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:29,690
Oh.

456
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,190
Oh.

457
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,950
I'm robbing the shrine.

458
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,230
It's probably really bad luck.

459
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:35,990
Bad luck.

460
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,530
Hello.

461
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,570
Hello.

462
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,310
Oh.

463
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,750
Are you okay?

464
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,030
I have to hurry to end the curse to get to that island as
soon as possible.

465
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,090
Who took the three stone tablet shards to fit into this
door?

466
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,090
I need them to open this door so that I can get to that
island.

467
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,130
I can't do this alone.

468
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,630
Will you help me?

469
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,570
I have to find the tablet.

470
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,590
Oh no, she's an iPad kid!

471
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,550
Oh, jeez.

472
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,950
Oh, is she on my boat?

473
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,110
Yeah, there she is.

474
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,710
Place three tablet shards into the shrine door near First
Island.

475
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,510
Oh, okay, so this is all new.

476
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,690
It's fun.

477
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,250
Oh, my God.

478
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,410
Our boat is so sensitive.

479
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,100
You're still there?

480
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,460
Okay, so are my fish?

481
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,540
Ma'am, we might take some detours to fish.

482
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,140
I'm just warning you now.

483
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,940
Especially as I see these big fish over here.

484
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,200
one moment mama needs money you

485
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:13,870
okay maybe she gets motion sickness too wait wait wait mama
needs money no no there oh that was don't worry about it

486
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,330
don't worry about the sound

487
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:26,450
oh no I hope that's not you.

488
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,050
Quick, pick up my harpoon.

489
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:31,810
Quick.

490
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,450
Uh-oh.

491
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,710
Here's some money, mama.

492
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,350
Thank you.

493
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,190
We're docking.

494
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,650
And we're leaving.

495
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,870
And hold on, I'm getting this fish over here first.

496
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,890
She's a professional, everybody.

497
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,570
She's a professional.

498
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,950
I kind of missed in the demo the fish were, like, so
unnaturally oversized.

499
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,170
What is this?

500
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,210
Apply paint!

501
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,310
What changed?

502
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,050
Oh!

503
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:21,870
Oh!

504
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,610
Oh!

505
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,450
Oh!

506
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,550
Oh, it's lovely!

507
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,730
I love Rush

508
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:44,990
Yeah About the fish here Seems like they're all puffer fish
and tuna around here Go catch a bunch for me, okay?

509
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:55,110
Okay, I thought he was gonna I thought I was asking about
the The anime boy and girl noises that they make Select all

510
00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:04,910
and sell baby sell All right, we need to really fill up our,
like, fuel capacity and speed and stuff, because that will

511
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,070
really hurt you.

512
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:12,670
So, as the ship speed increases, fuel consumption also
rises.

513
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,730
So what's the point, then?

514
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,290
Yeah, I was asking about the ooze.

515
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,810
And the ooze.

516
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,530
Ooz.

517
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,810
You increase the capacity to compensate.

518
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,590
Yeah, but like...

519
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,470
I mean, I will get that first, honestly.

520
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,900
Umigari equals return to the sea.

521
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,500
I remember that from Forbidden Siren Games.

522
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,580
Umigari.

523
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,380
A little different.

524
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,000
What does the hat say?

525
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,120
I need that clipper to make more compilation of it.

526
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,860
That clipper.

527
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,300
Oh, oh.

528
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,860
The fish just went into the sand.

529
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,740
Oh, there he is.

530
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,100
It's going to be a little bit of a grind in the beginning as
I...

531
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,880
Because...

532
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,800
Wait, what's our...

533
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,240
Oh, yeah.

534
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,300
Our mission at the moment is like finding the tablets.

535
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,440
I know there's some stuff over there, so...

536
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,430
My hat says...

537
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,610
Women fear me, fish fear me, men turn their eyes away from
me as I walk.

538
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,830
No beast dares make a sound.

539
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,890
In my presence I am alone.

540
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,410
barren earth oh

541
00:40:45,500 --> 00:41:01,220
let's sell this guy and we'll fill up too how woman me too
oh no dang it no don't get me sick please sell select all

542
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:14,180
sell okay all right we won't do the speed for now we're just
gonna go wait we have a place we can go to real quick.

543
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,160
This one is right by us.

544
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:23,930
Swimmy.

545
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,550
Oh,

546
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,690
gosh.

547
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,630
The water is all sorts of screwed up here as well.

548
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,140
The windmills.

549
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,200
Yeah, in the demo, the windmills were the only thing you
could go to.

550
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,660
So, um, well, okay.

551
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,660
Help.

552
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,700
Oh, my God.

553
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,640
Help?

554
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,250
Um, hold on.

555
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,670
I think I can get back into my boat.

556
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:02,850
Yeah.

557
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:03,730
Okay, good, good.

558
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,450
Um, let's get a little closer.

559
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,530
That should be good.

560
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:10,730
Yeah!

561
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:11,730
Woo!

562
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,270
Oh!

563
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,370
Oh, these are things that I've...

564
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,270
This guy is just in a Gengar hat.

565
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,530
He's in a Gengar hat.

566
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,690
Oh, these are like the supporter things.

567
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,310
Oh, look how many there are.

568
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,550
That looks like a puffer fish.

569
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,750
Is it meant to look like this on purpose or is it just
glitchy as all heck?

570
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,810
I don't know.

571
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,190
I don't know.

572
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,290
I feel like it's probably a...

573
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,350
No, no, no, no.

574
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,410
I feel like it's probably a glitch.

575
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,000
Any special...

576
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,860
Oh, dang it.

577
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,520
I was going to say any special, uh...

578
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,560
What's the words?

579
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,640
Oh yeah, it's definitely not supposed to be like this.

580
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,260
Um, any special shells.

581
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,300
But anyway, let's go to the windmills.

582
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,820
Look, there's even like a little house here.

583
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,060
And be on the lookout for some larger fish, you know.

584
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,400
We didn't go out very far, but be on the lookout.

585
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,840
It's a me, Takashi.

586
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,020
You can just walk under the water if you jump through the
glitch, maybe?

587
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,900
Alright, I know, I remember I think we had to do this to get
it to move.

588
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,120
And I think there was something at the top of it.

589
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,140
Or maybe there's something at the top of that one.

590
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,420
Regardless, there's special stuff.

591
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,640
There's something special.

592
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,480
I played the demo.

593
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,140
I'm an expert at this game.

594
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,700
I played the demo.

595
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,400
Oh, oopsie.

596
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,680
That looked like a flying fish.

597
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,860
I just saw a real catch in the bottom right.

598
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,720
Bottom.

599
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,460
What do you mean by that?

600
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,180
Oh, I overestimated that like crazy.

601
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:03,720
I also think that they made it so you lose gas less easily
maybe i might be eating those words but it feels like it i

602
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:13,540
feel like before i couldn't go to this area without feeling
like i was really um about to like not make it you know what

603
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,560
i mean oh that's a big one

604
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,260
you're the catch i'm not a fish

605
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,920
Wait, what?

606
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,850
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

607
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,470
Holy cow!

608
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,010
That scared me.

609
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,310
Let's go get our thing.

610
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,790
Our upgrade, baby!

611
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,450
Our upgrade, upgrade.

612
00:45:58,990 --> 00:45:59,750
Can I grab that?

613
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,190
I just harpoon it?

614
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,150
Uh.

615
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,750
Uh, it won't let me drop it.

616
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,450
Uh-oh, wait.

617
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,010
Uh, it won't let me drop it.

618
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:14,970
Can I drive?

619
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:16,610
And drop it?

620
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:17,250
Uh-oh.

621
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,030
Oh, no.

622
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:18,990
Oh, no.

623
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,250
No, no.

624
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,830
Oh, pick up?

625
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,230
Give the bell to the fishmonger.

626
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:25,750
Oh!

627
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,810
What did I do?

628
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,290
Huh?

629
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,010
Huh?

630
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,670
Oh,

631
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,450
I think I got hit.

632
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,730
Oh, let's not get hit again.

633
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,780
I think.

634
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,840
Wait, is that it?

635
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,580
Oh, God.

636
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,660
What's happening?

637
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,300
What is going on?

638
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,560
Wait, are these some big fish?

639
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,700
Big fish?

640
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,020
Ooh, ooh.

641
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,760
We're little fish.

642
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:34,500
eyes detected in the bottom right as i can never turn my
eyes away from minto and i extra couldn't when she's walking

643
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:48,960
what is what are you talking about oh i found a bell you got
a bell the big monster umiga can't stand the sound of that

644
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:56,380
bell see that red buoy that one over there well where it
like that.

645
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,200
Oh, that's where it goes.

646
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,940
Alright, I'll go attach it.

647
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,520
See?

648
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,600
Nice, huh?

649
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,120
Strike the buoy bell with your harpoon to make it ring.

650
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,900
Why can't I keep it on my boat and ring it myself?

651
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,340
Looks like all the bells I had on the buoys went missing
somehow.

652
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,360
Bring them back and I'll fix things up for you.

653
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,900
But out there, I'm not sure if it's because of Amiga's curse
or what, but you cannot use boost.

654
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,400
So it won't be easy.

655
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,700
Steal yourself and give it your way.

656
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,040
all.

657
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,300
I've marked the places that you can reach on your map.

658
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,360
If you run into Umiga, don't forget to ring the bell.

659
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:31,900
Got it?

660
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,680
Find the missing bells to the buoys between islands and
you'll reach new areas.

661
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,380
Keep it up, yeah?

662
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,080
Huh.

663
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,160
I see.

664
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:44,980
Wait.

665
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,940
It says zoom.

666
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,000
Okay, close.

667
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,600
Can you take my stuff now?

668
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:49,980
Shop.

669
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,480
Oh, well, the upgrades Oh man.

670
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,080
Oh wait, no, we just got the boost added.

671
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,600
Love how we point the harpoon casually at the merchant when
talking to him.

672
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,580
Yeah, you know.

673
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,880
All right, let's do our boat speed.

674
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,200
I suppose for now.

675
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,300
How do I boost on my boat?

676
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,700
I think I was supposed to get a tutorial and I didn't get
anything.

677
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,420
is called

678
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:41,130
never once in all my years of life someone marked a location
on my map i'm starting to feel like a weird overcarrying

679
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:48,530
whatever yeah you know like i've had my stuff marked on a
map i don't know what's up with you so were these islands

680
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,830
that we can go to like the the tori gate or

681
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,570
something i guess we'll pin towards that way right

682
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:15,860
more money oh it's like so obvious it's like there's your
pin head that way i don't want to get attacked oh shift is

683
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:21,940
to boost okay cool boat speed level one required

684
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,780
am i good are you gonna deny me or i'm scared

685
00:50:51,360 --> 00:51:04,460
saw i heard what was happening and i just i just i backed up
very very quickly gonna turn it down just a bit because it

686
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:11,680
sounded kind of loud all right let's go in and i guess i
have to ring the so we can't boost in here is that what it

687
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,380
was and we have to ring this

688
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,980
i think that got rid of them I think that did the trick.

689
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:28,500
Potentially.

690
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,520
I don't think so!

691
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,020
I don't think that did the trick!

692
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,720
Oh, okay, we're fine.

693
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,760
Okay, that's a mechanic that they added to the game.

694
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,000
Okay.

695
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,000
Definitely is...

696
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,640
Oh, make sure to save your progress.

697
00:51:51,780 --> 00:52:01,420
The game warns you when you when you um when you start that
it does not auto save at all so if you lose if you like die

698
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:10,020
i guess that's it like we don't want the game to crash or
anything on us either so we shall um yeah remember it was

699
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:17,540
pretty difficult to get here like i felt like i was i was
grinding like crazy to get all the way out here in the demo

700
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:29,180
and now we're just like cruising along made that a um oh is
that guy uh update

701
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,980
yeah you needed multiple boat upgrades for sure yeah yeah i
was like i was like struggling i was like struggling like

702
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,480
hardcore i felt

703
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,510
4 000

704
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:59,210
you were like us right so you know what this feels like Just
stop, please.

705
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,040
It spoke to me.

706
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,620
My money spoke to me.

707
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,840
Yeah, was I a fish?

708
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,100
Turned human?

709
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,380
What do they mean by that?

710
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,120
Anything?

711
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:23,880
There's this.

712
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:29,460
I thought this would definitely be a place you could go
inside in this game.

713
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,620
But in the final version I spoke.

714
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,260
I meant.

715
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,140
But you can't crouch either.

716
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,040
I'm also the tallest person alive.

717
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:42,860
Is it my...

718
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,020
Is it my F-O...

719
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,680
No, this is a really short door.

720
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,600
What is happening?

721
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,680
This is normal.

722
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,640
What the heck?

723
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,920
We have like a doggy door for the convenience.

724
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,440
Sorry, I'm looking for what other fish we got over here.

725
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,800
Oh, what's that?

726
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,580
What are you?

727
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,940
What are you?

728
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,760
It's...

729
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,640
It begins.

730
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,040
It's a tuna!

731
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,180
It's just a tuna!

732
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,670
It's just a tuna!

733
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,550
I arrived a new area.

734
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,210
So you actually made it this far, huh?

735
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,570
and managed to get away from Mumiga, huh?

736
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,330
Not bad.

737
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,290
Alright then, keep it up, yeah?

738
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,030
What are you laughing about?

739
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,090
Yeah, I brought some fish.

740
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,890
This guy is Buku Bucks.

741
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,990
Oh, timid fish.

742
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,050
They're worth a little bit more.

743
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:10,610
Nice.

744
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,430
Wait, about the fish here?

745
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,670
The fish here are kind of shy, you know?

746
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:27,550
If you make eye contact, they'll run off so grab them quick
before they bolt oh they're so shy or maybe they're like

747
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,910
terrified of you know

748
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:48,160
oh hello is that in the umiga area or no that's in our area

749
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,120
the beast

750
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:09,730
let's do some upgrades let's do let's do our harpoon

751
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:27,310
and boost cool down seems kind of important I think having a
lower cool down is usually we're gonna farm some of it I

752
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:33,290
think we well I don't know how much I feel like they've
changed so much from the demo so I'm not gonna go into the

753
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:50,570
school right yet nice I am a professional because I don't
know if like it will it'll cause anything to happen you know

754
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,610
what I mean Do you think I can reach that?

755
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:56,010
Holy!

756
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,110
That might be the greatest!

757
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,470
Gamer Am!

758
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,450
My aim bot is on, baby.

759
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,290
My aim bot is on!

760
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,130
Get under the water.

761
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,850
Oh, never mind.

762
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,330
The blackout gets me every time.

763
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,890
Oh, I just realized that that...

764
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,470
Oh, did these?

765
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:20,450
These look like...

766
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,190
Pieces of...

767
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,230
I don't know what they looked like.

768
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:30,310
They looked like pieces of moss or something to me, so I
didn't even think that they were...

769
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,150
Oh.

770
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:34,730
Dang it!

771
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,680
Yeah, I think they may be...

772
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,800
Oh, he's still out there.

773
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,300
You see him?

774
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,260
Uh...

775
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,380
I think they might be a little...

776
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,680
Uh...

777
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:48,880
No.

778
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:49,880
Students...

779
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,820
Ah, huge shark.

780
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,140
Students that don't want to get...

781
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,660
Got...

782
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,100
Oh my god.

783
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,140
Now they're getting annoying.

784
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,740
Oh, he's right there!

785
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,420
Oh, he's swimming under the island.

786
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,920
I got half of his health down, though.

787
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,560
Where'd he go?

788
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,780
Where did he go?

789
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,360
Wait, why did he make that?

790
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,700
Oh my gosh.

791
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,100
I didn't think I would struggle so much with these guys, but
they're kind of annoying.

792
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:40,440
I know that you're like, students turn fish, but like, could
you please cooperate with me?

793
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,140
No, I don't want normal tuna.

794
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,240
I need the big money.

795
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,920
Take it.

796
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,480
Where'd that big guy go?

797
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,280
That's the school principal.

798
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,420
Dang.

799
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,020
Alright, so I guess we don't have to go back through there
if we ever don't want to, which is kind of nice.

800
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,220
Do appreciate a fast travel option to have.

801
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,200
Ah!

802
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,080
Nice.

803
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,340
Oh, there he is!

804
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,980
He'll probably come back.

805
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,640
He'll be back.

806
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,860
He'll be back.

807
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,660
They're so cute, though, in their little Seifuku.

808
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,820
He's so cute.

809
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,660
And they're also cute because they give me money.

810
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,780
Only roaming, too.

811
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,680
That guy.

812
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,380
Money is cute.

813
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Hmm.

814
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,080
Hmm.

815
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,520
Hmm.

816
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,060
It's not like I want to get caught or anything, S-S-Sanpai!

817
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,480
Going to school and you get speared?

818
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,140
Do you think like they were inspired by a school of fish?

819
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,620
Do you think?

820
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:42,540
plus two plus two don't say minus two no it's good you know
it it's so good you know it

821
01:00:48,360 --> 01:01:00,900
how does this guy get through the the big the big scary
monster i guess he also rings the bell minus 10 aura i've

822
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:13,340
always been negative aura you don't scare me you don't
affect me there he is a wonder oh i feel like i was close

823
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,650
wait a second he's gonna get close though he's gonna get
close

824
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:36,620
i could probably chase him chase after him in my boat but i
feel like i should oh you know what well he's kind of far

825
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:41,960
now I'm just gonna say do the upgrades first.

826
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:45,740
This is a good try.

827
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,420
Thank you.

828
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:47,900
Thank you.

829
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,660
I'm trying.

830
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,180
Hey, what the heck?

831
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,340
You're not a timid fish.

832
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,160
You are, though.

833
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,320
We're getting lots of safe...

834
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,400
Oh, I was gonna say we're getting lots of safe Fuku girls.

835
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,300
But actually, we're getting all the boy uniforms instead.

836
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,800
Is that one?

837
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,400
Are you a fish?

838
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,520
Maybe not.

839
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,140
I'm in the market for a new office chair.

840
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,160
Minto, what chair do you use?

841
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,800
I'm kind of short, guys, so I figured you'd have similar
ergonomics.

842
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,580
First of all...

843
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,580
First of all...

844
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,580
Actually, though, my chair...

845
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,680
I've kind of talked about it before.

846
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,020
It's like...

847
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,560
It's not...

848
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,560
I don't use, like, a regular office chair.

849
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:50,240
chair because I'm oh that was terrible I'm often like
sitting in such bizarre positions like if you guys could see

850
01:02:50,240 --> 01:03:00,460
the way I'm sitting right now you might be like what the
hell there he is no

851
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:09,500
come on come on I had him I had him he's just Zerklund.

852
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:16,580
Gollum.

853
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.

854
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,460
Hover guy, welcome to Membushhip.

855
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,060
Thank you.

856
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,360
Thank you, thank you.

857
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,760
Yeah, like, um...

858
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,140
Right now...

859
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,320
Okay, I'm gonna say something that...

860
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,920
I don't know if I've ever said this on stream before.

861
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,200
And I was worried about saying it because...

862
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,820
put any ideas into your heads.

863
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:56,120
I have a friend who, she was like, oh my gosh, my kid loves
watching you.

864
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,780
And I was like, uh-oh, why?

865
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,080
Like, he's a younger kid.

866
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,440
She was like, my kid loves watching you.

867
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,720
And, um...

868
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,840
But she was like, one day, uh...

869
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:23,960
He was watching your stream with one of his friends over and
the friend's mom happened to see the stream and was just

870
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,100
like, this is so inappropriate.

871
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,440
Why are her legs like that?

872
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,880
And my friend was like, what?

873
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,320
And the mom thought that my arms.

874
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:58,180
my mom thought that my arms like this were my knees and then
i'm just spread eagle the entire stream

875
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:14,220
i was like my friend had to be like my friend was just like
because it was just like very normal stream that i that they

876
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,760
were watching She was like, it was not inappropriate at all.

877
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,000
Because she's a ghost.

878
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,360
And so, my friend was just like, what do you mean
inappropriate?

879
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,660
Like, obviously, I don't think I'm like, you know, I'm a
kid's channel or anything.

880
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,420
But, you know, I was like, my friend was just very confused.

881
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,100
That was the reasoning.

882
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:53,220
No, please, I have been sitting, I have not told you guys
this for a really long time because I was like, I was like

883
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,880
so embarrassed about it.

884
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:01,520
I was like, I really don't want to put this idea to you
guys' head.

885
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,380
I can't unsee that.

886
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,700
Shut up, man.

887
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,020
But please, if you do art like that, I don't want to see it.

888
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,580
Only put it in the R18 tag, okay?

889
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,900
I mean, fandom parental discretion is not advised.

890
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,480
I could not have arrived at a more perfect time to hear that
story.

891
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,940
Oh, God.

892
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,300
It was so embarrassing.

893
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,820
I've never, ever thought of it in that world.

894
01:06:49,840 --> 01:07:00,180
before I was like wait a second there's no way there's no
way let's do the boost duration as well okay we do need to

895
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:07,800

now we'll head to the wait why is my I thought I added I

896
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:16,740

increased my capacity that's That's why.

897
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,560
That's why.

898
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,440
All right, we'll park right here.

899
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,860
Oh, oops.

900
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,760
Save before entering the school?

901
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,140
So you're so right.

902
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,840
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

903
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,180
This is why I'm here.

904
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,080
Clips like these.

905
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,140
Time to draw.

906
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:43,840
No!

907
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,820
It's so embarrassing.

908
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,020
Oh, oh, oh, it's got a nerve.

909
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,060
Think of it like this.

910
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,140
It was that lady who thought of the pose, so, so, of that
pose for you.

911
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,020
So how filthy is her mind?

912
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,880
Arms back up, me, don't be proud.

913
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:08,820
You know what?

914
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:09,800
I am a ghost.

915
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,780
I'm a ghost and I'm proud.

916
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,560
I just thought it was so out of pocket.

917
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:23,140
I was like, my friend telling me that, she was like, sorry,
this might be really embarrassing, but like...

918
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,420
How do I...

919
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,020
Okay, I was gonna take off the pin.

920
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,980
Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing.

921
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,400
Say it loud!

922
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,400
I'm a ghost and I'm proud!

923
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,440
Oh.

924
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,960
I'm a ghost and I'm proud!

925
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,640
That's this way.

926
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,280
I see something shining over there.

927
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,340
I feel maybe...

928
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:56,860
Oh, wait.

929
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,040
Oops.

930
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,120
That's fine, actually, because I was going to go back.

931
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,640
Wait, I saw...

932
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:02,820
There.

933
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,060
A shell.

934
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,300
I know they barely give you any yen, but I don't care.

935
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,660
Money is money.

936
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,380
I just can't.

937
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:28,760
I have a hard time, like, if I'm, if I'm like, how do I say?

938
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:43,940
So for example, if I am thinking of something in a certain
way, I have a very hard time imagining it as something else.

939
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:48,440
You know what, so for example, like, I'll use humor.

940
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,600
Morris as an example.

941
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,360
I, because I read, I see the text Hugh Morris.

942
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,920
I can't my brain does not hear the the, the, the, the pun.

943
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,160
Helsing game.

944
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,740
Love that guy.

945
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:13,220
She must have been on some freaky stuff because I still
can't see it.

946
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:13,880
And you know what?

947
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,060
That's great.

948
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,780
If you can't see it, That's the best.

949
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,040
That's the best ending.

950
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,430
So, you know, if I'm like...

951
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,230
If someone was just like, yeah, his name is Hugh Morris.

952
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:31,590
I'm like, oh yeah, Hugh Morris.

953
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:31,890
Okay.

954
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:35,310
Yeah, like I... I... It's hard for me to...

955
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:38,250
Oh, wait.

956
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:39,830
Um...

957
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:41,610
Sorry.

958
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,350
I just realized that, like...

959
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,310
I don't have a way to get you guys...

960
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:50,090
What is that one?

961
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,110
Oh, it's so hard to tell.

962
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:02,730
And that's why there's like, uh, like the, when they do the
puns of, like, the silly names that are, like, something

963
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,910
actually kind of explicit.

964
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,350
It's hard for me to, what's that?

965
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:08,670
It's hard for me to hear it.

966
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,010
Oh.

967
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:18,210
That one name Ace Attorney cannot use now.

968
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:21,070
I know, right?

969
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:22,330
They totally lost out.

970
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,370
Oh, everything was a Lord of the Lord of the Lord.

971
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:31,410
What does that sound?

972
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,390
Maybe it's upstairs.

973
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:35,070
Oh, what's this?

974
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:35,730
Oh.

975
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:36,850
I sound.

976
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:38,330
Oh no!

977
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,230
Our spoils are gone!

978
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,810
There's nothing over here.

979
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:53,780
Q.

980
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:54,600
Morris.

981
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,860
If this weren't a horror game, I swear, it's such good
vibes.

982
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,400
Such good vibes.

983
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,900
What are we doing in here again?

984
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,960
I mean, I know one of our thing is a...

985
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,680
We have a tab.

986
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,820
The three tablet shards.

987
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,340
I think I remember a huge head here.

988
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,300
Yeah, I do remember that part.

989
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,260
Ooh, it's still there.

990
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:34,840
Creepy.

991
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,500
Remember you from the demo.

992
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,540
Wait, was there anything over here?

993
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,080
Wait!

994
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,060
Ah, I remember the characters with like the...

995
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,040
The different... We have to, like, bring them up here, don't
we?

996
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:54,550
Oh.

997
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:55,910
Oh!

998
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,510
It's this guy walking around!

999
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,070
That's what all that sound is.

1000
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:04,450
This is just plop, plopping around.

1001
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:05,330
Gross.

1002
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,130
Picked up something.

1003
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,320
They're so fun to look at.

1004
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,260
Hold on.

1005
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,820
I don't... He didn't do anything before, but just in case.

1006
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,840
I'm coming to you.

1007
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,140
And I'm taking your stash.

1008
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,780
I'm taking your whole stash.

1009
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:47,580
Nice.

1010
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,580
Tunjijito stuff.

1011
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:51,760
Yeah, I know, right?

1012
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,840
Is there anything up here?

1013
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,920
A ladder that I cannot climb.

1014
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:04,060
Look at how much passive income we've made, guys.

1015
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,160
Just from walking around.

1016
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,300
Oh, yeah.

1017
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,760
It's like 100 yen each.

1018
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,240
I think that's it, actually.

1019
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,940
I wish I had parked my boat.

1020
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:26,620
Take it.

1021
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,900
Ooh, that one's special looking.

1022
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,220
Give it to me through the board.

1023
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,480
Wait, am I stuck in here?

1024
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:41,540
Ah!

1025
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,080
Wait, can I go back up?

1026
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,180
Oh, we can't go back up!

1027
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,060
Okay, good, good, good.

1028
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:48,540
Phew.

1029
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,280
Hello.

1030
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,500
What's this?

1031
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:57,760
Oh, come on.

1032
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,860
Oh, I got a thing for my boat.

1033
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:01,920
Updated map!

1034
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,640
Do you think the purple is that big guy?

1035
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,140
That big fish?

1036
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,200
Wait.

1037
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,940
It's behind me.

1038
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:37,500
oh maybe oh yeah I think so I think so he is right behind me
isn't he I am reborn God didn't abandon me there were

1039
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:44,720
bullies in my class I know because I was was always watching
them from the fish tank some classmates were kind to me they

1040
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:49,360
even fed me through the glass but the bullies tormented the
ones who cared for me.

1041
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,700
I'm part of the class too.

1042
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,780
I'll make sure those jerks are dealt with.

1043
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,020
You see the desks in front of me?

1044
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,240
They're the accessories the bullies wear.

1045
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,540
So yeah, we gotta go get the fish of the bullies.

1046
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,960
Place three fish on the desk.

1047
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:10,220
Alright.

1048
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,920
Sorry, now that I'm remembering that I should save, I am.

1049
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,000
And

1050
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:38,200
you oh sorry oh whoa two for one so this guy was a fish and
then these these guys bullied him but he was a fish who

1053
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,300
What were the, actually, what were the other accessories?

1054
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,240
I think I remember the flowers.

1055
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,640
Uh, this one.

1056
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,800
She said, ita, ita!

1057
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,260
Not enough for a single onigiri.

1058
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,160
Literally, not enough for anything.

1059
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,120
Can't even get a bubblegum for that.

1060
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,240
You?

1061
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:42,230
fish and then flowers all right a single yany i wonder
what's down here oh we can't go

1062
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:56,870

1063
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:59,250

1064
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,190
Just a lady.

1065
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,380
I wonder if we can walk out here.

1066
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,480
Oh, we can!

1067
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,720
Can I go down?

1068
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:16,840
I don't want to...

1069
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,740
I don't want to...

1070
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,840
I don't want it to...

1071
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,660
Spawn me back at the boat.

1072
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:21,220
Alright.

1073
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,640
Pink flower.

1074
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:28,900
Oh!

1075
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:29,840
Oh!

1076
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:30,940
Oh!

1077
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,300
I think it's...

1078
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,040
That's the reason.

1079
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:33,340
Okay.

1080
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:46,730
cute that's we have to go back to the rooftop that's why
that's okay going through here was good anyway

1081
01:18:52,170 --> 01:19:01,450
I fell down there and then I completely forgot about that
being a thing oh I thought it was a sign it's just the way

1082
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:05,750
the sun is it does look like it's pink

1083
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:10,890
besides the big fish there hasn't been any horror.

1084
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:15,830
Yeah, it's just been, I guess, like, I mean, there was the,
yeah, the big fish.

1085
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:19,170
Just kind of feels unsettling, but nothing that has been
like.

1086
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:21,450
Boom bam.

1087
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,470
Which one is it?

1088
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,970
Oh my gosh.

1089
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,870
Oh my god.

1090
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:27,470
Just calm down.

1091
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:28,710
Calm down.

1092
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:30,450
Yeah.

1093
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,710
Let me grab you.

1094
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:33,930
Let me fish you.

1095
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:35,530
You're the fish now.

1096
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,390
How's it feel?

1097
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,140
Something's not right.

1098
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,040
Aren't these the ones who were getting bullied?

1099
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,620
Wait, which is which?

1100
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,680
Alright, my apologies.

1101
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,640
I have the memory of a goldfish, you see.

1102
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:58,360
Either way, the weak must be consumed by the strong, yes?

1103
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,240
Just like how I consumed my tank baits!

1104
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,980
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1105
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,140
It's chow-in time.

1106
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,020
This guy is built.

1107
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,720
Oh my god.

1108
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,100
We got another bell.

1109
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:27,080
I don't remember what we got in the demo.

1110
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:33,270
Freaky.

1111
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,060
Technically cannibalism?

1112
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,560
Depends who you ask, huh?

1113
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:52,090
Did I bring back any fish at all?

1114
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:52,910
No.

1115
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:54,750
Hello!

1116
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:59,070
Brought back a fish trivia!

1117
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,570
You know, goldfish are...

1118
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,620
No way.

1119
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,080
No.

1120
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,920
No way.

1121
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:24,940
There's a cannibalism in this game!

1122
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,440
Reset the counter!

1123
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,680
Reset the counter!

1124
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,280
Counter!

1125
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,000
Cannibalism has been mentioned!

1126
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,480
Actually, not even just by me, by the game!

1127
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,780
When they are starving, what do you gotta...

1128
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,200
You do what you gotta do, right?

1129
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,360
If humans had absolutely nothing to eat, maybe they'd do the
same.

1130
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,940
Anyway, here's the bell.

1131
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,220
Looks like you found the bell.

1132
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:58,560
Hold up, I'll fix it right here.

1133
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:14,040
up and mark the new places you can reach now good luck out
there oh nice okay cool we'll mark that but we will fast

1134
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:23,740
travel to the first island you know i wonder if we can get
to these or maybe you have to have the bell to go through

1135
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,600
the tori probably

1136
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:35,380
very cool very cool but before we do that i do want to
upgrade my ship.

1137
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,260
Dang it.

1138
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,520
Oh, that was way too slow.

1139
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,320
117.25 for cannibalism.

1140
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,380
Good pace today, boss.

1141
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,780
How soon will we get cannibalism?

1142
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,780
It's like a new, it's the hit reality TV show.

1143
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,980
All about cannibalism.

1144
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,340
I'm gonna go after that big guy.

1145
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,320
Dig in.

1146
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,180
I'm about to run into the school.

1147
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,920
Okay, he's...

1148
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,420
I'm realizing he's like way fast.

1149
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,380
He's like pretty fast.

1150
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:31,400
For me.

1151
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,120
But we do have other islands to see.

1152
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:41,820
So that's kind of fun.

1153
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,180
Look, we haven't been over here.

1154
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,040
Why not?

1155
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:52,840
What's this?

1156
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:55,620
Okay.

1157
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,540
We haven't been over here.

1158
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,980
And there's more...

1159
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,020
more fish to get.

1160
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,960
He's fast though, he's really fast.

1161
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,140
Faster than you anticipate, you know.

1162
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:18,880
Ha!

1163
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:19,280
Oh!

1164
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:23,520
I didn't expect...

1165
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:39,560
direction the fish went oh come on okay hold on we can get
like this guy oh i know i can get him i know i can get him

1166
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:46,520
we're close we're close we can get this how do you notice
that i'm looking at you huh oh

1167
01:24:53,260 --> 01:25:00,900
come on it's like when you don't even know that someone's
looking at you you just feel it

1168
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,000
You might get that feeling like when I'm around or
something.

1169
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,180
Like someone's watching me.

1170
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:13,160
I feel like somebody's watching me.

1171
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,180
And I've got no privacy.

1172
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,160
Oh well.

1173
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:21,600
It happens a lot.

1174
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,740
Have you considered that your place is haunted?

1175
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,600
Dang it.

1176
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,760
I didn't mean to look at you.

1177
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:29,700
Dang it.

1178
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,700
They're so timid.

1179
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,680
That guy's not timid, though.

1180
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,980
That guy's also only 500 yen, but...

1181
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,660
Haunted.

1182
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,840
Have you checked your home for ghost maids?

1183
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,720
I know.

1184
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,000
Ah, come on!

1185
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,560
Dang it.

1186
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,380
They're so shy.

1187
01:25:59,600 --> 01:25:59,740
Wait.

1188
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,720
Ah,

1189
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,680
I have to have my, like, my...

1190
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,980
thing already.

1191
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:11,880
What the?

1192
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:13,520
Okay.

1193
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,960
I have, like, supervision.

1194
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,860
Stop being so shy!

1195
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,620
Stop being so shy!

1196
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,560
I'm friend!

1197
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,240
I'm your friend that you would loan a thousand yen!

1198
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,540
Jokes on the invisible entities.

1199
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,920
I like to be watched.

1200
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,260
That could be the case, too.

1201
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,300
There we go.

1202
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,940
yes more money please more money please

1203
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,900

we got him like i feel like we got him pretty good

1205
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:26,220
what does a ghost need with money it's all context i don't
need money But, I need money in the game.

1206
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,680
And apparently fish need lots of money.

1207
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:37,880
This guy is, like, charging me an arm and a leg for some of
this stuff.

1208
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,280
Oh, that was so close, I feel.

1209
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,080
The boat needs money.

1210
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,680
The boat is a hungry machine.

1211
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,040
A hungry machine she is.

1212
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,680
my 100 yen seashell.

1213
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,460
Oh my gosh.

1214
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,460
It, like, I couldn't even see who it was.

1215
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:07,900
Wait.

1216
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:18,660
What the?

1217
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,200
That didn't go at all where I directed it to.

1218
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:29,670
Shaa.

1219
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,430
Ooh, it took a nice sippy and it was like Ah!

1220
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,770
Hello, I'm back.

1221
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:49,230
Yes, shop, shop, shop.

1222
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,790
Sell, sell, sell.

1223
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:53,450
Upgrade.

1224
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:57,730
Holy 90,000 for the fuel capacity next.

1225
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,710
Good soda sounds.

1226
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,730
They're so expensive.

1227
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,630
Alright, we'll do the speed.

1228
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:18,110
So we at least have one of everything there.

1229
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:22,190
Let's go back to the main island.

1230
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:25,310
Oh wow.

1231
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,110
Oh, my bad.

1232
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:27,830
We'll save though.

1233
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:29,330
Oh, I guess.

1234
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:34,190
I thought I was docked.

1235
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,030
I thought I was docked.

1236
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,470
I thought I was docked.

1237
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:40,770
Hello!

1238
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,550
Do you have anything new?

1239
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,650
So can I buy the upgrades here?

1240
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,010
Oh, I can!

1241
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,750
Okay, that's pretty handy too then.

1242
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:52,650
The real horror is the grind.

1243
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,070
I'll be honest.

1244
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,230
That's the part I don't mind.

1245
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:59,630
I'm like, yeah, the grind.

1246
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:01,590
It's kind of nice.

1247
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,470
Just kind of like fishing along and, you know?

1248
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:09,290
It's not so bad.

1249
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:10,410
It's not so bad.

1250
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:12,290
Let's see if there was anything over here.

1251
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:16,010
but um I see the other Tori

1252
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:29,590

1256
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,020

1257
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:33,430
Hmm This might be a problem

1258
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:40,070
Survive being a bit of a problem.

1259
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:45,310
Here's the current equivalent of 1,000 yen.

1260
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:46,410
Thank you, Phil.

1261
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:47,450
Thank you.

1262
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:48,570
Take a swim?

1263
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,670
Yeah, let's do that.

1264
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:52,310
I think I have to reload.

1265
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:55,910
It's a good thing I just saved.

1266
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:00,770
Okay, we won't pick that back up.

1267
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:03,630
Let's...

1268
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,550
Head to the mall.

1269
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,340
Wow, big fish!

1270
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,740
I want that guy.

1271
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,900
I want that guy.

1272
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:28,550
Alright, we're going to the mall, baby!

1273
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:34,930
No way.

1274
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:38,810
Did, like, the special seashells, they respawn.

1275
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:40,890
Ooh, nice!

1276
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,350
Okay.

1277
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,290
Wait, do I have more paint?

1278
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:49,110
Oh, that's what I've been collecting!

1279
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:50,790
I just realized!

1280
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:52,530
Oh.

1281
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:54,130
Wow.

1282
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,670
This is actually, like, really impressive.

1283
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:59,790
To spray paint a...

1284
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,950
It's, like, full wood.

1285
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:04,250
Wait.

1286
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:07,530
It's kind of incredibly impressive.

1287
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:10,150
You could spray paint a boat to look like wood.

1288
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:12,670
Okay, that's that one.

1289
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,200
Oh.

1290
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,960
Wow, it's even chipped and everything.

1291
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,940
That's our Rusty, you guys.

1292
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,840
This is so funny.

1293
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,880
Wait, so this is a different Rusty.

1294
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,900
Oh, yeah, this is different from before.

1295
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,280
Wait, I like the blue.

1296
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,360
Wow.

1297
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:38,680
Wow.

1298
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:40,940
Oh.

1299
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,160
A face only a mother could love.

1300
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,200
Wow.

1301
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:57,470
buh-bye buh-bye wait I'm going the right way right yeah yeah
yeah okay

1302
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:03,850
isn't it pink

1303
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,290
it's pink

1304
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:25,270
for the engine it looked like there was an interaction above
the rudder but maybe not important

1305
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:39,090
I mean I'm willing to try one more time, but at the same
time, I don't want, you know, all right, boat speed level

1306
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,110
two required.

1307
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:41,710
I had that, right?

1308
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,250
I got that right.

1309
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,180
I think I see it.

1310
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,680
Yeah, there's the bell right there.

1311
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,780
I'm gonna create a new save here.

1312
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:56,980
All right, here we go.

1313
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,020
It says speed level one.

1314
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,580
Oh, wait, my speed level is wide.

1315
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:05,740
Oh, yeah, it says right there.

1316
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,360
Oh, you're right.

1317
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:08,360
All right.

1318
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,720
You're, I, okay.

1319
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:14,160
We must then, okay.

1320
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,400
We not must, but I'm gonna try this one more time.

1321
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:19,840
Ouch.

1322
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:27,420
And then we'll fast travel over to the, uh, to the other
island.

1323
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,000
Wait, it's not even here.

1324
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,220
It's not even here anymore.

1325
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:46,430
It's such a strange phenomenon.

1326
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:50,650
And there's another paint can here!

1327
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:54,230
But I didn't grab because I had to resave.

1328
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:01,590
Nice.

1329
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:05,550
Nice.

1330
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,670
For Mama Man.

1331
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:11,970
Phenomenon.

1332
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:12,770
Phenomenon.

1333
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,320
Phenomenon.

1334
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,380
Oh, this way.

1335
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,240
Fast travel.

1336
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:29,890
Alright.

1337
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:33,430
Fast travel to the school of fish.

1338
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:35,330
Oh, we're docked.

1339
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:35,590
Okay.

1340
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,010
Let's get some money, baby.

1341
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,970
Let's...

1342
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:42,110
Let's... Let's get some big bucks.

1343
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:45,130
Big fish.

1344
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:48,630
You back there.

1345
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:49,270
Yes.

1346
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:52,470
Yes.

1347
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:56,590
I know I need to head to the mall, but I need the money
first.

1348
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:57,730
Please.

1349
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:00,990
Please understand.

1350
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:02,370
I need the money first.

1351
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:07,070
Where all the fish go?

1352
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:09,150
Did they warn each other?

1353
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,070
Are they like, she's out for a hunt?

1354
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,650
You didn't even see that one?

1355
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,450
I got the eye of an eagle, baby.

1356
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:21,410
Eagle-eyed, mean toe.

1357
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:24,410
That's what they call me.

1358
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:38,680
That was an eagle.

1359
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:41,360
That was an eagle sound.

1360
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,740
Look, these all respawn.

1361
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:44,980
Nice.

1362
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,440
Passive income, baby.

1363
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:53,300
Oh my god, that one saw me from all the way over here.

1364
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,500
Don't be so dramatic.

1365
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,000
Dang it.

1366
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:02,680
No,

1367
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:17,940
no, I got him.

1368
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,720
I got him!

1369
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,680
Okay, it does reset, though.

1370
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,860
Oh, come on!

1371
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,580
Oh, dang it.

1372
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,280
Oh, I thought you would slow down for some reason.

1373
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:39,900
Get him.

1374
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,040
Should have, if only I were in my boat, you know.

1375
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,680
If I were in my boat, I would have gone after him.

1376
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:50,960
We'll get him.

1377
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,080
Did I get him in the demo?

1378
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:52,820
I can't remember.

1379
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,800
If I got him then or not.

1380
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:08,720

right we need a boat speed

me that i'm like easter egg hunting so it's pretty fun

1387
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,580
Selling, selling.

1388
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:27,960
Boat speed.

1389
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,280
We need the 15,000.

1390
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:30,820
We're almost there.

1391
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,420
We just need to catch, like, four more fish.

1392
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,540
And we'll be good.

1393
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:35,300
Oh.

1394
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:37,820
Fish.

1395
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:40,620
Fish probably sense the bloodthirsty aura.

1396
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,460
What's the rollback button mean?

1397
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:45,380
Curious.

1398
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:57,660
Um, even if they do, uh, it should be like, uh, it should be
kind of like, you know how sometimes there's, I think that's

1399
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,680
a regular fish, yeah?

1400
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:06,540
Like, sometimes, uh, the aura will, will hypnotize the fish,
you know what I mean?

1401
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:12,220
Or hypnotize the creature and make it like, like a moth to a
flame.

1402
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:17,900
what I'm doing in my own way.

1403
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,580
Where did all the fish go?

1404
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,080
Oh.

1405
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,300
Like a moth to a flame.

1406
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,360
A fish to my harpoon.

1407
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:33,320
Dang it.

1408
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:42,090
Oh, oh, we just gotta stay in the area.

1409
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:44,450
We just gotta stay in the area and we can get him.

1410
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:48,390
Oh, nice.

1411
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,470
Like a flame.

1412
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:50,930
No.

1413
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,890
Like a moth to a flame.

1414
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,750
The fish to my harpoon.

1415
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:00,920
Oof.

1416
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:02,540
Eat a believe.

1417
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:03,980
Eat a believe.

1418
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,360
That guy will be back.

1419
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,520
I don't know where he is now.

1420
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,600
Wait, we can see him on the map.

1421
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:19,150
We'll just wait in the water for him.

1422
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,680
Dang it.

1423
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:26,900
I was hoping they wouldn't have noticed.

1424
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:37,100
Fish.

1425
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,240
Oh, where do I need to go for?

1426
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,860
Gosh, they're so good at noticing.

1427
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:50,640
They're like, they take notice me, Senpai, like super
seriously.

1428
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,260
You know what I mean?

1429
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:54,520
Oh, dang it.

1430
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:54,900
Dang it.

1431
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:55,220
Dang it.

1432
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,290
He could be here any second.

1433
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:05,290
They're like, you ask, Senpai, and we know this.

1434
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:09,490
Oh, come on.

1435
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:11,550
He was right there.

1436
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:13,330
Oh

1437
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:30,830
no!

1438
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,150
Wait, this is good.

1439
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:34,590
You're still there, right?

1440
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:36,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1441
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:45,290
Hello!

1442
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:47,570
Hi!

1443
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:50,890
Oh, golly!

1444
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:53,710
Oh.

1445
01:43:54,910 --> 01:43:55,970
Wait, what just happened?

1446
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,310
Oh, I got him!

1447
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,570
I got him on the back of my ship!

1448
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:03,460
Oh my gosh.

1449
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,580
Nice!

1450
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,400
Yeah!

1451
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,700
I wonder if this guy respawns.

1452
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:25,240
Hopefully this is like enough that we need, you know?

1453
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:27,920
To...

1454
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,020
Like...

1455
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,640
10,000 giant tunnel!

1456
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:36,280
Yippee!

1457
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:37,980
Okay, upgrade.

1458
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:40,300
Alright!

1459
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:42,500
500!

1460
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:43,780
50,000!

1461
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:45,180
90,000!

1462
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,480
Okay, the next fish better give us like 50,000 or 5,000 each
and all.

1463
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:51,400
Holy cow.

1464
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,760
There are IRL fish with human teeth.

1465
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,200
I don't like that information.

1466
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,760
I think I never wish to hear that.

1467
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,500
Oh, uh...

1468
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,020
Alright, now we can go to the next place.

1469
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:15,820
Oh, whoops.

1470
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:16,720
Uh, leaf.

1471
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:20,640
Um...

1472
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,540
What I'll... I think it's my boosting that means.

1473
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,060
Caught a giant tuna.

1474
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:29,000
Could that be?

1475
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,180
You actually hauled that one up, huh?

1476
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,760
That stone there.

1477
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:34,340
Never mind.

1478
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:37,140
Keep at it, you're doing good out there.

1479
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,760
Wait, do I have one of the stones?

1480
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,180
Is that what he just implied?

1481
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:48,060
Yeah, we're gonna save.

1482
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:49,960
Yes.

1483
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:50,900
Nice.

1484
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,840
And drive over here.

1485
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,900
Parasite that will attach itself to a fish's tongue and over
time become the tongue.

1486
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,160
They look kind of cute, actually.

1487
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,240
Oh, we're zooming now.

1488
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:08,700
Oh, yeah.

1489
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,620
Yeah.

1490
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,080
We're going to the mouth.

1491
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,540
This is all new from here.

1492
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,680
That's exciting.

1493
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:18,820
It was in the mouth.

1494
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,100
I don't think you grabbed it.

1495
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,560
Oh, it's right here.

1496
01:46:29,290 --> 01:46:29,490
Oh!

1497
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:31,730
Cool.

1498
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,190
I saw it was in its...

1499
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:34,650
Or I saw something was on it.

1500
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:36,570
But yeah.

1501
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:37,550
Alright, new save.

1502
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:38,610
Let's go.

1503
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:40,590
Alright.

1504
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:42,970
The bell is there.

1505
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:44,890
I'm scared.

1506
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,530
I'm actually scared of this part.

1507
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:52,730
Oh yeah, we can't boost in here.

1508
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:53,670
I forgot.

1509
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:55,610
Uh-oh.

1510
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,470
Oops, I missed.

1511
01:46:58,250 --> 01:46:59,390
Oh, I didn't miss.

1512
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:01,050
I didn't miss.

1513
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,350
I thought I missed.

1514
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:08,830
Okay, bye.

1515
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:20,720
I thought I missed.

1516
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:23,200
That would have been sooo embarrassing.

1517
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:25,720
Make sure to save your progress!

1518
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,620
I like that it does tell you.

1519
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:29,520
Oh, are those flying fish?

1520
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:30,780
Nice.

1521
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,880
I'm docked.

1522
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:38,380
I think.

1523
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:49,310
Um...

1524
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:49,750
Hi, mister.

1525
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:53,290
Uh, caught a giant tuna.

1526
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:56,130
That stone there.

1527
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:56,650
Never mind.

1528
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:57,250
Keep at it.

1529
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:59,670
I arrived in a new area!

1530
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:01,990
You barely made it this far, huh?

1531
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,590
Looks like you've got the hang of using that bell now.

1532
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,770
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1533
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:09,650
Legally distinct Aeon Mall.

1534
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:13,190
I know, it's a Aquan Mall.

1535
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:21,130
There's a famous mall chain called Aeon Malls in Japan that
kind of use that same font.

1536
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:24,450
Go hauling a bunch in this area too, yeah?

1537
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:28,210
Oh, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.

1538
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:31,150
So now we should be able to fast travel, which is good.

1539
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,610
These guys all look like they're in the air.

1540
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:35,590
not in the water.

1541
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:37,530
Which is exciting.

1542
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:38,690
Oh my gosh, new area!

1543
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:41,930
Yippee!

1544
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:42,850
Yippee!

1545
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:51,890
They're actually kind of slow, so that's nice.

1546
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,950
Or they seem slow?

1547
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,710
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1548
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:03,110
I'm looking at the...

1549
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:05,030
I think I see Chilazar Us.

1550
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:07,070
Wait!

1551
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:09,730
Does that just say Uniclub?

1552
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:13,400
Oh!

1553
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:15,020
Umi-klo!

1554
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,680
Yeah, this is all new.

1555
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,480
Umi-klo!

1556
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,660
Umi-klo!

1557
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:24,700
Oh.

1558
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,060
There he goes into the wall.

1559
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:31,060
That's clever.

1560
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,160
Ha!

1561
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,800
I got one!

1562
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,800
You're acting like a human now after killing all those fish.

1563
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:43,560
You've watched from the sea.

1564
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:43,820
see.

1565
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,960
You know how ugly humans are.

1566
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:47,160
So why?

1567
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,360
Why become one of them?

1568
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:52,440
Oh!

1569
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,060
6,000!

1570
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,740
Oh, heck yeah!

1571
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,920
It's not you, fish.

1572
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,580
It's the fact that...

1573
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:08,150
It's the fact that you guys give me such sweet cash.

1574
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:15,410
Oh, they're fast in the water, though.

1575
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:16,790
Oh, oops.

1576
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:31,800
they're ginormous yeah you'll see them really fast in the
water and then out of the water they're pretty slow you just

1577
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:42,220
kind of gotta i'm just kind of like holding out for one to
jump by me i'll probably go sell right quick before the mall

1578
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:51,900
i wonder if we'll meet any more well i guess there was the
guy in the seifuku Okay, that one.

1579
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,740
A guy in the Seifuku, so...

1580
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,320
I imagine there will be another human?

1581
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,040
Or fish human?

1582
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:01,580
In here?

1583
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:02,980
Multiple?

1584
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:03,500
Maybe?

1585
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:05,940
Fascinating.

1586
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,500
Very, very interesting.

1587
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,080
Oh my gosh, please.

1588
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:18,920
So...

1589
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,840
12,000!

1590
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,360
Yeah, or worse, human fish.

1591
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,640
What about the fish here?

1592
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:25,040
Let's see.

1593
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:28,920
Did you know some fish love bright light?

1594
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:31,800
They're usually down on the sea floor, so you might miss
them.

1595
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:34,240
So you should use the sonar.

1596
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:37,240
Also, for flying fish, it's easier to catch them if you
boost.

1597
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:38,800
Oh, okay.

1598
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:40,980
Some fish on the bot...

1599
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:41,900
Wait, I have a sonar?

1600
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:44,440
Isn't that the thing I picked up, but...

1601
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,880
It, like, didn't attach to my boat.

1602
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:51,280
I definitely picked one up, though, but it didn't...

1603
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:53,780
Um...

1604
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,100
It didn't attach.

1605
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,320
I remember grabbing it.

1606
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:09,200
Not yet?

1607
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:11,820
No, I could have sworn it was like...

1608
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:14,380
Outside at the school.

1609
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:16,960
Whoa, this one's nice.

1610
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,040
We don't have the sonar yet.

1611
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:22,540
Okay.

1612
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:24,380
I guess we'll go get it.

1613
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:25,880
I have to find a way to get inside here.

1614
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,520
Oh, we have the soul!

1615
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,800
Not Mujie.

1616
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,560
Afternoon drift!

1617
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:35,820
Oh, these are all like just...

1618
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,520
You guys hear that?

1619
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:41,920
Oh!

1620
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:53,880
Human.

1621
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,660
There's a human shape there.

1622
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:01,420
Big fish.

1623
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,280
Big, big fish.

1624
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:06,520
Oh, big fish.

1625
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:08,120
I don't think we can get up there.

1626
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,100
Maybe with my boat.

1627
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,140
I think if I...

1628
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:13,440
Um, where to jump on top of it.

1629
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,180
Ah, dang it.

1630
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:23,660
Wait, you, you, you, you, you.

1631
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:26,480
Ah!

1632
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,580
I'm not good at timing it.

1633
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:30,100
It's okay.

1634
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,940
We're just driving around right now.

1635
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,600
We might be able to get in through here.

1636
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:38,680
This might work.

1637
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,080
It shows that there's more than one human here, maybe?

1638
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:45,940
Eh.

1639
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:55,240
If only I were a flying fish.

1640
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,080
Okay.

1641
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:00,520
Never mind.

1642
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:07,080
There's more.

1643
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,540
So many.

1644
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:09,460
Oops.

1645
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,400
So many seashells.

1646
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,540
Oh, I did it again.

1647
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,380
Okay, hold on.

1648
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,360
A little closer.

1649
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:17,020
There we go.

1650
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,460
That's good.

1651
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:18,880
That's good.

1652
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:19,520
No.

1653
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:22,740
Yes.

1654
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:25,820
Yes!

1655
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:31,600
Sonar, eh?

1656
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:33,160
Alright.

1657
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:37,600
I'm just struggling to find a way inside.

1658
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,460
First of all.

1659
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:45,020
I'm struggling to get it.

1660
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,260
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1661
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,940
Oh, I think here is our entrance.

1662
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:52,600
Follow the yellow gamer paint.

1663
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,480
In this case, the yellow gamer cones.

1664
01:54:58,980 --> 01:55:01,160
Oh, is this the sonar?

1665
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,360
Ah!

1666
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:04,260
Updated.

1667
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:05,380
Oh, no, that's the map.

1668
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,720
Oh, that's what I was thinking of.

1669
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,760
It was the map, I suppose.

1670
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,740
I thought that was a sonar.

1671
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:18,180
Kind of feels sonar-esque because it told us the location of
that one guy, right?

1672
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,860
Why is the music so creepy in here?

1673
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:20,780
Hello?

1674
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,480
It's just a takoyaki, no?

1675
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:30,750
Do I look like...

1676
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:35,350
Do I look like a lost child in the woods?

1677
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:37,410
Yo, can you give me a...

1678
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:41,550
I wanted Dunkin' Donuts today, but I resisted.

1679
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,470
Stop.

1680
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:46,430
If you get Dunkin' Donuts, I'll get Dunkin' Donuts.

1681
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:47,550
Hello.

1682
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:50,790
This guy looks like Astarian from Baldur's Gate.

1683
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:52,610
Takoyaki guy.

1684
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:53,330
Octopus?

1685
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:54,530
Where is the octopus?

1686
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:56,710
Who cares about anything else?

1687
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:05,790
live life eating only octopus there was nothing else to eat
out there i was desperate i was fighting to survive to eat

1688
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:14,850
equals to live that's all there was to stay alive i ate
octopus like my life depended on it because it did and now i

1689
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:22,610
can't live without them anymore there's nothing in these by
the way japanese hysterian who makes takoyaki

1690
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:31,810
Oh my gosh, this A, this AU is crazy.

1691
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:36,930
They really just be putting characters in any situations
nowadays.

1692
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:43,350
My head is nothing but the eight-legged.

1693
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:47,290
Can't think about anything else, and nothing else moves my
heart like the octopus.

1694
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:53,770
Alright, you can like, you can replace this with the
two-legged.

1695
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:55,390
Can't think of anything else.

1696
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:57,630
Nothing else moves my heart like the minto.

1697
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:07,550
maybe my whole life is going to be nothing but minto ah
minto my one and only minto that writhing body wait a second

1698
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:19,330
the graceful way she changes shape every form is beautiful
you make me want to know more everything about you there's

1699
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:26,610
nothing else like her I want to see her up close touch her
and make her mine mine alone okay never mind I think the

1700
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:29,230
audio The dialogue got a little funky.

1701
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:30,210
You know what?

1702
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:32,090
What should I say to her?

1703
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:33,150
How should I act?

1704
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:34,210
Am I mad enough?

1705
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:38,770
Sounds like the old guy at the nearby parking lot has
something that can help you find the octopus.

1706
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:41,090
But I don't want to leave the octopus aside.

1707
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:43,510
Oh, yeah.

1708
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:44,610
Yay, yeah.

1709
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:45,730
Get back in there.

1710
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:47,590
Yeah, flip those balls.

1711
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:48,710
Flip those balls.

1712
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:50,290
Oh, new paint.

1713
01:57:56,490 --> 01:57:57,770
I want to go to the army.

1714
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,740
Oh, the mannequin in the water is scary.

1715
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:06,360
That's pretty freaky.

1716
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,320
Cute.

1717
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:13,100
I like how the shells even have different designs on the
back, you know.

1718
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,000
Easter egg, Easter egg.

1719
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:20,280
Umiclo.

1720
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,040
I don't know.

1721
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,060
Okay, I'm going to save and then we'll do this.

1722
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:24,480
Did I just save this one, right?

1723
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:27,840
Oh, oops.

1724
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,880
That's a money, money, money.

1725
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:32,920
Follow the money.

1726
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:34,340
Follow the money.

1727
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:37,860
Find the sonar at the parking lot.

1728
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:44,070
Wait, I didn't see this one.

1729
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:45,270
Cute.

1730
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:52,070
Guys, this is an obvious trap.

1731
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:54,250
This is an obvious trap.

1732
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:57,310
What if it was a cute girl saying all that about you?

1733
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:00,910
How can I resist?

1734
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:06,190
Oh, it's funny.

1735
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:09,950
Oh my god, the mannequins are so scary.

1736
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:15,610
How do the plants live?

1737
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:20,950
Nothing happened.

1738
01:59:21,230 --> 01:59:22,410
Did I not go down far enough?

1739
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:34,370
Is that something?

1740
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:38,080
You heard that.

1741
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,380
Totally safe.

1742
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:48,920
Hmm.

1743
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:55,210
Hmm.

1744
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:57,830
What's this?

1745
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:03,730
I don't trust...

1746
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:10,250
It's so funny because there's the spooky atmosphere of the
game and then it's like, oh by the way, thank you to our

1747
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:10,810
Patreon!

1748
02:00:11,290 --> 02:00:12,670
Thank you to our patrons!

Check out this cute little seashell!

1750
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:21,590
Umikuro!

1751
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:22,230
Umikuro!

1752
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:29,970
Who's in the water?

1753
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:31,330
The mannequins?

1754
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:33,790
Manikins are in the water.

1755
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:35,770
Drift on.

1756
02:00:35,870 --> 02:00:37,780
I don't know what that one is a...

1757
02:00:40,370 --> 02:00:41,290
Is a...

1758
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:42,310
reference to.

1759
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:49,620
Was there some?

1760
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:50,860
No, I think...

1761
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:54,840
I thought I saw something in the water, but I think I'm just
seeing, like, the light reflection.

1762
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:00,170
Hmm.

1763
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:05,530
Yeah?

1764
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:07,910
What's in here?

1765
02:01:12,610 --> 02:01:13,950
Oh, they're all clothes.

1766
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:17,870
Oh, oh, this is, I think it's another way to get up.

1767
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:20,370
Oh!

1768
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:22,550
You're real.

1769
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:27,850
There's another way to get out of the water.

1770
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:31,530
Oh, my God.

1771
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:34,130
Hold on.

1772
02:01:34,190 --> 02:01:38,490
I'm getting all the seashells by the seashore before...

1773
02:01:41,230 --> 02:01:42,610
All the shoes.

1774
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:44,450
All right.

1775
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:52,870
Isn't it kind of amazing how I'm going all out with my
fashion just to get that Takoyaki guy next door to notice

1776
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:53,370
me?

1777
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,280
Is that a hole in her dress?

1778
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,600
Or is that her hair clipping through?

1779
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:02,200
It almost looks like gills or something.

1780
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:04,580
Like when I first saw him, it was instant.

1781
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:05,500
Total spark.

1782
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:10,080
But then, ugh, he's obsessed with that octopus and he never
looks my way.

1783
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:11,320
Isn't that messed up?

1784
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:15,680
I need to get more stuff.

1785
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,600
I'll get his attention for sure.

1786
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:23,060
And like people in this world, their brains are basically
99% food.

1787
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:25,400
Especially that octopus.

1788
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,480
Even him, he's all octo-o-o.

1789
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,860
Like, gross.

1790
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,980
It camouflages and pops up out of nowhere, too.

1791
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,020
Literally the worst.

1792
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:34,180
Total nuisance.

1793
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:36,800
Oh, that sounds like it'll be fun.

1794
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,040
I want everything, but that octopus keeps ruining my plan.

1795
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:41,940
If there was some way to get rid of it.

1796
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,900
I'd owe you my life.

1797
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:46,940
Hey, can you take that octopus down?

1798
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:49,180
I feel like you can handle it.

1799
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:52,700
And the way you keep pushing forward, I genuinely respect
that.

1800
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:53,760
Money.

1801
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,620
The money is flying in front of me.

1802
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:57,100
Get rid of the octopus.

1803
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:00,500
And I'll give you something good, I swear.

1804
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,060
And me, someday, I'll...

1805
02:03:08,730 --> 02:03:11,730
This dress is standing up all on its own.

1806
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:14,790
World's stiffest dress ever.

1807
02:03:16,450 --> 02:03:17,970
Holy moly.

1808
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:23,290
I don't think I see anything in the water.

1809
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:25,310
I'm gonna save again though.

1810
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:30,630
By sheer willpower.

1811
02:03:31,210 --> 02:03:34,210
Yeah, it's ultimately, ultimate starched.

1812
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:36,850
Starched dress.

1813
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:42,580
Okay, okay.

1814
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,920
Knee boat.

1815
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:57,380
uh oh i did sell those guys okay i was like wait a second i
don't know if i sold them and they disappeared i'd be so sad

1816
02:03:57,380 --> 02:04:04,920
so we gotta go to the parking lot i feel like we probably
have enough money to get there but then apparently there's

1817
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:19,840
an octopus that might um that might sabotage us so let's
mark our map there and go go go just saved but i'll save

1818
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:33,880
again while we're in the boat right all right can't it's not
bad to be cautious you know oh like i see stuff on the

1819
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:47,500
bottom floor like that what is that oh you also get spooked
for me oh man okay

1820
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:53,190
good to know

1821
02:04:56,490 --> 02:05:06,950
there's like all this I was gonna say garbage it's just a
bunch of this is half fuel does this look like half fuel to

1822
02:05:06,950 --> 02:05:23,830
you guys what I like how this is the parking lot that's
pretty funny this is half fuel no just a guy I love the

1823
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:39,830
pictures of just a guy guy is this like is that a rock or
okay yeah huh oh oh pink actually pink what the oh I thought

1824
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:45,450
the guy disappeared oh that's paint it seems trying

1825
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:59,590
to see like what I see in the underwater you know oh I think
that big guy's coming back oh I I see him, I see him!

1826
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:17,550
The little baby hand is what's getting me.

1827
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:22,880
Why the heck is that?

1828
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,160
Oh, it's only a thousand yen.

1829
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:27,480
Oh!

1830
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,760
Oh, it has a face!

1831
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:32,000
It has a human face!

1832
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:37,660
Okay, we'll keep going for the flying fish.

1833
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:41,960
Ugh.

1834
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:44,900
I once saw a really strange human a long time ago.

1835
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:48,420
Couldn't even swim, but he drove his car straight into the
sea.

1836
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:49,840
I thought, what an idiot.

1837
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:52,380
But now I think I understand him a little.

1838
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,580
Fish are free.

1839
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:56,640
In that wide ocean, they go anywhere.

1840
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:58,600
Ah, sorry.

1841
02:06:58,920 --> 02:06:59,780
But what about humans?

1842
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:00,940
Stuck on land.

1843
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,520
Your world's so small.

1844
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:05,420
That's why humans drive cars, I guess.

1845
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:07,660
It's like swimming in the sea.

1846
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:09,880
You swim across land for freedom.

1847
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:13,300
If I can get this car fixed, maybe I'll be free again, too.

1848
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,140
Hey, you.

1849
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,880
The fish around here stole all four tires off my car.

1850
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:20,200
Sorry to ask, but could you bring them back for me?

1851
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:21,640
Okay, okay.

1852
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:23,520
So we gotta...

1853
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:24,880
Oh, he's got the sonar!

1854
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:25,840
Okay, all right.

1855
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:28,040
How do I...

1856
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:28,180
Oh.

1857
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,400
Place tire?

1858
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:33,120
Ooh.

1859
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:34,600
Nasty.

1860
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:38,880
I know, we're fixing up his K truck.

1861
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:40,820
Can I have it?

1862
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:42,180
Can I have a...

1863
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:43,960
Just, can I...

1864
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:48,200
I think I see two other ones even.

1865
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:55,250
Oh, okay.

1866
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:56,430
I have to grab them both.

1867
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:57,530
It seems.

1868
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:01,110
Why?

1869
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:02,110
How did they...

1870
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:03,630
How did they steal these?

1871
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:05,330
Ew.

1872
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:06,470
Ew.

1873
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:09,810
How did they steal the...

1874
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,930
the tires of the...

1875
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:16,470
That's a love that's concerning me.

1876
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:19,630
With their weird little hands.

1877
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:25,290
Oh, gross.

1878
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:28,090
There is so icky.

1879
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:37,090
It'd be nice if I could, like, steal some gasoline for my
boat, you know.

1880
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:45,060
They do look happy.

1881
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:47,040
Maybe life as a fish is better.

1882
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:48,520
Who knows?

1883
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:54,340
He didn't warn me about these things.

1884
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:57,680
The guy at the gasoline place.

1885
02:08:59,180 --> 02:08:59,780
Oh, thanks.

1886
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:00,800
Now I'm free again.

1887
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:04,300
You're not gonna drive it into the ocean.

1888
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:07,020
Oh, that's my... Oh.

1889
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,860
How long does it stay down there for?

1890
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:28,040
The whole time?

1891
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,280
Yay!

1892
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:40,160
Oh, it spooked me.

1893
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:43,200
Defeat the disguised octopus in the mall.

1894
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:46,120
In the mall.

1895
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:52,720
Right, there's quite a bit of fish around there.

1896
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:55,360
Like, uh, the flying guys.

1897
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:56,940
Of the flying variety.

1898
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,700
So I want to see if we can capture some.

1899
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:03,300
Um.

1900
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:05,640
Upgrade a little.

1901
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:10,100
Oh, that was so close.

1902
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:10,940
I feel.

1903
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:14,360
Maybe he was too far.

1904
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:15,880
Wow!

1905
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,300
The sky's octopus.

1906
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:21,860
Decoy octopus!

1907
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:25,720
This game was maybe meant...

1908
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:27,940
Oh, meant for me.

1909
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:33,180
Yes!

1910
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,440
Yes.

1911
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:36,480
Big money.

1912
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:38,000
Yes, big money.

1913
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:41,240
My boat's getting a little full.

1914
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,120
A little fall, a little fall.

1915
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:49,880
I don't think I can get that guy.

1916
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:51,520
I think that guy's up.

1917
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:53,860
Jump!

1918
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:55,820
Jump in front of me!

1919
02:10:58,700 --> 02:10:59,220
Somebody!

1920
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,520
Somebody, somewhere!

1921
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,320
Jump in front of me, please.

1922
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,320
It's too quiet.

1923
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:15,640
I don't even see anything like at the bottom of the sea.

1924
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:16,220
Oh.

1925
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:17,620
Ah!

1926
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:19,260
And...

1927
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:19,520
Ha!

1928
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:19,960
Oh.

1929
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:21,440
Okay.

1930
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:22,600
Let's go back.

1931
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:28,080
Let's go back.

1932
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:30,720
The big shellfish into that.

1933
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:31,760
That's too good.

1934
02:11:39,870 --> 02:11:40,910
The sun is...

1935
02:11:40,910 --> 02:11:41,550
Oh, not the sun.

1936
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:41,750
Sorry.

1937
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:43,610
The moon is moving so fast.

1938
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:48,150
Okay.

1939
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:50,410
Hello, sir.

1940
02:11:50,650 --> 02:11:52,510
I have some fish for you.

1941
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:04,650
Anything I can... I can upgrade my harpoon twice.

1942
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:06,910
Aim speed.

1943
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:07,930
Wait, what does that mean?

1944
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:09,590
I thought that's... Is that not me?

1945
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:14,170
Oh, I think like with how fast it like kind of does a... You
know.

1946
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:17,130
Let's do that.

1947
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:20,250
And let's do the range.

1948
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:26,150
I think those are pretty big points.

1949
02:12:31,230 --> 02:12:33,990
Let's also remember to have enough money to refuel.

1950
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:39,130
I just need so much money now.

1951
02:12:39,370 --> 02:12:41,270
Like crazy buku bucks, you know?

1952
02:12:43,510 --> 02:12:45,210
Oh, it is pretty...

1953
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:46,950
Dang it!

1954
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:55,930
The real is, the real end is not ideal either, I'll be
honest, but...

1955
02:12:57,490 --> 02:12:58,810
Wait, it was... Oh, here.

1956
02:12:58,990 --> 02:12:59,570
There we go.

1957
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:07,980
Yeah!

1958
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:12,520
Maybe the octopus will be worth a lot.

1959
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:13,740
Yeah, let's get to it.

1960
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:16,200
But also, what is the sonar for?

1961
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:21,080
There's like so much... Oh, oopsie.

1962
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:22,140
Oh, please, please.

1963
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:27,020
Thank you.

1964
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:34,220
Oh, this is just a tuna.

1965
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:38,280
These guys are around here too.

1966
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:41,540
Nah.

1967
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:42,460
Too.

1968
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:55,240
Anybody?

1969
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:17,940
I think he's going too far away.

1970
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:20,460
That's all right.

1971
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:23,960
We're looking around for any others.

1972
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:29,960
I'm not even gonna bother with the tunas, I'm not gonna lie.

1973
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:34,200
I'm sorry!

1974
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:37,800
Plop!

1975
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:42,900
Slap it on the ground, slap it on the ground.

1976
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:50,630
Oh my gosh, can you imagine?

1977
02:14:50,830 --> 02:14:52,410
I think, oh, it was too far away anyway.

1978
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:55,170
It's hard to tell sometimes.

1979
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:05,360
Okay, I'm gonna sell these before I forget, and then we'll
also save.

1980
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:15,360
I'm not good at timing it at all.

1981
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:20,580
He threw it on the ground.

1982
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:26,040
Sell, please.

1983
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:27,020
Sell, please.

1984
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:27,620
Sell, please.

1985
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:28,980
Shop.

1986
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:32,880
Sell, sell, sell!

1987
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:34,500
Nice.

1988
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:37,220
What are we at?

1989
02:15:42,650 --> 02:15:51,970
I think we should focus on the boat Because we'll need boat
speed to get to the next area

1990
02:15:55,390 --> 02:16:00,050
Probably Oh my god 30,000 Okay, let's do the octopus

1991
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:05,350
Which is what?

1992
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:22,740
Defeat the disguise octopus It's in the mall it says So It
says we need a sonar for it but oh my god okay fine fine

1993
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:27,460
fine i give

1994
02:16:33,150 --> 02:16:37,560
up i give up oh wait maybe i go oh like in here

1995
02:16:56,940 --> 02:17:01,920
oh i think

1996
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:06,780
i saw it

1997
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:24,490
Oh, the sound effects are...

1998
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:25,990
The worst, maybe.

1999
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:38,120
The sound effects are maybe so terrible.

2000
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:41,340
I don't see it, though.

2001
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:46,660
Let me point directly at it.

2002
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:52,560
I'm afraid to get too close.

2003
02:17:59,700 --> 02:18:01,460
Do you guys see it?

2004
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:04,320
Up, maybe?

2005
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:14,610
You think it's like up there?

2006
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:20,610
Oh, it's so bad.

2007
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:24,630
Ew, I just drive past really fast.

2008
02:18:28,730 --> 02:18:29,890
Oh, I see it!

2009
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:34,350
It's on the, oh my gosh, it's on the umi- the umi-kudo.

2010
02:18:37,170 --> 02:18:38,810
Oh, that's so funny!

2011
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:41,610
Okay.

2012
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:43,950
Oh, it's close again.

2013
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:52,910
So it's like a distorted version of something that it's
disguised as.

2014
02:18:54,590 --> 02:18:56,230
It says it's right in front of me again.

2015
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:05,370
It's so hard to see.

2016
02:19:06,770 --> 02:19:07,070
Ew.

2017
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:08,510
Is it this?

2018
02:19:08,730 --> 02:19:09,410
Oh, okay.

2019
02:19:11,070 --> 02:19:11,310
Oh!

2020
02:19:11,570 --> 02:19:13,250
Oh, that was just a thing in the- okay.

2021
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:15,370
The pillar!

2022
02:19:15,470 --> 02:19:17,470
I didn't even notice that the pillar was a thing.

2023
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:18,070
Okay.

2024
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:19,870
Or wasn't a thing.

2025
02:19:19,970 --> 02:19:20,450
That's so funny.

2026
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:25,960
Oh, over here.

2027
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:38,200
Oh!

2028
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:42,140
Oh!

2029
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:42,720
Oh!

2030
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:42,980
Oh!

2031
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:43,580
Oh!

2032
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:46,470
Oh!

2033
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:48,110
Please update, okay.

2034
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:00,680
Okay.

2035
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Oh, it's so freaky.

2036
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:04,160
Minto, I'm scared.

2037
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:13,200
Is that her?

2038
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:14,120
It

2039
02:20:21,630 --> 02:20:25,730
says that it's the octopus though.

2040
02:20:32,170 --> 02:20:33,830
Or is this it right there?

2041
02:20:39,530 --> 02:20:40,690
Oh no!

2042
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,960
Oh geez.

2043
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,700
That's not good.

2044
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,820
That doesn't seem good.

2045
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:50,580
That doesn't seem good.

2046
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:51,220
We're getting out.

2047
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,120
What's that on top of me?

2048
02:20:53,380 --> 02:20:54,360
Wait, what's that on top of me?

2049
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:55,780
Wait, what's that on top of me?

2050
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:57,820
Oh, oh, oh!

2051
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:05,820
Talk to I do!

2052
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:07,860
I think we have more pressing matters!

2053
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:12,500
Oh, guys, Jaws was just coming after me!

2054
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:21,340
Sorry, sorry, mister.

2055
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:29,540
That was freaky.

2056
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:32,840
I don't know if I was supposed to shoot it or what.

2057
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:35,380
Thanks for taking the octopus down.

2058
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,600
I really thought if it was gone, he'd finally look my way.

2059
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:40,100
Well, a promise is a promise.

2060
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:41,440
Here, this is for you.

2061
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,000
Thank you!

2062
02:21:51,630 --> 02:21:52,690
One more bell.

2063
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:56,230
Is it still in there, I wonder?

2064
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:02,250
No.

2065
02:22:02,650 --> 02:22:03,930
I think we just made him mad.

2066
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:05,350
Sorry, mister.

2067
02:22:08,950 --> 02:22:10,290
Sorry about that.

2068
02:22:13,210 --> 02:22:17,430
Alright, that means just one more area, right?

2069
02:22:17,970 --> 02:22:19,750
But we gotta fish a lot.

2070
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:20,850
We gotta upgrade our...

2071
02:22:20,850 --> 02:22:25,350
We gotta really lock in on these fish so we can upgrade our
boat.

2072
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:37,300
Defeated the octopus.

2073
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:40,320
So you took the octopus down, huh?

2074
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:41,920
Did you meet the Takoyaki guy?

2075
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,380
His obsession with the octopus was rather intense.

2076
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:46,980
When he took her down, something in him snapped.

2077
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:49,280
At first, I thought his instincts just snapped.

2078
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:52,620
But this is way beyond hangry.

2079
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:57,480
Maybe some kind of hot emotion got mixed in, too.

2080
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:58,800
Like a lust?

2081
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:01,340
He turned into a shark, huh?

2082
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:04,180
His feelings were so strong, it turned right in front of
you.

2083
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,920
I've never seen that before.

2084
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,480
Oh, well, not our problem, right?

2085
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:11,480
Let's just keep fishing like always.

2086
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:25,060
I brought back two bells was it two bells I marked the new
places good luck oh wait there is this area too just kidding

2087
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:33,980
oh we had two I didn't realize it was two bells uh oh wait
that means it's gonna be like really big oh that's no good

2088
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:46,880
okay awesome I guess not you know I guess in that new the
newer area we'll get another piece and then in the last area

2089
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:58,840
we'll get a piece most likely but we we can't do anything
until we get level three most likely so oh let's lock in

2090
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:12,560
gamers let's lock I'm not half fuel don't lie to me I said
there was stuff at the bottom of the sea oh yes oh my god i

2091
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:13,880
didn't think i was gonna get that one

2092
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:22,120
that used the sonar to find it but like what

2093
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:28,900
yes oh yeah let's save the game true true true

2094
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:43,540
what about the giant guy i wonder if we could get him i was
thinking that too i feel like i cheesed the other guy maybe

2095
02:24:44,420 --> 02:25:02,180
this guy's I mean he seems slower because he's massive we
could try why not I do feel like though the these these guys

2096
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:12,980
are like kind of the way to go I don't want to waste fuel
trying to chase after the big guy you know what I mean ah

2097
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:19,120
he was

2098
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:36,050
I imagine he's probably worth like 50,000 if I had to guess

2099
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:43,180
if I had to guess

2100
02:25:52,510 --> 02:26:07,890
hold on I'm gonna have a sweater on and I'm taking it off
you'd guess 80k 80k oh I don't Oh, he might have a tablet

2101
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:08,110
though.

2102
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:08,710
You're right.

2103
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:10,290
Oh, you're right.

2104
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:11,190
You're right.

2105
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:12,090
You're right.

2106
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:13,630
Okay, okay.

2107
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:14,650
You're right.

2108
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,310
Let's go.

2109
02:26:17,890 --> 02:26:18,270
Let's go.

2110
02:26:18,510 --> 02:26:19,170
Get our dino.

2111
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:21,190
Fish.

2112
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:23,390
Where is he anyway?

2113
02:26:24,930 --> 02:26:26,870
Okay, she's like out this way.

2114
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:28,110
This way.

2115
02:26:28,690 --> 02:26:29,390
This way.

2116
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:34,950
Oh, I'm gonna save.

2117
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:39,270
Just in case.

2118
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:43,490
He, um, like, attacks.

2119
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:46,830
And our little boat can't take it.

2120
02:26:46,930 --> 02:26:47,790
Our little poor boat.

2121
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:52,210
Oh, the lighting, like, freaks me out.

2122
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:52,690
Okay.

2123
02:26:55,130 --> 02:26:56,950
I'm getting old and forgetting things.

2124
02:26:57,370 --> 02:26:58,610
Forgot why the world is flooded.

2125
02:27:00,050 --> 02:27:01,650
Forgot why we are hunting sakanas.

2126
02:27:03,230 --> 02:27:07,090
Forgot why there is giant sakana chasing us outside of safe
areas.

2127
02:27:08,010 --> 02:27:08,410
Cubay?

2128
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:10,850
You are not old.

2129
02:27:12,090 --> 02:27:13,190
None of that has been explained.

2130
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:18,450
Quite literally, I have no idea.

2131
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:23,710
Quite literally, I couldn't tell you.

2132
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:27,710
Wait, this goes out kind of far, no?

2133
02:27:27,770 --> 02:27:28,730
Oh, there he is, there he is.

2134
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:36,640
This thing is huge.

2135
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:38,920
This guy is big.

2136
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:49,800
Maybe I have to get his...

2137
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:51,160
eyes or something.

2138
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:00,540
Like that.

2139
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:14,460
Ah,

2140
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:29,180
okay, okay, okay.

2141
02:28:30,700 --> 02:28:34,640
It's probably like a get him multiple times kind of
scenario.

2142
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:38,600
Okay, this away, this away, this away.

2143
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:40,600
My gas though!

2144
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:43,900
This is pretty tough, I feel.

2145
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:47,920
Okay, we'll do our best.

2146
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:51,180
He's just a peaceful guy.

2147
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:54,420
Yeah, but I crave cash.

2148
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:57,540
Money hungry people are not peaceful.

2149
02:29:03,490 --> 02:29:04,450
Lesson learned.

2150
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:07,610
Oh, he's far.

2151
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,610
He's far away.

2152
02:29:11,070 --> 02:29:12,390
Oh, he's quite far.

2153
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:14,510
What the heck?

2154
02:29:14,650 --> 02:29:16,550
Why is it telling me now I'm just at the mall?

2155
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:19,510
Is he outside the...

2156
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:20,390
Scope?

2157
02:29:21,330 --> 02:29:23,590
Oh, he's in this area!

2158
02:29:23,890 --> 02:29:25,130
Oh, I just realized!

2159
02:29:25,550 --> 02:29:27,570
Okay, so we got him for...

2160
02:29:27,570 --> 02:29:28,150
This time...

2161
02:29:28,150 --> 02:29:30,890
Oh, I'm stupid.

2162
02:29:32,310 --> 02:29:33,090
I don't even notice.

2163
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:35,570
Okay, well, um...

2164
02:29:36,370 --> 02:29:38,910
Well, we got him for this area, so we go to the next...

2165
02:29:38,910 --> 02:29:40,810
That means I gotta keep fishing.

2166
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:43,490
Uh-oh.

2167
02:29:44,110 --> 02:29:46,290
How do I get to the rooftop?

2168
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:51,950
We still haven't been able to.

2169
02:29:53,230 --> 02:29:54,290
It has to be away.

2170
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:55,990
It has to be.

2171
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:06,600
Trying to get on top of my boat.

2172
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,280
And then use...

2173
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:09,520
I wish I could double jump.

2174
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:15,800
I know I have to keep playing the game.

2175
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:19,900
No.

2176
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:22,500
Maybe this side over here.

2177
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:27,600
I didn't see any shops that we could go.

2178
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:28,980
into at all.

2179
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,840
This one looks even taller.

2180
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:36,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2181
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:41,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2182
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:43,440
No,

2183
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:48,940
I don't think so.

2184
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:51,980
I don't think so.

2185
02:30:57,220 --> 02:30:59,260
All right, let's go fishing.

2186
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:02,940
Fish at the bottom of the water.

2187
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:08,970
We could try over here.

2188
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:14,650
Seem to be fish around these parts.

2189
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:19,240
Oh, oops.

2190
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:22,320
Oh, oops.

2191
02:31:24,220 --> 02:31:28,780
Oh, there were two of them, though.

2192
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:32,440
No, we had our chance.

2193
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:33,520
We had our chance.

2194
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:36,240
It's easier to see them, too, around here, so it's...

2195
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:37,420
little nicer.

2196
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:40,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, gosh, they're so fast.

2197
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:42,160
Holy moly.

2198
02:31:56,970 --> 02:32:00,570
I really thought maybe we had a chance at that one.

2199
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:05,250
They are just zooming.

2200
02:32:06,410 --> 02:32:07,610
Oh, to be a flying.

2201
02:32:07,630 --> 02:32:08,110
Fish.

2202
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:09,250
Seems kind of fun.

2203
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:11,030
Best of both worlds, right?

2204
02:32:12,130 --> 02:32:12,270
Oh.

2205
02:32:13,070 --> 02:32:13,510
Ah!

2206
02:32:14,510 --> 02:32:14,910
Please!

2207
02:32:15,570 --> 02:32:15,570
Please!

2208
02:32:18,830 --> 02:32:21,230
This would make a great friend slop game.

2209
02:32:21,390 --> 02:32:22,130
You think so?

2210
02:32:23,970 --> 02:32:24,410
Hmm.

2211
02:32:25,930 --> 02:32:26,590
Oh, dang it.

2212
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:27,170
I missed him.

2213
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:32,360
Ha!

2214
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:34,020
Oh, I knew it.

2215
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:34,140
I knew it.

2216
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:35,000
I stood as I did it.

2217
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:36,300
I was like, no, there's no way.

2218
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:39,900
Ah!

2219
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:46,040
Yes.

2220
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:58,240
The thing is, is I feel like there's so many fishing friend
swap games, which I'm not complaining because like I said, I

2221
02:32:58,240 --> 02:32:59,440
love me some fish.

2222
02:32:59,700 --> 02:33:00,200
I love fishing.

2223
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:01,840
We should not wish fishing.

2224
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:04,540
And this is a little different from fishing.

2225
02:33:04,760 --> 02:33:05,700
It's harpooning.

2226
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:13,660
I have to be FPS master to do it.

2227
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:18,640
But...

2228
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:20,180
That is what it is.

2229
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:24,940
What is Umigari and never heard of it?

2230
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:27,260
It's the newest Chillas art game.

2231
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:34,120
Where we are in a mysterious flooded world where human are
fish and fish are human.

2232
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:37,760
And so technically these fish that were like...

2233
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:41,640
Harpooning here could be human.

2234
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:44,120
And I think I'm a fish.

2235
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:45,680
I just noticed.

2236
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:47,820
I think their wings are hands, aren't they?

2237
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:52,460
Literally my point.

2238
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:53,900
I said could be.

2239
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:54,920
They are human.

2240
02:33:57,620 --> 02:33:59,200
This is a great spot, you guys.

2241
02:34:01,160 --> 02:34:01,640
What the?

2242
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:03,980
Who were you?

2243
02:34:04,660 --> 02:34:05,660
Who were you?

2244
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:07,460
I wasn't even paying attention to you.

2245
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:09,480
Wait, what is that?

2246
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:10,520
What is that?

2247
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:16,800
Oh, this is a new one.

2248
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:31,140
holy oh it's only 3 000 yen though yeah going for the fast
guys seems to be the best easiest way to get money oh that

2249
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:42,620
is oh oh i kind of want to see its face better oh maybe i
don't want to see its face the ear i don't know what it is

2250
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:46,000
but the ears are the things that are disturbing me the most
about it

2251
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:50,540
Don't like that!

2252
02:34:50,740 --> 02:34:51,520
Don't like that!

2253
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:57,300
My radar is showing like no fish.

2254
02:34:57,420 --> 02:34:58,120
Where'd they go?

2255
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:02,220
Have I...

2256
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:07,520
Have I taken all the fish in the whole world?

2257
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:09,060
The whole sea?

2258
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:14,760
Nothing else is... Okay, well...

2259
02:35:15,380 --> 02:35:17,600
For now we'll just uh...

2260
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:21,240
We'll drive away and we'll go sell what we got.

2261
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:25,060
Stay, hang in there, fish.

2262
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:25,640
Hang in there.

2263
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:29,600
I have to fill up anyway, so...

2264
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:34,420
Alrighty.

2265
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:36,780
Hello, I'm here.

2266
02:35:37,260 --> 02:35:38,600
Hello, I'm here.

2267
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:43,260
Alright, my hall is massive this time.

2268
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:46,660
I try to jump off of that every time and I miss.

2269
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:50,500
Please, sir.

2270
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:51,420
Can I have a hand?

2271
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:58,880
27,000.

2272
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:02,040
We can get the boat speed.

2273
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:09,380
We can get the boat speed.

2274
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:17,860
I almost want to get that and then the harpoon reel.

2275
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:21,480
I'm like debating about the boost.

2276
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:22,460
I can't even...

2277
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:23,540
Oh, sonar scans.

2278
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:25,020
Oh, wow.

2279
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:26,320
The boost?

2280
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:30,640
Like, you can't even use it in the bell areas, so...

2281
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:39,570
What will the fuel capacity be after that then?

2282
02:36:40,150 --> 02:36:41,350
Holy cow!

2283
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:44,590
Hmm.

2284
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:47,250
I want the harpoon reel.

2285
02:36:50,270 --> 02:36:52,430
We can get...

2286
02:36:52,430 --> 02:36:53,990
a few more here.

2287
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:55,410
Oh, uh...

2288
02:36:57,450 --> 02:36:59,450
Holy cow, that used so much...

2289
02:37:01,910 --> 02:37:02,790
Okay, never mind.

2290
02:37:03,150 --> 02:37:04,110
I changed my mind.

2291
02:37:09,130 --> 02:37:10,650
What is... why does the E mean?

2292
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:14,490
What does the E mean?

2293
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:19,160
Ah!

2294
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,880
What does the E mean?

2295
02:37:24,900 --> 02:37:28,140
Oh, it was that... Oh, okay.

2296
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:32,320
The wings are definitely hands in the budget dredge games.

2297
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:35,720
It makes me wonder if Chilla's art took inspiration for
Black Salt games.

2298
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:36,600
If so, I like.

2299
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:37,840
Maybe, maybe.

2300
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:39,540
Uh, okay.

2301
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:40,660
That's fine.

2302
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:41,680
We just leave here.

2303
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,680
As travel to First Island.

2304
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:44,240
Alright.

2305
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:46,940
Hokey-dokey!

2306
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,360
I think that's our place down there.

2307
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:50,900
Yes, sir.

2308
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:55,920
This away!

2309
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:00,600
And once I get closer to the Tori, I will...

2310
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:02,240
save

2311
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:10,280
truly i walk on nine

2312
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:25,300
all right yes let's go let's go

2313
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:35,340
okay i

2314
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:41,500
actually missed the sign Are you okay?

2315
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:42,620
We're fine.

2316
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,800
I did miss, but I saved it.

2317
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:49,600
I saved the run.

2318
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:52,480
I saved the run.

2319
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:53,840
How do I get out of here?

2320
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:55,640
Oh, here it is.

2321
02:38:58,640 --> 02:38:58,780
Oh!

2322
02:38:59,240 --> 02:38:59,640
Oh!

2323
02:39:10,950 --> 02:39:13,570
I was about to say, we're not gonna make it!

2324
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:14,630
We're not gonna make it!

2325
02:39:14,990 --> 02:39:16,010
We made it!

2326
02:39:21,560 --> 02:39:23,440
It has to be designed like that, right?

2327
02:39:23,620 --> 02:39:25,360
Where are we at?

2328
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:26,340
Is this a hospital?

2329
02:39:26,620 --> 02:39:27,000
Don't tell me.

2330
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:28,260
Spooky.

2331
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:35,200
Oh, head to...

2332
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:35,760
No way!

2333
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:36,220
Dome!

2334
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:38,860
Like a... It does kind of look like a Tokyo Dome.

2335
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:39,880
I'm not gonna lie.

2336
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:41,540
Hello!

2337
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:42,360
Excuse me.

2338
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:44,340
Stop sneezing and being disgusting.

2339
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:49,740
Um, how do you usually get from place to place?

2340
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:56,400
But listen, I put together an organization so we can work
together and survive this world.

2341
02:39:57,340 --> 02:40:00,080
If you see my people in trouble, I'd be happy if you lend
them a hand.

2342
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,080
Wait, that didn't answer or anything.

2343
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:05,240
The dome.

2344
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:08,160
What about the fish here?

2345
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:10,740
Down here, they are lurking on the sea floor.

2346
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:13,780
You'll think, no way I can catch it down there, right?

2347
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:16,520
That's when you should use bait.

2348
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:20,260
But there's a fish that'll mess with you, so be careful.

2349
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:22,260
It spits out ink and turns everything black.

2350
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:25,880
When that fish isn't around, do the best... That's the best
time to use bait.

2351
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:27,180
Don't waste it, okay?

2352
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:29,720
I don't have any bait.

2353
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:32,680
Get baited?

2354
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:42,160
So it says the dome first, so let's go to the dome, and
let's also save.

2355
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:48,500
I can't even see anything.

2356
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:51,520
Ophish.

2357
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:53,780
Lucky guess.

2358
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:56,540
Dang.

2359
02:40:56,980 --> 02:40:57,940
Can you imagine?

2360
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:03,770
What are you?

2361
02:41:04,370 --> 02:41:07,070
Oh, you're really not going to stop.

2362
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:10,770
You're gonna say it's for the good of the world, aren't you?

2363
02:41:11,230 --> 02:41:12,050
What a joke.

2364
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:13,990
I know what you really are.

2365
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:16,510
This isn't duty, it's pleasure.

2366
02:41:17,670 --> 02:41:18,890
It's cruel, isn't it?

2367
02:41:18,950 --> 02:41:21,410
How the world turns you into the very thing you hated?

2368
02:41:21,870 --> 02:41:23,290
The second you're on top.

2369
02:41:25,030 --> 02:41:25,810
How much are you worth?

2370
02:41:28,430 --> 02:41:29,470
Big money!

2371
02:41:51,090 --> 02:42:01,290
I'm just selling it so that we can go over to the actually I
will get the harpoon reel now though look at that the reel

2372
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:10,870
in is important because I feel like you then can move on to
another fish faster you know what I mean there's a boat over

2373
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:14,970
here you could probably bait the fish by winking and
giggling at them.

2374
02:42:15,730 --> 02:42:16,870
A little fish!

2375
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:19,050
A little fish!

2376
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:19,850
Ah!

2377
02:42:20,830 --> 02:42:21,310
Ah!

2378
02:42:21,650 --> 02:42:21,910
Ah!

2379
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:24,210
Oh no, that's not a big fish.

2380
02:42:25,370 --> 02:42:25,370
Ah!

2381
02:42:26,510 --> 02:42:30,770
Oh, big fish.

2382
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:35,010
That's not a big fish.

2383
02:42:35,290 --> 02:42:36,590
Wait, that's a big fish?

2384
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:47,960
Oh that's the inky one!

2385
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:49,260
That's the inky one.

2386
02:42:53,450 --> 02:42:55,790
Ooh, there's a light on in there.

2387
02:42:56,190 --> 02:42:56,290
Creepy.

2388
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:57,690
Okay, anyway.

2389
02:43:01,270 --> 02:43:02,330
Someone's boat, eh?

2390
02:43:03,350 --> 02:43:04,170
Head to Dome.

2391
02:43:05,090 --> 02:43:05,470
I'm here.

2392
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:09,430
Look, they have a whole fleet!

2393
02:43:10,530 --> 02:43:11,590
Wait, the music's cool.

2394
02:43:13,430 --> 02:43:13,790
Hello!

2395
02:43:16,050 --> 02:43:18,850
Man, this is bad.

2396
02:43:20,690 --> 02:43:21,850
Oh, is he a fish?

2397
02:43:22,170 --> 02:43:26,010
The guy who was in charge of catching fish disappeared at
the nearby dorm.

2398
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:28,830
He took the bait machine with him.

2399
02:43:29,070 --> 02:43:30,990
I can't make any deliveries without it.

2400
02:43:31,830 --> 02:43:32,170
Wait a second.

2401
02:43:32,550 --> 02:43:34,670
Let me get a closer look at you.

2402
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:35,510
Oh!

2403
02:43:35,690 --> 02:43:37,330
He's wearing a disguise!

2404
02:43:38,630 --> 02:43:39,930
It's a mask!

2405
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:41,750
Oh my god.

2406
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:43,330
Wait, what the heck?

2407
02:43:45,630 --> 02:43:46,070
Fish.

2408
02:43:49,790 --> 02:43:52,450
So we gotta go to the dorm over there, huh?

2409
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:55,730
Oh, next time we go to the...

2410
02:43:56,690 --> 02:43:58,670
Is this supposed to be Tokyo Dome?

2411
02:44:00,090 --> 02:44:02,450
Next time we go back to the gas station, we'll,

2412
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:05,670
uh...

2413
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:05,930
Oops.

2414
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:07,210
Getting all top.

2415
02:44:07,390 --> 02:44:07,630
Whoa!

2416
02:44:10,030 --> 02:44:12,390
Do you see how many fish are in there?

2417
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:14,690
Can I have a bite?

2418
02:44:16,730 --> 02:44:19,010
Please, uh, spare me one fish.

2419
02:44:20,270 --> 02:44:23,150
Lisa, a single fish.

2420
02:44:25,010 --> 02:44:27,570
We'll change my boat color is what I've been trying to say.

2421
02:44:28,930 --> 02:44:29,350
Maybe I can...

2422
02:44:29,350 --> 02:44:30,650
Wait, maybe I can get in like this.

2423
02:44:31,490 --> 02:44:32,090
Watch this.

2424
02:44:33,930 --> 02:44:34,510
Watch this.

2425
02:44:35,410 --> 02:44:36,090
We're gonna get in.

2426
02:44:36,810 --> 02:44:38,130
We're gonna get into the dome.

2427
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:40,110
Alright, use your arms.

2428
02:44:40,890 --> 02:44:41,590
Use your arms.

2429
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:42,230
You're a human.

2430
02:44:42,930 --> 02:44:43,970
You're a human now.

2431
02:44:45,550 --> 02:44:46,810
You're a human now.

2432
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,160
The door, man.

2433
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:07,280
All right, metal gear style.

2434
02:45:12,090 --> 02:45:13,930
All right, I'm definitely going to save because I'm scared.

2435
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:19,870
I keep creating new ones because I'm lazy-ish.

2436
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:21,530
Oh, no, this is not a lie.

2437
02:45:21,750 --> 02:45:22,610
It's a seashell.

2438
02:45:25,250 --> 02:45:25,810
Chicken.

2439
02:45:27,290 --> 02:45:27,710
All right.

2440
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:34,300
Oh, here we are.

2441
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:36,420
Oh, I'm scared.

2442
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:39,040
Oh, it's scary.

2443
02:45:55,260 --> 02:45:58,000
Am I gonna be fighting things in here with my harpoon?

2444
02:45:58,420 --> 02:46:00,100
That's what I'm worried about.

2445
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:11,980
Hello, Mr. Baitman!

2446
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:16,580
The man with the bait!

2447
02:46:20,750 --> 02:46:22,690
Oh, the water's all funky here.

2448
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:26,570
The man with the bait!

2449
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:33,000
It's dark!

2450
02:46:36,820 --> 02:46:38,800
For a ghost you're rather cowardly.

2451
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:40,500
What are you talking about?

2452
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:43,040
I deal with a paranormal, not fish!

2453
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:52,340
I don't deal...

2454
02:47:01,300 --> 02:47:02,360
What the heck is that?

2455
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:06,140
Ah!

2456
02:47:06,820 --> 02:47:08,520
Wait, I think I just got punched in the head.

2457
02:47:09,380 --> 02:47:11,020
Wait, what just happened?

2458
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:14,660
Wait a second.

2459
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:16,220
What just happened?

2460
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:17,680
What just happened?

2461
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:28,980
Maybe I was supposed to spear him.

2462
02:47:31,180 --> 02:47:32,000
Wait a second.

2463
02:47:44,550 --> 02:47:47,150
I don't know, actually, what is supposed to happen.

2464
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,860
Oh, I got attacked from behind!

2465
02:47:57,740 --> 02:47:59,060
That's what happened!

2466
02:48:00,060 --> 02:48:01,180
Oh, my God.

2467
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:04,240
There really are guys attacking me here.

2468
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:04,540
No.

2469
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:08,660
Oh, geez.

2470
02:48:09,900 --> 02:48:11,320
Wait, I said I could open this.

2471
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:11,920
Is that going to go?

2472
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:12,680
Now it's gone.

2473
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:12,980
Wait.

2474
02:48:18,300 --> 02:48:19,060
There's a shale.

2475
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:24,960
Okay.

2476
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:27,140
Oh, man.

2477
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:30,740
I kind of hear them, like, coming up, though.

2478
02:48:31,860 --> 02:48:32,720
Or at least I did.

2479
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:35,860
Please.

2480
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:38,900
Mr. The water is being funky here.

2481
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:51,400
Oh, that don't look good.

2482
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:54,400
Oh, that don't look good.

2483
02:48:58,290 --> 02:49:00,190
Oh, is he alive?

2484
02:49:00,270 --> 02:49:01,150
Oh, I think he's alive.

2485
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:05,230
Wow, this place is...

2486
02:49:05,230 --> 02:49:06,810
That kind of does look like a prison, though.

2487
02:49:08,410 --> 02:49:10,250
It's such a small apartment.

2488
02:49:13,410 --> 02:49:14,630
I can get him from here.

2489
02:49:17,570 --> 02:49:19,890
Yeah, that's right.

2490
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:25,100
Yeah, that's right.

2491
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:29,380
Mito is the one who knocks.

2492
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:32,880
I am the one who knocks.

2493
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:38,100
Oh, hold on.

2494
02:49:38,220 --> 02:49:39,120
Let's save real quick.

2495
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:52,350
I know one of these rooms was gonna jump scare us like
crazy.

2496
02:49:55,350 --> 02:49:56,670
I don't like it in here.

2497
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:58,390
I don't like it one bit.

2498
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:11,000
I wish I could, like, have my harpoon, like, armed, and also
open doors.

2499
02:50:13,940 --> 02:50:15,280
He's probably in here, right?

2500
02:50:16,300 --> 02:50:17,260
Are you in here?

2501
02:50:17,700 --> 02:50:17,840
Oh.

2502
02:50:18,760 --> 02:50:20,040
A guy is in here.

2503
02:50:21,580 --> 02:50:22,620
What am I saying?

2504
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:24,280
Why are you posed like that?

2505
02:50:27,980 --> 02:50:29,780
I don't know what I'm looking for here.

2506
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:34,120
I'm a little...

2507
02:50:34,660 --> 02:50:36,720
We're looking for a guy with a bait machine?

2508
02:50:39,850 --> 02:50:43,490
I can't go up anymore either, so...

2509
02:50:46,300 --> 02:50:47,640
Guy with the bait machine.

2510
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:50,020
Okay, we're on 7.

2511
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:51,380
Sorry, I keep making through saves.

2512
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:00,300
Oh, there's more blood there.

2513
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:04,060
Oye, oye, oye, oye, oye, oye, oye.

2514
02:51:09,010 --> 02:51:09,990
Oh!

2515
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:12,390
Oh!

2516
02:51:17,770 --> 02:51:18,190
Oh!

2517
02:51:18,810 --> 02:51:21,110
Suddenly it's a zombie game.

2518
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:26,340
Suddenly playing Half-Life.

2519
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:29,500
Ew, nasty.

2520
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:33,120
Sneak attack!

2521
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:36,660
Is that him down there?

2522
02:51:37,420 --> 02:51:38,040
Might be.

2523
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:42,420
Might be, might be.

2524
02:51:47,930 --> 02:51:49,970
I hear one walking.

2525
02:51:53,150 --> 02:51:54,450
Oh, there he is!

2526
02:52:02,310 --> 02:52:04,650
They're kind of slow, which is nice.

2527
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:11,910
They're a little slow.

2528
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:18,820
I can't see in here.

2529
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:20,320
I don't like that.

2530
02:52:23,500 --> 02:52:23,640
Ooh.

2531
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:25,800
Ooh.

2532
02:52:26,940 --> 02:52:28,020
Just making sure he's dead.

2533
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:29,620
Finishing the job.

2534
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:31,780
How's the fishing?

2535
02:52:36,340 --> 02:52:36,860
We're...

2536
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:37,240
Ah!

2537
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:39,140
He got me from behind!

2538
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:42,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2539
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:43,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2540
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:46,520
You can't have me going through all that again.

2541
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:17,960
Quick load.

2542
02:53:30,970 --> 02:53:32,130
What?

2543
02:53:37,730 --> 02:53:38,310
Why?

2544
02:53:41,570 --> 02:53:41,830
No!

2545
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:46,400
Oh, why?

2546
02:53:48,920 --> 02:53:50,000
Save six?

2547
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:51,740
Yeah, this is a save six.

2548
02:54:04,430 --> 02:54:07,370
I mean, it's not that I'm...

2549
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:10,230
Wait, but my money...

2550
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:13,870
Was I only at 2700?

2551
02:54:14,970 --> 02:54:16,110
I don't know.

2552
02:54:16,590 --> 02:54:18,130
I don't remember what my money was at.

2553
02:54:20,550 --> 02:54:21,510
No way.

2554
02:54:21,850 --> 02:54:22,730
No way.

2555
02:54:25,630 --> 02:54:28,450
Yeah, it shows that we've been to the area even.

2556
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:34,520
Oh, what?

2557
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,660
Do I, can I at least fast travel to it?

2558
02:54:38,860 --> 02:54:39,220
Probably.

2559
02:54:42,260 --> 02:54:43,100
Yeah, we can.

2560
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:46,700
Okay, not all is lost.

2561
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:47,640
I'm just annoyed.

2562
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:52,760
Let's, uh...

2563
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:53,780
Oh, cute!

2564
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:56,200
Whoa!

2565
02:54:57,380 --> 02:54:58,840
Let's do the pink boat.

2566
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:01,280
What's the red boat?

2567
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:01,660
Ooh.

2568
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:11,740
Go back to save seven then?

2569
02:55:12,100 --> 02:55:12,880
I guess so, yeah.

2570
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:13,680
Load.

2571
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:15,580
I hope I don't have to do the whole...

2572
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:17,580
What's it called?

2573
02:55:19,340 --> 02:55:20,780
Oh, those guys again.

2574
02:55:21,860 --> 02:55:24,740
Yeah, so you save seven and kiss the zombies you killed,
save the...

2575
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:25,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2576
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:27,020
That's true.

2577
02:55:28,260 --> 02:55:28,820
Think.

2578
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:34,440
Ah, what the heck?

2579
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:36,660
What the heck?

2580
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:39,620
What's the point of saving then?

2581
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,740
Whoa, wait, is that a big guy?

2582
02:55:51,670 --> 02:56:06,830
yes it is you know what wait I'm confused actually I'm

02:56:21,430 --> 02:56:26,750

2585
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:28,970
Wait, wait.

2586
02:56:29,230 --> 02:56:30,210
Oh, I think I grabbed them both.

2587
02:56:30,450 --> 02:56:30,750
My bad.

2588
02:56:35,720 --> 02:56:36,980
I'm a little confused.

2589
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:42,000
If...

2590
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,280
This shows...

2591
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:45,500
I don't remember how much money I had, must have I think.

2592
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:48,880
I don't remember how much money I had.

2593
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:54,400
Don't get too close to me, though.

2594
02:56:54,700 --> 02:56:55,580
Which is holding harpoon.

2595
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:56,400
Yeah, for real.

2596
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:01,020
Oh, oops, wait, hold on.

2597
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:01,420
Upgrade.

2598
02:57:01,980 --> 02:57:02,540
Oh, my bad.

2599
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:02,980
Sorry.

2600
02:57:03,760 --> 02:57:03,980
Upgrade.

2601
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:09,900
Okay, so my harpoon reel.

2602
02:57:10,840 --> 02:57:12,540
Okay, I guess I did have just that much money.

2603
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:13,480
Hmm.

2604
02:57:14,120 --> 02:57:14,380
Okay.

2605
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:17,540
Okay, I guess I did spend a lot of it.

2606
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:19,260
Okay, okay, okay.

2607
02:57:19,900 --> 02:57:20,500
Okay, okay.

2608
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:24,420
Yeah, I had upgraded the harpoon reel.

2609
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:28,660
Okay.

2610
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:34,080
How...

2611
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:35,280
How...

2612
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:41,040
How could this happen to me?

2613
02:57:48,390 --> 02:57:49,050
Yes.

2614
02:57:51,150 --> 02:57:53,330
These guys are good money, so...

2615
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:54,990
Might as well grab them when I see them.

2616
02:58:02,830 --> 02:58:05,410
I really hope those guys don't respawn.

2617
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:06,350
Because they scare me.

2618
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:07,330
Okay.

2619
02:58:08,330 --> 02:58:09,530
They scare me!

2620
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:13,250
Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna save out here.

2621
02:58:14,710 --> 02:58:17,210
I guess I save over this one, it doesn't even matter.

2622
02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:18,370
I save out here.

2623
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:21,430
And...

2624
02:58:22,770 --> 02:58:23,710
I don't know.

2625
02:58:24,250 --> 02:58:25,010
I don't know.

2626
02:58:25,410 --> 02:58:25,970
Who knows?

2627
02:58:26,710 --> 02:58:27,570
Who knows?

2628
02:58:28,650 --> 02:58:31,230
There's like something out, like...

2629
02:58:31,230 --> 02:58:33,190
I saw the fins out of the water.

2630
02:58:33,850 --> 02:58:35,550
I'm just gonna go to the second story.

2631
02:58:36,790 --> 02:58:38,310
And hope that that's where...

2632
02:58:38,330 --> 02:58:39,650
I needed to go to.

2633
02:58:40,410 --> 02:58:42,010
There's a lighthouse over there!

2634
02:58:42,810 --> 02:58:43,650
You guys see that?

2635
02:58:48,370 --> 02:58:48,930
Interesting.

2636
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:56,640
All the doors are shut.

2637
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:04,880
I sure hope not.

2638
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:08,420
It didn't save.

2639
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:11,540
Oh, it didn't save in here.

2640
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:14,280
No.

2641
02:59:18,020 --> 02:59:18,220
Why?

2642
02:59:18,220 --> 02:59:19,240
There was a guy behind me even!

2643
02:59:19,820 --> 02:59:20,380
Oh!

2644
02:59:22,620 --> 02:59:24,160
Where did that guy come from?

2645
02:59:24,320 --> 02:59:25,240
Where did you come from?

2646
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:27,440
Holy cow!

2647
02:59:31,650 --> 02:59:32,250
Okay.

2648
02:59:41,020 --> 02:59:42,780
So there's a guy over here.

2649
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:49,080
Is there another guy?

2650
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:54,360
Huh!

2651
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:56,580
I hear it!

2652
02:59:57,740 --> 02:59:58,180
Okay.

2653
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:23,100

guy I feel like that's the bait thing at the very end I

2654
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:33,560

03:01:52,650 --> 03:01:59,130

2659
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:06,740
Okay, some guy's gonna pop out of there

I'm paranoid as hell At least this room is nice and bright
Lovely Lovely

2661
03:02:33,050 --> 03:02:35,450
Chula usually isn't this cruel.

2662
03:02:36,350 --> 03:02:41,330
It might be like a genuine mistake.

2663
03:02:41,690 --> 03:02:42,170
Okay, that's the thing.

2664
03:02:44,230 --> 03:02:48,860
Like a genuine bug.

2665
03:03:14,350 --> 03:03:17,330
Bait machine, use a fish to produce bait.

2666
03:03:17,490 --> 03:03:18,750
The fish will be lost.

2667
03:03:19,590 --> 03:03:20,430
Can I have my...

2668
03:03:20,430 --> 03:03:20,770
Thank you.

2669
03:03:22,770 --> 03:03:24,470
I nope the heck.

2670
03:03:24,490 --> 03:03:25,270
out of there.

2671
03:03:28,810 --> 03:03:31,450
I absolutely no shame.

2672
03:03:32,390 --> 03:03:34,030
Said no way Jose.

2673
03:03:36,230 --> 03:03:38,890
Alright, now we need to find a normal fish, huh?

2674
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:47,780
But also,

2675
03:03:52,720 --> 03:03:53,960
wasn't I supposed to bring that...

2676
03:03:53,960 --> 03:03:55,400
Wait, what happened to your guy then?

2677
03:03:55,860 --> 03:03:57,820
I just... I just... I don't even check.

2678
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:00,060
Okay.

2679
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:01,780
Ew!

2680
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:04,600
What is this?

2681
03:04:06,220 --> 03:04:07,740
Is this the bait?

2682
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:10,980
Wait a second.

2683
03:04:16,750 --> 03:04:18,210
Oh, wait.

2684
03:04:18,390 --> 03:04:18,850
I feel it.

2685
03:04:18,910 --> 03:04:24,070
I fear I am in the way of this lovely creature.

2686
03:04:26,610 --> 03:04:27,950
Only 3,000!

2687
03:04:28,670 --> 03:04:30,830
Oh, it looks like a... Is this the bait?

2688
03:04:37,350 --> 03:04:38,870
What am I supposed to do?

2689
03:04:38,890 --> 03:04:40,490
do with this.

2690
03:04:41,490 --> 03:04:43,010
I don't want it.

2691
03:04:43,010 --> 03:04:45,490
I don't want it on my ship.

2692
03:04:50,110 --> 03:04:53,170
And I guess he's the one that ink set up, it looks like.

2693
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:56,550
Yeah, he's an inky guy.

2694
03:04:57,970 --> 03:04:59,370
If I look at him.

2695
03:05:01,410 --> 03:05:04,190
I- what am I supposed to do with these?

2696
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:05,630
Maybe I grab them.

2697
03:05:05,750 --> 03:05:06,650
Oh, okay, okay.

2698
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:21,280
Any guys coming around?

2699
03:05:28,090 --> 03:05:28,330
Oh.

2700
03:05:29,850 --> 03:05:31,190
Let's go to...

2701
03:05:31,190 --> 03:05:32,650
Let's go a little forward.

2702
03:05:33,330 --> 03:05:34,030
Like here.

2703
03:05:43,850 --> 03:05:44,490
Oh.

2704
03:05:44,990 --> 03:05:46,310
You're an inky guy.

2705
03:05:46,550 --> 03:05:47,170
Get out of here.

2706
03:05:48,290 --> 03:05:50,170
You're not allowed to eat my bait.

2707
03:05:53,390 --> 03:05:55,050
Oh, stop it!

2708
03:05:56,130 --> 03:05:57,090
Stop it!

2709
03:05:57,230 --> 03:05:58,290
Stop coming to my bait!

2710
03:06:00,190 --> 03:06:01,050
I'm getting baited.

2711
03:06:05,650 --> 03:06:07,030
We'll go out a little bit more.

2712
03:06:07,230 --> 03:06:11,890
Oh, I see, like, sometimes I see, like, fins and stuff.

2713
03:06:14,090 --> 03:06:16,250
I saw one way, way in the distance, too.

2714
03:06:30,580 --> 03:06:32,740
Okay, these are the, these are the heavy hitters.

2715
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:34,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we need more of you guys.

2716
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:36,320
Come back, come back, please!

2717
03:06:36,580 --> 03:06:37,720
You're still hungry!

2718
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,520
We have some inky guys too we can use.

2719
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:55,940
Yes.

2720
03:06:56,800 --> 03:06:57,220
Yes.

2721
03:06:58,820 --> 03:06:59,460
Yes.

2722
03:07:00,880 --> 03:07:01,180
Inky.

2723
03:07:03,220 --> 03:07:04,900
Yeah, inky guys for bait.

2724
03:07:08,750 --> 03:07:11,150
Maybe someone else will show up before it disappears.

2725
03:07:12,310 --> 03:07:12,770
Coming once.

2726
03:07:13,110 --> 03:07:13,730
Going twice.

2727
03:07:15,250 --> 03:07:17,330
Alright, throw!

2728
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:26,360
Oh, oh my god, they're so fast!

2729
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:32,920
I think I...

2730
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:38,670
It's kind of hard because you don't throw it very far.

2731
03:07:39,010 --> 03:07:40,770
Like, even when I hold it down.

2732
03:07:42,210 --> 03:07:44,630
Like, I'm not throwing it super far.

2733
03:07:45,910 --> 03:07:46,350
You know?

2734
03:07:48,730 --> 03:07:49,330
Alright.

2735
03:07:50,290 --> 03:07:50,910
Come here!

2736
03:07:56,670 --> 03:07:59,170
Let me just sell what I got, man.

2737
03:08:03,250 --> 03:08:04,410
Maybe the angle matters.

2738
03:08:04,570 --> 03:08:05,110
Maybe, maybe.

2739
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:11,850
I like how the sky just sometimes decides to change to a
different image.

2740
03:08:15,690 --> 03:08:17,330
Just classic Chilizard.

2741
03:08:19,770 --> 03:08:21,690
Okay, select all and sell.

2742
03:08:25,650 --> 03:08:26,410
We're...

2743
03:08:27,390 --> 03:08:28,910
We're doing so bad.

2744
03:08:31,490 --> 03:08:34,270
Guys, this is so bad.

2745
03:08:35,610 --> 03:08:37,550
The grind is like crazy now.

2746
03:08:38,290 --> 03:08:38,990
That's what sucks.

2747
03:08:39,870 --> 03:08:42,130
The grind is kind of insane now.

2748
03:08:46,750 --> 03:08:48,950
Hello, hello, I'm back.

2749
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:53,720
Oh, okay.

2750
03:08:55,780 --> 03:08:58,360
That's the bait maker for catching fish.

2751
03:08:58,380 --> 03:09:00,160
Wait, are you the one the boss mentioned?

2752
03:09:00,420 --> 03:09:00,920
Perfect timing.

2753
03:09:01,060 --> 03:09:02,160
I'm glad you showed up.

2754
03:09:02,480 --> 03:09:03,020
The boss?

2755
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:05,020
Could you help us with deliveries?

2756
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:12,260
I want you to load 10 fish from inside this dome onto each
of the three boats.

2757
03:09:12,880 --> 03:09:13,860
You're a lifesaver.

2758
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:20,460
Okay.

2759
03:09:24,890 --> 03:09:25,750
Wait, so what is it?

2760
03:09:26,030 --> 03:09:28,910
Load 10 fish from the dome onto each of the three boats.

2761
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,540
Wait, are these...

2762
03:09:37,540 --> 03:09:38,860
These are the blobfish!

2763
03:09:41,360 --> 03:09:41,860
Okay.

2764
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:45,840
Wait, so I need 10 on each boat?

2765
03:09:47,220 --> 03:09:48,500
This really is Tokyo Dome.

2766
03:09:49,180 --> 03:09:49,740
It's so funny.

2767
03:09:50,340 --> 03:09:51,620
They're just little blobfish.

2768
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:54,240
Can I sell these guys at all?

2769
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:56,820
They don't have a price, so probably...

2770
03:09:56,820 --> 03:09:57,540
Oh, sorry.

2771
03:10:04,590 --> 03:10:05,910
I'm not keeping count.

2772
03:10:06,070 --> 03:10:07,490
I'm just murdering.

2773
03:10:08,910 --> 03:10:11,270
I'm just going on a spree.

2774
03:10:12,450 --> 03:10:13,390
Killing spree.

2775
03:10:15,590 --> 03:10:17,310
I see a shell over there.

2776
03:10:20,150 --> 03:10:21,790
They're called goblin fish.

2777
03:10:22,670 --> 03:10:22,790
Ah.

2778
03:10:24,070 --> 03:10:24,950
Goblin fish.

2779
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:33,170
The ones that aren't supposed to look like this, but because
they're used to living under such severe pressure when you

2780
03:10:33,170 --> 03:10:34,890
take them out of it.

2781
03:10:35,110 --> 03:10:37,910
Or it's either the pressure or just the water itself.

2782
03:10:38,090 --> 03:10:38,590
I can't remember.

2783
03:10:41,290 --> 03:10:42,510
I wish I could get two at once.

2784
03:10:44,310 --> 03:10:44,970
Wish came true.

2785
03:10:46,290 --> 03:10:46,730
Yeah,

2786
03:10:51,390 --> 03:10:51,750
baby.

2787
03:10:55,450 --> 03:10:56,010
Oh, they're only...

2788
03:10:56,010 --> 03:10:57,850
Oh, they are only one yen, it does say.

2789
03:10:58,090 --> 03:10:58,670
Yeah, okay.

2790
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:07,360
I know, the music's so chill in this area.

2791
03:11:08,360 --> 03:11:09,240
So chillas.

2792
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:13,700
You think I have enough?

2793
03:11:13,860 --> 03:11:14,220
No.

2794
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:14,920
No.

2795
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:21,100
Oh, it is cheap bait, you're right!

2796
03:11:22,960 --> 03:11:24,580
And easy to catch too!

2797
03:11:29,510 --> 03:11:31,510
Let's go put some of these guys away.

2798
03:11:34,230 --> 03:11:35,890
My boat's gonna be filled with them.

2799
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:42,590
Who's buying this many of them?

2800
03:11:42,910 --> 03:11:43,870
See, there's a fin!

2801
03:11:46,230 --> 03:11:47,910
Oh, I think I got it, whatever it was.

2802
03:11:49,350 --> 03:11:50,890
Oh, it's one of these guys!

2803
03:11:51,130 --> 03:11:51,590
Okay, cool.

2804
03:11:52,570 --> 03:11:53,570
We do, we do one.

2805
03:11:53,810 --> 03:11:56,250
Okay, so one, one, two.

2806
03:11:59,010 --> 03:12:00,790
One, two, three.

2807
03:12:04,810 --> 03:12:11,310
Oh, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2808
03:12:12,110 --> 03:12:12,110
Okay.

2809
03:12:14,550 --> 03:12:17,190
There he goes, there he goes.

2810
03:12:20,170 --> 03:12:21,010
Hello?

2811
03:12:44,670 --> 03:12:46,670
I wonder if I could like go with them.

2812
03:12:47,430 --> 03:12:48,170
Just sail.

2813
03:13:02,190 --> 03:13:03,530
How many was that?

2814
03:13:03,890 --> 03:13:03,890
Four?

2815
03:13:04,250 --> 03:13:04,510
I think.

2816
03:13:06,510 --> 03:13:08,310
The silence between five and eight.

2817
03:13:08,450 --> 03:13:09,230
I know what I'm doing.

2818
03:13:10,730 --> 03:13:11,610
I know what I'm doing.

2819
03:13:19,380 --> 03:13:20,100
I'm a professional.

2820
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:26,020
I feel like I feel like I should keep some of these guys
though.

2821
03:13:26,260 --> 03:13:27,820
Like I should just catch a blind and keep some.

2822
03:13:28,600 --> 03:13:30,800
Unless they don't close the gate.

2823
03:13:31,340 --> 03:13:32,800
That would be pretty nice too.

2824
03:13:36,220 --> 03:13:36,780
One,

2825
03:13:39,960 --> 03:13:41,540
two, three, four, five.

2826
03:13:45,560 --> 03:13:46,120
Fish.

2827
03:13:48,840 --> 03:13:49,960
Six fish.

2828
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:51,320
One half fuel.

2829
03:13:52,140 --> 03:13:53,360
Okay, okay.

2830
03:13:57,410 --> 03:13:59,450
What are they gonna give me for this, huh?

2831
03:14:00,750 --> 03:14:00,870
Oh.

2832
03:14:04,010 --> 03:14:04,970
I can't.

2833
03:14:05,350 --> 03:14:06,010
I can't jump.

2834
03:14:06,230 --> 03:14:06,590
I'm stuck.

2835
03:14:06,770 --> 03:14:07,170
I'm stuck!

2836
03:14:10,610 --> 03:14:12,010
One, two.

2837
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:24,220
You son of a bitch.

2838
03:14:26,300 --> 03:14:26,760
Why?

2839
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:27,900
Why did he fall?

2840
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:30,220
No!

2841
03:14:30,300 --> 03:14:30,700
No!

2842
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:32,560
I got him!

2843
03:14:32,820 --> 03:14:33,720
Never mind, he didn't fall!

2844
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:35,600
He's still here!

2845
03:14:35,800 --> 03:14:36,080
He's still here.

2846
03:14:36,400 --> 03:14:36,740
He's still here.

2847
03:14:37,160 --> 03:14:37,820
He's still here.

2848
03:14:38,140 --> 03:14:38,740
He's still here.

2849
03:14:40,360 --> 03:14:40,800
Okay.

2850
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:43,160
Okay!

2851
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:43,900
Okay!

2852
03:14:44,140 --> 03:14:44,580
Nice!

2853
03:14:45,140 --> 03:14:47,660
Oh, I was about to be so sad!

2854
03:14:51,100 --> 03:14:52,220
You're a lifesaver!

2855
03:14:52,540 --> 03:14:54,900
So you really are the person Boss talked so highly about.

2856
03:14:57,100 --> 03:14:57,900
Oh, we get the bell!

2857
03:14:57,920 --> 03:14:58,880
Go for it!

2858
03:14:59,420 --> 03:14:59,600
Oops.

2859
03:15:04,970 --> 03:15:06,870
Oh, we got three bells this time.

2860
03:15:07,430 --> 03:15:07,510
Crazy.

2861
03:15:10,330 --> 03:15:14,730
And we also can't forget that this massive guy is in this
area as well.

2862
03:15:15,190 --> 03:15:16,790
And there's the lighthouse over there.

2863
03:15:17,110 --> 03:15:18,590
Oh, you can watch them like sail off.

2864
03:15:18,770 --> 03:15:19,370
That's kind of cute.

2865
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:28,800
Nice save.

2866
03:15:28,940 --> 03:15:29,460
Thank you.

2867
03:15:30,540 --> 03:15:31,700
Brought back three bells.

2868
03:15:32,660 --> 03:15:33,460
Go attach it.

2869
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:35,000
This guy is so fast.

2870
03:15:35,240 --> 03:15:36,220
Mark their new location.

2871
03:15:36,340 --> 03:15:36,900
Do your best.

2872
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:39,380
Wait, what?

2873
03:15:40,920 --> 03:15:42,220
That's, it's not here?

2874
03:15:43,180 --> 03:15:44,140
How long is this game?

2875
03:15:46,460 --> 03:15:47,020
Wait, what?

2876
03:15:48,860 --> 03:15:50,000
How long is this game?

2877
03:15:56,710 --> 03:15:58,710
Weeks are fun, weeks are fun.

2878
03:15:59,270 --> 03:16:00,770
You heard six hours?

2879
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:05,800
Holy cow.

2880
03:16:09,740 --> 03:16:11,820
Fumoku took five hours.

2881
03:16:13,840 --> 03:16:15,560
I've never done a part two.

2882
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:17,940
on of Chilla's art game before.

2883
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:21,840
I've never...

2884
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:23,780
I had stuff to do tonight, though.

2885
03:16:24,040 --> 03:16:24,680
That's my issue.

2886
03:16:26,140 --> 03:16:28,580
I thought it was going to be like a three-hour game like
they usually were.

2887
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:37,300
I guess it also depends on how you like upgrade your stuff,
you know?

2888
03:16:38,020 --> 03:16:39,200
And things like that.

2889
03:16:41,160 --> 03:16:43,700
Oh, let me get fuel real quick, actually.

2890
03:16:47,440 --> 03:16:49,340
Stop, stop.

2891
03:16:54,330 --> 03:16:56,070
That was bamboozled.

2892
03:16:56,710 --> 03:17:05,270
That's what I get for playing a game that just comes out
immediately and not like, you know, waiting to see how long

2893
03:17:05,270 --> 03:17:06,610
other people take to play it.

2894
03:17:07,930 --> 03:17:11,470
You know, that's my fault for just being...

2895
03:17:11,470 --> 03:17:13,930
Oh, I think it's outside the...

2896
03:17:13,930 --> 03:17:16,230
It is outside the line, though.

2897
03:17:17,110 --> 03:17:18,210
Very interesting.

2898
03:17:20,830 --> 03:17:21,510
Hello!

2899
03:17:21,510 --> 03:17:22,190
Hello!

2900
03:17:23,390 --> 03:17:24,070
Hello!

2901
03:17:24,070 --> 03:17:25,170
Come back!

2902
03:17:25,570 --> 03:17:26,510
So are you.

2903
03:17:27,190 --> 03:17:27,670
Hi!

2904
03:17:27,950 --> 03:17:28,410
Where are you?

2905
03:17:28,510 --> 03:17:28,850
Whoa!

2906
03:17:31,310 --> 03:17:31,990
Hello?

2907
03:17:32,810 --> 03:17:33,790
Where's your eyeball at?

2908
03:17:34,070 --> 03:17:34,650
Suspicious?

2909
03:17:34,730 --> 03:17:35,410
Oh, suspicious.

2910
03:17:35,610 --> 03:17:36,350
That's where we've been.

2911
03:17:38,370 --> 03:17:39,050
Hello!

2912
03:17:39,290 --> 03:17:40,070
Where's your eyeball?

2913
03:17:43,850 --> 03:17:44,750
That one right there?

2914
03:18:00,600 --> 03:18:01,500
This way.

2915
03:18:06,730 --> 03:18:08,570
Where the heck are you?

2916
03:18:09,550 --> 03:18:10,290
Am I blind?

2917
03:18:12,250 --> 03:18:13,470
Clearly I am.

2918
03:18:14,830 --> 03:18:14,910
What?

2919
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:16,730
This way.

2920
03:18:30,750 --> 03:18:31,630
I see it.

2921
03:18:32,070 --> 03:18:33,190
Wait, I thought I saw it.

2922
03:18:33,330 --> 03:18:33,470
There.

2923
03:18:34,170 --> 03:18:35,130
No, please!

2924
03:18:36,950 --> 03:18:37,990
No, I did.

2925
03:18:51,370 --> 03:18:52,270
There we go.

2926
03:18:54,970 --> 03:18:55,550
Yay!

2927
03:18:56,790 --> 03:18:57,250
Alright.

2928
03:18:58,590 --> 03:18:59,470
quite well.

2929
03:19:02,190 --> 03:19:04,290
All the way to the new area.

2930
03:19:05,010 --> 03:19:07,490
Oh, we gotta buy the new speed.

2931
03:19:10,710 --> 03:19:14,790
We gotta buy the new speed, but we're gonna lose out on the
fuel capacity.

2932
03:19:15,790 --> 03:19:17,850
We're like, yeah, so we'll have less fuel.

2933
03:19:27,330 --> 03:19:28,450
This is tricky.

2934
03:19:34,640 --> 03:19:36,680
Yeah, it's only 150k.

2935
03:19:36,840 --> 03:19:38,480
Yeah, no big deal.

2936
03:19:41,140 --> 03:19:42,720
Wait, are these the blobfish?

2937
03:19:44,660 --> 03:19:46,300
What are you guys doing out?

2938
03:19:46,560 --> 03:19:47,520
Wait, did they escape?

2939
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:52,680
Did they escape?

2940
03:19:53,040 --> 03:19:53,480
Okay, hold on.

2941
03:19:53,640 --> 03:19:54,160
Let's try this.

2942
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:03,390
Oh, dang it.

2943
03:20:09,620 --> 03:20:10,700
That was a waste.

2944
03:20:12,140 --> 03:20:12,980
Wasn't it?

2945
03:20:14,020 --> 03:20:15,280
They're gathering!

2946
03:20:16,900 --> 03:20:18,240
Oh, they're worth 2,000!

2947
03:20:18,640 --> 03:20:19,640
Okay, okay.

2948
03:20:21,360 --> 03:20:23,100
Okay, okay, okay.

2949
03:20:24,660 --> 03:20:26,920
The blobs escaped containment.

2950
03:20:35,620 --> 03:20:37,100
It's kind of horrible.

2951
03:20:39,160 --> 03:20:40,720
Stop eating it.

2952
03:20:42,040 --> 03:20:43,640
Oh, I see one, I see one.

2953
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:46,420
No, no, no, no, no.

2954
03:20:48,100 --> 03:20:49,620
Oh my god, these are the stinking.

2955
03:20:51,380 --> 03:20:53,320
I can't see anything now.

2956
03:20:58,060 --> 03:20:59,300
sacrifice

2957
03:21:12,660 --> 03:21:24,120
where are you where are you big guy come on come on no way

2958
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:41,700
I'm gonna move a little bit away where are you and I'm so
Soul gray.

2959
03:21:50,380 --> 03:21:50,860
Yes.

2960
03:21:55,080 --> 03:21:55,560
Ha!

2961
03:22:06,720 --> 03:22:08,100
I think that's him down there.

2962
03:22:13,130 --> 03:22:14,550
I think that's actually him down there.

2963
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:22,100
Unless I be crazy.

2964
03:22:23,420 --> 03:22:24,380
It looks like him, no?

2965
03:22:24,920 --> 03:22:26,160
Does that not look like the fish?

2966
03:22:32,890 --> 03:22:33,750
You know what, no.

2967
03:22:34,430 --> 03:22:36,970
Even though you're worth more, you piss me off.

2968
03:22:39,030 --> 03:22:40,270
You piss me off.

2969
03:22:44,030 --> 03:22:44,970
Yes, it is him.

2970
03:22:45,730 --> 03:22:46,190
I knew it!

2971
03:22:46,250 --> 03:22:47,110
I knew it was him!

2972
03:22:47,650 --> 03:22:48,610
Oh, I knew it.

2973
03:22:48,850 --> 03:22:50,270
Oh, I knew it was him.

2974
03:22:50,370 --> 03:22:51,030
Oh, my gosh.

2975
03:22:51,110 --> 03:22:51,870
That's crazy.

2976
03:22:56,290 --> 03:22:56,770
Whoa!

2977
03:22:57,150 --> 03:22:58,470
I could see him.

2978
03:23:01,110 --> 03:23:02,070
My eyes!

2979
03:23:02,890 --> 03:23:05,450
Fishing eyes are trained for this.

2980
03:23:18,660 --> 03:23:20,680
I'm not letting you.

2981
03:23:21,260 --> 03:23:21,760
Wait.

2982
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:27,260
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2983
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:29,240
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2984
03:23:30,820 --> 03:23:32,480
Oh, I have this guy too.

2985
03:23:33,980 --> 03:23:35,800
Alright, let's just drive back.

2986
03:23:37,240 --> 03:23:40,040
What do you see with your mint eyes?

2987
03:23:42,020 --> 03:23:44,260
I am the chosen one!

2988
03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:51,280
Yes!

2989
03:23:53,280 --> 03:23:55,280
Alright, we're getting some good cash here.

2990
03:23:57,720 --> 03:23:59,320
Excuse me, I do need a drive though.

2991
03:24:01,620 --> 03:24:02,540
Everybody in?

2992
03:24:05,460 --> 03:24:07,280
This guy scared me.

2993
03:24:14,600 --> 03:24:16,000
We'll figure it out.

2994
03:24:16,300 --> 03:24:17,820
Ew, I just noticed his nose.

2995
03:24:18,900 --> 03:24:20,260
It's like a people nose.

2996
03:24:26,800 --> 03:24:28,340
Yeah, we're just going to carry these.

2997
03:24:28,540 --> 03:24:30,440
I actually am holding on to five guys.

2998
03:24:32,780 --> 03:24:33,700
Five guys.

2999
03:24:34,880 --> 03:24:35,800
Five guys.

3000
03:24:36,140 --> 03:24:37,840
Oh, I do need to put you on my boat, don't I?

3001
03:24:47,570 --> 03:24:48,490
Very nice.

3002
03:24:49,550 --> 03:24:50,910
I'm getting hungry even.

3003
03:24:56,890 --> 03:24:58,970
Okay, we just need 50,000 more.

3004
03:24:59,310 --> 03:25:00,110
Maybe it is okay.

3005
03:25:01,890 --> 03:25:05,350
Oh, I don't think I'm ever gonna get my boost up or
anything.

3006
03:25:07,170 --> 03:25:08,530
Bait range.

3007
03:25:08,990 --> 03:25:09,350
Interesting.

3008
03:25:11,890 --> 03:25:15,270
I want to increase my fuel capacity, but I don't know.

3009
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:17,190
Just got back from Dunkin' Donuts!

3010
03:25:19,030 --> 03:25:20,390
I'm hungry.

3011
03:25:22,250 --> 03:25:23,910
I'm hungry, ghost.

3012
03:25:24,690 --> 03:25:28,710
I cannot possess or eat your sacrifices.

3013
03:25:30,310 --> 03:25:31,400
When I am...

3014
03:25:33,650 --> 03:25:35,230
When I am streaming!

3015
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:41,520
Is there anything out here?

3016
03:25:47,460 --> 03:25:48,360
Hungry ghost.

3017
03:25:49,620 --> 03:25:50,760
Ghost is hungry.

3018
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:56,520
Still have two hours left of work.

3019
03:25:57,060 --> 03:25:58,120
You got this!

3020
03:25:58,240 --> 03:26:00,020
I think I have two hours left of gaming.

3021
03:26:00,740 --> 03:26:03,300
Oh no, I'm not gonna be able to make it to this store
tonight.

3022
03:26:05,620 --> 03:26:06,020
Ah!

3023
03:26:17,480 --> 03:26:18,840
Make a part two?

3024
03:26:20,240 --> 03:26:21,220
I might have to.

3025
03:26:21,440 --> 03:26:23,560
I might just do this game again in the middle of the day.

3026
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:25,180
This seems like such a waste.

3027
03:26:25,320 --> 03:26:26,720
It's not even that long of a game.

3028
03:26:27,740 --> 03:26:28,240
I don't know.

3029
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:33,440
Are you guys fine with a part two?

3030
03:26:39,140 --> 03:26:40,580
First Chillas part two.

3031
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:41,640
That's crazy.

3032
03:26:42,560 --> 03:26:43,820
That's actually crazy.

3033
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:45,620
You can just yapp up through.

3034
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:46,420
That's true, that's true.

3035
03:26:48,180 --> 03:26:48,520
Okay.

3036
03:26:49,760 --> 03:26:50,820
Let me save.

3037
03:26:51,340 --> 03:26:52,520
I'm so sorry, you guys.

3038
03:26:52,760 --> 03:26:53,400
I honestly...

3039
03:26:53,400 --> 03:26:54,340
I don't know what I was thinking.

3040
03:26:54,600 --> 03:26:56,640
I was like, oh, it's going to be done in like three hours.

3041
03:26:57,060 --> 03:26:57,760
Easy peasy.

3042
03:27:00,200 --> 03:27:01,720
I was like, yeah, whatever.

3043
03:27:02,040 --> 03:27:02,820
So easy.

3044
03:27:05,260 --> 03:27:06,240
So I apologize.

3045
03:27:06,600 --> 03:27:07,640
I will do a part two.

3046
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:10,880
I might even do it tonight if I feel like it.

3047
03:27:11,940 --> 03:27:12,300
Uh...

3048
03:27:12,860 --> 03:27:13,300
Shit.

3049
03:27:14,760 --> 03:27:16,140
Sorry, I'm just so busy.

3050
03:27:16,540 --> 03:27:18,780
I'm like, thinking of all that I gotta do.

3051
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:19,520
I don't think.

3052
03:27:19,580 --> 03:27:20,820
Actually, maybe I can't do it tonight.

3053
03:27:24,720 --> 03:27:29,560
We'll do it tomorrow, same time as today, before
contradiction.

3054
03:27:31,320 --> 03:27:32,420
Contradiction is tomorrow, right?

3055
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:34,040
Yes.

3056
03:27:34,620 --> 03:27:35,860
So let me put that on my calendar.

3057
03:27:41,060 --> 03:27:41,900
Umigari 2.

3058
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:43,280
Okay.

3059
03:27:44,260 --> 03:27:44,780
Okay.

3060
03:27:45,340 --> 03:27:46,340
I'll do this tomorrow.

3061
03:27:47,240 --> 03:27:47,500
Again.

3062
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:50,840
Sure thing, boss.

3063
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:52,280
Sorry, guys.

3064
03:27:54,200 --> 03:27:55,220
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3065
03:27:56,220 --> 03:27:56,860
Thank you for fishing.

3066
03:27:56,940 --> 03:27:58,240
Good luck with what you have to do tonight.

3067
03:27:58,380 --> 03:28:00,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3068
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:00,680
Sorry.

3069
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:02,560
I'm so sorry.

3070
03:28:03,980 --> 03:28:05,140
I'm so sorry.

3071
03:28:13,950 --> 03:28:15,470
Thank you, Trey Princess.

3072
03:28:16,450 --> 03:28:17,130
Why are you sorry?

3073
03:28:18,250 --> 03:28:26,470
a very long game, but I'm making a part two, so I feel silly
about it, but, um, it's not very long, but I'm making a part

3074
03:28:26,470 --> 03:28:28,470
two, so I feel goofy about it.

3075
03:28:28,730 --> 03:28:33,810
But anyway, I'm going to go eat, and I'm going to go do what
I need to do.

3076
03:28:34,530 --> 03:28:36,710
And I will see you guys when I see you next.

3077
03:28:37,070 --> 03:28:42,010
We'll yapp, we'll yapp tomorrow, and I'll do this in
contradiction, and I'm taking tomorrow off.

3078
03:28:43,270 --> 03:28:44,490
Possess me for more doughnuts.

3079
03:28:44,750 --> 03:28:45,190
Yippee!

3080
03:28:45,370 --> 03:28:46,370
Thank you!

3081
03:28:48,750 --> 03:28:49,490
Come on!

3082
03:28:49,550 --> 03:28:50,870
Thanks for fishing with me.

3083
03:28:51,090 --> 03:28:52,330
Thank you, thank you.

3084
03:28:52,870 --> 03:28:54,290
Ochamito, ochamito, ochamito!

3085
03:28:54,930 --> 03:28:55,470
Bye-bye!

3086
03:28:55,710 --> 03:28:57,970
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

3087
03:28:58,310 --> 03:28:59,110
Thank you, thank you!

3088
03:28:59,190 --> 03:29:00,010
Bye-bye, bye-bye.
