00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,440
Hello!

2
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,220
There is no music.

3
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,160
So quiet.

4
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Why is it so quiet?

5
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Why is there no music?

6
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,640
Why is there no music?

7
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,360
Tori, thanks for the raid.

8
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,100
Thank you.

9
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,900
Hello, my name is Meido Minto.

10
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,000
Did you get water?

11
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,900
I did get water.

12
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,720
I got water.

13
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,640
Which I really needed because...

14
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,940
I think I had too much caffeine today.

15
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,240
Whoopsie.

16
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,860
Oh my gosh, wait.

17
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,540
That's me.

18
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,180
I did this.

19
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,180
This is like literally what I did last time.

20
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,580
Ducky, thanks for the gift card.

21
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
Oh, this is me.

22
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,740
Wait.

23
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,940
Yeah, I definitely didn't do that.

24
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh, spoilers.

25
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,360
Wait a second.

26
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,160
No look, you know.

27
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,540
No look, no look, no look.

28
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,080
No, stop.

29
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,200
Oh, I did the dog.

30
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,940
I did the dog.

31
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
That's me.

32
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,600
Wait, no, I didn't do that part yet.

33
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,480
There is lizards.

34
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,200
Lizard men.

35
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,540
Oh boy, I'm getting all sort of spoiled today.

36
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,140
Oh, I don't... That was random.

37
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,300
Anyway, OK.

38
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Welcome back to part 2 of...

39
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,660
May Cry!

40
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,060
Here, hold on.

41
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,900
Say the name.

42
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,700
I didn't time that at all.

43
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,060
Devil May Cry.

44
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,680
The enemy juggling was inspired by a glitch found in Onimusha Warlords.

45
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,120
Really?

46
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,940
Oh no, we are back to the fun facts.

47
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,940
This is the beginning.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
The Devil May Cry bar place.

49
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,880
Mother and a brother.

50
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,060
Sparda.

51
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,820
Let's rock baby.

52
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh, we are going outside?

53
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,260
Hold on, everything is happening.

54
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
Please, can we just go back to the menu?

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,380
Thank you.

56
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm just going to click this.

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,700
We'll stay on this screen.

58
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,540
Because I can't speak when everything is going on.

59
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,520
Oh my gosh, jackpot.

60
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,040
Lizard men, the MC of your next book.

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,940
No, the next book is...

62
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,380
I can check.

63
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,320
But yeah, this is my first time playing Devil May Cry.

64
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,780
It's my first time playing the series.

65
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,580
I played it last week.

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,180
So we ended after mission 7.

67
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,860
No, mission...

68
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,800
We did more than mission 7.

69
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,160
Why is it saying...

70
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,260
Oh wait, return to the bedroom.

71
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,060
Oh no, we did mission 7.

72
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Sorry.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
I was like, wait a second, the bedroom.

74
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,060
I went there before.

75
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,500
So we did that.

76
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,100
Raven, thank you.

77
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,980
Oh my gosh.

78
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,900
I can't tell if this is...

79
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,570
I can't tell if this is sarcasm or not.

80
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,970
I can't tell if this is a joke or not.

81
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:06,130
I got so many comments from people being like, did you know that this was supposed to be Resident Evil 4?

82
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,710
Oh god.

83
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,610
Wait, I can't tell if this is superchats.

84
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,270
I can't tell if you guys are being serious or not.

85
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,820
Wait, I can't tell.

86
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe I should hold on.

87
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,260
Let me make that the pin message.

88
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,320
Did you know...

89
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,420
That this was supposed to be Resident Evil 4?

90
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,520
Now you know.

91
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,540
Oh wait, I said now you know.

92
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,160
You know what, it's fine.

93
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Now you know.

94
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,540
Now you know.

95
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,400
Oopsie.

96
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,700
Yes, I know.

97
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,820
But thank you for the reminder.

98
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,240
Thank you for the donos, I appreciate it.

99
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,740
Thanks for the tag, Gifter!

100
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,220
Now you know.

101
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
DMC stands for Damn MitoQ Stop.

102
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,100
Enjoy RE4.

103
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,940
Thank you.

104
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm hoping I remember how to play the game.

105
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,500
I'm hoping I remember how to play the game.

106
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,200
Hopefully I remember how to play the game.

107
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,840
If I don't, if it takes me a minute to get back into it, please forgive me.

108
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,040
Did you know that this game features Dante from the Devil May Cry series?

109
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh my gosh.

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,540
Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series?

111
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,460
Now you know.

112
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,740
We're surely going to be Jumpstart Adventures 3rd grade.

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,500
Do you plan to play 2 after this?

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,520
We'll see.

115
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,120
Maybe.

116
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,400
Maybe.

117
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,640
Maybe.

118
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,140
Thank you!

119
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,480
I better stay that way, Zachary.

120
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,820
I'm just kidding.

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,980
If it's your partner, you have to...

122
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
You have to...

123
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,580
You have to kami-oshi them, right?

124
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,240
I guess.

125
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know.

126
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,820
ViviCoin, thanks for the gift!

127
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,560
Skip in!

128
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,740
Real gamers don't skip too.

129
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,780
I just feel like I need to experience it.

130
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,820
You know?

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,980
If you press A right as the ball clicks shut, you increase capture percent.

132
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:34,940
Wait, what?

133
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,960
Oh, oh, this is Pokemon.

134
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,020
Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series came from SMT3.

135
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,920
I knew it was like some sticker on some game.

136
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,480
I could not remember what game it was though.

137
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,500
Okay.

138
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,240
Guys...

139
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,020
I don't remember the controls at all.

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,020
I will have to look them up again.

141
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,540
Oh, there's the controls in the menu, I believe.

142
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,320
We're on mission 7.

143
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,820
We just cleared mission 7.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,760
We're on mission 8.

145
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,660
I have to remember how to pull my devil trigger.

146
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,440
I don't remember.

147
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,700
Is it under option?

148
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,240
No...

149
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,940
Here.

150
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,920
Oh...

151
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,840
Wait, what's the mission anyway?

152
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,640
Check your current mission.

153
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,160
What?

154
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,900
Oh, nothing.

155
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,040
Okay.

156
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,520
This game was really released as Doki Doki Panic.

157
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,040
Okay.

158
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,200
Cool, we have no mission.

159
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,280
Manual, probably.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,340
Oh wait, let's go back to here.

161
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm doing that thing where I press B instead of A because I'm used to Japanese controller setup.

162
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,940
Devil May Cry, but what about ghosts?

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,960
Ghosts never cry.

164
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,220
What are you talking about?

165
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,100
Actually, that's not true.

166
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,340
Ghosts cry all the time.

167
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,220
There's like ghosts that go like...

168
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,800
And there's ghosts that go...

169
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,500
You know?

170
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,400
This game will never be good.

171
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,060
It's Resident Evil.

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,040
It has no songs in the soundtrack.

173
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,140
It's been labeled by fans as clowns farting in the basement.

174
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,260
I love the Resident Evil basement song.

175
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,140
What are you talking about?

176
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,580
Oh here we go, here we go.

177
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,720
Devil Trigger!

178
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,080
Okay.

179
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,620
Aim...

180
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,240
Devil Trigger.

181
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,540
Show map?

182
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,640
What?

183
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,700
Wait, shoot?

184
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,680
Slash examine is B or X.

185
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,500
Action.

186
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, sword is Y.

187
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,060
Move.

188
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,060
Alistair select.

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Does that mean like looking around?

190
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,480
What's type B?

191
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,340
You know what?

192
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,140
No, don't even look at type B.

193
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,260
I'm comfortable with where I am.

194
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,200
So Y, B, Y, B, Y, B, Y, B.

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,980
Y, B, Y, B, Y, B, Y, B.

196
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,280
Action.

197
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,220
Is that like jump?

198
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,000
Or an open door?

199
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,500
You haven't put enough ice monkeys.

200
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,260
Y, B, 2B or Y, B.

201
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060
That is the question.

202
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,190
Okay.

203
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,550
Oh, I'm taunting?

204
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,170
Okay, this is taunt.

205
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,770
This is aim.

206
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,330
Devil Trigger which I just wasted, but don't worry about it.

207
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,090
It's fine.

208
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,110
Jump.

209
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:45,890
Sword.

210
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,570
We'll get it back.

211
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,810
It'll return.

212
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,010
Yeah, it recharges.

213
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,250
Y, B.

214
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,130
What if like we're right into a boss?

215
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,770
Oh, that's right!

216
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,890
I still haven't gotten that blue one down there.

217
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,610
The BORB.

218
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,390
I haven't been able to get that BORB.

219
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,090
The BLORB?

220
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,390
Press again to cancel Devil Trigger.

221
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,910
Oh, really?

222
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,130
Remember how to charge.

223
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,510
They got PP music and Devil May Cry.

224
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,010
I'm listening.

225
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,570
PP music and Devil May Cry?

226
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,410
No, wait.

227
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,570
I don't think so.

228
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,350
Do they?

229
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,060
Try wall jumping.

230
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,760
I tried.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
Don't you think I'm just dumb?

232
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,760
Um...

233
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,400
Mission 8.

234
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,280
The legendary knight returns.

235
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,740
Activate the mechanism and escape from the rooftop.

236
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,120
I don't like the sound of that.

237
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,360
Whenever they say like escape from the blank blank it makes me sound...

238
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,340
It makes it seem like there's gonna be some time limit involved.

239
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,900
What's my power up situation looking like?

240
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,580
Way to have a lot actually.

241
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,500
Mr. Matt, thanks for the 5 gifted.

242
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,240
Thank you.

243
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,780
We can get more BLORBS.

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,180
Fragment of Lot.

245
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,720
We can get another BLORB.

246
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,050
What was Alice's?

247
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,730
Oh, that's right.

248
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,070
Stinger.

249
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,770
How do I do the stinger again?

250
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,010
Plunge the sword from an even further distance.

251
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,490
It was like boop.

252
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,510
Why?

253
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,930
Why space why why?

254
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,490
I think.

255
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,830
Why space why why?

256
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,450
I think.

257
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,710
Air hike?

258
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,450
Wasn't I saving up for something?

259
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,210
Maybe that's why.

260
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:45,830
Karuto!

261
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,830
Welcome to the membership.

262
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,270
Thank you.

263
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:55,130
Hideki Kamiya, the man responsible for Devil May Cry, would leave Capcom and go on to be one of the founders of Platinum Games.

264
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,710
One of the games Platinum was responsible for?

265
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,950
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

266
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,550
Aim forward and Y.

267
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,830
Lock on Y.

268
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,130
Saying thank you for all the fun streams.

269
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,830
Thank you!

270
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,830
Hold RB.

271
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,330
Press forward Y.

272
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,930
I think I was thinking of another combo.

273
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,110
I got this.

274
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,330
I'm gonna not buy anything right now then.

275
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,390
Back.

276
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,110
Exit.

277
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,830
Let's just, if I die, whatever.

278
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,190
Oh wait.

279
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,070
No, but my Yorbs.

280
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,050
I don't have any Yorbs.

281
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,830
I think we're fine.

282
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:34,370
Oh,

283
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:46,240
we're in a safe room.

284
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,900
How do I get up there?

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,220
Let's see.

286
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,780
I think I'm a genius, actually.

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,620
Oh, I had to do this anyway.

288
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,700
I'm not anything special.

289
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,240
Games not making me feel good about myself.

290
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Wait, what's over here then?

291
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,500
Oh, got it, got it, got it.

292
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,730
Nice.

293
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:14,890
I'm a genius.

294
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,270
Yeah, Leon couldn't do that.

295
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,410
That guy sucked.

296
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,650
Why does this seem so ominous?

297
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:22,870
Hello?

298
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,930
Hello?

299
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,310
Did I just see this in the beginning cutscene?

300
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,270
Oh gosh, this looks so ominous, you guys.

301
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,450
What the hell?

302
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,130
There's nothing here.

303
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,910
Here?

304
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,090
Oh no.

305
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,790
I just started the game.

306
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,600
Again?

308
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,900
I've dealt with you like 15 times already.

309
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,820
You wanted to get nasty with me?

310
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,080
Game,

311
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,460
please.

312
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,540
I'm just not looking good.

313
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,160
Okay, fine.

314
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,100
This is taunt.

315
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,660
This is...

316
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,620
Oh my goodness.

317
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,300
Okay, okay.

318
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,620
Guys, I'll figure it out.

319
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,100
Don't worry.

320
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,500
Oh my gosh.

321
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,220
No, he figured out my stinger technique.

322
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,020
Don't do that.

323
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,780
Don't figure out my stinger technique, please.

324
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,060
Oh my gosh.

325
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,340
I hate you.

326
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,080
I didn't mean it.

327
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,920
Oh my gosh, stop.

328
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,680
My stinger is useless, you guys.

329
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,560
I gotta jump.

330
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,340
Get up on the Hydra's back.

331
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,580
Get up on the Hydra's back.

332
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,010
Why are you shooting that way, dummy?

333
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,820
He's like doing no damage at all, actually.

334
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,500
Because he's like blocking his face, you little baby.

335
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,580
What are you shy?

336
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,340
You're so shy.

337
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
You're so shy.

338
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,420
I'm dead.

339
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,360
Leave me alone.

340
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,380
Okay, so if I hit him in the face, he opens up.

341
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,000
I hit him in the face and he opened up.

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,820
He's just like peekaboo.

343
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Okay.

344
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,740
You are dead.

345
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,620
Yeah, that's okay.

346
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,880
Alright.

347
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,380
Just like real life.

348
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,920
Me being dead.

349
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,370
There's nothing new for me, honestly.

350
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,510
Nothing new for me.

351
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,990
Mission start.

352
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,510
I don't think...

353
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,040
I noticed though like sometimes...

354
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,540
Like sometimes he would jump and like the glass would like...

355
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,400
I don't know.

356
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,280
There would be like glass that would break.

357
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,760
What was going on there?

358
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,720
This is a quick end if you can get him to jump on the glass.

359
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,940
Oh, there's a glass floor.

360
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,160
Oh, the one in the middle.

361
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,040
Oh,

362
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,220
this one.

363
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,400
Ah...

364
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
I see.

365
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,920
I'm sick of this guy.

366
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,200
Sick of this guy.

367
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,380
Okay.

368
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,570
I can't see anything.

369
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,830
Oh my gosh.

370
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,770
Why are these camera angles all of a sudden?

371
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,550
Please, I can't see anything.

372
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,390
I can't see anything.

373
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,770
Oh my gosh.

374
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,380
Oh, nevermind.

375
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Up.

376
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,820
Oh, he shoots up at me too.

377
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

378
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,280
Okay.

379
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,780
And he like...

380
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,200
Nice.

381
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,220
Jump, jump, jump!

382
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh my god.

383
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,160
Guys, I forgot how to shoot actually.

384
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,300
Oh, nevermind.

385
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,420
I remember how to shoot.

386
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,820
I can't see anything.

387
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,700
Ouch.

388
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,980
I keep pressing left trigger instead of double trigger.

389
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,250
You gotta live, buddy.

390
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,800
Oh my gosh.

391
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,080
I did not expect to go back into a...

392
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,690
Into a boss fight immediately.

393
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
We're getting like halfway there though.

394
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,400
We're getting...

395
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,260
Yeah, I know, for real.

396
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,440
What a warm up.

397
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,180
Oh, my double trigger was charged.

398
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
Oh, it charged really fast then.

399
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,700
I didn't realize.

400
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,540
My bad.

401
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,760
It's okay.

402
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,060
Double trigger came in last minute.

403
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,820
This is good though.

404
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,320
I think this is the best kind of warm up because it helps me...

405
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,100
Remember so much in like such a short amount of time.

406
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,620
You know what I mean?

407
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,500
Don't be afraid to spam double trigger.

408
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,080
Yeah.

409
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,700
I gotta really be better about it.

410
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,380
It charges faster each hit by melee.

411
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,080
I see, I see.

412
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,510
Scooby-doo.

413
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,690
Get up on the phantom's back.

414
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,250
How do I bait him to jump though?

415
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,210
Is it like I have to go far away?

416
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:28,590
I wonder.

417
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,150
He didn't jump very much this time.

418
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,230
Maybe I have to be...

419
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,330
Yeah, maybe I have to be further away.

420
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,630
Make sure to kill the boss instead of losing to the boss.

421
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,090
You're so right.

422
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,730
So true.

423
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,850
No, he doesn't start with a jump, right?

424
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,790
I think it depends.

425
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,670
Last time he...

426
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,050
Started with a charge.

427
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,490
Just like...

428
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,330
Do the thing.

429
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,730
Just...

430
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,890
Oh my god.

431
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,150
You're right!

432
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,170
Oh my gosh!

433
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,630
Oh my gosh!

434
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,900
Oh shoot!

435
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,100
How the hell?

436
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,140
Oh, that cancels out.

437
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,620
That's nice.

438
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,530
I'm gonna...

439
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,250
Oh, I...

440
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,790
Damn it!

441
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,450
I keep pressing this.

442
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,210
I'm so sorry guys.

443
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,610
I know it's annoying.

444
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,350
It's annoying for me too.

445
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,110
Kill!

446
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,570
Kill!

447
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,730
Oh my gosh.

448
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,090
Kill!

449
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,310
Kill!

450
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:49,870
Kill!

451
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,510
Kill!

452
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,050
Kill!

453
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,870
Are

454
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,690
you gonna jump at me?

455
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,650
Or...

456
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,050
Oh!

457
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,590
Jump back!

458
00:25:59,650 --> 00:25:59,910
Jump back!

459
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,390
I think

460
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,620
I cancelled it.

461
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:19,880
Nice.

462
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,020
Run!

463
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,700
Run Dante!

464
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:21,940
Run!

465
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,620
I'm believing!

466
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,020
I'm believing!

467
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
I believe.

468
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,640
I believed!

469
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,680
I believed!

470
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,380
I saw it kept recharging so fast.

471
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,260
Speed.

472
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,560
Nah, I'm like...

473
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,350
I'm mid-Phantom.

474
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,320
Sparda!

475
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,980
Good.

476
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:27,160
Oh my god, the way like the bloody magma is just spewing out of him is so awesome.

477
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,310
Sweet dreams!

478
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,850
Mommy!

479
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,450
Maybe.

480
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:46,750
Mommy?

481
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,870
I was gonna make a smartass comment, but you went and beat it before I had the chance.

482
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:52,930
See?

483
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,850
I just had to warm up a little bit.

484
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,570
Mommy!

485
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,290
Baby!

486
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,430
I just needed a chance to warm up.

487
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,170
Wait, can I go?

488
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,030
Oh, it won't let me go in there anymore.

489
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,750
Okay, let's keep going.

490
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,970
It's my birthday today!

491
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,290
Mike Tyson's!

492
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,590
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

493
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,290
It's your birthday!

494
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,370
Happy birthday to you!

495
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,070
Happy birthday to you!

496
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,630
Happy birthday!

497
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,130
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

498
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,550
Happy birthday to you!

499
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,090
Happy birthday!

500
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,210
What's that?

501
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,030
The legendary pitchfork.

502
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,870
Trident.

503
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,470
A heavily decorated three-pronged pike that's used for rituals.

504
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,610
It cannot be used as a weapon.

505
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,930
Lame!

506
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:00,790
Hello?

507
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,610
Why is some of this... What is this little courtyard area?

508
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,930
This castle is weird.

509
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,350
DMC.

510
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,330
What's up here?

511
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,270
It looks like there's something up here.

512
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:17,730
No?

513
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,270
Okay.

514
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,070
Jump on the whore... Just kidding!

515
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,130
I knew it!

516
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,770
I knew...

517
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,330
Are you so serious right now?

518
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,370
Okay, good, good.

519
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,610
There

520
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,280
we go.

521
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:40,920
Oh shoot.

522
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,360
I saw it up there.

523
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,220
I was like, I can get it.

524
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,390
Fancy jumping there.

525
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,390
Wait, if I jump on the other horse's head do I get more rorbs?

526
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,970
Rorbs, please.

527
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,210
We got a piece of blorb.

528
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,270
And we got some rorbs.

529
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,990
No, okay.

530
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,170
That's fine.

531
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,410
Okay, now... Oh, Dante, no.

532
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,430
Dante, there we go.

533
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,110
What's this?

534
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,690
It's a lever used to wind up the drawbridge.

535
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,510
It's heavily rusted.

536
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,710
A strong downward force may help move the lever.

537
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,930
Okay, let me check out the rest of the room first.

538
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,050
It's the corpse of a soldier who must have wandered into the castle and died from exhaustion.

539
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,990
Same.

540
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,130
He's holding something.

541
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,290
A grenade gun!

542
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,330
Oh my gosh!

543
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,770
Fires exploding shells of shrapnel.

544
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,190
Extremely destructive.

545
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,210
Yes.

546
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,810
It seems to be a little slow.

547
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,770
Oh my gosh, my health.

548
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,750
I just realized.

549
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,250
Hopefully it will be okay.

550
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,510
Oh, sorry.

551
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,150
Once again, confusing things.

552
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,610
Can I open this up?

553
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,270
There must be a way to open this.

554
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,430
Yeah, just with your hands.

555
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,110
Mint.

556
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,450
Made me mint.

557
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,930
Would you rather fight one phantom-sized phantom or a hundred phantom-sized phantoms?

558
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,650
Are you saying...

559
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,070
I did it.

560
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,030
I'm already at war with myself, please.

561
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,510
Oh...

562
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,250
How silly.

563
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,570
Today I turned 31!

564
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,890
Can you please put in a good word for me with the afterlife?

565
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,110
I would appreciate it.

566
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,830
John, you still have way more time before the afterlife.

567
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,910
But I will try.

568
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,570
Happy birthday to you.

569
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,110
Happy birthday to you.

570
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,430
Happy birthday, John V.

571
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,230
Happy birthday to you.

572
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,070
Can I try... Wait a second, we've been in this room before.

573
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,710
I have.

574
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:44,050
There are three openings to insert something.

575
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,610
Shall I use the trident?

576
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,710
Yes.

577
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,890
That's what I meant by three openings.

578
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,120
The devil may care.

579
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,310
Your progress as a devil hunter...

580
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,250
Oh my gosh.

581
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,470
Oh, it's slowly but surely.

582
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,610
Slowly but surely.

583
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,650
Getting down.

584
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,810
Ok, there we go.

585
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,650
And one more.

586
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,590
There you go.

587
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,210
Oh, and it still goes.

588
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,730
Am I supposed to...

589
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,210
Oh, ok.

590
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,210
Was I supposed to...

591
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,870
Oh my god.

592
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,130
Was I supposed to make it downstairs before that closed?

593
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,130
Now that I'm wondering.

594
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,090
You need to race it.

595
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:51,670
No way.

596
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,190
I just realized.

597
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,890
I was like, why is it going so slow?

598
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,330
It said this gun is very destructive.

599
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,370
It worked.

600
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,430
It did not work.

601
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,330
Wait, so how do I get it back up again?

602
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,830
And how...do I...get...oh my gosh.

603
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,930
Stop it!

604
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,280
Work.

605
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,220
You can come up with Inches Will Laugh as a parody title, but it actually sounds cool AF.

606
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,060
B, that's what I'm pressing.

607
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,080
Oh, there we go.

608
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,380
Yes, yes, please.

609
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,900
Oh my gosh.

610
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Jump.

611
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,620
There we go.

612
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,540
Run.

613
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,620
Run.

614
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Just go.

615
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,480
Just go for it.

616
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,100
Dante, go!

617
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,400
Ignore everybody else!

618
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,720
Ignore everybody else!

619
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,580
Is there here?

620
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,400
Oh, I made it.

621
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,160
I made it!

622
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,180
Welcome to my workshop.

623
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,680
Thank you.

624
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,140
I think my head almost got cut off there.

625
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,120
Actually a little bit, but you know.

626
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,840
C for cry.

627
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,660
Devil may cry.

628
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,920
Also, C's get degrees, baby.

629
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,060
Nice.

630
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,600
Alright.

631
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,020
Oh, no.

632
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,660
We're good.

633
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,540
Next mission.

634
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,100
Mission 9.

635
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,800
New strength.

636
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,220
Use the new strength to open the door.

637
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,120
I'm stronger now.

638
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,660
I'm stronger.

639
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,720
Oh, there is the drawbridge.

640
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,560
I wish the camera angle would let me see the whole castle, you know.

641
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,160
There is a message carved in the circle.

642
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,580
The wheel of destiny shall guide you to the land of the beginning.

643
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,120
Also, I just realized.

644
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,960
Oh my gosh, you guys.

645
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,480
Part of the game is cut off.

646
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm so sorry.

647
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,680
I thought it was going to be 4-3 the whole time.

648
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,720
Here, I'll shrink myself just a tad.

649
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,840
There we go.

650
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,910
Sorry, I didn't notice sooner.

651
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,150
I thought it was 4-3 the whole time.

652
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,230
Good thing we made it in time.

653
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,570
OK.

654
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,290
Is this another boss battle?

655
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,670
I just did one.

656
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,650
There is a message carved on the stone.

657
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,910
It's a riddle of some kind.

658
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,010
There are secret dimensions where red stones hide.

659
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,850
They will appear when you do the out of the ordinary.

660
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,370
Oh, I thought it was going to rhyme.

661
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,070
OK.

662
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,370
Here I am putting on my stupid...

663
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,560
Why?

664
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,280
Riddles are supposed to sound a little funky, you know.

665
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,260
They are supposed to rhyme and stuff.

666
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,500
It's supposed to... What's out of the ordinary?

667
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,280
When I do this.

668
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,220
Nobody does that.

669
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,880
Also, this is a safe area, I guess.

670
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,720
We have this guy.

671
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,600
When I jump on top of here.

672
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,540
Oh, when I jump on top of here.

673
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,720
Oh, when I jump on top of here and make it.

674
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
It kind of rhymed.

675
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,920
No, it didn't.

676
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,780
Hide in ordinary?

677
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:18,980
Cody?

678
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,660
Cody, are you OK?

679
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,060
This is the out of the ordinary.

680
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,940
Oh wait, I can taunt when I use my right analog stick too?

681
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,460
That's funny.

682
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,840
What about here?

683
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,660
Oh, please.

684
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,580
Can I get the other... Oh, there is one over here too.

685
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:54,900
Flat.

686
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,220
Wait, what does this say?

687
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,500
Quick note about DMC.

688
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,560
It doesn't fully grasp its identity until DMC3.

689
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,080
So the jump in quality between 1 and 3 is huge.

690
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,360
I hope you can get to it eventually.

691
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,900
I will!

692
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,500
Thank you!

693
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,260
That's usually always why I play in release order.

694
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,020
Joy, thank you so much!

695
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Anything rhymes if you say it hard enough.

696
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,220
That's usually why I play in release order because...

697
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:31,580
It's just way too... It's just not as fun of an experience if you have to go from such a well...

698
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:40,840
A game that has been released way later and has finessed the controls to a game that just came out and everything.

699
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,820
You know.

700
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,200
So, when I saw some people being like, she's playing...

701
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,240
She's playing 1 first.

702
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,620
Why?

703
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,540
Because...

704
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,400
That's, you know...

705
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,100
If I can master the controls here, then, you know...

706
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,780
Then it's... The idea is that... Oh, come on, please.

707
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,860
The idea is I'll be better at it when it gets to further games.

708
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,820
I should be the one that fills your heart with light.

709
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,560
I don't think I understand that yet, but thank you.

710
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,650
But yeah, I...

711
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:30,150
I have heard so much from everybody about playing DMC2 or playing in release order.

712
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,130
Please.

713
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:38,230
Or that this game was supposed to be Resident Evil 4.

714
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,330
Please.

715
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,890
I'm so tired.

716
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:41,910
Please.

717
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,450
Please.

718
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,930
I'm so tired.

719
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,830
Like the purple Chibi Minty.

720
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,530
Thank you.

721
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,730
Oh, there's a message carved in the stone.

722
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,130
Seems to be a story of some kind.

723
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,430
Destiny awaits somewhere deep in the Coliseum.

724
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,090
That is not... What's... Where's the story?

725
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,670
What are you talking about?

726
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,250
That was one sentence.

727
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,390
Here we go.

728
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,950
A grorb.

729
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,230
Sorry.

730
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,310
Oh my gosh, it scared the heck out of me.

731
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,770
Oh my god.

732
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,930
I'll grab those.

733
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,510
Thank you.

734
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I killed him.

735
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,140
I think.

736
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,080
I did it.

737
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,220
Wow, there's a lot of stuff here.

738
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,320
A yorb.

739
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,340
Sacred stone brings... What?

740
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,560
Oh my gosh.

741
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
A yorb!

742
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,400
Remember me?

743
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,280
I told you you'd be annihilated.

744
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,220
Get the rorb.

745
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,180
Wait, what?

746
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,400
Yay!

747
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,220
I can save now.

748
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,640
I know.

749
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,240
Oh my gosh.

750
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,700
Hallelujah.

751
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,520
Wait, is there stuff up here?

752
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,600
This looks like a little secret area.

753
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,800
What's this?

754
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,860
There's a message carved into the giant stone tablet.

755
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,620
This is where blue light is sealed.

756
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,580
Well, I'll unseal it.

757
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,260
Yay!

758
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,200
Blorb.

759
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,600
Nice.

760
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,260
I'll take that blorb.

761
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,080
Thank you.

762
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,420
There was more over here.

763
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,520
Dante is running extra slow in this area.

764
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:10,940
Why?

765
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,500
Wow, there's so much around here actually.

766
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,500
Why do these feel like traps?

767
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,820
I'm kind of scared.

768
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,280
If you side roll in between each shot you can fire the grenade launcher faster.

769
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,600
I see.

770
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,540
Some more relevant questions.

771
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,000
Do you know about the Divine Comedy?

772
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,760
I don't.

773
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,960
There's a decoration resembling two knights.

774
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,540
It appears as though the knights should be holding something.

775
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,300
Words are carved beneath the decoration.

776
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,120
The shields that glow with light and a pair of lances shall lead to the battleground.

777
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,880
Wow, there's so much.

778
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,220
Oh my god.

779
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,020
There's so much here.

780
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,240
This looks like a glowing shield.

781
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,460
There's an emblem of a shield on the door.

782
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,620
Why does this door look so tiny?

783
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,160
It's made for babies.

784
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,960
Oh, with red light.

785
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,320
Sorry.

786
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,880
Oh, I guess Dante is the baby.

787
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,940
It's literally the size of him.

788
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,960
Nice.

789
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,320
Don't say Minto size.

790
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,220
Wow, there's so much...

791
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,420
Oh my gosh, there's so much around here you guys.

792
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,460
What's this?

793
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,120
I got...

794
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,740
Holy water!

795
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,500
Water of divine blessings.

796
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,660
It holds the power to eliminate all the evil that's around you.

797
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,120
Ooh...

798
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,250
Dante is canon 6'3"?

799
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:50,290
I was gonna say, he's actually as tall as these doors, so I feel like they're...

800
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,510
I feel like... I thought they were all just very small.

801
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:59,390
OK, so we have this area, we have this area, and then we have this whole hallway.

802
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,710
So let's go down the hallway, I suppose.

803
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,250
Grab all these orbs.

804
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,250
Oh wait, there's another...

805
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,810
There's an emblem of a shield on the door that glows with blue light.

806
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,350
Did you know that Dante and Leon were supposed to partake in hot, steamy...

807
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,790
Oh look, I reached my word limit.

808
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,470
Thanks, Alex.

809
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,570
Didn't know that.

810
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,530
Hot, steamy what, Alex?

811
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,810
Hot, steamy what?

812
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,710
So what did it say again?

813
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,030
Hold on.

814
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,290
The shields that glow with light and a pair of lances shall lead to the battleground.

815
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,030
OK, so we need both shields and then also...

816
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,870
Oh, this is the coliseum that we're at.

817
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,810
And then we need the lances.

818
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,510
Words are carved here.

819
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,610
Oh, a pair of flames that dwell with strength will open the path.

820
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,710
Dante is canonically 6'3".

821
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,730
Forget saving the world.

822
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,930
His eyes should be playing for the 76ers.

823
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,200
Why does this look jumpable?

824
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,290
Anything?

825
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,250
I don't see anything.

826
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,070
I guess we're going down here.

827
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,010
Down yonder.

828
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:21,890
Alright.

829
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,350
Here we go.

830
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,200
Am I going to get ambushed again?

831
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,900
This gate must have led to the outside, but it's been destroyed.

832
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,880
And that means I can't go through.

833
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,360
Astute observation, Dante.

834
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,380
I don't need ladders.

835
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,220
I don't need your stinking ladders.

836
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,300
Let's see.

837
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,140
Good morning, Minto.

838
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,120
Good morning, Minto!

839
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,320
What's this?

840
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,860
It is a star.

841
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,400
Devil star.

842
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,160
Crystal with magical powers that will recover five devil trigger gauges.

843
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,240
Let's go.

844
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,260
Check out the other side.

845
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,420
I did see the thing in the middle.

846
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,920
I don't need no ladder.

847
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,630
The blue and the...oh, there we go.

848
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:39,650
Yorb.

849
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:40,590
What's this?

850
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:42,590
Oh, this is the thing that I hit.

851
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:46,030
Before we do that, I saw a yorb.

852
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,090
Over yonder.

853
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,970
That's not a yorb.

854
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,470
Oh, it is a yorb.

855
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,510
Now we have two of them.

856
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,370
Lucky us.

857
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,170
Lucky, lucky.

858
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,670
What was over here though?

859
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,090
Oh, I'm an idiot.

860
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,110
It's all connected.

861
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,520
Oh my gosh.

862
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,360
Devil may cry parkour.

863
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:28,840
Oh boy.

864
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:29,500
OK.

865
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:31,920
OK.

866
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,980
This is fine.

867
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,200
No!

868
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,780
I thought I'd cheat the system.

869
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,540
Oh gosh.

870
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,760
Literally impossible.

871
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,360
This is...the camera angles make this so...

872
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,120
God!

873
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,420
Oh no.

874
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,220
OK.

875
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
Welcome to the hardest part of the game, Rinto.

876
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,560
This one and the one in DMC3 are the worst.

877
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:12,340
Oh, my depth perception will not allow me to do this properly, I think.

878
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,800
OK.

879
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,800
Oh man, I can't tell how far I am at all.

880
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,120
I feel like I should be able to make it to this one even too, right?

881
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,300
Like...hold on.

882
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,820
OK, I'm gonna give up.

883
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,560
Not on the entire segment, just trying that.

884
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,320
No one jumps for the blorb.

885
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,420
I've been sent to DMC parkour civilization jail so many times now.

886
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,380
Oh my gosh, I barely make that.

887
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,060
OK.

888
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,700
OK.

889
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,860
Once we go back up...

890
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,900
Oh my gosh.

891
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,460
Guys?

892
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,820
I was so close.

893
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,680
Is this all just for a yorb?

894
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,660
Or is there actually something that I need to...

895
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,320
Well, what is that up there?

896
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,740
Oh no, that's something floating.

897
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,060
OK, I do need to get that.

898
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,300
OK.

899
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,400
OK.

900
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,320
That was close.

901
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,480
It's a thing.

902
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,300
Yeah, it's a thing.

903
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,040
It's a thing.

904
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,120
OK.

905
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,060
Alright, camera angle.

906
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,080
Good job.

907
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,020
OK.

908
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,480
Alright.

909
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,600
That was close.

910
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,700
OK.

911
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,520
Nice, nice,

912
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,020
nice!

913
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,600
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

914
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,080
Holy moly.

915
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,980
Oh my gosh, you guys.

916
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,660
I might be...I might be the parkour champion!

917
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,320
I might be the parkour champion!

918
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,120
It's an inscription.

919
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,900
Oh there is an inscription on the base.

920
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,000
My name is Ifrit.

921
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,960
The fool who awakens me shall pay dearly with the fires of hell.

922
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,760
OK.

923
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,660
Guess I'll wake you up.

924
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,690
Wait, I'm absorbing the power?

925
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,750
Wait, I'm kind of ISO?

926
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:29,430
A flaming gauntlet that gives the possessor increased powers!

927
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,810
Oh my gosh, am I a punchy guy now?

928
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,570
Devil Arms.

929
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,210
Wait.

930
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,570
But...

931
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,830
Oh, but...wait.

932
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,350
What about Alistair?

933
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,070
Wait, should I keep Ifrit or Alistair?

934
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,610
Ifrit my beloved, the power of rising dragon.

935
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,090
You can quickly switch to...with right stick?

936
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:05,190
Oh, let's try it.

937
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,570
Hold on.

938
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:16,050
OK, it's not super fast, but it is quite fast.

939
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:17,910
Oh nice.

940
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:18,670
Is that it?

941
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,990
I think I...I'm going to guess there is something over here.

942
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,370
There is nothing over there.

943
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:24,410
Oh gosh!

944
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,730
Oh god!

945
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,070
Oh my god!

946
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:30,890
Judge!

947
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,250
Judge!

948
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,750
Oh, I miss?

949
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,570
I miss my sword!

950
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,990
Oh, well...

951
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:49,170
I did miss it and I changed to it.

952
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,150
I miss having the range.

953
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,350
I miss having the range.

954
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,770
Home, home on the range.

955
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:09,160
That doesn't seem very good.

956
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,980
Oh this doesn't...

957
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:11,940
Oh my god!

958
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,360
This seems a little bad, I think.

959
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,500
Maybe I should have saved.

960
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,260
Darkness Mundus?

961
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,400
Oh my god!

962
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:33,880
Wait, wait, wait.

963
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,260
Did you just...wait.

964
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:43,060
This might be stupid, but I think I should do this.

965
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,780
Okay, we are on file 2.

966
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,420
I just taunted him on accident.

967
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,940
Oh my gosh!

968
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,980
Thank you for the Hocus Pocus!

969
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,340
I can't...I can't pay attention right now!

970
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,420
Your timing is...

971
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:25,900
Oh

972
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,480
my gosh!

973
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:31,760
Ouch!

974
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Ouch!

975
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,120
Ouch!

976
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:32,360
Ouch!

977
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,940
Oh I tried to jump!

978
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,560
I tried to jump!

979
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:35,620
Oh my gosh!

980
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,660
Oh my god!

981
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,840
Sometimes you jump, sometimes you don't.

982
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:41,820
Jump!

983
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,360
Dante!

984
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:42,620
Dante!

985
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,420
Get out of the way!

986
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,780
I don't know if I'm actually supposed to...maybe...

987
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,480
Okay, what do I have?

988
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,660
Do I have my...

989
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,380
Oh my god!

990
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,120
Don't jump!

991
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,480
Don't jump!

992
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,400
Sometimes jump!

993
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,580
Don't jump!

994
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,400
Oh my god!

995
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,440
Yeah!

996
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,300
Oh, devil trigger.

997
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,040
Let's do that.

998
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:09,820
Where are you?

999
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,120
Oh my gosh!

1000
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:19,630
At least I healed.

1001
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,180
Oh my god!

1002
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,540
Ouch!

1003
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:36,440
Yeah!

1004
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:36,840
Yeah!

1005
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,300
Yeah!

1006
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,380
Oh gosh!

1007
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,540
I don't think I'm doing this fight correctly, but whatever.

1008
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,070
Yeah!

1009
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,630
Oh gosh!

1010
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,740
Oh!

1011
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,300
Ah!

1012
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,680
Shoot!

1013
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,320
I didn't see it.

1014
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,620
Oh my god!

1015
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,400
I'm gonna die, I think.

1016
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,840
Ah!

1017
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,220
No!

1018
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,100
Oh my god!

1019
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,460
I think I'm dead.

1020
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,180
I think I'm dead.

1021
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,980
Try again.

1022
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,520
Oh wait.

1023
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:40,110
Guys, if I run out of orbs I'm so doomed.

1024
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:45,790
What?

1025
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,790
Why are we here?

1026
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,010
Wait, why is it you guys?

1027
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:50,990
Oh my gosh.

1028
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,890
Yeah!

1029
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:10,870
Oh shoot.

1030
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,620
More?

1031
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,100
Oh.

1032
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,100
Get away from me.

1033
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:52,770
Oh my gosh!

1034
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,390
Why is he not stopping?

1035
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,690
I'm gonna run out of orbs at this point.

1036
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:11,670
Oh my gosh.

1037
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,890
What the hell is this camera angle?

1038
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:15,710
Oh my gosh.

1039
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:16,610
Thank you.

1040
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:16,950
No!

1041
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,510
I lost a big orb.

1042
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,930
It's so rude.

1043
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,090
I'm gonna run out of orbs.

1044
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,990
If they make me always go back to this part.

1045
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,150
Lost a big orb.

1046
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:35,650
Yeah.

1047
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,630
Ok.

1048
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,690
Oh shoot.

1049
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:40,670
Ok.

1050
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:41,350
Alright.

1051
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,050
Alright.

1052
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:46,730
Alright.

1053
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,090
Alright.

1054
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:47,290
Alright.

1055
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:54,290
I wish there was a level up thingy here because I kinda wanna wish... I wish I had more air...

1056
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,090
What was... Wait.

1057
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,790
I don't even know if I can afford the air one.

1058
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:58,730
I think it was 4000.

1059
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:00,450
Can't even afford it.

1060
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:05,850
Ok.

1061
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,200
Ok.

1062
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:16,740
Alright.

1063
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,320
Alright.

1064
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,040
Let's do this.

1065
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:19,460
Wait.

1066
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,380
Air rate is 750?

1067
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,640
What was the other one that I'm thinking of?

1068
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,580
I can't see anything!

1069
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,540
Oh shoot!

1070
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,480
Why did I jump early?

1071
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,240
Oh my gosh.

1072
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,680
Oh that was so close!

1073
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,340
Oh shoot!

1074
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,100
Double trigger.

1075
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,520
I'm just gonna double trigger whenever I can.

1076
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,080
Oh.

1077
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,180
That was kinda silly.

1078
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,460
That was pretty silly actually.

1079
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,160
Please.

1080
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:50,900
Oh my god.

1081
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,380
Why is it... Why... What is happening?

1082
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,900
I hate this camera angle so much.

1083
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,200
Don't move!

1084
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:03,580
Don't move!

1085
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,820
Why am I not hitting him ever?

1086
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,580
I have an itch on my nose.

1087
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,350
Oh my gosh.

1088
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,410
Oh my gosh game.

1089
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:30,710
Please.

1090
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:32,990
I know you hate me.

1091
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,270
I know you hate me.

1092
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,130
Oh my gosh.

1093
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,600
Oh no, no, no.

1094
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:10,470
Please.

1095
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,250
Please god.

1096
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,130
I can't see anything.

1097
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:12,590
Please.

1098
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,690
Oh my gosh.

1099
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,650
That was so close.

1100
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,780
We are so close.

1101
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:48,620
We are so close.

1102
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,620
We are so close.

1103
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,540
We are so close.

1104
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,880
Nice.

1105
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,220
Second try.

1106
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,080
Flock off feather face!

1107
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:31,860
Save complete.

1108
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,760
Alright, then we go this way.

1109
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,580
Minto kinda cracked.

1110
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,240
Oh wait.

1111
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,660
Pair of flames that dwell with strength.

1112
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:44,980
Do I have to like punch it?

1113
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,620
Do I double trigger on it?

1114
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,420
Can you... Big puncha.

1115
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,880
Oh, here we go.

1116
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,260
Wait, I didn't even know I could do that.

1117
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:04,500
Wait.

1118
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,560
Oh, I see.

1119
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:08,940
I see.

1120
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,640
There we go.

1121
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,760
Back to my sword I feel very comfortable with.

1122
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,120
I feel like Silent Hill out here.

1123
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,280
There is something in this tree.

1124
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,220
Spoopy area.

1125
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:38,500
Rorb!

1126
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,560
I mean, sorry.

1127
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,380
Grorb.

1128
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,200
I don't know my colors.

1129
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,360
I always just want to say Rorb I think.

1130
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:52,300
Uh oh.

1131
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,800
What does that mean?

1132
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:54,560
Uh oh.

1133
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,120
Oh no.

1134
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,340
Why?

1135
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:57,700
Please.

1136
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,620
I just had to deal with a big old bird.

1137
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:00,400
No!

1138
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,260
Why are you here?

1139
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,280
What is that?

1140
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:07,680
Oh gosh.

1141
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,500
God, why?

1142
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,300
Fetish?

1143
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,660
I'm

1144
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,650
not really concerned about killing it coolly.

1145
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,930
I'm concerned about living.

1146
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,870
Wait, there was a big old Rorb there.

1147
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,050
Take that.

1148
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:33,710
Oh!

1149
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,200
And explode!

1150
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,300
And attack!

1151
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,160
And explode!

1152
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,280
And attack!

1153
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,080
And explode!

1154
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,400
And jump!

1155
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,200
And jump!

1156
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,160
Jump and explode!

1157
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,680
And attack and explode!

1158
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,560
I saw a Grorb!

1159
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,220
I see a Grorb!

1160
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,640
Oh, I got him.

1161
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,080
Jump!

1162
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,040
I love fight and explode.

1163
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,260
It's maybe not the most stylish, but it's effective.

1164
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:24,000
Maybe the game says that's not how you are supposed to play my game.

1165
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,340
I don't care.

1166
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,060
It's effective.

1167
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,060
Wait, what about this over here?

1168
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,060
This also had it's own little...

1169
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,700
What's in here?

1170
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,020
I don't want to... I don't know.

1171
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,960
I heard some walk... Oh come on!

1172
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,640
Leave an area.

1173
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,980
There's always gotta be new buddies here.

1174
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,800
Get away from me!

1175
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,710
I guess I'll go here first.

1176
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,350
Mr...

1177
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,450
What's this?

1178
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:08,970
Safety room!

1179
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:10,950
Safety room.

1180
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,170
Magma drive.

1181
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:22,570
Charge power and release it in the form of a magma uppercut.

1182
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:25,890
Kirk?

1183
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,630
Oh, kick this.

1184
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,950
Sorry, I couldn't read the font on the left.

1185
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:33,290
I was like, who the hell is Kirk?

1186
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,930
Kick 13, level 1.

1187
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:37,810
Kick is smooth.

1188
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,890
A quick but powerful flaming back roundhouse kick.

1189
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,690
It's impact will drive the enemy back.

1190
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,810
Rolling blaze.

1191
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:56,010
Surround the body in flame and damage enemies upon contact.

1192
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:57,910
Meteor level 1.

1193
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,910
Shoot fireballs from the fist.

1194
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:02,470
Inferno.

1195
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:05,530
Create a wall of fire and burn everything within range.

1196
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,470
Do not have enough orbs.

1197
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,280
I really like Stinger though.

1198
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:18,920
There's what?

1199
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,440
Air raid?

1200
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,040
Become airborne and become capable.

1201
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,800
Yeah, air hike is the double jump.

1202
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,760
Stinger is live.

1203
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,780
I love Stinger.

1204
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,380
I don't mind this one, it's just I feel safe with so much range.

1205
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,520
Guys,

1206
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,920
it's so confusing!

1207
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,880
It's so confusing when you go from...

1208
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:11,600
From Japanese games where X is back and circle is submit.

1209
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,280
And then you have to do circle, submit, X back...

1210
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,880
Wait, no, hold on.

1211
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,880
Wait, X...

1212
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,240
Yes, circle no.

1213
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,340
Oh my gosh.

1214
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,520
No, I didn't mean to do this.

1215
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,780
I didn't mean to do that.

1216
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,280
Wait, so how do I use it anyway then?

1217
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:40,640
What did I even buy?

1218
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,580
What did I buy?

1219
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,560
Weeb problems.

1220
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,300
I know, I know it's a weeb problem.

1221
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,280
What did I buy anyway?

1222
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,200
Charge power and release... Oh, I'm never gonna use this!

1223
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,240
How long of a charge is it?

1224
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,900
How long of a charge is it?

1225
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,700
Lock on, back attack.

1226
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,760
Oh, I'm never gonna use this.

1227
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,660
I'm never gonna use this.

1228
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,620
What do you mean back?

1229
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:26,320
Oh, not... Wait, yeah, controller setup.

1230
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,320
Wait, that doesn't show me anything.

1231
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,260
Six months with the Minto.

1232
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:32,060
Thanks Viper!

1233
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,630
See, it's so easy to just click forward, you know.

1234
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,530
Oh man...

1235
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:54,910
Oh man...

1236
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,350
The opposite direction that Dante is facing.

1237
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,530
I can't believe I wasted my robes.

1238
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:06,550
I'm so angry.

1239
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,830
Wait, so let's see what down here is.

1240
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:11,110
Oh,

1241
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,290
I'm so sorry!

1242
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:42,470
Wait, unlock 50% of all entries for every enemy file.

1243
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,950
That's an achievement I just got.

1244
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,310
There's like 50 of you.

1245
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,010
No,

1246
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,590
no, I want to attack the other guy.

1247
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,230
Don't even let them stand up!

1248
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:38,810
Not

1249
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,880
interesting, not fun.

1250
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,540
Not interesting or fun.

1251
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,020
Stupid move.

1252
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:53,860
Terrible.

1253
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,340
You're the worst at this game.

1254
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,320
My sick reflexes, everybody.

1255
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,380
How do they... When do they stop?

1256
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,700
We are farming robes like crazy right now.

1257
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,600
I guess that's when they stop.

1258
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,440
Holy moly!

1259
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,160
Yorb!

1260
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,340
Beloved Yorb!

1261
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,300
Please, Dante, stick the landing.

1262
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:25,180
Ah!

1263
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:39,440
Something endearing about a maid running around with a grenade launcher, stingering you on the door, and blasting your mid-range while your ass is on the floor.

1264
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,640
I'll do that to ya!

1265
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,180
I will.

1266
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:47,820
What's this?

1267
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,300
Devil star.

1268
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,020
What is this though?

1269
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,020
Oh, this is a...

1270
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,460
Yes!

1271
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,040
Farm the robes!

1272
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,900
Farm the robes!

1273
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,160
Farm the robes!

1274
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,260
Yeah, baby!

1275
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,380
Two attacks delay.

1276
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,920
What is that sound?

1277
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:16,700
Oh my god.

1278
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,940
Oh my god, where did you come from?

1279
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:23,850
What?

1280
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:24,290
Wait.

1281
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:27,850
Two...oh.

1282
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,050
Where the heck?

1283
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:33,190
Big money.

1284
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,130
Hell yeah.

1285
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:36,630
Wait, is there anything in here?

1286
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,570
A grorb and a little bit of orb.

1287
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,170
What's this?

1288
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,390
You use...

1289
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,270
I don't always have trouble with confirm and cancel.

1290
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,790
I always swap A, B, O, B.

1291
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,570
Keep it the same across all games.

1292
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,670
I much prefer JP style.

1293
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,550
It makes sense.

1294
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:59,370
The JP style, because it's like circle is OK and X is no.

1295
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,650
I keep spending my robes, you guys.

1296
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,690
Wait a second though.

1297
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,350
Where am I supposed to go?

1298
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:11,970
I guess I'll go through here.

1299
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,210
Oh!

1300
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,740
Bird of prey.

1301
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,540
Survive an encounter with a griffon.

1302
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,160
OK.

1303
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,680
But X marks the spot.

1304
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,100
No, X is like no.

1305
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,080
Like bad X.

1306
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,980
But O is like ping pong.

1307
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:37,500
OK.

1308
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,420
I wonder if the other...

1309
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,420
If the other...

1310
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,060
If I swapped controller style, if it would be better.

1311
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,940
Snake might say I can't do it when it comes to singers, but Dante doesn't have that problem.

1312
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,340
So true.

1313
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,340
Next mission.

1314
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,180
Canyon of mist.

1315
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,700
Come out of the labyrinth canyon alive.

1316
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,180
Easier said than done, man.

1317
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,480
Just live.

1318
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,200
Just do it.

1319
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,880
Should I get another blorb?

1320
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,200
Finally made it to a stream.

1321
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:24,540
Hello!

1322
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,700
Just live.

1323
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,660
Should I get another blorb?

1324
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:29,880
Blorb.

1325
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:35,580
Buy all blorb and plorb.

1326
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,340
I'm going to

1327
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:59,610
buy a blorb.

1328
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:04,450
I know I said I was saving up my money, but I've already wasted it.

1329
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,850
I've already wasted it on this.

1330
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,230
I know people were saying this too though.

1331
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:11,030
You know what?

1332
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:13,750
How do I do the kick if I want to use it?

1333
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,510
Hail to the blorb!

1334
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,510
How do I use the kick?

1335
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:23,070
It's like stinger?

1336
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:24,070
Same way as stinger?

1337
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,230
Hi dad!

1338
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,470
Alright, that's as much as I'll spend now.

1339
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:31,010
Canyon of mist.

1340
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,510
Mission start!

1341
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,930
I'll even put my fists up.

1342
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:43,470
That's it?

1343
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,170
Oh I kicked.

1344
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:44,450
Yeah.

1345
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,910
But I like that with the stinger.

1346
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,410
It gives you a lot of range.

1347
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,110
You start in there real well.

1348
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:57,070
These guys are not even subtle about it.

1349
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,000
We did it.

1350
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,340
Oh, there's more?

1351
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:37,240
Somewhere.

1352
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:39,040
Where?

1353
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:39,840
Oh, down there.

1354
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:41,420
What's it say?

1355
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,220
It's a riddle of some kind.

1356
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,340
Valley of the mist.

1357
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,520
One must choose the right path...

1358
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,200
to enter the lost land.

1359
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,520
Only those who protect the weak...

1360
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,040
Light shall have the power to decipher the right path?

1361
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,220
Wait, what?

1362
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,300
Worst riddle ever.

1363
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,340
What the hell was that?

1364
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,230
Am I gonna hate this?

1365
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,690
Am I gonna hate this mission?

1366
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,220
Have you had work today?

1367
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,620
Oh no!

1368
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,040
Good luck with work!

1369
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,760
Oh, ouchie ouch.

1370
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:36,320
Oh my god, they never... Oh wait, it's this little light thing.

1371
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,200
Is it this?

1372
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:43,640
This little guy that I'm watching run away from me?

1373
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,040
It's that little guy.

1374
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,540
Oh my god!

1375
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,680
Oh, you again!

1376
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,040
OK.

1377
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,780
Where'd my little light friend go?

1378
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,360
Oh, there he is.

1379
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,580
OK, let's just keep running.

1380
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,480
OK, following you!

1381
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,100
Come on, guy!

1382
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,440
OK.

1383
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,860
Oh my god!

1384
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:17,620
Oh my god!

1385
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,620
Oh my god, where'd my little worm go?

1386
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,120
I mean my warp go.

1387
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,870
Where is he?

1388
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:38,970
Little guy!

1389
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,050
There he is.

1390
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,590
Is it the same way every time?

1391
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:46,430
OK, I'm following you!

1392
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:48,910
OK.

1393
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,280
Oh!

1394
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,500
Oh my god, what am I facing?

1395
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:58,740
No!

1396
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,220
No, you are not serious right now.

1397
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,720
You are not serious right now.

1398
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:06,740
Oh my god.

1399
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,260
Please, let me away from this area.

1400
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:14,420
Thank you.

1401
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,390
It's just a mini guy.

1402
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,070
Ouch.

1403
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,310
I'm gonna...

1404
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,680
Oh, he's dead.

1405
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:29,780
Oh, there is another one.

1406
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,060
OK, very good.

1407
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,700
OK, I love that.

1408
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,000
I love fighting this guy.

1409
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,880
This tiny bit over and over.

1410
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:38,460
There we go.

1411
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,640
Tiny little guy.

1412
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,220
Yep, yep.

1413
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:43,860
Very good.

1414
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,240
Love that.

1415
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,680
Oh, nice.

1416
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,640
They are kicking your butt.

1417
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:49,560
Are they?

1418
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,100
You wanna say that again?

1419
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:51,420
Huh?

1420
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,200
They are kicking my butt?

1421
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:53,840
Huh?

1422
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,440
Yeah, you wanna say that again?

1423
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:55,820
Huh?

1424
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,610
Kicking my butt, huh?

1425
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:05,750
I...Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that I can cancel the...

1426
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,210
I guess I didn't need to grab that, huh?

1427
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,170
My health is full.

1428
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:11,370
I keep forgetting that I can cancel the devil trigger, but it's OK.

1429
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,400
Let's see.

1430
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,320
Anything up here?

1431
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,240
Besides a hot lady head.

1432
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,400
OK, this is kicking my butt.

1433
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,880
I just get so flustered.

1434
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,480
Climbing onto the woman.

1435
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:39,820
I'll make it.

1436
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,220
I'll make it.

1437
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,220
Maybe I won't.

1438
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:45,780
You know what?

1439
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,280
I give up.

1440
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:52,170
This one is glowing.

1441
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:52,650
Why?

1442
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:55,830
The devil may cry because his Oshimito hates him.

1443
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:57,510
No!

1444
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:00,670
OK, I don't think these have anything.

1445
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:01,310
OK.

1446
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:03,230
Let's continue onwards.

1447
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:04,690
What was the mission anyway?

1448
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,630
Come out of the labyrinth canyon alive.

1449
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,490
Oh, I think we made it.

1450
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,400
Yippee!

1451
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,560
B for Binto.

1452
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,340
Nice.

1453
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,240
I'll take it.

1454
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,520
And I will save.

1455
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,360
There we go.

1456
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,280
Binto.

1457
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:43,760
Boobies.

1458
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,640
No!

1459
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,300
What mission am I on now?

1460
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,060
I don't even know.

1461
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,920
Oh, 11.

1462
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,540
What, there were 25?

1463
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,200
26?

1464
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,460
Offer the chalice and open the path.

1465
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,400
23!

1466
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:05,620
23!

1467
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,900
Let's go.

1468
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,180
Oh my gosh, wait.

1469
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,440
We are almost halfway there.

1470
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:13,740
Yippee!

1471
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:18,980
Oh, what is that?

1472
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:19,820
What is that?

1473
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,560
What is that?

1474
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,980
Oh my gosh, what is happening?

1475
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,420
What is happening to me?

1476
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,240
They are playing...

1477
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,080
They are playing like...

1478
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,260
With my body.

1479
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,580
Oh my gosh.

1480
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,000
What the hell is this guy's issue?

1481
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,380
Oh my god.

1482
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,900
No, I hate this thing.

1483
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:40,780
I hate this thing a lot.

1484
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,160
He is too fast for me.

1485
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,120
Oh my gosh.

1486
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,610
No, no, stop, stop.

1487
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,330
Stop playing with my body, please.

1488
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:51,190
Stop!

1489
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:52,450
Stop it!

1490
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,800
I can only...

1491
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:18,890
Oh my gosh.

1492
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:21,730
Please.

1493
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,750
This area sucks so bad.

1494
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,810
This area is really terrible.

1495
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:31,010
Oh my gosh, I can't see anything.

1496
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:36,390
Where are you?

1497
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:40,110
I was killing him for a second.

1498
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,280
No, stop!

1499
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:57,260
Ouch!

1500
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,580
I don't like this guy.

1501
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,820
I don't like this guy.

1502
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:10,900
No!

1503
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,280
I'm not hitting.

1504
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,700
I'm not hitting.

1505
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,100
Oh my gosh.

1506
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,200
It's so annoying.

1507
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:42,430
Because when he is in this mode, I don't know what to do with him.

1508
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:43,330
Ok, there we go.

1509
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,580
I feel like I'm just jumping around and doing nothing.

1510
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,080
Oh no, no, no, no.

1511
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,040
What just happened?

1512
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,860
Oh my god!

1513
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,890
I escaped I think.

1514
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,160
Oh, I think he is dead.

1515
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:49,010
Wait, I thought areas with this thing were safe areas.

1516
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:50,290
I guess not.

1517
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:50,850
Oh, what's this?

1518
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,240
What the?

1519
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,120
What's going on?

1520
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,700
Did I die?

1521
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:07,680
Oops.

1522
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,920
I died, I think.

1523
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:16,010
Wait, I didn't want to use my YORB!

1524
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,470
But if I...

1525
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:02,750
I used my YORB.

1526
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:03,450
You could reload.

1527
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:05,610
I could, right?

1528
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:05,710
Wait.

1529
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,800
If I just exit and then...

1530
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,400
Wait, I did reload right at the beginning of this mission, right?

1531
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,760
So, ok.

1532
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,380
Because it's like, what's the point in using the YORB?

1533
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,060
Oh, I did it again.

1534
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:25,680
Oops.

1535
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,040
Oh, it's just... Wait, how do I actually reload?

1536
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:30,960
Ok, hold on.

1537
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:31,360
In here?

1538
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:33,920
Exit?

1539
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:34,400
No.

1540
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,200
Reset?

1541
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:37,920
Quit the mission?

1542
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:39,260
Yes.

1543
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,660
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

1544
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:43,520
Load.

1545
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:45,660
You.

1546
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,260
Load.

1547
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,720
Ok, the chalice.

1548
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:51,740
Yeah.

1549
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,620
Do I still have my...

1550
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,200
I don't know how much...

1551
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,700
Ok, I think it's... Yeah, I used...

1552
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,700
Ok, we're good.

1553
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,120
We're good.

1554
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,840
Those have been bought.

1555
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,720
Mission start.

1556
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,500
And now, I'm gonna see... Ok, I still have two YORBS.

1557
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:12,940
We're good.

1558
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,020
You guys, please.

1559
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:32,120
I don't know if you guys are being joking or sarcastic anymore, but please know more about the Resident Evil 4.

1560
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,220
Please.

1561
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,660
Please save me.

1562
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,920
You can use holy water against enemies you don't like.

1563
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:40,260
You know what?

1564
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,180
That's so true.

1565
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:46,560
Please, I'm so sick about Resident Evil 4.

1566
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,560
I'm gonna become a Resident Evil 4 auntie.

1567
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,340
It's not a joke.

1568
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,520
It's a piece of fun trivia.

1569
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,600
Oh, maybe I need to update the pin message then.

1570
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:00,600
Maybe.

1571
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,500
Please.

1572
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,640
I know.

1573
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:18,220
I know.

1574
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:25,780
I've never been more annoyed by people trying to give me a fact before.

1575
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:33,960
I've never become more annoyed by people.

1576
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,960
Just always...

1577
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:40,900
Ok.

1578
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,480
I'm gonna holy water this guy.

1579
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,420
Wait, how do I use it?

1580
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,160
Use it!

1581
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:54,650
Is that it?

1582
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:57,090
Is it done-zo?

1583
01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:58,190
No!

1584
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:18,750
I didn't use it.

1585
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:20,350
Oh, you have to use it close enough.

1586
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:21,190
Oh my god.

1587
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,830
No way.

1588
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:23,730
Ok.

1589
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:26,110
Or...

1590
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:27,970
I think it has a range.

1591
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,490
Of course.

1592
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:34,370
Please.

1593
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:37,050
Oh, I accidentally jumped into the hole.

1594
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:44,030
An accident or a blessing in disguise.

1595
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:53,130
Accident or blessing in disguise.

1596
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,610
Don't go in there.

1597
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,350
It's a trap.

1598
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:01,410
It's not worth it.

1599
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:03,650
Ok.

1600
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,430
I really can't.

1601
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,110
I can't really.

1602
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:06,950
I'm not gonna buy anything though.

1603
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:09,130
I just wanted a little break.

1604
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:14,230
I just wanted a break from this guy.

1605
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:16,090
I hate him.

1606
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:27,050
Ok.

1607
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,210
So, if I use it...

1608
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:31,050
Like when he's right next to me.

1609
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,610
Like now.

1610
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,030
Yes.

1611
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:40,900
Oh my gosh.

1612
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,140
It worked!

1613
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:43,740
Yippee!

1614
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,200
Yippee!

1615
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:47,420
Yay!

1616
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:55,250
Wait, what just broke?

1617
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:56,150
What was that sound?

1618
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,530
Who just arrived?

1619
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:58,410
Who's here?

1620
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:00,710
There's an inscription.

1621
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:04,270
Those without the sign are not worthy to possess the chalice.

1622
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:07,070
Walk the dark path towards the light of sorrow.

1623
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:10,230
The sign is confined in the cage of doom.

1624
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:11,950
Ok.

1625
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:13,370
Oh.

1626
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,790
Maybe...

1627
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:19,470
Oh, maybe it wasn't the sound of something breaking.

1628
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,950
Maybe it was the sound of...

1629
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:23,890
How do I get the blorb?

1630
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:28,330
And the grorb.

1631
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:30,850
Ok.

1632
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:37,030
I thought it was the sound of like glass breaking, but I think it's just my steppy steps.

1633
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,490
This way.

1634
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:40,710
Ok.

1635
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:41,950
There's a lot going on in here.

1636
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:45,390
Can I... Can you grab that?

1637
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:48,230
Do I need to double jump here?

1638
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,450
Alistair's jump attack was also a good choice for that enemy.

1639
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:57,990
The one I don't have.

1640
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,030
Yeah.

1641
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:03,170
Some of this stuff is expensive.

1642
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,130
What's this?

1643
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:05,450
Oh!

1644
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:06,650
Another devil star.

1645
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:07,410
Let's go.

1646
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:09,070
Ok.

1647
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:15,870
Tiny rorb.

1648
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:20,430
Ok.

1649
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:21,130
Over here.

1650
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:25,430
More rorb.

1651
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:27,730
Can I like...

1652
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:28,950
Oh dang.

1653
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:30,250
I thought I could break the glass.

1654
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,520
How do I get inside?

1655
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,500
Not RE4 DMC fact.

1656
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,620
DMC2 Dante is featured in...

1657
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,180
Yeah.

1658
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,460
I know that too.

1659
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,830
Ok.

1660
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:04,270
Maybe...

1661
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:05,470
Let's see.

1662
01:37:05,470 --> 01:37:06,070
Oh!

1663
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:12,530
Is there anything that looks breakable?

1664
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,530
Anything that looks breakable?

1665
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,590
Anything that looks breakable?

1666
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:24,030
See like this glass looks broken.

1667
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:27,130
Just get through there Dante.

1668
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:28,630
You're dumpy.

1669
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:29,470
He's too...

1670
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:30,810
Too thick.

1671
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:32,230
I think.

1672
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:39,610
How about a compromise?

1673
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:45,730
We just give Minto a break from any Devil May Cry facts today.

1674
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,730
For the rest of the day.

1675
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:49,150
How about we do that?

1676
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:51,290
For my own sanity's sake.

1677
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:52,310
If you guys don't mind.

1678
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,930
For my own sanity's sake.

1679
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:07,640
Oh my goodness.

1680
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:10,940
Wait.

1681
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:11,420
Wait.

1682
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,260
This looks...

1683
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:12,800
There we go!

1684
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,780
One full blorb!

1685
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:24,600
Yippee!

1686
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,460
And then there was a green.

1687
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,380
But I guess I... Do I need the green?

1688
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,060
What's my health at?

1689
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,080
Oh we're fine actually.

1690
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:35,100
We don't have to get the other one.

1691
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:36,420
The other grorb.

1692
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,580
How do I... How do I get out?

1693
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:46,960
It was just right over here though, right?

1694
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,900
I don't like leaving things behind.

1695
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,240
It's like... Even if I don't need it, you know?

1696
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,600
It's like the...

1697
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,860
The loot goblin in me.

1698
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:57,880
Blade Kai!

1699
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:58,600
Welcome to membership.

1700
01:38:58,840 --> 01:38:59,260
Thank you!

1701
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,480
Let's see.

1702
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:11,940
Them graphics.

1703
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,340
Aw yeah!

1704
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:18,020
Wait, so is there a little area that I can jump in here?

1705
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,460
Doesn't seem like it.

1706
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:23,380
How do I get in?

1707
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,360
Guys, I need that item.

1708
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,840
I need it right now.

1709
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,480
I need it!

1710
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:35,980
I need that item.

1711
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:37,740
Go underground.

1712
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,260
Below?

1713
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:38,340
Below?

1714
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,880
Oh I see!

1715
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:49,300
Wait.

1716
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,700
Not comboing very well right now.

1717
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,180
Oh no.

1718
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,700
Oh no.

1719
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,620
Oh no.

1720
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,440
Oh no.

1721
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:15,920
Oh no.

1722
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,500
Oh wait, I forgot that I can change it.

1723
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,140
Devil trigger for regular enemies.

1724
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,460
You're so true.

1725
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,340
You're so right.

1726
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,840
Actually, that's so right.

1727
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:48,960
DEVIL TRIGGER!

1728
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:03,590
Oh, who am I shooting at?

1729
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:04,050
I don't know.

1730
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:05,370
It's that guy.

1731
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,720
Destroy.

1732
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,380
More fragments!

1733
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,080
Rorbs!

1734
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,840
And more...and more rorbs.

1735
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,180
And more blue fragments?

1736
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,360
Or what is this?

1737
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,440
Sign of chastity.

1738
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,700
Dante...

1739
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,680
He's so busy fighting demons, he's got nothing else to do.

1740
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,840
I mean rather, he's got no time for anything else.

1741
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:06,360
A taxidermic organ coated by crystal.

1742
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:11,860
Within it is the sign of chastity that's necessary for searching the chalice.

1743
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:13,360
We did it!

1744
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,160
Wait.

1745
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:16,800
Oh wait.

1746
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:23,360
I knew, I knew, I knew you all would be back.

1747
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,220
I knew you all would be back!

1748
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,350
Perform an S-Rank combo!

1749
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,330
Guys, I might be good at this game.

1750
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:50,190
I might be good at this game.

1751
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:51,850
Just saying.

1752
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:53,910
Wait, is this guy still down here?

1753
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:01,520
No, we're okay.

1754
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:13,530
I was gonna say there's nobody down here, right?

1755
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:17,410
I hate that guy that I had to fight before.

1756
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:18,930
I do not want to fight him again.

1757
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:22,090
I really...Oh, I have to get these.

1758
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:23,670
I need the rorbs.

1759
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:26,030
I need them, I need them.

1760
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:26,790
Wait.

1761
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:28,050
Oh, there's a platform up here.

1762
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:28,650
Let's try this.

1763
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:33,190
I need them, I need them, I need them, I need them.

1764
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:37,090
Oh, what's going on?

1765
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:52,150
Nice.

1766
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:54,870
Okay, we got one.

1767
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:58,030
The camera was just like...

1768
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:03,110
Wait.

1769
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:05,210
One more time!

1770
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,610
Got it.

1771
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:09,070
Okay.

1772
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:11,090
Which door is it?

1773
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,610
Is it this one up here?

1774
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:16,910
I guess we shall see.

1775
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:19,990
Before though.

1776
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,230
Serve complete.

1777
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:38,650
Wow, I love being able to tell what's in here.

1778
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:40,470
Is Minty fresh?

1779
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,070
Yes, actually.

1780
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:45,250
Extremely.

1781
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:49,870
I don't care what's behind door number...2!

1782
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:56,890
Is this just downstairs from where I was before?

1783
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:01,830
I think so.

1784
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:03,390
Oh, that's the chalice.

1785
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:05,310
And that's a rorb.

1786
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:07,850
Wait, where did I just jump to?

1787
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:09,130
How did I do that?

1788
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:09,790
Wait, oh.

1789
01:45:10,330 --> 01:45:10,850
Oh, my bad.

1790
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:14,410
This looks like a boss area, I think.

1791
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:17,350
This looks like a boss area.

1792
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:22,630
I feel like every room is a boss area at this point.

1793
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:26,530
There's a cup on the base.

1794
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:28,450
Protected by a powerful light.

1795
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:32,490
Prove yourself worthy with the sign.

1796
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:34,430
Should use the sign of chastity?

1797
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:34,910
Yeah.

1798
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:39,650
I have no brain.

1799
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:40,970
It's a real egg.

1800
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:41,670
Welcome to the membership.

1801
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:42,610
Thank you.

1802
01:45:46,410 --> 01:45:49,970
Chalice, the cup which held the blood of the divine dead.

1803
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:52,370
Delicious...

1804
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,930
That's gonna...

1805
01:45:58,170 --> 01:45:59,270
What's happening?

1806
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:03,690
Sparta?

1807
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:09,760
Retro.

1808
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:11,440
Wait.

1809
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,180
Am I gonna have to fight you?

1810
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,880
Can I have my sword back?

1811
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,700
Oh my gosh.

1812
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,460
I will.

1813
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:31,980
I will use my...

1814
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:34,580
Gun on you too.

1815
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,360
Jump.

1816
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,280
Jump.

1817
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:40,760
Jump.

1818
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:57,860
Oh my gosh, I wasn't aiming.

1819
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,420
So I'm stupid.

1820
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:01,440
Oh my gosh, he hits so crazy.

1821
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,440
Holy moly.

1822
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,560
Oh my gosh, he hits so crazy though.

1823
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:07,680
Shoot.

1824
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,680
And I even took my devil star.

1825
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,100
I took it.

1826
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:01,680
So rude.

1827
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:06,960
Even though I have everything else, but I took my devil star.

1828
01:48:21,210 --> 01:48:23,670
I wonder if I... Should I use my sword here instead?

1829
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:24,110
I wonder.

1830
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,000
Wait a second, I think I missed...

1831
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,440
Oh Johnny, thank you so much for the memberships.

1832
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,500
I totally missed that earlier.

1833
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,140
Thank you.

1834
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,060
Wait, there we go.

1835
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,260
There are some heals in the area.

1836
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:52,560
Are these heals?

1837
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,120
No, they are just decoration.

1838
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,200
Let's see, what's in the...

1839
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,360
Ok, so down here...

1840
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:03,160
We can come down here for some grorb.

1841
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,460
Delicious.

1842
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,920
Everybody needs a grorb.

1843
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,300
And they are balanced.

1844
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,540
Oh, there is one single grorb.

1845
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,680
I wish

1846
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:21,610
I didn't take my star.

1847
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:24,030
I'm so salty about that.

1848
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:29,610
Ah...

1849
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:43,590
Ok.

1850
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:06,180
Oh my gosh, he hits so hard.

1851
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,080
Stinger!

1852
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:09,900
Get stinger!

1853
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:10,880
Get stinger!

1854
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,380
Oh my gosh.

1855
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,620
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1856
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,020
Jump.

1857
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:18,960
Jump.

1858
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,320
Jump.

1859
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:24,300
Jump.

1860
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:42,430
Double... Wait.

1861
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:43,570
Hold on, there we go.

1862
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:46,950
I kept trying, but...

1863
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:50,750
Time for... Oh my gosh, that was such a good timing.

1864
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:51,850
Wait, I can't... There we go.

1865
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:53,610
Where is he?

1866
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:54,350
Hello?

1867
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:57,110
Excuse me.

1868
01:50:58,590 --> 01:50:59,770
I can't suck!

1869
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:00,890
I suck!

1870
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:01,470
No!

1871
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:04,470
Can you come down here or...

1872
01:51:06,890 --> 01:51:08,630
Oh my gosh, what is he doing?

1873
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:09,130
What are you doing?

1874
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:12,470
Wait, why am I in phase 2?

1875
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:13,490
I didn't even...

1876
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:14,710
I got further.

1877
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:19,470
I got further before, but now he is like doing combos and stuff that...

1878
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:23,730
Oh my gosh.

1879
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:25,630
Please.

1880
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:25,810
Please.

1881
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:47,650
Please, can I just have more?

1882
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:50,210
More double trigger.

1883
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:53,330
Can I have a little double trigger as a treat?

1884
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:55,950
Double trigger!

1885
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:57,070
Double trigger!

1886
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:58,150
It's not working!

1887
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:03,090
There we go.

1888
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:05,410
Hit!

1889
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,700
Sparta!

1890
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:27,480
Eat it!

1891
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:28,660
Eat it!

1892
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:30,180
Eat it!

1893
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:37,300
Oh no!

1894
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:41,240
This is Dante's victory jump.

1895
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,740
I got that.

1896
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,220
So what opened...

1897
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,960
Was it the door down here?

1898
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,220
Did someone say the door to darkness?

1899
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:55,940
No.

1900
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,420
OK.

1901
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:03,980
Dante would totally do that.

1902
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:04,600
Yeah, he would.

1903
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,200
You are doing great against these bosses tonight.

1904
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:10,860
Thanks!

1905
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:13,580
Let's save.

1906
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,320
I wish I had more Yorbs.

1907
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,780
I yearn for the Yorb.

1908
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:25,340
I yearn for the Yorb.

1909
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:26,620
I yearn for the Yorb.

1910
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,680
How do I get out of here?

1911
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:33,180
I'm Yorbin'.

1912
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:34,100
Please.

1913
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:35,360
How do I get out of here?

1914
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:52,520
Can I get out?

1915
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:52,940
It's over.

1916
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,240
We beat the game.

1917
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:56,560
Oh wait, I see.

1918
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,180
There we go.

1919
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,400
Wait, what's over here?

1920
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,800
I figured it...

1921
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,240
There was a Gorb there the whole time.

1922
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:11,040
What's my health like?

1923
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,040
Oh we could really use that.

1924
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:14,580
Nice.

1925
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:15,560
OK.

1926
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,360
Alright.

1927
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:22,950
It's a gold statue of a knight.

1928
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:24,690
It looks like something was placed here.

1929
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:26,310
Should I use the chalice?

1930
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:26,690
Yes.

1931
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:30,810
Why put the chalice down there if you are just going to place it right back up here?

1932
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:32,310
What's the point?

1933
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:39,270
Do you like Arona?

1934
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:42,250
Like...

1935
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:45,110
Like...

1936
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:46,690
Blue Archive Arona?

1937
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:47,970
Yeah, she's my favorite character.

1938
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:51,230
Actually, I think we were there...

1939
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:52,390
She showed off a figure.

1940
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:55,350
I'm pretty sure that's the figure she got when we were together.

1941
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:57,870
I took her to the Blue Archive store.

1942
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:02,630
What would a mint colored orb be called?

1943
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:03,050
Oh wait.

1944
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:05,190
Would a mint colored orb be called a Morb?

1945
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:07,230
Yes.

1946
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:11,330
Oh, OK.

1947
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:12,810
Now it's the other door down here.

1948
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:15,870
Did someone say the door to darkness?

1949
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:23,940
Alright.

1950
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,080
Wait,

1951
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,640
I thought this was Sparda.

1952
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,600
This...is...not Sparda?

1953
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,700
Oh, it's not.

1954
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,840
Nelo...Nelo...Nelo Angelo.

1955
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,580
Sparda is your dad?

1956
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:54,180
Yeah, but he looks just like him.

1957
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,240
See?

1958
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:58,540
For cool.

1959
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:00,540
For cool moves.

1960
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:13,740
OK, just because someone says that their dad is dead in a video game or anime or any type of fictional media...

1961
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,120
Never means that it is true.

1962
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,740
Don't spoil the big secret.

1963
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,720
Oh yeah, if there are spoilers...

1964
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,580
Don't tell me.

1965
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:22,260
Don't tell me.

1966
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:28,740
Yeah, just because someone is just like...

1967
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,080
Doesn't mean he is actually dead.

1968
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,980
I've learned from anime and game.

1969
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:39,280
I have.

1970
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:43,820
The real Sparda was the friends we made along the way.

1971
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,260
Yeah, this is my first time playing, so no spoilers everybody.

1972
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,560
Go to the deck and head to the captain's cabin.

1973
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,020
Should I buy stuff?

1974
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,140
Oh, we are so close for the air hike.

1975
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,060
I want it.

1976
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:04,160
Damien, thank you!

1977
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:06,820
Thank you so much for the summertime!

1978
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:09,260
Really appreciate it.

1979
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,600
Did no one tell you Dante's last name was Skywalker?

1980
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,200
Mr. Slider, welcome back!

1981
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:20,020
Just save for air hike.

1982
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:20,200
OK.

1983
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:21,080
I want it.

1984
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:21,560
I want it.

1985
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,160
I want it.

1986
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:24,800
I want it.

1987
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:25,320
I want it.

1988
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:25,900
I want it.

1989
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,900
Alright, go to the deck.

1990
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,240
Mission start!

1991
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:37,560
Oh...

1992
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,880
I will become a ghost here because I'll die so many times.

1993
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,620
The controls are based on the normal mode.

1994
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:07,260
Wait, what's the easy mode then?

1995
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:07,700
I wonder.

1996
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:14,700
Oh no, any like mid 2000's and before...

1997
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,380
Swimming levels are absolute hell.

1998
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:28,020
Any game that had a swimming level in the mid 2000's and prior are just the worst experiences ever.

1999
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:30,760
Nobody likes them.

2000
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:36,660
It turns out Nero Angelo is a big boss who survived Outer Heaven.

2001
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:39,340
This was a doppelganger, not a venom snake.

2002
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:43,580
Wait, am I supposed to... I never learned that name though, right?

2003
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,800
The Nero Angelo?

2004
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:47,140
They never... Nelo?

2005
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,240
Wait, Nelo Angelo?

2006
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,880
Nero... Nelo... Nelo...

2007
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,540
I did.

2008
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,520
When did they tell me?

2009
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:56,820
Nelo.

2010
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:58,360
It's in the menu.

2011
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,260
It's in the menu.

2012
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,580
I set it in a loading screen.

2013
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:06,040
Alright, I gotta concentrate, you guys.

2014
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,380
I gotta read this.

2015
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:14,080
Okay, so whatever check means, but also I can shoot and stuff with the RB.

2016
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:19,340
Y quickly changes the view to the direction that the left stick is being pressed.

2017
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,260
Okay, you cannot use your devil trigger.

2018
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:23,720
And A is to swim.

2019
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,380
I hope I don't have an oxygen meter.

2020
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:32,820
In the same menu as the inventory, you have an enemy...

2021
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:33,560
Enemy?

2022
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:36,060
What is a beast?

2023
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,980
Oh my gosh, Nicholas.

2024
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:43,780
No oxygen meter.

2025
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:44,540
Okay, thank you.

2026
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,500
These trains are always fun to listen to.

2027
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:49,780
Listen in on while I wrap up my shift.

2028
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:50,400
Oh, a dawn!

2029
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:51,280
Thank you!

2030
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:53,700
Good luck with the end of your shift.

2031
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,440
Change directions up, down, but they're inversed.

2032
01:59:58,460 --> 01:59:58,660
Okay.

2033
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,060
You know what?

2034
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:00,840
Let's just go for it.

2035
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:01,700
Let's just...

2036
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:11,610
That was early.

2037
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:19,880
Oh, whoops.

2038
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:22,680
Oh, whoops.

2039
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:25,680
Nice.

2040
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:29,200
Hello.

2041
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:31,180
Hello.

2042
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,020
Too good at this game.

2043
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:49,680
Money,

2044
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:57,410
money, money.

2045
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:02,790
Welcome to the membership!

2046
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:03,570
Thank you!

2047
02:01:04,230 --> 02:01:06,610
Money, money, money.

2048
02:01:06,710 --> 02:01:07,650
How much money did I get?

2049
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:10,310
I wish there was a practice area.

2050
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:16,570
Like here is where you can practice swimming without... with no risk.

2051
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:23,560
Orbeez.

2052
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:28,580
Oh gosh!

2053
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,600
Okay, inversed.

2054
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:32,460
Oh my god.

2055
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,180
That's inversed.

2056
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:40,040
Sorry guys, it's going to take me a second to get used to.

2057
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:41,180
Okay, we can go in here.

2058
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:47,740
Ah!

2059
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:48,480
Ah!

2060
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:48,820
Shoot!

2061
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:50,420
I looked the wrong way!

2062
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:51,320
How do I fight?

2063
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:52,620
My gun!

2064
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:53,800
Wait, where is my gun?

2065
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:54,380
Hello?

2066
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,920
My weapon is not weaponing.

2067
02:01:57,940 --> 02:01:58,380
Shoot!

2068
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,100
I'm trying!

2069
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:02,120
I'm pressing RB and pressing the button, but it's not working.

2070
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:06,320
Maybe I have to have the... this equipped instead?

2071
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:10,800
You don't have a water gun yet.

2072
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:12,160
Wait, what does that mean?

2073
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,180
What are you talking about?

2074
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:13,880
A water gun.

2075
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:17,560
Wait, there is a water gun?

2076
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:18,600
Oh my god.

2077
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,580
Get me out of here.

2078
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,160
You need a special gun?

2079
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:24,180
What?

2080
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:35,420
Is there anything up here perhaps that I can peruse before I venture into this horrible landscape?

2081
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:36,300
That is.

2082
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:41,140
Come on, let me check out the pirate show.

2083
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:42,560
No?

2084
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:44,560
Okay.

2085
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:50,220
Okay, just swim past him.

2086
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:51,340
Okay.

2087
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,660
Damn lizard people.

2088
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:02,800
Swim up after you enter the ship.

2089
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:03,400
Okay, thank you.

2090
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,920
I don't like this.

2091
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:15,900
Okay, I'm gonna equip my other gun for now again.

2092
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:17,780
Yes.

2093
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:21,080
Okay.

2094
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,040
Can I get him from in the water?

2095
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:23,560
No?

2096
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,280
What is that?

2097
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,600
What's that sound?

2098
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:34,920
There is nothing in the treasure box except seashells.

2099
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:36,720
What if I bust it open?

2100
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:43,460
The only underwater level I could ever tolerate was Ninja Gaiden 2 just because it gave you a Gatlin harpoon for defense.

2101
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,680
Only worked underwater.

2102
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:46,800
That, yeah.

2103
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:51,060
That would make it more tolerable, I believe.

2104
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,080
I... remember just...

2105
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:57,880
Oh my gosh!

2106
02:03:58,020 --> 02:03:58,860
Oh my gosh!

2107
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:02,740
Give me a second to...

2108
02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:09,470
Oops.

2109
02:04:10,090 --> 02:04:11,950
Now I'm gonna have to redo this again.

2110
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:13,350
No!

2111
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:23,960
Absolute!

2112
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,820
Perform an S-Rank combo using Alistair!

2113
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,700
Guys, I'm killing it!

2114
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:39,660
I'm killing it!

2115
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:40,680
Yippee!

2116
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:44,740
Water gun.

2117
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:47,300
Needle gun.

2118
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,800
Only weapon that can be used underwater.

2119
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,760
Thank you.

2120
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:56,580
Oh wait, will it... I guess I'll equip it when I'm down there.

2121
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,340
What's in here?

2122
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,180
Oh, I didn't.

2123
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:05,120
Nothing's in here, I guess.

2124
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:09,460
It will auto equip?

2125
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,400
Oh, ok, perfect.

2126
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:11,200
Thanks guys!

2127
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:12,820
Thanks for always helping me out.

2128
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,260
This looks like it'd be turnable, doesn't it?

2129
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,120
Like, for some reason the way it's...

2130
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:20,320
It looks like it's turnable.

2131
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,180
Is this a room?

2132
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:26,380
Guys, I need to use the little ghostie's room.

2133
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,040
Swimming with Minto makes the jank controls okay!

2134
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:33,900
I have to use the little ghostie's room.

2135
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,360
Please forgive me.

2136
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:37,340
Do you forgive me?

2137
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,060
Do you forgive Minto?

2138
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:44,980
Ok, yeah.

2139
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:46,120
Remember to wash your hands.

2140
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,060
I always wash my hands.

2141
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:50,480
I'm not... I'm not like another bug.

2142
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,480
Oh, Elfriede!

2143
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:58,540
I'm so sorry, I missed your donut earlier.

2144
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:02,740
You have now unsubscribed from Devil May Cry Fun Facts.

2145
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,260
You have now subscribed to Metal Gear Fun Facts.

2146
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:09,900
Did you know that Meryl technically originally appeared in Police Nights?

2147
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:13,080
It's so funny.

2148
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,020
I love it though.

2149
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:18,860
I love when people tag me in stuff on Twitter.

2150
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,380
I get so many tags from people.

2151
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:24,500
Like recently they announced Gengar headphones.

2152
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:29,460
I got maybe like 15 tags from people.

2153
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:31,720
But I don't mind it.

2154
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:35,680
I know, sorry, I got a little snippy earlier with the facts.

2155
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,460
It's just, you know, I was like, so sick of seeing it.

2156
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:46,320
But for other things, you know, I just know you guys are excited and excitable about wanting to share things about the game.

2157
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:49,520
And people will tag me in stuff about Metal Gear.

2158
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:56,540
And, you know, even if I've seen it, it's just, you know, I'm like, you guys are thinking of me.

2159
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:06,540
Even if you think that I've seen something before, like at least on Twitter or whatever, you can feel free to tag me or whatever.

2160
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,920
If you're just like, oh my gosh, Minto would like these Gengar headphones.

2161
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:10,800
I would.

2162
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:14,860
Every time I saw them, I was like, they're so cute.

2163
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:20,500
But it was funny and 100% warranted.

2164
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:27,560
But yeah, it's so funny because sometimes people will be like, did you know this Metal Gear thing?

2165
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:30,240
And sometimes I don't know, there's not, you know, I don't know everything.

2166
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,840
But at this point, I think I know a lot of stuff.

2167
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:36,860
Did you know this game was originally gonna be MGS4?

2168
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:38,700
Thank God it wasn't.

2169
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:42,400
You can beat us up sometimes too.

2170
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:43,140
Oh, I will.

2171
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:43,920
I do.

2172
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:49,660
I wonder how many tagged you for that big boss grave saluting statue.

2173
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:50,980
A lot.

2174
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:52,640
A lot.

2175
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:55,040
A lot.

2176
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:57,680
A lot.

2177
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:05,240
But also sometimes I'll learn something and then I forget about it.

2178
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:10,080
And then someone will tell me again and I'll be like, oh yeah, that's such a cool fact and I forgot about it.

2179
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:13,740
I don't think I'll ever forget though that this game was supposed to be Resident Evil 4 though.

2180
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:15,700
Never.

2181
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:22,500
I'll be seeing the light, like going to heaven.

2182
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:31,480
I'll be like, oh my gosh, I've fulfilled all my...

2183
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:33,800
Gosh, I forgot ghost terminology.

2184
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,480
The things that I wanted...

2185
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,700
What's the word?

2186
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:44,840
The things that keep me here.

2187
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,640
Unfinished business.

2188
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:51,160
Yeah, oh my gosh, I was just watching Casper the other day too.

2189
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:54,840
I've finished all my unfinished business.

2190
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,880
It's time that I can see the light.

2191
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:59,040
I can move on.

2192
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:06,360
And then right before... When I'm seeing my afterlife flash before my eyes...

2193
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,160
The last thing that I see will be...

2194
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:15,000
DMC was supposed to be Resident Evil 4.

2195
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:16,500
Dies.

2196
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,340
Well, not dies, goes to heaven.

2197
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:25,360
The live action Casper?

2198
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:25,800
Yeah!

2199
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:29,060
You know how like... Oh my gosh, it's kind of messed up.

2200
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,680
What do you mean fake ghost?

2201
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,460
I'm a real ghost.

2202
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:36,440
Thank you.

2203
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:38,860
Thank you for the prank.

2204
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:42,380
Yeah, and like the Casper live action is kind of messed up.

2205
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:48,580
They create the machine that can turn ghosts back into humans and then they're going to use it on Casper.

2206
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:53,580
And then there's the lady that's just like, I turned myself into a ghost and I'm going to become all powerful.

2207
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:56,480
But she doesn't know about the unfinished business.

2208
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:59,340
And then they're like, what about your unfinished business?

2209
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:00,980
If you're a ghost, what's your unfinished business?

2210
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,220
And she's just like, what?

2211
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:03,440
I have no unfinished business.

2212
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:04,440
And then she's like, blah!

2213
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:06,100
And she gets sucked into the light.

2214
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:06,720
And she's like, no!

2215
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:07,780
You guys tricked me!

2216
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:14,880
And then the girl's dad is a ghost and I'm like, that just means that he died.

2217
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:20,360
And they had to use the machine to make him human again.

2218
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,520
I'm like, this is so sad for Casper.

2219
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:24,540
That movie was so weird.

2220
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:25,840
It was really weird.

2221
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:29,680
Did you have a crush on Casper as a kid?

2222
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:32,500
I don't think so.

2223
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:34,520
I don't remember.

2224
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:38,880
It's kind of... I don't know.

2225
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:40,880
It's like weird.

2226
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:41,380
I don't know.

2227
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,080
I don't know.

2228
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:50,000
Is it supposed to be not an okaeri nasaimase?

2229
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:50,800
Yeah.

2230
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:53,120
Yeah.

2231
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:54,560
Okaeri nasaimase.

2232
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:54,640
Okay.

2233
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:06,240
I genuinely thought you were going to say that the last thing you would ever see was going to be DMCA.

2234
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:09,040
Which is most YouTube channels last night.

2235
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:16,720
So many of my streams will become non-monetized because of some arbitrary song in it.

2236
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:25,600
I even lowered the volume for Way to Fall when I finished MGS3 and it still got copyright claimed.

2237
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:29,620
Or just sometimes it picks on stuff.

2238
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:30,320
But it's okay.

2239
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:31,540
It's just ad revenues.

2240
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:32,020
Whatever.

2241
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,200
Unfinished business.

2242
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:35,700
Big boss rank MGS2.

2243
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:37,380
At least that will be mine.

2244
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:39,200
I salute you.

2245
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:40,760
For real?

2246
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:41,220
Yeah.

2247
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:42,200
It's okay.

2248
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:44,780
It's fine.

2249
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:49,800
So...

2250
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,360
I remember that movie.

2251
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:54,480
The scene where he dances with the main girl and he's alive.

2252
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:56,600
I remember thinking, wow, he was pretty handsome before he died.

2253
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:01,780
I keep seeing these TikToks of kids nowadays watching Casper.

2254
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:06,780
And their reactions to seeing human Casper.

2255
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:07,800
And it's so cute!

2256
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:08,780
But I'm like...

2257
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:12,940
I'm like...

2258
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:15,820
I feel like I look better as a ghost.

2259
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:18,760
I don't wanna...

2260
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:22,300
I mean, sorry, Casper was like an egg, but that's not me.

2261
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:26,440
I'm like...

2262
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:28,120
I don't... I... I...

2263
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,380
I look better as a ghost.

2264
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,420
I don't need to be human.

2265
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:33,500
I think.

2266
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:36,820
You're also anime.

2267
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:38,880
Casper was animated too!

2268
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,960
You're not an egg.

2269
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:45,980
You guys...

2270
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:48,280
With my...

2271
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,800
With my...

2272
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:51,580
With my...

2273
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:53,540
New form coming.

2274
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:57,180
My...

2275
02:12:57,600 --> 02:12:58,600
My rigor.

2276
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,700
They were like...

2277
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:03,400
Hey, here's a test.

2278
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,280
And... Oh, sorry.

2279
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:09,880
I also left it so you could be bald.

2280
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:13,060
And I'm like, should I...

2281
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:15,600
Should I ask them to keep it?

2282
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:18,040
Would you guys want to see a bald...

2283
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,920
I could actually look like Casper.

2284
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:27,060
Yes?

2285
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:35,100
That was a good one, Alizora.

2286
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,140
Bald, you want to see?

2287
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:39,960
I'll probably never use it ever.

2288
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:47,020
The difference between you and Casper is Casper is a friendly ghost.

2289
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:50,620
I'm pretty friendly.

2290
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:54,500
I'm pretty friendly.

2291
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:00,340
I'm doing that thing where like, you know...

2292
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:03,120
That girly thing where you flutter your eyelashes.

2293
02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:06,500
Is it working?

2294
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:09,660
Okay, let me go to the bathroom.

2295
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:09,940
I'll be right back.

2296
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,940
Gone version.

2297
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:14,400
BRB.

2298
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:16,960
Oh, it's all the way up there.

2299
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:19,880
BRB.

2300
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:21,100
I'll be fast.

2301
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:26,460
I'm back!

2302
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:35,600
Cool to see Mint get a stylish combo.

2303
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:37,320
Two times today!

2304
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:41,980
For you guys, I got it first with the...

2305
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,200
The...

2306
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,060
The thing.

2307
02:16:45,380 --> 02:16:45,820
I can't remember.

2308
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:47,240
The thing!

2309
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,100
What was it?

2310
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:49,820
Oh my gosh.

2311
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:52,920
What was it?

2312
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:57,920
I got... No, my fists.

2313
02:16:58,100 --> 02:16:59,080
My fists, my fists.

2314
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:03,860
Minto Gaming.

2315
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:04,400
Alright.

2316
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:07,920
Let's continue.

2317
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:13,900
I do want to check up here real quick.

2318
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:16,320
Even though we'll have to fight the guys again.

2319
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:18,660
I guess that's... Oh wait, what's this?

2320
02:17:24,420 --> 02:17:25,680
Oh, we're up top!

2321
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:27,500
Wow!

2322
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:29,980
This is so exciting.

2323
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,760
I love... Oh my gosh, ghost ships are so cool.

2324
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:34,480
What is this?

2325
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:35,920
What is this thing anyway?

2326
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:38,640
Oh, this is where the fire of the spirit is lit.

2327
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,860
But right now it's sealed and can't be lit.

2328
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:43,100
The One Piece.

2329
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:49,810
I guess we'll come back here.

2330
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:50,450
I mean, obviously.

2331
02:17:51,590 --> 02:17:52,750
The sword... Wait!

2332
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:54,430
It's locked shut.

2333
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:55,410
There's something written.

2334
02:17:55,610 --> 02:18:00,250
I am the ship that carries the wandering souls on the brink of the underworld.

2335
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:01,250
Yarg!

2336
02:18:01,490 --> 02:18:05,730
Protect the ship and you shall be given the fire of Saint Elmo!

2337
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:11,470
No way!

2338
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:13,970
Oh no, no, no.

2339
02:18:14,730 --> 02:18:15,130
Bye!

2340
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,120
Where are they?

2341
02:18:37,410 --> 02:18:38,210
You exited.

2342
02:18:38,330 --> 02:18:39,370
Yeah, on purpose.

2343
02:18:41,730 --> 02:18:42,350
Hell no!

2344
02:18:42,450 --> 02:18:46,170
Am I gonna fight that guy and then have to do it again?

2345
02:18:46,590 --> 02:18:46,870
Wait.

2346
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:49,630
Like I have to go back down here, do I not?

2347
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:53,710
Do I not have to go back down here, right?

2348
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,080
I think I killed him.

2349
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:17,600
I mean, I figured since I had to kill him, right?

2350
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:21,780
Maybe I don't have to go back down here.

2351
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:26,160
What was the point of getting the gun if I don't have to come back down here?

2352
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:32,880
Wait, what was the point of getting the gun and...

2353
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:33,040
What?

2354
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:34,200
Huh?

2355
02:19:36,060 --> 02:19:36,600
Later?

2356
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:37,260
Okay.

2357
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:39,900
Oh, for later.

2358
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:41,860
Next mission there is more swimming!

2359
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:43,400
And me.

2360
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:45,000
And me.

2361
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:01,820
We got him.

2362
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:04,800
I have to fight him?

2363
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,820
Aw man.

2364
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:08,300
Aw man.

2365
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:10,800
Okay.

2366
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:15,240
Here...

2367
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:19,420
Air attack on Ifrit is pretty good against the Scythe guy if I remember correctly.

2368
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:22,080
Use Ifrit's jump kick on the boss on the deck.

2369
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:23,380
Do I?

2370
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,360
Oh, I have the jump kick.

2371
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:28,160
Jump kick was... Wait.

2372
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:32,280
Jump kick was... Hold on.

2373
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:34,340
Let's practice.

2374
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:36,240
It was...

2375
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:38,560
Oh, wait.

2376
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:40,600
Like, wait.

2377
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:41,160
Oh, jump.

2378
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:42,720
Oh, that?

2379
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:44,880
That?

2380
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:55,700
Death Scythe is easier than his cousin Death Scissors.

2381
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:57,820
I hate all of them.

2382
02:20:59,680 --> 02:20:59,940
Okay.

2383
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:06,080
That's the one.

2384
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:06,640
Okay.

2385
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:11,140
If he'll come down here...

2386
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:21,250
It's the only move I got!

2387
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:23,490
It's the only move I got!

2388
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:24,410
Oh, wait.

2389
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:35,680
Where is he?

2390
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:35,940
Oh.

2391
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:37,200
It's the only

2392
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:43,600
move I... It's the only move I got!

2393
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:44,260
Oh, come on.

2394
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:44,980
Over here please.

2395
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:49,140
Oh, we did it!

2396
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:51,180
You guys!

2397
02:21:57,580 --> 02:21:59,480
What was that crashing sound?

2398
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:02,460
What was that?

2399
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,560
Who broke something?

2400
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:06,660
It wasn't me.

2401
02:22:07,420 --> 02:22:08,380
Who broke something?

2402
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:10,280
Wow, this ship is huge.

2403
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:15,140
Nice.

2404
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:18,120
Oh gosh.

2405
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:18,920
Oh golly.

2406
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:20,500
I'm walking the plank.

2407
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:22,480
Why did I say it with that accent?

2408
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:23,220
I don't know.

2409
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:25,220
Wait.

2410
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:27,340
Oh, dang it.

2411
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:32,220
I want to go to the... Oh my gosh, I can see a little orb all the way over there.

2412
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:33,640
Protect the ship.

2413
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:42,880
Okay.

2414
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:45,640
Maybe from this side it will be better.

2415
02:22:47,620 --> 02:22:48,120
Okay.

2416
02:22:48,940 --> 02:22:50,400
All the way to the tippy top.

2417
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,260
Oh my gosh, there is even things here.

2418
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:56,400
Wait, I can't see anything.

2419
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:58,740
Is that orb near or far?

2420
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:02,100
Well, at least we know there is a thing up here.

2421
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:08,570
Oh, I think I got water on my dress.

2422
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:10,490
I was like, what?

2423
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:12,190
What is that feeling?

2424
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:21,690
Near... far... I can't tell at all.

2425
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:23,950
This is the spirit thing.

2426
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:26,530
Right now it's sealed and can't be lit.

2427
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:26,870
Okay.

2428
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:34,600
I can't tell...

2429
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:38,840
Oh, thank goodness.

2430
02:23:39,340 --> 02:23:41,360
My heart sunk for a second.

2431
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:43,160
I was like, what if there is fall damage?

2432
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:46,720
Wait, can I go to the tippy top here?

2433
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:51,410
Okay.

2434
02:23:56,690 --> 02:23:58,230
Kingdom hearts as run.

2435
02:24:01,810 --> 02:24:03,710
Fall damage in a DMC game.

2436
02:24:03,810 --> 02:24:05,310
I don't know.

2437
02:24:05,650 --> 02:24:06,810
I don't know anything.

2438
02:24:07,810 --> 02:24:08,490
Okay.

2439
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:16,060
Let's try the other... Oh, let's try... Oh my goodness.

2440
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:17,200
Okay.

2441
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:19,560
How do I... Oh.

2442
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:21,900
Okay, we got that.

2443
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:22,340
Nice.

2444
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:23,060
Very cool.

2445
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:24,200
Very good.

2446
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:25,840
And up.

2447
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:29,160
Oh, he used the ladder.

2448
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:32,850
Up.

2449
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:33,730
Nice.

2450
02:24:37,130 --> 02:24:37,810
Nice.

2451
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:42,270
Tiny Rorb.

2452
02:24:43,390 --> 02:24:44,810
Do it for the Rorb.

2453
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:48,550
Did I ever stream Kingdom Hearts?

2454
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:48,910
No.

2455
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:54,510
I just played it a lot as a kid.

2456
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:58,810
Like an obscene amount I played that game.

2457
02:24:59,810 --> 02:25:01,470
So I always reference it.

2458
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:15,900
Oh gosh.

2459
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:18,840
Sorry, I keep referencing it today.

2460
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:19,960
I don't know why.

2461
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:23,800
I guess I'm in just a Kingdom Hearts mood or something.

2462
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:26,220
Oh, there we go.

2463
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:29,340
Is that...

2464
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:32,460
Is that all of them?

2465
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:35,480
I don't feel like I got all of them.

2466
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:36,580
Wait, oh.

2467
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:38,540
Oh my gosh, there is some on the little tips.

2468
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:38,960
No.

2469
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,320
You guys, I have to get them.

2470
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,320
I won't feel complete otherwise.

2471
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:45,400
Ok, over here.

2472
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,500
Do it for the one Rorb.

2473
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:52,020
Do it for the one Rorb.

2474
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:55,760
Was there anything else to do here?

2475
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:02,000
Or rather, anything else to loot?

2476
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:03,760
Did I get all the stuff?

2477
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:05,080
I think I did.

2478
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:08,320
I think we are good.

2479
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,080
One Rorb.

2480
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:14,140
What if I just jumped here?

2481
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:18,020
Ok.

2482
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:19,500
Alright.

2483
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:21,000
I think you got it.

2484
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:24,820
Where is that one?

2485
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:28,440
You sneaky.

2486
02:26:29,580 --> 02:26:33,580
Speaking of Kingdom Hearts and underwater levels, at least we know this level could be worse.

2487
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:34,700
So true.

2488
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:41,080
The one Rorb is real.

2489
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:44,360
The one Rorb is real.

2490
02:26:50,820 --> 02:26:51,920
One Rorb.

2491
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:54,660
One, one, one Rorb.

2492
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:55,900
Is this next?

2493
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:57,300
It's the next one, I think.

2494
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:05,420
I got this one.

2495
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:07,000
Wait, where is it?

2496
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,000
Eh?

2497
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:13,600
Eh?

2498
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:18,140
Nice.

2499
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:22,660
It's on the lower pole.

2500
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,900
I thought that's where I got the other one though.

2501
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:27,980
Is it here?

2502
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,280
No.

2503
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:31,600
Wait, one more down?

2504
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:32,320
No.

2505
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,900
Oh, like maybe all the way down?

2506
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:41,440
Where the hell is this Rorb?

2507
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:43,220
Guys, there is no other pole.

2508
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:45,620
The tip of the spike.

2509
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:47,260
Wait, do I go up here?

2510
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:51,980
There is no spike.

2511
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,640
I went on the middle pole.

2512
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,460
This one...guys, I've been here three times.

2513
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:03,540
Unless I jump.

2514
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:12,090
The middle, middle.

2515
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:14,770
This one over here.

2516
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:23,210
I understand.

2517
02:28:27,630 --> 02:28:28,330
What?

2518
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:33,770
Secret Rorbs.

2519
02:28:35,310 --> 02:28:37,590
Wait, is it up higher?

2520
02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:40,010
Can we get much higher?

2521
02:28:41,650 --> 02:28:42,290
Ok.

2522
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:44,430
That has to be all of them.

2523
02:28:44,830 --> 02:28:46,350
Otherwise I'm insane.

2524
02:28:46,930 --> 02:28:49,410
Otherwise I'm gonna actually become the Joker.

2525
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:55,350
Ok.

2526
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:57,050
We got them all.

2527
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:57,650
We got them all.

2528
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:57,870
Ok.

2529
02:28:58,410 --> 02:28:59,730
Ok, I'm leaving.

2530
02:28:59,890 --> 02:29:00,210
I'm leaving.

2531
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:00,950
Sorry guys.

2532
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:03,370
My loot instincts.

2533
02:29:04,970 --> 02:29:06,750
Every Rorb counts, ok?

2534
02:29:11,670 --> 02:29:13,930
I thought I was gonna have to do that.

2535
02:29:14,710 --> 02:29:15,370
Lucky me.

2536
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:18,490
Are we going to the underworld?

2537
02:29:20,290 --> 02:29:21,210
Oh my gosh.

2538
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:22,430
Dante, hold on!

2539
02:29:22,750 --> 02:29:24,030
Dante, hold on!

2540
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:24,730
Oh my god.

2541
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:34,700
Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.

2542
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:37,440
Shubat!

2543
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,240
Yeah, oh my gosh.

2544
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:43,200
The one piece happening right now.

2545
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:45,960
Is this ship sturdy?

2546
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,700
Ok, we're leaving the castle.

2547
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:52,060
Bye!

2548
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,400
Oh no, no, no.

2549
02:29:57,780 --> 02:29:59,040
No, no ambush.

2550
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:02,980
Oh, this is messed up.

2551
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:08,720
Don't blow up my...

2552
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:09,200
No!

2553
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:14,460
Ok, wait.

2554
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:19,180
Wait, I messed up.

2555
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:20,960
This is the one I want.

2556
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:21,900
Oh my gosh.

2557
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,320
Wait, oh my gosh.

2558
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:28,040
Oh my gosh.

2559
02:30:28,380 --> 02:30:29,880
What is happening?

2560
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:33,700
What is going on?

2561
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:36,020
Oh, what the hell?

2562
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:39,180
What is going on?

2563
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:41,320
What is happening actually?

2564
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,280
What is going on?

2565
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,000
I can't tell at all.

2566
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:47,200
What is happening?

2567
02:30:52,470 --> 02:30:53,930
Please, I can't see anything.

2568
02:30:55,050 --> 02:30:56,950
This angle is horrible, horrid.

2569
02:30:58,070 --> 02:30:58,950
Horrid and rude.

2570
02:31:02,210 --> 02:31:04,050
Switch back to ebony and ivory.

2571
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:05,490
No, I think it's ok.

2572
02:31:08,610 --> 02:31:10,370
What is this thing though?

2573
02:31:10,830 --> 02:31:11,590
Do I shoot it?

2574
02:31:11,970 --> 02:31:12,790
Do I kill it?

2575
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:15,670
Maybe I do.

2576
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:16,310
Ok, hold on.

2577
02:31:16,990 --> 02:31:17,910
Wait, hold on, hold on.

2578
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:20,290
Hold on, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2579
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:21,330
Ok, ok, ok.

2580
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,080
I don't...

2581
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:35,380
Oh, I jumped, I jumped, but it didn't really...

2582
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:36,860
Oh my gosh.

2583
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:37,720
Oh my gosh.

2584
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:38,840
Oh, I don't like this.

2585
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:40,860
You guys, this is really... I hate this.

2586
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:43,540
Why are all these fights getting so bad?

2587
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:45,860
All these fights are getting so mean!

2588
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:47,860
What is going on?

2589
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:01,660
I'm not even doing anything.

2590
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,220
This is useless.

2591
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:06,760
So useless.

2592
02:32:08,980 --> 02:32:09,940
Oh my god.

2593
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:22,320
Ouch.

2594
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:22,900
Why?

2595
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:24,440
Why am I dying?

2596
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:25,880
Ouch.

2597
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:31,060
No, please, I just had a good angle.

2598
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:34,800
Stop hurting me!

2599
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,020
How do I stop this thing?

2600
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:38,200
I went off.

2601
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:40,540
I went off the ride!

2602
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:42,080
I don't like this ride!

2603
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:45,520
Please!

2604
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:49,000
Oh my god.

2605
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:49,380
No, no.

2606
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:49,960
Oh no.

2607
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:51,600
Oh no, no, no.

2608
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:53,580
Oh no, no, no.

2609
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:01,930
Devil, devil, devil trigger!

2610
02:33:02,150 --> 02:33:02,590
Devil trigger!

2611
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:03,990
Ok, that's not enough.

2612
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:06,290
That's not enough, I think.

2613
02:33:07,330 --> 02:33:08,230
Oh, there we go.

2614
02:33:12,830 --> 02:33:13,950
Just destroy.

2615
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:14,790
Just go!

2616
02:33:14,890 --> 02:33:15,590
Dante, just go!

2617
02:33:15,730 --> 02:33:15,910
Dante!

2618
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:24,960
Oh my god.

2619
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:25,820
No.

2620
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:27,200
No, no, please.

2621
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:28,460
Oh my god.

2622
02:33:35,030 --> 02:33:37,330
Guys, I think I'm in trouble.

2623
02:33:38,090 --> 02:33:38,650
Guys.

2624
02:33:48,050 --> 02:33:48,650
Literally...

2625
02:33:48,650 --> 02:33:49,570
1 HP.

2626
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:01,660
Oh, let's go to the door.

2627
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:04,200
Oh my god.

2628
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:16,320
Fight Griffin a second time and prevail.

2629
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:17,280
Thanks.

2630
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:18,400
I don't know.

2631
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:19,680
B rank!

2632
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,680
B for barely made it.

2633
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:25,520
Oh my gosh.

2634
02:34:26,180 --> 02:34:27,080
Thank you, Garlamald!

2635
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:28,680
I just saw your Akatono earlier.

2636
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:29,500
Add revenue.

2637
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:30,020
No!

2638
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:31,040
Thank you!

2639
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:33,140
I don't need add revenue.

2640
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:35,420
Collect 10,000 red orbs!

2641
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:35,820
Yippee!

2642
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:38,940
Wait a second.

2643
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:39,520
No.

2644
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:44,220
Let's do this one, because if I have just 1 HP...

2645
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:45,320
I'm gonna be in trouble.

2646
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:47,860
Next mission!

2647
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:50,640
Mission 13.

2648
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:54,200
Find an exit and escape from the ship.

2649
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:55,740
Okay.

2650
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:00,580
Yeah, we saved the orb.

2651
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:01,120
So true.

2652
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:07,380
Oh wait!

2653
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:08,410
I forgot to...

2654
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:12,400
I can get air hike!

2655
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:16,200
Let's get air hike!

2656
02:35:16,460 --> 02:35:17,420
Double jump, baby!

2657
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:23,360
Who are you?

2658
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,440
Who are you?

2659
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:28,440
Who are you?

2660
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:28,800
Wait.

2661
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:29,600
Who is this?

2662
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:31,780
Wow!

2663
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:32,440
I wanna talk to...

2664
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:33,920
Oh, it's a skeleton of the captain.

2665
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:37,760
Strangely, it appears as though there is a slight smile on his expression.

2666
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:39,480
Dante, that's a skeleton.

2667
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:40,900
It's a logbook.

2668
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:41,920
Exciting.

2669
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:44,960
Okay, Dante.

2670
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:46,820
We don't need your sass.

2671
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:49,420
Oh, smiley?

2672
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:49,840
Thank you.

2673
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:50,960
No spoilers, guys.

2674
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:51,440
No spoilers.

2675
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:54,120
Staff of Hermes.

2676
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:58,020
It's decorated with two snakes coiled onto the staff.

2677
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,080
Is this timed?

2678
02:36:11,310 --> 02:36:13,290
Wait, I can breathe underwater.

2679
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:17,090
Exciting.

2680
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:23,850
And I have... Wait, I just got double... Oh, we're sinking.

2681
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:30,590
Sorry, I didn't mean to destroy your ship or anything.

2682
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:37,190
Hey, buddy.

2683
02:36:39,410 --> 02:36:40,970
Why is this music like this?

2684
02:36:42,170 --> 02:36:44,290
It's making me feel a little stressed.

2685
02:36:44,530 --> 02:36:45,830
Why is it so excitable?

2686
02:36:50,010 --> 02:36:50,970
Is this...

2687
02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:52,030
Dude...

2688
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:54,650
Oh my gosh.

2689
02:36:55,270 --> 02:36:56,470
The guy and his baby.

2690
02:36:59,570 --> 02:37:01,030
Okay, I guess I'm going.

2691
02:37:02,630 --> 02:37:04,870
Hold on, I'm just gonna...

2692
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:06,870
Water pressure is too strong and it won't open.

2693
02:37:07,550 --> 02:37:09,050
There's got to be another way out.

2694
02:37:11,350 --> 02:37:14,910
Sorry, man.

2695
02:37:15,310 --> 02:37:16,330
Oh, the windows.

2696
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:19,310
Windows are always a good way out.

2697
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:19,810
Just kidding.

2698
02:37:25,770 --> 02:37:27,210
I'm looking, guys.

2699
02:37:27,290 --> 02:37:27,990
I'm looking.

2700
02:37:29,610 --> 02:37:30,450
Let's see.

2701
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:33,890
These decorations are so awesome.

2702
02:37:34,990 --> 02:37:36,050
Let's see.

2703
02:37:36,890 --> 02:37:38,210
Are we venting?

2704
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:40,110
Oh, I see it.

2705
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:44,370
I'll be honest, I thought that was a fireplace.

2706
02:37:45,910 --> 02:37:47,130
I think

2707
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:53,890
I'm not very good at aiming.

2708
02:38:06,310 --> 02:38:07,550
Here I go.

2709
02:38:09,170 --> 02:38:09,890
Traveling forward.

2710
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:19,010
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2711
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:22,370
Oh, I killed him.

2712
02:38:22,630 --> 02:38:22,810
Nice.

2713
02:38:22,990 --> 02:38:23,510
Oh my god, no.

2714
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:29,560
Okay, we did it?

2715
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:39,160
Okay, cool.

2716
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:41,140
Anything else exciting in here?

2717
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:41,560
Anything?

2718
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:42,580
Oh, come on.

2719
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:43,120
I want to check.

2720
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:44,040
Stop, stop, stop.

2721
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:45,100
Stop, stop, Dante.

2722
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:47,040
I want to check this treasure chest.

2723
02:38:48,540 --> 02:38:48,900
See?

2724
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:50,040
Check the treasure chest.

2725
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:51,640
Check the treasure chest.

2726
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:53,540
Is there a guy downstairs?

2727
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:55,840
Was it...

2728
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,180
Which thing opened?

2729
02:38:58,380 --> 02:38:58,980
The one over here?

2730
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:01,040
I believe.

2731
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:03,220
This one?

2732
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:04,280
Did this one open?

2733
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:08,480
Or was it this one down here?

2734
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:11,840
I don't know.

2735
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:18,000
I'm in hell.

2736
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:24,800
Try both.

2737
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:27,960
Please!

2738
02:39:52,090 --> 02:39:52,490
Please!

2739
02:39:52,950 --> 02:39:54,070
Why can't I see you guys?

2740
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:55,550
Oh my god, please.

2741
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:58,770
Oh my god, why is it turning that way?

2742
02:39:59,070 --> 02:40:01,150
I don't understand this mechanic at all.

2743
02:40:01,570 --> 02:40:02,230
Oh my gosh, please.

2744
02:40:02,590 --> 02:40:04,750
Oh my god, it's right behind me, isn't it?

2745
02:40:07,210 --> 02:40:07,610
No!

2746
02:40:07,930 --> 02:40:08,310
No!

2747
02:40:08,730 --> 02:40:09,130
No!

2748
02:40:09,390 --> 02:40:10,250
Oh my god, no!

2749
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:11,290
I don't know where I'm going.

2750
02:40:11,290 --> 02:40:14,170
I think I'm...

2751
02:40:14,170 --> 02:40:14,870
Leaving.

2752
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:28,150
Why do I have to press Y to change my face direction?

2753
02:40:28,790 --> 02:40:29,390
It's horrible.

2754
02:40:32,650 --> 02:40:34,030
B for...

2755
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:35,850
Better get out of there.

2756
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:40,650
This is so silly.

2757
02:40:43,010 --> 02:40:46,510
Oh my gosh, that was episode... Sorry, mission 13.

2758
02:40:46,890 --> 02:40:47,550
Good job, Minto.

2759
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:48,330
Thanks, Rudy.

2760
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:49,510
Thanks for a whole month.

2761
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:51,530
B for bullshit.

2762
02:40:51,830 --> 02:40:52,710
So true.

2763
02:40:55,130 --> 02:40:57,830
Oh man, B for busted camera controls.

2764
02:40:57,970 --> 02:40:58,750
So true!

2765
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:00,490
B for boingy boof.

2766
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:03,450
And that, my friends, is definitely the answer.

2767
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:04,290
Boingy boof.

2768
02:41:05,410 --> 02:41:05,790
So what?

2769
02:41:05,870 --> 02:41:07,010
We're at...

2770
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:09,970
We have less than...

2771
02:41:09,970 --> 02:41:11,610
We're over halfway.

2772
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:15,430
Oh, I guess from last mission we were over halfway, huh?

2773
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:21,270
So...

2774
02:41:22,130 --> 02:41:22,810
Let's save.

2775
02:41:22,850 --> 02:41:23,750
Oh wait, did I just save?

2776
02:41:25,190 --> 02:41:26,030
Oops, whatever.

2777
02:41:26,450 --> 02:41:27,150
Next mission!

2778
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:29,410
Great progress.

2779
02:41:29,710 --> 02:41:31,010
Oh, no, there's more?

2780
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:40,340
They're like, hey, don't you want to go back in and do more of that?

2781
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:43,720
I see you, Rarm.

2782
02:41:44,740 --> 02:41:46,460
Looks like almost a trap.

2783
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:50,800
Is this not where we started?

2784
02:41:53,720 --> 02:41:55,320
Piece of...

2785
02:41:55,320 --> 02:41:57,820
Oh, we must go in for the blorb.

2786
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:03,500
Blorb, blorb, blorb.

2787
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:05,360
Blorb fragment.

2788
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:08,880
Oh yeah, now we can finally use the air hike.

2789
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:13,500
There's a blorb in the captain's cabin if you go back.

2790
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,300
I think I'm okay.

2791
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:17,600
It's okay.

2792
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:19,540
But thank you.

2793
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:21,220
Insert chat message.

2794
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:22,400
Thanks, Alvin!

2795
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:26,660
Yeah, I think I'm okay with going...

2796
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:38,220
They spent dev time on the underwater section.

2797
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:40,180
By God, you're going to experience it.

2798
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:45,400
This feels like exactly where we came from.

2799
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:47,900
Oh my gosh!

2800
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:51,840
Oh, I killed him.

2801
02:42:59,320 --> 02:42:59,820
Oh, please.

2802
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:03,000
Get him.

2803
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:04,760
There we go.

2804
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:09,800
Double jump, but I'm in these tiny little rooms.

2805
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:13,780
There's a treasure here, but there's nothing that can be used as weapons.

2806
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:16,060
What do you mean by that?

2807
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:17,500
Dante, your brain!

2808
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:21,060
Dante is just like, I don't care about money.

2809
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:23,600
Holy water!

2810
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:26,260
But there was a treasure in there!

2811
02:43:35,140 --> 02:43:35,980
There we go.

2812
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:37,880
What's the mission anyway?

2813
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:39,020
Oh, mission 14.

2814
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:41,140
Deep darkness and towering mountains.

2815
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:43,620
Go to the surface and head for the Colosseum.

2816
02:43:44,480 --> 02:43:47,200
I'm scared of the Colosseum, you guys!

2817
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:48,100
I'm scared!

2818
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:56,380
Oh geez!

2819
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:58,100
You should be.

2820
02:44:03,180 --> 02:44:07,040
I don't like that.

2821
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,700
Do I just run for it?

2822
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,780
And then it looks like spikes are probably going to come out from the ground.

2823
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:16,840
Cardio time.

2824
02:44:17,660 --> 02:44:22,480
I feel like the camera angle is really going to make this a tedious task.

2825
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:25,780
I made

2826
02:44:30,220 --> 02:44:30,500
it.

2827
02:44:39,710 --> 02:44:41,590
It doesn't turn, right?

2828
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:43,610
I mean...

2829
02:44:43,610 --> 02:44:44,510
Oh, what's this?

2830
02:44:46,030 --> 02:44:47,830
The iron fence is blocking the way.

2831
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:52,850
Oh, we're back.

2832
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:13,140
Oh gosh.

2833
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:17,520
Okay, so I'm guessing... wait.

2834
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:19,840
Oh god.

2835
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:24,000
Oh no, it's going to activate as soon as I grab this, isn't it?

2836
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,820
Oh gosh!

2837
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:29,220
So I probably have to get to the iron fence.

2838
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:31,560
I'm guessing this is maybe the key, perhaps?

2839
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,720
There's something written.

2840
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:43,260
The resonating emblem shall undo the seal of the shield.

2841
02:45:44,380 --> 02:45:45,980
The emblem shield.

2842
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:48,280
Where was that?

2843
02:45:51,720 --> 02:45:53,600
Long time ago.

2844
02:45:54,900 --> 02:45:56,320
A birdy area.

2845
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:03,620
A small shield, the emblem has the same shape as that of those sealing the doors of the Colosseum.

2846
02:46:05,460 --> 02:46:06,420
Oh boy.

2847
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:09,940
The skeleton's arm appears to be a lever of some sort.

2848
02:46:10,060 --> 02:46:10,960
Don't, don't do it.

2849
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:12,560
Dante, don't, don't, don't do it.

2850
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:13,780
Should I turn the lever?

2851
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:17,740
Do I have to?

2852
02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:22,260
Dante, you have like a fist.

2853
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:25,300
You've broken down walls before.

2854
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:27,420
Dante, it's just an iron door.

2855
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:30,060
Dante, just use your fist.

2856
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:31,340
Hello Mint.

2857
02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:34,020
Hi HHPoint, thank you for six runs.

2858
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,700
I'm gonna hate this.

2859
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:48,860
The booby trap has been...

2860
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:50,540
Activated!

2861
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:53,960
Oh, these are way worse than I expected.

2862
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:55,620
Oh my gosh.

2863
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:58,820
Boy, this is way worse than I expected.

2864
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:03,120
Run Dante, run!

2865
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,760
Run Dante, run!

2866
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,840
I think I'm going the wrong way.

2867
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:19,460
Oh wait, no I'm not.

2868
02:47:22,140 --> 02:47:23,200
We made it!

2869
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:28,090
Ok, we're fine.

2870
02:47:29,370 --> 02:47:31,220
Wasn't so bad actually after all.

2871
02:47:43,480 --> 02:47:44,340
Who's here?

2872
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:46,680
What's here?

2873
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:48,500
Who's here?

2874
02:47:48,660 --> 02:47:49,120
What's here?

2875
02:47:49,720 --> 02:47:50,740
What's around here?

2876
02:47:51,580 --> 02:47:52,600
Take a shower Dante.

2877
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:54,760
What was that?

2878
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:55,780
What is this?

2879
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:57,640
There's something in here.

2880
02:47:57,920 --> 02:47:58,740
Grab it Dante.

2881
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:01,420
Dante, grab whatever that is.

2882
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:02,440
What is that?

2883
02:48:02,920 --> 02:48:03,500
Grab it.

2884
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:05,240
Grab it.

2885
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:06,560
What is that?

2886
02:48:11,830 --> 02:48:12,570
Can't tell.

2887
02:48:12,970 --> 02:48:13,150
Oh!

2888
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:14,710
Holy water.

2889
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:14,990
Ok.

2890
02:48:16,530 --> 02:48:17,710
My, oh!

2891
02:48:18,310 --> 02:48:20,510
My depth perception is once again...

2892
02:48:22,370 --> 02:48:24,010
Firmly grasping.

2893
02:48:24,510 --> 02:48:25,330
Oh,

2894
02:48:30,280 --> 02:48:32,140
oopsie.

2895
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:33,000
Hold on.

2896
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:35,840
Please, Dante.

2897
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:37,940
Can you grab that?

2898
02:48:39,060 --> 02:48:41,480
These are terrible jokes about ghosts and booby traps here.

2899
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:45,100
I have this double jump for what?

2900
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:46,680
I can't even...

2901
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:48,100
I can't even make it!

2902
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:51,260
Please!

2903
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:55,140
I have this jump for what?

2904
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:57,000
Wait, maybe I have to like...

2905
02:48:57,680 --> 02:49:00,100
Is this like a little bit higher here?

2906
02:49:01,060 --> 02:49:01,920
Oh, ok.

2907
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:04,100
Maybe I have to go to like...

2908
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:05,300
Oh, I see it.

2909
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:05,860
Oh my gosh.

2910
02:49:05,980 --> 02:49:07,280
Please, camera angle.

2911
02:49:08,120 --> 02:49:09,400
This game hates us.

2912
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:11,800
This game hates you so much.

2913
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:12,580
No, Dante.

2914
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:13,500
Dante, no!

2915
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:15,000
Stop jumping down, Dante.

2916
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:18,760
Oh my gosh.

2917
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:20,260
Can't even just jump.

2918
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:22,500
Your feet are so slippery.

2919
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:26,600
Dante, stop jumping down.

2920
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:27,200
Seriously.

2921
02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:27,400
Seriously.

2922
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:30,320
I'm not even doing that.

2923
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:34,920
He like just automatically turns around and says...

2924
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:35,260
Nah.

2925
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:41,480
I think there is a platform.

2926
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:44,200
You can't see in front of it like where the camera is.

2927
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:48,100
Do I go from...

2928
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:58,080
Wait, I can't see where I'm jumping.

2929
02:50:02,540 --> 02:50:04,400
Maybe if I go from like here.

2930
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:08,220
I give up.

2931
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:09,040
I give up.

2932
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:10,640
Stinger jump?

2933
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:12,560
Oh, whoops.

2934
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:16,940
Wait.

2935
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:19,320
Wait.

2936
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:21,120
Oh, yeah.

2937
02:50:22,580 --> 02:50:23,540
How do I stinger jump?

2938
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:28,740
I just keep doing...

2939
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,780
You can use stinger for a longer jump.

2940
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:33,320
No, I want to practice.

2941
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:35,280
No, I'm trying to practice, you guys.

2942
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:37,540
Stinger jump is when you stinger while facing a ledge.

2943
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:39,080
Oh, so I have to do it from the ledge.

2944
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:39,740
Okay.

2945
02:50:44,280 --> 02:50:46,100
If I can get back up here.

2946
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:48,960
Okay, there we go.

2947
02:50:49,480 --> 02:50:51,440
Wait, so...

2948
02:50:58,750 --> 02:50:59,110
Okay.

2949
02:50:59,110 --> 02:50:59,230
Okay.

2950
02:51:05,670 --> 02:51:08,050
I can't even aim this, you guys.

2951
02:51:10,690 --> 02:51:11,650
No, I give up.

2952
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:15,050
I give up.

2953
02:51:15,150 --> 02:51:16,130
It's not worth it.

2954
02:51:16,490 --> 02:51:18,930
Wait, so I think I do have to go that direction though.

2955
02:51:22,210 --> 02:51:23,610
Back where the blorb was.

2956
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:30,360
Now you know how to stinger jump.

2957
02:51:30,640 --> 02:51:33,020
Oh, no, that's not a... Wait, how do I get out of here?

2958
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:34,360
Hello?

2959
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:36,780
Oh, over here.

2960
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:37,500
Just kidding.

2961
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:39,840
This teeny tiny little doorway.

2962
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:43,580
Oh, shit.

2963
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:44,160
No, no.

2964
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:44,900
Oh, shit.

2965
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:45,560
Fuck me.

2966
02:51:47,560 --> 02:51:48,540
No, no, no!

2967
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:58,510
Okay, let's go...

2968
02:51:58,510 --> 02:52:00,330
Back down here.

2969
02:52:00,670 --> 02:52:01,610
Oh, I can't.

2970
02:52:01,730 --> 02:52:02,930
I can't go... Oh, here we go.

2971
02:52:03,790 --> 02:52:04,590
Wait, the dog!

2972
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:05,070
Wait!

2973
02:52:05,230 --> 02:52:06,250
Oh, wait, I should...

2974
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:07,550
Oh, sorry, I keep doing this.

2975
02:52:07,650 --> 02:52:08,010
You know what?

2976
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:08,430
It's fine.

2977
02:52:09,290 --> 02:52:10,690
I can handle the dog.

2978
02:52:11,730 --> 02:52:13,490
I don't know about two of them, but...

2979
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:16,690
Okay.

2980
02:52:20,010 --> 02:52:21,530
Oh, that's not what I meant to do...

2981
02:52:21,530 --> 02:52:22,090
Oh, shoot.

2982
02:52:22,210 --> 02:52:23,350
Maybe I can't handle two of them.

2983
02:52:24,970 --> 02:52:26,690
Oh, I don't know if I can handle two of them.

2984
02:52:26,950 --> 02:52:27,410
Oh my God.

2985
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:29,350
Wait, I don't know if I can handle two of them, you guys.

2986
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:30,130
Oh, shit.

2987
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:31,670
I don't know if I can handle two of them!

2988
02:52:32,190 --> 02:52:34,130
Ahh, I don't know if I can handle two of them!

2989
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,470
Oh my God.

2990
02:52:37,550 --> 02:52:38,030
Oh my God!

2991
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:38,730
No, no, no!

2992
02:52:38,910 --> 02:52:39,410
Stop, stop, stop!

2993
02:52:39,410 --> 02:52:40,450
Oh, I'm dead.

2994
02:52:45,800 --> 02:52:47,220
They really got me good.

2995
02:52:55,470 --> 02:52:57,750
How am I supposed to know who's gonna ambush me?

2996
02:53:02,430 --> 02:53:03,250
What the...

2997
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:08,150
Oh my god, who are you?

2998
02:53:08,970 --> 02:53:09,910
I'm just gonna leave.

2999
02:53:13,170 --> 02:53:13,690
Hi.

3000
02:53:16,490 --> 02:53:17,330
Oh my god, they follow.

3001
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:18,390
Oh my god, they follow.

3002
02:53:41,410 --> 02:53:42,230
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3003
02:53:57,240 --> 02:53:58,200
This is all I got!

3004
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:00,000
This is all I got!

3005
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:02,820
This is all I got!

3006
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:10,480
Wait, do I have to spend money on this?

3007
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:14,280
Is this one of those spend money...

3008
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:15,860
You mean I could've left this whole time?

3009
02:54:20,980 --> 02:54:21,980
No way.

3010
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:24,460
Wait, but now I can explore the area maybe.

3011
02:54:25,300 --> 02:54:27,280
I could've left this whole time.

3012
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:29,200
What else is here?

3013
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:32,020
Tree.

3014
02:54:36,340 --> 02:54:37,460
Oh, what's that?

3015
02:54:37,860 --> 02:54:38,940
Wait, there's a little room.

3016
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:42,520
What's this?

3017
02:54:48,040 --> 02:54:49,660
Is this the free...

3018
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:54,620
You can switch?

3019
02:54:54,780 --> 02:54:57,320
Yeah, I know, I'm just silly sometimes.

3020
02:54:58,520 --> 02:55:00,860
I know, I'm just silly sometimes.

3021
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:04,480
Sometimes I get so flustered, I press pause.

3022
02:55:04,840 --> 02:55:08,620
I panic and I press pause.

3023
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:11,360
And then I'm like, well, if I'm here, I might as well switch.

3024
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:15,560
I'm gonna go to the other one.

3025
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:18,000
Even though it costs money...

3026
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,240
It's pay to win, right?

3027
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:21,720
Usually that's how these things kind of work.

3028
02:55:25,020 --> 02:55:26,880
They don't even ask.

3029
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:29,940
They're not even like, do you want to use 200 red orbs?

3030
02:55:29,980 --> 02:55:32,420
They're like, oh, nah, we're stealing your money.

3031
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:33,240
Silly.

3032
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:37,700
Oh, it's

3033
02:55:50,970 --> 02:55:51,890
another pay to win.

3034
02:55:53,690 --> 02:55:55,430
Let's farm money here.

3035
02:56:16,630 --> 02:56:17,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3036
02:56:18,430 --> 02:56:19,750
Oh, they never stop.

3037
02:56:20,050 --> 02:56:21,130
They don't stop coming.

3038
02:56:21,250 --> 02:56:22,210
They don't stop coming.

3039
02:56:22,530 --> 02:56:23,450
They don't stop coming.

3040
02:56:23,670 --> 02:56:24,670
They don't stop coming.

3041
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:32,520
And they stop coming.

3042
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:40,800
Dante, it helps when you...

3043
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:42,640
It helps when you actually go up there.

3044
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:46,340
Okay, that's where we came...

3045
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,440
Wait, is that where we came from?

3046
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:52,360
We are...

3047
02:56:52,360 --> 02:56:53,660
This is where we came from.

3048
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:56,200
Anything over

3049
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:02,860
here?

3050
02:57:03,780 --> 02:57:04,240
Secret?

3051
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:07,460
Any secrets over here?

3052
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:16,100
I know your game, Devil May Cry.

3053
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:20,360
Devil may give me my money.

3054
02:57:21,820 --> 02:57:23,000
That's more like it.

3055
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:25,140
Oh shit, let's leave.

3056
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:27,440
We took too long!

3057
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:30,880
Go, go!

3058
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:37,980
Don't worry about them out there.

3059
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:46,240
You have unsealed it.

3060
02:57:51,380 --> 02:57:54,220
Look at Dante here.

3061
02:57:54,820 --> 02:57:56,340
Look at him looking so smug.

3062
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:58,380
Refund a bit.

3063
02:57:58,460 --> 02:57:59,140
Yeah, actually.

3064
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:02,400
He looks so smug.

3065
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:03,860
What?

3066
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:05,440
A D?

3067
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:08,300
As in...

3068
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:09,180
Done right?

3069
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:12,240
Damn girl, you devil hunter.

3070
02:58:14,380 --> 02:58:14,760
What?

3071
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:15,260
A D?

3072
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:18,940
I killed those guys so stylishly.

3073
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:24,340
Do I have any orbs left?

3074
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:24,940
I don't even know.

3075
02:58:26,400 --> 02:58:27,680
Wait, what?

3076
02:58:28,020 --> 02:58:29,080
That was 14?

3077
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:29,180
15?

3078
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:33,940
Guys, I think I'm gonna call it here.

3079
02:58:35,620 --> 02:58:39,080
Maybe next time we play, I will endurance...

3080
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:41,040
The next 10?

3081
02:58:41,420 --> 02:58:42,520
We'll see, we'll see.

3082
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:46,200
I think I'll call it here and do the whole rest of the game.

3083
02:58:46,540 --> 02:58:47,200
The last bit.

3084
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:51,340
Are you gonna call it on a D?

3085
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:54,320
Because it hurt my pride.

3086
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:55,560
My self esteem.

3087
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:58,480
What's the next mission number?

3088
02:58:58,740 --> 02:58:59,180
15.

3089
02:58:59,440 --> 02:59:00,380
Number 15.

3090
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:05,520
Yeah.

3091
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:11,480
Oh my god, I think I'm getting pretty good at this game though.

3092
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:13,420
What do you guys think?

3093
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:17,420
I think I'm gaming a little bit.

3094
02:59:18,380 --> 02:59:18,820
Spank!

3095
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:19,700
Thanks for the attack gifter!

3096
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:21,360
Thank you.

3097
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,500
Only 8 missions left.

3098
02:59:23,580 --> 02:59:23,920
Oh, 8?

3099
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:26,000
Oh, for some reason my brain was thinking 10.

3100
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:28,800
Yeah, 8.

3101
02:59:29,860 --> 02:59:30,760
Oh, it's 23.

3102
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:32,520
Yes, 23.

3103
02:59:35,640 --> 02:59:37,160
Beat a lot of big bosses.

3104
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:39,340
Great progress, great combos.

3105
02:59:39,440 --> 02:59:40,940
You are getting so much better at this game.

3106
02:59:41,380 --> 02:59:43,540
I remember the final boss being brutal, but you can do it.

3107
02:59:43,900 --> 02:59:46,700
We can do it, I believe.

3108
02:59:47,640 --> 02:59:49,320
You can definitely finish next stream.

3109
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:49,920
I think so.

3110
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:54,340
I think even if it takes me longer, I'm okay with going longer, obviously.

3111
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:57,300
I'll probably plan it for...

3112
02:59:57,300 --> 03:00:02,940
I kind of have my next couple of weeks planned out a little bit.

3113
03:00:05,540 --> 03:00:07,960
I will find a time where I can stream for longer.

3114
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:11,700
You are progressing too fast for me to get up and get a snack.

3115
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:12,700
Could you be worse?

3116
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:18,900
Have faith that your streamer will be good all the time!

3117
03:00:22,860 --> 03:00:23,260
So...

3118
03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:25,540
I'll figure out a time.

3119
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:30,080
I'll figure out a time that I can endure it.

3120
03:00:30,940 --> 03:00:38,340
Tomorrow, I will be seeing my family.

3121
03:00:38,700 --> 03:00:40,480
But also we'll have a very short stream.

3122
03:00:41,020 --> 03:00:43,580
Watching the idol EN debuts.

3123
03:00:45,220 --> 03:00:46,900
So there will be that.

3124
03:00:48,460 --> 03:00:48,860
And...

3125
03:00:50,220 --> 03:00:51,940
Yeah, it will be quite a short stream.

3126
03:00:52,220 --> 03:00:55,220
But tomorrow I have stuff to do.

3127
03:00:55,440 --> 03:01:00,200
So I wasn't even really going to stream tomorrow.

3128
03:01:00,400 --> 03:01:01,760
But it ended up being that way.

3129
03:01:03,960 --> 03:01:04,720
But that's okay.

3130
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,560
Take care, man.

3131
03:01:05,620 --> 03:01:06,160
Thanks, chat!

3132
03:01:06,520 --> 03:01:07,540
Wait, thanks, Don.

3133
03:01:10,460 --> 03:01:11,980
Thank you for the DMC stream.

3134
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:13,980
The cutest devil hunter is also the cutest.

3135
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:15,080
Oh, sorry, wait.

3136
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:17,300
The story...

3137
03:01:19,420 --> 03:01:22,040
AI summary says chat is excited for the sequel.

3138
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:23,600
Satan might weep.

3139
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:32,800
Okay, thank you guys!

3140
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:33,680
Thank you!

3141
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:37,940
And I hope you guys have a great rest of your night.

3142
03:01:38,960 --> 03:01:40,580
We did a lot of fisting today.

3143
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:42,540
And I think it's a certain fister's birthday.

3144
03:01:42,540 --> 03:01:46,840
So maybe go show her some appreciation and some love.

3145
03:01:47,120 --> 03:01:50,460
Or Matara is doing her sub-a-thon on Twitch television.

3146
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:52,640
So you can go watch that as well.

3147
03:01:52,780 --> 03:01:54,160
It will be all night, baby.

3148
03:01:57,440 --> 03:01:58,560
Thank you!

3149
03:01:58,900 --> 03:01:59,980
Minto is cute and gaming.

3150
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:01,040
Thank you!

3151
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:04,020
Thank you!

3152
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,100
Good gaming, Minto!

3153
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:06,900
You are getting better and better.

3154
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:08,440
Thank you!

3155
03:02:12,820 --> 03:02:13,940
Pirate505, thank you!

3156
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:15,560
I had the wildest dream today.

3157
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:22,060
An old wise man came to me and said, Did you know that DMC1 was originally supposed to be a different game?

3158
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:22,760
And then I woke up.

3159
03:02:22,820 --> 03:02:24,460
Man, I really wanted to know what he was going to tell me.

3160
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:26,740
Thank you for the donos!

3161
03:02:26,840 --> 03:02:27,800
Thank you for all the superchats!

3162
03:02:28,500 --> 03:02:29,140
Thank you!

3163
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:31,240
We are rating Gigi or Mata.

3164
03:02:31,380 --> 03:02:32,300
Whoever you want to watch.

3165
03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:35,100
Go watch whoever you want to watch.

3166
03:02:35,100 --> 03:02:38,840
I'm sure there are other Vtubers, other streamers streaming as well.

3167
03:02:39,140 --> 03:02:41,140
In fact, I am positive there are.

3168
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:42,540
So, go!

3169
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:46,800
Or just go and relax and enjoy the rest of your night.

3170
03:02:47,060 --> 03:02:49,260
It's Friday, baby!

3171
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:50,200
It's the weekend!

3172
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:51,880
Enjoy your weekend.

3173
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:53,580
Hopefully you get lots of rest.

3174
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:55,000
Don't forget to hydrate.

3175
03:02:55,420 --> 03:02:56,520
Don't forget to...

3176
03:02:56,520 --> 03:03:01,380
Don't forget to stand up and stretch and do all that good stuff.

3177
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:04,540
No, there are no others, just Minto.

3178
03:03:06,540 --> 03:03:09,820
Going to Japan for a bit will hit up at least one maid cafe.

3179
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:11,100
Say more!

3180
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:13,220
You have to do more than one.

3181
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:16,060
More than one.

3182
03:03:18,680 --> 03:03:22,380
And then, of course, don't forget, Minto's 3.0 is in...

3183
03:03:23,460 --> 03:03:24,340
12 days.

3184
03:03:25,260 --> 03:03:25,500
Wait.

3185
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:26,420
Yes?

3186
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:29,020
Is it the 18th?

3187
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:29,500
Oh, wait.

3188
03:03:29,560 --> 03:03:29,720
No.

3189
03:03:32,200 --> 03:03:33,320
13 days.

3190
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:34,540
12 days?

3191
03:03:35,620 --> 03:03:37,020
12 days of Christmas?

3192
03:03:39,420 --> 03:03:44,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12...

3193
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:44,740
13!

3194
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:46,620
13 days.

3195
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:49,560
Yeah.

3196
03:03:49,940 --> 03:03:50,240
Okay!

3197
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:52,140
Awesome Minto, everybody!

3198
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:53,380
Thank you!

3199
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:55,020
Thank you!

3200
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:57,040
Thank you!

3201
03:03:57,160 --> 03:03:57,800
Otsu Friday!

3202
03:03:58,020 --> 03:04:01,320
Came back from work late, but just got to relax with Minto's stream.

3203
03:04:02,340 --> 03:04:02,860
Otsu!

3204
03:04:03,060 --> 03:04:03,480
Otsu!

3205
03:04:03,580 --> 03:04:03,740
Otsu!

3206
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:04,380
Otsu!

3207
03:04:05,460 --> 03:04:08,300
If you guys had a hard week, hopefully...

3208
03:04:08,300 --> 03:04:12,480
The weekend can wash away all of your stress.

3209
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:14,240
And relax.

3210
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:17,460
Bye bye!

3211
03:04:18,100 --> 03:04:18,620
Itterasshai!

3212
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:19,880
Bye bye!

3213
03:04:20,060 --> 03:04:20,420
Bye bye!

3214
03:04:20,500 --> 03:04:20,800
Bye bye!

3215
03:04:20,940 --> 03:04:22,000
Bye bye!

3216
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:23,000
Thanks for watching!

3217
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:24,060
Thanks for hanging out with me!

3218
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:26,400
I really appreciate it!

3219
03:04:26,680 --> 03:04:27,140
Bye bye!
