1
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,640
I've been listening to this for the past, like, 15 minutes.

2
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,410
Welcome back to Astro Bot.

3
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,850
I don't know if you can see.

4
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,010
Game progress.

5
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,430
It says 100% behind there.

6
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,450
Yeah, I've gotten all the trophies.

7
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,210
Don't look at the left.

8
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,350
Yeah, I finished the game.

9
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,810
Don't look at the trophies.

10
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,730
Layer!

11
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,110
Oh no!

12
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,050
Spelling error in the group chat!

13
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,650
Spelling error in the stream chat!

14
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,670
Welcome back to Astro Bot!

15
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,970
I love this game.

16
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,070
And this game is so cute!

17
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,840
So embarrassing.

18
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,780
Yeah, I've been just chilling with this song.

19
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,100
I'm ready to start.

20
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,940
I have some stuff I need to do tonight.

21
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,500
So, oh my gosh, I just noticed that Planet is toxic.

22
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,200
Must have Twitter.

23
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,780
Okay, let's play the game!

24
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,120
Yeah!

25
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
I realized that I never showed you guys.

26
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,500
I like that music so much.

27
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,560
Like, it just kind of set your vibe to it before stream.

28
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,280
I mean, this one's great too, but...

29
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,240
Oh, I forgot how good this one is.

30
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,220
Astro Bot!

31
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,000
We have two monkeys!

32
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,220
Oh, oh, I'm trying to...

33
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,620
Astro Bot!

34
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,490
Astro Bot!

35
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,710
Since I have stuff I need to do today, let's just get into it.

36
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,770
Let's just start playing.

37
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,810
Let's just...

38
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,930
Let's just keep on rolling.

39
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,930
So let's... before we do that though, let's...

40
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,230
We're gonna go see what little guys we've got so far, you know?

41
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,310
Meow!

42
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,050
Meow!

43
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,730
Meow!

44
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,610
Hello, my people!

45
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,430
Hi, Snake.

46
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,430
So...

47
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,030
Oh!

48
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,550
Meow!

49
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,670
Meow!

50
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,850
We have Metal Gear Solid!

51
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,110
We have them.

52
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,310
Like a spiral over here.

53
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,050
He doesn't do anything.

54
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,670
Ow!

55
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,670
What?

56
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,590
Like, I don't know why he's so obsessed with this.

57
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:07,870
This tree.

58
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,030
The boys.

59
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,450
We've got... Oh, I don't...

60
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,530
Oh, wait, this is, um...

61
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,230
Last of Us here.

62
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,570
We got them last time.

63
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,750
Meow!

64
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,990
Thank you!

65
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,030
Watching at the airport, so excited to see you.

66
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,510
A boat!

67
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,830
Even though there's no Waffle House to fight at.

68
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,570
Next time.

69
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,230
Next location.

70
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,010
Next time.

71
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,430
Next time.

72
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,250
Yeah.

73
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,530
Tonight, actually, I have sound checks.

74
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,810
For my concert tomorrow.

75
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,670
We got all the ape escapes.

76
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,830
We got Ratchet and Clank.

77
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,390
We got so many guys going on here.

78
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,550
I don't remember what that one is.

79
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,030
Um... Castlevania.

80
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,870
We got Persona.

81
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,250
We got Persona 4 last time.

82
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,310
Um...

83
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,430
We have all these regular guys.

84
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,430
The regs, you know.

85
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,730
These guys are normies.

86
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,590
Hello!

87
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,530
Hello!

88
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,770
Hello!

89
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,330
Welcome in!

90
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,930
Welcome in, everybody!

91
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,110
Welcome in!

92
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,450
Welcome in!

93
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:13,850
Welcome on!

94
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,390
The normies.

95
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,310
We got some Persona 3, too?

96
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,250
We did?

97
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,450
Oh, I forgot we got Katamari!

98
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,500
Stick!

99
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,860
Stick!

100
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,500
Ow!

101
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,320
Oh, yeah!

102
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,280
We got Resident Evil!

103
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,840
Hold on.

104
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,300
I'm stuck.

105
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,040
There we go.

106
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,880
We got Resident Evil over here.

107
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,740
They're so cute!

108
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,080
So...

109
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,800
I don't know what we'll get today.

110
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,080
I do not know...

111
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,640
how far we'll get.

112
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,220
But I'm ready...

113
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,400
to go.

114
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,100
And...

115
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,400
Triggers!

116
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,780
Gosh, this game is just so cute!

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,180
God of War.

118
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,700
Oh, yeah!

119
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,060
Because we have...

120
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,420
What was it?

121
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,740
Over here?

122
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,680
Don't we have...

123
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
God of War here or something?

124
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,780
Or something?

125
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,060
Something?

126
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,020
Yeah!

127
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah!

128
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,720
Over here!

129
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,040
Over here!

130
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,260
Right?

131
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,640
Here!

132
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,600
God of War!

133
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,280
Wait!

134
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,600
There's so many guys here!

135
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,720
Let's just get started!

136
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,020
Let's just dive right in, baby!

137
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:29,880
Oh!

138
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,660
Oh!

139
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,200
Oh!

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,100
What's that?

141
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,040
What's that?

142
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,080
That's a glowing bird!

143
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,280
Yeah!

144
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,000
I got his butt!

145
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Oh!

146
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,480
Oh!

147
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,580
Oh!

148
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Nice!

149
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,660
I spoiled myself.

150
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,860
He should get the rest of the MGS characters.

151
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,060
I know there are some more, because I also got a little bit spoiled.

152
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,120
Though I am not sure where they are at.

153
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,340
Do not spoil for me, please, though.

154
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,760
I like to discover myself.

155
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,720
I like to discover myself.

156
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,880
Look at that war...

157
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,220
Oh no!

158
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,340
Oh!

159
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,140
It's just a little worm in there!

160
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,820
I'll get you out!

161
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,220
Oh my God!

162
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,140
I get paid for rescuing him.

163
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, that's a snake.

164
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,620
That's not a worm.

165
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,180
Ouch!

166
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,740
They're up your butt!

167
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,440
Oh my God!

168
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,260
That's weird.

169
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,220
That's what that feeling is.

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,860
Oh!

171
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
What was this thing again?

172
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,100
Oh shoot!

173
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,580
I'm kind of a genius!

174
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,020
I think it's only those two things.

175
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,260
Okay.

176
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,840
There's two snakes here.

177
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,280
Nice.

178
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,000
I never know what guys I can use my fists on and what guys I need to jump and hit, you know?

179
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,440
Twin snakes!

180
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,420
Oh!

181
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,380
Oh!

182
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,740
Oh my God!

183
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,360
Hey!

184
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,080
Watch out, man!

185
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,880
There's children there.

186
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
It's John, God of War!

187
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,660
Look!

188
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,960
Look!

189
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,160
Look!

190
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,640
He's...

191
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,120
Oh!

192
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,400
It's too heavy for me!

193
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm just a bot!

194
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,980
No!

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm just a...

196
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,720
Oh!

197
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,220
Oh!

198
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,720
Never mind.

199
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm kind of awesome.

200
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,240
Oh!

201
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,680
Oh!

202
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,400
Why did I die?

203
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,200
Why does God of War get its own world?

204
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,400
Huh?

205
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,220
Oh my God!

206
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
Oh my God!

207
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,660
I've become Kratos!

208
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,700
What?

209
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,730
Oh my God!

210
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,170
This is my baby now!

211
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,230
This is my child!

212
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,130
Come, come, boy!

213
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,710
Come, child!

214
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,590
Come, child!

215
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,090
Come, child!

216
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,530
Oh my God!

217
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,330
I can defeat everything with my fists!

218
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,890
Yeah!

219
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,330
I can defeat everything with my fists!

220
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,730
Yeah!

221
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,050
Wait, what's...

222
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,410
Wait, huh?

223
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,670
What is it?

224
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,550
Oh, I can throw it!

225
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,390
Oh my god!

226
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,930
Uh, how do I get it back?

227
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,030
Wait, how do I get my...

228
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,110
Wait, how do I...

229
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:29,830
Um...

230
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,050
Wait, uh...

231
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,350
Wait, hold on!

232
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Pick up.

233
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,480
Oh, okay.

234
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,600
Oh my gosh!

235
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,000
Wow!

236
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,880
Yeah!

237
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah!

238
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,040
Yo...

239
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,170
I'm very powerful right now.

240
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,030
Oh my god!

241
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,970
I don't think I'll ever stop using this now.

242
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,630
I'm like sniping them left and right.

243
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,490
Yeah!

244
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,010
It's so busted!

245
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,350
It's even auto-aims for me!

246
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,550
Oh my god, the music's so awesome!

247
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,490
It's so busted!

248
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,170
You guys!

249
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,790
The music is fun too!

250
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,310
I know!

251
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,750
Gosh... I really love that this is just kind of a...

252
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,570
Like a history lesson, you know?

253
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,210
Oh...

254
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,130
What's through here?

255
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,310
Okay, hold on.

256
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,750
Hold on.

257
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,390
Before we...

258
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,830
Before we gander...

259
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,510
I don't know why I keep saying that word lately.

260
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,370
I'm really sorry.

261
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,450
Um...

262
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,050
Before we view...

263
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,550
anything else, let's uh...

264
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,850
This looks...

265
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,490
Yeah.

266
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,210
I'll take that.

267
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,470
Oh, sorry.

268
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:12,810
Sorry.

269
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,430
Uh, what is it?

270
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,630
Oh, sorry.

271
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,990
No, no.

272
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,170
How do I open this?

273
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,540
Gando.

274
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,200
Oh!

275
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,640
I did it!

276
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,230
Again.

277
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,730
Once again.

278
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,370
Uh, my genius...

279
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,410
is showing.

280
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,750
My genius is showing, everybody.

281
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,360
Minto tensai.

282
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,660
I know, I know.

283
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,540
Oh my gosh!

284
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,300
I can kill the bird!

285
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,160
Wait, hold on.

286
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,820
Alright, we need to properly... There we go.

287
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,580
What the?

288
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,080
Yeah!

289
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,660
Yeah!

290
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,120
I don't know what's special about these birds.

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,180
Why are we trying to kill them?

292
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,360
Tensai!

293
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,880
I have thunder goddess!

294
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,840
Big hair.

295
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,100
Bigger heart.

296
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,480
Hello!

297
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,240
Hello!

298
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,180
Oh!

299
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
Who is that?

300
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,780
Boy.

301
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,780
Boy?

302
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,640
Boy.

303
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,420
He said the thing!

304
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,120
Why do they...

305
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,660
What the?

306
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,940
What's that sound?

307
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,280
There's a little...

308
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,180
sound of electric...

309
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,320
Oh!

310
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,220
It's still alive!

311
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
You see his eye.

312
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:52,760
Oh!

313
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,200
There it is!

314
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,540
There we go!

315
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,060
It's still alive!

316
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,080
Okay.

317
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,540
Let's quote unquote save.

318
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,100
Here we go.

319
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,420
Alright, let's save and then let's go through here.

320
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,420
Boy.

321
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,460
Boy.

322
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,340
I like ice scaling.

323
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,400
La la la!

324
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,660
La la la la!

325
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,220
Oh!

326
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,380
Oh my god!

327
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,900
The dogs!

328
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,680
Little pups!

329
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:18,920
Oh!

330
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,300
Uh...

331
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,620
Oh!

332
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,020
Sorry!

333
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh!

334
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,100
Game over!

335
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,580
Never be game over.

336
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,500
I don't think you're supposed to whip out your genius in public like that.

337
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,240
It's a free country!

338
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,420
It's a free country!

339
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,720
It's...

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,020
What are these...

341
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,460
This one looks like a lady going to heaven.

342
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,960
And then...

343
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,200
This one...

344
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
I can't tell.

345
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,600
I can't tell.

346
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,360
So the story is...

347
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,040
Dad gets Son...

348
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,160
A PlayStation.

349
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,460
And plays... and...

350
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,520
The Son is bad.

351
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,740
Okay.

352
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,980
You suck at the game.

353
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,600
So come here.

354
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,220
You're not good, Ironwood.

355
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,380
Oh...

356
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,580
Juh!

357
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,880
Turn!

358
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,980
Looks like a little face that's going like...

359
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,560
Paints a...

360
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,280
A prescient picture.

361
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,940
Oh!

362
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,580
He's playing Bot of War!

363
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,280
Sorry, dogs.

364
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,740
I just stole your master.

365
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,060
Maybe.

366
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Oh my gosh!

367
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,780
Even like the painting has the...

368
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,100
The controller symbols.

369
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,340
Ow!

370
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,740
Bye!

371
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,940
Okay.

372
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,100
Onward.

373
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,780
I saw something behind there.

374
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,220
Okay.

375
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,100
So far so good.

376
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
And we got...

377
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,080
We've got...

378
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,780
Uh...

379
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,420
Oh gosh.

380
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,540
Two so far.

381
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,940
No misses.

382
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Wolf bot.

383
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,860
Nice.

384
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,400
And I'm just gonna...

385
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,860
Wait.

386
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,060
Wait.

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,620
Yep.

388
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,440
This thing is so...

389
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,610
Busted.

390
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,800
My god.

391
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,460
Oh, whoops.

392
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,840
I threw it too early!

393
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,280
Ah!

394
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,040
Is this how actual God of War is?

395
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,540
Kill that bird.

396
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,840
Oh my god.

397
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm destroying everything.

398
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,520
I'm a monster!

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,440
100%.

400
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,440
There's another bird up there.

401
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,800
Ah!

402
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,140
There's another bird.

403
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,240
Oh.

404
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,340
No, no, no.

405
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,740
I see him.

406
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,100
I see him.

407
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,320
Give me that bird.

408
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,140
Give me that bird.

409
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,540
If I go over there...

410
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,440
Hmm.

411
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,320
Throw axe.

412
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,320
Get axe.

413
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,840
I can do that.

414
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,160
In fact, I think I've proven my worth.

415
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,520
Oh!

416
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,100
How do I...

417
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,660
Grab.

418
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,020
There we go.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Oh!

420
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
This is...

421
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,020
New?

422
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,860
This is new.

423
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,520
We have not experienced this before.

424
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,760
Hold on.

425
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm destroying your relics.

426
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,760
What's up there?

427
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,280
Hey!

428
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,170
Hey!

429
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,210
Get away from my riches.

430
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,410
Alright.

431
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,230
God of War.

432
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,630
I'm already a god.

433
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,450
Okay.

434
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,650
Here we go.

435
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,590
Oh!

436
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:58,830
I

437
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,030
don't know if we wanted to summon that.

438
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,850
Oh!

439
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,830
Oh my god.

440
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,410
Is this thing good?

441
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,950
Oh.

442
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,290
Hello.

443
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,620
We missed one.

444
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,420
Thunder god.

445
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,800
Oh shoot.

446
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,700
I forgot to read it.

447
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm so sorry.

448
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,440
What if I just...

449
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,840
I was rewarded for my...

450
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,020
For my curiosity.

451
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,620
Careful.

452
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,220
We're careful.

453
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,200
We're careful.

454
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,340
There's a bird up there.

455
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,840
Is this guy safe?

456
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I guess I'm okay.

457
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,420
Pleasant meeting you.

458
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh!

459
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,240
He's actually quite cute.

460
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,600
I think.

461
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,360
This is such a nice photo op.

462
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,800
Cheese!

463
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,600
Oh.

464
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,300
Boy.

465
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,860
This song is killing me.

466
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,580
Oh shoot.

467
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,220
Wait.

468
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,080
How am I supposed to get back up?

469
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,300
Oh!

470
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,220
I climbed the thing.

471
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm...

472
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,480
I'm a silly goose.

473
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,640
God of goose.

474
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,160
Here's a friend.

475
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,100
A serpent that goes around the world.

476
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:45,980
Wow.

477
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,860
My boy.

478
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,300
Alright.

479
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,620
Here we go.

480
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,500
What's over here?

481
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,000
Hello, turtle.

482
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,380
What do you got going on there?

483
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,540
I'm so sorry to disturb your...

484
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,300
This is kind of messed up.

485
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,660
He's just living his life.

486
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,800
He can't get back up.

487
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,000
Why would you do that?

488
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
Valkyrie clean.

489
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
The witch of the woods no more.

490
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,320
Whee!

491
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,660
Whee!

492
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,300
Now she's just...

493
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,540
She's the witch of my controller.

494
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,820
Okay.

495
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh?

496
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,020
Oh!

497
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,380
Oh!

498
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,080
I don't think it would let me...

499
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,640
slip off, but...

500
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,020
Oh.

501
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,860
Uh oh.

502
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,900
Oh

503
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,440
shoot.

504
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,420
No!

505
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,820
My...

506
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,660
I thought my...

507
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,900
axe was like...

508
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,560
all powerful.

509
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,840
What's up with that?

510
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,600
I think I got...

511
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,340
I got...

512
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,070
I got...

513
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,070
a bamboozle.

514
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,270
Oh my goodness.

515
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,810
You can flip the turtle back over?

516
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,150
I can?

517
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,810
Oh, I see.

518
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,090
I see.

519
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:39,890
Come here.

520
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,470
Oh.

521
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,450
No, no, no, no.

522
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,870
Come here.

523
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,850
Oh, I get even rewarded for it.

524
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:55,910
Nice.

525
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,570
Saved.

526
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,570
Everybody, we're a good guy, okay?

527
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,390
We're a good guy, okay?

528
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,110
He is quite eepy.

529
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,490
Boy.

530
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,290
Even having never played God of War, this is quite fun still.

531
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,410
Okay.

532
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,240
Before we travel across that, though, I wanna go through here.

533
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,100
How do I...

534
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,840
How do I...

535
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,960
Oh, like so?

536
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,000
A feather tree.

537
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,720
Oh!

538
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,120
Oh, this is where I go once I get all the birds!

539
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
I gotta kill them!

540
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,740
Oh, this is where their souls are!

541
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,960
Aha!

542
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,440
Oh!

543
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:48,540
Oh!

544
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,260
It pays to explore, everybody!

545
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,440
Oh!

546
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,280
That's a person!

547
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,860
I got a smartest man alive!

548
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,940
When it comes to wisdom, they're always ahead!

549
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,880
Ah!

550
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,640
It's in my mirror?

551
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,140
Is he sleepy?

552
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,020
Oh my goodness.

553
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,680
The feathers are kinda wild.

554
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,360
Alright, so we come back here later.

555
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
You guys, don't let me forget, okay?

556
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,480
Once we murder all these birds, okay?

557
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,820
Oh, there's even dogs here.

558
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,140
I'm a mirror.

559
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,080
Oh!

560
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,620
I like ice skating like this.

561
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,000
It's fun.

562
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,580
Oh!

563
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,300
Okay.

564
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,580
Oh!

565
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,000
Except when.

566
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,680
Okay, nice.

567
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,240
Nice!

568
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,580
Nice!

569
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,000
Take out the competition early.

570
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,600
Nice.

571
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,040
Oh!

572
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,460
Oh, uh...

573
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,020
Oh!

574
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,580
We got it!

575
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:34,880
We got it!

576
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,200
We got it!

577
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,940
Ah!

578
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,320
Oh my gosh!

579
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,080
I...

580
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,940
I, uh...

581
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,940
I got a little...

582
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,240
Ah!

583
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,620
Ax got some range.

584
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,180
I know!

585
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,020
It's actually so awesome, right?

586
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,580
Okay.

587
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,440
We gotta do this again.

588
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,680
I got flattened, you guys.

589
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,100
How embarrassing.

590
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,040
Boy.

591
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,280
Oh my gosh!

592
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,760
Oh my gosh!

593
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,040
I got...

594
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,860
I got too greedy.

595
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,240
I thought I could kill him.

596
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,880
I got too greedy!

597
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,480
I got too greedy.

598
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,360
I got too greedy.

599
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,140
It's my fault.

600
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,920
Yeah!

601
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,300
Literally, he's releasing my rage.

602
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,520
He's releasing my rage!

603
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,700
Masterful bait.

604
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:44,940
No!

605
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,420
Okay.

606
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,300
Now we can maybe... No, no, no, no.

607
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,500
I'm not gonna get greedy.

608
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,280
I'm not gonna get greedy.

609
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,700
Now, here we go.

610
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,100
That's what I'm talking about.

611
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,040
That's what I'm talking about.

612
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,960
That's what I'm talking about.

613
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh!

614
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,700
It was a little snowman of them.

615
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,620
It was a little snowman of them.

616
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm raging.

617
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,600
I'm raging.

618
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,660
I'm raging.

619
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,380
Oh!

620
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,140
Oh!

621
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:14,720
Oh!

622
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,180
Oh!

623
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,780
There's this too.

624
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,240
Gosh.

625
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,360
This game continues to impress me.

626
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,340
Because it's so sweet looking, you know?

627
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,840
Because it's so sweet looking, you know?

628
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,920
But it's also just so...

629
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,180
Oh my gosh.

630
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,580
Oh my gosh.

631
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,940
It's also just so well-made.

632
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Because it looks so good, you know?

633
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,280
Because it looks so good, you know?

634
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,200
But it's also just so cute.

635
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,780
They cooked with Astro Bot.

636
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,180
They did!

637
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,500
Dwarven Blacksmith!

638
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,160
The only thing bluer than their skin is their language?

639
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,330
What does that mean?

640
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,200
What does blue language mean?

641
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,730
They swear a lot.

642
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,650
Is that what it means to have a blue language?

643
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,390
Colorful language?

644
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,630
I see.

645
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,830
I think I get it.

646
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,660
I don't get it.

647
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,240
Like it's just so beautiful.

648
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,120
Oh!

649
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,220
Smush.

650
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,660
More.

651
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,300
Oh.

652
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,920
Oh my gosh.

653
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,430
I missed a burp?

654
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,940
Look at the giant... look at the snake over there.

655
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,460
So funny.

656
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,560
I

657
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,610
think it's beneath you.

658
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,110
What?

659
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,250
Are you saying that the bird sucks?

660
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,750
Oh, I see him.

661
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,590
Nothing's beneath me.

662
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,610
Oh, I see him.

663
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:38,850
I see him.

664
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,290
That's so mean to say.

665
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,650
Like he's just a bird.

666
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,930
I got it.

667
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,590
Can't wait for my happy come.

668
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,590
Thank you.

669
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,370
Gonna wear it to all the concerts, especially the death metal ones.

670
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,630
Yeah, you should.

671
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,210
Oh, wait.

672
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,610
I need... actually, I need that back.

673
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,850
Okay, here we go.

674
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,670
I knew there was something up with this platform.

675
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,010
Die, bird.

676
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,010
Thank you.

677
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,210
Oh!

678
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,990
Eyes of the Allfather.

679
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,210
Does that mean I got all the birds?

680
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,990
Okay, guys, we gotta backtrack a little.

681
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,330
I'm sorry.

682
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,930
Guys, we gotta...

683
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,720
Can I go from here?

684
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,400
I don't think I can make it.

685
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,640
Try it?

686
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:55,900
Okay.

687
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,400
Whoa!

688
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,480
Oh, wait.

689
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,820
How do I get back?

690
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,280
Do I actually have to go all the way back?

691
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,500
Do I actually have to go all the way back?

692
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,880
Why would it show me that area, you know?

693
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,080
If not...

694
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,160
Yeah, I do.

695
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:19,460
Okay.

696
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,260
Okay, upwards.

697
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:26,960
Oh!

698
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

699
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,120
Okay, we're good.

700
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,460
We're good.

701
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:30,840
We're fine.

702
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,300
Everything's fine.

703
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Oh, okay.

704
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,020
Ooh, almost didn't make that.

705
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,240
Oh, it's not that far.

706
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,900
Okay, we're good.

707
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,400
We're all here.

708
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,600
It's not that far.

709
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:40,700
It's not that far.

710
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,630
Now what?

711
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,170
Yes!

712
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,550
Uh...

713
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,710
Okay.

714
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,520
At least it satiated my curiosity.

715
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,030
It satiated...

716
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,290
Oh!

717
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,840
Oh yeah, what's my reward?

718
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,260
It's funny because this isn't really a backtracking type game, so it's like...

719
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,800
I was like, oh I have to go back?

720
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,060
Okay.

721
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,900
Have to throw your axe at the tree.

722
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,820
Oh!

723
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,420
Why did it turn the camera on me?

724
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,480
That's fine.

725
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,180
I think we're okay.

726
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,620
What is going on?

727
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,620
We're playing Astral!

728
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,440
But...

729
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,800
Look how cute this game is.

730
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,460
I feel like Kiara would really like this game.

731
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,320
Since she...

732
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,700
Since there's the...

733
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
Since you have her profile picture.

734
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,360
Her as your profile picture.

735
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,700
I feel like she'd really like this game.

736
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,000
I was watching her play the... what's it called?

737
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,900
Game a little bit.

738
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,800
The new Zelda game.

739
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,100
Oh, what the...

740
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,060
Hey, hey, hey!

741
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
What are you doing still alive here?

742
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,550
What are you doing here?

743
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,070
Hold

744
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:04,930
on.

745
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,750
Do I use him?

746
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,910
Oh my god!

747
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,070
I'm a genius!

748
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,510
I'm a genius!

749
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,170
I'm a genius!

750
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,690
I'm a genius!

751
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,630
Oh!

752
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,210
And we got everybody!

753
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,110
Dwarven artisan.

754
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,170
Strong metalwork.

755
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,010
Weak stomach.

756
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,250
Johnny?

757
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,770
Are you Johnny?

758
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,330
Collab when?

759
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,290
What, with Kimawa?

760
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,310
Whenever.

761
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,590
I would always love to collab with her.

762
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,530
How do we...

763
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,810
How do we get over to there?

764
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,300
Maybe I needed to keep one of the enemies.

765
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,660
Don't miss the jump.

766
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,660
Oh, really?

767
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,020
That's it?

768
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,080
Okay.

769
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,490
It was really that easy.

770
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,910
Yippee!

771
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:47,970
I like how they're just like, hey, by the way, you're going to have to, like, use your axe for things, and then you won't have access to it for the enemies.

772
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,090
Because we know that you're going to rely on it way too much.

773
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,030
And so we're just going to do...

774
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,490
Oh!

775
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,150
Oh!

776
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,210
Oh!

777
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:57,490
Oh!

778
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:57,670
Oh!

779
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:57,710
Oh!

780
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,590
Oh!

781
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,810
Oh, my gosh.

782
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,880
Oh, my gosh.

783
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,640
I'm tearing out his butt.

784
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,840
Oh!

785
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,240
Oh, my gosh.

786
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,540
He's got a big old tail and got a...

787
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,460
Oh!

788
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,500
Yeah, there we go.

789
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh!

790
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm going to throw this at you.

791
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,600
He's dead!

792
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,220
Rescued ship pot!

793
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,340
Mentos.

794
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,240
No.

795
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,240
Mother ship's SSD allows space travel faster than the speed of loading.

796
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,380
Oh, that's it?

797
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,040
3, 2, 1.

798
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,880
That was so easy.

799
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,700
What's in the drive?

800
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,200
A folder that says homework.

801
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,000
It's night time.

802
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,440
Time for surgery.

803
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,240
Time for surgery everybody.

804
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,580
That's a lot of homework.

805
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,380
Busy, busy.

806
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,390
Why am I using a chainsaw?

807
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,090
Just let it thaw out.

808
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,830
A pack of

809
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,180
chainsaw.

810
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,060
I'll skin your eyes raw.

811
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,840
And my day keeps going this way.

812
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,080
I just might chain this.

813
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,640
SSD tonight.

814
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,240
But this is like hardware.

815
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,160
Are we sure we want to do this?

816
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,360
Play

817
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,030
the game.

818
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,890
I'm making music.

819
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
I don't know how the sound goes.

820
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm part of the orchestra.

821
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,040
Okay.

822
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,680
Next.

823
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,260
Suddenly a rhythm game.

824
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,360
Oh my god.

825
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,080
There's a monkey in the corner that's just spinning around in circles.

826
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,780
It's so funny.

827
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,740
Okay.

828
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,420
I'm going to insert this in.

829
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,220
Nice and easy.

830
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,240
Hold on.

831
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,680
There we go.

832
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Nice and easy.

833
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,940
And the square goes into the square hole.

834
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,820
And the square goes into the square hole.

835
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,340
You play a mean rectangle.

836
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,300
Thank you.

837
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,240
Okay.

838
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,180
Nice and easy.

839
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,880
It's kind of hard to figure out how to put it in.

840
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,840
Were those hard eyes?

841
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,300
Okay.

842
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,420
I'm going to be gentle this time.

843
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,200
Gentle.

844
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,500
Oh, this is gentle.

845
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,000
Gento.

846
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,320
Gento.

847
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,800
Gento.

848
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,040
Oh my god.

849
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,920
The eyes of

850
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,150
robots.

851
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,820
I said I was going to be gentle with them.

852
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,760
Okay.

853
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,500
Yippee.

854
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,680
Our SSD.

855
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,200
Don't make this weird.

856
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,300
It didn't make anything weird.

857
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,220
What are you talking about, Chucky?

858
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,040
It's literally in the game.

859
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,520
And...

860
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,080
See?

861
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,320
He likes it.

862
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,880
Solid performance.

863
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
Oh my god.

864
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,480
He's on a little memory card.

865
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,260
That's so cute.

866
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:48,790
SSD.

867
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,870
It was already weird.

868
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,970
SSD.

869
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:57,710
SSD.

870
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,970
This game is so cute.

871
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,690
I love how everything has a song.

872
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,570
SSD.

873
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,510
We have...

874
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,650
101 Dalmatians!

875
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,050
Okay.

876
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,230
Time to skin them all.

877
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,670
We're making a bot coat tonight.

878
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,270
Look how proud he is.

879
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,950
What's wrong?

880
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,220
They're like, Yeah!

881
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,240
Pull his ass!

882
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,120
Pull his ass!

883
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,780
They're pointing.

884
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,780
They're like...

885
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,980
This is what I watched my dad do to my dog after he ate the couch.

886
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,840
Okay.

887
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,820
I'll pull it out.

888
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,180
Oh.

889
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,380
No.

890
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:46,820
I need help.

891
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,220
I need help pulling this.

892
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,280
You shouldn't have eaten that.

893
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:51,960
Here we go!

894
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,400
Nice.

895
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:10,700
Yeah.

896
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,820
My dog had...

897
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,520
a couch in his butt.

898
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,460
He ate part of the couch.

899
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,060
Then my dad had to pull it out of his butt.

900
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,100
It reminded me of that moment, okay?

901
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,860
Where's Snake?

902
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,920
Where is he?

903
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:27,920
Wait.

904
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,420
How do I...

905
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,380
Snake!

906
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,080
Are you being a team player?

907
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,080
Wait.

908
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,580
Prince!

909
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,160
Oh my gosh.

910
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,260
I almost didn't make it.

911
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,260
Wait.

912
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:43,980
Whoa.

913
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm just taking over this land.

914
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,360
There's creatures that live here.

915
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,680
I'm taking over.

916
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,680
Hey.

917
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,440
You guys stay here.

918
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,020
It's not safe.

919
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,460
Okay?

920
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,840
What's this guy?

921
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,740
Oh.

922
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,280
We need the whole crew!

923
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,180
Oh my gosh.

924
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:05,820
Oh.

925
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,220
Oh.

926
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:06,960
What's happening?

927
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,860
What is this?

928
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:09,860
Wait.

929
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,040
Wait.

930
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,260
Wait.

931
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:10,420
Wait.

932
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,360
We gotta kill these guys.

933
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,640
Come here.

934
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,020
I see Gray Fox.

935
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,700
Look at them.

936
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,440
Look at my army.

937
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,560
There's Snake.

938
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,460
Hold on guys.

939
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,120
I should secure the land first.

940
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,140
Probably.

941
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,010
Secure the land!

942
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,810
Secure the land!

943
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:38,820
Okay.

944
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,320
Alright.

945
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:39,780
Let's do this.

946
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,340
Ahhh!

947
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,630
Is that stray cat?

948
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,550
Curious kitty solves puzzles.

949
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,650
Loves to dazzle.

950
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,070
Ahhh!

951
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:09,590
It's stray!

952
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,130
Oh my gosh.

953
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,750
We got a cat!

954
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,350
Best game ever!

955
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:18,550
Alright everybody.

956
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,050
Come up here.

957
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,130
Team players.

958
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,970
Come up here.

959
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,230
Oh.

960
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:26,670
Nevermind.

961
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,350
What are you guys doing?

962
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,790
Oh.

963
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,130
Oh.

964
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,930
Oh I see.

965
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,110
But can we pet the cat?

966
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,270
I believe we should be able to pet the cat.

967
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:34,850
Oh.

968
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,490
You guys.

969
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:36,510
You guys steady.

970
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:37,950
Steady.

971
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:38,390
Steady.

972

We're in the pit.

984
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,150
Oh my god.

985
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,330
Snake is up on top of me.

986
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,790
Oh my god.

987
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:08,110

991
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,490

993
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:20,050

994
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,750

995
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:22,210
What is he from?

996
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,790
We got a cat and a dog.

997
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:34,310

998
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,390

1001
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,670
It's an awesome puzzle game.

1002
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:40,950

00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,390
We're gonna kill them.

1011
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,290
Oh my god.

1012
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:55,590

00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,430
We rescued them.

1015
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,890
Oh my god.

1016
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,390

Good job guys.

1019
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,000
Why didn't you just drop down?

1020
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,400
I like these guys.

1021
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,500

1022
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,080

00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,720
Don't fall down please.

1026
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,780

1027
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,700
Alright.

1028
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,820

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,080
Nice.

1032
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,340
I'll take that for sure.

1033
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,520
We need 80 guys here.

1034
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,140
That's a big dog.

1035
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,340
That's a big dog.

1036
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,320
Yeah.

1037
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,200

1038
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,680
Let me in.

00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,260
Okay.

1040
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,560
I'm here.

1041
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,900
I can't move any...

1042
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,440
Okay.

1043
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,240
Push.

1044
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:18,760
Sorry.

1045
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:19,860
Oh my god.

1046
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,560
Sorry.

1047
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,380
I'm here.

1048
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,520
There we go.

1049
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:28,940
Evil.

1050
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:37,430
Gosh.

1051
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,550
There's so many guys down here.

1052
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,990
What the hell is that?

1053
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,190
Robotic sucker.

1054
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,210
Gets under your skin.

1055
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:45,350
Get in.

1056
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,290
You're useless bot.

1057
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:50,450
You're not gonna help me at all.

1058
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,130
Did you know that 2024...

1059
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:55,530
Wait.

1060
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:56,170
Candlejack.

1061
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,470
Still active.

1062
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,230
What's that?

1063
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:03,290
What is that?

1064
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,750
Hey.

1065
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,570
What are you doing down here?

1066
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,050
Slacker?

1067
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:05,690
Come on.

1068
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,470
Join the rest of the team.

1069
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,680
Snakes up there.

1070
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,540
What are you doing there?

1071
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I think I got everything in this area.

1072
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,740
Besides the...

1073
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,290
I think that's everything in this area.

1074
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,570
There's a pole thing.

1075
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:38,390
There is?

1076
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:47,790
Candlejack.

1077
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,530
What is that?

1078
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,630
Under the stairs?

1079
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,130
This?

1080
00:51:59,630 --> 00:51:59,890
Oh!

1081
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,490
This is just to get back.

1082
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,210
This is just gonna launch us back.

1083
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,690
It's not an actual thing.

1084
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,190
What are you slackers doing?

1085
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:09,710
Come on.

1086
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,430
But good eye.

1087
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,710
I didn't notice it.

1088
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,690
I thought it would pop out automatically.

1089
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,550
You did good.

1090
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,450
You did good.

1091
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,150
Good job snake.

1092
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:23,830
Look.

1093
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,330
They're like...

1094
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,270
They're directing.

1095
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,600
Okay.

1096
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,480
Steady.

1097
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,140
Steady.

1098
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,420
See everybody?

1099
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,280
Good job.

1100
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:40,900
Okay.

1101
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,980
Good job everyone.

1102
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,380
You're not supposed to say candlejack otherwise...

1103
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,620
Wait.

1104
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,340
What am I doing?

1105
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,820
Am I saying something?

1106
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,980
Am I getting got?

1107
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,220

1108
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,600
Beep boop.

1109
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,060
Beep boop.

1110
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,200
Oh.

1111
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,400
I guess we're leaving.

1112
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,460
He's gonna get you.

1113
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,060
What?

1114
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,200
What?

1115
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,660
It's a joke from Freakazoid.

1116
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:18,980
Oh.

1117
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:19,900
I never...

1118
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,080
I know that show.

1119
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,220
I just never really watch it.

1120
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:24,900
Beep boop.

1121
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,440
Beep boop.

1122
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:25,760
Beep boop.

1123
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,700
Snake.

1124
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,240
Snake Galaxy.

1125
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,620
Before that, let's dive on in and do some more gacha.

1126
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,200
Snake.

1127
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,660
Snake.

1128
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,760
Oh my god.

1129
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,740
The god of war bots are huge.

1130
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,160
I didn't see you for a second.

1131
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,680
My stream started buffering.

1132
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:55,900
Scary.

1133
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,940
Scary.

1134
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,800
Alright guys.

1135
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,300
Let's get something good.

1136
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,060
There's a lot of stuff in here.

1137
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,460
Oh.

1138
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,540
It just keeps on...

1139
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,700
The stream lagged after...

1140
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,020
Wait.

1141
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,280
What?

1142
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,900
Heavy roller.

1143
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,340
Striking fear into the heart of tenpins.

1144
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,140
We got...

1145
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:19,780
Is this a color?

1146
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,040
Cyber Canary Dual Speeder.

1147
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,100
Hello, sunshine.

1148
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:25,920
Cute.

1149
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Origami bird.

1150
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,160
Pray you never meet its maker.

1151
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,540
Wait.

1152
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,780
The origami killer?

1153
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,640
Uh oh.

1154
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,500
No way.

1155
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,260
No way.

1156
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:44,980
No.

1157
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,260
No.

1158
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,700
Is he in this game for real?

1159
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,620
No way.

1160
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,480
Is the origami killer in here?

1161
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,460
Wait.

1162
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,020
I don't remember getting that guy.

1163
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,500
Did we?

1164
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:00,880
Oh.

1165
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,340
Sorry.

1166
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,200
Wait.

1167
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,980
There's the origami.

1168
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:09,740
Oh.

1169
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,920
He's following me.

1170
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,620
Jason?

1171
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,400
Jason?

1172
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,960
No way.

1173
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,960
It's the real origami killer.

1174
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,020
Where's the cat?

1175
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,290
Sean?

1176
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:28,650
Sean?

1177
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,410
Oh.

1178
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,090
Can I play?

1179
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,030
Can I try again?

1180
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:36,450
Thank you.

1181
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:38,370
Yay!

1182
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,500
First try.

1183
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,340
I just saw it and went like...

1184
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,740
Before I even...

1185
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,640
Let's take off.

1186
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,100
How are you liking Astro Bot?

1187
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,600
I love Astro Bot!

1188
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,000
Now...

1189
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,000
There was...

1190
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,180
There's a few bots we're missing here.

1191
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,420
Should we try and get them?

1192
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,240
Or...

1193
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,000
Is it here?

1194
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,580
No.

1195
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,940
We're missing the portal here.

1196
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,380
Oh.

1197
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,000
The bots we're missing are...

1198
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,720
These ones.

1199
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,760
Ah.

1200
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,080
The challenge levels.

1201
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,340
Ah.

1202
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,260
The challenge...

1203
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,540
Ah.

1204
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,580
The challenge levels.

1205
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,580
Ah.

1206
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,100
The challenge levels.

1207
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,760
Oh.

1208
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,160
Oh.

1209
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:48,720
Oh.

1210
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,120
What's this?

1211
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,800
Wait.

1212
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,540
Crumble rumble!

1213
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,400
Let's try this one.

1214
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,420
Maybe at the end of the stream I'll try.

1215
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,310
Whoa.

1216
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,920
Oh my gosh.

1217
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,840
What am I supposed to...

1218
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:18,620
Ouchie!

1219
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,300
Okay.

1220
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,140
Don't do that with them.

1221
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,360
Is there a way to...

1222
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,040
Kill these guys?

1223
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,540
Okay.

1224
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,980
They don't destroy the panel.

1225
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,880
Uh...

1226
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,400
Ow!

1227
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:33,640
Oh!

1228
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,120
What?

1229
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:34,360
Can

1230
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,380
I...

1231
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,180
Can they throw fire at each other?

1232
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,020
Cut the floor around them?

1233
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:47,960
Oh...

1234
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,120
It's like literally hanging on by a thread.

1235
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,880
There we go!

1236
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,700
Ah!

1237
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,420
Oh my god.

1238
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:03,700
Please.

1239
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,480
Hey!

1240
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,140
Where are you?

1241
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,300
Pro golfer!

1242
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,260
Loves birdies!

1243
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,380
Especially eagles and albatrosses.

1244
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,780
There's a golf!

1245
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,060
Hot shots.

1246
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:25,540
Ah.

1247
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:27,900
Okay.

1248
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,420
That was easy.

1249
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,300
Yay!

1250
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,300
We got a new guy!

1251
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:34,580
Perfect.

1252
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,260
There he...

1253
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,160
goes!

1254
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,460
Sucked into my world.

1255
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,960
Um...

1256
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,580
I know this one's a portal.

1257
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,300
I know this one's a portal.

1258
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,720
No!

1259
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,300
Oh gosh!

1260
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,380
Where was the portal?

1261
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,120
Let's just go see.

1262
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,800
These levels aren't very long.

1263
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,980
So we can probably just...

1264
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,880
Find it, you know?

1265
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,440
Oh...

1266
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,840
What if I get hit?

1267
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,380
Oh!

1268
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,540
Where was it?

1269
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,100
Oh, the bird!

1270
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,540
Oh!

1271
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,500
We got that one.

1272
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,000
We got that one.

1273
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,070
I have to pay money though.

1274
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,370
Ducky, thanks for the gift!

1275
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,670
How do you do?

1276
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:20,450
Welcome to membership.

1277
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:20,990
Thank you.

1278
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:22,970
Oh wait, I already paid for...

1279
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:23,590
Oh, he's free!

1280
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,830
Come here bird.

1281
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,090
Free bird!

1282
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,530
Hey, where's the secret?

1283
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,710
Oh my gosh, that was close.

1284
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,350
Where is it, bird?

1285
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,530
Lead me!

1286
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,310
Breakable floors and futuristic setting.

1287
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,090
Really give that Crash Bash feeling.

1288
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:47,930
We're back!

1289
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:48,570
Thanks for the gift!

1290
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,590
Is it here?

1291
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,070
Oh, ouch!

1292
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:55,870
Come here.

1293
00:59:58,570 --> 00:59:59,130
Bird?

1294
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,250
Is it down here?

1295
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,170
It's at the end of the level.

1296
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:05,050
That's right!

1297
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,730
That's right!

1298
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,190
I remember.

1299
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:18,710
Oh, this one's kind of a long level.

1300
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,390
This level's a little bit longer.

1301
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,110
I'm going to have to...

1302
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,030
We're going to have to...

1303
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,530
We're going to have to...

1304
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:32,590
We're going to have to...

1305
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,230
speed run as much as I can.

1306
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,090
We got this.

1307
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,470
But we can get a bot coin.

1308
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:47,570
Oh, I got it.

1309
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:48,470
That was so easy.

1310
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:50,970
Monkey!

1311
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:53,850
Okay.

1312
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:55,890
Okay.

1313
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,340
Floor it.

1314
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,100
Okay, and this one is...

1315
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,620
Oh, uh...

1316
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,300
Oh, that's right.

1317
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,500
We do a little...

1318
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:26,820
something.

1319
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,440
Oh, I got it.

1320
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,120
Okay, there we go.

1321
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:33,640
Thanks game!

1322
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,340
And monkey smash!

1323
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,380
Monkey grab!

1324
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,740
Monkey grab, monkey grab, monkey grab, monkey grab.

1325
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,260
Okay.

1326
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,140
Destroy.

1327
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,700
Destroy.

1328
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,840
Monkey smash!

1329
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,640
Okay.

1330
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,700
Oh my gosh, this guy.

1331
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,770
I forgot he moves.

1332
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,610
I forgot he moves.

1333
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:15,890
Alright.

1334
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,010
Monkey smash!

1335
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,110
Smash.

1336
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,400
Monkey grab!

1337
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,140
Monkey grab!

1338
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,420
Monkey smash!

1339
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,580
Monkey smash!

1340
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:34,460
Monkey!

1341
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,040
Okay, monkey don't get hit.

1342
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,260
Monkey don't get hit!

1343
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,580
Monkey don't get hit!

1344
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,400
Monkey smash!

1345
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,960
How many times do I have to keep monkey smashing?

1346
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,180
I can't stop smashing!

1347
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,500
I can't stop monkey smashing!

1348
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,880
There we go.

1349
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,260
Sheesh.

1350
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,640
At least we get more coins this way, you know?

1351
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,060
Okay, monkey...

1352
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:14,820
grab!

1353
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,540
Grab...

1354
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:18,820
Monkey grab.

1355
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,360
No...

1356
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,100
Run, run, run, run.

1357
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,360
Monkey hit, monkey hit.

1358
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,120
Nice.

1359
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:26,260
Nice.

1360
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,880
Mental gaming.

1361
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,260
Okay.

1362
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,340
I have to defeat...

1363
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,940
the boss.

1364
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,500
And then once I defeat the boss, it'll open up?

1365
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,440
Is that how it was?

1366
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,600
Mental gaming.

1367
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,280
Mental gaming.

1368
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,420
Monkey

1369
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:12,920
grab.

1370
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:13,500
Monkey grab.

1371
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,160
Monkey grab.

1372
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,280
Monkey grab.

1373
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:15,860
Monkey grab.

1374
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,500
Monkey grab.

1375
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,100
Monkey grab.

1376
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,800
Do I have to defeat him again?

1377
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,120
I actually can't tell.

1378
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,960
Is my chat frozen or is...

1379
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,360
nobody talking?

1380
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,120
I can't tell.

1381
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,380
Am I still streaming?

1382
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,200
Did my stream freeze?

1383
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,130
Am I still...

1384
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,370
Am I still live?

1385
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:56,850
Am I still live?

1386
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,680
Oh, I'm live?

1387
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,120
Oh!

1388
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,180
Oh, I can see you guys!

1389
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:07,800
Okay, hold on.

1390
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:08,780
Sorry.

1391
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,000
There we go.

1392
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,380
There we go.

1393
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:10,680
There we go.

1394
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:10,880
Okay.

1395
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,180
Okay.

1396
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,380
Okay.

1397
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,280
Yeah.

1398
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,080
We're good?

1399
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:15,320
Okay.

1400
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:19,830
My chat froze.

1401
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:21,430
So...

1402
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,110
Do I have to defeat the boss again?

1403
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:24,890
Or...

1404
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:27,870
Am I good?

1405
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:29,170
Beat the boss to unlock.

1406
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,810
Where... How does he...

1407
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,190
How do I get him to come out?

1408
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:35,450
Hey!

1409
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:38,590
Hey!

1410
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,010
What?

1411
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,630
Here?

1412
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,230
Approach the...

1413
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,570
Oh!

1414
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:45,210
There he is!

1415
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:45,510
There he is!

1416
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:46,270
Woo!

1417
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,570
I have to remember how to beat this guy.

1418
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:03,720
That's right.

1419
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:05,620
Wow!

1420
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,020
Wow!

1421
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,640
And then we jump!

1422
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,080
Monkey jump!

1423
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,120
Grab!

1424
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:25,720
Monkey grab!

1425
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,220
Monkey grab!

1426
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,840
Hold on with both hands for safety.

1427
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,100
Oh my gosh.

1428
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,020
That's right.

1429
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,560
Don't get monkeyed.

1430
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,960
Don't get monkey hit.

1431
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,580
Monkey hit.

1432
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,300
Fast!

1433
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,040
Fast monkey!

1434
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:37,580
Fast monkey!

1435
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,640
And then on the back of him.

1436
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:42,920
Ah!

1437
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:43,960
Monkey!

1438
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:51,360
Monkey!

1439
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,520
Monkey jaw break!

1440
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,840
Monkey decapitation!

1441
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,840
Monkey win.

1442
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,240
There it is!

1443
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:07,480
Oh!

1444
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,560
Thanks bird for your hard work.

1445
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:14,960
Monkey murder!

1446
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,100
Oh my god.

1447
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,120
Oh my god.

1448
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,160
Riches beyond...

1449
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,980
Riches beyond comprehension!

1450
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,500
Oh!

1451
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:30,660
Oh!

1452
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:33,720
What?

1453
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,060
What do I...

1454
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,000
How do I grab...

1455
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,320
Hold on!

1456
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,080
Hold on bird!

1457
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,080
What do I get with this...

1458
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:39,900
What do I...

1459
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,900
What do I do?

1460
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,880
Oh!

1461
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:46,660
I have to throw it.

1462
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,340
Monkey crash!

1463
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,880
Oh my gosh!

1464
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,480
My trophy!

1465
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,040
My trophy!

1466
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,940
Hold on bird!

1467
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,600
We're going to disco land baby!

1468
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,940
Here we go!

1469
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,800
Oh!

1470
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,340
What are those blue gems?

1471
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,220
They're just decoration.

1472
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,020
They're just decoration.

1473
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,420
Robots don't care about actual money I think.

1474
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,380
We are...

1475
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,080
Oh!

1476
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,580
Light bulb limbo.

1477
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,340
Look!

1478
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,220
We haven't gotten this one completely.

1479
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:38,640
Oh!

1480
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:38,700
Oh!

1481
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,600
We're missing a puzzle piece.

1482
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,260
No!

1483
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,480
This one we've gotten completely.

1484
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,260
Secret!

1485
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,260
Secret!

1486
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,700
Well let's try this one.

1487
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,100
Secret!

1488
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:52,900
Secret!

1489
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,320
Oh!

1490
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,640
Oh my gosh!

1491
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,140
This is perfect for Halloween!

1492
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:11,760
Spooky!

1493
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,300
Oh!

1494
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,100
Where do I go from here?

1495
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,560
Oh thank you.

1496
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:16,780
Oh!

1497
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:21,410
Oh!

1498
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:22,570
Okay.

1499
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,690
I didn't mean to do that, but sure.

1500
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,210
Whoa!

1501
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:31,410
Frightening.

1502
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,150
Oh!

1503
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:36,570
Um...

1504
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:37,010
I got you!

1505
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:39,850
I got you!

1506
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:45,090
Destroy!

1507
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:45,830
Destroy!

1508
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:46,150
Destroy!

1509
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,070
I think I can make that.

1510
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:50,770
Oh!

1511
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:51,270
Oh!

1512
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:52,410
Oh!

1513
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,450
Ah!

1514
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:03,380
Um...

1515
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,400
I don't like that.

1516
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,420
I have to kill a ghost.

1517
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,800
Family of yours?

1518
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,280
Yeah.

1519
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,680
My grandma's side.

1520
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,700
Oh.

1521
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,780
Okay.

1522
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,230
Come here.

1523
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,350
Hey!

1524
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:28,850
Leave me alone.

1525
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,150
Sleeper face.

1526
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:32,890
I know.

1527
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:33,470
Freaky.

1528
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,370
The secret level.

1529
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:36,550
Look!

1530
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,230
I'm so scared!

1531
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:37,890
Ah!

1532
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,470
What are you so scared of?

1533
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:46,410
I just realized the colors on my monitor versus the colors on OBS, the other monitor, are so different.

1534
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,410
I wonder if they're that much different for you guys.

1535
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:52,850
Wait!

1536
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:54,650
Yay!

1537
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:55,370
Shout!

1538
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,070
I won on that.

1539
01:10:58,570 --> 01:10:59,010
Whoa!

1540
01:10:59,150 --> 01:10:59,810
This looks fun!

1541
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,710
Look at all the dead robots.

1542
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:02,470
Oh!

1543
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,010
Oh no!

1544
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:04,910
It's dead!

1545
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:05,850
The Devil May Cry!

1546
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,460
Son of Sparta!

1547
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,840
Let's rock, baby!

1548
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,640
We got Dante!

1549
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:23,500
Yes.

1550
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,180
Dante from the...

1551
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:25,300
Oh!

1552
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,500
From the Devil May Cry series.

1553
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:29,620
Nice.

1554
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,420
I hear something snoring.

1555
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:36,780
Yoisha!

1556
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,120
Is there something down there?

1557
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,840
I want to like knock the little bones off.

1558
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:46,370
Oh no.

1559
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:50,010
You're gonna be a jerk to me while I'm trying to cross, aren't you?

1560
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,890
Can I reach from here?

1561
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:55,830
Run back.

1562
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:56,490
Oh gosh.

1563
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:03,150
We're smart.

1564
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:05,770
We're smart.

1565
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:06,190
We're smart.

1566
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:06,790
We got this.

1567
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:07,890
See?

1568
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,230
We're smart.

1569
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:09,710
We're smart.

1570
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:09,790
We're smart.

1571
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:12,990
We got

1572
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:16,660
this.

1573
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,680
What the ghost doing?

1574
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,020
Eh, the ghost thing.

1575
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,560
Those things.

1576
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,060
Something's staring at me over there.

1577
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,420
I

1578
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,120
think the snoring's from in there!

1579
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:39,770
Hey!

1580
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,010
Get...

1581
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:41,770
Get out of there!

1582
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:42,350
Who is this?

1583
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,350
This chap.

1584
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,310
He's Noce...

1585
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:50,210
Noscoth, the best reputation.

1586
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:51,990
Okay?

1587
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,650
From the original?

1588
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,670
Legacy of Kain.

1589
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:54,870
Yeah,

1590
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,830
stay in there.

1591
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:04,130
Okay, I don't think that was what was snoring.

1592
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,450
I hear more.

1593
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,550
Oh my goodness.

1594
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:16,530
Maybe we...

1595
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,510
Oh, don't do that.

1596
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,370
Maybe we actually like...

1597
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,110
aim and make it.

1598
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:23,910
Maybe we should just...

1599
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:26,150
Yes!

1600
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,270
Oh my god.

1601
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:31,210
Okay.

1602
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,590
From here on...

1603
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,330
There we go.

1604
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,410
And heal.

1605
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,830
There we go, nice.

1606
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:44,570
Money.

1607
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:48,690
Secret...

1608
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,430
Look at the little spit-spitters!

1609
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,630
I hear someone going...

1610
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:59,510
Who is snoring over there?

1611
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:00,110
Oh.

1612
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,120
A fake coin!

1613
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,580
It's bouncing around and everything like...

1614
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,140
Oh my gosh.

1615
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,360
It knows it's a fake coin.

1616
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,600
At least it gives me real coins.

1617
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,260
Who is snoring over there?

1618
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,140
A mimic.

1619
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:32,660
Real.

1620
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,560
Mimic real.

1621
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:35,920
Who are you?

1622
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:36,860
Wait.

1623
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,600
Huh?

1624
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,320
Uh...

1625
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,120
Hold on.

1626
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,080
Hold on!

1627
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:43,640
Oh.

1628
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,300
Where...

1629
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,380
Where's the entrance?

1630
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:49,920
What?

1631
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,240
Uh...

1632
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,860
I think maybe I have to go in from the top?

1633
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,320
Oh, it's that right there!

1634
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:58,920
He's snoring!

1635
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,620
Can I get over there?

1636
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,520
Can I get over there?

1637
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,380
Can I get over there?

1638
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:06,620
Can I get over there?

1639
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,440
Save my boy!

1640
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,260
I'm trying.

1641
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,380
Save my boy!

1642
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,110
Jump to him.

1643
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,170
Afraid I might fall.

1644
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:23,050
Oh!

1645
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,850
Oh okay.

1646
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,990
Oh no.

1647
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,320
First,

1648
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,240
okay there we go.

1649
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,100
See guys, easy.

1650
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:48,600
See guys, easy.

1651
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,260
Nothing is too late.

1652
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,580
Nothing is too late.

1653
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,040
It's too late.

1654
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,720
Nothing is too late.

1655
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,680
Nothing is too late.

1656
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:15,320
When you don't succeed, try, try again.

1657
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,720
Wake up!

1658
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,120
Nice.

1659
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:23,800
He's like, I'm alert!

1660
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:24,600
I'm alert!

1661
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,240
Why did you jump off?

1662
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:26,960
So I could do that.

1663
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,000
See?

1664
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,740
Now for the puzzle piece!

1665
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:42,160
It's everybody!

1666
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,130
Resurrected Wraith.

1667
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,770
You can't keep a good vamp down.

1668
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:08,530
Oh my god, look!

1669
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:09,270
It's you guys!

1670
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:10,250
Oh, sorry.

1671
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:12,710
Oh no, they're little mushrooms!

1672
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,210
Oh my god, all these dead robots.

1673
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:16,670
How'd they die?

1674
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:19,130
They're little ghost mushrooms!

1675
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,590
They're so cute!

1676
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,690
I'm giving you love punches.

1677
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:31,330
Oh.

1678
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,190
Oh.

1679
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,910
Okay.

1680
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,010
Oh, I almost went.

1681
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,690
That should be a gold.

1682
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:51,210
That should be a gold flag, right?

1683
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:51,510
Yeah!

1684
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,350
It's only this one.

1685
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,350
We missed a puzzle piece.

1686
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:06,890
Secret.

1687
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,820
I don't know what's taunting me.

1688
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,600
Let's see.

1689
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,300
We got here.

1690
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,180
So...

1691
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,280
I've done everything but enter this new galaxy.

1692
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,620
We gotta go in here, guys.

1693
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:39,660
Oh my god, that's me on my memory card.

1694
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:43,740
Listen to me.

1695
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:46,740
Oh shoot, we're going gambling, guys.

1696
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,940
Let's go gambling!

1697
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,200
And the challenge level, I know.

1698
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:54,260
Oh no.

1699
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh gosh.

1700
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,420
Where's the casino?

1701
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,200
Ouch!

1702
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:06,120
Oh, okay.

1703
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,040
My bad.

1704
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:07,560
Excuse me.

1705
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,480
There it is, I see it.

1706
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,960
I see the casino.

1707
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,440
Slowmo Casino.

1708
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,780
This level's fun?

1709
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:17,940
Okay, I'm so excited.

1710
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:19,640
Oh!

1711
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,240
Are you okay?

1712
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,120
You almost died!

1713
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,220
Oh my god!

1714
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,440
The truck is like, how do I get out of here?

1715
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,120
What is this?

1716
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,800
Oh, it said... oh my gosh, we're in VR.

1717
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:48,060
It said slow-mo, do we... so...

1718
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:50,580
Run!

1719
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,350
Oh my god.

1720
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:01,410
These are my dice.

1721
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:03,150
These are my dice.

1722
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:08,290
This is so... oh my god, look at all of them go!

1723
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,670
Oh my god!

1724
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:14,890
No wonder it's so easy to have an accident here!

1725
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,370
Oh my gosh!

1726
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,330
What are the little...

1727
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,070
ferrets?

1728
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,260
Can I get on top?

1729
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,060
Oh nice, I can.

1730
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,320
Can I get on top?

1731
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:30,980
Oh nice, I can.

1732
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,840
I can't.

1733
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:45,250
Anything else?

1734
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:46,450
Oh, there's more stuff over here.

1735
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:52,030
Okay...

1736
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,150
Wait, what if I...

1737
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,510
How do I use the slow-mo again?

1738
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:57,390
Oh, here we go.

1739
01:20:58,150 --> 01:20:59,010
Oh, oh gosh.

1740
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,030
Oh, oh gosh!

1741
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,010
Oh!

1742
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,450
Oh!

1743
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:03,370
Okay, okay, okay.

1744
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:04,470
I think I gotta...

1745
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:08,050
Have to use this gimmick a lot, yeah.

1746
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:09,910
Okay.

1747
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:10,990
Up, up, wait, up-see!

1748
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:11,810
Up-see!

1749
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,490
Oh god, bot wants up-ees, please!

1750
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:18,490
Bot!

1751
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,070
Bot wants up-ees, please!

1752
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,970
Oh gosh.

1753
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:22,630
Okay.

1754
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,520
Oh, oh my god, I suck at this.

1755
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,480
My depth perception.

1756
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,820
Can I make this?

1757
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,060
Oh, I can!

1758
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,460
Oh, I did it!

1759
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,020
Oh wait, was there anything up there?

1760
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,260
Okay, there's something on that side.

1761
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,040
I feel like there's gotta be something here.

1762
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,400
I don't think I see anything up there.

1763
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,840
Oh, guess I do!

1764
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,040
Oh, I do see things up there!

1765
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,740
Um, okay, oh.

1766
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:10,860
I gotta let it recharge, I think.

1767
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,460
Oh, oh, oh gosh.

1768
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:16,560
Uh...

1769
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,480
Uhhh...

1770
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,750
Is that how I do it?

1771
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:24,230
I like...

1772
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,870
Use the dolphins as...

1773
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:33,090
Oh, um... I think I did too early.

1774
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:35,130
Oh, maybe not?

1775
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:36,290
Ah, no!

1776
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:36,470
No!

1777
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:40,190
This one's tricky.

1778
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:43,930
Oh, so close.

1779
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:51,100
Okay.

1780
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,960
Nice!

1781
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,520
We got him, baby!

1782
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,060
We got him, baby.

1783
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,200
Come in, normal guy.

1784
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,420
Little normie.

1785
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:05,440
Little normal man.

1786
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,320
Normbo.

1787
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,660
He's just a normal guy.

1788
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:13,960
Alright, nice.

1789
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,480
We shmovin'?

1790
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:15,960
Oh, oops.

1791
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:16,920
Just gotta...

1792
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,220
Into the casino!

1793
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,000
Oh, thank you.

1794
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:23,000
I'm a distinguished guest.

1795
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:23,440
Thank you.

1796
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:24,300
Thank you, thank you.

1797
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,760
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1798
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:27,700
Woah!

1799
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,520
I missed one?

1800
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,740
What do you mean I missed one?

1801
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,400
I missed a guy already?

1802
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,500
Am I getting one guide?

1803
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:43,940
I am?

1804
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:44,320
Okay.

1805
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,460
Stop one-guying me!

1806
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,180
Gosh.

1807
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:50,720
Ahhhh!

1808
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:51,880
Oh my god.

1809
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,420
Ready...

1810
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:55,580
Stop!

1811
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:56,560
Aw.

1812
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,000
Ready...

1813
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:02,620
Steady...

1814
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,600
Stop!

1815
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,620
Come on.

1816
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,640
Are all of these bad options?

1817
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:08,840
Oh, wait.

1818
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,100
I forgot.

1819
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,880
I have a slow-mo.

1820
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,060
Haha, I can cheat.

1821
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,380
Oh, dang it!

1822
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,520
I can cheat.

1823
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:33,970
Where do I have to reach up and grab him?

1824
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,260
Three, two, one, go!

1825
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:43,980
Ah!

1826
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,320
I got him!

1827
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:45,660
I got him!

1828
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:45,940
I got him!

1829
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,320
I got him!

1830
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:46,720
I got him!

1831
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,720
Thank you!

1832
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,040
Thank you!

1833
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:51,420
Thank you!

1834
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,120
Ah, dang it!

1835
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,280
Ah, dang it!

1836
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:55,880
Hey, monkey!

1837
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,840
This is my game!

1838
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,560
Is there anything here?

1839
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,140
Slow...

1840
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1841
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,000
Oh, oops.

1842
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,870
I don't know how to do slots, you guys.

1843
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:11,330
Ha!

1844
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:11,990
Oh.

1845
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,610
One, two...

1846
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,050
Oh!

1847
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,790
Oh!

1848
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:17,810
Ah!

1849
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:18,810
Oh!

1850
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,970
I was...

1851
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:20,350
Um...

1852
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:20,790
Ha!

1853
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:21,610
Ha!

1854
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:22,210
Ha!

1855
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:23,350
Oh, gosh!

1856
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:23,790
Ah!

1857
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:24,650
Hey!

1858
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,150
Ha!

1859
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:25,930
Duh!

1860
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,100
Oh, where's my little man?

1861
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,480
You own a slot machine.

1862
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,360
It's different!

1863
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,400
I don't own a...

1864
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,000
Oh, I do own a slot machine.

1865
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:37,460
You're right.

1866
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,100
Um...

1867
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,000
Sorry.

1868
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:45,080
I was going to say it's not a pachinko machine because everyone calls it a pachinko machine.

1869
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,560
You're right.

1870
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,340
It's a slot machine.

1871
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,500
Oh, my gosh.

1872
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:51,840
Okay.

1873
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,140
Well, that's it.

1874
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:53,520
Let's go, game.

1875
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:53,920
Ah!

1876
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:56,540
Sorry.

1877
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,280
I

1878
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,280
feel like I'm cheating, though.

1879
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:13,840
I want to play...

1880
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,840
I want to play with my real luck, okay?

1881
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,900
I'm going to close my eyes.

1882
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,400
I'm going to close my eyes and I'm going to hit it.

1883
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:19,980
Oh.

1884
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:34,920
Oh, I was so close.

1885
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,600
I want to do real gambling, you guys.

1886
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,080
Gamble!

1887
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,180
No!

1888
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:57,900
Gamble!

1889
01:26:59,220 --> 01:26:59,580
No!

1890
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,370
No!

1891
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:02,890
No!

1892
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:03,530
Gamble!

1893
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:04,290
No!

1894
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:04,550
Gamble!

1895
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,090
Gamble!

1896
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,070
Gamble!

1897
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,070
Gamble!

1898
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:07,130
Gamble!

1899
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:07,570
Gamble!

1900
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:07,770
Gamble!

1901
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:09,150
My own

1902
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:17,740
intuition.

1903
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,380
I won't get it from... from cheating.

1904
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,060
Let's go gambling!

1905
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:23,680
Yeah!

1906
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,740
Dang it!

1907
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:26,280
Dang it!

1908
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:26,560
Dang it!

1909
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:26,980
Oh...

1910
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:28,900
Financial...

1911
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,460
Ah!

1912
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,260
AHHHHHHHHH!

1913
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:31,920
RESPONSIBILITIES!

1914
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,820
BE DAMNED!

1915
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:35,900
AHHHHHHHHH!

1916
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,330
3, 2, 1...

1917
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:43,610
Oh my gosh.

1918
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,390
Okay, I give up.

1919
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:49,870
That

1920
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,560
was basically my own ability.

1921
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,540
Yeah,

1922
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:12,010
monkeys, you don't get the satisfaction.

1923
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:14,990
In the end, it was a skill issue.

1924
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:17,550
Never has been, never has been, never has been.

1925
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:25,170
There are so many animals in this place.

1926
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:26,890
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1927
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:27,350
Stop, stop.

1928
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:32,980
Oh, nice.

1929
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,520
Can I make it over there?

1930
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,020
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1931
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:44,940
Yippee!

1932
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,400
Now can I make it on top of these?

1933
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,080
Yippee!

1934
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,420
Now can I make it on top of these?

1935
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,340
Grab all that cash money, baby.

1936
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,780
What is that guy zooming around there for?

1937
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:05,570
What is this?

1938
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,330
What are the lyrics?

1939
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:07,630
Something the slot machine.

1940
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:19,850
Sorry, I thought I would spin around with it.

1941
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,830
I thought I would also go spinning.

1942
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:26,790
Wait a second, do I have to do that all over again?

1943
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:28,830
Wait a second, do I have to do that all over again?

1944
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:32,250
99% of gamblers give up before cheating.

1945
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,770
Wait, do I have to do this all over again?

1946
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:56,810
No, you guys, I got cheated.

1947
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,270
Your coins get saved, but they're still up there.

1948
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:08,760
Huh?

1949
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:10,700
I got cheated.

1950
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,520
I didn't have enough juice.

1951
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,120
Maybe I have to lose.

1952
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:33,260
Huh.

1953
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:41,070
That's so weird that it doesn't give it to you again.

1954
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:43,590
Oh.

1955
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,800
And...

1956
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:50,380
See, I would have hit it then anyway.

1957
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,640
Hm.

1958
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,700
Hm.

1959
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:07,840
Hm.

1960
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,140
Hm.

1961
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,660
Hm.

1962
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:12,080
Hm.

1963
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,740
Hm.

1964
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,660
Hm.

1965
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:22,480
Hm.

1966
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:22,960
Hm.

1967
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:27,160
He's lost his will to live because he's lost so many times.

1968
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,080
Your coins don't get saved unless you checkpoint.

1969
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,720
Oh, see, that's what I'm saying.

1970
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,960
So I did lose those coins because...

1971
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,540
Wait, that's so sad.

1972
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,640
I lost my coins.

1973
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,380
Because it wouldn't give me the little thing again.

1974
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:46,500
What?

1975
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,180
No.

1976
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:48,420
No.

1977
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,000
That's so not fair.

1978
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,900
I'm not being greedy.

1979
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,860
I'm wanting to do more gacha.

1980
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,600
Oh, I can't...

1981
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,040
Oh, wait.

1982
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:02,920
There we go.

1983
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,880
More gacha.

1984
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:23,860
Oh my gosh.

1985
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,640
Oh, it's this thing again.

1986
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,860
Wait, what am I supposed to do with you?

1987
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,960
Oh, I need you over here.

1988
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:32,900
Uh...

1989
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,900
I need you over here.

1990
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,940
Excuse me.

1991
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,640
Thank you.

1992
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:39,840
Holy cow.

1993
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,240
Oh my god, these go so fast.

1994
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,780
Is there anything that I missed?

1995
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,260
Let's take a little look around.

1996
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:49,700
A puzzle piece.

1997
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:53,900
Oh, oopsie.

1998
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,700
I got too excited.

1999
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,000
I got too excited.

2000
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,480
Oops.

2001
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,620
Oh, it's this way.

2002
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:02,920
Okay.

2003
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:03,140
Okay.

2004
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,200
Puzzle piece.

2005
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:05,400
Puzzle piece.

2006
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:05,800
Puzzle piece.

2007
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:07,660
Nice.

2008
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:09,440
Hey!

2009
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:14,260
It pays to look.

2010
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:17,840
Oh my gosh.

2011
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,000
If you fall though, you die.

2012
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,500
If you fall, you're dead.

2013
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,500
You're donezo.

2014
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,040
Ah!

2015
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,140
Just like that.

2016
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,300
Oh, uh...

2017
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:33,540
Oops.

2018
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:34,140
Okay.

2019
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,060
Okay.

2020
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,100
Oh.

2021
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,340
Oh.

2022
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:47,950
Oh.

2023
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:48,850
Oh.

2024
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,410
Oh.

2025
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:51,410
What is going on here?

2026
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:53,310
What the hell?

2027
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,030
We're fine.

2028
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:01,290
We made it.

2029
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:01,870
We're good.

2030
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,100
Parkour.

2031
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,380
Fastest parkour in the West.

2032
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,400
Got it.

2033
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,920
Oh my God.

2034
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,660
Oh my God.

2035
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:38,140
Oh my God.

2036
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:38,520
Oh my God.

2037
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:38,840
Oh my God.

2038
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:38,900
Oh my God.

2039
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,140
Die!

2040
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,420
Oh my God.

2041
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:42,980
Oh my God.

2042
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,000
We made it.

2043
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,280
You guys.

2044
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,540
What is your card?

2045
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,340
Oh wait.

2046
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:55,540
No.

2047
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,620
Don't tell me what your card is.

2048
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,240
Oh.

2049
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,520
Sorry.

2050
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,920
Don't tell me what your card is.

2051
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,760
Don't tell me what your card is.

2052
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,480
Is this your card?

2053
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,980
A queen of hearts!

2054
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:10,760
Alright then.

2055
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,400
So, you crash on those 16 cards.

2056
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,940
I'm the very second Queen of Hearts!

2057
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:26,000
Magic, baby.

2058
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,100
Magic, baby.

2059
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,000
What is that goober doing over there?

2060
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,480
What are you doing?

2061
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:46,400
Do you make like a... Oh my god.

2062
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:06,570
Oops, sorry.

2063
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:12,230
Shoot.

2064
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,580
Almost gaming.

2065
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,920
Yeah, I almost gamed.

2066
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:25,870
Oh come on!

2067
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:40,490
Wait, there's a puzzle piece down there!

2068
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,470
Oh, okay.

2069
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:48,790
Actually that was good, that was good.

2070
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:53,030
Okay, now we know to get back into the middle once we're done.

2071
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:53,490
Okay.

2072
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:58,450
Nice.

2073
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,510
We're gaming, we're gaming, we're gaming.

2074
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:04,070
We're gaming, we're gaming, we're gaming!

2075
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,310
Puzzle piece behind the chameleon.

2076
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:09,830
He didn't even have to tell me.

2077
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:10,710
Alright, guys.

2078
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,070
Is your heart... card?

2079
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,990
I didn't mean to say heart.

2080
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,450
I was saying...

2081
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,400
Is your card the Queen of Hearts?

2082
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:32,840
Wait.

2083
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,100
Wait,

2084
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,050
this one, this one.

2085
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,030
This is the one I was trying to hit.

2086
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:42,290
What?

2087
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:43,770
Don't look at that one.

2088
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:44,230
Wait.

2089
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:49,370
Is your card the Queen of Hearts?

2090
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,380
Oh, I see coins over there.

2091
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:06,380
Okay, don't let me forget the coins over there, guys.

2092
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,140
Oh.

2093
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:23,740
I should have landed on the pieces, huh?

2094
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:23,940
Uh -huh.

2095
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:35,060
Oh, I'm gonna have to get this coin... or this piece again.

2096
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,660
Oh wait, no, I don't have to get it, but I have to get the coin again.

2097
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,160
You know what?

2098
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:38,760
Screw the coin.

2099
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:39,320
Sorry, guys.

2100
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,960
I'm just gonna do what I did before.

2101
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:49,450
Take it this time!

2102
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:53,410
Look behind the respawn area here.

2103
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:54,650
Oh!

2104
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:54,970
Oh!

2105
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:58,870
Oh, shoot.

2106
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:00,810
How do I get to him?

2107
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:11,470
Uh...

2108
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:13,950
Uh...

2109
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:14,650
One second!

2110
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:16,130
I'll figure it out!

2111
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:17,270
Oh!

2112
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:17,850
Oh, it's here!

2113
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:19,030
This is it.

2114
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:22,650
Thank you!

2115
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:24,390
Thank you!

2116
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:27,370
Oh, it's Sly!

2117
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:29,330
Ringtail thief!

2118
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:30,930
A master of taking things on!

2119
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:31,690
I'm the Sly!

2120
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:32,570
Sly Cooper!

2121
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:32,890
Yeah!

2122
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:35,250
Oh, thank you, guys.

2123
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:37,890
Even though I hate this part.

2124
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:41,910
Oh, because I'm not very good at it.

2125
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:44,470
Oh, gosh!

2126
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:45,690
Okay.

2127
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:50,550
Three, two, one.

2128
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:53,390
Oh, don't get underneath the thing.

2129
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:54,330
That will help.

2130
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:55,530
Come on!

2131
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:55,990
There we go.

2132
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:56,410
Nice.

2133
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:58,310
And...

2134
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,370
Now!

2135
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:02,490
Destroy!

2136
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:03,370
Destroy!

2137
01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:04,290
Destroy!

2138
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,090
Get more coins.

2139
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:09,990
Thank you!

2140
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:11,970
What?

2141
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:18,690
What?

2142
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:22,760
I got his butt!

2143
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,480
Oh, shoot!

2144
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,040
Ow!

2145
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:29,420
Shoot!

2146
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:30,280
Oh, shoot!

2147
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:30,980
I have to...

2148
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:31,640
Ow!

2149
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,520
I got him.

2150
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,120
I got it.

2151
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:37,560
I got it.

2152
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:37,880
We're fine.

2153
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:38,500
First try!

2154
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,020
First try!

2155
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:39,480
First try!

2156
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:39,840
First try!

2157
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,440
See?

2158
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,380
Confetti!

2159
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,020
Confetti!

2160
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:42,680
Confetti!

2161
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:50,790
Oh, I didn't notice the chameleon.

2162
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:54,450
Oh, don't forget the coins!

2163
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:54,930
Thanks!

2164
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:00,290
Thank you.

2165
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,290
Oh, my gosh!

2166
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:05,410
Coins!

2167
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:07,350
Okay, I'll get you second.

2168
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:09,810
All right.

2169
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,220
Normie rescued!

2170
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:20,800
Oh, my gosh!

2171
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,300
Okay.

2172
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,500
We gotta avoid this guy.

2173
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,640
While also...

2174
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,040
Oh, my gosh!

2175
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:28,800
He shoots chameleons!

2176
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,200
While also being on the dice.

2177
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:33,780
Okay.

2178
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:35,140
This is a little dicey.

2179
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,060
Oh, what the hell?

2180
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,140
Oh, you guys!

2181
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:41,560
Oh, you guys!

2182
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,200
You guys!

2183
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,240
Can we still get him?

2184
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:48,980
Or...

2185
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,220
Okay.

2186
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:50,420
Good.

2187
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:50,780
Good.

2188
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:51,840
Yeah.

2189
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:52,520
We still got it.

2190
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:52,780
Okay.

2191
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:53,020
Good.

2192
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,580
Bad roll.

2193
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:56,340
For real.

2194
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:58,740
Oh,

2195
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:14,520
my gosh!

2196
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,520
He just keeps going.

2197
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,320
He just keeps going.

2198
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:17,540
Okay.

2199
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:21,540
We're gonna have to wait for the dice to be close to each other and him...

2200
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:22,920
Okay.

2201
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:37,980
Go for it.

2202
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:39,680
Here we go.

2203
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:44,180
Nice.

2204
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:45,900
I got him.

2205
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:47,240
Don't worry, guys.

2206
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,180
Don't worry.

2207
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,360
I got him.

2208
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:50,820
I got him.

2209
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:51,340
I got him.

2210
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:51,680
Don't worry.

2211
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:51,940
I got him.

2212
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,860
Where's the... where's the save point?

2213
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:02,320
Where are we going?

2214
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,090
What the heck is that?

2215
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:12,670
What is going on here?

2216
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:15,690
Do I fall in there?

2217
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:17,530
This seems nervous.

2218
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:18,570
It's a pool?

2219
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:19,430
Oh!

2220
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:21,390
Secret!

2221
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:21,990
Secret!

2222
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,270
Oh!

2223
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,550
Secret!

2224
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:30,610
What?

2225
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:33,850
Dice tumbler!

2226
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:34,650
They're on a roll!

2227
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:37,070
That was it?

2228
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:42,750
There's coins and stuff in there.

2229
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:43,130
There's...

2230
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:43,890
I see more...

2231
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:44,690
I see more money.

2232
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:45,330
I see more money.

2233
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,480
So, it doesn't matter if I...

2234
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:51,780
Oh!

2235
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:51,940
No!

2236
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:54,620
Back inside.

2237
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:55,020
Okay.

2238
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,120
Okay.

2239
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:56,600
Okay.

2240
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:58,540
Secret!

2241
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:01,220
Oh!

2242
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,580
I just have to hit them with my fist.

2243
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:02,920
Okay.

2244
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,900
This is strange.

2245
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:08,340
Okay.

2246
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,240
Nobody can play dice game.

2247
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,540
It's like it's not...

2248
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:18,240
It doesn't play the secret music anymore.

2249
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,000
All right.

2250
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,460
I think we got everything over here.

2251
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:26,300
Very good.

2252
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:26,600
Okay.

2253
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,480
Back we go.

2254
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,920
And over to here.

2255
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,500
Here?

2256
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:36,920
Oh!

2257
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:37,120
Good.

2258
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:37,420
Okay.

2259
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,540
There's our...

2260
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,400
There's our...

2261
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,300
First try?

2262
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,660
There's our save point.

2263
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:52,840
Oh!

2264
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:53,520
This guy sucks!

2265
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:55,420
Oh!

2266
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:55,800
Come on!

2267
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,220
You suck!

2268
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,580
Come on!

2269
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,020
Oh!

2270
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,180
That's too slow.

2271
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:06,730
Nice!

2272
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:10,920
Oh gosh!

2273
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:21,850
And...

2274
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:22,570
Oh!

2275
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:25,390
Right on it.

2276
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:26,230
See if there's something there?

2277
01:45:26,490 --> 01:45:28,050
I do see...

2278
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:28,190
Oh!

2279
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:37,630
I see money.

2280
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:40,970
And...

2281
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:50,980
Oh!

2282
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:51,320
Come on!

2283
01:45:57,370 --> 01:45:59,010
We got the money!

2284
01:45:59,030 --> 01:45:59,070
Oh!

2285
01:45:59,090 --> 01:45:59,210
We got the money!

2286
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:04,500
Gosh!

2287
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:07,720
There's so many tiny things in this game you got to pay attention to.

2288
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:10,660
Okay.

2289
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,520
All right.

2290
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:13,820
This guy kind of sucks.

2291
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:14,720
I don't...

2292
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,320
I really don't want to do that again.

2293
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,040
But I think I might have to.

2294
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,320
I think I'll probably mess it up again, you guys.

2295
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:22,340
I'm just going to say it.

2296
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,520
What's happening?

2297
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:23,820
Oh!

2298
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:24,140
Oh!

2299
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,220
You're a genius.

2300
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,420
That's not just something you can say lightly, okay?

2301
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,260
Not everyone can just say, I'm a genius.

2302
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,500
You know?

2303
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:38,760
Like...

2304
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:39,280
Oh!

2305
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:40,100
Kill him!

2306
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:40,400
Kill him!

2307
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:51,880
Fine!

2308
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,100
I'm a genius too.

2309
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:54,920
I did it first try.

2310
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:56,120
Ha ha ha ha!

2311
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,460
You guys!

2312
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,240
Is!

2313
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,740
Your card!

2314
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,100
This!

2315
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,380
Eight of diamonds!

2316
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,320
Ten of spades.

2317
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:10,300
No, it wasn't!

2318
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:19,920
Persona!

2319
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:21,380
Oh, shoot.

2320
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:21,860
Oh, shoot.

2321
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:23,260
Oh, shoot.

2322
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:23,340
Oh, shoot.

2323
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:27,220
Fly!

2324
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,020
Rescue!

2325
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,060
We got all of them!

2326
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,440
Phantom Thief!

2327
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:46,760
You'll never see him coming!!!

2328
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:47,020
Hahaha!

2329
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,860
You're so cute!

2330
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:52,320
Joker...

2331
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,340
You'll never see him coming!

2332
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,280
Boing!

2333
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,580
So...

2334
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:02,020
Now it's...

2335
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:02,340
Oh, no.

2336
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,580
It's still sending two of them.

2337
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,420
We're still sending two of them.

2338
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:05,100
Just a little...

2339
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:17,340
Maybe here?

2340
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:25,160
Have you played any of the Persona games?

2341
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,300
I played a tiny bit of P4.

2342
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,080
But I...

2343
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,260
actually never played so much.

2344
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,840
For some reason I couldn't really like get into them.

2345
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,020
I'm not really good with turn-based combat.

2346
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,980
Too much thank you.

2347
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:54,700
Please.

2348
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:55,720
Please!

2349
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:00,800
Wait,

2350
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,720
how am I supposed to do this?

2351
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:18,990
Big money!

2352
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,620
You gave me platforms, but could you just move them a little bit closer?

2353
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,380
Okay, that's fine.

2354
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,500
This is Vegas, baby.

2355
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,140
They're trying to kill everybody who wins.

2356
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,160
They're like, winner!

2357
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:43,020
Not on our watch.

2358
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:47,400
Oh gosh.

2359
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,260
Oh gosh.

2360
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:48,780
Okay.

2361
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,520
Can you not freak out right now, please?

2362
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:55,220
I'm scared.

2363
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,080
Okay.

2364
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:57,540
Oh!

2365
01:49:57,640 --> 01:49:58,200
I made it.

2366
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:01,820
Uh, I guess I don't need that platform.

2367
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,500
The house always wins.

2368
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,000
Exactly.

2369
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:10,040
They're like, yes, you won.

2370
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:15,280
I'm having to play American Warrior, American Ninja Warrior over here.

2371
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:18,720
To get my riches.

2372
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:22,880
Oh my God.

2373
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,660
And then they put me up against the Mafia.

2374
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,060
Hopefully there was nothing on that.

2375
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,720
I'm worried I missed something, but...

2376
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:32,300
Oh, what the?

2377
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:38,340
Nice.

2378
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:38,700
Nice.

2379
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:44,560
I

2380
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:54,510
don't know what I'm supposed to press the button for.

2381
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:57,110
But I'm just going to keep doing this.

2382
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:01,310
To make sure... How do I do the map again?

2383
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:03,850
We're missing a puzzle piece.

2384
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:07,230
Oh no, you guys.

2385
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:08,810
We're missing a puzzle piece!

2386
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:15,800
No!

2387
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:23,730
Puzzle piece doko.

2388
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:27,910
Table games and slot machines.

2389
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:31,890
Oh my God.

2390
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:32,250
No!

2391
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,130
We missed a puzzle piece.

2392
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,820
That platform down there.

2393
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,140
The one that I missed on accident.

2394
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:52,260
I don't think so though.

2395
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:57,280
Where could it have been?

2396
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:58,960
It's probably hidden somewhere.

2397
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:05,620
Wait a second.

2398
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:05,860
Oh!

2399
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:06,960
I see it!

2400
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:08,820
You see those coins down there?

2401
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,380
I see it!

2402
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,720
I think that's probably where it is.

2403
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,800
Oh gosh.

2404
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:13,980
Oh gosh.

2405
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,460
No way.

2406
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:24,420
If I just jump, I could probably make it.

2407
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:28,960
Yeah.

2408
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,440
Okay.

2409
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:31,480
Oh God.

2410
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,460
Oh, I see it!

2411
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,240
I see it!

2412
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:34,740
I see it!

2413
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,200
Wait.

2414
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:39,580
Okay.

2415
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:43,260
No, I keep missing.

2416
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:46,140
Ah!

2417
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:46,920
I keep missing.

2418
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:01,000
I somehow made it.

2419
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:02,200
I somehow made it.

2420
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,080
I somehow made it.

2421
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:03,900
I somehow made it.

2422
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:05,420
I don't think I got all the coins.

2423
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,000
Maybe I did.

2424
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:07,800
Who knows?

2425
01:53:14,410 --> 01:53:15,070
Minto Gaming!

2426
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:16,770
Minto Gaming!

2427
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:20,690
I'm a platformer gamer now!

2428
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:22,310
Oh no.

2429
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:23,630
I definitely did not get all the coins.

2430
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:28,890
Table games and slot machines and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

2431
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:30,730
Now I am.

2432
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:34,370
Completionist.

2433
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:38,130
Oh!

2434
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:38,450
Ah!

2435
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:38,830
Yeah!

2436
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:39,530
There we go.

2437
01:53:40,690 --> 01:53:41,390
Minto Gaming.

2438
01:53:42,150 --> 01:53:43,470
Guys, now we have to get back there.

2439
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:47,610
Now we have to get all the way back to the top!

2440
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:54,010
If you die, does it work?

2441
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:55,070
But all my money!

2442
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:09,310
Money!

2443
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:14,490
20 stairs?

2444
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:17,010
Are you sure?

2445
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:20,210
I can't remember where the last checkpoint was, though.

2446
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:20,730
I'll be honest.

2447
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:23,170
I can't remember if it was up there or not.

2448
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:25,390
I can't remember.

2449
01:54:28,050 --> 01:54:28,630
It's fine.

2450
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:29,030
Oh.

2451
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:30,830
Let's redo that.

2452
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:31,270
Reach up to the top.

2453
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:31,410
Reshuffle?

2454
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:31,670
Reshuffle?

2455
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:33,790
And...

2456
01:54:35,950 --> 01:54:36,470
It's okay.

2457
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:38,670
It wasn't that far of a jump.

2458
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:41,090
It wasn't that far.

2459
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:41,690
We're fine.

2460
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:42,390
We're fine, probably.

2461
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,660
Time to find out where we...

2462
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:53,880
See?

2463
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,060
You guys, I would have to do this anyway.

2464
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:04,300
I farm coins by restarting levels without reaching checkpoints, so I think they don't disappear.

2465
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:04,840
Oh, really?

2466
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:06,020
Oh, okay.

2467
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:11,020
Well, I'd have to redo this part anyway, so...

2468
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:14,890
Okay.

2469
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,380
Oh my god.

2470
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:20,000
I got the same.

2471
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,080
Damn.

2472
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,500
Oh my god.

2473
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:26,540
Oh, wait.

2474
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,040
Okay.

2475
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:40,160
Last bit.

2476
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:40,780
Last bit.

2477
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:46,600
Nice.

2478
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:48,920
Gaming.

2479
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:49,480
Okay.

2480
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:50,960
Okay.

2481
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,200
Oh.

2482
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,820
Joker, what are you doing?

2483
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:02,980
Huh?

2484
01:56:12,710 --> 01:56:14,390
Gold flag?

2485
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:15,830
I think?

2486
01:56:17,110 --> 01:56:17,950
Probably?

2487
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:18,830
Yeah.

2488
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:22,610
Do we go monkey?

2489
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:25,130
Or do we go iron giant?

2490
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:28,050
Free Big Brother.

2491
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:31,950
Bathhouse, bathhouse, bathhouse.

2492
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:36,590
I've always wanted a brother.

2493
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:48,210
I've always wanted a brother.

2494
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:50,930
There's a lot.

2495
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:53,650
And actually, there's the same in both.

2496
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:54,150
You know what?

2497
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:54,970
Let's just go to brother first.

2498
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:57,090
I've always wanted a brother.

2499
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:00,510
Bathhouse because of yesterday's stream.

2500
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:01,170
Oh.

2501
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:02,650
Oh my god.

2502
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:05,930
He really looks like the iron giant though, doesn't he?

2503
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,030
Thank you.

2504
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,310
Oh my god.

2505
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:10,430
He's covered in parasites.

2506
01:57:10,610 --> 01:57:11,210
This is horrible.

2507
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:20,740
Why is the music like... it's too chill for what's going on here.

2508
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,120
Hey.

2509
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:21,920
Leave him alone.

2510
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:23,460
Yeah.

2511
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:25,680
Brother.

2512
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,180
Okay.

2513
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:27,760
Oh my god.

2514
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:28,640
We have a little umbrella.

2515
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,360
It's too cute.

2516
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:31,680
Hey, buddy.

2517
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,500
They chained him up.

2518
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,940
They chained up our brother.

2519
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:39,900
The little umbrella is too cute.

2520
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:40,360
Oh.

2521
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,200
Wow.

2522
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:43,040
Okay.

2523
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:44,000
You know what?

2524
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:50,140
I say like that's so obvious but that's also... it seems very easy to miss at the same time.

2525
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,180
If I...

2526
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,820
Can I swim in this level?

2527
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:58,490
I can.

2528
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:00,310
Oh.

2529
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:00,910
I'm very fast.

2530
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,020
Where are you taking me?

2531
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:07,780
Bird.

2532
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,640
Where are you taking me, bird?

2533
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:09,680
Bird.

2534
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:11,000
Where are you taking me, bird?

2535
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:11,860
Bird.

2536
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:12,400
What are you...

2537
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:13,160
What are you doing?

2538
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:16,920
What am I...

2539
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:17,300
What am I doing?

2540
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:18,560
Oh.

2541
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:20,820
Oh.

2542
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:21,020
Where am I?

2543
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:33,870
I think this is a different way to get over here.

2544
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:40,460
Oh my god.

2545
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:40,820
Oh.

2546
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:41,460
That scared me.

2547
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:46,220
Okay.

2548
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:49,140
There's a lot we got to handle around here, guys.

2549
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:50,080
Yeah.

2550
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:50,500
Yeah.

2551
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:50,940
Yeah.

2552
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:52,680
Get up.

2553
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:53,740
Oh my god.

2554
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:54,420
He's free.

2555
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,360
Yeah.

2556
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,240
There's stuff everywhere.

2557
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:02,780
So we're going to have to really walk around and explore.

2558
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:02,940
Oh.

2559
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,460
We're going to have to explore everything.

2560
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:13,500
So if I miss something, feel free to yell at me, but give me a chance to look around and get it all first for myself.

2561
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:13,900
Okay?

2562
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:16,820
No!

2563
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,540
That's not which way I wanted to go.

2564
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:19,000
Oh well.

2565
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:26,300
Let's just go over here too since we need to.

2566
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:29,420
Yeah.

2567
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:29,960
Huh.

2568
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:30,320
Huh.

2569
01:59:35,090 --> 01:59:35,530
Why?

2570
01:59:37,590 --> 01:59:37,730
Okay.

2571
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:38,850
You have both arms now.

2572
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:39,410
Just lift.

2573
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,590
You are humongous.

2574
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:41,770
You're huge.

2575
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:46,570
You're huge.

2576
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:48,090
Just lift.

2577
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:51,590
All righty.

2578
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:54,690
What's this one?

2579
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:01,230
He's like, no, not yet.

2580
02:00:01,610 --> 02:00:02,770
I can't do it.

2581
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:05,010
I can't do it.

2582
02:00:05,150 --> 02:00:05,610
Okay.

2583
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:06,650
No puzzle pieces.

2584
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:07,370
Oh my god.

2585
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:08,610
There's a little swimming guy.

2586
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:09,130
So cute.

2587
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:10,430
Oh my god.

2588
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:10,490
Oh my god.

2589
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:10,510
Oh my god.

2590
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:12,070
This is a good vantage point.

2591
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:15,430
He's eepy.

2592
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:18,070
Aw, eepy big bro.

2593
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:21,250
Onii-chan, okite.

2594
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:23,450
Okite, onii-chan.

2595
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:26,590
Okite, okite, okite, okite, okite.

2596
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:31,990
Let's go back to the bird.

2597
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:34,830
Oh wait.

2598
02:00:35,570 --> 02:00:36,590
Mada nemoi.

2599
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:44,330
Not this way.

2600
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:45,330
Over.

2601
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:46,830
Over.

2602
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:48,870
Over there.

2603
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:49,710
Oh.

2604
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:50,250
Oh.

2605
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:51,390
Oh my gosh.

2606
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:55,090
We're gaming, guys.

2607
02:00:57,410 --> 02:00:59,030
What the hell are those?

2608
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:03,870
What are you...

2609
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,260
I've never experienced those guys.

2610
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,640
Oh no.

2611
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:11,940
Wait.

2612
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:13,740
How much progress did I lose?

2613
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:17,060
Oh no.

2614
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:18,220
Oh no.

2615
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,020
Oh no.

2616
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,120
Oh no.

2617
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:20,580
I made it.

2618
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:20,620
Well...

2619
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:24,900
Aww, man.

2620
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,020
I have to do these guys again.

2621
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,870
Huh.

2622
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:38,950
They don't make this easy.

2623
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:39,290
Ay.

2624
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:41,890
Do I bait him?

2625
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:45,630
Oh, then I pull him!

2626
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:49,330
Ah-ha-ha, I see.

2627
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:49,510
I see.

2628
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:51,810
Then I pull him.

2629
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:53,210
Yeah!

2630
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:54,490
There we go!

2631
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:56,410
Got him.

2632
02:01:56,410 --> 02:01:57,350
Got him, got him, got him.

2633
02:01:58,670 --> 02:01:59,390
You're welcome!

2634
02:01:59,710 --> 02:02:00,790
Oh, Beast Tamer!

2635
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:02,030
I didn't even realize this was a guy.

2636
02:02:02,530 --> 02:02:04,810
Will grow up to have an incredible story to tell.

2637
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:05,470
Who is this?

2638
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:07,290
Last Guardian?

2639
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:13,690
She's like, you got rejected by your crush today?

2640
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:15,930
Sorry, I'm not laughing.

2641
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:17,450
Okay.

2642
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,710
I'm not laughing.

2643
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:22,250
That's so sad, I'm sorry.

2644
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,990
Why are you...

2645
02:02:25,570 --> 02:02:27,830
I'm just laughing because you said it in my chat.

2646
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:29,590
Sorry.

2647
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:32,530
No, I'm just laughing because you said it here.

2648
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:35,370
It's just kind of random, you know?

2649
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:35,710
That's all.

2650
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:38,190
It's not funny.

2651
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:39,410
It's just kind of random, that's all.

2652
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:45,140
That's all.

2653
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:46,260
It's not funny.

2654
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,000
I promise.

2655
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:50,680
It's just random.

2656
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:51,200
That's all.

2657
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,040
I'm trying to see if there's anything else that I should fly over to.

2658
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:10,680
Oh, interesting.

2659
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,840
There is...

2660
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,720
A jumping platform down there.

2661
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,360
So we shall check out...

2662
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,080
Why?

2663
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:17,700
Later.

2664
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,680
After we beat this up.

2665
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:26,160
We freed him!

2666
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,120
Brother.

2667
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:30,540
We freed him!

2668
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,700
Big brother.

2669
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,240
Oh my god, and it's sunny now!

2670
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:37,320
Happy day!

2671
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,000
Happy day!

2672
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:42,680
Oh.

2673
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:45,580
I guess it's just if you fall off.

2674
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,340
Okay, never mind.

2675
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:48,460
What's that?

2676
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:51,240
Okay, maybe that's where a portal is?

2677
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:52,900
Happy day!

2678
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:53,820
Happy day!

2679
02:03:55,180 --> 02:03:55,980
Big coin.

2680
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:58,500
I know, but there's still more to explore.

2681
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:59,240
Just a little bit.

2682
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:02,280
Because...

2683
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:07,300
Look how much we're missing!

2684
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:11,380
There's another... See that... that sparkly area up there?

2685
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:12,140
We gotta get to there.

2686
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:13,920
We gotta get to there.

2687
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:20,380
And...

2688
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:21,160
Oh,

2689
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:25,950
and in here.

2690
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:28,550
Okay, hold on.

2691
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:32,250
Do you think...

2692
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:34,410
Let's... let's drop down first.

2693
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:36,490
It's okay!

2694
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:40,830
You got this!

2695
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,390
Oh!

2696
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:43,670
Oh!

2697
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:43,910
Nice!

2698
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:45,470
You're getting slide, Cooper.

2699
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:46,770
You're getting slide, Cooper.

2700
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:47,390
Remind me.

2701
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:50,770
If you ever open a safe... a safe away...

2702
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,510
Wait.

2703
02:04:51,590 --> 02:04:53,370
If you ever open a safe away.

2704
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:54,610
To send your stuff.

2705
02:04:54,710 --> 02:04:55,010
Safe?

2706
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:55,670
Safe?

2707
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:56,030
Oh.

2708
02:04:56,150 --> 02:04:56,630
Oh.

2709
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,490
I have slide games on the PS2.

2710
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:00,230
I would let you borrow them for stream.

2711
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:01,410
Safe?

2712
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:06,140
Oh!

2713
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:06,680
A P.O.

2714
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:06,880
bar!

2715
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,480
I was like, huh?

2716
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:16,920
Thank you!

2717
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:19,680
Sorry.

2718
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:21,580
I'm... I'm... I'm... Sorry.

2719
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,260
I'm a little dumb.

2720
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,440
I was like, safe away.

2721
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,420
Safe... away.

2722
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:32,720
I was like, I thought you meant... like if I ever opened a safe...

2723
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,800
Like I was... like a spy.

2724
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:35,720
You know?

2725
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:41,580
If you ever... like if you ever found... a way to open a safe...

2726
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,780
How do I get up there?

2727
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:50,780
I thought maybe jumping... climbing up and then falling down might be our best way.

2728
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:52,400
Do I actually have to parkour here?

2729
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:54,980
Oh, dang it.

2730
02:05:58,220 --> 02:05:58,780
Oopsie.

2731
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,020
Break more of the platform?

2732
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:17,910
I see!

2733
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,270
Thank you guys.

2734
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:20,850
Oh.

2735
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:25,510
Secret.

2736
02:06:28,370 --> 02:06:28,850
Secret.

2737
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:33,390
Secret.

2738
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:35,770
Oh, I see.

2739
02:06:48,130 --> 02:06:48,610
Secret.

2740
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:51,650
Wait.

2741
02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:52,670
Slumbering girl.

2742
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:54,870
It takes a whole lot of effort to wake her up.

2743
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,030
Nice.

2744
02:06:58,290 --> 02:06:58,890
Okay, good.

2745
02:06:58,950 --> 02:06:59,890
We haven't missed one yet.

2746
02:07:01,510 --> 02:07:01,990
What's this?

2747
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:03,610
A bird.

2748
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:04,270
Oh.

2749
02:07:04,490 --> 02:07:04,850
Okay.

2750
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:07,210
Oh.

2751
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:07,510
Oh.

2752
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:09,270
No, no, no.

2753
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,410
There has to be more in there.

2754
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:11,430
There has to be more secret.

2755
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:14,810
There has to be more.

2756
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:18,090
But we can't fall.

2757
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:23,960
There has to be other platform.

2758
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,080
Right?

2759
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,640
Or maybe not.

2760
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:29,260
Wait.

2761
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:31,640
I don't see anything.

2762
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:32,160
Wait.

2763
02:07:41,370 --> 02:07:43,090
You guys are saying no?

2764
02:07:47,150 --> 02:07:47,990
Watch this.

2765
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:49,890
Goal!

2766
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:54,290
Okay.

2767
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:55,350
I believe you guys.

2768
02:07:57,550 --> 02:07:58,930
I believe you.

2769
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:02,550
Cool.

2770
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:04,710
But we're still...

2771
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:05,630
Oh, I see another...

2772
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:06,610
I see the other puzzle piece.

2773
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:10,150
I see the other puzzle piece.

2774
02:08:10,770 --> 02:08:15,870
But we are still missing a warp and four guys.

2775
02:08:17,790 --> 02:08:18,310
Uh...

2776
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:22,790
A warp and four guys.

2777
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:29,470
Okay.

2778
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:30,630
We got all the puzzle pieces though.

2779
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:31,910
Okay.

2780
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:31,910
We got all the puzzle pieces though.

2781
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:33,410
The level's not over.

2782
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:35,170
Yeah, that's true.

2783
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:36,970
That's very true.

2784
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:41,030
Oh, there is this area.

2785
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:41,790
Right here.

2786
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:43,730
I was like, maybe this is the warp.

2787
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:49,750
Oh!

2788
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:50,750
We got a guy?

2789
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:52,910
We got a guy?

2790
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:53,990
Very good!

2791
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:00,050
Never mind, that's not our warp though.

2792
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:07,170
Okay, let's... I guess... do here?

2793
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:12,050
And see if this is...

2794
02:09:14,690 --> 02:09:16,030
If it continues.

2795
02:09:16,530 --> 02:09:17,070
Oh!

2796
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:24,650
Oh my god, big brother!

2797
02:09:24,950 --> 02:09:25,790
Big brother!

2798
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:26,630
Big brother!

2799
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:33,180
Brother, use your hand!

2800
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:34,280
Lift me out of the water!

2801
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,040
Your hand!

2802
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,320
Your fingers are really big!

2803
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:37,080
Okay.

2804
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,400
Always wind it up, brother.

2805
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,020
Oh my brother!

2806
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:46,780
You have little parasites on you.

2807
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:47,220
Oh!

2808
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:50,000
Who's this?

2809
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:55,520
Wandering trespasser.

2810
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:57,340
Has a colossal task ahead of him.

2811
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:58,420
Nice.

2812
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,320
Main character of Shadow of the Colossus.

2813
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:01,960
Oh my goodness!

2814
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:02,480
Oh my goodness!

2815
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,840
I've never played Shadow of the Colossus.

2816
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:07,980
Oh, brother.

2817
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:11,080
Oh brother, you're kind of scaring me.

2818
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:15,620
What big eyes you have!

2819
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:21,660
Why is there still... wait, why is there a checkpoint?

2820
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,420
Brother, how much more of this level do we have, brother?

2821
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:27,520
Oh brother, there's a lot going on down there.

2822
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,100
Brother!

2823
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:30,740
Brother, if I drop, will you catch me?

2824
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,040
Brother.

2825
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,340
Brother, catch me!

2826
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:38,440
Okay, brother.

2827
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,440
Not cool, brother.

2828
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:42,020
Not cool.

2829
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,100
Not cool, brother.

2830
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:52,110
He's taking me up.

2831
02:10:52,650 --> 02:10:53,130
Oh!

2832
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:57,470
The bird is more helpful than you, brother!

2833
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:01,730
The bird is more helpful than you!

2834
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:04,690
What is this?

2835
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:09,470
This thing

2836
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:15,880
that we're climbing, anyway.

2837
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,520
I don't really understand it.

2838
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:25,150
I hear someone.

2839
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:25,770
I hear someone.

2840
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:26,570
I hear you!

2841
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:32,860
Okay, just one guy left.

2842
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:35,580
Sally's Seashows.

2843
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:40,900
And we are indeed by the seashore.

2844
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,560
What are you doing, brother?

2845
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:43,740
Oh.

2846
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:45,720
I hear something?

2847
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:49,140
I hear a guy.

2848
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,220
He's like in my left ear.

2849
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:55,580
Where are you?

2850
02:11:57,180 --> 02:11:58,060
Do you guys see him?

2851
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:01,040
Am I crazy?

2852
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:02,320
Okay, hold on.

2853
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:03,260
Let's get on it, brother.

2854
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:07,400
Brother, that can't be the end of the episode, please.

2855
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,920
We have more...

2856
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:11,820
Okay, you can lend more than a finger.

2857
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:12,560
Come on.

2858
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,560
Brother, don't be like that!

2859
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:16,160
Brother, you're being stingy!

2860
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,680
Brother, what if I fall?

2861
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:18,280
I will die!

2862
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:19,620
Brother!

2863
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:26,150
Oh, there he is!

2864
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:33,300
We still... didn't get the warp.

2865
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,420
We're still missing the warp.

2866
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:40,900
Oh my god!

2867
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:42,120
It's Venus!

2868
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:49,080
The warp is back below?

2869
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:49,680
Okay.

2870
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:57,100
Before I take that...

2871
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:58,280
We're back below?

2872
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:59,420
How below are we talking?

2873
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:03,120
How below are we talking?

2874
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:14,620
Brother...

2875
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:17,320
Bestow your wisdom upon me.

2876
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,280
All the way below?

2877
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:24,520
Back in the main area.

2878
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:25,500
Shoot!

2879
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,400
Okay, bye brother!

2880
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:30,920
Oh my god, that actually made my tummy drop.

2881
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:37,750
But if I... get the warp...

2882
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:41,330
The thing about warps that's so annoying is you have to redo the level, you know?

2883
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:45,510
But since I'm here, might as well do it.

2884
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:48,570
Alright, warp, warp, warp, warp.

2885
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:50,850
Warp, warp, warp, warp.

2886
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:52,190
If I were a warp...

2887
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,030
Where would I be?

2888
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:55,850
In the shell?

2889
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:56,210
No.

2890
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:59,370
If I were a warp, I would be up here.

2891
02:14:04,090 --> 02:14:04,490
No.

2892
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:07,470
If I were a warp, I...

2893
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:22,060
If I were a warp...

2894
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:32,520
Hold on, I'm looking around.

2895
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:33,340
I'm looking around.

2896
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:38,490
It's not over there.

2897
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:39,330
I noticed it earlier.

2898
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:43,050
I go check it out.

2899
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,000
Oh no!

2900
02:14:59,540 --> 02:15:00,020
Oh...

2901
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:02,620
Okay, let's go beat the level.

2902
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:08,520
Okay, but to be fair...

2903
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,140
What's wrong, brother?

2904
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:14,060
He's like, I lost my... I lost my brother!

2905
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:15,440
Brother, I'm here!

2906
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,600
Brother, I'm not dead!

2907
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:18,960
I'm not lost in the ocean!

2908
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:21,520
Brother, lend me your hand!

2909
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:25,000
Brother...

2910
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:26,820
Okay, nevermind.

2911
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:29,100
Oh, he respawns?

2912
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:29,840
Oh, okay.

2913
02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:35,770
I can't decide what I want to do.

2914
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:37,570
Beat the level or do the warp.

2915
02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:39,110
Oh, there he is.

2916
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:39,510
Okay.

2917
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:44,950
So he...

2918
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:51,430
Electrocute this area!

2919
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:54,850
Electrocute this area!

2920
02:16:01,190 --> 02:16:02,590
I found it!

2921
02:16:02,590 --> 02:16:03,770
I

2922
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:21,920
found it!

2923
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:23,220
Thanks guys for your help.

2924
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:31,390
What do we have here?

2925
02:16:32,670 --> 02:16:35,010
Another Spook... Ghouls and Birds!

2926
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:38,750
You guys, I'm getting all the best levels today!

2927
02:16:40,530 --> 02:16:41,250
Secret...

2928
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:43,250
How many Metal Gear characters?

2929
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:44,110
Just...

2930
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:49,110
Just a Metal Gear Solid one.

2931
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:53,730
I know there's more.

2932
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:54,530
I know there's more.

2933
02:16:54,690 --> 02:16:55,450
Don't tell me who.

2934
02:16:56,530 --> 02:16:57,530
I just know there's more.

2935
02:16:57,550 --> 02:16:58,230
And don't tell me where.

2936
02:16:59,290 --> 02:16:59,650
Ew!

2937
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:04,650
Oh my god, they're little zombies.

2938
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:05,570
They're little mummies!

2939
02:17:05,710 --> 02:17:06,070
So cute!

2940
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:08,590
Oh!

2941
02:17:10,210 --> 02:17:11,290
He's looking at me like...

2942
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:11,490
Oh!

2943
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:14,750
Kuro-kuro-kuro-kuro!

2944
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:17,270
Oh, I got you!

2945
02:17:21,330 --> 02:17:22,610
John Metal Gear.

2946
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:27,160
Nasty!

2947
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:31,340
Oh my gosh, it's so spooky!

2948
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:36,900
Oh gosh, you guys, I love horror.

2949
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:45,620
I love horror.

2950
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:47,780
Oh my goodness.

2951
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,060
Nice.

2952
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:01,780
Oh, it's this thing again.

2953
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:02,060
Oh!

2954
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:07,900
He's like...

2955
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,780
Calculus 2 has been kicking my butt ever now!

2956
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:12,800
Any words of encouragement from Kamiyoshi?

2957
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:12,920
Oh, I see.

2958
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:19,730
Numbers?

2959
02:18:21,870 --> 02:18:24,290
Numbers are not even real.

2960
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:30,850
Numbers...

2961
02:18:30,850 --> 02:18:33,790
were created by humanity.

2962
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:38,070
You can forget about them.

2963
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:43,590
You got this.

2964
02:18:46,490 --> 02:18:47,010
Freak.

2965
02:18:47,010 --> 02:18:47,930
Go list the bots.

2966
02:18:48,110 --> 02:18:48,470
Yes.

2967
02:18:49,590 --> 02:18:50,810
I am numbers.

2968
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:52,130
Created by humans.

2969
02:18:54,510 --> 02:18:56,330
Who wish to pay me a tribute.

2970
02:18:57,350 --> 02:18:57,870
Oh!

2971
02:18:58,210 --> 02:18:58,730
Tribute?

2972
02:18:59,490 --> 02:19:02,650
You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

2973
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:04,650
Uh-oh.

2974
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:07,170
Wait, you guys, if I...

2975
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:18,240
Guys, if I do this...

2976
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:20,480
How am I gonna get back?

2977
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:21,080
Oh!

2978
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:23,200
Guys, I think I made a grave mistake.

2979
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:25,340
Thank you!

2980
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:25,620
Thank you!

2981
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:26,300
Fragile knight.

2982
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:28,280
Relieved that they remembered to put on underwear.

2983
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:29,220
What does that mean?

2984
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:30,540
Oh!

2985
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:31,920
Never mind!

2986
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:32,920
The game loves us!

2987
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:35,620
The game is so kind!

2988
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:40,860
The game is kind.

2989
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:45,530
Loves us!

2990
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:47,810
I don't know how much I super chatted you.

2991
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:48,130
I forgot.

2992
02:19:49,710 --> 02:19:50,550
That is...

2993
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:51,250
Okay, wait.

2994
02:19:51,310 --> 02:19:52,450
That might be an important...

2995
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:52,750
Oh!

2996
02:19:52,770 --> 02:19:52,810
I forgot.

2997
02:19:52,810 --> 02:19:52,930
Oh!

2998
02:19:56,210 --> 02:19:56,730
Bye-bye!

2999
02:19:56,730 --> 02:19:58,590
You bastard ghost, you!

3000
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:05,630
Bastard ghost, bastard ghost!

3001
02:20:06,370 --> 02:20:08,130
Screw you, screw you ghost!

3002
02:20:09,610 --> 02:20:10,990
Wait, there's something down there.

3003
02:20:11,050 --> 02:20:12,930
Wait, so I can fall into the toxic waste?

3004
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,710
Or...

3005
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:19,360
So it's fine to...

3006
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:23,340
Okay, hurry, hurry, come on!

3007
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:24,160
Come on!

3008
02:20:31,210 --> 02:20:32,110
Oh my god, please.

3009
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:38,400
Triumph checkpoint.

3010
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:39,320
I guess that's true.

3011
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:42,340
Because otherwise...

3012
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:45,140
Like, why does it have the thing down there?

3013
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:51,480
But at the same time, I don't want to do that fight again.

3014
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,500
Oh, it's an invisible platform, I think.

3015
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:00,480
Why is the food so huge?

3016
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:02,140
Yeah!

3017
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:06,740
Now

3018
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:11,070
I can actually go do it.

3019
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:11,570
Here, let's see.

3020
02:21:12,890 --> 02:21:14,010
Let's see what happens if we fall.

3021
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:15,770
Oh my god, I need this carpet!

3022
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:17,990
This rug is so cute!

3023
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:21,610
I think I need it.

3024
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:29,520
Oh, that's fun.

3025
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:32,900
Where does that come from?

3026
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:34,560
Wait a second!

3027
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:41,080
Wait a second, how do I get that?

3028
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:41,280
Wait.

3029
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:43,420
Is this his room or something?

3030
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:45,000
Wait a second.

3031
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:49,040
That was Sir Arthur from Ghosts and Goblins.

3032
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:53,160
When he gets hit, he loses his armor and runs around in his underwear.

3033
02:22:08,810 --> 02:22:10,530
Why is his hand like that?

3034
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:19,740
Oh my gosh.

3035
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:21,440
I'm living on the edge, for real.

3036
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:27,960
Stop spying.

3037
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,180
Oh, maybe he needs... he wants me to spy.

3038
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:32,600
Have you seen the door in that thing?

3039
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:36,900
Oh, I just completely wasted it, but that's okay.

3040
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:49,360
Oh, there's creepy crawlies in the window.

3041
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:51,420
Oh, there's a hand!

3042
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:58,960
Wait, I think we need a running start.

3043
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,460
Please, grab it!

3044
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:15,180
Oh, no!

3045
02:23:18,380 --> 02:23:19,460
Please, grab it!

3046
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:20,580
My depth perception!

3047
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:24,040
No!

3048
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:25,040
No!

3049
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,100
Oh, I got it, finally!

3050
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:29,900
Oh my goodness.

3051
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:33,760
There's a puzzle piece there.

3052
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:41,710
Cute!

3053
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,250
Baby Cortex and the Gifted!

3054
02:23:43,910 --> 02:23:45,650
Depth perception, you guys!

3055
02:23:45,790 --> 02:23:46,510
Depth perception!

3056
02:23:53,210 --> 02:23:54,190
He's like, hey!

3057
02:23:54,350 --> 02:23:55,670
Hey, can I have my head back?

3058
02:23:57,950 --> 02:24:00,570
Spooky, scary skeletons and shivers.

3059
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:02,010
Even the bird.

3060
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:07,170
Shivers up your spine.

3061
02:24:11,830 --> 02:24:12,950
Make it sure I...

3062
02:24:16,890 --> 02:24:17,890
Let's grab Vanilla.

3063
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:19,890
This game is so adorable.

3064
02:24:20,210 --> 02:24:20,770
Isn't it alright?

3065
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:23,350
Oh gosh, leap of faith.

3066
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:36,560
Please!

3067
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:40,620
I got it!

3068
02:24:48,750 --> 02:24:49,790
Depth perception.

3069
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:52,590
Oh, depth perception.

3070
02:24:57,570 --> 02:24:58,210
Okay.

3071
02:24:59,090 --> 02:24:59,730
Alright.

3072
02:25:00,650 --> 02:25:02,110
Okay, leap of faith!

3073
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,750
Ah,

3074
02:25:07,810 --> 02:25:08,470
there we go.

3075
02:25:08,570 --> 02:25:08,790
Okay.

3076
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:12,590
We got...

3077
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:16,290
Eternal Knight?

3078
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:18,050
Make no bones about it, there...

3079
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:18,770
Is this medieval?

3080
02:25:19,090 --> 02:25:19,330
Ah!

3081
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:22,170
Ah!

3082
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:28,170
Open up!

3083
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:36,090
Sir Darn!

3084
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:38,490
I remember him!

3085
02:25:46,950 --> 02:25:48,410
Another sleepy guy.

3086
02:25:55,610 --> 02:26:00,780
I must get puzzle piece.

3087
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:03,560
Puzzle piece is so important.

3088
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:07,560
Okay.

3089
02:26:11,480 --> 02:26:12,300
Oh gosh.

3090
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:13,180
Oh, I'm scared.

3091
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:16,020
Okay.

3092
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:32,660
Get out of my... Oh, that's a mimic.

3093
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:35,880
And I am free run.

3094
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,780
I think we have to blow it, you guys.

3095
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,440
Any puzzle pieces down here?

3096
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:03,020
Secret people?

3097
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:07,120
Chill,

3098
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:17,260
chill, chill, chill.

3099
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:18,060
Stop it!

3100
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:18,900
Stop it!

3101
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:19,360
Stop!

3102
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:23,960
Stop!

3103
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:29,020
Can I just kill you?

3104
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:29,280
No?

3105
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:29,660
Oh,

3106
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:33,440
I got it.

3107
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:35,240
I don't know how I got it, but I got it somehow.

3108
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:43,220
We're still missing a puzzle piece and a person.

3109
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:46,380
The game is bullying me for my size.

3110
02:27:47,540 --> 02:27:48,720
It's not very kind.

3111
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:52,480
See, that looks like an area.

3112
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:53,160
Oh, maybe not.

3113
02:27:54,860 --> 02:27:56,540
Okay, let's just continue onward for now.

3114
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:58,040
See what else there is.

3115
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:02,600
Oh!

3116
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,140
Ecto gang!

3117
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:07,280
What the heck?

3118
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:08,100
What the hell is this Luigi?

3119
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:10,560
Luigi's Mansion.

3120
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:12,020
What do I do?

3121
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:12,580
Oh, R2.

3122
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:12,960
Okay.

3123
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:18,080
Got him.

3124
02:28:21,620 --> 02:28:23,080
Oh, I got juked.

3125
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,740
Oh my gosh, it's just like a... Oh no.

3126
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:31,980
It's just like a whack-a-mole.

3127
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:37,200
Oh my god.

3128
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:38,820
I got him.

3129
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:42,580
Oh my god.

3130
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,420
Whack-a-mole.

3131
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:44,240
Whack-a-mole real.

3132
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:46,960
Uh-oh.

3133
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:47,960
I'm missing people though.

3134
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,040
Shut up!

3135
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:53,180
I

3136
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:00,060
got it!

3137
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:04,200
Impractical butcher heavies the head that wears the pyramid.

3138
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:10,220
I don't know yet if I'm going to play the new Silent Hill.

3139
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,380
Okay, that looks like we're a puzzle piece.

3140
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:13,880
Wait.

3141
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:14,980
So does that.

3142
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:16,920
I think I can get down there.

3143
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:21,540
I think I can go in there.

3144
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:25,920
There's no warp.

3145
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:27,140
Oh, we're in the warp area.

3146
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:31,180
No, it's not down there.

3147
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,520
It was by the rope.

3148
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:34,540
Which rope?

3149
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:40,000
I missed it.

3150
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:40,520
Shoot.

3151
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:42,420
Goodnight.

3152
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,840
Can I go back?

3153
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:45,640
Ow!

3154
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:00,750
Try dying?

3155
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:03,690
Yeah, let's try.

3156
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:12,170
Nah, the game said, you beat the level.

3157
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:13,570
The pain.

3158
02:30:14,370 --> 02:30:15,490
That's so rude.

3159
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:17,750
That's so rude.

3160
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:20,970
There's no way I can go back at all.

3161
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:24,110
Doesn't look like it.

3162
02:30:25,210 --> 02:30:26,090
Oh man.

3163
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:35,740
Yeah, at least I know where it is.

3164
02:30:35,740 --> 02:30:36,060
So true.

3165
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,740
Oh my god, look at those spinny ghosts.

3166
02:30:37,800 --> 02:30:38,260
They're so cute.

3167
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:40,340
Oh, Pyramid Head.

3168
02:30:50,970 --> 02:30:51,690
Dang it.

3169
02:30:52,350 --> 02:30:52,930
Dang it.

3170
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:54,550
I'm not going to go back right now though to get it.

3171
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:57,210
I will go back another time.

3172
02:30:57,330 --> 02:30:58,230
I will go back another time.

3173
02:30:59,930 --> 02:31:02,310
Yeah, I'm not sure yet if I'm going to play the new...

3174
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:06,430
I've heard though that it's getting good reviews.

3175
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:11,470
So I would like to be optimistic.

3176
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:14,730
I don't know though.

3177
02:31:16,350 --> 02:31:17,910
They say it's good.

3178
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:24,940
Wow!

3179
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:26,540
Look how many we got!

3180
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:29,320
We have so many bombs!

3181
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:33,020
And we unlocked a new thing!

3182
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,160
Time for a change!

3183
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:40,520
The changing room is open!

3184
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:43,060
The only thing left is to find the perfect outfit.

3185
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:47,920
What is this?

3186
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:53,000
It's gonna be that place right there, right?

3187
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:53,640
Hey, hey, hey!

3188
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:54,240
What are you doing?

3189
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:56,140
We gotta do gacha.

3190
02:31:59,360 --> 02:32:00,460
Time for gacha.

3191
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:02,220
Gimme!

3192
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:04,780
Calling card!

3193
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:06,520
We got the joker's calling card!

3194
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,340
Cute!

3195
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:13,260
We have...

3196
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:15,540
We got sla... oh there's the safe!

3197
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:18,020
No safe is safe!

3198
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:22,360
Let's go!

3199
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:24,080
This one's heavy.

3200
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:27,860
Gravity shifter outfit!

3201
02:32:28,820 --> 02:32:30,380
Fall with style.

3202
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:31,940
Wait, this looks so familiar.

3203
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:32,600
What is this from?

3204
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:42,000
Cobalt Dusk Deep Blue Sea?

3205
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:44,440
Gravity Rush!

3206
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,900
Treasured Memento.

3207
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:49,320
Aww...

3208
02:32:49,580 --> 02:32:51,580
Souvenir from an unforgettable friend.

3209
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:55,080
What's this one?

3210
02:32:57,520 --> 02:32:59,300
Acer Cleaver.

3211
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:01,140
Asgard as it gets!

3212
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:03,400
Gimme more outfits!

3213
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:07,420
Oh my god, I thought that was the Buster Sword for a second.

3214
02:33:08,860 --> 02:33:10,420
Doesn't even look like it, but...

3215
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:13,280
More outfits!

3216
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:16,340
Oh, I kinda like the pink one though.

3217
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:19,340
More outfits!

3218
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:22,680
Oh, we got Kratos' campfire.

3219
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:28,720
Magical smithing!

3220
02:33:30,400 --> 02:33:31,640
Come on, more outfits!

3221
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:34,760
Anti-demon set!

3222
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:38,100
Oh gosh, I need to play Devil May Cry soon.

3223
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:41,740
I'll get around to it.

3224
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:44,060
Sooner rather than later.

3225
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:44,820
Don't worry.

3226
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:47,060
Thirsty Cutlass.

3227
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:52,520
Friendly drone!

3228
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:53,580
Oh, cute!

3229
02:33:53,820 --> 02:33:54,480
It's for strife!

3230
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:58,780
And last one...

3231
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:00,740
Legendary Hammer.

3232
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:03,060
So much god of...

3233
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:05,020
Oh, there's all the outfits now!

3234
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:05,800
Meow!

3235
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:06,280
Meow...

3236
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:10,560
Meow!

3237
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:11,480
Meow...

3238
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:11,740
Meow...

3239
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:11,960
Meow...

3240
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:13,340
Meow...

3241
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:13,660
Oh my gosh.

3242
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:14,660
They have their own little area.

3243
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:23,140
So lonely!

3244
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:27,700
Let's go in here.

3245
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,120
We did get an outfit.

3246
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:30,440
It's kind of exciting.

3247
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:34,280
Oh, I have two outfits, apparently.

3248
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:35,180
I have two outfits, apparently.

3249
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:36,000
I have two outfits, apparently.

3250
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:37,620
Oh...

3251
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:41,570
I have two outfits, apparently.

3252
02:34:41,570 --> 02:34:42,950
So cute!

3253
02:34:43,230 --> 02:34:45,390
Wait, but this one is so cute.

3254
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:48,450
Happy Myoshi is streaming my favorite game from this year on my birthday.

3255
02:34:48,630 --> 02:34:49,390
Nora!

3256
02:34:49,770 --> 02:34:50,930
Happy birthday!

3257
02:34:53,090 --> 02:34:55,970
Happy birthday to you.

3258
02:34:56,310 --> 02:34:59,230
Happy birthday to you.

3259
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:02,390
Happy birthday dear Nora.

3260
02:35:03,710 --> 02:35:07,070
Happy birthday to you.

3261
02:35:08,450 --> 02:35:09,950
Happy birthday!

3262
02:35:09,950 --> 02:35:10,210
Happy birthday!

3263
02:35:11,810 --> 02:35:12,830
We'll stick with this one.

3264
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:16,710
Oh my gosh, I'm so cute!

3265
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:19,670
Wait, are there any Alphas from Metal Gear?

3266
02:35:19,730 --> 02:35:20,210
Don't tell me.

3267
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:23,210
Don't tell me if there are.

3268
02:35:25,110 --> 02:35:26,310
Don't tell me if there are.

3269
02:35:26,490 --> 02:35:28,590
And if there's not, I'll just be really sad and cry.

3270
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,540
I want the pink one.

3271
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:51,020
Everybody, look at all of them.

3272
02:35:57,500 --> 02:35:58,360
So cute.

3273
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,120
Come back!

3274
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,680
Everybody, all these little robots are so moe.

3275
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:07,620
They're so stupid.

3276
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:08,320
I love it.

3277
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:11,320
They're all so moe and dumb.

3278
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:13,680
Stupid.

3279
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,860
One more try, please.

3280
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:19,220
There we go.

3281
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:24,260
Wait, where's my money?

3282
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:26,400
Where's my money?

3283
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:28,700
What's this?

3284
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:32,600
Wait, what the heck is this?

3285
02:36:37,380 --> 02:36:39,540
Why is this so cute?

3286
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:41,460
Happy to see you stream on my birthday.

3287
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,460
Oh my gosh, my fiancé.

3288
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:46,500
I've been playing MGS because of you and we just got a kitten named Ryden.

3289
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:48,900
Strawberry, happy birthday!

3290
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:52,300
Happy birthday to you.

3291
02:36:53,380 --> 02:36:55,280
Happy birthday to you.

3292
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:57,120
Happy birthday.

3293
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:58,780
Strawberry tarot.

3294
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:03,080
Happy birthday to you.

3295
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:09,140
It's so cute.

3296
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:13,960
I keep forgetting.

3297
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:18,420
Well, I don't forget that this is a game for their 30th.

3298
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:24,020
But I'm also just like, oh yeah, this is for PlayStation 30th.

3299
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:31,260
I could farm some coins a little bit, but I'd rather just go play some more levels.

3300
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:33,920
Let's go to some more worlds.

3301
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:35,500
I wonder if there are Metal Gear outfits.

3302
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:37,680
It's only Quiet's outfit!

3303
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:38,500
Yo!

3304
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:42,680
Toro's videos, welcome to membership.

3305
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:43,080
Thank you!

3306
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:46,240
The bathtub?

3307
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:47,520
What's the bathtub?

3308
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:53,380
Oh, no, no, no.

3309
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:53,800
It's a snake.

3310
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:57,800
And let's go.

3311
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:59,780
Nice, nice, nice!

3312
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:01,140
Let's go to monkey.

3313
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:04,840
Monkey town!

3314
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:13,280
Bathhouse battle?

3315
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:15,900
Okay.

3316
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:18,120
I played this yesterday.

3317
02:38:18,980 --> 02:38:19,440
Hey!

3318
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:21,600
Leave that little monkey alone!

3319
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,800
The monkey's in my bathhouse.

3320
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:27,980
Monkey's in my bathhouse.

3321
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:30,900
Is there something over here?

3322
02:38:31,140 --> 02:38:33,120
I hear something, like, moving, like...

3323
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:34,720
Oh, here.

3324
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:43,070
That is really pretty.

3325
02:38:43,570 --> 02:38:45,350
It sounds like something's taking pictures.

3326
02:38:46,230 --> 02:38:46,830
Oh, whatever.

3327
02:38:48,890 --> 02:38:50,610
Oh, I see, I see money up there.

3328
02:38:51,650 --> 02:38:53,290
Where there's money, I follow.

3329
02:38:57,770 --> 02:38:58,210
Yep!

3330
02:39:02,930 --> 02:39:03,870
I hear you!

3331
02:39:03,930 --> 02:39:04,370
Hold on!

3332
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:06,110
I must go to the money first!

3333
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:07,930
I'll get you after!

3334
02:39:08,050 --> 02:39:08,670
Be patient!

3335
02:39:09,010 --> 02:39:09,450
God.

3336
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:11,510
Be patient.

3337
02:39:12,890 --> 02:39:14,750
I must go where the money follows.

3338
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:20,900
There we go.

3339
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:22,640
Our first rescue.

3340
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:25,000
Rubber ducky.

3341
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:28,240
Hey, that's my rubber ducky.

3342
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:29,000
Can you throw it?

3343
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:30,020
Oh my god, there goes the monkey!

3344
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:36,440
Nice.

3345
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:37,900
Whoa.

3346
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:39,140
Oh.

3347
02:39:45,530 --> 02:39:47,110
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

3348
02:39:48,210 --> 02:39:49,210
Hands off!

3349
02:39:50,970 --> 02:39:52,330
Oh, there's a guy in here.

3350
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,740
What... are we?

3351
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:01,440
My favorite power-up.

3352
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:05,320
What?

3353
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:06,560
Oh!

3354
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:19,100
I'm a sponge!

3355
02:40:23,560 --> 02:40:24,680
Wait, am I...

3356
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:27,520
What am I doing?

3357
02:40:29,500 --> 02:40:31,380
I'm, like, watering it, I think.

3358
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:33,560
I'm making it all wet.

3359
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:36,400
I'm moistening the flowers.

3360
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:37,000
What?

3361
02:40:46,390 --> 02:40:46,750
Oh!

3362
02:40:46,750 --> 02:40:47,490
Oh my gosh!

3363
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,210
I got it!

3364
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:48,730
I got it!

3365
02:40:48,730 --> 02:40:49,210
I got it!

3366
02:40:49,210 --> 02:40:49,670
I got it!

3367
02:40:49,690 --> 02:40:50,170
I got it!

3368
02:40:50,510 --> 02:40:51,630
I understand now.

3369
02:40:58,740 --> 02:40:59,460
R2 to...

3370
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:01,200
Oh, so it sprays.

3371
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:04,020
Is it, like, an attack too, even?

3372
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:06,960
Oh, yeah.

3373
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:07,440
There we go.

3374
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:12,100
Oh, I thought it was just I run around and I...

3375
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:16,740
And I... help them out, but no.

3376
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:18,420
Oh my god!

3377
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:21,640
This is so cute!

3378
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:25,400
How does this game continue to, like, get me so much?

3379
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:26,840
I'm just like, what?

3380
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:29,460
Everything they do, I'm just like, oh my god!

3381
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:31,880
Every concept feels so...

3382
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:34,920
So good!

3383
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:41,580
These sponges are so stinking cute.

3384
02:41:41,860 --> 02:41:42,300
I know!

3385
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:44,120
They really ate with this game.

3386
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:44,820
Like, damn.

3387
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:47,180
Oh, I'm...

3388
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:49,240
Yeah!

3389
02:41:58,010 --> 02:42:00,330
I am sponge destroyer!

3390
02:42:03,530 --> 02:42:04,490
Oh, I got two.

3391
02:42:04,570 --> 02:42:05,190
Oh, I got him.

3392
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:08,490
Is there anything here?

3393
02:42:08,710 --> 02:42:11,190
I should be looking more off the side of the cliffs.

3394
02:42:11,650 --> 02:42:14,150
I feel like Godzilla is...

3395
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:15,610
Like, oh, it's crazy.

3396
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:20,960
Yeah!

3397
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:22,020
You can't hurt me!

3398
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:26,200
I'm crazy!

3399
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:27,060
I'm crazy!

3400
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:29,100
Oh, no.

3401
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:31,300
Not sludge.

3402
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:34,880
Not on my watch.

3403
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:35,980
Ew!

3404
02:42:36,220 --> 02:42:36,820
Oh my god.

3405
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:38,100
Oh my god!

3406
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:38,900
He was drowning!

3407
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:41,600
Hold on.

3408
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:42,180
I'll save you.

3409
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:44,460
She's freaky.

3410
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:47,100
Oh my god.

3411
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:47,800
This poor guy.

3412
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:48,860
Are you okay?

3413
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:58,360
This is the best bathhouse.

3414
02:42:58,560 --> 02:42:58,900
Oh, sorry.

3415
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:01,060
I can't control my size, everybody.

3416
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:03,100
I can't control my size.

3417
02:43:03,220 --> 02:43:04,080
I can't...

3418
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,480
I'm crazy.

3419
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:09,880
Looks like there'd be something over there, but I can't tell.

3420
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:17,060
Oh my god.

3421
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:17,340
Oh!

3422
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:17,720
Oops.

3423
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:18,780
I didn't even notice him.

3424
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:22,820
Not on my... watch?

3425
02:43:29,730 --> 02:43:30,290
Yeah!

3426
02:43:35,950 --> 02:43:36,510
Yeah!

3427
02:43:36,510 --> 02:43:37,070
Ducky!

3428
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,530
Ducky!

3429
02:43:38,030 --> 02:43:38,530
Yeah!

3430
02:43:39,570 --> 02:43:40,790
Destroy everything!

3431
02:43:42,510 --> 02:43:43,070
Destroy!

3432
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:44,590
Oh my god.

3433
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:44,850
Wait.

3434
02:43:45,530 --> 02:43:46,090
Actually...

3435
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:52,570
Wait.

3436
02:43:52,650 --> 02:43:52,930
Oh.

3437
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:54,250
Is this a secret?

3438
02:44:01,490 --> 02:44:02,570
Is this one?

3439
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:04,530
So let's try going this way.

3440
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:06,870
But this one has the...

3441
02:44:08,730 --> 02:44:09,170
Oh.

3442
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:09,610
No!

3443
02:44:11,910 --> 02:44:12,350
Yeah.

3444
02:44:12,530 --> 02:44:12,930
Death.

3445
02:44:13,170 --> 02:44:13,470
Death.

3446
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:13,890
Death.

3447
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:14,290
Death.

3448
02:44:14,310 --> 02:44:14,570
Death.

3449
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:21,400
Oh.

3450
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:22,160
I have to go small.

3451
02:44:22,280 --> 02:44:22,600
Just kidding.

3452
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:27,260
Is this the way I'm supposed to be at?

3453
02:44:35,210 --> 02:44:35,770
Yeah.

3454
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:36,270
Oh my god.

3455
02:44:36,270 --> 02:44:37,370
They're destroying everything!

3456
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:38,910
That's my job!

3457
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:50,500
Yeah.

3458
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:51,320
Try me.

3459
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:52,500
Try getting me.

3460
02:44:53,220 --> 02:44:54,500
Try getting me.

3461
02:44:56,860 --> 02:44:58,440
Checkpoints mean progress usually.

3462
02:44:58,680 --> 02:44:58,920
Yeah.

3463
02:44:59,020 --> 02:45:00,140
That's why I'm like...

3464
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:01,200
Oh my god.

3465
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:06,040
That's why I'm like... I think I want to go try the other way first.

3466
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:07,820
Before we continue any further.

3467
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:09,100
Over here.

3468
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:09,700
What are you...

3469
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:10,720
This is lazy.

3470
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:12,040
Lazy bones right here.

3471
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:17,200
The other path is a secret.

3472
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:17,640
Okay.

3473
02:45:17,740 --> 02:45:18,100
Oh.

3474
02:45:18,180 --> 02:45:18,760
I missed a guy.

3475
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,320
So he...

3476
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:20,840
There must be a guy in the secret area.

3477
02:45:25,950 --> 02:45:26,910
I'm looking around.

3478
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:28,930
I'm viewing everything.

3479
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:40,440
We're so small.

3480
02:45:48,530 --> 02:45:50,930
Maybe I put water in it.

3481
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:54,650
It's like a deer scare, right?

3482
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:10,820
Here.

3483
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:11,880
We'll do this one first then.

3484
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:16,640
You jerk.

3485
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:21,330
You jerk.

3486
02:46:21,570 --> 02:46:21,890
You.

3487
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:25,230
That's why I usually kill those guys with my laser.

3488
02:46:25,690 --> 02:46:26,470
With this.

3489
02:46:28,430 --> 02:46:29,970
Otherwise, I don't trust it.

3490
02:46:30,110 --> 02:46:30,390
You know?

3491
02:46:31,250 --> 02:46:31,770
You!

3492
02:46:36,320 --> 02:46:37,000
There we go.

3493
02:46:42,970 --> 02:46:44,210
I'm not going to kill you.

3494
02:46:44,230 --> 02:46:44,650
Don't worry.

3495
02:46:45,570 --> 02:46:46,670
Not yet anyway.

3496
02:46:51,410 --> 02:46:52,450
You monster.

3497
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:55,690
I am.

3498
02:46:56,290 --> 02:46:57,430
I'm the monster.

3499
02:46:58,090 --> 02:46:59,470
Oh my god.

3500
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:02,010
I can't control my strength you guys.

3501
02:47:02,010 --> 02:47:04,170
I can't control my power.

3502
02:47:06,810 --> 02:47:07,370
Oh.

3503
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:08,110
Everything's fine.

3504
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:10,250
We're all good.

3505
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:12,490
Let's wash this off.

3506
02:47:14,810 --> 02:47:15,750
Oh my god.

3507
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:17,370
I got a puzzle piece for being kind.

3508
02:47:21,630 --> 02:47:23,650
This is why you should be cleanly everybody.

3509
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:25,430
Good.

3510
02:47:45,950 --> 02:47:46,830
I lived.

3511
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:48,430
I lived.

3512
02:47:50,470 --> 02:47:52,070
But my gamers stink.

3513
02:47:52,510 --> 02:47:53,070
No.

3514
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:58,700
There's monkeys looking at me.

3515
02:48:00,660 --> 02:48:02,160
There's got to be something over there, right?

3516
02:48:02,260 --> 02:48:02,700
Nope.

3517
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,680
If I miss something, just holler.

3518
02:48:06,820 --> 02:48:07,940
Just go yodeling.

3519
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,930
I hear someone.

3520
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:16,470
I hear someone.

3521
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:43,320
The masks on them are awesome.

3522
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:43,840
I know, right?

3523
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:44,520
They're so cute.

3524
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,380
Jump to the temple thingy.

3525
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:48,760
But I don't know what that...

3526
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:49,560
That thing over there?

3527
02:48:55,370 --> 02:48:55,990
I'll try.

3528
02:48:57,230 --> 02:48:58,170
I was afraid.

3529
02:48:58,930 --> 02:49:00,030
I want to make it.

3530
02:49:00,110 --> 02:49:00,750
But let me try.

3531
02:49:00,850 --> 02:49:02,090
Maybe I can make it if I'm big.

3532
02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:13,360
I knew I looked suspicious.

3533
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:20,780
There we go.

3534
02:49:22,820 --> 02:49:24,080
What's around here anyway?

3535
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:29,400
Oh, sorry.

3536
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:31,560
Uh.

3537
02:49:40,210 --> 02:49:41,350
The chimney out.

3538
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:44,290
Is the chimney going?

3539
02:49:44,510 --> 02:49:44,810
Oh.

3540
02:49:44,810 --> 02:49:45,530
Oh, I see it.

3541
02:49:45,590 --> 02:49:46,250
Oh, I see it.

3542
02:49:46,250 --> 02:49:46,690
I see it.

3543
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:47,510
Uh.

3544
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:50,190
Ah, I see.

3545
02:49:50,270 --> 02:49:50,410
I see.

3546
02:49:50,470 --> 02:49:50,610
Okay.

3547
02:49:53,410 --> 02:49:53,970
Try again.

3548
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:05,130
How can I get up the tree?

3549
02:50:05,230 --> 02:50:05,510
Let's see.

3550
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:06,010
Oh, wait.

3551
02:50:06,990 --> 02:50:07,750
Ah, I see.

3552
02:50:07,810 --> 02:50:07,910
I see.

3553
02:50:08,910 --> 02:50:09,270
Okay.

3554
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:10,650
Excuse me.

3555
02:50:10,990 --> 02:50:11,570
Excuse me.

3556
02:50:17,330 --> 02:50:18,050
Oh, my God.

3557
02:50:19,630 --> 02:50:20,550
What the hell is that?

3558
02:50:21,870 --> 02:50:22,390
Oh, no.

3559
02:50:22,410 --> 02:50:23,370
This is the warp, though.

3560
02:50:23,430 --> 02:50:23,570
Oh, no.

3561
02:50:23,570 --> 02:50:24,710
I have to redo the level.

3562
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:26,330
Um.

3563
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:36,680
A puzzle piece.

3564
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:41,240
Hmm.

3565
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:44,560
Oh.

3566
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:46,600
Should I just grab it, though?

3567
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:55,300
Oh, well.

3568
02:50:55,420 --> 02:50:55,800
Um.

3569
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:59,420
I still have two guys and a puzzle piece.

3570
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:03,660
I can go back.

3571
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:04,060
Yeah.

3572
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:04,680
I think.

3573
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:11,700
I wish that's... that's the one thing about this game is they make you kind of go through it, you know.

3574
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:12,420
Oh, hello?

3575
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:22,660
Like when I go to the warp, I should be able to return to where I was, you know what I mean?

3576
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:28,280
So I don't lose progress.

3577
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:31,820
Oh my gosh.

3578
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:33,360
Leave me alone!

3579
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:43,120
That's right... oh, did I get you?

3580
02:51:43,420 --> 02:51:44,340
I missed a guy?

3581
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:45,020
I missed one.

3582
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:49,100
Dude, the far more coins... that's true, that's true, that's true.

3583
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:53,320
It's only... it's a tiny... it's not a big complaint.

3584
02:51:53,680 --> 02:51:56,620
It's barely... I say complaint, it's not even like a complaint.

3585
02:51:56,820 --> 02:52:00,300
It's just like a... oh, it's an inconvenience, right?

3586
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:10,020
But it's not like a... ugh, this is annoying.

3587
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:15,160
What is a ghost's favorite Mario brother?

3588
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,460
Oh, oh, this is timed!

3589
02:52:19,620 --> 02:52:21,240
Oh no, no, no, no!

3590
02:52:27,560 --> 02:52:28,620
Oh, there's a puzzle piece!

3591
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:30,220
Okay, we got the other puzzle piece too.

3592
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:42,720
Nice,

3593
02:52:46,180 --> 02:52:46,600
all right.

3594
02:52:48,460 --> 02:52:50,660
Okay, just because... okay, I said this before.

3595
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:52,200
Uh, I'll say it again.

3596
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:56,820
But uh, if I... please try not to backseat too much.

3597
02:52:57,380 --> 02:52:59,660
Because you know, just if I miss something...

3598
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:04,440
Let me at least like explore first everything, okay?

3599
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:07,080
So that I'm not just like...

3600
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:11,180
So it's not just like... immediately.

3601
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:13,040
Hey, you need to go do something.

3602
02:53:14,540 --> 02:53:14,980
Yeah.

3603
02:53:23,630 --> 02:53:25,270
Okay, there... oh, oh no wait!

3604
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:26,050
I do need this one!

3605
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:28,170
Because I need the... oh shoot.

3606
02:53:28,330 --> 02:53:29,050
I'm not gonna make it.

3607
02:53:29,670 --> 02:53:30,290
There we go.

3608
02:53:30,530 --> 02:53:31,230
Oh my gosh.

3609
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:32,750
Oh no, no, no!

3610
02:53:33,030 --> 02:53:33,470
No!

3611
02:53:34,930 --> 02:53:35,330
Timing.

3612
02:54:11,060 --> 02:54:12,200
Run, run, run, run, run.

3613
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:12,700
Run!

3614
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:33,900
Okay, I'll die.

3615
02:54:35,220 --> 02:54:36,120
I guess I'll die.

3616
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:38,460
Yeah, it's like a really small window, right?

3617
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:41,900
Oh no, I have to do this part again.

3618
02:54:50,430 --> 02:54:52,270
Okay, I got all three at least this time.

3619
02:54:55,110 --> 02:54:56,530
Is there anything down here?

3620
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:56,910
Let's check.

3621
02:54:57,770 --> 02:54:58,170
Oh!

3622
02:54:58,770 --> 02:54:59,170
Ah!

3623
02:54:59,850 --> 02:55:01,010
That's a good thing I checked!

3624
02:55:01,310 --> 02:55:02,450
Oh my gosh!

3625
02:55:03,630 --> 02:55:04,350
Creepy Sightjacker!

3626
02:55:05,050 --> 02:55:07,050
Loses control at the sound of the siren.

3627
02:55:09,010 --> 02:55:10,150
Oh my gosh!

3628
02:55:10,190 --> 02:55:11,090
It's a good thing I checked!

3629
02:55:12,010 --> 02:55:13,230
It's a good thing I checked!

3630
02:55:14,530 --> 02:55:15,470
See, it's stuff like that.

3631
02:55:18,770 --> 02:55:22,130
Like I know I said that like if I miss something, just let me know.

3632
02:55:22,270 --> 02:55:23,750
But let me have a chance.

3633
02:55:23,990 --> 02:55:25,150
Don't like tell me immediately.

3634
02:55:25,330 --> 02:55:27,010
Let me have a chance to look around a bit, you know?

3635
02:55:28,190 --> 02:55:29,990
Let me have a chance to look around a bit.

3636
02:55:36,620 --> 02:55:37,020
Oh!

3637
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:37,760
Oh!

3638
02:55:37,820 --> 02:55:38,940
It gets all of them at once!

3639
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:39,440
Oh shoot!

3640
02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:39,860
Uh...

3641
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:40,500
Shoot, shoot.

3642
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:42,420
Oh my god!

3643
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:42,900
The timing!

3644
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:43,260
No!

3645
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:43,520
Ah!

3646
02:55:43,660 --> 02:55:44,040
What the?

3647
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:46,940
It literally like rejected me.

3648
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:51,060
I got all of them at once though.

3649
02:55:56,580 --> 02:55:57,200
Oh please.

3650
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:00,720
Where'd my coins go?

3651
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:03,320
Oh!

3652
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:04,020
I made it!

3653
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:04,220
Yeah!

3654
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:07,720
Um...

3655
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:10,040
What's this?

3656
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:11,240
Ooh!

3657
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:13,640
That looks so soft.

3658
02:56:20,770 --> 02:56:21,790
Excuse me!

3659
02:56:23,730 --> 02:56:25,090
Can I help you?

3660
02:56:30,860 --> 02:56:31,460
Yeah!

3661
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:34,940
I love being big and I love to destroy.

3662
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:37,500
I love being big and I love to destroy!

3663
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:37,880
Aaaa!

3664
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:38,380
Aaaa!

3665
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:38,960
Aaaa!

3666
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:39,620
Secret!

3667
02:56:40,260 --> 02:56:40,860
Secret!

3668
02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:41,160
Secret!

3669
02:56:41,180 --> 02:56:41,620
Secret.

3670
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:44,060
Secret.

3671
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:49,900
What if I... Does it stay that way though?

3672
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:52,220
How long does it stay?

3673
02:56:52,760 --> 02:56:54,200
I see, I see.

3674
02:57:16,530 --> 02:57:18,540
Take that, take that, take that.

3675
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:19,900
Nice.

3676
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:21,320
Okay.

3677
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:23,000
Secret.

3678
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:33,080
Oh, oh.

3679
02:57:46,650 --> 02:57:47,970
There's like 10 of them there!

3680
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:51,890
Oh wow, I got a really good aim with that one, huh?

3681
02:57:57,250 --> 02:57:57,850
Oh my goodness.

3682
02:57:58,050 --> 02:58:01,650
I just have to not stand here, you know?

3683
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:08,940
Get sniped, nerd.

3684
02:58:09,260 --> 02:58:10,040
Yeah, I just have to...

3685
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:13,500
Oh gosh, am I going to make this one?

3686
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:17,140
Oh my gosh.

3687
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:18,540
Ah, no!

3688
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:20,580
I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it!

3689
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:21,320
No!

3690
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:31,640
Get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed, get washed!

3691
02:58:38,530 --> 02:58:39,770
Still want to get this guy though.

3692
02:58:40,570 --> 02:58:41,330
Oh, oh my god.

3693
02:58:41,370 --> 02:58:42,170
Wait, wait.

3694
02:58:42,410 --> 02:58:43,410
Oh, that was so close.

3695
02:58:45,950 --> 02:58:47,910
Hold on, I'll come for you in like two seconds.

3696
02:58:47,990 --> 02:58:48,490
Okay, hold on.

3697
02:58:57,480 --> 02:58:58,780
I need the coins!

3698
02:59:02,860 --> 02:59:06,840
Oh my god.

3699
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:09,940
Pure-hearted puppet.

3700
02:59:10,780 --> 02:59:12,160
Prone to losing their head.

3701
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:16,260
This is so... What's the game?

3702
02:59:23,870 --> 02:59:24,610
Who is that?

3703
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:25,290
Maybe I don't know.

3704
02:59:27,030 --> 02:59:28,670
The hair looks like that guy.

3705
02:59:34,590 --> 02:59:36,110
From Puppeteer, a PS3 game.

3706
02:59:36,330 --> 02:59:37,250
I've never heard of it.

3707
02:59:40,110 --> 02:59:43,670
Looks like... Oh gosh, I can't remember the game name.

3708
02:59:44,290 --> 02:59:44,730
Whatever.

3709
02:59:45,710 --> 02:59:46,150
Yeah!

3710
02:59:46,370 --> 02:59:46,810
Destroy!

3711
02:59:48,110 --> 02:59:48,850
Destruction, destruction!

3712
02:59:50,450 --> 02:59:53,050
Okay, so we got... Let's see.

3713
02:59:53,430 --> 02:59:57,030
We have all the puzzle pieces, we know where the warp is, and we got all the people.

3714
02:59:59,050 --> 03:00:00,930
Should I just leave or...

3715
03:00:07,410 --> 03:00:08,510
That didn't do anything.

3716
03:00:08,850 --> 03:00:09,210
Okay.

3717
03:00:33,740 --> 03:00:35,660
I'm trying to... Should I go back to the warp?

3718
03:00:35,740 --> 03:00:35,940
I...

3719
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:37,180
I don't know.

3720
03:00:37,220 --> 03:00:37,820
I can't decide.

3721
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:40,820
Oh, shoot.

3722
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:41,860
Oh, I got him.

3723
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:42,060
I did.

3724
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:44,380
Oh, oh!

3725
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:45,180
Nice, nice, nice.

3726
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:46,180
It trickled down.

3727
03:00:46,240 --> 03:00:46,680
It trickled down.

3728
03:00:47,060 --> 03:00:48,980
Because I know there's going to be the boss fight here.

3729
03:00:50,660 --> 03:00:51,020
Mmm...

3730
03:00:57,650 --> 03:00:58,130
Oh.

3731
03:00:59,770 --> 03:01:00,730
Never mind.

3732
03:01:01,470 --> 03:01:03,230
There's no boss fight.

3733
03:01:08,550 --> 03:01:10,350
This game, I swear.

3734
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:13,090
How do you know when there's a boss fight and when there's not?

3735
03:01:13,810 --> 03:01:15,910
Never let Mint into a fine china shop.

3736
03:01:20,780 --> 03:01:22,620
It said... I don't know.

3737
03:01:33,030 --> 03:01:34,530
To keep you on your toes.

3738
03:01:34,990 --> 03:01:35,470
Men!

3739
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:40,840
You know what?

3740
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:41,740
I'm going to go back and get it.

3741
03:01:42,780 --> 03:01:43,760
I'm going to go back and get it.

3742
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:44,740
I'm going to go back and get it.

3743
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:45,960
I'm going to go back and get it!

3744
03:01:46,380 --> 03:01:46,980
We got this.

3745
03:01:47,180 --> 03:01:48,280
It wasn't that far in.

3746
03:01:49,380 --> 03:01:50,380
It wasn't that far in.

3747
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:51,100
I think we can do it.

3748
03:01:51,180 --> 03:01:51,760
I think we can do it.

3749
03:01:54,680 --> 03:01:54,960
Speedrun.

3750
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:57,340
Did they just floss in your face?

3751
03:01:58,640 --> 03:01:58,920
Yes.

3752
03:02:00,180 --> 03:02:00,740
They did.

3753
03:02:01,700 --> 03:02:02,940
And we can get more coins.

3754
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:06,040
But I'm not going to get... Okay, we don't need you.

3755
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:07,780
I'm not going to waste... Don't waste my coins!

3756
03:02:09,380 --> 03:02:10,920
Wait, where is the little sponge?

3757
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,760
I get him down here?

3758
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:17,580
Oh yeah, he's stuck in there.

3759
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:17,940
That's right.

3760
03:02:20,240 --> 03:02:20,640
Speedrun.

3761
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:21,040
Speedrun.

3762
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:26,410
Become sponge!

3763
03:02:27,470 --> 03:02:30,310
I forgot I had an outfit since I was a sponge the whole time.

3764
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:35,700
Give me more money.

3765
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:36,600
Oh, never mind.

3766
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:37,920
Stingy.

3767
03:02:38,980 --> 03:02:39,380
Okay.

3768
03:02:43,280 --> 03:02:44,060
Oh, my money.

3769
03:02:45,820 --> 03:02:47,520
More money, more problems.

3770
03:02:56,550 --> 03:02:57,310
Destroy.

3771
03:02:57,470 --> 03:02:58,150
Destroy everything.

3772
03:02:59,090 --> 03:02:59,850
Gosh.

3773
03:03:05,730 --> 03:03:07,150
So satisfying.

3774
03:03:07,690 --> 03:03:10,290
You guys don't understand how satisfying it is.

3775
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:12,350
It's so satisfying.

3776
03:03:27,630 --> 03:03:28,530
Get more money.

3777
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:34,290
Oh, I can't get that big money yet.

3778
03:03:45,600 --> 03:03:47,480
Did I say this is my favorite power-up?

3779
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:49,380
It's a good power-up to be a favorite one.

3780
03:03:49,460 --> 03:03:50,160
I'll just say that.

3781
03:03:58,540 --> 03:03:59,300
Okay, we're back.

3782
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:00,660
It's right here.

3783
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:06,640
Oh, I didn't mean to slide down so fast, but...

3784
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:07,220
Speedrunning!

3785
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:11,860
Oh, my God.

3786
03:04:12,980 --> 03:04:14,240
I was trying to run away.

3787
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:15,160
On my depth perception.

3788
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:17,420
That's okay.

3789
03:04:17,560 --> 03:04:18,020
Come here.

3790
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:18,460
Come here.

3791
03:04:18,860 --> 03:04:19,500
Come here.

3792
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:19,960
Come here.

3793
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:20,540
Come here.

3794
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:20,880
Come here.

3795
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:20,980
Come here.

3796
03:04:35,430 --> 03:04:36,430
Sludgy man, die!

3797
03:04:39,830 --> 03:04:40,350
Okay.

3798
03:04:41,050 --> 03:04:41,810
All right.

3799
03:04:43,150 --> 03:04:43,930
Can we...

3800
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:44,750
We can't...

3801
03:04:46,410 --> 03:04:48,450
Could we go up from this way, I wonder?

3802
03:04:49,170 --> 03:04:50,210
Maybe not.

3803
03:04:51,330 --> 03:04:52,870
Let's grab some money since I'm here.

3804
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:58,000
Oh, no.

3805
03:04:58,140 --> 03:04:58,640
Never mind.

3806
03:04:58,760 --> 03:04:59,120
No.

3807
03:05:09,060 --> 03:05:10,420
You keep the money.

3808
03:05:11,180 --> 03:05:12,220
Oh, that's...

3809
03:05:12,360 --> 03:05:12,560
That's not...

3810
03:05:14,340 --> 03:05:14,840
All

3811
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:32,560
right, guys.

3812
03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:33,100
We're here.

3813
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:36,080
We're here.

3814
03:05:36,660 --> 03:05:37,420
We're here.

3815
03:05:38,140 --> 03:05:38,880
We're here.

3816
03:05:40,840 --> 03:05:41,340
Okay.

3817
03:05:41,940 --> 03:05:43,280
Now I just have to make it.

3818
03:05:51,340 --> 03:05:52,160
I'll make it.

3819
03:05:56,310 --> 03:05:57,610
Hey, Arnold reference.

3820
03:06:00,890 --> 03:06:02,830
Stop understanding my references.

3821
03:06:12,050 --> 03:06:12,930
I was cooking.

3822
03:06:14,810 --> 03:06:15,650
I was like,

3823
03:06:19,090 --> 03:06:19,250
wait.

3824
03:06:20,930 --> 03:06:21,690
What if I...

3825
03:06:23,430 --> 03:06:26,050
What if I stop midair?

3826
03:06:26,770 --> 03:06:27,670
What if I...

3827
03:06:34,020 --> 03:06:34,560
All right.

3828
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:36,500
Flood that sucker's house.

3829
03:06:38,660 --> 03:06:39,480
Oh, there we go!

3830
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:40,580
We got it.

3831
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:41,160
Oh, my gosh.

3832
03:06:41,200 --> 03:06:41,400
Wait.

3833
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:45,040
How do I defeat them?

3834
03:06:47,220 --> 03:06:47,620
Oh.

3835
03:06:47,720 --> 03:06:48,360
Oh, okay.

3836
03:06:48,380 --> 03:06:49,040
He's got to get tired.

3837
03:06:49,040 --> 03:06:50,320
I get it now.

3838
03:06:52,260 --> 03:06:53,420
Knock him while he's down.

3839
03:06:53,660 --> 03:06:54,560
Oh, never mind.

3840
03:06:54,760 --> 03:06:55,160
Shoot.

3841
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,140
What the hell am I supposed to do with you guys?

3842
03:07:04,660 --> 03:07:05,260
No, please.

3843
03:07:08,620 --> 03:07:09,240
Spin attack.

3844
03:07:09,660 --> 03:07:09,780
Oh.

3845
03:07:11,880 --> 03:07:13,400
Oh, because he's a little screw.

3846
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:16,040
Oh, I see.

3847
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:16,320
I see.

3848
03:07:17,780 --> 03:07:18,180
Okay.

3849
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:18,620
There we go.

3850
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:35,900
God, that's bothering me.

3851
03:07:36,340 --> 03:07:37,460
Where are we going to go?

3852
03:07:37,460 --> 03:07:38,440
Where are we going to go?

3853
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:39,080
Where are we going to go?

3854
03:07:40,800 --> 03:07:41,360
Clear.

3855
03:07:42,460 --> 03:07:43,520
Volcano world.

3856
03:07:43,720 --> 03:07:44,600
Furnace fever.

3857
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:48,560
Secret.

3858
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:51,120
See...

3859
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:51,280
Oh.

3860
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:54,480
Watch out.

3861
03:07:54,620 --> 03:07:55,100
Watch out!

3862
03:07:55,160 --> 03:07:55,420
Watch out!

3863
03:07:57,140 --> 03:07:57,960
Oh, no.

3864
03:07:59,620 --> 03:08:00,480
He's sick.

3865
03:08:01,840 --> 03:08:03,260
Oh, he's sick.

3866
03:08:03,480 --> 03:08:04,040
Lizard.

3867
03:08:06,620 --> 03:08:07,440
Oh, no.

3868
03:08:10,480 --> 03:08:11,860
Oh, oh, god.

3869
03:08:12,020 --> 03:08:13,300
Oh, Indiana Jones.

3870
03:08:13,580 --> 03:08:15,500
Oh, Indiana Jones.

3871
03:08:16,180 --> 03:08:17,120
Oh, my goodness.

3872
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:20,460
Wow.

3873
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:21,460
Wow.

3874
03:08:25,830 --> 03:08:27,150
Oh, cool.

3875
03:08:30,450 --> 03:08:31,070
Wow.

3876
03:08:31,290 --> 03:08:35,610
They forced to survive before you even get the Checkpoint.

3877
03:08:35,690 --> 03:08:36,230
That's crazy.

3878
03:08:36,230 --> 03:08:38,210
Oh, Lava Turtles!

3879
03:08:38,230 --> 03:08:38,910
They're so cute!

3880
03:08:42,150 --> 03:08:43,590
They're like, you gotta be good.

3881
03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:44,990
You gotta get good to...

3882
03:08:46,030 --> 03:08:48,230
To even... What?!

3883
03:08:49,530 --> 03:08:51,170
I hit your ass!

3884
03:08:51,650 --> 03:08:52,930
Good thing I got the checkpoint.

3885
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:01,240
Oh no, it's the...

3886
03:09:06,480 --> 03:09:07,000
Nice.

3887
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,340
Oh, oh, oh!

3888
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:10,060
I know how to defeat this guy now!

3889
03:09:13,480 --> 03:09:14,280
I got him!

3890
03:09:14,360 --> 03:09:14,660
I got him!

3891
03:09:31,160 --> 03:09:31,960
Oh, okay.

3892
03:09:35,530 --> 03:09:36,250
Oh my gosh!

3893
03:09:36,370 --> 03:09:37,090
Oh my god!

3894
03:09:37,470 --> 03:09:38,750
Oh, uh, pull him out!

3895
03:09:38,810 --> 03:09:39,030
Pull him out!

3896
03:09:39,890 --> 03:09:42,630
Okay, nice.

3897
03:09:44,090 --> 03:09:46,570
Once again, Astro Bot killing it with the music.

3898
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:50,050
Oh, honey!

3899
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:56,190
That's not how you kill him.

3900
03:09:56,950 --> 03:09:58,510
I don't even know if you can kill him.

3901
03:09:58,850 --> 03:09:59,450
Maybe not.

3902
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:07,440
Okay.

3903
03:10:07,940 --> 03:10:08,320
Okay.

3904
03:10:10,020 --> 03:10:10,740
Hot honey.

3905
03:10:11,560 --> 03:10:12,300
Puzzle piece behind?

3906
03:10:13,060 --> 03:10:13,820
Oh, I see it!

3907
03:10:13,880 --> 03:10:14,100
Thank you!

3908
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:19,100
How do I get up there?

3909
03:10:28,900 --> 03:10:30,220
Like, so I suppose.

3910
03:10:31,800 --> 03:10:34,780
Yeah, I wish I was a sponge again.

3911
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:43,960
I get so used to having the super powers, and the super powers are typically like, OP, that it makes me just be like, uh...

3912
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:46,080
What a waste to not have it anymore.

3913
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:47,700
You know?

3914
03:11:00,930 --> 03:11:02,350
Tire yourself out.

3915
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:07,120
Okay.

3916
03:11:08,700 --> 03:11:09,620
Lava sponge.

3917
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:10,980
Yeah, well, no.

3918
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:12,560
Well, I mean, I guess...

3919
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:15,280
I would have to be...

3920
03:11:15,280 --> 03:11:16,440
Uh, you know...

3921
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:18,520
I have to have pools of water everywhere.

3922
03:11:19,740 --> 03:11:20,580
Oh my gosh.

3923
03:11:21,540 --> 03:11:22,100
Woo!

3924
03:11:23,640 --> 03:11:24,280
We're gaming.

3925
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:25,240
We're gaming, everybody.

3926
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:28,680
Can I kill this guy?

3927
03:11:30,520 --> 03:11:30,920
Nope.

3928
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:32,180
You cannot kill them.

3929
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:32,480
Okay.

3930
03:11:32,600 --> 03:11:34,000
I gotta stop trying!

3931
03:11:34,760 --> 03:11:36,840
I gotta stop trying to kill these guys.

3932
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:43,820
I hear someone.

3933
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:54,600
Oh, no!

3934
03:11:54,800 --> 03:11:55,400
Wait, who is that?

3935
03:11:58,480 --> 03:11:58,880
Uh...

3936
03:11:59,900 --> 03:12:00,860
Oh, this is so cool.

3937
03:12:00,880 --> 03:12:01,780
They look like candles.

3938
03:12:03,680 --> 03:12:04,080
Uh...

3939
03:12:12,340 --> 03:12:12,740
Oh, this is so cool.

3940
03:12:12,740 --> 03:12:13,640
See the button?

3941
03:12:13,840 --> 03:12:14,040
Yeah.

3942
03:12:15,760 --> 03:12:16,120
Uh...

3943
03:12:16,120 --> 03:12:16,720
Oh!

3944
03:12:17,800 --> 03:12:18,160
Oh!

3945
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:19,360
Oh,

3946
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:23,480
wait.

3947
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:24,240
I think I understand.

3948
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:27,540
This is the way the platform moves.

3949
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:28,860
Oh, I think I get it.

3950
03:12:32,380 --> 03:12:32,740
Maybe.

3951
03:12:34,180 --> 03:12:34,900
Get closer.

3952
03:12:34,960 --> 03:12:35,500
Get closer.

3953
03:12:35,560 --> 03:12:36,020
Get closer.

3954
03:12:36,380 --> 03:12:36,720
Oh!

3955
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:37,000
Oh!

3956
03:12:37,140 --> 03:12:37,180
Oh!

3957
03:12:37,400 --> 03:12:37,760
Nice!

3958
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:38,140
Nice!

3959
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:38,260
Nice!

3960
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:38,520
I got it!

3961
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:38,700
I got it!

3962
03:12:38,700 --> 03:12:38,840
I got it!

3963
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:39,780
Oh!

3964
03:12:41,560 --> 03:12:41,920
Yeah!

3965
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:44,340
Yeah!

3966
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:44,500
Yeah!

3967
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:45,720
Okay.

3968
03:12:47,660 --> 03:12:48,700
I'm toasting.

3969
03:12:52,680 --> 03:12:53,720
I'm toasting.

3970
03:12:54,400 --> 03:12:54,920
Hey!

3971
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:55,680
Leave him alone!

3972
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:00,840
Who is this?

3973
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:03,060
We missed one.

3974
03:13:03,260 --> 03:13:05,220
Neon Avenger lights up any room she's in.

3975
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:05,740
We missed one!

3976
03:13:05,900 --> 03:13:06,440
Okay, wait.

3977
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:09,300
Where?

3978
03:13:12,520 --> 03:13:13,800
Not the fan.

3979
03:13:14,640 --> 03:13:15,900
Where did we miss?

3980
03:13:25,230 --> 03:13:26,930
Is it that platform down there?

3981
03:13:27,450 --> 03:13:27,970
Oh!

3982
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:32,300
See this skull?

3983
03:13:32,460 --> 03:13:32,820
Oh!

3984
03:13:32,940 --> 03:13:33,420
I see!

3985
03:13:33,540 --> 03:13:33,880
Oh!

3986
03:13:34,020 --> 03:13:34,820
I see it!

3987
03:13:34,820 --> 03:13:35,280
I see it!

3988
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:35,640
I see it!

3989
03:13:35,780 --> 03:13:37,560
I was so busy focused on the other guys.

3990
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:38,520
Ah!

3991
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:43,020
I don't think there's a way to get back over there, is there?

3992
03:13:43,240 --> 03:13:43,600
No!

3993
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:45,440
Why does it have to be a one-way?

3994
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:47,540
Oh, that's so rude.

3995
03:13:49,500 --> 03:13:49,860
Oh!

3996
03:13:49,900 --> 03:13:50,240
What is this?

3997
03:13:51,360 --> 03:13:51,720
Oh!

3998
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:52,980
Oh!

3999
03:13:54,800 --> 03:13:55,160
Not

4000
03:14:02,960 --> 03:14:03,320
infinite!

4001
03:14:03,460 --> 03:14:04,320
Not infinite at all!

4002
03:14:12,070 --> 03:14:12,430
Wait.

4003
03:14:12,510 --> 03:14:13,130
Where do I go?

4004
03:14:13,710 --> 03:14:14,070
Oh!

4005
03:14:14,070 --> 03:14:14,810
Oh!

4006
03:14:14,850 --> 03:14:14,950
Here.

4007
03:14:15,790 --> 03:14:16,510
Oh!

4008
03:14:16,790 --> 03:14:17,150
What?

4009
03:14:17,270 --> 03:14:17,630
Seriously?

4010
03:14:31,960 --> 03:14:32,320
Nice.

4011
03:14:33,980 --> 03:14:34,700
Nice.

4012
03:14:36,380 --> 03:14:38,280
I'll have to go back for that one guy.

4013
03:14:46,910 --> 03:14:47,950
I got you!

4014
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:54,870
It's Electric Vigilante from Courier to Conduit.

4015
03:14:55,970 --> 03:14:56,690
Who?

4016
03:14:57,790 --> 03:14:58,510
Oh!

4017
03:14:58,510 --> 03:14:58,690
Oh!

4018
03:14:59,910 --> 03:15:00,270
Oh!

4019
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:08,760
I have to jump for it.

4020
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:08,980
Oh.

4021
03:15:14,240 --> 03:15:15,600
I can do it one more time.

4022
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:24,570
There we go.

4023
03:15:28,710 --> 03:15:29,270
Let's see.

4024
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:35,660
Ducky!

4025
03:15:36,700 --> 03:15:37,060
Oh!

4026
03:15:37,160 --> 03:15:37,820
But it's not unlimited.

4027
03:15:38,520 --> 03:15:38,880
Oh!

4028
03:15:38,900 --> 03:15:39,640
Which way do I go?

4029
03:15:39,780 --> 03:15:40,000
Which...

4030
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:40,560
How do I...

4031
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:40,720
Okay.

4032
03:15:40,780 --> 03:15:41,100
Hold on.

4033
03:15:41,280 --> 03:15:43,700
What is that over...

4034
03:15:43,700 --> 03:15:44,640
What is going on over there?

4035
03:15:44,760 --> 03:15:45,100
Okay.

4036
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:46,400
We're going to go over there first.

4037
03:15:46,760 --> 03:15:47,120
Okay.

4038
03:15:47,140 --> 03:15:47,260
Okay.

4039
03:15:47,280 --> 03:15:47,720
Thank you, Ducky.

4040
03:15:47,860 --> 03:15:48,080
Okay.

4041
03:15:50,120 --> 03:15:51,400
I had to plan my route.

4042
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:52,340
I had to plan my route.

4043
03:15:55,400 --> 03:15:56,400
What's going on here?

4044
03:15:59,120 --> 03:15:59,480
Okay.

4045
03:15:59,480 --> 03:16:00,500
We got the last guy.

4046
03:16:01,220 --> 03:16:01,580
Nice.

4047
03:16:02,740 --> 03:16:03,100
Oh!

4048
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:05,280
I'm sauna-ing.

4049
03:16:05,640 --> 03:16:06,280
Very cute.

4050
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:09,060
Oh.

4051
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:10,440
I was going to say, and now I'm trapped.

4052
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:12,000
But I'm not actually trapped.

4053
03:16:14,440 --> 03:16:14,800
Oh!

4054
03:16:14,900 --> 03:16:15,580
Come on!

4055
03:16:22,850 --> 03:16:24,050
But I have to go back over there.

4056
03:16:24,050 --> 03:16:24,710
Which is kind of nice.

4057
03:16:34,190 --> 03:16:34,770
Oh, gosh.

4058
03:16:34,810 --> 03:16:35,170
Oh, gosh.

4059
03:16:35,610 --> 03:16:36,210
Oh, gosh.

4060
03:16:36,250 --> 03:16:36,570
Oh, gosh.

4061
03:16:37,030 --> 03:16:37,530
Oh, gosh.

4062
03:16:37,570 --> 03:16:37,730
Oh, gosh.

4063
03:16:38,450 --> 03:16:39,310
I don't have enough!

4064
03:16:42,860 --> 03:16:43,540
I gamed.

4065
03:16:44,960 --> 03:16:46,000
You guys, I gamed.

4066
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:50,220
You guys, I gamed.

4067
03:16:51,900 --> 03:16:52,940
Gaming, gaming, gaming!

4068
03:16:56,420 --> 03:16:56,760
I...

4069
03:17:01,220 --> 03:17:02,780
Oh, it doesn't let you go back at all.

4070
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:05,840
It says, nah.

4071
03:17:06,920 --> 03:17:07,640
If you miss it, you lose.

4072
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:07,940
I missed him.

4073
03:17:08,920 --> 03:17:09,800
Too bad.

4074
03:17:10,340 --> 03:17:10,780
Loser.

4075
03:17:12,520 --> 03:17:13,300
Too bad.

4076
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:13,760
Idiot.

4077
03:17:15,480 --> 03:17:16,540
Oh, they're flossing.

4078
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:35,940
Yoope!

4079
03:17:37,960 --> 03:17:39,360
Let's go get that guy real quick.

4080
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:42,800
Secret!

4081
03:17:44,740 --> 03:17:46,140
We can get him really fast.

4082
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:48,780
He's kind of towards the beginning, so...

4083
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:50,660
We can get it.

4084
03:17:51,160 --> 03:17:52,320
We can get it.

4085
03:17:52,600 --> 03:17:53,800
You left on the snake?

4086
03:17:53,820 --> 03:17:53,980
Yeah.

4087
03:17:55,080 --> 03:17:59,720
You think that he would be in the snake area, but...

4088
03:17:59,720 --> 03:18:02,820
Well, we only have one more world.

4089
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:04,020
Oh gosh.

4090
03:18:04,200 --> 03:18:05,620
We have one more world still.

4091
03:18:06,780 --> 03:18:07,780
To go through.

4092
03:18:08,200 --> 03:18:09,940
And we'll see if he's in there.

4093
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:12,140
We're not quite sure yet.

4094
03:18:14,220 --> 03:18:14,820
Secret.

4095
03:18:31,490 --> 03:18:32,730
Tire yourself out.

4096
03:18:36,750 --> 03:18:38,790
You know I probably don't have to get all the guys.

4097
03:18:38,930 --> 03:18:41,030
But it also makes things a bit easier.

4098
03:18:41,810 --> 03:18:44,130
To just kill them and get them out of the way.

4099
03:18:44,410 --> 03:18:46,130
Oh my goodness.

4100
03:18:58,180 --> 03:18:58,620
Okay.

4101
03:18:58,620 --> 03:18:59,840
So it's over there.

4102
03:19:00,100 --> 03:19:00,720
It's over there.

4103
03:19:00,820 --> 03:19:00,940
Okay.

4104
03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:02,900
They dropped more coins too.

4105
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:03,440
Exactly.

4106
03:19:03,800 --> 03:19:04,240
Exactly.

4107
03:19:07,160 --> 03:19:07,600
Okay.

4108
03:19:07,720 --> 03:19:08,200
Over there.

4109
03:19:08,240 --> 03:19:08,540
I see.

4110
03:19:08,620 --> 03:19:08,820
I see.

4111
03:19:10,560 --> 03:19:12,600
I'm not even going to pay attention to these guys.

4112
03:19:14,360 --> 03:19:14,740
Um...

4113
03:19:17,210 --> 03:19:19,360
3, 2, 1.

4114
03:19:24,260 --> 03:19:24,610
Okay.

4115
03:19:25,240 --> 03:19:26,550
Oh, I think I can just go.

4116
03:19:34,040 --> 03:19:34,740
Secret.

4117
03:19:44,510 --> 03:19:45,560
First try.

4118
03:19:49,720 --> 03:19:50,560
What's this?

4119
03:19:52,120 --> 03:19:53,520
Roguish conduit.

4120
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:54,860
He's got the touch.

4121
03:19:57,120 --> 03:19:58,760
All these guys are from Infamous.

4122
03:19:59,420 --> 03:20:00,900
Never played that game before.

4123
03:20:01,740 --> 03:20:02,880
Can I just leave now?

4124
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:08,360
Can I just leave the planet?

4125
03:20:12,170 --> 03:20:12,610
Nice.

4126
03:20:13,850 --> 03:20:15,150
I want to do gacha.

4127
03:20:16,070 --> 03:20:17,730
We'll do gacha after in the next world.

4128
03:20:18,690 --> 03:20:19,990
How much time do I have left?

4129
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:21,910
I can keep going.

4130
03:20:22,110 --> 03:20:22,430
I can keep going.

4131
03:20:24,730 --> 03:20:25,170
Secret.

4132
03:20:25,170 --> 03:20:25,850
Oh gosh.

4133
03:20:25,970 --> 03:20:26,690
This game is so fun.

4134
03:20:27,030 --> 03:20:28,210
One day I'm just going to like play...

4135
03:20:28,210 --> 03:20:29,410
Play Endurance.

4136
03:20:30,570 --> 03:20:31,630
This is so fun.

4137
03:20:33,630 --> 03:20:34,150
Okay.

4138
03:20:34,990 --> 03:20:35,510
Yeah.

4139
03:20:35,730 --> 03:20:36,810
You turn gold.

4140
03:20:37,130 --> 03:20:38,070
Trapped in time.

4141
03:20:39,830 --> 03:20:40,350
Aww.

4142
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:50,120
Get that.

4143
03:20:50,140 --> 03:20:50,760
Get the money.

4144
03:20:51,080 --> 03:20:51,600
Yeah.

4145
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:51,840
Yeah.

4146
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:52,040
Yeah.

4147
03:20:52,160 --> 03:20:53,020
Get the money.

4148
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:54,260
Whoa.

4149
03:20:54,320 --> 03:20:54,660
What was that?

4150
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:56,320
Was that someone I need to get?

4151
03:20:57,060 --> 03:20:57,580
Wait.

4152
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:04,340
It's nice because none of the levels feel...

4153
03:21:05,760 --> 03:21:06,220
Um...

4154
03:21:06,220 --> 03:21:06,960
Like...

4155
03:21:07,460 --> 03:21:08,760
Too long or anything.

4156
03:21:11,900 --> 03:21:16,020
Like I just feel like there are type of levels that I can just go on and play forever and ever.

4157
03:21:16,260 --> 03:21:16,460
Hey.

4158
03:21:16,500 --> 03:21:16,800
Come on.

4159
03:21:18,480 --> 03:21:19,240
I'm a chicken.

4160
03:21:19,260 --> 03:21:19,820
Chicken hat.

4161
03:21:21,660 --> 03:21:22,300
What's it do?

4162
03:21:24,120 --> 03:21:24,580
Okay.

4163
03:21:27,980 --> 03:21:28,440
Oh.

4164
03:21:32,970 --> 03:21:34,670
Can I only go up?

4165
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:42,340
Why is all the music so good?

4166
03:21:43,220 --> 03:21:45,380
All the music just makes me feel...

4167
03:21:46,660 --> 03:21:47,720
Nostalgic for something.

4168
03:21:49,060 --> 03:21:49,540
Like...

4169
03:21:52,620 --> 03:21:53,100
Oh.

4170
03:21:55,100 --> 03:21:56,160
Is there anything else?

4171
03:22:02,430 --> 03:22:02,910
No.

4172
03:22:03,030 --> 03:22:03,850
I hate this guy.

4173
03:22:04,070 --> 03:22:05,030
Because he takes me...

4174
03:22:05,030 --> 03:22:05,570
I have to wait.

4175
03:22:05,950 --> 03:22:06,990
I want to just fight.

4176
03:22:07,930 --> 03:22:08,410
Wow.

4177
03:22:08,510 --> 03:22:09,430
I just want to fight.

4178
03:22:09,630 --> 03:22:10,510
I don't want to wait.

4179
03:22:16,500 --> 03:22:17,460
This guy.

4180
03:22:17,480 --> 03:22:18,180
These guys again.

4181
03:22:18,860 --> 03:22:19,340
This guy.

4182
03:22:21,880 --> 03:22:22,680
Just double...

4183
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:22,700
Oh.

4184
03:22:22,800 --> 03:22:22,880
Wait.

4185
03:22:22,900 --> 03:22:23,260
Let's see.

4186
03:22:25,140 --> 03:22:26,180
I knew it.

4187
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:31,400
It does sound like Shantae.

4188
03:22:31,440 --> 03:22:31,700
Oh.

4189
03:22:31,720 --> 03:22:33,840
It does sound like Shantae.

4190
03:22:33,880 --> 03:22:34,460
I hear it.

4191
03:22:36,820 --> 03:22:37,760
I hear it.

4192
03:22:37,760 --> 03:22:38,180
I hear it.

4193
03:22:41,800 --> 03:22:42,240
Oh.

4194
03:22:42,300 --> 03:22:42,680
Wait.

4195
03:22:43,160 --> 03:22:43,600
Oh.

4196
03:22:43,960 --> 03:22:44,240
What?

4197
03:22:45,260 --> 03:22:46,340
What am I missing here?

4198
03:22:47,300 --> 03:22:47,740
Oh.

4199
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:48,860
I just have the chicken again.

4200
03:22:49,320 --> 03:22:50,020
Just kidding.

4201
03:22:50,180 --> 03:22:50,520
Oh.

4202
03:22:51,080 --> 03:22:51,520
Oh.

4203
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:52,160
Oh.

4204
03:22:52,620 --> 03:22:52,720
Oh.

4205
03:22:52,740 --> 03:22:53,640
So far...

4206
03:22:53,640 --> 03:22:54,560
I think we're good.

4207
03:22:56,560 --> 03:22:58,240
I want to play more Shantae.

4208
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:00,660
I hear you.

4209
03:23:02,020 --> 03:23:03,020
I hear you.

4210
03:23:03,860 --> 03:23:04,860
I hear you.

4211
03:23:05,580 --> 03:23:06,740
I hear you.

4212
03:23:08,460 --> 03:23:09,440
Where is the other guy?

4213
03:23:09,660 --> 03:23:10,180
Oh.

4214
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:10,560
There he is.

4215
03:23:12,440 --> 03:23:12,960
Oh

4216
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:20,920
my god.

4217
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:21,380
I hear you.

4218
03:23:32,230 --> 03:23:32,750
Easy.

4219
03:23:35,110 --> 03:23:35,630
Sorry.

4220
03:23:35,630 --> 03:23:35,730
I just have to wait.

4221
03:23:35,730 --> 03:23:36,250
Is there anything else in here?

4222
03:23:36,350 --> 03:23:36,990
So hard to tell.

4223
03:23:38,830 --> 03:23:39,650
Nothing else.

4224
03:23:42,630 --> 03:23:43,070
Oh.

4225
03:23:43,530 --> 03:23:46,110
I thought maybe there might be something at the top.

4226
03:23:47,450 --> 03:23:48,030
You know.

4227
03:23:48,790 --> 03:23:49,910
Like all the way up there.

4228
03:23:50,870 --> 03:23:51,810
There could be.

4229
03:23:52,670 --> 03:23:53,710
There could be.

4230
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:00,920
What the hell are you?

4231
03:24:01,300 --> 03:24:01,740
Oh.

4232
03:24:01,780 --> 03:24:02,520
I got to grab your tail.

4233
03:24:03,100 --> 03:24:03,540
And...

4234
03:24:03,540 --> 03:24:04,080
Oh.

4235
03:24:04,820 --> 03:24:07,100
I think I did not do that correctly.

4236
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:08,620
Oh.

4237
03:24:20,670 --> 03:24:21,070
Oh.

4238
03:24:23,050 --> 03:24:24,190
Wait for what does a new game.

4239
03:24:24,310 --> 03:24:25,050
Yars rising.

4240
03:24:25,270 --> 03:24:25,570
Oh, really?

4241
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:37,700
What was that?

4242
03:24:38,060 --> 03:24:39,460
It didn't seem like water.

4243
03:24:40,820 --> 03:24:41,520
I don't know.

4244
03:24:44,780 --> 03:24:45,440
What's in here?

4245
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:46,360
Oh.

4246
03:24:49,500 --> 03:24:49,900
Wait.

4247
03:24:50,880 --> 03:24:51,680
If I...

4248
03:24:53,080 --> 03:24:53,780
And then...

4249
03:24:53,780 --> 03:24:54,200
Oh, wait.

4250
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:55,100
How do I use this thing again?

4251
03:24:57,520 --> 03:24:58,540
How do I use this thing again?

4252
03:25:24,710 --> 03:25:25,750
Oh shoot!

4253
03:25:26,010 --> 03:25:26,950
Oh my god!

4254
03:25:27,110 --> 03:25:28,550
I thought I was about to die!

4255
03:25:36,790 --> 03:25:38,130
What a drop, seriously!

4256
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:47,320
Maybe it's the last... two...

4257
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:53,460
In the end, I die.

4258
03:25:54,240 --> 03:25:56,120
In the end, I even die.

4259
03:25:56,540 --> 03:25:57,780
So what's the point?

4260
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:11,200
It goes so fast!

4261
03:26:12,260 --> 03:26:15,460
Stop it!

4262
03:26:25,210 --> 03:26:26,770
Oh my god!

4263
03:26:42,750 --> 03:26:44,170
Give me your flower!

4264
03:26:55,330 --> 03:26:57,350
Okay, does he start going really fast?

4265
03:26:58,810 --> 03:26:59,610
Oh, so close!

4266
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:04,860
There we go!

4267
03:27:06,080 --> 03:27:07,420
Holy cow!

4268
03:27:24,410 --> 03:27:25,230
It's over there!

4269
03:27:31,620 --> 03:27:32,540
Reggie, welcome to the membership!

4270
03:27:32,680 --> 03:27:33,060
Thank you!

4271
03:27:33,640 --> 03:27:34,660
Is this an actual game?

4272
03:27:34,720 --> 03:27:37,360
I thought this was just some sort of Playstation advertisement campaign.

4273
03:27:38,060 --> 03:27:39,780
Yeah, it's like the best game ever!

4274
03:27:50,740 --> 03:27:52,600
Hold on, I want to check over here.

4275
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:53,460
I want to check over here.

4276
03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:56,220
To satisfy my own curiosity?

4277
03:27:56,640 --> 03:27:57,000
Okay.

4278
03:27:57,180 --> 03:27:58,960
Well, at least I got coins, okay?

4279
03:28:08,870 --> 03:28:10,770
Yeah, I guess you could say it's both, huh?

4280
03:28:12,210 --> 03:28:12,730
Oh.

4281
03:28:18,530 --> 03:28:20,750
I saw someone say boost inside here.

4282
03:28:20,990 --> 03:28:22,950
Which I think I tried before.

4283
03:28:23,430 --> 03:28:24,590
That didn't do anything.

4284
03:28:27,950 --> 03:28:29,870
Um... in here, maybe?

4285
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:46,860
I see you down there!

4286
03:28:47,980 --> 03:28:49,580
How do I boost down?

4287
03:28:54,100 --> 03:28:55,660
How do I boost down?

4288
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:09,910
Where's your tail?

4289
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:17,800
Oh, now we can get him.

4290
03:29:22,650 --> 03:29:23,770
Never mind?

4291
03:29:25,530 --> 03:29:26,090
Wait!

4292
03:29:26,350 --> 03:29:26,850
No!

4293
03:29:27,890 --> 03:29:29,170
I thought we were going...

4294
03:29:43,790 --> 03:29:44,830
Thank you, Brick!

4295
03:29:45,530 --> 03:29:48,230
Glad you're having so much fun with this.

4296
03:29:48,390 --> 03:29:54,350
In case you missed it or forgot, the PS5 should come with Astro's Playroom pre-installed if you want a little more Astro sometimes.

4297
03:29:54,730 --> 03:29:57,330
Is there any chance we get a carry on stream this spooky season?

4298
03:29:57,750 --> 03:29:58,190
Maybe.

4299
03:29:58,310 --> 03:30:03,330
I've been keeping a list of games I want to do.

4300
03:30:03,830 --> 03:30:05,330
I think I might drop from here.

4301
03:30:05,970 --> 03:30:06,410
Wait!

4302
03:30:07,670 --> 03:30:08,110
No...

4303
03:30:08,990 --> 03:30:10,970
I've been keeping a list of games I want to do.

4304
03:30:12,070 --> 03:30:12,450
Uh...

4305
03:30:14,670 --> 03:30:15,050
So...

4306
03:30:18,350 --> 03:30:19,230
There's a ledge below.

4307
03:30:19,410 --> 03:30:19,990
There it is?

4308
03:30:21,450 --> 03:30:22,170
Over here, maybe?

4309
03:30:22,750 --> 03:30:23,130
Oh!

4310
03:30:23,310 --> 03:30:23,950
I see the...

4311
03:30:23,950 --> 03:30:25,350
It literally, like, shows you.

4312
03:30:25,410 --> 03:30:27,130
It's like, hey, by the way, there's, like, a ledge here.

4313
03:30:28,890 --> 03:30:30,330
And then even, like...

4314
03:30:30,330 --> 03:30:31,270
Oh, God.

4315
03:30:31,330 --> 03:30:32,110
There's someone by our side.

4316
03:30:32,190 --> 03:30:32,370
Oh!

4317
03:30:35,790 --> 03:30:36,370
Thank you!

4318
03:30:38,470 --> 03:30:39,230
Dream Chaser.

4319
03:30:39,450 --> 03:30:40,470
That's the right to bear.

4320
03:30:40,470 --> 03:30:41,110
Bear arms.

4321
03:30:47,810 --> 03:30:52,930
So I can't say definitively yes, but even if not for spooky season...

4322
03:30:55,390 --> 03:30:55,870
Um...

4323
03:30:56,610 --> 03:30:58,670
I like playing horror games all the time.

4324
03:30:59,270 --> 03:31:01,370
Where is the puzzle piece that I missed?

4325
03:31:01,970 --> 03:31:03,770
Where is the puzzle piece that I missed?

4326
03:31:06,130 --> 03:31:06,610
Don't

4327
03:31:15,850 --> 03:31:16,110
tell me.

4328
03:31:16,210 --> 03:31:16,730
Can I get a hint?

4329
03:31:17,210 --> 03:31:17,690
Anybody?

4330
03:31:18,030 --> 03:31:18,770
Wait, what's this?

4331
03:31:23,670 --> 03:31:25,210
Oh, that's just where they would pop out.

4332
03:31:27,630 --> 03:31:28,070
Golden.

4333
03:31:35,670 --> 03:31:36,110
Uh...

4334
03:31:40,070 --> 03:31:41,010
Was it this...

4335
03:31:41,010 --> 03:31:43,050
Was it when that snake was chasing...

4336
03:31:43,050 --> 03:31:44,430
Whatever that snake was chasing?

4337
03:31:44,810 --> 03:31:45,250
Inked.

4338
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:47,390
Thanks, paper bag friend.

4339
03:31:47,590 --> 03:31:48,610
You're a real one.

4340
03:31:48,650 --> 03:31:49,290
You're a real friend.

4341
03:31:51,830 --> 03:31:52,270
Wait,

4342
03:31:56,510 --> 03:31:56,950
stop it.

4343
03:31:58,510 --> 03:31:58,950
Yes.

4344
03:31:59,170 --> 03:32:00,330
Oh, come on.

4345
03:32:00,330 --> 03:32:00,510
Stop!

4346
03:32:03,010 --> 03:32:03,450
So

4347
03:32:21,810 --> 03:32:22,250
left!

4348
03:32:22,290 --> 03:32:22,350
Oh!

4349
03:32:22,350 --> 03:32:22,850
I'm live!

4350
03:32:23,610 --> 03:32:24,790
That's so live.

4351
03:32:28,050 --> 03:32:28,550
Oh!

4352
03:32:29,790 --> 03:32:31,730
I hate the ones that are like that.

4353
03:32:35,010 --> 03:32:35,830
Oh, whoops!

4354
03:32:35,870 --> 03:32:36,430
I forgot to grab it.

4355
03:32:38,670 --> 03:32:41,830
Oh, there you go guys.

4356
03:32:49,150 --> 03:32:50,150
Oh, come on.

4357
03:32:50,450 --> 03:32:51,530
Don't be like that.

4358
03:32:53,870 --> 03:32:54,950
Don't be like that.

4359
03:32:55,610 --> 03:32:56,110
Ooo!

4360
03:33:09,050 --> 03:33:10,350
Oh my god, I lived.

4361
03:33:15,620 --> 03:33:16,200
That's right.

4362
03:33:18,420 --> 03:33:19,940
Actual Mario sand level.

4363
03:33:22,700 --> 03:33:23,120
Yippee!

4364
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:24,380
Oh, I think I got a normie.

4365
03:33:30,380 --> 03:33:30,800
What?

4366
03:33:30,800 --> 03:33:37,080
So there's still... okay, so there's the one and then there's a bunch of guys, but there's the one other piece that we can get.

4367
03:33:49,280 --> 03:33:49,900
Oh!

4368
03:33:51,420 --> 03:33:54,860
Oh my god, I'm buried in riches!

4369
03:33:55,280 --> 03:33:57,520
I'm buried in... oh my gosh!

4370
03:33:58,020 --> 03:34:00,140
Can you guys even see me?

4371
03:34:00,340 --> 03:34:01,420
Can you guys see me?

4372
03:34:02,540 --> 03:34:03,740
You can see me there.

4373
03:34:09,870 --> 03:34:10,810
Oh my goodness.

4374
03:34:20,440 --> 03:34:21,680
So fun!

4375
03:34:23,840 --> 03:34:27,800
Sorry, I'm always constantly looking around just seeing if I got everything, you know?

4376
03:34:29,640 --> 03:34:30,040
Ouch!

4377
03:34:31,460 --> 03:34:31,820
Oh!

4378
03:34:32,180 --> 03:34:33,080
Oh, I got him.

4379
03:34:33,180 --> 03:34:34,920
I can stun him!

4380
03:34:35,220 --> 03:34:36,080
Oh, that's so good.

4381
03:34:37,500 --> 03:34:38,840
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

4382
03:34:53,710 --> 03:34:55,290
Oh wait, I didn't stun him.

4383
03:34:55,350 --> 03:34:56,730
He got tired on his own.

4384
03:34:57,990 --> 03:34:59,470
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4385
03:35:20,290 --> 03:35:21,050
Spidey bird!

4386
03:35:21,430 --> 03:35:22,130
Membership accurate!

4387
03:35:23,370 --> 03:35:24,010
Oh yeah.

4388
03:35:24,150 --> 03:35:25,530
Oh my god, he almost died in here.

4389
03:35:28,030 --> 03:35:29,170
We missed one.

4390
03:35:32,230 --> 03:35:33,390
We missed one.

4391
03:35:35,170 --> 03:35:36,370
Look, that could've been you.

4392
03:35:36,590 --> 03:35:37,650
That was almost him.

4393
03:35:37,750 --> 03:35:38,170
For real.

4394
03:35:39,630 --> 03:35:40,650
We missed one.

4395
03:35:44,450 --> 03:35:45,270
Up there?

4396
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:53,380
I was so distracted by my riches.

4397
03:35:55,700 --> 03:35:56,900
I almost missed it.

4398
03:35:58,440 --> 03:35:59,420
Oh, never mind.

4399
03:36:01,800 --> 03:36:03,600
Never mind, but these are...

4400
03:36:03,600 --> 03:36:04,260
More riches!

4401
03:36:04,900 --> 03:36:05,200
Yippee!

4402
03:36:08,320 --> 03:36:09,820
Wait, I hear someone.

4403
03:36:17,810 --> 03:36:20,550
I thought I heard someone going...

4404
03:36:34,880 --> 03:36:35,360
Pause!

4405
03:36:37,280 --> 03:36:39,520
Oh my gosh, have you been waiting out this whole time?

4406
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:40,440
I'm so sorry, girl.

4407
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:42,260
One second, let me let my cat out.

4408
03:37:21,980 --> 03:37:23,460
My poor little girl!

4409
03:37:24,380 --> 03:37:25,680
I didn't hear her.

4410
03:37:26,520 --> 03:37:29,080
She knocked over so much stuff in my room.

4411
03:37:29,160 --> 03:37:30,060
I didn't hear her.

4412
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:32,060
I'm so sorry.

4413
03:37:38,020 --> 03:37:39,100
Not up here?

4414
03:37:39,320 --> 03:37:39,600
No?

4415
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:42,160
No?

4416
03:37:50,320 --> 03:37:50,900
She probably was hungry.

4417
03:37:54,300 --> 03:37:55,600
Oh, it's maybe these guys.

4418
03:37:56,260 --> 03:37:57,820
I think this...

4419
03:37:58,520 --> 03:37:59,560
Oh, I see him.

4420
03:37:59,620 --> 03:38:00,000
I see him.

4421
03:38:00,040 --> 03:38:00,440
Never mind.

4422
03:38:01,840 --> 03:38:03,260
Sorry, I'm a little blind.

4423
03:38:05,980 --> 03:38:07,240
Oh, that was close.

4424
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:12,320
Nice.

4425
03:38:12,320 --> 03:38:12,720
Okay.

4426
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:13,820
That's one.

4427
03:38:15,240 --> 03:38:15,900
Oh, okay.

4428
03:38:24,020 --> 03:38:26,000
I was thinking too hard about it.

4429
03:38:26,060 --> 03:38:27,160
I was like, I know I hear someone!

4430
03:38:29,280 --> 03:38:31,440
I think I need them to come back closer.

4431
03:38:31,980 --> 03:38:33,800
I know, I was too busy gaming.

4432
03:38:34,020 --> 03:38:34,900
I feel so bad.

4433
03:38:35,040 --> 03:38:36,000
I said blind.

4434
03:38:36,420 --> 03:38:37,120
I'm blind.

4435
03:38:53,810 --> 03:38:54,230
Yippee!

4436
03:38:54,230 --> 03:38:55,030
Bot rescued.

4437
03:38:55,210 --> 03:38:55,770
Okay, we got him.

4438
03:38:55,770 --> 03:38:57,230
Desert Wonderbird!

4439
03:38:57,350 --> 03:38:58,350
Great at making friends.

4440
03:38:59,590 --> 03:39:00,170
Yeah!

4441
03:39:01,470 --> 03:39:02,410
Oh my gosh.

4442
03:39:02,750 --> 03:39:04,410
Oh, I thought I was about to die.

4443
03:39:04,530 --> 03:39:05,770
I thought there was like a little...

4444
03:39:13,750 --> 03:39:14,490
There we go.

4445
03:39:15,400 --> 03:39:18,590
Oh my gosh.

4446
03:39:18,710 --> 03:39:19,490
Journey guy.

4447
03:39:20,370 --> 03:39:21,510
John Journey.

4448
03:39:23,190 --> 03:39:24,530
I'm Wilheimer Schmidt.

4449
03:39:24,810 --> 03:39:27,390
His name is my name too.

4450
03:39:44,550 --> 03:39:45,130
Scary.

4451
03:39:45,530 --> 03:39:45,550
Ah!

4452
03:39:45,710 --> 03:39:46,130
Ah!

4453
03:39:46,550 --> 03:39:47,070
Oh!

4454
03:39:48,250 --> 03:39:48,830
Kamin!

4455
03:40:08,690 --> 03:40:10,350
To be fair, I was gaming.

4456
03:40:10,650 --> 03:40:11,350
To be fair!

4457
03:40:12,090 --> 03:40:13,070
To be fair!

4458
03:40:21,870 --> 03:40:23,430
Just let him die down there.

4459
03:40:30,280 --> 03:40:31,620
The gold mechanics.

4460
03:40:32,260 --> 03:40:34,320
Even I see all this.

4461
03:40:34,460 --> 03:40:35,060
Oh, shoot.

4462
03:40:35,440 --> 03:40:37,480
I see this and I'm like, whoa.

4463
03:40:37,740 --> 03:40:41,400
I've been ranting and raving about how beautiful this game is.

4464
03:40:42,440 --> 03:40:43,260
I have.

4465
03:40:43,380 --> 03:40:43,780
I have.

4466
03:40:45,260 --> 03:40:47,660
I'm not taking the graphics for granted.

4467
03:40:48,580 --> 03:40:49,460
I'm not taking the graphics for granted.

4468
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:50,100
I think it's really nice.

4469
03:40:59,940 --> 03:41:01,460
I think it's so, so nice.

4470
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:04,340
I think it's so, so nice.

4471
03:41:04,340 --> 03:41:04,360
I think it's so, so nice.

4472
03:41:05,200 --> 03:41:07,620
Like I've just been like, whoa, I can push them all in there.

4473
03:41:07,820 --> 03:41:08,040
Like I've just been like, whoa, I can push them all in there.

4474
03:41:10,620 --> 03:41:12,000
Such a good looking game.

4475
03:41:12,100 --> 03:41:12,680
It really is.

4476
03:41:15,220 --> 03:41:15,820
Let's see.

4477
03:41:15,940 --> 03:41:17,160
Okay, we got two guys left.

4478
03:41:24,620 --> 03:41:25,820
I can't believe I didn't.

4479
03:41:25,880 --> 03:41:28,300
I had to play like a...

4480
03:41:29,600 --> 03:41:31,820
I had to play like a...

4481
03:41:33,320 --> 03:41:34,980
I couldn't defeat the enemy.

4482
03:41:36,440 --> 03:41:37,200
I couldn't defeat the enemy.

4483
03:41:37,200 --> 03:41:37,840
I had to just leave.

4484
03:41:39,240 --> 03:41:39,920
I had to just leave.

4485
03:41:40,900 --> 03:41:42,400
I couldn't defeat him.

4486
03:41:42,520 --> 03:41:43,180
I just left.

4487
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:45,140
I'm not a gamer.

4488
03:41:46,280 --> 03:41:47,400
I'm a loser.

4489
03:41:48,320 --> 03:41:48,860
Oh.

4490
03:41:50,040 --> 03:41:51,040
Wait, what?

4491
03:41:51,740 --> 03:41:52,960
Where did he come from?

4492
03:41:53,480 --> 03:41:54,220
Wait, what?

4493
03:41:54,640 --> 03:41:55,440
Where did...

4494
03:41:58,040 --> 03:41:59,880
I was trying to go up here.

4495
03:42:01,500 --> 03:42:02,020
What?

4496
03:42:02,560 --> 03:42:03,080
Huh?

4497
03:42:05,880 --> 03:42:06,400
What?

4498
03:42:06,980 --> 03:42:08,060
How did I do that?

4499
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:09,260
I'm gaming?

4500
03:42:10,500 --> 03:42:11,700
I think I'm...

4501
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:12,700
Maybe you guys...

4502
03:42:12,700 --> 03:42:15,960
Maybe I'm way more a gamer than I expected to be.

4503
03:42:25,280 --> 03:42:27,440
Oh my god, everybody say KFP.

4504
03:42:28,020 --> 03:42:30,980
Oh my god, everybody say KFP.

4505
03:42:30,980 --> 03:42:31,420
So cute.

4506
03:42:31,660 --> 03:42:31,900
So cute.

4507
03:42:37,970 --> 03:42:38,530
Yay!

4508
03:42:40,170 --> 03:42:41,150
Anything up here?

4509
03:42:42,190 --> 03:42:43,410
Don't touch the purple.

4510
03:42:44,170 --> 03:42:45,110
Anything up here?

4511
03:42:46,010 --> 03:42:46,790
Nope, okay.

4512
03:42:47,190 --> 03:42:49,070
The purple looks really delicious though.

4513
03:42:49,110 --> 03:42:50,910
It looks like a taro ice cream, right?

4514
03:42:52,430 --> 03:42:52,990
Mmm...

4515
03:42:54,670 --> 03:42:55,230
Mmm...

4516
03:43:26,780 --> 03:43:27,900
So rude!

4517
03:43:30,160 --> 03:43:31,260
Oh, I got the...

4518
03:43:31,260 --> 03:43:32,020
What's it called already?

4519
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:32,320
Okay.

4520
03:43:36,420 --> 03:43:37,260
Oh my gosh.

4521
03:43:38,320 --> 03:43:39,040
Thank you.

4522
03:43:40,200 --> 03:43:42,960
Is it true that they think Americans eat KFC for...

4523
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:44,300
As a Christmas feast?

4524
03:43:44,480 --> 03:43:45,360
I think that was like...

4525
03:43:45,980 --> 03:43:46,880
What they...

4526
03:43:46,880 --> 03:43:48,380
How they advertised it before.

4527
03:43:50,280 --> 03:43:52,310
To get people to eat KFC.

4528
03:43:53,160 --> 03:43:54,060
They were like, Yeah!

4529
03:43:54,220 --> 03:43:55,520
Americans eat it for Christmas!

4530
03:43:58,380 --> 03:43:58,840
He

4531
03:44:05,010 --> 03:44:06,430
just literally grazed him!

4532
03:44:06,830 --> 03:44:08,270
Are you kidding me right now?

4533
03:44:08,490 --> 03:44:09,530
Okay, I give up on that.

4534
03:44:09,750 --> 03:44:11,250
It doesn't even give me more money.

4535
03:44:40,200 --> 03:44:41,460
Maybe after a walk...

4536
03:44:41,460 --> 03:44:41,580
Maybe after a walk...

4537
03:44:41,580 --> 03:44:41,960
Maybe after a walk...

4538
03:44:43,780 --> 03:44:44,200
Maybe...

4539
03:44:44,780 --> 03:44:45,200
Ah!

4540
03:44:45,400 --> 03:44:46,340
It does give me more money!

4541
03:44:48,060 --> 03:44:48,620
Can you

4542
03:45:10,910 --> 03:45:11,370
grab it?

4543
03:45:11,470 --> 03:45:12,690
Wait, it's in the water!

4544
03:45:12,790 --> 03:45:15,730
I was gonna say it's in the death water!

4545
03:45:16,550 --> 03:45:17,950
Why is it giving me?

4546
03:45:19,110 --> 03:45:20,890
Why is it giving me?

4547
03:45:27,100 --> 03:45:29,060
When I was young, my parents used to...

4548
03:45:29,880 --> 03:45:31,640
You just have to celebrate my birthday.

4549
03:45:31,700 --> 03:45:32,180
What, KFC?

4550
03:45:32,220 --> 03:45:33,060
Oh, KFC?

4551
03:45:35,220 --> 03:45:37,700
I can probably count the number of times...

4552
03:45:37,700 --> 03:45:38,220
I've had KFC...

4553
03:45:39,920 --> 03:45:41,280
On one finger.

4554
03:45:47,710 --> 03:45:49,090
We made it!

4555
03:45:51,570 --> 03:45:52,750
Oh, what is this?

4556
03:45:57,730 --> 03:45:59,250
I think we did it!

4557
03:46:03,950 --> 03:46:05,070
I missed a man.

4558
03:46:06,350 --> 03:46:07,150
No way.

4559
03:46:08,510 --> 03:46:09,870
Wait, I said one finger.

4560
03:46:09,910 --> 03:46:10,490
I meant one hand.

4561
03:46:10,510 --> 03:46:11,070
Hahaha.

4562
03:46:21,250 --> 03:46:22,790
The guy you missed is way back.

4563
03:46:22,890 --> 03:46:23,830
How is that even possible?

4564
03:46:24,050 --> 03:46:24,870
He's the last guy.

4565
03:46:25,410 --> 03:46:26,810
What do you mean, way back?

4566
03:46:26,990 --> 03:46:28,570
He's the literal last guy.

4567
03:46:34,470 --> 03:46:34,950
Oh...

4568
03:46:46,880 --> 03:46:48,080
Who the hell?

4569
03:46:49,680 --> 03:46:50,160
Gato!

4570
03:46:50,340 --> 03:46:51,100
You liar!

4571
03:46:51,280 --> 03:46:52,580
You trying to one guy me?

4572
03:46:53,300 --> 03:46:53,780
Huh?

4573
03:46:54,720 --> 03:46:56,340
You trying to one guy me?

4574
03:46:57,560 --> 03:46:59,080
You little bastard, huh?

4575
03:46:59,880 --> 03:47:01,520
They're way back.

4576
03:47:01,640 --> 03:47:03,320
You'll never get them.

4577
03:47:03,840 --> 03:47:05,000
Oh, yeah.

4578
03:47:05,080 --> 03:47:06,600
You totally missed your chance.

4579
03:47:08,040 --> 03:47:09,840
You're never gonna get that guy.

4580
03:47:10,140 --> 03:47:11,100
He's way too far.

4581
03:47:11,480 --> 03:47:12,300
What the hell?

4582
03:47:20,550 --> 03:47:21,110
Bang!

4583
03:47:21,450 --> 03:47:24,210
I swear

4584
03:47:32,880 --> 03:47:34,840
there was a guy on top of a bottle that you didn't grab.

4585
03:47:35,100 --> 03:47:35,260
I swear there was a guy on top of a bottle that you didn't grab.

4586
03:47:39,380 --> 03:47:42,160
I will try for the puzzle piece though.

4587
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:44,080
Hold on.

4588
03:47:44,080 --> 03:47:46,060
Since it's right at the very beginning.

4589
03:47:46,120 --> 03:47:47,360
Let's keep trying for the puzzle piece.

4590
03:47:51,280 --> 03:47:51,760
Okay.

4591
03:47:52,220 --> 03:47:52,700
Okay.

4592
03:47:52,740 --> 03:47:53,820
And we can get more coins.

4593
03:47:54,880 --> 03:47:58,260
Coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins.

4594
03:47:58,560 --> 03:47:59,900
Coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins.

4595
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:01,000
Wait.

4596
03:48:02,580 --> 03:48:03,680
I don't think I got it.

4597
03:48:06,500 --> 03:48:08,220
Coins, coins, coins, coins.

4598
03:48:08,940 --> 03:48:09,880
You passed 150.

4599
03:48:10,160 --> 03:48:10,400
Ah!

4600
03:48:10,440 --> 03:48:10,800
Let's go!

4601
03:48:13,980 --> 03:48:14,660
Boost!

4602
03:48:14,940 --> 03:48:15,160
Boost!

4603
03:48:15,260 --> 03:48:15,600
Boost!

4604
03:48:15,620 --> 03:48:15,920
Boost!

4605
03:48:15,940 --> 03:48:16,240
Boost!

4606
03:48:16,380 --> 03:48:16,680
Boost!

4607
03:48:16,680 --> 03:48:17,300
Boost!

4608
03:48:17,300 --> 03:48:17,460
Boost!

4609
03:48:18,380 --> 03:48:19,060
Oh!

4610
03:48:19,400 --> 03:48:20,020
Oh!

4611
03:48:20,080 --> 03:48:21,560
I got it!

4612
03:48:26,040 --> 03:48:27,080
First try.

4613
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:34,080
First try, baby!

4614
03:48:35,800 --> 03:48:37,980
Alright, before we do the boss level.

4615
03:48:40,800 --> 03:48:42,220
Let's go home and do some gacha.

4616
03:48:45,420 --> 03:48:46,480
Let's do some gacha.

4617
03:48:46,860 --> 03:48:49,560
This would be like a spiritual successor to Little Big Planet.

4618
03:48:49,660 --> 03:48:51,180
I remember that was a big marketing game.

4619
03:48:51,520 --> 03:48:51,960
Maybe!

4620
03:48:52,680 --> 03:48:53,120
No!

4621
03:48:53,280 --> 03:48:55,440
I haven't encountered a single Little Big Man.

4622
03:49:00,200 --> 03:49:00,640
Yippee!

4623
03:49:02,180 --> 03:49:03,440
150 out of 300!

4624
03:49:06,520 --> 03:49:06,960
Whoa!

4625
03:49:07,180 --> 03:49:08,400
We got way more than I expected.

4626
03:49:10,800 --> 03:49:13,560
Is that the bathtub that everyone is telling me to go to?

4627
03:49:13,780 --> 03:49:13,820
Is that the bathtub that everyone is telling me to go to?

4628
03:49:13,820 --> 03:49:14,520
I don't even have it open.

4629
03:49:15,680 --> 03:49:17,200
I don't even have it open.

4630
03:49:21,040 --> 03:49:22,580
Jake, welcome to membership.

4631
03:49:22,740 --> 03:49:23,220
Jake, welcome to membership.

4632
03:49:23,960 --> 03:49:24,440
Gotcha.

4633
03:49:30,280 --> 03:49:31,240
Give me outfits.

4634
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:32,560
No soda.

4635
03:49:34,000 --> 03:49:34,880
Resting place.

4636
03:49:35,260 --> 03:49:38,860
I give you concrete.

4637
03:49:39,300 --> 03:49:39,380
I give you concrete.

4638
03:49:39,380 --> 03:49:39,780
Thank you.

4639
03:49:40,320 --> 03:49:41,000
Thank you.

4640
03:49:43,820 --> 03:49:44,340
Cute!

4641
03:49:46,740 --> 03:49:50,280
What sucks about getting more guys is that it means...

4642
03:49:50,280 --> 03:49:50,720
Oh my goodness.

4643
03:49:51,020 --> 03:49:53,260
It means that there's more items inside.

4644
03:49:55,000 --> 03:49:55,520
Oh!

4645
03:49:55,600 --> 03:49:56,140
A paint!

4646
03:49:56,820 --> 03:49:57,820
Snow glow.

4647
03:49:58,200 --> 03:49:58,780
Oh, it's cute!

4648
03:49:58,980 --> 03:49:59,500
Oh my gosh!

4649
03:49:59,500 --> 03:50:00,480
It's so pretty!

4650
03:50:05,170 --> 03:50:05,690
Hi!

4651
03:50:05,710 --> 03:50:06,030
Happy!

4652
03:50:08,370 --> 03:50:08,890
Happy!

4653
03:50:08,890 --> 03:50:09,970
Energy store.

4654
03:50:10,510 --> 03:50:11,530
This is coal, right?

4655
03:50:11,610 --> 03:50:12,010
You guys said?

4656
03:50:12,630 --> 03:50:13,310
This is coal, right?

4657
03:50:13,310 --> 03:50:13,310
You guys said?

4658
03:50:14,430 --> 03:50:15,190
It's so pretty.

4659
03:50:18,370 --> 03:50:21,070
Oh, this is a siren, isn't it?

4660
03:50:21,550 --> 03:50:21,790
Oh!

4661
03:50:22,330 --> 03:50:26,670
This is a siren, isn't it?

4662
03:50:26,670 --> 03:50:26,670
Oh!

4663
03:50:26,670 --> 03:50:26,710
This is a siren, isn't it?

4664
03:50:26,710 --> 03:50:27,930
I have not finished siren.

4665
03:50:28,210 --> 03:50:28,330
I have not finished siren.

4666
03:50:29,490 --> 03:50:29,990
So...

4667
03:50:31,310 --> 03:50:32,630
One day I'd like to.

4668
03:50:33,070 --> 03:50:33,830
Oh my god.

4669
03:50:35,690 --> 03:50:36,190
Scammed.

4670
03:50:38,030 --> 03:50:38,530
Scammed!

4671
03:50:39,590 --> 03:50:40,430
Luminous sign!

4672
03:50:40,790 --> 03:50:41,550
Oh, it's so pretty!

4673
03:50:42,730 --> 03:50:43,230
Hmm.

4674
03:50:45,270 --> 03:50:45,830
Oh!

4675
03:50:47,910 --> 03:50:48,750
An outfit.

4676
03:50:48,930 --> 03:50:49,870
An outfit, you guys.

4677
03:50:49,930 --> 03:50:50,230
An outfit.

4678
03:50:50,350 --> 03:50:50,610
An outfit.

4679
03:50:50,790 --> 03:50:51,350
Okay.

4680
03:50:54,150 --> 03:50:54,710
Oh!

4681
03:50:54,730 --> 03:50:55,250
Oh!

4682
03:50:55,710 --> 03:50:56,270
I'm...

4683
03:50:56,990 --> 03:50:58,430
Mr. Bloodborne?

4684
03:51:02,270 --> 03:51:02,830
Happy!

4685
03:51:04,250 --> 03:51:05,030
Boy's bow.

4686
03:51:08,670 --> 03:51:09,230
Color?

4687
03:51:09,590 --> 03:51:10,070
Whoa!

4688
03:51:10,850 --> 03:51:11,810
Glorious graffiti.

4689
03:51:12,030 --> 03:51:12,770
A snake on there?

4690
03:51:19,490 --> 03:51:21,010
Fuji-san is on there.

4691
03:51:21,130 --> 03:51:21,170
Fuji-san is on there.

4692
03:51:21,530 --> 03:51:23,630
But no snake is useless to me.

4693
03:51:26,050 --> 03:51:26,690
Whoa!

4694
03:51:27,630 --> 03:51:28,910
Worth its weight.

4695
03:51:28,990 --> 03:51:30,050
That is gold!

4696
03:51:32,730 --> 03:51:33,370
Happy!

4697
03:51:33,690 --> 03:51:34,270
Happy!

4698
03:51:35,950 --> 03:51:36,590
Oh!

4699
03:51:37,110 --> 03:51:38,570
This is the puppeteer thing.

4700
03:51:39,730 --> 03:51:43,860
Oh, we got the tortoise!

4701
03:51:44,640 --> 03:51:46,420
Oh, we got the tortoise!

4702
03:51:46,420 --> 03:51:46,860
Very cute.

4703
03:51:48,180 --> 03:51:49,360
Okay, one more.

4704
03:51:53,320 --> 03:51:54,240
So I want...

4705
03:51:54,240 --> 03:51:56,120
Oh my god, look how many outfits are in there now!

4706
03:51:56,740 --> 03:51:57,300
Please!

4707
03:51:57,480 --> 03:51:58,740
Let me have more outfits!

4708
03:51:59,740 --> 03:52:00,300
Please!

4709
03:52:04,280 --> 03:52:05,780
I want more outfits.

4710
03:52:07,840 --> 03:52:09,980
Let me check my Discord because...

4711
03:52:09,980 --> 03:52:11,440
there might be people...

4712
03:52:11,440 --> 03:52:13,400
trying to contact me...

4713
03:52:13,400 --> 03:52:15,800
for my sound check.

4714
03:52:26,630 --> 03:52:27,090
Oh!

4715
03:52:27,090 --> 03:52:27,290
Oh!

4716
03:52:32,010 --> 03:52:32,810
I'm so bad.

4717
03:52:33,810 --> 03:52:34,650
I'm bad at game.

4718
03:52:36,190 --> 03:52:37,070
I'm bad at game.

4719
03:52:47,390 --> 03:52:48,270
Okie dokie.

4720
03:52:48,390 --> 03:52:49,030
Let's keep going!

4721
03:52:49,230 --> 03:52:50,790
We have the one boss world.

4722
03:52:56,680 --> 03:52:57,200
Let's go!

4723
03:52:59,180 --> 03:52:59,580
Oh!

4724
03:52:59,700 --> 03:53:01,400
I should have changed into Mr. Bloodborne!

4725
03:53:03,040 --> 03:53:03,620
Oh well.

4726
03:53:05,360 --> 03:53:05,760
Oh!

4727
03:53:05,780 --> 03:53:06,100
Oh!

4728
03:53:06,100 --> 03:53:06,640
Good, good, good.

4729
03:53:06,780 --> 03:53:07,180
Oh!

4730
03:53:08,580 --> 03:53:09,440
Should have changed.

4731
03:53:12,180 --> 03:53:13,220
Also hidden world.

4732
03:53:13,380 --> 03:53:14,820
Yeah, but I don't think I'll be able to get...

4733
03:53:14,820 --> 03:53:15,420
them today.

4734
03:53:16,640 --> 03:53:17,360
That's okay though.

4735
03:53:22,160 --> 03:53:24,840
We'll see how fast this level takes me and then...

4736
03:53:24,840 --> 03:53:25,360
Oh wait!

4737
03:53:27,160 --> 03:53:28,180
Yeah, like these are...

4738
03:53:28,180 --> 03:53:28,200
Oh!

4739
03:53:28,320 --> 03:53:29,440
See, like here is hidden.

4740
03:53:29,620 --> 03:53:30,020
Right?

4741
03:53:33,240 --> 03:53:33,760
Oh!

4742
03:53:35,980 --> 03:53:36,500
Wow!

4743
03:53:39,400 --> 03:53:39,920
Oh!

4744
03:53:40,280 --> 03:53:40,800
Wow!

4745
03:53:40,800 --> 03:53:41,860
Lost circle void.

4746
03:53:43,700 --> 03:53:44,420
I'll try!

4747
03:53:44,580 --> 03:53:46,780
Let me see how long the boss takes me and then...

4748
03:53:46,780 --> 03:53:48,920
We'll see if we can do circle world.

4749
03:53:49,880 --> 03:53:50,400
Oh!

4750
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:51,080
Oh!

4751
03:53:51,340 --> 03:53:51,720
Oh!

4752
03:53:51,780 --> 03:53:51,900
Oh gosh!

4753
03:53:52,140 --> 03:53:52,580
Oh gosh!

4754
03:53:52,800 --> 03:53:53,280
Oh!

4755
03:53:53,280 --> 03:53:53,780
Oh!

4756
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:54,360
Oh!

4757
03:53:54,360 --> 03:53:54,680
Oh!

4758
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:58,200
I did it!

4759
03:54:02,120 --> 03:54:03,260
More world.

4760
03:54:03,880 --> 03:54:04,520
Rolling...

4761
03:54:05,220 --> 03:54:06,820
Rolling Star Luna!

4762
03:54:08,500 --> 03:54:09,520
Anything else?

4763
03:54:11,280 --> 03:54:11,920
Hmm...

4764
03:54:12,840 --> 03:54:14,220
Since I unlocked it...

4765
03:54:14,220 --> 03:54:15,420
I won't have to unlock it again, right?

4766
03:54:17,200 --> 03:54:17,840
Okay.

4767
03:54:18,020 --> 03:54:18,740
Let's try.

4768
03:54:18,940 --> 03:54:19,940
Boss world!

4769
03:54:22,080 --> 03:54:22,720
Oh!

4770
03:54:25,820 --> 03:54:26,340
Oh!

4771
03:54:26,460 --> 03:54:26,940
Oh!

4772
03:54:26,940 --> 03:54:27,200
Oh!

4773
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:32,120
Crash landing!

4774
03:54:32,240 --> 03:54:33,500
Crash landing!

4775
03:54:38,060 --> 03:54:41,120
This is like the first world we've had that has like spooky music.

4776
03:54:45,200 --> 03:54:47,060
I missed the world moving as an asteroid.

4777
03:54:47,180 --> 03:54:47,620
Yeah, I know.

4778
03:54:47,740 --> 03:54:49,100
And that's okay because...

4779
03:54:49,760 --> 03:54:50,760
It will come back.

4780
03:54:55,940 --> 03:54:56,420
Cool.

4781
03:54:59,640 --> 03:55:00,880
So it's no biggie.

4782
03:55:03,620 --> 03:55:04,520
Let's see... Oh!

4783
03:55:04,660 --> 03:55:05,060
Chicken!

4784
03:55:05,060 --> 03:55:05,480
Chicken!

4785
03:55:07,520 --> 03:55:08,140
Did I...

4786
03:55:08,140 --> 03:55:09,580
Did it lay an egg?

4787
03:55:09,780 --> 03:55:11,360
Wait, does my chicken lay eggs?

4788
03:55:15,320 --> 03:55:17,080
I know how to use chicken.

4789
03:55:22,130 --> 03:55:22,730
Oh, shoot.

4790
03:55:34,390 --> 03:55:35,630
Let me double check.

4791
03:55:35,770 --> 03:55:36,110
What's here?

4792
03:55:36,250 --> 03:55:36,970
Oh, just the one guy.

4793
03:55:37,130 --> 03:55:37,530
Okay, cool.

4794
03:55:38,310 --> 03:55:39,310
That makes things easy.

4795
03:55:44,160 --> 03:55:45,280
They usually do...

4796
03:55:45,280 --> 03:55:46,540
Yeah, but I didn't notice before!

4797
03:55:47,700 --> 03:55:49,040
He lays a little egg.

4798
03:55:49,220 --> 03:55:50,060
It's kind of cute.

4799
03:55:56,860 --> 03:55:57,340
Oh!

4800
03:55:58,180 --> 03:55:58,660
Oh!

4801
03:55:59,620 --> 03:56:00,100
Oh!

4802
03:56:00,100 --> 03:56:00,420
Ah!

4803
03:56:04,260 --> 03:56:05,040
Oh my god!

4804
03:56:05,080 --> 03:56:07,760
All my coins!

4805
03:56:09,560 --> 03:56:10,520
You jerk!

4806
03:56:10,640 --> 03:56:12,540
You made me miss all my coins!

4807
03:56:12,840 --> 03:56:13,100
No!

4808
03:56:17,240 --> 03:56:17,720
Okay.

4809
03:56:17,720 --> 03:56:17,900
Okay.

4810
03:56:20,820 --> 03:56:22,840
Oh no, it's a snake lady.

4811
03:56:25,060 --> 03:56:28,240
Lady Venomara, please have mercy on me!

4812
03:56:29,480 --> 03:56:30,040
Lady Venomara, please have mercy on me!

4813
03:56:30,040 --> 03:56:30,060
Lady Venomara, please have mercy on me!

4814
03:56:30,060 --> 03:56:36,900
Oh my god, I'm over!

4815
03:56:37,460 --> 03:56:38,780
Wait, she's got about...

4816
03:56:38,780 --> 03:56:41,100
Oh my god, stop.

4817
03:56:41,440 --> 03:56:42,340
Don't be like that.

4818
03:56:42,840 --> 03:56:44,800
I can't die on the first part.

4819
03:56:45,440 --> 03:56:46,480
Start it!

4820
03:56:46,780 --> 03:56:47,300
Oh!

4821
03:56:49,580 --> 03:56:50,100
Okay.

4822
03:56:50,440 --> 03:56:52,580
We're learning her patterns, you guys.

4823
03:56:52,680 --> 03:56:54,820
We're learning her patterns.

4824
03:56:56,240 --> 03:56:56,760
Okay.

4825
03:57:01,270 --> 03:57:01,790
Oh!

4826
03:57:01,950 --> 03:57:03,890
I needed to jump on top of them!

4827
03:57:04,190 --> 03:57:04,610
Okay.

4828
03:57:06,090 --> 03:57:06,610
Okay.

4829
03:57:07,190 --> 03:57:08,410
We understand now.

4830
03:57:08,590 --> 03:57:09,590
You can destroy the green knight?

4831
03:57:09,710 --> 03:57:10,750
Okay, I think yeah, I'll try.

4832
03:57:13,630 --> 03:57:16,250
I was so distracted by her chomping.

4833
03:57:16,250 --> 03:57:16,930
You know?

4834
03:57:27,470 --> 03:57:28,290
There we go.

4835
03:57:31,230 --> 03:57:32,470
Sow, nay!

4836
03:57:32,790 --> 03:57:34,850
I wasn't fast enough.

4837
03:57:35,050 --> 03:57:35,210
Okay.

4838
03:57:36,830 --> 03:57:37,450
Uh...

4839
03:57:46,460 --> 03:57:48,880
Am I supposed to...?

4840
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:52,160
Wait, oh...

4841
03:57:53,040 --> 03:57:53,660
I

4842
03:57:58,000 --> 03:57:59,680
need to destroy her...

4843
03:57:59,680 --> 03:58:01,440
the things on her tails, right?

4844
03:58:02,620 --> 03:58:03,500
Oh wait!

4845
03:58:03,620 --> 03:58:03,800
Oh!

4846
03:58:04,480 --> 03:58:05,660
I got one!

4847
03:58:10,620 --> 03:58:11,360
Oh, I got two!

4848
03:58:11,840 --> 03:58:12,280
Nice.

4849
03:58:20,700 --> 03:58:21,540
Oh, come on.

4850
03:58:21,940 --> 03:58:23,800
Oh, they give you so many shots too.

4851
03:58:24,180 --> 03:58:25,360
And I just messed up.

4852
03:58:28,820 --> 03:58:29,420
It's me!

4853
03:58:29,640 --> 03:58:30,320
I messed up!

4854
03:58:47,870 --> 03:58:49,210
What just happened there?

4855
03:58:49,350 --> 03:58:49,990
Oh my goodness.

4856
03:58:52,430 --> 03:58:54,730
Oh, she's shaving off the field.

4857
03:59:00,210 --> 03:59:01,710
Oh, I kind of love her though.

4858
03:59:02,030 --> 03:59:02,830
Who's her seiyuu?

4859
03:59:03,350 --> 03:59:04,190
She's so awesome.

4860
03:59:06,130 --> 03:59:06,530
I

4861
03:59:14,910 --> 03:59:15,310
died.

4862
03:59:15,350 --> 03:59:15,850
I died.

4863
03:59:15,970 --> 03:59:16,190
I died.

4864
03:59:29,290 --> 03:59:30,270
Oh my gosh.

4865
03:59:30,390 --> 03:59:30,830
Oh my gosh.

4866
03:59:34,970 --> 03:59:35,670
Ah, shoot!

4867
03:59:37,630 --> 03:59:38,030
I

4868
03:59:49,670 --> 03:59:50,650
keep missing the first one.

4869
03:59:53,990 --> 03:59:55,010
Oh, I got it!

4870
03:59:55,030 --> 03:59:55,130
I got it!

4871
03:59:55,150 --> 03:59:55,670
Nice.

4872
03:59:55,870 --> 03:59:55,970
Nice.

4873
03:59:56,070 --> 03:59:56,150
Nice.

4874
03:59:56,150 --> 03:59:56,330
Okay.

4875
04:00:00,910 --> 04:00:03,310
There's only so many places you can put these damn anxiety!

4876
04:00:08,080 --> 04:00:08,620
Oh my god.

4877
04:00:08,660 --> 04:00:08,840
Oh my god.

4878
04:00:08,920 --> 04:00:09,120
Oh my god.

4879
04:00:09,680 --> 04:00:12,820
Oh my

4880
04:00:16,500 --> 04:00:16,660
god.

4881
04:00:16,660 --> 04:00:16,660
Oh my god.

4882
04:00:16,760 --> 04:00:17,320
That was so close.

4883
04:00:17,940 --> 04:00:19,180
That was so close!

4884
04:00:19,640 --> 04:00:20,260
Oh my gosh.

4885
04:00:20,300 --> 04:00:21,160
Please don't let me fall.

4886
04:00:22,460 --> 04:00:22,820
Almost?

4887
04:00:32,020 --> 04:00:32,880
Oh my god.

4888
04:00:38,740 --> 04:00:39,860
Oh shoot!

4889
04:00:40,280 --> 04:00:41,000
No!

4890
04:00:47,320 --> 04:00:48,040
No!

4891
04:00:57,570 --> 04:00:59,010
Shut up!

4892
04:01:00,550 --> 04:01:01,470
You can punch.

4893
04:01:01,470 --> 04:01:02,730
Yeah, I'm gonna punch instead.

4894
04:01:03,210 --> 04:01:03,930
Okay.

4895
04:01:09,330 --> 04:01:12,590
I know much better the patterns though.

4896
04:01:12,730 --> 04:01:14,210
So, it's good.

4897
04:01:14,210 --> 04:01:14,530
It's a good game.

4898
04:01:16,170 --> 04:01:17,050
B-boo pooh-pooh!

4899
04:01:18,610 --> 04:01:19,210
Oh my god.

4900
04:01:20,030 --> 04:01:20,470
Like

4901
04:01:26,350 --> 04:01:29,590
I got pretty far with just like a one life going on, so.

4902
04:01:30,730 --> 04:01:31,730
I raised it up.

4903
04:01:34,640 --> 04:01:35,860
Wasn't so bad, I suppose.

4904
04:01:38,800 --> 04:01:39,960
Oh, yo-yo-yo-y.

4905
04:01:56,170 --> 04:01:56,610
Concentrate.

4906
04:01:56,690 --> 04:01:58,010
I can't even talk, sorry guys.

4907
04:01:58,130 --> 04:01:59,510
I'm like concentrating so much.

4908
04:01:59,850 --> 04:02:00,870
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

4909
04:02:01,090 --> 04:02:01,530
Ah!

4910
04:02:11,020 --> 04:02:11,900
Locked in, I know.

4911
04:02:17,320 --> 04:02:18,780
Oh, just punch her blue stuff?

4912
04:02:19,120 --> 04:02:20,360
Oh, I thought you meant...

4913
04:02:24,720 --> 04:02:28,520
You meant the Eggies at the end!

4914
04:02:31,360 --> 04:02:32,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4915
04:02:32,500 --> 04:02:33,100
I get it, okay.

4916
04:02:34,260 --> 04:02:36,040
I thought you guys meant the Eggies before.

4917
04:02:36,540 --> 04:02:37,180
My bad.

4918
04:02:41,600 --> 04:02:42,120
Please, yes.

4919
04:02:46,160 --> 04:02:47,280
Oh, that was so close.

4920
04:03:01,980 --> 04:03:02,300
Sorry.

4921
04:03:03,200 --> 04:03:04,700
Okay, I'll try punching this time.

4922
04:03:05,480 --> 04:03:07,080
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch!

4923
04:03:07,320 --> 04:03:09,300
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch!

4924
04:03:13,500 --> 04:03:14,560
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch!

4925
04:03:14,720 --> 04:03:15,240
There we go.

4926
04:03:15,660 --> 04:03:16,400
I got her.

4927
04:03:25,340 --> 04:03:26,140
Oh, okay.

4928
04:03:26,860 --> 04:03:27,520
There we go.

4929
04:03:29,900 --> 04:03:32,500
And so here I can just punch my way through, right?

4930
04:03:32,980 --> 04:03:35,340
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch!

4931
04:03:35,340 --> 04:03:36,040
Oh, punch, punch, punch!

4932
04:03:36,200 --> 04:03:36,640
Oh, what?

4933
04:03:36,720 --> 04:03:37,380
Oh, never mind!

4934
04:03:37,520 --> 04:03:38,500
You cannot just punch!

4935
04:03:38,820 --> 04:03:39,600
You must...

4936
04:03:40,060 --> 04:03:40,460
Dodge!

4937
04:03:41,840 --> 04:03:43,100
You must dodge, I think!

4938
04:03:43,240 --> 04:03:44,320
Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge!

4939
04:03:44,780 --> 04:03:45,880
Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge!

4940
04:03:59,540 --> 04:03:59,940
Okay.

4941
04:04:00,440 --> 04:04:00,840
Woo!

4942
04:04:06,620 --> 04:04:07,020
Oh!

4943
04:04:07,020 --> 04:04:07,160
Oh!

4944
04:04:09,960 --> 04:04:11,120
She's so hot.

4945
04:04:13,800 --> 04:04:14,100
Punch!

4946
04:04:22,700 --> 04:04:23,300
Yes!

4947
04:04:23,300 --> 04:04:23,900
Why...

4948
04:04:23,900 --> 04:04:24,900
Who's that?

4949
04:04:25,000 --> 04:04:25,880
What did he do?

4950
04:04:27,480 --> 04:04:28,540
Oh, it's Uncharted.

4951
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:29,920
Close enough.

4952
04:04:35,550 --> 04:04:36,990
If evil, why hot?

4953
04:04:37,130 --> 04:04:37,630
So true.

4954
04:04:39,690 --> 04:04:40,370
Let's go!

4955
04:04:40,590 --> 04:04:41,070
Oh, sorry.

4956
04:04:42,050 --> 04:04:42,650
Yeah!

4957
04:04:49,000 --> 04:04:49,400
The boss!

4958
04:04:53,960 --> 04:04:55,760
Now we have the bossier boss.

4959
04:04:56,120 --> 04:04:59,240
And we have to beat the Uncharted world.

4960
04:05:01,260 --> 04:05:02,400
The bossier boss.

4961
04:05:02,780 --> 04:05:04,020
Dude raiding!

4962
04:05:05,800 --> 04:05:07,500
I kind of want to see this one, though.

4963
04:05:09,680 --> 04:05:12,280
I kind of want to see what the circle world is like.

4964
04:05:13,340 --> 04:05:15,300
Maybe I'll game just like before.

4965
04:05:15,720 --> 04:05:16,280
Oh.

4966
04:05:16,880 --> 04:05:17,440
Woo!

4967
04:05:19,000 --> 04:05:19,520
Thank you!

4968
04:05:21,320 --> 04:05:24,700
What does the circle world want for us?

4969
04:05:25,060 --> 04:05:25,700
Everybody.

4970
04:05:27,780 --> 04:05:29,640
It seems peaceful so far.

4971
04:05:29,860 --> 04:05:31,440
Seems quite nice, right?

4972
04:05:32,980 --> 04:05:36,080
So far, it's actually quite peaceful.

4973
04:05:37,180 --> 04:05:39,180
Oh, he looks like a SpaghettiO.

4974
04:05:45,280 --> 04:05:48,180
They really look like serial mascots, right?

4975
04:05:55,230 --> 04:05:56,590
Nanako Ishikawa.

4976
04:05:56,790 --> 04:05:57,970
Thank you for looking it up.

4977
04:05:59,150 --> 04:05:59,950
Okay.

4978
04:06:00,930 --> 04:06:02,270
Oh, boost!

4979
04:06:03,470 --> 04:06:04,270
Oh.

4980
04:06:04,590 --> 04:06:06,190
Rolling rampage.

4981
04:06:06,190 --> 04:06:06,730
Let's see.

4982
04:06:09,710 --> 04:06:10,510
SpaghettiO.

4983
04:06:10,510 --> 04:06:11,250
SpaghettiO.

4984
04:06:12,310 --> 04:06:13,110
SpaghettiO.

4985
04:06:13,110 --> 04:06:13,910
SpaghettiO.

4986
04:06:13,910 --> 04:06:14,390
Oh.

4987
04:06:19,570 --> 04:06:20,010
Oh.

4988
04:06:20,190 --> 04:06:20,270
Oh.

4989
04:06:29,580 --> 04:06:30,400
What a second.

4990
04:06:31,200 --> 04:06:31,680
What's that?

4991
04:06:33,700 --> 04:06:34,940
I thought I was right!

4992
04:06:35,100 --> 04:06:35,320
Right?

4993
04:06:39,090 --> 04:06:39,730
Oh my god.

4994
04:06:39,950 --> 04:06:44,940
Oh, I already have one.

4995
04:06:48,380 --> 04:06:49,100
Oh my god.

4996
04:06:49,200 --> 04:06:49,840
Oh, shoot!

4997
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:50,400
What do I do here?

4998
04:06:51,300 --> 04:06:52,080
I don't remember!

4999
04:06:54,380 --> 04:06:55,360
I don't remember!

5000
04:06:55,360 --> 04:06:57,140
Oh wait, what was I supposed to do with these guys?

5001
04:06:58,320 --> 04:06:59,660
My Oshijane's combat.

5002
04:06:59,880 --> 04:07:00,360
Oh, spin!

5003
04:07:00,540 --> 04:07:01,020
That's right!

5004
04:07:01,160 --> 04:07:01,480
Thank you.

5005
04:07:01,820 --> 04:07:02,680
I couldn't remember.

5006
04:07:13,660 --> 04:07:14,600
I'm too gaming.

5007
04:07:14,720 --> 04:07:15,400
I don't need to...

5008
04:07:22,720 --> 04:07:23,160
It's

5009
04:07:27,880 --> 04:07:28,260
a cord!

5010
04:07:28,680 --> 04:07:30,120
It's like a... it's like a...

5011
04:07:33,800 --> 04:07:36,220
It's like a... a controller cable.

5012
04:07:36,500 --> 04:07:36,980
It's so cute.

5013
04:07:42,330 --> 04:07:43,910
That's so cute.

5014
04:07:47,830 --> 04:07:48,710
Yeah!

5015
04:07:48,710 --> 04:07:49,870
PS1 cord.

5016
04:07:51,090 --> 04:07:52,330
Oh my god.

5017
04:07:52,490 --> 04:07:53,870
No, that's so unlucky.

5018
04:08:15,020 --> 04:08:16,380
Okay, alright.

5019
04:08:19,460 --> 04:08:20,340
Please!

5020
04:08:20,520 --> 04:08:21,000
No!

5021
04:08:33,180 --> 04:08:35,520
I don't have the timing down yet for it.

5022
04:08:47,800 --> 04:08:49,740
Maybe right as soon as... no...

5023
04:08:49,740 --> 04:08:50,680
No!

5024
04:08:51,200 --> 04:08:52,400
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

5025
04:08:55,700 --> 04:08:56,200
Okay.

5026
04:08:57,960 --> 04:08:59,160
Wait, this is bad.

5027
04:09:01,480 --> 04:09:02,560
Wait, this kind of sucks.

5028
04:09:03,320 --> 04:09:04,800
Wait, I can't see anything.

5029
04:09:05,800 --> 04:09:07,840
This is kind of... not so great.

5030
04:09:20,900 --> 04:09:22,360
No, they're so fast!

5031
04:09:22,480 --> 04:09:23,800
They're way faster than you!

5032
04:09:24,820 --> 04:09:25,300
Okay.

5033
04:09:26,320 --> 04:09:27,580
Okay, I understand.

5034
04:09:28,860 --> 04:09:29,740
I understand!

5035
04:09:30,120 --> 04:09:30,220
Oh!

5036
04:09:30,900 --> 04:09:33,460
I don't... I don't remember him being that bad.

5037
04:09:38,320 --> 04:09:38,800
Okay.

5038
04:09:39,580 --> 04:09:40,060
Wait!

5039
04:09:43,620 --> 04:09:44,100
Okay.

5040
04:09:54,500 --> 04:09:57,080
Oh, it sucks because it's all the way on the other side.

5041
04:09:57,660 --> 04:09:58,360
So you have to like...

5042
04:09:59,360 --> 04:09:59,840
Ah!

5043
04:10:00,500 --> 04:10:00,980
Okay.

5044
04:10:01,420 --> 04:10:01,860
Run!

5045
04:10:02,940 --> 04:10:03,200
Run!

5046
04:10:07,340 --> 04:10:07,780
Jump!

5047
04:10:08,260 --> 04:10:08,700
Ah!

5048
04:10:20,290 --> 04:10:20,730
Okay.

5049
04:10:21,330 --> 04:10:22,150
Good luck, boss!

5050
04:10:22,170 --> 04:10:22,550
Do a flip!

5051
04:10:22,630 --> 04:10:23,090
Thank you!

5052
04:10:23,390 --> 04:10:24,410
I want ace combat!

5053
04:10:24,850 --> 04:10:25,950
I want strong ace combat!

5054
04:10:35,630 --> 04:10:36,070
Please!

5055
04:10:58,790 --> 04:10:59,230
Okay.

5056
04:11:05,710 --> 04:11:06,150
Alright.

5057
04:11:06,330 --> 04:11:07,650
I think this one's not so bad, though.

5058
04:11:07,790 --> 04:11:08,450
I think.

5059
04:11:09,250 --> 04:11:10,930
I think this one's quite doable.

5060
04:11:16,310 --> 04:11:18,350
As if the other challenges aren't doable.

5061
04:11:36,320 --> 04:11:37,240
Oh shit.

5062
04:11:38,720 --> 04:11:39,360
No!

5063
04:11:45,770 --> 04:11:46,590
That's okay.

5064
04:11:47,650 --> 04:11:48,290
Holy...

5065
04:11:51,150 --> 04:11:51,790
I...

5066
04:11:51,790 --> 04:11:55,250
I was gonna say I am farming coins but not really.

5067
04:11:55,530 --> 04:11:56,990
I lose it every time.

5068
04:11:57,490 --> 04:12:00,450
I lose the coin every time which sucks.

5069
04:12:01,270 --> 04:12:01,910
Okay...

5070
04:12:07,090 --> 04:12:08,470
But up to here, I'm okay.

5071
04:12:09,050 --> 04:12:09,410
Usually.

5072
04:12:16,780 --> 04:12:17,140
Please!

5073
04:12:17,140 --> 04:12:17,500
Yes!

5074
04:12:17,780 --> 04:12:18,140
Okay.

5075
04:12:18,540 --> 04:12:18,900
Okay.

5076
04:12:19,340 --> 04:12:19,880
Save zone!

5077
04:12:20,020 --> 04:12:20,360
Save zone!

5078
04:12:20,400 --> 04:12:20,720
Save zone!

5079
04:12:23,300 --> 04:12:23,660
Okay.

5080
04:12:23,660 --> 04:12:24,440
Okay, okay, okay.

5081
04:12:25,160 --> 04:12:26,200
You don't lose your coins?

5082
04:12:26,260 --> 04:12:29,300
But I've been at like 170 for... I checked earlier!

5083
04:12:29,760 --> 04:12:30,300
I haven't...

5084
04:12:30,300 --> 04:12:30,460
Okay.

5085
04:12:30,540 --> 04:12:31,080
No, no, no.

5086
04:12:31,220 --> 04:12:33,400
I was at 170 at the beginning of this.

5087
04:12:33,480 --> 04:12:34,740
Every time I die, I lose it.

5088
04:12:35,920 --> 04:12:37,320
Every time I die, I lose it.

5089
04:12:37,360 --> 04:12:39,140
Because at the beginning of this, I was at 170.

5090
04:12:42,840 --> 04:12:44,900
I'm not saying like I'm losing coins.

5091
04:12:45,040 --> 04:12:47,040
I'm saying like I will lose that mana.

5092
04:12:47,620 --> 04:12:48,280
Okay.

5093
04:12:52,790 --> 04:12:53,450
Okay.

5094
04:12:53,550 --> 04:12:53,990
Alright.

5095
04:12:55,470 --> 04:12:56,130
Ah!

5096
04:13:10,040 --> 04:13:11,000
Aerial Ace!

5097
04:13:11,000 --> 04:13:12,920
A G-Force to be reckoned with!

5098
04:13:13,920 --> 04:13:14,420
Yes!

5099
04:13:17,420 --> 04:13:18,660
Charizard is coming!

5100
04:13:21,560 --> 04:13:22,860
Let's go, baby!

5101
04:13:24,440 --> 04:13:26,120
Let's go, baby!

5102
04:13:27,600 --> 04:13:28,480
Oh my god, brother!

5103
04:13:28,620 --> 04:13:28,880
Get up!

5104
04:13:29,160 --> 04:13:29,600
Brother!

5105
04:13:30,500 --> 04:13:30,940
Brother!

5106
04:13:32,400 --> 04:13:33,000
Oh, wait.

5107
04:13:33,140 --> 04:13:36,000
Where's... Oh, there it is.

5108
04:13:39,980 --> 04:13:40,420
Oh!

5109
04:13:40,500 --> 04:13:41,220
No, no, no!

5110
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:41,760
Come back!

5111
04:13:42,020 --> 04:13:42,640
Come back!

5112
04:13:43,040 --> 04:13:43,700
Come back!

5113
04:13:44,160 --> 04:13:44,820
Come back!

5114
04:13:45,040 --> 04:13:45,700
Come back!

5115
04:13:54,840 --> 04:13:58,000
There's so many levels in this game.

5116
04:13:58,140 --> 04:13:58,740
Holy cow!

5117
04:13:59,400 --> 04:14:00,560
Try the top circle?

5118
04:14:00,640 --> 04:14:00,800
Okay.

5119
04:14:01,280 --> 04:14:02,240
Give me a second.

5120
04:14:06,060 --> 04:14:06,700
What is this?

5121
04:14:08,240 --> 04:14:09,020
Oh, gosh.

5122
04:14:09,040 --> 04:14:09,760
It's this guy.

5123
04:14:12,220 --> 04:14:13,260
Holy cow!

5124
04:14:13,440 --> 04:14:14,140
Oh, no.

5125
04:14:16,400 --> 04:14:17,280
No way!

5126
04:14:26,270 --> 04:14:27,030
Oh my god.

5127
04:14:36,840 --> 04:14:37,880
My coins!

5128
04:14:38,700 --> 04:14:39,840
Oh, let's see.

5129
04:14:41,620 --> 04:14:42,660
Oh my god.

5130
04:14:42,760 --> 04:14:43,860
Oh my goodness.

5131
04:14:44,940 --> 04:14:45,460
Oh my goodness.

5132
04:14:47,280 --> 04:14:48,240
My coins!

5133
04:14:52,860 --> 04:14:53,880
Ah, shit!

5134
04:14:54,640 --> 04:14:55,280
No!

5135
04:14:56,660 --> 04:14:58,320
Your money or your life?

5136
04:14:58,740 --> 04:14:59,700
My money!

5137
04:15:07,310 --> 04:15:09,710
I don't know how I'm gonna get past those...

5138
04:15:12,890 --> 04:15:13,790
Oh my god.

5139
04:15:19,490 --> 04:15:21,190
Oh my god.

5140
04:15:27,540 --> 04:15:30,800
This one's hard.

5141
04:15:31,300 --> 04:15:32,140
Oh, god.

5142
04:15:39,430 --> 04:15:42,150
I, like, circle around, not trying to get the coins.

5143
04:15:42,250 --> 04:15:45,610
I'm just trying to wait out his... I'm trying to wait him out.

5144
04:15:47,830 --> 04:15:49,870
Otherwise, I'm gonna get beat.

5145
04:15:52,290 --> 04:15:52,950
Oh, no!

5146
04:15:55,570 --> 04:15:56,670
You don't need to kill them?

5147
04:15:58,010 --> 04:15:59,050
I guess that's true.

5148
04:16:03,910 --> 04:16:04,990
I guess that's true.

5149
04:16:05,170 --> 04:16:06,090
Oh, you guys are so right.

5150
04:16:09,450 --> 04:16:10,170
Oh, yeah.

5151
04:16:10,750 --> 04:16:11,470
You're so right.

5152
04:16:19,720 --> 04:16:20,960
Okay, but what about the next guy?

5153
04:16:21,220 --> 04:16:23,260
What about that guy right up there?

5154
04:16:23,720 --> 04:16:25,200
What do I do about him?

5155
04:16:41,260 --> 04:16:41,620
Oops.

5156
04:16:41,880 --> 04:16:44,280
I was too... See, that's why I gotta wait around a little bit.

5157
04:16:44,800 --> 04:16:46,440
That's why I gotta wait around a little bit.

5158
04:16:55,400 --> 04:16:58,020
That's why I gotta wait around a little bit.

5159
04:16:58,020 --> 04:16:58,040
I

5160
04:17:04,110 --> 04:17:06,070
honestly don't know how I might...

5161
04:17:12,500 --> 04:17:13,620
Let's try the other one.

5162
04:17:15,920 --> 04:17:21,840
I'm already... I feel like I... That one's gonna get me tilted real fast, I think.

5163
04:17:24,000 --> 04:17:26,280
Like, that one's gonna get me tilted real fast.

5164
04:17:28,740 --> 04:17:29,260
Okay.

5165
04:17:31,160 --> 04:17:33,580
We'll see what all the other challenges are like and...

5166
04:17:33,580 --> 04:17:34,000
WE CAN DO IT!!

5167
04:17:42,680 --> 04:17:43,400
Bring it back!

5168
04:17:44,520 --> 04:17:44,800
What

5169
04:17:50,290 --> 04:17:51,290
am I...?

5170
04:17:51,290 --> 04:17:52,310
What the hell?

5171
04:17:55,100 --> 04:17:55,320
Ow, yeah.

5172
04:17:55,660 --> 04:17:56,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5173
04:17:57,760 --> 04:17:59,060
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

5174
04:18:23,160 --> 04:18:23,640
Cool cut.

5175
04:18:25,540 --> 04:18:30,760
Okay, I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in.

5176
04:18:32,400 --> 04:18:32,680
No,

5177
04:18:47,670 --> 04:18:48,310
this is so unfair.

5178
04:18:50,770 --> 04:18:52,010
This is not fair!

5179
04:18:52,030 --> 04:18:53,050
What are you talking about?

5180
04:18:54,210 --> 04:18:55,550
Let me see him!

5181
04:18:55,630 --> 04:18:55,810
Please!

5182
04:18:56,130 --> 04:18:58,150
Just let me see him for two seconds!

5183
04:18:58,710 --> 04:18:59,270
Please!

5184
04:18:59,270 --> 04:19:00,290
Let me see him!

5185
04:19:00,410 --> 04:19:00,970
Please!

5186
04:19:04,250 --> 04:19:04,810
Please!

5187
04:19:04,990 --> 04:19:06,010
Let me see him!

5188
04:19:11,180 --> 04:19:12,300
Oh no!

5189
04:19:12,500 --> 04:19:15,740
This is going to be my downfall for real!

5190
04:19:15,740 --> 04:19:16,660
Oh shoot!

5191
04:19:20,000 --> 04:19:22,300
He's going to keep shooting at me now, isn't he?

5192
04:19:23,060 --> 04:19:23,740
That's okay.

5193
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:25,180
We can just kill him.

5194
04:19:26,840 --> 04:19:28,460
This is the motivation you need.

5195
04:19:36,420 --> 04:19:37,500
Oh my gosh!

5196
04:19:38,180 --> 04:19:39,240
Oh my gosh, please!

5197
04:19:39,460 --> 04:19:43,220
Oh, he's too evil, this guy!

5198
04:19:46,000 --> 04:19:47,560
He said, help me!

5199
04:19:48,820 --> 04:19:51,120
He said, Mito, help me!

5200
04:19:52,040 --> 04:19:53,500
That's what he said just now!

5201
04:19:55,720 --> 04:19:57,780
Oh my god, it was so sad.

5202
04:19:58,620 --> 04:20:00,160
He said, Mito, help me!

5203
04:20:09,470 --> 04:20:10,650
He did say, help me.

5204
04:20:11,690 --> 04:20:12,970
I might be...

5205
04:20:14,530 --> 04:20:15,450
making up the other part.

5206
04:20:15,850 --> 04:20:17,550
Jump towards the spikes when you have it.

5207
04:20:17,550 --> 04:20:18,790
Yeah, but they just produced so many.

5208
04:20:18,890 --> 04:20:19,810
I'm going to have to be so fast.

5209
04:20:20,830 --> 04:20:21,270
Okay.

5210
04:20:21,270 --> 04:20:21,710
Fast.

5211
04:20:22,290 --> 04:20:22,490
Speedy.

5212
04:20:23,070 --> 04:20:24,250
Speedy McGee.

5213
04:20:31,550 --> 04:20:32,950
He shot too fast.

5214
04:20:35,050 --> 04:20:35,450
Snake!

5215
04:20:39,660 --> 04:20:40,320
That's what he said.

5216
04:20:49,210 --> 04:20:49,610
Mito!

5217
04:20:51,550 --> 04:20:52,170
Oh my gosh.

5218
04:21:02,820 --> 04:21:05,280
Snake, I'm coming!

5219
04:21:05,540 --> 04:21:06,220
I'm coming, Snake.

5220
04:21:06,300 --> 04:21:06,600
I'm coming.

5221
04:21:06,920 --> 04:21:07,940
Oh my gosh, wait.

5222
04:21:08,000 --> 04:21:09,040
There's still more to the level.

5223
04:21:09,620 --> 04:21:11,020
There's still more to the level, Snake.

5224
04:21:13,760 --> 04:21:14,800
You gotta give me...

5225
04:21:14,800 --> 04:21:15,920
a second, Snake!

5226
04:21:16,180 --> 04:21:16,520
Okay.

5227
04:21:17,480 --> 04:21:18,140
What's happening?

5228
04:21:22,300 --> 04:21:23,760
What do I do with this?

5229
04:21:26,820 --> 04:21:28,120
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

5230
04:21:28,940 --> 04:21:29,800
Okay, okay, okay.

5231
04:21:30,880 --> 04:21:31,880
Oh, it's really heavy.

5232
04:21:33,180 --> 04:21:34,480
There's probably even going to be...

5233
04:21:34,480 --> 04:21:35,240
Okay, hold on.

5234
04:21:35,660 --> 04:21:38,380
I think I should drop it, right?

5235
04:21:40,120 --> 04:21:40,560
Uh...

5236
04:21:41,260 --> 04:21:42,760
And then pick up the rest?

5237
04:21:43,060 --> 04:21:43,720
Uh...

5238
04:21:44,560 --> 04:21:45,820
And then...

5239
04:21:46,580 --> 04:21:47,660
You need it?

5240
04:21:47,760 --> 04:21:48,020
Okay.

5241
04:21:49,680 --> 04:21:50,340
Oh.

5242
04:21:54,140 --> 04:21:54,710
That's awkward.

5243
04:21:54,930 --> 04:21:55,590
Anyway.

5244
04:21:56,210 --> 04:21:56,870
Oh!

5245
04:21:57,670 --> 04:21:59,530
Did I...

5246
04:22:07,810 --> 04:22:09,810
Was I supposed to get another one or...

5247
04:22:11,470 --> 04:22:12,370
Oh, no.

5248
04:22:13,390 --> 04:22:14,050
Ha!

5249
04:22:34,180 --> 04:22:34,840
Yeah!

5250
04:22:35,240 --> 04:22:35,740
Yeah!

5251
04:22:36,060 --> 04:22:36,560
Yeah!

5252
04:22:37,300 --> 04:22:37,980
Snake, come here.

5253
04:22:38,060 --> 04:22:38,340
Come here.

5254
04:22:39,000 --> 04:22:39,980
Oh, my God!

5255
04:22:40,360 --> 04:22:40,720
Oh,

5256
04:22:47,300 --> 04:22:47,580
my God!

5257
04:22:48,300 --> 04:22:49,020
Legendary soldier.

5258
04:22:49,240 --> 04:22:51,120
Tip to become the big boss!

5259
04:22:53,420 --> 04:22:54,400
Okay, you're coming home.

5260
04:22:54,680 --> 04:22:55,360
Come on, Snake!

5261
04:22:55,420 --> 04:22:55,980
Get on the bus!

5262
04:22:56,180 --> 04:22:57,140
Get on the bus, Snake!

5263
04:22:57,380 --> 04:22:58,100
Snake, where are you?

5264
04:22:58,100 --> 04:22:58,520
Get on the bus.

5265
04:22:59,600 --> 04:22:59,960
Snake!

5266
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:05,560
Going home.

5267
04:23:05,780 --> 04:23:06,420
Going home.

5268
04:23:06,480 --> 04:23:07,200
I'm coming with you!

5269
04:23:07,800 --> 04:23:08,940
I'm coming with you!

5270
04:23:09,340 --> 04:23:10,760
Shake him around a bit!

5271
04:23:10,760 --> 04:23:11,840
Oh good, you deserve it.

5272
04:23:11,880 --> 04:23:12,280
Thank you.

5273
04:23:14,760 --> 04:23:15,600
First try.

5274
04:23:18,860 --> 04:23:19,380
Snaaaake!

5275
04:23:22,900 --> 04:23:23,420
Snaaaake!

5276
04:23:24,560 --> 04:23:25,480
Where is he?

5277
04:23:27,960 --> 04:23:28,920
Oh, there he is.

5278
04:23:29,400 --> 04:23:32,740
Oh my god, Snake next to Johnny's combat.

5279
04:23:46,880 --> 04:23:48,400
Come here you bitch!

5280
04:23:48,840 --> 04:23:51,440
You really gave me a fright!

5281
04:23:51,880 --> 04:23:52,340
Yeah you!

5282
04:23:52,720 --> 04:23:53,280
You!

5283
04:23:53,840 --> 04:23:54,120
Yeah!

5284
04:23:54,540 --> 04:23:55,420
Yeah you!

5285
04:23:56,280 --> 04:23:56,840
Yeah!

5286
04:23:57,380 --> 04:23:57,940
Really!

5287
04:24:00,170 --> 04:24:01,910
You really put me through it!

5288
04:24:02,090 --> 04:24:02,450
Snake!

5289
04:24:06,670 --> 04:24:07,710
That's not your home.

5290
04:24:07,850 --> 04:24:08,770
Who are those people?

5291
04:24:10,170 --> 04:24:11,110
What does he do?

5292
04:24:11,570 --> 04:24:15,030
He does nothing because we need gacha.

5293
04:24:15,270 --> 04:24:16,350
We need money.

5294
04:24:18,030 --> 04:24:19,490
Aww, I need money.

5295
04:24:19,570 --> 04:24:20,090
Wait, where is...

5296
04:24:20,090 --> 04:24:22,350
Where is Ace Combat?

5297
04:24:29,580 --> 04:24:31,140
I wonder if I can replenish your fluids.

5298
04:24:31,260 --> 04:24:32,580
I can hear you sweating and drooling.

5299
04:24:32,820 --> 04:24:33,220
Stop!

5300
04:24:33,660 --> 04:24:34,380
Oh, there he is!

5301
04:24:36,280 --> 04:24:37,360
Oh, he also needs...

5302
04:24:37,360 --> 04:24:37,980
We need more money.

5303
04:24:40,740 --> 04:24:42,300
Knock him off the cliff.

5304
04:24:44,920 --> 04:24:47,060
I can't wait to get a Pyramid Head sword.

5305
04:24:54,900 --> 04:24:55,640
How much money?

5306
04:24:55,640 --> 04:24:57,140
Oh, I can only do two guys.

5307
04:24:57,580 --> 04:24:58,740
Will we get lucky?

5308
04:25:10,830 --> 04:25:11,950
Ace Aircraft!

5309
04:25:12,250 --> 04:25:13,170
Oh my god!

5310
04:25:14,230 --> 04:25:16,470
Congrats, you got John Ace Combat play.

5311
04:25:29,080 --> 04:25:30,200
This machine!

5312
04:25:31,020 --> 04:25:33,120
Who even put soda in there?

5313
04:25:35,380 --> 04:25:38,280
Oh my god, he's playing with his little airplane.

5314
04:25:38,560 --> 04:25:39,320
It's so cute.

5315
04:25:42,180 --> 04:25:43,280
So cute.

5316
04:25:43,340 --> 04:25:43,920
So cute.

5317
04:25:43,940 --> 04:25:44,260
So cute.

5318
04:25:45,340 --> 04:25:46,020
So cute.

5319
04:25:46,020 --> 04:25:48,820
Gosh, our little civilization is so good.

5320
04:25:50,640 --> 04:25:51,200
What does he

5321
04:26:01,780 --> 04:26:04,320
do when I hit him?

5322
04:26:05,060 --> 04:26:05,620
Nothing!

5323
04:26:05,980 --> 04:26:07,340
Stop being boring, Snake!

5324
04:26:08,100 --> 04:26:09,180
Snake, be fun!

5325
04:26:09,980 --> 04:26:12,480
Snake, don't be boring just because I'm poor!

5326
04:26:13,800 --> 04:26:15,040
That's so lame.

5327
04:26:19,840 --> 04:26:20,960
It's not fair!

5328
04:26:23,360 --> 04:26:25,380
What you need is gacha, I know.

5329
04:26:25,380 --> 04:26:29,680
Oh, he's making me feel poor.

5330
04:26:32,380 --> 04:26:33,780
Safari Park.

5331
04:26:35,040 --> 04:26:35,880
I

5332
04:26:47,900 --> 04:26:49,660
might end it here then.

5333
04:26:51,300 --> 04:26:55,880
Since I have rehearsal in about 30 minutes.

5334
04:26:56,280 --> 04:26:58,840
So I should probably get ready.

5335
04:27:00,560 --> 04:27:03,320
But we got Snake, you guys!

5336
04:27:03,880 --> 04:27:04,360
Oh, whoops.

5337
04:27:04,500 --> 04:27:05,980
We got Snake.

5338
04:27:09,480 --> 04:27:10,260
Is that it?

5339
04:27:10,860 --> 04:27:12,280
For Metal Gear characters?

5340
04:27:14,620 --> 04:27:15,460
Is there any more?

5341
04:27:15,540 --> 04:27:16,160
Don't say who.

5342
04:27:16,420 --> 04:27:16,980
Don't say who.

5343
04:27:18,720 --> 04:27:20,020
I don't think there's anyone else.

5344
04:27:22,920 --> 04:27:23,840
There's one more!

5345
04:27:29,380 --> 04:27:30,320
And John Ace Combat.

5346
04:27:30,360 --> 04:27:30,620
And John Ace Combat.

5347
04:27:30,620 --> 04:27:30,660
And John Ace Combat.

5348
04:27:30,820 --> 04:27:31,220
Okay.

5349
04:27:31,360 --> 04:27:31,960
One more.

5350
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:32,500
One more.

5351
04:27:33,360 --> 04:27:34,780
There's one more in the circle challenge?

5352
04:27:38,220 --> 04:27:39,640
I'm gonna go spoil it for me.

5353
04:27:39,800 --> 04:27:40,200
Okay.

5354
04:27:41,500 --> 04:27:42,560
I'm going to go split.

5355
04:27:44,220 --> 04:27:45,580
Spike, thanks for the 20!

5356
04:27:53,680 --> 04:27:58,860
There we go.

5357
04:28:00,300 --> 04:28:01,480
Let's go see who it is.

5358
04:28:03,040 --> 04:28:04,080
Hello Paisie!

5359
04:28:07,300 --> 04:28:07,820
Raiden!

5360
04:28:13,970 --> 04:28:14,650
Oh.

5361
04:28:17,230 --> 04:28:18,030
That's right.

5362
04:28:20,790 --> 04:28:21,590
I'm coming Raiden!

5363
04:28:21,690 --> 04:28:22,730
I'm coming Raiden!

5364
04:28:36,110 --> 04:28:37,230
I'm coming Raiden!

5365
04:28:59,770 --> 04:29:01,130
Oh shoot.

5366
04:29:11,020 --> 04:29:12,940
Don't just tease me like that!

5367
04:29:14,040 --> 04:29:16,140
What the hell is that?

5368
04:29:16,700 --> 04:29:17,380
Shoot.

5369
04:29:21,620 --> 04:29:25,420
I just got a notification on my phone that's like, um, rehearsal in 30 minutes.

5370
04:29:26,300 --> 04:29:27,140
Look at him!

5371
04:29:27,440 --> 04:29:28,360
Why does it got to be...

5372
04:29:28,360 --> 04:29:30,560
Why does it got to be Ryzen Raiden though?

5373
04:29:32,900 --> 04:29:33,980
Great first try.

5374
04:29:34,100 --> 04:29:34,500
Thank you.

5375
04:29:44,660 --> 04:29:45,320
Oh shoot.

5376
04:29:50,670 --> 04:29:51,850
We're locked in.

5377
04:29:52,450 --> 04:29:53,730
We're locked in.

5378
04:29:57,470 --> 04:29:58,110
Oh shoot!

5379
04:29:58,110 --> 04:29:58,310
Ow!

5380
04:30:05,210 --> 04:30:07,450
It's actually not so bad up until this birdie part.

5381
04:30:07,690 --> 04:30:08,690
Why does it got to be...

5382
04:30:08,690 --> 04:30:09,990
Why do I have to...

5383
04:30:09,990 --> 04:30:11,410
Why does it got to be like that?

5384
04:30:16,100 --> 04:30:17,060
It's actually quite...

5385
04:30:17,060 --> 04:30:17,840
Not so bad.

5386
04:30:18,380 --> 04:30:18,820
Until...

5387
04:30:19,440 --> 04:30:20,360
Really this part.

5388
04:30:25,700 --> 04:30:26,640
Oh I can't see.

5389
04:30:26,760 --> 04:30:27,000
Okay.

5390
04:30:33,550 --> 04:30:34,430
Oh shoot!

5391
04:30:34,930 --> 04:30:35,690
Oh my god!

5392
04:30:35,690 --> 04:30:36,130
What the...

5393
04:30:36,130 --> 04:30:37,210
How am I supposed to...

5394
04:30:37,710 --> 04:30:39,330
How the hell am I supposed to avoid that?

5395
04:30:39,810 --> 04:30:41,190
You just got to speedrun it.

5396
04:30:41,310 --> 04:30:41,490
Okay.

5397
04:30:41,910 --> 04:30:42,750
Alright, last try.

5398
04:30:43,190 --> 04:30:43,790
Last try.

5399
04:31:01,630 --> 04:31:02,330
Oh my god.

5400
04:31:02,410 --> 04:31:03,630
I missed the rope!

5401
04:31:12,940 --> 04:31:13,320
Last...

5402
04:31:13,320 --> 04:31:14,540
Real last try.

5403
04:31:14,720 --> 04:31:15,780
I want to try on the birds.

5404
04:31:15,880 --> 04:31:16,140
That's...

5405
04:31:16,140 --> 04:31:17,240
That's where I...

5406
04:31:17,240 --> 04:31:18,580
Last try for real.

5407
04:31:19,120 --> 04:31:20,140
Get into the birds.

5408
04:31:20,300 --> 04:31:20,360
You know?

5409
04:31:27,670 --> 04:31:28,550
I shot.

5410
04:31:36,320 --> 04:31:36,900
Good.

5411
04:31:37,000 --> 04:31:37,380
Boom.

5412
04:31:38,680 --> 04:31:39,400
Crest

5413
04:31:49,020 --> 04:31:49,400
over!

5414
04:31:49,540 --> 04:31:49,900
You!

5415
04:31:50,020 --> 04:31:50,560
Yo!

5416
04:31:52,860 --> 04:31:53,580
Oh!

5417
04:31:53,760 --> 04:31:56,160
I think they should have put in Tony Hawk reference...

5418
04:31:56,160 --> 04:31:57,260
And multiple of them too.

5419
04:31:58,860 --> 04:31:59,580
Wait.

5420
04:32:00,900 --> 04:32:01,960
No no.

5421
04:32:02,800 --> 04:32:03,780
No no.

5422
04:32:04,880 --> 04:32:05,480
No no.

5423
04:32:05,920 --> 04:32:06,840
No no.

5424
04:32:07,260 --> 04:32:08,200
No no no!

5425
04:32:08,980 --> 04:32:11,040
No no no no no!

5426
04:32:11,160 --> 04:32:11,280
No!

5427
04:32:11,280 --> 04:32:11,400
No!

5428
04:32:11,560 --> 04:32:12,040
No!

5429
04:32:12,900 --> 04:32:13,620
No!

5430
04:32:13,700 --> 04:32:14,340
No!

5431
04:32:14,420 --> 04:32:14,860
No!

5432
04:32:15,180 --> 04:32:15,260
No!

5433
04:32:15,740 --> 04:32:16,460
No!

5434
04:32:16,720 --> 04:32:18,340
Stop distracting me!

5435
04:32:19,960 --> 04:32:21,800
You're trying to sabotage me!

5436
04:32:21,900 --> 04:32:22,080
I know!

5437
04:32:27,900 --> 04:32:29,680
You sabotaged me!

5438
04:32:32,920 --> 04:32:34,740
I'll never forgive you!

5439
04:32:36,160 --> 04:32:37,640
You cursed me!

5440
04:32:45,450 --> 04:32:46,530
You sabotaged me!

5441
04:33:00,430 --> 04:33:01,290
Don't ask why.

5442
04:33:01,510 --> 04:33:03,810
Oh, I have to start on the left side?

5443
04:33:04,230 --> 04:33:05,490
I just do.

5444
04:33:06,470 --> 04:33:06,830
Okay.

5445
04:33:11,180 --> 04:33:11,840
Oh my gosh.

5446
04:33:12,660 --> 04:33:13,020
Okay.

5447
04:33:17,450 --> 04:33:19,090
I can't even get to the rope!

5448
04:33:19,390 --> 04:33:22,570
I can't even get to the rope.

5449
04:33:22,830 --> 04:33:23,670
Okay, I give up.

5450
04:33:23,830 --> 04:33:24,370
For now.

5451
04:33:24,610 --> 04:33:26,670
Sorry Ryland, you're not as important as Big Boss.

5452
04:33:28,470 --> 04:33:30,190
You're not as important as Big Boss.

5453
04:33:30,350 --> 04:33:30,490
Okay.

5454
04:33:32,250 --> 04:33:34,530
Don't swing back and forth, just jump off of it again.

5455
04:33:39,770 --> 04:33:41,070
Gotta go on first swing?

5456
04:33:41,890 --> 04:33:42,290
Fine.

5457
04:33:42,790 --> 04:33:43,950
I'll try one more time.

5458
04:33:50,280 --> 04:33:51,840
Can't wait to see my Oshii on the Hornet tomorrow!

5459
04:33:52,080 --> 04:33:52,240
Yeah!

5460
04:33:52,440 --> 04:33:53,280
See you there John!

5461
04:33:54,700 --> 04:33:55,380
Thank you!

5462
04:33:56,580 --> 04:33:57,580
I'll see you there.

5463
04:34:00,580 --> 04:34:01,780
Okay, last try.

5464
04:34:03,400 --> 04:34:06,340
What comes after that part?

5465
04:34:07,240 --> 04:34:08,240
I

5466
04:34:35,620 --> 04:34:36,840
pressed over!

5467
04:34:52,660 --> 04:34:54,180
Oh my god.

5468
04:35:01,010 --> 04:35:02,290
Oh my god.

5469
04:35:02,410 --> 04:35:03,230
That was spooky.

5470
04:35:12,410 --> 04:35:13,410
Okay.

5471
04:35:13,610 --> 04:35:15,270
First swing!

5472
04:35:15,530 --> 04:35:16,410
First swing!

5473
04:35:16,530 --> 04:35:17,090
First swing!

5474
04:35:20,390 --> 04:35:20,830
Okay,

5475
04:35:29,490 --> 04:35:30,150
now I give up.

5476
04:35:30,250 --> 04:35:30,750
Now for real.

5477
04:35:31,070 --> 04:35:34,330
Okay guys, thank you for streaming today.

5478
04:35:34,530 --> 04:35:35,090
I had fun.

5479
04:35:35,130 --> 04:35:36,110
I hope you guys had fun too.

5480
04:35:36,290 --> 04:35:39,110
We have just a couple more worlds for...

5481
04:35:41,730 --> 04:35:42,170
For...

5482
04:35:43,350 --> 04:35:44,090
The bots.

5483
04:35:44,390 --> 04:35:45,510
Like we have...

5484
04:35:45,510 --> 04:35:49,430
We have that big one down over here?

5485
04:35:50,390 --> 04:35:52,830
I don't think I'll like 100%, you know?

5486
04:35:53,330 --> 04:35:56,430
Like, if I don't complete all the challenges, that's okay.

5487
04:35:56,950 --> 04:35:59,550
Like, if I don't get all the challenge worlds, that's okay.

5488
04:35:59,930 --> 04:36:04,490
But of course I wanna at least like complete the main worlds in the story and stuff.

5489
04:36:10,980 --> 04:36:11,420
Huh?

5490
04:36:16,750 --> 04:36:18,470
I'm confused by your super chat.

5491
04:36:24,110 --> 04:36:26,930
But yeah, so then we'll have this one.

5492
04:36:27,350 --> 04:36:28,310
And then this one.

5493
04:36:28,310 --> 04:36:34,150
It really just depends on how I feel about some of the challenge places.

5494
04:36:34,710 --> 04:36:37,050
Maybe someday in the future I can do like a...

5495
04:36:37,790 --> 04:36:40,550
Just the challenges and endurance or something.

5496
04:36:40,830 --> 04:36:41,530
Great job getting snake!

5497
04:36:41,730 --> 04:36:42,190
Thank you!

5498
04:36:42,690 --> 04:36:44,550
Hope they have some wild arms characters.

5499
04:36:45,070 --> 04:36:45,770
Good luck with her.

5500
04:36:45,830 --> 04:36:46,350
So thank you!

5501
04:36:47,650 --> 04:36:48,550
Thanks Tri-Princess!

5502
04:36:50,130 --> 04:36:50,590
Thank you!

5503
04:36:50,690 --> 04:36:51,310
Thanks for the fun party!

5504
04:36:51,550 --> 04:36:52,670
Thanks for the fun stream!

5505
04:36:52,790 --> 04:36:54,210
You've definitely been getting better at this game.

5506
04:36:54,330 --> 04:36:54,670
Thank you!

5507
04:36:56,590 --> 04:36:56,990
Yeah!

5508
04:36:58,350 --> 04:36:58,870
Thank you!

5509
04:36:58,950 --> 04:36:59,130
Thank you!

5510
04:36:59,150 --> 04:36:59,370
Thank you!

5511
04:37:01,270 --> 04:37:01,670
Um...

5512
04:37:02,650 --> 04:37:03,050
Glad...

5513
04:37:03,610 --> 04:37:05,170
Today you got John Ace Combat.

5514
04:37:05,350 --> 04:37:06,910
We got snake and we got Ace Combat!

5515
04:37:09,670 --> 04:37:11,150
Oh, apparently they do Virlint!

5516
04:37:11,270 --> 04:37:11,810
You're so lucky!

5517
04:37:13,490 --> 04:37:15,110
But hopefully I can get them too.

5518
04:37:17,130 --> 04:37:18,450
But for now I'm gonna go!

5519
04:37:18,690 --> 04:37:20,810
And I will see you guys...

5520
04:37:22,910 --> 04:37:23,310
Tomorrow...

5521
04:37:23,310 --> 04:37:24,870
I'm gonna play...

5522
04:37:26,270 --> 04:37:26,670
Holocure?

5523
04:37:26,710 --> 04:37:28,090
I think I wrote on my schedule.

5524
04:37:29,170 --> 04:37:30,750
Can't remember what I wrote.

5525
04:37:31,250 --> 04:37:31,770
Um...

5526
04:37:32,310 --> 04:37:34,850
If you didn't see I posted like a mini schedule.

5527
04:37:35,750 --> 04:37:37,370
For the rest of the week on Twitter.

5528
04:37:38,290 --> 04:37:41,250
It's made in MS Paint so I wasn't gonna like...

5529
04:37:41,250 --> 04:37:43,330
I wasn't gonna like...

5530
04:37:44,270 --> 04:37:45,930
Post it anywhere else.

5531
04:37:46,190 --> 04:37:47,930
But next week we'll have a schedule for sure.

5532
04:37:49,270 --> 04:37:50,310
And tomorrow...

5533
04:37:50,310 --> 04:37:52,870
I have off-season Off-Kai concert.

5534
04:37:53,430 --> 04:37:55,150
So I'll be there as well.

5535
04:37:56,550 --> 04:37:57,590
And uh...

5536
04:37:57,590 --> 04:37:59,630
The weekend after I have another concert.

5537
04:38:00,130 --> 04:38:00,850
Um...

5538
04:38:01,450 --> 04:38:02,190
V-Muse.

5539
04:38:02,490 --> 04:38:03,390
In Malaysia.

5540
04:38:04,370 --> 04:38:06,310
Where I'll be also...

5541
04:38:06,310 --> 04:38:09,070
Performing together with KLP48!

5542
04:38:10,330 --> 04:38:11,390
One of the...

5543
04:38:11,390 --> 04:38:12,750
The official...

5544
04:38:13,370 --> 04:38:15,190
Sister group of...

5545
04:38:15,190 --> 04:38:16,130
AKB48!

5546
04:38:16,510 --> 04:38:17,230
So...

5547
04:38:17,230 --> 04:38:18,090
That's kinda crazy.

5548
04:38:18,310 --> 04:38:19,330
Two concerts...

5549
04:38:19,330 --> 04:38:20,590
In a row.

5550
04:38:20,830 --> 04:38:21,330
My...

5551
04:38:21,330 --> 04:38:24,590
My schedule for next week is kinda weird because...

5552
04:38:25,630 --> 04:38:27,330
I'm not sure exactly what time...

5553
04:38:27,330 --> 04:38:29,130
Things will be at for V-Muse.

5554
04:38:29,450 --> 04:38:29,970
So...

5555
04:38:30,590 --> 04:38:30,990
Uh...

5556
04:38:30,990 --> 04:38:33,090
Either Friday or Saturday I...

5557
04:38:33,090 --> 04:38:34,510
Won't be...

5558
04:38:34,510 --> 04:38:34,930
Um...

5559
04:38:35,590 --> 04:38:36,110
Streaming.

5560
04:38:36,450 --> 04:38:37,690
Not sure...

5561
04:38:37,690 --> 04:38:38,630
I don't know yet.

5562
04:38:38,850 --> 04:38:39,370
So...

5563
04:38:39,370 --> 04:38:40,310
Um...

5564
04:38:40,950 --> 04:38:41,730
I don't...

5565
04:38:41,730 --> 04:38:42,330
Wanna like...

5566
04:38:42,330 --> 04:38:42,770
Put my...

5567
04:38:42,770 --> 04:38:44,150
Put something out and then...

5568
04:38:44,150 --> 04:38:45,750
Have to take it back.

5569
04:38:45,930 --> 04:38:46,310
So...

5570
04:38:46,310 --> 04:38:47,050
Yeah!

5571
04:38:47,450 --> 04:38:48,090
But yeah!

5572
04:38:48,190 --> 04:38:48,850
Thank you guys!

5573
04:38:49,270 --> 04:38:50,570
Astro Bot is so much fun!

5574
04:38:50,750 --> 04:38:51,750
What does Scan do?

5575
04:38:53,210 --> 04:38:53,730
Oh!

5576
04:38:53,730 --> 04:38:53,970
Oh!

5577
04:38:55,470 --> 04:38:56,190
Oh my gosh!

5578
04:38:56,210 --> 04:38:56,910
It's so frustrating!

5579
04:38:57,090 --> 04:38:57,750
I haven't compl...

5580
04:38:57,750 --> 04:38:58,370
I haven't...

5581
04:38:59,690 --> 04:39:02,330
I haven't 100%-ed literally any of these.

5582
04:39:03,930 --> 04:39:04,770
So frustrating!

5583
04:39:05,490 --> 04:39:05,670
Ah!

5584
04:39:07,650 --> 04:39:09,730
Maybe I'll try and get some of the puzzle pieces off stream.

5585
04:39:09,870 --> 04:39:10,170
I don't know!

5586
04:39:10,550 --> 04:39:11,210
I don't know!

5587
04:39:11,450 --> 04:39:11,810
I don't know!

5588
04:39:11,870 --> 04:39:12,050
I don't know!

5589
04:39:13,970 --> 04:39:15,390
You stop using BlueSky?

5590
04:39:15,570 --> 04:39:15,770
No!

5591
04:39:16,530 --> 04:39:16,950
I...

5592
04:39:16,950 --> 04:39:17,570
Um...

5593
04:39:17,570 --> 04:39:19,270
People told me a way to...

5594
04:39:19,270 --> 04:39:20,450
Be able to post...

5595
04:39:20,450 --> 04:39:21,210
Double post...

5596
04:39:21,210 --> 04:39:22,070
Cross post...

5597
04:39:22,070 --> 04:39:24,270
On Twitter and on BlueSky.

5598
04:39:24,370 --> 04:39:24,650
But...

5599
04:39:24,650 --> 04:39:25,170
Since I went to BlueSky...

5600
04:39:25,170 --> 04:39:25,530
I was in Japan.

5601
04:39:25,710 --> 04:39:27,030
I hadn't had time to set it up.

5602
04:39:27,090 --> 04:39:27,290
And...

5603
04:39:27,290 --> 04:39:28,390
Since I got back...

5604
04:39:28,390 --> 04:39:29,630
I hadn't had time to set it up.

5605
04:39:30,030 --> 04:39:30,470
So...

5606
04:39:30,470 --> 04:39:30,990
Um...

5607
04:39:30,990 --> 04:39:32,550
It really is just that.

5608
04:39:32,830 --> 04:39:33,630
And also...

5609
04:39:33,630 --> 04:39:34,990
I only have it on mobile.

5610
04:39:35,110 --> 04:39:35,450
I don't...

5611
04:39:35,450 --> 04:39:36,150
Can you...

5612
04:39:36,610 --> 04:39:38,610
Get on BlueSky on...

5613
04:39:39,450 --> 04:39:39,890
On...

5614
04:39:39,890 --> 04:39:40,530
Desktop?

5615
04:39:41,990 --> 04:39:42,830
I don't know.

5616
04:39:48,140 --> 04:39:48,580
Oh!

5617
04:39:48,620 --> 04:39:49,340
It is on desktop too?

5618
04:39:49,480 --> 04:39:49,700
Okay.

5619
04:39:49,760 --> 04:39:49,920
Okay.

5620
04:39:50,560 --> 04:39:51,820
I have to remember...

5621
04:39:51,820 --> 04:39:52,640
My login.

5622
04:39:55,760 --> 04:39:57,880
I have to remember my login.

5623
04:39:58,740 --> 04:39:59,680
But once...

5624
04:39:59,680 --> 04:40:01,480
Once I have time to set up...

5625
04:40:01,480 --> 04:40:02,160
Everything...

5626
04:40:02,160 --> 04:40:02,540
I will.

5627
04:40:02,800 --> 04:40:05,340
My priorities have been focused elsewhere.

5628
04:40:05,680 --> 04:40:05,960
So...

5629
04:40:05,960 --> 04:40:06,820
Sorry...

5630
04:40:06,820 --> 04:40:08,220
If you use BlueSky...

5631
04:40:08,220 --> 04:40:08,940
And don't use Twitter.

5632
04:40:09,220 --> 04:40:09,740
And...

5633
04:40:10,540 --> 04:40:11,060
Um...

5634
04:40:11,980 --> 04:40:13,560
I haven't been posting there.

5635
04:40:15,580 --> 04:40:16,220
So yeah.

5636
04:40:18,620 --> 04:40:20,000
You mean a separate client?

5637
04:40:20,180 --> 04:40:20,340
No.

5638
04:40:20,380 --> 04:40:20,960
There is like...

5639
04:40:20,960 --> 04:40:21,660
Some...

5640
04:40:21,660 --> 04:40:22,780
People were telling me...

5641
04:40:22,780 --> 04:40:24,180
A way to cross post.

5642
04:40:24,700 --> 04:40:26,080
So that I can...

5643
04:40:26,080 --> 04:40:27,940
Post at both at the same time.

5644
04:40:30,680 --> 04:40:31,220
Cause...

5645
04:40:31,220 --> 04:40:32,600
I can't remember...

5646
04:40:32,600 --> 04:40:34,520
To post more than one place.

5647
04:40:38,020 --> 04:40:39,120
Can't wait to see you tomorrow.

5648
04:40:39,240 --> 04:40:39,620
See you tomorrow!

5649
04:40:40,780 --> 04:40:41,080
Yippee!

5650
04:40:41,660 --> 04:40:44,480
I can't bring my 5 foot JPEG dog.

5651
04:40:44,760 --> 04:40:45,640
So sad.

5652
04:40:46,680 --> 04:40:47,420
You could.

5653
04:40:48,200 --> 04:40:49,080
But I believe.

5654
04:40:50,720 --> 04:40:51,260
Okay!

5655
04:40:51,700 --> 04:40:53,100
Thank you guys.

5656
04:40:53,280 --> 04:40:53,680
Thank you guys.

5657
04:40:53,780 --> 04:40:54,260
Have a good night.

5658
04:40:54,340 --> 04:40:55,400
And I will see you...

5659
04:40:56,160 --> 04:40:56,700
Later!

5660
04:40:57,280 --> 04:40:57,820
Wait.

5661
04:40:57,860 --> 04:40:57,920
Wait.

5662
04:40:58,300 --> 04:40:59,020
Before I leave.

5663
04:41:04,440 --> 04:41:05,080
One second.

5664
04:41:05,320 --> 04:41:05,920
Before I leave.

5665
04:41:09,720 --> 04:41:10,220
Oh my god.

5666
04:41:10,240 --> 04:41:11,280
Look at him hanging out with them.

5667
04:41:14,700 --> 04:41:15,280
Keep running.

5668
04:41:15,520 --> 04:41:16,020
Keep going.

5669
04:41:16,080 --> 04:41:16,280
Keep going.

5670
04:41:16,420 --> 04:41:16,680
Faster.

5671
04:41:16,740 --> 04:41:16,920
Faster.

5672
04:41:17,020 --> 04:41:17,480
Oh my god.

5673
04:41:17,520 --> 04:41:17,940
Get on my head.

5674
04:41:17,980 --> 04:41:18,380
Get on my head.

5675
04:41:18,520 --> 04:41:19,180
Get on my head.

5676
04:41:19,240 --> 04:41:19,620
Get on my head.

5677
04:41:20,840 --> 04:41:21,480
And this...

5678
04:41:21,480 --> 04:41:22,560
I kind of look like Eva.

5679
04:41:22,640 --> 04:41:23,000
Don't I?

5680
04:41:23,920 --> 04:41:24,520
From behind.

5681
04:41:24,620 --> 04:41:25,560
I look like Eva.

5682
04:41:25,620 --> 04:41:26,040
A little bit.

5683
04:41:26,200 --> 04:41:26,620
It's the hair.

5684
04:41:27,760 --> 04:41:28,240
Not allowed.

5685
04:41:28,260 --> 04:41:28,860
He's too big.

5686
04:41:28,980 --> 04:41:29,260
No!

5687
04:41:29,740 --> 04:41:30,060
He's too big.

5688
04:41:52,600 --> 04:41:53,020
Wait.

5689
04:41:53,040 --> 04:41:54,580
She was blowing...

5690
04:41:55,400 --> 04:41:56,520
You guys didn't see that.

5691
04:41:56,880 --> 04:42:00,080
She takes the memory card out of her head.

5692
04:42:00,200 --> 04:42:01,800
And then blows into it.

5693
04:42:07,640 --> 04:42:10,320
She was blowing into her memory card!

5694
04:42:11,480 --> 04:42:12,020
Do it.

5695
04:42:12,100 --> 04:42:12,760
Do it again.

5696
04:42:12,820 --> 04:42:13,160
Do it again.

5697
04:42:13,200 --> 04:42:13,820
Show them all.

5698
04:42:14,080 --> 04:42:14,500
Spyro.

5699
04:42:14,640 --> 04:42:15,300
Get out of here.

5700
04:42:15,540 --> 04:42:17,160
Why do you think you're involved in this?

5701
04:42:18,360 --> 04:42:19,060
Do it again.

5702
04:42:19,220 --> 04:42:19,560
Do it again.

5703
04:42:21,400 --> 04:42:21,820
No!

5704
04:42:21,820 --> 04:42:22,360
Stop it!

5705
04:42:23,240 --> 04:42:23,800
It's not...

5706
04:42:23,840 --> 04:42:24,820
Snake, that's a big boss.

5707
04:42:24,960 --> 04:42:25,660
Yeah, I know.

5708
04:42:33,080 --> 04:42:33,580
Okay.

5709
04:42:33,680 --> 04:42:36,840
Well, she died from blowing into her memory card, apparently.

5710
04:42:37,620 --> 04:42:38,720
Thank you, guys!

5711
04:42:39,220 --> 04:42:39,660
Thank you...

5712
04:42:39,660 --> 04:42:40,700
Spyro, stop.

5713
04:42:40,960 --> 04:42:42,680
You're creeping me out over there.

5714
04:42:43,040 --> 04:42:43,540
Spyro.

5715
04:42:44,420 --> 04:42:44,920
Stop.

5716
04:42:46,800 --> 04:42:47,300
Okay.

5717
04:42:47,680 --> 04:42:48,520
Bye-bye.

5718
04:43:00,760 --> 04:43:01,260
Snake.

5719
04:43:01,740 --> 04:43:02,940
They come here often.

5720
04:43:03,380 --> 04:43:04,020
I'm sorry.

5721
04:43:04,840 --> 04:43:05,480
I'm sorry.

5722
04:43:06,260 --> 04:43:06,760
I'm sorry.

5723
04:43:07,240 --> 04:43:07,400
I'm sorry.
