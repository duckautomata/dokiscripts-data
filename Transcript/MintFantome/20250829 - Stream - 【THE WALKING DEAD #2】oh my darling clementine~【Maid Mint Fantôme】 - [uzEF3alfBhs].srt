Turn it up.

13
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,470
The wind is like a, it's making my ears tingle.

14
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,970
It's making my, it's like, it's like making my brain buzz a little bit.

15
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,070
It's so like, it's in my ears.

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,380
Anyway, welcome back.

17
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,160
Welcome to The Walking Dead.

18
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,460
This game is so old.

19
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,220
Is it?

20
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,840
I think it said 20.

21
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
Well, it had to be before.

22
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,360
Glenn.

23
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,200

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,560

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,440

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,460
2012.

27
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't say that.

28
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,090
That was over 10 years ago.

29
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,670
2012.

30
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,290
If you were born in 2012, you are a child now.

31
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,350

41
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
So we'll see.

42
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,300

We'll have Minto.

45
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,960
I know, but I had a lot of stuff that I was planning and I don't want to get into it because I don't want to be sad about it again.

46
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,760
I don't want to be sad about it again.

47
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,860
But, you know, I'll do my best to still have something fun for my birthday.

48
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:09,890
Anyway.

49
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,710
What was I going to say?

50
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,130
Oh, I don't remember.

51
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,270
Oh, I don't remember what I was going to say.

52
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,610
I woke up feeling today a little...

53
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,850
You guys know when you...

54
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,410
My throat wasn't hurting, but you know when you wake up and your throat feels like swollen a little bit?

55
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,430
And you're like, oh no.

56
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,390
I think I'm getting sick.

57
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,430
That's how I've woke up.

58
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,870
And I was like, oh no!

59
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,670
Oh no!

60
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,900
I think I don't know.

61
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,340
Hopefully I'm not sick.

62
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Hopefully.

63
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,220
Especially if you snore.

64
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,140
I don't snore.

65
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,780
I don't think I snore.

66
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,600
Barry didn't say that I snore.

67
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,200
She said that I breathed, which is also incorrect because I'm a ghost.

68
00:11:09,420 --> 00:12:01,620
She probably mistook breathing or my ectoplasm, like kind of of sloshing around for for for breathing you know so yeah how dare you breathe while sleeping i don't i don't old habits die hard i guess it's hard right like i feel like i'm breathing i feel like i need to breathe but i don't because i'm dead already ask your cats they should know my cat snores and my cat sleeps next to my head and so sometimes i will hear him snoring next to me and i wake up from him snoring he kind of he goes like

69
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,840
that's how he snores he's such an old man my cat is like the oldest man

70
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,600
He's such a, he's been such a grump lately.

71
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,340
I had to get a, I had to get another vet appointment for him.

72
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,600
And I was referred to a specialist.

73
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,420
But the specialist was not available until October.

74
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,320
And I'm like, if my cat is really sick, I have to wait two months.

75
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
That's crazy.

76
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,540
Like, that's a really long time.

77
00:12:43,560 --> 00:13:17,900
to wait my cat woke himself up by storing that's so cute uh no what it is what it is can a ghost in a zombie originate from the same body is there zombie walking around while i'm here i don't think so that would be so awkward one of us would have to change Good at celebrating your birthday with little Caesars.

78
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,860
We can also watch SpongeBob.

79
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,580
Let's go.

80
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Big Mac!

81
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you so much for the vibe, Getsu.

82
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,460
Thank you.

83
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,820
What if I, like... Well, no.

84
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,500
Actually, last Halloween, I dressed up as a...

85
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,040
As a... A zombie.

86
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,940
It's kind of funny.

87
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,260
A ghost as a zombie.

88
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
My cat does the same.

89
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,620
It's like they're having a whistle next to your face.

90
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,100
still sleep.

91
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,720
My cat maybe snores too loud then.

92
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,800
Hopefully the cat though is okay.

93
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah, hopefully.

94
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,440
Hopefully, hopefully.

95
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,320
So a human?

96
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,420
The zombie's not a human.

97
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,380
The zombie is a zombie.

98
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,220
And a ghost is a ghost.

99
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,100
Dumb people, I mean, I'm former, former human.

100
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,710
Yeah.

101
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,690
Former human.

102
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,090
Ex-human.

103
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,250
FNAF birthday?

104
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,510
I always wanted to have a Chuck E.

105
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,270
Cheese birthday, but I couldn't.

106
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,190
When I was a Wee Wisp, we couldn't have a birthday at Chuck E.

107
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,450
Cheese because that's the place that all the gangs took over.

108
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,260
Excited to see you continue this game.

109
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,220
Let's get started.

110
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,500
Oh, I should have probably been on this screen, huh?

111
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,900
After that, I didn't think about it.

112
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,920
So, do I...

113
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,880
I just click...

114
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,380
Wait, episode status.

115
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,540
It's coming.

116
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,100
Coming soon.

117
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:15,860
Wait.

118
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,660
Huh?

119
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,140
Wait, is this once you beat the game?

120
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,970
Oh, it's DLC.

121
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,590
Oh.

122
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,450
I'm not looking.

123
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,790
I'm not looking.

124
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,350
I'm not looking.

125
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:31,890
I'm not looking.

126
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,450
I'm not looking.

127
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,670
Don't ignore that.

128
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,470
Ignore what?

129
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,410
What did I...

130
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:37,650
What?

131
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,650
What happened?

132
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,250
Oh, it's a prequel.

133
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,630
That's exciting.

134
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,790
Oh my gosh, yeah.

135
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:58,590
We can just pretend it's 2012 and we're excited for the DLC that's coming out of the new Walking Dead Telltale.

138
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,330
He's already dead.

139
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,430
Okay, that's all right.

140
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,890
Episode two, starved for hope.

141
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,770
Why do they look like this?

142
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,370
It's kind of...

143
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,350
Okay.

144
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,300
Okay.

145
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,660
Oh, oh, good.

We get a preview.

147
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,400
I know who you are.

148
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
I got another good one for you.

149
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,160
Okay, I called that one.

150
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,400
I told him to keep his eyes on the road like five times.

151
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,500
I knew that was gonna happen.

152
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,500
Stop mocking 13 year old.

153
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,900
What do you mean?

154
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,380
You keep an eye on that front door.

155
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,320
You're our lookout.

156
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,400
It's Doug.

157
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,420
Doug!

158
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,120
No!

159
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,340
You got it, boss.

160
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,880
Doug!

161
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:36,900
Doug!

162
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,420
I should have saved you instead, Doug!

163
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,680
Okay, we're gonna kill that guy today.

164
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,960
With the bloody end of an axe handle, maybe?

165
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,320
Nobody threatens my boy.

166
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:51,900
Ah!

167
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,120
No!

168
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,440
Oh, Doug!

169
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,960
Oh, the humanity!

170
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,820
That's me.

171
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,420
And I don't give a shit about what happens to you.

172
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,300
But if anything happens to my...

173
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:29,670
daughter or that little girl you've got with you you watch your ass your ass is grass grandpa this game series adapts to the choices you make the story is tailored to how you play where's the ghost cafe at it's it's a secret secret location chapter 2 baby

174
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,140
Oh.

175
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,280
Get back into the swing of things.

176
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,110
That was a knee-slapper for...

177
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,510
Who that?

178
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,670
Who are you?

179
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,090
Otacon!

180
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,250
Good one.

181
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:55,730
It was.

182
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,950
That's another meal lost.

183
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,990
Are we eating the zombies now?

184
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,990
What do you mean a meal?

185
00:19:01,990 --> 00:20:03,350
food in three months it seemed like so much at the time maybe you shouldn't have opened new Doug yeah except then I'd probably be food by now trust me I have no regrets rabbits hardly a meal mark but I'd take it we're all hungry zombies eat rabbits too it's rabbit hunting when I accidentally grabbed for Carly's rations the other night I thought she was gonna take off my hand we're all on edge just cut us some slack we're hungry you're right i wish i knew for sure how much food we have left oh uh wait did i play this on p oh you'll have to ask did i play this with controller before no i don't think so or mishandling it if you ask ken no no i just worried about his kid getting enough i'll worry about clementine too clementine you think kenny's having any more luck than we are out here suddenly felt bizarre i sure hope so yeah between the lack of food and kenny and Lily fighting all the time.

186
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,050
Things are getting pretty tense back at the motor end.

187
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,250
You know, Kenny's been talking about taking off if he can get that RV running.

188
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,210
Kenny won't abandon us.

189
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,810
Yeah, Kenny is good.

190
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,130
Kenny won't abandon us.

191
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,150
Kenny is a good guy.

192
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,950
I guess we'll see.

193
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,250
Can't blame him, though.

194
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,690
Did you hear Larry going off on him last night?

195
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,430
Oh, my God.

196
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,790
We see your guy's deal anyway.

197
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,410
Seems like he's got a problem with you in particular.

198
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,590
We gotta kill that man.

199
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,710
Larry?

200
00:20:34,530 --> 00:21:27,010
uh I think uh he thinks I'm a danger oh wait I thought it said I thought it said the one putting us in danger he's the way I think he's dangerous I misread it I wouldn't be surprised if she's been skimming rations for him and I know Lily thinks he's getting weaker but the guy's all muscle he's a walking pile driver I know I wouldn't want to be stuck in a room with him yeah punch you in the face one time yeah knock me flat yeah he's tried to kill us he tried to murder us you get those zombies to eat us for a bird uh yeah don't risk the no wait can you make the shot it's a long shot i need to waste the bullets trust me if i don't think i can hit it i won't shoot oh okay

201
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,250
Oh, wow Shit, was that Kenny?

202
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,030
Oh, no, come on

203
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:48,830
What a weenie Great shot

204
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,580
Is he in a trap?

205
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,740
Oh, no, no, oh Jesus Christ oh no Oh, shit.

206
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,460
No, no.

207
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,340
Please don't kill us.

208
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,720
We just want to help our teacher.

209
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,620
We'll leave, I swear.

210
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,460
Lee, you guys okay?

211
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,140
Get it off.

212
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Get it off.

213
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,560
God damn it.

214
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,480
Get it off me.

215
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,280
Oh, my God.

216
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,880
Travis, maybe they can help.

217
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,680
These might be the same guys that raided our camp, and we barely got away from that.

218
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,520
I think if they were, what?

219
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,540
Why the fuck is there a bear trap out here?

220
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,680
Who raided your camp?

221
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,100
I don't know.

222
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,200
Guys with guns.

223
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,640
Uh-oh.

224
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,060
Please, we won't bother you.

225
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,600
I swear.

226
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,260
Lee, this is fucked up.

227
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,140
We've got to help you.

228
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,920
Please.

229
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,560
Then shut up.

230
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,000
My dad was special forces.

231
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,920
I know what I'm doing.

232
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,620
Just see if you can get him out.

233
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,600
After that, you can leave us or whatever.

234
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,420
I don't care.

235
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,040
My dad was special forces.

236
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,680
Was he bitten?

237
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,380
Was he bitten?

238
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,020
Bitten?

239
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,400
No, I swear.

240
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,480
Uh-huh.

241
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,160
Uh-oh.

242
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,040
Hurry, please.

243
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Hurry.

244
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:53,920
Uh-oh.

245
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,980
Uh-oh.

246
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,080
Uh-oh.

247
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,280
Uh-oh.

248
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,760
Lee, this trap's been altered.

249
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,180
There's no release latch.

250
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,880
That's evil.

251
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,420
What do they think the zombies are going to release themselves?

252
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,740
Shit, walkers.

253
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,140
Because now we'll never leave.

254
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,580
Please, get me out of this.

255
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,180
Uh-oh.

256
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,120
Get the boys back.

257
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,480
I don't think we should have taken the shot.

258
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,280
Keep those walkers off of me.

259
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,100
Oh, gosh.

260
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,300
You have to get him out.

261
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,340
You have to.

262
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,020
Hi.

263
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:23,960
Please.

264
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Please get me out of this.

265
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,920
Okay, I don't know if that's going to work.

266
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,240
Is this going to work?

267
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,980
I might have chosen the wrong option.

268
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,500
Yeah, hurry.

269
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,720
It's changed like that to the Air Force base to lift ornaments.

270
00:23:36,380 --> 00:24:07,920

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,120
buddy.

273
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,520
Oh, my God, again!

274
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,700
I'm doing it!

275
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm doing it!

276
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
Oh, my God!

277
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,980
Oh, my God!

278
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,020
There's so many of them!

279
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,200
Again?

280
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,300
One more.

281
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:36,720
Ah!

282
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,240
Ah!

283
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,750
Come up!

284
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,370
Shit.

285
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,150
You cut David free.

286
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,130
He passed out.

287
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,650
He's about to...

288
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,390
He's about to do way more than that.

289
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,210
Oh my god.

290
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,290
Grab him and let's go.

291
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:57,910
Free.

292
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,830
Oh my gosh.

293
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:00,730
Okay.

294
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,070
Oh my gosh.

295
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,370
Okay, good.

296
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,630
They put a belt on it.

297
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,430
They put a belt on it.

298
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,850
Behind you!

299
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,750
Travis!

300
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,190
Come on, come on.

301
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,890
We gotta move.

302
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:07,570
Travis.

303
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,310
Travis, don't turn around.

304
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,370
Travis, just go.

305
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,250
Oh, Travis.

306
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,790
But your dad was special voices, Travis.

307
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,570
What happened?

308
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,070
Oh, Travis.

309
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,360
Complete chapter one of episode two.

310
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,040
Going hungry.

311
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,540
Oh, Travis.

312
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:53,670
Aw, that guy just lost his friend you guys where's duck oh there he is being a bit of a menace

314
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,260
Oh, I don't like the...

315
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,180
I don't like the...

316
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,060
Oh, stop it, Clementine.

317
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,440
You're scaring me.

318
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,810
Everybody's so on edge.

319
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,270
Get the gates open!

320
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,290
We've got wounded!

321
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,090
Shit.

322
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,910
What the hell are they doing?

323
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,550
Being good people.

324
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,150
What happened?

325
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,750
What's going on?

326
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,710
We don't have time to explain.

327
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,790
Lee, are you okay?

328
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,670
Get him into the truck.

329
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,670
I'll see what I can do.

330
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,310
Oh, my God.

331
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,790
Jesus, Ken.

332
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,050
I don't know.

333
00:26:59,330 --> 00:26:59,350
Wait.

334
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,730
He just got here.

335
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,150
What the hell?

336
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,990
You can't just be bringing new people here.

337
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,190
What are you thinking?

338
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,630
Hey, you want to calm down for a fucking minute?

339
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,970
No, I don't.

340
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,030
I want to know why you thought bringing more mouths to feed was a good idea.

341
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:12,390
Oh.

342
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,970
He would have died if we left him.

343
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,970
So what?

344
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,270
We are not responsible for every struggling survivor we come across.

345
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,170
We have to focus on our group right here right now.

346
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,070
They might have food at their camp, though.

347
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,830
Hang on.

348
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,710
We haven't even talked to these people yet.

349
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,010
Maybe they're not.

350
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:55,210
they can be helpful yeah yeah these are people people trying to survive just like us we've got to stick together to survive yeah the only reason you're here is because you had food enough okay then go start your own group that food is almost gone we've got maybe a week's worth left and i vote lily and larry out no fine you guys fight it out then welcome to the family kid what what but they I'm over here and see what I drew.

351
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:55,870
What the?

352
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,250
What?

353
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,590
No, I...

354
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,870
Just come on, okay?

355
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,090
You like to think you're the leader of this little group, but we can make our own goddamn decisions.

356
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,890
This isn't your own personal dictatorship.

357
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,050
Oh, come on.

358
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,030
You're being dramatic.

359
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,090
Everything always turns into a power struggle between you two.

360
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,630
I'm not going to be a part of that.

361
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,490
Hey, I didn't ask to lead this group.

362
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,630
Everyone was happy to have me distributing the food when there was enough to go around.

363
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,990
But now that it's running out, suddenly I'm a goddamn Nazi.

364
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:26,750
It doesn't matter.

365
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,710
It doesn't matter who's in charge.

366
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,050
Yeah.

367
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,310
Those people are here now.

368
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,930
I guess we just have to decide what happens next.

369
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,010
No, Lee, it does matter.

370
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,910
One person can't be in charge of everything.

371
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,190
You know, it might feel safe for you to sit on the fence.

372
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,630
You tried to stay neutral.

373
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,590
But sooner or later, you're going to have to decide whose side you're on.

374
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,230
Ugh.

375
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,470
Definitely not hers.

376
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,330
I don't see any of you stepping up to make the hard decisions.

377
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,510
My girl's got more balls than all of you combined.

378
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,810
Ew, look at her smiling.

379
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,550
Dad, please.

380
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,990
You go help Mark with the wall.

381
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,570
I'm gonna murder this man.

382
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,650
You think this is easy for me?

383
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,170
Everyone's starting to hate me because I'm the one that rations the food.

384
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,990
But nobody else wants to.

385
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,150
I mean, she's got a point though.

386
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,190
Someone has to do it.

387
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,410
You know what?

388
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,930
I'm not doing it tonight.

389
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,870
You do it.

390
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,210
There's today's food rations, but there's not enough for everyone.

391
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,230
Good luck.

392
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,010
That's it?

393
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,610
Some cheese and crackers?

394
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,470
Yummy.

395
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,270
I hope tomorrow is also cheese and crackers.

396
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,770
You have four items.

397
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,770
Four food items for ten hungry people.

398
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,550
Okay, Larry gets none.

399
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,250
You want me in charge?

400
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,130
Fine.

401
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,690
Be nice to me.

402
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,830
Oh.

403
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,650
Give food to Katya.

404
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,670
Is that how you say her name?

405
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,230
I don't remember.

406
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,290
Let's see how she's doing there.

407
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,810
Is he going to be okay?

408
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,590
I don't know.

409
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,150
Can you give me a hand real quick?

410
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,610
Yeah.

411
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,310
What do you need?

412
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:15,810
Sure.

413
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,630
What do you need?

414
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,050
Just apply some pressure here while I try to close this up.

415
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,450
You know, I thought I was starting to get used to this.

416
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,030
Sewing up people's injuries.

417
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,370
But I mean, cuts and bruises are one thing.

418
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,330
But wait, this man has no leg.

419
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,690
I did that.

420
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,990
It's what your husband wanted.

421
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,650
It's what your husband wanted.

422
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,010
Figures.

423
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,770
I love that man to death, but I swear sometimes he's dumber than a bag of hammers.

424
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,190
I mean, well, what else was I supposed to do?

425
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,050
Thanks for the help.

426
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,430
Go ahead and check in on the others.

427
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,490
I need a little space here anyway.

428
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,890
Oh, I didn't do it.

429
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,430
What's this?

430
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,310
Bookcase.

431
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,810
Steady.

432
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,670
Better snack will hold up forever, just like the rest of this place.

433
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,450
Whoa.

434
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,190
His voice was, like, reverberating through my brain.

435
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,130
Dumpsters.

436
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,990
We dug through those for food a long time ago.

437
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:08,950
Um...

438
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,770
Soup?

439
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,610
We got soup?

440
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,270
Will you hold the damn board steady?

441
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,470
I'm trying.

442
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,810
I didn't realize I was getting this week already.

443
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,890
What do you want?

444
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,570
A handout?

445
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,950
Oh, I got 60 cents in my pocket.

446
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,270
If you'll shut up and quit being such a pansy.

447
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,650
No food for Larry.

448
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,070
This guy is so rude.

449
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,890
It keeps the walkers out.

450
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,730
Carly's been doing the bulk of the lookout duty.

451
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,510
Hello, Mark.

452
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,550
His name is Mark.

453
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,470
You holding up okay, Lee?

454
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,790
That was pretty fucked up back there.

455
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,350
Having to cut that guy's leg off.

456
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,230
It was awesome.

457
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,250
I just hope Kanja can save him.

458
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,230
Oh, hi, Mark.

459
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,130
Oh, want some food?

460
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,990
Gives food.

461
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,990
Ever missed the Air Force Base?

462
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,870
Lily's pretty pissed at us.

463
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,500
Maybe Larry, not Larry, maybe Mark doesn't get food because he missed that bird.

464
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,300
Hmm.

465
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,520
Do you deserve this, Mark?

466
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,000
Do you deserve my cheese and crackers?

467
00:32:47,140 --> 00:33:18,360
we have to be we have to be uh very careful i'll just ask him about the air force base you ever miss the air force base i mean this wall isn't exactly military standard no way i'm going back there you saw what it was like when you guys picked me up completely overrun did you bring food lily's pretty pissed at us pretty pissed at us listen I know her intentions are good,

468
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,800
but...

469
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,620
But nothing!

470
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,780
She's making the smart choice.

471
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,020
Those parasites you guys brought back need to go.

472
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,000
Good Lord!

473
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,260
Could Chat have some cheese and crackers?

474
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,200
Okay, don't tell anybody, but I'm gonna give it all to us instead, okay?

475
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,020
Nobody else is gonna get the cheese and crackers.

476
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,320
It's all us, baby.

477
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,870
I always wonder, though, is it just because it's so difficult to go outside in these types of situations to find food?

478
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:11,070
I mean, I know a lot of stuff is perishable, but just find a vending machine or something.

479
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,610
I don't know.

480
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,010
It can be.

481
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,090
No power.

482
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,050
Just break it open.

483
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,610
No electricity.

484
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:35,910
You have a hammer, you know, to crash it, to smash it.

485
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,340
Nobody to fill the vending machine.

486
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:41,940
What?

487
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,360
No, those fill magically.

488
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,920
Obviously, okay, let's go.

489
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,100
Need any help with the wall?

490
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:48,940
Nope.

491
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,020
Actually, we could use your axe.

492
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,120
Do you mind if we take it?

493
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,200
Don't give it to Larry.

494
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,720
Yeah, give us that thing for a bit.

495
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,840
Give to Mark.

496
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,180
Oh, wait, I actually get to make the decision.

497
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,120
Do you think we could convince Larry to be our friend?

498
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
Or is he a lost cause?

499
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,880
I think he'll kill Mark.

500
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,240
Give to Mark.

501
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
Here, Mark, this should help.

502
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,560
Hey, I'm the one doing all the work over here.

503
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,780
You didn't think to give me the axe?

504
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,240
Come on, Larry.

505
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,120
Give it a rest.

506
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,680
I'm sure Lee is getting pretty sick of you thinking he's a danger to the group.

507
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,580
Is that what you told him?

508
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,600
Um, I mean, I did say that.

509
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah, I'll go up to it.

510
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
What are you going to do about it?

511
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,200
Look, I don't care what it is, but you two have got to start trying to get along.

512
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,060
The only thing I have to do is protect my daughter.

513
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,980
Get out of here.

514
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,620
Why is now that means getting this damn wall fixed?

515
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,100
So I would appreciate it if you two would shut up and let me get back to work.

516
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,120
Why doesn't he just leave then?

517
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,240
Kiss him.

518
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh, his glasses are...

519
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,420
Wait, that's not how you use an axe, Mark.

520
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,800
Mark.

521
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,470
I thought he was gonna, like, chop up more wood to put it on.

522
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,170
I guess if you don't have a hammer, that's so funny.

523
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,150
Let's make Larry even more angry.

524
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,850
I agree.

525
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,490
Lily and Kenny need to get along.

526
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,030
Lily wants to ditch the new people.

527
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,070
He's going to agree with her.

528
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,930
Lily and Kenny need to get along.

529
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,570
You've got to talk to Lily about getting along with Kenny.

530
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,730
Lily can make her own friends.

531
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,630
It's not about making friends.

532
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,130
We're all in this together.

533
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,910
We got to start acting like it.

534
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,230
Yeah.

535
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,650
Stuff all that.

536
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,490
We'd be fine without you.

537
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,270
Okay, never mind.

538
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,370
I don't want to talk to Larry anymore.

539
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,090
Keep up on that fence.

540
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,370
Don't tell me what to do, Lee.

541
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,390
Good Lord.

542
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,290
Let's go give Clementine her food.

543
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,750
At least the kids have something to keep them occupied.

544
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,350
Mark is to axes, but Carly is to batteries.

545
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,870
How you doing, Clementine?

546
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:26,850
Okay.

547
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,130
Where's your hat?

548
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,350
I don't know.

549
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,050
Can you help me find it?

550
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,410
No, you're hot.

551
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:33,810
Sure.

552
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,330
Sure.

553
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:34,810
Yeah.

Oh, you still have that walkie-talkie?

558
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,680
It was the broken one.

559
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,100
That thing doesn't work anymore, does it?

560
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,060
No, not since it broke at the drugstore.

561
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:15,640
Yeah.

562
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,620
Just gonna hold on to it then?

563
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,900
Yeah, if that's okay, I...

564
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,120
Ben is the worst?

565
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,160
You don't like him?

566
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,040
It's okay, Han.

567
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,800
I won't give him food, then.

568
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,640
I don't know him, so.

569
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,420
I know, I did.

570
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,400
And until then...

571
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,100
Look, Clementine.

572
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,780
I'm not stupidly.

573
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,380
I know it's just pretend.

574
00:39:35,380 --> 00:40:27,760

575
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,220
Duck is hungry too.

576
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:29,860
Oh.

577
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,440
Yeah, why don't we get some food?

578
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,160
Oh.

579
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,180
Duck is hungry, huh?

580
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,620
Oh.

581
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,840
Oh.

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,540
I mean, I'm gonna save the jerky for, like, someone that needs, like, some good protein, you know?

583
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,600
Someone that goes outside.

584
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,380
Maybe Kenny.

589

Dick sometimes.

590
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,360
On the other hand, giving that food to Kenny and his family might make him remember you.

591
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,900
She would be like, Minto, do you want a peanut butter lick?

592
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,900
I'd be like, yes, man.

593

00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,920
I can't tell you what to do.

595
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,200
But whatever happens, I know you'll be trying to do the right thing.

596
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:22,980
Thanks, Carly.

597
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,120
Wait, what did you say?

598
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,340
Hi, Minto.

599
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,240
Hi, Reese.

600
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,720
All right.

601
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,740
Never had a squeeze packet.

602
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,870
It's just like jelly.

603
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,660
Squeeze packet.

604
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,120
Of peanut butter?

605
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,620
Did you listen to her?

606
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,740
No.

607
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,000
Back in a bit.

608
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,900
Sorry.

609
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,820
I was too busy thinking about peanut butter.

610
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,340
I'm sorry.

611
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,480
Sorry.

612
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,160
Canny.

613
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:08,810
He's mad at me.

615
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:42,620
I was gonna give it to to our lady friend maybe we only maybe the only people that eat are the ones that are leaving some

616
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,160
of these people have gone longer than me without food They're the ones that need it.

617
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,320
Is the last piece peanut butter flavored?

618
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,960
No, it's cheese crackers.

619
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,000
Which also sounds great, but...

620
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,240
I gotta talk to Lily, too.

621
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,020
How's it going, Lee?

622
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,540
From up here, it looks like you're playing favorites.

623
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,160
Um, ma'am?

624
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,940
I was about to eat...

625
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,760
I should have eaten those damn crackers.

626
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,900
Screw you!

627
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,640
We should think about leaving here.

628
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,680
Let's talk about you and Kenny.

629
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,400
We should talk about you and Kenny.

630
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,740
What about us?

631
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,440
Rude!

632
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,000
It's getting pretty out of hand.

633
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,560
You know people notice that.

634
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,000
You're rude.

635
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,840
Look, I'm working my ass off to make sure we have a good setup here, and Kenny just doesn't appreciate that.

636
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,460
All we need is food.

637
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,340
That's true.

638
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,520
But there is no food.

639
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:42,960
Start a garden!

640
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,580
You know that better than anyone.

641
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Well, we'll just have to find some.

642
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,060
Start foraging.

643
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,640
Make sure Mark doesn't miss the shot.

644
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,480
Oh, we should think about leaving here.

645
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,220
I wonder if she will.

646
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,720
Maybe we should think about leaving the motel.

647
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,100
God, not you too.

648
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,080
I know Kenny wants to leave.

649
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,940
I think that's why he's so eager to get the RV working.

650
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,060
But this is a good spot.

651
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,100
We're protected.

652
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,700
We're close to the drugstore.

653
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,960
We have a routine now and it's working.

654
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,300
For now.

655
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,480
I trust in Kenny.

656
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,440
Me too.

657
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,760
Me too.

658
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,200
Yeah, you can't really grow a garden in the parking lot.

659
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,700
That's why you need to leave.

660
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,060
Keep an eye out.

661
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,660
Fine.

662
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,600
Who should I give the last...

663
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
We should have, like, a...

664
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,720
A talent show.

665
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,680
Winner gets crackers.

666
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,280
He looks so suspicious.

667
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,660
When he's, like, he's, like, side-eyeing.

668
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,000
Um...

669
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,940
Yeah, we'll give it to our lady friend.

670
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,520
Carly can't shoot.

671
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,300
That's so true.

672
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,000
Carly, I give the food to you.

673
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,800
Want something to eat?

674
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,020
Give crackers and cheese.

675
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:02,620
Here.

676
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:03,740
Me?

677
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,080
How about you?

678
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,580
You look like crap, Lee.

679
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,420
When was the last time you ate?

680
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,380
I'm okay.

681
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,180
I want you to have this, okay?

682
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,820
In case you or Clementine starts feeling weak.

683
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,440
Oh!

684
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,260
I know I said it didn't matter why you saved me instead of Doug, but...

685
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:19,880
You don't know me.

686
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:52,170

Fine!

691

Don't eat!

692
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,740
That's that scene in Beauty and the Beast.

693
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,400
Then go ahead and starve!

694
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,280
Bitch!

695
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,320
Fuck off!

696
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,240
I'm eating this for myself!

697
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,400
Can I eat the crackers now?

698
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,470
What about Ben?

699
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,730
I don't know that guy either.

700
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:38,670
Okay, Mark.

701
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,930
It's your lucky day.

702
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,410
Give it to Clem.

703
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,430
We already gave her some.

704
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,070
I don't think it'll let us give a second one.

705
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,020
Here, eat something.

706
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,980
Yeah, there's crackers and cheese.

707
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,000
Thanks, Lee.

708
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,960
There we go.

709
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,400
All gone!

710
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,360
Right in front of Larry.

711
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,360
Yeah, you should...

712
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,460
Yeah, yeah, you should feel bad.

713
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,640
Not such an easy job, is it?

714
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,180
Never said it was.

715
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,420
What?

716
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,040
I don't envy you.

717
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,740
I don't know how you have the strength to do this every day.

718
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,300
I don't have a choice.

719
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,240
Larry must...

720
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:17,640
buffer.

721
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,800
Hey, thanks for looking out for me and my family.

722
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,340
I'm serious about that offer to come with us.

723
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,920
You've more than earned a ride on the RV with me.

724
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,520
Still, I guess some people aren't going to be happy with your choices.

725
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,820
You're out!

726
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,040
What happened to my food?

727
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,960
There's none left.

728
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,080
You keep treating people like this, and your days in this group are numbered.

729
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,080
You're one to talk, old man.

730
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,440
Yeah, well, I don't see you working on that wall.

731
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,980
He was out.

732
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:54,880
side-working That's why he gets to take a rest Ken Lee come here, please.

733
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,280
Oh my god.

734
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,800
He didn't make it did he?

735
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,740
Oh He lost too much blood.

736
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,840
Oh god.

737
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,320

00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,400
I'm getting sick of this shit Ken come back.

739
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,060
There's nothing.

00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,760
Uh, I'm sick of this shit, too.

741
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,960
I'm sick of this shit, too You don't think I am?

742
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,220
Maybe it's for the best.

743
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:23,320
Yeah, we're already struggling to feed our own kids That man you brought, I tried, but he was never going to survive.

744
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,200
It's okay, it's not your fault.

745
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,660
I'm not a problem anymore.

746
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,340
Damn.

747
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,900

748
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:29,620
Eww.

749
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:34,840

754
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:46,460

Oh my god, Mark!

758
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,280

I don't know.

767
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,040
It's not the bite that does it.

768
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,720
You come back no matter how you die.

769
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,660
If you don't destroy the brain, that's just what happens.

770
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,180
Whoa.

771
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,820
It's going to happen to all of us.

772
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,480
What?

773
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,460
What?

774
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,760
We're all infected?

775
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,380
We're all infected.

776
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:14,660
Everyone?

777
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,700
I guess so.

778
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,700
Is this actually real?

779
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,700
I, all I know is that I've seen people turn who I know were never bitten.

780
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,420
When I first saw it happen.

781
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,060
We were all hiding out in a gym and everybody thought we were finally safe.

782
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,660
Oh my god.

783
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,640
One of the girls Jenny pitcher, I think Jenny pitcher.

784
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,380
She took some pills.

785
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,760
A lot of them.

786
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,880
Oh Someone went in the girls's room the next morning.

787
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:49,040
I definitely missed us in the TV show Back off Whoa lady relax me and my brother.

788
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,360
We we just want to know if y'all can help us out.

789
00:54:51,540 --> 00:55:26,420
I said back off Carly uh are you are you armed are you armed yeah for protection that was a dumb question that could be anywhere but uh i think you got the upper hand here why do you need gas our place is protected by an electric fence generators provide the electricity our generators run on gas we own a dairy farm a few miles up the road y'all be willing to lower your guns we can talk about How y'all doing on food?

790
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,080
We got plenty at the dairy.

791
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,940
I don't trust him.

792
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,480
I don't trust him.

793
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,340
Lee, why don't you and Mark check the place out?

794
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,180
See if it's legit.

795
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,700
I'm going with you.

796
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,600
Yeah, please.

797
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,220
Don't leave me alone with Mark.

798
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,080
Wait.

799
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,440
What do y'all think?

800
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,680
Don't leave me alone with Mark.

801
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,360
Is this a trap?

802
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,280
We'll go for the content.

803
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,620
You've got a deal.

804
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,400
We'll bring some gas to you.

805
00:55:54,420 --> 00:56:26,220
everyone should go wait what do you mean some food to bring back see how it goes from there decided everyone should go i didn't decide a couple gallons should power one of our generator i didn't decide this so this dairy you guys really have food sure do we lost most of the cattle but we still have lots of milk butter and cheese stock oh my god there's ben and with the vegetables we grow we got plenty of food it's nice to get away from that motel for a while this lily can Anything is starting to get ridiculous.

806
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:26,900
I agree.

807
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,380
Personally, I'd be happier if you started to take charge more.

808
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,900
Me as a leader?

809
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,960
You think they'd want me for a leader?

810
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,660
Sure.

811
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,300
Everybody looks up to you.

812
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:37,780
Really?

813
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,900
Not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.

814
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,640
Because of your past.

815
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,560
Does anyone else know?

816
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,680
Larry knows.

817
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,020
Larry knows.

818
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:47,660
Great.

819
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,800
That can't be easy.

820
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,800
Clementine might know.

821
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,100
Oh yeah, she does know.

822
00:56:52,100 --> 00:57:23,240
does know talking in the drugstore and ask me about his marksmanship sucks yeah what exactly did happen with the senator uh now is not the time now it's not the time well i'm here whenever you want to talk sometimes i wonder if i should talk to the group about it you don't have to whatever happened before things went to hell doesn't matter anymore i mean not sure everyone would see it that way maybe you're right but like it's also a judge of his character i've reported on some pretty messed up shit.

823
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,080
I've seen situations like yours a hundred times.

824
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,480
It doesn't have to make you a bad man.

825
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,400
I, uh, really appreciate that.

826
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:33,940
Like, I get it.

827
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:38,900
I get your viewpoint, but at the same time, it's just like, oh, just because someone was a serial killer.

828
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,100
Before things... Before things happen, doesn't mean that they're not going to be a serial killer now.

829
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,480
Uh, I grew up in...

830
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,180
I grew up in Macon.

831
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,040
Right here in the heart of Georgia.

832
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,560
That's what I like to hear.

833
00:57:50,760 --> 00:58:22,960
Y'all seem that motor in who's running things over there it's a democracy oh me I am you guys have any questions you come to me how many people you got over there anyway change the subject well the kid here's our newest arrival but we're all looking forward to some food we really need it well here's to helping each other I'm not gonna tell you how many people we have get you all out to the Like I said,

834
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,020
we got plenty of food.

835
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,160
Quite frankly, we could always use an extra help in hand.

836
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,820
In the summers, I used to help out on a goat farm.

837
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,060
Yeah, that's great.

838
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,280
Everything helps.

839
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,760
Mama's been running the dairy for as long as I can remember, but now it's...

840
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,460
You think you're going to cut me out of this?

841
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,560
Shit, get down.

842
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,600
No one's trying to cut you out of anything.

843
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,580
You and Carrie are always pulling this shit.

844
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:47,720
Who?

845
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,500
Those look like the people who raided my camp.

846
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,000
Who are they?

847
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:52,840
Fuck you!

848
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,260
You knew we were hungry, and you guys were keeping it off of yourselves.

849
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,200
Oh, no.

850
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,600
There's a lot more.

851
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,280
We ate it all.

852
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,120
What are you gonna fucking do about it?

853
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:01,740
Don't worry.

854
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,600
Danny and I got you covered if something happens.

855
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,260
Oh, yeah?

856
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,280
Let's just wait this out.

857
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,360
I don't think you do.

858
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,240
Fuck you!

859
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,600
Oh!

860
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,260
Fuck you!

861
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,660
Fuck you!

862
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,140
Jesus!

863
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,500
Asshole!

864
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,000
Oh!

865
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,480
Me to Larry.

866
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,200
Come on.

867
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:23,800
Holy hell.

868
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,860
Let's get to the dairy where it's safe.

869
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,820
He shot him in the brain, right?

870
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,060
He's not going to turn.

871
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,200
Waste of ammo.

872
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:41,780
Yeah, and it also sound like you're going to attract them.

873
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,580
Here it is.

874
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,800
Wait, they do have a farm.

875
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,560
St. John's Family Dairy.

876
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,980
Five, five, five.

877
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,300
And y'all can see how he kept this place so safe.

878
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,200
For all yours.

879
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:06,440
keeps them out they are you betcha they fry like bugs and a zapper we're pushing 4,000 boats through that thing with generators and amps I'm going to assume that's a lot

880
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:31,260
we can't have the kids around the fence oh I like it this is a really brilliant setup suits us just fine this place looks untouched you never know the rest of the world is in ruins it's worth protecting hence all the I thought I saw y'all with company coming down the drive.

881
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,100
Are they cannibals?

882
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:32,900
This is our mama.

883
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,620
I'm Brenda St. John and welcome to the St. John Dairy.

884
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,800
This here's Lee.

885
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,940
He's from Macon.

886
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,980
A couple of our old farm hands were from Macon.

887
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,700
They grow them good there.

888
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,800
They got a few more friends staying at the old motel.

889
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,540
Are they cannibals?

890
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,480
Oh my goodness, that place is pretty vulnerable.

891
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,180
Have you got someone with survival experience to lead your group?

892
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,880
We work together.

893
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,840
We all work together.

894
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,180
Plus, we've got plenty of people with military experience.

895
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,860
Well, that's good to hear.

896
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,320
That motel ain't the safest place.

897
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,320
Hold on, I thought you said someone else was running things.

898
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,720
Oh yeah, I thought she was asking about survival tactics.

899
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,420
Oh yeah.

900
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,320
Well, it don't matter.

901
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,420
You're here now.

902
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,620
We'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.

903
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,380
Are you cannibals?

904
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,040
Does that offer?

905
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,060
Does that offer apply to the rest of us?

906
01:01:25,060 --> 01:02:26,980
we're all incredibly hungry these are far y'all bake fresh this morning amazing can't get stuff like that anymore not without a cow for milk and butter that's for sure that's right hopefully maybell will make it through this bout of whatever she's got and be with us for a good long while you guys we have a vet we could bring her here we can help you folks out oh a vet oh my our prayers group could come for the day well how about this y'all go get your veterinary friend and I'll prepare some dinner a big feast for all you hungry souls it'll be nice to have some folks to help out around here again Danny why don't you come help me out in the kitchen why don't I head back with the food and round up everyone for the trip over here I'd want to take someone with you remember those roads can be dangerous I can handle myself take this Why don't you go ahead and take Ben along anyway?

907
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,180
Take care of yourself, Lee.

908
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,460
See you in a while.

909
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,140
We don't know Ben.

910
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,060
Oh, the foreshadowing is...

911
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,280
That little linger on the fence?

912
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,860
I could use some help securing the perimeter.

913
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,320
I don't know if I like that.

914
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:46,340
Sometimes the dead get tangled up in the fence before they fry and end up knocking over a post.

915
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,200
It'd be a big help if you could walk the perimeter.

916
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,460
You can learn a little something about our fence.

917
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,480
I'm going to go top off the generators before they run dry.

918
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:47,580
give me when you're ready you betcha this place is incredible it's got food and that fence oh man stop talking about the fence you're scared our cards right this might turn out to be a place we can stay so how do you want to play this I think they're pushing people onto the fence and then once they get nice and crispy they're let's make sure the place is safe before we can think about bringing our whole group here to stay we need to figure out if this place is as safe as they're telling us yeah right obviously they think it's safe but is it safe enough for the kids I noticed a broken swing over there not a big deal but maybe there's other things not working that we just can't see and checking the fence perimeter sounds like a decent way to get a good look at the fences all right I'll keep my eyes open and you find out what you can from Andy well you can't see it but it actually says st.

919
01:03:47,660 --> 01:04:21,020
John Donner party I don't trust these people at all I don't trust them one bit what's that pointy why don't you say that look at the boy but they go through a lot of wood keeping those fences repaired saw if a couple of tools out in the open is as unsafe as it gets we'll be fine here would have been nice to have one of these back at the motor in.

920
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,620
You had an axe.

921
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:28,080
And some people, some people don't know how to use it.

922
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,860
Looks like the fence runs around the entire property, not just the house.

923
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,860
Don't even think about licking it.

924
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,780
Can't take any chances when it comes to safety.

925
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,630
Why are you so focused on cannibalism?

926
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:45,870
Is that what happened to your body?

927
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,470
Well, they're just, they're just so confident.

928
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,530
Wait, if I get close to it, can I die?

929
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,390
They're just so confident about not being hungry.

930
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,290
Where's the cow?

931
01:04:58,490 --> 01:04:59,330
Okay, so they definitely...

932
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:01,790
They do have corn, it looks like, over there.

933
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,390
And what's up with this broken swing, huh?

934
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:10,210
They had a kid that they ate?

935
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:12,470
Too bad it's broken.

936
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,850
I'll bet Clementine and Duck would have loved something like this to play.

937
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:16,810
I don't think we should...

938
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,970
Kids used to like that old swing even more than the tour sometimes.

939
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,110
I don't think we should have them swinging by a...

940
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,710
4,000-volt fence.

941
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:25,670
How did it break?

942
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:26,490
How did it break?

943
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:30,070
Got busted the first day those things showed up.

944
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,470
Thank God no one was on it at the time.

945
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:35,890
Looks like it just needs a new board for the sea.

946
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:36,770
Some rope.

947
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,430
Make it safe for Clem and Duck.

948
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:41,110
And let the St. John's know we can pull our weight around.

949
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,170
Cannibalism core family.

950
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,410
It's true, it's true, it's true.

951
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,510
I think they're cannibals.

952
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:50,950
I think they're cannibals.

953
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:52,110
Well, you know...

954
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,810
I'm fine with being a cannibal.

955
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,730
Give me that sweet, sweet brain amoeba.

956
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:08,590
You know, what's it called when you eat people and you get that thing in your brain that's basically equivalent to mad cow disease?

957
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:14,840
Pryons.

958
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,840
Yeah, give me the prions.

959
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,320
Oh, we're just going inside.

960
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,280
Oh, they have awards now.

961
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,640
This dairy won a lot of ribbons in its day, huh?

962
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,880
Where's the cow?

963
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,740
This place was my daddy's life.

964
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,300
Where's the cow?

965
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,400
It meant everything to him.

966
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,040
Where's the cow?

967
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,520
You know, when he first bought this place, it was a single-story house.

968
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,860
Is that right?

969
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,660
After us kids was born, he insisted on adding a second floor.

970
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,900
He said they had to have room for as many babies as they could have.

971
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,700
Mama, she was done after Dan.

972
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,060
My folks stopped after two as well.

973
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,780
Then one day, the world changed.

974
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,380
Now this place is all we have left of daddy.

975
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,000
That's why we take such good care of it, and why we want to share it with good folks like yourselves.

976
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,540
St. John's, Johnner Party.

977
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,460
Ooh, fresh herbs.

978
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,180
I can hardly wait for dinner.

979
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,760
So relaxing.

980
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,700
Used to have these on the front porch of my house growing up.

981
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,420
The noise doesn't attract any unwanted guests.

982
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,360
That's what I'm saying.

983
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,120
Can I just go inside?

984
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Hello?

985
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,200
Hello?

986
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,480
She says, oh, hi there, Lee.

987
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:39,940
Dinner.

988
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:40,920
What can I do for you?

989
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,620
Dinner's here.

990
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,040
I mean, dinner's ready.

991
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,480
I think with Danny's help, I've got things pretty well squared away in the kitchen.

992
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,500
But feel free to check with Andy.

993
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:54,340
He's got a lot of weight on his shoulders these days, so I'm sure he'd love any help he can do.

994
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,580
How many rooms in this house?

995
01:07:58,820 --> 01:07:59,740
When will dinner be ready?

996
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,500
Dinner will be ready as soon as everybody's here.

997
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:10,980
When will dinner be ready?

998
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,020
It'll be a while still, but it'd be worth it.

999
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,060
Trust me.

1000
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,220
A while?

1001
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,880
About the length that it takes to get to the motel and back?

1002
01:08:25,920 --> 01:09:28,780
your family's done an amazing job of keeping this place up well now aren't you sweet thank you lou the boys and i have tried to adapt as best we can but we still keep some of our old routines to help remind us of better times like eating did you always eat people what happened to your staff oh they ate dinner what happened to the rest of your staff oh we've had our share of tragedy here just like everyone else i'm sure some of our staff took off to find their family as soon as they heard the news the few that stuck around well we lost show me your beds yeah things showed up here it was a tough night i like how she's it cut from her being all sad to to smiling smiling also dairy of the year 1993 when does this take place when does the what is the timeline here How many rooms does this house have?

1003
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:29,540
Rooms?

1004
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,040
Why do you add?

1005
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,000
1991.

1006
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,040
Uh, just curious?

1007
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,460
Oh, uh, just curious, I guess.

1008
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,240
Phil, welcome back to theCUBE.

1009
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,920
Let's not start thinking too far ahead.

1010
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,040
Welcome to membership, thank you.

1011
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,180
Let's just focus on getting y'all a good home-cooked meal tonight.

1012
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,500
Well, if anything comes up that I can help with, feel free to let me know.

1013
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,920
Well, Lee, I sure appreciate it.

1014
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:50,800
No problem.

1015
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,100
She will remember that.

1016
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:01,070
Oh, okay.

1017
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,870
Let's go talk to Mark here.

1018
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:08,810
Okay, I don't really like Mark.

1019
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:10,910
I miss Doug.

1020
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,030
So what have you found out?

1021
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,750
Is this looking like a good place to stay?

1022
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,930
That fence is no joke.

1023
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:18,890
The fence is no joke.

1024
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:20,370
At least around the house.

1025
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,470
I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of you.

1026
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:23,710
I'll keep looking around.

1027
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,530
All right, keep me posted.

1028
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:35,510
I wouldn't be having my hand on the post even like it's I think I would stay far far away.

1029
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:36,770
Oh, what's this?

1030
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:41,630
Outlet you can definitely tell they built this thing themselves

1031
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:52,220
I can use the gate hey, what are you fixing to do around the barn?

1032
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,080
Just trying to help out just trying to find more ways to help out.

1033
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,220
Yeah, well, I I appreciate that.

1034
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:06,380
Tell you what, we'll find you something to do over there after we get back from securing the perimeter.

1035
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,560
Sounds good.

1036
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,160
Where's your cow?

1037
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,920
I haven't heard a single moo.

1038
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,860
What's that?

1039
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:18,920
Generator.

1040
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,320
You guys come along with gas just in time.

1041
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,620
Hey, uh, don't mess with that, okay?

1042
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:30,960
The thing's a little tricky and I don't want to spend half a day trying to fix it again.

1043
01:11:32,680 --> 01:12:32,780
this is like a lot of maintenance you know like you would have to always be getting gas sus so sus very sus hi hi I'm glad you guys decided to help us out I noticed back in the motel that you folks are pretty well armed been stockpiling huh how many weapons do you have no one fuck yeah anyone tries to fuck with us they'll regret it well protecting your people is important but my experience having that many guns around is when people get dangerous are we your first guests we can't be the first people you've invited up to the dairy well no we've made similar deals with other folks trading for gas and food but ultimately they moved on looking for the people they lost contact with You found out the other survivors.

1044
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,660
The other survivors have stayed at the farm.

1045
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,860
Yeah, they were delicious.

1046
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,980
Yeah, we traded their bodies for food.

1047
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,260
The fence stops the walkers?

1048
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,560
An electric fence is enough to keep out walkers?

1049
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:46,640
Walkers?

1050
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,340
Is that what you call them?

1051
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,280
That's good.

1052
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:55,420
The old one wouldn't have, but Mac, he was our foreman, he figured out how to amp it up with the generators.

1053
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:00,240
We used to sit out here some nights and watch the sons of bitches sizzling pop when they got too close.

1054
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:29,260
closest thing to entertainment these days i guess these generators are enough to power the whole dairy we got lots and gotta keep trading for fuel as much as we can but they all work together to do the trick you know like us mark and i can help you with that perimeter now oh good here we go fence will stop a walker in about three or four seconds but gets overloaded if we leave the husks out there you know mark and i can clear the fence ourselves if you want to stay here and finish up with the generators.

1055
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,980
Well, that'd be great.

1056
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:31,680
I'm scared.

1057
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:38,020
I'll turn off the northwest section, and if you guys could strip them off and look for any weak points, well, that'd be a big help.

1058
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:38,980
I'm scared.

1059
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,760
Stay attentive.

1060
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,120
We never know.

1061
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,140
Oh, wow.

1062
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,680
Wow, that's a huge perimeter.

1063
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,040
Holy moly.

1064
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,100
Is it safe enough for us to stay?

1065
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,220
If we can?

1066
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,500
It's pretty amazing what they've done with this dairy, but...

1067
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,980
Let's see what it takes to secure this fence before drawing any conclusions.

1068
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,380
I can't wait until everyone's out here.

1069
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,880
Everyone besides Larry.

1070
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:14,160
What's up with you telling him what I said about him thinking I'm dangerous?

1071
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,540
Look, you said it.

1072
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,460
You even admitted it right to him.

1073
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,480
Well, I try to be civil.

1074
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,640
I try to be civil at least.

1075
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,100
He's too busy being cranky to notice.

1076
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,180
Ew!

1077
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:27,480
There's one.

1078
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,000
Is that thing dead?

1079
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,000
Are we sure?

1080
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:31,680
Ugh.

1081
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,000
Are we 100% sure that thing's dead?

1082
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,300
Lee, it's dead.

1083
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,940
I'm trying to be careful.

1084
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,120
Andy said, when this fence is working, the walkers go up like a tree branch on a power line.

1085
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,760
If those lights are out, that means the fence is off, right?

1086
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:49,820
It better be.

1087
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,160
Who do you think he was?

1088
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,340
I don't care.

1089
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,400
It doesn't matter.

1090
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,100
It doesn't matter.

1091
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,920
Maybe the St. John boys are using this guy for target practice?

1092
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,700
Ah, poor guy.

1093
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,420
I don't know what got him first, the arrow or the fence.

1094
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,800
Either way, hope he was already dead.

1095
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,660
Push the zombie.

1096
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,720
Looks like he's stuck.

1097
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:20,300
Oh, no!

1098
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,720
Push the zombie.

1099
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,800
Push him again.

1100
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,740
Looks like he's stuck.

1101
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:29,940
Uh...

1102
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,200
I have two prompts.

1103
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,260
Pull the arrow out.

1104
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,020
Oh, yeah, oh, because he's stuck from the arrow.

1105
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:36,440
I think.

1106
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,060
Disgusting.

1107
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,320
Push the zombie.

1108
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,920
Ooh, it's hot.

1109
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,160
I'm sure there's still a few more.

1110
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,640
I don't know if I was walking that or not.

1111
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,160
Once this fence is patched up, this place will be a fortress.

1112
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,800
God, can you imagine not having to worry about the walkers anymore?

1113
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,680
A fortress needs people to...

1114
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,960
Yeah, it's useless without gas.

1115
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,140
Well, it's useless without gas.

1116
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,660
We might need food, but the St. John's need gas, too.

1117
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,640
Not many drivers these days, Lee.

1118
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,100
We could scrounge up a year's worth of gas.

1119
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:12,520
Easy.

1120
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,100
So what's your take on the brothers?

1121
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,640
They seem to have this place tied down pretty well.

1122
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:21,410
What do you...

1123
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,870
They're delaying the inevitable.

1124
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:23,830
What do you mean by that?

1125
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:24,630
I don't know.

1126
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:26,070
They seem decent enough.

1127
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:26,510
We don't know.

1128
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:29,330
I just want you to know that I've got your back if anything goes down.

1129
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,490
Well, where's the cow?

1130
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,290
There's another one.

1131
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,510
I see it.

1132
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,730
Oh, my gosh.

1133
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:39,270
This one dead.

1134
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,610
Is this one dead?

1135
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,030
Is this one dead?

1136
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:45,370
Uh...

1137
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,110
Let go!

1138
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,550
Man, the fence burned right into its hands.

1139
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,410
Think they fused together?

1140
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:55,690
Dead, dead.

1141
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:57,650
Oh, okay.

1142
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,890
Think they fused together.

1143
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:02,770
Eww.

1144
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,350
Chop.

1145
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:04,270
Chop, chop!

1146
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,810
Chop, chop, chop.

1147
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:11,730
You never get used to the smell, do you?

1148
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:13,490
Nope.

1149
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,730
Oh, we're just gonna leave the hands?

1150
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:17,050
Christ.

1151
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,350
I can't stop thinking about dinner.

1152
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,530
It's you, buddy.

1153
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,250
Thanks for the rations earlier.

1154
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:27,790
It's not easy eating in front of the kids, but it's all that's keeping me on my feet right now.

1155
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,750
I can't have them food, too.

1156
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,550
Uh, we'll go ask for more to eat after.

1157
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:33,370
Focus on the task.

1158
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,030
Just try to focus on the task.

1159
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:53,850
They knew what they were doing, teasing us food and then giving us chores having a good meal will be worth it oh my gosh this guy really took out I think I see where they're getting in this one must have knocked it over trying to get through he's tangled up in there pretty good come on help me get this thing back in place so we can get mr.

1160

1164
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,480
Uh, if I look up...

1165
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,660
Oh wait, oh...

1166
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:13,720
Oh, I didn't get to the sea!

1167
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,580
Oh no!

1168
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,840
I push it?

1169
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,800
What about all the arrangements?

1170
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:20,840
Push it?

1171
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,320
No?

1172
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,440
Doesn't work?

1173
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,420
Wait, what was that?

1174
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,280
Hey, let's talk this out!

1175
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:32,010
Oh no, they know!

1176
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,050
They knew we're here!

1177
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:35,650
Oh, wait!

1178
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,050
Pull that.

1179
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:39,770
Maybe.

1180
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:40,790
Ow!

1181
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,790
You didn't deliver the goods!

1182
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:44,790
The goods?

1183
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,290
Okay, it should move now, no?

1184
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:51,730
Okay, I thought it was like stuck in the ground.

1185
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,790
I already got one of you!

1186
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,110
You fuck with us!

1187
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,310
Can I do anything on the tractor?

1188
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:00,370
Oh, here we go.

1189
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:02,450
Of course.

1190
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,550
Of course.

1191
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:07,530
Uh...

1192
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:09,950
It doesn't have a gear though.

1193
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,740
Oh, oh, go do it.

1194
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,490
Oh, that was close.

1195
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,650
Is there anything else over here?

1196
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,450
Ah, fuck you, asshole.

1197
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:26,590
I already got one of you.

1198
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,070
I already got one.

1199
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:28,790
Oh, this thing.

1200
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:29,530
I just saw it.

1201
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,290
There we go.

1202
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:31,910
Come on.

1203
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:35,310
If we can reach the gate, we can get through this fence and back to the house.

1204
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,030
Shit.

1205
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:44,830
Oh,

1206
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,770
no, it's gonna run over the zombie.

1207
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,890
What happened?

1208
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,570
It's one of the dead we pushed down earlier.

1209
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:58,150
I'm gonna have to move it.

1210
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,730
What about our arrangement?

1211
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,490
Don't think I can't see you.

1212
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,510
Oh, baby, I can't see you.

1213
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,430
Okay, keep going.

1214
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:08,730
Easy peasy.

1215
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:13,550
Easy peasy.

1216
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:14,650
Oh my gosh, another body.

1217
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:17,470
Another one?

1218
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:19,670
How many of those things did we push down?

1219
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,150
Not that many.

1220
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:25,730
No, you don't.

1221
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:26,550
You don't see me.

1222
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:32,050
Oh my gosh, why is he still alive?

1223
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,430
Why is he still alive?

1224
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:35,970
Hey, chill out.

1225
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:37,090
Oh my gosh.

1226
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,680
Holy hell.

1227
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,710
You okay?

1228
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:46,450
Yeah.

1229
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:47,710
Barely.

1230
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:48,950
Come on.

1231
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:51,010
Oh my god, he's coming after us!

1232
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,010
That's crazy.

1233
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,130
Oh my god!

1234
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,000
That's so cool.

1235
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,610
Let's get out of here.

1236
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,060
Wait, I think you should close that.

1237
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,840
I think you should have closed that.

1238
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,120
No?

1239
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:17,740
Okay.

1240
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,510
Lee, what's wrong?

1241
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:28,650
It was an ambush.

1242
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:31,110
There was a goddamn ambush out there.

1243
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,750
Holy shit, are you okay?

1244
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:34,850
Bandits here?

1245
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:35,950
On our property.

1246
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:36,870
They could just follow me.

1247
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,770
Oh my lord, what happened to you, sweetheart?

1248
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,750
What's those bastards in the woods, Mama?

1249
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:42,730
Yeah, I'll be alright once it's out.

1250
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:44,370
God damn, it hurts.

1251
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,970
Hey, y'all.

1252
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:46,790
Uh-huh.

1253
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,070
Oh my god.

1254
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:48,730
What happened?

1255
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:49,830
He got trapped with an arrow.

1256
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:50,430
Christ!

1257
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,510
Are you gonna be okay?

1258
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:52,990
Yeah, I'm fine.

1259
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,690
I should just pull it out.

1260
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:56,650
Oh no, honey.

1261
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:57,310
Come on.

1262
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,250
Brenda's got you.

1263
01:22:58,350 --> 01:22:59,350
Oh no, no, Brenda.

1264
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,170
We'll have you all sorted out.

1265
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,270
Brenda's like, oh yeah, he's already skewered.

1266
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,670
What kind of shit is this?

1267
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:06,870
We ran into some people on the way up here.

1268
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:08,090
Bandits, I guess.

1269
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,930
I think it was them that attacked us.

1270
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:11,630
They gave us a lot of problems in the beginning.

1271
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:12,690
He's already on them.

1272
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:13,130
He's already on them.

1273
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:16,230
We were able to get them to stop by making a deal.

1274
01:23:16,790 --> 01:24:19,910
these people he's already a little protection not like we had much of a choice but they did stop hassling us god damn it Carly said this place was locked down tight so much for your understanding for your deal those shitheads broke the agreement look I'm sorry Lee if I had any inkling they were gonna give you guys trouble well we would have gone out there with you listen we may have had an agreement with those people but we will not stand for this shit ain't no we're gonna let those sons of bitches get away with this you know where these assholes are they're hard to pin down but I think I know where at least one of their camps are when you're ready to go scope out yeah but the power right pandits are you serious this place isn't safe we can't stay here not safe this place is a hell of a lot safer than that motor in I think all of us in our guns can handle a couple of punks with bows and arrows what we need to do is here to stay take this place over if we have to oh cool your jets there

1275
01:24:19,910 --> 01:25:12,250

the fence is like right there It's like, oh my god, oh, oh my god, oh my god.

1277
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:25,800
Wait, no, no.

1278
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,080
Oh, no, I'm trying to watch them.

1279
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:31,960
They look happy.

1280
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,120
His expression.

1281
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,460
Hey, Clam, do you like the swing?

1282
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,340
Yeah, it's fun.

1283
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,140
Be sure to tell Andy, thank you, okay?

1284
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,080
I will.

1285
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,660
Will you push me on it?

1286
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:46,880
Maybe later.

1287
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,760
Maybe later, okay?

1288
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:49,340
Oh, okay.

1289
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:49,740
Oh, sorry.

1290
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,560
Sorry, Clem.

1291
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,820
What do you think of the dairy?

1292
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:53,700
What do you think of the dairy?

1293
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,760
It's pretty.

1294
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,080
It reminds me of how things used to look before.

1295
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,420
Yeah, it does.

1296
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,560
Do you think things will ever get back to how they were?

1297
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,420
I made her sad.

1298
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,120
I'm sorry.

1299
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,100
I'm not sure.

1300
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,180
I'm not sure, Clem.

1301
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:08,040
We'll be honest with her.

1302
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:08,820
She's...

1303
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:09,540
I hope so too.

1304
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,340
She's a big girl.

1305
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,860
How are you doing?

1306
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,020
How you holding up, Clementine?

1307
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,560
I'm okay, I guess.

1308
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,780
Are you okay?

1309
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:16,640
Yeah.

1310
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,760
I'm just a little worried about Mark.

1311
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,300
Are we?

1312
01:26:19,760 --> 01:27:30,780
going to be okay get lucky out there it'll be a lot worse are you going to find the people who hurt mark yeah we have to make sure they don't hurt anyone else yeah be careful i want you to remember that ever since i met you i've had good luck so don't worry okay lucky guy don't worry we're safe here now as long as the bad people don't feel like i should right i won't let what happened to mark happen to you the word totally safe like you know i promise i've got some things to take be back in a bit okay yeah I'm new to parenting please trying to talk to Keen oh my god why are we going closer to the fence hey hey Lee found anything interesting I'm just trying to make sure this place is secure in case we decide to make this a more long-term solution let Clementine have a chance seems pretty safe good to know keep your ears open for anything else might help us how are you holding up how you holding up I hope they feed us Lee soon on the way over here I was getting dizzy hands shaking cold

1313
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:57,110
sweats I thought I was gonna pass out they've got food here yeah but I'm not just talking about one meal you know I guess Lily isn't too thrilled about being here I could give two shits about what Lily wants duck and Kacha need food I'm not about to sit around that motor in and watch him go hungry mom's you're with me on this right

1314
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:19,310
uh yeah of course yeah of course Lily's judgment is clouded but you got a pretty clear head about this we're on Kenny's side did duck and Kacha get here okay now it wasn't easy duck didn't look so good on the walk over to this I gave duck half an apple everything works out maybe he and Kacha can have an easier life here.

1315
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,230
I hope you're right.

1316
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:24,750
Duck and Clementine deserve a better life than starving to death at some crappy motel.

1317
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:25,390
So true.

1318
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:29,030
Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp.

1319
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:35,370
It'd be a good opportunity to find out a bit more about the St. John's and their relationship with those bandits or whatever.

1320
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:35,970
I agree.

1321
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:36,310
Right.

1322
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,390
I'll see what I can find out.

1323
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:52,010
Are these all the same as before?

1324
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:53,790
I wonder.

1325
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:55,110
Dang it, Doug.

1326
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,610
Let Clementine have a turn on the electric fence.

1327
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:00,190
Yeah!

1328
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,890
They're storing gasoline all over the property.

1329
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:08,810
Can I go here yet?

1330
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,100
Oh, who that, Larry?

1331
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:23,430
We're going into the barn.

1332
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:30,570
If there's not enough room in the house for all of us, I guess a few of us could camp out here in ships.

1333
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,250
Go in.

1334
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:33,810
Go inside.

1335
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,730
If there's not enough room in the house for all of us.

1336
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,610
I guess a few of us could camp out here in shifts.

1337
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,230
Where is the cow?

1338
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,530
Hey, pile for cow.

1339
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:51,230
Looks like a feeding station for the cow.

1340
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:52,890
Where is he?

1341
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,210
Hello, Larry.

1342
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:00,390
Oh, he doesn't...

1343
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,170
We don't even have a prompt for him.

1344
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,650
He doesn't want to talk to us at all.

1345
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:05,570
Lee, oh my god.

1346
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,430
I'm so glad you two didn't get killed out there.

1347
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,270
Do you think Mark will be okay?

1348
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:10,290
Eh, probably.

1349
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:11,250
I think he's...

1350
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:44,150
in good hands now yeah it's not too bad they'll be fine i've seen guys go through worse how could you all bring us to this place what are you talking about about your dad who's sitting right with his eyes rolling okay mister you're gonna eyes just rolled completely into the back of his head oh larry you're gonna give yourself I can't.

1351
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:46,290
Why does he look like that?

1352
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,840
Oh my god.

1353
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,360
It's like this is his party trick or something.

1354
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:56,240
It's horrible.

1355
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,100
What the hell?

1356
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,220
He's turning.

1357
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:04,560
I like your dad got bit on the way here.

1358
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,200
Oh my gosh.

1359
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,620
It's horrifying.

1360
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,360
Are you possessed?

1361
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:14,060
We have to worry about zombies.

1362
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:22,800
Zombies and demons About your dad I think we should yeah, is he okay?

1363
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,120
Hey, uh, can I talk to you in private before?

1364
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,100
Oh, he's fine now.

1365
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,420
It's been three months Your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.

1366
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,040
Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.

1367
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,200
That's just how he is.

1368
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,040
So he's a- wait.

1369
01:31:44,340 --> 01:32:40,360
does he treat you like no so he's the asshole look yeah my dad can be an ass sometimes i know that but he's not a bad guy he just he's got a lot of pain that's not an excuse to treat others poorly and lost pretty much everything we all have we all have yeah he's bitter and hateful but that's all just to protect himself and me all he's got left in the world is me that goes both ways you like crap but that's just because he still has one thing left to care about so don't judge him and don't judge me for sticking by him he's my dad and i love him literally everyone has lost something he's not special that's so messed up i guess what's wrong with him what's wrong

1370
01:32:52,940 --> 01:33:48,480
don't judge him bit I just trying to do it he's just having a bit of a moment truly I think if you and Kenny didn't exactly make up on the way here I tried seeing things from his point of view having a wife and kid and everything but gambling with your family's life is pretty stupid if you ask me fighting demons he is hey thanks for backing me up this morning at the motel I know I came you guys pretty hard but you do agree with the way i'm running things right uh i don't know kenny i'm kenny believes there's still hope maybe that's what we need right now yeah well hope doesn't do any good if we're all dead i'm focused on getting elderly and not giving my dad food that was cold i don't care okay i don't care hey uh do you think this is a

1371
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,720
This is what happens when you don't give him food.

1372
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,300
You're not you when you're hungry.

1373
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,660
Think our little arrangement with them was a good idea?

1374
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,220
A little late to be asking that now, don't you think?

1375
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,400
Dad's right.

1376
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,480
Let's just wait for dinner.

1377
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,220
And then if Mark is feeling up to it, we leave.

1378
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,100
I don't want to push our luck here.

1379
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,740
Now, let's not be hasty.

1380
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,220
How do you feel about it?

1381
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:52,100
about leaving the motor yeah it's a welcome change of scenery she doesn't want to leave though if we just stayed where we were then mark wouldn't have ended up with an arrow in his shoulder yeah but you wouldn't have food either just don't get too nosy these kinds of people are usually pretty protective of their privacy yeah and we don't need you poking your nose where it don't belong and getting us thrown out in our asses okay are you normal now it is normal Oh,

1382
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,020
okay, we gotta go this way.

1383
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:06,590
Alrighty, wait, there was nothing over there, so we go through here.

1384
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,020
That thing keeps a fence electrified.

1385
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,180
Okay, yes, astute observation.

1386
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,520
I guess Mark and I were lucky we weren't touching this thing when it came on.

1387
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,320
Yeah.

1388
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,180
Very, yeah, why did they turn it on?

1389
01:35:32,300 --> 01:36:00,180
why did they turn it on we still don't have an answer oh my gosh duck it's get off the swing here I'm gonna ask her if she wants I've got some things to take care of I'll be back in a bit no no okay let's push her please he's been on it the whole time hey Larry meet me over by the fence exactly okay

1390
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:04,260
What is he?

1391
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:04,940
What?

1392
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,420
Why didn't he pop out of nowhere like that?

1393
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:13,480
No shit.

1394
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:15,600
You saw what they did to your buddy.

1395
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,820
Nobody's safe here until we start to fight back.

1396
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,580
But how?

1397
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,800
The two of us should go out and do some recon.

1398
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,280
Then we'll all mount up for some revenge.

1399
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,580
Hell yeah.

1400
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,120
Yeah, we can eat all these people in the woods.

1401
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,280
We can eat all them instead.

1402
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:29,820
We don't know.

1403
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,420
I think some of them used to work in the big box up the way.

1404
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,080
The big box?

1405
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,940
Yeah, save lots.

1406
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,820
Anyway, they're nutty as all hell and get mad when they're hungry.

1407
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,980
So, are you ready to head out there and find their camp?

1408
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,200
Uh, yeah, we can go.

1409
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,220
Yeah, it'll be a good opportunity to find out a bit more about what we're up against.

1410
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:48,860
The guy was like standing there yapping.

1411
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,880
I'll stay here and hold down the fort.

1412
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,500
Remember, we're just doing the commissons for now.

1413
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,500
No use getting ourselves killed.

1414
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:57,420
Oh.

1415
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,480
Where are you going now?

1416
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,060
Yeah.

1417
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,060
I'll be back soon for the time.

1418
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,860
Please be lucky.

1419
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:07,940
I will.

1420
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,520
Lucky guy.

1421
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,960
Aw, Clem.

1422
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,060
Wait, it's just the two of us?

1423
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:19,840
That's what we're doing?

1424
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,280
See anything?

1425
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,280
Not yet.

1426
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:23,640
I'm scared.

1427
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,920
I know it's around here.

1428
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,560
It's gotta be close.

1429
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:34,940
Soup.

1430
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:44,330
Here.

1431
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:45,770
Oh?

1432
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:47,150
Oh!

1433
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:47,730
Oh!

1434
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:49,410
Shit, you found it?

1435
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,290
Wow, they have a whole really big setup.

1436
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,210
Thank you, villain!

1437
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,530
Save lots.

1438
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:09,450
Are we going in?

1439
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:11,450
Sneak up to the camp.

1440
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,660
I'm sneaking, sneaking mission.

1441
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:18,380
Infiltration.

1442
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,000
You see anybody?

1443
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:25,990
Stay on your guard.

1444
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:27,990
Stay on your guard.

1445
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,800
Watch my back, Lee.

1446
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,820
I'm gonna check out the tent.

1447
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,080
Do I see anybody?

1448
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,520
Yeah, I do need a crocodile outfit.

1449
01:38:59,480 --> 01:38:59,960
OSB.

1450
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,040
This camp's too small.

1451
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:02,660
It can't be their main base.

1452
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:04,160
That's what I was thinking.

1453
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:04,780
Yeah.

1454
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:06,520
Take a look around anyway.

1455
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,740
There's probably some shit around here they stole from us.

1456
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,120
Uh, what was that newspaper?

1457
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:14,360
What was that big old newspaper?

1458
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:16,680
Yuck.

1459
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,120
I don't need that.

1460
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,360
There was, like, a newspaper that said I'll...

1461
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,640
It was...

1462
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:25,880
Bottles?

1463
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:26,460
Kettle?

1464
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:27,580
Oh, no, no, bottle.

1465
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:27,940
Empty.

1466
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,980
But it looks like someone's been eating out of these.

1467
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:31,820
Recently.

1468
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,320
Gas cam?

1469
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,980
Nothing but fuse.

1470
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:37,940
Shit.

1471
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,790
The box?

1472
01:39:42,970 --> 01:40:07,550
just a box they got what's in the boxes they're all from save lots the first few days they told folks to gather to the save lots by the interstate anything worth taking this is not unless yeah unless you need a bunch of empty cans yeah they're all empty I'll pass

1473
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,540
John Terry.

1474
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,700
Wait, we'll get that in a second.

1475
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,900
Looks like they were moving a lot of stuff.

1476
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:30,630
Hold on.

1477
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,990
Was there anything else over here?

1478
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:33,680
Let's check.

1479
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:37,610
The crate?

1480
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:39,830
Nothing.

1481
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,930
Nothing here.

1482
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:43,150
The box?

1483
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:45,530
Just a box?

1484
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:46,490
Okay.

1485
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:48,810
Wait.

1486
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:53,070
What is it?

1487
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:53,770
What?

1488
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,430
What?

1489
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,130
What was... What?

1490
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:01,430
Looks like they expected to be here a while.

1491
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:05,230
Tent looks pretty new.

1492
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:06,470
Anybody inside?

1493
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:08,130
Two sleeping bags.

1494
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:09,950
One of them's kid-sized.

1495
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:13,110
That doesn't seem like a bandit.

1496
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:18,500
That doesn't...

1497
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,320
That doesn't seem like a bandit.

1498
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:32,000
from the dairy here oh probably a food we've been giving them fuckers cross the line what

1499

1500
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:10,290
No, but Lily keeps us all on a regular training schedule Lily I thought you were running things back there.

1501
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:12,910
Yeah, but she's got the combat training.

1502
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:14,190
Why is that so suspicious?

1503
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:21,210
Yeah, someone else can teach how to use things Why are you acting so weird?

1504
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:21,850
Huh?

1505
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:31,470
Get Carly to put batteries in I Thought I looked at everything around here No?

1506
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:34,390
Is there anything else I'm missing?

1507
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,440
Let me go look at the tent again.

1508
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:49,010
Oh, okay, now that he's not in there, we can look.

1509
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:03,040
Bloody bunny!

1510
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:08,330
Wait!

1511
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:13,330
Are these the real people of the dairy farm, you think?

1512
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:15,670
You think...

1513
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:18,910
You think the brothers there don't actually own the dairy farm?

1514
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:19,470
Jesus.

1515
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:21,630

01:43:59,200 --> 01:43:59,980
You don't know me.

1521
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,400
Steal my shit.

1522
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:03,740
Steal everything from me.

1523
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,960
We had a deal.

1524
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,720
You people broke it first.

1525
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,200
What happened?

1526
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,500
Why are you alone up here?

1527
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:09,860
What happened to you?

1528
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:10,460
Yeah, what happened?

1529
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,400
Well, that's a hell of a question, mister.

1530
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:14,600
They told me I'd be safe with them.

1531
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:17,520
Men who lived here, but it weren't safe.

1532
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:18,780
Not for me.

1533
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,480
Not for my girl.

1534
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,260
They didn't treat her nice.

1535
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,340
Not at all.

1536
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,700
They took her away into the woods.

1537
01:44:25,720 --> 01:45:36,200
wouldn't tell me where and I baked them every way I could think they just laughed so I killed them and I'm staying here till she comes back to me one way or another she'll come back now maybe you didn't hear me last time when I asked you sweet put your damn guns down you think I won't kill you I'm gonna take this here crossbow and put a nice sharp arrow right through your eyeball into your goddamn brain you're not men you're monsters all men are monsters take what they want them and destroy it all take a can of where did you get Clementine's hat it's all the fucking thing you where did you get this hat the little girl you stole it from her so what if I did you stole her from me wait what huh what the hell are you talking about you know what I changed my mind I'm putting this arrow right through your balls yeah right through string him up on that tree then I'm gonna head down to that arm and shoot every goddamn person I see put down the crossbow no sir I need it I need it to kill you

1538
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:44,280

1539
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:50,900
Damn.

1540
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,800
God damn it!

1541
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:57,840
Uh...

1542
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,840
Uh...

1543
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,840
Thanks, I guess.

1544
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:01,780
I guess.

1545
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,800
Well, you're welcome, I guess.

1546
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:06,720
Notice my suspicion.

1547
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,180
It's a clean shot, though.

1548
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,640
Right through the forehead.

1549
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:17,780
That's good shooting right there.

1550
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:20,120
Still, what a waste.

1551
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:43,360
so that's it going back if they ain't here I don't know where they are and it ain't a good idea to go tromping through the woods looking for them so yeah we head back once they see this they'll get the message well she said she wasn't with them take the crossbow at least oh the brain matter

1552
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,590
come on

1553
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:55,060
how did she have Clementine's hide

1554
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,190
Huh?

1555
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:05,530
Waste of what?

1556
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:06,530
I write?

1557
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:11,250
Your balls will remember that.

1558
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,850
They spared our balls.

1559
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:14,410
Man, that was a hell of a ride, huh?

1560
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:15,970
Jesus, Denny.

1561
01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:16,450
What?

1562
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,470
You ain't getting soft on, Maria.

1563
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:21,010
Not after what they did to your friend.

1564
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:22,570
You're back!

1565
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:23,590
What happened?

1566
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:24,710
Handled it, Mama.

1567
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:28,430
That was it.

1568
01:47:28,450 --> 01:48:01,130
waste I guess they like them fresh this isn't what Terry would have wanted my husband miss him every day then screw it up for everybody then why don't you oh calm down princess I'll do it myself how did she steal Clementine's high like where did she get it what's going on with them don't know squabbling looks like a lot of tension with y'all huh yeah you're telling me you could say that Yeah,

1569
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,190
you could say that.

1570
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:05,690
They don't exactly see eye to eye on how we should be doing things.

1571
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:08,610
Well, it's probably just the hunger talking.

1572
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:12,930
And Lee, don't worry your head about them bandits.

1573
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:19,210
I'm sorry you've seen more violence than I've thought in your short time, but you are safe here.

1574
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:20,410
Don't worry.

1575
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:22,790
Think I'll go have a look around.

1576
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:23,810
Is dinner ready?

1577
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:24,810
Oh, okay.

1578
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:26,620
Dinner will be ready before you know it.

1579
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:28,410
I thank your friend.

1580
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:36,070
Sometimes her face looks like that one guy that everybody says dream looks like.

1581
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:40,150
A little like leprechaun guy.

1582
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:41,390
I don't know what he's from.

1583
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:46,310
Glim!

1584
01:48:46,510 --> 01:48:46,730
Wait.

1585
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:48,810
Are you playing with a cow?

1586
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,040
Grumple stiltskin?

1587
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:56,180
Yeah!

1588
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:57,340
Yeah!

1589
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:58,740
That guy.

1590
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,200
Let's talk to Danny.

1591
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:04,600

1592
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:05,500

1594
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,320
How do you run this place with just one cow?

1595
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:27,740

People get hungry And a few loaves of bread fetch a high price Y'all are luckier on this side of the deal now You really like that gun.

1597
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,160

01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,420
What's not to like?

1600
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,040
It's kind of creepy.

1601
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:48,880
Not much, I guess.

1602
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,040
Exactly.

1603
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:52,240
We'll agree with him so he doesn't shoot us.

1604
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,320
Danny noticed your suspicion.

1605
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:56,620
Why does he keep noticing my suspicion?

1606
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,560
Walking dead telltale fog.

01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:04,060

1614
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:50,730
It's a small toolbox.

1615
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:53,090
That's it!

1616
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,440

The cow is...

1623
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,500
What's this thing?

1624
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:51,480
The cow is with child?

1625
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:52,580
A salt lick.

1626
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,160
A salt.

1627
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,420
Yeah, but don't lick it.

1628
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,080
It's gross.

1629
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,180
It's like a peanut butter lick.

1630
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:57,660
Did you lick it?

1631
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:00,380
I don't know.

1632
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:06,540
I don't know.

1633
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,560
That's my girl.

1634
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:13,120
I wish there was a...

1635
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,740
I wish there was a prompt to lick it.

1636
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:19,490
Oh, we can't.

1637
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:21,750
We finally hear the moose!

1638
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:25,510
Moose, what's that?

1639
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,570
Me!

1640
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:28,030
Oh.

1641
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,940
Salt lick.

1642
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:35,560
Can I lick it?

1643
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,640
Have you guys ever tried a salt lick before?

1644
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:39,360
It's just really salty, no?

1645
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,100
Me.

1646
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:47,500
Oh.

1647
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:55,820
Empty.

1648
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:00,600
Never seen one IRL.

1649
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:01,980
Me neither, actually.

1650
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,160
I had a salt, a rock salt lamp I used to lick more of it.

1651
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:18,380
Those, though, I think I've seen cats like to lick those salt lambs.

1652
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,440
That's not good for them.

1653
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:21,980
But cats will also lick them.

1654
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,040
Oh.

1655
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,860
What is all this?

1656
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,620
Oh, I thought that was a person in there.

1657
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:35,200
Looks like a bunch of old dirty clothes.

1658
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:35,720
Yeah.

1659
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:36,320
Ooh.

1660
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:37,900
Spells pretty foul.

1661
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,400
Oh.

1662
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,720
What happened to the music?

1663
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,580
It's like medical stuff.

1664
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,060
Now I'm embarrassed.

1665
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:56,040
The saw lamps are dangerous?

1666
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:56,820
Why?

1667
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,560
Wait, where'd the music go?

1668
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,560
It's kind of spooky.

1669
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,460
Feeding trough.

1670
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,120
It's a feeding trough.

1671
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:13,440
How bad is it?

1672
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:36,020
oats in it oh yeah mother mother please i crave oats what is that it looks doesn't look like a feed it doesn't look like we're feeding at all though it looks like it's just full of pot like uh wood chips or something

1673
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,900
okay we'll talk to them but i also want to see the door

1674
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,200
Brother, may I have...

1675
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,160
You found it too, huh?

1676
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,820
Lee, they're hiding something behind this door.

1677
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,140
I got a quick look.

1678
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:01,020
They got boxes of stuff and something metal and sharp.

1679
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:02,540
Don't get paranoid.

1680
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:04,700
It's my job to be paranoid, Lee.

1681
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,260
I think so.

1682
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,000
I've got my whole family on this farm right now.

1683
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:08,220
How about you?

1684
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:09,480
What about Clem?

1685
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,420
Uh...

1686
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,160
I'll protect her no matter what.

1687
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,580
I'll protect her no matter what.

1688
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:15,900
Yeah.

1689
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:44,260

1690
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,540
Lose your head, Kenny.

1691
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,300
All right, Professor.

1692
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,280
What'd you have in mind?

1693
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,680
Let me have a look at what we're dealing with first.

1694
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:51,440
Yeah.

1695
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:53,120
Maybe we can pick it.

1696
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:54,300
Oh.

1697
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:56,760
Hey, Lee.

1698
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:59,080
You know how to pick a lock, right?

1699
01:55:59,500 --> 01:55:59,880
No.

1700
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:01,540
Why would you say that?

1701
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,780
Well, you're, you know, urban?

1702
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,220
Oh, you are not seeing what I think you're saying.

1703
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,340
Jesus, man, I'm from Florida.

1704
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,080
Get it!

1705
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:14,760
Sorry.

1706
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,860
Typical Florida, man.

1707
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:20,040
Caddy!

1708
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:22,420
Actually, I learned that picking a lock.

1709
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:27,100
Learning how to lock pick is, like, way easier than it seems.

1710
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:32,140
What?

1711
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:33,520
See those screws?

1712
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:36,900
Instead of breaking the padlock, we can just take off the assembly.

1713
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,180
Apparently it's so easy.

1714
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,800
Then replace it all again like nothing ever happened.

1715
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:41,480
Alright.

1716
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:42,700
Sounds like you gotta play.

1717
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,160
Huge arse!

1718
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:46,240
What are you talking about?

1719
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:48,760
Glad you're putting our Supertask to great use.

1720
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:49,440
Take what it's like.

1721
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,140
Can I help you boys find something?

1722
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,680
Thank you.

1723
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,760
Um, Kenny heard a noise.

1724
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:59,080
Kenny thought he heard a noise.

1725
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:00,840
He's a little jumpy, huh?

1726
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:02,300
Well, you made an excuse.

1727
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,580
We're all sure glad his wife is here.

1728
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,400
In oblivion, right?

1729
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,380
He's a lifesaver, are you?

1730
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:06,660
You got no idea.

1731
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:07,500
You can get a lock.

1732
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,680
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

1733
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:09,360
Lock-picking license.

1734
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,720
Don't fuck around with this door, okay?

1735
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:13,280
Just, you know, mama gets nervous.

1736
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,380
Andrew, I need your help again.

1737
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:16,620
No problem.

1738
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:17,340
Right away, Doc.

1739
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,980
Is there dead dad or zombified dad in there?

1740
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,200
Distract Andy to get him out of the barn.

1741
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:28,960
Hey, Andy.

1742
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,380
How do I distract Andy?

1743
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,080
Any thoughts on how to distract Andy?

1744
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:34,640
I don't know, man.

1745
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:36,560
Just look for something outside of the barn.

1746
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:37,920
We need him out of here.

1747
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:38,520
Okay.

1748
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,240
Wait, I want to talk to...

1751
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:16,440
I love that cow.

1752
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:17,100
She's pretty.

1753
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:17,700
Yeah.

1754
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,840
I love this cow.

1755
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,800
Hey there, Andy.

1756
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:22,380
Hey, Andy.

1757
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:22,620
Yeah.

1758
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:25,040
You got a screwdriver?

1759
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:26,600
You got a screwdriver?

1760
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:27,580
For what?

1761
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:29,200
Uh, never mind.

1762
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

1763
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:32,500
Danny mentioned he needed something.

1764
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:34,740
Danny mentioned he needed something.

1765
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:35,960
Did he say what?

1766
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,380
Shit, I can't remember now.

1767
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:39,040
Sorry.

1768
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:40,360
All right.

1769
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:40,960
All right.

1770
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:42,180
Be right back, guys.

1771
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,500
I'm not suspicious at all.

1772
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:50,260
Okay, I'm gonna go lock.

1773
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:50,760
Oh, wait.

1774
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,820
No, I'm gonna go get the screwdriver.

1775
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:01,350
I'm gonna go get it myself.

1776
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:02,370
False alarm.

1777
01:59:02,690 --> 01:59:03,090
I'm back.

1778
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:04,690
Oopsie.

1779
01:59:04,970 --> 01:59:05,250
Oh.

1780
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,090
Oops.

1781
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:06,770
Wait.

1782
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:10,550
Oopsie.

1783
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:11,310
Wait.

1784
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,070
Oops.

1785
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:13,330
Oops.

1786
01:59:15,050 --> 01:59:15,690
Oopsie.

1787
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:15,990
Oh.

1788
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:21,930
So, how does a woman like yourself run this whole place?

1789
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:22,590
Is he sweet?

1790
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:23,710
Oh, I managed just fine.

1791
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:25,930
Plus, I had my boys to help out.

1792
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,710
I couldn't do it without him.

1793
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,600
Riz her up, Larry.

1794
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:46,220
Not gonna lie, something about him seems her tied.

1795
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:48,660
Brenda must use this thing for household repairs.

1796
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,200
And it probably has a screwdriver in it.

1797
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,300
Brenda must use this thing for...

1798
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,320
I see the...

1799
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:56,320
There we go.

1800
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:00,580
Multi-tool?

1801
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:01,540
Multi-tool.

1802
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:02,630
That should be handy.

1803
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:04,240
Tag it.

1804
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,160
You're just gonna borrow this for a second.

1805
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:12,610
La la la!

1806
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:13,750
Wait, how do I get him?

1807
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:17,050
I could use the generator.

1808
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:23,190
Um...

1809
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:23,510
beep!

1810
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:30,470
I think the generator's off.

1811
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:34,930
I think something...

1812
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:37,030
Damn, this thing is the worst piece of shit.

1813
02:00:37,850 --> 02:00:39,510
Something's always tripping the breaker.

1814
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:45,630
Oh, it didn't work?

1815
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:46,730
Oh.

1816
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:49,670
Dang, I thought he would be gone for longer.

1817
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:53,630
My bad.

1818
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:56,310
Not suspicious at all.

1819
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:57,410
Nah.

1820
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:00,150
No, I'm...

1821
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:01,930
very inconspicuous

1822
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:17,880
there's a baby in there careful don't spook her okay

1823
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:35,370
oh the hat hey clementine my hat you found it I knew you'd find it.

1824
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:36,590
You said you would.

1825
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:39,590
Listen, did you give your hat to anyone?

1826
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:40,390
No.

1827
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:44,450
Did you see any strangers around the motor inn who might have taken it?

1828
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:45,050
No.

1829
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:46,170
Why?

1830
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:47,630
It's probably nothing.

1831
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:49,970
Just let me know if you ever see anything like that.

1832
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:51,190
Okay, I will.

1833
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:54,710
Hey, Lee, do you think you'll ever have kids?

1834
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:55,310
Whoa!

1835
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:57,090
Whoa!

1836
02:01:58,250 --> 02:01:59,770
I haven't thought about it.

1837
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:00,510
I don't know.

1838
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:03,050
I haven't thought about having kids in a while.

1839
02:02:03,070 --> 02:02:03,690
Wow!

1840
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:06,990
Well, thanks for finding my hat.

1841
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:07,910
George, thank you!

1842
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:08,530
Happy birthday!

02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:10,350
Do you want to pet the cow with me?

1844
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:11,770
Nah, but you go on ahead.

1845
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:14,670
I guess I do want to pet the cow, actually.

1846
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:17,010
Actually, I would really love to pet the cow.

1847
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:18,150
She looks skinny.

1848
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:19,910
No, please!

1849
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:21,270

02:03:42,450 --> 02:03:44,590
What if I use the tool on the generator?

1862
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:46,210
But I don't want to, like, break it.

1863
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:47,570
I think that's kind of bad, no.

1864
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:58,470
Oh, ah.

1865
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:06,410
There you go.

1866
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:09,210
This doesn't seem good.

1867
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,410
I'm going to use the...

1868
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:13,150
Looks like that bell's driving me.

1869
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:14,730
What you're going to call it?

1870
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:49,230

Damn it, though.

1872
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:52,710
Ah, son of a fuck.

1873
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:54,650
God, this'll take forever.

1874
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:56,710
Okay.

1875
02:04:57,630 --> 02:04:58,590
Yeah, it'll take forever.

1876
02:04:58,890 --> 02:04:59,210
Yeah, yeah.

1877
02:05:00,050 --> 02:05:01,070
What frack.

1878
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:05,670
Okay.

1879
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:08,710
This doesn't seem so smart.

1880
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:10,510
I don't know.

1881
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:15,490
I think it's because of the thunderstorm incoming that makes me anxious.

1882
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:21,410

02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:33,000

It's a good excuse.

1888
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:38,280
I'm scared.

1889
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:44,310
Oh.

1890
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,600
Boy, didn't you hear the bell?

1891
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:56,200
Dinner time.

1892
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,990
I found the door like that.

1893
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,710
Look, I just came in and found the door open like that.

1894
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:07,190
Probably my dear brother.

1895
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:09,270

1899
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,820
Is that blood?

1900
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,660
There's no one sleeping here.

1901
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:13,940
Where the hell is Mark?

1902
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:16,380
Thought Brenda said he was up here resting.

1903
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:19,960
Seems like there's a storm coming.

1904
02:09:20,940 --> 02:09:24,160
Oh, I think the storm's already here.

1905
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,100
Farm books, cookbooks, nothing out of the ordinary here.

1906
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:35,880
Nobody would have seen Mark be trailed off to the barn.

1907
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:47,200
Wait...

1908
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:47,940
Power cord.

1909
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:50,860
What is this stuff?

1910
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:53,860
Looks like a bunch of medical waste in here.

1911
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:55,620
The food is drugged.

1912
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:59,080
What would dairy farmers need with this kind of stuff?

1913
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:03,740
I guess someone needed some first aid recently.

1914
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:06,220
Musty as hell.

1915
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:07,620
Cannons.

1916
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:08,640
Smart.

1917
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,160
They need so much morphine for.

1918
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:16,900
Huh, where is that cord going?

1919
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:21,300
We're just gonna use it.

1920
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,060
For the content.

1921
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:28,730
What the hell?

1922
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,840
Yeah, don't shut it.

1923
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:37,340
That's fine.

1924
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:40,240
We can take on these guys.

1925
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:41,820
Oh, God.

1926
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:43,520
Hello?

1927
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:44,100
Mark?

1928
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:46,880
Mark?

1929
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:47,600
Oh.

1930
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:49,620
Oh, he's behind the...

1931
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:51,720
bookshelf?

1932
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:12,020
Oh, hi, Mark!

1933
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:13,100
That's not Mark.

1934
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,380
Oh, it is!

1935
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,040
Oh, hi, Mark!

1936
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:19,720
Mark!

1937
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,160
What the hell happened?

1938
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:23,800
Don't show this to Barry.

1939
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,400
Brothers...

1940
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:30,360
What the hell happened to your legs, man?

1941
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:34,400
Don't eat dinner.

1942
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:47,570
Before she eats!

1943
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:48,950
How do I get out of the room?

1944
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:53,810
Go, go, go, go!

1945
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:58,220
No!

1946
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,580
It's people!

1947
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:02,960
It's... people!

1948
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:05,780
Yes, Lee.

1949
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:07,960
It's all people in here.

1950
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:09,500
Sit down.

1951
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:10,040
You're so...

1952
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:12,080
You couldn't stop laughing for me!

1953
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:16,080
It's people!

1954
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,220
Oh, sit your ass down, Lee.

1955
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:20,000
This lady has made you a meal.

1956
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,000
Yeah, Lee.

1957
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:22,120
What's gotten into you?

1958
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:23,440
He just had a start.

1959
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,420
They could use some goddamn manners.

1960
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,240
You're eating human meat.

1961
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,320
That's crazy.

1962
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:29,900
What the hell?

1963
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,140
You're scaring the kids, Lee.

1964
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,180
You chose to be direct.

1965
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:36,840
Don't indulge him, Lily.

1966
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:39,000
There's always something with this guy.

1967
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:42,280
Mom, I was eating that.

1968
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:43,260
What is going on?

1969
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:44,400
We need to get the kids.

1970
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:45,620
Everyone out of here.

1971
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:46,220
Yeah, we need to get out of here.

1972
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:47,380
We need to go now.

1973
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:50,640
Everything could have turned out okay for you, folks.

1974
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,240
He would have died anyway.

1975
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:53,700
We got to think about living.

1976
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,660
Settle down, honey.

1977
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:59,560
Growing up in rural Georgia, you're taught not to waste.

1978
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:03,020
It's how I was raised and how I raised my boss.

1979
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:07,440
Now, you got monsters roaming around that do nothing but eat people.

1980
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:41,540
till they eat some more we think we can put that meat to better use and you're all sick sick in the head lee that's not a very nice thing to imply i'm being direct andy is right we go after folks who were gonna die anyways one way or another he's still eating it like y'all lily grab a knife grab a knife Nobody's going anywhere.

02:14:00,290 --> 02:14:01,750
I don't want to die.

02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:03,810

Where's our go?

1989
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,650
Is that Mark?

1990
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:24,350
Wait, is he a Zombo now, you think?

1991
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:27,870
Mark!

1992
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:30,330
Please!

1993
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:33,510
Someone!

1994
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:34,870
Holy hell!

1995
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:36,350
Oh my god!

1996
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:39,150
Get him while they're distracted!

1997
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:41,970
Oh, they got us.

1998
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:42,370
Well, we're just...

1999
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:44,090
distract them.

2000
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:44,910
Mark!

2001
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:50,090
You couldn't even be useful then to cause a diversion.

2002
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:53,790
I will tear you fuckers apart with my bare hands.

2003
02:14:54,010 --> 02:14:55,590
We gotta find another way out of here.

2004
02:14:57,350 --> 02:14:59,770
You sad fucking bastards!

2005
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:03,130
At least we can agree with with...

2006
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:03,590
Larry?

2007
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:06,270
Let me... It's Larry.

2008
02:15:06,510 --> 02:15:07,710
I had to stop.

2009
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:11,850
It was a person.

02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:17,090
Dad, you can't get...

2013
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:19,370

2014
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:20,050
Easy!

2015
02:16:20,570 --> 02:16:20,970
Yes!

2016
02:16:21,710 --> 02:16:22,370
Oh, wait.

2017
02:16:23,110 --> 02:16:25,150
If he dies, we're stuck in here with a zombie.

2018
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:26,870
Uh-oh, wait.

2019
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:28,230
Wait, not here.

2020
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:29,030
No, Larry.

2021
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:29,690
You have...

2022
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:30,090
No, Larry.

2023
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:30,690
No, Larry.

2024
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:31,210
Oh, no, no.

2025
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:32,850
Oh, no, no.

2026
02:16:32,850 --> 02:16:33,430
Oh, no, no.

2027
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:34,730
He stopped breathing.

2028
02:16:35,290 --> 02:16:36,410
I think he's had a heart attack.

2029
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:36,710
Oh, wait.

2030
02:16:37,070 --> 02:16:37,830
Oh, but...

2031
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:38,110
Oh, no.

2032
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:38,790
He's not dead.

2033
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:39,890
Oh yes, oh no.

2034
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,510
Somebody help me.

2035
02:16:40,570 --> 02:16:42,570
He has, this guy screws us over.

2036
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:43,410
If he's dead.

2037
02:16:43,610 --> 02:16:45,010
Yeah, he's not dead.

2038
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:47,550
What has to happen, Lee?

2039
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:48,830
Think about it.

2040
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:50,870
You saw that poor bastard at the motel.

2041
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:54,270
He screws us over in his very last final breath.

2042
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:55,810
Truly, truly amber.

2043
02:16:56,650 --> 02:17:03,150
But in a few minutes, we're going to be stuck in a locked room with a six foot four 300 pound seriously pissed off dead guy.

2044
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:03,830
Fuck you.

2045
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:05,370
We can bring him back.

2046
02:17:05,670 --> 02:17:06,010
Lee!

2047
02:17:06,810 --> 02:17:07,870
Good morning later.

2048
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:08,250
I'll try.

2049
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:10,790
Now we have to keep him from coming back.

2050
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:11,170
No!

2051
02:17:11,470 --> 02:17:12,650
God damn it, Kenny!

2052
02:17:13,010 --> 02:17:14,450
He is not dead!

2053
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:16,810
Uh...

2054
02:17:17,430 --> 02:17:19,330
Lily can save him.

2055
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:19,830
Maybe not.

2056
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:21,090
Probably not.

2057
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:23,270
But that man is dead.

2058
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:25,110
You both know what happens next.

2059
02:17:25,890 --> 02:17:28,670
Look, Kenny, back at the drugstore when we all thought Duck was bitten.

2060
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:30,310
I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

2061
02:17:30,570 --> 02:17:31,830
Maybe we should do the same now.

2062
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:32,550
That was different.

2063
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:33,590
Duck wasn't bitten.

2064
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:34,550
But come on!

2065
02:17:34,610 --> 02:17:36,230
We know this guy's not gonna make it.

2066
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:38,630
Remember what Ben said.

2067
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:41,010
Gotta destroy the brain.

2068
02:17:41,250 --> 02:17:41,990
Come on, Lee.

2069
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:43,670
You can't be in the middle on this one.

2070
02:17:44,030 --> 02:17:45,690
You gotta have my back this time.

2071
02:17:46,310 --> 02:17:47,330
God damn it, Lee.

2072
02:17:47,390 --> 02:17:48,190
I need you.

2073
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:49,530
Please help me.

2074
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:51,570
Come on, yet.

2075
02:17:51,890 --> 02:17:52,370
Wait, how do I?

2076
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:52,890
Come on.

2077
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:54,730
Wait, uh, what is that?

2078
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:54,850
Wait.

2079
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:55,910
What was that?

2080
02:17:56,030 --> 02:17:56,550
Wake up.

2081
02:17:56,550 --> 02:17:56,870
Help Lily?

2082
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:57,430
Oh, hell no.

2083
02:17:58,250 --> 02:17:58,670
Help Kenny.

2084
02:17:58,770 --> 02:17:59,750
You're right, Kenny.

2085
02:18:00,310 --> 02:18:01,130
Let's get this over.

2086
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:02,230
You fucking monsters!

2087
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:03,970
Both of you!

2088
02:18:04,050 --> 02:18:04,870
I don't want to see!

2089
02:18:05,390 --> 02:18:06,430
No, no, no!

2090
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,050
No!

2091
02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:09,490
Please!

2092
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:12,410
Don't do this!

2093
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:14,430
No!

2094
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:15,410
No!

2095
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:15,750
No!

2096
02:18:16,050 --> 02:18:16,710
I was drinking.

2097
02:18:17,710 --> 02:18:19,230
Don't let go of me!

2098
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:23,290
You're gonna get bit first, ma'am!

2099
02:18:24,450 --> 02:18:24,730
No!

2100
02:18:25,650 --> 02:18:25,650
Please!

2101
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:27,170
Oh, damn.

2102
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:28,790
With the salt lick.

2103
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:29,730
No!

2104
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:40,150
God help us.

2105
02:18:42,210 --> 02:18:43,270
I'm sorry.

2106
02:18:43,610 --> 02:18:45,890
Don't you fucking touch me.

2107
02:18:48,930 --> 02:18:49,470
Clementine.

2108
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:51,050
You alert.

2109
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:52,330
Clem.

2110
02:18:53,070 --> 02:18:54,990
Too much salt will kill you.

2111
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:56,490
That's the name of the...

2112
02:18:56,490 --> 02:18:58,090
Lily said he wasn't dead.

2113
02:18:59,430 --> 02:19:00,030
He was.

2114
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:01,070
He was dead.

2115
02:19:01,970 --> 02:19:03,690
He was dead, Clementine.

2116
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:05,030
But what if he wasn't?

2117
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:05,670
He was.

2118
02:19:05,970 --> 02:19:06,290
He was.

2119
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:07,370
I promise.

2120
02:19:08,850 --> 02:19:10,550
Salt lick to the face.

2121
02:19:11,430 --> 02:19:11,910
I know.

2122
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:12,770
I know.

2123
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:13,530
Die.

2124
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:15,290
You gotta be strong right now.

2125
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,890
I need you to be strong.

2126
02:19:17,430 --> 02:19:19,830
Think about something else, something hopeful.

2127
02:19:20,570 --> 02:19:21,470
Like what?

2128
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:25,990
Uh, your walkie talk, a safe place.

2129
02:19:26,490 --> 02:19:28,710
Some place safe where no monsters can get you.

2130
02:19:29,310 --> 02:19:30,550
We're gonna get out, right?

2131
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:31,030
Yeah.

2132
02:19:31,230 --> 02:19:32,290
You found a way out?

2133
02:19:32,390 --> 02:19:32,850
Uh-huh.

2134
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:35,210
I'm working on it.

2135
02:19:36,210 --> 02:19:38,190
Well, at least we don't have to worry about Larry.

2136
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:40,770
Yeah, we murdered him!

2137
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:41,710
Yes!

2138
02:19:43,610 --> 02:20:50,690

2140
02:21:14,910 --> 02:21:15,950
She hates us now.

2141
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:17,690
She hates us.

2142
02:21:20,430 --> 02:21:21,110
It's okay.

2143
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:21,930
Oh, wait.

2144
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:22,570
What did I see?

2145
02:21:22,810 --> 02:21:22,970
Nothing?

2146
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:23,390
Okay.

2147
02:21:24,450 --> 02:21:25,190
Air condition.

2148
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:27,030
There ought to be an air duct behind this unit.

2149
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:29,310
Maybe big enough for one of us to fit through.

2150
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:30,990
I don't know, Lee.

2151
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:32,430
Seems like a long shot.

2152
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:34,930
Does the air conditioner come off?

2153
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:36,610
I think I could take it off.

2154
02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:39,090
If I had something to remove the screws.

2155
02:21:39,410 --> 02:21:39,830
Ugh.

2156
02:21:40,470 --> 02:21:42,230
Yeah, oh, you do still have it.

2157
02:21:42,270 --> 02:21:43,510
Of course they took it shit.

2158
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:44,310
Oh, just kidding.

2159
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:45,670
Maybe there's something else we could use.

2160
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:47,290
I've got a rock.

2161
02:21:47,730 --> 02:21:49,630
Oh, Clementine, you're the best.

2162
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:50,990
A coin might do the trick.

2163
02:21:51,390 --> 02:21:52,170
Do you have a coin?

2164
02:21:52,530 --> 02:21:52,750
A coin?

2165
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:58,340
Uh.

2166
02:21:58,340 --> 02:21:58,680
Uh.

2167
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:05,520
If we can remove these screws, the AC should come down easily.

2168
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:10,680
Who had a coin?

2169
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:15,260
Someone earlier was just like, I got a coin that I can...

2170
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,420
Oh, it was Larry!

2171
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,200
Get away.

2172
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:21,440
Really rub salt in the wound.

2173
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:23,720
Wait, no, I need the coin, Lily.

2174
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:28,200
Why can't you just leave me alone?

2175
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:31,960
I'm sorry, Lily.

2176
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:38,200
But if we're going to get out of here, we need your help.

2177
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:40,680
I need... I need a penny.

2178
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:42,100
I think I may have found a...

02:22:42,120 --> 02:23:13,360

2180
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:15,460
My blessing to loot his corpse?

2181
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,540
Uh, yeah.

2182
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:21,660
Do what you have to do.

2183
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:23,860
All right, give it to me, Larry.

2184
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:27,420
Oh, boy.

2185
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,860
Oh, gosh.

2186
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:30,080
He got him good.

2187
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,420
Any idea which pocket he keeps us changing?

2188
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,180
A fucking vulture.

2189
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:47,220
I don't want to search his back.

2190
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:47,940
backpocket.

2191
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:49,600
You know what happens when you die.

2192
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:52,020
Nice!

2193
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:53,500

Just gotta remove these screws and get this unit off.

2196
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:05,680
Okay.

2197
02:24:06,220 --> 02:24:07,360
60 cents.

2198
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:10,720
If we can remove these screws, oops.

2199
02:24:11,060 --> 02:24:12,340
He's a blockhead.

2200
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,660
Penny for your thoughts.

2201
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,040

02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:36,280

02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:52,780
Looks like it'll probably lead right into that back room, but it's too small for us to fit through I just do it.

2211
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:55,600
Clementine.

2212
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:01,740
You don't have to do this.

2213
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:03,160
You know you don't have to do this, right?

2214
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:04,060
I know.

2215
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,720
I just want to go home.

2216
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:07,900
This will help us get back home.

2217
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:15,300
You're going to be fine.

2218
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:17,080
What do I do when I get out?

2219
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:19,840
See if you can get to the other side of that door and open it.

2220
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:27,980
Clem!

2221
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:29,400
Clem!

2222
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:31,660
She's venting.

2223
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:53,880
Oh, Clementine!

2224
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:55,960
Okay, did anyone see you?

2225
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:57,840
Oh, my darling!

2226
02:25:58,100 --> 02:25:58,820
Oh, my...

2227
02:25:58,820 --> 02:25:59,500
There's a man.

2228
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:01,320
Lily, gotta go.

2229
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,500
Leave me alone.

2230
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:03,960
Lee, I can see him.

2231
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:04,420
Okay.

2232
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:05,880
It's not safe in here.

2233
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,120
For God's sake, Lee.

2234
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:09,460
Didn't even get to say goodbye.

2235
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:10,100
Shh, shh, shh.

2236
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:12,180
Get in here.

2237
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:13,160
I got an idea.

2238
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,080

Oh, okay.

2243
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,060
The matter of the meat.

2244
02:26:58,060 --> 02:26:59,100
Do I need to remember this?

2245
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:02,120
Yeah, good, good plan.

2246
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:02,760
Good plan.

2247
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:10,800
Ew.

2248
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,040
I think I'm gonna be sick.

2249
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:18,720
Mini cattle prod.

2250
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:19,920
Take that too.

2251
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:20,700
Oh, yeah.

2252
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:21,980

Wait.

2255
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,360
I can only take one or the other.

2256
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:31,520
Oh, there's also a sickle.

2257
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:35,220
What would be best?

2258
02:27:41,150 --> 02:27:41,550
Ah.

2259
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:44,270
Hey, watch your step.

2260
02:27:44,470 --> 02:27:45,050
That's slippery.

2261
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:47,810
What would be best?

2262
02:27:58,900 --> 02:28:00,520
I wonder, I think...

2263
02:28:00,560 --> 02:29:20,160
maybe the the cattle from God what's wrong with these people they're crazy bloody tough Jesus this is where they butcher people except Mark Mark got special treatment maybe I shouldn't have sickly in time through there this room would give anybody nightmares I know poor baby poor baby girl Clementine you're so smart okay all right we chose our we chose our weapon of choice this i mean his sickle's kind of awesome though i wonder what's the tastiest cut of meat the thighs so what's the plan yeah what's the plan tell me this is so caught up in his own rant that we could probably sneak right up on him just stick behind me in case anything goes down when we get to the front grab his gun sounds good okay you're ready are you you don't have a weapon yet now let's go let's go stay close oh why am I not sneaking anymore oh

What's he doing out there?

2268
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:57,270
I don't know.

2269
02:29:58,030 --> 02:29:58,730
I'll keep an eye on him.

2270
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:00,510
Ready to act what I say.

2271
02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:02,010
See what he's doing now.

2272
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:04,730
Oh, I know, Mabel.

2273
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:06,910
This is my favorite one too.

2274
02:30:07,350 --> 02:30:10,350
When I let one think they can just walk right out.

2275
02:30:11,310 --> 02:30:12,310
They never

2276
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:17,300
think.

2277
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,420
Some fucker thinks this is a game.

2278
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:30,160

Yeah!

2282
02:30:56,750 --> 02:30:57,070
Oh!

2283
02:30:58,290 --> 02:30:58,830

2284
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,950
Kenny!

2285
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:04,420
That's right, Kenny.

2286
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:07,220
It was worth not grabbing the sickle.

2287
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:09,120
So we could see Kenny use it.

2288
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:09,580
You can't have him.

2289
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:10,720
We need the vet.

2290
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:11,640
No!

2291
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:12,520
Can't!

2292
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:13,880
Lee, come on!

2293
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:14,940
Just go.

2294
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:16,640
I won't be far behind.

2295
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:18,220
Zap him.

2296
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:19,320
Zap him!

2297
02:31:20,360 --> 02:31:20,840
Oh!

2298
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:23,000
Ah!

2299
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:23,680

2301
02:31:55,300 --> 02:31:56,380
You don't have any chance.

2302
02:31:56,680 --> 02:31:57,620
Choose Danny's fate.

2303
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:00,620
No!

2304
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:01,380
Oops.

2305
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:03,720
Wait, Clem, where did you come from?

2306
02:32:07,300 --> 02:32:07,440
No!

2307
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,540
He was a bad, bad man.

2308
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:17,560
Gotcha.

2309
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:19,140
Just go.

2310
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:21,260
I'll keep Clementine safe.

2311
02:32:25,770 --> 02:32:26,950
Why did she let her out?

2312
02:32:27,030 --> 02:32:30,150
We weren't done messing... I mean, we weren't done finishing this guy.

2313
02:32:30,590 --> 02:32:33,550
I didn't mean to say messing with him.

2314
02:32:35,290 --> 02:32:37,590
Chapter 6 of episode 2.

2315
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:57,060
Okay.

2316
02:32:58,100 --> 02:32:58,840
What's the plan?

2317
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:02,420
It's not a zombo, is it?

2318
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:07,340
This is a zombo.

2319
02:33:09,140 --> 02:33:09,820
No!

2320
02:33:18,930 --> 02:33:20,490
Carly's so awesome.

2321
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:24,010
Is everyone okay?

2322
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:26,430
We heard screams as we were coming up to the house.

2323
02:33:28,830 --> 02:33:30,090
They attacked us.

2324
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:31,030
I knew it.

2325
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:32,490
I told you we couldn't trust them.

2326
02:33:32,610 --> 02:33:33,130
Shut up, Ben.

2327
02:33:33,650 --> 02:33:34,630
How many of them are there?

2328
02:33:34,970 --> 02:33:35,570
Two left.

2329
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:36,230
Where?

2330
02:33:36,850 --> 02:33:37,570
Larry's dead.

2331
02:33:37,870 --> 02:33:40,390
They chopped off Mark's legs and tried to feed them to us.

2332
02:33:41,170 --> 02:33:41,610
Shit.

2333
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:43,790
Well, Larry's dead on his own, of course.

2334
02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:45,450
You got Duck and Kaja in the house.

2335
02:33:45,650 --> 02:33:47,150
Chelsea, thank you so much for the five kisses.

2336
02:33:47,830 --> 02:33:49,350
All right, we're coming in to help.

2337
02:33:49,650 --> 02:33:51,050
The main gate is too dangerous.

2338
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:53,550
Go around the fence and see if there's a back way in.

2339
02:33:53,830 --> 02:33:54,850
I'll keep looking for Kini.

2340
02:33:55,850 --> 02:33:56,610
Do you have a weapon?

2341
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:58,490
I don't leave home without it.

2342
02:33:58,830 --> 02:33:59,890
Yes, ma'am.

2343
02:34:00,590 --> 02:34:01,130
I love her.

2344
02:34:01,610 --> 02:34:01,950
I love her.

2345
02:34:02,070 --> 02:34:02,770
I like Carly.

2346
02:34:03,710 --> 02:34:05,010
Did he just roll his eyes?

2347
02:34:10,010 --> 02:34:12,050
No, no, please, God, no, no!

2348
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:19,160
I got a couple of coins on me.

2349
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:20,200
What happened to my taser?

2350
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,820
I'm going to take the boy and check around there.

2351
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:24,400
No, please don't take my boy.

2352
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:25,400
Let go, watch.

2353
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:27,520
Better now.

2354
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:28,940
I don't want to hurt y'all.

2355
02:34:29,700 --> 02:34:30,020
Andy?

2356
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:31,540
Danny, is that you?

2357
02:34:32,060 --> 02:34:33,500
What's going on out there?

2358
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:37,340
That is me.

2359
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:38,560
Oh, God.

2360
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:42,420
That's really funny.

2361
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:42,880
Come in.

2362
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:44,360
Let me go.

2363
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:45,220
Yeah, it's me.

2364
02:34:49,430 --> 02:34:50,190
Get back!

2365
02:34:50,390 --> 02:34:51,270
Don't come in here!

2366
02:34:51,450 --> 02:34:51,830
Vincent!

2367
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:01,520
Please!

2368
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:06,500
Please don't- You don't want to do this?

2369
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,140
Just go away and leave us be!

2370
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:10,460
Oh my god!

2371
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:11,580
Wait, but you need her!

2372
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:15,440
You need her for the cow!

2373
02:35:15,740 --> 02:35:16,020
Surprise!

2374
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:23,270
Think about what you do!

2375
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:25,250
It doesn't have to end like this!

2376
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:26,370
Thunder's going crazy.

2377
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:27,890
I'll kill her, Lee!

2378
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:29,230
Just let me go!

2379
02:35:29,290 --> 02:35:29,670
No!

2380
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:31,010
No, he's a Zombo!

2381
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:32,510
No, he's a Zombo!

2382
02:35:34,190 --> 02:35:35,890
I knew it would happen.

2383
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:36,890
Stay back!

2384
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:38,790
Don't do anything stupid!

2385
02:35:39,170 --> 02:35:42,810

2386
02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:45,430

Come on, back up!

2389
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:51,450
There she goes, there she goes.

02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:52,390

02:35:53,150 --> 02:35:53,290

02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:07,870

Who the fuck do you people think you are?

2402
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:53,170
Look at what you've done.

2403
02:36:55,230 --> 02:36:56,750
You brought this on yourself.

2404
02:36:57,010 --> 02:36:57,930
You brought this on yourself.

2405
02:36:58,270 --> 02:36:59,830
No, uh-uh, you did this.

2406
02:37:00,170 --> 02:37:03,610
All we wanted was a little gas to keep ourselves safe.

2407
02:37:10,630 --> 02:37:11,510
Oh, kill, kill, kill, kill.

2408
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:13,990

Oh,

02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:09,080

2413
02:39:09,220 --> 02:39:11,060
We'll redo it.

2414
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:15,530
Lily, help!

2415
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:53,170
This one!

2416
02:39:53,310 --> 02:39:54,110
Punch Andy.

2417
02:39:54,610 --> 02:39:55,090
This one!

2418
02:40:11,930 --> 02:40:13,250
Is that all you got, Lee?

2419
02:40:14,330 --> 02:40:16,150
I think they all went to the rescue.

2420
02:40:18,470 --> 02:40:20,810
Why were they all standing there and nobody was helping?

2421
02:40:22,690 --> 02:40:22,970
It's over!

2422
02:40:22,990 --> 02:40:24,030
Fuck you!

2423
02:40:25,870 --> 02:40:28,310
This dude is dead and mama get out here.

2424
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:32,210
You, you're all fucked.

2425
02:40:35,830 --> 02:40:37,230
They're not, I said it's over.

2426
02:40:37,530 --> 02:40:38,870
You said, it's over.

2427
02:40:39,650 --> 02:40:40,530
Just walk away.

2428
02:40:40,850 --> 02:40:42,650
Yeah, walk away, buddy.

2429
02:40:45,290 --> 02:40:48,150
Don't you dare walk away from me, Lee.

2430
02:40:50,650 --> 02:40:53,830
Why are his eyes so big and puppy dog-like all the sudden?

2431
02:40:54,030 --> 02:40:56,670
Come back here and finish this, Lee!

2432
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:04,110
Wait.

2433
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:08,730
Let's just leave.

2434
02:41:10,610 --> 02:41:12,050
Three for three?

2435
02:41:12,410 --> 02:41:15,310
Get back here and fight me like a man, Lee.

2436
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:19,050
You spared him.

2437
02:41:19,090 --> 02:41:19,910
He's alive.

2438
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:24,710
It's kind of even worse that he, uh...

2439
02:41:25,550 --> 02:41:26,270
gets to live.

2440
02:41:26,390 --> 02:41:27,530
Everyone else is dead.

2441
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:28,790
Oh, no!

2442
02:41:33,730 --> 02:41:34,710
Let's go.

2443
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:37,950
Yeah, let's go.

2444
02:41:39,150 --> 02:41:40,970
Ew, so crazy.

2445
02:41:42,850 --> 02:41:44,930
Zombie had like glowing eyes.

2446
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:47,630
Oh my god, his bomb even!

2447
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:51,510
His bomb is coming out to get him!

2448
02:41:52,130 --> 02:41:52,970
That's crazy.

2449
02:41:56,310 --> 02:41:57,710
Where's the cow?

2450
02:42:00,510 --> 02:42:02,510
Did they get to eat some biscuits?

2451
02:42:04,550 --> 02:42:06,170
It's so sad.

2452
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:14,040
Oh.

2453
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:16,740
She mad at me.

2454
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:20,960
Hey, Lee.

2455
02:42:21,460 --> 02:42:23,640
I'd say I'm sorry for leaving the motel unattended.

2456
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:25,240
But, you know.

2457
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:27,600
I'm glad you showed up when you did.

2458
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:28,120
Yeah.

2459
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:31,700
If you hadn't taken that shot at Andy, we might not have gotten out of there.

2460
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:32,160
Yeah.

2461
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:34,380
Were they really killing people?

2462
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:35,820
For food?

2463
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:37,300
Uh, yeah.

2464
02:42:38,800 --> 02:43:08,540

2465
02:43:11,960 --> 02:43:12,860
Oh, Kenny.

2466
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:13,860
How are you doing?

2467
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:15,180
I'll be fine.

2468
02:43:15,580 --> 02:43:17,580
Just not as young as I used to be.

2469
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:18,080
Kenny.

2470
02:43:19,980 --> 02:43:22,140
Hun, go on ahead and give me and Lee a second.

2471
02:43:24,020 --> 02:43:24,380
Kenny!

2472
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:29,110
There's gonna be fallout.

2473
02:43:31,630 --> 02:43:33,050
For killing Lily's dad?

2474
02:43:33,850 --> 02:43:35,790
Yeah, I would imagine so.

2475
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:37,530
What do you think?

2476
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:41,810
I'm with you.

2477
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:42,610
I'm with you, Kenny.

2478
02:43:43,210 --> 02:43:44,650
We'll do what has to be done.

2479
02:43:44,990 --> 02:43:46,050
Kenny noticed you're loyal.

2480
02:43:46,370 --> 02:43:48,950
Yeah, I'm working with you, Kenny.

2481
02:43:49,350 --> 02:43:50,710
I want you to come with us.

2482
02:43:51,230 --> 02:43:52,130
I mean it.

2483
02:43:52,430 --> 02:43:52,790
Okay.

2484
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:53,970
Yeah.

2485
02:43:54,610 --> 02:43:55,990
Yeah, I'm with you, Kenny.

2486
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,890
I'm with you, Kenny.

2487
02:43:57,670 --> 02:43:58,310
That's right.

2488
02:43:58,830 --> 02:43:59,570
That's right.

2489
02:43:59,690 --> 02:44:02,330
Lee, did you have to kill those men?

2490
02:44:05,010 --> 02:44:06,890
I'm sorry you saw that.

2491
02:44:06,950 --> 02:44:09,390
I'm sorry you had to see that, but I only did it to people.

2492
02:44:09,410 --> 02:44:19,190
protect us because they tried to hurt us yes reassuring answer okay hey dad what's that noise

2494
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:18,420
How did Ben somehow survive all this?

2495
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:20,080
And he looks like clean.

2496
02:45:20,220 --> 02:45:22,020
Like his jacket looks so clean.

2497
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:23,300
You know?

2498
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:31,980
Biggies.

2499
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:32,780
Ah.

2500
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:34,460
Oh crap.

2501
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:35,340
What?

2502
02:45:36,380 --> 02:45:38,020
Baby you gotta see this.

2503
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:38,360
Oh!

2504
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:41,360
There's a shitload of food and supplies back here.

2505
02:45:42,800 --> 02:45:43,740
Let's go?

2506
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,040
Is this a trap?

2507
02:45:47,000 --> 02:46:15,120
this food could save all of us not all of us oh my god me too I'm also rolling my eyes you don't know if these people are dead if they come back then we're just monsters who came out of the woods and ruined their lives we don't have to take all of this stuff isn't ours finders keepers we don't know don't worry about that duck it's ours now Wait,

2508
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,080
I hear footsteps.

2509
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:17,060
Don't worry.

2510
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:18,200
What if it's not?

2511
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:22,200
Well, what if it's not abandoned?

2512
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:24,080
What if it is someone's?

2513
02:46:30,150 --> 02:46:30,630
Help!

2514
02:46:32,970 --> 02:46:36,010
I think we gotta be a good example to Clementine.

2515
02:46:38,050 --> 02:46:38,830
Headlights on.

2516
02:46:38,930 --> 02:46:39,830
They haven't been gone long.

2517
02:46:39,890 --> 02:46:41,190
That's what I'm thinking, too.

2518
02:46:41,390 --> 02:46:44,370
Because, like, the car is still functional.

2519
02:46:44,510 --> 02:46:45,910
The battery hasn't died yet.

2520
02:46:46,030 --> 02:46:47,850
I think it's...

2521
02:46:48,390 --> 02:47:51,630

02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:19,790
No, no, no, we will die.

2525
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:25,540
Lee, you're going to want to see this.

2526
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:27,480
Oh, no.

2527
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:30,440
Oh, shit.

2528
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:30,820
What?

2529
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,580
Give me the news, doc.

2530
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:33,300
Wait!

2531
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:34,000
Oh.

2532
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:35,940
Ew.

2533
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:37,480
Oh, she's a warrior.

2534
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:40,560
It's not stealing if you need it is what the achievement was called.

2535
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:43,880
She's heavy breathing.

2536
02:48:51,320 --> 02:48:53,340
She was spying on it.

2537
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:56,560
Jake, Bart, Linda, and all y'all fucking sickos from the save lots.

2538
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:59,260
They call y'all bandits, but you're fucking raped.

2539
02:48:59,580 --> 02:48:59,620
What?

2540
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:02,740
Oh, darling, baby, look at you.

2541
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:04,680
Look at you.

2542
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:06,980
Oh, you need a mama, sweetheart.

2543
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:09,780
We won't let them bandits get you where we...

2544
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:10,180
No.

2545
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:11,680
Okay.

2546
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:13,200
Where's your hat?

2547
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:14,180
I don't know.

2548
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,920
Can you help me find it?

2549
02:49:16,100 --> 02:49:16,620
Oh, damn.

2550
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:18,020
This has the best mic ever.

2551
02:49:18,780 --> 02:49:20,540
I had it a couple days ago.

2552
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:22,000
Wait, so she was...

2553
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:49,500

2554
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:53,460
Uh-oh.

2555
02:49:57,740 --> 02:49:58,100
Oops.

2556
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:00,500
Next time on the locking head.

2557
02:50:00,500 --> 02:50:01,380
Megan is done, pal.

2558
02:50:01,740 --> 02:50:02,480
Ain't nothing left.

2559
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,520
We gotta get the hell out of here.

2560
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:06,720
Lee, I need you to back me up on this.

2561
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:08,620
Is this all you got?

2562
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:10,460
I told you this town is tapped.

2563
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:13,140
Do you have any idea what we had to do to get all that?

2564
02:50:14,100 --> 02:50:15,060
We need to leave.

2565
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:17,760
Duck was asking about the farm last night.

2566
02:50:17,860 --> 02:50:18,180
Duck.

2567
02:50:18,340 --> 02:50:19,080
Not much faces.

2568
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:21,120
Oh, yeah, the RV gets working.

2569
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:21,680
Let's go.

2570
02:50:21,740 --> 02:50:22,980
Oh my god, is Duck dead?

2571
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:23,580
Why?

2572
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:24,800
Why do you look like that?

2573
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:28,080
Lily's not doing so good, huh?

2574
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:29,580
Well, we killed her dad.

2575
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:31,540
We did kill her dad.

2576
02:50:32,820 --> 02:50:34,620
Maybe people out there got things lined up better.

2577
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:36,020
Better than us at least.

2578
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:38,360
Could be folks who have all this shit figured out.

2579
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:40,480
Do people get mad when they're scared?

2580
02:50:40,860 --> 02:50:41,140
Yeah.

2581
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:42,680
Sometimes, yeah, they do.

2582
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:44,260
This is crazy.

2583
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:46,400
I'm the one keeping this group going.

2584
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:47,980
We can sort this all out, alright?

2585
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:49,140
We can sort this out.

2586
02:50:49,300 --> 02:50:49,500
Okay, Lily.

2587
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:50,880
I'll tell you what we need to sort out.

2588
02:50:51,320 --> 02:50:54,800
We can't let one person fuck this up for everyone else.

2589
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:57,460
Okay, vote Ben out.

2590
02:50:58,640 --> 02:50:59,320
Long road ahead.

2591
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:00,220
Episode 3.

2592
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:02,940
Let's see.

2593
02:51:03,320 --> 02:51:04,700
Chopped off David's leg.

2594
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:06,740
Yeah, most people chopped it off.

2595
02:51:07,320 --> 02:51:08,300
Shot Jolene.

2596
02:51:08,980 --> 02:51:09,580
Yeah, wait.

2597
02:51:10,140 --> 02:51:13,060
You and 87% of players had Danny shooter, okay?

2598
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:16,080
We did kill Lily's dad.

2599
02:51:17,820 --> 02:51:19,260
Helped kill Larry.

2600
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:22,120
You and 31% of players helped kill...

2601
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:23,920
Not enough people are killing Larry.

2602
02:51:28,470 --> 02:51:31,950
what does not a majority vote there's

2603
02:51:45,990 --> 02:52:14,490
no way he was i mean it would be even worse if we were stuck in there with him no we would have been stuck in there with his zombie body 82 percent of players didn't kill both brothers that's interesting and then you and 44 percent of players didn't steal i don't do no petty theft I do grand larceny.

2604
02:52:16,110 --> 02:52:18,310
You enjoy all the killing, don't you?

2605
02:52:18,670 --> 02:52:19,850
Natural boar.

2606
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:25,480
I'm not going to steal from a car.

2607
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:27,840
I want to steal the big bucks, baby.

2608
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:33,300
I can't believe that with Larry.

2609
02:52:33,700 --> 02:52:35,160
I seriously can't believe that.

2610
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:39,260
And also, I want to kill.

2611
02:52:39,900 --> 02:52:40,800
I don't want to steal.

2612
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:42,440
I want to murder.

2613
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:47,720
You wouldn't download a car.

2614
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:53,480
We'll change the 31% to 90%.

2615
02:52:53,480 --> 02:52:56,200
Yeah, everybody get this game and get those stats up, baby.

2616
02:52:58,220 --> 02:52:59,920
Come on, we can do it.

2617
02:53:00,440 --> 02:53:04,440
If we all do it as a team, we can get these numbers high, high, high.

2618
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:06,100
Everybody kill Larry.

2619
02:53:06,660 --> 02:53:06,660
Everybody.

2620
02:53:08,340 --> 02:53:09,840
We'll take him down.

2621
02:53:14,180 --> 02:54:17,620
but seriously i don't okay you can spoil it for me if you've played this but if you don't kill larry does he survive like is she actually able to bring him back i killed larry you're a real one for that vensek no see then what's the point i say i did the right thing kenny still bonks him ah grand theft means so it's kind of illusion of choice oh she is a psychopath i'm just a vengeful ghost you know it's a loyalty check hmm I do I am kind of getting that vibe about the game I think it's more so sometimes who you well no because even I think people said that if you don't if you try to save Doug he still dies and Carly still lives it's just Carly will remember that you did not try to save her first.

2622
02:54:18,080 --> 02:54:30,640
So it is not illusion of choice per se, but there are more situations where it's kind of like a loyalty check than actually changing how the entire direction of the game goes.

2623
02:54:31,220 --> 02:54:32,920
Wait, you can save Doug?

2624
02:54:38,200 --> 02:54:43,660
Uh, uh, wait, but, wait.

2625
02:54:45,380 --> 02:54:46,580
Uh, you

2626
02:54:51,500 --> 02:54:52,600
don't be that.

2627
02:54:57,460 --> 02:55:08,980
you don't be that wait but people said that if i chose dog then it was i you can only have one of them in the group

2628
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:41,120
dog well um maybe we should have a a funeral for him it's fine i like carly i wish it could have been doug or larry easier choice but that's good too because it's all the replay replay value you know that's good too

2629
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:50,160
replay value is always a plus

2630
02:55:53,560 --> 02:56:08,240
she's been dead for a week i'm not over it i knew doug for two seconds and i liked him i still have yet to say doug in a playthrough i want to try it you should it should yeah

2631
02:56:11,820 --> 02:56:28,640
but uh yeah yeah we did top chapter two we did chapter two this one was crazy i love getting There's always... I figured they were cannibals because that's like such a zombie staple, you know?

2632
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:35,220
That's like such a zombie, like, end of the world trope.

2633
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:39,940
There's always some crazy family that becomes cannibals.

2634
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:42,660
Happens every time.

2635
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:46,400
Called it from the minute I saw them.

2636
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:51,040
Yeah, they totally had cannibal vibes.

2637
02:56:54,460 --> 02:57:54,320
like as soon as we were there i was like oh this is a cannibal farm like obviously you can be a little like suspicious of the guys at first as well but i don't know i called the cannibal it's just they just they just had that's the prions it was kind of messed up though seeing mark dead we we met we barely new mark at all we never even got to see him introduced he was just suddenly thrown into our party and then he dies like so fast cannibal core for sure yeah always talking about let's have dinner yeah exactly exactly it's my birthday in two days but i'm busy can i get a quick happy early birthday thunder happy early birthday happy happy birthday happy happy birthday to you Mark felt kind of random.

2638
02:57:55,420 --> 02:58:00,040
It felt like a guy that was literally just created to be thrown away.

2639
02:58:00,340 --> 02:58:03,080
But it was kind of also messed up seeing him as a zombie at the end.

2640
02:58:04,360 --> 02:58:06,520
He died from his...

2641
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:08,800
From getting his legs chopped off.

2642
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:10,860
This craziness.

2643
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:13,980
Hmm.

2644
02:58:14,220 --> 02:58:15,580
I did say it was people.

2645
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:17,720
I tried to warn them all.

2646
02:58:17,900 --> 02:58:19,840
Choco, taku, thank you so much for the five gift.

2647
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:20,540
Thank you!

2648
02:58:21,820 --> 02:58:22,400
Thank you, thank you.

2649
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:25,260
I tried to warn them.

2650
02:58:25,460 --> 02:58:26,200
I said, it's people.

2651
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:29,480
Why did she still take a bite?

2652
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:31,640
Oh, she was hungry.

2653
02:58:32,340 --> 02:58:32,900
I understand.

2654
02:58:34,360 --> 02:58:35,000
I get it.

2655
02:58:35,080 --> 02:58:37,520
Yeah, he was more efficient as a zombie.

2656
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:39,280
How did that happen?

2657
02:58:40,060 --> 02:58:41,680
He was finally useful.

2658
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:44,100
Logan, thank you so much for the five good to thank you.

2659
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:46,740
Yeah.

2660
02:58:48,240 --> 02:58:48,680
Yeah.

2661
02:58:51,820 --> 02:59:33,360
the entire time and then he dies and it's kind of like Larry dies and then becomes useful so we gained one person and lost two neat ducky thank you so much for the five gifted thank you I'm so not used to seeing you guys with these new awesome high profile pictures I'm not used to it at all I don't recognize you guys You're all used Everybody who changed their profile picture You look different I changed back No,

03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:55,160
on Sunday, even though it makes me sad that I'm not playing right now.

2672
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:57,460
But that's okay.

2673
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:01,380
It also was a long VOD, and I wanted to give some people time to catch up.

2674
03:01:02,460 --> 03:01:02,840
Yeah.

2675

Yes?

2679
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:15,520
Of course I do.

2680
03:01:16,820 --> 03:01:17,720
Why wouldn't I?

2681
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:48,740

I pay attention a little bit.

2685
03:02:00,400 --> 03:02:02,060
I pay attention a little bit.

2686
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:03,960
Sorry, my PFP is clippy.

2687
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:05,440

Thank you.

For the five good.

2693
03:02:14,100 --> 03:02:14,980

Welcome back.

2698
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:18,580
Thank you.

2699
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:22,560
Do you remember me?

2700
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:23,620
I remember you, Brian.

2701
03:02:24,320 --> 03:02:25,180
I remember you.

2702
03:02:25,860 --> 03:02:27,000
You can't see me.

2703
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:28,540
I'm invisible.

2704
03:02:31,760 --> 03:02:32,360
Corey, man.

2705
03:02:32,460 --> 03:02:33,480
Thank you for the pocket today.

2706
03:02:34,760 --> 03:02:36,040
I'll remember that.

2707
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:36,480
Okay.

2708
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:38,360
Remember it.

2709
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:41,180
I caved and bought Delta last night.

2710
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:42,680
Oh, the collector's edition.

2711
03:02:42,780 --> 03:02:43,980
I bought it, too.

2712
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:49,320
At first, I was just like, if I don't get the terrarium, I don't care.

2713
03:02:50,520 --> 03:02:52,120
And then I saw and I was like,

2714
03:02:58,420 --> 03:02:59,900
I think I would.

2715
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:06,740
Reminder from your Oshi to change your PFP on the daily.

2716
03:03:06,860 --> 03:03:07,160
No!

2717
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:08,660
Don't do it!

2718
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:11,080
Congrats on another episode.

2719
03:03:11,240 --> 03:03:11,340
Clear.

2720
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:13,120
Did a little digging choices in this remaster.

2721
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:14,760
It was a different system than the original game.

2722
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:15,180
Oh.

2723
03:03:15,560 --> 03:03:18,300
Would explain why it looks like the majority wanted to save Larry.

2724
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:21,280
Oh.

2725
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:22,240
Oh.

2726
03:03:23,420 --> 03:03:23,940
Interesting.

2727
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:25,280
I remember you.

2728
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:27,840
You remember me?

2729
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:28,560
Are you sure?

2730
03:03:28,980 --> 03:03:30,260
Chai Princess, thank you!

2731
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:33,460
Sorry I don't have an actual PFP.

2732
03:03:33,900 --> 03:03:34,760
That also...

2733
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:36,440
I remember that too, though.

2734
03:03:38,540 --> 03:03:40,380
Like, I remember the big day.

2735
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:43,180
I hope my kamiyoshi is doing well today.

2736
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:44,520
Maximino!

2737
03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:45,660
Thank you!

2738
03:03:46,740 --> 03:03:47,720
Welcome back.

2739
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:49,340
You sent my PFP.

2740
03:03:50,420 --> 03:03:52,500
It is scary.

2741
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:55,960
I don't like tiny faces.

2742
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:05,090
Well, this was fun.

2743
03:04:05,550 --> 03:04:10,150
Do you remember the 21st night of September?

2744
03:04:10,930 --> 03:04:12,170
Oh my gosh, we're almost there.

2745
03:04:13,290 --> 03:04:15,250
We're almost to the 21st night of September.

2746
03:04:16,750 --> 03:04:20,530
It has almost been one year since the GG Reckoning.

2747
03:04:25,270 --> 03:04:27,770
I can't believe it.

2748
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:35,190
See Alan, thank you so much for the fact it did.

2749
03:04:35,650 --> 03:04:36,870
Glad you're playing more of a zombie game.

2750
03:04:37,130 --> 03:04:38,350
Rip Dennis though, yeah.

2751
03:04:38,790 --> 03:04:39,710
Missed that guy.

2752
03:04:42,270 --> 03:04:45,030
Thank you guys for the game today.

2753
03:04:45,290 --> 03:04:45,930
I hope you had fun.

2754
03:04:46,490 --> 03:04:48,770
I will see you guys when I see you next.

2755
03:04:49,810 --> 03:04:50,750
Dwarago, thank you.

2756
03:04:51,570 --> 03:04:52,830
I was about to eat, oh wait.

2757
03:04:53,690 --> 03:04:59,410
For what it's worth, if someone ran into a room on a sus farm when I was about to eat unknown meat and screamed its people, I would at least pause.

2758
03:05:00,590 --> 03:05:01,770
Why is she ate?

2759
03:05:02,190 --> 03:05:02,790
She was hungry.

2760
03:05:03,150 --> 03:05:03,470
She was hungry.

2761
03:05:03,650 --> 03:05:04,250
We can't blame.

2762
03:05:04,610 --> 03:05:06,190
We cannot blame Clementine.

2763
03:05:07,550 --> 03:05:09,390
Phil, thank you so much for the 50 gifts.

2764
03:05:09,850 --> 03:05:10,190
Thank you.

2765
03:05:10,690 --> 03:05:11,870
Thank you, thank you.

2766
03:05:13,010 --> 03:05:17,910
Well, I hope you all have a wonderful day, a wonderful night, a wonderful time zone.

2767
03:05:18,810 --> 03:05:22,210
And I will see you when I see you next.

2768
03:05:22,410 --> 03:05:25,910
Also, also, also, thank you, everybody.

2769
03:05:26,790 --> 03:05:27,530
Everybody, thank you.

2770
03:05:27,790 --> 03:05:28,690
Thank you, thank you.

2771
03:05:29,090 --> 03:05:29,350
Thank you.

2772
03:05:30,590 --> 03:05:31,470
Bye bye!

2773
03:05:31,850 --> 03:05:32,650
Bye bye!

2774
03:05:32,890 --> 03:05:33,450
Bye bye!

2775
03:05:33,670 --> 03:05:34,230
Thank you!

2776
03:05:34,270 --> 03:05:34,810
Thanks for watching!

2777
03:05:34,910 --> 03:05:35,550
Thanks for hanging out!

2778
03:05:35,830 --> 03:05:36,350
Bye bye!
