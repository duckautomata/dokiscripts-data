1
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,640
I keep hearing this song.

2
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,400
And for some reason it sounds like the Royals.

3
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,520
Will never be Royals.

4
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,380
You can call me Queen Bee.

5
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
My wife.

6
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,960
Hi, Orca.

7
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,220
Do you hear it here?

8
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,860
There's...

9
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,360
Will never be Royals.

10
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
Hold on.

11
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,280
Sounds like V-Tuber, V-GF.

12
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,920
See, you hear it.

13
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,620
Hey, Raya.

14
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,180
No.

15
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,580
Did I make this up?

16
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
Maybe I'm gaslighting myself.

17
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,840
Wait.

18
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,720
No, you hear it.

19
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,020
No, you hear it.

20
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,740
Somebody, you hear it.

21
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
I don't...

22
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,660
Here, here!

23
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,170
This sock doesn't do it at all.

24
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,010
I'm the one inserting it.

25
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,190
Oh my gosh.

26
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,570
Guys, I'm sick and I'm sick in the head, okay?

27
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,210
I'm sick and I'm sick in the head.

28
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,250
Don't blame me.

29
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,270
Jeez.

30
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,030
You are making fun of a sick lady.

31
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,720
You're making fun of a sick lady.

32
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,680
Um, I'm a little sick.

33
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm a little sick.

34
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,640
I have a bit of a cold, but I'm feeling so much better.

35
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,500
And you would think, um, you're dead?

36
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,880
How do you have a cold?

37
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,660
Um.

38
00:06:48,300 --> 00:07:18,220
you are not living why why and I would like to say don't die well if you die if you die don't become a ghost sucks the afterlife sickness yeah yeah so I'm a little sicky Don't get too close to me.

39
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,220
Don't get too close to me.

40
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,660
Or you'll get sick too.

41
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,380
Look at all the rubber duckies in the pool.

42
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,340
Too late?

43
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,560
Oh, no!

44
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,500
You'll just hear me sniffling and coughing sometimes.

45
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,000
Probably.

46
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,300
I want to get sick too.

47
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,020
Why?

48
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,610
It has been just a minor inconvenience for me.

49
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,150
Sure, man.

50
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,890
So, honestly, it hasn't been so bad.

51
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,470
Just a minor inconvenience.

52
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,710
But, actually, no, I lied.

53
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,690
It's been a major inconvenience.

54
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,690
Because I want to play Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta.

55
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,370
And I can't.

56
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,830
Because I was not feeling good that day.

57
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,130
And I have to wait until Saturday.

58
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,190
Well, I don't have to.

59
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,570
But I chose it.

60
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,190
Because I was like, Oh wait, what have I played on Saturday?

61
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,310
That's so nostalgic for Metal Gear Saturdays.

62
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,530
So, after my meet and greets at Vexpo, I'm going to play.

63
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,150
Why not today?

64
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,330
Uh, I have some meetings.

65
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,210
Actually, I have a meeting tonight.

66
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,390
I have a meeting tomorrow.

67
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,130
So that I can't, I don't want to play all day as much as I want.

68
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,490
Yeah.

69
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,950
Yeah.

70
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,810
Yeah, so...

71
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,370
Yeah, I've been busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

72
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,850
Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

73
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,590
But...

74
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,490
And I have expo this weekend.

75
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,590
If you're going, I have a maid cafe collab.

76
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,070
So you can go there.

77
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,730
And try my food.

78
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,750
And then I also have a free meet and greet.

79
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,230
Uh, at the Vaiso booth.

80
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,930
I will be there.

81
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,190
One of my super chasks got cancelled because my credit card...

82
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,210
No!

83
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,570
So, okay.

84
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,710
I didn't do a charge back.

85
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,030
Oh, no.

86
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,710
I never checked that.

87
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,030
I don't know.

88
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,350
YouTube does that?

89
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,850
I don't know.

90
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,030
What if you do send a super chas and then you charge back?

91
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,390
Does it work?

92
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,830
I actually have no idea.

93
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,830
Didn't win your meet and greet.

94
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,350
Win?

95
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,210
Win?

96
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,050
Wait, was it like a lottery?

97
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,500
I think some smaller streamers got their channels deleted from that recently.

98
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,000
Scary!

99
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Scary, scary!

100
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,840
Minto's meet and greet is...

101
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
one of the lottery ones.

102
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,720
I don't know.

103
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
I don't think mine had a lottery.

104
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,260
I think it's just first come, first serve.

105
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,540
I think.

106
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,120
I can't believe it's already September.

107
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,460
Happy September!

108
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,380
It's kind of, well, I know summer is over at the end of this month and it's still quite hot.

109
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,380
It's still quite hot.

110
00:10:50,300 --> 00:11:11,500
So I thought, well, we can still do a little bit of a summer summer some some fun time if you guys you know and oh wait I saw someone say about the glasses the duckies have it's kind of like my glasses let me put mine on one

111
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:26,560
moment please oh my gosh wait I really look like I'm ready for summer now

112
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,360
I look like I'm so ready for summer.

113
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,640
And my outfit is cozy for home, but it could be...

114
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,300
It could be a summer outfit.

115
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm wearing a tank top.

116
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,400
You don't wear those.

117
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:56,910
I...

118
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,210
Wet t-shirt contest.

119
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,450
Yep.

120
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,570
Yep.

121
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,240
Oh my gosh.

122
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,400
I want to build the best water park ever.

123
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,580
Actually, I've been thinking a lot recently.

124
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
I was like, man, I don't really want to go to a water park.

125
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,260
But they're kind of disgusting, no?

126
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Oh, there it is.

127
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,440
Yeah, rubber ducks look like you're wearing your glasses.

128
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,460
Yeah, I know I saw it somewhere.

129
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,060
Thanks, Daki.

130
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,200
Thank you for the donut.

131
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, I want to go to a water park, but they're so...

132
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,680
I think I would get COVID-2025.

133
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,100
If I went, I would, I would get mega COVID 2025.

134
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,870
So, yeah, it would be a new strain.

135
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,750
It would, it would fuse with like Ebola or something.

136
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,870
It would just become the world's most powerful disease ever.

137
00:13:13,110 --> 00:14:11,990

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,650
Takizo, thank you so much for the vibe.

Good to thank you.

143
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,230
Mega COVID-2025 sounds like a monster car rally.

144
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,010
Does.

145
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,630
But yeah.

146
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,350
So I'm kind of pale.

147
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:37,810
Sorry.

148
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,350
Sorry.

149
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm dead.

150
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,610
What are you...

151
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,330
You think there's blood in these...

152
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,370
In these arms?

153
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,210
I don't think so.

154
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,090
I don't think so.

155
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,850
No trauma dumping at the water park.

156
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,050
Yeah, my bad.

157
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,970
Wait, let's set up our water park.

158
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,370
Let's do it.

159
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,210
Oh, where?

160
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,750
We get to name our park!

161
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,910
Hmm...

162
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,620
Do you think a lot of people would come to Shadow Moses?

163
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,900
It sounds like there's a lot of shade and it's kind of...

164
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,560
Nice.

165
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,780
Maybe...

166
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Maybe...

167
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,940
Why are you...

168
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,340
Why are you Dexter's dad?

169
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Thank you so much for the get-thin.

170
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,540
Nature since I went to the water park.

171
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,980
And kind of don't want to.

172
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,580
Watering so many people.

173
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,200
Now I haven't been to a water park in a long time either.

174
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,160
Stucky, thanks for the five get-thin!

175
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,460
Thank you.

176
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,680
Patio Moses.

177
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,720
Probably very cold though.

178
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,660
Yeah, you're right.

179
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,380
That's Alaska.

180
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,940
Shadow Moses is Alaska.

181
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,440
It

182
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,050
was my birthday the other day.

183
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,230
I saved my wish for you to get better.

184
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,830
Okay, well, sir.

185
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,110
Karin, did it.

186
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,210
Happy birthday!

187
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,650
Happy, happy birthday.

188
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,110
Double, thanks so much for the fine goodness.

189
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,750
Sunny Moses.

190
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,750
Otakon's wet jeans.

191
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,690
What if it's like...

192
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,890
Your jeans are gonna get wet here.

193
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:28,730
Wait.

194
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,970
Oh wait, I can't do a winky face.

195
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,970
Don't... Don't wear them.

196
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,320
Summer Moses Island.

197
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,420
Zanzibar... Zanzibar...

198
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,980
Wait, that's kinda cute.

199
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,820
Zanzibar Land.

200
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,860
Luffy Gore, thanks for the vibe, good day!

201
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,960
Okay.

202
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Zanzibar land.

203
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,040
Whoa.

204
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,160
Whoa.

205
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,180
Wait.

206
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,020
Oh, gosh.

207
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,760
This game.

208
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,600
Okay, hold on.

209
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,540
One moment, please.

210
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,420
It just went full screen on me for no reason.

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,220
I'll read this real quick.

212
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,880
New day, new life.

213
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,380
You quit your hated job and use your last savings to chase a dream.

214
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,760
You bought an old abandoned water park.

215
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,040
Can you restore it to its former glory or will it fail?

216
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,880
Just like it did under its previous owners.

217
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,340
Okay, one moment, please.

218
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,380
Hold on.

219
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,080
Let's see.

220
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,740
Wait, it still says that it's windowed.

221
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,940
And 1440.

222
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,660
Hello?

223
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,040
Gabe?

224
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,960
Wait, one moment, please.

225
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,530
Maybe if I redo it like this.

226
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,470
Okay.

227
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,890
Windowed.

228
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,190
No!

229
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,490
Why is it good?

230
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,380
Uh...

231
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,960
Sorry for the scuff, everybody.

232
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,040
Okay, I fixed it though.

233
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
Let me fix me here.

234
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,060
Why is this always happen?

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,640
Why does this always happen to me?

236
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,900
Kids are cruel, Minto.

237
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,140
Okay.

238
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,260
Oh.

239
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,300
Oh.

240
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,620
There we go.

241
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,320
Wait, why is it so it's...

242
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,320
Why is it like that?

243
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,280
Why is it cut off?

244
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,220
How bizarre.

245
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,040
Okay, I don't care.

246
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,100
One moment, please.

247
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
I gotta fix you guys too.

248
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,740
Sorry, I'm fixing everything.

249
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,520
Fixy, fix, fix, fix.

250
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,100
I hate when games do that when you're like...

251
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,680
Go to the next screen and they're like, okay, I'm gonna undo all your settings.

252
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,900
How bizarre?

253
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,960
How bizarre?

254
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,320
How bizarre?

255
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,140
Minto's bizarre water park.

256
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,100
Wow!

257
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,800
Wait, this is like the most random location.

258
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,600
I look like... I look like I'm crazy.

259
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,220
Hello, Dallas.

260
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh!

261
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Oh!

262
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,940
Blanking Minto equals Q.

263
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,320
Oh, thank you for the hotness over!

264
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,300
Do you think he'll come to my park now?

265
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,340
Why me?

266
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,500
Get inside.

267
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,420
Get in...

268
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh, use the sledgehammer to clear the entrance.

269
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,300
They could just give me the keys, no?

270
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,840
Whoa!

271
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,900
Okay.

272
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,250
What a mess!

273
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,510
This dusty, broken-down water park has definitely seen some better days.

274
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,650
This is not a water park.

275
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,470
This is a...

276
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:44,190
pool and he just walks away just tis a flesh wound first let's clear out all the old buildings use your sledgehammer to demolish old buildings I'm insane this is not a water park oh wait you see a slide over there oh what happened What happened to me?

277
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,250
I jumped with too much force.

278
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,190
Initial sledgehammer use...

279
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,530
Was based?

280
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,550
No.

281
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,930
It's a crime.

282
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,050
Minto gets hammer, instant crime.

283
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,570
It's the horny hammer for you all.

284
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,610
Bam!

285
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,410
Bam!

286
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,160
Requires a trash bag.

287
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,880
Oh, destroy- I'm destroying this?

288
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Still not there.

289
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,240
Not exactly five-star cleanliness, huh?

290
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,740
Trash is everywhere, and let's be real.

291
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,080
No one's lining up to relax next to a pile of old...

292
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,500
Why did I get rid of the pool?

293
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,540
It's my one attraction!

294
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,480
Waterpark sim or insane?

295
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,140
Slashhammerman sim.

296
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,640
Grab a trash bag, clean up the mess, and toss it all by holding right click into the dumpster.

297
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,320
Whoa.

298
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,020
Nobody's gonna come here.

299
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,860
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,640
Destroy!

301
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,260
Destroy!

302
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,080
So I get trash.

303
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,180
Oh, over here.

304
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,340
Okay.

305
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,200
Trash.

306
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,880
I really wanted something kind of...

307
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,900
Oh, throw away the trash.

308
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,920
Oh, is it full?

309
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,080
Okay.

310
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:23,560
I wanted something kind of chill today since I'm a little, you know, a little icky-sicky, you know.

311
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,760
Use your hands to remove newspapers from the entrance window.

312
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,320
Okay.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,260
Nice throw.

314
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,780
I got a 10 out of 10 for that.

315
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,640
Life ring.

316
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
Staff leaderboard.

317
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,940
Oh no, my sledgehammer.

318
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,780
Oh, whoa.

319
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,620
Wow.

320
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,360
Whoa.

321
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,200
Wait.

322
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,380
Why are there so many boxes?

323
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,660
Oh, these here.

324
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,240
Clear.

325
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,420
Wait, whatever.

326
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,820
Use my hands.

327
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,100
Okay, I have those.

328
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,220
Ah!

329
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,410
I use the force.

330
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,110
Building your park.

331
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,250
I didn't have a water park without a pool.

332
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,470
Yeah, we destroyed it for some reason.

333
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,390
Each pool you build raises the number of max guests your park can have.

334
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,610
Press B to open the building menu.

335
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,350
Select a rusty pool.

336
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,590
No, I don't want a rusty pool.

337
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,290
It was a dirty pool.

338
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,150
I didn't have clean nerves.

339
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,070
I need to stream on my birthday, Abby!

340
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,850
Five, six, happy birthday!

341
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,430
Happy birthday.

342
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,430
Hit it with your hammer a couple times to build it.

343
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,070
Enjoy the first splash.

344
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,750
I love these guys.

345
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,470
We really are twinning!

346
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,730
He's seen better days.

347
00:23:59,330 --> 00:23:59,850
Me too.

348
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,010
Cannonball!

349
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,950
I lived!

350
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,330
Wow.

351
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:07,850
Okay.

352
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,750
We are building a pool.

353
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,830
Building a pool.

354
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,010
Building a pool.

355
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,230
I want to get rid of some of this trash first though.

356
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,610
Okay, hold on.

357
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,110
One moment.

358
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,070
We still have more trash here.

359
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,850
Let's finish cleaning up.

360
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,110
In fact, let's like get rid of everything.

361
00:24:26,230 --> 00:25:00,730
Well, not everything, but you know, like let's make the most space that we can because like get rid of these you know so that we can have the biggest amount of room for our pool those chairs are garbage too I think so oh I can destroy them no way decided to play along with you and glitched outside the for the first few minutes press double space that's what Oh,

363
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,530
I see.

364
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,190
How do you glitch outside?

365
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,430
There's a streamer I like.

366
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,810
He was playing this yesterday.

367
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,150
I didn't watch so much of it because I was like, oh, this seems kind of fun.

368
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,510
And then I...

369
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,630
I do want to say another VTuber is playing this at the same time as me.

370
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:58,190
And it was an absolute coincidence my bad I was like what can I play that's kind of chill today oh streamer I like is playing this I'll play it too oopsie but I think this is like the hot streamer game right now because I think I saw a review on here on steam that like KSO played it so you'll probably see more people end up playing this game

371
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,990
You'll probably see more people end up playing it.

372
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,060
Okay, I think we...

373
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,820
Let me throw away my garbage.

374
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,300
Nice, throw 9 out of 10.

375
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay, okay.

376
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,800
Wait, can I see myself?

377
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,340
Oh!

378
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,280
Oh!

379
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,400
I dominate the first pool.

380
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,580
Ponzi pool!

381
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,000
It's just a summer game of the year or something.

382
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,760
Oh, yeah.

383
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,500
Wait, there's more over here, too.

384
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,820
I like how I'm...

385
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,520
What am I doing?

386
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,720
Whoa.

387
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm swimming.

388
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,780
I've become one with the pool.

389
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,180
When you...

390
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,240
When you pool hard enough, life becomes a pool.

391
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,120
You know?

392
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,220
You don't have to worry about anything.

393
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,780
Except drowning, I suppose.

394
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,960
Let's get another look.

395
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,740
I should have stuck with our first.

396
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,880
Why am I so old?

397
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,500
Why did I...

398
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,320
Can I change anything?

399
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,440
Oh no.

400
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,600
This is good enough.

401
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,260
Wait, how do I get out of...

402
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,560
Wait, I don't want to be in third person anymore.

403
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,060
Get me out of here!

404
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:33,720
No!

405
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,840
How do I get out of third person?

406
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,760
Uh-oh.

407
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,920
Uh-oh.

408
00:27:50,420 --> 00:28:10,180

look at all these potential customers!

410
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,170
Nikolai!

411
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,290
You've been selected!

412
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,320
Oh, hit visitor with a boxing glove.

413
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Dallas is back!

414
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,200
Okay, anyway.

415
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,740
How do I put this away?

416
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
Uh, drop?

417
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,080
Is there a...

418
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,440
Hold on.

419
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,360
Oh, drop item Q.

420
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,420
Flyer.

421
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,880
Oh, that costs money.

422
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,460
Did it say...

423
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,560
Oh, oh, okay.

424
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,480
Flyers are five bucks.

425
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,640
Time adult.

426
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,940
Teen set.

427
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,520
Okay, let me...

428
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Hold on.

429
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,520
Press Bui.

430
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,180
Okay, we are...

431
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,900
We're building a pool, everybody.

432
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,000
Ooh, I got my little drone.

433
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,500
Oh, my gosh.

434
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,820
I want to go everywhere.

435
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,640
Okay.

436
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,980
We're going to build ourselves a rusty pool.

437
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,940
Oh, it's small.

438
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,120
Use the hammer on the placed pool blueprint to build it.

439
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,380
Oh, it's crooked!

440
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,020
It's fine.

441
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,060
Oh, it's like really shallow.

442
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,560
Oh my gosh.

443
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,080
Is the boxing glove special available at the maid cafe?

444
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,000
You want that?

445
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
What's this?

446
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:30,880
Close.

447
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,300
Oh!

448
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,440
Oh!

449
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,160
Oh gosh!

450
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,580
Okay.

451
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,100
Press B on the building menu and place a diving board.

452
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,200
I don't think...

453
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
I don't think that's safe.

454
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,320
Can I move it?

455
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,440
Oh, oh, I can!

456
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,300
Oh my gosh, we can fix it, everybody.

457
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,680
Fix it, Minto.

458
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,700
Fix it, Minto.

459
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,280
I don't think a diving board is, like, really easy.

460
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:56,800
Okay.

461
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,820
How do I place it?

462
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,300
Oh, I place it, like, here.

463
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,620
Is that...

464
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,340
That doesn't seem correct.

465
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,480
Okay.

466
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,620
Make it super high.

467
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,780
From over here, you have to...

468
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,460
You have to jump.

469
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,100
From all the way in the bushes.

470
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,800
I believe in you.

471
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,580
We'll just put it right there.

472
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,860
That seems kind of far away, no?

473
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,820
Did you guys ever...

474
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,760
I used to...

475
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,180
When I did swimming, I would dive from the really, really tall ones.

476
00:31:38,280 --> 00:32:04,580
like the super tall now I don't think I could I would be too scared but as a wee whisp I was fearless does this work it doesn't look like it's close enough no you can't swim I think that's such an important thing though always learn how to swim

477
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:35,260

This is why you should learn how to How to swim!

480
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,080
Take the ladder out!

481
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,920
I'm dripping wet!

482
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,120
They'll know that the park works.

483
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,840
Thunder Adelos, thank you so much for the for the 10 gifted.

484
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,260
It was very hydrodynamic.

485
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,060
Wait, how do I turn it on?

486
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:08,780
Oh.

487
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,920
Bing bong!

Wait.

Time?

491
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,300
Add time.

492
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,120
What does that mean?

493
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,020
How do I make the park?

494
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,780
Oh, here!

495
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,000
Whoa!

496
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay.

497
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,580

Okay, they're gonna be...

499
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,660
They're gonna be scrambling to get in here.

500
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,820
Oh my gosh!

501
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,780
Denver, you're...

502
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,520

Okay.

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,000
Wait.

505
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,460
Oh, that's the time.

506
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,840
How do I give you a ticket?

507
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, ticket.

508
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,560
There you go.

509
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,460
Young man.

510
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,660
Mariah, you're an adult?

511
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,040

Enjoy the pool.

514
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,240
What?

515
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,140
What did I give you?

516
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
You gave the wrong ticket.

517
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,640
Adult!

518
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,040
Price 8.

519
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,940
Oh, for 6 hours!

520
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:15,540
Oh!

521
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,480
Oops.

522
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,880
There you go.

523
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,160
There you go.

524
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,680
Thanks, Erin.

525
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,360
Why are you in there for...

526
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,920
This for 6 hours?

527
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,260
Ruth, here you go.

528
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,160
Ticket cheaters!

529
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,380
A guest has sneaked into the park without a valid ticket.

530
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,600
You can spot them quite easy.

531
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,600
They're missing a bracelet.

532
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,980
Push them out with right click to send a message.

533
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,680
I just only allowed like two people into my park.

534
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:48,880
You?

535
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,120
No, you have a wristband.

536
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,420
You have a wristband.

537
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,640
I should have sledgehammered him.

538
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,340
Yes, occasionally leave puddles of water.

539
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,300
Yeah, those dry in the sun.

540
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,720
Grab your trusty mop and clean them up before someone takes a tumble.

541
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,340
Oh, where's...

542
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,600
Kade will learn to follow the law.

543
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,520
Oh, he just said, ow.

544
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,650
Um, what was I doing?

545
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:33,690
Oh.

546
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,190
Oh!

547
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,880
Okay, uh, the mop is over here.

548
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
We gotta avoid the puddles.

549
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,320
Waterpark simulator is shocking and violent.

550
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:49,780
Stop!

551
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,940
He's already dead!

552
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,000
If you lost, if you drop or lose a tool, don't panic.

553
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,380
Tool shed always keeps them safe.

554
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,380
Okay.

555
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,040
La la.

556
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,140
Who came over here to get a puddle so crazy?

557
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,460
Also, why is our place not, like, slip-proof, you know?

558
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,740
Is this what it's like to really own a water park?

559
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,660
Zach, welcome back.

560
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,380
Thank you.

561
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
It sends a message.

562
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,260
I don't know, I can't supply those.

563
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,440
They have to bring them themselves.

564
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,000
Swimming is just the beginning.

565
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,800
Slides are real.

566
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,500
Yes.

567
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,120
Slides are the real stars of the water park.

568
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,880
Yes, yes, yes.

569
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,520
But not everyone's a thrill seeker.

570
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,240
Make sure to check if guests want a slide pass.

571
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,500
A slide pass?

572
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,800
That's not included in the fee to get into the park?

573
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm, I'm, I'm squeezing every penny out of these people.

574
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,840
What the heck?

575
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,280
Oh my gosh!

576
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,420
Hellscape.

577
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,820
Offer the wrong ticket and they'll turn around and leave.

578
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:09,800
Okay.

579
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,280
We don't want that.

580
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,140
Look at their spending money while they're swimming.

581
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,080
Look at them go.

582
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,140
Look at them go.

583
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,260
Wow.

584
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,860
I'm watching a human zoo.

585
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,740
Wow.

586
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,400
Erin's got cake.

587
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,760
Okay, Erin.

588
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,860
Oh, not again!

589
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,640
Oh, Erin!

590
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,500
Erin, family guide pose.

591
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,860
No, don't leave!

592
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,180
Please don't leave.

593
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,420
Please love my park.

594
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,960
Human aquarium.

595
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Erin, don't leave.

596
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,460
Oh, oh.

597
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,960
Go, Ruth, go!

598
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,240
You can do it!

599
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,580
You have to pay to use the diving board!

600
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,510
No way.

601
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,430
Business, minto business.

602
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,640
Energy zero.

603
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,380
Okay, you can leave them.

604
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,140
You can leave.

605
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Why are you paying more money?

606
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,640
Wait, did you not pay to get inside?

607
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,600
What?

608
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,640
Oh wait, I have to build a slide.

609
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,620
Rusty slide.

610
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,180
I forgot.

611
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,220
Oh, this is kind of terrible.

612
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,000
Okay, here we go.

613
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,100
Uh, how do I...

614
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,540
Okay, like, like that.

615
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,520
There we go.

616
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,580
Oh, yeah.

617
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,020
Okay.

618
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,500
Everybody, new attraction.

619
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,540
And three, two, one.

620
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,160
Ta-da!

621
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,800
Epic Universe is now open!

622
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,260
Oh, my gosh.

623
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:59,080
I've seen endless, and I mean endless videos about Halloween horror nights this year.

624
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:33,620
the terrifier house and how there's the wet part and the dry part and i've seen everything about the cat lady and i've seen everything about five nights of freddies i've seen so many videos from chill to relief running around a water park is fun but even the most energetic guests need a break set up comfy loungers for relaxation to make sure the toilets are nearby for when nature calls tired or desperate guests won't stay long Or they won't stay clean!

625
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,260
Is that shit in my pool?

626
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,240
No, and trash!

627
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,040
Oh my gosh, we need a bathroom pronto!

628
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,120
Okay, wait.

629
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,020
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

630
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,520
Here, we'll put it in the shade.

631
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,560
There's only three people, so we'll give them three.

632
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
Where's the...

633
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,220
Where's the...

634
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,380
Facilities!

635
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,160
Oh no!

636
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,600
Wait, I can't build a pot yet.

637
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,380
I need to clean up this pool and garbage.

638
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,180
Oh, sorry.

639
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,960
Oh, so sorry.

640
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,320
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

641
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,820
Take that.

642
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,340
Wait, grab that.

643
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,780
How am I supposed to clean this up?

644
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,980
Oh, I did it with my bare hands.

645
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,420
Okay, Aaron, let's not be dramatic.

646
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,120
Oh, she's asleep.

647
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,520
Okay, that's fine.

648
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,420
One moment.

649
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,460
A four-hour pass for a teen.

650
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,100
There you are, Kade.

651
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,260
What?

652
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,240
What did I do wrong?

653
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,540
Oh, did he want to slide?

654
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,660
Was that my bad?

655
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,420
Oops.

656
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,000
No space.

657
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,860
Oh, I have it already.

658
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,450
Pass, I didn't notice it.

659
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,510
Oopsie!

660
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,870
I'm not gonna make any money.

661
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,670
These people only have two dollars.

662
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,150
New research point.

663
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,530
Wait, hold on, hold on.

664
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:34,950
Aaron!

665
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,410
Damn, Aaron.

666
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,150
Okay.

667
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,310
You didn't wash your hands after cleaning the poop.

668
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,130
I didn't mean to.

669
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,390
They're putting more garbage.

670
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,710
I'm gonna ban these people.

671
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,850
Oh, we need the rusty toilet.

672
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,390
Okay, now we can build it.

673
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:54,610
Okay.

674
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,790
We'll put it, like, right here.

675
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,810
Right here.

676
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,610
Should be good enough.

677
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,170
They have to pay a dollar to lay down?

678
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,230
I can't believe this.

679
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,030
I am a true entrepreneur.

680
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,550
Why is there so much dirt falling?

681
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,350
I don't...

682
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,510
They go and they, like, roll around in the grass, like, dog.

683
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,050
because they don't have towels.

684
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,270
One more guess.

685
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,750
Oh, the flyers.

686
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,110
Okay.

687
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,050
You just go give it to them.

688
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:26,750
Okay.

689
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,970
You just go give them flyers.

690
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,130
Hello.

691
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,340
Take flyer, take flyer, take flyer.

692
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,200
Oh!

693
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh.

694
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,720
I don't even need to do anything.

695
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,560
Hello, Jeremiah.

696
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,360
You would like a teen pass for four hours?

697
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,160
You don't want to eat.

698
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,120
use our slide?

699
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,780
Are you sure?

700
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,220
Hello?

701
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,540
Slide pass.

702
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,260
I see it.

703
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,740
Four hours teen.

704
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,420
Okay.

705
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,260
The water looks.

706
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,100
It looks great.

707
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,140
What are you talking about?

708
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,180
Hello.

709
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,200
Hello?

710
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,440
Slide pass.

711
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,460
Adult.

712
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,340
Okay.

713
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,380
Can I see your ID?

714
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,720
I got a baby face.

715
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,040
Ruby.

716
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,240
Senior.

717
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,320
Slide pass.

718
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:21,860
Damn.

719
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,440
Ruby.

720
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,640
She's living on the wild side.

721
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:27,800
Grandma.

722
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,600
Okay.

723
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,500
Alright, let's go get some more people.

724
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,720
Uh.

725
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:39,740
Ew.

726
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,060
Ew.

727
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:42,800
Hello?

728
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:43,820
Here.

729
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,820
Would you like this?

730
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,220
Oh, whoa.

731
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,200
This?

732
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh.

733
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,100
Immediate.

734
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,500
Hello.

735
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,800
Would you like to come to my park?

736
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,180
Oh, yeah.

737
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:55,440
Okay.

738
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:55,860
Okay.

739
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,760
Everyone is peeing in the pool.

740
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,700
Wait, don't they're not?

741
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:01,940
Wait, are they?

742
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,040
Are they peeing in my pool?

743
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,340
Of the world's...

744
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,780
No.

745
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,800
I can't tell, actually.

746
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,300
Hi, Desko.

747
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,760
The guest is waiting to buy a ticket.

748
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,560
I'm so sorry.

749
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:17,960
Hello.

750
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,180
Slide pass.

751
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,940
Team for eight hours.

752
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,440
Okay.

753
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,880
A teen.

754
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,560
You're gonna become the most tan person ever.

755
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,980
Oh, yeah, I gave you a teen pass for four hours.

756
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,940
What if I accidentally give them the slide pass, but they're excited?

757
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,540
Would they get excited about it, you think?

758
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,920
That's some stamina.

759
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,480
That's what I'm saying.

760
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,420
Holy moly.

761
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,100
Oh!

762
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,620
Sick.

763
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,500
Okay.

764
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,220
Oh, shoot.

765
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,060
We got a mop.

766
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,940
People are...

767
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,260
Just trying to use the force.

768
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,940
Having the puddle right in front of the seat is kind of evil.

769
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,740
Damn, Ruby, you got tan!

770
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,240
We gotta clean up more trash, everybody.

771
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,720
I just saved her life, I really did.

772
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,680
Wait, do I have to clean out?

773
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,560
Why is it like an old-fashioned porta potty?

774
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,840
Excuse me, everybody, excuse me.

775
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,260
Management coming through.

776
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,580
Is this supposed to be my rating?

777
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,380
Does a park in Oregon where you have to pay for every single ride you go on?

778
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,500
What?

779
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,700
No way.

780
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,000
It's called an outhouse.

781
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,820
We're in 2025.

782
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:47,920
Alright.

783
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:48,880
Eevee!

784
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,560

785
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,580
For four hours.

786
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,800
I can't wait till I can hire staff to do all this menial...

787

We're fine.

789
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:29,820
Everything's fine.

790
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,500
I got your gamer subs cup.

791
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,880
I've been enjoying using the different flavors to change your color.

792
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,080
Thank you.

793
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,120
Thank you.

794
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,580
Thank you.

795
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,740
More garbage.

796
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,180
Imagine you slide down the slide right into the poo.

797
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,360
Oh my gosh.

798
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,780
I saw you throw that in there.

799
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,040
Disgusting.

800
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,940
Poop on the slide.

801
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:58,920
Oh.

802
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,460
Did I do that?

803
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,980
Oh my god, they're all dead.

804
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,440
No, there's no poop on the slide.

805
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,100
Wait, I'm gonna use it.

806
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,280
Cowabunga!

807
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,310
I'm surprised anybody can swim in this, I'm not gonna lie.

808
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,550
So we can have a max of...

809
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,950
Oh, 5 plus 2.

810
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,510
Because it says it on the top left.

811
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,250
You see that?

812
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,670
What time do we close?

813
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,290
It's almost 6 p.m.

814
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,890
Hey you, you ever wanted to go to a park?

815
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:41,950
Best day ever.

816
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:43,290
They're loving this.

817
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,710
Yeah, yeah, come in, come in.

818
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,880
Or not.

819
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:51,660
Oh!

820
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,180
Reviews.

821
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,420
Twelve injured...

822
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:57,920
Well, no.

823
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,020
Twelve...

824
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,700
Twelve visitors had injured thought.

825
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,620
Ten visitors had slipped thought.

826
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,460
Nine visitors had tired thought.

827
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,280
Nine visitors had low trash thought.

828
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,160
Good reviews.

829
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,500
19 visitors had used clean attraction thought.

830
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:26,620
Yes, when I get injured, I often think, ah, my, ah, I got injured.

831
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,820
That's my thought.

832
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,760
I thought about getting injured.

833
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,080
This is the most insane water park ever.

834
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,340
One rusty slide.

835
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,920
The outhouse bathroom's a poopy pool and the owner slams you with a sledgehammer.

836
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,620
That wasn't for a criminal.

837
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,320
I took justice into my own hands.

838
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,760
Savage Fisherman Joe.

839
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,560
Welcome to membership.

840
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,260
Thank you.

841
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,360
19 visitors had energized thought.

842
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,900
17 visitors had fun thought.

843
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,180
We lost $53.

844
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,320
Satisfaction, 65%.

845
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,280
You need to unlock tipping.

846
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,820
Wait, I have to...

847
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,560
I'm begging for more money?

848
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,250
One visitor had dropped massive crap at the pool thought.

849
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,590
Yeah, who was that?

850
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,150
Who the heck did that?

851
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,570
Yeah, I'm blocking the bad reviews.

852
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,210
They're right behind my head here.

853
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,730
Maybe I'll move over like here.

854
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,330
I don't think there's too much.

855
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,470
There's like my task list on the right side, but I think it's okay.

856
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:42,590
Sorry, hold on.

857
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:46,750
Okay.

858
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,990
I'm going to sue your park.

859
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,510
I slipped and tore my ACL.

860
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,210
Uh, you signed the waiver.

861
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,790
You signed the waiver.

862
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:00,910
Uh, now what?

863
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,690
Use the printer to print out flyers and give them to pedestrians.

864
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:04,050
Okay.

865
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,000
Our park?

866
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,420
It's pretty clean.

867
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,700
Where's the water coming from?

868
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,260
Oh, I...

869
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,800
Oh, oh, I see it.

870
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,700
Dirty, dirty.

871
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,200
This is just...

872
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,720
I guess we have to get rid of these because...

873
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,240
No one's using them.

874
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,560
They kind of look good for atmosphere, but maybe it's also kind of trashy.

875
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:42,820
Hi-jai!

876
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,100
You knew what you signed up for.

877
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,140
Yeah, exactly.

878
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,320
Okay, so we close at 6 p.m.

879
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,520
Ah, what a hard day's work.

880
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,640
Who cleans the porta-potties?

881
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,220
Oh, it's actually extremely clean.

882
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,080
Just kidding.

883
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,100
All right, I'm feeling good here.

884
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,720
Let's go hand out some flyers.

885
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,700
Just looking around at everything.

886
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,420
My glory.

887
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,260
So clean since nobody's using it.

888
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,480
They're all using...

889
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,320
They're all using...

890
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,500
The pool.

891
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,520
Oh, you need to open the park to poach.

892
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,400
I'm poaching people now?

893
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:35,660
Phoebe!

894
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,700
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

895
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,460
Phoebe, watch what I can do.

896
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:42,860
Help!

897
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Ready, ready, ready.

898
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,840
That one's for you.

899
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:03,640
Hi, Phoebe.

900
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,200
Hello.

901
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,540
Hello, beehive.

902
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,180
Oh, I didn't mean to do that one, actually.

903
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,480
Thank you, Darko.

904
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,760
Thank you, take up a yin-yang.

905
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,620
My, what a large number of broken bones you have.

906
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,320
Wait, so why is it telling me to print out flyers and give to people if I can't even do that?

907
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,640
Game wide to me?

908
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,000
What, so we just...

909
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,320
We sleep?

910
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,420
We don't turn off the water?

911
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:31,420
Oh!

912
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,660
Can I go in here?

913
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,000
The void of...

914
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,080
When you go in, you become...

915
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,660
You wear a bathing suit?

916
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,400
This is my tent?

917
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,300
I have no home!

918
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:51,790
Minto!

919
00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:00,710
I thought people were camping outside, excited for my park!

920
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:02,590
Okay, hold on.

921
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,530
Is there anything else I can build?

922
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,670
No, I think we're, like, pretty tutorial limited right now.

923
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:10,470
That's okay, though.

924
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,000
I'll pick up the trash.

925
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,520
I'll move it over here.

926
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,560

927
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,820
Pick up my tools.

00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,520
Alright, team.

950
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,470
They would be in the pool.

Uh...

955
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,570
Your progress fuels discovery.

956
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,530
Gain XP from every action you take and once you've gathered enough, you'll be able to earn research points.

957
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,470
Head over to the research table in the tool shed and unlock the hot dog stand!

958
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,030
Wait.

959

00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,840
Ruth, I'm going to kill you.

974
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,140
I'm going to actually kill you.

975
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,940
I'm going to actually kill you.

976
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,580
Once I deal with these people, I'm going to kill you.

977
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,720
I'm going to kill you, Ruth.

978
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,520
I'm going to kill you.

979
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,080
There's two of them.

980
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,020
It looks like one of your guests has gotten cold feet on the diving board.

981
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,400
and give him a little encouragement.

982
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,740
Oh, okay.

983
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,510
Death to you and who's the other one?

984
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,490
Oh, what the hell just happened?

985
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:40,330
You?

986
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,090
Death, death, death, death, death.

987
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:48,070
Okay, hello, adult pass for eight hours.

988
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,250
Yeah, you get out of here, Ruth.

989

Four hours, slide, adult.

990
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,190
Who's laughing?

991
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,930
Someone is drowning!

992
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,770

995
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,210
Oh my god!

996
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:11,890

997
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,950

998
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:16,530
You're welcome!

999
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,210
Hello.

1000
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,310
Four hours.

1001
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:20,450
Mr. Senior.

1002
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,160
How do you drown in here?

1003
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,680
Like, watching people go down the slide is so funny.

1004
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:33,540
Okay.

1005
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,240
Very good.

1006
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,320
Our place is...

1007
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,090
Our place is hustling and bustling.

1008
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:47,990
Get the fuck out of here, Cade.

1009
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,810
Get the hell out of here.

1010
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:50,990
I don't want you in my park.

1011
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,030
Ever again.

1012
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:53,230
Ever again.

1013
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:53,950
Oh.

1014
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,410

1015
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,670

1016
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:56,950

Where's my...

1018
00:57:58,330 --> 00:57:59,430
Oh, there it is.

1019
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,950
Saved by the best.

1020
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:05,490
Camille.

1021
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:07,810
Beat him.

1022
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:08,510

1023
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:13,730

00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,910
No water?

1031
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,870

1032
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,130
Whoa.

1033
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:37,890

00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:38,730
There is trash.

1035
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,650
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1036
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,350
Don't be upset about the trash.

1037
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,830

00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,570
This park is so cool and free.

1041
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,450
Wait, I can't feel my legs.

1042
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,570
Yeah, don't worry about it.

1043
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,380

What are you talking about?

1066
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:19,970
Freud.

1067
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:21,190
Why is he here?

1068
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,380
I have a chocolate rocket horse.

1069
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,260

Oh.

1075
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,780
Oh, the game is still going.

1076
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,800
It doesn't pause here.

1077
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,400
Okay.

1078
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,580
Hello, Jameson.

01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,900

1080
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,900

1085
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,290
What just happened?

1086
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,010
Ah!

1087

1089
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,610
I thought the game would pause!

1090
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:50,590
When we...

1091
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,510
When we were at the table!

1092
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,790

1095
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,430
Oh, Andres, how could you not manage to avoid drowning?

1096
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,590
How could you...

1097
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,430
Oh!

1098
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,270
Guess waited too long for a ticket.

1099
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:12,690
No, no!

1100
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,030
I didn't know you were there!

1101
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,610
I'm sorry!

1102
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,370
I'm sorry.

1103
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,430
Oh gosh, this is getting a little chaotic, no?

1104
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,190
Hey, are you supposed to be in here?

1105
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:22,690
Oh, he's the medic.

Oh.

1107
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,750
Oh.

1108
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,050
How are you carrying?

1109
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,290
Oh.

1110
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:32,490
Okay.

1111
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,930
What are you gonna do to him?

1112
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:36,810
Not...

1113
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:36,890
Oh.

1114
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,310
Oh my god.

1115
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:41,930
What are you...

1116
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:42,090
Ah!

1117
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,370
I dreaded this!

1118
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:44,910
Oh no!

1119
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,260
Sir, I think we need a second ambulance.

1120
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,100
Good golly.

1121
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:00,200
Oh, I could have revived him, I think, with the injector.

1122
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,320
Maybe?

1123
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,160
Oh, no, there's garbage.

1124
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,380
Don't worry, I got it, team.

1125
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,580
There's no poop yet, which is great.

1126
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,380
We've only lost one life.

1127
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,660
We've only lost a life.

1128
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,260
if it's fine.

1129
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,700
Game has no chill.

1130
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,380
I need to, um...

1131
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,380
I almost hit the medic because I thought he was trying to steal.

1132
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,940
Or, you know, they're trying to get in for free.

1133
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,740
Okay, we're gonna get hot dogs down.

1134
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,720
I did it.

1135
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,520
Press bleed.

1136
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:46,980
Okay.

1137
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:47,800
Oh no!

1138
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:48,520
No no no!

1139
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,500
No!

1140
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,760
Don't think garbage thoughts!

1141
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,440
Okay.

1142
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:56,160
Bleed.

1143
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,860
We're gonna...

1144
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,480
Not decoration, utility.

1145
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,180
Here we go.

1146
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,980
We'll put it like...

1147
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,700
right here.

1148
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,080
Customer thought.

1149
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,260
Hey that manager, lifeguard, ticket sales, maintenance girl is pretty cute.

1150
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,480
Really?

1151
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,950
Mint Phantom presents Action Park.

1152
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,850
This is so crazy.

1153
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,210
We've only lost one life.

1154
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,270
Mint Phantom owner.

1155
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,230
Oh, the game is still going.

1156
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,710
Oh my gosh, it's so dirty.

1157
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:37,090
Everything is so nasty over here.

1158
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,150
They really...

1159
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,830
Oh, the day is over.

1160
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:48,290
I need to remember that the game does not end.

1161
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,730
The game does not pause.

1162
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,290
It's just like real life.

1163
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,870
Real life, real afterlife does not pause.

1164
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,670
It's pretty clean.

1165
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:25,510
Oh I gotta build this, not sledgehammer.

1166
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:26,650
Regular hammer.

1167
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,630
Regular hammer.

1168
01:06:37,770 --> 01:07:06,390
okay hot dog shortage uh-oh your stands out of hot dogs come back to a water park for just the water no oh oh no no sorry no one comes to a water park for just the water sorry i'm so i think i'm sick i got my wisdom teeth pulled and watching me don't beat pedestrians over the head with a sledgehammer is exactly what I needed.

1169
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,470
Nicholas, feel better.

1170
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,550
Um, sprint across the street to the store and grab a box of fresh hot dogs.

1171
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:22,850
Time is meat.

1172
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,170
Don't keep them waiting.

1173
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:31,750
Oh, well, the park is closed, so I think we're okay, but we can have the hot dogs just kind of like chilling overnight, right?

1174
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,590
Welcome to Kmart.

1175
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,290
Oh, welcome to Kmart.

1176
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,990
It's a back massage.

1177
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:45,390
Look at them.

1178
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,510
Flipy Flops.

1179
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,470
Swim Park.

1180
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,190
Simulator.

1181
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:51,870
Swim Park.

1182
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,250
What's wrong with me?

1183
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:54,670
I can't speak.

1184
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:55,630
I'm sorry, everybody.

1185
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,670
Oh, these are not unlocked yet.

1186
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:57,950
Okay.

1187
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:59,590
No space in inventory.

1188
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:00,150
Oh, geez.

1189
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:09,270
One hot dog, please.

1190
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,390
One moment, please.

1191
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:14,790
them right now.

1192
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,630
Zanzibar land, five stars.

1193
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,570
You see it there first, folks.

1194
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:21,710
Oh, nice.

1195
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,010
We don't even have to cook them.

1196
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,340
Hot dogs.

1197
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,140
Hot dogs.

1198
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:30,220
No staff.

1199
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,840
I survived Minke's class action park.

1200
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,260
Does it say now staff?

1201
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,860
Well, it still says no staff.

1202
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:39,640
No, I'm the staff.

1203
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,320
Sell hot dog.

1204
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,580
Oh, no, we'll sell tomorrow.

1205
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:46,420
Okay.

1206
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,600
First thing in the morning, baby.

1207
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,960
Liz, more than six in action park will be dethroned as the deadliest water park.

1208
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,320
Let's shoot for 40.

1209
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,560
I can't believe we killed a bat.

1210
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,200
Well, okay, but like...

1211
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,440
Was it our fault?

1212
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,820
Because I can stand in this pool.

1213
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:13,840
You know?

1214
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,340
I don't think it was our fault.

1215
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,300
You and me?

1216
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:21,680
We?

1217
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,420
Us?

1218
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:24,680
A collective?

1219
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,470
All of us here.

1220
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,670
We were all in on it.

1221
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,750
How do you drown in a pool even Minx can stand in?

1222
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:39,690
That's what I'm saying.

1223
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,240
Not all guests are equal.

1224
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,080
Every now and then a special guest might show up.

1225
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,180
Some loud, some funny, I'm just playing stinky.

1226
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,640
Oh, maybe that's why that guy was playing the game, Kesa.

1227
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,000
Keep an eye on them.

1228
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,580
Make sure they don't spoil the fun for your regular guests.

1229
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,060
What do I do if they are here?

1230
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,430
This seems kind of rude.

1231
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:17,470
Wait, what do I do to him?

1232
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,290
Hello.

1233
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:20,430
Oh.

1234
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,430
I murder him.

1235
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:23,910
I push him down the stairs.

1236
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,790
Apparently.

1237
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,470
Well, he didn't pay anyway, so

1238
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:31,830
Hello!

1239
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,510
Six hours?

1240
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:37,090
Oh my god!

1241
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,050
This seems mean!

1242
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:44,010
Four hours, adult.

1243
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:50,950
Wait, is that a person that paid or no?

1244
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,430
Six hours, teen.

1245
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:54,590
Slide pass.

1246
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,830
Wait, there's so many people coming in that are just...

1247
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,650
Do you have a pass?

1248
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,590
I don't think they did.

1249
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,590
Senior 4-Hour Slide Pass.

1250
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:15,610
I think there was somebody else, too.

1251
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:18,310
Guys, keep a lookout for the wristbands.

1252
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:19,230
Wait, you don't have one.

1253
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,130
Make it stop.

1254
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:22,810
Oh, oh.

1255
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,650
Add mustard.

1256
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:27,670
Dojo?

1257
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:30,630
Add both.

1258
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:34,980
Dojo.

1259
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,940
Oh, I think I took too long.

1260
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,960
This is getting a little bit.

1261
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,840
little nuts, you guys.

1262
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,320
This is getting a little intense.

1263
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,300
Now we have to worry about hot dogs.

1264
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,300
We have to worry about people.

1265
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,400
We have to worry about everything.

1266
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:55,780
Ah!

1267
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,140
Out of order.

1268
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,360
It's broken?

1269
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,380
I can fix it.

1270
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,070
Repair.

1271
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:11,810
Don't walk on it while I'm repairing it.

1272
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:15,490
Aha!

1273
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,890
Very good.

1274
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,730
Oh, wait, these need to get repaired too?

1275
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,050
You have to pay to use the bathroom?

1276
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,510
Who's crying?

1277
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:31,250
There's somebody.

1278
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:33,710
Okay.

1279
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:34,850
Alright.

1280
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:39,090
So far, I think we can pass out some flyers, maybe.

1281
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,720
It's a little chill right now.

1282
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:45,600
It's pretty chill.

1283
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,220
It's pretty chill.

1284
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,560
It's not even noon.

1285
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:54,740
Hello, hello!

1286
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,320
Hello!

1287
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,840
Oh, you already want a ticket.

1288
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:58,720
Okay, just kidding.

01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,100

Everything is fine.

1309
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,900
The way she jumped back after almost drowning.

1310
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:16,340
Oh.

1311
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,080

01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,140
Oh, they're just tiny trash.

1317
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,620
What a jerk.

1318
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,040
Did you wash your hands?

1319
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,020
I'm...

1320
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,360
I work at a swim...

1321
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,040
Oh, gosh.

1322
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,980
I work at a swim park.

1323
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,700
Wash my hands.

1324
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,340
All I gotta do is go into the water, baby.

1325
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:49,980
Easy peasy.

1326
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:52,820
Plane.

1327
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,840
I'm in desperate need.

1328
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:56,360
Go.

1329
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:59,260
Don't complain to me unless...

1330
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,620
I think you need staff, Minto.

1331
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,420
I agree.

1332
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,660
I would love some staff to help me.

1333
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,320
Axton, why'd you do that?

1334
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,940
Get out of my way.

1335
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,920
Why are you yelling about trash?

1336
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,220
Yell at the other people.

1337
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:55,980
Don't yell at me.

1338
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,200
I'm doing my best.

1339
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,360
Well, don't get mad at the park.

1340
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,460
Get mad at the people who are littering.

1341
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,120
the park.

1342
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:14,080
I would have last three seconds with this job with my stress tolerance.

1343
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,860
Why are we upset?

1344
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,620
Oh, hello, plane.

1345
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,580
Got you.

1346
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,060
What's...

1347
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,920
Oh, my...

1348
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,420
Wait, we're at zero star.

1349
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,280
One adult pass with changing room, bathroom, combo, and the hot dog meal ticket combo.

1350
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:37,460
Also, how much is the Summer Minto plush?

1351
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,740
That one?

1352
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,820
You have to pay per minute that you own it.

1353
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,540
These people are animals.

1354
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,380
I agree.

1355
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,120
Oh my gosh.

1356
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:50,980
Wait, don't do that.

1357
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,140
Watch out, Axton!

1358
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,780
Watch out!

1359
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:02,560
Axton!

1360
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,800
Oh my gosh.

1361
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,920
Finish tutorial.

1362
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:12,580
lifeguard-ish is the thing I got.

1363
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,100
Wait, I can't find my trash.

1364
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,460
I throw my stuff all over the place.

1365
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,680
I think I threw it up here, yeah.

1366
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,080
Okay.

1367
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,340
And we got a ping pong.

1368
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,860
No, it ex- No!

1369
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:28,580
Oh, no!

1370
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,120
Hello!

1371
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,220
Um, oh my gosh.

1372
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,180
No kidding.

1373
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,460
What the hell?

1374
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,340
Just for

1375
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:43,430
hours!

1376
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,130
Thank you!

1377
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:48,990
Oh my gosh!

1378
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:50,930
So mean!

1379
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:58,550
I'm having the worst day of my afterlife.

1380
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,810
Wait, I thought this was broken.

1381
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:06,470
Okay.

1382
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:11,050
Trash dupes.

1383
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:12,590
Oh.

1384
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:18,930
Oh, I thought I couldn't tell if this was a shadow or dirt, but it is a shadow.

1385
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:19,950
No, it's dirt.

1386
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,390
Sorry.

1387
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,070
Wait, what is this?

1388
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,250
Levi is panicking.

1389
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,300
What is this?

1390
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,740
Oh, I'm repairing it.

1391
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,720
Whatever it is.

1392
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,740
The filter.

1393
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,120
Clean filter?

1394
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,580
Oh, now it's nice and clean.

1395
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:42,720
What?

1396
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,100
There's nothing in there.

1397
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,620
What the hell is that?

1398
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,300
Wait, why is there like...

1399
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,060
There's amoeba growing in my...

1400
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,340
Okay, oh gosh, guys, we're harvesting it.

1401
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,840
COVID-2025.

1402
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,160
This is, we're incubating COVID-2025.

1403
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,140
It's here.

1404
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,320
Can I get you off of this, or...

1405
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,140
Who's in my dumpster?

1406
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,640
Oh.

1407
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:21,740
Gosh.

1408
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,600
Okay, we're at 6.

1409
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:23,800
Oh.

1410
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,980
Are you okay, Lina?

1411
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:26,940
What just happened?

1412
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,030
Lina is waiting for a hot dog.

1413
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,290
I got you.

1414
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:36,830
What do you want?

1415
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:37,530

Mm-hmm.

Oh, no.

Oh, my trash bag is full.

1424
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:01,150

Yeah, you deserve that.

1438
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,230
They're all dirty.

1439
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,990
It's okay, I'm scrubbing them with the same thing that I scrubbed the ground and scrubbed the...

1440

I scrub everything the same.

1441
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:20,010
Equal opportunity.

1442
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:20,670
Add ketchup.

1443
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,950
We're gonna have to go get more dogs soon.

01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,350
Get your first star.

1445

I have to sell tickets.

1446
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,410
Three out of 15.

1447
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,530
Oh, I have to build a trash bin and build a shower.

1448
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,050
A trash bin would be...

1449
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:35,990
That would be huge.

1450
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:37,750
Where is it though?

1451
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,490
Here?

1452
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:40,990
Oh, maybe I have to unlock it.

1453
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:43,070
Okay, hold on.

1454
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,750

1455
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:45,630
Park?

01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,810
Oh, the trash bin, trash bin.

1457
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:48,970

1463
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,060

01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:34,460
Let's see.

1469
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,040
Bad reviews.

1470
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,400
Nine visitors had low trash thought.

1471
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,700
Six visitors had injured thought.

01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,190
And it says build two showers.

1483
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:15,350
Okay, showers, here we go.

1484
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,650
We'll put the showers like over here.

1485
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:24,310
I kind of want to do like a theme, but I feel like I will do a theme once we unlock more stuff.

1486
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:25,570
Why is it always crooked?

1487
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,590
We'll like make a better theme and stuff once,

1488
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:43,130
paging Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard, Dr. Turn off my drowning inhibitors.

1489

Alright, wait.

1491
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:49,010
You know what?

1492
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,630
I'm even going to do a second trash can.

1493
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,010
Buy the toilet.

1494
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:55,550
Wait, how much money do I have?

1495
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:00,690
Oh, it's only $20 for a trash can.

1496
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:01,510
Okay, we're fine.

1497
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:04,330
I have 755 bucks.

1498
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:04,950
Let's go.

1499
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,580
Please let me have staff soon.

1500
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:49,860
please please what does research do well it lets you unlock things to get but it's like they're not unlocked at all so I don't really understand oh I think once I get to one star of my park then I can unlock more things ah so we really need to unlock or rather once we sell 15 tickets We will be at one star park.

1501
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:50,940
I think.

1502
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,570
Staff in level one?

1503
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:56,750
Yippee!

1504
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:01,950
Awesome.

1505
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,850
I think you need more pools.

1506
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:13,550
Should we build a second pool?

1507
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,320
Where can we put it?

1508
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:30,810
Maybe in the corner.

1509
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:34,940
Right here.

1510
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,880
Need more slides?

1511
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:41,700
Oh, we need more pools.

1512
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,880
For slides.

1513
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,120
We'll just put it in the corner.

1514
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,700
Nobody puts pool baby in the corner.

1515
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,400
This kind of cuts into the...

1516
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,780
Wait.

1517
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,240
Let's...

1518
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,500
Wait, just kidding.

1519
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:11,200
I'm gonna move this trash can to like here.

1520
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:12,800
It doesn't really matter.

1521
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:13,600
It's a trash can.

1522
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,240
Just kidding.

1523
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,220
Uh, okay.

1524
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:16,960
And then you.

1525
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:19,860
Okay.

1526
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,520
This one will be a little exciting.

1527
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,100
It'll be at a diagonal.

1528
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:25,920
If I can.

1529
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,080
If it'll let me.

1530
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:27,980
Oh, there we go.

1531
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,040
Okay, everybody wait right by the porta potty.

1532
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:31,680
Okay, perfect.

1533
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:33,640
Okay.

1534
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,360
Second pool?

1535
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,780
Oh, we are in business, baby.

1536
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:47,980
Okay.

1537
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,200
We are so in business.

1538
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,400
Oh, this thing needs to get clean too.

1539
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,140
Everything's dirty.

1540
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,320
Everything's so nasty.

1541
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:04,540
Okay.

1542
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,380
And you need to be repaired at all?

1543
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,120
Oh, yeah, you do.

1544
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,040
It was good.

1545
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,000
Oh, this thing was about to break any second.

1546
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,640
We could have killed more people.

1547
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,340
I don't... I actually kind of don't want more people coming to my park.

1548
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:22,980
I'm scared.

1549
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:25,720
I'm scared.

1550
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,440

Welcome to action, Minto Park.

01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:06,350
Please don't sue us.

1554
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:09,950
Okay.

1555
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,740
Keep everything here.

1556
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:21,300
Oh, my...

1557
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:21,480
Wait.

1558
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:24,640
Oh, my little tiny trash bag.

1559
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,120
Right, everything is all together?

1560
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:29,560
Wait, where did my sledgehammer go?

1561
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,540
Why... How did you get over here?

1562
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,160
That's strange.

1563
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:34,920
Alright, good.

1564
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,160
Okay, sleep time.

1565
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:39,280
Are you...

1566
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,040
Hot dogs!

1567
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,260
Thank you, guys.

1568
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:42,480
Yeah, we need more hot dogs.

1569
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:46,940
Yes.

1570
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,580
More hot dogs.

1571
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,780
We are all clean.

1572
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,260
We're all stocked.

1573
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:51,460
Oops.

1574
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,840
We're fine.

1575
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:57,800
Yes.

1576
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,140
Um, is this clean?

1577
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:01,600
No, I think about it.

1578
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,000
Maybe I do need to clean this.

1579
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,100
Oh!

1580
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:05,480
Oh!

1581
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,300
I think I also need to, like, fix it.

1582
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:15,950
They're not stored appropriately.

1583
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:16,990
Oh, no.

1584
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:19,070
No, they're perfectly stored.

1585
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:21,590
Guys?

1586
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:23,850
Would you come to my water park?

1587
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,670
Would you come to my water park?

1588
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:30,650
For eight hours.

1589
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:33,950
For eight whole hours?

1590
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,940
Need churros.

1591
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,660
That's a great idea.

1592
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,920
Why are the hot dogs already buttoned and cooked?

1593
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:47,960
Don't ask.

1594
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:50,500
Don't...

1595
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,220
Say it.

1596
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,040
Don't spray it.

1597
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,130
24 hour pass!

1598
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:00,870
Aww.

1599
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:02,130
Aww.

1600
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:04,590
Alright, we're gonna hit our goal today.

1601
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:07,230
We're gonna get one stars.

1602
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,300
Are there Japanese amusement park treats you wish were a thing in America?

1603
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:31,940
Oh, well, I once went to Tokyo Disney Sea during the summer and they just sold whole mango on a stick and it was great.

1604
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,020
I would, I would like that.

1605
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,100
Good morning!

1606
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,240
Six hour teen bash.

1607
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,320
Yeah, it was just a mango.

1608
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,260
It wasn't like a mango bar or anything.

1609
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:47,740
Like, it was...

1610
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,080
was an actual mango.

1611
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,260
Oh, I got a new research point.

1612
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,440
Adult with the slide pass.

1613
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,720
Yeah, I wish we, I wish mango were real.

1614
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,170
I'm both.

1615
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,870
Thank you.

1616
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,150
Someone in there?

1617
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:30,170
Oh, let's get my loady out.

1618
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:34,950
Before I...

1619
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,050
You know, there we go.

1620
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,790
Everything's good.

1621
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:39,590
Ah, they're taking showers!

1622
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,190
Oh my gosh, they're using the facilities!

1623
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:43,830
$5, please?

1624
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:47,090
$5.

1625
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,190
Oh, $1.

1626
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:55,430
Why is the music so loud all of a sudden?

1627
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:58,930
I think we should pass out more flyers.

1628
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:01,510
because nobody's here.

1629
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,950
It's kind of sad.

1630
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:15,370
Thank you.

1631
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,270
Anybody drowning?

1632
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:19,950
Everyone's alive?

1633
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:23,730
Trash?

1634
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:25,490
Where?

1635
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:30,900
Is there a lazy river yet?

1636
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,660
Almost soon, probably.

1637
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:37,300
Probably tomorrow I can, you know, carve that out.

1638
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,260
Hello?

1639
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:40,900
Senior.

1640
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,200
Six hours.

1641
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,120
Thank you.

1642
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:49,800
Add both.

1643
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:52,460
Thank you.

1644
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:54,460
Oh, I see the trash.

1645
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:55,700
Please

1646
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,100
ignore our mess.

1647
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:03,600
Please, thank you.

1648
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:05,740
Ding, mung.

1649
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,980
Six hour adult.

1650
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,320
I think I'm about to murder somebody.

1651
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,520
You're fine.

1652
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:26,700
Die.

1653
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,860
Get the hell out of my park.

1654
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,460
Get the hell out of my park and think again about cheating me.

1655
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:34,080
Huh?

1656
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,100
Huh?

1657
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,520
This is my livelihood.

1658
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:37,580
Hello.

1659
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:40,820
Six hours in there.

1660
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,680
Is everybody alive?

1661
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:45,040
Okay.

1662
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:53,760
I gotta set an exam.

1663
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,520
everybody.

1664
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,800
Where's my money, Lepowski?

1665
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:00,520
No!

1666
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:02,800
Oops.

1667
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,410
Oh, I slipped on the banana.

1668
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:10,490
How embarrassing.

1669
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:13,770
Okay, nobody saw that.

1670
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:22,110
Puddles are so dangerous here.

1671
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:25,010
They're like made of the slipperyest goo ever in the world.

1672
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,550
No, no poops in the pool.

1673
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:28,490
Okay, we're Great.

1674
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:30,330
Oh, I got an achievement.

1675
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:31,890
I mopped 100 puddles.

1676
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:36,390
I'm gonna build a second toilet just in case.

1677
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,930
I think people would appreciate that.

1678
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:41,150
You know?

1679
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,360
Pools of ectoplasm.

1680
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,340
Yes!

1681
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,240
Yes, actually.

1682
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,000
Add mustard.

1683
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,720
It was pushing me.

1684
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:05,880
Oh, are you okay?

1685
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,560
Someone missed the toilet, I guess.

1686
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,900
We just need three more tickets.

1687
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,180
Three more, and we're good.

1688
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:23,400
For one star, we can unlock so many things.

1689
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,040
Oh, um, um, um, uh, uh, no, sir.

1690
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:34,690
Ma'am?

1691
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:36,810
No person.

1692
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,070
Okay, we need more flyers.

1693
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,290
Yeah, you cry about it.

1694
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,650
You cry about it.

1695
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,010
Already wants a ticket.

1696
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:51,570
Then he should have paid for it!

1697
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:54,910
Oh, please.

1698
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:55,610
Don't leave.

1699
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:57,250
Yeah, yeah, have a blast.

1700
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,070
Have a blast.

1701
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,430
Do you want to take it already?

1702
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,210
Yeah, I already want to take it.

1703
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:03,010
Wait, these might be our last people.

1704
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:07,950
This might be it.

1705
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:10,610
Hold on.

1706
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:12,530
Your hot dog will wait.

1707
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:22,630

01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:35,610

1710
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:36,290
Are you sure?

1711
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:37,510
Yippee!

1712
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:39,750

Add mustard Thank you Oh, oh, lots of puddles, everybody.

1714
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,760
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1715
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,200
Oh, come on, you guys!

1716
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,160
Who's dying?

1717
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:57,580
Who's screaming?

1718
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,540
Wait, caught a cheater.

1719
01:37:58,900 --> 01:37:59,120
Oh, okay.

1720
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:05,300
Everyone decides to walk into the puddles all at the same time.

1721
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:07,980
Add both.

1722
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,390
Senior citizen discount?

1723
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,640

01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,800
Okay, Miriam.

1725
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:21,440
Jeez.

1726
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,740
All right, we're gonna go after this.

1727
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,520
People dying be damned.

1728
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,180
I think we gotta do some...

1729
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:33,980
Actually, no, we'll do all the research at night.

1730
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,780
That might be too risky.

1731
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:39,500
People just be drowning every two seconds.

1732
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,280
Oh, sorry.

1733
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,060
Sorry.

1734
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,340
Excuse me, please.

1735
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,920
What's wrong with my pool?

1736
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,120
Wait, why is my pool empty?

1737
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,060
Oh, God.

1738
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,360
Don't use them!

1739
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,680
Don't use it if it's F!

1740
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,280
It's F!

1741
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:00,700
Stop!

1742
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,300
Stop using!

1743
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,920
Stop the slides!

1744
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,720
Why is it empty?

1745
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:10,420
Why is it empty?

1746
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,100
Oh no, is he dead?

1747
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,880
Oh, I think I can save him.

1748
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:19,800
I can save him!

1749
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:24,200
That was close!

1750
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,340
You're telling me!

1751
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,540
Oh my gosh, Lima.

1752
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,180
Oh my god.

1753
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,060
Stop using the slides!

1754
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,920
It's out of order!

1755
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,740
I received a fa- Stop!

1756
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,490
This is a disaster.

1757
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:51,590
Stella, you cannot find me.

1758
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:52,790
You did this to yourself.

1759
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,990
How do I repair what it want?

1760
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:00,390
Oh, I think I just repair it like this.

1761
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:03,590
I thought it had something to do with the...

1762
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:04,410
Oh, my God.

1763
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:06,790
This is an actual disaster.

1764
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:07,870
Okay, everybody?

1765
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:08,910
We're fine.

1766
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:11,410
Stella, I'm not touching you.

1767
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:13,650
You literally find me before.

1768
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,350
You will be fine.

1769
01:40:21,170 --> 01:40:22,110
Oh, my gosh.

1770
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,750
This is turning into chaos hell world.

1771
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:26,350
Yes, plane?

1772
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:27,430
Okay, I got you.

1773
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:30,790
Guess waited too long.

1774
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:32,050
I just got to him!

1775
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:33,510
Eight hours.

1776
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:34,530
Adult.

1777
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:35,850
Slide pass.

1778
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,210
There you go, Carla.

1779
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:41,230
Four hours.

1780
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:46,690
Yeah, we need staff pronto.

1781
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:48,290
Yorn.

1782
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:49,510
Slide pass.

1783
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:52,190
Smelly guess!

1784
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:53,890
A smelly guess has entered my park.

1785
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:55,490
Their stink is reducing hygiene.

1786
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:57,410
Unlock the water gun.

1787
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:59,270
Oh, okay.

1788
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:02,570
Oh my gosh.

1789
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,190
No!

1790
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:08,320
How do I use it?

1791
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:08,580
Wait.

1792
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,300
Do I just...

1793
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,340
Where do I get it?

1794
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:12,860
In here?

1795
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:13,980
Oh, here it is.

1796
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:21,450
Gosh, dang it.

1797
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:22,730
Miriam is drowning!

1798
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:27,000
Oh.

1799
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:29,200
Oops.

1800
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:29,920
It'll reach.

1801
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:30,400
It'll reach.

1802
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,320
Ah, okay.

1803
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,560
Alright, we're fine.

1804
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,400
There's trash everywhere.

1805
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,320
There's everything, everything all at once.

1806
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,060
Requires a trash bag.

1807
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,780
Wait, oh, I'm stupid.

1808
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:46,560
I'm right clicking.

1809
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:48,120
Everybody's tripping.

1810
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:49,640
Everything is bad.

1811
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,120
The world is on fire.

1812
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,340
I don't want to be an entrepreneur anymore.

1813
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,540
I regret this life.

1814
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,120
Oh, I'm slipping.

1815
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:05,120
I hate the service.

1816
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:06,900
Take the mob!

1817
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:07,680
Take the mob!

1818
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,820
Everybody's slipping.

1819
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,780
I'm slipping.

1820
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:16,980
They're slipping.

1821
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,380
We're all slipping.

1822
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,840
Please move!

1823
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:24,220
Oh my god!

1824
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:32,120
I'm gonna be- I'm gonna go broke because I'm gonna have no money from all the lawsuits.

1825
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,500
Why did I build this pool?

1826
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,200
Why did I built this park on rock.

1827
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,240
I should have done it.

1828
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:48,680
I should have done it on on like a little like a squishy pad or something.

1829
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:50,180
Boy, what is this?

1830
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:51,720
Oh, we got pizza.

1831
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:54,340
Okay, fine.

1832
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:55,560
Wait, what are you doing?

1833
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,140
Get in there.

1834
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:04,030
Uh oh.

1835
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:05,230
What's happening?

1836
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:08,510
Oh, you need medical assistance or...

1837
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:10,070
Uh oh.

1838
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:10,970
Are you drowning?

1839
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:12,530
Oh, heal again.

1840
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:14,850
Day's over!

1841
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:17,930
Uh.

1842
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:27,200
Uh.

1843
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:49,190
He just stood there and took it.

1844
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:53,230
Why are my pools breaking so fast all of a sudden?

1845
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:04,500
Are you gonna leave?

1846
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:06,620
Parks closed, buddy.

1847
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:13,880
Customers playing rough.

1848
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,980
I'm fighting for my afterlife over here for real.

1849
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,480
Let him stay.

1850
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,040
I will.

1851
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:24,600
I will.

1852
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:28,780
Alright.

1853
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,940
Maybe the tutorial was like...

1854
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:34,820
Crazy easy.

1855
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,040
If we get...

1856
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,860
Okay, Road the second star is clearing 20 tracks.

1857
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:56,440

1858
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,480
i didn't mean to do that but that was fun okay i need my trash bag

1859
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:15,840
No trash there.

1860
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,060
Gather trash.

1861
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,560
Gather trash.

1862
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:24,300
Oh.

1863
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:29,250
Oh, he's leaving.

1864
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:32,810
See ya.

1865
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:33,770
See you tomorrow.

1866
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:35,690
Bye.

1867
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:39,490
Don't slip on the way out.

1868
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:41,950
Take it easy.

1869
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:45,780
Bye.

1870
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,840
He's completely tripping in his suit.

1871
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:56,680
Maybe we need to actually provide towels for these savages.

1872
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:58,060
These people are crazy.

1873
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,300
Everybody here is crazy.

1874
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:03,440
They don't know how to swim and they go to parks.

1875
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:09,210
They...

1876
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:10,910
Back to the office.

1877
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:12,570
What was I?

1878
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:13,910
What did I see?

1879
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:17,870
That was just like, it's a swimsuit and it's all...

1880
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:20,130
of a suit.

1881
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:24,930
Okay, let's repair everything.

1882
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,150
Tip-top shape.

1883
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,560
It's because they're not stretching before going in.

1884
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,500
Must be.

1885
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:40,440
Everybody is insane here.

1886
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,580
Even the bathrooms are treated so poorly.

1887
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,120
Actually, that's just everybody, though.

1888
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,960
That's in real life, too.

1889
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:54,760
Nobody Nobody treats things with care.

1890
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:01,720
Now, if you ever feel like I'm making a mess of a bathroom, remember this stream.

1891
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,820
Remember all the pain and suffering I've gone through.

1892
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,320
And be like, you know what?

1893
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:13,680
There's somebody just like Minto who is suffering.

1894
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,800
Trying to clean everything.

1895
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,460
I should be kinder.

1896
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,180
I'm trying to be kinder.

1897
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,480
Don't tempt me.

1898
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,640
You're like, oh, wait.

1899
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:43,920
Minto is, uh, clean in this place?

1900
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,660
Okay, I think I've cleaned and repaired everything.

1901
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,160
Does this need to be cleaner repaired?

1902
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,060
We gotta get more hot dogs, though.

1903
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,600
And then we shall...

1904
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:05,700
Um...

1905
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,120
Oh, shoot.

1906
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:06,620
I forgot.

1907
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,600
Then we will, um...

1908
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,200
Buy stuff.

1909
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:18,740
Oh, I guess they give you the boxing glove so that you can punch intruders.

1910
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:19,920
That's fun.

1911
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,060
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1912
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:23,860
I'm so stuffly.

1913
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:57,700
I work in janitorial maintenance and it feels like nobody cares about hygiene Oh the worst Okay let's let's upgrade Unlocks a stand with inflatable life rings to assist in quick water rescues Okay, so I have eight points Increase walk Okay, maintenance Where are the staff?

1914
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,060
Where are the staff?

1915
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:02,300
Cache your staff.

1916
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:05,800
Oh, if I get paintbrush, okay.

1917
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:13,860
Things stay cleaner for longer.

1918
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,220
That would be four.

1919
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:17,120
And this would be four.

1920
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,060
I think that would be good.

1921
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,200
Bigger pockets.

1922
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:21,060
Oh, wait.

1923
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,180
That's huge, too.

1924
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:31,670
But I think, first of all, Cache your staff.

1925
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:33,970
That's huge.

1926
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:36,210
Oh, we get to paint now.

1927
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:36,790
Okay.

1928
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:41,350
Press tab, open the higher men now.

1929
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:48,450
You have to pay them daily, but they keep the park running smoothly most of the time.

1930
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:52,010
Sometimes staff take breaks, and when they do, their work simply stops.

1931
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:57,110
Higher.

1932
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:00,010
Higher.

1933
01:50:09,110 --> 01:50:11,310
Why are their efficiencies so low?

1934
01:50:12,990 --> 01:50:14,530
Wait, this person's pretty good.

1935
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:16,690
30% efficiency.

1936
01:50:18,450 --> 01:50:20,530
Oh, wait, but this person has crazy endurance.

1937
01:50:23,070 --> 01:50:25,090
A lot more stats than I expected.

1938
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:25,810
Me too!

1939
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:28,390
Don't hire them until tomorrow.

1940
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:29,390
Okay.

1941
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:30,730
Good plan.

1942
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,170
Yeah.

1943
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:33,290
Alright, what else can we do?

1944
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:35,890
Let's see.

1945
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:37,510
Simple and functional toilets.

1946
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:41,230
Oh, this would be different toilets than what we have.

1947
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:42,910
Pick a trash bag.

1948
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:46,730
Basic pool.

1949
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,710
Generous tip.

1950
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:03,050
Pockets lead to handyman.

1951
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:05,390
You're right.

1952
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:07,210
Wait, but this is repair.

1953
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:09,270
Okay, actually repair worker is huge.

1954
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:11,930
Okay, you're right.

1955
01:51:13,130 --> 01:51:14,250
We could do both.

1956
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:16,430
No, we can't.

1957
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:17,810
Ah, I have to get the shower.

1958
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:22,670
That's fine.

1959
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:27,870
I think staff is biggest at the moment.

1960
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,730
Here's janitorial staff.

1961
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:33,870
Oh, I should have gone with this, huh?

1962
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:35,130
Oh, shoot.

1963
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:36,210
That's okay.

1964
01:51:37,370 --> 01:51:37,810
That's okay.

1965
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:39,370
We'll just get more research points.

1966
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:41,710
Sorry, we're all stuffed on, Minto.

1967
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:44,490
When I was a kid, I was feeling stuffy.

1968
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:46,250
I would say my nose is all hogged up.

1969
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:48,530
I don't remember why.

1970
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:52,190
That's so cute.

1971
01:51:52,690 --> 01:52:26,670
reminds me um when i was a kid we would do road trips with my family and uh we would always go to the same place during the summer but it was like really really far it was a super long drive and there was one restaurant we would always stop at in the middle of the drive but i didn't know the difference between states and restaurants So I would always call the restaurant the state.

1972
01:52:27,270 --> 01:52:29,290
And I would be like, I want to go to that state.

1973
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:40,810
And they'd be like, you mean the restaurant, Minto?

1974
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,790
And I was like, yeah, I want to go to the state.

1975
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:48,410
So like, if it was like, for example, Texas, I'd be like, I want to go to Texas.

1976
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,590
But I meant a restaurant.

1977
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,210
Let's all eat at Colorado.

1978
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:02,570
So I would do that.

1979
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:09,590
And even now when I see that restaurant, I'm like, yeah.

1980
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:12,170
There's that restaurant.

1981
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:15,250
There's that state.

1982
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:20,490
Takes a special state of mind.

1983
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:23,730
Okay, so we have some...

1984
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:25,050
What did I get?

1985
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:26,270
Oh, we're going to get the handyman.

1986
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:58,810
next we're gonna get the handyman we got 14 out of 20 trash cleared there's nothing in here right no i think we've repaired everything and cleaned everything so i think we're good to oh oh oh okay now i think we're good to go i need to stop throwing away bags because they Okay.

01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:01,390
Oh, I forgot I got bigger pockets!

1988
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:03,010
We can hold, like, everything now.

1989
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:06,690
Okay.

1990
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:08,230
All right, let's go see.

1991
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:14,070
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

1992
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,090
All right.

1993
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:15,890
Good morning, Minto!

1994
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:17,950
Let's hire some people.

1995
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:20,690
Let's hire somebody.

1996
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:21,190

1997
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:21,970

1999
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:26,370
Oh, tab.

2000
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:27,350
All right.

2001
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:36,550
Wait, these prices are way more Than before Or am I crazy?

2002
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:41,090
Yeah, dude, they're way more expensive than before What happened?

2003
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:44,150
Hi?

01:54:54,500 --> 01:55:12,560
So expensive Um Better stats Oh geez Okay, um I feel like this is a good middle ground Well actually maybe this Okay This person has a lot of endurance.

2005
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:14,440
Efficiency.

2006
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:15,440
You know what?

2007
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,220
How much money do I have?

2008
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:19,360
We could always fire him.

2009
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,300
$2.75 per day.

2010
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:34,860
This person might be better, actually.

2011
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,960
They have more endurance.

2012
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,900
I think actually we'll go with Braylon.

2013
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,200
Massachusetts, it's my favorite fried fish joint.

2014
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,140
Yugi, my boy.

2015
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:51,260
Yugi boy.

2016
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,760
Maximilian Pegasus.

2017
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:58,920
Do we go with Maximilian Pegasus or do we go with Braylon?

2018
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,520
I'm just gonna hire Braylon.

2019
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:06,540
All right.

2020
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:07,900
Come on in, Braylon.

2021
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:09,660
Oh!

2022
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:12,680
Hired my first staff.

2023
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,020
All right, let's get the park open.

2024
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:15,780
Baby?

2025
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:22,310
I will go take out flyers.

2026
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:31,430
Hello, we're open for business!

2027
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:34,270
Oh, here they come, here they come!

2028
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:34,770
Whoa.

2029
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:36,030
Oh, what about you?

2030
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:37,130
You don't know about my business.

2031
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:40,910
Don't yawn at me.

2032
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:44,130
Yeah!

2033
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:47,350
Yep!

2034
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:51,730
Are you doing it?

2035
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:54,930
Are you doing it?

2036
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:57,390
Do I need to leave?

2037
01:56:58,690 --> 01:56:59,210
Okay.

2038
01:57:01,670 --> 01:57:02,270
Hi, Earl.

2039
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:04,870
Thank you so much for the bid to give to thank you.

2040
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,510
I hear California has some good rolls.

2041
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:10,690
California rolls.

2042
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:14,890
In fact, I'm going to get the water gun on the ready.

2043
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:17,890
Or we could get the...

2044
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:18,270
Wait.

2045
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:20,270
Uh-oh.

2046
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:22,050
This.

2047
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:23,710
The life ring on the ready.

2048
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:30,090
You're paying, right?

2049
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:31,430
You're all paying the...

2050
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:32,110
Come in!

2051
01:57:34,370 --> 01:57:34,890
Okay.

2052
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:36,030
Alright.

2053
01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:37,030
So far so good.

2054
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:38,370
So far not so bad.

2055
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:39,710
What is this?

2056
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:41,390
Oh.

2057
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:44,210
Medkit injector.

2058
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,530
I got painting.

2059
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:56,110
Oh yeah, I did get that.

2060
01:57:56,370 --> 01:57:57,830
We can start coloring stuff.

2061
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:00,910
Wow.

2062
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:02,890
We can start coloring things.

2063
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:03,430
Let's see.

2064
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:05,570
This one.

2065
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:09,820
Oh.

2066
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:11,880
Wait, we're a hot dog!

2067
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,340
Add both.

2068
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,700
Thank you.

2069
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:18,900
Where did I drop that?

2070
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:20,060
There it is.

2071
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,300
Oh, research floor tool.

2072
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:27,000
Oh wait, how can I change the color?

2073
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,160
Uh oh.

2074
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:29,680
Um.

2075
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:34,290
Wait.

2076
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:38,810
I'm painting everything brown.

2077
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:41,570
Wait, no!

2078
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:43,370
I don't want it all Right click?

2079
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:47,230
Oh, okay, okay.

2080
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:48,710
Oh, okay.

2081
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:52,930
Oh, someone's waiting for a hot dog.

2082
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:54,330
Hello.

2083
01:58:54,850 --> 01:58:55,210
Plan.

2084
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:03,440
Braylin screwed up an order.

2085
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:05,520
Braylin!

2086
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:07,440
Braylin!

2087
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,040
Bjorn is drowning!

2088
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,620
Saved by the best, baby.

2089
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:17,780
Oh, yeah!

2090
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,080
Oh, he's so excited.

2091
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,620
He's so excited about- he's going down backwards!

2092
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:27,000
This is how you- Bjorn, this is how you're gonna drown!

2093
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,340
Gonna pee to your ool- No!

2094
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:34,460
Crunko!

2095
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,920
Don't do it!

2096
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:37,980
Thank you for the pink.

2097
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:39,560
Thank you.

2098
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,100
Celebrate life.

2099
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:45,960
My man was so excited that he lived.

2100
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:49,100
Wait, so what if I do this?

2101
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:51,960
Raelin again?

2102
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:56,990
Wait, this costs money.

2103
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:00,470
But I guess people will appreciate the fun color, right?

2104
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:03,430
Yeah, it's kind of nice.

2105
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:04,510
Uh-oh.

2106
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:05,750
Uh-oh.

2107
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:07,870
Oh, oh, oh, me too.

2108
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:08,730
I'm down.

2109
02:00:09,130 --> 02:00:09,670
I'm down.

2110
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:20,220
Yeah, it's a pretty standard water park color.

2111
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,340
It looks nice, I think.

2112
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:25,400
I think it looks good.

2113
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,380
People are going to be very excited by the...

2114
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,860
Bright and colorful, fun colors.

2115
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,360
Everything is blue.

2116
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,700
Blue, blue, blue.

2117
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:37,620
I love blue.

2118
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:41,080
My name is Mint, but I love blue.

2119
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:45,580
Oh, blue, blue, blue, blue.

2120
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,620
Everything is blue.

2121
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,440
Da-ba-dee-da-ba-da.

2122
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:54,380
Blue.

2123
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:56,700
Wait, this looks fancy, actually.

2124
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,560
Blue phantom.

2125
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:03,520
Yeah.

2126
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:06,700
You okay?

2127
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:07,580
Oh my gosh!

2128
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,840
Don't sleep there Arlo, you're gonna get a tan.

2129
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,420
He regrets everything.

2130
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:23,470
Gosh, these pools get so dirty so fast.

2131
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:26,870
Yes, we did too long.

2132
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:28,670
Oh, I didn't realize there was someone waiting for a hot dog.

2133
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:41,670
Oh, I'm here!

2134
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:42,370
Hello!

2135
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:43,670
Add both.

2136
02:01:44,250 --> 02:01:44,610
Okay.

2137
02:01:46,230 --> 02:01:47,110
Thank you.

2138
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:53,970
Okay, 9 out of 10 throw.

2139
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:54,690
Let's go.

2140
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:59,070
Someone's dead over here?

2141
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:01,730
Oh, sorry, Phoenix.

2142
02:02:01,930 --> 02:02:03,490
I didn't mean to run into you.

2143
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:07,010
You got someone waiting for a hot dog?

2144
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:09,990
Hello.

2145
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:10,850
Ad mustard.

2146
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:13,170
Dozo, my lady.

2147
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:15,830
Someone too afraid to...

2148
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:16,330
Get in there.

2149
02:02:18,510 --> 02:02:19,590
Oh, there's trash.

2150
02:02:20,430 --> 02:02:21,370
Not on my watch.

2151
02:02:22,530 --> 02:02:23,150
Dirt's in damage.

2152
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,690
Traction.

2153
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:24,510
Slowly lose dirt.

2154
02:02:24,630 --> 02:02:25,450
Oh, yeah, we know this.

2155
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:27,530
Oh, yeah, I know this.

2156
02:02:27,730 --> 02:02:28,950
I know this all too well.

2157
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,610
Why did you fall asleep?

2158
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:31,750
I just fed you!

2159
02:02:32,490 --> 02:02:32,910
Ariel!

2160
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,030
Oh, my gosh.

2161
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:41,950
Oh, it's a

2162
02:02:52,150 --> 02:02:53,410
little freaky, you guys.

2163
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:56,210
Skinwalker.

2164
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:00,530
Don't do that!

2165
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:02,130
It's out of order!

2166
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:03,170
Can't you read!

2167
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:08,950
Is Braylon still there?

2168
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:10,110
Or...

2169
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:10,990
Oh yeah, he is.

2170
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:12,550
Is he still doing his job?

2171
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:16,590
I think he's about almost done, so we're gonna have to take over for him.

2172
02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:17,210
No, no!

2173
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,890
Don't get off!

2174
02:03:18,230 --> 02:03:19,730
I'm trying to clean the slide!

2175
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:21,630
Oh wait, I painted it poopy brown.

2176
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:23,390
I thought it was just dirty.

2177
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:30,930
No, it's me.

2178
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:31,890
I did that.

2179
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:36,590
What's in those hot dogs?

2180
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:39,610
Why do you think I say hot dog?

2181
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:44,630
I cannonballed inside your empty pool and broke my butt.

2182
02:03:46,990 --> 02:03:47,330
Um.

2183
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,680
This place needs to be shut down.

2184
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,240
No, it's not.

2185
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,060
It's my livelihood, please.

2186
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:28,100
Ow!

2187
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:29,180
Ow!

2188
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:32,610
Hello.

2189
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:33,890
What would you like?

2190
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:34,810
Mustard.

2191
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:39,310
Thank you.

2192
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:40,410
What would you like?

2193
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:45,210
Thank you.

2194
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:52,760
Anything?

2195
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,520
Anything trash in here?

2196
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:54,920
No?

2197
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:02,740
You can sue yourself.

2198
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:04,980
No, I'm doing an amazing job!

2199
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:06,220
Please!

2200
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:07,680
Oh, sorry.

2201
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:11,620
Oh, sorry.

2202
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:14,740
Just, like, stay out of my way, okay?

2203
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,160
These filters?

2204
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:16,560
Okay.

2205
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:19,940
All clean.

2206
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:24,340
Oh wait, COVID-25, COVID-25!

2207
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,260
COVID-25 alert!

2208
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:33,510
This is Mint Phantom's water park for the clinically insane.

2209
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:36,090
I'm sure he's fraud enthusiast.

2210
02:05:36,650 --> 02:05:37,050
No!

2211
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:39,530
What do you mean?

2212
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:44,170
I think this one's dirty.

2213
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,780
Cleaning it while they're on it.

2214
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:56,460
Ah!

2215
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:59,320
Oh, I got a new research point.

2216
02:05:59,580 --> 02:05:59,980
Let's go.

2217
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:02,920
Wait, we can maybe go by the staff now.

2218
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:09,320
Everything is deteriorating at an exponential rate.

2219
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:14,520
I'm... I think Ariel is really far gone.

2220
02:06:19,690 --> 02:06:22,170
Team, let's all stop slipping on this, please.

2221
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:26,670
If I drown myself, will you give me CPR?

2222
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:31,090
wide.

2223
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:37,190
I need trash.

2224
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:38,630
Trash.

2225
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,370
You nasty creatures.

2226
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:42,570
All of you.

2227
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:44,110
Oh.

2228
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:45,170
Hello.

2229
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:45,790
Plane.

2230
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:46,810
I got you.

2231
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:48,090
I got you, queen.

2232
02:06:53,230 --> 02:06:54,290
Out of order!

2233
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:55,330
Uh-oh.

2234
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:55,890
Okay, hold on.

2235
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:56,690
What do you want, plane?

2236
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:57,090
Okay.

2237
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:58,850
Hot dogs will have to wait.

2238
02:06:59,330 --> 02:06:59,970
What's out of order?

2239
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:00,490
Oh, this thing.

2240
02:07:00,690 --> 02:07:00,750
Okay.

2241
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:12,290
That's just like totally normal for a...

2242
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:15,190
for a theme park though, no?

2243
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:20,510
This thing is about to fall the hell apart.

2244
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:28,510
I'm keeping up with market standards.

2245
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:34,570
It's market standards, everybody.

2246
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:41,360
Get in there.

2247
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,020
Enjoy the pool.

2248
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:46,040
Stinky trash.

2249
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,260
I got it.

2250
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:51,020
We're good.

2251
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:56,280
Let's repair these two.

2252
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:57,560
Kobe.

2253
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:02,460
Cleaning.

2254
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:05,460
New research point.

2255
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:08,740
Oops.

2256
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:10,420
I think I just threw the trash in here.

2257
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,080
Oh no, where did I put it?

2258
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:13,080
Oh, there it is.

2259
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:13,560
Oof.

2260
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:15,260
Everything's fine.

2261
02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:16,060
Oh no!

2262
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:17,980
One moment, please.

2263
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:18,400
Oh.

2264
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,160
Oh, the day is over.

2265
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:20,760
Oh, thank God.

2266
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:21,600
Hi, dog.

2267
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:22,880
That's what I needed.

2268
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:24,740
Blue!

2269
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:26,200
Thank you so much for those.

2270
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:26,720
Spooky.

2271
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:28,240
So happy.

2272
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:29,080
My name is Blue.

2273
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:30,600
She loves me.

2274
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,840
Okay, bad reviews.

2275
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:40,660
Eight visitors.

2276
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,960
Or 18 visitors had tired thought.

2277
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,420
Okay, we need to make more chairs.

2278
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,060
13 visitors had slip thought.

2279
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:48,520
Slipknot?

2280
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:52,320
Do you have a license for that, Amma?

2281
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,620
Yes, sir.

2282
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:55,840
I do.

2283
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,460
Sage, thank you so much for the part.

2284
02:08:58,580 --> 02:08:59,320
I'm going to do that too.

2285
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:02,280
10 visitors had low trash thought.

2286
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:04,620
8 visitors had decoration level thought.

2287
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,520
You don't like blue?

2288
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:08,780
They don't like the...

2289
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:09,360
Good reviews.

2290
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:11,560
29 visitors had energized thought.

2291
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,580
26 visitors had used clean attraction thought.

2292
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:16,580
14 visitors had fun thought.

2293
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,980
And 8 visitors had full thought.

2294
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:21,220
Wow, they're having full thought.

2295
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:22,600
Ariel!

2296
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,020
Ariel, are you okay?

2297
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,340
It's time to go home!

2298
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:27,600
Oh gosh.

2299
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:29,120
Oh.

2300
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:30,120
Whoa.

2301
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:35,300
Guys, I think she's really into me.

2302
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:36,960
Whoa, whoa.

2303
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,060
Ariel?

2304
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:41,460
Oh, under the sea.

2305
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:44,600
Under the sea.

2306
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:47,060
Oh, darling, it's better.

2307
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:48,360
Down where?

2308
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,680
Down where it's better.

2309
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:51,560
Take it from me!

2310
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:54,500
Man.

2311
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:56,100
You...

2312
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:57,760
Ma'am, you are...

2313
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,500
You have become a statue.

2314
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:02,020
I think your tan is, like, insane.

2315
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,620
Damn, girl.

2316
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,280
That body of yours.

2317
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,700
No, I'm actually concerned.

2318
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:09,320
Okay.

2319
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:12,060
Tandyman staff.

2320
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,880
And then we'll do bigger trash bags so we can lead to janitor staff.

2321
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:21,140
I think would be good.

2322
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:21,520
Oh, wait.

2323
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:22,840
Maintenance decoration, little one.

2324
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:23,760
Adds a bit of...

2325
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:26,300
I can afford this.

2326
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:30,300
Did I hear someone walking?

2327
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:32,180
It wasn't aerial.

2328
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,020
Restock required.

2329
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:39,280
Spraylan.

2330
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:40,600
What are you doing?

2331
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:49,800
How do you beat the game?

2332
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:51,840
I don't know.

2333
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:54,540
I guess you become the greatest

2334
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:00,740
water park in the world.

2335
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:07,450
Minto needs a spray tan.

2336
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:25,780
Yeah, going back to that story about about how I got made fun of for how pale I used to be or I still am, but how I used to get made fun of for it.

2337
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:37,860
There was one girl that I knew and her family owned a place that did like tanning.

2338
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,920
Like, uh...

2339
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:40,500
What's the word?

2340
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:43,160
No, stop it doing that!

2341
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:45,200
Uh, fake the spray tans!

2342
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:46,820
And so I tried it.

2343
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:48,580
Okay, I didn't even go down.

2344
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:53,440
But anyway, I tried it, um...

2345
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,560
And then everyone still made fun of me.

2346
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:57,780
They were like, now you're orange!

2347
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:00,980
I could never win.

2348
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:03,120
I,

2349
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:26,800
you know, now I'm kind of more like, I look like a little more human-like, but I was, I was like pretty wisp-like before, you know, I didn't have so much energy to take on, like, a shape, and so I was kind of like blue-green, you know, I was pretty mint.

2350
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:32,940
It's like not.

2351
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:38,820
It's just like, it just does not mix well.

2352
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:43,580
Would you be freak phantom if you weren't pale?

2353
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:46,760
What does that have to do with it?

2354
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,220
Oh, I'm, oh.

2355
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,000
Doing it.

2356
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:00,300
Whatever that guy's name was.

2357
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:03,720
Braxton style, whatever his name was.

2358
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:04,060
Okay.

2359
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:06,940
Preparing everything, the 100%.

2360
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:11,120
Cleaning everything, 100%.

2361
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:13,180
I haven't touched the bathrooms.

2362
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:15,020
They're probably about to crumble.

2363
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:25,300
This one, one thing this game is teaching me is that people are slobs.

2364
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:35,660
I feel like this game comes very, um, like out of a, a place of, like, extreme anger.

2365
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,580
Like, it feels very personal.

2366
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,160
Or interesting.

2367
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:51,020
mint tea sounds kind of yummy really is this okay no why don't they use this one oh maybe

2368
02:13:57,770 --> 02:14:17,490

2369
02:14:19,590 --> 02:14:21,350
Dev worked in a water park?

2370
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:23,010
Maybe.

2371
02:14:26,630 --> 02:14:28,030
Oh, that sucks.

2372
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,310
I just wasted $5.

2373
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:30,970
Oh, well.

2374
02:14:31,150 --> 02:14:31,350
Okay.

2375
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:33,510
Alright, we've restocked.

2376
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:35,150
We cleaned everything.

2377
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:37,470
Um.

2378
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:41,190
Spread love with the water gun.

2379
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:42,390
Road to second star.

2380
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:44,590
And then clean smelly guests with water gun.

2381
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:46,990
Well, they have to, like, show up, no?

2382
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:49,190
I can't just spray a guy.

2383
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:54,690
What about you, Braylon?

2384
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:55,850
Where are you?

2385
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,400
Paint these stairs?

2386
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:03,240
We'll get there.

2387
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:03,700
Oh, wow.

2388
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:05,540
It doesn't extend all the way to the top.

2389
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:09,520
Horrible.

2390
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:11,220
Okay, let's go to sleep.

2391
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:12,920
Oh.

2392
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:20,770
A flock of seagulls are in the sky.

2393
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:25,950
I hear them.

2394
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:27,070
Okay.

2395
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:32,360
Is this... bad for business?

2396
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:40,020
Um...

2397
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:41,760
Um...

2398
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:42,480
Okay?

2399
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:51,520
Alright, Braylin, let's... let's get this bread!

2400
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:52,200
Yeah, yeah!

2401
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:56,860
The park is open!

2402
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:00,840
Wait, the seagulls poop?

2403
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:04,260
They're not gonna blame me for that, though, right?

2404
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:06,400
Am I gonna get sued for...

2405
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:08,960
For...

2406
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,680
The Seagulls are leaving a mess!

2407
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:11,980
Oh!

2408
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:19,540
Oh, it's like super intense amounts of poop.

2409
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:20,820
Oh my gosh!

2410
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:25,440
I just...

2411
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,760
I hear it non-stop!

2412
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:31,020
What is happening?

2413
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:33,060
They're getting louder!

2414
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:38,510
Grab the janitor.

2415
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:40,530
I don't think I have enough points yet!

2416
02:16:43,490 --> 02:16:45,430
They're even hiding it in the stairs!

2417
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:48,370
Oh, this is gonna suck!

2418
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:50,030
Wait, I think they're gone.

2419
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,510
I don't hear them anymore.

2420
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:54,210
Braylon screwed up the order on a visitor.

2421
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:55,670
Braylon.

2422
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:59,130
Braylon, I have too much to worry about here, buddy!

2423
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:02,070
You gotta hold your own!

2424
02:17:03,970 --> 02:17:06,190
You gotta hold your own.

2425
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:09,550
Lock in, Braylon.

2426
02:17:09,710 --> 02:17:10,630
The day just started.

2427
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:16,160
So they like being spread?

2428
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:21,980
Okay, I got one person.

2429
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,320
Two people?

2430
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:29,800
Yeah!

2431
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:35,980
Okay, we're working towards that two stars, baby.

2432
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:43,820
Yeah, Phoenix!

2433
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:45,260
Yeah!

2434
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,840
Yeah, wet t-shirt content!

2435
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,360
Oh!

2436
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:53,010
Where are you going?

2437
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:55,790
Where are you going?

2438
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:00,270
Woohoo!

2439
02:18:01,910 --> 02:18:02,350
Yeah!

2440
02:18:02,810 --> 02:18:04,370
Wait, oh, that's what I was gonna do too.

2441
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:06,730
Oh, we got the basic showers!

2442
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:09,330
What we can do is we can destroy...

2443
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:11,370
How do I delete it?

2444
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:13,970
Okay, hold on.

2445
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:14,350
Quit.

2446
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:18,550
What we're gonna do is we're going to add more...

2447
02:18:18,550 --> 02:18:19,530
Oh, I have some decorations.

2448
02:18:20,630 --> 02:18:21,310
Where are the seeds?

2449
02:18:21,330 --> 02:18:22,110
Here we go.

2450
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:26,570
We need to add more seats for people because remember people were getting tired.

2451
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:34,790
Upgrades.

2452
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:35,270
Yeah, yeah.

2453
02:18:35,390 --> 02:18:37,830
And then we get more research points too with that.

2454
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:39,150
Okay, hold on.

2455
02:18:39,390 --> 02:18:39,750
Now.

2456
02:18:40,350 --> 02:18:43,430
I can't get the janitorial staff until we're the two stars.

2457
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:44,290
Okay.

2458
02:18:45,310 --> 02:18:46,490
Two stars is a must.

2459
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:47,630
Everybody.

2460
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:48,570
Oh.

2461
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:51,750
Ooh.

2462
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:52,650
Yay!

2463
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:53,370
Yeah!

2464
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:54,130
Yeah!

2465
02:18:54,310 --> 02:18:54,430
Yeah!

2466
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:02,980
You get spread.

2467
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:04,000
You can spread.

2468
02:19:07,220 --> 02:19:07,660
Don't get up.

2469
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:08,320
Don't get up.

2470
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:09,320
Don't move.

2471
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:10,280
Don't move.

2472
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:11,680
Okay, you're fine.

2473
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:12,360
Oh, just kidding.

2474
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:14,600
Yeah, you had already fallen.

2475
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,420
Okay, so now I'm going to demolish this.

2476
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:22,240
Don't use it.

2477
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:23,860
Oops.

2478
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:25,540
My bad.

2479
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:28,700
Ivory is waiting.

2480
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,440
Don't use that.

2481
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:29,840
Sorry.

2482
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:34,520
Excuse me, Manny.

2483
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:42,720
Why she couldn't wait two seconds?

2484
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:53,140
Hot dog.

2485
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:54,440
Add both.

2486
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:57,820
Yes.

2487
02:19:58,980 --> 02:19:59,460
Add ketchup.

2488
02:20:03,070 --> 02:20:03,630
Best date ever.

2489
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:04,350
So true.

2490
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:04,890
Hello.

2491
02:20:05,790 --> 02:20:06,330
Add mustard.

2492
02:20:08,130 --> 02:20:08,570
Woohoo.

2493
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:09,090
Yes.

2494
02:20:09,610 --> 02:20:09,830
Oh.

2495
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:11,290
Add both.

2496
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:14,850
Yeah, yeah.

2497
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:16,090
Yeah, yeah, indeed.

2498
02:20:18,130 --> 02:20:18,970
Are you having fun?

2499
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:20,890
Do you like it?

2500
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:27,720
Okay.

2501
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:30,100
We just got that achievement.

2502
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:34,120
Somebody is drowning.

2503
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,260
Oh, there's two people drowning.

2504
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:37,480
I need to save one!

2505
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,100
Two people are drowning and I can only save one!

2506
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:43,320
Oh my gosh.

2507
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:45,980
Um...

2508
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:47,580
Demi, hold on!

2509
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:49,460
Don't run off with that, Phoenix.

2510
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,240
Phoenix, please.

2511
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:50,820
Phoenix.

2512
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:51,480
Please.

2513
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:52,320
Please, I need this.

2514
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:52,840
Please.

2515
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:54,620
You can...

2516
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:55,260
You pick it!

2517
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:57,720
Oh my gosh.

2518
02:20:58,260 --> 02:21:01,000
We almost didn't get to save both of them.

2519
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:01,900
Well, we did.

2520
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,440
We saved both of them.

2521
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:05,360
Poop?

2522
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:07,020
Wait, where's Poop?

2523
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,700
Where was Poop at?

2524
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:16,400
In here?

2525
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:17,500
I don't see any.

2526
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:18,940
This is so stressful.

2527
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:19,660
Right?

2528
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,460
Oh, hello.

2529
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:22,440
Um, add mustard.

2530
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:25,780
The bin?

2531
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:27,400
Oh, I got it.

2532
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:28,280
I'll get it.

2533
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:29,020
Sorry, ma'am.

2534
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:33,380
Near the filter.

2535
02:21:37,390 --> 02:21:38,630
Oh, that's a gun.

2536
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:40,050
Near the filter, a poop?

2537
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:43,150
Oh, this bird poop!

2538
02:21:48,050 --> 02:21:49,090
Can people...

2539
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:51,210
slip on the poop, I wonder.

2540
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:54,790
This is trash.

2541
02:21:56,950 --> 02:21:57,490
We got it.

2542
02:21:58,170 --> 02:22:02,050
I gotta move this water gun or else I'm gonna forever.

2543
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:07,350
Actually, I'll hold on to it just in case more smelly people come because we need to get three more smellies.

2544
02:22:08,510 --> 02:22:10,470
Three more stinky nasties.

2545
02:22:13,730 --> 02:22:16,830
I think we should put, like, a sign that says, careful.

2546
02:22:18,450 --> 02:22:19,810
You might slip.

2547
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:21,370
Oh, hello.

2548
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,150
Add both.

2549
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:26,670
There you go.

2550
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:29,390
We're gonna have to go buy more hot dogs soon.

2551
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:30,950
Someone just slept?

2552
02:22:32,050 --> 02:22:32,590
Am I crazy?

2553
02:22:33,210 --> 02:22:34,110
Am I hearing things?

2554
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:38,280
Oh.

2555
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:39,240
Sorry.

2556
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,180
This is Power Wash Simulator.

2557
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:50,180
I thought it was gonna be more like Power Wash Simulator, but it is actual chaos.

2558
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:52,980
My Yoshi is a menace.

2559
02:22:56,680 --> 02:23:00,670
I, I'm doing my best here.

2560
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:08,510
Um, let's start repairing things before they go out of craziness.

2561
02:23:15,710 --> 02:23:17,290
Everything's gonna start breaking soon.

2562
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:24,350
And then people are gonna start breaking their backs and suing me, even though it says out of, out of commission, you know?

2563
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:32,470
You're sleeping.

2564
02:23:34,390 --> 02:23:38,650
Yeah, Power Wash, I thought I was going to be like, oh, yeah, we'll chill and I'll talk.

2565
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:41,670
Braylon is too tired.

2566
02:23:42,110 --> 02:23:43,330
Okay, now we have to...

2567
02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:43,450
Ew.

2568
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:48,820
What do you want?

2569
02:23:50,060 --> 02:23:50,460
Plane.

2570
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,420
Okay, we got to be on the lookout for...

2571
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,700
Oh, for the people.

2572
02:24:01,580 --> 02:24:01,940
Hello.

2573
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:02,620
Adult.

2574
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:06,320
It's been forever since we've done this, huh?

2575
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:08,000
Oh, that's Brailin.

2576
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:11,480
Okay, I thought that was somebody breaking in.

2577
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,440
Drowning?

2578
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:14,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, thank you guys.

2579
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,840
Where's the, where's the?

2580
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,460
Thank goodness indeed, huh?

2581
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:22,960
Yep.

2582
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:25,280
It's a good thing Chat was here.

2583
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:26,460
Oh, oh.

2584
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:29,680
First you drown, and then you...

2585
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:30,920
Oh, sorry.

2586
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:33,160
Sputtle's got a vendetta.

2587
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:34,600
Oh.

2588
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,020
Ray, are you good?

2589
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,980
If only there was a bin right here, idiot.

2590
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:43,920
Hello?

2591
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:47,980
You are a bastard!

2592
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,220
Yeah, you deserve that.

2593
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:54,240
You deserve that!

2594
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:55,120
Come back to me.

2595
02:24:59,220 --> 02:25:02,020
We helped him get out of the park faster.

2596
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:08,760
Waiting for a hot dog.

2597
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:10,140
Girl!

2598
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:12,680
Damn, Sadie, okay.

2599
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:14,480
She wants me.

2600
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:15,500
Yes?

2601
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:16,660
Add ketchup.

2602
02:25:19,060 --> 02:25:20,740
That's only 4 p.m.

2603
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:22,860
Oh, golly!

2604
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,020
More trash!

2605
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:30,200
Oh, Braylin's back, thank God.

2606
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:30,700
Okay.

2607
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:33,400
We're gonna put our tiny trash bag right there.

2608
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:35,160
Everybody remember it.

2609
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:38,020
Hello, bye-bye.

2610
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:38,660
Thank you.

2611
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:46,970
Easy toes!

2612
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:48,130
Thank you so much for the time.

2613
02:25:48,170 --> 02:25:49,150
You have to thank you!

2614
02:25:49,630 --> 02:25:50,290
Oh, golly.

2615
02:25:50,590 --> 02:25:50,590
Okay.

2616
02:25:51,530 --> 02:25:52,470
Everybody, watch out.

2617
02:25:52,830 --> 02:25:53,370
Watch your toes.

2618
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:55,770
Watch your feet.

2619
02:25:56,130 --> 02:25:56,890
Watch your everything.

2620
02:25:57,930 --> 02:25:57,950
Watch.

2621
02:25:58,730 --> 02:26:00,110
Oh, let me go grab my trash bag.

2622
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:02,230
Thank goodness we have bigger pockets now, huh?

2623
02:26:02,510 --> 02:26:03,950
Who kicked us in there?

2624
02:26:05,170 --> 02:26:05,470
Wait.

2625
02:26:09,010 --> 02:26:09,270
Eh?

2626
02:26:10,430 --> 02:26:10,950
Eh?

2627
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:12,550
Huh.

2628
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:14,730
Why didn't...

2629
02:26:15,430 --> 02:26:15,770
Oh.

2630
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:16,690
Oh, hello?

2631
02:26:17,850 --> 02:26:18,870
Catch up.

2632
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:25,210
Okay.

2633
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:26,550
Trash.

2634
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:30,910
Probably from you, the culprit, right there in front of me.

2635
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:37,050
Let me trash.

2636
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:37,910
Let me poo.

2637
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:41,850
Ten bucks for a hot dog.

2638
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:43,050
Yeah, what of it, huh?

2639
02:26:43,470 --> 02:26:45,370
I'm trying to run a business here.

2640
02:26:47,570 --> 02:26:48,790
It ain't easy.

2641
02:26:49,010 --> 02:26:51,450
You see how hard I'm working right now?

2642
02:26:54,390 --> 02:26:57,410
I'm working my butt off.

2643
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:59,770
No rest when you're dead.

2644
02:27:00,410 --> 02:27:01,750
None at all.

2645
02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:03,050
Uh-oh.

2646
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:03,970
Life ring!

2647
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:09,490
I am your hero.

2648
02:27:09,630 --> 02:27:10,090
You're welcome.

2649
02:27:10,830 --> 02:27:11,650
I love you.

2650
02:27:16,110 --> 02:27:16,970
Oh, sorry.

2651
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:18,390
Another one drowning?

2652
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:22,900
I'm safe now.

2653
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:28,040
When can we get...

2654
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:41,120
I can't wait until this turns into like an idle game or like, you know, IDLE, like an idle work game where I just run around and do a little bit of stuff, but everyone else does everything for me, you know?

2655
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:44,580
I can't... What does that... What does that happen?

2656
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:47,420
Panicking.

2657
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:52,820
Don't do that!

2658
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,020
Oh, thank goodness.

2659
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:57,440
The day is over.

2660
02:28:03,010 --> 02:28:03,530
Okay.

2661
02:28:05,050 --> 02:28:06,470
My income was...

2662
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:10,350
Not a lot.

2663
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:16,840
I see something in the water, you do?

2664
02:28:20,700 --> 02:28:21,020
Ugh.

2665
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:23,400
We can finally fix everything.

2666
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:26,240
All this stuff.

2667
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:30,940
We need to start getting upgrades that don't, like, need fixing every two seconds, you know.

2668
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:35,060
Floor injuries?

2669
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:38,840
Nothing.

2670
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:41,020
No issues.

2671
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,460
Second star for Repair Man.

2672
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:49,420
But Repair Man, was that two stars or was it just janitor?

2673
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:51,160
We'll go check.

2674
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:57,560
If you guys want to feel stressed while playing video games.

2675
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:00,960
Not relaxed at all.

2676
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,200
I would recommend this.

2677
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:04,860
Repair was only one.

2678
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:05,420
Okay, okay.

2679
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,700
We'll get that guy.

2680
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:07,660
Let's go get him right in there.

2681
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:28,330
wait handyman staff wait I I did get this one wait maybe I have to buy them ah I have to hire them

2682
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:35,580
they're expensive

2683
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:43,580
charge your tablet

2684
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:51,930
isn't it me or did Braylon's efficiency go down

2685
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:02,910
Do you have enough income?

2686
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:04,150
I don't think so.

2687
02:30:05,490 --> 02:30:07,050
I don't think so.

2688
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:12,360
Get the cheapest guy.

2689
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:14,200
Lorenzo.

2690
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:20,000
Well, we can test him for one day.

2691
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,460
And see if he's worth it, you know.

2692
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,640
We'll test him for one day.

2693
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:28,740
And it might be like, he sucks.

2694
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:30,660
And...

2695
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:35,760
And he doesn't do anything, you know?

2696
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:40,040
And if that's the case...

2697
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:44,640
Um...

2698
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:46,600
Then we can fire him after one day.

2699
02:30:52,470 --> 02:30:54,130
I think I got all the chairs.

2700
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:57,410
He'll...

2701
02:30:58,030 --> 02:30:59,770
Then we give him the hammer.

2702
02:31:01,430 --> 02:31:03,110
And he'll get the hammer no matter what.

2703
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:07,900
Okay.

2704
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:27,200
janitor over worker yeah but i still have to get more smelly people i still need three more smellies to come to my park to stink up the place before i can uh even get the janitor i think we'll have enough for both oh yeah well i would still have to hire the janitor home

2705
02:31:39,640 --> 02:32:10,400
let's do um basic slide we could like upgrade a bunch of stuff know any smellies in chat i think we could get some like slides and pools and upgrade everything overnight new pool i can get tips

2706
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:24,860
hmm i

2707
02:32:28,050 --> 02:32:32,710
don't think i need walk speed right now maybe if i because We're kind of zooming around.

2708
02:32:32,850 --> 02:32:40,150
I think maybe Waxbeard would be better once we increase the size of the park, I'd say.

2709
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:50,620
How do I delete you?

2710
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:54,440
How do I delete you?

2711
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:57,860
I think I just have to destroy it, huh?

2712
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:58,800
With the sledgehammer?

2713
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:01,420
Oh.

2714
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:02,520
Oh, it's fire.

2715
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:05,480
Oh, I do get money back for that.

2716
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:06,320
Wait, that's huge.

2717
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:06,640
Huge!

2718
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:12,620
Okay, so we get money back from destroying things.

2719
02:33:16,910 --> 02:33:17,830
Is it the...

2720
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:20,070
Is it the same amount?

2721
02:33:20,210 --> 02:33:21,830
I'm not quite sure, honestly.

2722
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:27,250
Let's see how much it is.

2723
02:33:28,190 --> 02:33:29,270
For the slide.

2724
02:33:29,970 --> 02:33:30,470
Or for this.

2725
02:33:31,010 --> 02:33:31,750
It's 30...

2726
02:33:31,750 --> 02:33:33,270
Okay, so it's a partial rebound.

2727
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:34,090
What?

2728
02:33:34,850 --> 02:33:37,730
Oh, we can make shapes!

2729
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:43,700
Oh, circle pool!

2730
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:46,840
That's exciting.

2731
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:49,300
That's exciting.

2732
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:52,120
That's exciting very much so.

2733
02:33:56,250 --> 02:33:57,210
Wait, I'm...

2734
02:33:57,210 --> 02:33:58,210
I don't want...

2735
02:33:58,210 --> 02:33:59,450
Here, we'll put this...

2736
02:33:59,450 --> 02:34:01,730
The repair thing, like...

2737
02:34:01,730 --> 02:34:03,150
On this side.

2738
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:05,030
Okay.

2739
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:06,910
Spherical.

2740
02:34:08,530 --> 02:34:08,970
Oh!

2741
02:34:10,510 --> 02:34:11,030
Wow.

2742
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:12,730
And then we're going to...

2743
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:13,630
move this.

2744
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:16,790
I'm making myself a genuine park, everybody.

2745
02:34:17,370 --> 02:34:18,370
This is gonna be nice.

2746
02:34:19,410 --> 02:34:20,910
Wait, there's like a snap feature.

2747
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:21,450
Here we go.

2748
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:26,680
There we go.

2749
02:34:28,460 --> 02:34:28,480
Yeah.

2750
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:29,960
Wait, I want you closer.

2751
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:30,660
Nice.

2752
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:33,040
Get close with your shower mate.

2753
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:37,760
And then we'll get a pool or a diving board.

2754
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:40,880
Diving board.

2755
02:34:43,340 --> 02:34:43,900
Okay.

2756
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:46,360
Slides.

2757
02:34:47,580 --> 02:34:48,260
Do I have...

2758
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:50,140
I'm trying to think.

2759
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,480
Can I move myself?

2760
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:56,700
Uh...

2761
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:57,140
Here?

2762
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:03,100
Here?

2763
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:05,520
Wait, what did I do with the sledgehammer?

2764
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:06,620
Ah!

2765
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:07,460
Oh!

2766
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:08,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2767
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:09,520
Yeah.

2768
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:10,000
No.

2769
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:10,500
Hammer.

2770
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:11,620
It's a regular hammer.

2771
02:35:15,370 --> 02:35:17,750
I don't think I upgraded the slides.

2772
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:20,290
Okay.

2773
02:35:20,310 --> 02:35:22,410
Now my $10, um...

2774
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:27,230
Now my $10 hot dog is justified.

2775
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:31,530
Okay, let's go back into here.

2776
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:32,930
Wait, move again.

2777
02:35:33,610 --> 02:35:34,430
Like move over here.

2778
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:34,830
Okay.

2779
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:37,150
Okay, pools.

2780
02:35:38,910 --> 02:35:40,190
Rectangular pool.

2781
02:35:42,210 --> 02:35:44,230
Whoa, it's so big though.

2782
02:35:44,350 --> 02:35:45,770
Let's do funky shapes instead.

2783
02:35:46,270 --> 02:35:46,610
Wow.

2784
02:35:48,030 --> 02:35:49,390
I'm gonna build a rocket.

2785
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,580
Where the wisps trying to shower together at.

2786
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:00,720
We'll do like this.

2787
02:36:01,100 --> 02:36:03,120
Wow, it's so like...

2788
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:04,460
Wow, fancy.

2789
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,060
It's like a hat.

2790
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:08,720
Oh, D!

2791
02:36:09,380 --> 02:36:10,260
Wait, you're right.

2792
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:11,160
Just like the game.

2793
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:12,800
Kojima does it again.

2794
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:15,880
Oh, wait.

2795
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:16,920
I gotta move all these.

2796
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:20,260
One moment, please.

2797
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:22,120
Oh, D.

2798
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:24,040
Uncle Jumbo does it again.

2799
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:33,220
Up here.

2800
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:34,180
D.

2801
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:36,700
Oh, D.

2802
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:45,220
Just like that.

2803
02:36:45,880 --> 02:36:46,180
Oh, wait.

2804
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:46,800
Better.

2805
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:47,560
Better one.

2806
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:48,200
There we go.

2807
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,040
Another diving ward.

2808
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:52,600
Oh, yeah.

2809
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:53,520
Okay.

2810
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:55,040
We don't have a lot of money left.

2811
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:57,360
But.

2812
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:01,420
This might save us some grief.

2813
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:02,540
You know?

2814
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,280
This might save us.

2815
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:08,000
The fact that we aren't hiring someone.

2816
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:10,200
My eyes!

2817
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:16,690
It's really fancy.

2818
02:37:17,050 --> 02:37:18,230
It's fancy, isn't it?

2819
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:22,410
And then we go back and there was like some decoration that we could get.

2820
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:25,570
Ooh, planter.

2821
02:37:26,530 --> 02:37:27,510
How much are you?

2822
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:28,430
Free?

2823
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:29,630
Okay.

2824
02:37:30,910 --> 02:37:31,330
Nice.

2825
02:37:32,410 --> 02:37:33,010
What is this?

2826
02:37:33,070 --> 02:37:33,710
A fountain?

2827
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:35,830
Wait, can I put this in the pool?

2828
02:37:37,210 --> 02:37:38,530
Make it like a little nipple.

2829
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:42,470
Okay, awesome.

2830
02:37:58,480 --> 02:37:59,780
Oh, oops.

2831
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:02,000
I'm getting really excited about my park.

2832
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:10,540
I could have made it two boobs.

2833
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:13,460
Missed opportunity.

2834
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:14,980
My bad.

2835
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:24,950
I'm trying to like keep them all kind of close-ish so I don't have to go running around.

2836
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:26,310
You know what I mean?

2837
02:38:31,210 --> 02:38:32,590
I could like, can I rotate?

2838
02:38:32,730 --> 02:38:33,130
Oh, I can.

2839
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:35,710
Okay, there we go.

2840
02:38:41,240 --> 02:38:44,300
We get your relaxation out of the way.

2841
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:45,720
All right.

2842
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:47,980
Now it doesn't...

2843
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:48,700
No slide?

2844
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:50,100
Oh, yeah.

2845
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:51,780
We can do a slide.

2846
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:54,100
We can still do the slide.

2847
02:38:54,340 --> 02:38:54,600
Don't worry.

2848
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:55,880
It's gonna happen.

2849
02:38:56,460 --> 02:38:57,760
I just don't know where to put it.

2850
02:38:57,900 --> 02:38:58,280
Okay, hold

2851
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:02,120
on.

2852
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:04,400
Don't say rip slide just yet.

2853
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:05,980
Um...

2854
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:09,380
It looks like a Q.

2855
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:10,440
QD.

2856
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:13,700
Where should I put it?

2857
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:16,260
The pool spells out OD.

2858
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:19,080
What kind of pool party is this?

2859
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:20,180
It's a...

2860
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:21,240
It's a...

2861
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:22,320
It's a...

2862
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:23,340
Pool party.

2863
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:27,560
Wait.

2864
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:29,800
I didn't mean to do that.

2865
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:34,940
We're gonna move some stuff.

2866
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:36,320
Okay.

2867
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,680
We're gonna move some stuff.

2868
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:41,660
I'm, like, really low...

2869
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:41,920
Wait.

2870
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:43,920
I'm... I'm getting...

2871
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:46,760
I'm... Low on room.

2872
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:51,100
Words are really hard, okay?

2873
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:51,920
Okay.

2874
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:57,200
I'm gonna put this trash can here, too, since people just don't know how to get to it.

2875
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,580
Low on money.

2876
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:07,260
Okay, this is what we'll do.

2877
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:13,480
Wait, I saw it.

2878
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:17,760
green color I saw it

2879
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:49,250
we'll have to invest in a better slide later one that tor turns and twists is it because of the what's it called I wonder the it might be because of the the filter please

2880
02:40:53,980 --> 02:40:54,740
Please.

2881
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:57,340
Please.

2882
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:00,220
Please.

2883
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:00,880
Please.

2884
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:03,620
These people can line up.

2885
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:07,280
Oh my god.

2886
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:15,020
No fun allowed.

2887
02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:18,460
No!

2888
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:23,220
What else can we do?

2889
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:27,000
We sold out.

2890
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:27,500
We sold.

2891
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:28,120
We were...

2892
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:29,300
We went too fancy.

2893
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:31,040
You know?

2894
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,240
Our values.

2895
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:42,680
We forgot what was important, what the children loved.

2896
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:44,460
Wait, why can't I move the fountain?

2897
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:48,340
Okay, it's just gonna be a lopsided boob, okay?

2898
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:50,440
It's very common.

2899
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:56,450
Why can't I move it?

2900
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:01,820
Come on, let me try and get in nice and close.

2901
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:04,420
No, please!

2902
02:42:08,310 --> 02:42:08,770
Oh, no!

2903
02:42:09,830 --> 02:42:11,190
The fountain!

2904
02:42:14,810 --> 02:42:15,890
Right into the fountain.

2905
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:19,850
Yeah, you'll just face plant straight into like the...

2906
02:42:22,030 --> 02:42:24,770
Straight into the metal pipes.

2907
02:42:25,850 --> 02:42:26,590
How exciting.

2908
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:28,170
And liberating.

2909
02:42:30,430 --> 02:42:33,330
Everybody loves that feeling.

2910
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:37,570
Okay, I'm going to try and move the pool.

2911
02:42:40,170 --> 02:42:41,790
So that we can then...

2912
02:42:42,950 --> 02:42:44,170
Grab the fountain.

2913
02:42:45,430 --> 02:42:45,750
I saw it.

2914
02:42:45,850 --> 02:42:46,470
I saw the light.

2915
02:42:48,650 --> 02:42:51,830
At last I see the light.

2916
02:42:53,270 --> 02:42:53,410
Okay.

2917
02:42:54,110 --> 02:42:54,830
You move you.

2918
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:55,930
All right.

2919
02:42:56,690 --> 02:42:57,750
Back to ODing.

2920
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:02,690
I went the wrong way.

2921
02:43:09,190 --> 02:43:09,870
And...

2922
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:10,170
And...

2923
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:10,970
And...

2924
02:43:10,970 --> 02:43:11,550
Straight in the middle.

2925
02:43:13,850 --> 02:43:14,650
Okay.

2926
02:43:16,930 --> 02:43:17,590
Okay!

2927
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:21,570
We managed that!

2928
02:43:22,590 --> 02:43:24,210
We did that.

2929
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:25,310
Team?

2930
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:27,210
How are we feeling?

2931
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,220
Look how nice our place looks now.

2932
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:35,540
Fish.

2933
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:38,500
This is fancy.

2934
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:40,280
And they're bigger pools.

2935
02:43:45,050 --> 02:43:46,510
Well, one of them is.

2936
02:43:46,830 --> 02:43:47,110
Okay.

2937
02:43:50,810 --> 02:43:52,030
All right, Braylin, good night.

2938
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:53,290
See you tomorrow.

2939
02:43:56,070 --> 02:43:57,230
Oh, I forgot to build my stuff.

2940
02:43:57,610 --> 02:43:57,790
Oops.

2941
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:02,920
Oh, here we go.

2942
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:04,460
Build slide.

2943
02:44:09,730 --> 02:44:11,610
And wasn't there something else I forgot to build?

2944
02:44:11,950 --> 02:44:12,550
Or am I crazy?

2945
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:15,870
I thought I said build two things.

2946
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:17,450
I guess not.

2947
02:44:17,850 --> 02:44:18,810
I don't see anything else.

2948
02:44:19,810 --> 02:44:20,110
Yahoo!

2949
02:44:21,030 --> 02:44:22,550
Braylin, it's going to be a great day.

2950
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:24,130
It's going to be a great day.

2951
02:44:24,150 --> 02:44:39,130
day buddy i'm broke yeah but we're gonna make huge bucks today i'm not gonna hit a single person and nobody will die so we won't pay any fines already

2952
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:48,480

2953
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:55,880
oh i'm getting way too ahead of myself

2954
02:45:01,330 --> 02:45:03,390
Hey Amito, I'm a newer wisp.

2955
02:45:04,070 --> 02:45:05,850
Hi, I've been watching some old vibes.

2956
02:45:06,290 --> 02:45:08,090
Can you explain what a zoom beanie is?

2957
02:45:08,690 --> 02:45:18,230
A zoom beanie is a guy.

2958
02:45:18,970 --> 02:45:19,810
A little guy.

2959
02:45:20,270 --> 02:45:22,630
He goes on a great great adventure.

2960
02:45:23,850 --> 02:45:25,350
A great journey.

2961
02:45:26,370 --> 02:45:27,470
Wow, look at our line.

2962
02:45:28,350 --> 02:45:29,970
Are you gonna are you gonna get the Braylon?

2963
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:40,100
Yeah, she likes it.

2964
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:44,180
She doesn't...

2965
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:45,660
You're out of water park, man.

2966
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:48,620
Don't act like you're better than me.

2967
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:52,600
Whoa.

2968
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:01,540
Yeah, yeah!

2969
02:46:02,700 --> 02:46:04,760
This kind of makes me want to go to the pool.

2970
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:06,240
I'm not gonna lie.

2971
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:09,680
This makes me want to go to the pool, too.

2972
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:15,200
Oh, sorry, Grace.

2973
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:15,760
You okay?

2974
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:18,020
She, like, whined about it.

2975
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:18,740
So cute.

2976
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:20,820
She was like, Uh-huh, uh-huh.

2977
02:46:23,160 --> 02:46:24,440
Raylan screwed up.

2978
02:46:24,700 --> 02:46:25,160
Raylan!

2979
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:27,700
No, sir, please.

2980
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:32,200
Take our sincerest apologies.

2981
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:42,520
You want to go to the bike park.

2982
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:45,700
No, you don't say boring.

2983
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:49,020
New research point.

2984
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:50,740
You want to come to my park.

2985
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:52,260
Shit.

2986
02:46:52,900 --> 02:46:53,940
Everyone's a hater.

2987
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:56,840
Did I get you already?

2988
02:46:58,220 --> 02:46:58,800
Best day ever.

2989
02:46:59,020 --> 02:46:59,920
Ivory's waiting for a hot dog?

2990
02:47:00,820 --> 02:47:01,600
Anika's drowning?

2991
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:06,790
Hot dog.

2992
02:47:07,290 --> 02:47:08,290
Did Ivory stalk a kid?

2993
02:47:09,190 --> 02:47:09,850
Kind of.

2994
02:47:10,930 --> 02:47:12,170
Did someone steal one?

2995
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:21,430
Ivory got her hot dog and was just like...

2996
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:24,200
Not today.

2997
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:28,600
It hit her immediately.

2998
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:32,260
The dogs will do that to you.

2999
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:38,060
I saw the trash there.

3000
02:47:38,260 --> 02:47:39,480
I'm getting my trash bag.

3001
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:42,640
Don't worry about it.

3002
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:43,260
Don't complain.

3003
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:45,840
Oh, Ivory, are you okay?

3004
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:46,840
What did you do, girl?

3005
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:49,400
How did you fall?

3006
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:52,680
Like, actually.

3007
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:55,860
How did you fall?

3008
02:47:56,700 --> 02:47:59,200
Can I get some smelly people in here, please?

3009
02:48:01,760 --> 02:48:01,920
Oh.

3010
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:04,840
Add both.

3011
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:09,990
I wish I could afford, like, uh, you know.

3012
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:12,750
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3013
02:48:14,310 --> 02:48:15,390
You're safe now.

3014
02:48:15,550 --> 02:48:15,990
Who are you?

3015
02:48:16,130 --> 02:48:16,630
Who are you?

3016
02:48:18,730 --> 02:48:19,770
Indiana Jones!

3017
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:32,300
Is my park not safe?

3018
02:48:32,740 --> 02:48:34,640
Why did she scream like that?

3019
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:44,000
Is my park not safe?

3020
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:47,740
Did you see him?

3021
02:48:47,900 --> 02:48:55,260
He went, he jumped out backwards from one pool and straight into the other one.

3022
02:48:56,340 --> 02:48:57,400
Uh-oh, please don't get up.

3023
02:48:57,720 --> 02:48:58,220
Don't move.

3024
02:48:58,600 --> 02:48:59,880
Do not move your feet.

3025
02:49:00,220 --> 02:49:00,900
Thank you.

3026
02:49:07,810 --> 02:49:09,390
I am concerned.

3027
02:49:09,730 --> 02:49:10,190
No, no, no!

3028
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:12,310
Oh, thank God.

3029
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:20,900
If you're hungry, come over to Hot Dog.

3030
02:49:21,080 --> 02:49:21,640
It's only $10.

3031
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:22,980
Why is everybody in one?

3032
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:26,140
It's just a catastrophe.

3033
02:49:28,620 --> 02:49:29,200
No, stop!

3034
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:32,300
Why is everybody only in one pool?

3035
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:36,880
Curious.

3036
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:38,780
Curious.

3037
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:41,200
Come on.

3038
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:42,640
Why though?

3039
02:49:43,020 --> 02:49:44,180
It's a massacre.

3040
02:49:48,610 --> 02:49:48,870
Hello.

3041
02:49:49,330 --> 02:49:49,870
Plane.

3042
02:49:50,190 --> 02:49:50,910
I like that.

3043
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:55,310
Do they not like the fountain?

3044
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:02,500
I wonder...

3045
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:05,940
Kobe!

3046
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:09,380
Oh, hot dog.

3047
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:11,180
Hello?

3048
02:50:12,580 --> 02:50:13,120
Plane.

3049
02:50:16,300 --> 02:50:17,500
Add both.

3050
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:22,260
See, I like it when they ask for a plane because it's way less, uh, oh shoot.

3051
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:25,080
Oh my god!

3052
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:25,860
COVID!

3053
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:26,620
COVID!

3054
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:27,300
COVID!

3055
02:50:28,120 --> 02:50:28,720
Whoa!

3056
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:55,490
Oh, she's already She got COVID Oh, she got COVID Oh, I got COVID Oh, my God Oh, my God, it's a massacre Oh, my God, oh, my God Oh, my God, oh, my God Please let me Please let me Leave it Oh, but not

3057
02:51:00,700 --> 02:51:07,800
the COVID, COVID, COVID I don't have any Sorry, we're sold out

3058
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:12,340
What is this circling?

3059
02:51:12,420 --> 02:51:13,600
Oh, the restock thing.

3060
02:51:16,380 --> 02:51:17,300
Don't walk there.

3061
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:17,980
Damn it.

3062
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:22,720
You're just gonna have to move.

3063
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:24,120
You're just gonna have to let it happen.

3064
02:51:24,640 --> 02:51:25,680
You're just gonna have to let it happen.

3065
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:34,720
Some people are like, I think I ruined our park, everybody.

3066
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:42,040
I think we've...

3067
02:51:42,620 --> 02:51:44,240
I think we made it worse.

3068
02:51:44,480 --> 02:51:45,420
Just let it happen.

3069
02:51:45,580 --> 02:51:45,780
Okay.

3070
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:54,780
It's a madhouse.

3071
02:51:54,960 --> 02:51:55,840
It really is.

3072
02:51:57,340 --> 02:51:59,800
It really is an absolute madhouse.

3073
02:52:01,560 --> 02:52:02,060
Oh my gosh.

3074
02:52:07,870 --> 02:52:10,030
People are just sleeping on the ground.

3075
02:52:12,170 --> 02:52:13,410
My pools are getting dirty.

3076
02:52:16,690 --> 02:52:17,890
And more wear and tear.

3077
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:25,620
The pool contractors should be sued for not making drains.

3078
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:28,340
For real though.

3079
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:31,700
I'm surprised I didn't smack that lady.

3080
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:33,120
I'm going to get rid of the fountain.

3081
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:38,640
I don't think people like the fountain.

3082
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:47,040
Raiden, what are you doing?

3083
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:47,900
Are you on break?

3084
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:50,560
Okay, nobody's here.

3085
02:52:57,790 --> 02:52:58,230
Uh, plane?

3086
02:52:58,530 --> 02:52:58,730
Yeah.

3087
02:52:59,270 --> 02:53:00,030
I see him drowning.

3088
02:53:00,190 --> 02:53:00,610
I'll get him.

3089
02:53:01,150 --> 02:53:01,630
Thank you.

3090
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:06,050
Ow, was a close one.

3091
02:53:06,730 --> 02:53:07,370
Oh, me too.

3092
02:53:08,850 --> 02:53:09,190
Man.

3093
02:53:12,850 --> 02:53:14,170
Everybody down!

3094
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:16,510
Hello!

3095
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:17,730
Slide pass!

3096
02:53:18,210 --> 02:53:20,250
Oh, Braden, you get me every time!

3097
02:53:20,410 --> 02:53:21,570
Dude, I can't see!

3098
02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:24,790
I- I- please!

3099
02:53:27,090 --> 02:53:28,470
I gotta get that lady.

3100
02:53:28,870 --> 02:53:30,530
She just- I gotta kill her.

3101
02:53:31,130 --> 02:53:32,690
Look at her little evil emoji.

3102
02:53:33,970 --> 02:53:35,190
Yeah, you slide there.

3103
02:53:42,380 --> 02:53:45,100
Have 100 visitors slip on puddles.

3104
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:48,440
Me too!

3105
02:53:48,820 --> 02:53:49,780
Oh my gosh.

3106
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:53,040
Whambo combo, baby.

3107
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:54,960
Okay.

3108
02:53:55,640 --> 02:53:56,820
Let's repair these.

3109
02:54:06,170 --> 02:54:07,130
Ah, everybody.

3110
02:54:07,930 --> 02:54:12,130
This is the most stressful stimulator game I think I've ever played in my entire afterlife.

3111
02:54:13,070 --> 02:54:13,790
Waiting for a hot dog.

3112
02:54:13,890 --> 02:54:14,750
Okay, one moment, please.

3113
02:54:15,490 --> 02:54:16,510
Oh, no, no, no.

3114
02:54:16,590 --> 02:54:17,610
No, don't do it!

3115
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:20,410
Okay.

3116
02:54:22,310 --> 02:54:23,430
I'm on my way!

3117
02:54:23,550 --> 02:54:24,670
What would you like?

3118
02:54:27,670 --> 02:54:28,730
Thank you.

3119
02:54:33,610 --> 02:54:34,850
Did I say stimulator?

3120
02:54:35,150 --> 02:54:37,050
I'm saying simulator, you guys.

3121
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:38,230
Come on!

3122
02:54:39,930 --> 02:54:42,170
Get your heads out of the pool!

3123
02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:45,430
Get your heads out of the chlorine!

3124
02:54:46,330 --> 02:54:47,290
I'm sick!

3125
02:54:47,670 --> 02:54:48,390
I have a list!

3126
02:54:48,910 --> 02:54:49,470
I don't know!

3127
02:54:51,210 --> 02:54:52,470
Everything's wrong with me!

3128
02:54:54,510 --> 02:54:56,370
Are you not stimulated?

3129
02:54:59,150 --> 02:55:00,690
Rusty Loungeer is broken.

3130
02:55:00,870 --> 02:55:01,370
Oh, gosh.

3131
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:03,030
Oh, that was still small.

3132
02:55:03,630 --> 02:55:03,890
Dang it.

3133
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:04,390
I messed up.

3134
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:04,870
Add ketchup.

3135
02:55:06,630 --> 02:55:08,510
I think I'm heavily stimulated.

3136
02:55:08,710 --> 02:55:09,410
I'm not going to lie.

3137
02:55:10,250 --> 02:55:10,910
What's broken?

3138
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:15,920
Which one's broken?

3139
02:55:16,180 --> 02:55:17,020
Get off of it.

3140
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:17,540
A mirror.

3141
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:21,040
Please move.

3142
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:21,720
Thank you.

3143
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:28,420
You're not wrong.

3144
02:55:28,540 --> 02:55:29,620
It's very stimulating.

3145
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:30,240
Yes.

3146
02:55:30,960 --> 02:55:32,080
I'm running around.

3147
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:34,580
doing everything that I possibly can.

3148
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:38,300
I need more stinky people.

3149
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:39,960
How do I get more smelly guests?

3150
02:55:43,180 --> 02:55:44,800
Maybe I gotta get rid of the showers.

3151
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:47,160
I keep...

3152
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:47,840
I'm getting...

3153
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:49,360
Oh, clean 100...

3154
02:55:49,360 --> 02:55:49,940
Oh, no, sorry.

3155
02:55:50,340 --> 02:55:51,440
500 attractions.

3156
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:52,780
Wow.

3157
02:55:55,980 --> 02:55:57,820
Someone's panicking on the diving board.

3158
02:55:59,240 --> 02:56:02,320
Yeah, maybe if I get rid of the showers, they'll be more stinky.

3159
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:03,660
Oh, sorry.

3160
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:12,380
Please.

3161
02:56:14,460 --> 02:56:18,080
I don't want to be a business owner anymore.

3162
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:21,680
I hate being my own boss.

3163
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:24,000
An actual maid.

3164
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:27,760
I'm here.

3165
02:56:27,940 --> 02:56:28,840
You are here.

3166
02:56:29,440 --> 02:56:30,160
Oh, hello.

3167
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:30,740
Oh.

3168
02:56:34,790 --> 02:56:35,910
6 p.m.

3169
02:56:35,910 --> 02:56:37,090
Wait, we are...

3170
02:56:37,110 --> 02:56:38,310
We made a lot of money.

3171
02:56:41,630 --> 02:56:42,950
We actually made a good amount.

3172
02:56:44,110 --> 02:56:44,830
484?

3173
02:56:45,930 --> 02:56:46,650
Okay.

3174
02:56:56,590 --> 02:57:01,330
But still no smelly people to

3175
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:08,720
cause the smellmageddon.

3176
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:11,120
Okay, what we're gonna do is this.

3177
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:15,360
I'm gonna first do it like that.

3178
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:20,960
So there's not so much, you know, everything happening all at once.

3179
02:57:22,640 --> 02:57:24,140
I wish I could move this.

3180
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:33,540
Yeah, so much foot traffic, exactly.

3181
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:39,380
I wish, though, I could get the fountain.

3182
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:40,740
I don't think they like it.

3183
02:57:45,090 --> 02:57:46,690
I don't think they like the fountain.

3184
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:48,610
I don't think they like the fountain.

3185
02:57:49,450 --> 02:57:50,710
Oh, there we go.

3186
02:57:52,090 --> 02:57:54,010
We'll move it just like to be a decoration.

3187
02:57:57,450 --> 02:57:59,250
Oh wait, we were doing this way.

3188
02:57:59,550 --> 02:58:01,130
Here we go.

3189
02:58:05,250 --> 02:58:05,770
Okay.

3190
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:09,470
That should be better.

3191
02:58:10,450 --> 02:58:11,590
This should be sufficient.

3192
02:58:13,070 --> 02:58:14,250
This should be sufficient.

3193
02:58:16,630 --> 02:58:17,790
I don't think it's the fountain.

3194
02:58:18,010 --> 02:58:18,890
You don't think so?

3195
02:58:26,780 --> 02:58:29,260
You don't think they'd be so excited about the fountain?

3196
02:58:30,220 --> 02:58:36,420
Why are puddles a problem out of a water park?

3197
02:58:41,020 --> 02:58:43,880
Alright, we'll see if people now go into this pool.

3198
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:46,860
If we move it around a little bit.

3199
02:58:47,720 --> 02:58:51,040
Because just people were sliding and jumping, but they weren't really swimming.

3200
02:58:57,960 --> 02:58:58,780
You know?

3201
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:02,540
We gotta really get our hot dogs.

3202
02:59:11,420 --> 02:59:12,040
Sorry.

3203
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:15,400
A potential customer.

3204
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:20,800
Alright.

3205
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:29,780
I could get a lemonade stand.

3206
02:59:29,960 --> 02:59:31,480
Do we want another thing to manage?

3207
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:34,640
People will pay more.

3208
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:45,860
Paymore is big Wait, hammer upgrade Construction time reduced Does that also include Repair time?

3209
02:59:52,760 --> 03:00:10,060
Cleanliness management Things stay cleaner for longer Makes puddles easier to spot We could do the tips You know what, we'll do tips because that seems like Passive income, though And then unlocks a stand with inflatable life rings.

3210
03:00:11,540 --> 03:00:12,380
Basic slide.

3211
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:17,040
A jukebox!

3212
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:21,180
My $10 lemonade.

3213
03:00:21,580 --> 03:00:21,920
Hell yeah.

3214
03:00:22,700 --> 03:00:23,640
Would you drink it?

3215
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:30,440
No.

3216
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:35,360
Right now I'm kind of...

3217
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:36,860
Okay, I'm gonna get the ticket price.

3218
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:38,300
That's also more money.

3219
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:45,400
With money, we can do anything that we want.

3220
03:00:46,060 --> 03:00:47,400
That's the reality.

3221
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:50,880
I only have $10.

3222
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:55,300
It used to be a quarter.

3223
03:00:56,260 --> 03:00:57,580
At what park?

3224
03:00:57,960 --> 03:00:59,160
At what theme park?

3225
03:01:06,010 --> 03:01:07,990
We could change out our slide.

3226
03:01:08,790 --> 03:01:10,450
Fun with some gravity involved.

3227
03:01:13,510 --> 03:01:14,610
I'm going to get some slides.

3228
03:01:15,610 --> 03:01:18,310
What we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this ugly thing.

3229
03:01:18,490 --> 03:01:19,090
I hate it.

3230
03:01:19,490 --> 03:01:20,710
One lemonade, please.

3231
03:01:20,790 --> 03:01:22,250
Coming right up.

3232
03:01:22,290 --> 03:01:22,970
Goop, goop, goop.

3233
03:01:24,210 --> 03:01:25,090
Get rid of this thing.

3234
03:01:26,250 --> 03:01:26,450
Wait.

3235
03:01:27,530 --> 03:01:28,850
I gotta get rid of it myself.

3236
03:01:30,090 --> 03:01:30,510
Sledgehammer.

3237
03:01:34,560 --> 03:01:36,280
Even though I just bought it.

3238
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:38,340
I don't care.

3239
03:01:39,560 --> 03:01:40,640
I don't care.

3240
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:41,320
Okay.

3241
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:43,620
Now, what kind of slides we...

3242
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:45,240
See, you guys?

3243
03:01:45,460 --> 03:01:46,120
This is the future.

3244
03:01:46,480 --> 03:01:47,940
This is what the people want.

3245
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:52,380
This is what the people want.

3246
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:54,320
I gotta move out of the way.

3247
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:59,120
Out with the old and with the new, exactly.

3248
03:02:03,340 --> 03:02:04,680
That's so fun.

3249
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:07,840
We got ourselves a swirly slide.

3250
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:10,020
And we're gonna even do another slide over here.

3251
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:12,240
Because we love our customers.

3252
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:18,300
Somehow.

3253
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:26,220
It might be, like, super tough.

3254
03:02:27,180 --> 03:02:27,840
Well, you know what?

3255
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:30,760
Two slides.

3256
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:37,880
They can...

3257
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:39,500
They'll just...

3258
03:02:39,500 --> 03:02:40,960
They'll look out for each other.

3259
03:02:45,260 --> 03:02:46,020
Whoa, yeah, baby.

3260
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:46,620
Oh, yeah.

3261
03:02:47,620 --> 03:02:48,120
Woo!

3262
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:48,740
Woo!

3263
03:02:55,770 --> 03:02:56,390
Fantastic.

3264
03:02:57,770 --> 03:02:57,770
Fantastic.

3265
03:02:59,510 --> 03:03:00,610
What's that, dude?

3266
03:03:05,070 --> 03:03:05,910
Keep forgetting.

3267
03:03:05,930 --> 03:03:06,750
to clean stuff.

3268
03:03:07,690 --> 03:03:08,970
The party pool, baby!

3269
03:03:10,950 --> 03:03:11,810
Oh my gosh.

3270
03:03:13,090 --> 03:03:16,710
My showers are horrible at the moment.

3271
03:03:18,090 --> 03:03:18,970
Wait, but...

3272
03:03:19,450 --> 03:03:21,670
I want to get rid of them, but I don't think I can.

3273
03:03:23,710 --> 03:03:27,190
I won't, I won't, like, make the money back, you know?

3274
03:03:29,890 --> 03:03:31,950
We only get some of the money back.

3275
03:03:34,230 --> 03:03:35,350
What should we do?

3276
03:03:41,960 --> 03:03:43,500
One big change a day.

3277
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:44,700
I think that's reasonable.

3278
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:48,420
I think that's pretty reasonable.

3279
03:03:50,040 --> 03:03:51,280
One big change a day.

3280
03:03:55,620 --> 03:03:57,800
We haven't hired any more staff yet.

3281
03:03:59,940 --> 03:04:00,540
Besides...

3282
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:02,580
Besides...

3283
03:04:02,580 --> 03:04:02,980
Benny.

3284
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:07,000
It's...

3285
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:08,200
It's all me.

3286
03:04:08,380 --> 03:04:08,960
It's all me.

3287
03:04:10,060 --> 03:04:11,520
Alright, I think that's everything.

3288
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:13,680
Oh wait, just kidding.

3289
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:16,940
Cashier staff is goaded.

3290
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:17,980
I agree.

3291
03:04:18,320 --> 03:04:19,580
Not having to sell tickets.

3292
03:04:20,500 --> 03:04:22,980
Takes a load off my shoulders.

3293
03:04:26,500 --> 03:04:30,720
I think once maybe we see how much money we make after the ticket increase.

3294
03:04:32,860 --> 03:04:33,580
And tips.

3295
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:38,660
We might be able to then acquire on second hand.

3296
03:04:40,060 --> 03:04:40,420
You know?

3297
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:43,280
All right, praying for smellies today.

3298
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:44,520
I mean tomorrow.

3299
03:04:46,380 --> 03:04:49,260
Smelly people are welcome at my theme park.

3300
03:04:49,660 --> 03:04:52,220
In fact, smelly people are encouraged at my theme park.

3301
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:55,140
I'll take every smelly person.

3302
03:04:56,580 --> 03:04:58,560
And all are welcome.

3303
03:04:59,480 --> 03:04:59,660
Okay.

3304
03:05:04,360 --> 03:05:05,200
I'm smelly.

3305
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:05,940
I'm smelly.

3306
03:05:06,660 --> 03:05:08,820
Let's get some smellies in here.

3307
03:05:10,060 --> 03:05:12,480
Can we get a smelly counter?

3308
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:13,120
Okay.

3309
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:17,780
We need three smellies.

3310
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:19,480
Hello, hello, hello.

3311
03:05:20,180 --> 03:05:20,900
Oh, you're already coming?

3312
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:21,940
Okay, you're all right.

3313
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:22,840
Oh, whoa.

3314
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:26,720
Wait, wait, wait, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

3315
03:05:26,800 --> 03:05:28,280
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

3316
03:05:28,860 --> 03:05:30,880
Yeah, you, you, you, you, you.

3317
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:32,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3318
03:05:32,620 --> 03:05:33,120
Are you coming?

3319
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:34,120
You.

3320
03:05:34,680 --> 03:05:35,400
All right.

3321
03:05:44,610 --> 03:05:45,670
Get out of my park.

3322
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,240
I like when they have the little evil emoji.

3323
03:05:54,760 --> 03:05:57,300
Stealth attack Smellie!

3324
03:05:57,720 --> 03:05:59,320
Smellie Smellie!

3325
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:01,120
Oh, Estelle!

3326
03:06:01,380 --> 03:06:02,340
I love you!

3327
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:04,380
My stinky girl!

3328
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:07,540
Okay, go Go enjoy the park.

3329
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:12,120
We got a stinker!

3330
03:06:13,140 --> 03:06:14,220
Alright, come on!

3331
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:17,160
Indy, I know you're gonna be wreaking.

3332
03:06:17,400 --> 03:06:18,920
I know you're gonna be disgusting.

3333
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:20,480
Come on, Indy.

3334
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:22,160
Don't disab- Yay!

3335
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:26,880
Okay, oops, sorry, too much.

3336
03:06:32,510 --> 03:06:34,030
Ah, stinky, stinky!

3337
03:06:35,510 --> 03:06:37,250
Thirsty guests equals easy money.

3338
03:06:38,170 --> 03:06:42,250
Sometimes guests get thirsty fast and nothing hits the spot like a good coke cup of lemonade.

3339
03:06:42,970 --> 03:06:46,230
Set up a lemonade stand and turn thirst into profit one sip at a time.

3340
03:06:48,450 --> 03:06:50,630
Oh, the next star, so two and a half.

3341
03:06:50,830 --> 03:06:51,030
Wait.

3342
03:06:52,790 --> 03:06:54,330
We're not to two stars yet?

3343
03:06:56,870 --> 03:06:58,150
We're being forced.

3344
03:06:59,590 --> 03:07:00,670
Are you kidding me right now?

3345
03:07:00,790 --> 03:07:03,650
We're being forced against my will to do lemonade?

3346
03:07:07,880 --> 03:07:08,840
What would it be under?

3347
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:09,580
Utility?

3348
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:10,560
There we are.

3349
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:12,400
Uh.

3350
03:07:13,860 --> 03:07:15,560
Uh, where are the...

3351
03:07:15,560 --> 03:07:16,420
Oh my gosh, wait.

3352
03:07:16,500 --> 03:07:17,600
Oh, I thought I already had people.

3353
03:07:18,140 --> 03:07:19,160
I was about to scream.

3354
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:21,980
I was about to lose it.

3355
03:07:27,400 --> 03:07:29,140
Uh, I don't have anywhere to put it.

3356
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:34,000
Oh.

3357
03:07:34,020 --> 03:07:35,400
Where are you

3358
03:07:41,560 --> 03:07:42,520
at?

3359
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:43,400
Oh, hi Estelle.

3360
03:07:43,860 --> 03:07:44,380
Add ketchup.

3361
03:07:45,860 --> 03:07:47,340
Anything for you, my darling.

3362
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:49,660
Right next to the hot dog?

3363
03:07:50,720 --> 03:07:51,500
I tried.

3364
03:07:52,340 --> 03:07:53,340
Let me try again.

3365
03:07:54,540 --> 03:07:56,140
Maybe we face it like this way?

3366
03:07:56,300 --> 03:07:56,620
No.

3367
03:08:00,550 --> 03:08:03,430
Oh, it has to be a little crooked, but it'll work.

3368
03:08:10,240 --> 03:08:11,020
I think it'll work.

3369
03:08:11,860 --> 03:08:13,220
It's gotta be a little crooked, but that's okay.

3370
03:08:15,700 --> 03:08:16,840
Everyone's enjoying their time.

3371
03:08:16,860 --> 03:08:20,200
Nobody is... This is good so far, actually.

3372
03:08:22,580 --> 03:08:23,160
Stinky!

3373
03:08:23,700 --> 03:08:24,200
Stinky!

3374
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:29,160
We don't need stinky.

3375
03:08:29,320 --> 03:08:30,480
Okay, too many stinkies.

3376
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:32,520
Lemonade add eyes.

3377
03:08:33,660 --> 03:08:33,660
Wait.

3378
03:08:34,820 --> 03:08:35,400
Lemonade?

3379
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:36,160
Wait.

3380
03:08:36,540 --> 03:08:36,700
Lemonade?

3381
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:38,460
Add the... Wait, lemonade?

3382
03:08:39,140 --> 03:08:40,460
How do I do this?

3383
03:08:40,660 --> 03:08:41,560
Restock the lemonade.

3384
03:08:41,720 --> 03:08:42,720
I just got the lemonade.

3385
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:43,220
Okay.

3386
03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:48,760
Rusty lounger is dirty!

3387
03:08:50,380 --> 03:08:50,780
Oh, lemons.

3388
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:53,140
When life gives you lemons.

3389
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,660
Uh-oh, we got thirsty people.

3390
03:09:03,180 --> 03:09:07,200
I want lemonade, add ice, add lemon.

3391
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:09,980
Okay.

3392
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:14,460
Lemonade, add ice, add lemon.

3393
03:09:15,820 --> 03:09:16,220
Uh-huh.

3394
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:16,980
Okay.

3395
03:09:21,030 --> 03:09:22,390
Life bought me lemons.

3396
03:09:23,670 --> 03:09:25,750
Oh, it's been a minute since we've had to wipe up dirt.

3397
03:09:27,490 --> 03:09:29,270
People are actually being a little clean.

3398
03:09:29,470 --> 03:09:30,690
Oh, sorry, Sadie.

3399
03:09:30,990 --> 03:09:32,430
I almost hit you, girl.

3400
03:09:33,590 --> 03:09:34,130
Oh, my gosh.

3401
03:09:34,230 --> 03:09:34,810
We got a stinker.

3402
03:09:36,310 --> 03:09:37,070
Where's my gun?

3403
03:09:37,330 --> 03:09:37,690
Oh, there.

3404
03:09:38,990 --> 03:09:39,870
Oh, sorry, Estelle.

3405
03:09:40,990 --> 03:09:42,430
Oh, I deserve that.

3406
03:09:45,390 --> 03:09:46,350
Don't do it.

3407
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:50,530
People are waiting for lemonade.

3408
03:09:51,030 --> 03:09:51,910
Hello?

3409
03:09:52,410 --> 03:09:52,970
Lemonade?

3410
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:54,630
Add ice?

3411
03:09:54,870 --> 03:09:55,350
Add lemon?

3412
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:57,590

3417
03:10:06,090 --> 03:10:06,730
I saw a stinky.

3418
03:10:08,190 --> 03:10:09,930
I think the stinky is gone.

3419
03:10:15,700 --> 03:10:17,650
Who gets a plain hot dog?

3420
03:10:17,770 --> 03:10:18,650

03:10:19,650 --> 03:10:20,150

I know, but I need more body.

3429
03:11:12,830 --> 03:11:14,090
Oh, oops, I did it again.

Oops, I...

Good enough.

3432
03:11:21,710 --> 03:11:21,890
Oh!

3433
03:11:22,870 --> 03:11:24,470
Oh, somebody's dying!

3434
03:11:25,790 --> 03:11:26,870
Somebody's drowning!

3435
03:11:27,130 --> 03:11:28,090
I don't know where the...

3436
03:11:28,090 --> 03:11:28,450
Uh-oh.

3437
03:11:29,010 --> 03:11:30,910
I don't know where my floaty is.

3438
03:11:31,790 --> 03:11:33,010
I don't know where the floaty is.

3439
03:11:34,690 --> 03:11:36,150
Where's the floaty?

3440
03:11:36,730 --> 03:11:38,050
Where's the floaty?

3441
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:41,350
He's dying and I'm laughing and I'm picking up trash.

3442
03:11:42,650 --> 03:11:43,730
Lane just...

3446
03:11:47,470 --> 03:11:48,610
It's not even that...

3447
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:49,810
Deep.

3448
03:11:49,970 --> 03:11:51,030
Don't worry about it.

3449
03:11:53,360 --> 03:11:54,950
Like a five-year-old.

3450
03:11:57,130 --> 03:11:57,510
injured.

3451
03:11:57,750 --> 03:11:58,790
I received a fine.

3452
03:11:59,090 --> 03:12:00,570
Where's my floaty at?

3453
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:03,810
Guys, I actually don't know where it is.

3454
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:11,920
Yes, waited too long for... If I, like... Oh, okay.

3455
03:12:12,120 --> 03:12:14,220
If I, like, um...

3456
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:16,540
Oh, okay.

3457
03:12:16,640 --> 03:12:17,760
I can just re-grab it here.

3458
03:12:17,980 --> 03:12:18,200
Alright.

3459
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:29,500
I'm trying my best.

3460
03:12:30,360 --> 03:12:31,080
Med kit.

3461
03:12:43,330 --> 03:12:45,050
Jason is waiting for some lemonade.

3462
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:46,650
Hello?

3463
03:12:47,530 --> 03:12:48,010
Lemonade?

3464
03:12:48,030 --> 03:12:50,750
Add ice, add lemon.

3465
03:12:51,330 --> 03:12:51,530
Jojo?

3466
03:12:52,350 --> 03:12:52,610
Hello?

3467
03:12:53,170 --> 03:12:53,730
Add both.

3468
03:12:54,910 --> 03:12:57,350
They never say please, you know.

3469
03:12:59,450 --> 03:13:01,210
Or anything like that.

3470
03:13:10,920 --> 03:13:10,960
Oh!

3471
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:12,800
Oh, where did I put the floaty?

3472
03:13:13,220 --> 03:13:14,680
I lost it again.

3473
03:13:15,560 --> 03:13:16,500
I lost it again!

3474
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:20,180
You're fine!

3475
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:21,740
You'll live this time!

3476
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:22,780
Oh, there's the medic.

3477
03:13:27,160 --> 03:13:28,060
Everything's fine!

3478
03:13:28,260 --> 03:13:30,300
Oh my gosh, a stinky in my pool.

3479
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:33,660
I need more pockets.

3480
03:13:37,770 --> 03:13:38,990
Yeah, you do need a shower.

3481
03:13:40,850 --> 03:13:45,270
Okay, this is actually becoming the real, like, pool experience where it just becomes gross.

3482
03:13:45,990 --> 03:13:51,450
Maybe all water parks are just being, you know, managed by one minto, okay?

3483
03:13:52,490 --> 03:13:52,850
Beat.

3484
03:13:58,820 --> 03:14:00,700
That could just be the case.

3485
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:02,300
Very realistic.

3486
03:14:02,660 --> 03:14:03,120
Exactly.

3487
03:14:03,640 --> 03:14:04,140
Okay.

3488
03:14:07,220 --> 03:14:34,320
lady lady don't do it oh i got it just in time yes waited too long for hot dogs sorry we're close one freaky ghost trying our best guys i'm doing everything i think this game would kind of be nice if you're like just going through the motions of it all you know you're not even like thinking you're just like you're just It's like,

3489
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:35,620
okay, now I go clean this thing.

3490
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:37,260
Okay, now I go repair this thing.

3491
03:14:37,560 --> 03:14:38,940
Okay, now I go serve this person.

3492
03:14:40,020 --> 03:14:40,960
It's my birthday!

3493
03:14:41,220 --> 03:14:41,540
Aerie Blue!

3494
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:42,420
Happy birthday!

3495
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:44,860
One moment.

3496
03:14:46,360 --> 03:14:46,780
Lemon.

3497
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:51,000
Add mustard.

3498
03:14:51,860 --> 03:14:52,220
Yo-yo.

3499
03:14:56,650 --> 03:14:57,730
Is there co-op?

3500
03:14:57,850 --> 03:14:59,990
That's a good question, actually.

3501
03:15:00,430 --> 03:15:02,190
I do not know.

3502
03:15:05,790 --> 03:15:06,470
I feel like...

3503
03:15:06,490 --> 03:15:08,550
I feel like this is the perfect game for multiplayer, no?

3504
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:16,740
Lemonade.

3505
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:18,180
Oh my gosh, and you're gross!

3506
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:26,020
Hello, lemonade?

3507
03:15:28,640 --> 03:15:30,480
At least the lemonade lasts a while.

3508
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:32,700
Oh, hot dog?

3509
03:15:33,900 --> 03:15:34,380
Yes?

3510
03:15:34,740 --> 03:15:35,220
Plane?

3511
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:37,600
Yep.

3512
03:15:41,560 --> 03:15:42,800
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes!

3513
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:43,820
Happy birthday, Harry!

3514
03:15:45,900 --> 03:15:47,480
Sorry, this game is like insane.

3515
03:15:47,500 --> 03:15:48,260
What are you saying here?

3516
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:51,260
Imagine it like overcooked.

3517
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:53,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3518
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:57,160
I do too.

3519
03:16:00,260 --> 03:16:01,740
Wait, wait, wait.

3520
03:16:05,780 --> 03:16:06,160
Alright.

3521
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:08,240
Boy, boy.

3522
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:11,580
Actually, the pools last a lot longer though.

3523
03:16:12,300 --> 03:16:14,120
This water park is full of aliens.

3524
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:17,200
Just saw humans swimming and didn't quite understand.

3525
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:23,680
That's how I feel about any sort of like rag dolly, kind of, you know.

3526
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:28,260
I've repaired 500 attractions.

3527
03:16:29,240 --> 03:16:30,420
Okay, I don't think that's...

3528
03:16:30,420 --> 03:16:32,300
Like, I think that's kind of gross.

3529
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:33,820
I don't think you want to lay on it.

3530
03:16:34,200 --> 03:16:39,960
I think you will definitely get some sort of disease laying on this thing.

3531
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:45,440
Hey!

3532
03:16:45,740 --> 03:16:46,000
Hey!

3533
03:16:46,420 --> 03:16:46,700
Hey!

3534
03:16:47,140 --> 03:16:47,440
Hey!

3535
03:16:47,620 --> 03:16:47,800
Okay.

3536
03:16:48,220 --> 03:16:48,820
Hot dog.

3537
03:16:49,420 --> 03:16:50,280
Yes, ma'am!

3538
03:16:50,800 --> 03:16:51,360
Add ketchup!

3539
03:16:52,360 --> 03:16:53,380
There you go.

3540
03:16:54,240 --> 03:16:54,760
Okay.

3541
03:16:55,460 --> 03:16:56,140
All right.

3542
03:16:56,820 --> 03:17:00,220
Our showers are kind of gross, but what can you do?

3543
03:17:02,800 --> 03:17:03,640
What's the one?

3544
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:05,140
Tetris.

3545
03:17:06,020 --> 03:17:07,840
I think you would get Tetris on our...

3546
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:08,160
Oh, sorry.

3547
03:17:08,400 --> 03:17:09,100
Sorry, Kaysen.

3548
03:17:10,780 --> 03:17:11,340
So sorry.

3549
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:12,940
Please watch out.

3550
03:17:13,060 --> 03:17:14,340
Oh, the day is over!

3551
03:17:15,300 --> 03:17:16,040
Thank God!

3552
03:17:18,900 --> 03:17:22,120
Sorry, I just clicked out of the stats because I wanted to repair these.

3553
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:24,400
Oh.

3554
03:17:25,160 --> 03:17:27,020
We made it, team.

3555
03:17:27,920 --> 03:17:28,860
We made it, team.

3556
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:32,380
Oh, I didn't get the second star because we didn't get two!

3557
03:17:33,960 --> 03:17:35,760
So eight lemonades.

3558
03:17:35,920 --> 03:17:37,300
Oh, I tried.

3559
03:17:38,540 --> 03:17:39,520
I tried.

3560
03:17:40,600 --> 03:17:44,040
And you know, people aren't pooping in the pool anymore, so...

3561
03:17:44,040 --> 03:17:45,080
That's also huge.

3562
03:17:48,820 --> 03:17:49,340
Oh!

3563
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:50,600
Oh!

3564
03:17:51,480 --> 03:17:51,520
Oh!

3565
03:17:57,200 --> 03:18:00,880
Slowly but surely, we're becoming a more civilized society.

3566
03:18:04,470 --> 03:18:06,770
The pool girl at this park is super cute.

3567
03:18:07,370 --> 03:18:09,870
You don't think she's, like, running herself ragged?

3568
03:18:14,110 --> 03:18:14,630
Really?

3569
03:18:15,490 --> 03:18:17,750
I think it might be time to get new bathrooms.

3570
03:18:18,010 --> 03:18:18,830
I'm not gonna lie.

3571
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:33,500
Okay.

3572
03:18:40,430 --> 03:18:44,210
Big stretch after such a long day of work.

3573
03:18:49,410 --> 03:18:52,590
Gosh, got...

3574
03:18:52,590 --> 03:18:53,290
Hey buddy.

3575
03:18:54,470 --> 03:18:54,990
Pool's closed.

3576
03:18:58,570 --> 03:19:00,030
Pool's closed, buddy.

3577
03:19:01,730 --> 03:19:03,010
Pool's closed!

3578
03:19:03,570 --> 03:19:04,470
Pool's closed!

3579
03:19:05,050 --> 03:19:05,710
Pool's closed!

3580
03:19:06,590 --> 03:19:07,850
Pool's closed!

3581
03:19:14,100 --> 03:19:15,800
This is what happens after hours.

3582
03:19:16,260 --> 03:19:20,480
You know, when you were a kid and you ever wanted to stay longer at a store, like hide.

3583
03:19:21,860 --> 03:19:24,520
Like at a theme park or wherever.

3584
03:19:25,380 --> 03:19:26,860
This is what would happen to you.

3585
03:19:31,960 --> 03:19:33,600
So don't trespass.

3586
03:19:36,660 --> 03:19:38,000
Go away, Ray.

3587
03:19:39,280 --> 03:19:41,320
Oh, I almost missed this puddle.

3588
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:41,820
How?

3589
03:19:42,800 --> 03:19:43,960
A free massage.

3590
03:19:52,280 --> 03:19:54,200
Okay, I think we should...

3591
03:19:54,200 --> 03:19:55,840
I think it's time to get a new look.

3592
03:19:58,660 --> 03:19:59,960
You know what?

3593
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:01,200
Yeah.

3594
03:20:03,500 --> 03:20:04,960
I think we cleaned everything.

3595
03:20:05,740 --> 03:20:09,880
Let's restock our lemons and our hot dogs and we'll be good to go.

3596
03:20:15,900 --> 03:20:17,100
How much money?

3597
03:20:17,320 --> 03:20:18,100
Okay, 900.

3598
03:20:19,320 --> 03:20:20,500
I don't know, you guys.

3599
03:20:20,580 --> 03:20:21,280
What do you think?

3600
03:20:23,280 --> 03:20:26,280
You think it's enough to hire a person?

3601
03:20:30,400 --> 03:20:32,840
Milos, welcome to Mambusha Banco!

3602
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:36,400
Yeah?

3603
03:20:37,400 --> 03:20:37,840
Okay.

3604
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:40,900
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hire someone tomorrow.

3605
03:20:42,120 --> 03:20:44,280
But I'm also going to upgrade our toilets.

3606
03:20:45,100 --> 03:20:45,640
I think...

3607
03:20:45,640 --> 03:20:47,320
I don't know actually if we got...

3608
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:47,980
Oh, basic toilets.

3609
03:20:48,120 --> 03:20:48,320
Here we go.

3610
03:20:50,220 --> 03:20:51,520
And I'm going to do the make sure...

3611
03:20:51,540 --> 03:20:54,960
things longer, clean the air for longer.

3612
03:20:56,180 --> 03:20:56,340
Okay.

3613
03:20:57,900 --> 03:20:59,500
So then we destroy this.

3614
03:21:00,480 --> 03:21:00,560
Haia!

3615
03:21:00,940 --> 03:21:01,240
Haia!

3616
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:01,920
Haia!

3617
03:21:04,260 --> 03:21:04,800
And this.

3618
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:05,300
Haia!

3619
03:21:05,740 --> 03:21:05,920
Haia!

3620
03:21:06,300 --> 03:21:06,640
Haia!

3621
03:21:06,780 --> 03:21:06,780
Haia!

3622
03:21:07,060 --> 03:21:07,500
Haia!

3623
03:21:07,880 --> 03:21:12,100
Because I've noticed people are going into the bathrooms and coming out stinky.

3624
03:21:12,680 --> 03:21:14,520
And coming out gross and nasty.

3625
03:21:15,360 --> 03:21:18,540
So if we can prevent that, I think it would be good.

3626
03:21:22,810 --> 03:21:27,050
I'm at work, but I feel like you're working hard in this I am.

3627
03:21:30,250 --> 03:21:30,750
Nice.

3628
03:21:31,750 --> 03:21:33,030
Okay, let's go to sleep.

3629
03:21:34,890 --> 03:21:35,770
Good night, Braylon.

3630
03:21:40,250 --> 03:21:41,430
Minto people are just gross.

3631
03:21:41,670 --> 03:21:42,110
I agree.

3632
03:21:43,370 --> 03:21:44,290
Trust me, I agree.

3633
03:21:45,570 --> 03:21:47,970
Our park is coming up great, I think.

3634
03:21:48,750 --> 03:21:53,410
Okay, I think I fixed it and cleaned everything, so let's start the day, baby.

3635
03:21:58,820 --> 03:22:01,500
Sad thing is $40 lemons doesn't seem that crazy.

3636
03:22:01,520 --> 03:22:02,900
in today's economy.

3637
03:22:07,840 --> 03:22:10,400
I really don't need the sledgehammer, do I?

3638
03:22:11,740 --> 03:22:12,980
But it's fine.

3639
03:22:20,540 --> 03:22:25,240
We're in a tent because, you know, our livelihood went to the park.

3640
03:22:26,120 --> 03:22:27,340
We don't need...

3641
03:22:27,340 --> 03:22:28,520
We're not...

3642
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:29,940
I have a hammer.

3643
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:32,860
Just because I got rid of...

3644
03:22:32,860 --> 03:22:35,760
My sledgehammer doesn't mean I don't have a hammer.

3645
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:37,580
for you, Georgina.

3646
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:45,720
I had to be careful.

3647
03:22:46,120 --> 03:22:47,280
I regret everything!

3648
03:22:49,400 --> 03:22:50,640
Murder is okay.

3649
03:22:50,860 --> 03:22:52,340
They're breaking, they're trespassing.

3650
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:55,420
Yeah, you had a human shield.

3651
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:56,440
What a tricky guy.

3652
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:57,940
Ooh, okay, girl.

3653
03:22:58,920 --> 03:22:59,960
Okay, Nova.

3654
03:23:00,340 --> 03:23:01,420
With the tricks.

3655
03:23:02,200 --> 03:23:02,480
Yes.

3656
03:23:02,800 --> 03:23:03,500
Yes, you want lemonade?

3657
03:23:03,820 --> 03:23:04,040
Yeah, yeah.

3658
03:23:04,820 --> 03:23:06,000
Lemonade at ice.

3659
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:08,880
Yeah.

3660
03:23:10,840 --> 03:23:12,300
Okay, just one more.

3661
03:23:13,120 --> 03:23:13,320

3676
03:23:55,070 --> 03:23:57,010

You're okay.

3697
03:25:28,890 --> 03:25:31,190
I've spent a whole lot of money?

3698
03:25:31,890 --> 03:25:32,330
Whoa!

3699
03:25:38,840 --> 03:25:39,280
Um...

3700
03:25:39,720 --> 03:25:40,160
Whoa!

3701
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:47,160
Oh my gosh!

03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:51,180

Oh, hello.

3707
03:26:08,780 --> 03:26:09,160
Sorry.

3708
03:26:09,420 --> 03:26:09,840
What do you want?

3709
03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:13,600
Hello?

3710
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:15,600

03:26:26,940 --> 03:26:27,660
Oh, that's right.

03:26:27,740 --> 03:26:29,240

3719
03:26:32,940 --> 03:26:33,940

3720
03:26:34,420 --> 03:26:34,720
Hire.

3721
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:35,440
Get in here.

3722
03:26:35,600 --> 03:26:36,860
I've reached my staff limit.

3723
03:26:37,060 --> 03:26:37,160
Okay.

3724
03:26:39,440 --> 03:26:40,540

03:26:42,220 --> 03:26:43,460
Wait, can I only have one person?

3726
03:26:46,380 --> 03:26:48,000
I can only have one person.

3727
03:26:49,620 --> 03:26:50,080
Okay, oh.

3728
03:26:50,820 --> 03:26:54,780

3729
03:26:56,500 --> 03:26:56,940
Please!

3730
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:00,380
Not good, not good!

3731
03:27:05,730 --> 03:27:08,150
Wait, why can I only have one staff member?

3732
03:27:11,070 --> 03:27:12,050
Are you kidding me?

3733
03:27:12,150 --> 03:27:12,610
now?

3734
03:27:14,510 --> 03:27:15,270
Lemonade, add lemon.

3735
03:27:17,750 --> 03:27:18,270
No, gel.

3736
03:27:21,580 --> 03:27:23,320
Lemonade, lemon, ice.

3737
03:27:26,160 --> 03:27:27,360
Add both.

3738
03:27:31,500 --> 03:27:33,100
Lemon ice.

3739
03:27:36,120 --> 03:27:36,920
Ketchup.

3740
03:27:38,260 --> 03:27:39,020
Doesn't make me hungry.

3741
03:27:39,620 --> 03:27:40,380
Not gonna lie.

3742
03:27:41,420 --> 03:27:42,300
My leg!

3743
03:27:43,860 --> 03:27:46,040
They get upset when they like slip.

3744
03:27:46,680 --> 03:27:47,380
They're like, I don't, you know what?

3745
03:27:47,480 --> 03:27:49,820
I don't want the lemonade anymore.

3746
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:51,760
They're like little babies.

3747
03:27:53,720 --> 03:27:54,440
Add mustard.

3748
03:27:59,800 --> 03:28:00,160
Plane.

3749
03:28:02,460 --> 03:28:03,040
No bin inside.

3750
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:03,460
No, no, no.

3751
03:28:03,620 --> 03:28:03,880
There is a bin.

3752
03:28:03,980 --> 03:28:04,320
There is a bin.

3753
03:28:04,480 --> 03:28:04,820
There is a bin.

3754
03:28:09,880 --> 03:28:10,880
I promise you.

3755
03:28:12,040 --> 03:28:14,500
People have been littering less, though.

3756
03:28:18,850 --> 03:28:20,090
Someone's waiting for a hot dog.

3757
03:28:20,570 --> 03:28:21,010
Hold on.

3758
03:28:21,370 --> 03:28:22,750
I gotta mop these puddles, baby.

3759
03:28:23,330 --> 03:28:24,150
I gotta do it.

3760
03:28:24,490 --> 03:28:25,510
I gotta be swift.

3761
03:28:26,130 --> 03:28:26,130
Oh.

3762
03:28:26,870 --> 03:28:28,010
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3763
03:28:28,410 --> 03:28:28,910
Oh, oh.

3764
03:28:30,030 --> 03:28:30,850
Oh, sorry.

3765
03:28:31,490 --> 03:28:33,810
Oh, I don't think they ordered that service.

3766
03:28:34,790 --> 03:28:35,110
Mustard.

3767
03:28:37,730 --> 03:28:38,130
Add lemon.

3768
03:28:42,130 --> 03:28:42,730
Special.

3769
03:28:43,190 --> 03:28:44,650
That's for after hours.

3770
03:28:51,470 --> 03:28:52,930
I'm so sorry!

3771
03:28:53,770 --> 03:28:54,610
I'm so sorry!

3772
03:28:55,490 --> 03:28:56,830
Please forgive me!

3773
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:03,330
Whoa, that was a close one.

3774
03:29:03,670 --> 03:29:04,310
Oh, oh, please.

3775
03:29:04,570 --> 03:29:04,830
Everybody?

3776
03:29:05,850 --> 03:29:06,930
Nope, don't walk here.

3777
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:17,720
I can do that.

3778
03:29:18,660 --> 03:29:18,860
Uh-huh.

3779
03:29:19,320 --> 03:29:19,800
Uh-huh.

3780
03:29:20,320 --> 03:29:21,580
Prepare low jumper.

3781
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:22,860
Lemon.

3782
03:29:23,860 --> 03:29:24,220
Lemon.

3783
03:29:25,060 --> 03:29:25,460
Ice.

3784
03:29:27,960 --> 03:29:28,720
Low jumper.

3785
03:29:30,660 --> 03:29:31,660
Oh, this one.

3786
03:29:36,960 --> 03:29:43,220
Are we... Are we... Are we... Are we feeling... Are we feeling good, team?

3787
03:29:43,880 --> 03:29:44,800
How are we feeling?

3788
03:29:46,300 --> 03:29:47,320
That was close.

3789
03:29:47,620 --> 03:29:48,800
I almost just whacked that man.

3790
03:29:49,880 --> 03:29:51,120
I almost just took him out.

3791
03:29:54,830 --> 03:29:55,750
New research point.

3792
03:29:55,890 --> 03:29:56,250
Let's go.

3793
03:30:00,990 --> 03:30:02,810
I'm feeling it, Mr. Crabs.

3794
03:30:03,770 --> 03:30:05,590
I'm feeling it, Mr. Crabs.

3795
03:30:11,190 --> 03:30:11,570
Woo!

3796
03:30:11,790 --> 03:30:12,750
That was close.

3797
03:30:15,310 --> 03:30:16,890
Nova's waiting on a hot dog.

3798
03:30:17,670 --> 03:30:19,130
Nova, you've been here all day, girl.

3799
03:30:19,510 --> 03:30:20,090
We'll home.

3800
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:25,480
Okay.

3801
03:30:30,570 --> 03:30:32,130
Are these organic lemons?

3802
03:30:32,490 --> 03:30:33,330
Make it stop!

3803
03:30:33,470 --> 03:30:34,510
I was trying!

3804
03:30:35,770 --> 03:30:36,050
Oops.

3805
03:30:37,470 --> 03:30:40,310
I don't even recognize my own character now that we've changed.

3806
03:30:42,550 --> 03:30:43,770
Uh-oh, somebody's drowning?

3807
03:30:45,350 --> 03:30:47,190
Um... Floody is right there, girl.

3808
03:30:48,630 --> 03:30:50,270
You definitely could have done that yourself.

3809
03:30:52,970 --> 03:30:53,530
Okay.

3810
03:30:54,450 --> 03:30:55,330
Oh, hot dogs.

3811
03:30:56,110 --> 03:30:56,330

03:34:36,160 --> 03:34:37,600
We did it.

3844
03:34:38,740 --> 03:34:40,060
We did it somehow.

3845
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:45,480
Time to check out the new space.

3846
03:34:45,760 --> 03:34:47,040
I know it.

3847
03:34:47,460 --> 03:34:48,780
Oh, my goodness.

3848
03:34:48,780 --> 03:34:51,060
This is awesome.

3849
03:34:57,250 --> 03:34:58,670
Let's repair everything.

3850
03:34:59,590 --> 03:35:01,990
I might just get rid of the ugly...

3851
03:35:01,990 --> 03:35:03,390
I think we have better...

3852
03:35:03,390 --> 03:35:05,230
What's it called now that we can get?

3853
03:35:05,630 --> 03:35:08,670
Loungeers, so I'll probably get rid of all of these.

3854
03:35:13,800 --> 03:35:16,340
No way one hired hand is the game's final limit.

3855
03:35:16,420 --> 03:35:17,180
I don't know.

3856
03:35:17,740 --> 03:35:19,420
I didn't look in the...

3857
03:35:19,420 --> 03:35:20,200
There's gotta be...

3858
03:35:20,200 --> 03:35:22,060
Oh wait, okay, here's the basic loungers.

3859
03:35:22,140 --> 03:35:22,520
Okay, good.

3860
03:35:23,860 --> 03:35:53,080

3861
03:35:54,100 --> 03:35:54,780
Hello.

3862
03:35:56,800 --> 03:35:59,320
I hate these.

3863
03:36:00,220 --> 03:36:01,680
I'm so happy to destroy them.

3864
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:03,400
Yes.

3865
03:36:03,980 --> 03:36:04,840
Get rid of them.

3866
03:36:05,820 --> 03:36:06,660
Get rid of them.

3867
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:10,400
Yeah, we're gonna do it right now.

3868
03:36:14,680 --> 03:36:16,780
I almost broke this instead.

3869
03:36:18,560 --> 03:36:20,620
Let's clean everything up as well.

3870
03:36:21,720 --> 03:36:23,440
Yeah, they look so bad.

3871
03:36:23,460 --> 03:36:26,180
and our park is looking so nice now.

3872
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:28,120
I don't want to...

3873
03:36:28,120 --> 03:36:32,680
I don't want to have OD land be really great.

3874
03:36:47,430 --> 03:36:49,390
This is mop poop.

3875
03:36:50,270 --> 03:36:51,810
I think this is graffiti?

3876
03:36:53,030 --> 03:36:53,470
Poop?

3877
03:36:54,850 --> 03:36:55,530
Whoa.

3878
03:36:56,310 --> 03:36:57,430
I don't think that's...

3879
03:37:06,420 --> 03:37:07,780
Demolition daydream.

3880
03:37:09,020 --> 03:37:10,960
I went to Minto Park and all I got was 10.

3881
03:37:10,980 --> 03:37:12,420
This Rona and HEP-E.

3882
03:37:12,900 --> 03:37:15,620
So a park employee tripped me over and then landed on me.

3883
03:37:16,080 --> 03:37:18,060
That was a special service.

3884
03:37:18,180 --> 03:37:19,480
Don't act like you hated it.

3885
03:37:25,490 --> 03:37:26,910
Don't act like that, babe.

3886
03:37:27,050 --> 03:37:27,930
Come on, girl.

3887
03:37:28,890 --> 03:37:29,890
Come on, sweetie.

3888
03:37:30,750 --> 03:37:31,890
Don't act like that, babe.

3889
03:37:32,410 --> 03:37:32,830
Come on.

3890
03:37:37,530 --> 03:37:39,410
I'm being a toxic boyfriend.

3891
03:37:45,490 --> 03:37:46,450
Being toxic.

3892
03:37:53,050 --> 03:37:55,830
Wow, this area is crazy.

3893
03:37:57,510 --> 03:37:59,070
Oh, we were once this young.

3894
03:38:04,410 --> 03:38:06,150
Who taught you to be like this?

3895
03:38:06,950 --> 03:38:07,410
TV.

3896
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:13,630
I watched Degrassi one time.

3897
03:38:16,630 --> 03:38:17,850
Actually, only...

3898
03:38:17,850 --> 03:38:19,450
I never really watched Degrassi.

3899
03:38:20,810 --> 03:38:24,110
There was one point, though, I really got into Gilmore Girl.

3900
03:38:25,250 --> 03:38:54,430
I binged that when I lived in Japan I binged a gossip girl and Gilmore girls oh and then I also I really like I was really into pretty little liars one time I was flying on the plane and they had a couple episodes and I was like whoa wait this is kind of mysterious and spooky and then I watched the rest of the show and I was like always kind of cringe but did I watch the whole thing yeah I did.

3901
03:38:55,370 --> 03:38:57,350
I watched the whole thing.

3902
03:38:58,170 --> 03:38:59,130
PLLO Lordy.

3903
03:38:59,530 --> 03:39:01,310
If you know, you know.

3904
03:39:04,810 --> 03:39:17,230
But it's funny because the Pretty Little Liars um uh audiobook is voiced by a really like popular English voice actress.

3905
03:39:17,590 --> 03:39:19,270
I can't remember her name right now.

3906
03:39:19,830 --> 03:39:23,170
But I once met her and I was like, oh my gosh, Pretty Little Liars!

3907
03:39:23,330 --> 03:39:24,950
And she was like, What the hell?

3908
03:39:27,010 --> 03:39:31,090
I heard that the new no tax on tips policy includes donations to streamers.

3909
03:39:33,390 --> 03:39:33,930
Oh, does it?

3910
03:39:41,410 --> 03:39:42,410
Thank you.

3911
03:39:43,950 --> 03:39:47,090
I think Doki Bird wrote her dissertation on that show.

3912
03:39:47,490 --> 03:39:48,250
Pretty Little Liars?

3913
03:39:49,810 --> 03:39:51,170
It's literally...

3914
03:39:51,170 --> 03:39:52,990
It's exactly what FNAF did.

3915
03:39:53,890 --> 03:39:57,870
Where people guessed what was going on and they would like...

3916
03:39:57,870 --> 03:39:58,670
Be like...

3917
03:39:59,890 --> 03:40:21,890
actually you think you know what's going on but you actually don't know what's going on even though people guessed correctly and so the show became like an absolute an absolute mess because the team was just so like upset that people were guessing what was actually happening oh

3918
03:40:25,850 --> 03:41:32,210
riverdale did the same thing yeah i went completely off the rails people would be like oh we think so basically liars is about a group of girls and one summer they they get together and one of the girls Allison de Laurentes she goes missing in the middle of the night and she goes missing and the girls are like oh my gosh our friend but she's kind of like not a nice girl so they're a little relieved you know and then they're at her funeral because they're like alison's never coming back when when they're at their funeral and they all get a text from this person named a who's just like i know what you did last summer i know you killed me or whatever you know and so the story the the mystery is just like oh my gosh is a alison Is A someone else?

3919
03:41:33,910 --> 03:41:34,710
Is A...

3920
03:41:34,710 --> 03:41:39,390
Like, and if A is someone else, how do they know...

3921
03:41:39,390 --> 03:41:41,370
What the girlies did, you know?

3922
03:41:41,810 --> 03:41:43,410
It's so stupid and I love it.

3923
03:41:43,730 --> 03:41:44,130
It's...

3924
03:41:44,130 --> 03:41:46,370
And, you know, I'm like a sucker for...

3925
03:41:46,370 --> 03:41:47,110
I was like, you know what?

3926
03:41:47,130 --> 03:41:48,230
It's a little teen drama.

3927
03:41:48,370 --> 03:41:48,790
I don't care.

3928
03:41:49,090 --> 03:41:50,330
I'm a sucker for a mystery.

3929
03:41:51,550 --> 03:41:53,330
But it just went craziness.

3930
03:41:54,590 --> 03:41:55,530
Cassandra Lee Morris!

3931
03:41:55,790 --> 03:41:56,830
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3932
03:41:56,950 --> 03:41:57,550
Thank you, thank you.

3933
03:41:57,550 --> 03:41:59,690
I was like, I thought it was her, but I could not remember.

3934
03:42:04,130 --> 03:42:13,330
why are they friends with her if they hate her I don't know sometimes teenage girls are weird they're weird

3935
03:42:19,540 --> 03:42:37,180
but yeah and so like and then shenanigans ensue and then the girls like almost die and there's like a student teacher relationship I was like this is for Teenagers?

3936
03:42:39,400 --> 03:42:40,660
This is for...

3937
03:42:40,660 --> 03:42:41,660
This is for kids?

3938
03:42:42,440 --> 03:42:46,120
I was like, whoa!

3939
03:42:46,780 --> 03:42:47,860
Teenage girls are weird.

3940
03:42:48,240 --> 03:42:49,580
Source me, a teenage girl.

3941
03:42:49,960 --> 03:42:50,260
Yeah!

3942
03:42:51,040 --> 03:42:53,280
Well, it's really high school girls.

3943
03:42:56,540 --> 03:42:57,780
Yo, Blue Archive?

3944
03:42:59,520 --> 03:43:00,080
Yeah.

3945
03:43:05,580 --> 03:43:09,340
Like one of the girls, she goes to like a bar and then hooks up with the girls.

3946
03:43:09,360 --> 03:44:01,880
guy and then the guy ends up being her teacher and you're like uh oh spaghetti oh okay we're getting the lounges that's right so yeah i like i watched i was like when i watched the show it was like i don't remember what season it was but it was like in the middle of the season probably season one I think it was it was like in the middle of the season I was like I had no idea what was going on but I was like oh my gosh a mystery and I was flying back from Japan and so then I um got home and I was so jet lagged that I just watched pretty much the whole show while I recovered from jet lag I was like I was like yeah baby

3947
03:44:05,400 --> 03:44:06,360
trash cans!

3948
03:44:06,500 --> 03:44:06,900
Yippee!

3949
03:44:07,580 --> 03:44:07,820
Okay.

3950
03:44:09,200 --> 03:44:13,020
We're gonna make more use of this extra space we got going on, baby.

3951
03:44:17,160 --> 03:44:19,160
Nobody will be littering on our watch.

3952
03:44:19,360 --> 03:44:20,880
We'll put one even right here.

3953
03:44:23,900 --> 03:44:25,460
Have you seen Shameless?

3954
03:44:26,340 --> 03:44:27,980
I haven't even heard of that.

3955
03:44:32,540 --> 03:44:35,240
When I was a teenager, I was watching Bleach and Deathmelt.

3956
03:44:35,780 --> 03:44:37,740
I think the kids are still watching that, no?

3957
03:44:38,000 --> 03:44:39,240
I don't know, actually.

3958
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:41,840
No, they're watching, like, My Hero and...

3959
03:44:43,920 --> 03:44:48,060
But, I mean, they're watching things that are of similar substance, probably.

3960
03:44:49,620 --> 03:44:50,220
You know?

3961
03:44:59,160 --> 03:45:00,040
Trashy TV.

3962
03:45:01,600 --> 03:45:02,920
Yeah, they're watching JJK!

3963
03:45:03,160 --> 03:45:06,020
Oh, yeah, they're watching Jujutsukaisen, Demon Slayer.

3964
03:45:10,180 --> 03:45:13,840
Okay, so we need five lounges.

3965
03:45:15,340 --> 03:45:17,000
I'm gonna put all of them over here.

3966
03:45:17,660 --> 03:45:20,800
If people are tired, they gotta work for it.

3967
03:45:22,960 --> 03:45:24,340
Five, right next to the dumpster.

3968
03:45:26,740 --> 03:45:28,700
Smelly, smelly, smelly.

3969
03:45:36,120 --> 03:45:36,960
Oh yeah.

3970
03:45:37,580 --> 03:45:38,920
I don't like trash TV.

3971
03:45:40,360 --> 03:45:43,180
Though, I have watched my fair share of things.

3972
03:45:45,260 --> 03:45:46,460
Like, uh...

3973
03:45:46,460 --> 03:45:51,380
I have a friend, she's super into those shows, like, Love Island or whatever.

3974
03:45:53,100 --> 03:45:54,720
I don't watch any of that.

3975
03:45:54,900 --> 03:46:01,900
But I did, my roommate, she and I would watch a 90-day fiancé together.

3976
03:46:04,540 --> 03:46:06,260
I don't watch it anymore.

3977
03:46:08,620 --> 03:46:09,980
Okay, but what about Riverdale?

3978
03:46:10,400 --> 03:46:14,220
I kind of want to watch Riverdale only because I hear it gets so stupid.

3979
03:46:14,780 --> 03:46:15,840
And I want to know what happens.

3980
03:46:16,040 --> 03:46:21,440
I think Doki, like, watched the first episode and then the latest episode or last episode or something.

3981
03:46:22,940 --> 03:46:23,600
Terrace house?

3982
03:46:23,720 --> 03:46:24,320
Oh my god, my friend!

3983
03:46:24,540 --> 03:46:26,040
She loves Terrace house!

3984
03:46:26,420 --> 03:46:27,920
She loves, she loves.

3985
03:46:31,420 --> 03:46:32,960
And then what are the other ones?

3986
03:46:33,280 --> 03:46:35,520
Like, uh...

3987
03:46:36,440 --> 03:46:36,880
Um...

3988
03:46:36,880 --> 03:46:38,080
Blind love?

3989
03:46:39,260 --> 03:46:41,320
The one where there are people in the pods.

3990
03:46:41,420 --> 03:46:43,100
My friend tells me all about it.

3991
03:46:46,080 --> 03:46:48,300
Terrace house is the only one I actually watched.

3992
03:46:50,140 --> 03:46:51,740
Is it like...

3993
03:46:53,220 --> 03:46:56,220
I thought Terrace House was not as bad.

3994
03:46:56,860 --> 03:46:59,560
Or is it maybe the Terrace House that's like...

3995
03:46:59,560 --> 03:47:00,180
I don't know.

3996
03:47:00,440 --> 03:47:01,880
I actually have no idea.

3997
03:47:04,240 --> 03:47:05,260
I don't know anything.

3998
03:47:05,880 --> 03:47:08,520
You've taken your first steps towards becoming a legendary park manager.

3999
03:47:08,700 --> 03:47:10,000
Keep building and improving your park.

4000
03:47:10,300 --> 03:47:13,140
Your next star is waiting for you right after the next task!

4001
03:47:13,460 --> 03:47:14,080
Which is...

4002
03:47:15,540 --> 03:47:16,060

Oh my gosh.

03:47:59,360 --> 03:48:00,140
Palm tree!

4009
03:48:00,680 --> 03:48:01,740
It's so small!

4010
03:48:02,860 --> 03:48:03,200
Okay.

4011
03:48:05,300 --> 03:48:06,260
Decorating?

4012
03:48:07,320 --> 03:48:08,060
Ambience?

4013
03:48:09,060 --> 03:48:09,800
Oh, benches!

4014
03:48:10,080 --> 03:48:10,960
Okay, benches.

4015
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:12,240
Huge.

4016
03:48:13,300 --> 03:48:13,540
Ugh.

4017
03:48:16,800 --> 03:48:17,620
You...

4018
03:48:17,620 --> 03:48:18,560
You...

4019
03:48:19,720 --> 03:48:21,500
Wait, here, too?

4020
03:48:21,860 --> 03:48:22,340
Like so.

4021
03:48:22,760 --> 03:48:23,160
Cute.

4022
03:48:23,760 --> 03:48:24,500
Practical.

4023
03:48:25,080 --> 03:48:25,560
Okay.

4024
03:48:29,880 --> 03:48:31,120
We're already at 50?

4025
03:48:32,500 --> 03:48:32,980
58.

4026
03:48:39,740 --> 03:48:40,960
I think we got this.

4027
03:48:41,140 --> 03:48:42,080
I think we got this, boys.

4028
03:48:44,240 --> 03:48:44,780
Time to paint.

4029
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:45,760
Yeah, we gotta paint.

4030
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:48,600
I think umbrellas are our key to victory.

4031
03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:53,460
Umbrellas are the key to victory.

4032
03:48:55,380 --> 03:48:55,840
Oh.

4033
03:48:56,580 --> 03:48:57,060
Oh.

4034
03:49:03,500 --> 03:49:04,560
Okay, nice.

4035
03:49:11,960 --> 03:49:12,800
Does this add...

4036
03:49:12,800 --> 03:49:13,100
Oh, wait.

4037
03:49:13,180 --> 03:49:16,720
I just realized I blocked our decoration there.

4038
03:49:17,100 --> 03:49:18,060
I'll get it.

4039
03:49:20,880 --> 03:49:21,700
Um, oh my gosh.

4040
03:49:21,860 --> 03:49:22,580
We're so close.

4041
03:49:22,760 --> 03:49:22,940
Okay.

4042
03:49:25,520 --> 03:49:26,700
We're so, so close.

4043
03:49:30,060 --> 03:49:30,620
Um.

4044
03:49:31,180 --> 03:49:35,440
We'll block the dumpster with a plant or something.

4045
03:49:35,580 --> 03:49:36,120
I don't know.

4046
03:49:37,200 --> 03:49:37,640
Uh.

4047
03:49:37,660 --> 03:49:52,220
these are pretty big how big how much are they oh they're only ten dollars some privacy here hold on wait we're gonna make like a really sexy area and

4048
03:50:01,940 --> 03:50:16,520
then oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah the woohoo bush oh i forgot to make another uh pool i think i have enough money

4049
03:50:20,590 --> 03:50:21,630
We can now make a big pool.

4050
03:50:27,880 --> 03:50:33,580
People might see you in the woohoo bush, but...

4051
03:50:34,300 --> 03:50:34,780
Yeah.

4052
03:50:38,060 --> 03:50:38,540
Yeah.

4053
03:50:39,420 --> 03:50:40,240
Don't worry about it.

4054
03:50:40,520 --> 03:50:40,520
Okay.

4055
03:50:41,540 --> 03:50:42,340
This should be enough.

4056
03:50:42,920 --> 03:50:43,280
Surely.

4057
03:50:44,620 --> 03:50:45,120
Oh no.

4058
03:50:45,360 --> 03:50:45,780
Never mind.

4059
03:50:47,300 --> 03:50:48,580
Okay, it didn't give us anything.

4060
03:50:51,500 --> 03:50:53,520
I think we're gonna have to...

4061
03:50:54,260 --> 03:50:57,200
Build as the park is open.

4062
03:51:02,930 --> 03:51:06,490
But we need another pool so we can increase our max capacity.

4063
03:51:09,330 --> 03:51:10,070
What else can I make?

4064
03:51:10,730 --> 03:51:11,750
More, more...

4065
03:51:11,750 --> 03:51:12,810
What am I talking about?

4066
03:51:13,910 --> 03:51:15,670
More umbrellas, more umbrellas.

4067
03:51:17,170 --> 03:51:18,070
While you're waiting.

4068
03:51:18,910 --> 03:51:20,650
While you're waiting in the shade.

4069
03:51:20,950 --> 03:51:21,710
While you're...

4070
03:51:21,710 --> 03:51:22,410
While you're shading.

4071
03:51:22,950 --> 03:51:23,650
While you're waiting.

4072
03:51:24,510 --> 03:51:25,690
Here and here.

4073
03:51:27,910 --> 03:51:29,170
Do I have any more money?

4074
03:51:29,310 --> 03:51:31,630
Oh gosh, I have enough money for one more umbrella.

4075
03:51:32,390 --> 03:51:32,830
Wait?

4076
03:51:33,570 --> 03:51:33,850
Wait!

4077
03:51:35,070 --> 03:51:35,510
You guys?

4078
03:51:36,170 --> 03:51:37,590
One more umbrella might do the trick.

4079
03:51:38,570 --> 03:51:38,810
Okay.

4080
03:51:50,380 --> 03:51:52,420
Oh my gosh.

4081
03:51:53,320 --> 03:51:55,220
I don't have enough money to buy anything.

4082
03:52:02,220 --> 03:52:02,700
Janitors!

4083
03:52:02,900 --> 03:52:03,100
Ah!

4084
03:52:05,260 --> 03:52:07,060
Wait, but that means...

4085
03:52:07,060 --> 03:52:07,780
Hiring!

4086
03:52:08,220 --> 03:52:09,520
I can hire one more person!

4087
03:52:10,640 --> 03:52:10,940
Oh!

4088
03:52:11,140 --> 03:52:11,800

4089
03:52:12,280 --> 03:52:12,580

Okay.

4092
03:52:16,360 --> 03:52:17,420
I can hire a janitor.

4093
03:52:18,380 --> 03:52:19,120
We can do this.

4094
03:52:19,880 --> 03:52:21,560
We can do this!

4095
03:52:22,580 --> 03:52:24,260
I have to sleep though.

4096
03:52:26,680 --> 03:52:29,660
Our ducky is becoming cleaner!

4097
03:52:31,000 --> 03:52:32,020
Wait, that's exciting!

4098
03:52:34,200 --> 03:52:35,280
Look at our place!

4099
03:52:35,500 --> 03:52:36,320
It's pretty cute!

4100
03:52:36,440 --> 03:52:36,720
No!

4101
03:52:47,510 --> 03:52:47,950
Oh.

4102
03:52:53,180 --> 03:52:54,420
Oh, sorry, Braylon.

4103
03:52:54,680 --> 03:52:55,080
Good morning.

4104
03:52:56,060 --> 03:52:57,580
I'm gonna go get some people in here.

4105
03:53:04,380 --> 03:53:05,020

4107
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:09,720
Oh, we're coming in masses.

4108
03:53:10,760 --> 03:53:11,620

4109
03:53:12,040 --> 03:53:12,140

4110
03:53:12,580 --> 03:53:14,080

03:53:14,660 --> 03:53:15,100
Oh, sorry.

Yes, yes, yes.

4116
03:53:22,740 --> 03:53:23,440
Are you coming to the park?

4117
03:53:24,820 --> 03:53:25,300
Yon.

4118
03:53:28,200 --> 03:53:28,960

4122
03:53:35,820 --> 03:53:36,560
There's a lineup.

4123
03:53:39,080 --> 03:53:39,220
Alright.

4124
03:53:39,320 --> 03:53:39,980

03:53:40,080 --> 03:53:41,520
Ready to spray you down.

4126
03:53:45,020 --> 03:53:45,800
I'm ready.

4127
03:53:46,340 --> 03:53:48,140
Did that guy come in here and immediately go to the...

4128
03:53:48,140 --> 03:53:49,540

4129

Long line.

The people.

4133
03:53:58,100 --> 03:53:59,280

03:57:56,830 --> 03:57:57,350
What do you want?

4194
03:57:57,610 --> 03:57:58,030
Oh, nothing?

4195
03:57:59,010 --> 03:57:59,910
Oh, sorry.

4196
03:58:00,370 --> 03:58:01,390

4198
03:58:03,270 --> 03:58:05,190

4199
03:58:12,430 --> 03:58:13,890

03:58:22,990 --> 03:58:23,970

4204
03:58:25,630 --> 03:58:26,230

Someone's drowning.

03:58:36,510 --> 03:58:37,410
My park is dirty.

4209
03:58:38,170 --> 03:58:38,850
Priorities?

4210
03:58:39,350 --> 03:58:39,910

4211
03:58:44,690 --> 03:58:46,130

There are no more janitors!

4240

4241
04:00:38,510 --> 04:00:38,810
Okay.

04:00:40,110 --> 04:00:41,210
It's all me, everybody.

4243
04:00:42,270 --> 04:00:42,990
It's all me.

4244
04:00:43,890 --> 04:00:45,310
Hello, what can I help you with?

4245
04:00:45,770 --> 04:00:47,190

4251
04:01:10,380 --> 04:01:10,900
Welcome.

4252
04:01:11,200 --> 04:01:15,140
I think- I think Bray- Bray-Lyn is gone right now.

4253
04:01:15,780 --> 04:01:18,100
Bray-Lyn, I really need- Bray-Lyn, please.

4254
04:01:18,600 --> 04:01:19,680
Is everybody bugged?

4255
04:01:20,520 --> 04:01:23,440
Bray-Lyn, please- I can't do this alone!

4256
04:01:28,340 --> 04:01:28,860
Please!

4257
04:01:33,620 --> 04:01:34,580
Yep.

4258
04:01:35,920 --> 04:01:37,360
Oh, no, not me!

4259
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:45,100
I can't do this on my own.

4260
04:01:46,060 --> 04:01:47,460
Oh, please.

4261
04:01:48,360 --> 04:01:48,560
Oh,

4262
04:01:51,840 --> 04:01:52,300
please.

4263
04:01:54,300 --> 04:01:55,880
The NPCs are breaking.

4264
04:01:59,780 --> 04:02:00,740
I'm

4265
04:02:04,510 --> 04:02:06,490
just trying to clean.

4266
04:02:07,790 --> 04:02:08,750
Oh.

4267
04:02:08,770 --> 04:02:09,990
No!

4268
04:02:11,070 --> 04:02:11,450
Ah!

4269
04:02:16,400 --> 04:02:18,920
Rib Marvin's three children and wife.

4270
04:02:19,740 --> 04:02:22,600
My guy should have...

4271
04:02:22,600 --> 04:02:24,780
Should have unbugged himself!

4272
04:02:26,180 --> 04:02:28,180
It's a doggy dog world out there!

4273
04:02:30,940 --> 04:02:31,620
Hello?

4274
04:02:32,340 --> 04:02:32,860
Yes.

4275
04:02:33,400 --> 04:02:34,380
Hot dog ketchup.

4276
04:02:35,680 --> 04:02:36,520
There you go.

4277
04:02:36,860 --> 04:02:37,400
Sorry for the wait.

4278
04:02:37,940 --> 04:02:39,520
Thank you for being so patient with me.

4279
04:02:40,620 --> 04:02:41,380
Don't do it.

4280
04:02:43,480 --> 04:02:46,560
You could step anywhere else.

4281
04:02:50,780 --> 04:02:52,420
Raylan's back, right?

4282
04:02:53,620 --> 04:02:55,160
Oh, my god.

4283
04:02:57,620 --> 04:02:57,940
Hello.

4284
04:02:58,440 --> 04:02:59,300
Slide pass.

4285
04:02:59,800 --> 04:03:00,340
A teen.

4286
04:03:01,080 --> 04:03:01,320
Really?

4287
04:03:01,700 --> 04:03:02,140
Oh, okay.

4288
04:03:02,260 --> 04:03:03,500
I guess you could kind of look like a teen.

4289
04:03:07,820 --> 04:03:10,080
Wait, that's a man who's breaking the law.

4290
04:03:12,440 --> 04:03:13,080
Wait.

4291
04:03:13,720 --> 04:03:15,260
Why didn't I get...

4292
04:03:15,260 --> 04:03:16,960
Oh, you're just going anyway, okay.

4293
04:03:17,380 --> 04:03:17,820
Um, hello?

4294
04:03:19,640 --> 04:03:20,060
Oh, wait.

4295
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:22,560
I didn't get that.

4296
04:03:22,760 --> 04:03:23,720
Wait, is he actually...

4297
04:03:23,720 --> 04:03:23,860
Oh.

4298
04:03:26,160 --> 04:03:28,480
Wait, maybe he's doing his job.

4299
04:03:31,160 --> 04:03:31,940
Oh, he is!

4300
04:03:32,340 --> 04:03:33,280
He's just...

4301
04:03:33,280 --> 04:03:34,800
He's telepathic!

4302
04:03:38,710 --> 04:03:39,830
He's telepathic!

4303
04:03:41,150 --> 04:03:41,650
Smelly?

4304
04:03:43,470 --> 04:03:44,030
...

4305
04:03:50,680 --> 04:03:51,380
Lemonade?

4306
04:03:52,240 --> 04:03:52,760
Add lemon?

4307
04:03:53,240 --> 04:03:53,580
Ice.

4308
04:03:55,600 --> 04:03:56,700
Catch up.

4309
04:03:57,500 --> 04:03:59,080
This is making me want a dog.

4310
04:04:00,060 --> 04:04:00,320
You know?

4311
04:04:01,220 --> 04:04:01,560
Lemon?

4312
04:04:01,940 --> 04:04:02,220
Ice.

4313
04:04:02,980 --> 04:04:04,580
This is making me want some dogs.

4314
04:04:06,240 --> 04:04:07,660
He's social distancing.

4315
04:04:09,540 --> 04:04:11,980
We love a considerate king.

4316
04:04:12,380 --> 04:04:12,720
What the?

4317
04:04:13,620 --> 04:04:14,560
Gavin is injured!

4318
04:04:15,060 --> 04:04:15,980
What did I do?

4319
04:04:21,180 --> 04:04:21,880
Gavin!

4320
04:04:22,040 --> 04:04:22,300
Gavin!

4321
04:04:25,400 --> 04:04:28,180
Oh, I think Gavin is dead.

4322
04:04:51,320 --> 04:04:51,980
Thank God.

4323
04:04:55,020 --> 04:04:56,740
The day is over.

4324
04:05:02,470 --> 04:05:03,650
One hot dog, please.

4325
04:05:04,150 --> 04:05:05,510
This one is for you, Minto.

4326
04:05:06,870 --> 04:05:07,610
Thank you.

4327
04:05:10,070 --> 04:05:10,910
Hide the body.

4328
04:05:12,930 --> 04:05:14,050
I received a fine.

4329
04:05:14,210 --> 04:05:15,610
I don't know what happened.

4330
04:05:18,710 --> 04:05:21,070
Surely there is something in the contracts.

4331
04:05:22,190 --> 04:05:23,010
Something in our contract.

4332
04:05:23,310 --> 04:05:24,230
Like, not contract.

4333
04:05:26,070 --> 04:05:26,970
Is that Gavin?

4334
04:05:27,850 --> 04:05:28,970
Oh, no, it's Kaysen.

4335
04:05:29,310 --> 04:05:30,210
Who the hell are you?

4336
04:05:30,970 --> 04:05:32,510
Surely there's some sort of waiver.

4337
04:05:33,290 --> 04:05:35,350
I think Braylon is broke, broke, man.

4338
04:05:36,030 --> 04:05:36,970
He can't do this.

4339
04:05:37,050 --> 04:05:37,850
I can't do this.

4340
04:05:37,930 --> 04:05:38,930
We can't do this anymore.

4341
04:05:40,770 --> 04:05:42,390
Yeah, there's gotta be some sort of waiver.

4342
04:05:47,780 --> 04:05:48,220
Oh.

4343
04:05:48,620 --> 04:05:48,880
