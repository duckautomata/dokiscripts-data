00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,100
Hello,

2
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,250

3
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,910

4
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,930
Thank you so much for the time gifted.

5
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,850
Wait, I missed another one.

6
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,750
Andregos, thank you for the 20 gifted.

7
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,310
Thank you, thank you.

8
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,190
Hello?

9
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,730
Hello, hello.

10
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,610
Congrats on the 10 to 2 EXE Discord and Fan Club launch!

11
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,030
Saw you saying howdy and not to post your stickers.

12
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,490
Yeah!

13
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,910
We launched Fan Club Patreon.

14
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,230
I was gonna post about it later.

15
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,670
Because I got caught up in stuff, but...

16
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,650
I became a Patreon member.

17
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,710
Thank you!

18
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,030
Thank you, thank you!

19
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,330
If you become a Patreon member, thank you so much.

20
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,790
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,790
Yeah.

22
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,330
Love the MGS Con trailer too.

23
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,430
I want to call it a trailer.

24
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,970
Since it's not for like...

25
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,670
Not for...

26
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,530
This year.

27
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,930
It was for last year.

28
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:31,730
But...

29
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,070
You have some very diverse Patreon options.

30
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,430
Oh, thank you for having...

31
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,230
Oh, yes.

32
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,910
Of course.

33
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,470
I was like, what are you...

34
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,490
I mean...

35
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,110
Valentine, thank you so much for the tour.

36
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,410
Thank you.

37
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,830
Hello, Minto and Ibo's like you.

38
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,250
Glasses, Minky Ark, this is exactly what I wanted.

39
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,650
I wanted to match the thumbnail a little bit.

40
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,910
What do you guys think, though?

41
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,210
I don't know if I...

42
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,190
I never know if glasses suit me.

43
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,750
But, I mean...

44
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,790
I know many people are a glasses enjoyer, so...

45
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,010
I don't know if this suits me, though.

46
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:20,610
I don't know So excited to finally be a member of the
Patreon Thank You Camp Patrol Also saw your tweets for the

47
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:33,530
Fumintos Excited to get the three I ordered They're
ginormous though The Fumo style Minto Is like It's like I'm

48
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:42,270
not even kidding When I say it's the size of like A toddler
or a baby Three of them?

49
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,490
Three of them?

50
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,510
Wowie.

51
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,950
Thank you!

52
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,410
Was that the real Major Zero?

53
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,190
That was the real Major Zero, yes.

54
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,950
I know, it's kind of insane.

55
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,950
It's incredibly insane for me.

56
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,010
You are very cute in glasses.

57
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,490
There, now you know.

58
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,630
Three in a trench coat.

59
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,530
Oh my gosh, you could put all three of them.

60
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:24,150
You could stack them on top of each other and they would be
like a small child and then you could go to...

61
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,850
You could be like...

62
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,830
Wait, no.

63
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,570
Okay.

64
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,130
Wait.

65
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,770
How do you get a free plane ticket?

66
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,490
Babies fly free.

67
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,850
So you bring her on the plane.

68
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,310
Wait.

69
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,470
Wait, hold on.

70
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,150
Hold on.

71
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,350
Thank you.

72
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,270
No, keep going.

73
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,190
I'm trying.

74
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,950
Nevermore.

75
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,610
Welcome back.

76
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,310
Thank you.

77
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,910
Not the size of the Fumo that matters, Minto.

78
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,050
I'm not saying.

79
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,650
Also, Mr. Noodle Bombs, thank you so much for the pink.

80
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,270
game because I knew you'd come around and play it and wanted
to experience this for the first time with Mickey.

81
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,270
What?

82
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,490
I've also known nothing about this game.

83
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,870
I know nothing.

84
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:29,790
Um, uh, I heard some things about like, people don't like,
uh, a certain girl.

85
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,890
I don't even remember her name though.

86
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,430
Uh, but don't tell me.

87
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:35,830
Don't tell me.

88
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,230
Don't tell me.

89
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:36,690
Don't tell me.

90
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,550
Um, don't tell me.

91
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,990
I closed Anyways, try not to spoil anything.

92
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,650
I'm gonna chill here about the Dentsitude Discord
experiences.

93
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,210
Opening day rush.

94
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,490
So many members already, you could say it's...

95
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,030
Dents.

96
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,630
I think Steiner hates me.

97
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,210
Why would he make that the only sticker in the Discord?

98
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,310
I mean, Tokyo class is also my PFP finally updated from the
art stream.

99
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,110
Oh, I see.

100
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,070
Why?

101
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:07,970
Sad.

102
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,950
It did.

103
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,630
It did.

104
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,390
It did.

105
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:14,970
It did.

106
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,070
It did.

107
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,390
Check it out.

108
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,990
Thank you.

109
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,590
Mega naming to cute.

110
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,430

111
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,350
Yeah, no spoilers.

112
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,250

Thank you.

117
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,530
Oh yeah, I don't know anything.

118
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,230
So, remember to use the sensor option.

119
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,920

Okay.

130
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,560
Okay.

131
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,240
Trust in the sensor.

132
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:33,780
Okay.

133
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,560
You have remote analytics allowed?

134
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,460
What is that?

135
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,660
I don't even know what that is.

136
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,860
Congrats on your fan club opening.

137
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,320
Dense mint.

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,040
Thank you.

139
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,300
Oh, thank you for the keychain, by the way.

140
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,600
I've been going, I just got like a package recently of a
bunch of like fan letters and everything from Hallmat.

141
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,820
And I got one from Vexpo not too long ago too.

142
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,740
So I've been like slowly yinning through them.

143
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
So thank you.

144
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,060
Censoring is cowardly.

145
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,640
Let your freak flag fly.

146
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,120
But YouTube does not like that.

147
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,460
It's really big, I promise.

148
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,100
It's big, it's big.

149
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,600
It's big.

150
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,680
And no, two plush in a trench coat is not the same size as
me.

151
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,440
You can always pause and toggle off screen.

152
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,580
About a ticket for off, Kai, yesterday.

153
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,460
Can't wait to meet so many cool eyeballs.

154
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,700
Can't wait to support you through your Patreon.

155
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,360
So can they kill?

156
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,280
Yeah, Kai's.

157
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,140
Big things happening for Off-Kai.

158
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,320
There will be much Mito about for Off-Kai, maybe.

159
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,380
You guys are gonna get sick of me.

160
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,200
You guys are gonna be so sick.

161
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,140
You're gonna be like, oh my gosh, I'm going to get the gun.

162
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, I can't get this ghost to stop haunting me, man.

163
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,240
Paggy Mito, Paggy!

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,980
As someone who really likes this game, I gotta agree.

165
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,860
But won't stop you from replaying on your own in the future.

166
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,660
So true.

167
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,980
YouTube will likely have a problem with the visual
uncensored parts.

168
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,700
That's okay.

169
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,480
So proud of you joining MGSCon.

170
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,340

Thank you, thank you.

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,340
Thank you again for the profile pic drawing.

173
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,020
Instead of using it as a profile pic, is it okay if I use it
as my banner for YouTube and Twitter?

174
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,720
Of course!

175
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,040
It's for you to use!

176
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Thank you, by size!

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,250
Happy birthday.

230
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,050
All right, play game.

231
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,030
I just want...

232
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,190
So much to talk about.

233
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,990
Oh, and I have the Replace Music on Visual Censorship.

234
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,230
There's really nudity in this.

235
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,030
Wow.

236
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,330
It is school days.

237
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,370
Spread your wings and fly.

238
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,390
God be with you.

239
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,930
Now cue the music.

240
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,110
I can't believe it.

241
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,260
Oh, wait, what's it?

242
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,440
Oh, quick time events.

243
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,380
Wait, what?

244
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,600
What's the difference?

245
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,700
There's nothing here for cinematic.

246
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:47,940
Wait.

247
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,240
Happy birthday, Minto.

248
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,380
It's not my birthday!

249
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,260
Cinematic means no QTE.

250
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,260
But QTE is...

251
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,500
I think...

252
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,840
Cinematic plays itself.

253
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
Wait, but how do I pick the option then?

254
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,680
So you don't get to...

255
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,440
Pick the option?

256
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,360
I kind of want the QTEs on, so it feels like school days.

257
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,940
Sorry, I'm also thinking about school days recently.

258
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,340
Oh, this isn't for choices.

259
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,260
Oh!

260
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,660
Wow.

261
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,040
Oh, what?

262
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,280
The QTEs aren't very good.

263
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, really?

264
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,900
Oh, you still get dialogue options.

265
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,640
Oh, that's strange.

266
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,940
Wait, so like, for this example, if I like don't do this
swipe, he doesn't text.

267
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Is that what happens?

268
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,860
What if it's for fight?

269
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,660
Okay, okay.

270
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,860
Well, I guess we'll try cinematic.

271
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,420
Be part of the action includes quick time events.

272
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,500
I feel, well, I don't know.

273
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,360
He fails.

274
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,520
I kind of want to, I don't know how this game plays, or
rather, our character's character so far, but I kind of want

275
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,500
to make him like an asshole that nobody likes.

276
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:11,980
Yo.

277
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,790
Wait, but if it's, like, telltale, I did interactive before,
I know.

278
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,630
So let's do it.

279
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,990
I want to play the game.

280
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,270
We'll do quick time events, it's fine.

281
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:39,570
I love movie games though My brain is very like Mashed

If you want something to scream about, I'll give you
something to scream about.

318
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,940
He's not shutting up.

319
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,180
Not the soothing goon.

320
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,940
Not a deal.

321
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,820
He will remember that.

322
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,320
You piece of shit!

323
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,940
Hey, I ruined a perfectly good mattress to make sure you
didn't die.

324
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,460
Okay?

325
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,260

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,420
And now you're free!

327
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,060
There you go.

328
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,400
Oh, wait.

329
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,280
Wait, press...

330
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,620
Oh!

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,340
I'm part of the action, guys!

332
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,320
Oh, whoop!

333
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,280
I'm part of the action!

334
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,460
Yeah!

335
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
Oh, I thought I was gonna lower my eyebrows.

336
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,820
Shroud!

337
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm in the game!

338
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm part of the action.

339
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,620
Oh!

340
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
I thought we weren't a hero.

341
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,840
I thought we were a normal guy.

342
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,040
This is exciting.

343
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,740
I have to pay attention then.

344
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,260
Oh my gosh, I can't just be staring at you guys.

345
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,560
The animation in this is so good.

346
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,550
I'm gonna try not looking at chat so much though because I
think people will spoil things.

347
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,870
I'm so sorry.

348
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:39,630
Oh.

349
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,790
I thought I was texting.

350
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,950
Smart egg.

351
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,810
It's understandable, Mint.

352
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,930
Yeah, sorry, guys.

353
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,770
Oh, shit.

354
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:03,530
He's here.

355
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,910
Raptor goons.

356
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,590
Oh, shoot.

357
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,490
I'm part of the action.

358
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,950
Ha!

359
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,570
Ha!

360
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,310
Oh my god, I'm doing so much!

361
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,620
Oh yeah, team.

362
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,180
Oh yeah.

363
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,560
Oh no, team.

364
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,360
Oh no.

365
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,060
It's a QC.

366
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,560
Got games on your pad.

367
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,320
Oh.

368
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,900
Time to finish this.

369
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,980
Wait.

370
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,500
Oh!

371
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,260
Me, me, me, me.

372
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,080
Eee!

373
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,960
Me, me, me.

374
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,940
What's this?

375
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Eee!

376
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:01,940
Oh.

377
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,460
What's this?

378
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,800
Wait, it says something.

379
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,600
Some nodes, what?

380
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,480
I was just clicking.

381
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,860
Alright, next one.

382
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,440
Okay.

383
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,340
Oh, we're collecting the date.

384
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,560
Oh, wait.

385
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Ah, now I have to fix the other...

386
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:20,720
Oh.

387
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,320
Okay, okay.

388
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,860
Oh, interesting.

389
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,900
I don't know how y'all.

390
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,800
Fuck yeah.

391
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,020
Just one more.

392
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,980
Freak yeah.

393
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:35,820
Oh.

394
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,760
Okay.

395
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,000
Sure, I know you were gonna do that to me.

396
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,200
Oh my gosh, I'm hacking.

397
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Hacker man, kid.

398
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,100
Hacker man kid.

399
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,120
Got it.

400
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,020
I'm holding.

401
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm holding again.

402
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,100
This is why I have my smart glasses on, everybody.

403
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,760
I'm holding.

404
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Oh, I've dragged it down.

405
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,720
Got it.

406
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,300
Shroud.

407
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,240
That's a secret.

408
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
Hope you're having a great day, man.

409
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,820
You too, Maxer!

410
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,440
Thank you!

411
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,740
Oh,

412
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,420
he saw...

413
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,840
It's over, Shroud.

414
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,040
Hey, um, can I get a copy of that video when we're through
here?

415
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,700
Because it's over, Shroud.

416
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,100
And it would be nice to watch that back at a different
angle.

417
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,980
Oh, not...

418
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,000
It's over, Shroud!

419
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,820
Soothing good!

420
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:05,040

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:13,440

424
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,260
He just pissed himself like a little bitch.

425
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,820
It was like so much pissed.

426
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,700
Because your dad was wearing shorts.

427
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,040

Let's shut up.

433
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,060
Idiot.

434
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,660
He probably was so excited to hear about all of me.

435
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,980
And you guys shouldn't get excited either, okay?

436
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,740
Everybody, please.

437
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,540
Calm down, calm down.

438
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,840
Oh, he's still alive!

439
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,960
I didn't need to waste a perfectly good mattress to break
your fall.

440
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,080
Perfectly good.

441
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,300
I assume that cum stain's- He lost his shoe even!

442
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,880
Can we just skip to the part where you reveal your bullshit
superpower so we can fight for real harm?

443
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,160
Oh.

444
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,740
Oh.

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,300
Ew!

446
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,580
Good man.

447
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,280
Oh!

448
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
Cool dick.

449
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,460
Oh!

450
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,480
Oh!

451
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,540
So, uh, got some kind of clever superpowers.

452
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,520
You can call me toxic.

453
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,020
Bro, that works on so many levels for you.

454
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,040
Yeah, no shit.

455
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,220
That's the point.

456
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,120
Oh my god, no wonder!

457
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,140
Your child's augments are pretty good in mornings like you
use them.

458
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,620
When you put them on someone who already has powers, fucking
chef's kiss.

459
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,320
Who am I?

460
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,540
Hi, you guys are right.

461
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,280
I wouldn't be fast enough.

462
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,080
I wouldn't be fast enough!

463
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,980
I wouldn't- I wouldn't cover anything!

464
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,760
Oh my god!

465
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,260
Does everybody who has the powers become naked?

466
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,600
I can't stop staring at the box!

467
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,060
That's like, what if it's- Oh shoot, oh shoot, I missed it.

468
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,700
Oh shoot, oh!

469
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,720
That's okay.

470
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,500
We make it.

471
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,160
We win.

472
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,520
We still are winning.

473
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,580
It's the box's fault.

474
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,520
Oh.

475
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh my god.

476
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,100
It's the box's fault, everybody.

477
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,140
Woo!

478
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,280
Be strong.

479
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,520
Oh my god.

480
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,400
Oh!

481
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,780
Oh!

482
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,620
Bubbler!

483
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,380
I can't.

484
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,860
I can't stop.

485
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,360
What if it, like, does...

486
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,600
Like, what if it disappears like that?

487
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,550
I got this?

488
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,120
Oh, yeah.

489
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,100
Oh, yeah.

490
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,740
Oh, yeah.

491
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,930
Smash.

492
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,110
Squish.

493
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,290
Uh-oh.

494
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,430
Um, that's my dream to be encased in jelly.

495
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,070
I'll eat my way out of it.

496
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:57,850
Oh, yep.

497
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,470
Bloop goon!

498
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,770
Maybe I'm not the pro tag.

499
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,250
Uh-oh.

500
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,240
Rattrow.

501
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:43,840
Nice.

502
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,060
Nice.

503
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,360
Reboot, reboot, reboot.

504
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,160
Uh-oh, is this the big body?

505
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,700

I'm just the messenger here.

517
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,030
I don't want to talk to that guy.

518
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,490
And...

519
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,810

Now get out of there, babe.

525
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,350
He called me, babe.

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,220
Macamai.

534
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,260
Macamai.

535
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,740
Macamai.

536
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,560
I think we did a little whoopsie.

537
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,750
Oh!

538
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,520
Uh-oh.

539
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,160
Title card.

540
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,180
Oh no!

541
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,640
Oh my gosh.

542
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,500
Don't.

543
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,620
Don't nap at the wheel.

544
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,160
Oh my gosh, this is a TikTok.

545
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,520
Don't do this.

546
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:44,680
Oh.

547
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,220
It was just over four months ago that images like this were
recorded across the Southland.

548
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,080
Videos flooded social media and our newsroom.

549
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,840
Recording in total silence.

550
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,820
The death of Mega Man.

551
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,100
Again.

552
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,920
For nearly 50 years.

553
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,440
Again.

554
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,360
Has protected Los Angeles.

555
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,520
Built by an ordinary civilian with no superpowers.

556
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,120
Oh.

557
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,720
We're like Iron Man!

558
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,540
We saw a Mecha Man Prime.

559
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:20,760
Three generations of pilots, their identities kept secret,
have given everything to protect this community, including

560
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,600
their lives.

561
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,280
After the tragic passing of Prime, the next Mecha Man, known
as Astral, generational Iron Man.

562
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,600
Yeah, wait, that's so awesome!

563
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,260
Known as the Brave Brigade.

564
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,360
Brave Brigade.

565
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,280
Leading to an unprecedented period of peace in the
Southland.

566
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,720
Wait, but we probably don't have a Mecha Man to...

567
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,840
Tragedy struck again.

568
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,700
A former Brave Brigade member turned villain killed the
pilot of Mecha Man in cold blood.

569
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,900
But yet again, as hope was lost, a third generation of Mecha
Man emerged.

570
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,580
We don't have a son, do we?

571
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,020
To become the next Mecha Man?

572
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,840
A bulwark against organized crime in the greater Los Angeles
area.

573
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,380
Until today.

574
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,660
Earlier today, Mecha Man broke his silence and addressed the
media.

575
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,740
Where is he?

576
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,360
There's been a lot of speculation about my health and the
state of the mecha man suit and all it all got out of with

577
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:29,000
just a cast That's pretty great and damage beyond my ability
to repair so I will be stepping back from superhero work

578
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,080
Effective immediately.

579
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,500
Does this mean you're finished?

580
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,160

581
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,080

I came back and it was not there anymore.

588
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,270
And I went and got it.

589
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,010
My foolproof plan is vacuum cleaner.

590
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,890
And I won.

591
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,410
I won.

592
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,890
Did you give the roach a cute name with a warm place to
sleep?

593
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,450
Absolutely.

594
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,770
That thing was...

595
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,990
I've never seen of that size.

596
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,450
Oh my God.

597
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,270

601
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,410
That thing was, that thing was like a mutant.

602
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,250
It was beyond, beyond anything.

603
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,690
Oh my god.

604
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,690
Worse than Matara Khan.

605
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,790
I'm not saying a lot coming from me.

606
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,310
What if there's a second one?

607
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,810
Okay, I'm sorry.

608
00:42:59,470 --> 00:42:59,950
Okay.

609
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,530
Oh my god, I feel like I'm going to throw up for real.

610
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:05,910
Hold on.

611
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,070
Oh my god.

612
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,690
Okay, let's get back to the game.

613
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,770
Oh, resume, resume.

614
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,890
Just don't think about it anywhere.

615
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:11,910
Next question.

616
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,510
Chris Stratton, Torrance Tribune.

617
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,030
Okay.

618
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,210
Does this mean you're retiring as Mecha Man?

619
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,630
Word on the street is, you're Dunzo.

620
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,730
That's what I just said.

621
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,850
Are you a hundred years old?

622
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,930
Why are you talking like that?

623
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,350
Answer the question, buddy boy.

624
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,050
I say Dunzo.

625
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:25,850
Are you retiring?

626
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,070
My readers need the Skinny, and I aim to deliver.

627
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:29,690
No comment.

628
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,690
Let's get it on the record.

629
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,170
I'm not looking to comment on that just yet.

630
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,830
That's the only Skinny I can give you.

631
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,570
The Skinny.

632
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,450
Alright, just one more, please.

633
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,270
I gotta get back to, uh...

634
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:40,970
Just...

635
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,070
Just wanna...

636
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,430
Preferably someone from the century...

637
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,210
A hundred years old!

638
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,110
Charles Kingsley, South Bay Signal.

639
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:55,770
So, Shroud kills your father, goes to jail 15 years, breaks
out, and immediately dupes you into a trap, where he

640
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,870
destroys the Mecha Man suit, and puts you in a coma for
months.

641
00:43:59,410 --> 00:43:59,750
Okay.

642
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,370
Yeah, what's your question?

643
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,250
I didn't hear a question.

644
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,810
Two-parter.

645
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,290
First, why didn't Shroud kill you?

646
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,630
You haven't been conscious for months.

647
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,790
It'd be easy money taking you out.

648
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,190
Okay Shroud wanted the Astral Pulse and Mecha Man gone.

649
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,170
He got both.

650
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,230
I'm not sure I mattered much.

651
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:19,990
Right.

652
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,230
You're unimportant.

653
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,590
Which leads me to my next question.

654
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:24,030
Right.

655
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,150
Most heroes avenge your family.

656
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,410
You did the opposite.

657
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,710
You killed your legacy.

658
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,530
Oh my god.

659
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,070
How disappointed would your dad be if he were here right

Oh.

well that's not totally true oh you're joking sorry it's

709
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:12,330
fine don't worry about keeping up something to do with the
powers it it takes a lot for me to feel anything what is

710
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:21,950
that sentence oh hey you should give yourself more credit to
do what you did for as long as you did especially without

711
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:31,230
superpowers not true what do you call this oh I can fix that
one for you too no thanks I like this one it's double joy

712
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:41,490
thank you how wait but it's how did you afford all that it's
not water for real hundreds of Millions.

713
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:42,410
Millions.

714
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,210
So you'll understand when the check comes.

715
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:45,230
You're serious.

716
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:47,330
Millions.

717
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,090
Yeah, I basically burned through my entire inheritance,
keeping it going.

718
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,530
The last couple years have just been duct tape and mature.

719
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:55,690
Termination.

720
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,210
Who pays you?

721
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,530
Why did you do it?

722
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:00,370
You what?

723
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,110
Sacrifice everything to be a superhero to the point of
financial...

724
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:05,390
Ruined?

725
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,610
I was gonna say hardship, but...

726
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,690
It's a bar, it's always alcohol.

727
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,870
When I go to the bar, I get orange juice.

728
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,650
You must be completely broke at this point.

729
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,650
Um, it's the only thing I'm good at.

730
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,550
Honestly, it's the only thing I'm good at.

731
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,990
Now that's a sad sentence.

732
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,090
Come on, that can't be true.

733
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,850
Or, maybe we're not very good at it because we're out of a
job.

734
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,110
So, are you drunk yet or what?

735
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,450
Uh, yeah, yeah, I should probably be switching to water.

736
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:40,310
Good, because I was hoping, after some drinks to loosen you
up, I could learn a little more about you.

737
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:52,110

44% is very spooky, but also 45%.

864
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,480
Okay, I'm sorry.

865
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,240
And it's...

866
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,260
Is that not high for California?

867
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,460
I thought that place was dry, dry, dry.

868
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,420
Okay.

869
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,760

subscriber.

873
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:10,260
I saw some scary, suspicious men last night leaving the old
movie theater.

874
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:15,140
You'll receive requirements to help you determine which
heroes to send.

875
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,160
Okay, strike the devil's fortified base of operations.

876
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,340
brave heroes to choose from.

877
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,340
This guy is just paper.

878
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,680
How could you possibly pick just one?

879
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:31,660
This graph will show you what a hero does well and not so
well.

880
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,640
Subscribe done.

Can I continue?

883
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,080
A hero with a knack for vigor and combat looks right for the
job.

884
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:43,780
All right.

885
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:45,420

01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,970
Don't forget to review your hero's performance.

901
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,210
They won't be sent out again until you do.

902
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,070

909
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,220
I missed the voice that says mini-skirts.

910
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:57,960
What?

911
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,860
Oh, beep, beep, beep.

912
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:10,920
Organized criminals, often led by figurehead supervillains
are the scourge of Southern California.

913
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,480
By luck?

914
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,640
We work tirelessly to root them out.

915
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,200
Okay.

916
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,100
Oh, pita, pita, pita.

917
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,200
Investigate the dorm room.

918
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,940
We've got a potential villain.

919
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:29,880
hideout on the college campus okay sometimes the solution is
brains not brawn SDN's diverse array of heroes can solve any

920
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:36,860
problem investigate the potential villain hideout discovered
at the local college decode the mysterious clues to identify

921
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:47,000
the cryptic criminal so we need someone with some intellect
and maybe the charisma maybe like a brain book but pom-pom

922
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,540
said something but She's more mobile than...

923
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,740
Steiner's PLV better than Dead Sin 2.

924
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,040
What do you mean by that?

925
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,140
You can send two.

926
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,000
That's true.

927
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,680
I do things by the book.

928
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,740
Let's try sending two.

929
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,280
Whoa!

930
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,920
Holy cow!

931
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:10,720
What?

932
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,220
Flattery will get you everywhere.

933
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,600
Yeah.

934
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:18,520
Holy cow!

935
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,120
DECAL!

936
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,280
Knowledge is power.

937
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:22,680
There they go.

938
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,800
Can I like move the map?

939
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:25,680
I don't know.

940
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,860
They're investigating?

941
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,240
It probably went so amazingly well.

942
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,820
Ah, so it was more...

943
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,220
Guys, I think it was overkill maybe.

944
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:41,620
What can I say?

945
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,940
A lot, actually.

946
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,140
A lot, actually.

947
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,880
Peep-peep-peep-peep-peep.

948
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,280
Art exhibit opening.

949
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,780
The museum is doing an exhibit on local superheroes and need
a guest speaker.

950
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,560
Oh, no.

951
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,900
I'll unveil the new superhero exhibit to the excited
audience.

952
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,080
Incorporate your unique perspective as a superhero.

953
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,580
So probably someone with a lot of charisma.

954
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,780
Do we send the paper?

955
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,060
Oh, no, sweet docker.

956
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,260
We lost our guy.

957
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,900
I guess we have to send paper.

958
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,460
Oh, you can wait?

959
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,400
How long?

960
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,940
Oh, oh, okay, I'll see.

961
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,440
Oh, they don't take that long to rest.

962
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,000
Oh, okay.

963
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,920
Thought it was like, what's the word?

964
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,480
Like, um, per, uh.

965
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:34,820
Gladly.

966
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,280
Like, mission.

967
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,080
So they would be rested after until the next mission.

968
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,960
Oh, if these streets could talk.

969
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,660
Later, there'll be time.

970
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,280
One of your heroes needs you.

971
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:58,100
what why disrupted as their leader your heroes will look to
you make choices and follow where they lead the speech sdn

972
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:07,900
prepared is boring the crowd we're going to have to
improvise uh show off some moves or yeah uh jokes well this

973
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,990
is she's better she's a sweet talker i think jokes would be
better

974
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:27,570
complete these choices need the right skill each of your
hero's strengths and weaknesses.

975
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:28,150
Whoa.

976
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,410
What can I say?

977
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:33,710
A lot, actually.

978
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,210
You already said that, actually.

979
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:37,670
So maybe you can't say that much.

980
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,930
This is much more in-depth than I thought it actually.

981
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:40,490
Whoa.

982
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:43,950
Oh, no!

983
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:45,770
Okay.

984
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,890
The convoy of Diablo's goons are harrying the highway
patrol.

985
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,130
Intercept the convoy.

986
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:52,770
As if traffic in this city was not bad enough.

987
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:53,750
Overwhelmed them with attacks.

988
01:08:54,370 --> 01:09:04,030

01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:38,770
What does that even mean?

996
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,190
Uh-oh, wait.

997
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:42,510

01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:47,710

Grandma, cross the road!

1009
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:36,230
The diabolical supervillain El Diablo is attacking Los
Angeles General.

1010
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,830
Oh no, it's one of my arch nemesis's.

1011
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:40,950
El Diablo.

1012
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,810
That means the Diablo in Spanish.

1013
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,930
He must have been using the convoy ambush as a distraction.

1014
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:50,230
And to attack helpless hospital people!

1015
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,690
Uh oh, my gosh.

1016
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:59,250
Speaking of hospitals, You know, SDN offers a robust
benefits package for all full-time employees.

1017
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,190
That's phenomenal.

1018
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,470
Um, I don't think we have anybody.

1019
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,290
So sorry.

1020
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:06,850
We're busy.

1021

Negotiate.

1022
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:09,670
Oh, wait.

1023
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,210
SDN values work-life balance.

1024
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,230
When the bell rings, your shift will end very soon.

1025
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,710
Okay, I intercepted.

1026

01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:27,450
Wait, so what about all the emergencies then?

1029

1030
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:32,750
Uh-oh.

1031
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,110

It's a good thing we sent him both then.

1034
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:39,850
Monster distracted.

1035
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,010
Um, sorry, El Diablo.

1036
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:44,430
Oops.

1037
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,150
Oh, we can get Grandma across there.

1038
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:50,230
I need help getting to my doctor's appointment.

1039
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,350
Make haste before she misses.

1040
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,710
This is her doctor's appointment.

1041
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,330
I think we got a...

1042
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,550
Oh god, no.

1043
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:02,430
Help us.

1044
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,690
We're being held hostage.

1045
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:04,530
Send help.

1046
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:05,070
Please.

1047
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,070
We got a sweet talk, these guys.

1048
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:12,330
You can find suggestions on how to handle hostage situations
on page 234 of SDN's Guide to Dispatching.

1049
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,570
Let's do these two.

1050
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:15,370
I think we'll make it.

1051
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:17,150
Intellectually stimulating.

1052
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,990
Oh yes.

1053
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,370
Okay, we got this.

1054
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:24,270
And my shift is almost over, so we don't even need to care
anymore.

1055
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,790
Crime stops after 5 p.m.

1056
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:28,210
everybody.

1057
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:33,670
Oh!

1058
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,990
I'm like over-killing it a little bit.

1059
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,530
Maybe we need to take more risks.

1060
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,510
Um...

1061
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,790

01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,170
No crime after 5 p.m.

1064
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,050
It's a known rule.

1065
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:55,840

Happy birthday.

1109
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:49,690
I was eating dry cereal from the box.

1110
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,570
Yeah, it's just, you know...

1111
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,290
You and 52% of players threw alcohol.

1112
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:56,790
Good.

1113
01:15:57,870 --> 01:15:59,210
Honestly, yeah.

1114
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,830
Beef doesn't look like it, but he's a chihuahua.

1115
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,950
He's a really fat chihuahua, I think.

1116
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:07,290
How many?

1117
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:10,730
You and 54% of players kissed, please.

01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,170

1119
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:20,010
There's a lot of us misreading the room.

1120
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,970
You and 46% of players let the goon drop.

1121
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,850
Your success rate in the fight with Toxic was 88%.

1122
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,170
You performed better than 10% of players.

1123
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,910
You and 21% of players attacked a reporter?

1124
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,810
Why am I a minority in this?

1125
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:46,950
You and 29% of players dubbed Flambé Mr. Wet Ponytail.

1126
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:51,110
You and 53% of players aced SDN's tutorial shift.

1127
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,430
Oh, I aced it, baby.

everyone else cheered us on so i'm not done saving you yet

1130
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,670

1133
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:39,990
driveway you can count on SDN to help lift the burdens life
throws at us but can you take me home or to the place that I

1134
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:43,230
need to go so you can walk

1135
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:58,390
what about your car she's definitely not making it to be in
practice no yeah yeah wait what's that water boy oh hmm no

1136
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:00,850
just the The commercial, it was weird.

1137
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:03,010
Yeah, right.

1138
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:05,730
Put him on my man.

1139
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,410
He's like a rock star.

1140
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:08,870
Oh my god, he can't say the name either.

1141
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,570
It's, uh, I'm joking, because of the rock and the roll.

1142
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,950
Is he perpetually wet?

1143
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:15,810
Cool commercial.

1144
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:18,570
I'm a mama fan, you might say.

1145
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:19,370
You could say.

1146
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,390
Not a great actor.

1147
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:24,990
He's not the best actor, though, which was important for
that commercial to be less.

1148
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,510
Um, weird.

1149
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,770
He is the best actor ever.

1150
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:35,950
And when there's danger, I think if the whole world is a
play, then he's still awesome.

1151
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:36,510
Oh.

1152
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:37,950
Can't argue that.

1153
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:39,850
Oh.

1154
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:40,590
Oh, God.

1155
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:42,830
You got a...

1156
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,930
Oh, he doesn't know how to do a tie.

1157
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,770
Do you guys know how to tie a tie?

1158
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,710
I don't know how to either.

1159
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:51,110
Oh, no.

1160
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:52,570
Oh, not necessary.

1161
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:53,410
I'm sure I...

1162
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,450
It's so...

1163
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,310
Are you nervous?

1164
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,510
Big job interview.

1165
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:59,050
Not him grabbing his...

1166
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,090
His tie.

1167
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,730
My powers make everything wet, but moist.

1168
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:04,610
Moist.

1169
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:08,050
Water boy is how they call me, but yes, I am.

1170
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,270
Oh no, it's this guy.

1171
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:16,290
Oh no.

1172
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,450
Oh, oops.

01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,330
Oh my god, the music is wild.

1175
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,190
Oh, he lost his eyebrows all of a sudden.

1176
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,330
He had them and then they were gone.

1177
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:29,250

01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,100
Robert, this is Invisigau.

1205
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,800
She is part of the Phoenix program.

1206
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,300
We take former super villains, such as herself, and
rehabilitate them to re-enter society to use their powers

1207
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,000
for us.

1208
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,740
Well, it looks better on me.

1209
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,580
Invisigal, this is Robert.

1210
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,280
He'll be your team's dispatcher.

1211
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,180
Oh, washed up dad bot superhero with no superpowers.

1212
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,340
Can't wait.

1213
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,140
His identity.

1214
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,700
All of this, that's staying between us.

1215
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,560
Wait, why doesn't she have a, why doesn't she hide her
identity then?

1216
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,200
Invisigal, I mean.

1217
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,560
I guess she doesn't.

1218
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,340
I guess she doesn't.

1219
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:53,880
Uh.

1220
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,740
You think I want to tell people our dispatchers a fucking
reason?

1221
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,820
Uh, uh, let's make the best of it.

1222
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:03,520
You might think these are less than ideal circumstances, but
it's something you need to get to when you're out in the

1223
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:14,760
field even that's a dad bod so it's not at all in here we do

1225
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:35,400
list for all the heroes She called herself Invisibitch when
she was a villain.

1226
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,200
We're trying to re-brand her.

1227
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,580
Yeah, I thought Invisigal felt kind of corny for her.

1228
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,340
Invisichick.

1229
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,280
His name was my idea.

1230
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,540
Just get your shirt on, Dad Bod.

1231
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,440
Dad Bod, where?

1232
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,600
I'm sorry!

1233
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:53,100
Do we understand what a Dad Bod is?

1234
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,540
Do we?

1235
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,180
Oh my god, look at him.

1236
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,180
We're not the highest profile branch in the network, but
we're not the highest profile We've got what makes the real

1237
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:03,680
difference.

1238
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,400
Unrealistic body standards.

1239
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,620
Some of them aren't even people, and they're still great.

1240
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,760
You think it was sarcasm?

1241
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,340
I don't know.

1242
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:15,700
Documentation.

1243
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:16,420
One of the three D's.

1244
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,600
I don't think you...

1245
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,540
Like, what would be the purpose of it?

1246
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,860
I used to call it Triple D's, but I was informed that I had
a different connotation.

1247
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:24,880
Triple D's?

1248
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,580
What does that mean?

1249
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,260
Oh, all sorts.

1250
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,380
Some that are tired of doing it themselves.

1251
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,580
What's a Triple D's?

1252
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,080

01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,640
Wash your hands before you run your hands through your hair.

1271
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,280
I guess he didn't touch anything, though.

1272
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,480
You one funny bugger.

1273
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,840
Mecca, man.

1274
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,300
How'd you know that?

1275
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,840
Okay, so I was worried about your unwashed hand, but now I'm
worried that that one here knows who I am.

1276
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:58,680
Nah, brother.

1277
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,580
It's Kapoor.

1278
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,900
Need to know basis and Roy need to know.

1279
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,760
I don't want to come pick up your suit or fix them for the
SDN.

1280
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:05,320
Ah.

1281
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,840
Are you going to wash before you do that?

1282
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:07,560
Nah, bro.

1283
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,180
He's so...

1284
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:08,860
He's so real.

1285
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,680
Wash your hand.

1286
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,740
Let's put my pants in underwear only.

1287
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,820
Even for shake, I just do like this.

1288
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,660
But how do you get it out?

1289
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,960
You have to touch it to get it.

1290
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,680
Can you show me again?

1291
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,800
I don't think I got it.

1292
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,380
Holy shit.

1293
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,640
Who's this freckle face?

1294
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,660
Why is everybody so vulgar in this game?

1295
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,760
I'm going to greet someone.

1296
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,260
Look at this skinny latte prick.

1297
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:37,640
Your bones, kid.

1298
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:40,640
You hear to whip these assholes in the shape of what?

1299
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:41,740
That's the idea.

1300
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,840
Why is this happening?

1301
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,600
Why is this happening?

1302
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:46,220
What?

1303
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,780
It's a hug, not a hand job.

1304
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:48,620
Lighten up.

1305
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,120
Be that as it may, I'm still confused.

1306
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,060
Oh, right.

1307
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,200
Because I'm old as shit.

1308
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,340
How about this?

1309
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,520
This jog your memory?

1310
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:56,980

Holy shit.

1313
01:27:59,140 --> 01:27:59,640
Yeah, you fucking.

1314
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,200
Why are you accepting hugs?

1315
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:06,060
Why are you accepting hugs when you don't know?

1316
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,900
Why are you accepting hugs from people?

1317
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:14,320
old men you don't know 15 years has it really been the dad

the powers i can move 50 times faster than the But I didn't

1321
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:45,600
realize until it was too late and I was aging 50 times
faster when I use my powers Oh, no, there's like a downside

1322
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,240
Nowadays I'm moving slower than frozen pissed and keep the
old ticket.

1323
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,700
How old are you?

1324
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:52,920
How old are you really I turned 39 a few months?

1325
01:28:53,400 --> 01:29:00,140
But this is what super sick a 39 year old actually looks
like though I can't complain to about losing my suit you

1326
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:05,520
better not I would resurrect and re-kill your fucking father
in front of you If it meant being able to use my powers.

1327
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,800
Oh my god Jesus Wow.

1328
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:09,100
What?

1329
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,160
Obviously, I'd let Robert have one last.

1330
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,640
I love you before I extinguish the light from his eyes.

1331
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,620
Was he always like this?

1332
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,200
Yes, actually.

1333
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,060
We joke.

1334
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:20,520
We laugh.

1335
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,500
We suppress our trauma.

1336
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:21,980
So true.

1337
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,300
All right, enough of this feeling shit.

1338
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,200
Let's introduce you to your team of losers.

1339
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,860
I'll take them zeros to heroes.

1340
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:29,960
We got this.

1341
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,080
Looks like I'm sitting in the chair.

1342
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:32,880
Never mind.

1343
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:36,620
Now, if I'm being honest, I thought and still think we
should have canned these tuners months ago.

1344
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,920
And you might get your wish.

1345
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:41,760
Because if we don't see improvements soon, the whole program
will be scrapped.

1346
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:42,060
Cool.

1347
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,260
No pressure.

1348
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,520
Okay.

1349
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,080
Select Unzipped Hero to begin.

1350
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,580
Sonar here was a Harvard graduate who...

1351
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:53,920
Who will not shut the fuck up about being a Harvard graduate
like all Harvard graduates.

1352
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:57,520
Who also orchestrated some of the most effective Silicon
Valley...

1353
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:58,700
Cyberbullying!

1354
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:04,840
Also, sometimes he transforms into a fucking bat monster
that would eat your ass first after he emptied your pension

1355
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,220
plan.

1356
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:08,660
team?

1357
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:09,380
This guy.

1358
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,700
So is he six foot with the ears or without?

1359
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,240
Or is he six foot when he becomes the giant bat?

1360
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:19,920
Hmm?

1361
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:21,780
Flambé.

1362
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,380
Flambé.

1363
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,080
Controls the fire and the flame and his skin does not burn.

1364
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,840
Everyone's so tall!

1365
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,820
Didn't you ever run in with him years back?

1366
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:28,480
I did.

1367
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:29,360
Yeah.

1368
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,220
So you know he's a certifiable dickhead.

1369
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,340
Okay.

1370
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,940
Are we getting only all the un...

1371
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,220
All the It's moist.

1372
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,520
What are you guys talking about?

1373
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:41,980
What does that mean?

1374
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:46,160
Invisigal, who you met.

1375
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:51,920
Turned herself in a few months ago and entered the program
on the condition we didn't ask questions.

1376
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:53,500
That's a little suspicious now.

1377
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,420
Suspicious, really?

1378
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,980
Of a criminal that turns invisible and doesn't like to
answer questions.

1379
01:30:59,440 --> 01:30:59,940
Interesting.

1380
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,880
Assault, larceny, robbery.

1381
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,780
It's not that bad.

1382
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:08,200
Laughing at cyberbullying is water.

1383
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,700
wild.

1384
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:11,540
Well, it's because I just didn't expect it.

1385
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:19,580
It's like embezzlement, extortion, drug possession, forgery,
fraud, money laundering, perjury, but worst of all,

1386
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,040
cyberbullying.

1387
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:28,160
This guy has a Twitter account and he is fully armed and
using it.

1388
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,680
Don't give this guy a keyboard.

1389
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,820
Your feelings will be hurt.

1390
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,780
Here we have Coupé.

1391
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:36,380
Coupé.

dumb to say so everybody calls her coop she was an assassin

beautiful babes of metal gear solid for see this this one

1395
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,320
same level

1396
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:11,760
Coupé.

1397
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:12,840
Coupé.

1398
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,900
I'm brachinetic weaponry.

1399
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:19,780
Brachinetic.

1400
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:20,780
Brachinetic flight.

1401
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,300
Superhuman accuracy.

1402
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,840
Punch up.

1403
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,340
Punch up.

1404
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,660
Carnival strong man who made a deal with a sorceress.

1405
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,420
In the strength of ten men.

1406
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,800
His muscles grew, but his body shrunk.

1407
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,040
Oh.

1408
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,180
He's got all the charming brains of a greasy bowling ball.

1409
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,780
Wait, that's awesome.

1410
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,040
Battery.

1411
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:42,720
parole violation, public intoxication, second degree murder.

1412
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:44,540
Malevola.

1413
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:45,540
Malevola.

1414
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,480
She's got a magic sword, and she creates portals that allow
her to teleport.

1415
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,000
Her height.

1416
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,760
Somehow she's still late for every fucking meeting.

1417
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,220
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she does that on purpose.

1418
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,280
Wait, her height is so funny.

1419
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,580
What's the difference between a first degree murder and a
second degree?

1420
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,000
He's your height.

1421
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,560
No, he's, I'm taller than him.

1422
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:06,440
Malevola.

1423
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:11,550
Intent.

1424
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:14,890
Oh, planned versus unplanned.

1425
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:16,990
Ah, okay, okay.

1426
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,950
Versus premeditated.

1427
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:20,470
Okay, that makes so much more sense.

1428
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,130
Because that's worse.

1429
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:26,770
Actually, they're both pretty, but I mean it's murder.

1430
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:34,010
But, you know, like if you plan it out, then you know,
you're thinking about it for a really long time.

1431
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:37,130
And you're like, you know, I haven't changed my mind.

1432
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,370
Yeah, I still want to murder.

1433
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:49,790
um if you if you do it really like in the spur of the moment
it just shows that you that you uh you know you can't

1434
01:33:49,790 --> 01:34:02,890

feel like it yeah that's golem he is a construct oh yeah a

1435
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:05,290
bunch of dirt and mud made sentient with magic

1439
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,320
A lot of this stuff is a guess.

1440
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,260
She's a pop star.

1441
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,160
Why does she dress like a pop star?

1442
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:43,460
Oh.

1443
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,220
She's actually super talented.

1444
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:45,660
Wow.

1445
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,940
1.3 million followers.

1446
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:48,740
Music snob.

1447
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:50,200
Highly dramatic.

1448
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,400
Consistently requests a return to her trailer.

1449
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:54,800
Okay.

1450
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,320
1.3 million followers.

1451
01:34:58,840 --> 01:34:58,880
Wow.

1452
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:07,000
Yeah, but how many listeners, how many minutes listen do you
have on Spotify?

1453
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,440
Mm-hmm.

1454
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:10,940
You know, how many?

1455
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:16,600
That's the real, that's gonna be the real, you know, tax
evasion.

1456
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:17,840
So she's a V-tuber.

1457
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:22,420
Wait, so, um, the Z team, my team, their Phoenix program?

1458
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:23,400
That is correct.

1459
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,600
Your own motley crew of dangerous fuck-ups.

1460
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:26,040
Okay.

1461
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,480
We're not looking for miracles, but we'd love one if we
could get it.

1462
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,280
Can you show him his desk?

1463
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:33,740
So why are you giving me the newbie?

team yet we're good how many do you have Look, we'd like to
start slow.

1470
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:14,040
Most people don't make it past the first dispatch.

1471
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,880
And this is better for everybody's safety.

1472
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,280
What do you mean, safety?

1473
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,580
You'll be fine.

1474
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,500
And this here is our little slice of the Southland.

1475
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,200
Whenever there's a crisis in the area, we get a call and
guess who answers.

1476
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:25,840
Me?

1477
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,520
Me?

1478
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:27,220
Exactly.

1479
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,780
Now put your headset on and introduce yourself to these
pricks.

1480
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:30,320
Okay.

1481
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,020
Moshi moshi.

1482
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:33,780
Konnichiwarch.

1483
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:34,760
Hey, team.

1484
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,400
This is your dispatcher, Robert Robertson.

1485
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,780
I am starting my first shift.

1486
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,780
Don't make fun.

1487
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,600
Tell me that's not your real first day.

1488
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,000
You can't be the sugar on your first day.

1489
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:48,400
Come on.

1490
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:49,420
Robert.

1491
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,320
Can we clear the channel, please?

1492
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,040
There's a lot of overlapping on this.

1493
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,380
I saw him in his underwear.

1494
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:55,900
Who?

1495
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,720
Roberto, Roberto, son?

1496
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,260
They're so mean.

1497
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,040
I saw him in his underwear.

1498
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,240
It was not his underwear.

1499
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,480
I was wearing pants.

1500
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,400
Again, please clear the channel.

1501
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,040
I get it.

1502
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,700
Your email.

1503
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,440
Shut the fuck up.

1504
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,340
Let me remind you, these calls are fucking recorded for
training fucking purposes.

1505
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:16,640
Oh.

1506
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:21,820
So keep the fucking line clear before we send your stupid
fucking asses back to whatever fucking cell we pulled your

1507
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,220
stupid fucking asses out of.

1508
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:23,820
Alright?

1509
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,980
That would make me cry, I think, if someone talked to me
like that.

1510
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:27,320
Oh!

1511
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,540
Our first emergency!

1512
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:29,720
Peep, peep, peep!

1513
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,560
Our balloon is stuck in a tree.

1514
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,780
Can you send someone?

1515
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:33,620
Okay.

1516
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:39,340
We gotta send someone to climb a 40-foot-tall tree, and we
don't make the child cry.

1517
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,300
Maybe Coupé.

1518
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,800
Oh, wait, she has, like, the least charisma out of
everybody.

1519
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,820
This guy can fly.

1520
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,260
He should be fine.

1521
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:02,860
Sonar?

1522
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,560
Said Gollum.

1523
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,640
I thought about it.

1524
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,640
about it.

1525
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,640
We'll try this one.

1526
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:12,960
Yeah.

1527
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,960
Everybody loves bats.

1528
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,120
It's not that scary looking.

1529
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,660
Do you ever feel like you had so much potential and you're
being wasted?

1530
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,540
Oh, it does sound like moist critical.

1531
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,260
I don't.

1532
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,660
He didn't even try.

1533
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,260
He didn't even try to do a voice.

1534
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,180
It's just him.

1535
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:32,200
You weren't a genius.

1536
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,460
Literally, he has a certificate.

1537
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,980
You aren't a genius if you need a piece of paper for a very
important event.

1538
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:38,540
You're just jealous.

1539
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,740
This guy rules.

1540
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:44,020

1545
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:44,550
kind of randomly turns into a monster sometimes randomly we
are are working on controlling it.

1546
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:49,050
His intellect swaps with combat and his charisma swaps with
vigor until the next call.

1547
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:52,150
Whoa, this is cool.

1548
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:54,090

01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:01,050
The cray-cray bidet?

1551
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:04,310
Fix the caller's malfunctioning bidet?

1552
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:05,910
I'm hacking the bidet?

1553
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:06,950
Okay.

1554
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:08,170
Wait, what?

1555
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:10,750
Why am I doing that?

1556
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:12,610
Why?

1557
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:15,470
Why am I doing this?

1558
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:22,210
Let's see if I can do this.

1559
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:24,010
Fix,

1560
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:27,310

1561
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:28,810
Okay.

1563
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:31,570
I'm hacking.

1564
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:34,270
Oh, wait.

1565
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:35,030
Wait.

1566
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:37,770
Oh, never mind.

1567
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:38,670
I meant to do that.

1568
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:46,880
Uh, oh, that's right.

1569
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,460
She has unlimited hacks on.

1570
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:51,500
No, I turned that off.

1571
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,780
I said negative.

1572
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,500
I don't...

1573
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:56,160
Become the bidet.

1574
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:05,860
Best part about Charlie being the VA is people haven't made
a bunch of sonar animations using audio from his YouTube

1575
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,440
videos.

1576
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:08,380
Oh, his name is Charlie.

1577
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,360
Which critical, right?

1578
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,300
Hacking to the bidet.

1579
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:15,300
Okay.

1580
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,740
Some hacks just aren't timed.

1581
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,240
Oh, okay.

1582
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:25,100
That's probably because I'm still, like, in technical, like,
what's the word?

1583
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:25,660
Tutorial.

1584
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,700
Like, just a little bit of a tutorial, probably.

1585
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,240
Oh, see, see, see?

1586
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,280
Oh, yeah.

01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,860
What's this guy even famous for?

1588
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,480
Seemed like a loser to me.

1589
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,720
Well, have all you want.

1590
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,640
Someday, my subconscious will live on in a chip.

1591
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,960
In your subconscious, you'll be dead.

1592
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:43,880
At the crypto club.

1593
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,160
Wait, what's this?

1594
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:45,700
Where's the chip?

1595
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:58,360

piece so probably mobility right oh coupe okay she got this

guess someday you're off route wait what's this oh she's

1606
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:55,230

1607
01:43:55,230 --> 01:44:06,830
little mischief maker oh that was close wasn't it that was
uh competent oh fire at a local park has gotten out of

1608
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:15,490
control did you start that fire no the fire that's burning
two blocks from where you're standing you didn't start that

uh flambé stop walking around i've got enough problems

1610
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:26,870

1611
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:29,490
Yeah, because...

1612
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:30,630
But they're not quick.

1613
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:32,410
Maybe not him.

1614
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:34,230
I think maybe her.

1615
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:35,770
But she...

1616
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:38,590
I think she can handle her own.

1617
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:40,770
I think quicker is better than durable.

1618
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:43,830
Still on the clock.

1619
01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:47,030
Oh, Loan Wolf.

completion time.

1629
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:10,690
And Gollum is Young Gravy.

1630

01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:56,340
Museum robbery.

Security system has been taken over by robbers.

1654
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:01,080

Our prism to the rescue.

1673
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,820
The fucker said I was pregnant.

1674
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:50,440

1675
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:50,820

Wait, what's happening here?

1678
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:56,420
The fire is out of control.

1679
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,380
How should we stop it?

1680
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:58,920
Use your body!

1681
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:04,260
I should have sent Flambé, huh?

1682
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,820
Just hose it?

1683
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:06,800
With water?

1684
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,620
Why did you call him, why did he call you pregnant?

1685
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,000
Like, why would you do that?

1686
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,020
Blaze contained.

1687
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,200

Every rank up earns skill points.

1697
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,740
Let's make her faster.

1698
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:39,500
We don't have anyone.

1699
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,420
Well, we could...

1700
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:40,720
Yeah, fast.

1701
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,580
No, I know how to use it.

1702
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:44,780

1717
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:44,380
It's all me.

1718
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:44,900
It's all me.

1719
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,540
I got this.

1720
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,040
Oh, eat.

1721
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:07,700
Okay.

1722
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:11,360
Uh, I don't know if I'm doing this right, but...

1723
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, baby.

1724
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:17,640
Oh, yeah, baby.

1725
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,200
Uh...

1726
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,260
Oh, and down!

1727
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:25,440
Yeah!

1728
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:26,340
Bye, all the people!

1729
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,360
Thank you so much for the tech gift, thank you!

1730
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:29,280
I hacked!

1731
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,540
and I cracked.

1732
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:38,140
Oh, let's see how this went.

1733
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,480
We educated.

1734
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:41,640
Oh.

1735
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,000
Okay, we're fine.

1736
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,560
I think that went pretty well.

1737
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,100
Proved?

1738
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:49,060
Wrong.

1739
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,380
And let's see what we have here.

1740
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,100
I've encountered these thieves before.

1741
01:50:55,900 --> 01:51:02,260
I've encountered these thieves over at compile and
cross-reference Past cases of art crime ring.

1742
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,160
Track down.

1743
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,240
Okay, so we need someone smart.

1744
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:09,700
Coupé.

1745
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,060
Swift as the knife.

1746
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:12,560
Sharp as my knife.

1747
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:16,480
On calls with plus two or yeah, two more than two slots.

1748
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:20,360
Coupé gains one combat if placed in the first slot and
mobility if in the second.

1749
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:20,820
Cool.

1750
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:22,860
Yeah, I will upgrade.

1751
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:23,540
I will upgrade.

1752
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,740
I see that there's this the taps here.

1753
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:26,980
Um.

1754
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:40,990
track down maybe like this one because then tracking is like
mobility right so dispatch your confidence robert as always

1755
01:51:40,990 --> 01:52:00,630
is deeply appreciated let's see we have um make him strong
maybe make him make him stronger or wait doesn't it like

1756
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,050
what was his power when he's oh mega bad

1757
01:52:06,090 --> 01:52:07,890
Oh, it's only when he's normal.

1758
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:15,590
Oh, wait.

1759
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:16,150
What's that one?

1760
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:16,910
Mobility.

1761
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,230
Yeah, he flips stats.

1762
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:24,010
So if I...

1763
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:25,430
Oh, okay.

1764
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:26,870
So if I...

1765
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,890
What is it?

1766
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,700
So his intelligence becomes combat.

1767
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,540
Is that what it is?

1768
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,000
So he needs more intelligence.

1769
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,800
Which will make him stronger.

1770
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:40,680
when it flips.

1771
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,440
Int Charisma.

1772
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,700
Int Combat Charisma Vigor.

1773
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:51,520
Okay, thank you, thank you.

1774
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,480
Okay, we'll do that then.

1775
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:59,660
And someone else upgraded too.

1776
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:00,500
Oh, you.

1777
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:00,860
Prism.

1778
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,040
Let's make you...

1779
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:10,980
Hmm...

1780
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:12,540
Hmm...

1781
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:27,240
more charismatic what if I just max everybody out in the
thing that they're the thing that they have highest yes yes

1785
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:05,680
is it cool if I go I've been wanting to pitch him some stuff
I've been working on how long do I have to keep working for

1786
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:22,680
oh let's see for you coupe I want to make you faster
actually wait yeah faster actually it's smarter she's pretty

1787
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:33,680
smart she's already pretty fast nine to five for some
situations you can only choose one solution wait what do you

1788
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:43,300
mean by that literally oh send literally anyone else Okay.

1789
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:45,140
I'm a high-ranking Vanderstanker.

1790
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,740
It would mean a lot.

1791
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:47,900
Wait, I don't get it.

1792
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:51,160
Let Sonar meet his hero, Willem Vanderstank.

1793
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:55,620
Once you dispatch a hero, the other option will disappear.

1794
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:55,920
Okay.

1795
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:57,700
Wait, what?

1796
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:58,040
Sure.

1797
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,160
Go ahead.

1798
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,160
Thanks, man.

1799
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,960
You will not regret this.

1800
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:03,020
I think I'm gonna regret it.

1801
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:03,440
Uh-oh.

1802
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,980
I didn't think I would.

1803
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:06,720
Yeah, exactly.

1804
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,820
A kid just robbed me.

1805
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,840
Track down the pickpocket and bring him home.

1806
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:12,560
Encourage him to turn his life around.

1807
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:14,260
Let's see.

1808
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,240
Track him down, huh?

1809
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,380
We need a smooth talker.

1810
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:29,300
I mean, Prism is pretty smooth talking, but she's not going
to be able to... She's not very fast.

1811
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:31,860
I think Gollum would do a really good job.

1812
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,960
He'd be like, Don't be stupid.

1813
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:37,600
Malevolat!

1814
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:41,990
Why not?

1815
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:42,370
You know what?

1816
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:43,130
I don't think I've sent...

1817
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:44,770
I haven't sent her so much out.

1818
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:46,030
Oh, I think.

1819
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:48,490
Well, the best teacher is Fia.

1820
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:49,830
Oh, wait a minute.

1821
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:50,670
All right, all right, I'll snitch.

1822
01:55:50,930 --> 01:55:52,030
Just come here, deal, okay?

1823
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:53,470
Squid.

1824
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:55,670
Hideout is well guarded.

1825
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:56,710
Oh, locate stolen art.

1826
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:59,330
Stealth and use of surroundings will be key.

1827
01:55:59,470 --> 01:56:00,210
Okay, stealth.

1828
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:01,910
We need them visit gal.

1829
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:03,310
Sure, your call.

1830
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:04,110
Oh, my God.

1831
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:05,170
Wait, this is awesome.

1832
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:05,790
Look at them.

1833
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:06,970
They are the dream team.

1834
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:11,810
Oh, wait.

1835
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:21,110
just guessing oh whoever's on fight okay wait we need a
coupé there and then i'm busy out there okay i see it i see

1836
01:56:21,110 --> 01:56:27,050
ah so she is the action okay like we got this i only travel
through alleyways and shadowy underpasses what's going on

1837
01:56:27,050 --> 01:56:36,430
here how long was the last dispatcher here two days how the
did that happen nice yeah nice the nerves are hitting sonar

1838
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:47,190
and he's second guessing his human meat alternative pitch
relatable yeah make it relatable make it relatable you know

1839
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:47,470
Yeah.

1840
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,910
About human me.

1841
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:50,230
I've got a great story.

1842
01:56:52,490 --> 01:56:52,850
Oh yeah.

1843
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:54,750
Did it work?

1844
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,110
Oh my god, it worked!

1845
01:57:00,110 --> 01:57:01,310
Cannibalism mentioned!

1846
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:07,270
Insane.

1847
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:08,750
Insane behavior.

1848
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:09,730
It worked.

1849
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:13,570
Half man, half bat, all freak.

1850
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:14,710
Hey!

1851
01:57:15,810 --> 01:57:18,170
I don't know if I want to welcome you here yet.

1852
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:20,190
Oh, our shift is almost over.

1853
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:21,890
Uh-oh, wait, both are disrupted.

1854
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:23,950
There's a lot of thieves in this hideout.

1855
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:25,190
How should the team approach?

1856
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:30,390
Get the paintings out quietly.

1857
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:32,250
Take down the thieves, not the art.

1858
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:34,170
We could do both.

1859
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:35,730
We have a lot of combat.

1860
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:37,830
What?

1861
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:41,690
Oh, freak.

1862
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:45,530
Half ghost.

1863
01:57:45,950 --> 01:57:46,550
Half made.

1864
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:47,630
Oh, freak.

1865
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:49,270
Wait a second.

1866
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:50,190
Google, oh my gosh.

1867
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:52,310
I just said that and then you posted it.

1868
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:55,110
I said it and then you sent that.

1869
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:56,450
How

1870
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:04,880
did you know that?

1871
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:05,520
How did you know?

1872
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:06,960
I thought you read that.

1873
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,140
No, I said that with my own brain.

1874
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:11,740
The timing was crazy.

1875
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:14,940
All right, all right.

1876
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:18,020
What do they mean?

1877
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,560
We're just locating the stolen art.

1878
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,300
It doesn't say to get the stolen art.

1879
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,360
Take down the thieves.

1880
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,780
All right, take down the thieves, not the art.

1881
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,560
I cannot make any promises.

1882
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:31,740
Kill them.

1883
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:32,900
Oh, nice.

1884
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,700
With an exception, character portraits are auto-win.

1885
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:36,440
Oh.

1886
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:37,920
Cool.

1887
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,420
And what's going on here?

1888
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:43,440
They caught the kid, but have no idea what to do with a
12-year-old thief.

1889
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,940
Scared the kid straight.

1890
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:47,140
Scared the kid straight.

1891
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,260
That should teach him a lesson.

1892
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:48,860
Yeah.

1893
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:51,020
We all share a brain cell.

1894
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,580
Obviously, my favorite part of the job.

1895
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,300
Killing it.

1896
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,640
Killing it.

1897
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:56,320
Killing it.

Another Envisagal?

01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:10,720
So I'm guessing the more I go on in the game, I get new
people in my party.

1901
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,980
Is that how this is?

1902
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,660
Why would people quit this job?

1903
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:15,960
This is like so easy.

1904
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,900

1914
02:00:35,570 --> 02:00:36,810

Ugh.

1969
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:42,160
Wow, you're making me play the game?

1970
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:43,320

1971
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:48,380
I'm here for the movie, man.

1972
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:49,280
Come on.

1973
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,440
No one actually wants to play a game.

1974
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,720
Why does a donut shop even need extra security?

1975
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,960
Because it's all front.

1976
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:00,920
Breaking bad.

1977
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:01,400
Hello?

1978
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:02,300
Ugh.

1979
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,440
This node has an unknown code.

1980
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:06,220
Find the key.

1981
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,880
Oh, they...

1982
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:16,300
Freaking bad.

1983
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:18,680
This node represents a code to use later.

1984
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:19,000
Oh!

1985
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,360
Up, down, left, left.

1986
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,400
Up, down, left, left.

1987
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:24,900
Nice.

1988
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,240
Oh, there it is.

1989
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:28,680
And...

1990
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:33,560
I am the hacker.

1991
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,440
I am the one who knocks.

1992
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:37,860
B&E?

1993
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:39,300
Who are you, Lieutenant Dan?

1994
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:40,780
Hey, shut up for a sec.

1995
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:41,460
You're not alone.

1996
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:43,820
Uh-oh.

1997
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:45,940
Uh-oh.

1998
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,060
Wait, how'd they know that word?

1999
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,020
He's coming your way, armed.

2000
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:50,080
You need to disappear.

2001
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:51,820
Why are you whispering, you idiot?

2002
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:53,020
You're in my ear.

2003
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:53,640
No, no!

2004
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:59,080
I am the one who hacks.

2005
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:02,220
We need to bake, Robert.

2006
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:05,000
Eat this!

2007
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,300
Wow!

2008
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,860
Oh, it's pointing right at Grammy though.

2009
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,480
Damn it, this bitch is a gusher.

2010
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:13,300
Be careful.

2011
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:15,700
I got this, Lieutenant Dan.

2012
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:16,440
Never mind.

2013
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:19,520
Oh, yeah.

2014
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:20,180
Yeah.

2015
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:23,280
Wait, he's glowing?

2016
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:24,320
Can you more great advice?

2017
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,460
I've noticed, like, the people with powers glow sometimes.

2018
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:28,040
Oh!

2019
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:28,360
Oh!

2020
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,040
I didn't even notice that was a QTE.

2021
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:36,900
I was watching the movie.

2022
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:37,620
Shit.

2023
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:46,900
When do I get to be part of the action?

2024
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:52,980
That's it, now.

2025
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,600
Invisible, bitch.

2026
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:56,380
He knows my name!

2027
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:57,040
Mizzigo!

2028
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:59,220
Just hold him off while he find a way to help.

2029
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:02,980
Uh, sprinkler system.

2030
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,980
I can use the overhead sprinklers to short out his blaster.

2031
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,980
But he still has fists.

2032
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:11,140
Come on, come on, come on.

2033
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,200
Oh, shoot.

2034
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:15,900
Got him.

2035
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:18,340
Wait, wait.

2036
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,380
Oh, wait.

2037
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:21,980
Oh, my bad.

2038
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,320
Uh, left, left up.

2039
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:27,700
Wait, is that?

2040
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:28,600
Eh?

2041
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:31,740
But this one has more.

2042
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:32,920
Right?

2043
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:34,040
Oh, my God.

2044
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:34,600
Ah.

2045
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:35,880
Eh?

2046
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,660
Wait, this is...

2047
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:44,580
Part one.

2048
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:45,320
Oh, oh, my bad.

2049
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:47,740
Part one was... wait.

2050
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,200
Up, down, left, what was it?

2051
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,740
Up, down, left, right?

2052
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:01,200
Up, down, left, up, up, oh!

2053
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:02,120
Look at me!

2054
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:03,400
I'm too good.

2055
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:04,920
And down.

2056
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:10,140
Thanks for watching.

2057
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:16,780
Yeah, stupid!

2058
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:18,480
Punch him!

2059
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:19,620
Or kick him!

2060
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:20,260
Punch him!

2061
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:20,740
Don't miss!

2062
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:21,620
Punch him!

2063
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,100
I don't think going invisible makes you...

2064
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:28,800
This is where he can't hold you, right?

2065
02:07:44,810 --> 02:07:45,250
Granny!

2066
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:48,190
I don't think you know how to use that thing, so why don't
you...

2067
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:49,450
Shut the fuck up!

2068
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:50,910
Oh, I'm one of the good guys!

2069
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:51,550
You?

2070
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:52,590
Yeah, right.

2071
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:54,250
Don't fuck with me, okay?

2072
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:56,210
Nobody fucks, Granny!

2073
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:56,770
Oh.

2074
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:58,030
Nobody fucks with Granny!

2075
02:07:58,630 --> 02:08:00,230
Invite the gal, stay calm.

2076
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:02,650
Great fucking advice, Lieutenant Dan.

2077
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:05,090
Uh, disarmed Granny, I think.

2078
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:07,270
I think Granny is the more, uh...

2079
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:07,530
Okay.

2080
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:10,130
Disarmed Granny before the thing closes.

2081
02:08:10,130 --> 02:08:14,250
Yeah, I think, uh, I think Granny needs to be disarmed
because they're the war wild card.

2082
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:15,730
Fuck that.

2083
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:25,950
She didn't even listen to me.

2084
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:30,670
Oh!

2085
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:33,250
Hey, Invisigal, are you okay?

2086
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:35,390
Hey, are you okay?

2087
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:37,030
Come in.

2088
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:37,510
I'm fine.

2089
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:40,930
But this guy...

2090
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:42,250
Holy the arm!

2091
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:42,870
Uh-oh.

2092
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:46,250
Ew.

2093
02:08:46,490 --> 02:08:48,130
Yeah, but it's also kind of not bad.

2094
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:48,750
Yeah, great.

2095
02:08:48,890 --> 02:08:49,750
Okay, where's the perp?

2096
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:52,490
Uh, escaped.

2097
02:08:58,370 --> 02:08:59,930
Jesus Christ, you gotta be fucking with me.

2098
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:00,590
You're kidding me.

2099
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:02,170
Invisor gal.

2100
02:09:03,230 --> 02:09:04,090
Invisor gal.

2101
02:09:04,610 --> 02:09:05,790
Oh my god.

2102
02:09:05,850 --> 02:09:08,070
That was pretty good for a first day.

2103
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:11,590
Sometimes people, you know, get electrical burns.

2104
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:13,390
She disobeyed a direct order.

2105
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:13,930
Yeah, she did.

2106
02:09:14,030 --> 02:09:14,730
Well, that's the problem.

2107
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:16,930
This isn't the army and these ain't soldiers.

2108
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:18,330
They're fucking super villains.

2109
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:20,590
Huh.

2110
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:22,170
Oh.

2111
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,830
Look, why don't you take a breather?

2112
02:09:23,990 --> 02:09:25,510
We can debrief with Blazer in a bit.

2113
02:09:26,570 --> 02:09:26,870
Here.

2114
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:28,830
There's vending machines in the break room.

2115
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:29,930
You look like you could.

2116
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:33,330

02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:16,720
Who do we want to give it to?

2123
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,640
We need some...

2124
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:20,060
We could...

2125
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:21,940
It's free.

2126
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:24,960
Gollum?

2127
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,740
He's so cute.

2128
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:28,480
Yeah.

2129
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:29,840
I want to give him the world.

2130
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:35,600
Completed his team shift without missing or failing a call.

2131
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:36,960
That was me.

2132
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:39,600
That's the thing I... That's the achievement.

2133
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:41,460
and I just received the S&D-D.

2134
02:10:45,890 --> 02:10:46,370
Gaw.

2135
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:47,910
Already mad.

2136
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,200
What did he just do?

2137
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,700
Why did he do that to make him...

2138
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:56,180
Wait, why did he get jumpy?

2139
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:02,380
Ew.

2140
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:05,660
What kind of superhero flinches?

2141
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:07,480
Oh, it's sonar.

2142
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:09,960
I didn't say which superhero.

2143
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:10,520
Chill out.

2144
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:13,500
Both of my Twinkies.

2145
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,980
The last 15 years, you'd be jumpy too.

2146
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,820
What makes you think my life has been any different?

2147
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:21,820
You think growing up surrounded by a bunch of shipbag
villains?

2148
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:22,960
I didn't need to watch my back.

2149
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:23,780
You need better friends.

2150
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,300
Yeah, well, I guess you should do a better job picking your
friends.

2151
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:27,660
What the fuck?

2152
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:29,260
You can't just go around.

2153
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:29,640
Ow!

2154
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:31,240
Why is he keep screaming?

2155
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:32,440
His name's Sonar.

2156
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:33,880
Yeah, I know what Sonar means.

2157
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:35,160
What's up?

2158
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:37,140
Then why are you asking why he keeps screaming?

2159
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:39,360
She was just explaining your, um...

2160
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:39,780
You know what?

2161
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:40,460
Never mind.

2162
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:41,300
Good shift.

2163
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:42,600
This guy is weird.

2164
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:43,880
Yeah, he is.

2165
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:46,620
Look, I actually just came by to celebrate the mission going
well.

2166
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:53,740
Didn't mean to interrupt your little snack What do you need
to preach you like a little baby bird bitch you ignore my

2167
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:56,460
order to disobey a direct order How can you think it went
well?

2168
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:02,580
Yeah, you trashed the place the suspect got away and you got
the client hurt I don't think when he called us thought he'd

2169
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:08,160
be ending the day winking at lefty because you turned his
other arm into a pork Grind granny would be fine if granny

2170
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:14,080
didn't pick that fucking thing up in the first place the
storks Dumbass trying to be a hero and don't fucking say it

2171
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:20,960
Storks poster We could have had an outcome where the client
doesn't get cried and we get the perp if you had just

2172
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:27,260
fucking listened to me Dude, you ask for help then I can See
grinding coffee beans.

2173
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:27,960
Oh my god.

2174
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:33,660
He really is I make the calls not you Why does my game
sometimes flicker?

2175
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:34,380
Are we gonna say no?

2176
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:35,200
Or is it this one?

2177
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,700
You're no hero.

2178
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:42,280
You were a nerd playing a video game in a suit your daddy
built Now you're a twitchy little bitch turtle without a

2179
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:48,400
shelf a real hero puts their ass on the line a real hero
can't just press a button make their problems disappear.

2180
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:50,100
Let me make this clear.

2181
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:52,160
You're not half the hero that I am.

2182
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:53,020
Yeah, you tell.

2183
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:58,000
Based on what I saw today, you wouldn't last a day as
Mechamander.

2184
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:03,180
Because there isn't a Mech suit in the universe that will
keep you from being a selfish fucking asshole.

2185
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:05,240
Oh, get her.

2186
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:07,960
Yeah.

2187
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:09,260
Yeah.

2188
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:11,400
She needs an attitude check.

2189
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:14,340
Yeah.

2190
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:15,720
Oh.

2191
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:17,320
Good.

2192
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:18,720
Fuck you.

2193
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:23,140
Oh my god.

2194
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,520
We're back on the ground.

2195
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:27,580
You're gonna eat those twinks?

2196
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:30,220
That's not what they're... you know what?

2197
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:31,580
Help yourself.

2198
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:37,800
You're gonna eat those twinks disobeyed by Invisible gal.

2199
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:40,500
Here we go.

2200
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,780
You have a tissue hanging from your nose, Robert.

2201
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:45,040
That's what that's the achievement I got.

2202
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:46,780
I was trying to ignore it, but that became impossible.

2203
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:47,780
The air's dry.

2204
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:48,880
Soaking in blood.

2205
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:51,540
Uh, I get nosebleeds when it's this dry.

2206
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:52,740
And the air.

2207
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:53,800
And the office.

2208
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:56,400
It's, uh, it's on the dry side.

2209
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:57,760
Is it on the dry side?

2210
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:58,260
I have to check.

2211
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:58,300
Still bad.

2212
02:13:58,300 --> 02:14:00,000
I'll have facilities look into it.

2213
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:02,380
All right, boys.

2214
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:04,520
We're here to assess Robert's first shift.

2215
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,980
And aside from whatever happened here, I thought it was
pretty good.

2216
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:10,400
Yeah, I think it was great.

2217
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:12,140
I was watching on the monitor.

2218
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:13,800
The work you did dispatching.

2219
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,600
I don't think the Z team has ever had a better shift than
that.

2220
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:17,620
Oh, man.

2221
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:21,540
If I did poorly, would she fire me?

2222
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:23,720
Yeah, no, the granny's situation.

2223
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:25,920
Changing B-Sync might fix the flickering issue.

2224
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:26,640
Oh, I see.

2225
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:29,140
Let's be real.

2226
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:30,380
She ain't gonna make it.

2227
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:31,960
She's difficult to work with.

2228
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,420
But I see a lot of friends.

2229
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:34,080
We can buy her.

2230
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:36,380
Oh, thank you for the Rita Ray.

2231
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,160
Hello, Raiders.

2232
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:39,600
Oh, uh.

2233
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:40,960
I should have done better.

2234
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:41,960
Oh, sorry.

2235
02:14:42,280 --> 02:14:42,700
I was looking.

2236
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:43,200
Oh, my gosh.

2237
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:43,520
Sorry.

2238
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:45,560
I can't look away with the quick time.

2239
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:46,120
With her.

2240
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:54,700
zero wires okay she crossed them for you look robert you
should be proud the bar is very low with this group well

2241
02:14:54,700 --> 02:15:01,840
it's not low for me look thank you guys for the gift thank
you so much as much as the next person but when it comes to

2242
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:09,240

survive the bar needs to go up and how would we do that by

2243
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:15,080
treating the z team like what they are a bunch of villains
and leading a super villain team takes a different approach

2244
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:22,520
than a superhero team i need to be around interesting i need
them to see i'm all in and they need to match that energy

2245
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:30,740
the only kind i know and based on what i've seen the only
version they'll respond to i'm not saying everyone will make

2246
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:38,280
it they won't i'm not saying i won't get spicy spicy but
when it does i also need you to trust me to handle it i

2247
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:45,400
don't want you stepping in they need to respect me even if i
don't have powers Yeah.

2248
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:47,820
That's so true though.

2249
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:49,260
We'll do it your way.

2250
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:55,480
Villains are like so like, you gotta earn the respect.

2251
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:58,320
Yeah.

2252
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:01,440
No fucking way is gonna work, but it'll be way more fun to
watch.

2253
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:03,500
Chase, some optimism please.

2254
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,480
God damn it.

2255
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,340
Yeah, I also promised to do my best.

2256
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,860
I still hate his shirt though.

2257
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,340

2258
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:13,320

2260
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:16,620
No, no, no, no, I didn't did this.

2261
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:20,740
It's weird because, yeah, I saw this lady, smiling lady.

2262
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:23,820

No worries.

2358
02:23:34,970 --> 02:23:35,690
I'm pretty strong.

2359
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:37,090
That's not what I'm saying.

2360
02:23:37,810 --> 02:23:39,710
How you got this thing inside your apartment anyways?

2361
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:41,210
Super heavy, the bugger.

2362
02:23:41,330 --> 02:23:43,590
I disassembled it and took it in little pieces.

2363
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:43,970
Whoa.

2364
02:23:43,970 --> 02:23:45,370

02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:46,850
And how long that take you?

2366
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:47,830
A long time.

2367
02:23:48,350 --> 02:23:49,470
No, it was four days.

2368
02:23:49,630 --> 02:23:50,890
I get 20 minutes.

2369
02:23:52,850 --> 02:23:55,630
Wait, but he always would have to disassemble it and bring
it in there?

2370
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:57,010
It is, you know.

2371
02:23:57,770 --> 02:23:59,790
This guy in his riding apartment.

2372
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:00,850
Holy hell.

2373
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:02,650
He's got nothing in here.

2374
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:05,250
I'm poor.

2375
02:24:05,490 --> 02:24:07,230
Or no one never come over to tell you that.

2376
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:09,270
I'm poor, Royd.

2377
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:10,090
Is that what you want to hear?

2378
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:11,570
Does that make you feel good?

2379
02:24:12,410 --> 02:24:14,170
You're not poor if you can keep this suit going.

2380
02:24:14,590 --> 02:24:16,030
Like, where are you sleep?

2381
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:18,910
We're figuring that out.

2382
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:20,690
You're figuring that out, huh?

2383
02:24:21,350 --> 02:24:21,810
Oh.

2384
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:23,190
Even a beef got a bed.

2385
02:24:23,950 --> 02:24:24,410
Beef.

2386
02:24:24,590 --> 02:24:25,970
This is the type of apartment you see.

2387
02:24:25,970 --> 02:24:28,090
When the detective kicked the door in, you know?

2388
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:29,250
Shine the flashlight.

2389
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:30,530
Serial killer shit.

2390
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:31,950
That's so true, though.

2391
02:24:32,810 --> 02:24:33,450
Serial killer?

2392
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:34,050
Riding.

2393
02:24:34,490 --> 02:24:36,090
Lost in the blast while I was flying.

2394
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:37,390
No clue where I landed.

2395
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:38,050
Uh-oh.

2396
02:24:38,230 --> 02:24:40,770
I spent a couple weeks after it happened trying to track it
down.

2397
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:42,550
They powered a whole suit.

2398
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:45,530
Yeah, it's the only piece of the suit my dad didn't have
schematics for.

2399
02:24:45,750 --> 02:24:45,930
Oh.

2400
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:46,750
That can be a problem?

2401
02:24:47,070 --> 02:24:47,630
Yeah, maybe.

2402
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:49,750
Ah, mine now.

2403
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:50,490
We figure them out.

2404
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:51,590
Ah.

2405
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:52,890
I like growing.

2406
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,950
We know about the Astral Pulse.

2407
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:55,270
We've...

2408
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:55,870
Everybody know about them.

2409
02:24:56,450 --> 02:24:58,470
There's actually two wicked pieces of tech, huh?

2410
02:24:58,770 --> 02:24:59,290
Thank you, Nick.

2411
02:24:59,310 --> 02:25:02,050
First you get the Anthropos, this genius design energy cell.

2412
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:04,210
But inside them, you get the stellar core.

2413
02:25:04,530 --> 02:25:05,030
Can I help?

2414
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:05,790
No, brother.

2415
02:25:06,290 --> 02:25:06,730
You good.

2416
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:07,590
Ow.

2417
02:25:07,770 --> 02:25:08,690
He's got the dog.

2418
02:25:09,010 --> 02:25:12,190
It's when you mix the control fusion reactions with the
plasma containment.

2419
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:13,130
Oh, brother.

2420
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:15,190
You got a core one super crazy energy.

2421
02:25:15,210 --> 02:25:17,130
Carmen looks like the owner eats gunpowder.

2422
02:25:17,550 --> 02:25:19,730
Like you caught one small star and chop them in a bottle.

2423
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:20,790
Genius.

2424
02:25:21,130 --> 02:25:22,190
Can you recreate it?

2425
02:25:22,250 --> 02:25:24,310
So you can just make me a new one, right?

2426
02:25:24,890 --> 02:25:25,950
Which is why it's not a puzzle.

2427
02:25:25,970 --> 02:25:29,490
problem right super awesome but uh we'll be all right

2428
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:35,530
what if what if it's inside brief what if he ate it

2429
02:25:38,910 --> 02:25:45,210
you know what if he's the real super dog long time ago first
time i come mainland oh you can't be trying for steal stuff

2430
02:25:45,210 --> 02:25:52,130
from radio shack then we talk tech stuff for like an whole
hour then he'll take me jail oh that's how i ended up in a

2431
02:25:52,130 --> 02:25:56,450
phoenix program oh is everyone like was everyone a villain
first.

2432
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:58,630
Bombers.

2433
02:26:01,290 --> 02:26:05,170
Guess when you're building Astropulses, there's not much
time for talking to your son.

2434
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:07,870
Not so sure about that.

2435
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:08,850
I don't understand.

2436
02:26:09,170 --> 02:26:11,550
You see, there's gearheads then there's science nerds.

2437
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:13,530
One kind garage, the other kind lab.

2438
02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:14,470
I'm the metal gearhead.

2439
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:14,870
Yeah, yeah.

2440
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:19,350
I'm a good gearhead, but I just can't see how he'll make
something like the pulse.

2441
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:20,790
He knows science nerd.

2442
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:22,870
How would you know this from talking to him once?

2443
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:24,690
Because I'm both.

2444
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:25,810
Ah.

2445
02:26:25,970 --> 02:26:26,610
True.

2446
02:26:27,070 --> 02:26:28,490
I'm the one going to fix your suit.

2447
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:31,810
Whoa!

2448
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:38,360
The lab.

2449
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:39,760
That one over there.

2450
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:41,040
That's your father's suit.

2451
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:44,520
Oh my god, he put the glasses on.

2452
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:46,280
He's in super nerd mode.

2453
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:50,460
This is incredible, Roy.

2454
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:51,120
Wow.

2455
02:26:58,030 --> 02:26:59,570
I hope you like it, brother.

2456
02:27:00,410 --> 02:27:02,070
Roy, I don't know what to say.

2457
02:27:02,610 --> 02:27:03,050

Did you did that on purpose?

2463
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:41,640
Wait, is we can bring our dog to work?

2464

2468
02:27:53,810 --> 02:27:55,410
Hey, Chase, I need a favor.

2469
02:27:57,350 --> 02:28:00,870
It's not enough of a favor getting you this job working with
those stupid ass pieces of...

2470
02:28:00,870 --> 02:28:01,070
Oh!

2471
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:02,530
Shit, huh?

2472
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:04,350
Who's the little guy?

2473
02:28:04,650 --> 02:28:05,650
His name's beef.

leaving him at home but i don't want anything happening to

2478
02:28:36,190 --> 02:28:45,050

other day with phenomenon man why did he choose such a

2479
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:52,670

2481
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:07,290
impulsive but maybe it was a long time coming hope I didn't
contribute I didn't contribute to anything.

2482
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:09,330
Oh, why would you have contributed to?

2483
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:10,550
Yes, that means I didn't.

2484
02:29:10,570 --> 02:29:11,890
Such a terrible thing to say.

2485
02:29:11,910 --> 02:29:12,810
Which is what I was hoping for.

2486
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:13,890
It is what it is.

2487
02:29:15,250 --> 02:29:17,490
But that's actually not what I wanted to talk to you about.

2488
02:29:18,130 --> 02:29:18,310
Yeah?

2489
02:29:18,310 --> 02:29:22,330
I was thinking about it over the weekend, and I'm going to
cut someone from the Z team.

2490
02:29:23,230 --> 02:29:23,650
Or you are.

2491
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:24,810
Wait, why?

2492
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:27,450
Maybe I'm just looking to shake things up all over the
place.

2493
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:28,350
Oh.

2494
02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:29,690
I need a sense of urgency.

2495
02:29:29,830 --> 02:29:30,550
You sure about that?

2496
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:31,570
You sure about that?

2497
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:33,210
Wait, but my team!

I'm sure now.

2499
02:29:34,470 --> 02:29:35,870
Well, what if it's somebody that I gave them?

2500
02:29:35,890 --> 02:29:43,250
points to how it'll play out what the reality is cutting
someone towards the bottom of the leaderboards will show

2501
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:53,030

the building?

02:30:23,830 --> 02:30:25,730
Could you send a locksmith downstairs?

2510

Body parts.

2524
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:49,480
Remove giant monster remains from the beach.

2525
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:53,020
So we need someone physically fit.

2526
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:54,840
Large media.

2527
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:56,380
I think we got ascending Gollum.

2528
02:31:57,220 --> 02:31:58,020
I think Gollum's our guide.

2529
02:31:58,580 --> 02:31:59,240
Look different.

2530
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:02,340
Oh, on a call with more than two slots.

2531
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:06,640
Certain slots may grant plus two to a stat and minus one to
others when Gollum is assigned.

2532
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:07,940
Oh, what does that mean?

2533
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:08,920
Oh, hey.

02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,820
Oh, wait, I didn't press that.

2535
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:12,140
Wait.

2536
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:13,060
No.

2537
02:32:13,980 --> 02:32:14,940
Wait, what do you mean, no?

2538
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:16,920
Huh?

2539
02:32:20,610 --> 02:32:21,950
She just put herself in.

02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:23,150
Wait, what?

2541
02:32:23,230 --> 02:32:23,350
No?

2542
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:30,940
Okay.

2543
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:37,080
What happened?

2544
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:38,300
I didn't know dogs could be so huge!

2545
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:39,960
Um...

2546
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:41,180
Entice it with food!

2547
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:47,660
Yes?

2548
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:49,580
Yeah!

2549
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,840
Hero saves.

2550
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:59,960
good job it's strategic wait why is she returning uh-huh you
know this is uh really immature what's happening serves them

2551
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:09,960
right you let your guard down you perish that's a pretty
fucked way to live emphasis on live oh my god you do realize

2552
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:23,040
that sabotaging each other isn't going to guarantee you a
spot on the team oh that's never punished punished.

2553
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:24,660
Holy cow.

2554
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:26,920
Let's see.

2555
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,800
Let's give you...

2556
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,400
That was close.

2557
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:31,820
That was so scary.

2558
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:34,560
Let's give you...

2559
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:38,480
More...

2560
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:39,160
combat.

2561
02:33:41,020 --> 02:33:43,420
I feel like you should have a high combat.

2562
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:45,620
Maybe he doesn't because he's just mud.

2563
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:47,560
I guess he's a defender, right?

2564
02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:48,700
Versatile.

2565
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:49,920
Hmm.

2566
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:54,860
Riz make him giving me the poor charisma.

2567
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:00,920
We could also lean into the vigor a bit more.

2568
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:03,140
But I find...

2569
02:34:04,180 --> 02:34:04,760
Well...

2570
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:08,080
Hmm.

2571
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:12,760
He might be mud, but he's our bud.

2572
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:14,040
Yeah!

2573
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:17,340
Uh...

2574
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:21,980
I feel like I have a couple other people that are high in
charisma.

2575
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:25,100
We have Prism?

2576
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:26,400
Oh, wait.

2577
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:27,100
Maybe not.

2578
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:29,360
Well, punch-up is pretty high in charisma.

2579
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,100
Let's go with more vigor.

2580
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:39,560
Because I don't think anybody else is as high as him.

2581
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:41,460
Okay.

2582
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:42,940
Oop.

2583
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:46,880
There's a drug deal happening at the airport right now.

2584
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:49,480
I think you should send the bat guy.

2585
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:50,180
The bat?

2586
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:51,180
The bat?

2587
02:34:51,220 --> 02:34:52,180
Why would you say that?

2588
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:54,040
Convincingly pose as a buyer.

2589
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:55,240
Okay.

2590
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,340

Wait, that is kind of sus, isn't it?

2598
02:35:21,450 --> 02:35:23,350
I think he can bring up the dossier.

2599
02:35:23,650 --> 02:35:24,050
Can you?

2600
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:27,190

There was definitely other people.

2604
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:35,550
Assault, arson.

Blit-lit-l-l-p.

2610
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:22,580
So, uh, turtle fans moved in, flipped a grill, started a
fight, and ruined a bunch of hot dogs.

2611
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:23,600
Hot dogs!

2612
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:27,000
Break up a fight, go on the offensive if you have to.

2613
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:29,500
Alright, Flambe, it might be...

2614
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,940

Break up a fight, eh?

Yeah.

2618
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:44,320
Close your eyes.

2619
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:46,660
You're not going to like what you see anyway.

2620
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:48,600
They got this.

2621
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:49,820
They got this for sure.

2622
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:53,800
Wait.

2623
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:55,440
All of these sabotages me, except me.

Why get in the pot in the first place?

2625
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:06,020
She's locked in a sensory deprivation tank.

2626
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:07,200
I'll have to use it again sometime.

2627
02:37:07,220 --> 02:37:08,240
What?

2628
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:11,860
Blast the lid off.

2629
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:14,120
You got this.

2630
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:19,220
It probably will work.

2631
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:21,120
Yeah!

2632
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:25,200

2642
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:14,960
We gotta protect and defend civilians at all costs.

2643
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:16,760
We gotta shut down the deal.

Social security numbers.

2652
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:34,820
They keep selling the blue stuff.

2653
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:36,800
Speak to a victim.

2654
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:38,140
Victim gather intel.

That's your fault for locking that guy in the pod.

2661
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:20,960
We would have been fine if she hadn't locked him in the pod.

2662
02:39:23,060 --> 02:39:23,320
Okay.

2663
02:39:27,140 --> 02:39:28,660

What's happened?

2670
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:45,690
Betrayed by a fellow degenerate.

2671
02:39:45,850 --> 02:39:49,630
Malevolent paid a kid to stalk and visit gal with a spy
camera.

2672
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:50,590
Break the camera.

2673
02:39:50,830 --> 02:39:51,250
I don't know.

2674
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,500
I think it's a pretty good choice.

2675
02:39:58,540 --> 02:39:59,220
Yeah, exactly.

2676
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:00,100
Great.

2677
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:01,940
Now there's camera guts in my sneakers.

2678
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:03,520
What do you...

2679
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:04,660
Why did you leave?

2680
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:07,280
What is actually going on here?

2681
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:13,620
This could be fine.

2682
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:15,560
Oh, guys.

2683

2686
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:49,440
As hot and threatening as that sounds.

2687
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,920
I'm not going anywhere.

2688
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:52,640
We're tied for the bottom.

2689
02:40:53,320 --> 02:40:54,900
With fucking invisigal.

2690
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:56,180
Not for long.

2691
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:57,460
Oh.

2692
02:40:58,020 --> 02:41:00,360
Okay, they're forcing me.

2693
02:41:01,340 --> 02:41:03,920
I sent out the same damn couple earlier.

2694
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:05,500
Here, again.

2695
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:09,760
Sonar pushed me in the pool during the water aerobics class.

2696
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:16,780
Why are you going to an aerobics class on the same- Don't
promise a man, Boots.

2697
02:41:16,960 --> 02:41:18,220
They refuse to let me leave.

2698
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:23,680
Describe your diarrhea.

2699
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:25,500
Oh, they...

2700
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:25,920
Oh, okay.

2701
02:41:26,020 --> 02:41:27,680
There was a class and he pushed her in.

2702
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:29,900
And now they're like, Hey, we won't let you go home.

2703
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:42,940
What happened?

2704
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:44,700
What is...

2705
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:45,540
She's fine.

2706
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:46,820
What is going on?

2707
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:50,460
Walked into my sword with her face a little bit.

2708
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:51,100
And now he...

2709
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:52,300
I don't believe in punching women.

2710
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:53,940
What's happening?

2711
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:56,180
Yeah, try it.

2712
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:59,340
Just play the loud sound of deaf and sonar.

2713
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:04,440
Plug your ears?

2714
02:42:04,700 --> 02:42:05,360
I don't know.

2715
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:06,760
Just...

2716
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:09,080
Can he even do that?

2717
02:42:09,140 --> 02:42:10,380
His ears are so big.

2718
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:12,000
Uh-oh.

2719
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:15,280
Injured.

2720
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:17,900
This is so bad.

2721
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:19,960
Did you at least do the job?

2722
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:23,320
Changes, but I...

2723
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:28,640
Maybe if you weren't so busy fucking around with each other.

2724
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:31,380
My gotcha rate is like in the toilet right now.

2725
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:34,560
The mascot Inquisition.

2726
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,640
I cannot outrun them forever.

2727
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:39,180
Catch up and protect.

2728
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:40,340
Okay.

2729
02:42:41,380 --> 02:42:43,260
We're gonna visit gal and golem.

2730
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:44,320
Oh, wait.

2731
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:45,940
What's it going to be this time?

2732
02:42:46,160 --> 02:42:46,860
Wait, what was it?

2733
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:49,740
And then talking?

2734
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:51,500
Wait, who's the catch up part?

2735
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,320
Or...

2736
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:54,340
Why is it...

2737
02:43:00,150 --> 02:43:00,550
Dispatch.

2738
02:43:00,890 --> 02:43:01,830
You're gonna be online tonight?

2739
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:03,230
What's going on?

2740
02:43:03,350 --> 02:43:03,510
Woo!

2741
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:04,130
Hey, Robert.

2742
02:43:04,930 --> 02:43:06,970
I'm pretty sure I've got the scammer on the line.

2743
02:43:08,170 --> 02:43:09,690
Okay, I got you.

2744
02:43:12,050 --> 02:43:12,450
Synergy.

2745
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:16,470
Oh, whoops.

2746
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:19,490
We got this.

2747
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:21,430
All right, let's see where this asshole is.

2748
02:43:21,590 --> 02:43:23,690
Yeah, there's so much happening all at once.

2749
02:43:26,590 --> 02:43:29,730
Whoa, oh, match the frequency.

2750
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:32,510
Warmer.

2751
02:43:32,670 --> 02:43:33,470
Oh, okay.

2752
02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:43,500
Oh, I'm not very good at this, I think.

2753
02:43:47,140 --> 02:43:48,140
Nearly there.

2754
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:49,180
Ah, hi!

2755
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:51,740
Wait, what happened?

2756
02:43:53,220 --> 02:43:54,040
I'll match it again.

2757
02:43:58,620 --> 02:44:00,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2758
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:03,980
Oh.

2759
02:44:04,520 --> 02:44:05,120
Got him.

2760
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:05,640
Got him.

2761
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:09,180
Oh, so there was two.

2762
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:12,840
Scammer hacked, baby.

2763
02:44:13,820 --> 02:44:14,340
Easy peasy.

2764
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:17,700
Can we get some help over here?

2765
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:21,720
Hour.

2766
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:25,300
I love minor inconvenience being just like a...

2767
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:29,720
There's like the people that call 911 when they're like, I'm
in...

2768
02:44:29,720 --> 02:44:32,260
I have a complaint to the manager.

2769
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:34,080
Reroute the traffic and keep it flowing.

2770
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:36,320
Lift their spirits and grab their attention.

2771
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:37,800
Okay, so we definitely need Prism.

2772
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:44,360
but okay okay what is reroute what would you do to reroute
something

2773
02:44:51,580 --> 02:45:00,820
uh my cheeseburger isn't cheese enough i was like is it
smarts or is it combat because you're like picking up the

2774
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:13,880
cars smarts maybe everybody is okay let's try coop graceful
but deadly and then this one a cargo aboard is minutes away

2775
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:21,580
from colliding with the stopped freight at the station okay
halt the train before it crashes rescue the precious cargo

2776
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:37,700
aboard i think we could send these to heading there yeah
okay all right so far uh oh when they're injured i forget

2777
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:40,760
that they're like okay like they're still available

2778
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:46,880
Imagine we lost that 96%.

2779
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:48,980
Yippee!

2780
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:50,540
Okay, good job, team.

2781
02:45:53,540 --> 02:45:54,200
Oh, it...

2782
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:56,200
Oh, nice, okay.

2783
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:57,680
I'm confused.

2784
02:45:58,280 --> 02:45:59,740
I thought that would be more difficult.

2785
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:00,960
Okay.

2786
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:03,680
Oh.

2787
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:05,100
Oh.

2788
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:08,160
Oh, okay.

2789
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:10,800
They're turning around.

2790
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:12,260
They're...

2791
02:46:12,260 --> 02:46:14,300
Everybody's coming around.

2792
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:14,820
Wow.

2793
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,160
You're on fire today.

2794
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:17,280
Doki lost some 85% stuff.

2795
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:17,880
No way.

2796
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:19,020
I'm just warming up.

2797
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:23,880
After a success, Flambe gains one combat, one mobility.

2798
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:24,860
The effect stack.

2799
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:27,860
Stack for the whole workday or forever?

2800
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:29,860
Oh, wait.

2801
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:31,560
All boosts reset after a failure.

2802
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:32,460
Okay.

2803
02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:35,400
Let's see.

2804
02:46:35,440 --> 02:46:36,640
What are we going to give you?

2805
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:39,320
Hmm.

2806
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:40,980
Oh, for the workday.

2807
02:46:41,060 --> 02:46:41,460
Okay, okay.

2808
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:44,780
Stacks for the work.

2809
02:46:45,060 --> 02:46:45,620
Thank you, guys.

2810
02:46:45,940 --> 02:46:46,680
Thank you.

2811
02:46:47,360 --> 02:46:51,740
Doki lost a 92% and lost like five other 80% goals of the
same ship.

2812
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:53,840
Sounds like a skill issue.

2813
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:56,900
I think Punch-Up needs to be stronger.

2814
02:46:58,380 --> 02:47:00,200
I think he needs to be stronger.

2815
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:04,180
Everybody rest.

2816
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:05,160
Everybody rest.

2817
02:47:07,220 --> 02:47:08,220
Burglars spotted.

2818
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:10,160
Headed towards the alley on the green.

2819
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:10,980
Oh.

2820
02:47:11,140 --> 02:47:11,780
I'll handle this.

2821
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:20,320
I can't, I can't.

2822
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:21,280
She has to go do it.

2823
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:22,100
Stay out of my way.

2824
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:23,320
Fuck off.

2825
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:25,020
What are you doing in Visigau?

2826
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:26,480
Why is there a cat mascot?

2827
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:29,260
It's like you said.

2828
02:47:29,700 --> 02:47:32,280
The way to win this leaderboard game is to not lose, right?

2829
02:47:32,360 --> 02:47:33,640
Yeah, that's not what I said.

2830
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:35,420
I'm pretty sure that's what you said.

2831
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:38,640
Is she sabotaging her?

2832
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:40,320
Oh, man.

2833
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:42,040
Oh, he's sad.

2834
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:44,260
Oh, it's this guy again.

2835
02:48:00,930 --> 02:48:02,850
This well and everybody sabotages?

2836
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:04,770
I don't know, I'm not doing that well, I think.

2837
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:07,850
The proof that just ran by was light and struck, this is now
the second time.

2838
02:48:09,290 --> 02:48:10,030
No shit?

2839
02:48:10,470 --> 02:48:11,030
That's crazy.

2840
02:48:11,870 --> 02:48:13,930
I thought you weren't trying to get cut!

2841
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:17,410
I think you deserve this.

2842
02:48:18,270 --> 02:48:20,010
She's got the buster sword and everything.

2843
02:48:23,190 --> 02:48:30,790
I'd normally say cut it but then the way things are going I
cut the whole damn team yeah reset Robbie all Z team back to

2844
02:48:30,790 --> 02:48:51,890
base and in the conference room in 20 minutes come on Z team
come on oh lack of team synergy what rude

2845
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,560
Screaming that guy's ear.

2846
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,680
I would go up behind him and I'd yell.

2847
02:49:05,940 --> 02:49:07,780
Anyone else think this is a waste of time?

2848
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:08,440
Yeah, I know.

2849
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:10,980
Whoa.

2850
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:13,500
I had a thousand better things to do.

2851
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:15,300
There is so many more people than you want.

2852
02:49:15,800 --> 02:49:20,540
I was about to hit the gym to give Teresa the same support
if it worked out.

2853
02:49:20,540 --> 02:49:21,100
All right, team.

2854
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:22,640
Can everybody take a seat so we can get started?

2855
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:23,800
Okay, team.

2856
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:26,320
Hey, can I get your attention, please?

2857
02:49:26,460 --> 02:49:27,420
I would like to get started.

2858
02:49:27,440 --> 02:49:27,980
You think great, however?

2859
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:28,680
Oh, thank you.

2860
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:29,720
Oh, I forgot about Gala.

2861
02:49:30,380 --> 02:49:32,340
Oh, it looks like this motherfucker's got the power to fly.

2862
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:33,960
Kick him out.

2863
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:34,780
Kick him out.

2864
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:37,120
We need the respect.

2865
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:38,860
Hey, you.

2866
02:49:39,820 --> 02:49:40,560
Get out of here.

2867
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:42,020
Yeah, you.

2868
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:43,900
Fucking Barney Rubble, fuck off.

2869
02:49:44,300 --> 02:49:46,100
You can ask one of your teammates to fill you in later.

2870
02:49:47,980 --> 02:49:48,560
Golly, boy.

2871
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:51,480
Then I won't just kick you out of this room.

2872
02:49:51,620 --> 02:49:53,360
I'll kick you out of the whole Phoenix program.

2873
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,660
You can go back to whatever life was so lame that you
thought coming here was an improvement.

2874
02:49:58,120 --> 02:50:00,360
Or you can step outside and think about...

2875
02:50:00,380 --> 02:50:05,920
what you want from all of this why you're here yeah
something everyone in this room should be thinking about

2876
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:21,940
yeah he says i'm mud he would say i'm mad but he's literally
mud what's golem sitting outside for he's in timeout time

2877
02:50:21,940 --> 02:50:32,080
out everybody time out i love the minus two and plus two
right I know he's not getting kicked.

2878
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:33,680
Let's go, come on, fucking wasting my time.

2879
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:37,720
Okay, as you know, by the end of today, one of you will be
cut from the Z team.

2880
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:39,120
This is bullshit.

2881
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:40,420
Yeah, you said that already.

2882
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:42,580
Call me from a job I didn't want in the first place.

2883
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:43,900
Then why are you here?

2884
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:45,800
His name is Mood.

2885
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:48,980
You wouldn't have to throw no one out.

2886
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:51,660
Hey, Nikki Mirage, I'm standing right here.

2887
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:52,860
You can talk to me.

2888
02:50:53,060 --> 02:50:55,020
I wasn't talking to you, bitch.

2889
02:50:55,280 --> 02:50:57,180
Which weak-ass superhero team did you come from?

2890
02:50:57,220 --> 02:50:58,120
Fucking Geek Squad?

2891
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:00,180
Doesn't matter where I'm from, Cardi C.

2892

2897
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:34,340
And see a bunch of villains.

2898
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:40,600
Not even the super kind, just plain ass, run in the mill,
vanilla fucking villains.

2899
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,220
Not vanilla.

2900
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:42,820
But that's not what I see.

2901
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:43,780
Like Cardi D-minus.

2902
02:51:43,780 --> 02:51:43,920
Yeah, good way, good way.

2903
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:46,040
Because lucky for you, I'm not most people.

2904
02:51:47,180 --> 02:51:51,640
When I look around this room, what I see is...

2905
02:51:51,640 --> 02:51:52,540
Potential.

2906
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,800
Oh my god, just like Gus.

2907
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:54,720
Both are in the end.

2908
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:56,920
Unfortunately for you, it's a curse.

2909
02:51:57,500 --> 02:52:04,280
Because there isn't a thing in the universe that goes more
ways it then potential and despite how common it is no one

2910
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:11,800
seems to forget it's what they whisper when you leave the
room oh so and so had so much potential it follows you

2911
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:22,440
forever i'm here to help you lift the curse of potential
yeah by getting you to fucking do something with it oh a

2912
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:31,340
superhero you're all part of the phoenix program any of you
know what a phoenix is oh um city in arizona Nah, Florida's

2913
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:31,620
the dick.

2914
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:33,340
Then Louisiana's gotta be the ball sack.

2915
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:34,780
Just, you know, position.

2916
02:52:34,980 --> 02:52:36,180
The Phoenix...

2917
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:36,320
Sorry.

2918
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:42,480
According to legend, is a beautiful bird of prey that was so
tired of its immortality it tricked the sun god into

2919
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:45,600
dropping a spark on its nest to set it ablaze.

2920
02:52:46,340 --> 02:52:47,180
Burning it to shit.

2921
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:53,620
But instead of dying, the Phoenix emerged from ash.

2922
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:55,360
You are all Phoenixes!

2923
02:52:56,460 --> 02:53:00,360
All of you in this room are Phoenixes, and it's obvious what
that...

2924
02:53:00,380 --> 02:53:12,740
means but for you dumb ones i'll spell it out the phoenix
symbolizes oh my gosh this is hololive miss right here you

02:55:11,860 --> 02:55:13,700
I just sent him the time out.

2951
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:19,580
He's like, I don't want to do my job.

2952
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:20,360
I'm Engy.

2953
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:24,840
Some bitch just cut me in line at the Utopia concert.

2954
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:27,200
I've been here for 12 fucking hours.

2955
02:55:27,220 --> 02:55:27,640
Cool.

2956
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:28,780
Peaceful.

2957
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:29,960
Oh.

2958
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:32,980
You basic bet.

2959
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:34,600
We're all diamonds.

2960
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:36,860
I won't scatter your soul to the heart this year.

2961
02:55:36,880 --> 02:55:40,880
to a girl who knows four chords and can't write a song to
save her life.

2962
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:41,960
Say what you want.

2963
02:55:42,380 --> 02:55:43,040
It's catchy.

2964
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:43,700
Unbelievable.

2965
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:50,240
I think we should send out who's a good smooth talker
besides Prism.

2966
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:54,460
Uh...

2967
02:55:54,460 --> 02:55:56,280
No, Robert is little, boys.

2968
02:55:56,480 --> 02:55:57,640
Yeah, because he's so little.

2969
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:00,820

Thank you.

2971
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:04,360
He didn't hear your speech from outside.

2972
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:05,180
Aw.

2973
02:56:05,440 --> 02:56:06,700

On fuego.

2978
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:44,220
Yo, Mal, what kind of music you got in your heavy rotation
right now?

2979
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:45,840
You know, honestly, it's a little skull.

2980
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:49,220
But I had like a really big technology face recently too.

2981
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:52,800
The line cutter actually pulled out a knife!

2982
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:54,280
Actually, several knives!

2983
02:56:54,300 --> 02:56:55,720
Do you like the sensation of your ears bleeding?

2984
02:56:55,940 --> 02:56:57,040
Oh, you know what?

2985
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:57,260
Oh.

2986
02:56:57,260 --> 02:56:57,560
I'm good.

2987
02:56:57,880 --> 02:56:58,260
All right.

2988
02:56:58,460 --> 02:56:58,920
All for me.

2989
02:56:59,380 --> 02:57:00,200
Um, you know what?

2990
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:01,540
Well, if she wants a fight, yeah.

2991
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:06,200
I think our, I think our, we're pretty good.

2992
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:08,560
Our attack, yeah.

2993
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:11,640
Oh, I think I'm starting to understand it.

2994
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:14,620
So if my stat is here, but...

2995
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:16,240
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

2996
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:18,240
I'm understanding the game.

2997
02:57:18,480 --> 02:57:19,240
Oh, what's happening here?

2998
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:21,900
I think there's some kind of cult recruiting outside my
store.

2999
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:23,140
They're creeping everyone out.

3000
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:24,300
Wow!

3001
02:57:24,860 --> 02:57:30,120
Identify the loiterers' recruitment goals and tell them to
disperse.

3002
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:35,240
Identify and speak.

3003
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:36,860
Okay.

3004
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:38,860
This street preacher needs to work on a sandwich.

3005
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:40,540
Everybody's getting along, you guys.

3006
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:41,760
Everybody's getting along.

3007
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:45,080
Oh, we also need to do this.

3008
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:45,680
Let's see.

3009
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:49,860
Let's see.

3010
02:57:50,020 --> 02:57:52,100
I feel like I need more charisma on people.

3011
02:57:52,340 --> 02:57:54,940
Everybody's lacking in speech ability.

3012
02:57:55,780 --> 02:57:56,700
Oh my goodness.

3013
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:59,400
You guys can't talk yourselves out of anything.

3014
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:01,360
We're a team.

3015
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:02,280
We're a team.

3016
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:02,980
Uh-oh.

3017
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:13,760
The matching jumpsuit weirdos are definitely a cult that's
recruiting what's the best approach just how wait we could

3018
02:58:13,760 --> 02:58:26,040
have we could have become the the God of their cold destroy
their literature free their minds I'm so curious what that

3019
02:58:26,040 --> 02:58:29,720
means oh

3020
02:58:33,300 --> 02:58:41,920
oh yes good they've been shooed We freed them.

3021
02:58:42,220 --> 02:58:44,820
Half man, half bat, all freak.

3022
02:58:45,060 --> 02:58:45,860
All freak.

3023
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:48,000
Half man, half bat.

3024
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:50,740
All freak.

3025
02:58:52,360 --> 02:58:57,960
And so charisma when he is a bat would go into vigor, right?

3026
02:58:58,260 --> 02:58:59,700
We'll do charisma then.

3027
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:06,060
So right now he's a mega bat, so he's like, he looks like
this.

3028
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:06,800
Okay, okay.

3029
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:08,920
Half man.

3030
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:10,440
There's a bunch of men in the base.

3031
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:14,160
of the Gigaburger for some kind of fight club.

3032
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:16,800
I don't know how they got here, but they need to go.

3033
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:20,220
There's been fighting tourneys ever since the first chimp
made a fist.

3034
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:22,800
You're crazy if you think you can shut this down.

3035
02:59:23,600 --> 02:59:25,820
Well, Punch Up, it could be your honor.

3036
02:59:26,420 --> 02:59:29,180
Shut down the underground fight ring in the basement of
Gigab...

3037
02:59:29,180 --> 02:59:29,800
Oh, wait, hold on.

3038
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:31,740
Before we do that, let's upgrade somebody else.

3039
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:32,300
Oh, Prism.

3040
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:37,040
Let's...

3041
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:37,560
Hmm.

3042
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:39,140
How do I want to?

3043
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:39,600
Hmm.

3044
02:59:50,600 --> 02:59:51,360
Hmm.

3045
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:53,960
More charisma.

3046
02:59:58,920 --> 02:59:59,900
Let's see.

3047
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:01,680
Okay, shut it down.

3048
03:00:03,140 --> 03:00:04,160
Anticipate resistance.

3049
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:10,540
Resistance, would that mean, like, physical or they want to
chat with us?

3050
03:00:12,860 --> 03:00:13,880
You know?

3051
03:00:15,100 --> 03:00:16,320
On my way.

3052
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:17,840
We can do both.

3053
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:19,780
Okay.

3054
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:21,420
We can send...

3055
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:22,660
On my way.

3056
03:00:23,940 --> 03:00:25,260
It's a fight club.

3057
03:00:25,780 --> 03:00:26,940
Okay, so they want to fight.

3058
03:00:27,880 --> 03:00:29,180
Look at this.

3059
03:00:29,820 --> 03:00:31,220
We can't be any stronger.

3060
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:32,580
Mark my words.

3061
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:34,020
We ain't stopping nothing.

3062
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:36,300
So you might as well send me in.

3063
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:37,520
Yeah, that's what I did.

3064
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:41,080
My client requires protection at lunch with the governor of
California.

3065
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:42,620
Woody's still alive.

3066
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:45,540
Are you going soft on his coop?

3067
03:00:45,820 --> 03:00:46,300
Please.

3068
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:47,840
They couldn't pay.

3069
03:00:48,360 --> 03:00:49,680
So I canceled the job.

3070
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:59,400
No cash no kill so far full-on brawl exactly as long as the
checks clear I will kill or protect as they see fit Let's

3071
03:00:59,400 --> 03:01:05,600

they see That

3072
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:26,160

3076
03:01:58,780 --> 03:02:01,080
Word on the street is the tourney just relocated.

3077
03:02:06,220 --> 03:02:09,500
We massively lunch enjoyed.

3078
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:11,800
That was a...

3079
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:12,440
Wait, what are you doing?

3080
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:14,020

3081
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:16,060

Koopay?

3084
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:23,360
I learned from my sources that the next tournament will be
held at the refinery in one hour.

3085
03:02:23,800 --> 03:02:24,180
Oh, also.

3086
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:25,300
Oh, oh, oh.

3087
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:29,960
She's looking for a fight club, baby.

03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:35,560
Let's, um...

3089
03:02:37,500 --> 03:02:39,920
I'll put a little more charisma in you.

3090
03:02:40,340 --> 03:02:41,440
Because you need some help.

3091
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:43,200
Speaking, I think.

3092
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:45,370
For you, we'll do...

3093
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:50,240
Also, charisma in you.

3094
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:53,000
Everybody's a smooth talker on my team.

3095
03:02:54,160 --> 03:02:55,040
Fight in the tournament!

3096
03:02:55,320 --> 03:02:56,400
shut down the tournament.

3097
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:01,900
Bye.

3098
03:03:01,960 --> 03:03:02,160
Wait.

Send me in to compete.

3101
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:05,940
I'll win so hard.

3102
03:03:06,380 --> 03:03:08,480
We'll bankrupt every bookie in torrents.

3103
03:03:08,540 --> 03:03:09,660
Try not to get killed?

3104
03:03:09,860 --> 03:03:10,200
All right.

3105
03:03:12,180 --> 03:03:13,000
Hero training.

3106
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:14,520
Punch up.

3107
03:03:14,980 --> 03:03:15,540
You will be magnificent.

3108
03:03:15,540 --> 03:03:16,500
Let's learn to fly.

3109
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:18,860
Your flight-capable heroes need a flight lesson.

3110
03:03:19,640 --> 03:03:19,860
Whoa.

3111
03:03:20,420 --> 03:03:24,220
I want to get this guy out of my team, so we'll send in the
bat.

3112
03:03:25,700 --> 03:03:26,140
Cool.

3113
03:03:27,360 --> 03:03:30,700
Maybe this whole leaderboard thing goes away.

3114
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:31,240
Maybe flambé.

3115
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:31,500
Why?

3116
03:03:32,200 --> 03:03:32,220
Why?

3117
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:36,180
I don't like him, though.

3118
03:03:36,580 --> 03:03:37,540
I don't want him in my sand.

3119
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:40,320
Desperate fucks.

3120
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:41,580
It's my game, guys.

3121
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:42,020
Uh oh.

3122
03:03:43,240 --> 03:03:44,860
Hey, Bobby, you think you could send someone?

3123
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,420
I need a corner man or woman.

3124
03:03:46,700 --> 03:03:47,220
Maybe coupe?

3125
03:03:47,860 --> 03:03:48,180
Coupe?

3126
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:48,720
Okay.

3127
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:49,300
Coupe?

3128
03:03:50,420 --> 03:03:51,220
You can go.

3129
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:54,160
25.

3130
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:55,280
Uh, what?

3131
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:56,280
Who's gonna tell her?

3132
03:03:56,360 --> 03:03:57,220
Don't tell me anything.

3133
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:58,300
I don't want any spoilers.

3134
03:03:58,460 --> 03:04:01,200
Also, you guys telling me that is like...

3135
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:03,620
Now you're making me feel like I made the wrong choice.

3136
03:04:05,180 --> 03:04:07,600
You guys made me feel like I made the wrong choice.

3137
03:04:20,150 --> 03:04:22,170
My client requires protection.

3138
03:04:22,430 --> 03:04:22,630
Okay.

3139
03:04:23,350 --> 03:04:25,330
A lot of protection stuff.

3140
03:04:25,510 --> 03:04:26,290
Going in.

3141
03:04:26,610 --> 03:04:27,390
Going in.

3142
03:04:32,370 --> 03:04:33,090
Look at that.

3143
03:04:33,230 --> 03:04:34,170
That's craziness.

3144
03:04:34,510 --> 03:04:35,010
Guess what?

3145
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:36,550
Guess what?

3146
03:04:36,810 --> 03:04:37,350
Chicken butt.

3147
03:04:37,650 --> 03:04:38,150
Yo, go along.

3148
03:04:39,770 --> 03:04:42,210
I fuck with potpourri, so are, bro.

3149
03:04:42,470 --> 03:04:42,870
Potpourri?

3150
03:04:43,030 --> 03:04:43,430
Dang.

3151
03:04:43,990 --> 03:04:45,350
Okay, okay, I see you.

3152
03:04:45,530 --> 03:04:46,270
How'd it go?

3153
03:04:46,550 --> 03:04:47,090
I was not, bro.

3154
03:04:47,570 --> 03:04:48,190
Strong bag.

3155
03:04:49,010 --> 03:04:49,590
It transformed.

3156
03:04:49,650 --> 03:04:52,990
If transform sonar flies to call locations, greatly reducing
travel.

3157
03:04:53,570 --> 03:04:53,970
Nice.

3158
03:04:57,370 --> 03:04:57,770
Yay.

3159
03:04:58,570 --> 03:04:58,770
Okay.

3160
03:04:58,770 --> 03:05:01,790
And if SDN disagrees with me, they're more than welcome to
come on.

3161
03:05:01,890 --> 03:05:03,270
Oh, we got the Bowen Zone again.

3162
03:05:04,210 --> 03:05:06,490
Get on the air with the Bowen Zone for a friendly debate.

3163
03:05:06,630 --> 03:05:06,790
Okay.

3164
03:05:07,850 --> 03:05:08,250
Okay.

3165
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:12,800
Friendly.

3166
03:05:13,560 --> 03:05:15,780
Robert is mecha man.

3167
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:19,800
But no one's supposed to know his identity!

3168
03:05:20,400 --> 03:05:22,960
He wears... Oh, he doesn't even wear glasses, actually.

3169
03:05:23,840 --> 03:05:25,000
Videos are for music.

3170
03:05:25,540 --> 03:05:26,340
Fuck that guy.

3171
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:28,240
Uh-oh, everybody's busy right now.

3172
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:28,820
Guys?

3173
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:30,180
Uh-oh.

3174
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:31,080
Oh, Flambé.

3175
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:34,260
About your position at the top with a leaderboard.

3176
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:37,720
I took a little peek at your file.

3177
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:40,080
Apparently you've contained more fires than anyone else.

3178
03:05:40,100 --> 03:05:43,040
You guys can't just be doxing people like that.

3179
03:05:43,380 --> 03:05:44,620
It's really disrespectful.

3180
03:05:46,460 --> 03:05:50,940
Can you guys shut up so I can read this?

3181
03:05:51,400 --> 03:05:52,800
We have eyes on the assassin.

3182
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:54,040
Looks like red ring.

3183
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:54,900
What is red ring?

3184
03:05:56,740 --> 03:05:58,400
Um, challenge him.

3185
03:05:59,960 --> 03:06:00,480
Kick his butt.

3186
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:02,280
I think we could do it.

3187
03:06:04,120 --> 03:06:04,600
Oh yeah.

3188
03:06:06,520 --> 03:06:07,400
Assassin taken down.

3189
03:06:08,060 --> 03:06:09,140
Client protected.

3190
03:06:09,620 --> 03:06:09,940
Everybody?

3191
03:06:10,100 --> 03:06:10,600
Save.

3192
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:12,380
Dinner served.

3193
03:06:13,220 --> 03:06:14,240
Watch me burn.

3194
03:06:15,440 --> 03:06:16,040
Who's going to...

3195
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:16,880
Who's graduating?

3196
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:17,860
Hold the fuck up.

3197
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:18,340
Punch.

3198
03:06:19,060 --> 03:06:20,580
Red Ring is the gang shroud lead.

3199
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,720
Oh, okay, thank you.

3200
03:06:22,600 --> 03:06:24,360
Oh, my God.

3201
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:25,180
That was...

3202
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:26,420
Look at that!

3203
03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:27,040
Oh, wait.

3204
03:06:27,080 --> 03:06:28,000
They're so cute.

3205
03:06:29,440 --> 03:06:30,320
Special technique.

3206
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:31,900
Real classy stuff.

3207
03:06:31,940 --> 03:06:32,440
They're so cute.

3208
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:34,480
Maybe if you ask nice, I'll tell you about it.

3209
03:06:35,340 --> 03:06:38,160
If there's someone who needs extra hero training, I've got
free time right now.

3210
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:38,760
I'll set it around.

3211
03:06:44,900 --> 03:06:45,380
Um...

3212
03:06:45,380 --> 03:06:45,880
One second.

3213
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:47,740
Let's use our points.

3214
03:06:50,660 --> 03:06:51,140
Oh...

3215
03:06:52,540 --> 03:06:53,020
Oh...

3216
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:55,740
He's kind of dumb, so we'll make him a little smarter.

3217
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:56,500
Actually, no.

3218
03:06:56,600 --> 03:06:57,420
We'll give you more charisma.

3219
03:07:01,600 --> 03:07:02,280
And then who else?

3220
03:07:02,580 --> 03:07:03,240
Oh, punch up.

3221
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:04,620
Punch up!

3222
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:05,640
Keep on!

3223
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:06,900
Punching up, baby.

3224
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:09,940
Client protected.

3225
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:11,180
Hotel Travago.

3226
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:15,760
Hero training, huh?

3227
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:18,740
Well...

3228
03:07:18,740 --> 03:07:20,000
I have, you know...

3229
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,800
I've got a lot of people that are like resting and all,
so...

3230
03:07:23,620 --> 03:07:25,200
You know, we just...

3231
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,580
My tail's wagging, I swear.

3232
03:07:27,380 --> 03:07:27,760
Cute!

3233
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:30,480
Uh-oh!

3234
03:07:30,680 --> 03:07:31,620
Lightning struck spotted.

3235
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:33,300
Urgent care on Boone Street.

3236
03:07:34,060 --> 03:07:35,220
Apprehend lightning struck.

3237
03:07:35,400 --> 03:07:36,460
Go quickly before he gets away.

3238
03:07:37,140 --> 03:07:38,340
Don't underestimate him.

3239
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:38,920
Oh!

3240
03:07:38,920 --> 03:07:40,700
I already tangled with this dickwad once.

3241
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:41,860
Send someone else.

3242
03:07:42,520 --> 03:07:43,100
Uh-oh.

3243
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:45,800
Wait, I can't only send one guy though.

3244
03:07:46,680 --> 03:07:47,060
Uh-oh.

3245
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:48,240
Everybody's resting.

3246
03:07:48,640 --> 03:07:49,960
I could pull somebody out of resting.

3247
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:50,560
I do have that.

3248
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:53,920
I am at the Torrance Bank and there's these guys with masks
and guns.

3249
03:08:01,190 --> 03:08:02,070
Approach swiftly.

3250
03:08:03,510 --> 03:08:04,690
Send someone else.

3251
03:08:05,610 --> 03:08:06,010
I'm physical!

3252
03:08:06,810 --> 03:08:08,330
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna literally...

3253
03:08:09,370 --> 03:08:10,390
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

3254
03:08:10,390 --> 03:08:11,570
Yeah, I need the coffee.

3255
03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:13,410
Wait, okay.

3256
03:08:14,190 --> 03:08:15,510
Take a hero out of resting.

3257
03:08:16,410 --> 03:08:17,770
They're all really close though.

3258
03:08:18,570 --> 03:08:19,610
Hold on.

3259
03:08:20,770 --> 03:08:21,530
Okay, wait, F.

3260
03:08:22,350 --> 03:08:24,650
Now I can do it for, like, Prism or Malevolo.

3261
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:30,160
Ah, beautiful.

3262
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:32,040
Okay, now we have more people.

3263
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:34,880
Okay, fast.

3264
03:08:35,280 --> 03:08:36,160
We need fast.

3265
03:08:40,110 --> 03:08:40,770
Let's see.

3266
03:08:43,790 --> 03:08:45,270
I think you missed a job.

3267
03:08:45,410 --> 03:08:46,250
You guys, it's okay.

3268
03:08:46,810 --> 03:08:48,410
I think that's gonna happen.

3269
03:08:51,070 --> 03:08:51,950
Holy moly.

3270
03:08:52,030 --> 03:08:53,830
When did he get so strong?

3271
03:08:54,090 --> 03:08:55,030
When did his...

3272
03:08:56,790 --> 03:08:57,950
When did his...

3273
03:08:57,950 --> 03:09:00,130
When did his stats become like this?

3274
03:09:05,850 --> 03:09:06,830
It's his ability.

3275
03:09:06,930 --> 03:09:07,490
Oh, that's right.

3276
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:08,750
Every time he...

3277
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:09,730
Uh...

3278
03:09:09,730 --> 03:09:10,210
Right.

3279
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:12,570
Sweet ass.

3280
03:09:12,790 --> 03:09:15,370
Honestly, I'm like, do we need anybody else?

3281
03:09:17,950 --> 03:09:18,950
Passive buffs.

3282
03:09:21,390 --> 03:09:22,970
Watch me whip this amateur's ass.

3283
03:09:22,990 --> 03:09:25,430
Alright, let's put Golem in.

3284
03:09:25,890 --> 03:09:37,890
him feel better his last job wait maybe he's good maybe i
don't wanna once per shift all of golem stats can be reset

3285

golem expands to fill each empty slot increasingly

3287
03:09:55,310 --> 03:09:57,550
increasingly his stats by 25% per slot.

3288
03:09:58,490 --> 03:10:00,750
Up to 200% when beneficial.

3289
03:10:01,850 --> 03:10:02,330
Oh.

3290
03:10:02,810 --> 03:10:03,990
I think that one's better.

3291
03:10:11,260 --> 03:10:12,380
Yeah, I missed this one.

3292
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:13,560
Pupsy pupsy.

3293
03:10:14,760 --> 03:10:16,460
But honestly, I had nobody to send.

3294
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:18,080
I had to get this one.

3295
03:10:18,300 --> 03:10:20,820
I clicked it and then it immediately expired on this one.

3296
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:23,340
So it is what it is.

3297
03:10:23,720 --> 03:10:24,060
Nana!

3298
03:10:24,380 --> 03:10:25,660
Thank you so much for the thing gifted.

3299
03:10:26,220 --> 03:10:26,800
Thank you.

3300
03:10:28,440 --> 03:10:28,840
Yeah!

3301
03:10:31,420 --> 03:10:32,220
Holy cow!

3302
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:33,620
I'm not fucking around, all right?

3303
03:10:34,100 --> 03:10:35,940
Oh my god, that was close.

3304
03:10:36,300 --> 03:10:37,680
Pretty breathtaking work back there.

3305
03:10:37,960 --> 03:10:38,640
Not too shabby.

3306
03:10:38,780 --> 03:10:39,240
Hey, what are you doing?

3307
03:10:39,500 --> 03:10:40,320
It's not too shabby at all.

3308
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:41,100
Why'd she run away?

3309
03:10:41,720 --> 03:10:42,860
It's like we're working.

3310
03:10:43,900 --> 03:10:44,400
What's the word?

3311
03:10:45,280 --> 03:10:45,900
As a team.

3312
03:10:46,400 --> 03:10:46,860
Uh-huh.

3313
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:48,760
Baby, that's got a name.

3314
03:10:49,060 --> 03:10:49,740
It's teamwork.

3315
03:10:50,500 --> 03:10:50,900
Yeah!

3316
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:51,840
That's like a sex thing.

3317
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:53,820
What type of sex thing would that be?

3318
03:10:54,020 --> 03:10:56,440
It's not really safe for work, you know?

3319
03:10:56,660 --> 03:10:56,780
Yeah.

3320
03:10:56,800 --> 03:10:57,960
I'll text it to you.

3321
03:10:58,340 --> 03:10:58,760
One sec.

3322
03:10:59,300 --> 03:11:00,280
Oh, damn, boy.

3323
03:11:00,680 --> 03:11:02,020
That's some fucking teamwork.

3324
03:11:02,460 --> 03:11:02,760
All right.

3325
03:11:03,140 --> 03:11:03,140
Continue.

3326
03:11:03,620 --> 03:11:03,620
Continue.

3327
03:11:03,880 --> 03:11:04,520
I don't want to hear anymore.

3328
03:11:04,700 --> 03:11:05,100
Please keep going.

3329
03:11:05,660 --> 03:11:06,160
Where are you going?

3330
03:11:08,860 --> 03:11:09,300
Hello?

3331

There you go.

3335
03:11:25,260 --> 03:11:26,520
One more strike against me.

3336
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,240
You got to get rid of somebody, right?

3337
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:35,340

Are you...

3359
03:14:14,730 --> 03:14:16,790
You ain't worried about a hero crashing the party?

3360
03:14:16,890 --> 03:14:18,550
I think you could have just smashed that.

3361
03:14:19,270 --> 03:14:20,890
Load that up.

3362
03:14:28,310 --> 03:14:28,750
Oh!

3363
03:14:29,190 --> 03:14:29,770
Where's your boy?

3364
03:14:31,090 --> 03:14:31,610
Shit.

3365
03:14:32,490 --> 03:14:33,010
Yeah.

3366
03:14:35,830 --> 03:14:38,370
Like being invisible is like so awesome.

3367
03:14:41,910 --> 03:14:59,970
I would do totally legal operations that help the community
but also I'm a ghost so it's kind of the same got him we

3369
03:15:13,330 --> 03:15:13,430
Great.

3370
03:15:13,890 --> 03:15:15,050
Give me a second to tap into this.

3371
03:15:15,210 --> 03:15:15,790
Okay, I'm hacking.

3372
03:15:16,250 --> 03:15:16,670
I'm ready.

3373
03:15:17,470 --> 03:15:18,090
Give me a second.

3374
03:15:19,050 --> 03:15:19,730
Or two.

3375
03:15:20,330 --> 03:15:20,830
Not even.

3376
03:15:21,430 --> 03:15:21,770
One.

3377
03:15:25,750 --> 03:15:26,390
All right.

3378
03:15:26,730 --> 03:15:28,010
A little more tricky.

3379
03:15:28,570 --> 03:15:28,870
Oh.

3380
03:15:29,130 --> 03:15:29,350
Oh.

3381
03:15:30,070 --> 03:15:30,530
Oh.

3382
03:15:31,150 --> 03:15:31,990
Oh my god.

3383
03:15:33,770 --> 03:15:34,290
Oh.

3384
03:15:34,290 --> 03:15:34,690
Oh.

3385
03:15:34,690 --> 03:15:34,790
Oh.

3386
03:15:34,790 --> 03:15:36,050
What is that?

3387
03:15:36,230 --> 03:15:37,750
Oh, it's a thing that eats you.

3388
03:15:38,210 --> 03:15:39,830
I was curious about going to it.

3389
03:15:40,830 --> 03:15:41,050
Okay.

3390
03:15:41,050 --> 03:15:42,170
I need to run from it.

3391
03:15:42,690 --> 03:15:42,870
What?

3392
03:15:43,170 --> 03:15:43,710
What is it?

3393
03:15:43,950 --> 03:15:44,450
Antivirus.

3394
03:15:45,830 --> 03:15:46,350
Antivirus.

3395
03:15:50,440 --> 03:15:52,540
I went straight to him.

3396
03:15:54,440 --> 03:15:55,680
It looked so...

3397
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:57,180
It looked magical.

3398
03:15:57,640 --> 03:15:58,500
Like, it's so mysterious.

3399
03:15:58,760 --> 03:15:59,260
Where the hell is he?

3400
03:15:59,860 --> 03:16:02,160
Actual moth to a flame moment.

3401
03:16:04,580 --> 03:16:05,320
It's fine.

3402
03:16:05,420 --> 03:16:05,960
It wasn't time.

3403
03:16:06,360 --> 03:16:07,620
Let me try to get another one online.

3404
03:16:08,420 --> 03:16:09,360
I have to do this again?

3405
03:16:09,660 --> 03:16:10,000
Okay.

3406
03:16:10,600 --> 03:16:11,500
We got this.

3407
03:16:12,940 --> 03:16:13,460
everybody

3408
03:16:27,910 --> 03:16:30,750
you can't touch me i'm too good of a hacker

3409
03:16:37,720 --> 03:16:46,800
he's at your seven that wasn't so hard was it he's heading
your way you could have just looked up walking around.

3410
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:48,040
I think you could hear him though.

3411
03:16:49,060 --> 03:16:50,340
Sprinkler time!

3412
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:52,820
Master.

3413
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:57,360
What am I doing?

3414
03:16:57,760 --> 03:16:59,100
Maybe we should communicate.

3415
03:17:02,200 --> 03:17:02,960
There we go.

3416
03:17:04,100 --> 03:17:05,700
Oh, oh I have to loop him.

3417
03:17:08,790 --> 03:17:10,690
You fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

3418
03:17:11,250 --> 03:17:11,590
Yeah!

3419
03:17:12,290 --> 03:17:13,470
Yeah, screw you!

3420
03:17:16,970 --> 03:17:17,890
Oh my god.

3421
03:17:20,310 --> 03:17:22,970
Yeah, Robert, what's the plan?

3422
03:17:23,110 --> 03:17:24,750
Maybe we should, like, tell her what it is.

3423
03:17:24,950 --> 03:17:29,390
On the count of three, I'm going to turn on the main
overhead lights, which should temporarily blind him.

3424
03:17:29,710 --> 03:17:30,350
That was close.

3425
03:17:30,510 --> 03:17:31,110
That was close.

3426
03:17:32,430 --> 03:17:32,870
One.

3427
03:17:37,770 --> 03:17:38,170
Three.

3428
03:17:40,210 --> 03:17:40,650
Yeah!

3429
03:17:41,210 --> 03:17:41,510
Yeah!

3430
03:17:44,830 --> 03:17:45,270
Oh.

3431
03:17:47,210 --> 03:17:49,270
Oh, that's one strong rope.

3432
03:17:49,610 --> 03:17:50,150
Holy cow.

3433
03:17:53,990 --> 03:17:58,390
The strongest set of pearls a lady could ask for.

3434
03:17:59,830 --> 03:18:01,590
I'm no hero.

3435
03:18:02,450 --> 03:18:03,750
Fuck, no, let me try that again.

3436
03:18:04,370 --> 03:18:05,270
Yeah, you see me?

3437
03:18:05,770 --> 03:18:07,210
Wait, uh, what about?

3438
03:18:07,910 --> 03:18:09,630
Lights out, Thunder Cook.

3439
03:18:12,030 --> 03:18:12,590
Oh.

3440
03:18:13,350 --> 03:18:14,310
That's the one.

3441
03:18:14,730 --> 03:18:15,530
No, I don't think so.

3442
03:18:15,710 --> 03:18:16,210
You said it first.

3443
03:18:16,990 --> 03:18:20,790
Right, because lightning thunder struck Cook, look so close.

3444
03:18:21,390 --> 03:18:25,030
Oh, it's fine.

3445
03:18:28,870 --> 03:18:30,850
Hey, Bengal boy.

3446
03:18:32,870 --> 03:18:35,250
Bitch, boy, yeah.

3447
03:18:36,670 --> 03:18:37,270
Aw,

3448
03:18:40,370 --> 03:18:41,090
everybody's clapped.

3449
03:18:41,330 --> 03:18:41,850
Everybody clapped.

3450
03:18:41,870 --> 03:18:43,110
Why are these assholes not being assholes?

3451
03:18:44,770 --> 03:18:46,250
Isn't this what you were going for?

3452
03:18:46,710 --> 03:18:48,130
Yeah, but I didn't think it would work.

3453
03:18:48,690 --> 03:18:49,550
I don't get it.

3454
03:18:50,730 --> 03:18:51,330
So...

3455
03:18:51,390 --> 03:18:53,990
This one keeps the comm line one-on-one.

3456
03:18:54,550 --> 03:18:56,790
This one connects to the whole team.

3457
03:18:57,610 --> 03:19:01,130
And this one goes out to the entire branch.

3458
03:19:03,270 --> 03:19:04,150
Good job.

3459
03:19:04,370 --> 03:19:05,390
Yeah, you got off light.

3460
03:19:06,010 --> 03:19:08,750
One dispatcher broadcast the details of his botched
circumcision.

3461
03:19:09,750 --> 03:19:10,290
HR nightmare.

3462
03:19:11,730 --> 03:19:12,690
Did you mean all that?

3463
03:19:13,390 --> 03:19:14,570
You really think she has a shot?

3464
03:19:15,030 --> 03:19:17,510
All that stuff about fate sounded good, but...

3465
03:19:17,510 --> 03:19:18,390
Everyone has a shot.

3466
03:19:18,390 --> 03:19:19,570
I don't know if you were just saying...

3467
03:19:19,570 --> 03:19:21,270
I said I was going to be the asshole guy.

3468
03:19:21,390 --> 03:19:22,890
but I'm totally not being it all.

3469
03:19:23,010 --> 03:19:23,930
Everyone has a shot.

3470
03:19:24,970 --> 03:19:26,290
I totally went against my plan.

3471
03:19:27,590 --> 03:19:30,230
I feel like that's like a second playthrough kind of thing,
though, no.

3472
03:19:31,670 --> 03:19:33,470
It's a steep learning curve.

3473
03:19:35,430 --> 03:19:36,390
It's fun.

3474
03:19:38,990 --> 03:19:41,710
Ah, maybe I'm too, I don't know.

3475
03:19:41,970 --> 03:19:43,310
I'm too many feelings.

3476
03:19:43,530 --> 03:19:45,090
This mission was textbook.

3477
03:19:45,250 --> 03:19:47,590
Genuinely, dude, I'm really happy for you.

3478
03:19:47,830 --> 03:19:48,110
Aw.

3479
03:19:52,010 --> 03:19:53,230
Sonar and Coop.

3480
03:19:53,650 --> 03:19:53,850
Coop!

3481
03:19:54,070 --> 03:19:54,610
That's not, no.

3482
03:19:55,090 --> 03:19:56,590
Invisigal's still at the bottom of the board.

3483
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:57,810
Oh, the one in the bullpen?

3484
03:19:58,250 --> 03:19:59,390
That thing updates every hour.

3485
03:19:59,930 --> 03:20:01,030
Invisigal moved up.

3486
03:20:01,050 --> 03:20:01,130
Oh.

3487
03:20:01,210 --> 03:20:03,350
Catching lightning struck really gave her a huge boost.

3488
03:20:03,650 --> 03:20:04,130
Bangal boy.

3489
03:20:04,150 --> 03:20:05,210
Wait, but I just taught him how to fly.

3490
03:20:05,630 --> 03:20:06,350
The donut shop escape.

3491
03:20:06,590 --> 03:20:07,570
Slipping past Malevila.

3492
03:20:07,850 --> 03:20:08,950
Now the jewelry store.

3493
03:20:09,530 --> 03:20:10,890
Really bumped up the wanted levels.

3494
03:20:11,010 --> 03:20:11,810
And I made him.

3495
03:20:11,810 --> 03:20:14,230
It's like missing the free throw on purpose to get the put
back.

3496
03:20:14,570 --> 03:20:15,690
Yeah, exactly.

3497
03:20:16,130 --> 03:20:18,330
I don't watch football, but I get it.

3498
03:20:18,510 --> 03:20:19,330
I think you guys read the subtitles.

3499
03:20:19,490 --> 03:20:21,230
I can't read them because my mouse is frozen.

3500
03:20:21,390 --> 03:20:28,810
can't scroll up even if she was on the bottom i'm not sure
i'd have let you cut her then is a good thing she's not yeah

3501
03:20:28,810 --> 03:20:40,570
so these two are now tied for last place who do we cut sonar

beacon before you even left the building today so i'm not

3504
03:20:49,690 --> 03:20:52,110
You thought he was gonna see boobs and got tricked.

3505
03:20:52,410 --> 03:20:54,610
Yeah, he's done that a couple times now.

3506
03:20:54,650 --> 03:20:56,110
Not enough detail in one sentence.

3507
03:20:56,250 --> 03:20:57,210
He's done that a couple times.

3508
03:20:58,030 --> 03:20:59,190
I'll get started on the paperwork.

3509
03:21:00,270 --> 03:21:00,850
I'll let him know.

3510
03:21:00,890 --> 03:21:01,350
It's kind of stupid.

3511
03:21:02,010 --> 03:21:02,470
Me too cute.

3512
03:21:02,930 --> 03:21:04,030
Hey, uh, Robert.

03:21:07,410 --> 03:21:08,150
Great work today.

Thank you.

3515
03:21:16,900 --> 03:21:18,520
My coop is way too good!

3516
03:21:19,180 --> 03:21:21,460
So, I'm sure you know why you're here.

3517
03:21:21,860 --> 03:21:22,740

coupe will remember that right coupe you'll remember that i

3524
03:22:23,220 --> 03:22:24,380

03:22:55,660 --> 03:22:59,820
cute i wonder when the donut store Closes.

3529
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:02,400
Leaf bird.

3530
03:23:03,260 --> 03:23:03,340
Oh.

3531
03:23:05,960 --> 03:23:06,380
Oh!

3532
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:13,640
Is she taking a picture of it?

3533
03:23:13,720 --> 03:23:14,600
Wait, that's so cute.

3534
03:23:18,340 --> 03:23:18,760
Oh!

3535
03:23:20,580 --> 03:23:22,500
Oh, she's just Sundere, everybody.

3536
03:23:22,980 --> 03:23:24,500
I think I understand why people...

3537
03:23:24,500 --> 03:23:27,140
Okay, I think she was the character that people don't like,
right?

3538
03:23:27,340 --> 03:23:29,740
I thought it was the blonde girl, but now I understand.

3539
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:31,600
Well, no one fucking asks you, old man.

3540
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:34,880
Sundere to normies, people hate Sundere girls.

3541
03:23:36,640 --> 03:23:39,020
Like, normies, rather, normies hate Sundere girls.

3542
03:23:39,160 --> 03:23:39,900
It's kind of insane.

3543
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:55,720
But, yeah.

3544
03:23:57,480 --> 03:23:58,700
You'll see why they hate her?

3545
03:23:58,880 --> 03:24:00,480
Uh, well, you know, whatever.

3546
03:24:01,240 --> 03:24:02,060
But it's true, though.

3547
03:24:02,400 --> 03:24:03,600
People don't.

3548
03:24:03,880 --> 03:24:06,460
You 37% of people cut sonar.

3549
03:24:07,480 --> 03:24:08,580
Not a lot of people, huh?

3550
03:24:09,620 --> 03:24:12,500
Everybody wanted voice critical on their team, I guess.

3551
03:24:12,660 --> 03:24:13,960
I guess.

3552
03:24:14,640 --> 03:24:15,660
But it's true.

3553
03:24:16,120 --> 03:24:18,040
I'm not just talking about in this scenario, though.

3554
03:24:18,120 --> 03:24:18,940
Wow, Derek Taco!

3555
03:24:19,100 --> 03:24:19,600
Oh my gosh!

3556
03:24:19,700 --> 03:24:20,420
It's been a while.

3557
03:24:20,820 --> 03:24:23,320
Thank you so much for the Tony gift, and thank you!

3558
03:24:24,960 --> 03:24:33,920
Um, I see so many comments sometimes on, like, um, on like,
I don't even know what the videos are like, but they'll be

3559
03:24:33,920 --> 03:24:37,280
like, oh yeah, Taiga from Toradora, she sucks.

3560
03:24:37,360 --> 03:24:38,280
I can't stand her.

3561
03:24:38,380 --> 03:24:39,240
She's so annoying.

3562
03:24:40,480 --> 03:24:41,580
Because she's Sundere!

3563
03:24:42,140 --> 03:24:43,180
I don't know, like, why?

3564
03:24:43,280 --> 03:24:46,140
What is this Tundere, like...

3565
03:24:47,360 --> 03:24:47,960
Like...

3566
03:24:47,960 --> 03:24:48,880
Just...

3567
03:24:48,880 --> 03:24:50,160
What is this hatred?

3568
03:24:50,220 --> 03:24:51,520
Where is this hatred coming from?

3569
03:24:51,580 --> 03:24:52,560
They like hate the trope.

3570
03:24:52,720 --> 03:24:53,480
It's kind of crazy.

3571
03:24:55,540 --> 03:24:56,440
And Taiga!

3572
03:24:57,180 --> 03:24:58,700
Taiga of all people.

3573
03:24:59,160 --> 03:25:00,100
Makes me angry.

3574
03:25:01,140 --> 03:25:01,660
I know.

3575
03:25:03,580 --> 03:25:05,160
I'm like, what's happening?

3576
03:25:05,940 --> 03:25:09,220
What's happening with like this strange...

3577
03:25:09,220 --> 03:25:10,280
dislike of Tundere?

3578
03:25:10,780 --> 03:25:11,100
Hmm.

3579
03:25:15,100 --> 03:25:18,340
You and 24% of players kicked out Gollum.

3580
03:25:18,600 --> 03:25:20,200
Kicked Gollum out of the conference room.

3581
03:25:20,320 --> 03:25:21,080
Sorry, Gollum.

3582
03:25:21,380 --> 03:25:22,500
Look how sad he looks.

3583
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:24,000
He needed the timeout.

3584
03:25:24,980 --> 03:25:25,860
Oh, I see it.

3585
03:25:26,680 --> 03:25:27,520
Aaron Paul.

3586
03:25:28,200 --> 03:25:29,440
Young Gravy.

3587
03:25:30,520 --> 03:25:32,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3588
03:25:33,360 --> 03:25:36,440
You and 99% of players helped Invisa Gallagher against
Lightning Struck.

3589
03:25:37,560 --> 03:25:39,080
Wait, you could not help?

3590
03:25:40,920 --> 03:25:42,660
There's an option to not help?

3591
03:25:42,760 --> 03:25:43,560
How do you not help?

3592
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:45,080
I was just following the story.

3593
03:25:47,100 --> 03:25:48,860
I guess if you like...

3594
03:25:48,860 --> 03:25:49,320
Timuro!

3595
03:25:49,560 --> 03:25:50,220
Welcome back!

3596
03:25:50,360 --> 03:25:50,840
Thank you!

3597
03:25:51,900 --> 03:25:53,580
If you fail the hack...

3598
03:25:53,580 --> 03:25:54,580
Oh, okay.

3599
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:56,120
1%.

3600
03:25:56,120 --> 03:25:58,740
The 1% are bad at gaming.

3601
03:25:59,460 --> 03:26:00,980
They actually really like Taiga.

3602
03:26:01,240 --> 03:26:02,480
They're just being tuned to now.

3603
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:09,120
You and 64% of players said all of you are Phoenixes.

3604
03:26:09,780 --> 03:26:13,120
You and 32% said F the stars.

3605
03:26:14,020 --> 03:26:19,120
Out of the five times a hero was sabotaged, you helped them
escape with no injuries four times.

3606
03:26:19,500 --> 03:26:19,840
Dang!

3607
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:22,960
I think that was pretty good, no.

3608
03:26:23,260 --> 03:26:26,860
You and 9% of players sent Punch-Up and Coupé to compete as
a killer.

3609
03:26:27,340 --> 03:26:29,260
Why did nobody send them, huh?

3610
03:26:30,300 --> 03:26:30,860
Why?

3611
03:26:31,500 --> 03:26:35,740
You and 88% of players successfully protected Victor from
his enemies.

3612
03:26:36,300 --> 03:26:36,640
Okay.

3613
03:26:39,400 --> 03:26:42,200
Your most sent hero was Malibula.

3614
03:26:43,880 --> 03:26:46,060
30% of players in today's shift.

3615
03:26:49,280 --> 03:26:49,580
Wait.

3616
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:51,260
Huh?

3617
03:26:52,300 --> 03:26:53,280
So I did poorly.

3618
03:26:59,830 --> 03:27:01,110
Yeah, I did poorly.

3619
03:27:01,490 --> 03:27:02,570
That's understandable.

3620
03:27:05,250 --> 03:27:09,810
People laughing at big chungus on the leaderboards are
missing names like Thunder Size and French Press.

3621
03:27:10,010 --> 03:27:11,030
A French Press is cute.

3622
03:27:12,450 --> 03:27:13,510
That's like a coffee, right?

3623
03:27:14,250 --> 03:27:16,750
Activated a hero's powers 27 times.

3624
03:27:17,170 --> 03:27:19,150
Oh, wait, wait, no, no, no episode.

3625
03:27:21,390 --> 03:27:23,830
I think we'll call it there, everybody.

3626
03:27:26,070 --> 03:27:27,350
Episode four.

3627
03:27:27,590 --> 03:27:31,730
We went through three episodes, so yuppie, yuppie, yuppie,
yuppie.

3628
03:27:32,490 --> 03:27:33,530
Yuppie, yuppie, yuppie.

3629
03:27:33,670 --> 03:27:36,150
Wait, when does the donut place close?

3630
03:27:36,610 --> 03:27:37,650
One second, though.

3631
03:27:40,430 --> 03:27:41,710
Let's see.

3632

I'm not a nerd.

3676
03:31:00,710 --> 03:31:01,570
That's my weakness.

3677
03:31:02,230 --> 03:31:02,390

03:31:03,030 --> 03:31:04,350
You can't call me a nerd.

3679

03:31:16,320 --> 03:31:16,960
It's my...

3683
03:31:17,340 --> 03:31:30,100
Oh, it's, it's, oh, oh, it's my weakness, my, my weak, I'm,
I'm shriveling up just like the wicked witch of the West.

3684
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:37,380
Oh, oh, I'm becoming so small, I'm becoming so small.

3685
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:47,320
Oh, oh, I'm shriveling to be the right.

3686
03:31:47,340 --> 03:31:49,780
I'm just a bean.

3687
03:31:54,800 --> 03:31:55,780
You defeated me.

3688
03:31:55,920 --> 03:31:58,120
You can squash me like a bug.

03:31:59,620 --> 03:32:03,340
I'll lay on the ground and make it easier for you guys.

3690
03:32:04,440 --> 03:32:05,240

03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:09,180
Squash me like a bug.

3693
03:32:10,420 --> 03:32:11,040
Squash me.

3694
03:32:22,540 --> 03:32:23,340
I'm waiting.

3695
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:25,740
I'm waiting.

3696
03:32:27,780 --> 03:32:29,200
I'm waiting.

3697
03:32:29,560 --> 03:32:31,960
I'm waiting for you to squash me like a bug.

3698
03:32:32,900 --> 03:32:33,520
I'm waiting.

3699

03:32:43,300 --> 03:32:44,180
No!

3704
03:33:31,590 --> 03:33:32,870
be back.

3705
03:33:33,370 --> 03:33:37,070
You ain't seen the last of me.

3706
03:33:39,210 --> 03:33:41,050
Mega mind.

3707
03:33:43,650 --> 03:33:44,190
Mega...

03:33:45,630 --> 03:33:46,170

3709
03:33:46,790 --> 03:33:47,330

3710
03:33:49,330 --> 03:33:50,410
Thank you.

3711
