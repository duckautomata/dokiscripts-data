1
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm doing foogie right now.

2
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,560
Hello everybody!

3
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,460
Hi!

4
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,120
Hello!

5
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Hello, hello!

6
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,620
Oh, we've kind of just been talking.

7
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,400
Limeo and Snuffy are already streaming, so...

8
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,760
We were just chattin'.

9
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,580
But yeah, I want to say hi before we get into the game.

10
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,880
Sorry, Doki's just talking to herself.

11
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,840
She loves to hear herself speak.

12
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,600
And he's like...

13
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,360
What is she talking about?

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,580
What the hell is she saying?

15
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,140
Are you okay?

16
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,700
I'm so tired.

17
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,360
I literally just woke up.

18
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,620
But we will be using the in-game audio.

19
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,420
We're just in Discord for now.

20
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,080
I can't judge anybody.

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,240
I woke up at like 5.31 today.

22
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,640
Okay.

23
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,220
A long time ago?

24
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,940
I am...

25
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,580
Not starting stream yet.

26
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,160
Oh my god!

27
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,540
You're like, hey guys!

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,640
Hey guys!

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,460
Hey guys!

30
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,940
I'm so ready!

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,340
I'll host Adabi.

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,840
Okay!

33
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,300
Let me host it real quick.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
I can't remember, Mint.

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,700
Do you have like a stand-in account on Twitch that I can tag?

36
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,960
I don't even remember if you do.

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,040
I know Doki has one.

38
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,220
Oh!

39
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,440
Alright, I'm going...

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,820
You're live right, Mint?

41
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,120
If you don't want me to tag you, I'll just say, and Mint.

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't remember what it is.

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,180
Hold on, let me go to Twitch.

44
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,040
Alright.

45
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
I'm inviting friends right now.

46
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,300
Um...

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,500
Okay.

48
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,460
Uh...

49
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,920
I went straight in.

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,380
Oh my god!

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:18,740
Wait!

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,300
Someone's streaming!

53
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,100
Oh my god, sorry.

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Oh, no intro.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,540
No intro.

56
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,940
I've been live this whole time.

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,420
This is me, Limu.

58
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,860
Okay, Stephanie.

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,020
What is it?

60
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,320
Okay.

61
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,460
It's a real account.

62
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,120
I promise.

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,640
Super real.

64
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,400
Totally legit.

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,460
Oh, you sent the thing.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,260
I got it.

67
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,840
Yeah, I sent it.

68
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,220
Oh wait!

69
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,700
It says invited you, but it doesn't show up.

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,860
Like, there's no like, join.

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,380
No, same.

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,980
There's no join?

73
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,540
Yeah.

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,820
Oh shit, then can you join my lobby just through the thing?

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll see if I can.

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,860
It says you're playing VTube Studio.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,180
I don't know if you're updating the game.

78
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,220
I don't know if you're updating the game.

79
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,200
Oh, that's a thing.

80
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,920
Wait, how do you change how you look at?

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,520
Because you don't run the non-Steam version of VTube Studio?

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,440
I do run without Steam.

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,860
No, I run without Steam.

84
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,700
But instead it now tells me that I'm playing V Bridger.

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,700
Oh!

86
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,380
Oh, yes.

87
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Oh, I didn't know you could do it without Steam.

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:05,820
I am.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,620
Yeah, it's apparently less performance intensive.

90
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,580
You just...

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,840
You have to do it like on the...

92
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,600
You can do it for V Bridger too.

93
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,300
Oh!

94
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,760
Yeah, the file.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,180
It's like on the...

96
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,660
You open where the file is and you just click the .ex file.

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,460
Oh!

98
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,120
There's one thing.

99
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,780
You click like, open file location?

100
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,720
And then you'll see like, VTube Studio.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,660
And then it'll be like, VTube Studio without Steam.

102
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,060
Yeah.

103
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,240
That's basically it, yeah.

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,500
How do you change what you look like?

105
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,620
I don't want to be green.

106
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,260
Oh, look at your passport.

107
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,200
Do you have a tangent at the airport?

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,220
Are you really in line?

109
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,000
How do I get in?

110
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,820
Yeah, how do I get in?

111
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,420
Let me in.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,360
Give me a sec.

113
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm customizing my character.

114
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,240
Let us in!

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm gonna miss my flight!

116
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm gonna miss my flight!

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,720
Let us in!

118
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,480
I can't join Donkey because she's playing VTube Studio.

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,540
Give me a sec.

120
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,200
She's staying from the mirror and changing her outfit.

121
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,480
I'll show myself online.

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,880
You are already online.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
It just says you're playing VTube Studio.

124
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,400
Oh, shit.

125
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,040
Oh, shit.

126
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,540
Oh, my God.

127
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,380
I'm doxxing myself.

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,160
Give me a sec.

129
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,380
How do you guys see it?

130
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,720
Everything is private.

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,080
I don't know.

132
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,760
I don't know.

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,780
Clearly, there's a security breach.

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,060
Oh, there is.

135
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,180
You guys are preaching my security right now.

136
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,960
Oh, man!

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,880
Alright, here we go.

138
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,100
You guys should be able to see game details.

139
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,740
And then I'll invite people now.

140
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,140
Invite people now.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,540
Yeah, now I'll invite people.

142
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,060
I invited...

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,240
Lamu.

144
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,980
I invited Mint.

145
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,640
Nah, it's the same thing.

146
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,780
I'm still seeing VTube Studio.

147
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,400
It looks like this.

148
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,460
It looks like this.

149
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,100
Okay, I'm gonna reboot the game.

150
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,780
I'll reboot the game.

151
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,560
I can never remember what order you're supposed to open stuff up in to make that work properly.

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,340
Wait, there's an order?

153
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,020
I didn't know that either!

154
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,300
Yeah, it's because it's like one game will supersede the other.

155
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,660
I think it's the one you do first, which is annoying.

156
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,820
But maybe if you add VTube Studio to your private games.

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,040
Like if it was like an illicit creepy format or something.

158
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,060
I'm learning so much right now.

159
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,680
I don't want to.

160
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,260
Oh my god.

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't want people to know I'm a VTuber.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,040
Like if you were ashamed to be playing VTube Studio or something.

163
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,900
Like I don't want anyone to know I'm a VTuber.

164
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,180
Personal confession.

165
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,360
Can I have...

166
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,220
Can I also blast a game to everybody so that they know that I'm playing?

167
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,360
Yes.

168
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't want everyone to know you're playing orc massage.

169
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,600
You've never been like the victim of somebody booting up like Skyrim's grip extender like 500 times?

170
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,900
You know like old YouTube montage videos in the bottom right corner?

171
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,300
You'll see such and such has begun playing Team Fortress 2.

172
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,740
Over and over again.

173
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,940
Over and over again.

174
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,500
Yay, I got the invite.

175
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,100
Okay.

176
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,780
Yes, I had to boot in.

177
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
Oh, I got it too!

178
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,960
Okay, bye.

179
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,520
Failed to find Lobby.

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,460
Okay, well, that's on you.

181
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,400
Okay.

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Mint.

183
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,800
Oh, I got it.

184
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,120
Alright.

185
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,120
Snuffy, what is...

186
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,340
Are you not inviting me?

187
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,960
Wait, are you not just...

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,220
Are you not called Snuffy?

189
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,080
What the fuck is your name on Steam?

190
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm...

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,940
It's Snum?

192
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,040
Snum?

193
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,400
Who the fuck is Snuffy?

194
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,200
Snum.

195
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,020
Okay, there is no Snum on my foot.

196
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Are you up here?

197
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,680
I see you!

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,500
I see you!

199
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm gonna message you.

200
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,600
Hello?

201
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,100
You're up.

202
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,300
Hello, I am here.

203
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:26,980
Hello!

204
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,020
Invite.

205
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm muting everybody in Discord.

206
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,740
I fucking love how it just blasts everyone's volume in this goddamn game.

207
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,040
Everyone is so peaky.

208
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,640
It's awful.

209
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,180
Oh.

210
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,340
Yes, get online or you're not going on vacation with us.

211
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,260
You're gonna be left behind on a sloppy vacation.

212
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,980
You're gonna be left behind?

213
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,560
How do I use my passport?

214
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,620
Oh, left click.

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,740
Oh, left.

216
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,900
I'm muting myself.

217
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,280
I'm putting myself on, though, now.

218
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,700
Oh, wow, I can customize myself.

219
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,580
Snum has joined!

220
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,000
Remember to, like, instead...

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,300
Instead of deafen, to just, like, un-deafen and turn us down so we can still see your feet.

222
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:03,780
Oh, yay.

223
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,040
But you have to promise not to...

224
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,160
So we'll know they're alive or not.

225
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,520
Yeah.

226
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,100
You have to promise not to actually turn me back up because I'm gonna be talking to my chat and I'm gonna be talking mad shit and it'd be awkward if you heard it.

227
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,380
Exactly.

228
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,400
Alright, now.

229
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:14,820
Alright.

230
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,540
Give me a sec.

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm gonna put on my makeup.

232
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,880
I gotta change myself.

233
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,380
Wait.

234
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,260
Which one should I?

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Should I be Donald Duck or should I be...

236
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,240
Give me a sec.

237
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,240
I gotta be angry.

238
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,080
This is a serious game for serious gamers.

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,120
I'll have to be Charlie Brown.

240
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,940
Maybe Charlie Brown.

241
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,140
Wait.

242
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,280
Which way around are you doing?

243
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,220
You're muting everyone else, right?

244
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,700
Yeah.

245
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,180
Yeah.

246
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,860
I'm turning everyone else down but I'll still see the foogies.

247
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,580
I can't wait for like in four months from now when we do another game via Discord and we can't figure out why we're trying to make it again.

248
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,440
That's always fun.

249
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:52,840
Yeah.

250
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,420
That's me.

251
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,860
That's how I feel right now.

252
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,260
Whoa.

253
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,600
Your stance.

254
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,800
I've never played this game.

255
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,140
Actually, I've never played this game.

256
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,880
I haven't watched anyone play this game.

257
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,400
I don't know anything about what's going on.

258
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,700
I've watched people play this game.

259
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,620
It's going to be very exciting.

260
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,660
But...

261
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,500
I haven't...

262
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,260
I haven't like played it myself.

263
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,760
I waited till this very moment to play this game.

264
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,360
Me too!

265
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,220
The first sloppy experience?

266
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,780
Yeah!

267
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,440
That's amazing.

268
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Did you two play it yet or no?

269
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,620
I played it when it came out.

270
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,380
So if we can be like...

271
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,740
Snuffy and I can be like the tour guides.

272
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,200
Okay.

273
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,620
Alright.

274
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,140
You're so mad.

275
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,880
Wait, this is like...

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,640
All of us.

277
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,620
This is so good.

278
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,260
Press R for emo.

279
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,200
This is how I feel.

280
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,660
No!

281
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,860
Wait, you have glasses.

282
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:42,880
Yeah.

283
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm cool.

284
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,540
How did you get glasses?

285
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,780
How do I take...

286
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,200
Oh, there we go.

287
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,640
Snuffy, if you've been talking, we can't hear you.

288
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,680
It's not that we don't love you and we're ignoring you or anything.

289
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,080
It's literally we can't hear you.

290
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,800
You're just kind of Dreamworks facing at us silently.

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,580
Yeah, it's actually really freaky.

292
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Oh, there you go.

293
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,440
Oh, oh, oh.

294
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,720
Hello?

295
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
You're talking now.

296
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,320
What...

297
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,260
How are you...

298
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,500
Dead?

299
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:03,900
Ew!

300
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,280
Ew!

301
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,260
Okay, there we go.

302
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,960
We can hear you now.

303
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,080
Yeah, we can hear you.

304
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,600
Sorry.

305
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,500
It's okay.

306
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,700
Sunglasses.

307
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,160
I want sunglasses.

308
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,820
Oh, there it is.

309
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,460
I see it.

310
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't take my glasses.

311
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,020
I played this game a little bit.

312
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,900
I played it and I got really obsessed with trying to like...

313
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,180
eat it.

314
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,060
Because I thought it was like a cozy game.

315
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,640
And then I realized that it's a game of nothing but trials and tribulations.

316
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,140
It's not cozy?

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,100
No, apparently it's not cozy.

318
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:34,980
No.

319
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,180
Wait, can I practice you?

320
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,700
It's quite stressful.

321
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,280
It's quite stressful.

322
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,760
Wait, Sunglasses.

323
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,460
You're being quiet.

324
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,460
Can you turn up...

325
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,140
Is it possible to turn up people's volumes in game right now?

326
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,540
Uh, yeah.

327
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,000
Hit escape.

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,220
Is this better?

329
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,720
Although...

330
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,780
Oh, Jesus Christ!

331
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,160
No!

332
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:46,780
No!

333
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,320
No!

334
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,520
No!

335
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,200
Keep your own volume!

336
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,960
Holy fuck!

337
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,500
What happened?

338
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,700
Okay, um...

339
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
I'll turn you up on my end.

340
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,560
It's okay.

341
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,580
Keep your own volume.

342
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh my God.

343
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,100
Okay, okay.

344
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm deaf.

345
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,300
Wait, how could he...

346
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,080
He's under here.

347
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,300
Alright, I'm ready.

348
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,500
How do you turn up individual people?

349
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,140
Uh, hit escape.

350
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,760
Top right corner.

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,320
Press escape.

352
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,300
Oh, I see.

353
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,640
I see.

354
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,460
Okay.

355
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,060
I have to turn everyone down to like 30%.

356
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,660
Otherwise, I'd go fucking deaf in this game.

357
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,540
It's not that loud on my end.

358
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,220
Yeah, me neither.

359
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,660
Yeah, you guys sound great.

360
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,540
Yeah.

361
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,420
Alright, let's see.

362
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,060
Do you wish to know how to climb?

363
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,560
Yes, how do you guys?

364
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:30,700
Oh!

365
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,800
Oh, there's a trial!

366
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,020
I didn't realize.

367
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,400
Wait, there's a rope!

368
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh, look at her go!

369
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm just gonna skip ahead.

370
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,180
Here we go!

371
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,940
I'm ready!

372
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,260
Cowabunga, dude!

373
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm ready for my vacation!

374
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,860
Oh, okay.

375
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,540
And the big thing that you can do is when you're on like top of a cliff, if you right click, you hold out your arm and you lift your friends up.

376
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,440
Oh!

377
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:48,860
Like that.

378
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah.

379
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,540
Wait, what do you do?

380
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,780
You just hold out your hand?

381
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,440
I've got your...

382
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,720
Oh, okay.

383
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,460
Yeah, right click and you like lift people up.

384
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,620
Oh, right click.

385
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,180
Oh, okay.

386
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,720
Yeah, you literally don't have to...

387
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh, look!

388
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,480
No!

389
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,120
Wait, did you just push her off?

390
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,560
No, she fell.

391
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,040
She fell off.

392
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:06,860
Jake.

393
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,340
There's actually a mod where you can push people off, too.

394
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,580
That's fucked up.

395
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
I wanna play that mod.

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,620
That's like the PvP edition.

397
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,360
Do the rocks not matter?

398
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,140
I'm just climbing.

399
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,960
I wish I got the Mount Everest mod.

400
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,340
No, you can climb any surface except if it's raining and then you'll take more.

401
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,060
It's worth pointing out now, but the game doesn't tell you so you can get fucked.

402
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,380
No, there's fall damage!

403
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,340
Just not here.

404
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,980
There is fall damage.

405
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,980
Guys, it's fine.

406
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,240
There's no fall damage.

407
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,260
There's no fall damage.

408
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,460
There's no fall damage.

409
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,100
Yeah, see?

410
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,500
Wee!

411
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,060
Yeah, see?

412
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,240
Wee!

413
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,580
I'm okay!

414
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,560
Yeah, definitely.

415
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,860
You should definitely get straight into the game and jump off a cliff.

416
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,480
It'll be fine.

417
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:44,860
Okay!

418
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,400
Yay!

419
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,480
I'll catch your phone.

420
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,360
That's what my tour guide told us.

421
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:49,680
Thank you.

422
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:59,660
You know, like, yesterday I was watching videos of, like, um, uh, freakiest cave-climbing depths and everything.

423
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Oh my God, that's- Are you gonna live that today?

424
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:09,460
And then they are talking- cave diving, so they are like- cave diving, you know, like, those we'd dive even like- We know what- what?

425
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,100
Cave- Cave-divers, people who go into caves and they start diving.

426
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,380
Yeah, and they start diving in caves, you know?

427
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,960
They just like, spin stuff!

428
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
Yeah, you know, caves, caves, caves?

429
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,160
They dive?

430
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,320
They're called cave divers.

431
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,940
They live in those caves and they also dive too.

432
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,500
That's why it's called cave divers.

433
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,860
That's like crazy.

434
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,840
Oh my god, we didn't even hear what happened yet.

435
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,700
We only knew that they were cave diving.

436
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,340
Yeah, I'm talking about cave diving.

437
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,340
You know what that is?

438
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,860
No, I don't know.

439
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,360
Tell me.

440
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,120
Tell me.

441
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,240
Okay, so it's like you go in a cave and you like dive in the cave.

442
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,220
And that's like water and that's why I have to dive.

443
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,520
It's like sometimes people die in there because they're in the water.

444
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,460
Wait, do they die or do they die?

445
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,820
Because they go into the cave and they die.

446
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,840
And then they die.

447
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,260
They should have just brought the V with them.

448
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,080
What the heck?

449
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,280
And it's gonna... Okay, so like...

450
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,780
And one of the incidents because of the tour guide's fault.

451
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,500
So like, that's what I mean.

452
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,000
It's gonna be all I have to die.

453
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,880
Wait, what the... What the... Holy shit, that was a huge detour just to blame me.

454
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,900
I was like, what's the point of this story?

455
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah, you like went on like a 10-minute tangent for that.

456
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,080
Holy moly.

457
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,880
I thought you were just gonna describe how you have a new fear from it or something.

458
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,820
It was a crazy video, though.

459
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,720
It was...

460
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,780
What was it?

461
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,060
The Nutty Putty Cave?

462
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,300
Yeah, because the tour guide was like, we should go dive in this cave.

463
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,840
You know, to go cave diving.

464
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,000
And they're like, oh, it's very dangerous.

465
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,680
But he's like, no, we got this.

466
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,720
And then every... And then everyone died.

467
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,060
The end.

468
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,460
And then everyone died.

469
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,440
How did you do your emotes, Adam?

470
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,520
You press R?

471
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,080
Oh, R?

472
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,520
Nice.

473
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,040
Okay, you guys can swear to tell I just woke up, right?

474
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,700
Yeah, that's what it's... That's what it feels like.

475
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,680
It has nothing on it.

476
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah.

477
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,480
I guess we all have little, like, Girl Scout badges.

478
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,380
Yeah, there's a mirror.

479
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,620
You gotta practice dancing.

480
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,340
Whoa!

481
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh, no.

482
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,120
I think everybody's like drunk at the airport.

483
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,160
I don't know what's going on.

484
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,020
We're in one of those...

485
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,180
Oh, I'm silent airports.

486
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
I don't know.

487
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,900
Don't worry, guys.

488
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,520
We're gonna see the last...

489
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,960
Getting wasted at the Las Vegas airport.

490
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,660
Me?

491
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,720
Could it be me?

492
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,860
In that Firefly book.

493
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,120
Lord of the Flies.

494
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,640
What are you talking...

495
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,300
Get this girl a muzzle.

496
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:07,960
Shut up!

497
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,120
Lord of the Flies!

498
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,520
What is...

499
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,560
What is bro yapping about?

500
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,960
Are you ready?

501
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,740
I'm going to board us.

502
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,760
Yeah, let's board the flies.

503
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,180
Do we need to show our past floor?

504
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
What's happening?

505
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,640
Why are we like this?

506
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,900
I feel like I caught the stupid from Doki.

507
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,440
Please, caught the stupid!

508
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,920
We're scouts, you better shape up or we're not gonna make it.

509
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,940
Oh my god, we're dead?

510
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,520
Wait!

511
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
What happened?

512
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,960
It is Lord of the Flies!

513
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,160
I haven't seen any caves.

514
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,660
I told you it is Lord of the Flies!

515
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,400
We are the boys in the Lord of the Flies book!

516
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,680
I can't believe...

517
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I thought we were going for a hike for real.

518
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,220
This is what this is about.

519
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,040
Oh my god, we're actually...

520
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,460
Okay, how to not die?

521
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm reading the book.

522
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,100
Don't worry.

523
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,900
I can read.

524
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,560
How do I flip the page?

525
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,200
Sure.

526
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,140
Okay.

527
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,720
Day one.

528
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,860
Okay, okay.

529
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,220
I caught the fire.

530
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,440
Never abandon a friend in need.

531
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,160
Conch.

532
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,060
Wait, I can throw it.

533
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,600
The plane is still hot.

534
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,040
Be careful.

535
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,240
Oh wait, you can run!

536
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,680
Guys, you can run!

537
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,300
Hey Doki, come and touch this with your face.

538
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,400
Wait, where'd my...

539
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,700
Where'd my horn go?

540
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,300
What's that thing?

541
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,360
Figure out how to...

542
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,060
Is that the duolingo bird?

543
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,860
Towards my voice.

544
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,980
I don't know.

545
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,280
I don't know what this is.

546
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,700
His name is Bing Bong.

547
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,620
There you go.

548
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,180
Oh!

549
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,200
Bing Bong!

550
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,760
Bing Bong!

551
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:43,980
Bing Bong!

552
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm throwing.

553
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,260
Ah!

554
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,220
Oh my god, Doki!

555
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:47,920
Wow!

556
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,420
Wow!

557
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,600
Oh my god!

558
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,860
Oh my god!

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
Does anybody know first aid?

560
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,720
I have no idea how that happened.

561
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,100
Does anyone...

562
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,020
What did I slip?

563
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,500
Oh my god!

564
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,460
Can someone pee out?

565
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,200
Oh my god!

566
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,100
The man of war!

567
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,620
Jellyfish!

568
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,360
Everyone start peeing on me!

569
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,160
Oh!

570
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,760
Oh!

571
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,860
Isn't that how you do the...

572
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,820
Everyone start peeing!

573
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,980
Everyone...

574
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,740
Oh!

575
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,920
Oh my god!

576
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,680
Oh you guys!

577
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,780
Somebody help!

578
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,060
Oh no!

579
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,220
Somebody help me!

580
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,120
Oh no!

581
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,580
Stop!

582
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,300
Yo!

583
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,240
Sick flip!

584
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,080
Oh no!

585
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,240
You did it!

586
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,300
Oh no!

587
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,580
Someone help me!

588
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm stuck!

589
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,780
I'm stuck!

590
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,380
I'm stuck!

591
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm stuck!

592
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm stuck!

593
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,960
Sloppy!

594
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,980
Sloppy!

595
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,120
Sloppy!

596
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,900
Wait, how did you get the backpack?

597
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,540
Ew, there's one backpack and I took it.

598
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,980
You can just open it all in a pack.

599
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,400
You can just take what's in there.

600
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,220
It's not so great.

601
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,920
But I have a compass!

602
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,380
Oh nice!

603
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,260
Super useful!

604
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:46,920
Oh yeah!

605
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,000
We can just open it up!

606
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,380
Got us!

607
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,460
Oh wait, I'm getting unvoiced!

608
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:50,860
Look at the way you walked!

609
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm getting hungry!

610
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,180
I'm gonna get a coconut!

611
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,340
Oh what?

612
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,300
Oh, coconut!

613
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
Wait, is this a survival game?

614
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,140
Or...

615
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
Yeah, we have to climb.

616
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,660
You see that big mountain in the distance?

617
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,160
Yeah!

618
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,160
You gotta get up there!

619
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Yeah, and that's all we have to climb.

620
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,280
And that's...

621
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,900
Yeah, definitely.

622
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,780
Nothing after that.

623
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,760
How we win the game.

624
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,400
What's that?

625
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,100
Is that a crab?

626
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,440
Okay, there it goes.

627
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,360
She's grabbing the coconut.

628
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,180
Oh no, that's another thing that I slipped on.

629
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,620
She's gonna...

630
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,800
No!

631
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,380
No!

632
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,600
Don't worry, I got you!

633
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,580
Did I get them?

634
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,820
Don't worry, land on us!

635
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,520
We got you!

636
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,200
She did it?

637
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh, there's another one!

638
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,360
Oh, climb!

639
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,260
Climbing?

640
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,620
Sorry, I was trying to break up with the coconut!

641
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:31,920
I don't know!

642
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,220
Fuck you!

643
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm eating it right now!

644
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Okay...

645
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,700
I wanna eat it!

646
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,540
Oh, what's up?

647
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,160
How do you climb the tree?

648
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,480
I wanna be a little monkey.

649
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,300
Same like the...

650
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,040
Same as the cliff.

651
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,920
Oh, okay.

652
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,480
Climbing?

653
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:48,980
Climbing?

654
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Oh, here we go.

655
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,620
Get the coconut when you're at the top!

656
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,440
I'm gonna get it!

657
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,200
I'm gonna get it!

658
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,480
Don't get it, Doki!

659
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:54,780
No!

660
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,520
It's mine!

661
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,220
No!

662
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,420
I broke my leg.

663
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,740
Wait, it doesn't heal me.

664
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,240
No, no.

665
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,680
You need bandages for that.

666
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:13,820
It doesn't heal you.

667
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,460
Uh-oh.

668
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,440
You actually fell off the tree!

669
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,580
I live, though.

670
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:17,980
I live.

671
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,100
Probably because I landed on your big ass head.

672
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,720
That's it!

673
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,420
I'm climbing this other tree!

674
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,320
I wanna taste the sweet, sweet, succulent coconut, please!

675
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,540
And I have a broken leg.

676
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,320
I ate the other coconut, too.

677
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,160
Wait, there's another coconut!

678
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,580
There's a flying jellyfish!

679
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,320
Do you see that floating jellyfish?

680
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah, there's a floating fish!

681
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,200
As long as it's not just me.

682
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,720
Okay, yeah.

683
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,020
I think Doki hit me kinda hard with that coconut or something.

684
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,880
We need more coconut or we'll die!

685
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:44,940
Stop!

686
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,520
Well, there are other things other than coconuts.

687
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,140
Stop!

688
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,380
Stop!

689
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,900
Stop!

690
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,600
Stop!

691
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,340
Stop!

692
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,060
That is unnatural!

693
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,940
You will see my Hello Kitty luggage anywhere.

694
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,760
I lost it on a flight.

695
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,240
What you got in your luggage, Snuffy?

696
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:00,640
Yeah.

697
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,320
Do demons come out at 9?

698
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,000
Wait, wait, this is literally like the age-old question.

699
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,560
Like, if you got stranded on an island, what are you taking?

700
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,380
The only thing is we need to stick together because if we don't, the Scoutmaster will be mad at us.

701
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:12,960
Who?

702
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
And then who do you think...

703
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,560
It's like, who do you think will survive on an island?

704
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,020
What's that?

705
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Not me, that's for sure.

706
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,620
Or he broke my leg.

707
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,480
I found a something.

708
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,620
Oh, luggage!

709
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,260
Oh, look!

710
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,140
Dookie, there's food in this bush.

711
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:27,940
Oh!

712
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,300
We need to test it to make sure it's not poisonous, though.

713
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:31,800
Don't worry.

714
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,620
There's a trail mix over here and some bandages.

715
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,020
Oh, oh, I think...

716
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,420
Is that radish a heal root?

717
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah.

718
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
You guys need this.

719
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:40,720
Yeah.

720
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,440
Wait a minute, I ate this already.

721
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,420
It's not poisonous.

722
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,500
If you're hungry.

723
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,640
What's that?

724
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,980
What's that sound?

725
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,100
Take the medicinal root and eat it, Dookie.

726
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,780
You will feel better.

727
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,840
Oh, okay.

728
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,980
Cluster shroom.

729
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,640
This is an ancient herb.

730
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,500
I'm gonna feed it to you.

731
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:52,700
This is an ancient herb.

732
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,540
With medicinal properties.

733
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
I already ate it.

734
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:56,840
Oh.

735
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,140
Wait, am I still hungry?

736
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,000
Is the shrimp good?

737
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,820
I can hear.

738
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,480
Are you still hungry?

739
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,380
Yeah, the shrimp's good.

740
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,140
I already ate one.

741
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,220
Okay.

742
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,020
Excuse me, but mushrooms are really dangerous, you guys.

743
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,200
We should mess around.

744
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,540
Does this thing hurt me?

745
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,740
No, we have Dookie to poison test it.

746
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,320
I got a sports drink.

747
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,460
What's that sound?

748
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,160
Pick up.

749
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Pick up.

750
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,360
Pick up.

751
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,420
Pick up.

752
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,860
What's the music for?

753
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,980
You guys?

754
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,680
Where are you guys?

755
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,860
What's the music?

756
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,650
Where are you guys?

757
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,450
Hello.

758
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,410
Climb?

759
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,030
Are we climbing?

760
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:50,770
Oh.

761
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,410
Hi.

762
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,610
Oh, can I have that?

763
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,210
Alright.

764
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,390
Alright.

765
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,050
Where do we go?

766
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,730
That was really good.

767
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,050
Oh, thanks.

768
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:00,950
Thanks.

769
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,150
You're welcome.

770
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,250
How many people have died on this mountain?

771
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,490
There's so many things.

772
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,530
Yeah, there's so much luggage around it.

773
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,210
I think it's just all our luggage.

774
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,910
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,890
Watch this.

776
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,630
Give us a head start.

777
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,730
She's so nice.

778
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,390
Good technique.

779
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,350
We definitely should have used that there, yeah.

780
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,610
Yay!

781
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,770
I'm a hero, everyone.

782
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,590
Dookie might have broken her other leg if we didn't use that.

783
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,990
Is this here?

784
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,290
Yeah, exactly.

785
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,770
It's for the sake of my leg.

786
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,510
I'm gonna eat that.

787
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,130
Oh my god, yes.

788
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,450
And you just knew that there was more luggage.

789
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:34,970
Alright.

790
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,470
I'm no longer hungry.

791
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,890
Oh my god, wait.

792
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,170
I'm glad to hear it.

793
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,710
Oh my god, wait.

794
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,630
Oh my god.

795
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:41,830
Oh my god.

796
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,070
Thanks.

797
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,150
Look at that.

798
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:44,690
I'm cured.

799
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,410
Watch that urchin, it will poison you again.

800
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,070
Oh, it will?

801
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,510
Okay, I watched it before.

802
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,070
I don't think this is the best route to go.

803
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,310
We're going like the absolute worst.

804
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,330
Wait, do you have space in the inventory, Snuffy?

805
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,470
What was that green thing?

806
00:24:59,650 --> 00:24:59,770
No, I don't.

807
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,670
But we can put it in Lemu's backpack.

808
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,690
Oh, that's true.

809
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,410
That's true.

810
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,730
I won't put this in the backpack.

811
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,030
I'm grabbing it.

812
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,770
I'm grabbing it.

813
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,250
You gonna root around in my backpack?

814
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,210
Okay, be gentle.

815
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,210
Yeah, I got it.

816
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,470
I got stuck in the backpack.

817
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,350
I think you- someone took something out of it.

818
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,650
You stole my fucking drink.

819
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,730
I think I'm falling.

820
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,810
I just needed this so bad.

821
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,190
You're fine.

822
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,730
Wait, where are we supposed to go?

823
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,390
Up here?

824
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,930
Uh, there are a few different pathways.

825
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,370
I've not played this one yet.

826
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,990
I've got the lantern.

827
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,550
Oh, cool.

828
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,910
I'm probably this way.

829
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,970
Wait.

830
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,850
Wait, where- Who said that?

831
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,410
This way.

832
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,530
Oh, middle mouse button you can like point.

833
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,270
With your fingers.

834
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,970
Yeah, like this way.

835
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,050
Oh, really?

836
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:38,750
Wait.

837
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,530
Oh, cool.

838
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,790
Oh, what?

839
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,510
Oh, that's what that was!

840
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,290
Oh no, Tachi!

841
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,310
I thought she was down- I thought she- I can dig it.

842
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,530
How do you go down?

843
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,230
Oh, you just crawl like that.

844
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,510
I thought I can dig it.

845
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,510
Wait.

846
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,930
Guys, I'm slow.

847
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,930
I don't want energy up!

848
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,430
Okay, I need help.

849
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,950
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

850
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,030
Toki, I've got a remedy for you.

851
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,830
I'm going!

852
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,430
I'm going!

853
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,430
I'm climbing!

854
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,290
Uh-oh.

855
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,030
Uh-oh.

856
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,290
I'm going the wrong way!

857
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,670
I'm gonna lose energy!

858
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,650
You're fine, you're fine.

859
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,270
Grab my hand!

860
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,330
Grab my hand!

861
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,470
No, grab my hand!

862
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,890
No, grab my hand!

863
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,910
Grab my hand!

864
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:34,930
My hand!

865
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,370
Wait, who are we asking?

866
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,670
Where the fuck is Snuffy?

867
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,450
Oh, no, she's below.

868
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,070
She's below.

869
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,270
Grab my hand!

870
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,110
Grab my hand!

871
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:47,950
My hand!

872
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,830
My hand!

873
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,630
My hand!

874
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,950
Grab my hand!

875
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,390
I'm pushing!

876
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,230
Don't get up!

877
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,930
I will push you down!

878
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,410
I will push you off this cliff!

879
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:58,610
Snuffy!

880
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,650
Snuffy!

881
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,830
Grab my hand!

882
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,270
Snuffy!

883
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,490
Come on, Snuffy!

884
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,890
I will push you off!

885
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,690
Snuffy!

886
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,570
Grab my hand!

887
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,310
Grab my hand!

888
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,350
Grab my hand!

889
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,570
And Rapunzel, let down your hair!

890
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,310
Grab my hand!

891
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,670
Grab my hand, stop me, grab my hand!

892
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,410
I think I'm...

893
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,770
I think I'm...

894
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,750
Grab my hand, stop me, what happened?

895
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,370
I think I'm...

896
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,690
Oh, God.

897
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,130
We're gonna make it gas.

898
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,450
We're gonna...

899
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,510
What's that mean?

900
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,510
That means we fucked around for so long, but the fog is already coming.

901
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,270
Wait, what does that mean?

902
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,630
Oh, no.

903
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,910
I need a hand, someone let down the golden hand.

904
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,570
Wait, wait.

905
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,150
Someone let down the golden hand.

906
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,310
Look at you, wow, you got the moves.

907
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,310
You must stop.

908
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,810
Stop for your own dead queen.

909
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,270
Please.

910
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,570
Are you good?

911
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,690
Grab my hand.

912
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,790
Grab my hand.

913
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,850
There's nobody...

914
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,690
Oh, my God, Blimey, you're gonna fall.

915
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,090
That's so scary.

916
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,950
Oh, my God, that totally doesn't look like you can make it.

917
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,710
This looks like pro gamer moves, and I'm a newbie.

918
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,990
Oh, my God, my heart.

919
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,650
I'm okay.

920
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,070
It's not...

921
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,390
No, this is not a good route.

922
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,170
Did we mess up?

923
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,810
Did we mess up?

924
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,090
Should we climb down here and try a different way?

925
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,730
I don't know.

926
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,050
So, we want to look for any ledges that have this sandy texture, because that means we can climb it.

927
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,530
If it doesn't have the orange, then we can't, like, stand there.

928
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,490
So, we want to try, like, up here has, like...

929
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:44,990
There's, like, sort of...

930
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,690
Oh, the sand.

931
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,030
Whoa.

932
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,850
Wait, there's, like, something up here.

933
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:49,650
Do you guys see that?

934
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,330
Oh, yeah.

935
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,870
Maybe we can make that.

936
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,130
Okay, who is the one that makes the gun thing?

937
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,390
Wait, I have this.

938
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,450
Is this helpful?

939
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,090
I have this.

940
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,350
Okay, that's definitely not...

941
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,670
Okay, okay.

942
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,870
I got up here.

943
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,170
Okay, okay.

944
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:08,650
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,990
Let me grab your hand.

946
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:10,890
I come in.

947
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,770
Grab my hand.

948
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,470
Grab my hand instead.

949
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:13,930
You're really...

950
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,830
I'm too close!

951
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,810
Grab my hand instead!

952
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,230
I have an idea.

953
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,710
Dookie, you made it, like, halfway.

954
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,590
Okay, I have an idea.

955
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,050
Wait, is this not a dead end?

956
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,170
Oh.

957
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,870
I don't...

958
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,930
Maybe we should...

959
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,610
Oh, sorry, I forgot!

960
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,950
It's a dead end, you guys!

961
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,430
Is there nothing up there?

962
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,090
Wait, wait, wait.

963
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,270
Yeah, there's nothing up there.

964
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,070
It's a dead end.

965
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,350
I'm not gonna die.

966
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,510
I don't think you went up there.

967
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,270
I don't think you went that way.

968
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:49,690
I don't know.

969
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,210
Where'd she go?

970
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,430
Oh, you went this way.

971
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:52,450
Okay.

972
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,190
Uh...

973
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,930
How'd she get over there?

974
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,470
Uh...

975
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,490
Not even...

976
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,870
Oh no, we're cave diving!

977
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,530
Where did Lime go?

978
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,270
Did she leave us?

979
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,090
Oh, we're back here.

980
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:07,890
No, I'm down here.

981
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,390
I'm here.

982
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,130
I'm coming to you!

983
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:10,730
Snuff!

984
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:11,930
Snuff!

985
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,750
Yeah, yeah.

986
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,370
Uh-oh.

987
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,810
I'm not coming to you.

988
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,370
I'm sorry.

989
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:15,990
I'm sorry.

990
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,850
Oh, I'm scared.

991
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,630
This is it.

992
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,410
This is it for me.

993
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,570
Wait, I gotta do it.

994
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,810
Wait, I gotta do it.

995
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,670
I think we wanna go slightly around.

996
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,750
This kinda seems like...

997
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,470
Butts.

998
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:28,870
I don't know.

999
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,210
Alright, I'm gonna...

1000
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,670
You go tell us where to go.

1001
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,830
I didn't remember the V.

1002
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,530
Oh, a terrible idea to do.

1003
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,770
I'm drinking my drink.

1004
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,430
Don't push me.

1005
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,230
Don't do it.

1006
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,470
None of us are doing great.

1007
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,390
Trap my hand!

1008
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,530
Trap my hand!

1009
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,670
Won't you take a poor sinners hand?

1010
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,910
Trap my hand!

1011
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,290
I'm gonna try a different way.

1012
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,250
I think we should come down.

1013
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,270
Trap my hand!

1014
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:57,490
Trap my hand!

1015
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,230
Oh, look at her go!

1016
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,530
Are you ready?

1017
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,210
Are you ready?

1018
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:00,830
Ready!

1019
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,170
Wait, where's Loma?

1020
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,430
Conservation center!

1021
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,510
Oh, she went the other way.

1022
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,210
Why did we not go through this bridge?

1023
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,810
Oh, be careful about this bridge!

1024
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,350
There's nothing.

1025
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,450
There's a bridge?

1026
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,070
Wait, what?

1027
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,950
Uh-oh, I'm here and echoing.

1028
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm climbing.

1029
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm climbing.

1030
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,740
I'm climbing to you.

1031
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,340
Over here.

1032
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,300
Thanks.

1033
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:28,780
Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,880
Transformation Central.

1035
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,100
Oh, are you sorry?

1036
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,820
Transformation Central.

1037
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,700
Can you feel it?

1038
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,260
Are you hungry?

1039
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,520
Oh, you're little.

1040
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,080
Is it okay?

1041
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

1042
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,360
That's a good one.

1043
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,540
Wait, where'd it go?

1044
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:47,900
Totally.

1045
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,860
I fed it to you.

1046
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,680
I can feed it to you.

1047
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,420
Oh, yeah, thanks.

1048
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,400
That's kind of scary because then you can just feed people intentional poison.

1049
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,560
It's just a little jump scare.

1050
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,980
We should do that to Doki.

1051
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,280
We should do that to Doki.

1052
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking.

1053
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,340
We just launch ourselves.

1054
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,700
Okay.

1055
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,420
Okay, let me demonstrate.

1056
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,920
Wait, where did they go, guys?

1057
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,280
How did you guys cave dive?

1058
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,500
Wait, are they in there?

1059
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,780
Wait, guys, you know what happens when you cave and dive?

1060
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,640
You cave and die.

1061
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,780
You cave and die.

1062
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:28,860
Oh, yeah.

1063
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,980
Nutty putty cave.

1064
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,520
I'm glad I brought the nutter butters to the nutty buddy.

1065
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,580
Are you guys, like, hiding from us?

1066
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,200
I can't tell.

1067
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,960
They're creeping me out.

1068
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,940
Snuffy, I'm scared.

1069
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,800
They sound like they're, like, in a treehouse.

1070
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,180
Oh, I see them.

1071
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,820
I see them.

1072
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,260
I see them.

1073
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:43,980
They're over here.

1074
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,420
Oh, okay, okay.

1075
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,060
How'd you guys... We have made, like, literally no progress.

1076
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,680
No, we haven't, actually.

1077
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,120
Oh, my God.

1078
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,920
Oh, my God.

1079
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,620
Oh, my monitor died for, like, five seconds.

1080
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,840
Oh, no.

1081
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,020
Wait, can I walk here?

1082
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,640
Oh, I can't.

1083
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,740
Oh, that's good.

1084
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,620
So I can walk here because it's sand?

1085
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,340
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1086
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,340
Okay.

1087
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,800
Okay.

1088
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,840
Where are we going?

1089
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,240
I thought you guys were supposed to be tour guiding us.

1090
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,860
We just got abandoned.

1091
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,740
Every scout for themselves in this troop.

1092
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,720
I can't tell where the hell they are.

1093
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,960
There's another monster.

1094
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, I see it.

1095
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,620
We're over here.

1096
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,240
Hello.

1097
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,300
Thank you.

1098
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,480
The bungle shroom.

1099
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,160
All right, I'm climbing up.

1100
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,780
I'm a little better now.

1101
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,040
Has anybody sampled a bungle shroom?

1102
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,680
Is it good?

1103
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Oh, yeah.

1104
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,660
It was okay.

1105
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,580
I ate that.

1106
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,220
Hello.

1107
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,660
Our poison...

1108
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,640
This is a trustworthy source.

1109
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,320
Pick up my hand.

1110
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:50,600
Pick up my hand.

1111
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm too late.

1112
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,460
Pick up my hand.

1113
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,340
Okay.

1114
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,520
We're climbing.

1115
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,500
Hold my hand.

1116
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
Oh, you don't want to touch my hand.

1117
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,040
I don't.

1118
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Oh my gosh, we're actually making it up the mountain.

1119
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,680
Oh, yay.

1120
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,000
Laimu, thank you so much for grabbing my hand.

1121
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,280
You're welcome.

1122
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,200
This side of the mountain is so much better.

1123
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,640
Why did we not go on this side of the mountain?

1124
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,560
Why did we go the hard way?

1125
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,460
It was not obvious.

1126
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,120
Who chose the other realm?

1127
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,180
We're just trying to survive weather in the elements.

1128
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,240
I'll follow you.

1129
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,580
I'm pulling up this way.

1130
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,780
That's a bad thing to do.

1131
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,040
Wait, yeah.

1132
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
When did Doki start eating?

1133
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,740
I don't know.

1134
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,840
Wait, there's a bridge here.

1135
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,160
Thank you.

1136
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,160
Do not...

1137
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,440
One at a time on the bridge.

1138
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,480
One at a time on the bridge.

1139
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:40,800
Oh.

1140
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,940
How do you get up there?

1141
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,860
Just climb on it.

1142
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,240
But wait until Doki's off.

1143
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,160
Alternatively, you could jump up and down on it to fuck with her.

1144
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,940
But that's kind of mean.

1145
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,320
You would never do that, right?

1146
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:51,840
No.

1147
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,960
Wait, I'm going to do that.

1148
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,400
Come on.

1149
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,350
You're not even looking at us.

1150
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,870
You don't know what's going on here.

1151
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,690
Thank you.

1152
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,410
I didn't do anything.

1153
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,430
It was your fat ass that made it loose.

1154
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,190
Maybe my butt is just way too big.

1155
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,430
Nothing didn't sink when I was on it.

1156
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,310
I can tell from the bottom.

1157
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,150
I can tell when someone fucks up.

1158
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,190
Okay, you'll have to hear it.

1159
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,990
I'm going up this pole.

1160
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,570
Take my hand, Doki.

1161
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,070
Take my hand.

1162
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,830
I don't think I'm going to make it, actually.

1163
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,910
I don't know where you are.

1164
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:42,970
Here.

1165
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,250
I'm going to drop a mushroom.

1166
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,370
I hope it helps you somehow.

1167
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,570
Oh.

1168
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,190
Ouch.

1169
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,010
Oh.

1170
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,630
I'm okay.

1171
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,530
Uh, there might be a spot on the side here.

1172
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,850
I could have made it if I had a little snack.

1173
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,050
I got my arm down.

1174
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,810
Uh, come up here.

1175
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,130
Alright.

1176
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:03,850
Yeah, this way.

1177
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,370
What's that sound?

1178
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,370
I'm coming up.

1179
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,490
I need a hand.

1180
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,130
I'm coming.

1181
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:09,870
My turn.

1182
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:12,730
No!

1183
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,090
No!

1184
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:13,730
No!

1185
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,050
No!

1186
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,010
Are you ever turning your back on Doki Bear?

1187
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,570
Oh, I see.

1188
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:19,910
I see.

1189
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,290
It's okay.

1190
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,390
She's got iron fever.

1191
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,670
She's going to kill us all.

1192
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,690
I can't believe she would try and murder me.

1193
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,350
That's fucked up.

1194
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,270
I'm going to try and get some food.

1195
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,750
Niches get stitches removed today.

1196
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,690
Keep your eyes open today.

1197
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,570
Keep your eyes open today.

1198
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,090
Peace and love.

1199
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,090
Peace and love.

1200
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,530
I don't know if I'll make it.

1201
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,530
Never mind, I give up.

1202
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,510
Oh, you're following.

1203
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,790
I don't know what you did.

1204
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,670
Oh, I believe in this.

1205
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,370
You do?

1206
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,410
Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1207
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,090
Wait, wait.

1208
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,050
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

1209
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,390
Wait, no, no, no.

1210
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:47,490
Oh.

1211
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,370
I already started.

1212
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,850
Oh, I made it!

1213
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:53,790
How?

1214
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,070
Maybe I'm so good at this game.

1215
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,830
Bungal Shroom.

1216
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,570
Yummy, yummy.

1217
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,150
On my tummy.

1218
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,710
Bungal Shroom.

1219
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,010
I've never met anyone as nice as you.

1220
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,030
Bungal Shroom.

1221
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,130
Where are you guys at?

1222
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,530
I'm heading down.

1223
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,770
I should be going up.

1224
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,710
Because that's the game.

1225
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,280
I'm climbing all on my own.

1226
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,240
I think I'll make it.

1227
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,120
There's some...

1228
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,360
Ah!

1229
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,080
Ah!

1230
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,520
Ah!

1231
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:36,960
Ah!

1232
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:39,590
Ah!

1233
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,620
Oh, gosh.

1234
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,860
I didn't...

1235
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,200
I didn't take any damage.

1236
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,440
How did that happen?

1237
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,200
I'll make it this time.

1238
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,200
You think?

1239
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,300
I didn't take any damage.

1240
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,920
Oh my god.

1241
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,820
Maybe actually I go...

1242
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,020
Maybe...

1243
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,360
Maybe I go...

1244
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,620
I'm scared.

1245
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:20,840
Ah!

1246
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,100
Maybe it's better I'm not there.

1247
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,280
Okay, alright, alright.

1248
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,920
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

1249
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,840
I'm so close, I'm so close!

1250
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,800
We have to do it together!

1251
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,440
Oh, I made it!

1252
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,240
I think... am I here?

1253
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,640
I'm here.

1254
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,940
I'm standing.

1255
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,780
I'm standing.

1256
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,520
This is not gonna... I don't think I can make it.

1257
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,600
Help me!

1258
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,080
Wait, Mint!

1259
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,680
Oh my god, you've been beneath me this whole time.

1260
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,480
Yeah, I was there, struggling for my afterlife.

1261
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,840
Lime never made it.

1262
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,760
Lime is... Lime, I hear her, yeah.

1263
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,060
No, she didn't.

1264
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,100
Lime would never.

1265
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,180
She's our tour guide.

1266
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,980
She's gone, guys.

1267
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,960
I'm waiting for you, where the fuck did you go?

1268
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,500
I don't know where you are.

1269
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,520
Wait, what do you mean waiting?

1270
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,320
I think we're above you.

1271
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,380
No, I think...

1272
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,100
Yeah, we're above you.

1273
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,340
No, you're not.

1274
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,120
Let's go to this bridge.

1275
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Right here.

1276
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,440
Let's go here.

1277
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
Wait, it's getting kind of foggy, no?

1278
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,940
I'm having some disability.

1279
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,460
It's getting a little dark over here.

1280
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,360
Um... Yeah, this area is very, very foggy.

1281
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,040
No, I think it's fine.

1282
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,240
This seems very safe.

1283
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,640
I'm gonna go up.

1284
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,980
I will come back towards my voice.

1285
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,920
I think I can see the bridge, and you're going towards the edge of the map.

1286
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,960
There's a... Oh.

1287
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,280
Oh.

1288
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,440
Is that bad?

1289
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,880
Um... I'm gonna go on the bridge.

1290
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,240
You're not productive.

1291
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:55,840
Ow.

1292
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,680
Okay, I'm on the bridge.

1293
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,540
I'm going this way.

1294
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,440
Oh, this way.

1295
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,700
Oh, I see you!

1296
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,520
I see you!

1297
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
There's another... Hi!

1298
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,400
Hello!

1299
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm climbing on this bridge, too!

1300
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,620
I'm already gone.

1301
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,480
Okay.

1302
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,060
Alright.

1303
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:13,940
I'm heading up.

1304
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,820
Wait, why am I not recovering stamina?

1305
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,360
Up here.

1306
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,740
Up here.

1307
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,760
Wait, there it is.

1308
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,360
Slow.

1309
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:18,980
Stop!

1310
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:19,740
Move!

1311
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,720
I'm trying to recover stamina!

1312
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm gonna hand up for you.

1313
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:22,900
Okay.

1314
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,180
Thank you!

1315
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,280
Oh, the fog is coming.

1316
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,360
We need to boogie.

1317
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,420
Snuffy, you coming?

1318
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,340
It's really, it's really bad.

1319
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,120
Take my hand!

1320
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,220
Okay, or not.

1321
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,240
Fine, whatever.

1322
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,500
I literally took your hand!

1323
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,560
Um, um, where's Snuffy?

1324
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:40,960
Snuffy!

1325
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,400
Oh, Jesus!

1326
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:41,920
Hey!

1327
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,200
Oh, I see you!

1328
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,200
He just like fell out of the sky.

1329
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,580
What's up?

1330
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:44,980
Take my hand!

1331
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,480
You yell, take my hand, and then take your hand away?

1332
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,740
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1333
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,360
That's...

1334
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,260
Uh, this way is pretty good.

1335
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, nice!

1336
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,880
Oh, wow!

1337
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,180
It's actually so clear!

1338
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,060
Oh, wow!

1339
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:02,820
It's actually so clear!

1340
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,240
The middle-aged uncle at the family gathering that keeps like being like, you got something on your shirt!

1341
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,440
Full champ!

1342
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,700
Full champ!

1343
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,260
I'm the boy scout where the parents were like, this...

1344
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,480
Join the boy scout will definitely change her behavior for the better!

1345
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,060
Alright!

1346
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,420
You're like, instead of sending her to Juvie, we could just send her to the boy scout.

1347
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:26,900
Donkey!

1348
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,120
Fuck you!

1349
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,080
Wait, how do we do this?

1350
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,640
I'm gonna fall here.

1351
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,780
Just jump!

1352
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,980
It's a leap of faith!

1353
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,100
Okay, I'm coming!

1354
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,820
Oh, I'm not up!

1355
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm coming!

1356
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,060
I'm coming!

1357
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,700
I got a hand up!

1358
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,780
You can do it!

1359
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,100
Yeah!

1360
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,580
I did!

1361
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,420
I did!

1362
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,740
You did it!

1363
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,880
Oh, I see.

1364
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,340
Snuffy!

1365
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,220
Okay, there you go.

1366
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,640
I'm so heavy!

1367
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:46,780
I'm sorry!

1368
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,420
You kinda almost got physicsed there.

1369
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:48,920
That was weird.

1370
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm starving.

1371
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,060
Oh, me too.

1372
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,560
I'm good.

1373
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,700
Wait.

1374
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,180
Oh, I just ate something bad.

1375
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,800
Oh, I'm dying.

1376
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,980
Oh, it was poisonous.

1377
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,880
You'll be fine.

1378
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,040
It's a temporary death.

1379
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,500
Okay.

1380
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,280
You look fine.

1381
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:02,980
Do I?

1382
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,120
I like temporary death.

1383
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,680
I feel...

1384
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
I feel pale.

1385
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,940
Maybe you're taking psychic damage.

1386
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,460
You're great.

1387
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,880
Oh, there's a suitcase over there.

1388
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,280
Oh, there's a suitcase!

1389
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,440
Yeah!

1390
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,720
Don't eat those berries!

1391
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,420
There's a flying rock in the sky!

1392
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,780
Wait, there's a coconut!

1393
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,520
There's a coconut!

1394
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,700
That's known as the sun.

1395
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,300
Oh...

1396
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,980
There's a coconut!

1397
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,960
Alright, someone else go out of this tree, because I know I'm not good at that.

1398
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,220
Okay, if you climb it, you can throw the coconut at everybody else.

1399
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,180
Oh, that's true!

1400
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:33,940
Yep.

1401
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,200
I gotta give her the incentive to do it.

1402
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,120
You can maybe climb this first and then jump onto the tree.

1403
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,720
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1404
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,580
What else is around here?

1405
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,000
Trick shot, trick shot.

1406
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,840
Who's gonna caught me?

1407
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,980
You just don't land on the giant spike.

1408
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,460
Uh, yeah, catching is definitely a thing that I can do.

1409
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,140
Wait, I saw another suitcase.

1410
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:48,600
Okay.

1411
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,500
Watch this.

1412
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,660
Oh!

1413
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,060
Oh!

1414
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,000
Okay.

1415
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,320
You got this, bro.

1416
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,920
You got this.

1417
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,080
Knock him down, knock him down.

1418
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,400
Yes!

1419
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,180
Got one!

1420
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,180
Oh!

1421
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,200
I did it, though.

1422
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,420
I did it.

1423
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,200
Okay.

1424
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,020
Cool.

1425
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,220
I did it, though.

1426
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,520
We're actually getting there.

1427
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,560
Wait, you guys need to cope for now.

1428
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,400
We're making it!

1429
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,200
We're making it!

1430
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:09,380
I can see the claw!

1431
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,060
I can get another one.

1432
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,300
I can see the claw!

1433
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,540
You can already?

1434
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,380
We're in it!

1435
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:13,960
Yeah, look!

1436
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,560
There's smoke!

1437
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,660
It's endgame!

1438
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,380
We're in endgame!

1439
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,960
That's definitely the end of the game!

1440
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,620
Wow!

1441
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,300
We're gonna command a new world record right here.

1442
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,900
I see mushrooms.

1443
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:23,540
Oh, there's bees!

1444
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,560
There's apples!

1445
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,880
There's lots of food here.

1446
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,560
How did a dead jellyfish get all the way up here?

1447
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,460
What the fuck?

1448
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,760
I don't know if those mushrooms are okay.

1449
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,480
The fog.

1450
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,700
Was the tide really that crazy?

1451
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,720
Wait, I'm hungry.

1452
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,780
Cluster shroom!

1453
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,840
I will take one for the team!

1454
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,180
I'm hungry too, but fine!

1455
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,160
Eat your fuckin' mushroom...

1456
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,660
Crisberry, whatever it is.

1457
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,600
It's fine.

1458
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,700
I'm gonna have a marshmallow.

1459
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,200
The mushroom is fine!

1460
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,500
Oh my god, we are getting mushroom...

1461
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,680
Marshmallows.

1462
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,080
Yeah, marshmallows.

1463
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,960
You don't even know which one you're talking about.

1464
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,440
Oh, it's not fine, actually.

1465
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,060
The mushroom is not okay.

1466
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,600
I'm so fine.

1467
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,300
Oh, no.

1468
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:56,980
Okay.

1469
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,680
You can eat one, but you definitely can't eat two!

1470
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,500
Oh, wow.

1471
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm really taking a lot of damage.

1472
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,560
Are you okay?

1473
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,200
Wait.

1474
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,060
Um...

1475
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,320
Wait, I'm taking like a lot of...

1476
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,500
Wait.

1477
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,180
Wait.

1478
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:09,940
Wait.

1479
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,380
Wait.

1480
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,920
Holy shit.

1481
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,880
Are you good?

1482
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,080
I don't...

1483
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,020
Where's...

1484
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,760
Where's Snuffy?

1485
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,920
Where's Snuffy?

1486
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,220
Where's Snuffy?

1487
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:18,960
Where is Snuffy?

1488
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,380
Help me!

1489
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:21,940
Snuffy?

1490
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,100
Help me!

1491
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, I made it.

1492
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,680
Okay, there she is.

1493
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,620
What the fuck are you all the way over there?

1494
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,280
How did she get up there?

1495
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,880
Look at her, she's right over here.

1496
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,400
Whoa, everything's going kind of dark.

1497
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,380
She's like right over here.

1498
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,560
Ah, Doki, can you take Min?

1499
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,720
I can't take her in the backpack.

1500
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,100
Sure.

1501
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,520
Uh, you wanna do it quick?

1502
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,420
Otherwise she'll cross and die.

1503
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:45,720
This is good.

1504
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,740
I can eat my sandwich.

1505
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,220
I don't sense your urgency here.

1506
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,240
I didn't know you could actually die.

1507
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,500
Oh.

1508
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,660
She's gonna let me...

1509
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:52,980
That's fucked up.

1510
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,640
That's fucked up, Doki.

1511
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,120
That's just fucked up.

1512
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,500
I should just press E now, huh?

1513
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,800
Don't worry, Snuffy will bring her back up.

1514
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,460
Yep.

1515
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,560
It's just awful.

1516
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,580
What kind of sandwich do you enjoy, baby?

1517
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,820
A classic.

1518
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,720
The fuck, hella physics?

1519
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,800
Wait, how is she gonna come back last?

1520
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,600
Um...

1521
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,520
We need like health.

1522
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,280
Oh, look at that!

1523
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,340
Where did Snuffy go?

1524
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,440
I don't know.

1525
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,120
Snuffy!

1526
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,600
My death stopped going down.

1527
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,940
If you're gonna get...

1528
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,920
Can you take the backpack here?

1529
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,480
Yeah, I can take it.

1530
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,400
How do you carry it?

1531
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:34,960
Oh!

1532
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,840
Oh, you're alive!

1533
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,220
Nevermind!

1534
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,780
Welcome back!

1535
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,020
What happened to me?

1536
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,580
You did it!

1537
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,460
I'm a little woozy.

1538
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,320
You got poisoned.

1539
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,400
I have no stamina, all poison, baby.

1540
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,340
Here's your bugle.

1541
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,300
Thank you!

1542
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,940
You're welcome.

1543
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,440
If you play that, something good might happen.

1544
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:53,980
Snuffy!

1545
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,680
How did you manage to end up all the way over there?

1546
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,860
And then all the way over there and never reach here?

1547
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Oh, that's actually impressive.

1548
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,120
Oh, that's actually impressive.

1549
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,820
The 20th Century Fox...

1550
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,780
Oh, Mint kinda died, so I had to pick Mint up.

1551
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,120
She looks good to me.

1552
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,040
I definitely died.

1553
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,540
She temporarily died.

1554
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,100
She temporarily died.

1555
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,460
I have no stamina, so it's hard for me to climb anything.

1556
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,840
I found good mushrooms.

1557
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:25,520
No!

1558
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,060
No!

1559
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,920
No, please.

1560
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,300
Sorry.

1561
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,760
They're good, I promise.

1562
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,580
No, it's okay.

1563
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,620
No, I'm fine.

1564
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,220
I'm okay.

1565
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,720
I think I know what might have happened.

1566
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,380
Whoa!

1567
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,840
There's some marshmallows!

1568
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,200
Yeah.

1569
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,080
Oh, is this Outer Wild?

1570
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:42,660
There's a chain marshmallow.

1571
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:44,640
Uh...

1572
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,060
Yeah.

1573
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:45,640
Kidding.

1574
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,980
I got a morale boost.

1575
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,820
Snuffy, can you hold the chain launcher?

1576
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:48,900
Whoa!

1577
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,240
Does anybody want to eat mushrooms?

1578
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,000
No, that's a bad mushroom.

1579
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:52,600
I'm kidding.

1580
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,960
Oh, drop it.

1581
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,680
I thought it was pretty good.

1582
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,580
Oh, day four!

1583
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,560
We made it!

1584
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,180
Yippee!

1585
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,940
Wait, what's this?

1586
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,360
There's a little man up here.

1587
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,100
Oh, and a scroll.

1588
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,900
What's a chain launcher?

1589
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,180
What's a chain launcher?

1590
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,000
Dear Diary.

1591
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,080
Bad news!

1592
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,420
Launching the chain.

1593
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,860
The ship captain made an oopsie, and we've wound up crashing on this mysterious island.

1594
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,720
Thankfully, mysterious islands are my specialty.

1595
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,400
With our whole troop working together, we'll reach the top of the peak and signal for help in no time.

1596
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,760
In the meantime, I'll take this opportunity to add some additional pages to my famous guidebook.

1597
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,360
Scoutmaster Myers.

1598
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:30,980
Whoa!

1599
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,380
Scoutmaster Myers must have definitely lived, right?

1600
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,540
Wait, I thought...

1601
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,360
Did you all cook your marshmallow?

1602
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,740
I thought you were the scoutmaster.

1603
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,760
Uh, that's a different scoutmaster.

1604
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,700
What does it do if we touched the ancient statue?

1605
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,200
That is how you revive your friends.

1606
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,440
That is how you revive your friends.

1607
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,100
Oh, like this.

1608
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,060
Wait, I need...

1609
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,540
That's it.

1610
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,740
And it makes a horcrux, right?

1611
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,780
Oh!

1612
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,460
I got a fairy lantern?

1613
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,860
Those are good.

1614
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,080
Oh, it's a revive thing, right?

1615
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,200
It heals you.

1616
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,400
Is anyone damaged?

1617
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,040
I have poison.

1618
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,480
Uh, poison?

1619
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,700
I don't know if it heals poison.

1620
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,540
Oh, it is.

1621
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,700
Yeah, it's healing me.

1622
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:12,860
Yay!

1623
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,160
What is my electricity bar?

1624
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,660
Oh, that's your extra stamina.

1625
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,180
The fairy likes me.

1626
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,240
Oh, did you just drink the sports drink?

1627
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,260
No, someone fed me that mushroom.

1628
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,960
Who was it?

1629
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,720
Oh my God.

1630
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,720
I didn't have one.

1631
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,380
Who was the mushroom?

1632
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,020
It was you, wasn't it?

1633
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,600
I know it was you.

1634
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,540
No, it wasn't.

1635
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,680
It wasn't me.

1636
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,940
I wanted the good mushroom.

1637
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,460
I promise.

1638
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,820
I promise.

1639
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,860
I didn't mean it.

1640
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,680
I promise I'm a vegan.

1641
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,400
I'm getting you to the class.

1642
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,000
No!

1643
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:44,720
No!

1644
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:45,680
Wait.

1645
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,540
You're also taking damage, Snuffy.

1646
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,660
Did you eat the mushroom too?

1647
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,020
I think Snuffy is eating poisonous mushrooms for fun.

1648
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,980
I don't know.

1649
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,520
It's everybody.

1650
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,840
She's trying to be so helpful.

1651
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,300
I'm just poisoning her friends.

1652
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,740
That's who tried to poison me earlier!

1653
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,420
Okay.

1654
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,340
All in favor.

1655
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,500
All in favor voting Snuffy.

1656
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,380
Say aye.

1657
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,140
Aye!

1658
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:05,800
Aye!

1659
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,340
We both snuffy off the island!

1660
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,020
We both snuffy off the island!

1661
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,280
Take your tiki torch and leave the island!

1662
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,140
If that's what you want, I'll just jump!

1663
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:17,840
No!

1664
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,220
That's so cool!

1665
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,960
Don't do it!

1666
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:20,920
Do it!

1667
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,200
Do it!

1668
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,880
Do it!

1669
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,540
That's right!

1670
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,300
Did she jump?

1671
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,460
What did you do?

1672
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,520
I did.

1673
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,700
Yeah, that's right.

1674
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,420
She did.

1675
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:33,940
She did.

1676
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,380
It was a unanimous vote.

1677
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,060
My move.

1678
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,860
Wait, where is she?

1679
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,220
Is she down...

1680
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,360
Oh shit!

1681
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:40,800
What?

1682
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,480
Oh my god, my monitor died so I thought I died.

1683
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,240
Is she down there?

1684
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,220
Oh, I see her!

1685
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,180
She's alive.

1686
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:47,940
She's alive.

1687
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,620
Oh yeah, sorry.

1688
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,160
No, I'm good.

1689
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,380
I thought you were like...

1690
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,300
For the minute you were Blair witching or some shit.

1691
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:53,980
That was awful.

1692
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,640
I don't like that.

1693
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,360
It's scary.

1694
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,120
Just staring at the wall.

1695
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,400
Wait, what can we...

1696
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,180
You guys are going crazy but I'm like Cabin in the Woods level snapping.

1697
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,840
What do we grab onto here?

1698
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,520
I'm scared.

1699
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:17,220
Okay, so when there's a little bit of a drop, you can actually turn and face the wall and like just grab it in increments when you're dropping down to stop your fall.

1700
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,480
Oh!

1701
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,420
What is this magic bean?

1702
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,100
Is it good?

1703
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,360
Oh my god, why not magic?

1704
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,780
Oh that looks good.

1705
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:22,920
Yeah.

1706
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,800
Tell me more about your magic bean, Dosey.

1707
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:25,080
Don't feed it to me.

1708
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,640
Don't feed it to me.

1709
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,380
The beans the fruit that makes you toot.

1710
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,360
How do you give it to people?

1711
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,580
There's like a little children's round about magic bean.

1712
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:30,980
Don't tell her.

1713
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,700
Don't tell her.

1714
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,340
Chat, don't tell her.

1715
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,000
I can't do anything with this magic bean.

1716
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,140
It just says it's magic.

1717
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,440
Oh, plant it.

1718
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,600
Oh, I can plant it?

1719
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,740
Okay, we gotta find a place for me to plant this magic bean.

1720
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,240
Why does the magic bean have to do anything for you?

1721
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,460
Do you hate whimsy?

1722
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,720
Perhaps it's just magical.

1723
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:47,780
Oh, why'd you draw?

1724
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,120
Oh!

1725
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:49,660
Oh!

1726
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:50,620
Oh!

1727
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,820
Whoa!

1728
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,020
I made that!

1729
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm a father!

1730
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,540
Dude!

1731
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,660
Oh, I get it!

1732
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,680
Oh, it's like James and the Giant Peach or something.

1733
00:50:59,820 --> 00:50:59,880
Yeah!

1734
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,620
James and the Giant fucking Drill.

1735
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,040
I should've saved that magic bean.

1736
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,980
Wait, there's a red suitcase over there!

1737
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,020
Yeah, I see it.

1738
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,120
Wait, are we supposed to keep going up again?

1739
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,200
Or is this...

1740
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,920
Red means good.

1741
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah, we're going up there.

1742
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,240
I love the last one.

1743
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,900
Wait, you missed that one for the round.

1744
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,340
I don't trust...

1745
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:17,680
Ouch!

1746
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,120
I didn't even do anything.

1747
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:19,760
I didn't even do anything.

1748
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,680
Uh-huh.

1749
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,280
Here I go.

1750
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,040
I can't eat it.

1751
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,480
Why not?

1752
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,440
I saw this suitcase.

1753
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:28,860
Yeah.

1754
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,360
What's in there?

1755
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,080
Min, I'm gonna feed you something and it's actually good for you.

1756
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,480
I promise.

1757
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,580
What is that?

1758
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,120
Come on, it's a yellow crispery.

1759
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,720
It's good for you.

1760
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:38,920
Anyway.

1761
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:39,940
Yummy!

1762
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,700
Is it...

1763
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,980
Supposed to be foggy?

1764
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:45,520
Or...

1765
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,440
Oh, not anymore.

1766
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:46,940
Just kidding.

1767
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:47,700
Um...

1768
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,320
I mean, the fog's gonna creep up pretty quick.

1769
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,780
I don't know where the fuck Doki went.

1770
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,760
We better just abandon her in my head.

1771
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:53,780
Doki!

1772
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,960
Oh, I see you!

1773
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,760
I see you!

1774
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,500
Abandoning her would have to be an active thing.

1775
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,060
If she wanders off, that's her fault.

1776
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,200
Oh my god!

1777
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,680
She's...

1778
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,660
She's all the way up there.

1779
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,300
Dang.

1780
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,040
Oh, there's some good apples over here.

1781
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,200
We don't wanna look into these apples.

1782
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,360
Are you sure they're good?

1783
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,100
Are you sure?

1784
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,380
Oh!

1785
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:10,800
Ah!

1786
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:12,440
Oh!

1787
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,040
Are you okay?

1788
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,560
I...

1789
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,160
I did...

1790
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,020
I did not realize that that's what that was.

1791
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:18,780
What is this?

1792
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,460
I don't know.

1793
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,920
I was wondering you couldn't eat it.

1794
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,040
And I just tried to drop it on the floor and it like...

1795
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,700
Got really big.

1796
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,060
Well, I just wasted that.

1797
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:27,980
Let's get up here.

1798
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,620
Cool.

1799
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,140
Let's go!

1800
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,600
Oh, it's a...

1801
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,500
It's a platform.

1802
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,360
I'm getting the apples.

1803
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,600
You have to get up here.

1804
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,180
I'm getting the apples.

1805
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,840
We're coming!

1806
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,840
Let's see, Minto!

1807
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,900
I'm coming!

1808
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,360
Oh, you got it.

1809
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:41,580
You got it.

1810
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:41,900
I got it.

1811
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,900
You just belly flopped your way up there?

1812
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,360
That was cool.

1813
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,920
Yeah, I'd do that.

1814
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,620
That's my technique.

1815
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,080
The signature...

1816
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,700
Minto...

1817
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,440
Belly flop.

1818
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,940
I have a cell phone that's apparently an extra platform.

1819
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,980
Like the magic bee.

1820
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,240
Bananas!

1821
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,420
Isn't anybody hungry?

1822
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,260
I don't...

1823
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,600
Uh...

1824
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,360
Only a little bit.

1825
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,180
Yeah, I'm only a little.

1826
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,660
Eat cheese.

1827
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,980
Can we touch the spikes or...

1828
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,260
I think I do.

1829
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,500
Oh, cool!

1830
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,100
No, you can't.

1831
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,920
There's...

1832
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,040
They are...

1833
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,660
Very poisonous.

1834
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,200
Did you test it with your face?

1835
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,220
Yeah, I did.

1836
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,520
Why are you always poison mint?

1837
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,060
Stop putting things in your mouth!

1838
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,980
Stop eating!

1839
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
I'm like a baby!

1840
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,200
My new son.

1841
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,480
I'm so helpful.

1842
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,600
Do you think these bananas are safe?

1843
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,920
Yeah, they're bananas.

1844
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,720
They have to be.

1845
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,540
Uh...

1846
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:33,660
Yeah.

1847
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,320
Oh...

1848
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,620
It's weird that there's no more monkeys on this island, but I think it's not because of the bananas.

1849
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:41,820
Oh...

1850
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,180
No...

1851
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,460
This one is actually safe.

1852
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,060
Here you go.

1853
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,860
It made me hungry.

1854
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,300
No, it didn't.

1855
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,160
Oh, I'm up here now.

1856
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,140
No, it didn't.

1857
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,440
It made me hungry for seconds.

1858
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:55,900
She's my head!

1859
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,740
She's my head!

1860
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,300
She's my head!

1861
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:05,660
I'm...

1862
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:10,100
I'm...

1863
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,340
Uh-oh!

1864
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,220
Oh!

1865
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:14,540
I'm okay!

1866
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,160
Oh!

1867
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,280
I'm okay!

1868
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,520
I'm okay!

1869
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,140
Oh, okay!

1870
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:19,940
No, you don't!

1871
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,980
Oh, lie to me!

1872
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,180
Don't lie to me!

1873
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,140
You can't believe it's gonna be poison either!

1874
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,380
You can't believe it's gonna be poison either!

1875
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:23,720
Scout members!

1876
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,340
Be careful!

1877
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,500
I don't know what you did stuff here.

1878
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,980
Watch out for the spikes!

1879
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,740
You'll get poison just like me!

1880
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,320
The rain makes it harder to climb.

1881
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,080
Um...

1882
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,800
Wait, really?

1883
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,500
No, it doesn't.

1884
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,220
We'll just have to...

1885
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,740
The Breath of the Wild is how it does.

1886
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,580
You can use my stamina.

1887
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,020
I wanna try a banana.

1888
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,980
Alright, fine.

1889
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,820
Climb in the rain.

1890
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,120
See what I care.

1891
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,780
Wow, I can't believe we came from all the way over there.

1892
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,000
I know, right?

1893
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,380
We did that.

1894
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,760
We've grown so much.

1895
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,240
We're climbing the scenic waterfall.

1896
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:55,840
I know!

1897
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,240
Oh my god, if only our Scoutmaster could see us now.

1898
00:54:59,400 --> 00:54:59,740
Yeah.

1899
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh, oh, thanks.

1900
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,200
We got you.

1901
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,700
Going up!

1902
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,760
I thought this game was supposed to be scary.

1903
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:11,940
You guys said.

1904
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,440
Guys, I'm getting poisoned.

1905
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,540
How am I...

1906
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,260
Thank you!

1907
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,060
You touched the poison ivy!

1908
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,900
Don't touch poison ivy, guys.

1909
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,100
Scouting 101, man.

1910
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,500
Rock rises.

1911
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,660
I thought scouting 101 was don't dropkick your teammates off the mountain.

1912
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,300
That's the only reason why I haven't done it.

1913
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,600
I think that's like personal respect.

1914
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,720
Which way should we go?

1915
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,300
Where did Doki go?

1916
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,720
Is there a pause there where Doki went?

1917
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,400
I guess.

1918
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,120
Let's have a look.

1919
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,020
Ooh!

1920
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,320
Beautiful!

1921
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,280
You just wanted to take me behind the romantic waterfall.

1922
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,600
With the delicious looking plants.

1923
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,840
I didn't want you to miss these beautiful views.

1924
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,540
Don't fall.

1925
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,040
We weren't.

1926
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,620
You want this banana?

1927
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,440
Oh!

1928
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:51,880
Oh!

1929
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,620
Thank you!

1930
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,860
Oh, I have a banana peel now.

1931
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,140
Wait.

1932
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:55,680
Can...

1933
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,860
Watch her slip on it.

1934
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,300
How do I drop it?

1935
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,080
Oh, here we go.

1936
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,980
Hey, take a step forward.

1937
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,820
Oh, shit.

1938
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,480
I got her side.

1939
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:05,800
Wow!

1940
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,660
I think we gotta maneuver our way through here.

1941
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,780
Uh... I don't know if you can, actually.

1942
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,480
Don't touch me!

1943
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,740
Stop!

1944
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,960
I'm feeling pressured!

1945
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:26,540
Stop!

1946
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,520
Stop touching me!

1947
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,720
Are you pointing again?

1948
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,140
No, no, I'm okay!

1949
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,860
Oh, wait!

1950
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,060
Yeah, that actually worked, but I fucked it up.

1951
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,120
And then I broke my leg again.

1952
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,760
Doki, go back the way you went.

1953
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,580
This way here.

1954
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,060
And then you can walk most of the way along here when it's not raining.

1955
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,500
Not in the rain.

1956
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,160
How do I take it?

1957
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,120
How do I take your apple?

1958
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,000
What?

1959
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,700
Take it?

1960
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Oh, and I can walk?

1961
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,680
What?

1962
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,300
Yeah, kind of shove yourself with the right side so you...

1963
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,100
Whoa, what's that?

1964
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can...

1965
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,580
I'm okay.

1966
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,160
Uh, I'm getting poisoned.

1967
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,400
You might have just set off a giant poison explosive cloud.

1968
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,000
Uh, I don't have...

1969
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,180
You're poisoned!

1970
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,280
There, I got you, I got you.

1971
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:21,780
I'm coming!

1972
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,250
Help me!

1973
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:26,430
Help me!

1974
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:30,510
Help me!

1975
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,190
Are you okay?

1976
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:33,730
Are you okay?

1977
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:34,870
I'm okay!

1978
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,970
I got you!

1979
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,530
This game has me hearing, like, actual screams of fear from you guys.

1980
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,790
I don't have meds.

1981
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,930
I don't have meds.

1982
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:51,930
Oh, I have this.

1983
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,370
I got you.

1984
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,870
I'm being healed right now.

1985
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,870
Wait for Doki, she needs it too.

1986
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,310
Oh.

1987
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,330
No, I don't think I will wait.

1988
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:01,430
Okay.

1989
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:02,690
Stop it!

1990
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,090
Let us go!

1991
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,570
I'm coming.

1992
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,350
Min, Min.

1993
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:10,830
Yeah?

1994
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:11,830
Don't climb it.

1995
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:12,910
Try not to climb it.

1996
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,650
What you want to do...

1997
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:15,770
No!

1998
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,210
No!

1999
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,550
No!

2000
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:20,510
No!

2001
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:28,010
Um, I was already climbing when you told me not to climb it, so...

2002
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,150
I don't really know what to tell you there.

2003
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:32,410
No!

2004
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:33,390
No!

2005
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:33,510
No!

2006
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:34,710
You can walk.

2007
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,430
Just push yourself into the corner.

2008
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,730
Walk along it.

2009
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:38,170
Okay.

2010
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,010
Okay!

2011
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,890
Tell the clouds to friggin' climb.

2012
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,170
Oh!

2013
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:44,390
Oh!

2014
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:45,770
Okay, I'm climbing now.

2015
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,350
Help me!

2016
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,310
I made it to a new location!

2017
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,250
Got you.

2018
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:50,950
Got you.

2019
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,690
Can you bring up the cherry lantern now?

2020
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,630
Holy shit.

2021
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,590
Oh, it's empty.

2022
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:56,510
Oh my god.

2023
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,390
Keep...

2024
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,330
You fucking did keep...

2025
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,610
No, I'm going to...

2026
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,170
No!

2027
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,450
You're not getting upset!

2028
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,910
Oh, now it's actually empty!

2029
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:10,950
It's actually empty!

2030
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,250
It's actually empty!

2031
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,270
Dookie's dog is like, Don't fight!

2032
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,230
Tell your dog to shut up!

2033
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:16,930
No!

2034
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:17,370
No!

2035
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:21,750
Help me!

2036
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:21,870
Help me!

2037
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,910
Your dog says no violence!

2038
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,790
He just wants to see us survive!

2039
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,270
I'm making an example out of you.

2040
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,870
He knows what I wanted to do.

2041
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,370
Run!

2042
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:46,670
Run!

2043
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,230
He wants food.

2044
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:50,530
He wants food.

2045
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,330
And I want food, too.

2046
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,730
Yeah, you have an apple in your backpack, okay?

2047
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:56,370
You can eat.

2048
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,690
That's not an apple.

2049
00:59:58,690 --> 00:59:59,430
Wait, don't touch that.

2050
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,330
This is...

2051
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,130
Yeah, don't touch that.

2052
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:02,850
Don't touch that.

2053
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:03,570
What is that?

2054
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,610
Maybe you should touch it and find out.

2055
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:07,270
Yeah, do.

2056
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:07,610
Go, go.

2057
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,870
I'll throw this, and it'll activate.

2058
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,490
Oh, fuck!

2059
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:13,550
Nice girl.

2060
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,070
Good job, nice girl.

2061
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:16,810
Don't worry.

2062
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,370
I'm dying like that.

2063
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,910
I don't think... I hope we didn't need that.

2064
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,070
I got a weak look out of them, too.

2065
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:27,810
I wanna go dig in this hole and find it.

2066
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,090
I'm sure he fell somewhere in this hole.

2067
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,530
It'll be fine.

2068
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:33,970
I'm pretty good.

2069
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:35,370
Ow.

2070
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,550
It was dead anyway.

2071
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,050
You can make that jump, but it's far.

2072
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,810
Oh, how'd you guys get over there?

2073
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,710
From where I'm standing or from there?

2074
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:45,850
From where you're standing, I think?

2075
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,090
I think that's what I did.

2076
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:47,750
I got you.

2077
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:49,870
Thank you.

2078
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:56,880
Holy shit!

2079
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,440
Did she just fall?

2080
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,320
She might have just fallen like a thousand feet.

2081
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,420
I don't think... I think she jumped kinda early.

2082
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,820
She jumped at all!

2083
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,760
She just walked off!

2084
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,340
Minutes, sprint before you jump.

2085
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,660
Oh, I made it!

2086
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,200
See?

2087
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,040
Nailed it.

2088
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,040
Nailed it.

2089
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
I'm a little worried.

2090
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,860
You made it!

2091
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:30,860
Totally fine.

2092
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:31,260
Yes!

2093
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,620
Do you think she's okay?

2094
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,080
Wait, does anybody still have the trumpet?

2095
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,040
No, she's not okay.

2096
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:36,740
She's like a sad dude.

2097
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:40,880
She's...

2098
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,990
The crime of what?

2099
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,590
You fucking up your jump?

2100
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:57,270
That's the sentence.

2101
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,870
I don't...

2102
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:59,770
I don't...

2103
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:00,430
I don't...

2104
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:00,990
I don't...

2105
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,190
I don't...

2106
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,150
I don't...

2107
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:07,850
I don't...

2108
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,550
I'm here to haunt you.

2109
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,530
I don't know if this is the better way to go, or if we could go that way.

2110
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,630
Both are viable.

2111
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,790
I trust you!

2112
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,590
Oh, don't do that.

2113
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,610
That's a terrible idea.

2114
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:25,610
Wait, how do we... Oh, it's a pre-haunt.

2115
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,050
It's a pre-haunt.

2116
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,890
Pre-haunt?

2117
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,290
You could ask Mint how to start hunting for you.

2118
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,090
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2119
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,910
Yeah, you have an expert right here.

2120
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,950
I can't tell if that's getting hit by the rain or not.

2121
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:38,270
It's not.

2122
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,070
Can you shut up, Doki?

2123
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,530
Your face is so ugly.

2124
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,790
Wait, this is so green, though.

2125
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:52,130
Mint could put her... Yeah, Mint could put her piton or something on it.

2126
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,330
I have a piton!

2127
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,130
I stole that from your bag, Doki!

2128
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,810
No, let me wait for the rain, and I'll see if I can do it.

2129
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,190
Hold on.

2130
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:00,170
I got lots of extra stamina, so...

2131
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,050
I stole it, and it actually worked.

2132
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,530
It worked out, because I have it.

2133
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,230
And I didn't die.

2134
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:05,830
You saved it.

2135
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:08,330
Oh, I see the top!

2136
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,370
There she goes.

2137
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,830
I see the top!

2138
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,390
You're, like, almost there.

2139
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,310
Oh, thank you!

2140
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:20,610
Oh, there's some... there's some things here.

2141
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,470
There's some bees!

2142
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,410
There's bees!

2143
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,610
Don't touch the bees!

2144
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,590
Touch the bees!

2145
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,470
Touch the bees!

2146
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,910
They're strange melons!

2147
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,270
Touch the bees!

2148
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,110
Stuffy, touch the bees!

2149
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:31,410
Eat that melon!

2150
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:31,410
Eat that!

2151
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,010
He wants to try the melon!

2152
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:33,350
I'll tie it!

2153
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:33,730
I'll take it!

2154
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:34,230
I'll take it!

2155
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:34,890
I'll take it!

2156
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,290
Here you go!

2157
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:36,150
Oh, oh, it's poisonous!

2158
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,950
Oh, that looks so poisonous, dude!

2159
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:39,530
Oh, no!

2160
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,890
It just looked like a cantaloupe!

2161
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,250
Big, the dodge!

2162
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:45,450
Sound good, the sound good, okay?

2163
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:45,950
Ooh!

2164
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,450
Rope cannon!

2165
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,070
And the water!

2166
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:51,910
Do you want any?

2167
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,010
No, I'm okay.

2168
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,170
Actually, that fed me, like, I'm so full.

2169
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,190
Just a little poison.

2170
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,270
That was actually the best thing I could have had.

2171
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:00,710
Yeah!

2172
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,390
Just a little.

2173
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,230
Just walk it up.

2174
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:03,910
Yeah, I am.

2175
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,690
The poison will eventually stop, you know?

2176
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,930
It's like when you eat pineapple and it makes your mouth a little spiky, but it's still worth it.

2177
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,690
I think that's called an allergy.

2178
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:14,730
No!

2179
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,370
It's eating you!

2180
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,130
No, pineapple's technically acidic for...

2181
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,250
Yeah, it's a eating meal.

2182
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,270
Yeah, it is.

2183
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:20,450
It is.

2184
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,810
It is.

2185
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,470
You're not supposed to eat pineapple.

2186
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:23,830
I'm coming!

2187
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:24,410
I'm coming!

2188
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,710
But, for some reason, people just like that.

2189
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,290
Little freaks they are.

2190
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:34,190
I'm actually, I think, allergic to kiwi, because when I eat kiwi, my mouth goes funny.

2191
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:35,910
That sounds fine.

2192
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,050
I don't think I have a spirit inside.

2193
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:41,810
I'm pretty sure, like, it's supposed to do that, right?

2194
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:42,990
Oh, is it?

2195
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,070
I don't think so.

2196
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:46,770
Uh, there's some more shrooms, but I don't know if those are safe.

2197
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:47,590
I think.

2198
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,390
Let me make sure.

2199
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:49,450
Oh my god.

2200
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,210
No, I don't trust your mushroom opinion.

2201
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,090
Eat two!

2202
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:52,730
Eat two!

2203
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:53,710
Eat two!

2204
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:53,930
Eat, eat it!

2205
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:55,530
Eat two to see if it...

2206
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:55,990
I did!

2207
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,550
I ate two!

2208
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,530
Did you just feed me one?

2209
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:57,910
Oh god.

2210
01:04:58,650 --> 01:04:59,190
Oh no.

2211
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,910
I'm doing good.

2212
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:01,830
I ate two and I'm fine.

2213
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,310
This one was good.

2214
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:03,850
I told you.

2215
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,090
The boogal or whatever.

2216
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:06,810
The boogal?

2217
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:07,410
You know this game was made in two weeks?

2218
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:07,450
The boogal?

2219
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,790
Was made in two weeks.

2220
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:09,370
That's crazy.

2221
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,570
This game was made in two weeks?

2222
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:13,290
Yeah, it was made in two weeks.

2223
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:14,230
It was supposed to be like a...

2224
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,650
I wonder if I can jump up there or if I should go over there.

2225
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:17,430
I don't know.

2226
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:18,650
I think we should have followed...

2227
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,410
I think we...

2228
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:21,950
Oh, I was gonna say I think we should follow Snuffy, but never mind.

2229
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,190
I think that one.

2230
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,710
I think that one.

2231
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:25,490
Oh shoot.

2232
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:26,590
Oh, I made it.

2233
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,310
Not when it's raining.

2234
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,710
I don't think you're gonna get that way.

2235
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:30,670
I don't think so.

2236
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:31,850
Oh, never mind.

2237
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:32,290
Wait.

2238
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,110
Wait.

2239
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,830
Wait.

2240
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,130
Oh, please.

2241
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:35,710
No!

2242
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:36,530
No!

2243
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,230
You good?

2244
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:42,130
You're okay.

2245
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:48,330
Um, there is something up top.

2246
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,750
I don't know if you can climb up there.

2247
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:52,770
How do you make it?

2248
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:54,710
Let me see.

2249
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:57,450
I made it.

2250
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,350
Yeah, I just have a little concussion.

2251
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,210
Don't worry about me.

2252
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,230
No, you definitely can't make it.

2253
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,130
You definitely can't make it.

2254
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:04,970
It's really, really far.

2255
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:05,310
Goodbye.

2256
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:07,330
Thank you.

2257
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,010
Oh my god.

2258
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:08,310
Okay.

2259
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:12,870
I don't like this game because I have to watch you guys fall to your death like a million times.

2260
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,190
What do we do?

2261
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,750
Alright, let me try this one then.

2262
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,130
Hold on.

2263
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:18,010
I think this is our best action.

2264
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:18,670
I think so too.

2265
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:18,790
Oh, wait.

2266
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:19,390
Oh.

2267
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,470
You have the rope.

2268
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,530
Yeah, you have the rope to.

2269
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,230
Where'd the rope go?

2270
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:24,570
Okay.

2271
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,870
Yeah, it's um...

2272
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:28,430
Oh, we didn't need...

2273
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:28,650
Okay.

2274
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:29,510
But it's there now.

2275
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,070
Hold on.

2276
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,010
Well...

2277
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:32,490
They need it.

2278
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:33,270
I need it.

2279
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:34,070
I need it.

2280
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:34,530
Maybe.

2281
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:35,070
Yeah, yeah.

2282
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,150
Wait, how do I reach that?

2283
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,490
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

2284
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:37,790
The babies need it.

2285
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:39,550
I put it down.

2286
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:40,390
It should be there now.

2287
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,490
I can't.

2288
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:41,750
I can't.

2289
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:42,750
Okay, okay.

2290
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,190
Oh no.

2291
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:45,330
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

2292
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:45,710
Line!

2293
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:46,970
Oh, grab the rope!

2294
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,670
Grab the rope!

2295
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,710
Grab the rope!

2296
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,990
Grab the rope!

2297
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,670
The babies fall.

2298
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:52,210
Can I get the rope?

2299
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:52,930
Okay, there you go.

2300
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:54,590
Shut up.

2301
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,430
Just because you fell and died, doesn't mean the rest of us have to.

2302
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,450
Someone did not catch me!

2303
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,010
They were like, you make it!

2304
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:02,270
And they didn't die!

2305
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,550
You didn't drown!

2306
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,170
You just walked off!

2307
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:05,710
They didn't, they didn't die!

2308
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,710
And I was lied to, I ran to everything.

2309
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,990
This ghost is noisy.

2310
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,010
How do we turn it off?

2311
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,970
How can, how could I fucking catch you if you plummet halfway through the chasm?

2312
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,050
I should have been caught!

2313
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,170
I don't know if we can get around here.

2314
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,350
This is, this is really sketch.

2315
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:21,410
Yeah, this looks bad.

2316
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:24,530
There's a ledge on the, uh, there is a ledge on the bar.

2317
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:24,790
Yeah, yeah.

2318
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:25,590
Oh, there it is.

2319
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:27,450
Yeah.

2320
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:28,330
See, look at that.

2321
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,930
I'm such a fucking helpful ghost.

2322
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,810
She's back seating us.

2323
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:32,310
Chat!

2324
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,390
Aw, yeah!

2325
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,290
Waiter!

2326
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:38,250
We found the crevice.

2327
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:38,950
Ooh, look!

2328
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:39,370
An opening!

2329
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,090
Cave diving!

2330
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:40,950
We're cave diving!

2331
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:43,030
Oh my god!

2332
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:43,690
This is it!

2333
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:45,210
This is the cave diving park!

2334
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,070
There's nowhere else.

2335
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:47,850
That looks really dangerous.

2336
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,750
Oh my god, the fog!

2337
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:49,470
The fog!

2338
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,010
Ah!

2339
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,490
What's bad about the fog?

2340
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,370
I don't know.

2341
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:54,430
I don't know.

2342
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:55,290
Oh.

2343
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:56,690
There's like, the left side.

2344
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,670
There's something on the left.

2345
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,450
Where?

2346
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,870
Maybe we can take this right behind her.

2347
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:01,170
No, no, no.

2348
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:01,590
Behind you, like.

2349
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,630
Behind you, there's...

2350
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,050
It's green.

2351
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:06,970
I don't know about that, Doki.

2352
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:09,110
No, the behind you, like, a cross.

2353
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:10,070
Yeah?

2354
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,350
Okay, yeah, but, but, like, I don't think we can get any further from there.

2355
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,310
This is like, closed.

2356
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:15,670
Oh, shit.

2357
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,250
Yeah.

2358
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:16,770
Yeah.

2359
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:17,690
Okay, hold on.

2360
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,310
Yeah, I think we found the edge of the map.

2361
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:22,330
We're too far over.

2362
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,810
Oh my god, the fog is so high.

2363
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:25,830
Yeah.

2364
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:26,910
So those are these, like, puppets?

2365
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,570
There's just nowhere to go.

2366
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:30,350
Yeah.

2367
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:34,570
I think we, we, we kind of listed too far to one side, I guess, maybe?

2368
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:35,150
I think so.

2369
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,030
Wait, look, there's a ledge on the top.

2370
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,610
If only you had another rope.

2371
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:40,490
If only.

2372
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:42,390
Oh.

2373
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,410
Oh man, my backpack had so many ropes.

2374
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,050
It didn't have any ropes.

2375
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:47,630
It didn't have any ropes.

2376
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:47,950
Stop lying.

2377
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:48,870
There's something in here.

2378
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:49,970
It had so many ropes.

2379
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:50,530
It had none.

2380
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,610
I looked in your backpack many times.

2381
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:54,190
No, no, no.

2382
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,830
I had at least one.

2383
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,930
I'm going to try it with a normal mental.

2384
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,790
Wait, men have, wait, no.

2385
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,590
Why not use the, the yellow thing?

2386
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,470
Can I use this?

2387
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,070
I got a pecan.

2388
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:07,770
I have a pecan.

2389
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,130
I have a pecan.

2390
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,290
No, I, no, the pecan.

2391
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:11,870
The pecan.

2392
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:11,990
The pecan.

2393
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,590
I just need to find the right place to do it though.

2394
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,970
Whatever that is.

2395
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,070
It's a wall.

2396
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,490
It, it, it goes in the wall and you hold it.

2397
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:22,210
It looks, it looks like it's like sheer though.

2398
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:23,210
Hmm.

2399
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:24,610
Oh god, the fog.

2400
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,090
The fog!

2401
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,150
I'm afraid of you.

2402
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:28,430
It's not.

2403
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,150
Maybe, just jump in the fog.

2404
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,610
You see?

2405
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,390
It's, it's where all your friends are.

2406
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,370
Oh wow, I see it.

2407
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,770
It really is kind of foggy.

2408
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,050
Yeah.

2409
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,310
Whoa, it's like getting all, whoa.

2410
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:39,710
Say hi.

2411
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:41,310
All your friends are over there.

2412
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,050
Come on, men, come on.

2413
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:43,150
Come on.

2414
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,210
The fog's over there too.

2415
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,550
Oh, oh.

2416
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,470
You're not gonna make it.

2417
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,010
I will.

2418
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:48,410
Grab.

2419
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:48,930
You're not gonna make it.

2420
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:49,510
So you're right.

2421
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,450
You're not gonna make it.

2422
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:51,810
Oh!

2423
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:52,550
Hello.

2424
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:54,030
Hello.

2425
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,550
I don't have enough stamina.

2426
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:58,270
You look great, men.

2427
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:03,430
I don't have enough stamina.

2428
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:04,850
Wait.

2429
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:07,010
Min, do you have your piton still?

2430
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:07,470
Yeah.

2431
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,190
You're, you can, here.

2432
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,270
Come on, grab this one.

2433
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,230
Like, come up here.

2434
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:16,430
And then put your piton whenever you can have enough stamina.

2435
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,910
No, no, no, no.

2436
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:20,610
You're gonna die.

2437
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,330
No, but, oh.

2438
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,030
You're gonna die.

2439
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,250
No, but,

2440
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:38,550
oh.

2441
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,890
You're gonna die without me.

2442
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,550
Wait, I keep grabbing, but it's not grabbing.

2443
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:47,070
Do the last poop before you go.

2444
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,570
Play your death play.

2445
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,270
Wait, I'm grabbing it?

2446
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,230
Oh, it didn't work.

2447
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:52,770
Okay.

2448
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,090
Goaloooop.

2449
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:18,250
Wait,

2450
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:23,950
did Stuffy die?

2451
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:24,630
He died.

2452
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,550
Oh, there I am.

2453
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,990
Goaloo, goaloo, goaloo, goaloo.

2454
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:39,710
I can't believe I slipped a bell on a banana.

2455
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,150
Goaloo, goaloo, goaloo, goaloo.

2456
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,160
Hold on, I'm gonna eat a little.

2457
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,020
I'm gonna drink some more tea.

2458
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,180
I'm coughing a lot today.

2459
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:57,660
I don't know why.

2460
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,310
Okay.

2461
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,290
Eat a ghost.

2462
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:10,530
I give up!

2463
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,550
I don't think Mint knows that she...

2464
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,030
Oh, there you are.

2465
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:14,550
There she is.

2466
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:15,690
Oh, you were saying...

2467
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,190
You were using your sunglasses, too.

2468
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,090
How do I...

2469
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,030
Why are you so cute in your little Mint phantom-y form?

2470
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:21,730
Why?

2471
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,090
How do you move around?

2472
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,250
How do you move around?

2473
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,310
Oh, you scroll wheel.

2474
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:27,810
It's just that.

2475
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:28,990
Oh...

2476
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:29,210
Okay.

2477
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:30,750
Oh...

2478
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:30,970
Oh...

2479
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,290
I'm so close to you.

2480
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:33,150
Hey!

2481
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:34,870
Hi, lady.

2482
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:35,870
Oh, god.

2483
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:36,730
That's not distracting.

2484
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:37,510
Listen to me.

2485
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:41,370
We are the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future.

2486
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,450
Wait, you're so close.

2487
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,970
You're so close.

2488
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:44,890
Right?

2489
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:47,430
Maybe?

2490
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,190
Sniffer.

2491
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:48,710
I don't know.

2492
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,750
You're on a ledge, and it's more open now.

2493
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,250
How do I smell?

2494
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,530
I'm bad.

2495
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,210
You've been on this island for days.

2496
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,390
You do?

2497
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,830
Yeah, it's at the very top.

2498
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:58,710
Oh, my god.

2499
01:12:59,310 --> 01:12:59,510
No.

2500
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:02,250
Okay, you look up.

2501
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:04,150
I am looking up.

2502
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,770
There's like a luggage on those vines.

2503
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:07,430
That's evil.

2504
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,990
I am not touching that shit.

2505
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:09,530
Suffer.

2506
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:12,550
The luggage is so evil.

2507
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:13,670
Why did it do that?

2508
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,010
Oh, my gosh.

2509
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:18,310
You have such good health and everything, Lima.

2510
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,570
That's why she's a tour guide.

2511
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:22,890
Wait, why do I have a grungle?

2512
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:23,210
Oh, no.

2513
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:23,730
That's you.

2514
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:25,650
Grungle?

2515
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:28,030
It's a grungle.

2516
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,650
It's that little bird plushie.

2517
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:30,990
Yeah, it's the...

2518
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:31,870
His name is Bing Bong.

2519
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:32,550
Bing Bong.

2520
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,070
You have a grungle.

2521
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:36,450
Where did you get grungle from?

2522
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:39,750
Yeah, where did you get grungle from it?

2523
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:40,690
I don't...

2524
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:41,790
I don't know.

2525
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,710
The hottest new thing, the grungles.

2526
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:48,910
Wait, I'm gonna move myself so chat can see too.

2527
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,410
My favorite character, Mr. Grungle.

2528
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,710
Oh, whoops, that's the game.

2529
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,350
Is there a better path to take here?

2530
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:56,890
Am I fucking stuck?

2531
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:57,710
Um...

2532
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,670
Maybe to the left?

2533
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,390
Yeah.

2534
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:03,230
To the left.

2535
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,410
I don't think I can make that.

2536
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:04,850
Hold on.

2537
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,370
Oh, I don't think...

2538
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,030
I don't know.

2539
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:07,610
There we go.

2540
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,270
The left side seems nice, though.

2541
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,750
He's a lot nicer.

2542
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,090
I noticed there's a lot less poison up here.

2543
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:17,730
That's nice.

2544
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:18,950
I'm just having trouble like...

2545
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:19,670
Ugh.

2546
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,210
I think you gotta go right, man.

2547
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:25,010
I don't know.

2548
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,390
Or unless you can walk up left side.

2549
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,390
Like, it's like...

2550
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,490
Just grab a sports drink and then YOLO.

2551
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:33,810
Yeah, yeah.

2552
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,290
That drink has sports drink.

2553
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:39,410
Yeah.

2554
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:40,410
And then...

2555
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:40,530
Okay.

2556
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,410
You picked the scarier part.

2557
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:42,950
Nice.

2558
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:43,450
Nice.

2559
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,470
She's gaming.

2560
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:45,490
Oh, I see it!

2561
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:46,510
There it is!

2562
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:47,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2563
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,410
She's doing it!

2564
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,730
M-O-G!

2565
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:50,990
Yeah!

2566
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,270
Yeah!

2567
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,840
We did it!

2568
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,220
Oh, she's eating now.

2569
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,780
A little bit eating.

2570
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:11,440
Not too bad.

2571
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,300
Not we.

2572
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,160
She did it.

2573
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:14,900
We did it!

2574
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,600
We did like 90% of it, right?

2575
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:18,300
Yeah!

2576
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,200
Yeah!

2577
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:19,960
What's up?

2578
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:20,300
Yay!

2579
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,560
I'm gonna go eat.

2580
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,880
I'm yum yum time.

2581
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,220
Wait, what's the darkness mean in my little meter?

2582
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,120
I think that's like when you revive.

2583
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,860
Where's the luggage that you're supposed to...

2584
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:32,740
The...

2585
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:33,900
Look, there's one up here.

2586
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:34,980
What?

2587
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,980
I don't think it's supposed to...

2588
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:37,120
Where?

2589
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,240
Is it supposed to spawn there?

2590
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,060
What?

2591
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:39,700
Can you even get...

2592
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,540
You can't climb these kinds of shoes, can you?

2593
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:41,780
Wait, what is that foot?

2594
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,040
Yeah, what is that?

2595
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,420
What?

2596
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,320
Okay.

2597
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,060
Randomly generated two of salt, I suppose.

2598
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,220
I'm cooking my mushroom.

2599
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,100
Not mushroom.

2600
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:51,580
Marshmallow.

2601
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,080
Did I just...

2602
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,720
Did I just not get a mushroom?

2603
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,940
Or a marshmallow?

2604
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:55,940
I guess so.

2605
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,360
Get someone out with two marshmallows?

2606
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,180
We all keep...

2607
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,120
I took only one.

2608
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,540
I took one.

2609
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:01,940
Wait, there's a...

2610
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,840
I can cook it again?

2611
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:04,260
Jokey.

2612
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,000
Well done, marshmallow.

2613
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,880
Did you just feed this to me?

2614
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:09,960
Oh!

2615
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,960
Why are you dying?

2616
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,900
I was resurrected to live a life of nothing but suffering.

2617
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,560
Wait, come here!

2618
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:16,280
Come here!

2619
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,500
I'll give you my marshmallow!

2620
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,000
No, the yellow ones are good.

2621
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:19,300
No!

2622
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:19,900
The yellow ones are good.

2623
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,160
The yellow ones are good.

2624
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:21,680
Are you sure?

2625
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,100
Oh, wait, no.

2626
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,080
She fed me a green one.

2627
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,100
Wait, it is your marshmallow!

2628
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:25,860
Okay!

2629
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,760
Okay, I'm gonna eat mine then.

2630
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:29,840
Oh, wow!

2631
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:30,720
Fed me it.

2632
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,920
That's nice of you mid, though.

2633
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:32,680
Double cook it.

2634
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,400
Fed me entirely.

2635
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,860
I gave her my marshmallow.

2636
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,280
I'm such a good person.

2637
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:37,900
Shut up!

2638
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:38,460
Uh-huh.

2639
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,260
Oh, my God!

2640
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:42,040
Whoa, that looks intense!

2641
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:42,940
I think the fish is on my soul now.

2642
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,060
I think the fish is on my soul now.

2643
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:44,620
I think the fish is on my soul now.

2644
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,800
How did we go?

2645
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,600
Oh, hi!

2646
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,240
Is there a fairy in here, too?

2647
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,100
Yeah, I don't know how long we're gonna make it, you guys.

2648
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,140
Just us.

2649
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,440
Oh, no.

2650
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:57,200
Oh, no.

2651
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,440
No, we thought we had a good time.

2652
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:58,600
No, we thought we had a good time.

2653
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,840
Isn't that so, like, F-bounded?

2654
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,190
Man, man!

2655
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:11,570
You think we're supposed to use, like, one of those, like, ropes and, like, shoot that...

2656
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:12,090
Yeah, I feel that.

2657
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,250
Yeah, I feel like this is where we should have kept all our materials.

2658
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,550
The last part is kind of, like, good for that.

2659
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:19,970
Yeah.

2660
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:21,670
Wow, we're doing so good.

2661
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:21,690
It's fine.

2662
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:22,450
We don't need it.

2663
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:26,250
This is where Mount Everest mod would have came in handy.

2664
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,570
Well, just promo.

2665
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:28,430
Don't worry about it.

2666
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:29,790
All the skeletons.

2667
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,270
All the skellies.

2668
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:33,910
Yeah, all the skellies scattered around.

2669
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,490
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

2670
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:39,150
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow!

2671
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,710
Get into shelter when that happens.

2672
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,530
Whoa.

2673
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,130
I'm so cool.

2674
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,230
It made me hungry.

2675
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:46,890
Oh, my God.

2676
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:49,510
It's, like, on the edge of the biome.

2677
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:50,430
I'm so cool.

2678
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,330
Scout master, we got one.

2679
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,370
This way is fine.

2680
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:55,090
This way is fine.

2681
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,790
Go, go, go, go.

2682
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,130
Okay.

2683
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:58,290
Let's just huddle together a little bit.

2684
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:59,450
Come, come, come.

2685
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:00,290
I'm coming.

2686
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:00,670
I'm here.

2687
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:02,930
I'm feel sort of right now.

2688
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,230
I'm here.

2689
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:06,990
I'm here.

2690
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:07,910
I'm here.

2691
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2692
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:15,730
It's always good in this biome that we'll have to stay near objects where we can hide behind to protect ourselves from freezing winds.

2693
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:16,730
Freezing winds.

2694
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,070
That's why.

2695
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:19,770
He told me.

2696
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,130
I caught you.

2697
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,410
This way.

2698
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,150
Bit chilly, innit?

2699
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:26,690
Yes.

2700
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,830
Innit?

2701
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:28,510
Maybe.

2702
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:31,130
Wait, there's pretty flowers here.

2703
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:31,850
Can you pick these?

2704
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:32,330
Ah!

2705
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,010
Oh!

2706
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,260
What are those?

2707
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,160
I don't think those are flowers, are they?

2708
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,160
I-I can't touch them, but they look pretty.

2709
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,260
Oh, wow.

2710
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,620
In this unforsaken cruel world, there is some beauty.

2711
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,020
You guys look so cute huddling behind a tree over here!

2712
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,420
Little babies over there, couldn't stand a little breeze.

2713
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,080
A little breeze?

2714
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,120
You guys never experience a little springtime breeze?

2715
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,440
I should just start running.

2716
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,520
Okay, what's in our treasure chest?

2717
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,780
Wait, it's orange.

2718
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:16,940
It's special.

2719
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,000
Oh, it's a special rescue.

2720
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,380
Special?

2721
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:19,900
Oh!

2722
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,320
Oh!

2723
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,600
I've been a good boy!

2724
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,100
No, you ha- Oh my god!

2725
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,780
Wait, that actually suits you?

2726
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,160
Hold on.

2727
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,600
You're filled with nothing but joy and whimsy.

2728
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,400
Wait, that actually suits you.

2729
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,040
The body should have been a good boy.

2730
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,960
But your face is so mean-looking.

2731
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,080
You're so- You need a good job at the dentist, so you get the lollipop.

2732
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,080
Now, it's my lollipop!

2733
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,440
You need one of the little spitter hats!

2734
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,540
I can't have just a little tongue taste?

2735
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:50,840
Goodness.

2736
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:56,660
Oh wait, just a little- Just a little- Oh really?

2737
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,200
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

2738
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,300
Oh wow, yeah.

2739
01:19:59,300 --> 01:19:59,800
Yeah.

2740
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:00,580
That's a lot.

2741
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,920
Oh oh, the blizzard!

2742
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,140
Don't worry.

2743
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,220
Oh, here comes the blizzard!

2744
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,160
Can I see my lollipop?

2745
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,800
You wanna see it?

2746
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,620
I'll let you- Yeah, that's huge.

2747
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:11,880
It's like bigger than your head.

2748
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,060
Can I lick you, just a little bit?

2749
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,080
Nope.

2750
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,820
Ten dollars.

2751
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,300
Ten dollars?!

2752
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,780
Ten Supas!

2753
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:19,380
Ten Supas!

2754
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,240
Ten Supas!

2755
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,100
To me, or...?

2756
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:22,980
To me.

2757
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,380
Now it's twenty Supas.

2758
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,760
Gosh, inflation is hurting us all.

2759
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,220
Oh wait.

2760
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,600
What's in- What was in there?

2761
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,580
Um, a heating pack and an energy drink.

2762
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:41,160
Whoa.

2763
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,060
Those are good.

2764
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:42,840
Oh, there's an apple!

2765
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,680
We should get that apple for like- There's a couple apples, yeah.

2766
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:47,800
Yeah, yeah.

2767
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:48,880
They're good.

2768
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:49,600
They're winter berries.

2769
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,500
There's a few down up here as well.

2770
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:52,580
Oh, okay, I will go.

2771
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,200
Okay, I will go.

2772
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,200
Oh, there's a tree up there too.

2773
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:54,880
Yeah.

2774
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah.

2775
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,240
Yeah, cause we can only fit like- A limited amount anyway.

2776
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,280
Is there aren't ones okay?

2777
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,300
I'll test it!

2778
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,660
I'll taste test it.

2779
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:03,840
Okay.

2780
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,760
Look at you grabbing that.

2781
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,200
Oh, they're real good.

2782
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,820
Grab a bunch and put them in my pack.

2783
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,400
I have a pack too.

2784
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:14,280
Is there any more?

2785
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:14,920
Put them in your pack.

2786
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,760
How do you put things in your pack?

2787
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:21,920
Uh, take your pack off, put it on the floor, and then like hold E and put it into one of the slots.

2788
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,400
Oh.

2789
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,220
It's really fiddly, so be careful on a mountain, cause you can actually throw your backpack off the thing.

2790
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:27,740
Okay.

2791
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:29,880
Wait, then you hold your- I got some oranges.

2792
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,260
Wait, what?

2793
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:32,860
I don't understand, but I believe you.

2794
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,140
I got one orange.

2795
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:35,180
Uh oh.

2796
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:36,780
Uh oh.

2797
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,400
Uh oh.

2798
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,700
I don't think this is enough.

2799
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:39,900
Uh oh.

2800
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,420
You guys okay?

2801
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:41,940
Uh.

2802
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,680
I'm okay, I'm okay right here.

2803
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,860
Yeah, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

2804
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,170
Okay, hold on.

2805
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,150
I'm eating.

2806
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:49,810
Okay.

2807
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:50,690
Wait, actually, yeah.

2808
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:53,950
No, actually you drop in, I'll put it- Oh, I was just saying, I could put it- There you go.

2809
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,010
How do you put it in?

2810
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:00,030
You, uh, you get your item out, and then you put it in.

2811
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:00,910
Oh!

2812
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:01,910
Oh!

2813
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:02,470
Oh wait.

2814
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:03,130
Oh!

2815
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:04,430
Oh, I got it!

2816
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:04,710
Okay.

2817
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:05,530
Look at that!

2818
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:08,290
Now we have two oranges.

2819
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:09,450
What's happening to it?

2820
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,110
Are you good?

2821
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:12,950
Nice.

2822
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:13,310
Hello!

2823
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:15,430
Hello!

2824
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,590
Okay.

2825
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:23,280
What do your eyes see- Oh, nice!

2826
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,660
I found the musical sting!

2827
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,580
Someone just left the heat pack on the door.

2828
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,380
The musicals?

2829
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,680
That was me, I ran out of room.

2830
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:30,840
Whoa.

2831
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:31,380
Oh.

2832
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,960
I have, I have- I have room.

2833
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,340
It's beautiful.

2834
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:35,360
Okay.

2835
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,040
Oh my god, it's so beautiful!

2836
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,340
It's beaut- Ah!

2837
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,220
Oh my god, it's not beautiful.

2838
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,540
It's not beautiful.

2839
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,080
It's not beautiful anymore.

2840
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,120
Oh my god, it's not beautiful.

2841
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,860
Run to the rock!

2842
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,300
It's right here!

2843
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,260
It's right here!

2844
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:49,700
It's right here!

2845
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,860
It's right here!

2846
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,040
Hmm.

2847
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,300
Yeah, we lost our bugle.

2848
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,020
Sad, sad.

2849
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,100
We're safe?

2850
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,200
I'm okay!

2851
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:04,800
Oh.

2852
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:10,010
Take my hand!

2853
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:13,010
Thank you!

2854
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,830
Wow, she actually did it.

2855
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,070
Teamwork!

2856
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,130
Team player!

2857
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:22,550
There's a hot spring on this map?

2858
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:24,030
Somewhere!

2859
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:25,750
Oh!

2860
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:27,050
Thank you!

2861
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:28,410
Lava!

2862
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:29,750
Dangerous!

2863
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:32,230
Lava!

2864
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,870
Oh, it looks...

2865
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,590
It looks...

2866
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,550
I don't know how to describe it.

2867
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:37,110
Like a...

2868
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,010
Like a big ol' worm.

2869
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:42,330
I feel like that stumpy little walk suit, Stokia, she walks off like, Guys, the floor is lava!

2870
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,090
And her dude's like...

2871
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,790
Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.

2872
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:47,550
Which way we going?

2873
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,590
I'll follow you, Limel.

2874
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:50,290
Uh...

2875
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:50,850
This way.

2876
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:52,710
I don't like jumping over the lava unless I have to.

2877
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:54,610
The fog rises.

2878
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:56,470
Oh, this way?

2879
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,370
Uh...

2880
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,330
I think I'm...

2881
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:01,750
Oh, gosh.

2882
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:02,630
I don't think I'm okay.

2883
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:03,190
Oh, god.

2884
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:04,610
No, I'm...

2885
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:05,330
Oh, I'm not okay.

2886
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:05,790
What?

2887
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,050
I'm right next to the lava!

2888
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:07,410
If you can get here...

2889
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:07,770
Mint, mint, mint.

2890
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,750
If you can get here...

2891
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:10,370
Yeah, over here.

2892
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:10,990
Over here to me.

2893
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,030
It's safe.

2894
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:12,350
Okay.

2895
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:13,130
Thanks.

2896
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,190
Huddle together for warmth.

2897
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,430
Yeah.

2898
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:15,330
Snuggle in here a little bit.

2899
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,850
Yeah, there we go, there we go.

2900
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:17,570
Oh.

2901
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:19,990
Hi, Dougie.

2902
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:20,910
Hi.

2903
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,290
Come huddle.

2904
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:23,490
Hi.

2905
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,930
I don't know where Snuffy is.

2906
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:26,690
Snuffy!

2907
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:28,450
Well, she's clearly not dead.

2908
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,050
I can hear her.

2909
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:30,370
Yeah.

2910
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:31,890
We hear you!

2911
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:35,210
Marco!

2912
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:36,890
Uh-oh.

2913
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:37,410
Wait.

2914
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:38,830
I made it.

2915
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:40,890
Marco!

2916
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:43,850
Oh, is that a mushroom?

2917
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:44,990
Or another shell fungus.

2918
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:45,350
Yeah, no.

2919
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:45,790
It's a...

2920
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,930
A shell fungus so you can make it to...

2921
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:48,430
Oh!

2922
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2923
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,850
Put it in your little backpack.

2924
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:51,470
Okay.

2925
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:52,530
Oh.

2926
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:53,710
Wait, where do we...

2927
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:54,290
Wait, Lamo!

2928
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:55,430
Yeah?

2929
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:56,630
Where do we go?

2930
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,370
Oh, there she is.

2931
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,230
Lamo, we're lost!

2932
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:00,710
We're lost!

2933
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,930
I think maybe this way.

2934
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:03,990
I hate this map.

2935
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:05,810
I changed my mind.

2936
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:06,570
This map sucks too.

2937
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:07,690
Yeah, no.

2938
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:09,190
I heard this map was the hardest part.

2939
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,150
I thought I was like, what?

2940
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:15,130
Surely the next one will be really easy.

2941
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:16,710
Yeah, sure.

2942
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:17,910
I actually like the next one.

2943
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:18,650
The next one's good.

2944
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:19,250
I like it.

2945
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,390
Wait, have you ever beaten it?

2946
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:21,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2947
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,870
Wait, you have?

2948
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:23,870
Uh-huh.

2949
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,430
How many tries to take you?

2950
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:31,410
Uh, a few, because a couple of times I played and people were like PvP-ing.

2951
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:34,890
We're not like us, because we clearly are working together.

2952
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,190
Yeah, no.

2953
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,430
We're working together real good.

2954
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:38,370
Yeah, together.

2955
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:41,450
Yeah.

2956
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,790
We're good teammates.

2957
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,370
Wait, what's happening?

2958
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:47,790
Yay!

2959
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,250
What's happening?

2960
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,350
It's kinda weird, that spot there.

2961
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:55,350
Uh-oh.

2962
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,110
I don't know about this section.

2963
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,070
It feels kinda sheer.

2964
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,710
Oh.

2965
01:25:58,830 --> 01:25:59,350
Hi, Snuffy!

2966
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:03,250
Is Mint okay?

2967
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:04,370
Wait, where's Mint?

2968
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:04,770
What is Mint?

2969
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:06,910
Um, I fell a great deal.

2970
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,790
Oh, God.

2971
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:13,090
I just came from down there.

2972
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:13,690
Finally.

2973
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,070
Wait a minute.

2974
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,610
Did we have three when we started?

2975
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,810
Um, hmm.

2976
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:22,230
Hmm.

2977
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,670
Wait, Mint had the backpack fill with oranges, so we can't let her die.

2978
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:29,010
We also can't let her die, because she's our friend!

2979
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:29,470
Because there's capybara.

2980
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:32,530
Yeah, she nearly has all our- all our materials.

2981
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,590
Save, in-game!

2982
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:38,190
Okay.

2983
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:46,590
Wait, what?

2984
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:48,970
I see the hot springs!

2985
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,450
With the capybara!

2986
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:51,970
Wait, you did?

2987
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:52,510
Oh, yeah!

2988
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,870
Yeah, I see them!

2989
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:55,670
Oh, yeah!

2990
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,890
We can't go there.

2991
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,510
We'll get fogged, I think.

2992
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:02,740
Yeah.

2993
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,380
Yeah, it's sad.

2994
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:04,560
Oh, my God.

2995
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,680
No, they're kinda way out.

2996
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,300
Goodbye, everybody.

2997
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,080
Is it- there only one spot- oh!

2998
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,020
Sophie is there.

2999
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:12,800
I don't care.

3000
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,740
I want her to.

3001
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,080
Wait, where are you guys going?

3002
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:16,780
Where do we go?

3003
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,940
I'm watching Snuffy.

3004
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,920
Oh, there's a spot over to the right that might work.

3005
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:20,880
Okay.

3006
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:23,100
Do me know then.

3007
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,480
They just got caught by the- and the- The internals okay, but you have to go over freezing rocks, which kinda sucks.

3008
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,620
No, she won't.

3009
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,600
I believe, I believe.

3010
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:50,520
I see her.

3011
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:53,920
There she is!

3012
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:54,700
She made it!

3013
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,140
This place might be no good.

3014
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,820
No, this place sucks.

3015
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:04,620
I think we should go reconvene at the capybara and decide a different route.

3016
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,160
Oh, yeah.

3017
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:07,880
Oh, shoot.

3018
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,360
Wait, I'm- I'm trying not to climb.

3019
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,520
How do I- oh, here we go.

3020
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,000
I'm leaving my backpack for you guys, okay?

3021
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:33,510
Okay.

3022
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:35,330
Whoa!

3023
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:36,750
Be careful!

3024
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:39,630
How'd you- how'd you- There's a big- No!

3025
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:40,950
I'm okay!

3026
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:41,530
Are you okay?

3027
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:42,050
Yeah.

3028
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:43,730
There's a big what?

3029
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:46,190
Nothing!

3030
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:46,770
I'm doing it!

3031
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,060
Capybara!

3032
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,080
Capybara!

3033
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:53,740
It was worth it.

3034
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,060
It was so worth it.

3035
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:55,800
Capybara!

3036
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,360
Will they heal my injuries, or?

3037
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,760
I think so.

3038
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,220
Uh-oh.

3039
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,220
Quickly!

3040
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,200
Oh, shoot.

3041
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,140
Ouch.

3042
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,020
Ouch.

3043
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:04,860
Ouch.

3044
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:06,920
It is?

3045
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,220
Yeah.

3046
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,300
Wait, I can't get up?

3047
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:15,200
I actually- I don't think I can get up at all.

3048
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,060
I have no energy.

3049
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,890
Wait, I'm right here!

3050
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,790
I'm so close to the capybara!

3051
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:24,170
Please!

3052
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,130
Please!

3053
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,110
I'm on the side!

3054
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,050
Wait, I can't- I can't do stuffy!

3055
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:32,110
I can't- wait!

3056
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,590
Oh, I'm here!

3057
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:36,330
Okay, I made- I walked up.

3058
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:37,250
I walked up.

3059
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:43,610
I was- I was just going around in circles, being like, I don't see you on the ledge anywhere, right?

3060
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:44,970
Oh.

3061
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:49,070
Yes, uh, give him a good pet, too.

3062
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,450
No, no, no.

3063
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,910
I took all their oranges and fed them to you, but they do have wound use.

3064
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:56,450
Watch this.

3065
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,790
Wait, you look chill as hell.

3066
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:00,770
Wait, me too.

3067
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:01,270
Okay.

3068
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,090
Yeah.

3069
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:03,250
Oh, yeah.

3070
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:04,410
Why?

3071
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:04,910
Wait.

3072
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:08,010
Why am I- Oh, I'm- Oh, no, it's okay.

3073
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,170
Just stay in the water, because it combats it.

3074
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:11,010
Okay, nice.

3075
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:11,850
It's chill.

3076
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:12,610
It's chill.

3077
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:13,130
It's chill.

3078
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:13,610
It's chill.

3079
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:14,170
We're chill.

3080
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:15,610
We're chill.

3081
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,070
We're chill.

3082
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:17,530
We're chill.

3083
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:21,810
Take my hand, Capybara.

3084
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:23,590
Take my hand.

3085
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,070
I'm still really injured.

3086
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:32,490
Well, it wasn't a healing spring.

3087
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:35,890
But maybe we can find something on the way up.

3088
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,590
Surely we'll make it- They're only up there.

3089
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:38,530
Yeah, they-

3090
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:44,930
I wonder if I'm distracting her.

3091
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,350
Honestly, Snuffy, I don't think I can make it.

3092
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,510
That's not true.

3093
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,150
Okay, okay.

3094
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,870
I have- I got nothing.

3095
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,970
No, no, no, don't waste it on me!

3096
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:09,770
No, why would you do that?

3097
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,970
It's never a waste if it helps you.

3098
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:12,970
It is a waste.

3099
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:13,710
That's a useful item.

3100
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,770
No, you're just a- You're a fellow scout.

3101
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:20,750
I wouldn't have a troop if it wasn't for my fellow scout.

3102
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:21,610
Oh, thanks.

3103
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,390
Thanks, fellow scout.

3104
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,650
No problem.

3105
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:29,550
Thankfully, this is a pretty easy- Maybe the Capybara's were the right choice.

3106
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:31,670
Yeah, the Capybara's were the right choice!

3107
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:33,730
Oh, hey, kids!

3108
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:34,290
Hi!

3109
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:36,590
Hello, parents?

3110
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,290
Oh, you guys left my backpack!

3111
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:39,490
I don't think we do.

3112
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:41,150
They didn't even take it.

3113
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:41,970
They didn't even take it.

3114
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:42,630
I'll put it on.

3115
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,510
Wait, I kind of need an apple from there.

3116
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:45,910
Yeah, yeah, here.

3117
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:49,850
Wait, how do I grab it?

3118
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:51,450
I'll wear it since it makes you heavy.

3119
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:52,570
Oh, I grabbed it?

3120
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:52,730
Okay.

3121
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:56,670
Yummy!

3122
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:57,990
Okay, I feel better.

3123
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,250
A little bit?

3124
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:01,610
A lot of bit.

3125
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:03,630
We need to find, like, first aid for you.

3126
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:05,630
We're right- we're together, so I feel better.

3127
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:06,570
I feel so bad.

3128
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:08,410
Yeah, I won't leave you behind!

3129
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:10,110
I've got a pusher.

3130
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:11,490
Oh!

3131
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:13,850
Oh!

3132
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:15,530
Oh, we- Okay.

3133
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:16,190
We're back here!

3134
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,190
I remember this vibe.

3135
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:18,210
Don't-don't-don't fall into that hole!

3136
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,950
Yeah, I've fallen in there before.

3137
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,990
Wait up here, up here!

3138
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,650
There's, like, multiple pathways you can take, and I think we could have ended up on one.

3139
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:26,150
That's not great.

3140
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:29,010
Okay, I think...

3141
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:30,590
Yeah, yeah, okay.

3142
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:31,330
Oh!

3143
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:32,110
Can you try here?

3144
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,070
Oh no, I fell!

3145
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:33,470
Oh no!

3146
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:35,010
Oh!

3147
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:36,410
Oh!

3148
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:37,710
Um...

3149
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:38,130
Ow!

3150
01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:39,330
Are you good?

3151
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:39,950
Where are you?

3152
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:40,790
Where'd you go?

3153
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:41,930
I don't know, I'm stuck!

3154
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:42,410
Oh no!

3155
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:43,650
Oh, this is...

3156
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:46,530
I kept doing this before too, where I kept going in a little loop.

3157
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,310
Why do I do that to myself?

3158
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:51,210
Oh!

3159
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:52,150
No!

3160
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:53,970
No, no, no, no!

3161
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:54,750
No, no, no, no, no!

3162
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:55,190
No!

3163
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:55,930
I'm fine!

3164
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:57,610
Oh, okay.

3165
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:03,870
What a beautiful night.

3166
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:07,150
The moon is nice and crescent.

3167
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:11,110
And the lava is flowing and keeping me warm.

3168
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,330
Oh, ouch.

3169
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:12,810
Never mind.

3170
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:13,970
I'm not warm at all.

3171
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:15,010
I'm not warm at all.

3172
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,770
Mine died?

3173
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:16,290
What?

3174
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:17,190
Mine died!

3175
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:19,490
Oh no, no, no.

3176
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,270
Uh-oh.

3177
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:20,610
Oh no!

3178
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,090
Okay, Scoutmaster down!

3179
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:24,330
Scoutmaster down!

3180
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:25,590
We'll never make it.

3181
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:28,310
Doki, how did you kill Lime?

3182
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:28,830
We'll be honest.

3183
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:29,490
How did you do it?

3184
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:30,190
What was the weapon?

3185
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:33,610
Her own face.

3186
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:35,230
I ate my lollipop before I died.

3187
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:37,310
You think you're Lollipop?

3188
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:37,670
Ouch!

3189
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:38,890
Ouch!

3190
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,970
Uh, Snuffy?

3191
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:42,070
I think this is the end of the road for me.

3192
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:43,650
Oh no!

3193
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:44,230
Don't quit!

3194
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:44,910
Don't you leave!

3195
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:49,230
I think I'm gonna go back to them Capybara and I'm just gonna resign to my thing.

3196
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:52,230
I swear to fuck you, go back to those goddamn Capybaras.

3197
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:59,370
I slipped on a- on a weird jump and I'm dead.

3198
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,970
And Doki died like right next to me.

3199
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:02,010
Oh, she's dead too!

3200
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:02,530
Doki died?

3201
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,950
Yeah, we're both dead.

3202
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:07,170
I guess you guys should've gone to the Capybara.

3203
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:10,270
Yeah, everybody who went to the Capybara are alive.

3204
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:17,370
I mean, if you go- if you go like around where Snuffy's going, you'll find our bodies and all our stuff so you can get some stuff.

3205
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:18,830
Yay, stuff!

3206
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:23,730
No, I'm not giving you that satisfaction.

3207
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:26,150
Oh, that's fucked up.

3208
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:28,250
That one's fucked up.

3209
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:29,230
That one is me.

3210
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:29,570
That one is me.

3211
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:31,230
I guess my back- Oh my god!

3212
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:32,690
Unless it fell off my body.

3213
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:32,950
Unless it fell off my body.

3214
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:33,910
Oh, there's Grangle!

3215
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:35,250
There's Grangle!

3216
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:35,690
There's Grangle!

3217
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:36,250
Is that Dingbong?

3218
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:37,110
Yeah.

3219
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:38,450
There he is!

3220
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:42,170
I mean, it looks like you might be able to climb up there as well.

3221
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,390
You know, if you wanted to give it a go.

3222
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,450
Where did you die?

3223
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:46,770
No, look at- look at Ms. Hellfire.

3224
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:49,110
Look- Yeah, there's no way I'm gonna make it.

3225
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,390
I told you!

3226
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:52,770
I need to go- Nuffy's gonna gamer her way up.

3227
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:53,510
You can!

3228
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:54,070
You can!

3229
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:55,690
No, no, don't give it to me!

3230
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:57,830
Don't feed it to- Don't waste it on me!

3231
01:34:58,270 --> 01:34:59,310
You're like allergic!

3232
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:00,510
No police anything!

3233
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:02,670
Save it for yourself!

3234
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,010
I have my EpiPen!

3235
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:06,610
I have like- I have like almost more than half.

3236
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,350
I'm good.

3237
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:12,190
No, if you see what we saw, Ms. Hellfire, you do not want her to have it.

3238
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:12,690
I know!

3239
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,270
I don't know.

3240
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:17,310
Should we go here?

3241
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:19,630
I'm gonna follow you, Scout Master.

3242
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:22,770
Okay, you're the new Scout Master.

3243
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:24,050
Oh no!

3244
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:24,770
Oops, ouch!

3245
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:25,810
I'm fine.

3246
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:26,790
You're not the Scout Master.

3247
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,750
Oh, what is this?

3248
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:40,390
I think I see a mushroom!

3249
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:42,590
Oh, look at that!

3250
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:44,030
Look at that's a glowing thing!

3251
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,770
It's a- It's one of those things!

3252
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:48,810
It's a baton!

3253
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,750
I found an old baton.

3254
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:54,590
You can't see anything.

3255
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,770
I think I just look blind.

3256
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,370
Uh-oh.

3257
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:58,250
Hello?

3258
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:05,690
Are you over here?

3259
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:06,870
Don't go, Freddy!

3260
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:07,450
Stop!

3261
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:08,370
Stop!

3262
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:12,970
I can't!

3263
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:14,470
Wait, I can see your name!

3264
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:16,170
You look like God!

3265
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:17,330
Huh?

3266
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:22,170
I can see nothing but bright lights and you're just radiating behind it.

3267
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:24,410
You look like a- you look like a holy intervention.

3268
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:26,650
Oh, I can't make it.

3269
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,110
I need you to climb that, yeah.

3270
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:32,550
Wait, we could have just followed the old thing.

3271
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,370
Oh, there's a suitcase up there!

3272
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:36,150
It's gonna be stuffed!

3273
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:37,410
Yeah, there's a suitcase!

3274
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:40,390
Try and climb on the right side.

3275
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:41,710
The right side's less steep.

3276
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:45,490
It didn't look like that at all for me.

3277
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:46,670
Wait, I'm gonna climb this tree.

3278
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:48,970
Is this a better idea?

3279
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:56,610
Is this a better idea?

3280
01:36:58,730 --> 01:36:59,090
Uh-oh.

3281
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:00,030
Hey, what are you talking about?

3282
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:01,270
Hey, you went up the right hand side!

3283
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,350
Yeah, I listened to Laimu.

3284
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:06,370
The-the scout master.

3285
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:10,310
The scout master, the butterfinger to jump.

3286
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:11,670
Wait, there's only a- And now I'm scout dancer.

3287
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:13,510
There's only a rope in here though.

3288
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:15,970
That's unfortunate.

3289
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:19,170
I'm in the deep of the scout master!

3290
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:20,090
Hello!

3291
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:23,590
I like all the ice rocks hanging out next to the actual lava.

3292
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:24,810
That seems-that seems okay.

3293
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:27,510
I think this was actually the more correct path.

3294
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:31,490
Yeah, there's like a-there's a hole- No, I-I-I-I, you can do either.

3295
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:32,550
I fucking hate internally.

3296
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:39,650
So, internally like, takes out the storm, but then every time you touch those blue rocks, you accumulate freezing points.

3297
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:42,570
So if you have to, like, run across them or something, enter.

3298
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:46,570
Here, I can think I can do it.

3299
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:47,610
You can pull the heat pack, though, and do it.

3300
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:48,730
You can probably make it.

3301
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:52,810
Well, the problem is, is there anything above this, though?

3302
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:54,070
I don't think so.

3303
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:55,350
No, there's not really.

3304
01:37:56,730 --> 01:38:00,610
Go this far left, you see what I see?

3305
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,070
There's rocks there.

3306
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:05,290
What is this?

3307
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,990
Are these good for your soul or bad?

3308
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:09,710
The glowy blue one?

3309
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:10,990
Oh, that is good for your soul.

3310
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:11,870
Hide it.

3311
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:13,470
Not that close.

3312
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,090
I'm trying.

3313
01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:17,290
Is it warm?

3314
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:20,570
Yeah, too hot.

3315
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:21,610
Too hot.

3316
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:22,750
What does the grungle do?

3317
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:25,190
Where'd he go?

3318
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:26,270
Oh, he didn't do anything.

3319
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,810
Haha, grungle.

3320
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,630
He's just like a little companion.

3321
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:33,870
I'll put him in your backpack.

3322
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:34,430
This is definitely the right way.

3323
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:35,930
Definitely.

3324
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:38,350
I told you guys.

3325
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:39,630
Why are you gonna climb that?

3326
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:40,290
Oh, look it.

3327
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:43,770
This is all I can do.

3328
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:45,790
Ooh, delicious.

3329
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:47,130
What is it?

3330
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:47,550
For you.

3331
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:48,370
No, she's not hungry.

3332
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:49,650
No, I'm not hungry.

3333
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:50,410
I'm not hungry.

3334
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:52,170
It's great.

3335
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:53,850
It was just a little treat.

3336
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,910
Why do you keep doing this?

3337
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:58,470
Oh my gosh.

3338
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,490
I think we're heading back to the capybara.

3339
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:05,870
It's gonna be that kind of grandma where you visit and then like you're trying to leave and she's like, oh, take these with you.

3340
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:06,790
Oh, and these as well.

3341
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:11,710
And then she like finds like, I don't know, like eight different cakes and she's like, you should take some of these as well.

3342
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:14,190
And then a snack for the road and you can use this for your dinner.

3343
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,970
I can see the capybara from here.

3344
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:19,350
Oh, shoot.

3345
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:20,010
Uh oh.

3346
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,070
Uh oh.

3347
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:21,690
I'm safe.

3348
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:23,730
I think.

3349
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:25,810
Oh, she's safe now.

3350
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:27,070
Come to me.

3351
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:29,090
It's good here.

3352
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:30,130
Be careful though.

3353
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,990
If I fall, I'll die.

3354
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,230
It's a bizarre travasse between us.

3355
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,890
No, you won't.

3356
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,530
You'll be fine.

3357
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:37,130
Ah, we'll see about that.

3358
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,730
Why is the grungle so heavy, actually?

3359
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:40,870
I'm gonna get rid of him.

3360
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,330
No, I carried him the entire way.

3361
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:45,570
Don't you fucking dare.

3362
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:48,230
You whore.

3363
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:51,570
I don't even have anything in my inventory.

3364
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:54,210
I lost like 10 pounds in my inventory.

3365
01:39:55,810 --> 01:40:01,270
Okay, so that was the weight of your heart shriveling into a prune.

3366
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:02,750
Do you see my health?

3367
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:04,330
There is no...

3368
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:06,710
You could have given it to Snuffy.

3369
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:08,890
Sacrifices are supposed to be made.

3370
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:11,470
Oh, the snowstorm's gone.

3371
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:12,850
Okay, I'm gonna jump for it.

3372
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:14,810
Throw the ring in the volcano.

3373
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,490
It's like, it's like the ring from Lord of the Rings.

3374
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:22,030
Yeah, but throwing it in the volcano.

3375
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:23,190
You guys were...

3376
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,730
Little do you know you've cursed the entire run because you let him die.

3377
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:28,770
Oh, yeah, that's what cursed the run.

3378
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:31,090
You really think you see we're gonna make it to the top.

3379
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:32,650
Do you really think?

3380
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:36,810
You guys were like, my precious grungle.

3381
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,870
And you just couldn't see...

3382
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:39,750
It's grungle!

3383
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,350
You couldn't see...

3384
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:43,470
The...

3385
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,250
The truth.

3386
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:46,670
I showed it to you.

3387
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:50,330
I'm following Snum.

3388
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:50,970
Snum vision.

3389
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:51,590
Thank you.

3390
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,010
Snum vision.

3391
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:53,810
It's a tall vision.

3392
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:56,890
I mean, snums naturally are pretty good in the snow, so...

3393
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:57,150
Yeah.

3394
01:40:58,650 --> 01:40:59,370
Oh, dang.

3395
01:40:59,770 --> 01:40:59,930
Oh!

3396
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:01,070
No, nevermind.

3397
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:02,150
Oh, there's the blizzard.

3398
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:02,810
Hide!

3399
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:03,370
Come here!

3400
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:04,710
It's actually, you're making good progress.

3401
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,170
You found a better part of the mountain to climb.

3402
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:06,870
I believe in you.

3403
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,790
I don't have any...

3404
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:10,810
I have a rope.

3405
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:11,570
Actually, hold on.

3406
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,050
Let me put this into your back.

3407
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:13,310
It's...

3408
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:14,930
It's a new map every day.

3409
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:15,550
Doki.

3410
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:16,950
But it's the same map each time.

3411
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,690
So if we tried it again, it would be the same mountain.

3412
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:19,470
Yeah, so we'll know.

3413
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:21,410
We'll know how that will be this way.

3414
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:22,270
Yeah.

3415
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:23,910
Okay.

3416
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:24,950
I'm trying.

3417
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:26,470
Let me try and climb this tree.

3418
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,150
Okay.

3419
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:28,950
And then...

3420
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:30,210
And then either...

3421
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:30,670
I think...

3422
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:31,770
Oh.

3423
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:32,230
Oh.

3424
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:33,390
Okay.

3425
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:35,090
You just tell your friends to just die.

3426
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:36,710
No, I said either.

3427
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:37,710
Just jump up.

3428
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:38,910
No, I'm talking about Doki.

3429
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:39,450
I said...

3430
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:40,870
You should just die.

3431
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,050
I expected that.

3432
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:44,350
It's such an easier decision to make.

3433
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:46,010
Don't you guys like the easy choice?

3434
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:47,230
Yeah, I love...

3435
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:47,590
Oh, no.

3436
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:48,110
Uh-oh.

3437
01:41:48,810 --> 01:41:50,010
Right here, right here, right here.

3438
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:50,590
Maybe?

3439
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,130
Uh, nope.

3440
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:52,610
Nope.

3441
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,210
Never mind.

3442
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:54,450
No, I'm dying.

3443
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:55,190
Oh.

3444
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:56,690
Oh, gosh.

3445
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:57,510
I'm trying.

3446
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:58,090
Oh.

3447
01:41:58,610 --> 01:41:58,730
Oh.

3448
01:41:59,230 --> 01:41:59,330
Oh.

3449
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:17,450
Good thing I gave her the rope, right?

3450
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:19,250
I give up.

3451
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:20,370
Press an E.

3452
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:20,730
Oh.

3453
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:23,170
Oh.

3454
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:23,410
Look at me.

3455
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:23,770
Oh, no.

3456
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,250
No.

3457
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:24,690
Oh, no.

3458
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,330
Stop it.

3459
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:30,470
Your body was never found.

3460
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,190
New hat.

3461
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:42,340
Hat.

3462
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,540
Oh, give me a witch.

3463
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:45,060
Ooh.

3464
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:46,360
Explorer.

3465
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:46,460
Four.

3466
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,340
How many...

3467
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:51,440
Oh, I guess there must be, what?

3468
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:51,900
Two more?

3469
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:52,200
Three?

3470
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:54,300
Maybe?

3471
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:56,740
Grungled.

3472
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:58,940
Oh.

3473
01:42:59,180 --> 01:42:59,920
We got cursed.

3474
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,920
You threw the grungle and he like...

3475
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,880
I told you.

3476
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,160
You threw bing bong and he lives.

3477
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,000
Why are your eyes...

3478
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,080
Why do you look like that?

3479
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,700
You can't just say that about your friends.

3480
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,140
Are you okay?

3481
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,200
Were your eyes always like that?

3482
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,310
Maybe they were always like that.

3483
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:21,190
They're so far into her head.

3484
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:22,070
I know.

3485
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:25,270
It looks like she's got like a migraine.

3486
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,390
She is actually Blair Witching.

3487
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:29,990
What's wrong?

3488
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:30,850
Oh.

3489
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:31,330
Dude.

3490
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:32,670
Not good.

3491
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:33,890
What's that good?

3492
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:34,850
You good?

3493
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:38,250
Oh.

3494
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:39,290
Oh no.

3495
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:40,750
Oh no.

3496
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:43,090
It's been turning off all day.

3497
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:43,610
Come in.

3498
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:43,830
Come in.

3499
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:44,410
To us.

3500
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,170
You may have a power problem.

3501
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:46,970
Oh my god.

3502
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:48,930
I tried it on YouTube.

3503
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:52,050
Are you good?

3504
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:53,450
I don't know.

3505
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,490
Your whole computer might be like...

3506
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:55,950
Breaking.

3507
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:56,790
I know.

3508
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:58,290
You're cutting it out.

3509
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:58,970
Doki.

3510
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,590
She's like fucking possessed.

3511
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:01,710
That's actually terrifying.

3512
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:01,950
She's alive.

3513
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:03,910
She's literally like...

3514
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:07,050
Put her back in the elevator.

3515
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:09,610
Be gone.

3516
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,630
Put your back in there.

3517
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:12,550
Be gone.

3518
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:13,250
She won't go.

3519
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:14,930
She's heavy.

3520
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,190
She's resisting.

3521
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,360
Oh god.

3522
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:22,860
Oh god.

3523
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,800
She's moving.

3524
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:27,940
What is she doing?

3525
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,480
She's moving.

3526
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,380
Breaking it down.

3527
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,540
No, no, no, no.

3528
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,400
I don't like that.

3529
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,420
Oh, Doki's streaming offline.

3530
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,560
Oh, it did?

3531
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:39,860
It's gone, gone.

3532
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:40,240
Yeah.

3533
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:41,420
Is it gonna...

3534
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,040
Hold on, hold on.

3535
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:42,680
Let me try something.

3536
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:44,860
Doki!

3537
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,700
Come back to us!

3538
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:49,660
Grab my hand, Doki!

3539
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:49,780
Doki!

3540
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:51,540
Doki!

3541
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:51,840
Doki!

3542
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:52,240
Grab my hand!

3543
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:55,440
Laimu, are you okay?

3544
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,880
It's the capybara curse!

3545
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:04,680
They didn't capybara!

3546
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:08,160
They didn't grace a capybara, and now they've been like...

3547
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,620
They've been shadow...

3548
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,400
Shadow banned!

3549
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:10,720
Shadow banned!

3550
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:11,800
Her eyes are freaking out too!

3551
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:13,200
They are?

3552
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:14,240
Llama, wake up!

3553
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,280
Snap out of it!

3554
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,080
Oh no!

3555
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:17,540
Hey, I'm back!

3556
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,380
Did Doki's possession end?

3557
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:23,940
Like, as I walked into the room, she was twitching and her eyes were rolling back into her head.

3558
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:24,840
Is she good?

3559
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:25,840
The stream died!

3560
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:26,820
She's gone!

3561
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:27,600
Oh no!

3562
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,920
It wasn't your fault, but it might have been ours.

3563
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,880
I think it's because she didn't pet the capybara.

3564
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,660
I think so too.

3565
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:36,960
True.

3566
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,120
I mean...

3567
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,000
Like, you know...

3568
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,660
As things go, I feel like that was actually a really good run.

3569
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,200
Like...

3570
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:49,780
I'm surprised that our first run, considering that Ndoki hadn't done it either, we actually made that far.

3571
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,400
I don't even think my first run was that good.

3572
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,540
You got pretty far!

3573
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:53,420
Yeah!

3574
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,340
Proud of us.

3575
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:58,160
On my first run, I didn't know it was timed, so I was like...

3576
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,360
Taking such scenic routes, and I was like...

3577
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,580
Getting so immersed, and I was like...

3578
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:04,380
Yeah, and then the fog shows up, and it's like, oh no.

3579
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:04,960
Get fog.

3580
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,080
It was like, this is...

3581
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:06,940
It's getting misty!

3582
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:07,800
This is cool weather!

3583
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,280
And then I'm like, freezing to death.

3584
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,600
I guess...

3585
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,560
I guess Doki is restarting her PC.

3586
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:15,300
Okay.

3587
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:16,900
Okie dokie.

3588
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:20,740
That's a good one.

3589
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,280
Thanks.

3590
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:22,660
Yeah.

3591
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,920
That's really original.

3592
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:25,040
I'm gonna go...

3593
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,100
I'm gonna go...

3594
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:27,380
Do some cool...

3595
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:28,800
poses in the mirror.

3596
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,540
Hopefully if she fixes her computer...

3597
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:31,700
I can do one more run if she fixes her computer.

3598
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,100
Yeah, yeah.

3599
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:33,920
I guess I'll just...

3600
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:34,400
Cause it's like...

3601
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,120
It's like 1am.

3602
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,000
Oh no!

3603
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,380
It's fine, it's fine.

3604
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,940
I have stupid sleeping hours anyway.

3605
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:43,880
Change my hat!

3606
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:44,620
But I like my hat!

3607
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,040
I'm gonna take a nap at the airport like when you do.

3608
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:46,800
Minto, if you...

3609
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,460
If you dance and then stick your heart...

3610
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,440
Your arm out, you can like whip a nae nae.

3611
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:51,720
What?

3612
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:04,480
Nene!

3613
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:05,720
Whip!

3614
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:06,300
Whip!

3615
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,120
Nene!

3616
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,500
Watch me!

3617
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:10,120
Whip!

3618
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,560
Watch me nae nae!

3619
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,020
Watch me whip!

3620
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:22,660
Watch me nae nae nae!

3621
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,340
Yay!

3622
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:28,900
Welcome back!

3623
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,120
Oh well I guess she can't hear me right...

3624
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:32,780
...for it's back in the red side of Sun...

3625
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:32,840
Oh is she in?

3626
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:33,800
I suddenly said...

3627
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,760
Oh is she on Discord?

3628
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,700
The spirit of Doki is returning, I sent her!

3629
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,500
Oh yay!

3630
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,060
Dude, it was honestly...

3631
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:41,360
As I walked back into the room...

3632
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,880
She was just like looking straight up...

3633
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,860
Her eyes rolled back and her...

3634
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,180
I know!

3635
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,440
Her like dupe was twitching...

3636
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,200
It was fucking awful!

3637
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:46,500
It was scary!

3638
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,740
It was actually scary!

3639
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,620
I don't...

3640
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:54,320
I don't think...

3641
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,080
I'm gonna invite her or something...

3642
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,340
How do you invite people to this game?

3643
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:58,260
Oh there's a...

3644
01:47:58,260 --> 01:47:59,780
There's a little thing over here...

3645
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,980
It says invite...

3646
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:02,440
Invite friends...

3647
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,140
Uh Doki...

3648
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:03,440
Oh yeah...

3649
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:03,760
I am...

3650
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,680
I sent one...

3651
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,520
Okay good good...

3652
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,360
Bing bong!

3653
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,720
Oh wait...

3654
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:11,520
Maybe that's where I got Grunkle from...

3655
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,000
Oh wait no...

3656
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,440
Bing bong was his actual name...

3657
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:19,610
I still don't know where you got Grunkle from...

3658
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:20,730
Hello!

3659
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:22,190
What happened?

3660
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:23,610
Oh my...

3661
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,770
What happened to me?

3662
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:25,770
It was...

3663
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:26,150
It was...

3664
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:28,370
You were legitimately possessed...

3665
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:29,370
Oh wait...

3666
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:32,310
It's like...

3667
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,330
My main father died...

3668
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:35,570
And then like...

3669
01:48:35,570 --> 01:48:36,030
Everything was...

3670
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:36,470
I just...

3671
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:38,030
I just feel like...

3672
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,550
Like...

3673
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:40,850
Everyone cut in and out...

3674
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:41,110
And then...

3675
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:41,910
And then like...

3676
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:43,450
Everyone just kept looping...

3677
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:43,770
I just...

3678
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:44,810
All I heard was just...

3679
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:45,550
Me laughing...

3680
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:47,010
And it was the same laugh...

3681
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:47,790
Over...

3682
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:49,050
And over...

3683
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:50,470
And over again.

3684
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:51,670
It never stopped.

3685
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:55,010
And then I force quit my game.

3686
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:57,630
That sounds like a nightmare.

3687
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:01,070
Legitimately, you got Bing Bong cursed.

3688
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:01,930
That's fucked up.

3689
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:05,830
She was the one that threw it in the hole.

3690
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:06,410
Whip.

3691
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:06,890
Whip.

3692
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:07,870
Watch me, Nae Nae.

3693
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:09,410
Whip.

3694
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:10,030
Whip.

3695
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:11,190
Nae Nae.

3696
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:13,730
Whip.

3697
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:14,430
Whip.

3698
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:15,570
Nae Nae.

3699
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:18,850
I taught her to whip and Nae Nae.

3700
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:22,870
I need a... Am I the same character?

3701
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:23,770
Yeah, you are.

3702
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,450
I'm a lawnmower, guys.

3703
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:28,670
I need some guy to help me again.

3704
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:30,130
Everything reset itself.

3705
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,050
What the fuck did you do?

3706
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:38,410
Wait, what did you do?

3707
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,410
I was doing the lawnmower.

3708
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:40,970
You danced.

3709
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:46,310
Wait, you... We have a new hat.

3710
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:51,530
I have a new hat.

3711
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:52,750
Oh, yeah.

3712
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:53,050
Oh.

3713
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:54,250
Oh, nice.

3714
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:54,490
Yeah.

3715
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:56,250
You look... Oh, I like your hat.

3716
01:49:56,650 --> 01:49:57,490
I don't like it.

3717
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:58,190
It's my hat.

3718
01:49:59,070 --> 01:49:59,690
Wait, why?

3719
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:01,050
I have an objective for you.

3720
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:01,850
I don't like your hat either.

3721
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,390
If you bring the bugle to the capybaras and play it to them, you get a hat.

3722
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:06,470
No way.

3723
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:06,990
Really?

3724
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,910
Yeah.

3725
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:08,990
They like your music.

3726
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:09,430
Let's go.

3727
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:10,150
Let's go.

3728
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:10,150
No!

3729
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:13,290
Cute.

3730
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:14,530
I didn't know that.

3731
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:15,050
It's happening.

3732
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:16,550
It's happening.

3733
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:17,450
Everything paused.

3734
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:18,630
Oh, my God.

3735
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:18,870
What?

3736
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:20,090
Is your computer dying?

3737
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:21,110
Are you okay?

3738
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,510
Oh, my God.

3739
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:23,550
I'm not okay.

3740
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:26,450
There's no way Peak is gonna destroy my PC.

3741
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:29,250
Have you... Is your framerate capped?

3742
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,930
Or, you know, are you overheating your computer with Peak?

3743
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:32,430
No.

3744
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:35,850
No, I capped it at... I'm gonna capped it at 144.

3745
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:40,350
The people can only see 60.

3746
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:42,670
Okay, you shut the fuck up right now.

3747
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:43,270
Shut up, man.

3748
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:44,230
You shut up.

3749
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:44,950
You shut up.

3750
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:45,370
Oh, my God.

3751
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:47,070
Why is my PC?

3752
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:49,590
You see gamers are like, shut the fuck up.

3753
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:50,430
Shut the fuck up.

3754
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:52,350
Why?

3755
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:53,350
I hate my PC.

3756
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:53,730
Stop.

3757
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:57,070
You just push your... No!

3758
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:02,940
Whip.

3759
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:03,460
Whip.

3760
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:04,000
Nene.

3761
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,040
No.

3762
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:04,840
No.

3763
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:05,240
No.

3764
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,080
No.

3765
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:11,580
All right.

3766
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:11,800
Wait.

3767
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:11,940
Wait.

3768
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,040
Do you need... Do you need to tap out?

3769
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:14,120
Yeah, wait.

3770
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:17,480
I didn't... It's... It's my sound guide lets me know if everyone's volume...

3771
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,900
Apparently, when you rejoin a session, it resets your volume sliders.

3772
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:21,560
It does, yeah.

3773
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:22,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3774
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:28,520
Yeah, so I didn't know if everything... I didn't know if all the volume's okay.

3775
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,080
Oh, my God.

3776
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,300
I'm ready, though.

3777
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:31,820
I'm ready.

3778
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:32,800
Go on vacation.

3779
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:33,780
Wee!

3780
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:33,860
Wee.

3781
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:34,820
Come on vacation.

3782
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,280
Demon's doing the splits on the elevator.

3783
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:38,060
Wee.

3784
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:39,600
Wee.

3785
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:40,240
Wee!

3786
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:40,260
Wee.

3787
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:40,500
Wee.

3788
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:40,980
Wee.

3789
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:41,040
Wee.

3790
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:41,060
Wee.

3791
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:41,100
Wee.

3792
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:41,100
Wee.

3793
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:42,220
Oh, my God.

3794
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,220
So are you.

3795
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,760
Let's gooo.

3796
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,100
They call me the Man of Steel.

3797
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,200
I'm ready.

3798
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:55,640
I'm ready.

3799
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,540
I'm locked in.

3800
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,460
I'm pouring my ticket.

3801
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,500
Wait.

3802
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,900
She's doing a thing.

3803
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,370
I can't.

3804
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:17,190
I'm crying.

3805
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:18,950
I'm alive.

3806
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,430
We're alive.

3807
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:22,950
Alright, skats.

3808
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,730
Give me the bugle.

3809
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:28,610
Oh, how did I grab... I didn't grab that.

3810
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:31,210
It's always about the bugle.

3811
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:32,590
Give me the bugle.

3812
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:33,970
Give it to me.

3813
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:37,210
Maybe that's why you called it the bungle.

3814
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:39,170
That's only one letter away from bugle.

3815
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:41,670
You were just thinking about your bugle this whole time.

3816
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:48,670
I think you get a hat if you take him to the top, too.

3817
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:49,650
Take him.

3818
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:51,030
We have two missions.

3819
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:51,530
Scout.

3820
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:52,270
Thank you.

3821
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:53,330
Who's taking Bungle?

3822
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:55,230
Take Bungle.

3823
01:52:55,570 --> 01:52:56,850
You take him, Snuffy.

3824
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:57,770
I got food.

3825
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:59,070
I'll take Bungle.

3826
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:00,570
I want to grab the food, too.

3827
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:01,550
Wait, who has the backpack?

3828
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:02,850
Me!

3829
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,830
Oh.

3830
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,590
Okay, now we're not gonna...

3831
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:06,070
Show the way now!

3832
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:06,670
We're gonna go.

3833
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:07,490
We know, yeah.

3834
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,050
Lead the way, Scoutmaster!

3835
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:10,830
Lead the way!

3836
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:12,630
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3837
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:17,830
I'm gonna get a coconut for the journey.

3838
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:20,130
We don't need the compass, I don't think.

3839
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,290
Oh!

3840
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:23,170
Actually, if you take the compass...

3841
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:23,250
No!

3842
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:25,790
I got a granola bar.

3843
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:26,410
I got a snack for a long time.

3844
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:28,350
It's a sacred piece of Scout merchandise!

3845
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:31,550
We don't need the compass where we're going.

3846
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:32,530
Go!

3847
01:53:36,670 --> 01:53:37,670
Gosh, my...

3848
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:39,750
My lung capacity is great.

3849
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:42,610
Oh, there's that floating guy again!

3850
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:44,770
Wait, so it's the same map now, right?

3851
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:46,250
Yeah, it's the same map.

3852
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:46,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3853
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:47,490
It's the same map.

3854
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:50,130
Do you remember how we got to the top?

3855
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:51,590
No.

3856
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:56,490
Who just said no?

3857
01:53:57,470 --> 01:53:57,950
Coconut!

3858
01:53:58,570 --> 01:53:59,310
Coconut's on the floor!

3859
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,850
I pick one up.

3860
01:54:00,850 --> 01:54:01,230
Yeah!

3861
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,110
I have a little snack.

3862
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:04,670
And I threw it on the floor!

3863
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:05,310
Oh!

3864
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:05,950
Ah!

3865
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:06,890
Ah!

3866
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:08,350
Wait, what happened to me?

3867
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:11,110
Wait, Limeo, I'll put it in your backpack.

3868
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:12,370
Oh, yeah, I mean...

3869
01:54:12,370 --> 01:54:13,110
They're very heavy.

3870
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:14,210
Just eat them now, I think.

3871
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:14,610
Oh, okay.

3872
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:17,330
Yeah, they're like super heavy for what they are.

3873
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:19,590
I'll carry this one for me.

3874
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:20,390
I just...

3875
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,750
You put that shit in my backpack, didn't you?

3876
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:22,710
No.

3877
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:23,830
Okay.

3878
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:25,310
Yeah, I believe you.

3879
01:54:25,470 --> 01:54:27,670
I mean, the number went up to show that you did, but okay.

3880
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:29,390
Let me check.

3881
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:30,290
Let me check for you.

3882
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:32,550
Maybe you went through like a growth spurt.

3883
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:35,210
Yeah, maybe you had pu- second puberty.

3884
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:38,710
You gained an extra appendage.

3885
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:39,350
Did you check?

3886
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:40,750
Yeah, I did.

3887
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:44,090
I checked.

3888
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:46,210
And did you put more in my fucking backpack, Min?

3889
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:50,190
Did she check?

3890
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:51,490
No, I just went to check.

3891
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:56,410
What do you- why did I get in?

3892
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,310
She's the one that pointed in!

3893
01:54:59,430 --> 01:55:00,910
It was awful!

3894
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:02,190
It was awful!

3895
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:02,410
It was awful!

3896
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:05,730
And then Snuffy put one in my fucking backpack as well because I still have four!

3897
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:07,150
Snuffy map saved it!

3898
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:09,670
Put your coconut in your backpack!

3899
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:11,370
It wasn't neat!

3900
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:11,990
Wait, what the heck?

3901
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:13,710
Wait, you guys need to look at this.

3902
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:16,410
There's something of- this whole map is very obscure.

3903
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:17,130
Why?

3904
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:17,550
It is.

3905
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:18,630
Oh yeah!

3906
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:21,190
I like- I like the mushrooms growing on the suitcase.

3907
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:24,790
Those are the roots that I- that were the- the- the roots from before.

3908
01:55:25,490 --> 01:55:27,850
It was left to- Somebody had some home growing in here.

3909
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:28,870
Are you safe?

3910
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:30,830
Are you tired?

3911
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:31,530
Are you okay?

3912
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:33,390
I'll eat it.

3913
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:34,310
I'll chop this.

3914
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:35,690
Alright.

3915
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:36,930
It's safe.

3916
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:38,770
Maybe if you eat one.

3917
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,370
Is it?

3918
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:41,830
Maybe just one.

3919
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:42,390
Just one.

3920
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,510
Just a little poison as a treat.

3921
01:55:46,510 --> 01:55:49,870
Like- I think I have a better tolerance now.

3922
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:54,990
Yeah, like you- If you eat poisonous mushrooms once a day, you become immune.

3923
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:58,250
I saw an- I saw an art- like I saw like a tweet.

3924
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:01,850
Where someone was like, I shot myself in the leg.

3925
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,210
Um, every day.

3926
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:03,970
Oh yeah.

3927
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:06,530
I can make my skin bulletproof.

3928
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:08,990
And then I see that tweet.

3929
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:10,510
Nothing to lose.

3930
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,890
Hang on.

3931
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:13,370
Thicments.

3932
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:14,270
A scout.

3933
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:15,570
Thicments!

3934
01:56:15,570 --> 01:56:16,170
Oh!

3935
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:16,870
Oh!

3936
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:18,550
I got an energy drink.

3937
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:21,570
It's kind of weird that they just put you on a box like this.

3938
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:22,830
It's an American only.

3939
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:23,410
Whoa!

3940
01:56:24,130 --> 01:56:24,170
Whoa!

3941
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:25,710
Whoa!

3942
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:26,810
Oh, I need those.

3943
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,890
Did you just use the energy drink?

3944
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,250
Was I not supposed to?

3945
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,870
Yeah!

3946
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,450
Oh, it's- it's fine.

3947
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:34,970
Oh, I'm tired now.

3948
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:36,170
Yeah.

3949
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,710
Aw.

3950
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,750
Wait, how do I get untired?

3951
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:41,530
Can I take a nap?

3952
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:44,470
Apparently this guy was trying to- Nah, you just wait.

3953
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:45,630
Okay, I'm gonna play dead.

3954
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:49,130
And then he, like, upgraded to a really strong bullet.

3955
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:50,690
And then he went to the hospital.

3956
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:52,730
Yeah.

3957
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:55,430
Oh, take that granola bar for later.

3958
01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:57,010
No, he was like, I had to stop.

3959
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:59,450
So I hope someone else continues my research.

3960
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,790
More energy drinks.

3961
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:06,550
You had to stop shooting himself in the leg.

3962
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:07,810
Do we go this way?

3963
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:10,710
Cause to the right, I think is the way we went first time and it was no good.

3964
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:11,210
Right?

3965
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:12,190
Yeah!

3966
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:14,950
You're the ones that were supposed to remember for us.

3967
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:17,170
Yeah!

3968
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:17,750
I don't remember.

3969
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:18,890
This is all a blur.

3970
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:24,350
I think I was in fight or flight by the time we- I had no idea what was going on.

3971
01:57:24,350 --> 01:57:27,170
The first two matches were, like, super easy.

3972
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:30,810
And then there was, like, a- some difficulty fight for some reason.

3973
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:31,670
Uh-oh.

3974
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:32,350
Wait.

3975
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:33,370
Uh-oh.

3976
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:33,910
Oh.

3977
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:34,470
Okay.

3978
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,170
I remember we crossed the bridge.

3979
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:37,630
We just gotta find the bridge.

3980
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:39,430
There's been a few.

3981
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:40,310
I think I'm lost.

3982
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:42,070
Wait.

3983
01:57:42,730 --> 01:57:42,950
Oh.

3984
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,870
Don't come to me.

3985
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:45,830
Don't come to me.

3986
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,430
I don't know if anybody was in a hurry.

3987
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:52,430
You were, like, throwing yourself into a pit.

3988
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:53,390
Me?

3989
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:54,750
Yeah.

3990
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:56,610
Can we go here?

3991
01:57:59,330 --> 01:58:00,570
Can we climb up here?

3992
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:01,810
Can we walk on this?

3993
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:03,250
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

3994
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:04,030
Just a little bit.

3995
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:04,850
Okay.

3996
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:08,330
You can then go, like, here, and then here, and I'll- I'll- I'll catch you.

3997
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:09,890
I'll- I'll, like, bring you up.

3998
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:10,850
Okay.

3999
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:11,810
Bulletproof.

4000
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,870
Wait, what is that big ol' character?

4001
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:14,930
You might be able to walk up that way.

4002
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:16,570
Nothing to lose.

4003
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:18,130
I'm heading up.

4004
01:58:18,130 --> 01:58:20,430
Fire away, fire away.

4005
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:23,310
I only know the My Little Pony version of that song.

4006
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:25,850
I'm s- What's the Pony version of that song?

4007
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:26,850
Yeah, what's the Pony version?

4008
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:28,130
It's called Octavia.

4009
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:31,710
I am Octavia.

4010
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:33,750
Oh, thank you.

4011
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,530
There you go.

4012
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:35,550
You're welcome.

4013
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:36,870
I almost- I almost didn't make it.

4014
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:41,550
Imagine not making it.

4015
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:43,810
Ah, but I did, so...

4016
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:43,850
Oh, I see the bridge!

4017
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:44,410
I see the bridge!

4018
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:45,670
I'm heading to the bridge!

4019
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:50,110
Oh, we're making such good time, because before, the fog was already at the bridge, right?

4020
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:51,030
Yeah!

4021
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:54,050
How do we get to the- oh, wait, we have to go down.

4022
01:58:56,690 --> 01:58:57,450
Look at us go!

4023
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:58,210
We're speedrunning!

4024
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:00,610
We're speedrunning!

4025
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:10,440
I don't think it's your monitor.

4026
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,260
You literally had to reset your PC.

4027
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:16,840
Yeah, if your whole computer turned off, I think it might be like your graphics card or driver or something.

4028
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,620
Not again?

4029
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:18,860
Not again!

4030
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:19,700
Not again!

4031
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:20,800
Not again?

4032
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,220
Why do I always get these PC problems?

4033
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:25,260
Not again?

4034
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:26,960
Not again?

4035
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,340
What are you doing to your poor PC?

4036
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:30,500
I don't know!

4037
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:32,200
I don't know!

4038
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:34,100
I don't even know.

4039
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:35,800
I think we went- yeah.

4040
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:36,320
What about going after this?

4041
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:37,860
Oh, up!

4042
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:38,500
Go up!

4043
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:39,000
Turn around!

4044
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:40,620
Yeah.

4045
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:42,560
Is it- this way?

4046
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:43,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4047
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:46,220
I don't know where you're going, I wasn't looking.

4048
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:46,840
Okay.

4049
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:49,880
It's Marvel Rivals is what my chat said.

4050
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:51,820
Marvel Rivals?

4051
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:54,020
Have you tried uninstalling Marvel Rivals?

4052
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:58,280
Yeah, it's like maybe it's Marvel Rivals mining all that crypto on your computer.

4053
01:59:58,520 --> 01:59:59,460
Yeah, it's mining crypto.

4054
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:01,900
Oh wait, I need a rush.

4055
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:07,280
Oh yeah, I launched Marvel Rivals for like the first time since the tournament just to buy Loki in a swimsuit.

4056
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:11,440
Oh yeah, he's like... he has a bug too.

4057
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,420
His whole thing is out, it's amazing.

4058
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,340
It's actually an actual bug.

4059
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:17,040
Yeah, I bought that so quick.

4060
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:19,620
Yeah, they're finally giving people what they want.

4061
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,980
Yeah, yeah, he has a bulge.

4062
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:23,420
Help!

4063
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:24,960
That's so far!

4064
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,360
Thank you.

4065
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:28,540
Crane quench!

4066
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:29,500
Crane quench!

4067
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:29,940
Thank you.

4068
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:32,480
Is it left side?

4069
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:34,120
I don't remember you.

4070
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,400
I don't remember which way we went.

4071
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:37,500
Me too.

4072
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:38,600
I'm gonna Google it.

4073
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:41,840
Somebody check the GPS.

4074
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:42,900
If I... I got my...

4075
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:44,840
Wait, are you Googling Loki's bulge?

4076
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:45,320
Yeah.

4077
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:46,760
Oh, wait.

4078
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,580
Maybe do Marvel Rivals...

4079
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,920
Loki Summer Skin.

4080
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,320
Loki bulge will get me...

4081
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,780
Yeah, maybe don't Google Loki bulge.

4082
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:55,400
Don't just Google Loki's bulge.

4083
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,120
That's not gonna go well.

4084
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:56,400
Don't just Google Loki's bulge.

4085
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:57,340
Don't just do that.

4086
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,900
That might not be the best.

4087
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:00,540
Oh, I did.

4088
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:01,480
But it's not...

4089
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:02,060
Hold on, wait.

4090
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,180
Loki...

4091
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:04,920
That's not fair.

4092
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,540
He was naked, apparently, in the show.

4093
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:07,580
So this was a set up.

4094
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,640
Marvel Rivals...

4095
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:10,320
Summer Skin.

4096
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:12,520
Whoa!

4097
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:14,160
Ah!

4098
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,560
I regret looking it up!

4099
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,380
Minch, are you okay?

4100
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:22,480
Are you screaming because you're falling or screaming because you look at Loki's bulge?

4101
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:23,720
Because I looked at it!

4102
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:25,080
And it looked at me back!

4103
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,680
Wait, where are you guys?

4104
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,220
Oh.

4105
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,560
Uh, we went up.

4106
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,780
We just kept going up while you were moving in.

4107
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:35,200
Okay!

4108
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:37,560
Uh, do you think I can make it?

4109
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:38,100
Or...

4110
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:39,660
This one here, this one here first.

4111
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:39,920
Okay.

4112
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:40,860
Thanks!

4113
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:41,620
I don't see this.

4114
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:42,560
Can you guys linger?

4115
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:45,140
Did you see you're getting a tapeworm?

4116
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:49,020
Because I can't see it, I'm gonna get a tapeworm.

4117
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:50,320
Oh!

4118
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:51,340
Oh, okay, hold on.

4119
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:51,780
Let me...

4120
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,360
Let me send you Loki's bulge.

4121
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:53,760
Give me a minute.

4122
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:57,480
I only got like a Nexus mod link to Loki's bulge.

4123
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,280
No, I had to search the summer skin.

4124
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:02,480
But don't.

4125
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:02,760
Be prepared.

4126
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,380
I put it in the group chat for you, Snuffy.

4127
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:04,880
It's uploading.

4128
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,520
It will look back at you.

4129
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:06,680
Oh my!

4130
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:11,640
That's like real, real?

4131
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:12,560
Uh oh.

4132
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,240
Yeah, it's real.

4133
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:13,960
Uh, Doki!

4134
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,080
Doki!

4135
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:16,020
Oh no!

4136
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:17,860
Doki!

4137
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,270
Mint, are you okay?

4138
02:02:24,650 --> 02:02:25,790
I got you, I got you this time.

4139
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:26,150
Yeah!

4140
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:27,210
Snuffy saved me!

4141
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:29,550
I just...

4142
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:30,050
No!

4143
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:31,870
Doki's not a team player.

4144
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,950
You can stop here if you want first.

4145
02:02:34,290 --> 02:02:35,010
This one works too.

4146
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:37,050
I almost was just too distracted watching Loki bulge.

4147
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:37,390
Stop where?

4148
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:37,690
Here?

4149
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:38,830
Oh.

4150
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:41,330
I got you, I got you.

4151
02:02:41,330 --> 02:02:41,850
Add the lunge.

4152
02:02:41,950 --> 02:02:42,310
Thank you.

4153
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:43,490
This way, Snuffy.

4154
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,910
Okay, I'm coming up through this.

4155
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:47,690
Okay, you're going a different way?

4156
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:48,270
I'm leaving then.

4157
02:02:48,370 --> 02:02:48,590
Bye!

4158
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:49,090
Oh.

4159
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:50,450
I'm right behind you.

4160
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:51,430
Okay.

4161
02:02:51,790 --> 02:02:52,130
Oh.

4162
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:53,070
Look at you.

4163
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:56,370
Why is she talking to herself over there?

4164
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:57,910
I don't know.

4165
02:02:58,150 --> 02:02:59,450
I'm at chat right now.

4166
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:02,550
Why aren't you...

4167
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:03,350
I just put push to talk on.

4168
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:12,930
I swear the fuck, Doki climbs one mountain, she thinks she's a pro.

4169
02:03:13,290 --> 02:03:13,730
I know.

4170
02:03:14,230 --> 02:03:15,550
She's leaving us behind.

4171
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:17,130
We needed her hand.

4172
02:03:18,630 --> 02:03:20,630
Wait, do you have any more coconuts?

4173
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:22,230
Dang, she's all the way over there.

4174
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:23,810
I do not have coconut.

4175
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:24,910
This was not the right way.

4176
02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:25,770
Don't worry, man.

4177
02:03:25,770 --> 02:03:26,330
What's in your bag, though?

4178
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:27,150
It is this way.

4179
02:03:27,570 --> 02:03:28,030
What's in your bag?

4180
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:28,630
I have your specialty.

4181
02:03:29,710 --> 02:03:29,990
Oh.

4182
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:30,710
Oh.

4183
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:33,070
Would you like some thick mint?

4184
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:36,310
Wait, maybe it's...

4185
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:37,290
Wait, no, no, wait.

4186
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:37,790
I just...

4187
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:39,750
Can I have like a little snack?

4188
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:41,270
Wait, who is there?

4189
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,790
Yeah, of course.

4190
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:42,730
It's like multi-use.

4191
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:43,370
Yeah, yeah.

4192
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:44,610
This way, this way.

4193
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:45,670
Thank you.

4194
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:46,330
Which way?

4195
02:03:46,990 --> 02:03:47,470
Of course.

4196
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:48,610
This way, this way.

4197
02:03:50,070 --> 02:03:52,210
I realized I have a granola bar, too.

4198
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:54,010
Oh, this way.

4199
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:54,310
This way, okay.

4200
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:55,370
Alright.

4201
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:56,470
This way.

4202
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:58,550
Follow the Scoutmaster.

4203
02:04:07,230 --> 02:04:08,610
Scoutmaster knows the way.

4204
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:09,670
She know the way.

4205
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,050
She know the way.

4206
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:14,630
She know the way.

4207
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:15,450
She know the way.

4208
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,650
Don't help Doki up.

4209
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:17,030
Thank you.

4210
02:04:22,510 --> 02:04:24,130
Wait, isn't it just one at a time?

4211
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:26,570
Ideally.

4212
02:04:26,950 --> 02:04:27,350
Ideally.

4213
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:28,010
Okay.

4214
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:31,930
You can like roll the dice on it if you want.

4215
02:04:33,450 --> 02:04:35,650
I think I'm ready to start betraying people now.

4216
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:37,450
What?

4217
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:37,550
What?

4218
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:40,070
They climb one mountain and it's all over.

4219
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:41,370
Everybody's turning evil.

4220
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:47,770
Yeah, I climb one mountain and I know what I'm doing.

4221
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:49,350
Like lost or something.

4222
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:50,210
The show.

4223
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:51,390
The show lost?

4224
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:56,170
I've never seen it, so I'm making this claim that I'm alive.

4225
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:56,990
No, no, no, no.

4226
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:57,790
Get away from me.

4227
02:04:57,950 --> 02:04:58,890
Get away from me.

4228
02:04:58,890 --> 02:04:59,570
What?

4229
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:01,290
Those are safe.

4230
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:02,050
I ate them myself.

4231
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:04,350
You can't climb while you have a trumpet.

4232
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:05,670
No, those are safe.

4233
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,350
Red is good.

4234
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:07,250
Green is bad.

4235
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:08,310
Yellow is good.

4236
02:05:08,930 --> 02:05:09,570
Okay, that's good.

4237
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,390
Wait, for what?

4238
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:12,010
For eating.

4239
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:12,730
The first berries.

4240
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:13,310
Oh.

4241
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:14,910
Blue bananas are good too.

4242
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:16,370
I saw that I was trying to force me.

4243
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:17,230
I'm climbing something now.

4244
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:19,730
No, I was selfishly eating it myself.

4245
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:20,770
Oh, hold on.

4246
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:21,290
Thank you.

4247
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:22,150
Oh, thank you.

4248
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:23,070
Oh, there we go.

4249
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:23,530
Thank you.

4250
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:26,070
I see the campfire!

4251
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:29,710
Dang, we really made it through this one fast.

4252
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:30,850
Because we're pros.

4253
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:32,550
We're freaking pros.

4254
02:05:32,890 --> 02:05:33,710
We're freaking awesome.

4255
02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:34,490
I'm not hours too good at this.

4256
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:36,470
You're like...

4257
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:38,630
You were like...

4258
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:41,010
Bashing yourself on the rock like a seal.

4259
02:05:41,150 --> 02:05:42,370
And you're like, We're freaking chaos.

4260
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:44,470
I'm just like...

4261
02:05:48,670 --> 02:05:49,070
Okay.

4262
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:50,770
Yeah.

4263
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:52,010
Oops.

4264
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:52,450
What do we get?

4265
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:53,790
Oh, there's a train launcher.

4266
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:56,630
You have to pick this antidote because she puts everything in her mouth.

4267
02:05:57,010 --> 02:05:57,170
Oh, yeah.

4268
02:05:57,170 --> 02:05:58,030
Get the antidote.

4269
02:05:58,410 --> 02:05:59,150
Oh, I got the back.

4270
02:05:59,510 --> 02:05:59,910
Actually...

4271
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:00,690
The antidote?

4272
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:01,890
I want the fairy.

4273
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:06,130
What is the straw on the foot?

4274
02:06:06,230 --> 02:06:06,250
Oh, we have a moron.

4275
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:08,550
What is this?

4276
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,710
Uhhh...

4277
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:11,850
Oh?

4278
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,310
Why'd it get all scary all of a sudden?

4279
02:06:15,730 --> 02:06:17,970
I got the anti-rope spool!

4280
02:06:19,030 --> 02:06:19,470
Yay.

4281
02:06:20,150 --> 02:06:21,350
Wait, I can pick some stuff up.

4282
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:25,870
Oh, yeah.

4283
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:26,030
Wait.

4284
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:28,030
How much stuff do we got in the...

4285
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:28,550
In the...

4286
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,930
In the...

4287
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:29,990
In the backy packy?

4288
02:06:30,670 --> 02:06:32,070
My backpack's full now.

4289
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:39,010
What if I cook it too much?

4290
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:41,250
It makes it well done.

4291
02:06:41,930 --> 02:06:44,130
What if you do it one more time?

4292
02:06:44,410 --> 02:06:44,790
Is it burnt?

4293
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:47,210
I'm pretty sure.

4294
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:49,870
I don't think you do it three times, you do it two.

4295
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:53,050
Yeah, I think we'd actually... I want that back.

4296
02:06:54,410 --> 02:06:55,190
Oh, yeah.

4297
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:58,870
People keep just putting stuff in my thing!

4298
02:06:59,550 --> 02:06:59,750
Okay.

4299
02:07:02,530 --> 02:07:03,010
Oh!

4300
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:03,890
To the top!

4301
02:07:04,450 --> 02:07:05,210
To the friendship!

4302
02:07:05,510 --> 02:07:06,210
I'm coming!

4303
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:08,350
Isn't there a song from High School Musical?

4304
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:11,930
Like, to the top, bop, bop, bop, to the top, bop, bop, to the top.

4305
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:13,810
Take it higher.

4306
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:16,570
Pop, pop, pop, pop, till we drop.

4307
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:17,570
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

4308
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:20,470
I'm gonna push Doki off the cliff.

4309
02:07:20,950 --> 02:07:21,930
Pop, pop, pop.

4310
02:07:22,330 --> 02:07:24,330
I feel like I'm in, like, a car ride.

4311
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:27,310
Blop, blop, blop.

4312
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:30,550
We're gonna keep pushing higher.

4313
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:33,210
Blop, blop, blop, blop, blop, blop.

4314
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:35,090
I'm following Snuffy.

4315
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:37,610
Blop, blop, blop, blop.

4316
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:38,650
Magic bean!

4317
02:07:38,990 --> 02:07:39,890
Magic bean.

4318
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:41,130
Take ya higher.

4319
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:43,930
Bop, blop, blop.

4320
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:44,510
Bop, blop, blop.

4321
02:07:44,510 --> 02:07:46,810
So, we need to have, like, leftists, right?

4322
02:07:47,190 --> 02:07:47,290
We're Snuffy sisters!

4323
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:47,290
We're Snuffy sisters!

4324
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:48,850
Because we ended up, like, too far right?

4325
02:07:51,110 --> 02:07:51,730
I don't know.

4326
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:52,190
Oh, wait.

4327
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:53,210
I don't think I can take care of this man.

4328
02:07:53,210 --> 02:07:56,010
Yeah, we ended up too far right, so we wanna circle around to the left.

4329
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:56,670
Yeah.

4330
02:07:57,210 --> 02:07:57,810
Oh, okay.

4331
02:07:57,870 --> 02:07:58,610
I dropped down.

4332
02:07:58,750 --> 02:07:59,150
I'm gonna drop this.

4333
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:00,350
Oh, there's a suitcase!

4334
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:01,390
Look, look, look!

4335
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:03,950
Yeah, we saw that before.

4336
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:06,370
I'm grabbing a suitcase.

4337
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:11,890
Yeah, maybe we go more to the left since the right side was, like, suffering last time.

4338
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:13,190
Yeah, yeah.

4339
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:13,830
What is this?

4340
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:16,510
Oh, it's the shelf fungus.

4341
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:19,550
I broke my leg and now I can use a med kit.

4342
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:21,630
Use the energy drink.

4343
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:23,290
Okay.

4344
02:08:23,730 --> 02:08:23,970
Yeah.

4345
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:24,990
Use it.

4346
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:30,130
I'm gonna eat my marshmallow first and then I will put it in here.

4347
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:30,730
Yeah, eat it.

4348
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:31,850
No, drink it.

4349
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:33,270
I did.

4350
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:34,050
Oh.

4351
02:08:35,230 --> 02:08:35,510
Yeah.

4352
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:37,050
Wait, it didn't do the same thing?

4353
02:08:37,170 --> 02:08:37,870
And then we go up.

4354
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:39,070
Yeah.

4355
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:42,610
I'm gonna do the thing.

4356
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:42,990
Wait.

4357
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:44,970
Look at us go.

4358
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:47,430
Where's Snuffy?

4359
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:48,530
I'm gonna climb it.

4360
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:49,290
Snuffy!

4361
02:08:50,370 --> 02:08:54,030
Lava said we shouldn't climb when it's raining, but dude, she's a liar.

4362
02:08:56,450 --> 02:08:58,330
That's our scout master!

4363
02:08:59,210 --> 02:08:59,850
That's our scout...

4364
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:00,990
Scalpin used the vine!

4365
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:01,530
Yeah!

4366
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:04,090
That's cool.

4367
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:04,730
I like that.

4368
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:08,190
Look at you just standing there with no...

4369
02:09:08,190 --> 02:09:09,130
Do you not know...

4370
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:11,450
Do you not know how to use the right button anymore?

4371
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:15,700
Help!

4372
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:16,540
Help!

4373
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:18,060
You bitch.

4374
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,600
Oh my god, I'm okay.

4375
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:21,320
I...

4376
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:21,800
Oh my...

4377
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:22,620
Oh my god.

4378
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:23,040
Oh my god.

4379
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,920
Oh my god.

4380
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:26,500
That was scary.

4381
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,920
I didn't mean to call you a bitch then.

4382
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,500
I thought you were just refusing to help me up.

4383
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:30,000
Are you good?

4384
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,160
I thought so too.

4385
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:32,700
I'm okay.

4386
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,700
I'm okay.

4387
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:34,820
I'm okay.

4388
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,400
The grunkle...

4389
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,740
Guys, my PC...

4390
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:39,760
The grunkle curse is going strong.

4391
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:41,220
Oh my...

4392
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:41,760
I think...

4393
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:44,340
Honestly, I think your computer might be on the way out.

4394
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:44,560
Yeah!

4395
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:45,540
There's something going on.

4396
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:46,980
Oh my god.

4397
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:49,200
Do you have like an Intel CPU?

4398
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,360
Are you melting it away in real time?

4399
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:52,540
Okay, okay.

4400
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:53,180
Oh my god.

4401
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:54,000
PTSD please!

4402
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,940
I think I might have to take you to the doctors later.

4403
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:56,980
I think I might have to take you to the doctors later.

4404
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,620
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

4405
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:02,260
I don't know...

4406
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:03,580
I don't know what's going...

4407
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:04,440
Okay, I have a...

4408
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:04,620
I still think...

4409
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:06,500
I think we need to lean left.

4410
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:07,820
I think so too, yeah.

4411
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,720
I think we're too far right again.

4412
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:10,040
Hold on.

4413
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:10,600
I think so.

4414
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:11,220
Oop.

4415
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:13,400
This is a trap.

4416
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,280
Slip, slip, slip, slip, slip.

4417
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:15,820
Oh!

4418
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:16,880
I got boiling.

4419
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,820
Look, are you hungry?

4420
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,620
Whoa!

4421
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:19,620
A whole bento!

4422
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:19,800
Whoa!

4423
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,280
That looks tasty.

4424
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:23,860
It's actually airline food, but...

4425
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:24,220
Whoa!

4426
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:25,500
Oh my god.

4427
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,840
Wait, what if I go in the water?

4428
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:29,880
Oh wait, the fog is here already.

4429
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:30,500
That's beans.

4430
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:31,380
Okay, we're going.

4431
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:33,240
That's beans.

4432
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:36,100
Oh, I touched the thing.

4433
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:38,020
Yeah, I certainly touched it a little bit.

4434
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:44,330
Oh, oh, oh, it just took a minute.

4435
02:10:44,490 --> 02:10:45,390
You have to water it.

4436
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:46,310
Ew, it's a grower.

4437
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:47,390
Dude, it's so big.

4438
02:10:47,530 --> 02:10:48,050
Holy shit.

4439
02:10:48,210 --> 02:10:48,330
Whoa!

4440
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:49,490
Whoa!

4441
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:49,830
Whoa!

4442
02:10:50,670 --> 02:10:53,370
I think, I think this might have been a slight waste of it.

4443
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:54,710
Wait, is this gonna...

4444
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,930
Why did you waste it?

4445
02:10:57,490 --> 02:10:57,890
I...

4446
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:58,450
Why did you waste this, Slip?

4447
02:10:58,450 --> 02:11:00,890
I should have been more thoughtful about my uses.

4448
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:01,370
Yeah.

4449
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:02,210
I wanna get to the tip.

4450
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,490
I hope you learned your lesson.

4451
02:11:05,410 --> 02:11:05,810
Careful!

4452
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:07,610
If you go to the tip, you might slow!

4453
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:11,110
I didn't even do anything!

4454
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:12,130
Woo!

4455
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,110
What's your footing?

4456
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:16,150
Oh, there's apples.

4457
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:16,930
Is anybody hungry?

4458
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:19,130
A little bit.

4459
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:19,910
A little bit.

4460
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:20,590
But I have tronics.

4461
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:23,910
I felt like I was in the line.

4462
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:25,090
We need to, we need to hang left.

4463
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,730
We're on the edge of the map again somehow.

4464
02:11:27,610 --> 02:11:27,850
Yeah!

4465
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:29,490
We just wanna get it.

4466
02:11:29,850 --> 02:11:30,150
Apparently.

4467
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:33,190
Uh oh.

4468
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:33,830
I'll wait.

4469
02:11:35,150 --> 02:11:35,730
I'll wait.

4470
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,310
I'll wait.

4471
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:36,490
I'll wait.

4472
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:38,510
Look at the tip.

4473
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:40,390
Uh...

4474
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:41,190
Lion King.

4475
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:42,990
I don't know yet.

4476
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:44,750
I have a mission.

4477
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:45,150
I have a mission.

4478
02:11:45,150 --> 02:11:46,410
Yeah, I got to take this to the...

4479
02:11:49,530 --> 02:11:50,330
I'm waiting.

4480
02:11:50,710 --> 02:11:51,030
I'm waiting.

4481
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:53,850
It's taking a long time.

4482
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:54,770
Come on, go away.

4483
02:11:58,230 --> 02:12:00,450
Come on, go away.

4484
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:01,030
Beep!

4485
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,120
Oh my gosh!

4486
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:09,920
Okay, you know what?

4487
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:10,580
I'm not waiting.

4488
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:11,280
I don't know.

4489
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,120
I don't know.

4490
02:12:13,380 --> 02:12:14,040
Oh, thank you.

4491
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:16,480
Damn, why are you waiting for me?

4492
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:17,840
Yeah!

4493
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:18,600
Hmm.

4494
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:23,660
Which way did they go?

4495
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:27,300
Oh, up here.

4496
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,540
Yeah, I think they went this way.

4497
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:29,100
That's the right way.

4498
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:30,140
Scout Master!

4499
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:32,320
Scout Master!

4500
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:34,140
Scout Master!

4501
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:35,430
Scout Master!

4502
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:38,440
Ouch!

4503
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,200
Oh, thanks.

4504
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,600
It's very useful.

4505
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:44,280
How's it going?

4506
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:45,500
You're welcome, Scout Master.

4507
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:50,800
I don't detect a whole lot of sincerity in your voice.

4508
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:52,360
You're welcome.

4509
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,220
Does this ever disappear?

4510
02:12:57,540 --> 02:12:58,280
I don't know.

4511
02:12:58,900 --> 02:12:59,460
Oh, no.

4512
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:00,460
We're not going this way?

4513
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:02,400
I don't know.

4514
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:03,880
I don't know which way I should go.

4515
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:04,340
We have several...

4516
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:05,480
Doki has several ropes.

4517
02:13:05,620 --> 02:13:06,540
I'm just gonna say that.

4518
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,020
Out loud.

4519
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:08,340
Um...

4520
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:09,100
Yeah, I do.

4521
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:09,860
Don't shame her.

4522
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:11,060
Don't shame her.

4523
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:12,220
I'm not shaming.

4524
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,500
I'm just saying that.

4525
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:14,740
Yeah, you tattle killer.

4526
02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:23,420
I'm just saying that if we need to use things to get further, that someone is hoarding the supplies.

4527
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:27,180
I am not hoarding anyone else can open my backpack.

4528
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:28,840
It's not just a neat thing.

4529
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:29,540
I'm gonna kill you.

4530
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:31,680
I'm gonna push her off.

4531
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,160
I'm gonna murder you.

4532
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:34,480
I'm gonna murder you.

4533
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:35,740
I'm gonna murder you.

4534
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,900
I'm gonna kill you.

4535
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:40,120
I'm gonna kill you.

4536
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:42,740
We're in the other map again.

4537
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,420
I don't know if we can go anywhere else.

4538
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:47,520
Let's just go to the left side, right side.

4539
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:49,780
Left side, right side.

4540
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:55,660
But we kind of stranded ourselves by going down.

4541
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:57,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

4542
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:58,540
What the hell?

4543
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:00,760
If we can get over here, that is such an easy way up.

4544
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:02,020
How did you get so tall?

4545
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:09,680
What happened?

4546
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:14,220
Did you see what happened?

4547
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:15,580
She like ricocheted.

4548
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:18,780
I think Doki just killed her.

4549
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:20,140
Oh wait, Limo, are you okay?

4550
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:20,840
You're alive!

4551
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:23,700
She's alive, she's alive, she's alive!

4552
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,960
Oh my god, how does she live?

4553
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:32,320
Yeah, that's something a killer would ask.

4554
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:36,200
Doki, how did she live because you pushed her off and you were intending...

4555
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:37,620
With intent to kill!

4556
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:41,180
How does she have no stamina for that?

4557
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:43,980
Send the rope!

4558
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:51,150
Wait, we can use the rope down here and then go to where the ammo is.

4559
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:54,650
Or you could be gamers and catch the vine.

4560
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:56,010
What could possibly go wrong?

4561
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:56,810
Oh, okay.

4562
02:14:56,810 --> 02:14:56,910
Okay.

4563
02:14:57,650 --> 02:14:58,570
Okay, let's do it.

4564
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:01,530
No, use the rope if you're scared, use the rope if you're scared.

4565
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:04,210
Nope.

4566
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:10,060
Alive!

4567
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:10,940
Oh, no, I'm not.

4568
02:15:16,990 --> 02:15:17,390
Um...

4569
02:15:17,390 --> 02:15:19,990
It did start raining, did she just like, slip and die?

4570
02:15:20,850 --> 02:15:21,790
I don't know.

4571
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:25,110
Can we check on her?

4572
02:15:25,490 --> 02:15:26,230
Can we stay through?

4573
02:15:26,850 --> 02:15:28,990
Oh, maybe she didn't know she had to press E.

4574
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:30,230
Oh, it was E?

4575
02:15:30,450 --> 02:15:31,250
I thought it was E.

4576
02:15:58,470 --> 02:15:59,450
I think so.

4577
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:00,110
Okay.

4578
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:01,790
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4579
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:03,430
Before I do this, Snuffy, go back up.

4580
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:04,350
Snuffy, before we do this.

4581
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:05,210
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4582
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:07,950
I'm gonna put the backpack down and then...

4583
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:08,490
I need to get out.

4584
02:16:08,730 --> 02:16:09,250
Oh, no!

4585
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:13,130
I can't see Min's body.

4586
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:13,810
Hi, Min!

4587
02:16:14,150 --> 02:16:14,430
Hi!

4588
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:16,270
Hello!

4589
02:16:17,570 --> 02:16:21,850
I turned my camera just in time to see you going by so fucking fast!

4590
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:24,950
I didn't know it was, uh...

4591
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:26,010
Uh, left...

4592
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:27,090
Uh, E to...

4593
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:28,430
To grab, I thought it was...

4594
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:28,950
Yeah, I'm sorry.

4595
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:30,090
I should've said something.

4596
02:16:30,270 --> 02:16:31,090
I didn't think about it.

4597
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:31,970
You gotta press E.

4598
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:32,910
Yeah.

4599
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:34,810
Aw, rip the bugle.

4600
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:35,610
That was funny, though.

4601
02:16:36,050 --> 02:16:36,950
What happened to me?

4602
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:37,230
Are you okay?

4603
02:16:38,130 --> 02:16:38,610
You're...

4604
02:16:38,610 --> 02:16:39,310
You're looking...

4605
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:40,290
You look like you...

4606
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:41,770
Kevin Butters will be so disappointed.

4607
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:43,050
I know, it's okay.

4608
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:48,520
Do something!

4609
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:49,220
What are you doing?

4610
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:49,620
Do something!

4611
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:50,700
I'm...

4612
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:52,300
Oh my god, now I can.

4613
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:52,680
Okay.

4614
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:55,360
Okay.

4615
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:56,560
Okay.

4616
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:56,860
Okay.

4617
02:16:56,860 --> 02:16:57,860
I'm gonna jump down.

4618
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:58,420
It's left click.

4619
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:59,900
It's left click to grab it.

4620
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:01,420
I know, Andy!

4621
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:02,420
Fuck it!

4622
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:03,640
Please!

4623
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:09,760
I'm okay.

4624
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:15,090
I'm okay.

4625
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:16,190
I'm okay.

4626
02:17:16,470 --> 02:17:17,330
I'm okay.

4627
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:18,650
How is she...

4628
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:20,710
I'm okay, I'm okay.

4629
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:20,730
I'm okay.

4630
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,610
I'm okay.

4631
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:22,390
I'm okay.

4632
02:17:22,530 --> 02:17:22,810
I'm okay.

4633
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:26,310
I'm okay.

4634
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:27,630
Grab the bugle.

4635
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:28,870
Grab it from my body.

4636
02:17:29,410 --> 02:17:29,790
Me, me!

4637
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:30,130
I'm not!

4638
02:17:30,470 --> 02:17:32,690
I'm gonna grab your stupid bugle!

4639
02:17:32,970 --> 02:17:33,230
Please!

4640
02:17:33,230 --> 02:17:33,710
I'm alive.

4641
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:35,110
I'm alive.

4642
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:35,750
Please!

4643
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:37,290
I'm alive.

4644
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:38,570
I know if I can back up.

4645
02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:42,870
You're going to get fogged first.

4646
02:17:43,390 --> 02:17:44,970
Don't say that!

4647
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:45,990
You're going to get fogged.

4648
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:46,570
Stop!

4649
02:17:46,770 --> 02:17:48,210
Get fogged, Doki bird!

4650
02:17:48,210 --> 02:17:49,370
I wasn't!

4651
02:17:50,050 --> 02:17:51,650
Get fogged.

4652
02:17:51,990 --> 02:17:53,150
Get stick bugged.

4653
02:17:54,470 --> 02:17:56,050
That's just a fart.

4654
02:17:56,530 --> 02:17:56,810
What the hell?

4655
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:13,470
This is all your fault.

4656
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:15,650
This is all your fault.

4657
02:18:15,770 --> 02:18:17,110
This is your fault!

4658
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:18,550
I thought you were alive!

4659
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:24,190
Did you tell her the wrong button, Min?

4660
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:24,670
No!

4661
02:18:25,810 --> 02:18:27,110
Are you sure?

4662
02:18:27,490 --> 02:18:29,150
She did that all on her own.

4663
02:18:30,190 --> 02:18:33,730
This is all your fault, Min!

4664
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:37,110
You messed with my groove!

4665
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:39,030
You messed with my groove!

4666
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:42,430
Excuse me, Min, you've thrown off Doki Bird's groove.

4667
02:18:42,770 --> 02:18:44,110
I'm not sorry!

4668
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:51,410
I'm crying.

4669
02:18:52,350 --> 02:18:53,390
Oh, okay.

4670
02:18:54,890 --> 02:18:57,530
My POV was so good!

4671
02:18:57,770 --> 02:18:58,830
You did this.

4672
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:01,590
From mine, I just saw Doki fucking bounce.

4673
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:03,090
It was so good.

4674
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:04,770
You cursed me.

4675
02:19:04,970 --> 02:19:06,410
You cursed me.

4676
02:19:08,510 --> 02:19:09,290
Just kidding.

4677
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:10,150
Just kidding.

4678
02:19:10,370 --> 02:19:12,130
Snuffy has the rest of the backpack.

4679
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:13,510
Okay, good.

4680
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:14,710
Is Snuffy alive?

4681
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:17,090
Hi, Snuffy.

4682
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:17,590
Hi, Snuffy.

4683
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:21,510
Oh, I was like, I don't know where everybody went.

4684
02:19:21,710 --> 02:19:22,690
I don't know what happened.

4685
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:24,970
I don't know how she...

4686
02:19:24,970 --> 02:19:26,050
Wait, you died!

4687
02:19:26,210 --> 02:19:27,110
Wait, did you live?

4688
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:27,850
How did you die?

4689
02:19:28,170 --> 02:19:28,890
What happened?

4690
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:30,710
Someone, someone...

4691
02:19:31,410 --> 02:19:34,310
Oh, oh, I was not doing anything.

4692
02:19:35,130 --> 02:19:37,190
Someone cursed me to all eternity.

4693
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:37,830
Someone cursed me to all eternity.

4694
02:19:40,410 --> 02:19:42,690
Oh, that's kind of nice, though.

4695
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:43,750
That's so romantic.

4696
02:19:44,790 --> 02:19:46,870
You guys can haunt me together.

4697
02:19:47,330 --> 02:19:47,410
I'm dead!

4698
02:19:47,410 --> 02:19:48,270
What do you mean?

4699
02:19:48,550 --> 02:19:49,410
I'm dead!

4700
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:56,510
To be fair, as soon as I saw you hit the ground, I kinda marked you as deceased.

4701
02:19:57,330 --> 02:20:01,050
It was, like, a pretty bad, like, brain trauma.

4702
02:20:01,270 --> 02:20:01,370
It was, like, a pretty bad, like, brain trauma.

4703
02:20:01,470 --> 02:20:02,010
It was a pretty bad trauma.

4704
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:03,570
Yeah, it was really bad.

4705
02:20:03,570 --> 02:20:04,670
You had internal bleeding.

4706
02:20:04,830 --> 02:20:07,590
There was, like, adrenaline shock from the hit.

4707
02:20:07,810 --> 02:20:09,350
So, like, I didn't die right away.

4708
02:20:09,530 --> 02:20:12,170
Like, Trezna was taking me over to the edge.

4709
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:13,370
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

4710
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:14,150
I'll be right back.

4711
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:16,190
Alright, I'm gonna check on that.

4712
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:18,010
Okay, I'm waiting.

4713
02:20:18,970 --> 02:20:20,390
No, no, I have to...

4714
02:20:20,850 --> 02:20:24,410
No, no, if you go too far, the Scout Master spawns, I'd knock you off the mountain.

4715
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:26,350
It's too much to him for him to graduate.

4716
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:27,250
Wait, really?

4717
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:28,190
Yeah.

4718
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:31,490
Did he fucking spawns and kiss you?

4719
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:35,650
Yeah, he chases you down and, like, takes you off the mountain.

4720
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:37,750
He's like, wow, you're not working as a team?

4721
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:38,530
Go fuck yourself.

4722
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:41,570
Wow, okay, so all we need is Snuffy to die, then.

4723
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:42,750
What?!

4724
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:44,590
Or, you know, get to me, one or the other.

4725
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:47,870
Cause that one's just as likely to help.

4726
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:48,650
Did you hear that?

4727
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:50,250
Snuffy was like, what?!

4728
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:51,490
Somebody!

4729
02:20:51,570 --> 02:20:52,710
I don't hear her now.

4730
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:53,330
Please!

4731
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:56,450
Insult after insult, I was somebody!

4732
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:57,750
There's only four minutes!

4733
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:01,580
It's okay, it's okay, you'll be fine.

4734
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:02,480
Did you hear something?

4735
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:03,860
Somebody just said something to me.

4736
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:04,640
I know, what was that?

4737
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,840
They have the voice of a ghost, so I don't know.

4738
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:07,440
You said what, Mint?

4739
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:08,780
Aw, it must have been Mint.

4740
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:10,660
What did she say?

4741
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,600
Are you able to get up, Snuffy?

4742
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:15,040
Um...

4743
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,140
She doesn't know what to do.

4744
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:17,600
I don't know what to do.

4745
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:18,080
I can like...

4746
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:18,740
Can you get to here?

4747
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:19,980
Oh, shoot!

4748
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:21,960
You're literally right there, next to her!

4749
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:25,320
I got you, I got you.

4750
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:26,160
This way!

4751
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:26,700
This way!

4752
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:29,120
Hey!

4753
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:30,920
Big girl!

4754
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:31,940
What's up?

4755
02:21:33,460 --> 02:21:34,220
Wait, what is this?

4756
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:34,820
Like, wind?

4757
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:36,120
Do you see wind or something?

4758
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:37,300
Yeah, I don't know what that's about.

4759
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:38,660
I think it's a broken waterfall.

4760
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,460
Yeah.

4761
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,020
It's like a sideways water.

4762
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:41,800
At least it's no kick thing.

4763
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:42,940
Yeah.

4764
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:46,180
This, honestly, this map generation seems kind of funky.

4765
02:21:46,300 --> 02:21:46,900
Oh yeah, here it is.

4766
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,000
What's your fault?

4767
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:54,260
I do think getting robbed out of our, like, big luggage at the top is kind of cool for the army.

4768
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:56,860
So do we want to go this way?

4769
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:58,200
Or around this way?

4770
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:59,720
This way seems kind of clean and nice.

4771
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:01,180
Yeah.

4772
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:07,560
That's my main bar, if he's sickering from black screen to me, that's not good, right?

4773
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,280
That's...

4774
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:09,740
No, that's usually...

4775
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:11,160
It's evolving!

4776
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:12,080
Congratulations!

4777
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:13,180
Your graphics card.

4778
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:14,080
It's trying to talk to you.

4779
02:22:14,100 --> 02:22:15,000
I don't think that's it.

4780
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,100
I don't think that's it.

4781
02:22:16,360 --> 02:22:17,120
Hold on, let me...

4782
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:18,400
Let's check this way around.

4783
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,120
This whole place stopped...

4784
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:22,680
I might need to take a PC to the doctor's tomorrow.

4785
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:25,300
A wellness check.

4786
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:30,560
I haven't installed my new CPU yet, because I didn't have time to go to the...

4787
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:31,800
The...

4788
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:32,640
The PC people.

4789
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:33,400
Another cookie.

4790
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:35,600
Okay.

4791
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,220
Where did she go?

4792
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:39,580
She went to the other side.

4793
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:40,300
Please come back...

4794
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:40,780
Go back down.

4795
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:42,740
Going down?

4796
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:43,920
Yeah.

4797
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:44,440
She went...

4798
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:45,200
The left side.

4799
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:46,100
Where you came from.

4800
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:46,940
She went the other way.

4801
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:47,940
Oh.

4802
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:48,800
I'm coming.

4803
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:49,280
I'm coming.

4804
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,940
Which way did you go?

4805
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:52,720
You're on the vine.

4806
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:57,440
I don't know in regards to you.

4807
02:22:57,700 --> 02:22:58,500
Oh, there you are.

4808
02:22:58,500 --> 02:22:59,400
Snuffy's on a mission.

4809
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:02,160
I don't remember how we get up top.

4810
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:04,420
I don't remember the way either now.

4811
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,840
There's a good mushroom over here, but I don't think...

4812
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:08,520
Maybe this way?

4813
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:10,200
Wait, we can climb from there, right?

4814
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:14,340
How did that work?

4815
02:23:15,380 --> 02:23:16,380
Come back, sorry.

4816
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:18,100
I was getting more tea too.

4817
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:18,400
Welcome back.

4818
02:23:18,860 --> 02:23:19,500
Are you good?

4819
02:23:19,860 --> 02:23:20,160
Yeah.

4820
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:23,860
What kind of tea did you get?

4821
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:24,600
Yeah, what kind of tea?

4822
02:23:24,620 --> 02:23:25,760
Snuffy, could you give me a hand up?

4823
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,780
Thanks again, Mai-cha.

4824
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,780
Um, yes, yes.

4825
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:30,320
Thank you.

4826
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:32,840
Look at you guys.

4827
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:34,260
You're almost there.

4828
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:34,920
Are you?

4829
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:35,520
Wow.

4830
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:36,980
I think so.

4831
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:38,080
We're making progress.

4832
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:40,680
Go through the water.

4833
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,580
You just jump out into the abyss?

4834
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:45,040
Yeah.

4835
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:49,360
Watch your stuff.

4836
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:50,300
Don't let it fall.

4837
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:57,900
I like how every time someone in this game dies, they immediately become like, I don't know, the Call of the Void or some shit.

4838
02:23:58,160 --> 02:23:59,380
Call of the Void?

4839
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:00,980
A carrot!

4840
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:02,640
Do you need medicine?

4841
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:05,520
No.

4842
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:06,200
Oh, thank you.

4843
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:07,140
You are such a feeder.

4844
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:08,440
No!

4845
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:08,800
No!

4846
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,740
Don't say it like that!

4847
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:13,740
I'm just concerned.

4848
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:14,900
Thank you very much.

4849
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:15,560
Wow.

4850
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:16,560
Sharing is caring.

4851
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:17,240
Wow.

4852
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,720
I didn't know you were into that.

4853
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:19,320
No!

4854
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:19,740
No!

4855
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:20,500
No!

4856
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:21,240
No!

4857
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:21,900
No!

4858
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:22,320
No!

4859
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:22,900
No!

4860
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:24,760
She carried the thick mint.

4861
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:27,880
Oh, extra thick.

4862
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:31,800
Thank you.

4863
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:32,300
I got you.

4864
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,040
Oh, this is so straightforward.

4865
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:35,980
This is good.

4866
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:36,920
Yeah, this is nice.

4867
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:37,920
Good job.

4868
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:41,180
And all it took was two of our friends fucking dying to get over here.

4869
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:42,960
I was a worthy sacrifice.

4870
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:45,160
I wasn't.

4871
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,040
Yeah, you were useless.

4872
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:49,640
My death could have been avoided.

4873
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:49,940
No!

4874
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:51,920
My death could have been avoided!

4875
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:53,900
What are you talking about?

4876
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,820
You literally caused it yourself.

4877
02:24:57,220 --> 02:24:58,980
There's luggage to your left side.

4878
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:00,060
Left?

4879
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:02,260
Just trying to find a good path.

4880
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,760
Do you think we make this vine climb?

4881
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:07,760
I think so.

4882
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:08,680
Vines take...

4883
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:10,120
Vines take way less stamina.

4884
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:11,900
Do you have good stamina?

4885
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:12,480
Do it!

4886
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:13,120
Do it!

4887
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:14,460
Do it!

4888
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:15,780
You'll make it.

4889
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:16,820
You'll make it.

4890
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:17,820
I think...

4891
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,620
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4892
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:19,080
Actually...

4893
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:21,420
The fog cometh.

4894
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:23,240
The fog...

4895
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:23,360
The fog...

4896
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:23,620
Oh, god.

4897
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,020
I think I'm gonna make it.

4898
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:27,300
The fog cometh and the fog it taketh.

4899
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,180
It does never give us.

4900
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:29,860
You're making it.

4901
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:30,940
You're making it.

4902
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:31,780
You're making it!

4903
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:32,480
And we'll go from here.

4904
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:33,400
Oh.

4905
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:33,980
Oh, god.

4906
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:34,880
And it started raining.

4907
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:36,200
Jump to the...

4908
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:36,960
It's below you here.

4909
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:37,580
Jump here.

4910
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:39,820
Come on.

4911
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:40,720
Do the jump, Snuffy.

4912
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:42,240
Jump so far.

4913
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:42,460
Hold on.

4914
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,940
I'm gonna wait for it to stop raining.

4915
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,920
Do it, Snuffy.

4916
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:48,320
Do it, Snuffy.

4917
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:48,840
Do it, Snuffy.

4918
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,860
Do it, Snuffy.

4919
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,200
Do it, Snuffy.

4920
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:50,960
The fog is coming.

4921
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,620
Well, I might join you guys...

4922
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,020
Just a moment...

4923
02:25:56,340 --> 02:26:00,880
It kind of looks like an easy jump, but I'm afraid I'm gonna be more like an anvil.

4924
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:01,900
Alright, here we go.

4925
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:06,700
The one, the two, the call of the void, the call of the void.

4926
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:11,640
Okay, I broke my chins a little bit.

4927
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:15,740
Snuffy, bring your own down, bring your own down, bring your own down!

4928
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:19,280
Oh my god, thank you.

4929
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:23,760
I thought you were gone, I literally, I think I was in shock for a second.

4930
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:26,000
No, it's still here, it's still here, it's still here!

4931
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:28,380
Okay, the fog, the fog, we gotta go!

4932
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:30,940
Don't leave, we're not gonna make it!

4933
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,520
It's gradual damage.

4934
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:37,840
Oh, I can't see because of the fog, this sucks!

4935
02:26:38,060 --> 02:26:38,740
You're almost there!

4936
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:39,820
Follow me, follow me!

4937
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:40,960
I think we're under a tree!

4938
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:43,860
No, Snuffy, follow, follow Ivo!

4939
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:45,240
Come, come up this way, come up this way!

4940
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:46,220
Yeah, yeah, follow Ivo!

4941
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:48,640
Oh my god, Snuffy's eating!

4942
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:50,560
To the left, to the left!

4943
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:52,920
Snuffy, to the left, to the left!

4944
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:55,520
Everything you owed in a box to the left!

4945
02:26:56,060 --> 02:26:56,760
The tree?

4946
02:26:57,380 --> 02:27:00,140
Maybe, I don't have any stamina left.

4947
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:01,060
It's the wrong way!

4948
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:02,300
This way, this way, this way!

4949
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:03,060
It's the wrong way!

4950
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:03,740
Uh-oh!

4951
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:05,560
Oh my god, she's bad!

4952
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:06,280
I did it!

4953
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:10,440
Oh, oh, this is so...

4954
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:10,920
Oh, Snuffy!

4955
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:12,100
Snuffy!

4956
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:12,620
Snuffy!

4957
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:13,200
Snuffy!

4958
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:15,620
Oh, Snuffy!

4959
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:16,860
Oh, Snuffy!

4960
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:17,840
Oh, Snuffy!

4961
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,440
Yes, go, go, die, slipper!

4962
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:30,460
Yes, throw Grunkle off, throw Grunkle off before you die!

4963
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:33,460
Yeah, throw him off, throw Grunkle off!

4964
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,780
Oh, that's it, that's it.

4965
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:37,500
Oh, he's slipping, he's slipping.

4966
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,660
He's slipping?

4967
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:42,000
He's slipping?

4968
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:42,480
No, he's not.

4969
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:44,160
I think we went the right way.

4970
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:44,800
It sucks here.

4971
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:48,060
I think, I think maybe we, we made a wrong turning somewhere.

4972
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:48,980
Uh-oh, wait.

4973
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:52,160
There's still a far ways away too.

4974
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,000
Oh gosh.

4975
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:54,460
Yeah.

4976
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:56,420
The fog is so fast!

4977
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:00,240
The right way was, I think we were just really slow.

4978
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:04,020
Yeah, we kind of like, meandered around a little bit.

4979
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:07,400
I think the right way was the, the right way.

4980
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:07,980
Ha-ha.

4981
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:12,180
No, no, you can make it.

4982
02:28:13,380 --> 02:28:14,860
I think you guys should have grabbed the vine.

4983
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:19,920
I grabbed it, I grabbed it.

4984
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,100
It was, no, I think this is a tree.

4985
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,700
Oh, no, no, no, different tree, different tree.

4986
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:24,820
Never mind.

4987
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:25,440
It has bees!

4988
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,280
There's the bees!

4989
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:29,140
It is a bee tree, but I think it's a different bee tree.

4990
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:30,100
The environment looks different.

4991
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,280
Yeah, it does, you're right.

4992
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:32,040
Oh, wait, no!

4993
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:36,240
Isn't that the, the same, that's the same, uh...

4994
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:36,720
That's crazy.

4995
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:38,960
Oh, it's waning.

4996
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,220
Did you just say it's waning?

4997
02:28:41,220 --> 02:28:42,360
Isn't that the same suitcase from before?

4998
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,800
Did you just say it's waning?

4999
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:45,720
It's waning.

5000
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:46,840
It's waning.

5001
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:47,600
It's waning.

5002
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:47,940
It's waning.

5003
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:48,960
It's waning.

5004
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,120
The old man is snoring.

5005
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:53,660
He hit his head.

5006
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:58,900
He went to bed and bumped his head and couldn't get up in the morning.

5007
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,600
That's the story of Doki Bird.

5008
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,540
Do we need to do a wellness check?

5009
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:09,140
Uh, so I don't have the same drink I had last time to make this.

5010
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,340
This is exactly the same clip and I don't have the drink.

5011
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:12,620
Uh oh.

5012
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,520
Wait, you have the drink in your backpack?

5013
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:18,260
No, someone swiped it.

5014
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:20,860
Who would have done such a thing?

5015
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:21,880
I don't know.

5016
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:23,500
Don't talk to her.

5017
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:25,740
Like at all?

5018
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:27,540
Like at all?

5019
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,040
It was you.

5020
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,400
I don't.

5021
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:31,380
You swiped it.

5022
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:32,680
I didn't actually.

5023
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:35,940
I had a water bottle but it was in my backpack.

5024
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:37,240
Uh oh gosh.

5025
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:38,840
Oh gosh.

5026
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:40,820
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa.

5027
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:41,860
Careful, careful.

5028
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:43,420
Hm.

5029
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:44,680
Whoa whoa whoa.

5030
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:48,160
Alright, since we are all confessing right now.

5031
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:52,060
I may not have been the one that swiped the energy drink.

5032
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:53,740
Oh my god.

5033
02:29:53,740 --> 02:29:54,080
Oh my god.

5034
02:29:54,260 --> 02:29:56,200
The worst kept secret ever.

5035
02:29:57,420 --> 02:29:59,500
I mean, I kinda watched you do it.

5036
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:05,960
She was giving you the time to confess and you just...

5037
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:06,340
It was me.

5038
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:07,320
And I did.

5039
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:08,100
And I did.

5040
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:09,940
And all is forgiven in the eyes of god.

5041
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:11,180
Oh, okay.

5042
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:13,340
You're a ghost.

5043
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:14,000
You're a ghost.

5044
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:14,960
There is no...

5045
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:17,360
There is no forgiveness.

5046
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:18,900
I just have some unfinished business.

5047
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:21,020
Oh.

5048
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:22,400
Oh, that's a lot of spikes.

5049
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:26,600
Oh, fucking rain, fucking rain, fucking rain, fucking rain.

5050
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:31,800
Um.

5051
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:35,360
If I have my drink, this would be so much easier.

5052
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:39,120
Your character looks so angry as you said.

5053
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:40,800
It's just unfortunate.

5054
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:41,980
I would...

5055
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:43,500
Oh my gosh, you're so close.

5056
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:44,540
Oh, this is fucked.

5057
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:45,620
There's like nothing here.

5058
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:46,160
Oh god.

5059
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:47,080
Yeah, there's a rock.

5060
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:49,300
To the left, there's a little green patch.

5061
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,600
Yeah, I see it.

5062
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:50,680
Yeah.

5063
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:51,340
I see it.

5064
02:30:51,700 --> 02:30:52,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5065
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:53,760
And then you can grab that.

5066
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:55,700
And then all is forgiven.

5067
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:03,140
Oh, that was so close.

5068
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:06,300
All right.

5069
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:07,740
And then you can grab that.

5070
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:09,620
I don't want to worry you, but the fog cometh.

5071
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,180
Okay.

5072
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:14,260
The fog cometh, and the fog can take it.

5073
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:15,700
The fog will take it.

5074
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:17,980
You made it.

5075
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:18,260
Woo!

5076
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:19,000
Yeah!

5077
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:19,140
Yeah!

5078
02:31:20,980 --> 02:31:22,640
We did it again!

5079
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:23,960
Oh my god!

5080
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:27,680
See, this is why I feed Limo and she carried us.

5081
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:28,580
Yeah!

5082
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:29,320
Yay!

5083
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:31,400
Oh my god!

5084
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,860
Oh my god!

5085
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:33,760
Oh my god!

5086
02:31:37,730 --> 02:31:38,910
We're heroes!

5087
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:42,230
Yay!

5088
02:31:44,090 --> 02:31:45,210
Oh my god!

5089
02:31:45,210 --> 02:31:45,950
Fuck god!

5090
02:31:47,470 --> 02:31:49,170
Do you still have that open?

5091
02:31:49,310 --> 02:31:51,470
Yeah, that suitcase is still up there.

5092
02:31:52,530 --> 02:31:54,470
Yeah, the suitcase... how do you get that?

5093
02:31:55,570 --> 02:31:56,390
I don't know.

5094
02:31:56,590 --> 02:31:57,810
You can't climb this, too.

5095
02:31:58,690 --> 02:32:02,070
I think it was just generated, like, fucking fucked up.

5096
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:03,050
Yeah.

5097
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:05,690
Moral boost!

5098
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:09,010
I'm cooking.

5099
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:12,250
Wait a minute.

5100
02:32:12,250 --> 02:32:15,250
So are you guys gonna see the capybaras this time?

5101
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:15,810
I'm eating.

5102
02:32:16,130 --> 02:32:18,010
Oh yeah, I wanna see capybara!

5103
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:18,510
Yeah.

5104
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:20,490
Gotta go fast!

5105
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:23,730
Unfortunately, I have just died, so we don't have Gungle.

5106
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:24,670
Or the trumpet.

5107
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:27,850
No...

5108
02:32:27,850 --> 02:32:29,550
Oh, can I cook the herbs?

5109
02:32:30,470 --> 02:32:30,990
Herbs?

5110
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:36,040
I wonder where one of them went.

5111
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:39,000
Hmm...

5112
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:39,660
Cute!

5113
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:43,680
I wonder what happened to the other marshmallow, too.

5114
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:45,460
Hmm...

5115
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:46,340
C'mon, Stan.

5116
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:47,600
It's fun.

5117
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:49,660
Nah.

5118
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:50,800
Funny.

5119
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:52,680
I'm climbing.

5120
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:55,240
The freezing airs.

5121
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:57,420
You know what?

5122
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,620
By the time I get my...

5123
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:00,040
I got Invisalign in...

5124
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:03,400
By the time I get those out, it's gonna feel weird to have my teeth actually be able to touch each other.

5125
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:06,060
Like, I'm just gonna be uncomfortable and like...

5126
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:06,900
For age or whatever.

5127
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:09,780
What's Invisalign?

5128
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,060
It's like braces, but better.

5129
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:13,180
They're like...

5130
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:14,320
A retainer, like...

5131
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:15,180
Slightly less obvious.

5132
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:16,520
Huh?

5133
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:17,740
It's kinda like...

5134
02:33:17,740 --> 02:33:19,240
Like it covers your whole mouth, right?

5135
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:20,400
Oh...

5136
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:20,940
It's...

5137
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:21,280
It's like...

5138
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:22,500
It's like a little...

5139
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:24,200
Plastic tray that your teeth...

5140
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:24,800
Like...

5141
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:25,920
Uh...

5142
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:26,860
Sits around your teeth.

5143
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:28,380
It's molded to the shape of your teeth.

5144
02:33:29,860 --> 02:33:30,240
Ah...

5145
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:30,880
Is it still cold?

5146
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,660
How much to buy your yeast Invisalign?

5147
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:32,900
Yeah, it's still cold.

5148
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:35,060
Oh...

5149
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:35,800
It's cold, it's cold.

5150
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:37,080
It's a lot more expensive than regular braces.

5151
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:38,200
From what I've heard.

5152
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:40,240
It...

5153
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:40,980
Depends.

5154
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:44,000
Like, clear braces.

5155
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:44,720
Yeah...

5156
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:45,300
There's another...

5157
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:46,180
Oh, there's that...

5158
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:47,160
I remember that suitcase.

5159
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,260
Depending on the...

5160
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:48,400
Yeah.

5161
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:53,020
I don't think it's even more subtle than normal braces if they put enough attachments in, which I have.

5162
02:33:53,480 --> 02:33:53,680
Uh...

5163
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:54,480
What do you mean attachments?

5164
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:55,340
You get like...

5165
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:56,860
Sparkles and like...

5166
02:33:56,860 --> 02:33:57,660
No, it's like...

5167
02:33:57,660 --> 02:34:03,000
It's like little clear bumps that they attach to your teeth to help the Invisalign anchor to your teeth.

5168
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:04,680
Ooh...

5169
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:05,260
What'd you say?

5170
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:06,180
That sounds so strange.

5171
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:07,460
Can you put like jing on it?

5172
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:08,780
Oh yeah!

5173
02:34:09,100 --> 02:34:10,300
I don't know, actually.

5174
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:11,020
Oh yeah!

5175
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:11,040
Uh oh!

5176
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:11,600
Uh oh!

5177
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,900
Uh oh!

5178
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:14,540
Oh gosh!

5179
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:14,860
Wait!

5180
02:34:14,860 --> 02:34:15,240
Oh!

5181
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:15,700
Oh!

5182
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:17,480
I made it.

5183
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,460
This is okay here.

5184
02:34:19,980 --> 02:34:21,900
Wait, can we go inside the earth?

5185
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:27,940
It's kind of horrific when you fly off the cave and then it throws you into these like open...

5186
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:28,400
Yeah.

5187
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:30,740
Endless caverns.

5188
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:31,920
Yeah, I wanna ca...

5189
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:32,700
I wanna go...

5190
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:33,300
I wanna...

5191
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:34,540
It's hard time...

5192
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:36,360
Float off a mountain into a cavern!

5193
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,900
Yeah, it's our chance to go cave diving for real!

5194
02:34:40,440 --> 02:34:41,440
We can really...

5195
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:43,500
We can go cave diving and see it through to the end.

5196
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:45,300
Oh my god, we can finally...

5197
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:46,080
We can cave dive.

5198
02:34:46,500 --> 02:34:47,840
That's what I've always wanted.

5199
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:49,240
Executing cave diving.

5200
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,700
Mint, did you not cook your marshmallow?

5201
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:53,180
It was you.

5202
02:34:53,460 --> 02:34:54,560
She likes it raw.

5203
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:56,760
Oh sorry.

5204
02:34:56,900 --> 02:34:58,820
Mint, you totally didn't steal that marshmallow.

5205
02:34:58,820 --> 02:34:59,160
No.

5206
02:34:59,160 --> 02:34:59,880
It was...

5207
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:00,620
It was you.

5208
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:03,240
Of course.

5209
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:04,320
Who else wanted it have been?

5210
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:06,280
Who else wanted it have been?!

5211
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:07,260
You bastard!

5212
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:12,340
I remembered already.

5213
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:15,580
Why do you think it was gone?

5214
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:18,380
Come close.

5215
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:19,960
It's just us, too.

5216
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:21,700
I'll push you into the storm.

5217
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:23,080
I'll push you into the storm.

5218
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:24,320
Nobody will see.

5219
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:25,060
Nobody will see.

5220
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:26,080
Nobody will hear you 죄.

5221
02:35:26,420 --> 02:35:27,940
Nobody will hear you scream!

5222
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:32,700
It's like, if a tree falls down an empty forest.

5223
02:35:41,290 --> 02:35:43,890
Maya, there has to be more food somewhere.

5224
02:35:44,190 --> 02:35:48,550
I think we should go to the way that we were going before Snuffy and I died.

5225
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:50,930
Yeah.

5226
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:52,050
Oh, there's food right here!

5227
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:53,650
Oh, you got some.

5228
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:55,710
That's right.

5229
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:57,510
I got me some oranges.

5230
02:35:58,910 --> 02:36:00,090
Some orange guys.

5231
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:01,570
I have a marshmallow.

5232
02:36:01,570 --> 02:36:03,350
Although, it's really, I mean...

5233
02:36:06,810 --> 02:36:09,010
I have nature to save me.

5234
02:36:09,130 --> 02:36:09,450
Oh, shoot!

5235
02:36:09,770 --> 02:36:10,270
Oh, shoot!

5236
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,670
Oh, no.

5237
02:36:11,910 --> 02:36:12,390
Oh, no.

5238
02:36:12,550 --> 02:36:13,290
Oh, no.

5239
02:36:13,710 --> 02:36:14,430
Oh, no.

5240
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:15,230
That's right.

5241
02:36:18,770 --> 02:36:19,850
You can't have it.

5242
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:21,750
Take it from my dead hands.

5243
02:36:22,110 --> 02:36:23,590
Take it from my dead hands.

5244
02:36:23,770 --> 02:36:24,670
I'm gonna choke you.

5245
02:36:24,850 --> 02:36:27,330
I'm gonna choke you and no one will know!

5246
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:28,170
Fine, take it!

5247
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:30,070
That's right.

5248
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:31,130
I took it.

5249
02:36:31,890 --> 02:36:33,210
You didn't take it.

5250
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:36,130
Do you... Did you get the boost from it?

5251
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:38,090
Yeah.

5252
02:36:38,490 --> 02:36:38,630
Okay.

5253
02:36:39,870 --> 02:36:42,090
It was a... It was a science experiment.

5254
02:36:42,550 --> 02:36:42,830
Hello!

5255
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:44,110
Hello!

5256
02:36:44,370 --> 02:36:45,290
Wait, wait, how... Oh!

5257
02:36:45,290 --> 02:36:46,950
Don't forget capybaras to the left!

5258
02:36:47,310 --> 02:36:47,570
Yeah!

5259
02:36:48,170 --> 02:36:49,110
Capybaras right there!

5260
02:36:49,450 --> 02:36:50,610
I've seen the capybaras!

5261
02:36:50,670 --> 02:36:51,670
I didn't get to see them!

5262
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:53,750
I'm heading over!

5263
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:53,870
Run!

5264
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:56,070
Get there before the storm comes!

5265
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:57,010
I'm running!

5266
02:36:57,010 --> 02:36:57,590
Get that mushroom!

5267
02:36:57,770 --> 02:36:58,590
Does it affect you when you're in there?

5268
02:36:58,850 --> 02:36:59,750
When you're in the storm?

5269
02:36:59,870 --> 02:37:00,330
No, it doesn't.

5270
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:02,110
Yeah, as long as you're in the water, you're okay.

5271
02:37:02,390 --> 02:37:03,530
Oh, is that them right there?

5272
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:04,990
Oh my god, they're so easy to get there!

5273
02:37:05,090 --> 02:37:05,330
Yeah!

5274
02:37:05,330 --> 02:37:05,430
Yeah!

5275
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:07,150
Yeah, they're right there!

5276
02:37:08,990 --> 02:37:11,310
Oh my god.

5277
02:37:11,570 --> 02:37:14,190
I don't wanna... I don't wanna be there with the capybaras.

5278
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:15,510
I'm tired!

5279
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:16,030
Come here!

5280
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:16,850
This way!

5281
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:16,930
I'm so tired!

5282
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:17,790
This way!

5283
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:21,190
Hello, little capybaras!

5284
02:37:21,310 --> 02:37:21,970
I am here!

5285
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:23,710
I hope they don't touch the lava.

5286
02:37:23,910 --> 02:37:25,970
They're... they're awfully close to the lava.

5287
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:27,810
Wait, what's on his head?

5288
02:37:27,910 --> 02:37:28,890
Oh my god, they're so cute!

5289
02:37:29,570 --> 02:37:29,790
Ooh!

5290
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:31,650
Ooh, eat it!

5291
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:33,670
Just stay in the water!

5292
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:35,490
It doesn't hurt you in here, no.

5293
02:37:35,490 --> 02:37:36,990
Oh, oh, oh!

5294
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:37,170
Yay!

5295
02:37:37,590 --> 02:37:38,910
Oh, I'm trying to get that!

5296
02:37:39,970 --> 02:37:40,510
Oh, ugh!

5297
02:37:41,470 --> 02:37:42,610
That Chris Berry!

5298
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:43,010
Yeah!

5299
02:37:43,390 --> 02:37:43,990
Why is it purple?

5300
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:45,550
The water is, like, so purple!

5301
02:37:45,850 --> 02:37:46,150
Yeah, why is it?

5302
02:37:46,150 --> 02:37:47,370
Why is it purple last time?

5303
02:37:47,650 --> 02:37:48,130
What the heck?

5304
02:37:48,930 --> 02:37:50,250
Maybe... because it's night time.

5305
02:37:50,530 --> 02:37:51,730
Maybe the pH level has changed.

5306
02:37:51,730 --> 02:37:53,010
Oh yeah, it's reflecting the clouds.

5307
02:37:53,170 --> 02:37:53,470
It's so pretty!

5308
02:37:53,470 --> 02:37:54,410
The pH levels?

5309
02:37:54,590 --> 02:37:55,850
Okay, nerd, shut up!

5310
02:37:55,870 --> 02:38:00,270
Yeah, the pH levels are high, because I was in there.

5311
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:01,590
The fog!

5312
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:03,310
The pH levels are high, because I was in there.

5313
02:38:03,310 --> 02:38:06,670
You guys, I think we should go to where Snuffy and I were at before.

5314
02:38:08,490 --> 02:38:09,250
Yeah, okay.

5315
02:38:09,610 --> 02:38:10,970
It's over towards the left.

5316
02:38:11,170 --> 02:38:11,350
Yeah.

5317
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,970
The other way seemed really difficult.

5318
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:16,110
It was.

5319
02:38:19,630 --> 02:38:22,650
What are you guys... cackling about?

5320
02:38:23,350 --> 02:38:23,790
Really!

5321
02:38:24,010 --> 02:38:24,530
Yeah, I flipped.

5322
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:26,470
Climb my train and take over my bird eggs!

5323
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:28,670
Nothing.

5324
02:38:29,350 --> 02:38:29,790
Nothing.

5325
02:38:31,130 --> 02:38:31,570
Nothing!

5326
02:38:34,770 --> 02:38:35,210
Alright.

5327
02:38:35,470 --> 02:38:36,690
Want me to feed you?

5328
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:38,110
We're going, we're going, we're going.

5329
02:38:38,110 --> 02:38:38,310
We're going, we're going.

5330
02:38:40,850 --> 02:38:42,570
I'm feeding, I'm feeding.

5331
02:38:43,210 --> 02:38:44,110
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

5332
02:38:46,290 --> 02:38:46,730
So full!

5333
02:38:46,730 --> 02:38:47,870
Oh, you were watching, didn't you?

5334
02:38:48,610 --> 02:38:50,570
I don't know what I was watching!

5335
02:38:50,890 --> 02:38:51,210
What?

5336
02:38:52,390 --> 02:38:54,870
I don't know what I was witnessing just then.

5337
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:57,750
Did someone have the other heal root, perhaps?

5338
02:38:59,470 --> 02:39:00,590
I need it.

5339
02:39:01,730 --> 02:39:02,790
What happened to you?

5340
02:39:03,490 --> 02:39:04,630
I don't have it.

5341
02:39:06,430 --> 02:39:08,650
I have this, is this what you wanted?

5342
02:39:09,710 --> 02:39:11,550
Yeah, could you feed it to me?

5343
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:14,930
I fell on my butt, please.

5344
02:39:16,510 --> 02:39:17,870
Get in, get in!

5345
02:39:17,870 --> 02:39:20,610
Please feed me the root, Ducky.

5346
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:25,520
Thank you.

5347
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:27,440
You did it.

5348
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:30,820
I don't have any fucking pride.

5349
02:39:34,930 --> 02:39:36,770
Oh, nice jump.

5350
02:39:38,110 --> 02:39:39,590
Whoa, parkour!

5351
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:40,350
Parkour!

5352
02:39:41,710 --> 02:39:42,310
Parkour!

5353
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:42,790
Parkour!

5354
02:39:42,950 --> 02:39:43,470
Stop!

5355
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,730
Get out of my way!

5356
02:39:45,090 --> 02:39:45,910
Get out of my way!

5357
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:48,830
Get out of my head!

5358
02:39:48,890 --> 02:39:49,690
Get out of my head!

5359
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:50,290
Come on!

5360
02:39:50,690 --> 02:39:53,730
This is, we're gonna require ultimate team work together.

5361
02:39:54,270 --> 02:39:54,550
Yeah.

5362
02:39:55,070 --> 02:39:57,170
I don't remember even where me and Mint were.

5363
02:39:57,770 --> 02:40:00,370
It was like, I don't remember either, actually.

5364
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,270
Is this the right way?

5365
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:05,610
I mean, it looks pretty good, honestly.

5366
02:40:05,610 --> 02:40:07,290
I have no idea.

5367
02:40:07,470 --> 02:40:09,570
I go by based on fields and vibes.

5368
02:40:11,950 --> 02:40:13,930
I don't need a map or a compass.

5369
02:40:14,390 --> 02:40:15,130
I got vibes.

5370
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:15,850
I got vibes.

5371
02:40:16,110 --> 02:40:16,270
I got vibes.

5372
02:40:17,210 --> 02:40:19,350
My body tells me this is the right way.

5373
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:20,410
I'm coming.

5374
02:40:20,510 --> 02:40:21,390
The wind is blowing.

5375
02:40:21,810 --> 02:40:22,450
I can smell it.

5376
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:22,950
Thank you.

5377
02:40:25,010 --> 02:40:25,750
Go here?

5378
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:28,390
Where are you going?

5379
02:40:29,370 --> 02:40:30,270
I have no idea.

5380
02:40:30,430 --> 02:40:30,690
I'm going.

5381
02:40:30,830 --> 02:40:31,090
Oh.

5382
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:31,610
Uh-oh.

5383
02:40:31,730 --> 02:40:32,450
I'm going down.

5384
02:40:32,770 --> 02:40:33,130
I'm going down.

5385
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:41,350
Also, is the implication that the Scoutmaster is actually a psychopath and has put us through this trial on purpose because the campfire set up with marshmallows at the top every time?

5386
02:40:41,350 --> 02:40:44,650
Well, when you told me that he comes and attacks us, I was like...

5387
02:40:44,650 --> 02:40:45,150
Wait, what?

5388
02:40:45,410 --> 02:40:46,270
Aren't we, like...

5389
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:47,910
Aren't we on an airplane crash?

5390
02:40:48,350 --> 02:40:50,350
So does he have the anti-air or some shit that blew up our plane?

5391
02:40:50,810 --> 02:40:50,990
We...

5392
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:51,570
Yeah, we could have.

5393
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:53,470
We could have been saved this whole time.

5394
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:53,810
Yeah.

5395
02:40:54,490 --> 02:40:55,950
Scoutmaster wants this for us.

5396
02:40:56,050 --> 02:40:57,090
Wait, he attacks us?

5397
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:57,250
Yeah.

5398
02:40:57,250 --> 02:40:58,210
He has anti-air.

5399
02:40:58,390 --> 02:40:58,630
Yeah.

5400
02:40:58,850 --> 02:41:07,110
If you climb ahead of your friends, which is why I was waiting for Snuffy on the last map, if you climb too far ahead, he spawns and, like, throws you off the mountain.

5401
02:41:07,690 --> 02:41:08,090
What?

5402
02:41:08,810 --> 02:41:10,250
Wait, I kind of want to see it.

5403
02:41:10,250 --> 02:41:11,770
He's just waiting for it to happen, yeah.

5404
02:41:13,210 --> 02:41:14,430
Oh, this is safe.

5405
02:41:14,650 --> 02:41:16,210
We can all just leave Doki behind.

5406
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:17,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5407
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:19,370
I'm literally right here.

5408
02:41:20,090 --> 02:41:21,130
I'm literally right here.

5409
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:22,930
Being left behind doesn't make him show up.

5410
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:23,790
Oh.

5411
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:24,830
That's it.

5412
02:41:24,910 --> 02:41:25,190
I'm angry.

5413
02:41:25,410 --> 02:41:25,850
Leaving...

5414
02:41:25,850 --> 02:41:27,410
Leaving others behind in your solo.

5415
02:41:29,090 --> 02:41:30,630
Eating your anger away?

5416
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:31,350
Are you...

5417
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:33,350
There's actually so much food on this mountain.

5418
02:41:33,550 --> 02:41:33,910
Holy crap.

5419
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:35,210
You're not you when you're hungry.

5420
02:41:36,130 --> 02:41:36,470
Yeah.

5421
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:38,030
Hmm.

5422
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:39,670
Maybe up here?

5423
02:41:39,670 --> 02:41:40,870
Oh, left or right?

5424
02:41:41,350 --> 02:41:42,190
I think that's more than right.

5425
02:41:42,190 --> 02:41:43,510
Oh, I see a suitcase down there.

5426
02:41:44,190 --> 02:41:44,550
I see a suitcase down there.

5427
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:46,590
Yeah, I see a suitcase there too, but is it worth it?

5428
02:41:46,750 --> 02:41:47,370
I don't know.

5429
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,630
There's nowhere to go left.

5430
02:41:50,770 --> 02:41:51,930
I think that that much is clear.

5431
02:41:51,930 --> 02:41:54,030
Maybe, can we climb this tree and jump to here?

5432
02:41:54,390 --> 02:41:55,270
That seems kind of fucked.

5433
02:41:55,650 --> 02:41:56,310
Do it!

5434
02:41:56,310 --> 02:41:57,770
Oh, there's a thugish down there.

5435
02:41:57,790 --> 02:41:58,630
This is my calling!

5436
02:41:59,150 --> 02:41:59,470
I'm trying!

5437
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:01,570
Oh!

5438
02:42:01,690 --> 02:42:01,950
Oh!

5439
02:42:03,090 --> 02:42:03,510
Oh!

5440
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:05,630
So, uh, that tree doesn't appear to have a hip box.

5441
02:42:05,870 --> 02:42:06,250
She's okay.

5442
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:07,930
I don't think we can grab that.

5443
02:42:07,970 --> 02:42:10,130
The branches, you cannot grab, guys.

5444
02:42:10,350 --> 02:42:11,190
I just wanna let you know.

5445
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:11,570
You can.

5446
02:42:11,570 --> 02:42:12,250
You cannot grab.

5447
02:42:13,170 --> 02:42:16,390
Wait, so we can't touch the pretty blue crystal either?

5448
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:18,670
They turn, they freeze you.

5449
02:42:18,970 --> 02:42:19,330
Oh.

5450
02:42:20,090 --> 02:42:21,510
Oh, so what do we do?

5451
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:22,650
We just go down?

5452
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:24,210
I mean, you can touch them briefly.

5453
02:42:25,370 --> 02:42:26,630
Does anyone have rope?

5454
02:42:27,770 --> 02:42:29,590
Like, don't we have a chaingun or something?

5455
02:42:29,830 --> 02:42:30,690
You could chaingun to here.

5456
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:33,170
I don't think anyone grabbed the chaingun.

5457
02:42:33,490 --> 02:42:33,690
What?

5458
02:42:34,030 --> 02:42:35,870
How did nobody grab the chaingun?

5459
02:42:36,290 --> 02:42:37,010
I didn't.

5460
02:42:37,250 --> 02:42:38,790
Where was the chaingun?

5461
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:42,030
It was in the last, in the last map, I thought.

5462
02:42:42,950 --> 02:42:44,170
Nobody grabbed it.

5463
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:45,930
I don't have it on my backpack.

5464
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:46,750
I didn't see it.

5465
02:42:46,910 --> 02:42:47,010
Go ahead.

5466
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:51,090
I saw it, but I thought someone with a backpack was gonna grab it.

5467
02:42:51,330 --> 02:42:52,930
Maybe that was the last one, but it's misremembered.

5468
02:42:53,870 --> 02:42:57,190
Yeah, there's two people with backpacks, and that's not us, Doki.

5469
02:42:57,610 --> 02:42:57,970
I'm just saying.

5470
02:42:58,190 --> 02:42:58,590
Yeah, it's not us.

5471
02:42:58,730 --> 02:42:59,790
It's not our fault.

5472
02:43:00,710 --> 02:43:01,570
It's not our fault.

5473
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:02,410
It's not our fault.

5474
02:43:02,410 --> 02:43:02,790
It's not our fault.

5475
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:03,450
Whatever.

5476
02:43:04,310 --> 02:43:04,630
No.

5477
02:43:05,670 --> 02:43:06,750
I think we're gonna have to go back down.

5478
02:43:06,770 --> 02:43:08,610
Wait, I have a shelf thing.

5479
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:09,350
Will that help?

5480
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:11,070
Maybe?

5481
02:43:11,650 --> 02:43:13,030
Yeah, maybe we could shelf that.

5482
02:43:13,150 --> 02:43:13,630
Oh, wait, wait.

5483
02:43:14,130 --> 02:43:14,330
That's the shelf.

5484
02:43:14,330 --> 02:43:14,890
I can...

5485
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:16,650
Don't worry, I'm a M-M-M-M-G.

5486
02:43:16,910 --> 02:43:17,250
Okay, okay.

5487
02:43:17,710 --> 02:43:18,810
I'm watching, I'm watching.

5488
02:43:19,410 --> 02:43:20,130
Watch this.

5489
02:43:21,050 --> 02:43:21,390
Oh!

5490
02:43:22,530 --> 02:43:23,030
Very good.

5491
02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:26,330
Yeah, and then we grab there and then we get over there.

5492
02:43:26,930 --> 02:43:27,290
Right?

5493
02:43:27,830 --> 02:43:28,050
Huh?

5494
02:43:28,290 --> 02:43:29,270
Wait, I found the chain launcher.

5495
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:30,490
I thought we were going up here.

5496
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:31,890
Oh, we have a chain launcher.

5497
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:33,170
Oh, you found the chain launcher.

5498
02:43:33,530 --> 02:43:34,010
Yeah, I have a chain launcher.

5499
02:43:34,010 --> 02:43:35,610
Okay, maybe we go to the shelves and then go there.

5500
02:43:35,790 --> 02:43:36,950
Either way, I think we want this.

5501
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:38,050
Want what?

5502
02:43:38,050 --> 02:43:38,150
What?

5503
02:43:38,390 --> 02:43:38,910
What do we want?

5504
02:43:39,650 --> 02:43:39,950
Okay.

5505
02:43:39,950 --> 02:43:40,870
We want to go here.

5506
02:43:41,010 --> 02:43:41,530
Oh, okay, okay.

5507
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:43,690
You can do it, Snuffy.

5508
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:46,470
Snuffy, Snuffy, Snuffy.

5509
02:43:46,590 --> 02:43:48,470
Wait, what if I go really, really far?

5510
02:43:48,630 --> 02:43:50,150
Wait, I kind of...

5511
02:43:50,150 --> 02:43:51,010
Wait, this might be...

5512
02:43:51,010 --> 02:43:51,510
Don't be...

5513
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:51,930
Hold on.

5514
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:52,790
Wait, what are we doing?

5515
02:43:53,630 --> 02:43:54,270
She's experimenting.

5516
02:43:58,130 --> 02:44:07,430
I think she might...

5517
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:08,150
Oh, nice.

5518
02:44:08,310 --> 02:44:09,550
I put it a little higher.

5519
02:44:09,550 --> 02:44:09,570
I put it a little higher.

5520
02:44:10,730 --> 02:44:11,550
Look at her go.

5521
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:17,130
Oh, that's such a fucking bad timing for the storm.

5522
02:44:17,910 --> 02:44:18,770
Oh, take it easy, guys.

5523
02:44:21,730 --> 02:44:23,530
Oh, oh, thanks.

5524
02:44:24,210 --> 02:44:25,550
Wait, how do I get off this thing?

5525
02:44:25,970 --> 02:44:26,530
Get me off...

5526
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:26,950
In quest space.

5527
02:44:27,330 --> 02:44:28,270
Just wildly rad.

5528
02:44:28,650 --> 02:44:28,670
Okay.

5529
02:44:31,310 --> 02:44:31,990
Okay, I'm coming.

5530
02:44:32,750 --> 02:44:33,690
I'm coming over, too.

5531
02:44:33,690 --> 02:44:36,550
I kind of got fucked because I had to jump off the shelter, so I might be scared.

5532
02:44:36,550 --> 02:44:39,210
If I could put it some way that, like, you could jump off here.

5533
02:44:39,430 --> 02:44:40,730
Can we even climb up that?

5534
02:44:41,110 --> 02:44:42,370
No, you can climb up that?

5535
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:43,410
I think I'm fucked.

5536
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:44,290
Wait, no!

5537
02:44:44,690 --> 02:44:44,990
No, wait.

5538
02:44:45,090 --> 02:44:45,550
I have rope.

5539
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:46,050
I have rope.

5540
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:47,150
Okay.

5541
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:48,190
That would be cool.

5542
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:48,930
Just be careful.

5543
02:44:48,950 --> 02:44:49,350
There's lava.

5544
02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:49,890
There's lava.

5545
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:53,770
I'm gonna check that suitcase.

5546
02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:54,770
Watch out.

5547
02:44:54,830 --> 02:44:55,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5548
02:44:55,870 --> 02:44:57,150
I'm not gonna check the suitcase.

5549
02:44:58,350 --> 02:44:59,790
Can you see the rope, Wymou?

5550
02:45:00,470 --> 02:45:01,290
I can, yeah.

5551
02:45:02,070 --> 02:45:02,730
Okay, I'm gonna put it...

5552
02:45:02,730 --> 02:45:03,590
I'm huddled, I'm huddled.

5553
02:45:03,830 --> 02:45:04,890
Oh, ouchy, ouchy.

5554
02:45:04,890 --> 02:45:05,790
I'm like a penguin.

5555
02:45:05,830 --> 02:45:06,970
Oh, ouch, ouch.

5556
02:45:07,190 --> 02:45:09,850
Yeah, yeah, I hope that's enough.

5557
02:45:10,450 --> 02:45:13,530
Why does the lava not keep us warm, you know?

5558
02:45:13,750 --> 02:45:14,970
I think it does a little bit.

5559
02:45:16,730 --> 02:45:17,830
Okay, it's gone.

5560
02:45:18,110 --> 02:45:18,570
We're good.

5561
02:45:19,130 --> 02:45:19,310
Okay.

5562
02:45:20,090 --> 02:45:21,510
I'm going for the suitcase.

5563
02:45:22,850 --> 02:45:23,950
You were too late.

5564
02:45:24,270 --> 02:45:24,950
Oh, it's a lantern.

5565
02:45:25,770 --> 02:45:26,530
Trail mix!

5566
02:45:26,790 --> 02:45:28,070
Does the lantern keep us hot?

5567
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:29,690
I don't know.

5568
02:45:29,890 --> 02:45:30,770
It does, yes.

5569
02:45:31,570 --> 02:45:32,570
How do we go up?

5570
02:45:34,390 --> 02:45:35,430
What are those?

5571
02:45:36,090 --> 02:45:36,870
What is that thing?

5572
02:45:37,130 --> 02:45:37,650
What are those?

5573
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:38,650
What are those?

5574
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:40,530
Oh, that's the thing that flashbangs Snuffy.

5575
02:45:40,810 --> 02:45:41,050
Yeah, yeah.

5576
02:45:41,230 --> 02:45:41,910
Wait, what?

5577
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:42,650
Lava.

5578
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:45,070
I think you can come up this way.

5579
02:45:47,710 --> 02:45:48,230
Uh-oh.

5580
02:45:48,690 --> 02:45:49,670
You can come straight up here.

5581
02:45:50,510 --> 02:45:51,070
Yeah, I'm going to wait.

5582
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,350
Give me your hat!

5583
02:45:52,850 --> 02:45:53,530
Give me your hat!

5584
02:45:53,550 --> 02:45:55,150
Oh, look, you mean...

5585
02:45:57,330 --> 02:45:58,750
I'm a little peckish.

5586
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:00,210
Oh, yes, yummy!

5587
02:46:00,610 --> 02:46:01,070
Thank you!

5588
02:46:04,430 --> 02:46:06,370
You enjoyed all of feeding.

5589
02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:09,950
Oh, yeah, this is how we do it.

5590
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:12,050
This is going pretty good!

5591
02:46:12,610 --> 02:46:12,870
Oh, man!

5592
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:15,470
Come on, come on!

5593
02:46:15,890 --> 02:46:16,170
No!

5594
02:46:17,570 --> 02:46:18,310
I lost...

5595
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:19,630
Go straight, straight up this way.

5596
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:20,530
Straight up this way instead.

5597
02:46:20,830 --> 02:46:21,110
Okay.

5598
02:46:21,410 --> 02:46:23,370
I lost all my extra energy.

5599
02:46:24,290 --> 02:46:24,690
No!

5600
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:27,570
Oh!

5601
02:46:28,230 --> 02:46:28,610
What the?

5602
02:46:29,050 --> 02:46:29,570
Thank you.

5603
02:46:29,750 --> 02:46:30,350
Okay, there we go.

5604
02:46:30,850 --> 02:46:31,830
Come back up, Snuffy.

5605
02:46:31,970 --> 02:46:32,290
I got you.

5606
02:46:34,950 --> 02:46:35,690
The music.

5607
02:46:37,410 --> 02:46:38,070
Thank you.

5608
02:46:39,350 --> 02:46:40,630
We're going, we're going.

5609
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:42,110
We're going, we're going.

5610
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:43,370
We're going, we're going.

5611
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:43,670
We're going here.

5612
02:46:44,230 --> 02:46:45,090
We're going here.

5613
02:46:45,570 --> 02:46:45,910
Yeah.

5614
02:46:47,170 --> 02:46:47,610
Yeah.

5615
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:49,310
And then...

5616
02:46:49,310 --> 02:46:50,550
How did you get all the way up there?

5617
02:46:51,270 --> 02:46:52,110
I just did.

5618
02:46:52,430 --> 02:46:52,950
Oh, wait.

5619
02:46:52,990 --> 02:46:54,110
There's a little spot here.

5620
02:46:54,330 --> 02:46:54,350
Just keep climbing.

5621
02:46:54,870 --> 02:46:56,450
There's a little tiny...

5622
02:46:56,950 --> 02:46:57,530
Oh, God.

5623
02:46:57,730 --> 02:46:58,250
The lava.

5624
02:46:58,670 --> 02:46:59,510
Oh, the lava.

5625
02:46:59,890 --> 02:47:01,010
Don't touch the lava.

5626
02:47:01,190 --> 02:47:02,030
It's a little spicy.

5627
02:47:03,910 --> 02:47:05,690
That's what the sound it makes when you touch it.

5628
02:47:11,850 --> 02:47:12,730
I think...

5629
02:47:12,730 --> 02:47:14,410
I don't know where to go after this.

5630
02:47:14,750 --> 02:47:16,250
I'm going to wait for Snuff Master Llama.

5631
02:47:16,730 --> 02:47:21,030
I think we might actually want to go, like, around this way?

5632
02:47:22,070 --> 02:47:22,590
Yeah, it's not here.

5633
02:47:22,610 --> 02:47:23,810
You see this little bit here?

5634
02:47:24,710 --> 02:47:25,030
No.

5635
02:47:26,330 --> 02:47:26,590
No.

5636
02:47:27,610 --> 02:47:28,130
There.

5637
02:47:30,930 --> 02:47:32,470
Oh, that seems kind of hard.

5638
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:34,430
How are you going to get there with Llama?

5639
02:47:34,430 --> 02:47:34,490
Yeah.

5640
02:47:35,250 --> 02:47:36,050
I don't know.

5641
02:47:36,290 --> 02:47:37,370
How is it looking that way?

5642
02:47:37,510 --> 02:47:37,850
Is it okay?

5643
02:47:39,930 --> 02:47:40,330
Um...

5644
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:41,030
It...

5645
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,770
It's good.

5646
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:42,450
I think it's better.

5647
02:47:42,630 --> 02:47:42,930
It's better.

5648
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:43,450
Okay.

5649
02:47:43,730 --> 02:47:43,870
Okay.

5650
02:47:44,370 --> 02:47:45,150
Let's go this way, then.

5651
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:47,370
I think it looks...

5652
02:47:47,370 --> 02:47:48,590
A little bit easier.

5653
02:47:49,050 --> 02:47:51,050
Although, how do we get up that first part there?

5654
02:47:51,490 --> 02:47:52,290
A tree?

5655
02:47:52,850 --> 02:47:53,670
Is that crazy?

5656
02:47:54,510 --> 02:47:57,210
Oh, there's actually a huge jump, though.

5657
02:47:57,710 --> 02:47:58,430
Oh, there's some fruit.

5658
02:47:59,290 --> 02:47:59,470
Oh.

5659
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:00,790
I'll try.

5660
02:48:02,190 --> 02:48:04,590
I feel like this one might actually be more straightforward.

5661
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:09,130
If you can get across there, and then you go up here, and then up here.

5662
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:10,730
I would watch you guys demonstrate.

5663
02:48:11,170 --> 02:48:11,450
Okay.

5664
02:48:11,970 --> 02:48:13,530
I mean, you could maybe use the tree.

5665
02:48:14,110 --> 02:48:14,390
I don't know.

5666
02:48:14,390 --> 02:48:15,930
Wait, but there's a luggage over there.

5667
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:16,510
Yeah.

5668
02:48:17,050 --> 02:48:17,330
I want that.

5669
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:18,630
Oh, that's a huge fucking jump, though.

5670
02:48:18,770 --> 02:48:19,770
We have another rope.

5671
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:24,230
It's not that big of a jump.

5672
02:48:24,450 --> 02:48:25,170
Use your...

5673
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:25,770
Use your...

5674
02:48:25,770 --> 02:48:26,230
Gamer legs.

5675
02:48:27,790 --> 02:48:28,730
Gamer legs?

5676
02:48:28,970 --> 02:48:29,130
Oh.

5677
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:29,570
Yeah.

5678
02:48:30,190 --> 02:48:31,030
What do we do?

5679
02:48:31,330 --> 02:48:32,090
It's a jump master.

5680
02:48:33,110 --> 02:48:33,650
I'm yum yum.

5681
02:48:33,890 --> 02:48:33,950
Oh.

5682
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:36,250
I'm yum yum yum yum yum.

5683
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:43,990
Who's hungry?

5684
02:48:44,310 --> 02:48:44,830
Anybody?

5685
02:48:46,030 --> 02:48:46,750
I'm good.

5686
02:48:46,990 --> 02:48:47,390
Thank you.

5687
02:48:48,270 --> 02:48:48,770
Okay.

5688
02:48:50,850 --> 02:48:51,370
Yeah.

5689
02:48:53,250 --> 02:48:54,310
We go over there.

5690
02:48:54,490 --> 02:48:55,490
To the right side.

5691
02:48:56,230 --> 02:48:57,310
That's really far.

5692
02:48:57,430 --> 02:48:58,130
There's no way.

5693
02:48:58,610 --> 02:48:59,910
Yeah, it's so far.

5694
02:49:01,810 --> 02:49:03,030
Where else we go?

5695
02:49:05,310 --> 02:49:06,670
I'm gonna try the jump.

5696
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:07,330
Oh my gosh.

5697
02:49:07,490 --> 02:49:08,070
She's doing it.

5698
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:08,570
Do your best.

5699
02:49:08,770 --> 02:49:09,250
Oh my god.

5700
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:10,130
Oh my god.

5701
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:10,830
Scout master.

5702
02:49:11,310 --> 02:49:11,850
Scout master.

5703
02:49:11,850 --> 02:49:11,910
Scout master did it.

5704
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:12,670
Scout master!

5705
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:13,930
She's a scout master.

5706
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:14,630
It's not too bad.

5707
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:15,290
It's not too bad.

5708
02:49:15,470 --> 02:49:15,890
You can like...

5709
02:49:15,890 --> 02:49:16,610
This is strangers.

5710
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:17,370
Okay.

5711
02:49:18,610 --> 02:49:19,570
Alright, go snum.

5712
02:49:19,810 --> 02:49:20,430
I've got...

5713
02:49:20,430 --> 02:49:21,290
I got my arm up for you.

5714
02:49:21,290 --> 02:49:21,970
Jump, yeah.

5715
02:49:22,030 --> 02:49:23,450
I don't have a ton of stamina.

5716
02:49:23,970 --> 02:49:24,210
Wow!

5717
02:49:24,850 --> 02:49:26,110
Scout master did it!

5718
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:29,990
I'm so proud of you.

5719
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:31,490
Oh my god!

5720
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:32,310
I'm gaming!

5721
02:49:33,170 --> 02:49:33,510
Ma!

5722
02:49:33,810 --> 02:49:34,350
Get the cat!

5723
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:37,840
Hooray!

5724
02:49:39,020 --> 02:49:39,640
We made it!

5725
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:40,980
Yeah, we're here for the storm.

5726
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:42,060
Don't touch this rock.

5727
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:42,680
Don't touch the rock.

5728
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:43,380
Don't touch the boot.

5729
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:44,460
They're very freezy.

5730
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:45,640
It's a dangerous rock.

5731
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:46,880
I'm touching it.

5732
02:49:46,940 --> 02:49:47,680
I'm touching it.

5733
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:50,440
There's some food above us as well for those who don't have stamina.

5734
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:51,240
I'm touching it.

5735
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:52,760
Is it a safe place?

5736
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:54,960
It's red food, so it's nice.

5737
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:56,880
And a suitcase.

5738
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:57,300
I love it this way.

5739
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,320
It's like a little cave in here.

5740
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:00,400
Oh, we're going the other way.

5741
02:50:00,620 --> 02:50:00,920
Are you diving?

5742
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:02,460
I know.

5743
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:04,700
Wait, now can you stick out your hand?

5744
02:50:04,840 --> 02:50:05,500
Because I might fall.

5745
02:50:06,060 --> 02:50:07,000
What if we were caved?

5746
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:07,140
Okay.

5747
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:08,120
I'm okay.

5748
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:09,500
You're great.

5749
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:10,160
You're doing wonderful.

5750
02:50:10,520 --> 02:50:11,580
I'm doing so well.

5751
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:13,880
Here we go after that.

5752
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:17,160
There's some food and there's a tree if you want any.

5753
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:18,040
See?

5754
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:18,700
No.

5755
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:19,980
It's too far.

5756
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:22,860
Snum.

5757
02:50:23,180 --> 02:50:24,560
The job for snum.

5758
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:29,300
Who's the one that always climbs the trees?

5759
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:30,340
It's snum.

5760
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:33,700
Hey, where do we go after this?

5761
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:34,740
Anybody need any food?

5762
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:36,200
Oh, let's see.

5763
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:36,860
I'm okay.

5764
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:37,320
I'm okay.

5765
02:50:43,470 --> 02:50:44,270
This is good.

5766
02:50:44,750 --> 02:50:45,150
Okay.

5767
02:50:46,210 --> 02:50:46,990
Oh, wow.

5768
02:50:47,210 --> 02:50:47,750
Thanks a lot.

5769
02:50:47,790 --> 02:50:48,690
I can put my arm up for you.

5770
02:50:48,950 --> 02:50:49,010
Wow.

5771
02:50:49,530 --> 02:50:50,030
You're welcome.

5772
02:50:51,610 --> 02:50:52,890
Wait, that one was all me.

5773
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:55,370
I'm glad I was very helpful.

5774
02:50:55,430 --> 02:50:56,250
Wait, why do I...

5775
02:50:56,250 --> 02:50:57,550
Why can't I stand?

5776
02:50:58,630 --> 02:50:59,770
I got you.

5777
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:02,510
Oh, whoa, whoa.

5778
02:51:02,730 --> 02:51:03,470
Huddle, huddle, huddle.

5779
02:51:03,690 --> 02:51:04,790
I'm cold, I'm cold.

5780
02:51:04,930 --> 02:51:05,150
I'm cold.

5781
02:51:05,470 --> 02:51:06,070
I feel so cold.

5782
02:51:06,830 --> 02:51:07,650
Snubby's got a lantern.

5783
02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:08,470
You're cool, you're cool.

5784
02:51:08,930 --> 02:51:09,870
I'm not cold.

5785
02:51:09,870 --> 02:51:10,350
I got her somewhere.

5786
02:51:10,630 --> 02:51:11,310
I feel cold.

5787
02:51:11,570 --> 02:51:12,450
Hey, no, you're so cool.

5788
02:51:14,190 --> 02:51:15,010
Is she fitting?

5789
02:51:15,070 --> 02:51:16,250
Are we all fitting on here somehow?

5790
02:51:16,730 --> 02:51:17,870
We're here, we're here, we're all.

5791
02:51:17,970 --> 02:51:18,410
Alrighty.

5792
02:51:18,930 --> 02:51:19,290
Alright.

5793
02:51:22,130 --> 02:51:23,670
Onwards and upwards, gang.

5794
02:51:24,670 --> 02:51:25,490
Is that any good?

5795
02:51:26,850 --> 02:51:27,930
Yeah, I don't like this eye.

5796
02:51:27,930 --> 02:51:28,230
Yeah.

5797
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:30,610
Oh, not, not yeah.

5798
02:51:30,930 --> 02:51:31,270
Not yeah.

5799
02:51:31,570 --> 02:51:31,870
Not yeah.

5800
02:51:33,730 --> 02:51:34,650
There is...

5801
02:51:34,650 --> 02:51:35,150
Oh, Jesus.

5802
02:51:35,750 --> 02:51:36,650
There's this bit here?

5803
02:51:36,650 --> 02:51:38,870
If we can jump across the lava behind Mint.

5804
02:51:39,710 --> 02:51:40,150
Oh.

5805
02:51:40,250 --> 02:51:41,610
But it's still really far.

5806
02:51:41,810 --> 02:51:41,930
Wait.

5807
02:51:41,930 --> 02:51:42,710
It's still really far.

5808
02:51:43,230 --> 02:51:43,290
Oh.

5809
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:44,270
What about to our left?

5810
02:51:45,250 --> 02:51:46,830
That's like really far.

5811
02:51:47,810 --> 02:51:47,990
Hmm.

5812
02:51:48,830 --> 02:51:49,930
Anything over that way?

5813
02:51:50,750 --> 02:51:51,090
Hmm.

5814
02:51:52,050 --> 02:51:52,630
Actually, yeah.

5815
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:54,890
I wonder if I eat, if I can make it up there.

5816
02:51:55,330 --> 02:51:55,650
Okay.

5817
02:51:55,910 --> 02:51:56,470
I'm gonna try.

5818
02:51:57,010 --> 02:51:57,930
No, you, you...

5819
02:51:57,930 --> 02:51:58,310
I don't...

5820
02:51:58,310 --> 02:51:59,090
I don't think so, Mint.

5821
02:51:59,990 --> 02:52:00,290
Careful.

5822
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:01,130
Is that safe?

5823
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:02,050
Oh.

5824
02:52:02,310 --> 02:52:03,010
Why am I poisoned?

5825
02:52:03,470 --> 02:52:03,770
Uh oh.

5826
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:04,830
Come this way, Mint.

5827
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:06,750
You got it.

5828
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:07,850
This is safe.

5829
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:09,010
Bye!

5830
02:52:09,370 --> 02:52:09,510
Thank you.

5831
02:52:10,690 --> 02:52:11,790
Min, come this way.

5832
02:52:12,470 --> 02:52:13,190
Uh, which...

5833
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:13,690
Oh?

5834
02:52:14,490 --> 02:52:14,850
Where?

5835
02:52:14,970 --> 02:52:15,470
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5836
02:52:15,570 --> 02:52:16,530
Oh, there's a safe, there's a safe.

5837
02:52:17,690 --> 02:52:18,230
Oh no.

5838
02:52:18,690 --> 02:52:19,010
Oh no.

5839
02:52:19,150 --> 02:52:19,210
Oh no.

5840
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:19,390
Come on out.

5841
02:52:19,390 --> 02:52:20,010
Min, are you okay?

5842
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:21,230
Can you see my room?

5843
02:52:21,390 --> 02:52:21,670
Yeah.

5844
02:52:22,210 --> 02:52:23,170
Wait, how do I get to there?

5845
02:52:23,170 --> 02:52:23,450
Is it?

5846
02:52:24,010 --> 02:52:24,490
I'm good.

5847
02:52:24,510 --> 02:52:25,410
It doesn't come in.

5848
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:26,690
I need an extra.

5849
02:52:26,830 --> 02:52:28,510
Just a little bit of stamina to get back.

5850
02:52:29,270 --> 02:52:29,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5851
02:52:30,030 --> 02:52:30,550
You're fine.

5852
02:52:30,750 --> 02:52:31,090
You got it.

5853
02:52:32,430 --> 02:52:34,690
Guys, I don't think I'll have enough stamina.

5854
02:52:38,330 --> 02:52:39,830
It was a green berry?

5855
02:52:40,010 --> 02:52:41,210
It looked like an apple to me.

5856
02:52:41,430 --> 02:52:42,030
I'm trying to look at you.

5857
02:52:42,150 --> 02:52:42,490
I'm dealing.

5858
02:52:42,830 --> 02:52:43,210
Come here.

5859
02:52:44,970 --> 02:52:46,150
I need to go out here.

5860
02:52:46,850 --> 02:52:47,330
Come here.

5861
02:52:47,430 --> 02:52:47,590
Come here.

5862
02:52:47,970 --> 02:52:48,330
Where?

5863
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:49,750
Where's here?

5864
02:52:49,990 --> 02:52:50,630
Where are you?

5865
02:52:51,170 --> 02:52:51,490
Come here.

5866
02:52:51,650 --> 02:52:52,410
Oh, I see you?

5867
02:52:53,350 --> 02:52:54,270
I need some damage.

5868
02:52:54,570 --> 02:52:55,290
I'm so cold.

5869
02:52:55,510 --> 02:52:55,930
Okay, I'm good.

5870
02:52:56,030 --> 02:52:56,230
I'm good.

5871
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:56,470
I'm good.

5872
02:52:56,490 --> 02:52:57,170
I'm okay now.

5873
02:52:57,910 --> 02:52:58,210
Okay.

5874
02:52:58,210 --> 02:52:59,350
Okay, I'm ready to grab you.

5875
02:53:00,270 --> 02:53:01,270
Okay, give me a sec.

5876
02:53:01,490 --> 02:53:02,290
I need to get up.

5877
02:53:02,290 --> 02:53:02,870
Oh, no, my lantern!

5878
02:53:03,290 --> 02:53:04,250
Oh, I could've...

5879
02:53:04,250 --> 02:53:05,810
Ouch, this took more damage.

5880
02:53:06,270 --> 02:53:07,150
No, the lantern!

5881
02:53:07,370 --> 02:53:09,410
Give me a sec, I need to recharge my stamina.

5882
02:53:09,490 --> 02:53:10,010
The lantern!

5883
02:53:10,830 --> 02:53:11,630
I think I need to grab it.

5884
02:53:12,170 --> 02:53:13,030
Can you get up here, Min?

5885
02:53:13,190 --> 02:53:13,470
Okay.

5886
02:53:14,890 --> 02:53:15,210
Um...

5887
02:53:15,210 --> 02:53:16,030
I don't think so.

5888
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:17,450
Alright, I'm coming up.

5889
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:19,450
From the tree, maybe?

5890
02:53:19,590 --> 02:53:20,170
Let's try it.

5891
02:53:21,810 --> 02:53:23,070
I'm coming up.

5892
02:53:23,070 --> 02:53:23,110
I do.

5893
02:53:23,230 --> 02:53:23,730
You do?

5894
02:53:24,610 --> 02:53:25,230
I'm coming.

5895
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:30,850
Sorry, there was no room for me down here to put this, but...

5896
02:53:30,850 --> 02:53:33,070
Snuffy, if you can climb up here, I got the...

5897
02:53:33,070 --> 02:53:33,490
I gotta...

5898
02:53:33,490 --> 02:53:34,290
What is this?

5899
02:53:35,430 --> 02:53:36,350
Oh my god!

5900
02:53:38,570 --> 02:53:39,530
I'm so...

5901
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:40,190
Oh my god!

5902
02:53:40,710 --> 02:53:41,110
I'm so...

5903
02:53:41,110 --> 02:53:41,350
Okay.

5904
02:53:41,690 --> 02:53:44,650
I can help you too, so hopefully together we can come back up.

5905
02:53:44,930 --> 02:53:46,210
She's a team player!

5906
02:53:47,250 --> 02:53:47,730
Snuffy!

5907
02:53:48,430 --> 02:53:49,490
Snuffy the goat!

5908
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:52,530
Wait, how do I...

5909
02:53:52,530 --> 02:53:52,950
We're coming!

5910
02:53:53,070 --> 02:53:53,210
We're coming!

5911
02:53:53,230 --> 02:53:53,530
Crap!

5912
02:53:53,970 --> 02:53:54,950
Oh my gosh, I got the rope!

5913
02:53:57,610 --> 02:53:58,090
Oh.

5914
02:53:58,330 --> 02:53:58,550
Ouch.

5915
02:54:05,310 --> 02:54:05,790
Snuggle.

5916
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:06,450
Snuggle.

5917
02:54:06,570 --> 02:54:07,050
Snuggle.

5918
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:08,150
Snuggling.

5919
02:54:08,150 --> 02:54:08,270
Cuddling.

5920
02:54:08,410 --> 02:54:08,670
Cuddling.

5921
02:54:09,590 --> 02:54:10,330
Guys, guys!

5922
02:54:10,570 --> 02:54:11,270
Are you guys...

5923
02:54:11,270 --> 02:54:12,030
Are you guys here?

5924
02:54:12,170 --> 02:54:12,870
We're running out of time.

5925
02:54:13,130 --> 02:54:14,130
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

5926
02:54:14,730 --> 02:54:15,490
What's happening?

5927
02:54:15,770 --> 02:54:15,990
Where?

5928
02:54:16,550 --> 02:54:17,690
Where did you guys go?

5929
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:18,010
Right here.

5930
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:19,010
Right here, right above you.

5931
02:54:19,990 --> 02:54:20,050
Oh.

5932
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:21,730
Grab my hand!

5933
02:54:22,110 --> 02:54:22,630
I'm here!

5934
02:54:23,370 --> 02:54:23,770
Thanks.

5935
02:54:24,930 --> 02:54:25,510
Grab my hand!

5936
02:54:25,530 --> 02:54:26,710
I almost didn't make it.

5937
02:54:26,930 --> 02:54:27,690
There you go.

5938
02:54:28,250 --> 02:54:29,190
Yeah, we live!

5939
02:54:30,810 --> 02:54:31,410
We did it, guys!

5940
02:54:31,410 --> 02:54:32,770
Lots of food in this tree up here.

5941
02:54:32,950 --> 02:54:33,210
Yes!

5942
02:54:34,070 --> 02:54:34,590
Oh, uh-oh.

5943
02:54:34,590 --> 02:54:35,330
Huddle, huddle!

5944
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:36,670
This is not ideal.

5945
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:38,030
This is pretty bad, actually.

5946
02:54:38,470 --> 02:54:39,210
Huddling, huddling!

5947
02:54:39,690 --> 02:54:40,090
Stay here!

5948
02:54:40,190 --> 02:54:40,570
Stay here!

5949
02:54:40,690 --> 02:54:41,870
It doesn't hit here, too.

5950
02:54:42,130 --> 02:54:42,750
We're good here, too.

5951
02:54:42,910 --> 02:54:43,610
It's good here, too.

5952
02:54:44,150 --> 02:54:45,990
Get off of us, Stokey.

5953
02:54:46,170 --> 02:54:46,610
Wait, no, wait.

5954
02:54:47,530 --> 02:54:47,950
Wait, no, wait.

5955
02:54:47,950 --> 02:54:49,310
No, you guys can crouch boost me!

5956
02:54:49,770 --> 02:54:50,330
Crouch boost?

5957
02:54:50,330 --> 02:54:50,830
You can, actually.

5958
02:54:51,130 --> 02:54:51,470
If you jump on...

5959
02:54:51,470 --> 02:54:53,810
If you jump on each other's heads, you can just jump.

5960
02:54:54,850 --> 02:54:55,570
Boost Joby!

5961
02:54:56,970 --> 02:54:57,290
Go!

5962
02:54:57,350 --> 02:54:57,650
Go!

5963
02:54:58,910 --> 02:54:59,270
Go!

5964
02:54:59,470 --> 02:54:59,830
Go!

5965
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:02,110
Go!

5966
02:55:02,110 --> 02:55:02,170
Go!

5967
02:55:02,330 --> 02:55:02,690
Go!

5968
02:55:02,910 --> 02:55:03,210
Go!

5969
02:55:03,550 --> 02:55:03,670
Go!

5970
02:55:03,830 --> 02:55:03,890
Go!

5971
02:55:03,890 --> 02:55:03,930
Go!

5972
02:55:03,930 --> 02:55:05,170
How many people can be on a baton?

5973
02:55:05,630 --> 02:55:05,770
What?

5974
02:55:06,030 --> 02:55:08,570
For those rusty ones, I don't think you can both do it.

5975
02:55:12,130 --> 02:55:12,490
Nope.

5976
02:55:13,230 --> 02:55:13,770
Don't try!

5977
02:55:14,210 --> 02:55:14,570
Nope.

5978
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:16,470
Why didn't you...

5979
02:55:16,470 --> 02:55:17,650
How did you not make it?

5980
02:55:17,770 --> 02:55:18,270
Wait, I thought your energy...

5981
02:55:18,270 --> 02:55:20,670
I thought your energy comes back after.

5982
02:55:20,870 --> 02:55:21,530
I thought so, too.

5983
02:55:21,850 --> 02:55:23,430
You have to hold on to it for a little bit.

5984
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:24,430
I don't care about those special ones.

5985
02:55:24,930 --> 02:55:25,230
Oh!

5986
02:55:25,230 --> 02:55:25,370
Aww!

5987
02:55:26,970 --> 02:55:28,330
He has, like, so confused.

5988
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:29,330
Oh, oh, oh!

5989
02:55:29,330 --> 02:55:30,190
That- That funny!

5990
02:55:30,450 --> 02:55:31,290
You hold your head out!

5991
02:55:33,990 --> 02:55:34,390
Nope.

5992
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:35,030
Nope for me.

5993
02:55:35,390 --> 02:55:35,770
That's right.

5994
02:55:35,770 --> 02:55:35,990
That's right.

5995
02:55:36,070 --> 02:55:36,570
That's right!

5996
02:55:38,550 --> 02:55:40,130
Well, some of us...

5997
02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:40,610
Oh, my god!

5998
02:55:40,790 --> 02:55:41,390
Look at that frog!

5999
02:55:43,550 --> 02:55:44,750
Okay, I think I can...

6000
02:55:44,750 --> 02:55:45,070
Oh, god.

6001
02:55:45,210 --> 02:55:46,910
I think I can eat and maybe lift this up.

6002
02:55:47,770 --> 02:55:48,310
She's gone.

6003
02:55:48,450 --> 02:55:48,710
I eat.

6004
02:55:49,050 --> 02:55:51,350
Wait, this doesn't give you energy at all.

6005
02:55:52,170 --> 02:55:52,970
Like the...

6006
02:55:53,950 --> 02:55:54,850
Oh, it does.

6007
02:55:55,070 --> 02:55:56,330
Wait, this is bugged up.

6008
02:55:56,630 --> 02:55:57,170
Now it did.

6009
02:55:57,990 --> 02:55:58,470
Oh, weird.

6010
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:00,210
Wait, so you're good now?

6011
02:56:00,410 --> 02:56:00,690
Yeah.

6012
02:56:01,290 --> 02:56:01,910
Yeah, it's good.

6013
02:56:02,410 --> 02:56:03,010
Okay, I'll wait.

6014
02:56:03,390 --> 02:56:05,030
How are you not dying to the storm?

6015
02:56:06,090 --> 02:56:06,750
I got you.

6016
02:56:06,990 --> 02:56:08,750
I'm coming the same way as Doki!

6017
02:56:11,250 --> 02:56:11,730
Reach!

6018
02:56:13,450 --> 02:56:16,030
Oh, it collapsed!

6019
02:56:16,290 --> 02:56:16,530
It broke!

6020
02:56:17,430 --> 02:56:23,410
This fat ass is kept getting fed by everybody, and that's why it collapsed!

6021
02:56:26,950 --> 02:56:28,150
That's the fat.

6022
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:29,630
That's the fat.

6023
02:56:29,830 --> 02:56:29,930
That's the fat.

6024
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:31,830
It could not carry Doki Bird.

6025
02:56:32,410 --> 02:56:32,550
Ugh!

6026
02:56:36,950 --> 02:56:38,090
Okay, I try...

6027
02:56:38,090 --> 02:56:38,310
No!

6028
02:56:40,850 --> 02:56:41,530
Alive!

6029
02:56:45,880 --> 02:56:47,900
I'm sorry, it was a problem.

6030
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:48,600
Ah!

6031
02:56:48,780 --> 02:56:49,000
Stop!

6032
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:50,700
Reach out!

6033
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:51,160
Help!

6034
02:56:52,120 --> 02:56:52,380
No!

6035
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:55,120
I tried...

6036
02:56:55,120 --> 02:56:56,300
I tried to grab you.

6037
02:56:56,600 --> 02:56:57,120
It's okay.

6038
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:57,620
Okay.

6039
02:56:57,960 --> 02:56:58,680
My hand.

6040
02:56:58,800 --> 02:56:59,040
My hand.

6041
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:00,420
Oh my god.

6042
02:57:00,540 --> 02:57:01,800
We're so close.

6043
02:57:02,260 --> 02:57:02,860
We're so close.

6044
02:57:02,860 --> 02:57:04,340
Why are you leaving us?

6045
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,520
Why are you leaving us?

6046
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:07,400
That's not true.

6047
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:08,360
That's not true.

6048
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:10,460
I don't see if my hand was out.

6049
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:11,580
No, it wasn't.

6050
02:57:11,700 --> 02:57:12,220
No, it wasn't.

6051
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:13,740
I took the hand, that's all.

6052
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:15,940
There we go.

6053
02:57:16,440 --> 02:57:18,440
Sorry, I didn't know she was doing that.

6054
02:57:19,160 --> 02:57:19,980
What did I do?

6055
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:21,400
I think we go up here.

6056
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:23,460
We're going up this way.

6057
02:57:23,740 --> 02:57:25,060
What the fuck did I do?

6058
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:29,040
What do you really know I was doing?

6059
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:30,460
What did I even do?

6060
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:31,660
I don't even know what I was doing.

6061
02:57:31,660 --> 02:57:32,260
You're doing nothing.

6062
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:33,180
That's the issue.

6063
02:57:38,060 --> 02:57:39,700
Dude, there's so much blue rock.

6064
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:40,320
This is so sick.

6065
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:42,080
How did you even time that?

6066
02:57:42,140 --> 02:57:43,280
Does it freeze kill you?

6067
02:57:43,480 --> 02:57:44,860
I'm so tempted to touch it.

6068
02:57:45,740 --> 02:57:48,400
It's a little freeze like the snow.

6069
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:49,480
The same as the blizzard.

6070
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:50,960
Okay, okay.

6071
02:57:52,660 --> 02:57:53,620
Wait, I don't understand.

6072
02:57:53,620 --> 02:57:54,880
I can't get on top of that.

6073
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:58,840
I don't know.

6074
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:01,180
How come I let her on top of that?

6075
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:01,600
This rock?

6076
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:02,760
Right here?

6077
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:03,540
See you with you.

6078
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:06,760
I'm on top.

6079
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:07,540
Oh.

6080
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:08,880
Oh my goodness.

6081
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:09,500
No, no, no.

6082
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:10,200
No, no, no.

6083
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:11,240
No, no, no.

6084
02:58:12,020 --> 02:58:12,640
No, no, no.

6085
02:58:12,640 --> 02:58:13,320
See, I told you.

6086
02:58:14,460 --> 02:58:15,600
I'll push you off the lead.

6087
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:17,220
Oh, oh, please.

6088
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:18,940
Thank you.

6089
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:19,640
Thank you.

6090
02:58:20,900 --> 02:58:22,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

6091
02:58:22,240 --> 02:58:23,480
You took me down with you.

6092
02:58:25,420 --> 02:58:26,800
There's a baton here.

6093
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:27,620
Uh oh.

6094
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:28,620
Wait, I don't understand.

6095
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:30,040
I can't see the...

6096
02:58:30,040 --> 02:58:30,580
You can do it.

6097
02:58:30,580 --> 02:58:31,800
You can do it.

6098
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:33,920
Skill issue.

6099
02:58:34,260 --> 02:58:34,440
Did you get on it?

6100
02:58:34,660 --> 02:58:35,480
Skill issue.

6101
02:58:41,720 --> 02:58:43,560
Oh my god, you're pushing me off.

6102
02:58:43,720 --> 02:58:44,260
You're pushing me.

6103
02:58:44,460 --> 02:58:44,700
I'm on the now.

6104
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:45,480
You're pushing me off.

6105
02:58:45,580 --> 02:58:46,240
Wait for three!

6106
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:54,860
I'm on the now.

6107
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:56,100
Yay!

6108
02:58:57,260 --> 02:58:58,600
It makes the dream work.

6109
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:00,340
Where do we go now, Scoutmaster?

6110
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:01,920
I'm taking a look, hold on.

6111
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:03,300
She's taking a look.

6112
02:59:04,420 --> 02:59:05,500
We're going to take a look too.

6113
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:06,480
I'm taking a piss.

6114
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:11,640
At this whole situation... My god!

6115
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:12,980
My god!

6116
02:59:16,420 --> 02:59:16,820
She's dead.

6117
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:17,620
She's super dead.

6118
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:18,900
She's so far beyond dead.

6119
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:19,420
She's dead.

6120
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:20,220
She's dead.

6121
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:21,440
Did you push her down?

6122
02:59:27,820 --> 02:59:28,480
I got you.

6123
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:29,220
Where's Mim?

6124
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:31,500
She fell horribly far.

6125
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:33,040
She's far from God.

6126
02:59:33,300 --> 02:59:33,660
She is dead.

6127
02:59:34,540 --> 02:59:36,320
She like ricocheted so bad.

6128
02:59:36,460 --> 02:59:37,720
I don't even know what's happened.

6129
02:59:38,700 --> 02:59:39,920
Oh, there I am.

6130
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:40,680
I'm beneath.

6131
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:41,700
Oh, gosh.

6132
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:58,200
She was threatening you, but I think she was talking about Mint falling.

6133
02:59:58,440 --> 02:59:58,680
Hi!

6134
03:00:00,220 --> 03:00:00,820
Oh, hey!

6135
03:00:02,900 --> 03:00:04,020
Yeah, I died.

6136
03:00:04,980 --> 03:00:08,460
I fell, and then I ricocheted, and then I...

6137
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:09,680
Oh, no.

6138
03:00:10,980 --> 03:00:10,980
Oh, no.

6139
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:11,880
How did you die?

6140
03:00:12,340 --> 03:00:15,640
I fell, and then I, you know.

6141
03:00:16,260 --> 03:00:17,660
How did you fall?

6142
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:19,620
I don't think she had enough stamina.

6143
03:00:19,660 --> 03:00:20,900
Yeah, I didn't have enough stamina.

6144
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:22,320
Oh.

6145
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:24,820
You should have said, I had a little berry.

6146
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:25,840
I would have given it to you.

6147
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:26,420
I'm sorry.

6148
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:27,080
It's okay.

6149
03:00:27,440 --> 03:00:29,420
I wouldn't have given it to you, but I had it.

6150
03:00:29,660 --> 03:00:30,360
Yeah, I know you.

6151
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:30,880
Whatever.

6152
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:30,960
Whatever.

6153
03:00:34,180 --> 03:00:38,380
Wait, my arm is up here.

6154
03:00:41,360 --> 03:00:41,960
I'm here.

6155
03:00:42,300 --> 03:00:42,460
Hello.

6156
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:46,840
I'm here.

6157
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:48,020
We made it!

6158
03:00:48,500 --> 03:00:48,900
Wait, really?

6159
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:49,660
Where is it?

6160
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:50,220
We made it!

6161
03:00:50,360 --> 03:00:50,360
Wait, really?

6162
03:00:50,360 --> 03:00:50,360
Where is it?

6163
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:52,080
Just up here, I think.

6164
03:00:52,080 --> 03:00:54,760
Oh my god, we made it!

6165
03:00:55,960 --> 03:00:57,140
I was so close.

6166
03:00:57,280 --> 03:00:57,880
We're gamers!

6167
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:01,120
You practically are still here!

6168
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:02,200
Yeah, so true!

6169
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:02,920
So true!

6170
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:05,020
I was... I was.

6171
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:08,760
At least we didn't have the heartbreak of using Bongo again.

6172
03:01:09,320 --> 03:01:10,000
Yeah, here it is.

6173
03:01:10,040 --> 03:01:11,200
Because we already lost him.

6174
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:12,560
Yeah, we lost that guy.

6175
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:15,700
Yeah, somebody dropped him.

6176
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:17,820
I wonder who.

6177
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:19,500
I wonder who.

6178
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:23,600
Wait, what?

6179
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:25,000
I think it was actually me!

6180
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:30,620
Yay!

6181
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:32,100
We did it!

6182
03:01:32,240 --> 03:01:33,480
We lord of the prizes!

6183
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:35,000
Bring me back!

6184
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:35,800
Somebody!

6185
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:38,300
Bringing you back!

6186
03:01:38,820 --> 03:01:39,060
Thank you!

6187
03:01:46,920 --> 03:01:47,740
I'm back!

6188
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:48,420
I'll

6189
03:01:51,990 --> 03:01:53,890
put some stuff off.

6190
03:01:56,270 --> 03:01:57,410
Are you gonna take the backpack?

6191
03:01:58,710 --> 03:02:02,390
I don't trust you if you put stuff in my backpack.

6192
03:02:03,330 --> 03:02:04,270
Yeah, well...

6193
03:02:04,270 --> 03:02:06,310
Did you take my marshmallow too, huh?

6194
03:02:06,570 --> 03:02:08,570
There was only two marshmallows.

6195
03:02:08,930 --> 03:02:09,190
What?

6196
03:02:09,330 --> 03:02:09,490
Why?

6197
03:02:09,810 --> 03:02:10,750
Not even for me!

6198
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:11,830
I don't know why.

6199
03:02:12,310 --> 03:02:13,230
Yeah, there's only two.

6200
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:15,030
Snuffy, do you need food?

6201
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:16,310
I need food, yeah.

6202
03:02:16,330 --> 03:02:17,930
I have a little orange berry, I suppose.

6203
03:02:18,410 --> 03:02:19,190
Are you sure?

6204
03:02:19,510 --> 03:02:20,870
Because I'm fine, so if you need food.

6205
03:02:21,190 --> 03:02:21,230
I have snacks.

6206
03:02:21,430 --> 03:02:22,590
Wait, Snuffy, look in my backpack.

6207
03:02:22,850 --> 03:02:23,390
I have snacks in there.

6208
03:02:23,930 --> 03:02:24,130
Oh!

6209
03:02:24,130 --> 03:02:24,930
Oh, I'm taking your snacks.

6210
03:02:25,390 --> 03:02:25,990
Snack pack.

6211
03:02:26,210 --> 03:02:26,470
Come here!

6212
03:02:26,590 --> 03:02:27,690
I only had one snack.

6213
03:02:27,870 --> 03:02:28,190
Yeah!

6214
03:02:29,210 --> 03:02:29,830
Snack of snacks.

6215
03:02:29,830 --> 03:02:32,670
Okay, so this one is actually fully horizontal.

6216
03:02:32,890 --> 03:02:34,070
You see where the smoke is?

6217
03:02:34,210 --> 03:02:35,770
We gotta just navigate the lava...

6218
03:02:35,770 --> 03:02:36,930
Navigate the lava field.

6219
03:02:38,130 --> 03:02:38,890
Oh, wow.

6220
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:39,470
Snack break.

6221
03:02:39,870 --> 03:02:40,090
Snack.

6222
03:02:40,130 --> 03:02:41,430
At least there's no blizzard now.

6223
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:42,270
It's just lava.

6224
03:02:42,270 --> 03:02:43,650
Wait, but I can see the...

6225
03:02:43,650 --> 03:02:44,570
The fire.

6226
03:02:44,730 --> 03:02:45,370
The campfire.

6227
03:02:45,610 --> 03:02:46,490
Yeah, it's horizontal.

6228
03:02:46,770 --> 03:02:47,290
Yeah, it's...

6229
03:02:47,290 --> 03:02:48,530
You don't really go up on this one.

6230
03:02:48,550 --> 03:02:48,770
Oh, it's parkour!

6231
03:02:48,950 --> 03:02:49,890
It's literally parkour.

6232
03:02:50,110 --> 03:02:51,290
It's American Ninja Warrior.

6233
03:02:52,050 --> 03:02:52,870
Yeah, yeah.

6234
03:02:52,870 --> 03:02:52,990
Ninja Warrior.

6235
03:02:53,450 --> 03:02:55,190
Uh, I think we go left.

6236
03:02:55,950 --> 03:02:56,250
Okay.

6237
03:02:57,070 --> 03:02:57,430
Left?

6238
03:02:57,470 --> 03:02:57,950
This way?

6239
03:02:58,070 --> 03:02:59,450
Well, actually, that one's kinda far.

6240
03:02:59,710 --> 03:03:00,190
I don't know.

6241
03:03:00,510 --> 03:03:02,010
No, we kinda have to go this way, I think.

6242
03:03:02,350 --> 03:03:02,530
Oh.

6243
03:03:02,750 --> 03:03:03,690
I'm already committed.

6244
03:03:04,510 --> 03:03:06,190
Like this way, and then across here.

6245
03:03:06,650 --> 03:03:06,910
Okay.

6246
03:03:07,450 --> 03:03:08,330
Cause I don't think...

6247
03:03:08,330 --> 03:03:10,150
I mean, unless we take a little bit of toasty damage there.

6248
03:03:10,150 --> 03:03:12,070
What would you guys like to do?

6249
03:03:12,330 --> 03:03:12,770
Toast!

6250
03:03:12,970 --> 03:03:14,650
I would look in the stealth master level.

6251
03:03:15,490 --> 03:03:15,830
Oh, Christ.

6252
03:03:16,410 --> 03:03:16,670
Okay.

6253
03:03:16,950 --> 03:03:17,830
Uh, I'm...

6254
03:03:17,830 --> 03:03:18,970
What is she doing?

6255
03:03:19,390 --> 03:03:20,290
Oh, she's gone.

6256
03:03:20,570 --> 03:03:21,730
Oh, she's already gone.

6257
03:03:21,930 --> 03:03:22,150
Alright.

6258
03:03:22,930 --> 03:03:24,450
Uh, is there any trees in this...

6259
03:03:24,450 --> 03:03:24,990
Oh, shoot!

6260
03:03:25,210 --> 03:03:25,490
Ouch!

6261
03:03:25,970 --> 03:03:26,190
Ouch!

6262
03:03:27,030 --> 03:03:27,710
I'm fine!

6263
03:03:28,510 --> 03:03:28,950
Well...

6264
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:30,050
I'm fine as a...

6265
03:03:30,050 --> 03:03:30,230
Don't forget!

6266
03:03:30,390 --> 03:03:31,250
Oh my gosh, Mintz!

6267
03:03:31,290 --> 03:03:31,730
Don't forget!

6268
03:03:31,970 --> 03:03:35,090
If you turn around and grab the wall, you can slide down.

6269
03:03:35,110 --> 03:03:36,950
Yeah, I didn't think I was gonna fall.

6270
03:03:39,630 --> 03:03:40,310
You hurt!

6271
03:03:40,790 --> 03:03:41,130
You hurt!

6272
03:03:41,130 --> 03:03:41,810
You hurt so bad!

6273
03:03:43,470 --> 03:03:44,210
Oh my god!

6274
03:03:44,310 --> 03:03:45,350
What is this pillar of flame?

6275
03:03:45,930 --> 03:03:46,330
Whoa!

6276
03:03:46,630 --> 03:03:47,490
Yeah, these are scary.

6277
03:03:49,230 --> 03:03:51,470
I'm guessing there's no food in this area.

6278
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:54,710
Uh, there are, like, bird eggs around.

6279
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:55,270
Oh, okay, okay.

6280
03:03:56,670 --> 03:03:57,290
Oh, nice.

6281
03:03:57,610 --> 03:03:57,790
Yep.

6282
03:03:58,410 --> 03:03:59,290
I'm gonna die.

6283
03:03:59,530 --> 03:04:03,550
So with this one, you will sometimes take fire damage, but it, like, cools off.

6284
03:04:06,270 --> 03:04:06,670
Nice.

6285
03:04:06,930 --> 03:04:08,030
Is that the right way to go?

6286
03:04:10,270 --> 03:04:12,170
This is the only way.

6287
03:04:15,930 --> 03:04:17,190
This is actually my favorite map.

6288
03:04:17,290 --> 03:04:18,030
I like this one a lot.

6289
03:04:19,110 --> 03:04:19,510
Rest.

6290
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:20,170
There we go.

6291
03:04:20,830 --> 03:04:21,030
Go.

6292
03:04:21,590 --> 03:04:22,610
You're not clackward.

6293
03:04:23,490 --> 03:04:24,510
It's just parkour.

6294
03:04:24,930 --> 03:04:26,270
Oh, I don't have enough stamina!

6295
03:04:27,070 --> 03:04:27,290
Ah!

6296
03:04:27,550 --> 03:04:28,010
Thank you.

6297
03:04:28,830 --> 03:04:29,970
It's okay, we'll grip you.

6298
03:04:30,330 --> 03:04:31,350
We'll grip you for me.

6299
03:04:31,350 --> 03:04:32,170
Please carry me.

6300
03:04:32,470 --> 03:04:34,030
Princess, carry me the whole way.

6301
03:04:34,170 --> 03:04:34,370
Please.

6302
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:35,110
Don't forget to slide down.

6303
03:04:35,650 --> 03:04:36,050
Alright.

6304
03:04:36,990 --> 03:04:37,950
What do we do here?

6305
03:04:38,210 --> 03:04:38,330
Oh!

6306
03:04:38,710 --> 03:04:39,610
Wait, I didn't see what out...

6307
03:04:39,610 --> 03:04:40,230
What's this way?

6308
03:04:40,990 --> 03:04:41,650
The chain?

6309
03:04:42,190 --> 03:04:43,550
Yeah, you can climb the chain.

6310
03:04:43,630 --> 03:04:44,010
Just be careful.

6311
03:04:44,150 --> 03:04:45,650
If it's low, you might take fire damage.

6312
03:04:46,550 --> 03:04:47,690
Fire damage is okay.

6313
03:04:47,970 --> 03:04:48,530
It wears off.

6314
03:05:03,110 --> 03:05:04,030
I'm about to die.

6315
03:05:07,710 --> 03:05:08,270
Come on.

6316
03:05:08,410 --> 03:05:08,890
Oh, please.

6317
03:05:09,190 --> 03:05:10,130
Oh, I can't grip!

6318
03:05:11,130 --> 03:05:11,990
I can't grip!

6319
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:13,330
Oh, gosh!

6320
03:05:13,570 --> 03:05:14,230
They're nice and warm.

6321
03:05:14,470 --> 03:05:15,270
Oh, I'm gonna die!

6322
03:05:15,670 --> 03:05:16,410
I can't...

6323
03:05:16,410 --> 03:05:17,210
I have no stamina!

6324
03:05:17,470 --> 03:05:17,830
No, no, no, no!

6325
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:18,230
I have...

6326
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:25,750
I needed food!

6327
03:05:26,330 --> 03:05:27,130
But don't...

6328
03:05:27,130 --> 03:05:28,890
Nobody would give me food!

6329
03:05:31,290 --> 03:05:34,890
I think Snuffy just panic-tossed her backpack into the lava.

6330
03:05:35,090 --> 03:05:35,550
But that's okay.

6331
03:05:35,710 --> 03:05:36,330
That might happen.

6332
03:05:36,450 --> 03:05:37,550
What happened to her backpack?

6333
03:05:37,930 --> 03:05:39,730
What happened to her backpack?

6334
03:05:40,390 --> 03:05:41,850
I didn't have a backpack.

6335
03:05:42,370 --> 03:05:42,750
Did I?

6336
03:05:42,990 --> 03:05:44,090
I don't think so.

6337
03:05:47,230 --> 03:05:49,270
I got everything from my backpack.

6338
03:05:49,850 --> 03:05:50,290
Yay!

6339
03:05:50,790 --> 03:05:51,370
It's this way.

6340
03:05:51,410 --> 03:05:51,430
It's this way.

6341
03:05:51,430 --> 03:05:52,110
It's this way, Snuffy.

6342
03:05:52,470 --> 03:05:52,850
This way.

6343
03:05:53,290 --> 03:05:53,730
What?

6344
03:05:54,010 --> 03:05:54,970
Snuffy, turn around.

6345
03:05:55,110 --> 03:05:55,510
I don't...

6346
03:05:55,510 --> 03:05:57,150
You say this way, I don't even see you guys.

6347
03:05:57,330 --> 03:05:58,050
I don't know what you mean.

6348
03:05:58,250 --> 03:05:58,650
I'm alive!

6349
03:05:58,910 --> 03:05:59,170
You okay?

6350
03:05:59,850 --> 03:06:01,050
I have...

6351
03:06:01,050 --> 03:06:02,510
Does anyone have food?

6352
03:06:02,850 --> 03:06:04,270
Because I'm not gonna make it.

6353
03:06:04,610 --> 03:06:05,690
I don't have any food.

6354
03:06:05,690 --> 03:06:05,810
I do.

6355
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:06,810
You need to get over here though.

6356
03:06:06,970 --> 03:06:07,230
Okay.

6357
03:06:07,570 --> 03:06:07,810
I have food too.

6358
03:06:07,930 --> 03:06:09,030
Look at my nice water.

6359
03:06:09,030 --> 03:06:10,370
Just wash for those.

6360
03:06:10,630 --> 03:06:13,250
Wait, I'm letting the fire go down so I have more stamina.

6361
03:06:18,140 --> 03:06:19,540
You can go first.

6362
03:06:21,500 --> 03:06:22,280
I'm literally...

6363
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:23,660
This is gonna make me touch lava.

6364
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:24,740
That was killing me.

6365
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:25,720
Oh!

6366
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:26,200
I'm dead.

6367
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:27,320
GG!

6368
03:06:27,820 --> 03:06:28,220
No!

6369
03:06:28,920 --> 03:06:29,140
No!

6370
03:06:30,100 --> 03:06:30,260
No!

6371
03:06:34,430 --> 03:06:34,870
Snuffy!

6372
03:06:35,890 --> 03:06:36,290
Ouch!

6373
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:37,150
Ouch!

6374
03:06:37,610 --> 03:06:37,810
Ouch!

6375
03:06:37,810 --> 03:06:38,290
Ouch!

6376
03:06:38,770 --> 03:06:39,330
Ouch!

6377
03:06:39,870 --> 03:06:40,090
Ouch!

6378
03:06:41,390 --> 03:06:42,410
I pressed E!

6379
03:06:42,670 --> 03:06:43,570
I pressed E!

6380
03:06:44,990 --> 03:06:46,390
I pressed E!

6381
03:06:50,190 --> 03:06:51,550
I should have thumbs up.

6382
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:52,830
Do do do do do do.

6383
03:06:53,210 --> 03:06:54,610
Do do do do do do do.

6384
03:06:54,810 --> 03:06:56,090
Why are you doing this?

6385
03:06:56,730 --> 03:06:58,410
You can't feel it.

6386
03:06:58,550 --> 03:07:00,370
Oh, it's because I have the stamina.

6387
03:07:01,030 --> 03:07:01,590
Oh, that's why.

6388
03:07:12,890 --> 03:07:14,510
I had to leave, though.

6389
03:07:14,630 --> 03:07:15,550
I was getting burned.

6390
03:07:17,670 --> 03:07:18,570
I had to.

6391
03:07:18,890 --> 03:07:19,630
I had to.

6392
03:07:20,110 --> 03:07:21,470
You could have waited.

6393
03:07:22,010 --> 03:07:22,970
Waited for what?

6394
03:07:23,450 --> 03:07:24,090
No.

6395
03:07:24,390 --> 03:07:25,790
I'm defending my honor.

6396
03:07:26,150 --> 03:07:27,830
I'm defending my honor.

6397
03:07:27,950 --> 03:07:28,990
Waited for what?

6398
03:07:29,210 --> 03:07:30,850
I was literally on fire.

6399
03:07:31,590 --> 03:07:34,290
I was waiting for the lava to cool the

6400
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:42,040
high tide.

6401
03:07:43,340 --> 03:07:44,980
Oh, I didn't know that.

6402
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:46,860
What do you mean?

6403
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:49,360
I

6404
03:07:53,130 --> 03:07:55,210
didn't actually know that either.

6405
03:07:55,550 --> 03:07:56,830
I didn't know it goes up and down.

6406
03:07:56,850 --> 03:07:57,670
Yeah, it goes down.

6407
03:07:57,670 --> 03:07:58,110
I saw you guys.

6408
03:07:58,270 --> 03:07:59,430
I was like, oh, well, they made it.

6409
03:07:59,550 --> 03:07:59,990
Sorry.

6410
03:08:00,810 --> 03:08:00,810
Yeah.

6411
03:08:01,630 --> 03:08:04,030
I saw the lava go up.

6412
03:08:04,370 --> 03:08:06,250
Well, how were we supposed to see it?

6413
03:08:06,330 --> 03:08:07,330
I was literally dead.

6414
03:08:08,010 --> 03:08:08,390
Look at your eyes.

6415
03:08:08,710 --> 03:08:10,190
The eyes tell you.

6416
03:08:12,030 --> 03:08:13,250
We'll have to wait for this one.

6417
03:08:13,350 --> 03:08:14,070
I think it's about to catch fire.

6418
03:08:14,250 --> 03:08:15,330
I'm rooting for your death, Doki.

6419
03:08:15,450 --> 03:08:17,990
In fact, I'm going to block your vision the entire time.

6420
03:08:18,190 --> 03:08:20,410
Yeah, you wish you had this lollipop.

6421
03:08:20,490 --> 03:08:23,090
I don't care about your fucking lollipop.

6422
03:08:23,530 --> 03:08:25,210
You still have that.

6423
03:08:27,030 --> 03:08:30,570
Min's was literally begging for anybody to feed her so she could make it.

6424
03:08:30,570 --> 03:08:30,610
I know.

6425
03:08:30,730 --> 03:08:31,930
And you wouldn't feed me.

6426
03:08:31,990 --> 03:08:36,670
No, I was like, I was like, wait, if you make it here, I can give you this lolly, this marshmallow.

6427
03:08:36,750 --> 03:08:38,070
You didn't say that shit.

6428
03:08:38,830 --> 03:08:39,810
Yes, I did.

6429
03:08:40,030 --> 03:08:42,930
I have this marshmallow that I can give you.

6430
03:08:43,110 --> 03:08:46,770
Oh, the marshmallow that you stole because Snuffy and I didn't get one?

6431
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:49,010
Oh, I got there before you.

6432
03:08:49,350 --> 03:08:50,450
I was dead.

6433
03:08:51,630 --> 03:08:51,830
I was dead!

6434
03:08:51,830 --> 03:08:52,330
Well, too bad.

6435
03:08:52,670 --> 03:08:53,810
I'm going to kill you.

6436
03:08:53,870 --> 03:08:57,050
I'm going to kill you again.

6437
03:08:57,510 --> 03:08:59,030
I'm going to kill you.

6438
03:08:59,050 --> 03:08:59,490
You won't.

6439
03:08:59,630 --> 03:08:59,950
Come on.

6440
03:08:59,970 --> 03:09:00,750
Why aren't you going?

6441
03:09:00,910 --> 03:09:01,410
Why aren't you going?

6442
03:09:01,550 --> 03:09:02,490
Baby Doki, come on.

6443
03:09:02,770 --> 03:09:03,170
Look.

6444
03:09:03,170 --> 03:09:04,830
I just think it catches on fire.

6445
03:09:05,130 --> 03:09:05,830
Look how fast!

6446
03:09:05,830 --> 03:09:10,630
Look how fast Laimoo is going to get pushed off the mountain from the guy.

6447
03:09:11,390 --> 03:09:13,470
No, she's because you're so slow.

6448
03:09:14,310 --> 03:09:15,330
No, I'm waiting for it.

6449
03:09:15,410 --> 03:09:16,550
Look, look, it's going to catch up.

6450
03:09:16,670 --> 03:09:17,230
Oh my gosh.

6451
03:09:17,410 --> 03:09:18,010
Oh my gosh.

6452
03:09:18,110 --> 03:09:19,250
That's going to catch on fire.

6453
03:09:19,390 --> 03:09:22,750
That's because you took too long and the god is angry.

6454
03:09:23,770 --> 03:09:24,610
No, it's fine.

6455
03:09:24,950 --> 03:09:25,490
No, it's not.

6456
03:09:26,310 --> 03:09:27,130
Yes, it is.

6457
03:09:27,270 --> 03:09:27,890
It's fine.

6458
03:09:28,110 --> 03:09:29,870
I'm going to wait until this catches on fire.

6459
03:09:29,890 --> 03:09:30,910
I don't think it will.

6460
03:09:31,410 --> 03:09:32,590
Yes, it will.

6461
03:09:32,830 --> 03:09:33,090
Yes, it will.

6462
03:09:33,090 --> 03:09:33,970
I feel like Doki is literally on fire.

6463
03:09:33,970 --> 03:09:35,570
Oh wow, that's really on fire.

6464
03:09:36,070 --> 03:09:37,270
Are you okay, Laimoo?

6465
03:09:38,110 --> 03:09:40,110
The whole fucking thing is catching fire.

6466
03:09:40,830 --> 03:09:42,430
Is Doki going to make it?

6467
03:09:42,590 --> 03:09:43,590
Will it stop being on fire?

6468
03:09:43,590 --> 03:09:44,310
I don't know.

6469
03:09:44,850 --> 03:09:47,390
She was so busy arguing with you, she didn't move.

6470
03:09:47,730 --> 03:09:48,150
I know.

6471
03:09:48,370 --> 03:09:49,710
I kept telling her to go.

6472
03:09:53,110 --> 03:09:54,650
Okay, stop being on fire.

6473
03:10:23,230 --> 03:10:24,630
Death.

6474
03:10:24,630 --> 03:10:25,510
Holy shit.

6475
03:10:27,930 --> 03:10:29,570
Are you guys good?

6476
03:10:31,830 --> 03:10:33,910
That's a fucking deed in here.

6477
03:10:34,690 --> 03:10:36,570
Death, die, die, die.

6478
03:10:36,850 --> 03:10:38,750
I wonder if that was what she was shouting.

6479
03:10:39,310 --> 03:10:39,790
Death, death.

6480
03:10:43,530 --> 03:10:48,170
Even though her death wasn't even my fault.

6481
03:10:48,830 --> 03:10:50,470
I was starving.

6482
03:10:50,910 --> 03:10:54,450
I needed energy and I had none and nobody gave me any.

6483
03:10:55,630 --> 03:10:59,650
I nearly said, hey, if you make it through, if you make it, I can give you my mind spell.

6484
03:10:59,650 --> 03:11:01,250
I needed it before then.

6485
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:03,510
That's what I said.

6486
03:11:03,830 --> 03:11:05,630
I needed it to make it through.

6487
03:11:05,990 --> 03:11:07,450
I did not know you needed it before.

6488
03:11:09,650 --> 03:11:12,330
Death, die, die, death, death, die.

6489
03:11:12,610 --> 03:11:15,710
You have to give her the lollipop though.

6490
03:11:18,570 --> 03:11:21,290
She would rather die than give her the lollipop.

6491
03:11:32,180 --> 03:11:33,020
It worked.

6492
03:11:33,240 --> 03:11:35,540
Oh, you should have just waited until it receded.

6493
03:11:36,460 --> 03:11:38,020
Oh, Doki, why didn't you wait?

6494
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:38,840
Doki, you were going down.

6495
03:11:38,860 --> 03:11:41,300
Yeah, why didn't you wait until the lava went down?

6496
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:42,040
Doki.

6497
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:43,160
Gosh, Doki.

6498
03:11:47,450 --> 03:11:49,150
Do you see the face I'm making right now?

6499
03:11:49,150 --> 03:11:50,110
Yeah, I do.

6500
03:11:50,250 --> 03:11:50,810
It's so good.

6501
03:11:51,050 --> 03:11:51,350
Ow!

6502
03:11:51,670 --> 03:11:55,390
Maybe because like someone kept yelling, die, die, die, die.

6503
03:11:55,910 --> 03:11:59,330
That was a fake connection through the lava.

6504
03:11:59,650 --> 03:12:01,370
That was clearly not...

6505
03:12:01,370 --> 03:12:02,450
You shouldn't... What do you mean?

6506
03:12:02,570 --> 03:12:05,970
You're supposed to use your eyes and wait for it to go back down.

6507
03:12:06,650 --> 03:12:07,210
What?

6508
03:12:07,830 --> 03:12:08,830
You didn't know?

6509
03:12:09,450 --> 03:12:10,590
I said it.

6510
03:12:10,730 --> 03:12:14,330
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

6511
03:12:14,630 --> 03:12:15,190
It worked.

6512
03:12:15,550 --> 03:12:15,990
It worked.

6513
03:12:19,290 --> 03:12:22,750
You manifested the downfall of a fellow scout member.

6514
03:12:22,850 --> 03:12:23,730
I hope you get a badge.

6515
03:12:25,430 --> 03:12:28,750
I'm pretty sure... Is that going to actually like catch on fire?

6516
03:12:28,950 --> 03:12:29,410
I don't know.

6517
03:12:29,450 --> 03:12:30,190
I can't tell.

6518
03:12:30,610 --> 03:12:32,190
I think it's just because it's high right now.

6519
03:12:32,190 --> 03:12:32,870
Yeah.

6520
03:12:33,670 --> 03:12:34,310
Nice.

6521
03:12:34,630 --> 03:12:35,850
You can just climb up.

6522
03:12:36,410 --> 03:12:38,130
Climb, climb, climb, climb, climb.

6523
03:12:38,590 --> 03:12:40,870
Oh, now you're not going to say die.

6524
03:12:42,610 --> 03:12:43,210
Yay!

6525
03:12:46,990 --> 03:12:48,630
It's called being a team player.

6526
03:12:49,350 --> 03:12:50,150
Oh, yeah.

6527
03:12:50,330 --> 03:12:52,670
You're the best team player out there.

6528
03:12:53,130 --> 03:12:54,570
That's for sure.

6529
03:12:57,410 --> 03:13:01,250
Literally, you are definitely not rooting for anybody's demise.

6530
03:13:01,250 --> 03:13:01,930
No!

6531
03:13:02,790 --> 03:13:04,930
I'm rooting for Lymu all the way.

6532
03:13:05,850 --> 03:13:06,370
Yay!

6533
03:13:06,790 --> 03:13:07,050
Yay!

6534
03:13:07,710 --> 03:13:08,090
Teamwork!

6535
03:13:08,530 --> 03:13:08,970
Supportive friends!

6536
03:13:08,970 --> 03:13:10,450
There's only three marshmallows.

6537
03:13:10,590 --> 03:13:11,530
No, there's four.

6538
03:13:11,810 --> 03:13:13,490
There... I can see them with my eyes!

6539
03:13:14,730 --> 03:13:16,050
Die, die, die.

6540
03:13:16,570 --> 03:13:17,690
Die, die, die.

6541
03:13:18,190 --> 03:13:18,670
Die, die, die.

6542
03:13:18,670 --> 03:13:19,070
Die, die, die.

6543
03:13:19,350 --> 03:13:19,450
Die, die.

6544
03:13:19,450 --> 03:13:19,910
Welcome back.

6545
03:13:20,770 --> 03:13:21,230
Thanks.

6546
03:13:24,470 --> 03:13:25,250
Time to make...

6547
03:13:25,870 --> 03:13:28,810
Quickly take all the loot before Doki eats it all.

6548
03:13:28,950 --> 03:13:29,290
I know.

6549
03:13:29,690 --> 03:13:31,010
Look what I got, guys.

6550
03:13:32,230 --> 03:13:33,230
Oh, my God.

6551
03:13:33,530 --> 03:13:34,330
You got it back.

6552
03:13:36,330 --> 03:13:37,310
Oh, my God.

6553
03:13:38,010 --> 03:13:38,290
Never.

6554
03:13:38,410 --> 03:13:39,650
Never punished.

6555
03:13:39,750 --> 03:13:42,010
I got my lollipop back.

6556
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:42,310
Wait.

6557
03:13:42,530 --> 03:13:43,490
Oh, I want this instead.

6558
03:13:45,490 --> 03:13:45,970
Wait.

6559
03:13:46,570 --> 03:13:47,130
No lollipop.

6560
03:13:48,530 --> 03:13:50,050
No lollipop for you.

6561
03:13:51,410 --> 03:13:53,630
Look, the lollipop got res too, guys.

6562
03:13:54,770 --> 03:13:55,110
Oh, wait.

6563
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:55,950
I can just do this.

6564
03:13:56,270 --> 03:13:57,670
Do we have any climbing items?

6565
03:13:58,050 --> 03:13:59,090
Does anyone have a sports drink?

6566
03:13:59,170 --> 03:14:00,010
I have rope and...

6567
03:14:00,610 --> 03:14:01,810
Oh, I don't have sports drink.

6568
03:14:02,050 --> 03:14:02,870
I have an energy drink.

6569
03:14:02,950 --> 03:14:03,350
Oh, there's one.

6570
03:14:03,490 --> 03:14:03,690
Hold on.

6571
03:14:04,130 --> 03:14:04,990
That's an energy drink.

6572
03:14:05,030 --> 03:14:05,270
That's all I have.

6573
03:14:05,350 --> 03:14:05,910
Oh, just kidding.

6574
03:14:08,150 --> 03:14:08,830
That's kind of what I wanted.

6575
03:14:08,910 --> 03:14:09,070
Sorry.

6576
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:10,230
I meant an energy drink.

6577
03:14:10,250 --> 03:14:10,630
Oh, okay.

6578
03:14:10,630 --> 03:14:10,670
Okay.

6579
03:14:11,330 --> 03:14:11,770
Alright.

6580
03:14:12,150 --> 03:14:12,550
Let's...

6581
03:14:12,550 --> 03:14:13,210
I'm ready.

6582
03:14:13,410 --> 03:14:13,910
I'm ready.

6583
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:14,750
I'm ready.

6584
03:14:17,310 --> 03:14:19,430
We're going into the depths of hell.

6585
03:14:20,010 --> 03:14:20,850
I'm ready.

6586
03:14:20,990 --> 03:14:21,550
Let's go.

6587
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:22,970
Let's go into the hall.

6588
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:24,190
Steps of hell.

6589
03:14:25,330 --> 03:14:25,570
Yeah.

6590
03:14:26,290 --> 03:14:26,730
Hooray.

6591
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:30,090
I hope Scout Master is smiling down upon us.

6592
03:14:30,550 --> 03:14:34,290
I hope Scout Master is going to be so proud of us.

6593
03:14:38,250 --> 03:14:40,670
You look so proud, Laimu.

6594
03:14:41,010 --> 03:14:41,550
Oh, uh-oh.

6595
03:14:43,730 --> 03:14:45,050
My game lagged.

6596
03:14:45,230 --> 03:14:45,810
Oh gosh.

6597
03:14:46,210 --> 03:14:46,610
Let's go.

6598
03:14:46,830 --> 03:14:47,830
Oh yeah, no, don't say that.

6599
03:14:47,830 --> 03:14:49,610
This area is laggy as hell.

6600
03:14:54,950 --> 03:14:55,470
What?!

6601
03:14:55,470 --> 03:14:55,710
Yeah!

6602
03:14:56,870 --> 03:15:03,050
You have to pay the troll toll to get inside the boys' hole.

6603
03:15:04,170 --> 03:15:04,710
What?

6604
03:15:05,450 --> 03:15:08,690
I don't think anybody has ever said that to me, but you just said it in tandem.

6605
03:15:10,670 --> 03:15:13,550
Oh, you never heard of the critically acclaimed musical?

6606
03:15:16,810 --> 03:15:17,350
Dayman!

6607
03:15:17,350 --> 03:15:17,890
Ahhhh!

6608
03:15:20,590 --> 03:15:21,130
Dayman!

6609
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:22,710
Ahhhh!

6610
03:15:22,710 --> 03:15:23,430
AAAAAH!

6611
03:15:33,360 --> 03:15:43,720
FIGHTER OF THE NIGHT NOW CHAMPION OF THE SUN HE IS THE PROTECTOR OF FRIENDSHYPING TO EVERYONE

6612
03:15:47,940 --> 03:15:50,260
This is the last map.

6613
03:15:50,320 --> 03:15:54,000
Can you imagine if you guys finished Peak on your second run-through ever?

6614
03:15:54,360 --> 03:15:54,960
Oh my god.

6615
03:15:55,660 --> 03:15:56,720
That would be crazy.

6616
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:58,200
Wait, I'm scared.

6617
03:15:58,360 --> 03:15:59,020
Don't jinx it.

6618
03:15:59,160 --> 03:15:59,780
Don't jinx it.

6619
03:16:01,400 --> 03:16:02,540
I want to live.

6620
03:16:04,280 --> 03:16:05,680
I'll be good.

6621
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,340
I'll be good.

6622
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:08,800
I swear.

6623
03:16:10,060 --> 03:16:11,720
The killin'?

6624
03:16:11,720 --> 03:16:13,520
The killin'.

6625
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:14,660
You mean killin'?

6626
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:17,940
You say that again?

6627
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:20,180
I thought it was like, I'm killin' you.

6628
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:22,700
Killin' it.

6629
03:16:24,140 --> 03:16:25,860
And now it really begins.

6630
03:16:25,900 --> 03:16:28,140
The killin'.

6631
03:16:28,140 --> 03:16:30,380
The left looks kinda weird.

6632
03:16:30,680 --> 03:16:32,440
What's the gimmick here?

6633
03:16:32,720 --> 03:16:33,960
Is it also catch on fire?

6634
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:37,000
No, it's just hard.

6635
03:16:37,360 --> 03:16:40,620
Like, the pathway that it gives you is hard and sometimes it's like...

6636
03:16:40,620 --> 03:16:42,800
You can't really do it very well without items.

6637
03:16:43,420 --> 03:16:43,780
Okay.

6638
03:16:44,800 --> 03:16:47,580
Yeah, you can run out of items to climb this.

6639
03:16:48,060 --> 03:16:48,940
We're just following line.

6640
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:51,880
Yeah, so it's kind of like more of a, did you do well the rest of the game check?

6641
03:16:52,160 --> 03:16:52,740
Which, uh...

6642
03:16:58,480 --> 03:16:59,980
That scares me.

6643
03:17:03,500 --> 03:17:05,780
If I die... the Lollipop dies with me.

6644
03:17:05,980 --> 03:17:07,540
Wait, where did... where did Limeo go?

6645
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:08,140
You okay?

6646
03:17:09,040 --> 03:17:11,420
Yeah, we're just looking at the different...

6647
03:17:11,420 --> 03:17:11,420
paths.

6648
03:17:11,620 --> 03:17:12,420
I don't know where she went.

6649
03:17:12,620 --> 03:17:13,280
She's behind us.

6650
03:17:13,280 --> 03:17:14,160
She's right here.

6651
03:17:15,500 --> 03:17:16,160
Thank you.

6652
03:17:16,400 --> 03:17:16,720
Okay.

6653
03:17:22,880 --> 03:17:24,300
Wait, how did you get up there?

6654
03:17:24,500 --> 03:17:25,420
Actually, I don't know at all.

6655
03:17:25,580 --> 03:17:26,100
I don't know.

6656
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:28,280
Okay.

6657
03:17:28,960 --> 03:17:30,880
I'm just by... I'm just going by by.

6658
03:17:31,180 --> 03:17:31,800
Oh, she's going.

6659
03:17:34,520 --> 03:17:37,340
It's a little bumpy, but I guess we can just...

6660
03:17:37,340 --> 03:17:37,600
Oh, oh.

6661
03:17:37,980 --> 03:17:38,260
Okay.

6662
03:17:38,960 --> 03:17:39,460
Oh, oh.

6663
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:40,360
Thank you.

6664
03:17:41,420 --> 03:17:42,160
You got it?

6665
03:17:42,220 --> 03:17:42,360
Okay.

6666
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:42,920
Here.

6667
03:17:43,160 --> 03:17:43,540
I'm here.

6668
03:17:44,680 --> 03:17:45,160
Nice.

6669
03:17:47,580 --> 03:17:48,320
Thank you.

6670
03:17:49,500 --> 03:17:50,360
You're welcome.

6671
03:17:53,440 --> 03:17:54,680
Where are we going now?

6672
03:17:54,860 --> 03:17:55,920
I think up here, maybe?

6673
03:17:56,280 --> 03:17:56,780
This way?

6674
03:17:57,720 --> 03:17:58,040
Okay.

6675
03:17:59,060 --> 03:18:01,520
We're going up, up, up, up, up, baby.

6676
03:18:02,200 --> 03:18:02,280
Oh.

6677
03:18:03,120 --> 03:18:03,640
Oh, you're good.

6678
03:18:03,640 --> 03:18:06,740
Right side looks like it gets openings that we won't be able to cross.

6679
03:18:07,100 --> 03:18:07,840
It's hard.

6680
03:18:08,300 --> 03:18:08,580
Yeah.

6681
03:18:09,200 --> 03:18:09,840
This is crazy.

6682
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:10,640
Yeah.

6683
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:10,700
Yeah.

6684
03:18:11,440 --> 03:18:13,420
If you've seen a good pathway, let me know, Snuffy.

6685
03:18:13,420 --> 03:18:13,900
Oh my gosh.

6686
03:18:13,900 --> 03:18:14,420
If you look.

6687
03:18:14,860 --> 03:18:16,880
I don't even know what a pathway is.

6688
03:18:17,020 --> 03:18:17,620
I think it's mostly the left.

6689
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:20,180
It has a lot of good laying.

6690
03:18:20,980 --> 03:18:23,180
But the right area is just like empty darkness.

6691
03:18:24,440 --> 03:18:24,800
Yeah.

6692
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:25,040
Yeah.

6693
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:25,300
Whoa.

6694
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:27,340
Oh my god.

6695
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:27,800
Oh my god.

6696
03:18:27,940 --> 03:18:28,260
Oh my god.

6697
03:18:28,360 --> 03:18:29,520
Well, I almost didn't make that.

6698
03:18:30,560 --> 03:18:31,320
Oh, thank you.

6699
03:18:31,880 --> 03:18:32,740
I think so.

6700
03:18:32,980 --> 03:18:36,820
So the other thing about the kiln is because there's no food in here, you kind of just need to like.

6701
03:18:37,120 --> 03:18:37,520
Oh.

6702
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:39,280
Book it a little bit.

6703
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:39,700
Okay.

6704
03:18:39,860 --> 03:18:40,260
Going up.

6705
03:18:40,540 --> 03:18:42,240
I think we need to get to here somehow.

6706
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:42,780
Yeah.

6707
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:43,640
Going up.

6708
03:18:44,480 --> 03:18:45,380
She going up.

6709
03:18:46,040 --> 03:18:47,120
It did not work out.

6710
03:18:47,340 --> 03:18:47,700
Oh.

6711
03:18:47,820 --> 03:18:48,660
It does not look good though.

6712
03:18:49,060 --> 03:18:49,440
I'm grabbing you.

6713
03:18:49,440 --> 03:18:49,920
You okay, Snuffy?

6714
03:18:50,100 --> 03:18:50,800
I caught you.

6715
03:18:51,260 --> 03:18:51,740
Yeah, I got you.

6716
03:18:52,780 --> 03:18:53,500
I got you too.

6717
03:18:53,640 --> 03:18:53,940
Okay.

6718
03:18:54,560 --> 03:18:55,480
I got her more.

6719
03:18:56,800 --> 03:18:57,240
Yeah.

6720
03:18:59,360 --> 03:19:00,460
You can stop here.

6721
03:19:00,820 --> 03:19:01,620
For, for...

6722
03:19:01,620 --> 03:19:01,840
Stamina.

6723
03:19:03,780 --> 03:19:04,220
Yay.

6724
03:19:04,220 --> 03:19:04,300
Okay.

6725
03:19:04,440 --> 03:19:05,160
There's a place here too.

6726
03:19:05,720 --> 03:19:05,980
Okay.

6727
03:19:06,860 --> 03:19:07,260
I'm here.

6728
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:10,660
I think this place amplifies the sound of my growling stomach.

6729
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:11,400
Oh, thanks.

6730
03:19:11,400 --> 03:19:11,880
Oh, are you hungry?

6731
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:13,600
I'm a little hungry.

6732
03:19:13,780 --> 03:19:14,280
Oh, crap!

6733
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:16,320
Uh, a little bit stuck.

6734
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:16,840
A little bit stuck.

6735
03:19:16,840 --> 03:19:17,160
A little bit stuck.

6736
03:19:17,280 --> 03:19:17,540
Oh gosh.

6737
03:19:17,800 --> 03:19:19,300
There's so many of us here.

6738
03:19:19,480 --> 03:19:20,020
Thank you.

6739
03:19:20,900 --> 03:19:22,200
I don't pull you guys out.

6740
03:19:22,300 --> 03:19:22,800
Come on.

6741
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:23,440
Come on.

6742
03:19:23,440 --> 03:19:24,200
Doki!

6743
03:19:24,780 --> 03:19:25,300
Doki!

6744
03:19:25,660 --> 03:19:25,900
Doki!

6745
03:19:25,980 --> 03:19:26,500
Doki!

6746
03:19:26,720 --> 03:19:26,800
Doki!

6747
03:19:26,800 --> 03:19:27,460
Oh no.

6748
03:19:27,760 --> 03:19:29,220
Doki merged with the wall.

6749
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:30,000
Wait.

6750
03:19:30,540 --> 03:19:31,820
What's going on?

6751
03:19:32,420 --> 03:19:32,940
What?

6752
03:19:33,560 --> 03:19:36,380
Doki, you need to separate from that surface a little bit.

6753
03:19:36,480 --> 03:19:38,340
So try and drop down a little, then come back up.

6754
03:19:38,440 --> 03:19:38,640
You're stuck in the wall.

6755
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:38,720
Come on, Doki.

6756
03:19:38,880 --> 03:19:39,880
We're out of rush.

6757
03:19:40,220 --> 03:19:41,460
We gotta get up there.

6758
03:19:44,660 --> 03:19:45,700
Oh no.

6759
03:19:46,760 --> 03:19:48,140
She's just panicking.

6760
03:19:49,800 --> 03:19:51,640
Stop showing off, Doki.

6761
03:19:51,780 --> 03:19:52,200
Come on.

6762
03:19:54,840 --> 03:19:56,420
I can't get out!

6763
03:19:57,340 --> 03:19:57,820
Water!

6764
03:19:58,080 --> 03:19:58,220
Pull!

6765
03:19:58,420 --> 03:19:59,200
You guys gotta pull!

6766
03:20:00,860 --> 03:20:03,400
Your limit's stuck in the wall.

6767
03:20:03,540 --> 03:20:05,600
You gotta move away from the whole thing if you can.

6768
03:20:06,060 --> 03:20:07,500
Like, drop down a bit.

6769
03:20:08,300 --> 03:20:09,460
Is it fully gone?

6770
03:20:10,200 --> 03:20:11,040
I don't know.

6771
03:20:11,180 --> 03:20:11,820
Are you good now?

6772
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:13,160
I don't know.

6773
03:20:13,780 --> 03:20:14,480
Am I?

6774
03:20:15,520 --> 03:20:16,440
Are you good?

6775
03:20:16,800 --> 03:20:17,420
You look better.

6776
03:20:17,740 --> 03:20:18,220
That looks better.

6777
03:20:18,720 --> 03:20:19,580
Am I better now?

6778
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:20,400
Yeah.

6779
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:21,640
Try to come back up now.

6780
03:20:21,940 --> 03:20:22,300
Yeah, yeah.

6781
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:25,040
Oh no.

6782
03:20:30,850 --> 03:20:33,310
Do you have any items you can pick up?

6783
03:20:33,430 --> 03:20:34,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

6784
03:20:34,670 --> 03:20:35,370
Do you have an item?

6785
03:20:35,630 --> 03:20:37,170
Hold an item, it should fix you.

6786
03:20:38,710 --> 03:20:40,050
Hold an item, it'll fix you!

6787
03:20:40,050 --> 03:20:40,190
Hold an item, it'll fix you!

6788
03:20:42,060 --> 03:20:42,780
Okay, okay.

6789
03:20:42,780 --> 03:20:43,860
Oh wait, how did you get up there?

6790
03:20:45,240 --> 03:20:45,580
Okay.

6791
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:47,340
Am I okay?

6792
03:20:48,400 --> 03:20:48,860
No.

6793
03:20:50,260 --> 03:20:51,200
Oh, whoa, whoa!

6794
03:20:51,560 --> 03:20:52,900
Oh, this catches on fire.

6795
03:20:53,100 --> 03:20:53,420
Oh my gosh.

6796
03:20:53,600 --> 03:20:53,860
Sting!

6797
03:20:54,800 --> 03:20:55,260
Sting!

6798
03:20:55,500 --> 03:20:56,880
What did you do to me?

6799
03:20:57,180 --> 03:20:58,120
I don't know.

6800
03:20:58,720 --> 03:20:59,920
What did you do to me?

6801
03:20:59,920 --> 03:21:00,320
Guys!

6802
03:21:00,940 --> 03:21:03,720
Dogey, have you ever seen the movie 127 Hours?

6803
03:21:05,180 --> 03:21:06,540
Oh look, you picked yourself, good job.

6804
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:10,360
Oh my god, you made it!

6805
03:21:10,640 --> 03:21:11,280
There's like...

6806
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:12,380
Is there anything up here?

6807
03:21:14,700 --> 03:21:18,540
So I think we're gonna have to try our best to climb on each other's heads and get up here maybe.

6808
03:21:19,160 --> 03:21:19,320
Oh.

6809
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:21,480
Or we take a very big leap over there.

6810
03:21:23,400 --> 03:21:24,180
Don't trust me.

6811
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:26,260
Don't get on my head, get on my head.

6812
03:21:26,260 --> 03:21:28,420
That is a big one, that is a really big one.

6813
03:21:28,600 --> 03:21:29,080
Get on my head.

6814
03:21:29,100 --> 03:21:29,820
Oh my lollipop.

6815
03:21:30,320 --> 03:21:32,060
Wait, wait, why don't we just jump here?

6816
03:21:32,840 --> 03:21:33,300
Which one?

6817
03:21:33,980 --> 03:21:34,280
Whoa.

6818
03:21:34,400 --> 03:21:34,740
This way.

6819
03:21:36,440 --> 03:21:37,120
That's what I said.

6820
03:21:37,980 --> 03:21:40,100
It is kind of big though, so it'd be kind of scary.

6821
03:21:40,300 --> 03:21:42,780
You'd have to like climb on this, I think, as a midway point.

6822
03:21:42,960 --> 03:21:44,020
And then scale around.

6823
03:21:44,020 --> 03:21:45,800
It's hot too, so you're gonna take fire damage.

6824
03:21:47,800 --> 03:21:48,220
Oh gosh.

6825
03:21:48,380 --> 03:21:49,660
I'm scared, I don't think I'm gonna make that.

6826
03:21:49,660 --> 03:21:51,000
Oh my gosh, she gained!

6827
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:53,520
We're cool, we're cool!

6828
03:21:53,820 --> 03:21:55,880
Did you sprint for...

6829
03:21:55,880 --> 03:21:58,980
I did a lunge, but be careful if you don't have enough stamina.

6830
03:22:00,500 --> 03:22:00,800
Oh!

6831
03:22:01,360 --> 03:22:03,920
You might be able to stand on top of this actually, but it's hot.

6832
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:05,400
Follow me!

6833
03:22:05,460 --> 03:22:06,540
You're good, I got you, I got you.

6834
03:22:07,700 --> 03:22:09,900
I think you can stand on top of this, just run.

6835
03:22:10,140 --> 03:22:11,400
The damage will fade away.

6836
03:22:11,740 --> 03:22:12,220
I'm gonna eat.

6837
03:22:17,960 --> 03:22:19,940
I got some rope too, in case we ever need it.

6838
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:20,640
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

6839
03:22:20,740 --> 03:22:21,600
Just jump off and on here.

6840
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:22,780
There you go, you're fine.

6841
03:22:23,260 --> 03:22:23,560
Yay!

6842
03:22:25,620 --> 03:22:25,920
Yay!

6843
03:22:27,260 --> 03:22:27,560
Hooray!

6844
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:28,840
I don't know where to go now.

6845
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:30,080
Up here, I guess.

6846
03:22:30,080 --> 03:22:32,640
What's like the goal to get to?

6847
03:22:33,660 --> 03:22:34,360
The top.

6848
03:22:34,620 --> 03:22:35,560
There's actually an opening.

6849
03:22:35,880 --> 03:22:35,980
The top of the hole.

6850
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:36,660
Oh, there is?

6851
03:22:37,720 --> 03:22:38,200
Yeah.

6852
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:40,520
Oh.

6853
03:22:40,600 --> 03:22:43,440
I don't know how we're gonna get up from here though.

6854
03:22:44,660 --> 03:22:45,380
No, me either.

6855
03:22:47,120 --> 03:22:49,820
I don't, I really don't think there's like a way to go.

6856
03:22:51,580 --> 03:22:54,320
But we can't really go down, cause we're losing stamina.

6857
03:22:54,320 --> 03:22:55,780
I have cookies.

6858
03:22:56,320 --> 03:22:59,000
I just, I think...

6859
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:00,260
Oh gosh.

6860
03:23:01,200 --> 03:23:01,860
Oh gosh.

6861
03:23:02,100 --> 03:23:02,280
Oh gosh.

6862
03:23:02,580 --> 03:23:04,000
How did you guys get up there?

6863
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:04,940
Wait, how are we here?

6864
03:23:05,240 --> 03:23:06,480
There's two cookies in here.

6865
03:23:07,180 --> 03:23:07,960
Yeah, there are.

6866
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:11,560
We don't have any items, I assume.

6867
03:23:12,320 --> 03:23:12,540
No.

6868
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:16,460
How do you get up there?

6869
03:23:17,140 --> 03:23:18,100
Here, I'll boost you.

6870
03:23:18,100 --> 03:23:18,600
Okay.

6871
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:19,640
Thank you.

6872
03:23:20,760 --> 03:23:21,480
I'm climbing.

6873
03:23:21,820 --> 03:23:22,540
I'm climbing.

6874
03:23:23,420 --> 03:23:24,200
Oh, thank you.

6875
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:25,400
I got you.

6876
03:23:25,660 --> 03:23:25,980
Thanks.

6877
03:23:25,980 --> 03:23:26,440
Oh, nope.

6878
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:27,680
You got your own.

6879
03:23:27,860 --> 03:23:28,380
You're all good.

6880
03:23:28,840 --> 03:23:30,840
Oh, maybe we have to go through here.

6881
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:33,940
If we, if we even get up there though, how do we get up here?

6882
03:23:34,300 --> 03:23:35,300
We, I don't think we can.

6883
03:23:35,500 --> 03:23:36,540
Oh my god.

6884
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:37,400
It's too high.

6885
03:23:37,400 --> 03:23:38,340
The only other place that looks...

6886
03:23:38,340 --> 03:23:39,600
I don't even know actually.

6887
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:41,480
I know it.

6888
03:23:41,480 --> 03:23:42,680
I fucking made this place.

6889
03:23:42,700 --> 03:23:43,380
Is that like a chain launcher?

6890
03:23:43,660 --> 03:23:45,040
Nothing looks feasible right now.

6891
03:23:45,660 --> 03:23:48,700
We, we could, we could go all the way around here, maybe.

6892
03:23:49,700 --> 03:23:49,960
Oh.

6893
03:23:50,420 --> 03:23:53,220
But, I don't, I think, I think we need an item.

6894
03:23:54,040 --> 03:23:54,920
There's items in there.

6895
03:23:54,940 --> 03:23:55,820
Does anyone have anything?

6896
03:23:56,140 --> 03:23:56,780
I have rope.

6897
03:23:57,080 --> 03:23:57,880
We need to get up to use rope.

6898
03:23:57,980 --> 03:24:01,680
Doesn't the lollipop make you go TD fast over here?

6899
03:24:01,860 --> 03:24:03,100
It does, but only you.

6900
03:24:03,760 --> 03:24:05,340
Okay, Doki, hear me out.

6901
03:24:05,560 --> 03:24:06,040
Hear me out.

6902
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:07,340
I think I know what we could do.

6903
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:11,460
But, you should take the lollipop, and you should go up here.

6904
03:24:11,460 --> 03:24:14,880
You should use that energy to climb all the way up to this bridge.

6905
03:24:15,660 --> 03:24:16,020
Yeah.

6906
03:24:16,240 --> 03:24:17,420
And try and get those loggages.

6907
03:24:17,560 --> 03:24:18,240
Do you think it would work?

6908
03:24:18,420 --> 03:24:19,460
Do you think that's enough of a boost?

6909
03:24:19,720 --> 03:24:20,600
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6910
03:24:20,680 --> 03:24:21,840
It's your time to shine.

6911
03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:23,240
No, no, hold on.

6912
03:24:24,220 --> 03:24:25,420
No, take this rope.

6913
03:24:25,700 --> 03:24:26,820
This is your lollipop.

6914
03:24:26,940 --> 03:24:28,840
Take this rope and lower it down for us.

6915
03:24:29,020 --> 03:24:29,160
No, no, no, no.

6916
03:24:29,160 --> 03:24:29,920
No, it's not.

6917
03:24:30,140 --> 03:24:31,200
You should do it.

6918
03:24:31,580 --> 03:24:31,820
You should.

6919
03:24:31,840 --> 03:24:33,900
Well, I'm actually, I'm actually looking at this.

6920
03:24:34,160 --> 03:24:34,660
Look at this.

6921
03:24:34,780 --> 03:24:37,800
If we run across the hot rocks, we can actually get all the way up there.

6922
03:24:38,160 --> 03:24:38,280
Awww.

6923
03:24:38,320 --> 03:24:39,360
That's what I said before.

6924
03:24:39,660 --> 03:24:39,980
Oh, okay.

6925
03:24:39,980 --> 03:24:40,520
A hot rocks.

6926
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:42,120
We can try that then.

6927
03:24:42,620 --> 03:24:42,760
Okay.

6928
03:24:43,280 --> 03:24:43,440
Yeah.

6929
03:24:44,720 --> 03:24:45,680
So we're going back down?

6930
03:24:47,580 --> 03:24:48,640
I think so.

6931
03:24:48,860 --> 03:24:49,580
Where we came from?

6932
03:24:49,900 --> 03:24:50,040
Okay.

6933
03:24:50,560 --> 03:24:50,940
Oh.

6934
03:24:54,980 --> 03:24:55,360
Man.

6935
03:24:55,960 --> 03:24:56,200
Oh.

6936
03:25:01,460 --> 03:25:02,320
That's gonna hurt.

6937
03:25:04,120 --> 03:25:04,480
Oh.

6938
03:25:04,880 --> 03:25:05,180
Yeah.

6939
03:25:06,300 --> 03:25:07,320
That's gonna hurt.

6940
03:25:07,520 --> 03:25:08,600
I gonna leave a mic.

6941
03:25:10,740 --> 03:25:12,060
Can we get up there?

6942
03:25:12,460 --> 03:25:12,520
Can we get up there?

6943
03:25:12,520 --> 03:25:13,400
But it's on its work.

6944
03:25:21,200 --> 03:25:21,560
Okay.

6945
03:25:21,720 --> 03:25:23,340
You don't, you only take like a tick if you're quick.

6946
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:24,260
This one's okay.

6947
03:25:24,460 --> 03:25:24,900
Oh, gosh.

6948
03:25:25,100 --> 03:25:25,640
I'm not fast.

6949
03:25:25,880 --> 03:25:27,160
I took a lot more than a tick.

6950
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:27,800
I almost died.

6951
03:25:28,120 --> 03:25:28,780
Be careful, guys.

6952
03:25:28,860 --> 03:25:29,240
Be careful.

6953
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:30,200
Oh.

6954
03:25:30,520 --> 03:25:30,880
Okay.

6955
03:25:31,220 --> 03:25:32,500
I got it just a little bit.

6956
03:25:32,980 --> 03:25:33,340
Okay.

6957
03:25:33,480 --> 03:25:34,000
Thank you.

6958
03:25:36,060 --> 03:25:36,920
Come on, doggy.

6959
03:25:37,060 --> 03:25:37,320
Okay.

6960
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:39,400
Oh.

6961
03:25:40,600 --> 03:25:41,300
It's spicy.

6962
03:25:41,300 --> 03:25:41,860
There we go.

6963
03:25:41,880 --> 03:25:43,120
I'm gonna wait here and give you a lift up.

6964
03:25:45,180 --> 03:25:46,280
Boy, this is scary.

6965
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:47,660
Uh-huh.

6966
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:49,920
Thank you.

6967
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:51,440
Yep.

6968
03:25:53,260 --> 03:25:53,620
Music.

6969
03:25:55,260 --> 03:25:55,860
Oh, my gosh.

6970
03:25:59,860 --> 03:26:00,220
Alrighty.

6971
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:01,360
Okay.

6972
03:26:01,560 --> 03:26:03,040
So across the big rock and onto the bridge.

6973
03:26:03,120 --> 03:26:03,680
You see what I mean?

6974
03:26:04,820 --> 03:26:05,880
You should go first.

6975
03:26:06,920 --> 03:26:07,280
Okay.

6976
03:26:07,280 --> 03:26:09,600
I know what you mean, but you should go first.

6977
03:26:10,200 --> 03:26:10,920
Oh, God.

6978
03:26:11,060 --> 03:26:12,220
This is gonna be beans, actually.

6979
03:26:14,260 --> 03:26:14,680
Oh,

6980
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:19,100
why is the music so intense?

6981
03:26:19,180 --> 03:26:20,120
I don't know.

6982
03:26:20,400 --> 03:26:20,860
I don't know.

6983
03:26:25,280 --> 03:26:25,700
Okay.

6984
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:28,400
That is...

6985
03:26:28,400 --> 03:26:28,660
Maybe?

6986
03:26:37,900 --> 03:26:38,580
Oh, my God.

6987
03:26:39,320 --> 03:26:39,940
Oh, my God.

6988
03:26:40,060 --> 03:26:40,560
She's aiming.

6989
03:26:42,260 --> 03:26:43,020
Oh, my God.

6990
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:44,000
Oh, what does she do?

6991
03:26:45,640 --> 03:26:46,960
What does she do?

6992
03:26:47,060 --> 03:26:47,640
I didn't make it.

6993
03:26:47,680 --> 03:26:48,180
I didn't jump.

6994
03:26:48,300 --> 03:26:48,740
I didn't jump.

6995
03:26:48,860 --> 03:26:49,260
I'm going back.

6996
03:26:49,400 --> 03:26:49,720
I'm going back.

6997
03:26:49,860 --> 03:26:50,200
I didn't jump.

6998
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:50,840
Grab me.

6999
03:26:50,980 --> 03:26:51,220
Grab me.

7000
03:26:51,260 --> 03:26:51,760
Grab me.

7001
03:26:51,760 --> 03:26:51,780
Grab me.

7002
03:26:52,420 --> 03:26:53,000
I'm scared.

7003
03:26:53,420 --> 03:26:54,160
I took it out.

7004
03:26:54,540 --> 03:26:55,200
Somebody else go.

7005
03:26:56,640 --> 03:26:57,680
Is that enough rope?

7006
03:26:57,720 --> 03:27:00,420
If you can get to this bit, is that enough work for you to get up?

7007
03:27:00,580 --> 03:27:01,200
I think so.

7008
03:27:01,340 --> 03:27:01,660
Sure.

7009
03:27:02,200 --> 03:27:02,420
Yeah.

7010
03:27:02,620 --> 03:27:04,000
You can even put up a little bit more.

7011
03:27:05,440 --> 03:27:05,800
Any good?

7012
03:27:05,860 --> 03:27:06,320
A little bit more.

7013
03:27:06,460 --> 03:27:08,200
That's about as much as I can do, apparently.

7014
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,100
No no no, pull it back up a little bit.

7015
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:15,100
Okay, a little bit, a little bit...

7016
03:27:16,940 --> 03:27:18,180
Still more, still more, still more.

7017
03:27:19,180 --> 03:27:19,880
Okay, that's good, that's good.

7018
03:27:21,380 --> 03:27:23,720
If that saves us any extra rope, I'll take it.

7019
03:27:23,940 --> 03:27:25,100
I have rope too, so...

7020
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:26,340
Okay.

7021
03:27:27,800 --> 03:27:28,360
Selfie, I believe.

7022
03:27:30,540 --> 03:27:32,320
Wait, no, no, no, this isn't the way, this isn't the way.

7023
03:27:32,340 --> 03:27:32,880
Take me, take me.

7024
03:27:33,180 --> 03:27:34,120
I take my body again.

7025
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:38,120
Guys, I have my feet cooked.

7026
03:27:38,320 --> 03:27:39,540
I don't know if I can make this jump.

7027
03:27:39,540 --> 03:27:41,120
Alright, I believe, man.

7028
03:27:44,640 --> 03:27:46,160
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

7029
03:27:46,320 --> 03:27:49,540
Oh crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, ee, ee, ee.

7030
03:27:50,200 --> 03:27:50,660
Okay.

7031
03:27:51,800 --> 03:27:52,260
Okay.

7032
03:27:53,800 --> 03:27:55,220
I almost didn't make that.

7033
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:56,740
Guys, that was really bad.

7034
03:27:58,120 --> 03:27:58,860
You're okay.

7035
03:28:01,820 --> 03:28:03,400
Oh my god, I'm not gonna make it.

7036
03:28:03,460 --> 03:28:05,100
I'm not gonna make it.

7037
03:28:05,200 --> 03:28:06,060
I got my hand out.

7038
03:28:06,540 --> 03:28:08,020
I got my hand out.

7039
03:28:08,220 --> 03:28:10,000
Oh my god.

7040
03:28:10,420 --> 03:28:11,200
I made it.

7041
03:28:11,400 --> 03:28:12,000
We're fine.

7042
03:28:12,380 --> 03:28:13,200
I made it.

7043
03:28:13,780 --> 03:28:14,680
You made it.

7044
03:28:15,420 --> 03:28:16,420
I made it.

7045
03:28:18,900 --> 03:28:20,840
I think... do you think we go across enough?

7046
03:28:21,040 --> 03:28:21,880
Or do we stay here?

7047
03:28:22,060 --> 03:28:22,900
I think we might stay here.

7048
03:28:22,920 --> 03:28:23,220
Snuffy?

7049
03:28:27,520 --> 03:28:28,240
Oh no.

7050
03:28:28,760 --> 03:28:29,720
I don't think Stuffy...

7051
03:28:30,420 --> 03:28:31,740
I don't think Stuffy made it.

7052
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:33,660
Okay, we gotta keep going.

7053
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:35,560
Oh, can I have one?

7054
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:36,900
Yeah, I need some food.

7055
03:28:37,540 --> 03:28:38,180
Okay, thank you.

7056
03:28:38,180 --> 03:28:38,560
There we go.

7057
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:40,100
Okay, thank you.

7058
03:28:42,980 --> 03:28:43,900
Oh gosh.

7059
03:28:44,580 --> 03:28:48,180
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

7060
03:28:48,260 --> 03:28:50,140
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

7061
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:51,020
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

7062
03:28:51,300 --> 03:28:53,420
I get up this way, I think.

7063
03:28:54,480 --> 03:28:56,960
There was some medkits and lollipop.

7064
03:28:57,160 --> 03:28:57,940
And a lollipop, sorry.

7065
03:28:59,040 --> 03:28:59,380
Yay!

7066
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:03,240
I'm a big boy now.

7067
03:29:03,420 --> 03:29:04,760
I'm a big boy now.

7068
03:29:05,200 --> 03:29:05,600
Hey!

7069
03:29:05,600 --> 03:29:08,160
I don't know if this is the way though, because it gets very sheer again.

7070
03:29:08,300 --> 03:29:09,340
I'm wondering if we go across.

7071
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:10,340
Mmm.

7072
03:29:10,880 --> 03:29:11,140
Oh.

7073
03:29:12,560 --> 03:29:12,960
Oh.

7074
03:29:13,020 --> 03:29:14,400
Like, both ways suck.

7075
03:29:14,900 --> 03:29:15,180
Yeah.

7076
03:29:15,540 --> 03:29:15,780
Oh.

7077
03:29:22,350 --> 03:29:23,910
Yeah, I don't think this goes...

7078
03:29:23,910 --> 03:29:24,930
Oh, Stuffy, what happened, Stuffy?

7079
03:29:25,230 --> 03:29:25,630
Stuffy!

7080
03:29:26,270 --> 03:29:27,850
Unless I can get up this way.

7081
03:29:30,890 --> 03:29:35,190
I knew I wasn't going to be able to do it.

7082
03:29:35,490 --> 03:29:35,510
No.

7083
03:29:35,990 --> 03:29:39,310
Lamo, you sacrificed yourself for us.

7084
03:29:39,350 --> 03:29:40,750
No, Stuffy!

7085
03:29:42,370 --> 03:29:43,550
You guys made it!

7086
03:29:43,550 --> 03:29:45,510
There's more luggage on the other side.

7087
03:29:45,970 --> 03:29:46,610
There's more luggage.

7088
03:29:46,930 --> 03:29:48,030
I think we go this way again.

7089
03:29:48,970 --> 03:29:49,450
I think so too.

7090
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:50,210
So I think we...

7091
03:29:50,210 --> 03:29:53,970
You purposely didn't tell us that you were starving so we could safely...

7092
03:29:55,030 --> 03:29:55,190
Ouch!

7093
03:29:55,190 --> 03:29:56,670
I didn't think I was that low.

7094
03:29:56,970 --> 03:29:57,190
Ouch!

7095
03:29:57,190 --> 03:29:58,670
I thought I had good stamina.

7096
03:29:58,930 --> 03:29:59,290
I was...

7097
03:29:59,290 --> 03:29:59,910
I don't know.

7098
03:30:00,570 --> 03:30:01,270
Oh no, Mint!

7099
03:30:02,450 --> 03:30:03,210
We're going across.

7100
03:30:03,450 --> 03:30:04,150
Yeah, we're going across.

7101
03:30:05,450 --> 03:30:05,930
It's okay.

7102
03:30:06,130 --> 03:30:07,210
I took damage, but it's okay.

7103
03:30:13,680 --> 03:30:14,800
I'm scared, guys.

7104
03:30:18,500 --> 03:30:19,760
It is a little scary.

7105
03:30:20,440 --> 03:30:20,760
Yeah.

7106
03:30:22,040 --> 03:30:22,320
Yeah.

7107
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:24,000
Do you think we do the Hot Rock?

7108
03:30:24,220 --> 03:30:25,200
Or do we go on the right?

7109
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:26,300
I think the Hot Rock actually...

7110
03:30:26,300 --> 03:30:26,960
There's a bit above it.

7111
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:28,660
So I think we need to do the Hot Rock again.

7112
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:29,260
Ouch!

7113
03:30:29,260 --> 03:30:31,520
We'll be able to stomach standing on the Rock.

7114
03:30:31,600 --> 03:30:32,500
She's so injured.

7115
03:30:32,580 --> 03:30:32,800
Ouch!

7116
03:30:33,780 --> 03:30:35,600
Wait, are you actually injured or just hot?

7117
03:30:35,920 --> 03:30:36,680
I'm injured.

7118
03:30:37,860 --> 03:30:39,180
She broke our legs.

7119
03:30:39,960 --> 03:30:40,140
Yeah.

7120
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:40,800
Oh.

7121
03:30:42,300 --> 03:30:42,760
Ouch!

7122
03:30:42,920 --> 03:30:43,100
Ouch!

7123
03:30:43,100 --> 03:30:43,300
Thank you!

7124
03:30:43,540 --> 03:30:43,780
Ouchie, ouch!

7125
03:30:44,300 --> 03:30:45,560
Wait, you should save it!

7126
03:30:46,100 --> 03:30:46,740
Oh, thank you!

7127
03:30:46,740 --> 03:30:47,060
It's fine.

7128
03:30:48,280 --> 03:30:48,760
Ouchie!

7129
03:30:50,780 --> 03:30:51,700
What do we do?

7130
03:30:51,900 --> 03:30:52,880
It's spicy here.

7131
03:30:53,920 --> 03:30:54,320
Uh...

7132
03:30:54,320 --> 03:30:55,060
I'm gonna...

7133
03:30:55,060 --> 03:30:55,700
I'm gonna go check.

7134
03:30:56,240 --> 03:30:56,720
Okay, I'm...

7135
03:30:56,720 --> 03:30:57,460
I'm going back down.

7136
03:30:57,840 --> 03:30:58,160
Ouch!

7137
03:30:58,560 --> 03:30:58,900
Come down!

7138
03:30:58,900 --> 03:30:59,640
My spicy legs.

7139
03:31:00,040 --> 03:31:01,680
Doki, come down here so you don't get hurt.

7140
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:02,240
No, it's fine.

7141
03:31:02,280 --> 03:31:02,920
I'm safe here.

7142
03:31:03,280 --> 03:31:03,700
Oh, okay.

7143
03:31:04,200 --> 03:31:04,680
You are?

7144
03:31:05,180 --> 03:31:05,580
Ow!

7145
03:31:05,800 --> 03:31:06,080
Yeah.

7146
03:31:06,640 --> 03:31:07,880
I'm safe in this little hole.

7147
03:31:08,100 --> 03:31:08,420
Oh, okay.

7148
03:31:08,520 --> 03:31:09,100
I'll come to the hole.

7149
03:31:09,820 --> 03:31:10,220
Nice.

7150
03:31:11,360 --> 03:31:11,660
Nice.

7151
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:12,820
There's a spot to stand.

7152
03:31:13,120 --> 03:31:13,880
It's bucky though.

7153
03:31:15,540 --> 03:31:15,940
Okay.

7154
03:31:18,260 --> 03:31:19,060
How bucky.

7155
03:31:19,880 --> 03:31:20,800
Yeah, you can stand.

7156
03:31:20,980 --> 03:31:21,740
Yeah, wherever you are.

7157
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:23,040
And then you come up this hot rock here.

7158
03:31:23,720 --> 03:31:24,100
Ouch.

7159
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:24,540
Ouch.

7160
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:25,680
Guys, I like stand.

7161
03:31:25,880 --> 03:31:26,420
You can't fly.

7162
03:31:27,360 --> 03:31:27,740
Ouch.

7163
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:28,320
Ouch.

7164
03:31:29,520 --> 03:31:29,980
Oh god.

7165
03:31:36,640 --> 03:31:37,820
She's burning up!

7166
03:31:37,960 --> 03:31:38,540
You can do it!

7167
03:31:38,600 --> 03:31:39,040
You can do it!

7168
03:31:41,140 --> 03:31:41,760
Thank you!

7169
03:31:42,380 --> 03:31:42,700
Woo!

7170
03:31:48,510 --> 03:31:49,270
That was...

7171
03:31:49,270 --> 03:31:50,350
I'm just gonna check the suitcases.

7172
03:31:50,550 --> 03:31:51,250
Can you wait for Doki?

7173
03:31:51,450 --> 03:31:52,850
Yeah, I'm looking out for her.

7174
03:31:54,110 --> 03:31:55,010
That was spicy.

7175
03:31:56,150 --> 03:31:57,670
Okay, who's starving to death?

7176
03:31:58,390 --> 03:31:58,790
Um...

7177
03:31:58,790 --> 03:31:59,950
I'm hungry, but...

7178
03:31:59,950 --> 03:32:01,010
You know...

7179
03:32:03,630 --> 03:32:05,990
I think we're probably all the same amount of hungry.

7180
03:32:06,190 --> 03:32:06,770
I'm not gonna lie.

7181
03:32:07,090 --> 03:32:08,930
No, I think Mint you needed a lot more.

7182
03:32:09,150 --> 03:32:09,430
Oh.

7183
03:32:13,510 --> 03:32:14,830
I mean, I have rope.

7184
03:32:14,990 --> 03:32:17,610
Do we put more food in me so I can rope for Mint?

7185
03:32:17,730 --> 03:32:19,470
Or do we try and keep Mint slightly higher?

7186
03:32:20,130 --> 03:32:20,490
Mint has rope.

7187
03:32:20,490 --> 03:32:21,730
How did you make this?

7188
03:32:22,290 --> 03:32:23,290
How did I...

7189
03:32:23,290 --> 03:32:23,930
Uh, with...

7190
03:32:23,930 --> 03:32:24,690
I don't know.

7191
03:32:25,130 --> 03:32:25,390
With a...

7192
03:32:25,390 --> 03:32:26,070
With a dream.

7193
03:32:26,110 --> 03:32:27,630
There's a spot to stand on the hot rock.

7194
03:32:28,030 --> 03:32:28,690
Yeah, there it is.

7195
03:32:28,710 --> 03:32:29,170
Yeah, there you go.

7196
03:32:30,310 --> 03:32:31,050
No, it's not.

7197
03:32:31,150 --> 03:32:31,750
It's not it.

7198
03:32:32,610 --> 03:32:33,610
Oh wait, there it is.

7199
03:32:34,150 --> 03:32:34,530
Yeah, yeah.

7200
03:32:34,690 --> 03:32:35,810
You just gotta catch it.

7201
03:32:36,010 --> 03:32:36,830
You just gotta catch it.

7202
03:32:38,750 --> 03:32:39,530
Grab my hand!

7203
03:32:39,730 --> 03:32:40,050
Wait, wait.

7204
03:32:40,190 --> 03:32:40,890
Oh, you can?

7205
03:32:41,110 --> 03:32:41,810
Okay, hold on.

7206
03:32:42,430 --> 03:32:42,830
Um...

7207
03:32:42,830 --> 03:32:44,090
I'm going to eat this.

7208
03:32:44,370 --> 03:32:44,670
Mint...

7209
03:32:44,670 --> 03:32:49,710
My chat tells me that if I knock you out with a blowgun and you sleep safely, you won't be hungry anymore.

7210
03:32:50,410 --> 03:32:51,090
Come over here.

7211
03:32:51,890 --> 03:32:52,290
Oh.

7212
03:32:52,590 --> 03:32:52,850
Oh, okay.

7213
03:32:52,990 --> 03:32:53,530
We have a...

7214
03:32:53,530 --> 03:32:54,450
Mint's lowest.

7215
03:32:54,670 --> 03:32:55,230
Mint's lowest.

7216
03:32:55,430 --> 03:32:55,750
Come here, Mint.

7217
03:32:56,350 --> 03:32:56,590
Okay.

7218
03:32:56,670 --> 03:32:57,570
Put yourself in this corner.

7219
03:32:57,910 --> 03:32:58,610
Put yourself here.

7220
03:32:58,790 --> 03:32:59,430
Knock me out.

7221
03:33:01,650 --> 03:33:02,050
Honk.

7222
03:33:02,130 --> 03:33:02,710
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

7223
03:33:02,870 --> 03:33:03,130
Oh.

7224
03:33:03,650 --> 03:33:03,810
Okay.

7225
03:33:03,810 --> 03:33:04,370
I'm sleeping.

7226
03:33:04,370 --> 03:33:04,710
Go to sleep.

7227
03:33:04,930 --> 03:33:05,390
I'll see you in a minute.

7228
03:33:05,510 --> 03:33:06,050
Good night.

7229
03:33:06,370 --> 03:33:06,550
Good night.

7230
03:33:06,550 --> 03:33:07,050
Oh, wow.

7231
03:33:07,910 --> 03:33:09,510
Can I pick her up or something?

7232
03:33:10,210 --> 03:33:12,570
What if I pick her up and chuck her into it a lot?

7233
03:33:12,790 --> 03:33:13,970
Uh, pick her up for a little bit.

7234
03:33:14,070 --> 03:33:15,890
Just pick her up and hold her for a little bit just in case.

7235
03:33:15,910 --> 03:33:17,370
I don't know if it like causes a problem.

7236
03:33:18,210 --> 03:33:20,930
Um, it says that I'm about to die, so...

7237
03:33:20,930 --> 03:33:23,430
Did you guys unironically play with motion blur?

7238
03:33:23,610 --> 03:33:24,610
What's wrong with you people?

7239
03:33:25,330 --> 03:33:26,550
Wait, I have motion blur on?

7240
03:33:27,330 --> 03:33:28,010
Did you not?

7241
03:33:28,210 --> 03:33:28,870
I feel like you did.

7242
03:33:29,450 --> 03:33:29,970
Do I?

7243
03:33:30,490 --> 03:33:30,890
Did I?

7244
03:33:31,050 --> 03:33:31,830
Did I actually put motion blur on?

7245
03:33:31,830 --> 03:33:32,890
Oh, they can't hear me, that's right.

7246
03:33:32,890 --> 03:33:33,950
Oh, gosh.

7247
03:33:34,130 --> 03:33:34,230
Okay.

7248
03:33:34,310 --> 03:33:35,490
I think as long as they hold me...

7249
03:33:35,490 --> 03:33:36,610
There's no motion blur anywhere.

7250
03:33:39,030 --> 03:33:39,910
I'm awake!

7251
03:33:40,350 --> 03:33:40,750
I think?

7252
03:33:41,050 --> 03:33:41,610
Good morning!

7253
03:33:42,070 --> 03:33:42,250
Good morning!

7254
03:33:42,250 --> 03:33:43,190
Are you hungry anymore?

7255
03:33:43,410 --> 03:33:43,870
I'm not!

7256
03:33:45,270 --> 03:33:45,710
Hooray!

7257
03:33:46,330 --> 03:33:48,850
I'm letting the Z's go away and then I'll be okay.

7258
03:33:49,270 --> 03:33:49,450
Okay.

7259
03:33:49,930 --> 03:33:50,770
I almost...

7260
03:33:50,770 --> 03:33:50,970
If Doki...

7261
03:33:51,890 --> 03:33:56,210
Also, if Doki hadn't picked me up, I would have died, so...

7262
03:33:56,210 --> 03:33:56,550
Oh.

7263
03:33:59,190 --> 03:34:00,070
I'm super...

7264
03:34:00,070 --> 03:34:03,330
It's like we're just looking at your body for the longest time.

7265
03:34:05,990 --> 03:34:06,890
Okay, I'm just...

7266
03:34:06,890 --> 03:34:07,690
I'm catching...

7267
03:34:09,430 --> 03:34:10,310
I'm recovering.

7268
03:34:11,190 --> 03:34:13,050
I think another hot rock jump is in order.

7269
03:34:13,270 --> 03:34:15,590
It's pretty slow, but I'm almost there.

7270
03:34:16,990 --> 03:34:18,330
Yeah, there's also this part here.

7271
03:34:18,550 --> 03:34:18,970
How you doing, Snuffy?

7272
03:34:18,970 --> 03:34:19,390
What?

7273
03:34:20,930 --> 03:34:23,090
I'm chilling in this...

7274
03:34:23,090 --> 03:34:23,290
Chamberlain.

7275
03:34:23,290 --> 03:34:23,570
Chamberlain.

7276
03:34:24,010 --> 03:34:24,630
Let me have a look.

7277
03:34:25,870 --> 03:34:26,610
Pop box.

7278
03:34:27,390 --> 03:34:27,610
Alright.

7279
03:34:27,890 --> 03:34:28,550
Pop pop pop.

7280
03:34:28,730 --> 03:34:29,050
Oh shoot.

7281
03:34:29,510 --> 03:34:30,150
I need to...

7282
03:34:30,150 --> 03:34:31,350
Pop pop pop pop.

7283
03:34:31,790 --> 03:34:32,190
Oh gosh.

7284
03:34:32,430 --> 03:34:32,550
Oh!

7285
03:34:33,450 --> 03:34:34,590
I'm waiting for...

7286
03:34:35,550 --> 03:34:36,510
Laimu's executive...

7287
03:34:36,510 --> 03:34:37,190
Decision.

7288
03:34:37,290 --> 03:34:37,450
Okay.

7289
03:34:37,950 --> 03:34:38,330
Oof!

7290
03:34:41,830 --> 03:34:42,490
Okay, yeah.

7291
03:34:42,550 --> 03:34:43,870
There's lots of places to stay here.

7292
03:34:44,590 --> 03:34:44,870
Okay.

7293
03:34:45,230 --> 03:34:45,530
Okay.

7294
03:34:45,910 --> 03:34:46,870
I'm following you, Doki.

7295
03:34:46,970 --> 03:34:47,810
Wherever...

7296
03:34:47,810 --> 03:34:48,730
Laimu went.

7297
03:34:48,870 --> 03:34:49,410
I didn't really...

7298
03:34:49,410 --> 03:34:50,730
I didn't really know what she did.

7299
03:34:51,010 --> 03:34:51,430
But okay.

7300
03:34:51,910 --> 03:34:52,150
Alright.

7301
03:34:53,830 --> 03:34:54,550
You're okay.

7302
03:34:54,730 --> 03:34:55,390
You'll see it.

7303
03:34:55,490 --> 03:34:56,550
It's pretty straight forward actually.

7304
03:34:58,070 --> 03:34:59,030
Oh, I see it.

7305
03:35:03,030 --> 03:35:03,510
Nice.

7306
03:35:03,890 --> 03:35:04,170
Yeah.

7307
03:35:04,550 --> 03:35:04,930
And then...

7308
03:35:04,930 --> 03:35:05,790
Left side.

7309
03:35:05,970 --> 03:35:06,350
Over there.

7310
03:35:06,510 --> 03:35:06,930
Turn around.

7311
03:35:07,070 --> 03:35:07,430
Turn around.

7312
03:35:08,050 --> 03:35:08,630
Oh, here?

7313
03:35:09,470 --> 03:35:10,290
Oh, I see it.

7314
03:35:17,690 --> 03:35:18,690
You got it?

7315
03:35:19,850 --> 03:35:20,790
Wait, why am I...

7316
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:21,990
Why am I attached to the wall?

7317
03:35:22,090 --> 03:35:22,390
What the heck?

7318
03:35:23,310 --> 03:35:25,190
I was gonna get you, but...

7319
03:35:25,190 --> 03:35:25,770
I got it.

7320
03:35:25,770 --> 03:35:26,250
I got it.

7321
03:35:27,810 --> 03:35:28,170
Okay.

7322
03:35:28,610 --> 03:35:29,590
Wait, did you...

7323
03:35:29,590 --> 03:35:30,670
How did you make that?

7324
03:35:31,990 --> 03:35:32,350
Uh...

7325
03:35:32,350 --> 03:35:33,050
Climbed up this way.

7326
03:35:33,190 --> 03:35:34,070
I'll put my arm up for you.

7327
03:35:34,350 --> 03:35:34,610
Okay.

7328
03:35:36,130 --> 03:35:36,490
Okay.

7329
03:35:36,790 --> 03:35:37,190
I got you.

7330
03:35:37,290 --> 03:35:37,630
I got you.

7331
03:35:39,830 --> 03:35:40,510
Thank you.

7332
03:35:40,610 --> 03:35:41,510
There we go.

7333
03:35:43,330 --> 03:35:43,770
Maxer!

7334
03:35:43,910 --> 03:35:44,350
Maxer!

7335
03:35:44,950 --> 03:35:45,210
Yeah!

7336
03:35:45,390 --> 03:35:45,690
Yeah.

7337
03:35:46,450 --> 03:35:46,530
Yeah!

7338
03:35:47,570 --> 03:35:48,270
Oh my God!

7339
03:35:48,790 --> 03:35:49,610
How much further?

7340
03:35:49,830 --> 03:35:51,010
Oh wait, I think I see the ceiling.

7341
03:35:51,070 --> 03:35:52,630
We're almost there, we're almost there.

7342
03:35:52,770 --> 03:35:52,950
Where are we?

7343
03:35:52,950 --> 03:35:53,810
We're actually almost there.

7344
03:35:54,850 --> 03:35:55,950
I see the light!

7345
03:35:56,070 --> 03:35:57,010
I see the light!

7346
03:35:57,850 --> 03:35:58,290
I see the light.

7347
03:35:58,290 --> 03:35:58,670
Following limelight.

7348
03:35:58,690 --> 03:36:00,070
The light, it calls for me!

7349
03:36:00,210 --> 03:36:01,670
Do you want to go straight to the light?

7350
03:36:01,970 --> 03:36:02,290
Yeah!

7351
03:36:02,890 --> 03:36:03,710
Go to the light!

7352
03:36:04,970 --> 03:36:05,350
Yay!

7353
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:09,420
Oh, okay.

7354
03:36:09,580 --> 03:36:10,940
There's a spot to stand just below me.

7355
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:11,440
You're good.

7356
03:36:12,040 --> 03:36:12,200
Sorry.

7357
03:36:12,460 --> 03:36:13,300
Sorry to push you.

7358
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:15,580
You're fine.

7359
03:36:15,700 --> 03:36:15,900
You're fine.

7360
03:36:16,120 --> 03:36:16,360
Okay.

7361
03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:17,240
Behind you.

7362
03:36:17,660 --> 03:36:18,460
There you are.

7363
03:36:21,280 --> 03:36:21,720
Here?

7364
03:36:21,720 --> 03:36:22,600
Oh my gosh.

7365
03:36:22,820 --> 03:36:23,160
I think so.

7366
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:23,880
You guys, we can see.

7367
03:36:24,060 --> 03:36:24,500
Oh god.

7368
03:36:25,940 --> 03:36:28,260
Don't forget you still have your hunger.

7369
03:36:28,820 --> 03:36:29,820
Don't slap off.

7370
03:36:30,760 --> 03:36:30,960
Yeah.

7371
03:36:31,240 --> 03:36:31,820
I'm so hungry.

7372
03:36:31,820 --> 03:36:32,300
I'm hungry.

7373
03:36:33,480 --> 03:36:34,660
I'm so hungry.

7374
03:36:34,700 --> 03:36:34,980
Okay.

7375
03:36:35,400 --> 03:36:40,580
I think we need to go across the hot rock because we could go up here, but there's nowhere from there to go.

7376
03:36:40,820 --> 03:36:43,640
I did lose my rope, I think, from the thing.

7377
03:36:44,020 --> 03:36:44,280
Oh.

7378
03:36:44,620 --> 03:36:45,520
I should have dropped it.

7379
03:36:46,820 --> 03:36:47,360
That's okay.

7380
03:36:48,620 --> 03:36:50,440
I don't know if we can do this.

7381
03:36:51,880 --> 03:36:53,220
Let me do a quick check.

7382
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:53,780
Okay.

7383
03:36:55,400 --> 03:36:57,880
It looks like you can stand there where you're going.

7384
03:36:59,020 --> 03:37:00,980
I don't know if we can do this.

7385
03:37:01,020 --> 03:37:01,020
I don't know if we can do this.

7386
03:37:01,020 --> 03:37:01,020
Yeah.

7387
03:37:01,340 --> 03:37:01,800
Oh yeah.

7388
03:37:02,800 --> 03:37:04,080
To the left, maybe?

7389
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:07,300
Oh, wait.

7390
03:37:09,780 --> 03:37:11,060
Oh, it's so far.

7391
03:37:11,280 --> 03:37:11,460
Shit.

7392
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:14,480
I don't think she's gonna make it, guys.

7393
03:37:15,020 --> 03:37:17,740
If you... Uh... Uh, no.

7394
03:37:17,860 --> 03:37:18,720
She's not in this way.

7395
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:19,180
No.

7396
03:37:19,640 --> 03:37:21,980
It's not that way, so she'll come back to come down.

7397
03:37:22,200 --> 03:37:23,880
I made it, but it took up too much.

7398
03:37:26,700 --> 03:37:29,780
I think you guys could be on, maybe, the left side here.

7399
03:37:30,000 --> 03:37:30,660
These rocks.

7400
03:37:30,960 --> 03:37:32,360
This formation over here.

7401
03:37:32,680 --> 03:37:33,160
No.

7402
03:37:33,440 --> 03:37:34,320
Oh, that way.

7403
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:35,140
Yeah, here.

7404
03:37:35,860 --> 03:37:39,720
You might be able to get more footing there without having to go so long between your stamina.

7405
03:37:40,540 --> 03:37:41,540
Yeah, look over here.

7406
03:37:42,320 --> 03:37:43,020
Yeah, yeah.

7407
03:37:43,380 --> 03:37:43,660
Okay.

7408
03:37:44,060 --> 03:37:44,540
Yeah, yeah.

7409
03:37:44,740 --> 03:37:45,220
Got you.

7410
03:37:45,540 --> 03:37:45,680
Yay.

7411
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:55,360
I got my arm out.

7412
03:37:56,240 --> 03:37:57,860
I don't know if I can make it.

7413
03:37:58,000 --> 03:37:59,060
I don't know if we can do it.

7414
03:37:59,220 --> 03:37:59,220
I don't know if we can do it.

7415
03:37:59,260 --> 03:38:00,600
I'm hungry so bad now.

7416
03:38:02,600 --> 03:38:03,380
Come on.

7417
03:38:04,200 --> 03:38:04,240
Oh.

7418
03:38:04,620 --> 03:38:04,820
Yeah.

7419
03:38:05,220 --> 03:38:05,320
Oh.

7420
03:38:05,960 --> 03:38:06,400
Oh.

7421
03:38:06,760 --> 03:38:07,620
Just made that.

7422
03:38:07,620 --> 03:38:08,300
Oh my God.

7423
03:38:08,300 --> 03:38:08,520
Just barely.

7424
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:09,900
Just barely.

7425
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:13,720
Okay, Doki, you're going into a ma... Well, actually, you...

7426
03:38:14,440 --> 03:38:16,520
I don't think you have anywhere to go from there.

7427
03:38:16,680 --> 03:38:17,240
That's probably bad.

7428
03:38:17,240 --> 03:38:18,200
I'm gonna be fine.

7429
03:38:18,480 --> 03:38:19,120
Sorry, hold on.

7430
03:38:19,400 --> 03:38:19,840
You're fine.

7431
03:38:20,900 --> 03:38:21,740
Explore all year.

7432
03:38:22,080 --> 03:38:22,080
Yeah.

7433
03:38:23,320 --> 03:38:23,560
Yeah.

7434
03:38:23,560 --> 03:38:24,100
There's nowhere to go.

7435
03:38:24,220 --> 03:38:24,940
Doki, don't go up there.

7436
03:38:24,940 --> 03:38:25,980
You're gonna fall and die.

7437
03:38:27,020 --> 03:38:27,420
It's okay.

7438
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:27,740
I know.

7439
03:38:27,900 --> 03:38:29,040
It's kind of fun to grab you.

7440
03:38:29,240 --> 03:38:29,460
Oh.

7441
03:38:29,640 --> 03:38:30,360
We grabbed each other.

7442
03:38:30,600 --> 03:38:31,500
We grabbed each other.

7443
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:33,480
We grabbed each other.

7444
03:38:33,660 --> 03:38:33,740
We're here.

7445
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:34,760
It's truly nowhere to go.

7446
03:38:34,860 --> 03:38:37,080
You'll have to see if you grab one of his hand up there.

7447
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:39,680
Where is she, though?

7448
03:38:40,100 --> 03:38:43,180
I mean, I'm here, but there's nowhere really up here.

7449
03:38:43,680 --> 03:38:44,340
That's the problem.

7450
03:38:44,460 --> 03:38:45,120
There's nowhere up here.

7451
03:38:45,560 --> 03:38:45,740
No.

7452
03:38:45,880 --> 03:38:46,820
What do we do?

7453
03:38:47,120 --> 03:38:47,560
No.

7454
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:50,200
What do we do?

7455
03:38:50,720 --> 03:38:51,560
What about here?

7456
03:38:53,620 --> 03:38:54,300
Oh, come on.

7457
03:38:54,300 --> 03:38:54,860
Is there anything here?

7458
03:38:56,240 --> 03:38:56,720
Where?

7459
03:38:57,100 --> 03:39:00,120
I mean, you can go that way, but I don't see where you go from around.

7460
03:39:00,600 --> 03:39:01,080
Oh.

7461
03:39:01,480 --> 03:39:04,900
Oh, I have the lollipop, but I'm scared.

7462
03:39:04,900 --> 03:39:07,760
I think... Doki, I think if you took the lollipop...

7463
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:13,960
If you climbed up there and then took the lollipop, you could probably make it to that bridge, but you wouldn't have to let yourself take a break at all.

7464
03:39:14,120 --> 03:39:15,300
You'd have to go straight there.

7465
03:39:15,980 --> 03:39:19,780
But it... it'll make you tired, but your stamina will go crazy and it'll be really fast.

7466
03:39:20,060 --> 03:39:20,600
I'm going to use the lollipop again.

7467
03:39:21,100 --> 03:39:21,480
Hold on.

7468
03:39:22,100 --> 03:39:24,460
Okay, well, we'll let her use the lollipop first.

7469
03:39:24,680 --> 03:39:24,820
Yeah.

7470
03:39:27,680 --> 03:39:28,620
Oh my god, look at your ghost.

7471
03:39:28,780 --> 03:39:30,020
She's like a little spider monkey.

7472
03:39:30,740 --> 03:39:31,640
Whoa, she's zooming.

7473
03:39:46,300 --> 03:39:48,580
I think the eyes are just going crazy.

7474
03:39:49,440 --> 03:39:50,740
Oh, she made it.

7475
03:39:51,460 --> 03:39:51,600
I think she made it.

7476
03:39:52,080 --> 03:39:53,440
Oh, there's a chain gun.

7477
03:39:55,140 --> 03:39:57,440
It's actually a rope cannon, less good.

7478
03:39:57,960 --> 03:39:59,740
Less good old thing.

7479
03:39:59,740 --> 03:40:03,140
She can still use it to make you guys get up somewhere, though, maybe, hopefully.

7480
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:05,940
Oh my god, there's a little hole here.

7481
03:40:06,060 --> 03:40:07,300
I scared the shit out of me.

7482
03:40:07,440 --> 03:40:07,880
I could have disappeared.

7483
03:40:07,960 --> 03:40:10,140
Do I maybe use the... Where do I go?

7484
03:40:10,360 --> 03:40:11,760
Where do I lower the rope from?

7485
03:40:11,940 --> 03:40:13,020
Like, where would be best to pick you guys up?

7486
03:40:13,020 --> 03:40:16,380
I don't even know how... I think, like, Min and I are fucked.

7487
03:40:17,040 --> 03:40:19,200
Okay, this is... I see it, I see it.

7488
03:40:19,280 --> 03:40:21,000
Okay, I think...

7489
03:40:23,160 --> 03:40:23,980
I don't know.

7490
03:40:24,260 --> 03:40:25,440
We're getting hungry.

7491
03:40:25,840 --> 03:40:29,720
The only place that they can reach that, I think, from where you are, is that second bottom line.

7492
03:40:29,720 --> 03:40:33,620
There's some bridge that's not all the way connected to the wall, but it's beneath this bridge.

7493
03:40:33,860 --> 03:40:37,460
They might be able to jump on that, but it would be in...

7494
03:40:40,480 --> 03:40:42,120
Can you get to this, maybe?

7495
03:40:43,140 --> 03:40:43,760
To that?

7496
03:40:43,780 --> 03:40:44,640
Okay, we'll get back there.

7497
03:40:44,780 --> 03:40:46,160
Let me think, let me think, though.

7498
03:40:46,340 --> 03:40:49,220
I can't, I can't drop, because I won't be able to get back up.

7499
03:40:50,900 --> 03:40:52,240
I have a lollipop.

7500
03:40:54,300 --> 03:40:55,080
Desperate times.

7501
03:40:55,900 --> 03:40:57,400
I can try and get there.

7502
03:40:57,620 --> 03:40:59,420
Or do you want to shoot the rope first?

7503
03:41:00,760 --> 03:41:03,020
Well, wait, hold on, let me try and get above you.

7504
03:41:03,860 --> 03:41:04,480
One sec.

7505
03:41:04,900 --> 03:41:06,160
Do I use my lollipop now?

7506
03:41:09,200 --> 03:41:10,100
I'm gonna do it.

7507
03:41:10,760 --> 03:41:13,040
Oh gosh, your eyes are going into the back of your head.

7508
03:41:13,040 --> 03:41:14,200
Wait, I'm gonna try and get above you.

7509
03:41:15,340 --> 03:41:16,380
She's having a vision!

7510
03:41:16,860 --> 03:41:18,940
I'm having a vision, I'm gonna do it.

7511
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:20,340
What do you see, Raven?

7512
03:41:20,600 --> 03:41:20,740
What do you see?

7513
03:41:20,740 --> 03:41:21,620
No, no, don't do it, don't do it!

7514
03:41:21,620 --> 03:41:22,080
Are you ready?

7515
03:41:22,260 --> 03:41:22,400
I'm gonna do it.

7516
03:41:22,400 --> 03:41:24,180
Don't do it, we don't know where to go yet!

7517
03:41:24,700 --> 03:41:26,660
Wait, just make it to the bridge, Doki!

7518
03:41:26,820 --> 03:41:27,800
Go straight for the bridge!

7519
03:41:28,280 --> 03:41:29,020
What's the bridge?

7520
03:41:29,340 --> 03:41:31,680
You're probably abandoning Mint, but...

7521
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:32,940
Yeah, that's fine.

7522
03:41:33,300 --> 03:41:35,620
It's not like I've helped you out or anything.

7523
03:41:35,900 --> 03:41:37,240
Truck picking you up.

7524
03:41:38,140 --> 03:41:39,340
One of us has to...

7525
03:41:39,340 --> 03:41:41,660
Wait, do I take the lollipop and go this way?

7526
03:41:41,740 --> 03:41:43,080
The right side or the left side?

7527
03:41:43,700 --> 03:41:45,900
You have to go right side and climb up the bridge.

7528
03:41:45,900 --> 03:41:47,080
That's the only way to go.

7529
03:41:47,180 --> 03:41:47,780
This way?

7530
03:41:48,320 --> 03:41:48,780
This way?

7531
03:41:48,980 --> 03:41:49,140
Go where?

7532
03:41:49,820 --> 03:41:50,940
Can you see the road?

7533
03:41:51,340 --> 03:41:52,320
Yeah, we see it!

7534
03:41:52,520 --> 03:41:52,680
No.

7535
03:41:53,140 --> 03:41:55,800
We see it, but there was no way we're getting that road.

7536
03:41:56,060 --> 03:41:56,180
No.

7537
03:41:57,040 --> 03:41:57,460
Hold on.

7538
03:41:59,800 --> 03:42:00,560
Wait, wait, wait.

7539
03:42:00,720 --> 03:42:01,580
So do I go...

7540
03:42:01,580 --> 03:42:01,800
Okay.

7541
03:42:02,380 --> 03:42:03,560
Stuffy, do I go this way?

7542
03:42:03,800 --> 03:42:04,760
Oh, no, no, no.

7543
03:42:04,820 --> 03:42:05,600
You would go...

7544
03:42:05,600 --> 03:42:07,180
You would go this way, I think.

7545
03:42:07,340 --> 03:42:09,220
Either up to this legend when you eat the lollipop and go to the bridge.

7546
03:42:09,220 --> 03:42:10,040
I think you go this way.

7547
03:42:10,320 --> 03:42:12,460
Or you just go straight up where Doki went.

7548
03:42:13,780 --> 03:42:14,180
Sayonara.

7549
03:42:16,740 --> 03:42:17,500
I'll try.

7550
03:42:18,180 --> 03:42:18,920
There she goes.

7551
03:42:18,920 --> 03:42:20,060
I'll stay with you, it's okay.

7552
03:42:20,440 --> 03:42:21,560
I'll go when she goes.

7553
03:42:21,840 --> 03:42:22,960
Is there anywhere up there to sand?

7554
03:42:24,400 --> 03:42:24,760
Yeah.

7555
03:42:26,220 --> 03:42:26,900
Can you...

7556
03:42:26,900 --> 03:42:28,640
Is the road any better from here or no good?

7557
03:42:29,620 --> 03:42:31,060
A little bit, actually.

7558
03:42:31,300 --> 03:42:32,340
That's not terrible.

7559
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:33,500
Sayonara!

7560
03:42:33,900 --> 03:42:34,280
Doki!

7561
03:42:37,380 --> 03:42:37,860
Doki!

7562
03:42:39,140 --> 03:42:39,620
Doki!

7563
03:42:39,820 --> 03:42:41,400
Did you even eat the lollipop?

7564
03:42:41,580 --> 03:42:42,860
I did, but it's...

7565
03:42:42,860 --> 03:42:44,040
I had so little...

7566
03:42:44,040 --> 03:42:44,160
Doki!

7567
03:42:46,870 --> 03:42:47,850
Oh my god.

7568
03:42:48,010 --> 03:42:49,010
You should've given it to me.

7569
03:42:49,290 --> 03:42:49,690
Oh my god!

7570
03:42:50,970 --> 03:42:51,570
Um...

7571
03:42:51,570 --> 03:42:52,730
Can I...

7572
03:42:52,730 --> 03:42:54,050
I could rope cannon.

7573
03:42:54,350 --> 03:42:56,190
I can't see any rope.

7574
03:42:58,430 --> 03:42:59,030
Hmm...

7575
03:42:59,030 --> 03:43:00,410
I'm gonna burn, guys.

7576
03:43:01,550 --> 03:43:01,930
Oh!

7577
03:43:05,610 --> 03:43:06,210
Um...

7578
03:43:06,630 --> 03:43:07,270
How's that rope, Min?

7579
03:43:07,270 --> 03:43:07,610
How's that rope, Min?

7580
03:43:09,670 --> 03:43:10,030
Um...

7581
03:43:10,030 --> 03:43:11,390
It's like so...

7582
03:43:11,390 --> 03:43:11,890
Small!

7583
03:43:13,510 --> 03:43:14,250
Wait, I see you!

7584
03:43:14,310 --> 03:43:14,810
Wait, wait, wait!

7585
03:43:15,010 --> 03:43:15,250
I...

7586
03:43:15,250 --> 03:43:15,410
I...

7587
03:43:15,410 --> 03:43:15,810
Come back!

7588
03:43:16,490 --> 03:43:17,470
Down a little bit more?

7589
03:43:17,650 --> 03:43:18,250
You think so?

7590
03:43:18,890 --> 03:43:19,170
Yeah.

7591
03:43:19,510 --> 03:43:20,070
There's like a...

7592
03:43:20,070 --> 03:43:21,630
There's one on your left that's meant there.

7593
03:43:21,770 --> 03:43:22,870
It's not on the fire rack.

7594
03:43:22,950 --> 03:43:23,310
It's over here.

7595
03:43:23,310 --> 03:43:26,510
I thought the lollipop would give me a little bit of...

7596
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:27,730
Like...

7597
03:43:27,730 --> 03:43:27,950
Food.

7598
03:43:29,130 --> 03:43:29,570
Oh...

7599
03:43:29,570 --> 03:43:31,910
You know, you would think that it would do that, right?

7600
03:43:32,290 --> 03:43:33,490
Yeah, Min, give me your hand.

7601
03:43:33,970 --> 03:43:34,850
Min, is this okay?

7602
03:43:35,230 --> 03:43:35,630
I don't know.

7603
03:43:36,230 --> 03:43:36,430
I'm...

7604
03:43:36,430 --> 03:43:36,650
Oh!

7605
03:43:37,170 --> 03:43:37,970
Come on, come on!

7606
03:43:38,350 --> 03:43:38,990
Come on!

7607
03:43:39,170 --> 03:43:39,530
Yeah!

7608
03:43:40,310 --> 03:43:40,750
Okay.

7609
03:43:41,550 --> 03:43:43,590
Well, we're now just trapped up here together.

7610
03:43:43,950 --> 03:43:45,230
Yeah, we're now just trapped.

7611
03:43:50,570 --> 03:43:51,790
Hold on, watch this.

7612
03:43:52,070 --> 03:43:52,670
I feel like you're still alive!

7613
03:43:52,970 --> 03:43:53,410
With...

7614
03:43:53,410 --> 03:43:54,090
with...

7615
03:43:54,090 --> 03:43:54,310
Nene.

7616
03:43:55,810 --> 03:44:00,690
Rannah, you have some sort of special main character like, immunity in this game.

7617
03:44:00,810 --> 03:44:01,970
You keep falling and living.

7618
03:44:03,670 --> 03:44:04,110
Ummm...

7619
03:44:04,110 --> 03:44:05,270
No, uh, we're not gonna...

7620
03:44:07,790 --> 03:44:09,130
Nene, why do you have the stamina?

7621
03:44:09,530 --> 03:44:10,030
Nene, .

7622
03:44:10,030 --> 03:44:11,850
Nene, and I are gonna jump off!

7623
03:44:12,070 --> 03:44:12,990
Just, keep up her!

7624
03:44:12,990 --> 03:44:13,530
Wait, we are?

7625
03:44:13,670 --> 03:44:14,530
We're gonna jump off.

7626
03:44:14,770 --> 03:44:14,850
Wait, we are?

7627
03:44:14,850 --> 03:44:15,010
We're gonna jump off like me.

7628
03:44:15,370 --> 03:44:16,970
So the scoutmaster...

7629
03:44:16,970 --> 03:44:18,430
The scoutmaster will kill her.

7630
03:44:18,650 --> 03:44:19,510
Oh, that's right!

7631
03:44:19,630 --> 03:44:21,030
The scoutmaster will kill you!

7632
03:44:21,390 --> 03:44:21,710
Okay.

7633
03:44:22,090 --> 03:44:23,050
We're gonna do it!

7634
03:44:23,230 --> 03:44:24,210
We're gonna do it!

7635
03:44:24,210 --> 03:44:27,010
We are going to sacrifice ourselves for you!

7636
03:44:32,180 --> 03:44:32,520
Shit.

7637
03:44:37,940 --> 03:44:39,100
My friend.

7638
03:44:41,840 --> 03:44:43,120
She has to make it.

7639
03:44:43,120 --> 03:44:43,900
I'm so hungry now.

7640
03:44:44,020 --> 03:44:44,960
I don't know if I can do it.

7641
03:44:44,980 --> 03:44:46,720
No, she waited so long.

7642
03:44:48,980 --> 03:44:51,620
It's all up to you, Laibu.

7643
03:44:52,180 --> 03:44:54,240
It's all up to you.

7644
03:44:55,080 --> 03:44:55,720
Laibu!

7645
03:44:56,660 --> 03:44:57,300
Laibu!

7646
03:44:58,100 --> 03:44:59,380
You're so close!

7647
03:44:59,620 --> 03:45:00,720
Oh my gosh, it's right there!

7648
03:45:01,280 --> 03:45:02,020
It's right there!

7649
03:45:02,120 --> 03:45:03,600
It's literally right there, Laibu!

7650
03:45:05,220 --> 03:45:06,580
I can't quite reach it.

7651
03:45:07,080 --> 03:45:08,280
Oh my gosh, she's sleeping!

7652
03:45:08,680 --> 03:45:09,340
She's sleeping!

7653
03:45:09,360 --> 03:45:09,680
I'm okay.

7654
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:10,900
Use the rope cannon!

7655
03:45:11,180 --> 03:45:11,860
Use the rope gun!

7656
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:12,560
Use the rope gun!

7657
03:45:12,920 --> 03:45:14,620
Wait, there's a luggage right behind you!

7658
03:45:14,720 --> 03:45:17,780
Yeah, I want to go for the luggage instead, but...

7659
03:45:18,920 --> 03:45:20,520
I don't know if it's... I don't know...

7660
03:45:20,520 --> 03:45:21,560
I couldn't get up there.

7661
03:45:23,940 --> 03:45:24,360
Okay.

7662
03:45:24,360 --> 03:45:25,860
And someone said, drop the spool!

7663
03:45:26,100 --> 03:45:27,260
It'll make you less...

7664
03:45:27,260 --> 03:45:27,260
heavy.

7665
03:45:27,400 --> 03:45:27,980
Your stamina is pretty insane.

7666
03:45:28,120 --> 03:45:28,740
The rope.

7667
03:45:33,280 --> 03:45:33,900
It's time.

7668
03:45:34,040 --> 03:45:35,320
You can't wait too long!

7669
03:45:35,500 --> 03:45:35,780
Okay.

7670
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:37,340
It makes you a little lighter.

7671
03:45:37,920 --> 03:45:38,340
Maybe?

7672
03:45:39,720 --> 03:45:42,660
I... I need... I can get water in my pack, but I can't...

7673
03:45:42,660 --> 03:45:44,320
There's nowhere to safely put the pack down.

7674
03:45:44,700 --> 03:45:45,140
It sucks.

7675
03:45:45,140 --> 03:45:46,440
Let's go to that bridge.

7676
03:45:46,560 --> 03:45:47,860
You have to go to that bridge.

7677
03:45:50,740 --> 03:45:52,100
I don't think I'd make that.

7678
03:45:52,980 --> 03:45:54,140
I would use the gun.

7679
03:45:56,940 --> 03:45:57,660
You got it?

7680
03:45:57,900 --> 03:45:58,340
Oh my gosh.

7681
03:45:59,720 --> 03:46:00,500
Oh my gosh.

7682
03:46:00,580 --> 03:46:00,840
Gamer.

7683
03:46:06,590 --> 03:46:07,870
Oh my gosh, she's gaming?

7684
03:46:08,710 --> 03:46:09,530
Suck on the ledge.

7685
03:46:09,650 --> 03:46:10,410
Don't get stuck on the ledge.

7686
03:46:10,570 --> 03:46:10,650
Okay.

7687
03:46:11,190 --> 03:46:11,550
Nice!

7688
03:46:15,750 --> 03:46:16,110
Yes!

7689
03:46:17,750 --> 03:46:18,470
Oh my gosh!

7690
03:46:18,650 --> 03:46:19,310
She's gaming!

7691
03:46:20,430 --> 03:46:22,030
What if she misses this jump?

7692
03:46:22,210 --> 03:46:22,570
That would be pretty cool.

7693
03:46:22,590 --> 03:46:23,370
Don't shut up!

7694
03:46:23,530 --> 03:46:24,350
Don't say that.

7695
03:46:25,590 --> 03:46:26,470
Oh my god.

7696
03:46:26,830 --> 03:46:28,150
I can hear birds!

7697
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:29,290
I can hear birds!

7698
03:46:29,630 --> 03:46:30,290
I can hear birds!

7699
03:46:30,310 --> 03:46:30,330
I can hear!

7700
03:46:30,330 --> 03:46:31,650
Oh my god.

7701
03:46:31,730 --> 03:46:32,650
An energy drink?

7702
03:46:32,750 --> 03:46:33,450
There's rope cannon.

7703
03:46:33,550 --> 03:46:34,590
Rope cannon it from there.

7704
03:46:34,750 --> 03:46:35,810
Yeah, rope cannon it.

7705
03:46:36,810 --> 03:46:38,130
Where the... like here?

7706
03:46:38,510 --> 03:46:38,810
Here.

7707
03:46:39,030 --> 03:46:39,570
Uh, hold on.

7708
03:46:39,790 --> 03:46:41,750
The left side looks like the...

7709
03:46:43,690 --> 03:46:44,130
I...

7710
03:46:44,130 --> 03:46:45,290
I think the weird like...

7711
03:46:45,290 --> 03:46:46,350
There's a whole lot of pressure here.

7712
03:46:46,470 --> 03:46:46,890
Holy shit.

7713
03:46:46,890 --> 03:46:47,270
I know!

7714
03:46:47,770 --> 03:46:48,270
My god!

7715
03:46:49,590 --> 03:46:51,150
Shoot it right in the little like...

7716
03:46:51,150 --> 03:46:51,990
Balls right there.

7717
03:46:52,470 --> 03:46:53,130
The what?

7718
03:46:54,270 --> 03:46:57,650
The phallic looking rock formation I think is your best...

7719
03:46:57,650 --> 03:46:58,890
You don't have time to think too much.

7720
03:46:58,890 --> 03:47:00,150
Oh, I see the balls!

7721
03:47:00,310 --> 03:47:01,310
I think I get what you mean.

7722
03:47:01,510 --> 03:47:01,650
Yeah.

7723
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:05,530
Don't shoot too far because of the...

7724
03:47:05,530 --> 03:47:06,870
The length of the rope.

7725
03:47:09,530 --> 03:47:10,550
Like that you mean?

7726
03:47:10,710 --> 03:47:11,290
Okay, we're good.

7727
03:47:11,430 --> 03:47:11,510
We're good.

7728
03:47:11,870 --> 03:47:12,610
Oh, nice!

7729
03:47:13,110 --> 03:47:14,630
It's a very short rope.

7730
03:47:14,890 --> 03:47:15,890
Right on the balls.

7731
03:47:17,310 --> 03:47:18,810
That's exactly what I was saying.

7732
03:47:19,050 --> 03:47:19,950
See how it's phallic?

7733
03:47:20,090 --> 03:47:20,690
I'm saying this.

7734
03:47:20,750 --> 03:47:21,170
Oh gosh.

7735
03:47:21,450 --> 03:47:21,790
Oh gosh.

7736
03:47:22,530 --> 03:47:23,270
Oh gosh.

7737
03:47:23,590 --> 03:47:24,270
Oh gosh.

7738
03:47:24,270 --> 03:47:24,570
Oh gosh.

7739
03:47:25,070 --> 03:47:26,530
Oh my gosh.

7740
03:47:26,670 --> 03:47:27,750
She's literally right there.

7741
03:47:28,110 --> 03:47:28,850
She's so jealous.

7742
03:47:28,850 --> 03:47:29,170
I can hear...

7743
03:47:29,170 --> 03:47:30,230
I can hear freedom.

7744
03:47:31,070 --> 03:47:32,490
I can hear the birds.

7745
03:47:32,850 --> 03:47:33,930
You think she'll remember...

7746
03:47:33,930 --> 03:47:35,230
I can see fresh air!

7747
03:47:35,810 --> 03:47:36,610
Oh my god!

7748
03:47:36,870 --> 03:47:38,430
It's so beautiful outside.

7749
03:47:38,430 --> 03:47:39,770
You're gonna see it too!

7750
03:47:40,150 --> 03:47:40,750
Don't fall, don't fall!

7751
03:47:42,410 --> 03:47:43,830
That would've been so funny.

7752
03:47:45,250 --> 03:47:46,250
I'm scared.

7753
03:47:47,090 --> 03:47:48,390
I'm so scared for her.

7754
03:47:48,390 --> 03:47:49,510
I can't handle this pressure.

7755
03:47:51,390 --> 03:47:52,570
You get it!

7756
03:47:54,370 --> 03:47:56,050
You literally couldn't take it!

7757
03:47:56,170 --> 03:47:57,250
You jumped the...

7758
03:47:57,250 --> 03:47:59,030
You gotta sacrifice yourself!

7759
03:47:59,030 --> 03:48:00,090
We had to!

7760
03:48:00,170 --> 03:48:01,330
So she could go!

7761
03:48:02,590 --> 03:48:03,630
We had to!

7762
03:48:03,770 --> 03:48:05,290
So she could continue forward!

7763
03:48:08,990 --> 03:48:09,870
We're now...

7764
03:48:09,870 --> 03:48:10,410
Straight up?

7765
03:48:10,530 --> 03:48:11,090
There's a ledge right above you.

7766
03:48:11,090 --> 03:48:12,290
There's a ledge right above you.

7767
03:48:12,350 --> 03:48:12,690
Yeah, yeah.

7768
03:48:12,910 --> 03:48:13,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7769
03:48:13,810 --> 03:48:14,170
Right here.

7770
03:48:14,210 --> 03:48:14,890
Right here where I am.

7771
03:48:15,410 --> 03:48:18,030
Make sure to like visit our graves every year.

7772
03:48:18,870 --> 03:48:19,310
Okay.

7773
03:48:20,190 --> 03:48:21,730
Well your graves are on the mountain.

7774
03:48:21,770 --> 03:48:22,650
I'll have to climb again.

7775
03:48:24,390 --> 03:48:25,510
You're a pro!

7776
03:48:25,830 --> 03:48:26,350
You're a pro!

7777
03:48:27,210 --> 03:48:28,650
You've beat this game before!

7778
03:48:28,650 --> 03:48:29,610
Oh my gosh.

7779
03:48:29,750 --> 03:48:30,550
To the right?

7780
03:48:30,830 --> 03:48:31,190
To the right?

7781
03:48:31,570 --> 03:48:32,210
To the right?

7782
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:32,830
Yeah, you're right.

7783
03:48:33,250 --> 03:48:33,570
Yeah.

7784
03:48:33,970 --> 03:48:34,090
Oh.

7785
03:48:37,050 --> 03:48:39,050
Don't accidentally use your extra energy.

7786
03:48:40,270 --> 03:48:41,310
Yeah, I'm trying not to.

7787
03:48:41,870 --> 03:48:42,870
Oh my gosh.

7788
03:48:43,450 --> 03:48:45,310
Oh my god, it's really right there.

7789
03:48:45,990 --> 03:48:47,130
Oh my gosh!

7790
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:48,390
Oh my god!

7791
03:48:48,530 --> 03:48:49,550
I see the sky!

7792
03:48:50,230 --> 03:48:51,050
The sun!

7793
03:48:51,050 --> 03:48:52,930
The smoke though!

7794
03:48:53,170 --> 03:48:54,550
The smoke for the campfire!

7795
03:48:56,110 --> 03:48:56,570
Oh my god!

7796
03:48:56,570 --> 03:48:56,790
Oh my god!

7797
03:48:56,790 --> 03:48:56,870
Oh my god!

7798
03:48:56,970 --> 03:48:58,190
It's like the whole world is at campfire!

7799
03:48:58,190 --> 03:48:58,710
It's on fire!

7800
03:49:04,210 --> 03:49:06,890
This needs like some epic music I fear.

7801
03:49:07,510 --> 03:49:09,170
I know it does actually.

7802
03:49:09,170 --> 03:49:10,490
It's like the sky.

7803
03:49:10,490 --> 03:49:11,150
The sky is on fire.

7804
03:49:11,150 --> 03:49:11,550
Oh my god.

7805
03:49:13,570 --> 03:49:16,530
I see it!

7806
03:49:16,790 --> 03:49:17,730
I see it!

7807
03:49:18,230 --> 03:49:18,590
I see it!

7808
03:49:18,590 --> 03:49:19,590
Oh my god!

7809
03:49:20,230 --> 03:49:20,550
It's there!

7810
03:49:20,970 --> 03:49:21,710
It's there!

7811
03:49:21,750 --> 03:49:22,790
Oh my god!

7812
03:49:23,710 --> 03:49:24,650
Oh my god!

7813
03:49:41,050 --> 03:49:43,290
Oh my god!

7814
03:49:43,890 --> 03:49:45,710
Are those the poisonous ones?

7815
03:49:45,710 --> 03:49:46,070
It's so beautiful!

7816
03:49:46,170 --> 03:49:47,570
Look at all the flowers!

7817
03:49:48,110 --> 03:49:48,930
Are those poison?

7818
03:49:50,370 --> 03:49:52,030
I can't eat the mint.

7819
03:49:52,030 --> 03:49:53,370
What is it?

7820
03:49:53,970 --> 03:49:56,170
You should drink your energy drink right before.

7821
03:49:58,210 --> 03:50:00,430
A little bit of zoomies right at the top.

7822
03:50:00,650 --> 03:50:03,310
Yeah, get a little bit of zoomies before you make it.

7823
03:50:03,790 --> 03:50:04,690
I can't believe it, guys.

7824
03:50:04,850 --> 03:50:07,590
Look, our second try playing Peak and we finished the game.

7825
03:50:07,950 --> 03:50:08,250
I know.

7826
03:50:08,850 --> 03:50:09,290
We're so good at this.

7827
03:50:09,690 --> 03:50:10,010
We're crazy.

7828
03:50:10,710 --> 03:50:12,190
You guys were amazing.

7829
03:50:12,590 --> 03:50:14,090
We're crazy good at Peak, guys.

7830
03:50:17,990 --> 03:50:18,590
Yeah!

7831
03:50:18,630 --> 03:50:24,870
I do think that you guys sacrificing yourselves and having that bravery would got us this win, dude.

7832
03:50:25,450 --> 03:50:26,210
If you tried...

7833
03:50:26,210 --> 03:50:29,930
I wouldn't have left you if you hadn't jumped.

7834
03:50:30,750 --> 03:50:31,850
Let's go, man.

7835
03:50:31,950 --> 03:50:33,470
We did it.

7836
03:50:33,470 --> 03:50:34,750
Yeah, we did it.

7837
03:50:34,790 --> 03:50:35,410
Yeah, we did it.

7838
03:50:36,110 --> 03:50:36,670
Woo!

7839
03:50:39,330 --> 03:50:41,370
Oh my god, his lab will come in too!

7840
03:50:41,810 --> 03:50:42,030
Yeah!

7841
03:50:43,330 --> 03:50:45,030
Oh, it's so epic looking.

7842
03:50:45,710 --> 03:50:46,810
Help us here!

7843
03:50:47,470 --> 03:50:48,830
Pequod coming in high!

7844
03:50:48,830 --> 03:50:49,130
Yeah!

7845
03:50:50,490 --> 03:50:51,090
Scoutmaster!

7846
03:50:51,630 --> 03:50:51,730
Yeah!

7847
03:50:52,210 --> 03:50:52,970
We did it!

7848
03:50:53,370 --> 03:50:53,470
We did it!

7849
03:50:55,370 --> 03:50:56,290
Sir, please!

7850
03:50:56,510 --> 03:50:57,610
I'm starving to death!

7851
03:50:57,850 --> 03:50:58,810
Why is it a countdown?

7852
03:50:59,470 --> 03:51:04,750
One, six, five, four, three, two, one!

7853
03:51:05,190 --> 03:51:05,290
Oh!

7854
03:51:06,570 --> 03:51:06,990
One!

7855
03:51:07,690 --> 03:51:10,150
Have a friend escape the island without you!

7856
03:51:13,270 --> 03:51:14,150
Participation back!

7857
03:51:14,710 --> 03:51:14,790
Yeah!

7858
03:51:15,370 --> 03:51:16,250
Participation back!

7859
03:51:16,830 --> 03:51:16,970
Woo!

7860
03:51:21,490 --> 03:51:21,950
We did it!

7861
03:51:21,950 --> 03:51:22,710
We did it!

7862
03:51:22,830 --> 03:51:23,970
Wow, we did it!

7863
03:51:25,370 --> 03:51:27,130
Look at all the times we died.

7864
03:51:27,650 --> 03:51:27,930
Yeah.

7865
03:51:28,350 --> 03:51:28,510
Yeah.

7866
03:51:30,290 --> 03:51:32,390
Here's our badge for dying five times.

7867
03:51:35,410 --> 03:51:36,930
A greater challenge?

7868
03:51:37,130 --> 03:51:37,930
Are you kidding me?

7869
03:51:38,070 --> 03:51:39,230
Oh, I got promoted!

7870
03:51:39,430 --> 03:51:40,590
I got tadpole scout!

7871
03:51:41,170 --> 03:51:42,090
Oh my god, wait.

7872
03:51:42,490 --> 03:51:42,850
New hat!

7873
03:51:42,910 --> 03:51:45,870
Sense and add modifiers that make something more difficult.

7874
03:51:47,950 --> 03:51:48,730
Tadpole scout!

7875
03:51:48,890 --> 03:51:50,010
Oh, I didn't get to see you.

7876
03:51:50,230 --> 03:51:50,650
Bye!

7877
03:51:54,730 --> 03:51:55,290
Goodbye!

7878
03:51:56,730 --> 03:51:57,810
We did it!

7879
03:51:57,970 --> 03:51:58,930
We did it!

7880
03:51:59,070 --> 03:51:59,210
We did it, everyone!

7881
03:51:59,410 --> 03:52:00,470
We did it!

7882
03:52:00,950 --> 03:52:01,210
We beat Peek!

7883
03:52:01,210 --> 03:52:02,390
We beat Peek!

7884
03:52:02,770 --> 03:52:03,270
Woo!

7885
03:52:03,570 --> 03:52:04,130
Yeah!

7886
03:52:07,650 --> 03:52:11,350
I actually would not have that money on us doing that, like, immediately.

7887
03:52:11,930 --> 03:52:12,730
Holy cow!

7888
03:52:16,110 --> 03:52:17,390
Oh my god, we made it!

7889
03:52:17,410 --> 03:52:17,710
Guys, we carried!

7890
03:52:17,710 --> 03:52:18,250
We're home!

7891
03:52:19,130 --> 03:52:20,050
We carried, guys!

7892
03:52:20,590 --> 03:52:20,850
We did!

7893
03:52:21,130 --> 03:52:21,570
We did!

7894
03:52:21,610 --> 03:52:21,790
We did!

7895
03:52:21,790 --> 03:52:22,470
We did such a good job!

7896
03:52:22,470 --> 03:52:24,410
I never wanna fly again!

7897
03:52:24,770 --> 03:52:24,970
Yeah!

7898
03:52:25,130 --> 03:52:25,270
Yeah!

7899
03:52:25,450 --> 03:52:28,050
Like, maybe you don't ever go back to a fucking airport after that.

7900
03:52:28,370 --> 03:52:29,750
Dogpile online, Moo!

7901
03:52:30,150 --> 03:52:30,930
Dogpile online!

7902
03:52:34,100 --> 03:52:36,100
Thank you so much, everybody!

7903
03:52:36,620 --> 03:52:37,260
We did it!

7904
03:52:41,980 --> 03:52:42,520
Look at that!

7905
03:52:42,600 --> 03:52:43,420
Now I'm happy!

7906
03:52:44,380 --> 03:52:45,460
Now you're happy!

7907
03:52:45,620 --> 03:52:46,880
Oh my gosh, you're happy then!

7908
03:52:47,640 --> 03:52:48,060
Woo!

7909
03:52:49,920 --> 03:52:50,780
Sadness cured!

7910
03:52:51,980 --> 03:52:52,500
Yes!

7911
03:52:52,940 --> 03:52:54,020
And we fixed depression!

7912
03:52:55,360 --> 03:52:58,340
What we had to do was touch grass and lava and snow!

7913
03:52:58,340 --> 03:53:00,480
Well, I can't believe the Scoutmaster was right!

7914
03:53:00,740 --> 03:53:05,200
And, like, climbing a mountain and almost dying and actually dying would fix depression!

7915
03:53:05,460 --> 03:53:05,560
Yeah!

7916
03:53:05,560 --> 03:53:06,120
They were right!

7917
03:53:06,240 --> 03:53:07,360
Just go outside, clearly!

7918
03:53:07,640 --> 03:53:08,000
Just go outside, everybody!

7919
03:53:08,920 --> 03:53:12,140
Someone superchatted and said, Laimu was the great Sherpa!

7920
03:53:14,140 --> 03:53:15,520
Beverly was Everest!

7921
03:53:16,140 --> 03:53:17,540
She was the...

7922
03:53:17,540 --> 03:53:19,520
Yeah, she was the Sherpa!

7923
03:53:20,240 --> 03:53:23,100
We were the rich folks that kept dying on the mountain!

7924
03:53:23,180 --> 03:53:24,420
We were the rich Sherpa!

7925
03:53:24,900 --> 03:53:24,980
We were the rich Sherpa!

7926
03:53:24,980 --> 03:53:25,920
Trying to...

7927
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:28,660
The rich folks driving Everest!

7928
03:53:29,200 --> 03:53:29,840
On the Sherpa!

7929
03:53:30,020 --> 03:53:32,720
Like, put us on their back to carry us up the mountain!

7930
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:37,340
We did it, guys!

7931
03:53:37,340 --> 03:53:37,840
Oh my god!

7932
03:53:38,100 --> 03:53:39,040
Thank you, everyone!

7933
03:53:39,940 --> 03:53:40,080
I'm so happy!

7934
03:53:40,300 --> 03:53:41,560
Aloha, everyone!

7935
03:53:42,280 --> 03:53:42,780
Aloha!

7936
03:53:43,340 --> 03:53:45,080
You look like you're ready to go on vacation!

7937
03:53:45,660 --> 03:53:45,780
Yeah!

7938
03:53:46,100 --> 03:53:46,880
I'm ready to go!

7939
03:53:47,040 --> 03:53:48,540
Why did you pass out?

7940
03:53:48,540 --> 03:53:48,900
Oh, yeah!

7941
03:53:56,300 --> 03:53:56,700
Hey!

7942
03:53:57,060 --> 03:53:57,720
That was fun!

7943
03:53:57,900 --> 03:53:58,600
That was fun!

7944
03:53:58,800 --> 03:54:00,700
Thanks for carrying us live here!

7945
03:54:01,300 --> 03:54:01,660
No!

7946
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:02,480
Thank you!

7947
03:54:02,600 --> 03:54:03,560
It was your first time!

7948
03:54:03,740 --> 03:54:04,460
You guys did great!

7949
03:54:04,840 --> 03:54:05,540
You did so good!

7950
03:54:06,320 --> 03:54:06,700
You're right, Mint!

7951
03:54:07,240 --> 03:54:07,800
You know what?

7952
03:54:07,880 --> 03:54:08,300
You're right!

7953
03:54:08,440 --> 03:54:09,520
We did so good, Mint!

7954
03:54:09,520 --> 03:54:10,460
For our second time!

7955
03:54:10,460 --> 03:54:11,840
For our second time ever playing!

7956
03:54:11,860 --> 03:54:11,960
For our second time ever playing!

7957
03:54:12,200 --> 03:54:12,520
You did!

7958
03:54:13,160 --> 03:54:14,180
You were awesome!

7959
03:54:14,800 --> 03:54:15,000
Yeah!

7960
03:54:15,300 --> 03:54:18,120
I did 24 runs to ever finish it even!

7961
03:54:18,460 --> 03:54:19,420
So that was really good!

7962
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:19,540
Yeah!

7963
03:54:19,540 --> 03:54:22,040
And Limo did it all while sleep deprived!

7964
03:54:22,820 --> 03:54:22,940
Yes!

7965
03:54:23,400 --> 03:54:23,620
Yeah!

7966
03:54:24,220 --> 03:54:24,980
That's true!

7967
03:54:25,840 --> 03:54:30,740
I'm sleep deprived, but I also have adrenaline, so my body is like, what the fuck am I doing?!

7968
03:54:30,740 --> 03:54:30,960
Yeah!

7969
03:54:31,960 --> 03:54:33,120
We got the hat!

7970
03:54:33,140 --> 03:54:33,360
We got the hat!

7971
03:54:34,100 --> 03:54:37,100
Sacrificing herself so she wouldn't worry us!

7972
03:54:37,900 --> 03:54:38,560
Yeah, yeah!

7973
03:54:38,760 --> 03:54:40,720
I didn't want to be averted on you guys!

7974
03:54:40,880 --> 03:54:42,380
I was trying to motivate you, you know?

7975
03:54:42,740 --> 03:54:42,980
Yeah, yeah!

7976
03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:44,120
Fly on your own, you know?

7977
03:54:44,280 --> 03:54:45,420
Taking off the training wheels!

7978
03:54:45,860 --> 03:54:48,840
I knew you didn't have enough, but you didn't let us know!

7979
03:54:48,840 --> 03:54:49,460
Yeah!

7980
03:54:49,460 --> 03:54:50,760
You were like, don't worry guys!

7981
03:54:50,960 --> 03:54:52,140
I'll be right behind you!

7982
03:54:52,320 --> 03:54:53,280
And then you sacrifice yourself!

7983
03:54:53,280 --> 03:54:54,100
Just don't look back!

7984
03:54:58,240 --> 03:54:59,760
Thank you so much everybody!

7985
03:55:00,060 --> 03:55:00,940
I had an amazing time!

7986
03:55:01,180 --> 03:55:02,860
It was always wonderful with the sloppies!

7987
03:55:03,800 --> 03:55:04,080
Thank you!

7988
03:55:04,160 --> 03:55:04,580
Sloppies!

7989
03:55:05,060 --> 03:55:05,340
Sloppies!

7990
03:55:06,000 --> 03:55:06,420
Wait, wait!

7991
03:55:06,500 --> 03:55:08,100
Snuffy, are you continuing to stream?

7992
03:55:08,640 --> 03:55:09,700
Snuffy, are you still going?

7993
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:10,400
I wasn't...

7994
03:55:10,400 --> 03:55:11,600
You were streaming?

7995
03:55:11,800 --> 03:55:12,480
Okay, okay!

7996
03:55:12,500 --> 03:55:14,220
I was gonna raid, but...

7997
03:55:14,220 --> 03:55:16,100
And they still are on YouTube, so I can't raid them!

7998
03:55:16,240 --> 03:55:17,160
But I love you guys!

7999
03:55:17,380 --> 03:55:18,540
Thank you so much everyone!

8000
03:55:18,540 --> 03:55:20,560
Don't do what's wrong with your arm!

8001
03:55:21,380 --> 03:55:22,060
Oh!

8002
03:55:23,300 --> 03:55:24,100
Sloppy power!

8003
03:55:24,740 --> 03:55:24,900
Yes!

8004
03:55:25,340 --> 03:55:25,880
Sloppy power!

8005
03:55:26,180 --> 03:55:28,000
What's wrong with your arm power!

8006
03:55:28,220 --> 03:55:28,540
2!

8007
03:55:28,860 --> 03:55:29,260
1!

8008
03:55:29,560 --> 03:55:30,040
Sloppy!

8009
03:55:30,160 --> 03:55:30,840
Sloppy!

8010
03:55:34,740 --> 03:55:36,280
Good night everybody!

8011
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:37,360
Good night!

8012
03:55:37,860 --> 03:55:38,340
Bye-bye!

8013
03:55:39,060 --> 03:55:39,460
GG!

8014
03:55:40,760 --> 03:55:41,400
Bye-bye!

8015
03:55:41,780 --> 03:55:42,320
Bye-bye!

8016
03:55:44,260 --> 03:55:45,600
She left the expedition...

8017
03:55:45,600 --> 03:55:45,660
Oh!

8018
03:55:46,160 --> 03:55:47,060
It's just us!

8019
03:55:47,060 --> 03:55:48,180
What's wrong with your arm?

8020
03:55:48,820 --> 03:55:49,760
What do you mean?

8021
03:55:49,920 --> 03:55:50,960
It's my arm!

8022
03:55:51,740 --> 03:55:52,840
What's wrong with it?

8023
03:55:53,000 --> 03:55:53,980
Wait, come look in the mirror.

8024
03:55:54,720 --> 03:55:56,420
Okay, what's wrong with it?

8025
03:55:56,920 --> 03:55:59,220
Ever since I merged into the mountain...

8026
03:55:59,220 --> 03:56:00,320
See how mine is straight?

8027
03:56:01,900 --> 03:56:03,240
Wait, I don't see that...

8028
03:56:03,240 --> 03:56:03,680
What's wrong?

8029
03:56:03,820 --> 03:56:04,920
Oh, mine's a little curved.

8030
03:56:05,320 --> 03:56:06,080
A little?

8031
03:56:07,140 --> 03:56:07,460
Yeah.

8032
03:56:09,500 --> 03:56:11,900
Wait, no, I think it's whatever's on your screen.

8033
03:56:11,900 --> 03:56:13,840
It looks weird, but mine's like normal.

8034
03:56:14,180 --> 03:56:15,060
It's really...

8035
03:56:15,060 --> 03:56:15,680
She shot it.

8036
03:56:16,080 --> 03:56:17,460
She shot it, I need to see.

8037
03:56:17,900 --> 03:56:18,300
Okay.

8038
03:56:19,080 --> 03:56:19,480
Aloha.

8039
03:56:21,340 --> 03:56:22,880
This is what it looks like to me.

8040
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:25,760
Okay, I want to know what this looks like.

8041
03:56:26,220 --> 03:56:26,860
I'm confused.

8042
03:56:27,900 --> 03:56:28,920
Oh my god!

8043
03:56:32,060 --> 03:56:33,820
I think it's a broken arm.

8044
03:56:34,040 --> 03:56:34,640
I think so.

8045
03:56:34,660 --> 03:56:39,380
Ever since I merged with the mountain, things have not been the same for me.

8046
03:56:41,040 --> 03:56:42,200
Yeah, it tends to do that.

8047
03:56:42,220 --> 03:56:42,240
Alright, GG.

8048
03:56:42,240 --> 03:56:42,500
GG.

8049
03:56:42,620 --> 03:56:43,220
Okay, GG.

8050
03:56:43,620 --> 03:56:44,100
Bye-bye.

8051
03:56:44,360 --> 03:56:45,180
Bye-bye.

8052
03:56:45,760 --> 03:56:46,180
Bye-bye.

8053
03:56:46,960 --> 03:56:47,740
I'm gonna choke you.

8054
03:56:47,940 --> 03:56:47,980
Oh.

8055
03:56:48,820 --> 03:56:50,300
Well, I didn't have to choke her.

8056
03:56:50,400 --> 03:56:51,740
She died all on her own.

8057
03:56:55,860 --> 03:56:56,340
Wait.

8058
03:57:04,620 --> 03:57:05,380
I'll return.

8059
03:57:08,580 --> 03:57:09,240
I'll return.

8060
03:57:15,000 --> 03:57:16,620
Bing Bong is divorced!

8061
03:57:19,940 --> 03:57:20,580
No!

8062
03:57:21,920 --> 03:57:22,560
Why?

8063
03:57:24,040 --> 03:57:24,680
Wow!

8064
03:57:30,540 --> 03:57:32,300
That's one hell of a fact.

8065
03:57:32,560 --> 03:57:33,920
I hope you guys enjoyed that.

8066
03:57:34,700 --> 03:57:37,920
That was a pretty fun run, I'd say.

8067
03:57:37,920 --> 03:57:37,980
Bye.

8068
03:57:40,630 --> 03:57:44,060
I'm happy to have collabed with the sloppy sisters again.

8069
03:57:45,620 --> 03:57:48,280
I'm sad that I couldn't get the...

8070
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:49,600
The...

8071
03:57:49,600 --> 03:57:50,200
What's it called?

8072
03:57:50,820 --> 03:57:51,520
Um...

8073
03:57:51,520 --> 03:57:52,320
The...

8074
03:57:52,610 --> 03:57:53,920
Badge for the...

8075
03:57:53,920 --> 03:57:56,800
For the bugle at the capybara.

8076
03:57:57,040 --> 03:57:57,620
But it's okay.

8077
03:57:58,480 --> 03:57:59,580
It's fine.

8078
03:58:01,860 --> 03:58:05,280
I was, like, holding off on watching any peek streams.

8079
03:58:05,620 --> 03:58:07,140
So I was like, well...

8080
03:58:07,140 --> 03:58:10,020
We're gonna be playing it, so...

8081
03:58:10,020 --> 03:58:11,200
That was peek.

8082
03:58:13,260 --> 03:58:14,320
Weenie, thank you for the gift.

8083
03:58:14,400 --> 03:58:16,160
Thank you guys for all the super chats and...

8084
03:58:16,160 --> 03:58:17,800
Don't knows while playing.

8085
03:58:18,000 --> 03:58:19,180
Sorry that I couldn't really...

8086
03:58:19,180 --> 03:58:20,260
Acknowledge it.

8087
03:58:20,780 --> 03:58:22,900
I love my poisonous ghost Arinto.

8088
03:58:25,000 --> 03:58:25,480
I...

8089
03:58:25,480 --> 03:58:27,020
I'm always one for...

8090
03:58:27,020 --> 03:58:27,580
You know...

8091
03:58:27,580 --> 03:58:30,060
I'm more for entertainment than for survival.

8092
03:58:31,560 --> 03:58:34,320
Luckily, we had someone like Laimu who's a natural gamer.

8093
03:58:36,980 --> 03:58:39,260
Soppy Sisters is a great way to start the weekend.

8094
03:58:39,720 --> 03:58:39,940
Yeah!

8095
03:58:41,200 --> 03:58:42,440
Ghost Poison type.

8096
03:58:48,200 --> 03:58:48,940
But I...

8097
03:58:48,940 --> 03:58:49,740
I tried...

8098
03:58:49,740 --> 03:58:50,660
We tried towards the end.

8099
03:58:50,820 --> 03:58:51,580
It was just really difficult.

8100
03:58:51,820 --> 03:58:52,340
I think...

8101
03:58:52,340 --> 03:58:54,040
I think had I known...

8102
03:58:54,040 --> 03:58:56,180
The way that Laimu was going...

8103
03:58:56,180 --> 03:58:57,640
I might have been able to make it.

8104
03:58:58,080 --> 03:59:00,000
But maybe not at the end-to-end.

8105
03:59:00,620 --> 03:59:01,500
I don't think.

8106
03:59:01,620 --> 03:59:02,980
I think I would have been too hungry.

8107
03:59:05,520 --> 03:59:06,780
Thanks for the streaming though!

8108
03:59:06,920 --> 03:59:08,420
It was the perfect way to spend my birthday!

8109
03:59:09,540 --> 03:59:09,980
Brick!

8110
03:59:09,980 --> 03:59:11,180
Happy Birthday!

8111
03:59:11,900 --> 03:59:12,640
Happy Birthday!

8112
03:59:14,040 --> 03:59:15,640
Haven't laughed that much in a while.

8113
03:59:15,800 --> 03:59:17,080
I was literally crying...

8114
03:59:17,080 --> 03:59:18,720
Towards the middle.

8115
03:59:20,540 --> 03:59:21,320
I was...

8116
03:59:21,320 --> 03:59:22,320
I actually was...

8117
03:59:22,320 --> 03:59:25,020
Had real tears streaming down my cheeks.

8118
03:59:27,740 --> 03:59:28,780
But uh...

8119
03:59:28,780 --> 03:59:29,820
Yeah, it was a lot of good fun.

8120
03:59:30,420 --> 03:59:31,960
I hope you guys had fun too.

8121
03:59:32,640 --> 03:59:34,640
And thanks for hanging out with us!

8122
03:59:35,000 --> 03:59:36,580
Thank you, thank you for watching!

8123
03:59:36,580 --> 03:59:38,500
I really, really appreciate it!

8124
03:59:38,680 --> 03:59:39,240
Thank you!

8125
03:59:40,420 --> 03:59:42,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

8126
03:59:43,840 --> 03:59:44,240
And...

8127
03:59:44,240 --> 03:59:46,600
I will see you guys when I see you...

8128
03:59:47,920 --> 03:59:48,320
NEXT!

8129
03:59:48,320 --> 03:59:49,580
I'm still...

8130
03:59:49,580 --> 03:59:50,480
I'm still...

8131
03:59:52,600 --> 03:59:53,320
What's that sound?

8132
03:59:58,630 --> 03:59:59,230
Atsubito!

8133
04:00:00,250 --> 04:00:01,630
I'm gonna go...

8134
04:00:01,630 --> 04:00:02,550
I'm...

8135
04:00:02,550 --> 04:00:02,890
Rest...

8136
04:00:02,890 --> 04:00:03,190
Now.

8137
04:00:03,430 --> 04:00:05,170
Actually, I have some stuff I need to do.

8138
04:00:05,310 --> 04:00:05,930
And then I rest.

8139
04:00:07,630 --> 04:00:08,230
Atsubito!

8140
04:00:08,230 --> 04:00:11,190
I didn't expect us to play for this long either, so...

8141
04:00:12,710 --> 04:00:13,830
But it was a lot of fun!

8142
04:00:13,970 --> 04:00:14,650
Atsubito, everybody!

8143
04:00:14,930 --> 04:00:15,710
Thank you so much!

8144
04:00:16,290 --> 04:00:16,730
Atsubito!

8145
04:00:16,730 --> 04:00:17,130
Atsubito!

8146
04:00:40,980 --> 04:00:42,920
My mic knocked over my...

8147
04:00:44,280 --> 04:00:45,720
I had a mug...

8148
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:47,540
That I didn't know was...

8149
04:00:47,540 --> 04:00:48,200
It was behind...

8150
04:00:48,200 --> 04:00:49,320
Hidden behind my mic.

8151
04:00:50,800 --> 04:00:51,620
And it...

8152
04:00:51,620 --> 04:00:53,580
Fell over and I thought it busted.

8153
04:00:53,740 --> 04:00:54,820
I thought I heard it...

8154
04:00:54,820 --> 04:00:55,940
Bust, but...

8155
04:00:55,940 --> 04:00:57,140
It's a ghost mug.

8156
04:00:57,300 --> 04:00:58,560
And that's one of my favorite mugs.

8157
04:00:58,660 --> 04:00:59,540
I didn't want it to break.

8158
04:01:01,980 --> 04:01:02,720
We're good.

8159
04:01:05,180 --> 04:01:05,920
It's okay.

8160
04:01:06,360 --> 04:01:08,160
It has a bunch of ghosts all over it.

8161
04:01:08,260 --> 04:01:09,040
And it says...

8162
04:01:10,840 --> 04:01:12,380
It's one of my favorite mugs.

8163
04:01:14,360 --> 04:01:15,160
It's okay though.

8164
04:01:16,600 --> 04:01:16,900
Yeah!

8165
04:01:18,760 --> 04:01:19,240
Okay!

8166
04:01:19,520 --> 04:01:20,200
Uh, what was I saying?

8167
04:01:21,320 --> 04:01:21,800
Uh...

8168
04:01:21,800 --> 04:01:22,160
Otsubito.

8169
04:01:23,660 --> 04:01:24,140
Otsubito!

8170
04:01:24,260 --> 04:01:25,060
Thank you so much for watching!
