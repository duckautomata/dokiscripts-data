1
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,340
What was that sound?

2
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,740
What was that?

3
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,100
That was weird.

4
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,060
Anyway...

5
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,860
Oh, the menu!

6
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,100
Oh my god, it's so loud!

7
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,660
Hold on...

8
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,160
What would it be under?

9
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,270
Oh, pause!

10
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,290
I didn't know you were in here.

11
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,490
Hold on a second...

12
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,870
Welcome to Minecraft!

13
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,870
Give me one second.

14
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,030
Am I late?

15
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,910
No, I just started.

16
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,110
Oh my god.

17
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,370
I looked down and she was sitting.

18
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,710
I didn't know my cat was in here.

19
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,190
She was sitting and meowing at me.

20
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,450
And then I just looked down and she was just laying dead on the floor.

21
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,950
Oh, she's banana.

22
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,370
She's stretching.

23
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,090
Do you have anything you want to say, Pies?

24
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,250
Do you want to say anything?

25
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,530
No?

26
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,650
You're so cute.

27
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,390
Okay, let me let her out real quick.

28
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,570
Save her pitiful life.

29
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,410
She's just a babe.

30
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,550
Maybe she wants to stay.

31
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,930
I can't tell.

32
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,250
Do you want to stay in here?

33
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,130
I can't tell what you want.

34
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,030
I won't be able to let you out later, probably.

35
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,890
Stop looking at me.

36
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,530
What do you want?

37
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,770
Oh my goodness!

38
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,110
She's a stretchy girl!

39
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,930
She's a stretchy girl!

40
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,650
Nox, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

41
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,630
And Mike Dyson, thank you for the 10 gifted!

42
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,570
Thank you, guys!

43
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,710
Thank you.

44
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,410
I think I'll just let her out.

45
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,930
Sorry, I didn't realize she was in here.

46
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,750
Okay, give me one second.

47
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,240
Okay, we're good.

48
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Okay.

49
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Dodging Mike Dyson's legal name once more, mint.

50
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,620
Thank you!

51
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,080
Eating Mike Dyson's ass.

52
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,080
Thank you.

53
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,620
Mint, it's my birthday.

54
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,320
Happy birthday, Rail Arm!

55
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,080
Quick one.

56
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,440
Happy birthday to you.

57
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,800
Happy birthday to you.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,760
Happy birthday, dear Rail Arm.

59
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,940
Happy birthday to you.

60
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,220
Oh my god.

61
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,800
Sniper Monkey.

62
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,940
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

63
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,720
And 8-bit romance.

64
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,000
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

65
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,880
Why is everybody gifting?

66
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,920
What was going on?

67
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,100
Okay.

68
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
I have to figure out how to turn this down.

69
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,900
Maybe just the master volume.

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,360
But...

71
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,980
Oh, that's much better.

72
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,300
Weird logarithm.

73
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,180
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

74
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,780
Let me turn it up just a little bit more.

75
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,200
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

76
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,400
75?

77
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,940
Okay, this is better.

78
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
For Fox's sake.

79
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,420
Andragos, thank you both.

80
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,600
Thank you for the 5.

81
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,260
Thank you for the 10.

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,520
Spank!

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,020
Thank you for the 10.

84
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,920
What was I saying?

85
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh.

86
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,500
I have to tell Heno that I'm ready.

87
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,680
I think.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm not ready though.

89
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,760
Oh gosh, you guys.

90
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm so nervous.

91
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,020
Is she already on?

92
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,320
Oh.

93
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,180
Oh!

94
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,620
Heno.

95
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,300
Oh my gosh.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,320
You guys!

97
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,760
Oh my gosh.

98
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,180
This is my first time ever playing in the VSHOJO Minecraft server.

99
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,260
If you're unaware, they kind of recently, somewhat recently opened it up to other indie VTubers.

100
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,180
And so, I asked if I could join and check it out.

101
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,460
But there's all sorts of balls.

102
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,840
Balls.

103
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,480
Balls.

104
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,080
There's all sorts of mods and I don't know.

105
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know at all what they're like.

106
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,920
So.

107
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
And of course I'm with Heno.

108
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,100
Later on, Ironmouse might join us as well.

109
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,800
She said maybe in like an hour.

110
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,320
So.

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,140
We shall see.

112
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,240
Okay.

113
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,580
I'm just gonna join.

114
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm just gonna join.

115
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,140
I'm just gonna join.

116
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,820
I'm just gonna join.

117
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:39,950
Oh.

118
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,470
Oh.

119
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:40,730
Look at...

120
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,810
Who is that?

121
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,810
That's really...

122
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,450
The server is much different than I am at.

123
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,650
Oh!

124
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,670
Oh.

125
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,350
Oh.

126
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,630
Lange.

127
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,110
Oh.

128
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,910
Oh.

129
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:50,650
Oh.

130
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:50,950
Oh.

131
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,570
Oh.

132
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,510
Look!

133
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,650
You can see me in the corner!

134
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,510
Why am I on a building?

135
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,090
Where am I?

136
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,250
Why am I up here?

137
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,310
Um.

138
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,010
Your PC is dead.

139
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,990
Oh.

140
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,230
Oh.

141
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,510
Oh.

142
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,090
No.

143
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,370
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

144
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,670
Hey there, ghost lady.

145
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,410
Have a stream.

146
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,310
Thanks.

147
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,090
Thank you.

148
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,870
Wow.

149
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,930
Oh.

150
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,270
Wow.

151
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:19,930
Oh.

152
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,730
Wait.

153
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,830
This is crouch.

154
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,810
Wait.

155
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,430
Why a seat?

156
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,470
Pink concrete.

157
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,130
Brick stairs.

158
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,710
Wait.

159
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,090
Oh.

160
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,010
I'm laying down.

161
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,030
What?

162
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,110
There's like a lay down button.

163
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,490
Oh.

164
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:40,870
Hello.

165
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,250
Hello.

166
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,270
Oh, ho, ho.

167
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,190
Thanks for the 50 gifted.

168
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,090
Bye, Roblox.

169
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,990
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

170
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,810
I wonder if she is... if she's conscious.

171
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,610
I wonder if she doesn't know that I'm on...

172
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:55,910
Wait.

173
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,990
What is all this stuff that I have?

174
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,270
Wow!

175
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,370
One of the 90 stuff...

176
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,690
What is this?

177
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,270
I have an uncommon hat grab.

178
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,250
Wait.

179
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,770
No.

180
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,110
Hat grab bag.

181
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,610
I have an info guide.

182
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,490
All of this stuff.

183
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,510
I have a hamburger.

184
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,690
Oh yeah!

185
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,110
I have a candle holder.

186
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,150
Iron staff of building.

187
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,250
A decorative gift.

188
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,050
A warped mailbox.

189
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,270
And a style magazine.

190
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,470
What are those arrows to?

191
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,270
So curious.

192
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,510
Yay, you joined us!

193
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,570
I'm in!

194
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,090
I'm ready!

195
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,250
Henya!

196
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,110
I'm in Minecraft.

197
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,870
Oh!

198
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm on top of a building.

199
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,520
Henya, help me.

200
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,680
Why is there another Henya over there?

201
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,600
She found one of the pictures.

202
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,620
What do the pictures do?

203
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,160
Oh wait, this says V-Shojo cat ears.

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,140
Can I wear it?

205
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,640
On my hat?

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,620
No.

207
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,280
It's just a...

208
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,540
It's just a magazine.

209
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,260
A magazine of...

210
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,100
Wait, right-click to unlock cosmetic.

211
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,420
Oh.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,520
Hello!

213
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,140
Oh, someone else joined.

214
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,100
Someone else joined.

215
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,740
I did try right-clicking it.

216
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,460
This is me right-clicking it.

217
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,780
I'm on a building.

218
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,380
I think there is in-game voice chat, but...

219
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,360
Just in case...

220
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,900
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,380
What is that?

222
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,160
Oh my god, there's a creature down there.

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Okay, it's actually maybe better that I'm up here, because it might kill me.

224
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,370
Oh, in my hand!

225
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,560
Hello?

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,620
They disappeared.

227
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,510
Is that Henya?

228
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,690
Mindo?

229
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,230
Henya!

230
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,110
What?

231
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,250
Can you hear me?

232
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,610
She's not in here.

233
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,520
Oh!

234
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,140
Mindo?

235
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,520
Henya!

236
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm right here!

237
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,780
Wait, how do I...?

238
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,040
Oh, there she is!

239
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,380
Hello!

240
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,500
Oh.

241
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,580
Wait, you don't know about the voice chat.

242
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,120
Hold on.

243
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,480
Oh, I'm on push-to-talk.

244
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:09,800
Hello!

245
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, hello!

246
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,500
Hello!

247
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,060
Wait, I hear your voice from your side though.

248
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,320
Oh, wait.

249
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,820
I think I have to change my microphone.

250
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,280
Okay, that should be good.

251
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,500
Nice!

252
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,660
Oh, you look so cute!

253
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,420
You're so small!

254
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,400
Oh, you can change your height in here.

255
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,360
Wanna change it?

256
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:31,880
Okay.

257
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
How do I change?

258
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,200
This way, this way.

259
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,780
Wait, I don't know how to run.

260
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,420
Oh, now I know.

261
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,900
Okay.

262
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,360
There you go.

263
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,480
Okay.

264
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,200
What the...?

265
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,660
This way, this way.

266
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,620
She's a mermaid.

267
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh my god.

268
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,100
Yeah, I am a mermaid.

269
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,380
I can give you a necklace to turn into the mermaid.

270
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,600
What?

271
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,660
There you go.

272
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,300
Okay.

273
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,380
This is a regular size and you can be a small or bigger.

274
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,120
There you go.

275
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,920
You're bigger now.

276
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
Come here, Henya.

277
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm gonna squish you.

278
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,140
Come here, Henya.

279
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,600
Come here.

280
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:11,820
No, no, no.

281
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,680
Like the bug you are.

282
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,800
No, no, no.

283
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,340
No, no, no.

284
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,640
No, no, no.

285
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,460
I can hold you too.

286
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,460
Wait, is this...

287
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,980
Oh, look at you.

288
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,840
You're the same size as me now.

289
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,360
It's the same.

290
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,800
You're so small.

291
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,780
Yeah, it is.

292
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,420
Isn't this...

293
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,040
How do you jump high?

294
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,840
Wait, is this...

295
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,040
You're just short?

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,040
Yeah, you're shorter now.

297
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,520
This is the smallest...

298
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,360
I think you're like one block and a little bit.

299
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,180
I'm tiny.

300
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,460
You are.

301
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,100
You are.

302
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,980
Wow.

303
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,460
Oh.

304
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,620
Oh.

305
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,960
Hi, Addy.

306
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,600
Hello.

307
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh, hi.

308
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,320
I didn't know you guys were over here.

309
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,520
Hi, y'all.

310
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,980
Hi.

311
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,460
Yeah.

312
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,180
We're streaming and this is the first time me coming to the server.

313
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,780
Yeah, yeah.

314
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,460
Oh, welcome in.

315
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,000
Hello.

316
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,640
I was just admiring the art on your house over here.

317
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh, my God.

318
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,300
What the heck?

319
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
That's my house, by the way.

320
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,780
You see the purple house over there?

321
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,740
That's not...

322
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,460
That's not Michi's house.

323
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,880
No.

324
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,420
Yeah.

325
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,640
Yeah.

326
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,480
It's not.

327
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,620
It was my house.

328
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,060
It was my house and people putting on paintings on it and now it's...

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
People cannot see the magnificent house that I built.

330
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,280
Yeah, who would do that?

331
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,680
Who would put a painting on your house?

332
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,580
It's so messed up.

333
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,400
Yeah.

334
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,120
Wasn't it you?

335
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,880
I don't know what you're talking...

336
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,580
See, those aren't mine.

337
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,560
Those...

338
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,140
I didn't do those.

339
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,820
Would you like to see the house?

340
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,520
Yeah.

341
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,620
Give me one second because I have to change my keys.

342
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,880
Yeah.

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,360
Of course.

344
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,980
Of course.

345
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,840
Sprint...

346
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,720
Sneak...

347
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,540
Sprint...

348
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:46,620
Oh.

349
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,020
Oh...

350
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,300
Okay.

351
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,720
Okay, I'm good.

352
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,020
I'm good.

353
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,640
Oh, welcome.

354
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,820
This is my house, my beautiful house.

355
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,140
It's covered now, but it's my beautiful house.

356
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,400
Whoa.

357
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,120
Oh.

358
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,140
It's...

359
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,280
It's really...

360
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,140
Beautiful?

361
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,660
Mm-hmm.

362
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,500
What...

363
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,160
Why you're...

364
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,100
Why you're like that?

365
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,620
You're not something...

366
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,980
I was impressed.

367
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,660
Who is that?

368
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,340
Okay, that's...

369
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,180
That's...

370
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,240
Mochi.

371
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,560
And...

372
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,080
Maybe.

373
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,420
That's Katie.

374
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,820
Is that...

375
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,100
Is that Mochi?

376
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,680
Also, Mochi built a house for me.

377
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,280
Would you like to take a look inside?

378
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,600
Yeah!

379
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,080
It's right here.

380
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,380
Oh.

381
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,000
Enjoy.

382
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,480
What's that sound?

383
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,060
Right here?

384
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,120
Yeah.

385
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,020
Yeah, it's inside here.

386
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,780
It's inside here.

387
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,320
In here.

388
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:50,800
Okay.

389
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,500
Oh, I won't die.

390
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,080
Okay.

391
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't know what place is this.

392
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,460
I don't know what place is this, but...

393
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,980
It's something.

394
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,980
What is that sound?

395
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,740
You have like a wild animal in here.

396
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,950
You good?

397
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,150
Okay, let me take you back to there.

398
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,050
Oh my God.

399
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,030
You can grab people.

400
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,850
You can...

401
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,710
She's grab...

402
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,750
Oh my God, she's got me.

403
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,290
A leash.

404
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,130
Oh my God.

405
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,610
You press shift and then right click and you can hold people.

406
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,110
But it has to be empty hand.

407
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,590
Shift right click.

408
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,010
It's not working.

409
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,570
Oh really?

410
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,570
Do you have anything on your hand?

411
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,730
No.

412
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,310
No.

413
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,890
Oh, she meant sneak.

414
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,310
Oh.

415
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,950
Oh, my sneak's not working though.

416
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,930
I don't know why.

417
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,350
Oh.

418
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,730
Let me try this.

419
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,970
Oh yeah.

420
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,730
It has to be sneak and touch.

421
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,070
Like that.

422
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,790
Why is my sneak not working?

423
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,370
Oh.

424
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,970
I think the original key it should be a shift.

425
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,790
Yeah, but I changed it.

426
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,870
It's okay.

427
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,290
Oh, you changed it.

428
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,010
Yeah.

429
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,390
You can try it later.

430
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,810
Yeah.

431
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:31,890
Wow.

432
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,290
That was so much fun.

433
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,250
Also, we have a things that is closed.

434
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:36,330
Oh.

435
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:36,750
We have a way stone.

436
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,050
So, if you touch it, you can keep it here anytime you want.

437
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,330
Oh.

438
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,890
Henya Land.

439
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,030
Yeah.

440
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,750
Make sure you touch it every time when you see this.

441
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,250
I'm gonna always be here.

442
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,010
Henya Land.

443
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,550
Why are you licking it?

444
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,390
Because it's actually delicious.

445
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,430
It's a stone.

446
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,950
Yeah, but it says Henya Land on it.

447
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,490
Yeah.

448
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:03,790
Yeah.

449
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,170
Yeah.

450
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,550
Yeah.

451
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,010
Of course.

452
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,690
Of course.

453
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,310
Yeah.

454
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,530
I'm gonna do a summoning circle here.

455
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,770
Oh, Henya.

456
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:12,850
Henya.

457
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,130
Henya.

458
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,190
Oh, no.

459
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,830
Oh, no.

460
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,610
What did I just get into?

461
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,550
Nothing.

462
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,390
Nothing.

463
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,830
Nothing.

464
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,230
It's all good.

465
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,310
Oh, please don't bother me.

466
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,490
A lot of signs.

467
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,150
Zen faced it.

468
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,370
Ready for a fun...

469
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,670
Oh.

470
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,310
Oh.

471
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,290
Well, actually, you can't get inside because Ari gave me this magnificent sign.

472
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,710
But we can get in from here, I guess.

473
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,150
Okay.

474
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,530
Oh.

475
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:40,950
Whoa.

476
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:45,820
Whoa.

477
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,860
Here it goes.

478
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,480
Ta-da-da-da.

479
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,260
Whoa.

480
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,200
Welcome in.

481
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,340
Oh.

482
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,780
What was that?

483
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,100
Ew.

484
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,560
Oh.

485
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,100
That's my pet.

486
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,700
What's...

487
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,580
That's my pet, Salma.

488
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,220
What is your pet?

489
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,200
My pet is right here.

490
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,720
Right here.

491
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,160
Where?

492
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,420
Right here.

493
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,620
Right here.

494
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
My friend, Dayo and Jeff.

495
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,620
Oh.

496
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,200
Dayo and Jeff.

497
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Yeah, Dayo and Jeff.

498
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,440
Dayo and Jeff.

499
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,460
Dayo and Jeff.

500
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,320
Get inside.

501
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,240
Oh.

502
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,580
Jump.

503
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:24,840
Jump.

504
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,400
Skill...

505
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,300
Skill issue, Dayo.

506
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
Get good, Dayo.

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,300
I'm getting good.

508
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,510
What are they?

509
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,990
Dayo.

510
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,470
Oh.

511
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,770
Mouse is here.

512
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,710
Mousey.

513
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,330
It's okay, Dayo.

514
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,150
Yeah.

515
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,840
Day nine.

516
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,420
Day nine.

517
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,100
When you have a pickaxe and when you get close to them, they're going to get scared because they saw we're going to mine them.

518
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:05,920
Oh.

519
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,300
Do it.

520
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,200
No.

521
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,320
I don't want to kill...

522
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
I can use...

523
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,200
I have nothing to...

524
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh.

525
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,720
I have...

526
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,000
I have...

527
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,540
This.

528
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,660
Stay back.

529
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,740
Oh, that's for building.

530
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,700
That's for building.

531
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,340
Oh.

532
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,340
Yeah, that's Olympic.

533
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,920
I can give you one of these.

534
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,800
Okay.

535
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
And here's my...

536
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
There's so many...

537
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,360
So many signs.

538
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,600
I know.

539
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,520
Thanks to Zed.

540
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,900
Oh.

541
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,120
Whoa.

542
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,980
We have a lot of mods in here, so there's a lot of, like, new decorations and stuff.

543
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,440
Yeah.

544
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,280
Everything looks new.

545
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,920
Yeah.

546
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,980
I'm sick of it.

547
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,980
Have you ever played modded Minecraft before?

548
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,460
No.

549
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,520
This is my first time.

550
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,620
Oh.

551
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,940
It was first time for me, too.

552
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,880
But a lot of people will teach you because people are so nice in here, so...

553
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,260
Yeah.

554
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,060
You'll love it.

555
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,700
You'll love it.

556
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,420
Wow.

557
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:00,780
Oh.

558
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,680
Yeah.

559
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,020
Yeah.

560
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,300
Yeah.

561
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah.

562
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,040
And this is my kitchen.

563
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,540
Whoa.

564
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,760
I can't see anything right now because of the sign.

565
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,840
But this is my kitchen.

566
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,120
Oh.

567
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,940
I can't see anything.

568
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,480
Long.

569
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,800
Long.

570
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,060
Long.

571
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,680
Zed.

572
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,240
I have a panda.

573
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,980
Zed.

574
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,680
Yeah.

575
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,440
I have a panda.

576
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,800
Wow.

577
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,820
Uh-oh.

578
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,760
Henya, I think...

579
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,720
Do you want me to do your dishes for you?

580
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,980
Oh, yeah.

581
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,440
Really?

582
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,120
Thank you.

583
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,720
Yeah.

584
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,660
I'm a maid, you know.

585
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
It's been sitting there for, like, six months.

586
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,380
Thank you.

587
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,860
Thank you.

588
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,400
No problem.

589
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,160
I'll clean it with my tongue.

590
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,080
You know?

591
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,720
She's like a maid dragon.

592
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,180
Oh, yeah.

593
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,700
She's fine.

594
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,580
Oh, you're a maid dragon?

595
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:47,980
Oh, yeah.

596
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,180
I'm a maid ghost.

597
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,540
You know?

598
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:49,940
Same thing.

599
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,580
Thank you for cleaning.

600
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,200
Thank you for cleaning.

601
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,060
Maybe I can do it by myself, too.

602
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,500
Thank you.

603
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,180
My mom will take care of it.

604
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,580
Thank you.

605
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:57,860
Thank you.

606
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,400
Are you sure?

607
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,580
I'll clean the whole kitchen, you know?

608
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,480
No, no.

609
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,740
It's your first time.

610
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,760
You should...

611
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,340
You should enjoy this place a little.

612
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,160
What about we go somewhere else?

613
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,460
Okay.

614
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,400
Okay.

615
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,760
Okay.

616
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,280
No worries.

617
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,320
Well, I think Mouse is here.

618
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,580
Oh.

619
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,440
Look.

620
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,740
I think you can get out from here.

621
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,180
The door.

622
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,020
I got it.

623
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
I'll fix this one.

624
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,180
Mouse!

625
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,220
Oh my god.

626
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,160
You look like a Gaia Online crazy character.

627
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,100
Hello!

628
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,280
What is this?

629
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,040
Honey!

630
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,880
Here we go.

631
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,540
Oh my gosh.

632
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,180
So cute.

633
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:45,760
Hi, Mouse!

634
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,120
Yummy!

635
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,420
It's yummy?

636
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,020
It's yummy.

637
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,280
Oh

638
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,780
my god.

639
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,500
I was showing her a lot of places.

640
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,560
I was wondering where should I take her.

641
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,080
You want to see other people's house?

642
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,060
Yeah.

643
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,820
I want to see everything.

644
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
Everything, though.

645
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,060
Everything.

646
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,140
How about we go to this house?

647
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,960
Okay.

648
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,120
Oh wait.

649
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,760
Before that, maybe we can go look at the art gallery, too.

650
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,220
Oh.

651
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,420
Yeah.

652
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,040
You're going to have so much fun in here.

653
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,340
Oh my god.

654
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,240
There's so much.

655
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,320
Oh, you finished the art.

656
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,780
Let's see it.

657
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,440
So, this is the art gallery that Mouse built it.

658
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,000
You built it?

659
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,840
Oh my god.

660
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,280
Yeah.

661
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,020
And we put a lot of fan art in here.

662
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,500
There's a sign posted on the art wall.

663
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:47,800
Oh.

664
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,900
Wow.

665
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,240
Wow.

666
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,180
Wow.

667
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,220
Wow.

668
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,120
I wonder if I can take it.

669
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,260
Oh my god.

670
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,700
Wow.

671
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,300
It looks so cool.

672
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, so cute.

673
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,340
I know.

674
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,200
Every month she's going to put out the new art for the month.

675
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,860
And she keeps taking it every month.

676
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,260
Wow.

677
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,800
Oh my god.

678
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,720
It looks so go- Oh.

679
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,940
It looks so good.

680
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,920
I love this one.

681
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:15,920
This is the second one.

682
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,220
It looks perfect.

683
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,760
Yeah.

684
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,100
I like it too.

685
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,660
Here we go!

686
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,860
Thank you, thank you.

687
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,960
Oh, cute!

688
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,000
A bow in front...

689
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,780
This is where I'm gonna make my house, right here.

690
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,760
In front of this one.

691
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,460
Right here!

692
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,980
Oh my god, this is from Helldivers!

693
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,320
This is from Collab...

694
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,420
This is so cute!

695
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,520
I love it!

696
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,860
I made an honorable...

697
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,800
Honorable entry into the art gallery.

698
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,080
She's going to put a guest picture too, she said.

699
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,800
Oh, cute!

700
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,420
Yeah!

701
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,240
Wasn't it third floor?

702
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,440
Was it third floor, Malice?

703
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,040
For the guest picture?

704
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,720
Or in the first and second too?

705
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
Third floor, I'm not finished.

706
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,980
Oh, okay.

707
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm excited to see it then.

708
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,620
I'm excited to see it then.

709
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,100
Oh la la!

710
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,360
Cute!

711
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,580
I love how I can see the people's art in the Minecraft as well.

712
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,100
Like, you can download it and you can like...

713
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,460
You can...

714
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,760
You can see the favorite picture in the Minecraft as well.

715
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,480
Yeah!

716
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,800
That's what I said!

717
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,340
Sexy!

718
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,540
We need a R18 part of the gallery.

719
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,100
Don't apologize Mousey!

720
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,620
It's art.

721
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
Yeah, it's art.

722
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,720
It's art.

723
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,300
There actually will be one!

724
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,340
So cute!

725
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh, cute!

726
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,840
This one is like...

727
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,440
really fancy.

728
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,440
It's called Hentai and it's art.

729
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,400
Oh!

730
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,520
Oh, that's cute!

731
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,000
Yoho, yoho!

732
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,440
Pirate life for me!

733
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,280
Oh, I like this one!

734
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,680
I like how Hentai is like experiencing it too.

735
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,520
Yeah, this is my first time seeing it for this month.

736
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:35,800
Oh!

737
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,600
It's so cute!

738
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Does it take a long time?

739
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,820
Yeah!

740
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,940
A whole day!

741
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,860
There's so much too.

742
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,360
You said there was a second story?

743
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,920
Second floor?

744
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,740
Oh, I see!

745
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,560
Yeah, you can go there!

746
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Three floors.

747
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,620
Oh my gosh!

748
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,820
Wow!

749
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Boing, boing!

750
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,300
Boing, boing everywhere!

751
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,060
Boing, boing everywhere!

752
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,120
You have good taste, mouse.

753
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,380
You have good taste.

754
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,960
Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing!

755
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,400
Sometimes you get that article.

756
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,440
Cute!

757
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,390
Wow, indeed!

758
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,530
Wow, wow, wow!

759
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,750
Oh, I was like, what does she hold?

760
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,650
Oh, those are cuffs.

761
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,810
Oh my gosh!

762
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,110
So pretty!

763
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,330
Oh, this one is so cute!

764
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,390
What if you and Mata floating in there?

765
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,950
Oh my god!

766
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,950
That'd be so cute!

767
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,350
Cool!

768
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:54,970
Cute!

769
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,900
No, I love this one!

770
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,640
It's so cute!

771
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,040
Oh yeah, this one is so cute too!

772
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,560
Oh, it's for the...

773
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,140
That outfit is from the...

774
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,500
Anime collab one!

775
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,940
That looks so cute!

776
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,600
That looks so cute!

777
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,500
That's so cute!

778
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,040
Oh, I like the Zen one too.

779
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,980
Aww, this one is cute too!

780
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,520
Cute!

781
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,840
Everything is so cute!

782
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,800
I know!

783
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,340
I love modern Minecraft!

784
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,240
There's so much stuff that you can do!

785
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,460
Oh my god!

786
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,420
It's like they're 3D!

787
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,500
It's like they're gonna jump out of the screen at me!

788
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,160
It's like they're gonna jump out of the screen at me!

789
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,400
Hahahaha!

790
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,760
It's so big!

791
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,060
It's so big!

792
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,860
Cute!

793
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,790
You can't go back!

794
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,110
I remember seeing this one on Twitter!

795
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,630
Which one?

796
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,150
The comic of you and Haruka.

797
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,190
She says, Since we're here, let's go out!

798
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,510
And your eyes say no.

799
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:12,590
No!

800
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,110
Hahahaha!

801
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,330
This one is my favorite too!

802
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,270
No dial!

803
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,230
No dial!

804
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,850
Never dial!

805
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,410
Simple and easy!

806
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,990
No dial!

807
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,530
Oh, there's a ladder over here too!

808
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,070
Oh!

809
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,250
Here we go!

810
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,880
Oh, there are still...

811
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,380
Oh my god!

812
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,160
Oh, cute!

813
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,500
Wow!

814
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,600
Gengar!

815
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,980
Gengar!

816
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,160
That's my boy right there!

817
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,960
Hahaha!

818
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,080
Gengar!

819
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,280
Me too, Mousy!

820
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,580
Yeah, I love Gengar too!

821
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,960
I'll play a game with only Gengar.

822
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,880
Sometimes.

823
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,640
Really?

824
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,780
Yeah, I'll beat all Pokemon with just Gengar.

825
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,360
Hahaha!

826
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,120
Gengar!

827
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,760
Oh, Gengar!

828
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,660
Gengar!

829
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,240
So yeah, this is an art gallery we have.

830
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,620
It's so beautiful!

831
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,260
Also, down there...

832
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,940
Down there we have a post office too.

833
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,180
Would you like to look at it?

834
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,760
Oh yeah!

835
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,580
Let's go!

836
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,340
Okay.

837
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's go!

838
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,660
Let's go!

839
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,260
This way?

840
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,340
This way, this way!

841
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,340
There's so many buildings now.

842
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,480
There's so many buildings.

843
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,080
It's so active in here.

844
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,880
It is!

845
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,560
There's so many people in the server as well.

846
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,500
That's so awesome!

847
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah, it is!

848
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,020
Oh dear.

849
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,260
I'm gonna get lost.

850
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,800
It's so huge!

851
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,650
Here's the...

852
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,910
Here's the post office that we have.

853
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,650
I've also mouse filled this one too.

854
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,330
Oooh, I like these doors!

855
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:22,810
Fancy...

856
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,990
Fancy!

857
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,610
I think you can use this place to send them...

858
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:28,910
I think you can use this place to send them...

859
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,230
a gift and letter to people?

860
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,190
Wait, real?

861
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,190
I do have a mailbox.

862
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,270
But once you place the mailbox...

863
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:38,310
But once you place the mailbox...

864
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,210
When you put the stuff in here...

865
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,710
They will deliver it to your mailbox automatically.

866
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:44,890
They will deliver it to your mailbox automatically.

867
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,370
Yeah, click right here.

868
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,190
Click this one.

869
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:59,490
I'm gonna start sending creepy letters to everybody.

870
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,550
Yeah, it's so fun.

871
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,490
It's so fun.

872
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,810
It's so cool.

873
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,710
This is so cool.

874
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,730
It's so cool.

875
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,390
Oh my god.

876
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,110
There's Herobrine.

877
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,250
I think he works here.

878
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,930
Hey, do your job, Herobrine.

879
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,390
He helps out a lot.

880
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:32,830
Oh good.

881
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,430
Keep doing your job.

882
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,110
Maybe you'll get a raise one day, Herobrine.

883
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,660
Car.

884
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:47,820
Car.

885
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,160
The garage is so funny.

886
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,480
Yeah, we have a garage, a door, and also...

887
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,140
Oh, this is a portal for Nether.

888
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
So if you go in here, you go to the Nether.

889
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,840
Are we going?

890
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,580
We can if you want.

891
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,140
Here we go.

892
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,760
Oh, except me.

893
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,980
Somehow bound to S-Control or something instead.

894
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,620
I'm trying to bind it to just regular control.

895
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,860
Even the Nether is so different too.

896
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,720
Yeah, I was gonna say it's so different.

897
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,120
It's a lot different.

898
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,900
You'll love it.

899
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,480
It's so cool.

900
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,000
We even said that it introduced itself, the Nether.

901
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,280
No, no, no, no.

902
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,480
Look over there.

903
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,500
Blue Forest Palace.

904
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,350
It's so blue.

905
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,330
It's so beautiful.

906
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,130
It is, it is.

907
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,630
Wow.

908
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,110
They have a lot of cool stuff too, so...

909
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,850
I hope you enjoy it.

910
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,180
Oh, the lights!

911
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,460
Wait, who's that?

912
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,820
There's an old man walking around.

913
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,500
Old man?

914
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,740
Yeah, I think so.

915
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,780
The traveling merchant.

916
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,920
Oh, he's just in here?

917
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,440
He's chilling in here.

918
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,540
Wait, he's here?

919
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,700
He's in the Nether?

920
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,400
Oh my.

921
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,160
You're gonna die, mister.

922
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,700
Why the heck he's in here?

923
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,040
You're gonna die in here.

924
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,840
I'll employ Neato Villager.

925
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,280
Neato Villager.

926
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,000
Neato Villager, what are you doing in here?

927
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,440
Yeah, he's actually unemployed.

928
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,160
Why he's in here?

929
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,860
Ah!

930
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,620
Oh, what just happened?

931
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,960
What's that sound?

932
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,540
Oh, that's a hookshot.

933
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,740
Oh, I thought I was gonna... I thought I was about to die.

934
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,260
What was that?

935
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,620
Oh, the village looks really different, too, from the vanilla Minecraft.

936
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,620
It's a lot bigger.

937
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,020
Wait, so there's different biomes and stuff, too?

938
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,220
Would you like to see it?

939
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,660
Yeah!

940
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,080
Okay, oh.

941
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,680
When you...

942
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,300
When you type slash spawn...

943
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,920
You can go back to the spawn area anytime.

944
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh, okay.

945
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,400
Slash spawn.

946
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,600
That's it?

947
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,660
Yeah, and... and send.

948
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,860
Oh!

949
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,140
That's crazy!

950
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,700
See?

951
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,940
It's so good.

952
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,860
No, I did not see the pink house.

953
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,700
This is so cursed.

954
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,040
Everybody was talking about it.

955
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,020
The pink house?

956
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,440
Wait!

957
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,880
That looks so cute!

958
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,840
Oh, pink cows!

959
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,920
Okay, hold on.

960
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,780
Mint!

961
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,020
Mint!

962
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,460
Hello?

963
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,600
Mint!

964
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,920
Hello?

965
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,420
Mint!

966
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,200
Hit you!

967
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,430
It's so good to see you!

968
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,330
I...

969
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,110
Mint!

970
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,250
I'm being led.

971
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,490
I don't know what's going on.

972
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:45,810
Mint!

973
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,590
Welcome to the server.

974
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,290
I got these for you.

975
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,310
Me?

976
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,230
And I made you spaghet.

977
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,310
Spaghet?

978
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,890
You can make spaghet?

979
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,550
Wait, how do I get it?

980
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,030
Grab this...

981
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,210
Oh!

982
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,710
Who is stealing my spaghet?

983
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,250
Welcome!

984
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,030
Thank you!

985
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,990
It's so exciting that you're here!

986
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,690
Thank you!

987
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,750
Oh my gosh!

988
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,690
I'm gonna eat it.

989
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:15,690
Oh!

990
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,890
You put it in your mouth!

991
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,190
I... I... I got an achievement.

992
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,290
Wow!

993
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,470
Yummy!

994
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,390
Mamma mia!

995
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,670
Mamma mia!

996
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,550
Buon appetito!

997
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,300
Oh, thank you!

998
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,340
You're so welcome!

999
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,820
Has she seen the museum?

1000
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,020
Yeah, we just did.

1001
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,960
She just got here.

1002
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,120
So far we saw...

1003
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,760
Oh my gosh!

1004
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,320
The museum and nether?

1005
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,840
The museum is the best part.

1006
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,280
Yeah!

1007
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,380
You have to see the swamp!

1008
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, the swamp?

1009
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:52,920
Oh yeah!

1010
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Is this one over here?

1011
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,340
Uh, uh, hold on.

1013
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,260
I live in the swamp.

1014
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,800
You can get out from here.

1015
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,000
This way, this way.

1016
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,560
Ah, okay.

1017
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,000
There we go.

1018
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,380
Okay.

1019
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,400
There we go.

1020
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,360
Let's go swamp!

1021
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,540
Let's go swamp!

1022
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,560
Swamp!

1023
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,220
Oh my god!

1024
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,380
There's new content!

1025
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,740
Oh yeah!

1026
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,560
Give it to me!

1027
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,860
You can feed him fish or honey.

1028
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,260
I have honey.

1029
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,740
Honey!

1030
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,020
Yeah, if you throw a honeycomb at him, he holds it in his hand and he eats it.

1031
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,680
It's so cute.

1032
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,560
It's cute!

1033
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,420
It's so sticky cute.

1034
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,820
It's like the pandas.

1035
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,620
I think they do that too.

1036
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,380
Yeah!

1037
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,720
Yeah, they're so cute!

1038
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,300
That's true, that's true.

1039
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,560
Oh, oh.

1040
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,140
Light as a frog.

1041
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,900
What did I become?

1042
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,640
Oh, touch the waster!

1043
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:54,100
If you're ever missing any resources, you just go into that spooky little temple back there and you can just take whatever's in there.

1044
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,440
That one over there?

1045
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,660
Yeah.

1046
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,660
I made the house and the temple.

1047
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,680
Can I go see the temple?

1048
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,260
Yeah, whenever you need anything, you can just go inside there and you can just take it.

1049
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,620
It's free.

1050
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,500
You can just take it.

1051
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,260
Am I gonna die?

1052
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,160
No, no, no, no.

1053
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,580
You're just going to make a deal.

1054
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,700
Make a deal?

1055
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,940
Oh, that's easy.

1056
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,220
Yeah.

1057
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,650
In here?

1058
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:27,950
In here?

1059
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,610
Touch the computer.

1060
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,650
There's so much stuff in here!

1061
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,650
You should make one too.

1062
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,130
You don't need to make a warehouse.

1063
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,690
It's all the stuff I've collected.

1064
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,890
What the hell?

1065
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,210
Oh my god!

1066
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,690
There's so much here!

1067
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,170
There's a bunch of chests down here.

1068
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:57,610
And when you connect it with these terminals, you just need to put the random stuff in the chest.

1069
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,870
Or you can put it in from here.

1070
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,830
And they'll do all the organizing and everything by themselves.

1071
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,070
So you don't need to do it.

1072
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,410
Wait, my crouch isn't working.

1073
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,030
Hold on, let me try changing it again.

1074
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,110
I don't know why my keybind is acting funny.

1075
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,790
Wait, I didn't know you could actually go inside of the storage.

1076
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,230
Yeah, you can!

1077
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,610
Wait, how?

1078
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,630
I want to see how many chests you have.

1079
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,950
I want to see how nuts it is.

1080
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,950
It's from here, it's here, it's here.

1081
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,470
Do you see the, like, a pipeline?

1082
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:27,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,950
You go down there.

1084
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,490
Wait, let me see your chest.

1085
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,590
Let me see your chest.

1086
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,750
Oh!

1087
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,930
There's a ha- Oh!

1088
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,530
Oh my gosh!

1089
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,410
It's setting to add S, I don't know why.

1090
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,130
Froggy!

1091
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,370
Huh?

1092
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,700
What about pressing C?

1093
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,580
Can you do this?

1094
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,680
C?

1095
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,140
C!

1096
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,400
Yeah!

1097
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,140
Oh, I can do the C!

1098
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,620
Did you change it?

1099
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,220
Something just happened!

1100
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,360
Oh, I don't know what's going on.

1101
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:14,860
Oh!

1102
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,580
Hold on!

1103
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,640
Oh no!

1104
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,080
I think I messed up!

1105
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,460
It's fine, it's fine.

1106
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,200
Oh, what's going on?

1107
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,060
What's going on?

1108
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,380
It's okay, it's okay.

1109
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,220
You can do it, you can do it.

1110
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,520
You can come over here anytime.

1111
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,640
Okay, I'll come right now.

1112
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,720
Oh wait, I think I...

1113
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,320
Yeah!

1114
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:51,940
Yeah!

1115
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,720
Yeah!

1116
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,300
Yeah!

1117
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,440
I think, wait, I think I... Okay.

1118
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,280
What the?

1119
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,760
Why is it not working?

1120
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,580
Click delete?

1121
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,220
Take your time, take your time.

1122
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,100
I'm sorry!

1123
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,680
It's okay, it's okay.

1124
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,000
What's going on?

1125
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,440
Now both are bound to C.

1126
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,360
No, because I reset it though.

1127
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,540
Oh, it doesn't still work?

1128
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,620
Sorry, I was yelling at Ari.

1129
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,080
Oh, see this is what's bound to open wardrobe.

1130
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,220
We'll do... we'll do zero.

1131
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,180
No, let me peep that chest.

1132
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,900
Yeah, I'm trying to peep that chest.

1133
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,540
Peep that chest?

1134
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,620
What do you mean peep that chest?

1135
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,820
Oh my god!

1136
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,180
Oh my god!

1137
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,820
I

1138
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:03,190
do like, peep.

1139
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,770
Holy crap!

1140
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,070
What the heck?

1141
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,090
I don't know.

1142
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,330
Reset, reset.

1143
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,470
Oh, wait a minute.

1144
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,350
I can DP you, I guess.

1145
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:11,950
Hold on.

1146
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,070
Oh, I guess that's true.

1147
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,450
What do you mean I'll see something crazy?

1148
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,790
What do you have in here?

1149
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:16,410
Hold on.

1150
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,030
Let me go inside here.

1151
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,620
Let me just clear it.

1152
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,820
But I first...

1153
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,100
Wait, what's it?

1154
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,020
What's it DP?

1155
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,430
I don't know why the CNS are here.

1156
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,530
Oh, I did!

1157
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,070
Wait, so I do...

1158
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:47,770
Oh!

1159
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,830
Oh my god.

1160
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,130
My computer is chunking.

1161
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,550
I'm playing at 2 frames per second right now.

1162
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,290
This room is... this room is beefy.

1163
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,730
Holy smokes.

1164
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,330
What is this thing?

1165
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,390
Inventory cable.

1166
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,310
Oh my god.

1167
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,590
Yeah, when you have this, you just place a random stuff and you don't need to make a warehouse.

1168
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:16,050
I love this.

1169
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:16,450
I love this.

1170
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,690
You just need a big room that's full of chests.

1171
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,170
That's all you need.

1172
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,850
It's easy to set up too.

1173
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,470
You can fix everything.

1174
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,650
It's a computer that lets you access your stuff.

1175
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,390
What?

1176
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,210
That's crazy!

1177
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,530
Yeah!

1178
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,730
You should have one!

1179
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,270
You should have one!

1180
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,070
It's easy to make one!

1181
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,670
Oh my... modded Minecraft is amazing.

1182
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,930
It is!

1183
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,610
Oh, there's a waystone over here.

1184
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:41,970
You can put your stuff in the inventory.

1185
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,750
Oh, there's a waystone in here even?

1186
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,070
Yeah!

1187
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,150
Right here!

1188
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,520
Satan's services.

1189
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,420
Pressing the button while pressing delete.

1190
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,240
Okay, let me try.

1191
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:05,900
No!

1192
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,480
Mint keybinds are spugged and might be have to reset the config file?

1193
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,620
Wait, really?

1194
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,140
Yeah, they're kind of weird.

1195
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:14,420
Is it that bad?

1196
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,820
Yeah, it's a little weird, but only for sneak.

1197
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,680
I don't know why.

1198
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,000
Wow!

1199
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,720
Wow!

1200
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,730
You got a gift from Mousa!

1201
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:28,730
Oh!

1202
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,350
I got diamonds!

1203
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:31,830
Yeah!

1204
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,170
Oh, that's a lot of diamonds!

1205
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,270
Thank you, Mousa!

1206
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:35,870
Thank you!

1207
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:36,810
Yeah!

1208
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,470
Thank you!

1209
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:37,990
Yeah!

1210
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,710
Oh my god!

1211
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,350
Yeah!

1212
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,430
Yeah!

1213
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,150
I'm gonna hold on to them.

1214
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,370
Yeah!

1215
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,850
Wait, what's this?

1216
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,070
Oh, bouquet!

1217
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:48,990
Oh, give me this!

1218
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,810
Oh, Froggy gave you that!

1219
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:53,930
They're my color!

1220
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,690
Oh my gosh, you're right!

1221
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,270
Mousa!

1222
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:58,890
Welcome!

1223
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,210
Where am I?

1224
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,750
You have three minutes to escape before your command.

1225
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,390
Your computer explodes.

1226
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,310
What will you do?

1227
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,710
No, no, no, no!

1228
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,230
It's so laggy.

1229
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,450
Stop!

1230
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,430
You're making the lag worse.

1231
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,310
You're really making it worse...

1232
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,450
You're gonna explode your PC if you keep doing that!

1233
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,830
Oh, okay!

1234
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,250
So, slash-spawn?

1235
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,250
Yeah, slash-spawn.

1236
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:32,810
Okay!

1237
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,750
Oh...

1238
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,890
There you go!

1239
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,530
There you go!

1240
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,630
My house is next to...

1241
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,970
Yeah, let's go set it on fire!

1242
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,070
Lucky Fox Casino!

1243
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,230
We have casino!

1244
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,030
Why are you crying?

1245
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,450
Look at it!

1246
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,610
I got zero dollars!

1247
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,210
I'm broke!

1248
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,810
I lost my money.

1249
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:11,670
It's a skill issue.

1250
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,810
Well, let's see if you have a good luck.

1251
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,310
Okay.

1252
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,550
One item at a time.

1253
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,390
Send here and wait.

1254
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,210
Thank you!

1255
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:24,590
Thank you!

1256
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,290
What do I wait for?

1257
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:34,850
So you put the item, something valuable inside there and you spend right there.

1258
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,910
Okay, I'll throw a diamond.

1259
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,050
And wait for it.

1260
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,110
You got something!

1261
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,410
Look at it!

1262
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,650
What is this?

1263
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,090
Yay!

1264
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,390
I got a gold block!

1265
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:54,290
Oh my god!

1266
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:55,510
Nice!

1267
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,090
Nice!

1268
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,310
How do I get out?

1269
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,910
Oh yeah, yeah.

1270
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:05,750
Did I did it?

1271
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,070
Did it work?

1272
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,050
Oh, I hear something.

1273
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,630
Yeah, I think so.

1274
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,130
Oh yeah!

1275
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,490
I got it!

1276
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:12,850
Where

1277
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:31,050
did she go?

1278
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,510
Where did she go?

1279
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,430
I'm up here!

1280
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,230
Oh, hi!

1281
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:37,610
Hi!

1282
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,710
Welcome back!

1283
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,470
Welcome back!

1284
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,370
Thank you!

1285
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,410
I think... What happened there?

1286
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,830
Oh, it's fine.

1287
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:48,770
It's fine.

1288
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,670
Yeah, I noticed we don't lose anything.

1289
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,610
It's so awesome.

1290
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,190
Yay!

1291
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,390
No penalty.

1292
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:01,650
Yup.

1293
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,250
Yeah, when you die, you're not gonna lost your stuff like in the Vanilla Minecraft.

1294
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,690
Yeah, it's so nice.

1295
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,630
You keep your item.

1296
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:16,210
We used to have a gravestone, but we had too many gravestones and that caused a lag.

1297
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,510
So we had to remove it.

1298
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:22,510
Yup.

1299
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:22,790
Yup.

1300
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,050
Yup.

1301
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:23,590
I get it.

1302
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:24,890
That's okay.

1303
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:25,470
You know?

1304
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,190
Who cares about the dead, right?

1305
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:29,530
Yeah!

1306
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,690
Who cares about the dead?

1307
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,370
Yeah!

1308
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:34,410
And this one is a dead house.

1309
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,690
You have to go up from here.

1310
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:37,250
Okay.

1311
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,410
Where did she go?

1312
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,390
There's a technique to go up.

1313
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,370
Don't worry about it, Mossy.

1314
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,250
Wait, where is it?

1315
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:44,870
Where did she go?

1316
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,170
Up here, up here.

1317
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,370
You see that water pool?

1318
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,190
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1319
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,670
And you go up.

1320
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:55,730
Oh, okay.

1321
00:50:59,410 --> 00:50:59,930
Okay.

1322
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,150
I won't drown.

1323
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,020
It's like a... It's Laputa.

1324
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,740
Yeah, it's like a Laputa.

1325
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,180
Our house is like a Laputa.

1326
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,080
She has a little aquarium over here.

1327
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,000
There's a fish here.

1328
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,860
Oh, my God.

1329
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,860
Crab rave.

1330
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:25,280
Yeah.

1331
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,520
There are so many new mobs in the ocean too, so I hope you enjoy it.

1332
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah, it's so awesome.

1333
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,620
There's so many... Everything.

1334
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,500
There's so much.

1335
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah, it is.

1336
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:40,740
Wow.

1337
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:41,920
Sunfish.

1338
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,180
We have bosses and everything.

1339
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,700
Oh, my gosh.

1340
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:46,780
What?

1341
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,000
That's crazy.

1342
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Yeah.

1343
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,140
I want to be so many bosses.

1344
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,100
I have so many bosses to beat.

1345
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,410
What's this?

1346
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,810
And then, that's a... That's a Zen's house over there.

1347
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,870
You see the pink building?

1348
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,050
That's a Zen's house.

1349
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:05,790
Oh, okay.

1350
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:06,030
Okay.

1351
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,190
This one?

1352
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,490
Yeah.

1353
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:08,930
Oh.

1354
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,590
Oh, I thought I was about to die.

1355
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,290
Oh, be careful.

1356
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,790
There are so many holes in the ground.

1357
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,350
Oh, I saw this picture from down there.

1358
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:18,950
Oh, really?

1359
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,050
Yeah.

1360
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:21,290
Yeah.

1361
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,750
Thank you for a big present.

1362
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:28,550
I gave this art to every single one of them house.

1363
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,490
And...

1364
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,230
Yeah.

1365
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,970
What?

1366
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,230
So if I build a house, will I get one?

1367
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,150
Yeah, of course.

1368
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,230
You'll get one too.

1369
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,130
Oh, my God.

1370
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,770
It will be my honor.

1371
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,390
It's Giga-chan's house.

1372
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,490
It's Giga-chan's house.

1373
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,930
You're already a Giga-chan.

1374
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,810
Oh, thank you.

1375
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:48,830
You too.

1376
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,950
Oh, I didn't think...

1377
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,870
Zendaya clogged her toilet.

1378
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:53,530
Eww.

1379
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,370
Eww.

1380
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:56,870
Eww.

1381
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:58,770
Eww.

1382
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,530
Wait.

1383
00:52:59,690 --> 00:52:59,910
Wait.

1384
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,410
What is this?

1385
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:00,970
Isn't that a...

1386
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,210
Isn't that a...

1387
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:02,870
Oh, that's a...

1388
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:03,470
Is this a person?

1389
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,030
Oh.

1390
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:05,690
Oh.

1391
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:06,870
Oh.

1392
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,030
Ta-ta-ta.

1393
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:08,730
Whoa.

1394
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,170
I think he was using the bathroom.

1395
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,790
Oh.

1396
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,010
He didn't wash his hands.

1397
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:13,770
Nasty.

1398
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:14,570
Eww.

1399
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,270
Eww.

1400
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,670
I don't like it.

1401
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:18,930
It's so cute.

1402
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:19,490
It's so cute.

1403
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,030
Look at the microwave.

1404
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,950
What the heck, Zend?

1405
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,970
You got the salad in the microwave?

1406
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,770
Shaking my head, Zend.

1407
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,470
It's Entrea from V-Shojo.

1408
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,410
Shaking my head.

1409
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,210
I'll just set it.

1410
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,950
I'll set it to 500 minutes.

1411
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,650
Oh, nice.

1412
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,970
Nice.

1413
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,130
Make it to 1,000.

1414
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:39,830
Make it to 1,000.

1415
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:40,150
1 ,000.

1416
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,850
1,000 minutes.

1417
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,950
Beep.

1418
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:42,310
Beep.

1419
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:42,430
Beep.

1420
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,690
Oh, it almost fell out.

1421
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,130
Beep.

1422
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:45,210
Oh, it almost fell out.

1423
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:45,250
Beep.

1424
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,590
Are you okay?

1425
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,070
Yep, I'm okay.

1426
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,650
Are you okay?

1427
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,280
Don't worry about it.

1428
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,780
Yeah, welcome back.

1429
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,700
What is this?

1430
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,280
Oh, it's a cat.

1431
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,740
Why does it sound like that?

1432
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,380
Yeah, it's a cat.

1433
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,540
Oh, that's a limpet.

1434
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,720
That's a limpet as well.

1435
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,220
When you go up here... Oh, there's more.

1436
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,800
I think this is her bedroom, I guess.

1437
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,320
There's a... Wait, there's a Herobrine again.

1438
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,260
What's a maid here, O'Brien?

1439
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,220
Wait a minute, I thought he's at the...

1440
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,320
a post office.

1441
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,580
He's in tier 2?

1442
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,080
Maybe she's renting this to him.

1443
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,120
Maybe, maybe.

1444
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:36,960
Airbnb.

1445
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,020
Oh, this is a limpet.

1446
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,060
This is a limpet.

1447
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:39,740
Oh.

1448
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,020
Oh.

1449
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,320
It's...

1450
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,060
It's kinda... It's like Gary from Spongebob.

1451
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,560
Oh, wait, that's true.

1452
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,360
Meow.

1453
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,000
Meow.

1454
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,460
Meow.

1455
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,020
Oh, oh, oh.

1456
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,220
Oh.

1457
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,340
Zen.

1458
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:03,820
Zen.

1459
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,600
Do you think these will fit me?

1460
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,270
Do you think these will fit me?

1461
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,910
Oh my god, the cinnamon hole!

1462
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,770
Oh my god, it's so cute!

1463
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,450
Oh my gosh, no way.

1464
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,250
Yeah, it looks so cute!

1465
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,010
Look.

1466
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:30,910
I'm looking.

1467
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,750
Is he like a little buddy?

1468
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,910
It's melting cinnamon!

1469
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,450
It's so cute!

1470
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,430
The card for my birthday!

1471
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,290
Oh my god, that's so sweet!

1472
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,750
Aww.

1473
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,550
Oh my god, that's so cute!

1474
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:51,850
He's my god.

1475
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,550
I pray to your god.

1476
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,270
It's so adorable.

1477
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,250
It's so adorable.

1478
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,250
Oh my gosh.

1479
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,690
I like your... I like your Dejiko hat too.

1480
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,630
The Dejiko hat looks really cute too.

1481
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,010
So it is a Dejiko hat.

1482
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:08,910
I thought it was.

1483
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,170
Yeah, it is a Dejiko hat.

1484
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,790
I thought it was.

1485
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,650
I like it a lot.

1486
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,070
Me too!

1487
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,070
Oh my gosh.

1488
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,970
He even has the bells and everything.

1489
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,290
Oh, I think she's asking you.

1490
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:23,650
Sorry, sorry.

1491
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,210
There we go.

1492
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,490
No, it's okay.

1493
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,990
If you want to try it on, I'll sniff it after.

1494
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,150
No, it's your day!

1495
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,030
It's your day!

1496
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,750
Oh my god, it's so cute!

1497
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,050
Aww, cute!

1498
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:35,950
Oh, I thought it was so cute!

1499
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,510
I gotta find mine too.

1500
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,090
Dejiko hat is so cute!

1501
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,530
Wait, is it just to borrow?

1502
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,630
Or have?

1503
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,450
If I get another one...

1504
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,450
Aww, thank you!

1505
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,650
Thank you so much!

1506
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,110
Arigato!

1507
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,470
Fight to the death?

1508
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,670
Hey, fight to the death!

1509
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,010
I can... I have a death by burger.

1510
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,570
I wish I could take her panties and whack you with them.

1511
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,850
Well, you... I'm pretty sure you can make one really, really soon.

1512
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:21,110
It's easy to make one, so if you want panties, you get one.

1513
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:22,530
Can I wear them on my head?

1514
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:25,870
Oh, wait a minute!

1515
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,050
I have a perfect one for you!

1516
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,270
I have a perfect one for you!

1517
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:30,690
Hold on.

1518
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,270
Now I'm scared.

1519
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:32,050
Can you see the discord?

1520
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:33,450
Uh...

1521
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,610
Yeah, yeah, I can see.

1522
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:35,150
I think you'll love it.

1523
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:35,610
Okay.

1524
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,870
I think you'll love it.

1525
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,650
Everybody can use it.

1526
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,050
Okay.

1527
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:41,590
There you go.

1528
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,090
There you go.

1529
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,610
Here, perfect for you.

1530
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:48,030
Oh my god!

1531
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,190
I'm gonna put it on right now.

1532
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,270
Yeah, do it, do it, do it!

1533
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:52,930
Okay, okay, okay.

1534
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,630
Give me one second, everybody.

1535
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:01,290
This is important... this is important... stuff going on.

1536
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:08,540
I'm gonna... I'm gonna lurk your stream.

1537
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,940
I'm gonna lurk your stream.

1538
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,360
One moment, everybody.

1539
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,480
There he is.

1540
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,480
There he is, chat.

1541
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,480
He's doing it.

1542
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,460
That's a perfect fit!

1543
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,600
What do you guys think?

1544
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,660
Yay!

1545
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,220
Perfect!

1546
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,020
That's a perfect fit, I think.

1547
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,960
I'm gonna lurk too.

1548
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,020
Yay!

1549
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,320
Matching!

1550
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:40,680
Matching!

1551
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,860
Matching!

1552
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,140
This is my uniform, everybody.

1553
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,540
This is...

1554
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,760
This is...

1555
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,080
This is my magical girl uniform.

1556
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,380
You look perfect now.

1557
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
You look perfect now.

1558
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,560
Thank you.

1559
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,460
Oh, booty girl!

1560
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,680
Wait, that actually suits Enya so much.

1561
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:10,920
Thank you.

1562
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,840
Iron Mouse gave you a... she gave you a hat.

1563
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,420
Puchiko?

1564
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,420
Oh, thank you, Mouse!

1565
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,180
Arigato!

1566
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,460
Oh, it's a Puchiko from Dejiko Cat!

1567
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,040
Yeah!

1568
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:23,960
Isn't it?

1569
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1570
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,020
Thank you, Mouse!

1571
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,000
Arigato!

1572
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,280
That's so cute!

1573
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,240
I like it!

1574
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,760
Thank you, thank you!

1575
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:35,820
Kawaii!

1576
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,400
Arigato!

1577
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,260
Thank you, thank you!

1578
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,480
Oh, I'll never take it off.

1579
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,860
I'll never take it off.

1580
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:45,900
Puchiko!

1581
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,960
Arigato, Mouse!

1582
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:49,980
Yay!

1583
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:50,580
Yay!

1584
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,980
Now we're matching.

1585
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,720
We are, we are.

1586
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,640
Where else is there?

1587
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,060
Okay.

1588
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:06,540
Okay, the next one is... I think it's her... her house?

1589
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,380
I think this is the last one from this house.

1590
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:11,880
Okay.

1591
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1592
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,340
Oh, she also got a mini-mart as well.

1593
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,680
She made like a little market as well.

1594
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,100
Oh!

1595
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,880
It's this way.

1596
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,420
Okay.

1597
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,080
Oh, I see it!

1598
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,160
Everything's in the sky.

1599
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,540
She's building a sky village.

1600
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,280
Whoa!

1601
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,460
Sky town.

1602
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,740
Oh, what kind of snacks do they have here?

1603
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:50,980
They got, they got some cool snacks, they got shopping cart, they got wine, they got apple, radish.

1604
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,360
Oh, they have everything.

1605
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,180
Apples.

1606
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,560
They got everything in here.

1607
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,420
And we got the cash register over here.

1608
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,080
I'm just gonna steal.

1609
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,580
Yeah, steal there.

1610
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,800
She's not gonna notice.

1611
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,940
Yeah, she's not gonna notice.

1612
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,580
Let's take it all.

1613
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,560
Let's rob this place.

1614
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,440
This place is so tall, I can't see anything.

1615
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,360
Me neither.

1616
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,180
This place is so tall.

1617
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,860
We need a small people market.

1618
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:22,560
Yeah!

1619
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,440
Everything is so tall now.

1620
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,740
But that means...

1621
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,560
The...

1622
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,360
Maybe we get bigger size and so...

1623
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,800
It lasts longer for us.

1624
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,380
Because we're so small.

1625
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,280
This is the best one.

1626
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:37,920
Hmm.

1627
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,640
So that's a big house and...

1628
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,090
I'm okay.

1629
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,250
Obviously.

1630
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,440
I'm okay.

1631
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,420
No problem.

1632
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,460
No problem.

1633
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,040
No problemo.

1634
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,420
No.

1635
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,340
No problemo.

1636
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,940
We should make her a mermaid.

1637
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,100
Yeah, we should.

1638
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,180
How do I make it again?

1639
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,720
Mermaid.

1640
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,300
She can make it.

1641
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,480
Oh my god.

1642
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,220
She's a genius.

1643
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,220
Oh, so are you.

1644
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,640
Maybe...

1645
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,860
Mouse is more of a genius.

1646
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,820
Wait, what do you mean?

1647
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,380
I am the genius though.

1648
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,300
Yeah, but she's making it.

1649
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,500
She made the mermaid.

1650
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Thank you.

1651
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,460
I just wear this?

1652
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,340
And then I become a mermaid?

1653
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,320
There you go.

1654
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,660
You're a mermaid now.

1655
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh, I am.

1656
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,260
Oh my god.

1657
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,560
Oh, look at my tail.

1658
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,080
Yeah, look at you.

1659
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,200
You can change your color too.

1660
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,060
Yeah, you'll never drown.

1661
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,120
And you're so fast, Mouse.

1662
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:04,600
Yeah.

1663
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,940
Oh my god.

1664
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,540
You guys, I'm a mermaid.

1665
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,180
Oh my god.

1666
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,360
I wanna be where the people are.

1667
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,860
Under the sea.

1668
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,480
Under the sea.

1669
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,620
Under the sea.

1670
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,140
Under the sea.

1671
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,220
Thank you, Mousey.

1672
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,300
Thank you.

1673
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,620
Thank you.

1674
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,340
Yeah.

1675
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,500
Thank you, Mousey.

1676
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:29,520
Yeah.

1677
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:29,540
Thank you.

1678
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,900
Yeah.

1679
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,340
Wow.

1680
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,260
Modern Minecraft does everything.

1681
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,160
And this one right here is Melody's house.

1682
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,420
Oh, oh my god.

1683
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,000
The cinnamoroll.

1684
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,820
Yeah.

1685
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,960
Melody built it.

1686
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,940
Melody built it.

1687
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,280
What is this brick?

1688
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:47,360
Wait.

1689
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,420
Cyan.

1690
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,880
It's a white concrete and white purple box.

1691
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,560
Cyan.

1692
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:55,280
Cyan.

1693
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,420
Cyan.

1694
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:56,560
Cyan.

1695
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:56,580
Cyan.

1696
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,760
Cyan.

1697
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,100
Silt.

1698
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,340
So cute!

1699
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,360
Yeah!

1700
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,640
It is, it is!

1701
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,780
Oh my god, it's so pretty!

1702
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,400
Oh my gosh.

1703
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,020
All the houses look so nice.

1704
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,500
I love the windows!

1705
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,960
F5.

1706
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,300
For what?

1707
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,160
Now home!

1708
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:21,760
Cute!

1709
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,140
What's this?

1710
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,280
A silver envelope.

1711
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,220
What is this?

1712
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,100
Oh cute!

1713
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,130
There's a cat.

1714
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,150
Oh the cats sleeping are so cute!

1715
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,350
Oh my god, wait.

1716
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,810
I know!

1717
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:42,810
It's so cute!

1718
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,590
I'm inside Mel's bed.

1719
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,630
I don't know, this might be kind of dangerous.

1720
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,390
It's okay.

1721
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,250
She doesn't know, she doesn't know.

1722
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,370
We are in.

1723
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,090
We are in.

1724
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:58,630
We are in!

1725
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:01,790
How's the smell?

1726
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:02,590
It smells...

1727
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:05,390
Oh,

1728
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:11,810
also she has a pet as well.

1729
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,130
She has a pet as well.

1730
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:13,710
Huh?

1731
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,850
Yeah, come to the backyard.

1732
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:18,090
Backyard?

1733
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:19,530
Yeah.

1734
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:21,510
Go in here.

1735
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,330
Look!

1736
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,750
Oh, in here!

1737
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:26,730
Oh!

1738
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:28,050
Whoa!

1739
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:30,130
Oh!

1740
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:31,350
Oh!

1741
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,910
Is he gonna eat me?

1742
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,970
Bad dragon.

1743
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,410
Can I ride?

1744
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,890
I think he's not hungry today.

1745
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,670
Can I ride on his back?

1746
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:44,590
Yeah, you can try.

1747
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:47,770
Come on.

1748
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:48,390
Out!

1749
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,270
Come here.

1750
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:51,110
Out!

1751
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:51,710
Oh!

1752
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:52,310
Oh!

1753
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,660
Uh-oh.

1754
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:02,740
Whoa.

1755
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:03,980
Uh-oh.

1756
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:04,940
What's happening?

1757
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,920
Ow!

1758
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:07,220
Oh!

1759
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,360
He's scared.

1760
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,960
He's a bad dragon.

1761
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,820
Yeah, he's bad.

1762
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:13,960
You're mean.

1763
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,000
Bad dragon.

1764
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,100
Bad dragon.

1765
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,120
Bad dragon.

1766
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,120
I wanna make a hat out of him.

1767
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,080
This is Melody's place.

1768
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,900
I will kill him.

1769
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,600
It's okay.

1770
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,400
I can probably...

1771
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,020
I don't want to hit him either just in case.

1772
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,760
I don't know what his health is like.

1773
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,480
He's so cool though.

1774
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:36,980
I wanna...

1775
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,580
I want him.

1776
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,800
Maybe I can push him in back?

1777
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:44,620
Oh!

1778
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:45,480
Okay.

1779
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,340
There you go.

1780
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:46,700
There you go.

1781
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,200
There you go.

1782
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,340
So yeah, this is Melody's place.

1783
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,560
I think she's building a new one.

1784
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:56,620
Somewhere.

1785
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,340
It's so cute.

1786
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:58,760
Oh my god.

1787
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,120
The trees even.

1788
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,600
Wow.

1789
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,580
Oh yeah, it's here, isn't it?

1790
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:06,940
Magnolia.

1791
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,520
It's so pretty.

1792
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,140
A lot of pretty trees.

1793
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:15,740
Yeah.

1794
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,980
We have so many trees and it's so pretty.

1795
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:20,680
We have so many trees and it's so pretty.

1796
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,780
So that's Melody's place.

1797
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:26,580
Cool.

1798
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,780
And the next one...

1799
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,380
Here we go.

1800
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,180
So the next one...

1801
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,500
Oh, this is Camilla's house.

1802
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,500
As well.

1803
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,720
With my amazing art that I have.

1804
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,300
Yes.

1805
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,940
And the next one...

1806
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:45,870
Oh.

1807
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,310
We're in the prayer room.

1808
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:50,170
This is Camilla's place.

1809
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:50,850
Oh.

1810
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:52,530
Wow.

1811
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,810
He had an open door field.

1812
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,750
But he stole my watermelon.

1813
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:04,450
So Mouse and I and Addy decided to cover his entire place with a watermelon.

1814
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:05,290
Oh.

1815
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:09,810
I think it looks so much better like this.

1816
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,670
Yeah, I like it too.

1817
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:13,770
Yeah.

1818
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,170
Like the art of him getting attacked.

1819
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:16,930
Like the art of him getting attacked.

1820
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,530
He's building a train for the server.

1821
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:20,270
And Giga-chan, HENYA.

1822
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,030
Yeah, Giga-chan.

1823
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:22,730
HENYA.

1824
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,550
Exactly.

1825
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,330
Yeah, Giga-chan.

1826
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:26,350
HENYA.

1827
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:26,350
Exactly.

1828
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:26,950
Oh my gosh.

1829
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,770
If I steal from HENYA, what will you create?

1830
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:31,430
Oh my gosh.

1831
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,430
If I steal from HENYA, what will you create?

1832
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:32,270
Oh, you'll see.

1833
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,790
You'll see it though.

1834
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:35,510
Oh, wow.

1835
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,830
Oh, he really likes these spinning things.

1836
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:42,670
Oh, he really likes these spinning things.

1837
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,710
Yeah, there are so many things in here.

1838
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,430
Yeah.

1839
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,330
Wait, he made a train.

1840
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,190
I want to get on.

1841
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,550
Wait, it's actually...

1842
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:53,910
He's making a train.

1843
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:55,390
It's a train run.

1844
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,010
Oh my gosh.

1845
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:56,910
It's a hell run again.

1846
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,030
What the heck?

1847
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,830
Oh, wow.

1848
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:01,710
It's so fast.

1849
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:03,410
It is.

1850
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,570
Why are there so many Endermen here?

1851
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:09,690
Why are there so many Endermen here?

1852
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,170
Oh, I hear a spider too.

1853
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,090
Is this dangerous?

1854
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:14,070
Is this dangerous?

1855
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,210
Wait.

1856
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,490
That's so cool.

1857
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,490
He's making a train.

1858
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,520
One shot kill.

1859
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,460
I will protect.

1860
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,700
Okay, Mousey.

1861
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,360
I leave it to you.

1862
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,840
Oh, am I...

1863
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,180
Oh.

1864
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,960
Are you...

1865
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:33,480
Are you okay?

1866
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,240
No, don't get hit by train.

1867
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,680
How do we get on the train though?

1868
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,220
It's so fast.

1869
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:46,960
It is.

1870
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,600
I tried it but I couldn't.

1871
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,180
Okay, I'm going to run at it.

1872
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,140
What the heck?

1873
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,820
So close.

1874
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,700
But yeah, he has a lot of stuff over here.

1875
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,940
Saving the Herobrine here.

1876
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:08,980
I think you can use it.

1877
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:09,800
Over here?

1878
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,380
He has a lot of cool stuff.

1879
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,760
I don't really know how to use it.

1880
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,100
Because...

1881
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,400
I don't know about freedom mod, but he got a lot of cool things over here.

1882
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:19,620
Yeah.

1883
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,100
Live, laugh, love.

1884
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,470
Oh my gosh.

1885
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,190
It's really working in there.

1886
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,190
What was that?

1887
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,470
I feel like I'm playing a new game.

1888
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,550
Yeah, this is completely different.

1889
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,710
I think you'll love it.

1890
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,870
Because this is so cool.

1891
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:41,890
Yeah.

1892
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,910
It's a lot of cool things over here.

1893
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:48,790
Oh, that's why.

1894
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:49,290
What is this?

1895
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:49,930
I don't know.

1896
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:50,570
The water.

1897
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,430
So it's okay if you go in.

1898
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,150
What the heck?

1899
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:57,870
What just happened?

1900
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,040
I was trying to push you in and then I thought something exploded.

1901
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:08,900
Oh, here we go.

1902
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,180
Oh, that's her hammer.

1903
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:11,740
Oh.

1904
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:14,980
Wanna try it?

1905
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,280
The hammer?

1906
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:19,880
Wow.

1907
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,200
Wow.

1908
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:29,490
No.

1909
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,050
What do you mean no?

1910
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,870
You killed me.

1911
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:36,530
Oh, there we go.

1912
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,130
Hello.

1913
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,530
Hello.

1914
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,590
Welcome back.

1915
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,460
You bonked me to death.

1916
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,600
Strong super bonker.

1917
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,760
Super bonker.

1918
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,440
Super bonker.

1919
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,360
Kiss my feet.

1920
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,340
Kiss my feet.

1921
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,480
Kiss my feet.

1922
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,300
Thank you.

1923
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,220
Thank you.

1924
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,100
Wow.

1925
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:17,180
What else is there?

1926
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:17,780
No, it's okay.

1927
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,280
Is this jail right here?

1928
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,220
I don't know what this is.

1929
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:25,800
Is it jail?

1930
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:25,880
I don't know what this is.

1931
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:25,880
Is it jail?

1932
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,020
I'm going in.

1933
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,080
It's a jail.

1934
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,980
Gonna make a huge prison?

1935
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,180
Oh, yeah.

1936
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,620
Nice.

1937
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,540
We should put Zen in there.

1938
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:36,980
Yeah.

1939
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,480
And Matara.

1940
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,740
Also, there's a lot of cool houses over there.

1941
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,400
Wanna see it?

1942
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:45,880
Yeah.

1943
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,000
I wanna see everything.

1944
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:48,540
Yeah.

1945
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:49,800
Here we go.

1946
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,160
This way.

1947
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,020
Whoa.

1948
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,900
So, that's the place we just went.

1949
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:58,600
Oh, wow.

1950
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,580
There's even a smiley up top.

1951
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:02,980
Savannah.

1952
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,000
Giraffes.

1953
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:07,980
Look.

1954
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,540
This is Addy's house.

1955
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,160
Whoa.

1956
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,540
There's a giraffe.

1957
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:14,900
There's a giraffe.

1958
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:15,720
There's an elephant.

1959
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,660
There's a lot of mumps in here.

1960
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,240
There are.

1961
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,200
They are.

1962
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:21,660
It's so cute.

1963
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,940
I know, right?

1964
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,260
It's so cute.

1965
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,320
He's dying, too.

1966
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:28,420
Yeah.

1967
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,360
What happened?

1968
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:35,060
What happened to you, giraffe?

1969
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:35,660
What happened?

1970
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,620
I love this tree.

1971
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,060
I like this one, too.

1972
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,000
What did you call it?

1973
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,500
.

1974
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,440
.

1975
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:51,540
.

1976
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:56,200
Hi.

1977
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,340
Hello.

1978
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,280
Hi.

1979
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,080
I like your tree.

1980
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:01,860
Yeah.

1981
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,420
I have them here for your materials.

1982
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,260
It's not gonna, like, stay looking like this.

1983
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,320
But I thought it would also be pretty to, like, grow some of these.

1984
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,520
And then get rid of the leaves and swap them out with some of these blue and purple ones.

1985
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:13,420
Oh.

1986
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,300
Yeah.

1987
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:15,500
Wait.

1988
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,860
This one is, like, blue color, too, for the leaves.

1989
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1990
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,220
I'm using it for mater- Mouse.

1991
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:23,760
Mouse.

1992
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:24,940
Mouse.

1993
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:27,880
Mouse!

1994
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,480
Why?

1995
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:29,480
Oh.

1996
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,960
What did I do?

1997
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:33,960
Oh, there's a thing.

1998
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,020
I've done nothing wrong.

1999
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,220
That's so cute.

2000
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:39,720
Thank you.

2001
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:41,660
I'm intruding.

2002
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,880
I don't have any furniture in it just yet.

2003
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,740
Because I'm working on a basement right now.

2004
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,900
Oh, a basement.

2005
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:48,520
Yeah.

2006
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:51,980
This is here.

2007
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,480
Excuse me.

2008
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,340
Where'd you go?

2009
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,140
I'm inside.

2010
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,840
Oh, you're inside?

2011
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,360
Oh, you're inside.

2012
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,300
Hello.

2013
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,020
Sorry.

2014
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,680
Do it for her.

2015
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:06,860
The shrine.

2016
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,220
You gotta do it for Mouse.

2017
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,480
I own Ari's soul.

2018
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:13,660
It's true.

2019
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,280
I need this one for Athenia.

2020
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,820
Oh, yeah.

2021
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,780
That would be really cute.

2022
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:19,500
Really?

2023
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:22,900
I'm gonna make yours, too.

2024
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,440
Then I can put it on my house.

2025
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:25,580
Really?

2026
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,100
Yeah!

2027
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,080
We can do it together.

2028
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:30,420
Oh, my God.

2029
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:33,800
Yeah,

2030
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,320
I don't have any furniture in here just yet.

2031
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,600
You're a husky.

2032
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,420
You're so cute.

2033
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,460
Yeah, it's Peanut.

2034
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:48,760
Peanut.

2035
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,380
I love it.

2036
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,100
Wait, how do you chase a dog again?

2037
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,200
So, I put the name tag.

2038
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,180
I named it Husky.

2039
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,460
And then I put it on the dog and it changed the name.

2040
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,600
That is so cute.

2041
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,300
Husky.

2042
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,740
You're so cute.

2043
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,580
And here's a problem.

2044
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,800
Your problem is dying.

2045
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
What's wrong?

2046
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,100
Listen, I would appreciate my problems going away.

2047
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,180
Your problem has nine lives.

2048
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,140
Would you like my problem, Athenia?

2049
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:25,760
But, but, but...

2050
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,580
It's your cat.

2051
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,640
It's your cat.

2052
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,660
Yeah, that's my problem.

2053
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,260
Poor problem.

2054
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,880
You're not a problem.

2055
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,560
Poor problem took me an hour to catch.

2056
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,620
He's facing the wall.

2057
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,380
He's in timeout.

2058
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,940
Yeah, he's in timeout.

2059
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:51,960
Yeah, but I've been working on this basement down here.

2060
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,220
Can we see it?

2061
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:54,620
Yeah.

2062
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,220
I don't have the hallway for it done just yet.

2063
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,740
So, it's kind of ominous.

2064
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:00,800
It's just this.

2065
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,400
It's a little scary getting down to it.

2066
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,440
But the down here looks really, really pretty.

2067
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,360
Oh, wait a minute.

2068
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,740
I love this fish tank.

2069
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,100
It looks so cool.

2070
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,340
I haven't finished decorating this just yet.

2071
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:14,680
What?

2072
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,220
That's so awesome.

2073
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,380
And then I'm underwater down here.

2074
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:18,740
Yeah!

2075
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,040
I'm gonna put a bunch of fun fish out there when I'm done.

2076
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,860
Oh my, I love it.

2077
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,080
That's such a good idea.

2078
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,620
It looks so good.

2079
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:28,740
What is that?

2080
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,400
Oh, it's one of those pretty glowfish out there.

2081
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,280
Oh, it's one of those pretty glowfish out there.

2082
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:34,600
It's so cute.

2083
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,500
It sings.

2084
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,220
Yeah, they whistle.

2085
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,280
It's so pretty.

2086
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,380
Oh my god, it's so cute.

2087
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,460
I'm gonna put a bunch of really cool fish out there.

2088
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,820
And then axolotl in here.

2089
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,860
Because axolotl eat other fish.

2090
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,340
So, I'm gonna decorate this tank and make it really pretty.

2092
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,240
And then keep only axolotl in here.

2093
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,900
There are so many axolotls in here.

2094
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,580
It's not only like four colors.

2095
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,620
They have so many designs.

2096
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,440
Oh, really?

2097
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,540
What if I break...

2098
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,160
But why would you?

2099
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,080
Uh-oh.

2100
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,380
Why would you break it?

2101
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,340
She's a tiny menace.

2102
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:14,560
Why would you do that?

2103
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,220
Just kidding.

2104
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:16,980
I won't do it.

2105
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,520
Give in to your inner demons.

2106
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,180
Your demons.

2107
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:23,560
Embrace it.

2108
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2109
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,320
I got a good distraction.

2110
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:26,800
Hold on.

2111
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,720
Let me put this up.

2112
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,720
Touch the doorbell.

2113
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,100
There you go.

2114
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,100
Does this appease you?

2115
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:35,980
Oh!

2116
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,380
Oh!

2117
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,360
Does this appease you, Mal?

2118
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:42,820
Oh, no!

2119
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,740
She stole it.

2120
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,720
Froggy!

2121
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,860
Why are you at my door?

2122
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:48,980
Froggy!

2123
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:52,340
Let yourself in.

2124
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,720
Can I come in?

2125
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,460
Yeah.

2126
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,780
My doorbell's a little violent.

2127
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,300
Oh, my God.

2128
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:00,760
It's so cute.

2129
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,620
Oh!

2130
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,360
It's so cute.

2131
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,440
It's like sitting on the ground.

2132
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,520
Oh, that's adorable.

2133
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,880
It's so cute.

2134
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,740
It deserves to be here.

2135
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,400
I love it.

2136
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,040
It looks like it's actually here.

2137
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:17,720
It does.

2138
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,080
It does.

2139
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,240
Who added the soup?

2140
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,200
Oh, my God.

2141
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:21,980
That's so cute.

2142
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,260
It is cute.

2143
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,020
Look at how short they all are.

2144
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,860
I found a music disc.

2145
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,920
Does anybody need this?

2146
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,920
Are you wearing a Sonic hat?

2147
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,080
Yeah!

2148
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,680
It makes me sparkle!

2149
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,460
It makes me sparkle!

2150
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,060
It's so sticky cute!

2151
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,840
That's why you're sparkling.

2152
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,580
That's so cool.

2153
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,640
It's so cute.

2154
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:43,780
It's so cute.

2155
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah, Moush gave it to me.

2156
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,000
Wait, you're wearing a Pikmin hat.

2157
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:55,460
I just realized that you've been wearing a Pikmin hat this whole time.

2158
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,400
No, it's a Puchiko.

2159
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,600
Puchiko from...

2160
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:58,860
What?

2161
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,900
But it's got the flower around the head.

2162
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:06,180
Look, Pikmi has like a long tail.

2163
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:06,860
Oh, my God!

2164
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,920
I thought it was...

2165
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,600
What do I do with it?

2166
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,040
Oh, you're right!

2167
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:10,440
You're right!

2168
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,920
I thought it was the yellow Pikmin.

2169
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,440
Oh, he's hot!

2170
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,100
Also, how do you have Cinnamoroll like flying around you now?

2171
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:20,900
Yo, what?

2172
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,880
How did you do that?

2173
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,860
Where did all these Cinnamorolls come from?

2174
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,080
Wait, I'm...

2175
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,580
Oh, my God, I'm snowing!

2176
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,080
Oh!

2177
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:30,780
Oh, cute!

2178
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,340
Oh, wait, that's adorable!

2179
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,520
You've got a little snowman on your head!

2180
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,800
Snow high, Sean!

2181
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,260
That's so cute!

2182
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,720
That is so cute!

2183
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,520
There's snowflakes around you.

2184
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,240
That is so, so cute.

2185
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:44,860
That's cute!

2186
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,120
Oh, my gosh, you have so much stuff.

2187
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,880
How do you get the hats?

2188
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,260
You have to find them, I think.

2189
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,020
Yeah, you have to find them.

2190
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,400
And there's a lot of places that you can go.

2191
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,180
There's a cave.

2192
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,100
And there's a treasure chest inside there.

2193
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,240
So you can get it from there.

2194
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:04,820
Excuse me!

2195
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,300
Excuse me!

2196
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,720
Okay.

2197
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,640
I'll ask.

2198
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:13,980
I'll come to you.

2199
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,500
I'll make a pact.

2200
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,800
I'll sell my soul.

2201
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,360
I only have...

2202
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,500
I am a soul.

2203
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,840
I wouldn't say that, Min.

2204
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,070
Only one favor...

2205
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2206
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,680
I'll make a deal.

2207
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:29,960
I'll make a deal.

2208
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,200
Wonderful.

2209
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:37,800
Wonderful.

2210
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,040
Yeah.

2211
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,060
It's okay.

2212
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:41,960
I'm already dead.

2213
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:42,880
It's okay.

2214
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:45,940
Can't say no.

2215
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,100
Don't worry.

2216
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:47,540
Okay.

2217
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,040
Yeah.

2218
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,020
Yeah, yeah.

2219
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:50,700
Years from now.

2220
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,240
No worries.

2221
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:52,900
No worries.

2222
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:54,360
Yeah, yeah.

2223
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,480
No worries.

2224
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,100
What could go wrong?

2225
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,440
Nothing.

2226
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,640
I trust... yeah.

2227
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:02,380
4k favor.

2228
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,780
Yeah, that's not an exaggeration.

2229
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:04,280
It's true!

2230
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:04,860
It's true!

2231
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,680
I have quite the debt.

2232
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,360
4k?

2233
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:11,900
Oh my my.

2234
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,340
You owe a lot, Ari.

2235
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:17,640
Yeah, the amount of gold blocks that I asked for is a lot.

2236
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,260
Oh, that's true.

2237
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:18,840
That's true.

2238
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,000
You owe a lot.

2239
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,320
Yeah, she made my beacon for me.

2240
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,100
I didn't even make it.

2241
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,340
She made it herself.

2242
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,780
The block underneath it too, right?

2243
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:28,400
Yeah.

2244
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,760
Mouse made it, right?

2245
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:30,080
Yeah.

2246
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,560
She did all of that.

2247
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:32,500
Yeah.

2248
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,340
Yeah, she got the nether star and everything.

2249
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,680
She killed the wither for me.

2250
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,080
Yeah.

2251
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,240
Mouse kinda owns me.

2252
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:41,700
I remember...

2253
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:46,120
I spawned the wither thinking that I could kill it.

2254
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:46,320
I spawned the wither thinking that I could kill it.

2255
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,920
And then I started killing these so Mouse had to come save me and kill it for me.

2256
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:52,760
And then I started killing these so Mouse had to come save me and kill it for me.

2257
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,860
Wait, how do you sit down again?

2258
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,280
Wait, how do you sit down again?

2259
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,180
Oh, you look at the ground and you double tap shift.

2260
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,540
Oh, you look at the ground and you double tap shift.

2261
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:01,940
Brains.

2262
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:03,980
So beautiful.

2263
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:04,860
I ain't got one.

2264
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,380
I need one.

2265
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:10,700
I don't

2266
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,030
know how she did it.

2267
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:31,410
She was like spamming sit, so I guess she just...

2268
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,650
Oh my god, Enya.

2269
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,330
I give you this.

2270
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,010
Rest in peace.

2271
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:40,510
Oh wait, how do I throw it?

2272
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:41,350
How do I throw things?

2273
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:42,290
Hello.

2274
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:47,730
You're giving away the flower bouquet I got you!

2275
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:48,810
No, it was for...

2276
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,810
You're giving away the flower bouquet I got you!

2277
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,690
It was for her grave.

2278
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,390
I took those flowers and you keep them.

2279
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:58,030
You keep them.

2280
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,430
You hear me?

2281
01:23:58,610 --> 01:23:59,910
I'm sorry, Froggy.

2282
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:00,950
I'm sorry, Froggy.

2283
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:01,790
I'm sorry, Froggy.

2284
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,850
I'm sorry, Froggy.

2285
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,050
You idiot.

2286
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,530
How do you sit?

2287
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,270
How do you sit?

2288
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,250
You look at the ground and you double tap shift.

2289
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:12,570
You look at the ground and you double tap shift.

2290
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:12,730
Oh.

2291
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,410
Oh wait, my thing doesn't...

2292
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,550
Oh, my thing doesn't work.

2293
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:17,930
That's right.

2294
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:20,010
My crouch is broken.

2295
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,690
You end up going to the ground like Enya.

2296
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:26,330
Wait, why did I go up to the ground?

2297
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:29,530
I think you just spam sit so much you just face through the ground.

2298
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:30,350
What?

2299
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:31,030
What happened?

2300
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:38,370
You can get like some wool blocks and put them down as little bean bags.

2301
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:38,850
Oh.

2302
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:40,690
What's going on?

2303
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,070
You got it.

2304
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:42,990
You got it.

2305
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:46,110
Something's happening to me.

2306
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,290
She's freaking gone.

2307
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:51,910
What's going on?

2308
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:52,990
I can't move.

2309
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,910
Why are you going in reverse?

2310
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,810
I can't go anywhere else.

2311
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:58,770
I can't.

2312
01:24:58,770 --> 01:24:59,390
I'm stuck.

2313
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:00,250
I'm stuck.

2314
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,210
I can't go anywhere else to go.

2315
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:04,970
I can't go anywhere else to go.

2316
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:05,330
Oh, my God.

2317
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:07,130
Oh, I'm normal again.

2318
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:10,630
Thank you.

2319
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:10,990
Thank you.

2320
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,490
I'm learning their motor controls.

2321
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:13,450
I am.

2322
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:20,460
Yeah!

2323
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:20,940
Yeah!

2324
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,780
I finally fixed my storage.

2325
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,420
I think.

2326
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,580
If I remember.

2327
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,320
I wanna see it.

2328
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,340
I wanna see it.

2329
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,160
It's either really hideous in the basement or I fixed it.

2330
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:32,760
And I can't remember.

2331
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:33,100
I can't remember.

2332
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:36,140
Great.

2333
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,740
Uh-uh.

2334
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,120
Uh-uh.

2335
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,440
Not if I didn't fix it.

2336
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:41,680
Just like Pete.

2337
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:42,680
No.

2338
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,540
If I didn't fix it.

2339
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:43,840
Oh, yeah.

2340
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,080
Yeah.

2341
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,240
It's good as Pete looks.

2342
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:45,520
Yeah.

2343
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:45,740
Yeah.

2344
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:45,940
Yeah.

2345
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:46,080
Yeah.

2346
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,360
What's that sound?

2347
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,380
What's sniffing so much?

2348
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,360
It's the bear in my house.

2349
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,120
It's Akko riding.

2350
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:54,280
Oh, yeah.

2351
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,780
Did you show them Akko riding?

2352
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:56,580
What?

2353
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,920
He's been wandering the house.

2354
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,800
I don't know who let him in.

2355
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,840
Oh, I found him when he's almost dead.

2356
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:03,360
Oh, no.

2357
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:04,500
No.

2358
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,580
Oh, there he is.

2359
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,940
What is this?

2360
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,780
According to all known laws of aviation.

2361
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,700
No, it's not according.

2362
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,460
It's Akko riding.

2363
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,820
Don't make fun of me.

2364
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,260
Oh, you met him.

2365
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,780
He's so cute.

2366
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,640
Yeah, you won't see him.

2367
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:24,260
You won't see him.

2368
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,480
Thank you.

2369
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,000
Just throw one at him.

2370
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:28,980
Throw it?

2371
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:29,280
Okay.

2372
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,080
Yeah, you just throw it at him.

2373
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,940
Yeah, when he's done eating that one, he'll pick it up.

2374
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,960
Slurp it down.

2375
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:35,920
Slurp it down.

2376
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:36,460
Oh, my God.

2377
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,500
He's so cute.

2378
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,080
Oh, father.

2379
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,380
So cute.

2380
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:43,580
I love you.

2381
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:44,560
I love you.

2382
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:45,760
I love you.

2383
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:47,780
Honey.

2384
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,800
How do you heal him?

2385
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,580
I think I need to throw a splash potion of healing on him.

2386
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,140
Oh.

2387
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,020
Oh.

2388
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:00,280
Oh.

2389
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:00,600
Oh.

2390
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,420
He's sniffing.

2391
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,000
Oh, yeah.

2392
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,420
Because Froggy is holding one.

2393
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,100
Yeah.

2394
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,280
Yeah.

2395
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:09,360
Yeah.

2396
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:12,000
His nose is so bouncy.

2397
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,400
Boing.

2398
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:12,820
Boing.

2399
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:13,120
Boing.

2400
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:13,360
Boing.

2401
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:14,600
Yeah.

2402
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:15,800
Boing.

2403
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,140
Boing.

2404
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,060
Boing.

2405
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:21,600
He's so cute.

2406
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,440
I love the little head.

2407
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,240
He's so cute.

2408
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:25,600
He's so cute.

2409
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:26,880
He's so good.

2410
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:27,020
He's so good.

2411
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:29,760
He's so cute.

2412
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:30,660
Wait.

2413
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,120
Have you ever seen Meatball?

2414
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,280
No.

2415
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:34,220
What's that?

2416
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,300
Meatball.

2417
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:35,320
What?

2418
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:38,280
Oh, yeah.

2419
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,060
A meatball.

2420
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,400
Meatball.

2421
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,180
Where is he?

2422
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:42,820
Where is he?

2423
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,560
He's over here.

2424
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,220
He's over here.

2425
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:44,960
Meatball.

2426
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,200
Meatball.

2427
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:46,880
Meatball.

2428
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,560
It's Demonic Wizard Meatball.

2429
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:52,660
Oh, right.

2430
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,300
Demonic Wizard Meatball.

2431
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,500
Demonic Wizard Meatball.

2432
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,880
Oh.

2433
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,440
Yeah.

2434
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:59,020
Yeah.

2435
01:27:59,020 --> 01:27:59,380
Yeah.

2436
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,140
Wow.

2437
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:02,440
He's named after Heavenly.

2438
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:03,380
Oh.

2439
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,280
I love how he looks directly at the camera.

2440
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:07,860
I love it.

2441
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:07,920
I know.

2442
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,220
If you press Z to zoom in on him, he'll just stare at you really weird.

2443
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:11,680
It's funny.

2444
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:12,080
Wait.

2445
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:12,540
You can zoom?

2446
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,040
Yeah.

2447
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:14,760
Hold Z.

2448
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,800
I'm zooming in on my map.

2449
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,780
I think my keybinds are all weird.

2450
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,600
Look at you.

2451
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:23,920
Wait.

2452
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:25,480
He's staring at you.

2453
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,420
Hold on.

2454
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,820
I want to see if he'll look at me.

2455
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,480
He's got an attitude problem today.

2456
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,020
Meatball.

2457
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,320
Oh, my God.

2458
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:37,800
He listened.

2459
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,900
Oh, my God.

2460
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,300
He's so good.

2461
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,480
You're a good listener, Meatball.

2462
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,240
He really likes you.

2463
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,160
Oh, my God.

2464
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,420
His eyes.

2465
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:51,400
Yeah.

2466
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,880
He's looking at you.

2467
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,240
Yeah.

2468
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,520
I love him so much.

2469
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,240
He's so silly.

2470
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,700
He's so cute.

2471
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:02,700
He's so cute.

2472
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,980
Froggy's place is this way.

2473
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:05,660
This way.

2474
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,840
It's the giant mushroom.

2475
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,680
Oh, I see it.

2476
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,500
I was waiting till you came back around.

2477
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,320
I expanded this corner of the grass a little bit.

2478
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,240
I expanded this corner of the grass a little bit.

2479
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,200
It didn't really disturb your bridge.

2480
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,320
I just had to relocate some lily pads.

2481
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,240
I don't mind if you touch my lily pads.

2482
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:25,880
Oh, cute.

2483
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:30,560
Fireflies.

2484
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,840
There's even fireflies.

2485
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,500
Oh, my God.

2486
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,840
I have a bunch of them if you want them.

2487
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,040
I actually made a ton.

2488
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,400
I actually made too many.

2489
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,400
I have a lot of them.

2490
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,100
You're a breeder.

2491
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,720
You bred the fireflies.

2492
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2493
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:44,600
I can go up here.

2494
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:45,480
Okay.

2495
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,480
I'm coming.

2496
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,740
Oh, so cute.

2497
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:54,400
Thank you.

2498
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,760
Thank you.

2499
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:56,500
You can sit.

2500
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,100
Oh, Robin.

2501
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,700
Oh, I'm sitting.

2502
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,290
We gotta show Buh.

2503
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,110
Let me see if I can even find Buh.

2504
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:10,550
I don't know where Buh is.

2505
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:13,110
I hope he's okay.

2506
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,070
There it is.

2507
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:15,330
Wait.

2508
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:16,290
Uh-oh.

2509
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:17,670
He's in the plant.

2510
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:17,950
He's in the plant.

2511
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:18,190
Uh-oh.

2512
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:21,110
Let me try and get him.

2513
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:21,730
I'm stuck.

2514
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,130
Oh, no.

2515
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:23,790
Where are you?

2516
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:25,590
The worm is in here, too.

2517
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,650
They're both in here.

2518
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:27,190
Thank you.

2519
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:28,470
What the heck?

2520
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:29,870
Where are you guys at?

2521
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:32,990
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2522
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,310
This way.

2523
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:33,610
This way.

2524
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:34,670
Oh, this one.

2525
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:35,010
Thank you.

2526
01:30:36,490 --> 01:30:38,030
I can't get him out of the plant.

2527
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:38,950
I can't pick him up.

2528
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:40,770
This is Froggy's place.

2529
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,030
Smells like frog.

2530
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,970
I tried so hard.

2531
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,830
I can't get him.

2532
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:46,310
I give up.

2533
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:46,950
Frog.

2534
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:47,850
Frog smell.

2535
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,310
Froggy.

2536
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:49,530
I picked the plant up.

2537
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:50,170
You can get him out.

2538
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:51,590
I picked the plant up.

2539
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:53,010
I was thinking of picking up the box.

2540
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,710
What a crazy setup.

2541
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:56,910
Is this dynamite?

2542
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:58,390
No.

2543
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:58,910
No.

2544
01:30:59,170 --> 01:30:59,910
Nuh-uh.

2545
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:00,590
Nuh-uh.

2546
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,130
Don't.

2547
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:02,950
There are no explosives in this house.

2548
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:04,050
Never mind.

2549
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,750
I saw nothing.

2550
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:05,750
I saw nothing.

2551
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,230
I'm no fat.

2552
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,210
I'm no snitch.

2553
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,030
You got a cake?

2554
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,510
Yeah.

2555
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:16,670
So cute.

2556
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:17,750
So cute.

2557
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:18,750
Coffee.

2558
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:21,450
Coffee.

2559
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,170
What the hell was that?

2560
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:24,710
I can't pick him up anymore.

2561
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:26,690
Did he get bigger?

2562
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:27,370
Oh my god.

2563
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:28,630
There's stuff in the fridge.

2564
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:30,710
There's raw pasta.

2565
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:32,470
Oh, my cup.

2566
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:36,430
I knew that.

2567
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,090
I knew that.

2568
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,970
You can actually do cooking in this game.

2569
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:40,470
You can?

2570
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:41,010
Yeah.

2571
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:44,430
You need a bunch of different kinds of pots to cook.

2572
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,350
So I've got like a ton of different pots.

2573
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,170
So I've got like a ton of different pots.

2574
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,010
Small cooking.

2575
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,870
What?

2576
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:52,510
That's crazy.

2577
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,390
It's really cute.

2578
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:56,950
Yeah.

2579
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:01,990
And then my unfinished basement is down there.

2580
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:03,890
And then my room is up here.

2581
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,810
You have a little man in here.

2582
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:08,390
What?

2583
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:11,110
Steve.

2584
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:13,230
Wait.

2585
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:13,450
What?

2586
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:14,850
There's a tiny man in my house?

2587
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:15,790
Yeah.

2588
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:16,470
He's in your basement.

2589
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:17,570
What?

2590
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:19,870
He's looking at your chest.

2591
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:20,290
Yeah.

2592
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:20,730
What?

2593
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:21,510
Huh?

2594
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,850
Yeah.

2595
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,930
I think he's stealing your stuff.

2596
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:28,850
Oh, my.

2597
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,250
Oh, my heart.

2598
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,290
Oh, my gosh.

2599
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:32,650
That's so human.

2600
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:35,470
What did you think of him?

2601
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:36,730
I don't know.

2602
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,490
I got scared.

2603
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:41,990
This is the unfinished basement.

2604
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:43,190
Where does this go?

2605
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:43,870
Oh, good.

2606
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:47,130
He goes to prison.

2607
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,410
Can I go?

2608
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:49,490
Yep.

2609
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,710
And you just ran in.

2610
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:53,610
No hesitation.

2611
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,650
And you said I'm in.

2612
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:57,430
That's prison.

2613
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,730
And you sprinted.

2614
01:32:58,930 --> 01:32:59,330
Wait.

2615
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:00,290
Why would I let you in?

2616
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:01,470
I don't know.

2617
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:03,430
Maybe I'm too...

2618
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:07,050
I think I'm too...

2619
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:08,550
I'm too...

2620
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:10,270
Justice.

2621
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:13,810
I'm not a criminal.

2622
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:14,910
Okay.

2623
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:15,550
Mint.

2624
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:19,030
The problem is that the actual teleport thing is one block up.

2625
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,710
Since you're one block tall, you need to jump into it.

2626
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:22,090
Okay.

2627
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:24,470
Prison.

2628
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,340
Yeah.

2629
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,160
Now we're in prison.

2630
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:33,720
Prison.

2631
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,260
Prison.

2632
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,600
What have you done?

2633
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,200
They're so cute.

2634
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,880
I'm gonna shit.

2635
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:44,900
Prison.

2636
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:45,200
Prison.

2637
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,760
You beat prison.

2638
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:50,360
Jail.

2639
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,560
One for everybody.

2640
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,320
So you can take everything inside.

2641
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,240
How do I say anything?

2642
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:05,980
Yeah, like that.

2643
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,980
So don't break these because everyone has their own room.

2644
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:09,220
Yeah.

2645
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,260
So you see stuff in there, you can take all of it.

2646
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,660
Because that's only generated for you.

2647
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,120
And I see something different in there.

2648
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:17,100
Oh, that's crazy.

2649
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:19,020
Yeah.

2650
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,520
Yeah, yeah.

2651
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:21,640
They're shared chests.

2652
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,600
Everything is shared.

2653
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:23,820
What?

2654
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:24,860
Oh my god, a diamond.

2655
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,080
Yeah.

2656
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,320
Good.

2657
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:28,500
What's the axe you have?

2658
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:30,920
My thunderbrand?

2659
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,220
Thunderbrand.

2660
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,600
Yeah, I got it from the prison one time.

2661
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:36,620
Oh.

2662
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,880
It's so fun.

2663
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,060
This is so cool.

2664
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,120
It is.

2665
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,280
Book.

2666
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:49,860
I need everything.

2667
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:50,820
I'm broke.

2668
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,340
This place is so huge.

2669
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,800
Bad ass.

2670
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:59,240
All I've gotten are lame little assassin daggers from the dungeons.

2671
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,300
That sucks, dude.

2672
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,340
You got thunderbrand?

2673
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,260
Yeah, I got thunderbrand.

2674
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:05,260
Oh, I got a weapon.

2675
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,860
Did you get a weapon?

2676
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:08,660
Yeah.

2677
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,300
Which one did you get?

2678
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,720
The gold scythe.

2679
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:15,700
Nice.

2680
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,240
Oh.

2681
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,280
Oh.

2682
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,140
Oh.

2683
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:22,560
Oh.

2684
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:25,600
Watch out.

2685
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,220
Watch out.

2686
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,060
I'm a new...

2687
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,300
What's that thing?

2688
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,820
Oh, that's an enemy.

2689
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:30,820
It is?

2690
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2691
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:36,260
Yeah, there we go.

2692
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,140
Oh my god.

2693
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,860
The prisons are full of treasure but they're also full of enemies.

2694
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,460
You gotta be careful.

2695
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:44,500
This is so fun.

2696
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,460
Oh my god.

2697
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,500
It's so cool.

2698
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:49,380
You can get a lot of really good things in here.

2699
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:53,020
Don't the prisons reset after a certain amount of time?

2700
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:53,800
I don't know.

2701
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,040
I don't know either.

2702
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:55,940
I don't think they do.

2703
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,620
No, I think this is like a prison that's...

2704
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,320
I think you have to like destroy your portal and redo it to get a different prison.

2705
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:02,860
Oh.

2706
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,360
That's smart.

2707
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:05,720
That's smart.

2708
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:09,640
Joel gave me the portal and I was like it's funny if I put it in my basement.

2709
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,620
Yeah, I was like how did you get that?

2710
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:13,640
Yeah.

2711
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:15,580
Assassin.

2712
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:16,340
Oh.

2713
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:17,780
Uh oh.

2714
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:18,320
Well.

2715
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,300
That's it for Ahri.

2716
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,300
We're never seeing her ever again.

2717
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,580
She's gone forever.

2718
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,400
Ain't nothing you can do about that.

2719
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:32,960
Ain't nothing you can do about that.

2720
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:33,480
She's gone.

2721
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,040
She's gone.

2722
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:35,840
Oh, hi Ahri.

2723
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:36,760
Welcome back.

2724
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,360
You made it.

2725
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:43,360
I think there's a guy right behind me.

2726
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:43,780
Oh.

2727
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:44,160
Um.

2728
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:44,640
Uh oh.

2729
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,520
I'm gonna skill issue you.

2730
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:50,560
I'm gonna skill issue you.

2731
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,120
I'm gonna skill issue you.

2732
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,960
Don't do it with Thunderbrand.

2733
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:55,780
It's so cool.

2734
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,920
I think there's like a lot of really cool things here.

2735
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:00,400
This kind of portal is everywhere you see it at the outfield.

2736
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:00,760
Uh.

2737
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,340
So when you find it, you can go inside and get the loot.

2738
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,020
Ah.

2739
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:07,420
There's so many portals out there.

2740
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,840
So they're all random?

2741
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:11,260
Yeah.

2742
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,920
I will say there's like a boss in each prison.

2743
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:15,420
I wouldn't attack the boss.

2744
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,080
Because when you attack it, it closes it off for everybody else.

2745
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:19,720
Oh.

2746
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:20,520
Okay.

2747
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:20,840
Okay.

2748
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,400
You actually can't go in the prison anymore once the boss is eaten.

2749
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,680
I've never seen a boss before.

2750
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:24,700
How do you see him?

2751
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:29,600
The prison I used to go to, I think Heavenly defeated the boss there.

2752
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,060
And now I can't go in there anymore.

2753
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:31,660
Oh.

2754
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:32,180
Oopsie.

2755
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:32,360
Really?

2756
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,540
Yeah.

2757
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,460
It's closed off.

2758
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,580
Oh no.

2759
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:35,940
Okay.

2760
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:36,560
Yeah.

2761
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,500
Why would you do that to me, Heavenly?

2762
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:42,020
Oh wait.

2763
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:42,760
Maybe this one.

2764
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,420
Okay.

2765
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:52,220
Zen raided me and I didn't notice for hours.

2766
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:54,180
Oh no.

2767
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,160
I'm so sorry, Zen.

2768
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:03,540
The tea is ready.

2769
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,280
Thank you, Zen.

2770
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:08,200
I was so focused on the game.

2771
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:09,420
Thank you for playing.

2772
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,760
I hope you had a wonderful time.

2773
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:13,440
Finally.

2774
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:13,760
Yes.

2775
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,000
I am so sorry.

2776
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:15,480
Finally.

2777
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,600
I even forgot I was streaming.

2778
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:19,440
Sorry.

2779
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:19,860
Sorry.

2780
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,640
Thank you, Zen.

2781
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,540
Arigato.

2782
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:25,560
Arigato.

2783
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,040
Oh my goodness.

2784
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,160
Hello, Raiders.

2785
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:29,600
Welcome.

2786
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:34,940
We're playing Minecraft with Mint, Addy, Froggy and Hanya and everybody.

2787
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,860
This is the first time Mint joining the server.

2788
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:38,960
It's the first time.

2789
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:39,160
I hope you've enjoyed.

2790
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:40,820
Yeah.

2791
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:41,860
First time.

2792
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,740
My first time.

2793
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,760
Oh my gosh.

2794
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,420
This is so exciting.

2795
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:47,780
Everything's new.

2796
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:49,760
Look at this guy.

2797
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,380
Can I take him home?

2798
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:54,500
Oh, you can.

2799
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,800
You can destroy him with a pickaxe.

2800
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,140
I think it has to be a...

2801
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,280
Is she talking about a corpse?

2802
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:01,080
Maybe.

2803
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,660
Can I take this home?

2804
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:06,360
You can.

2805
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,720
You can take him home.

2806
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:09,900
Hold on.

2807
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:11,240
There you go.

2808
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,520
Oh my god.

2809
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,120
I have him.

2810
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,740
This is one of the first things you want on the server.

2811
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:17,240
A corpse.

2812
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:18,380
A tiny little skeleton.

2813
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,860
Spooky scary skeleton.

2814
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,220
Slippers for spying.

2815
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,440
I like stealing these torches a lot at the time too.

2816
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,220
They're really neat.

2817
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:30,980
I like them.

2818
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,560
Yeah, they're good torches.

2819
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:32,980
Yeah.

2820
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:35,820
Wow.

2821
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:39,080
I want to keep just exploring all the... but this place is dangerous, right?

2822
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:40,760
It is.

2823
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,380
But if you're with somebody that has a good weapon, it's not too bad.

2824
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:44,020
Yeah.

2825
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:44,480
Yeah.

2826
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,600
But if you're with somebody that has a good weapon, it's not scary anymore.

2827
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:47,840
Yeah.

2828
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,120
I saw an area where you can go down.

2829
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:55,060
You can go under the prison.

2830
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,940
And I haven't been able to find it again.

2831
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,120
Like, I found it just once.

2832
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,440
This hole that goes under the prison and I haven't been able to find it.

2833
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,180
Oh, that was a different prison.

2834
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,580
No, I swear it was this one.

2835
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,960
I swear it was this one.

2836
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,640
I'm not lying.

2837
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,200
It's your first time here.

2838
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:10,380
What do you mean?

2839
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,800
It's your first time here.

2840
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:12,980
How can I be lying?

2841
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,500
What are you saying?

2842
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,060
I've got a big sword.

2843
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,320
Oh, wow.

2844
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:20,940
Look at you.

2845
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,960
You've got a big sword.

2846
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:22,960
Look at it.

2847
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,100
I swear there was a little hole where you could drop down.

2848
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,120
And there was more to the dungeon.

2849
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,260
I swear to God.

2850
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,340
The audio crunches that?

2851
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,660
How do I get the regular backpack?

2852
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,240
Thank you, guys.

2853
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:39,680
Hold on.

2854
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,820
I have a gift for you.

2855
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,900
I have a gift for you.

2856
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:42,480
A gift?

2857
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:42,800
A gift?

2858
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,300
Uh-huh.

2859
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,240
If you give me a little bit of money.

2860
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:47,980
Okay.

2861
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,860
I thought you were going to say, give me a little bit of money.

2862
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:53,340
I'll pay you.

2863
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,040
Where's your money?

2864
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,940
Here, here, here.

2865
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,000
I have a gold doubloon.

2866
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,560
No, no, no.

2867
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,240
It's yours.

2868
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:04,860
It's yours.

2869
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,040
Don't give it to me.

2870
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:06,540
No, it's okay.

2871
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:07,760
I'm paying you.

2872
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:09,740
No, no.

2873
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,000
It's your first day.

2874
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,180
It's your first day.

2875
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:15,220
I'm going to give you a backpack that you will love.

2876
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,120
Okay.

2877
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:17,760
Will I look so stylish?

2878
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,520
Yeah, you will.

2879
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,160
You will.

2880
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,700
And a leather...

2881
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,240
A leather...

2882
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:30,100
What else do I need?

2883
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:33,120
That first day is free.

2884
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:33,440
Oh.

2885
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:36,540
For today.

2886
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,360
For today.

2887
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,820
For today, it's free.

2888
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,680
Yes.

2889
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,500
How do I get a sleeping bag?

2890
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:50,130
How do I get a sleeping bag, chat?

2891
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:50,970
How do I get a sleeping bag, chat?

2892
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:54,670
Sleeping bag...

2893
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:56,830
Oh, okay.

2894
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:57,290
Free wool.

2895
01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:06,890
A land cell?

2896
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:10,390
A land cell?

2897
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:10,870
It's not a land cell.

2898
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:12,410
It's not a land cell.

2899
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:14,370
I mean, it's kind of, but...

2900
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:15,370
It's a backpack.

2901
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:16,350
Look.

2902
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:18,510
Look, look.

2903
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:19,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2904
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:21,390
It's a backpack.

2905
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,530
Wait, did you give it to me?

2906
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:26,270
No, not yet.

2907
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:26,910
I'm making one.

2908
01:42:26,990 --> 01:42:27,250
Oh, okay.

2909
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:29,230
There you go.

2910
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:31,290
Here's your backpack.

2911
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:34,970
Oh.

2912
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:42,030
Are you going to give it to me?

2913
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:43,010
Oh, there we go.

2914
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:43,290
There we go.

2915
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:45,830
Wait, so how do I put it on?

2916
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:49,090
Oh, to hold the backpack, you click it.

2917
01:42:49,230 --> 01:42:52,690
And you should be able to see that there's an icon that says like...

2918
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:54,550
And you should be able to see that there's an icon that says like...

2919
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:55,630
Press control.

2920
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:56,470
Oh!

2921
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:58,930
Wait, how do I wear it?

2922
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:01,970
Do you see an icon?

2923
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:05,450
Oh, I have to hold it in my hand?

2924
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:08,550
Yeah, you have to hold it in your hand.

2925
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:12,010
And when you click it, you see the icon.

2926
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:13,270
Steve standing.

2927
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:14,570
There you go.

2928
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:21,530
And we can upgrade it so you can have more stuff inside.

2929
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:24,030
I can upgrade it for you later.

2930
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:24,490
Okay.

2931
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:25,250
Wait.

2932
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:25,930
Yeah!

2933
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:28,450
How do I open it now?

2934
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:29,150
Where does it go?

2935
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:31,990
You press B and then you open it.

2936
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:32,370
B.

2937
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:33,810
O.

2938
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:34,130
B.

2939
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:34,790
V.

2940
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:35,550
B.

2941
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,370
And B.

2942
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:37,450
B.

2943
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:38,930
And B.

2944
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:39,250
B.

2945
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:41,210
B.

2946
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:41,790
B.

2947
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:42,770
B.

2948
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:43,070
B.

2949
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:44,070
B.

2950
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:49,590
I think my...

2951
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:50,350
Beautiful B.

2952
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:51,810
I think it's my...

2953
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:54,510
I think my keybinds are weird.

2954
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:55,750
I'll do it later.

2955
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:56,370
It's okay.

2956
01:43:56,650 --> 01:43:57,710
Okay, okay, okay.

2957
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:59,250
Oh, it's still weird?

2958
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:00,550
Yeah, it's okay though.

2959
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:02,650
Okay, okay, okay.

2960
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:04,710
Yeah, but it's so good.

2961
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:05,430
It's so good.

2962
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:07,210
I want to find more treasure.

2963
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:10,750
Let's go find more treasure.

2964
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:11,310
Treasure.

2965
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:13,310
Oh, have you go up here?

2966
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:14,530
Where?

2967
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:16,890
Up here.

2968
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:17,810
You see this chain?

2969
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:18,850
Oh!

2970
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:22,310
Uh-oh.

2971
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,400
Uh-oh.

2972
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:30,620
What's up?

2973
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,160
I thought I saw something.

2974
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,160
No, no.

2975
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,860
What's my achievement?

2976
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,280
I collected loot.

2977
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:43,180
Nice.

2978
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:48,320
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2979
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:51,160
Take it all.

2980
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,780
Guts.

2981
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:53,940
Guts.

2982
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:58,040
I like when they drop their body parts.

2983
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:05,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2984
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:07,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2985
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:07,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2986
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:09,970
Cool.

2987
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:12,810
Oh, my health.

2988
01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:13,630
You're right.

2989
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:16,690
My health?

2990
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:18,290
My health is bad.

2991
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:21,050
Oh, your health?

2992
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:21,950
Oh, do you need food?

2993
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,670
Oh, I can't eat honeycomb.

2994
01:45:24,930 --> 01:45:26,470
Can I eat guts?

2995
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:29,290
You can.

2996
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:31,950
I'm eating them.

2997
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:32,650
Yummy.

2998
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:34,050
Yummy guts.

2999
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:35,850
Yummy guts.

3000
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:37,450
Guts are delicious.

3001
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:42,330
Meat, meat.

3002
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:43,630
Maybe.

3003
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:44,350
Oh, there they are.

3004
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:45,630
Hello.

3005
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,330
Hi, I'm eating really fast.

3006
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,140
Ah!

3007
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:54,800
Killed

3008
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:06,350
by a leaping zombie.

3009
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:06,550
Zombie.

3010
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:09,030
Um...

3011
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:15,580
What's in here?

3012
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:17,620
Nothing.

3013
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:20,200
Why is it open like that?

3014
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,300
So many of these things.

3015
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,460
Oh, music.

3016
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:25,700
Oh, except.

3017
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:28,540
I'm back.

3018
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,420
Welcome back.

3019
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,060
I'm tired about that.

3020
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:33,640
It's okay.

3021
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,460
It happens, you know.

3022
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,740
It happens, it happens.

3023
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,280
Yeah, no problem.

3024
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:42,540
Thank you.

3025
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:45,420
Oopsie.

3026
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,340
Oopsie-daisy.

3027
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:47,680
Yeah, oopsie-poopsie.

3028
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,120
No problem.

3029
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,580
Oopsie-poopsie.

3030
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,160
More loot.

3031
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,160
More loot.

3032
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:04,080
I like how the enemies didn't spawn until you guys came back over.

3033
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,800
They were just chilling, eating food, and then you came over and they just all spawned.

3034
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,880
We're just that popular, you know.

3035
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,500
They're...

3036
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,840
They're like, genius.

3037
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:15,740
Gotta...

3038
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,100
My Kamiyoshi.

3039
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,040
My Kamiyoshi.

3040
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,520
And you're the genius.

3041
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:22,660
Oh, uh-oh.

3042
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:25,360
Don't know me.

3043
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:28,500
Nice.

3044
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:31,040
Ooh, another treasure chest over here.

3045
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:31,580
Ooh.

3046
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:33,660
Ooh, diamond.

3047
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:37,300
Yeah, you get like diamonds and a lot of stuff.

3048
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:37,940
Running out of space.

3049
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,280
Nice.

3050
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,040
Oh, you wanna go back?

3051
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:43,180
You gotta make your chest...

3052
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:44,500
What the?

3053
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,040
Is that behind me?

3054
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:47,000
Oh my god!

3055
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:48,600
I saved you.

3056
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,460
You saved my life.

3057
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:52,100
Savior-dayo.

3058
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,640
Savior-dayo.

3059
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:55,840
What's that?

3060
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:56,600
Uh-oh.

3061
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,740
She's got this.

3062
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,820
I'm just gonna keep taking stuff.

3063
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:04,200
She's built different.

3064
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:05,340
She is built different.

3065
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,000
I'm just taking everything.

3066
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:09,980
Welcome to the genius-dayo.

3067
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,220
Oh, let's go to the second floor.

3068
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:12,860
Be careful!

3069
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,000
It's okay, I got it!

3070
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:15,540
Yeah!

3071
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,240
Thank you!

3072
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,080
Nice!

3073
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,260
This floor goes to deeper.

3074
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,460
Deeper.

3075
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,500
There's more floors.

3076
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,920
I like the tapestry.

3077
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:28,980
Oh, Froggy wasn't lying.

3078
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,060
There is!

3079
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:32,500
There is!

3080
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:33,940
She doesn't need to know that.

3081
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:36,440
I told you I wasn't lying!

3082
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:36,920
No!

3083
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,680
I told you!

3084
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:40,960
Oh, she's here!

3085
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:43,180
Yeah!

3086
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:45,140
I haven't explored yet.

3087
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,460
But it keeps going.

3088
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:47,980
Oh!

3089
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:50,760
No!

3090
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:51,900
Froggy, no!

3091
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:52,940
That was impressive.

3092
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,280
That was fast.

3093
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,800
That was pretty quick.

3094
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,340
I don't think Froggy suffered, you know?

3095
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:02,720
It's good.

3096
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:03,420
She died.

3097
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,160
It's a quick death.

3098
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:07,480
Also, I can make you a hookshot.

3099
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:07,960
Hold on.

3100
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:11,660
It's really handy when you don't have Elytra.

3101
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,260
Oh, yeah.

3102
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,820
I don't know about giving you Elytra.

3103
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,420
If you want, I can give it to you.

3104
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,060
But also, I don't want to take away your experience too.

3105
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,360
So, let me know if you want.

3106
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:21,500
Oh, no.

3107
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:21,880
It's okay.

3108
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,100
I'll get one myself.

3109
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:24,880
Okay, okay.

3110
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,240
Yeah, thank you though.

3111
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,560
Of course!

3112
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:28,660
Ari?

3113
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:30,680
Sorry!

3114
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:35,820
Too bad!

3115
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,180
No, no, no!

3116
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:39,060
Hanya!

3117
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:39,980
Hanya!

3118
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:44,880
Swing on Mint!

3119
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:47,140
Here you go.

3120
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:47,540
Get her!

3121
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,240
Get her, Hanya!

3122
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:48,940
Get her, Hanya!

3123
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:52,880
Sacrifice me!

3124
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:58,920
Wait,

3125
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:03,480
hold on.

3126
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,780
I'm gonna make you a hookshot.

3127
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,280
Hold on.

3128
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:05,420
Okay.

3129
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,180
I'm trying to change my keyboard still.

3130
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,780
You know, maybe I deserve that.

3131
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:15,900
I'm defeated.

3132
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,880
Back at the door.

3133
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:19,820
Yeah.

3134
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:22,920
Don't you give me that, Sassy!

3135
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:23,520
Yeah.

3136
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,520
Yeah.

3137
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:25,300
Yeah.

3138
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:27,680
What is it, Ari?

3139
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:28,640
Wait.

3140
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,680
You're too sassy.

3141
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:33,800
You're too sassy, Hanya.

3142
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,580
You're too sassy, Hanya.

3143
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:40,220
There we go.

3144
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:43,220
I'm trying to give her the hookshot.

3145
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:43,400
Oh!

3146
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:49,990
There we go.

3147
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:50,450
There we go.

3148
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:51,290
Did you see that?

3149
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:57,990
I'm built different.

3150
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:02,190
Are you good?

3151
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:04,810
I think I'm doing Gangnam Style right now.

3152
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:07,270
Hey, sexy lady!

3153
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:12,490
Gangnam Style!

3154
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:14,350
I did a flip even.

3155
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,210
Oh, my God.

3156
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:15,710
Get it, man.

3157
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:16,190
Get it.

3158
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,290
Welcome back, Froggy.

3159
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:18,210
Watch this.

3160
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,690
Thank you.

3161
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,960
Hell yeah, brother.

3162
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:31,600
Hell yeah.

3163
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:36,920
I'm learning.

3164
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:38,900
I'm learning every day.

3165
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,200
Oh, you found an email.

3166
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,140
Yeah.

3167
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,780
That was my favorite thing.

3168
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,040
Flip!

3169
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,520
Oh, my God.

3170
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:52,660
The flip is so funny.

3171
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,200
I'll give you a hookshot.

3172
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,160
I'll give you a hookshot.

3173
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:57,840
Wait.

3174
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,160
I think I need more space.

3175
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:00,260
Uh -oh.

3176
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:01,500
Escape.

3177
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:05,980
Maybe E?

3178
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,100
That would be E.

3179
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:09,100
I did it.

3180
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:09,400
I did it.

3181
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,280
Nice!

3182
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:12,880
Yay!

3183
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:12,960
Yay!

3184
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,740
You can go up like this.

3185
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:17,880
It's like a hookshot.

3186
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:18,440
Okay.

3187
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,780
There's so much space down here.

3188
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:21,360
Where is it?

3189
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:23,420
Oh, here it is.

3190
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,320
Hey, Froggy.

3191
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,500
Wait, Froggy.

3192
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,440
You have an Electro.

3193
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:30,300
Why did you not just glide down?

3194
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,300
I forgot.

3195
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:32,920
Like this?

3196
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,280
That's understandable, I guess.

3197
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,940
I'm ordering food, okay?

3198
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,600
Oh!

3199
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:40,460
I did it.

3200
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:41,120
I just finished eating.

3201
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:43,780
Ah!

3202
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,960
Yeah, just like that.

3203
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:46,560
Okay.

3204
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:47,900
Easy peasy.

3205
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:48,540
Thank you.

3206
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,880
Of course, of course.

3207
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:52,260
You're cute.

3208
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,120
Do you wanna...

3209
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:56,040
Do you wanna put down some of your stuff?

3210
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,080
Because you tell me that you're full or not.

3211
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,880
Oh, I have a backpack now.

3212
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,340
I'm okay.

3213
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:01,960
Okay, okay.

3214
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:03,320
Ow.

3215
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:04,720
Sorry, I have to pee.

3216
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:05,320
Don't let me die.

3217
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,200
Okay.

3218
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,180
Don't let me die.

3219
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,000
Okay.

3220
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,160
Okay, I have to pee.

3221
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,240
Okay, go pee.

3222
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:13,140
I'm...

3223
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:16,140
Please.

3224
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:16,820
Kill her!

3225
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:17,880
Yeah!

3226
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:20,140
Yeah!

3227
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,960
Take her down.

3228
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,580
Oh no!

3229
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,440
She's suffocating!

3230
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,300
You didn't kill her.

3231
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,280
She suffocated.

3232
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,800
Yeah.

3233
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,240
Tragedy Dale.

3234
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:40,680
Tragedy Dale!

3235
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:41,720
How'd that happen?

3236
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:42,800
That's so weird.

3237
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,400
I think it bugged.

3238
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,080
Yeah, it bugged.

3239
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:46,680
It bugged.

3240
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,400
It's a weird glitch.

3241
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,520
She's gonna see that she suffocated.

3242
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,660
That's not possible.

3243
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,280
Yeah, you didn't kill her.

3244
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:54,880
Yeah.

3245
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:55,780
Okay, there we go.

3246
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:56,120
I think it's dead.

3247
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:57,660
No!

3248
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:01,130
No!

3249
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:04,230
Adi died!

3250
01:54:04,890 --> 01:54:06,110
You're so strong, Hannah.

3251
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:07,830
Thank you.

3252
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:09,070
You got a really good armor.

3253
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:09,570
Yeah.

3254
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:12,310
If it wasn't the consequences of my own actions.

3255
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:18,390
If it wasn't the consequences of my own actions.

3256
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:20,390
My hands were glitched so I couldn't switch to my weapon.

3257
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:21,610
Uh oh.

3258
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:22,950
But I'm good now.

3259
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,750
I can take him down.

3260
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:26,190
Get him!

3261
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:26,850
Get him!

3262
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:27,590
Get him!

3263
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:28,170
Get him!

3264
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:31,830
Yeah, I was gonna die.

3265
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:33,170
There was a lot there.

3266
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:34,710
I got a booger.

3267
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,650
Experience nugget!

3268
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:41,150
I thought it was a booger.

3269
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,190
I thought it was a booger.

3270
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:44,330
It was an experience nugget.

3271
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:44,510
It was an experience nugget.

3272
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:44,850
What is that?

3273
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:45,590
Oh, yeah.

3274
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,370
You cloud and...

3275
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:50,330
Oh, yeah.

3276
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:51,690
You can use it.

3277
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:52,090
Nice.

3278
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:54,610
Oh, wait.

3279
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:56,090
Here.

3280
01:54:57,150 --> 01:54:58,390
I don't know if this is better than what you have.

3281
01:54:58,510 --> 01:54:59,450
But that's a really good sword.

3282
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:01,430
What is this?

3283
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:04,110
Oh, thank you.

3284
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:04,890
Yeah.

3285
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:06,750
It's a blade.

3286
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,570
Oh, you look cool.

3287
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:10,230
I do.

3288
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:11,190
She studied the blade.

3289
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:12,790
You look like a Raiden Raiden.

3290
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:14,010
Raiden?

3291
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:17,230
Raiden, Raiden.

3292
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:19,650
Yeah, I'm Raiden.

3293
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:23,150
Yeah.

3294
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:29,510
More stuff for us.

3295
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:33,530
I'm looting everything.

3296
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:34,290
Me too.

3297
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:34,950
It's all mine.

3298
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:51,100
Time to let her rip.

3299
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:52,860
And...

3300
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:54,300
I did.

3301
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,080
She keeps having to teleport me.

3302
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:58,800
One day.

3303
01:55:59,420 --> 01:55:59,980
Hi!

3304
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:01,700
You did try.

3305
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:02,240
You did try.

3306
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,140
I killed him.

3307
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,460
I just also died at the same time.

3308
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,620
You know, it's a little...

3309
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:07,480
Necessary sacrifice.

3310
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,020
Counterproductive, maybe, a little bit.

3311
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:10,060
I got it.

3312
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:13,740
Pink.

3313
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,500
Not that.

3314
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:16,640
What is that?

3315
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,100
Sorry, I actually charged up.

3316
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,640
Oh, it's me.

3317
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:21,080
My...

3318
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,440
My Thunderbrand.

3319
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:23,420
It does like this thing.

3320
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:24,480
Whoa!

3321
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,360
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.

3322
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:27,420
It's okay.

3323
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:28,360
That's crazy.

3324
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,340
Yeah, I can like charge more and hurt people.

3325
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:31,360
You're zooming.

3326
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:33,460
That's cool.

3327
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:36,320
Anything in here?

3328
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:36,700
Nope.

3329
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:37,860
Nope.

3330
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:38,720
No treasure.

3331
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:42,260
Sometimes it goes further down.

3332
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,580
But I'm not sure about this.

3333
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:45,140
Oh!

3334
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,600
Nice kill!

3335
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:50,080
Oh my gosh!

3336
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,620
She's so cute, the little body.

3337
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,100
I'm gonna take him home.

3338
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,940
Oh, you want him?

3339
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:02,060
Yeah, I want this guy.

3340
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:02,900
Is it okay?

3341
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,020
Yeah, of course.

3342
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:07,420
Thank you!

3343
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:08,940
Zen!

3344
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,980
Zen is on!

3345
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,360
Hi, Zen!

3346
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:16,960
Oh!

3347
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,560
Oh!

3348
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,940
She immediately died.

3349
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,280
Oh!

3350
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:24,740
Oh!

3351
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,500
Help!

3352
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:27,360
It's you!

3353
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:28,660
Zen!

3354
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:42,460
Why is my chat telling me to run?

3355
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,460
Uh oh.

3356
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,180
She got on, died, and left.

3357
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:48,340
She got on, died, and left.

3358
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:48,680
Sorry.

3359
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:50,680
Never mind.

3360
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,840
I guess we're safe, everybody.

3361
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,380
Good job, Zen.

3362
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,620
Good job, Zen.

3363
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,020
Alright.

3364
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:00,780
I'm gonna go this way.

3365
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:05,280
I'm following you guys, because I'm weak.

3366
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,840
Nice kill!

3367
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,020
I'm about to die.

3368
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:10,620
No!

3369
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:13,800
Nice, nice!

3370
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,380
Treasure!

3371
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,820
I'm getting so many chains.

3372
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,540
Yeah, me too.

3373
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,440
You can't hit me!

3374
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:24,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3375
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:26,320
I did it.

3376
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,240
There's so many chests.

3377
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,320
That sounded close.

3378
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:33,780
Yeah, I have one heart left, so I'm just like...

3379
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,040
Do you need some flesh?

3380
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:36,980
Flesh?

3381
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:38,380
I have some guts for you.

3382
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,600
You can eat guts?

3383
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:41,140
Yeah!

3384
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:42,500
They're delicious.

3385
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,100
You can eat it, you can eat it.

3386
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:46,380
I got a nutcracker.

3387
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:49,780
A nutcracker?

3388
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:50,300
Nice!

3389
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:56,060
I have a food, so I can give you guys if you want to.

3390
01:58:58,140 --> 01:58:58,940
What does this do?

3391
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,620
Food time!

3392
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:04,960
It deals critical damage to frozen and stunned enemies.

3393
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,060
Cool.

3394
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:07,700
Cool.

3395
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:09,460
Nice, nice!

3396
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,640
What's a runic tablet?

3397
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,400
I never used it before.

3398
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:20,460
I think it's for fixing weapons?

3399
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:23,680
I think?

3400
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,620
Time to break some nuts.

3401
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,170
Yay!

3402
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:29,850
Yeah!

3403
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,030
Oh, you took it?

3404
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:33,710
Here you go!

3405
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:34,610
Oh, thank you!

3406
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:36,930
Thank you very much.

3407
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:38,190
Yeah!

3408
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,100
Not a thing.

3409
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:47,860
Not a thing.

3410
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:52,900
I love how every time I get on Minecraft, I do everything but the thing I got on Minecraft to do.

3411
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,120
That's how it goes, isn't it?

3412
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,660
Oh my gosh, with this, I'm going to be exploring forever though.

3413
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,320
Oh, I know the dungeons.

3414
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:05,120
Yeah, I'm going to be going to the dungeons forever.

3415
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:06,180
So many good things.

3416
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:06,920
And all the bodies.

3417
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:10,380
There are like so many things to do in this game.

3418
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,360
It's a lot, it's a lot.

3419
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:14,060
Oh no, I broke him!

3420
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:15,940
You broke him?

3421
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:17,540
Oh, maybe it has to be a silk touch.

3422
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:20,240
I think so, it has to be silk touch to take the bodies.

3423
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:20,780
Oh no.

3424
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:23,200
It's okay.

3425
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:24,380
I have silk touch.

3426
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:27,680
I think I only need one stinky man.

3427
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,000
Oh, one thing.

3428
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:32,080
Why not two stinky men?

3429
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:33,520
Or three stinky men?

3430
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:34,200
You know what?

3431
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:34,860
You're so right.

3432
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,060
Why not have more stinky men?

3433
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,280
I made one request to you.

3434
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,100
I made one request to you.

3435
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,700
You're failing me even now.

3436
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,200
You're letting me die even now.

3437
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:46,640
You're letting me shoot me in the brain.

3438
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:48,820
Oopsie.

3439
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:49,860
I totally forgot.

3440
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:52,480
A lot has happened.

3441
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,940
So much happened.

3442
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:56,740
Oh, I see, I see.

3443
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:57,220
Okay, yeah.

3444
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,040
You got caught up.

3445
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3446
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:01,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3447
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3448
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3449
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:07,040
Whatever you say.

3450
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3451
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:09,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3452
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:16,430
Oh, oh, oh.

3453
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:18,070
I think we're okay.

3454
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:19,290
Oh, oh.

3455
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:23,360
Thank you.

3456
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:24,220
Thank you.

3457
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:25,140
Yeah.

3458
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:27,340
Guys.

3459
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:27,780
Anytime.

3460
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,280
You know you can get the claw bar.

3461
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:34,580
Hehe.

3462
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,360
It has a cool down.

3463
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,980
Just like a half life.

3464
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,920
Where did I get this from?

3465
02:01:44,220 --> 02:01:44,780
No.

3466
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,180
Uh oh.

3467
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,800
You're not protecting me.

3468
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,320
Am I supposed to?

3469
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,060
Yeah.

3470
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:56,460
Oh, you came back so I didn't think that was my job anymore.

3471
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,280
Lynn, I found your stinky guy.

3472
02:01:58,620 --> 02:01:59,180
You did?

3473
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:00,520
Yeah.

3474
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:01,360
You want him?

3475
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:05,780
A rotten corpse.

3476
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:06,980
Yeah, I'll take him.

3477
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:10,080
Here you go.

3478
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:10,940
Thank you.

3479
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:12,700
Oh my gosh.

3480
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:13,900
Now I have a corpse.

3481
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:15,200
I have a rotten corpse.

3482
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:15,860
I have a skeleton.

3483
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:17,080
I have all three phases.

3484
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,660
You got all phases.

3485
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:19,420
Yeah.

3486
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:23,020
Careful.

3487
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:24,400
Careful.

3488
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:28,180
This is so exciting.

3489
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:35,620
I know.

3490
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,360
It's a lot of stuff.

3491
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:42,220
Also, you gotta find a place to build your house too.

3492
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:42,900
Yeah.

3493
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:43,840
You're right.

3494
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,700
There are so many places.

3495
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:48,520
Yeah, there aren't so many biomes.

3496
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:49,940
There are so many places.

3497
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,580
Oh, thanks guys.

3498
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:53,500
Let's see.

3499
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:58,540
The only thing I would suggest is not building near the spawn because it gets a little laggy.

3500
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3501
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,000
Okay.

3502
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:02,880
I will not do that.

3503
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:05,380
Mm-hmm.

3504
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:11,600
Mike-chan says, I love we still exploring a froggy's house.

3505
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:12,320
That's true.

3506
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,900
We still in the froggy's house.

3507
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:14,720
You're right.

3508
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,540
Oh my gosh.

3509
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:16,180
Technically, yeah.

3510
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,360
The frog's dungeon.

3511
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:20,280
Yeah.

3512
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:21,820
It's just the biggest house.

3513
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:22,880
It's so much fun.

3514
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:24,180
So many rooms.

3515
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:25,760
She got the biggest house.

3516
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:32,600
I didn't know you had a big basement or prison.

3517
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:33,240
Yeah.

3518
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,940
This is where my mods live.

3519
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,080
Why does mom let you have a basement?

3520
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:41,300
Why does mom let you have a basement?

3521
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:43,140
You're a mod to live in a basement too?

3522
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,300
Mine too.

3523
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,940
I'm taking care of you.

3524
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:51,880
It's okay.

3525
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:54,540
Oh my god.

3526
02:04:00,090 --> 02:04:00,790
I'm okay.

3527
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:01,030
I'm okay.

3528
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:05,790
There's like a portal right there.

3529
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:06,490
There's like a portal right there.

3530
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,800
I can handle myself.

3531
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18,480
Yeah.

3532
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,440
But I couldn't find the boss.

3533
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:22,500
Uh-huh.

3534
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:25,400
Maybe you have to summon him with the item.

3535
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:28,020
Where are

3536
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:44,980
you guys?

3537
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:47,020
How did she die?

3538
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,040
I'm behind you.

3539
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,040
You're behind me?

3540
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:50,620
Hello.

3541
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:52,200
Hello.

3542
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:55,760
Chica!

3543
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:59,880
Can you get armor in the chests?

3544
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,390
Can you get armor in the chests?

3545
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:06,490
Wait, can we?

3546
02:05:06,610 --> 02:05:08,750
I only find a weapon but not armor.

3547
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,390
Maybe it's not possible.

3548
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:13,090
Maybe it's not possible.

3549
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:20,700
Yeah!

3550
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,860
That I spawned in Zen's bed.

3551
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,460
And Zen was there and I was like, Zen!

3552
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,400
And she logged in.

3553
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:30,460
Zen!

3554
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:30,520
Zen!

3555
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:33,800
She just abandoned me.

3556
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,940
I don't know.

3557
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,820
Here I go.

3558
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:39,260
Oh!

3559
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:40,400
Here I go.

3560
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:43,420
Here I go.

3561
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:44,300
Oh.

3562
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,900
Thank you.

3563
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:55,540
Of course, anytime.

3564
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:57,140
I think it's for the boss.

3565
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:58,820
There's a boss!

3566
02:05:58,980 --> 02:05:59,580
I wanna go!

3567
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,700
I just hear the distance.

3568
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,180
There's a boss?

3569
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:04,040
Yummy!

3570
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:11,720
Yummy!

3571
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,220
Yummy!

3572
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:15,360
Yummy guts.

3573
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:16,820
Delicious.

3574
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:19,500
I think I'm becoming a zombie.

3575
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,420
Maybe a little bit.

3576
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:23,460
That's a little concerning.

3577
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:25,460
It's okay.

3578
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:25,720
It's okay.

3579
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,660
I seek the highest quality of guts.

3580
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:33,060
It's guts.

3581
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:34,800
It's guts.

3582
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:35,600
It's guts.

3583
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:35,760
It's guts.

3584
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:36,180
It's guts.

3585
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:38,740
It's upgraded.

3586
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:42,160
There's a song in Japan.

3587
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:43,200
It's called guts.

3588
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:45,440
Oh, really?

3589
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,180
I think it's a very old song.

3590
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:49,680
It takes you to this forest.

3591
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:54,380
Yeah, it takes you to a forest with a bunch of red bees.

3592
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,860
There's even a cage.

3593
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:04,680
Yeah.

3594
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:05,920
You should take it.

3595
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:08,480
Yeah.

3596
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:09,860
Oh.

3597
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:16,140
Oopsie.

3598
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:17,620
Oh my gosh.

3599
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:18,860
You guys, I think I'm obsessed.

3600
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,620
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3601
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,280
I think I'm obsessed with the mines.

3602
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:23,640
Not the mines.

3603
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:24,640
The dungeons.

3604
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:25,940
Oh my god.

3605
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,660
I will never leave the dungeons.

3606
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:29,200
Ouch.

3607
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,260
Wait, what's this over here?

3608
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:34,100
Oh, they're all a bunch of pigs.

3609
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:37,400
That's how I saw it was somebody's birthday.

3610
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:41,380
Uh, Desecrator, happy birthday!

3611
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:42,380
Uh,

3612
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,200
Desecrator, happy birthday!

3613
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:46,900
Happy birthday!

3614
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:49,920
Sorry, it's hard to reach out when, um...

3615
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:50,240
Sorry, it's hard to reach out when, um...

3616
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:52,880
when it's a collab.

3617
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:54,920
But thank you guys, thank you!

3618
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:57,100
Hello!

3619
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,020
Hello!

3620
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:00,260
Welcome back!

3621
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:01,340
Thank you!

3622
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:05,100
Nice.

3623
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:07,940
Oh, there's two in here.

3624
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,900
More guts.

3625
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:12,320
And iron.

3626
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:13,240
Yeah.

3627
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:15,360
And this... a cobweb.

3628
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:18,000
So many books.

3629
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,180
What did you do for that?

3630
02:08:19,340 --> 02:08:21,160
Oh, I see what... capacity.

3631
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:24,200
A pentacon.

3632
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:25,440
A who?

3633
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:29,440
What's this?

3634
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:30,100
What's that?

3635
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,860
There's so much here.

3636
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:34,480
Wait.

3637
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:36,080
Hold on.

3638
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:37,340
This one's kind of funny.

3639
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:39,940
I just found a weapon.

3640
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:41,660
And it's like this big...

3641
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,580
like hammer thing.

3642
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:43,900
And it's called Nutcracker.

3643
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:45,060
That's what I got earlier!

3644
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:45,540
Yeah!

3645
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:53,560
Oh my god, look at him!

3646
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:55,960
Oh no, I kinda wanna take him home.

3647
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,160
Well, I can take you...

3648
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:59,880
I can break it for you.

3649
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:02,100
Wait, wait, what was the first one, Hanya?

3650
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,560
What?

3651
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:06,280
You can do what?

3652
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:06,720
I can take...

3653
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:09,480
I can take him home?

3654
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:10,720
Yeah!

3655
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,220
Yeah!

3656
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,460
Oh, thank you!

3657
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,260
Of course!

3658
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:17,920
Do the skeletons stack?

3659
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,060
Oh my gosh, they do!

3660
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,280
I can take home so many skeletons!

3661
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,580
You can take home so many.

3662
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:25,980
I'm gonna have a whole room of skeletons.

3663
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:28,640
I'm gonna have a whole room of skeletons.

3664
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:30,260
Also, there's some guts.

3665
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:31,100
He gave you some guts.

3666
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,580
More guts to eat.

3667
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,120
Eat, eat it.

3668
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,080
Oh!

3669
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:42,530
Hey, don't yuck our yum, okay?

3670
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:43,410
Hey, don't yuck our yum, okay?

3671
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:44,990
Don't... you know...

3672
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:45,590
My bad, my bad.

3673
02:09:46,590 --> 02:09:47,470
That's delicious!

3674
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:48,390
Yeah!

3675
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:49,730
You gotta try it!

3676
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:51,030
I'm also eating the guts.

3677
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:52,510
I'm just trying not to think about it.

3678
02:09:52,610 --> 02:09:54,490
Don't knock it till you try it.

3679
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:56,190
Wait...

3680
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:58,050
More treasure over here!

3681
02:09:58,230 --> 02:09:58,830
Is it this way?

3682
02:09:58,870 --> 02:10:02,990
There's more of them!

3683
02:10:03,330 --> 02:10:04,890
There's so much treasure!

3684
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:07,470
I know, I know.

3685
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:08,970
This is how you get the good stuff.

3686
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:10,010
Nice!

3687
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:11,110
Oh!

3688
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:13,870
Ouch!

3689
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:16,070
Oh, really?

3690
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:17,990
That's cool!

3691
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:20,230
Whoa!

3692
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:23,870
I guess I just got really lucky.

3693
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:25,090
You found what?

3694
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:27,770
My weapon, Thunderbrand.

3695
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:29,030
It's a really strong weapon.

3696
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:30,670
Thunderbrand!

3697
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:31,670
So it's a gacha.

3698
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,730
Oh, what's this?

3699
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:35,490
It's kinda like a gacha every time.

3700
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:36,290
Oh, crowbar!

3701
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:41,710
Yeah, you can be the crowbar.

3702
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:42,690
Just like in their life.

3703
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:43,950
Half-life?

3704
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:45,290
Half-life.

3705
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:47,350
Half-life!

3706
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:50,650
Morgan Freeman!

3707
02:10:51,310 --> 02:10:52,110
Morgan Freeman!

3708
02:10:52,810 --> 02:10:54,130
It wasn't Morgan Freeman?

3709
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:56,130
Yeah, yeah.

3710
02:10:56,190 --> 02:10:56,710
Oh, watch out!

3711
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:57,110
Morgan Freeman!

3712
02:10:58,010 --> 02:10:59,110
Morgan Freeman!

3713
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:04,600
Oh, uh-oh.

3714
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:12,340
I died too.

3715
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:18,100
I wonder where I should build my house.

3716
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:22,540
I wonder where I should build it.

3717
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:27,980
Henyon who's Black Mesa now.

3718
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:29,040
Finally.

3719
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:31,560
Morgan Freeman!

3720
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:32,380
Morgan Freeman!

3721
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,180
Morgan Freeman!

3722
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:34,840
Morgan Freeman!

3723
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:40,730
I think that taught me really, really well, isn't it?

3724
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:41,250
Hello!

3725
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:43,290
Welcome back!

3726
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,110
Thank you!

3727
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:45,670
Born to sass people.

3728
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:49,070
Sass dayup.

3729
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:50,710
Sass dayup.

3730
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:54,210
What's sass?

3731
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:58,310
Are you being sass, Henyon?

3732
02:11:58,970 --> 02:11:59,490
Are you being sass, Henyon?

3733
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:00,110
No, she's being sassy.

3734
02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:01,490
No, I'm being sassy.

3735
02:12:02,570 --> 02:12:03,050
Sassy!

3736
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:07,410
Sassy or sassy?

3737
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:08,130
What's the difference?

3738
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:11,190
When you're like skill-ish, you die-o.

3739
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:13,430
And you're mocking me, that's being sassy, Henyon.

3740
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:14,470
And you're mocking me, that's being sassy, Henyon.

3741
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:16,290
No, you die-o.

3742
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:17,490
No, you die-o.

3743
02:12:17,490 --> 02:12:19,810
No, you die-o.

3744
02:12:22,010 --> 02:12:23,910
Geniuses are often sassy, you know.

3745
02:12:25,110 --> 02:12:25,790
Geniuses are often sassy, you know.

3746
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:28,010
Let's see...

3747
02:12:28,010 --> 02:12:29,050
Is your inventory full?

3748
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:30,970
No, it's okay though.

3749
02:12:31,070 --> 02:12:32,630
I got lots of room still.

3750
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:34,470
Nice, nice.

3751
02:12:35,130 --> 02:12:36,730
I'm ready to keep collecting.

3752
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:41,130
I think you were almost done in this floor.

3753
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:41,810
I think you were almost done in this floor.

3754
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:42,810
I think we went everywhere.

3755
02:12:43,210 --> 02:12:43,890
I think so too.

3756
02:12:46,930 --> 02:12:48,750
Is there a chest?

3757
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:49,090
No.

3758
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:50,530
Did we go all the way down here?

3759
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:52,050
Oh, I don't know.

3760
02:12:52,150 --> 02:12:52,450
Let's go.

3761
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:55,870
Which way?

3762
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:58,230
We went that way.

3763
02:12:58,250 --> 02:12:58,750
This way?

3764
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:00,930
We came from this way.

3765
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:02,370
Yeah, so...

3766
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:05,730
And have we gone all the way over here then?

3767
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:07,630
Back here?

3768
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:09,030
Yeah.

3769
02:13:10,130 --> 02:13:11,730
Because this part isn't even on the map.

3770
02:13:12,670 --> 02:13:13,730
Yeah, you're right.

3771
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:17,750
Well, I haven't gotten this one.

3772
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:18,430
Oh, me neither.

3773
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:22,270
That's why we double checked.

3774
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:23,090
Yeah, I think we have.

3775
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:24,150
I think we have.

3776
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:26,570
Hmm...

3777
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:28,590
We went this way.

3778
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:30,590
This way.

3779
02:13:30,950 --> 02:13:31,610
Outer heaven.

3780
02:13:32,290 --> 02:13:33,930
Well, I think I've gone this way.

3781
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:36,550
I think this is where I just was.

3782
02:13:40,630 --> 02:13:43,230
Apparently this mod is inspired by...

3783
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:44,830
the game is called Dead Cells?

3784
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:46,290
Oh!

3785
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:47,250
It didn't look like that.

3786
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:48,670
Oh, okay.

3787
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:50,950
I got it.

3788
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:51,790
Thank you.

3789
02:13:52,110 --> 02:13:54,230
I thought I was a goner.

3790
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:56,930
Yeah, I think we've been everywhere.

3791
02:13:57,350 --> 02:13:58,570
Yeah, I think so.

3792
02:13:58,710 --> 02:13:59,070
I think so.

3793
02:13:59,410 --> 02:14:00,550
Oh, another broadsword.

3794
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:05,690
Hmm...

3795
02:14:08,730 --> 02:14:10,170
Oh, gods.

3796
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:14,810
Zelda is universal.

3797
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:17,090
I love Zelda.

3798
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:18,970
Bleh.

3799
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:24,040
Guts.

3800
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:25,960
Oh, I didn't open this one.

3801
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:26,660
More guts.

3802
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:31,000
Guts are a balanced, well balanced breakfast.

3803
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:34,220
Guts are a balanced, well balanced breakfast.

3804
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:35,320
Eat your guts, Diana.

3805
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:35,960
Eat your guts, Diana.

3806
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,800
Mm-hmm.

3807
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:47,760
Oh, I didn't open this one too.

3808
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,240
I think that's it for Froggy's...

3809
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:50,600
I think that's it for Froggy's...

3810
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:51,420
Froggy's basement tour.

3811
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:53,200
Yeah, I think so too.

3812
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:56,520
Oh, hi, Mata!

3813
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:57,940
You guys haven't even seen Bob.

3814
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:00,860
Oh, is it Mata here?

3815
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:02,100
Yeah, she's in my chat.

3816
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:03,680
She's calling me a freak.

3817
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:04,380
Oh, hi, Mata!

3818
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:08,200
Yeah, I don't know why.

3819
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:10,560
Why am I a freak?

3820
02:15:11,620 --> 02:15:12,100
Mata!

3821
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:15,520
Are you talking about my present from Henya?

3822
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:17,300
Mata!

3823
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:23,040
It's my very precious presents.

3824
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,140
My precious thing.

3825
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,780
Yeah, she precious them.

3826
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:28,200
She want to place them in her house.

3827
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:30,880
Mata!

3828
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:31,460
Mata!

3829
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:37,560
A freak.

3830
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:40,580
I am a freaky ghost man.

3831
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:43,160
Should we go back to spawn and...

3832
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:45,140
see other stuff?

3833
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:46,540
Yeah, I guess so.

3834
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:50,040
Spawn time!

3835
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:51,220
Spawn.

3836
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:51,860
To the spawn.

3837
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:54,060
Oh.

3838
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:55,660
Spawn.

3839
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:59,620
We definitely just abandoned Froggy in there.

3840
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:00,720
Oh, you're right.

3841
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:03,640
She'll be fine.

3842
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:04,340
It's probably okay.

3843
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:06,280
Yeah, she got this.

3844
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,100
She'll be fine.

3845
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:07,960
She'll be fine.

3846
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,920
Where else should we go?

3847
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:13,380
Oh, I see the gun run in the sky is gone.

3848
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:15,120
There was a gun run in the sky?

3849
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:16,320
Wait, what?

3850
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:19,180
There was a giant painting of gun run in the sky.

3851
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:19,720
What?

3852
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:22,560
Wait, why did they get rid of it?

3853
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:23,620
I don't know.

3854
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:24,620
I got on the other day and it was just gun run.

3855
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:25,100
There's these ones.

3856
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,880
I wanted to see it.

3857
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:27,960
That's so perfect.

3858
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:29,360
They're really cursed.

3859
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:34,120
Those are so cute.

3860
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,700
These ones are so cursed.

3861
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:37,440
Oh.

3862
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:42,660
Oh yeah, there's...

3863
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:44,960
These ones.

3864
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:46,700
These beautiful portraits.

3865
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:48,200
Who made it?

3866
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:50,240
It's genius, Tayo.

3867
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:52,560
Those are perfect.

3868
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:53,740
I love those.

3869
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:55,660
I love it too.

3870
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:56,220
I love it too.

3871
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:57,600
The eyes are so scary.

3872
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,520
Oh my god.

3873
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:04,100
Rid of the gun run in the sky because it was lagging.

3874
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:04,940
Oh.

3875
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:07,860
Oh, I see it.

3876
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:09,600
The piggies too.

3877
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:13,180
What happened?

3878
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:21,260
What happened?

3879
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:21,920
Zen is

3880
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:27,240
back again.

3881
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,120
Now should I run?

3882
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:32,740
What just happened?

3883
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:33,800
Right click the button.

3884
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:37,140
Oh my god.

3885
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:38,280
Emergency!

3886
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:40,120
Emergency!

3887
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:42,880
Hold on, Zen is up there.

3888
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:44,300
Zen is gone.

3889
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:45,980
What's this?

3890
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:49,740
There's loot here.

3891
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:50,620
Oh yeah?

3892
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:52,800
Where is Zen?

3893
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:54,320
Oh, there she is.

3894
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:56,260
Oh, she left again?

3895
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:57,220
Zen!

3896
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:01,360
You intimidated her.

3897
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:04,980
Where's my genius power?

3898
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:12,590
Do you have any idea that you want to build a house on or something?

3899
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:14,150
I don't know where yet.

3900
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:15,410
I'll find somewhere.

3901
02:18:16,310 --> 02:18:16,830
Yeah.

3902
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,230
You want to see other people's house?

3903
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,850
Yeah.

3904
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:23,150
Okay.

3905
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:26,170
Oh, I want to show you the Amuchi place.

3906
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:26,650
Hold on.

3907
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:29,570
Oh, Amuchi's place is so nice.

3908
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:29,910
Wait.

3909
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:32,170
You're on my head.

3910
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:34,310
Okay.

3911
02:18:34,770 --> 02:18:35,210
Why?

3912
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:43,690
Maybe this...

3913
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:48,130
Going on my own...

3914
02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:49,270
Hello?

3915
02:18:50,590 --> 02:18:51,390
I think...

3916
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,210
It's on my head.

3917
02:18:54,050 --> 02:18:54,450
Huh?

3918
02:18:55,410 --> 02:18:55,970
I'm here.

3919
02:18:58,070 --> 02:19:00,970
I don't know how she got up there.

3920
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:01,090
What's going on?

3921
02:19:01,370 --> 02:19:02,250
Wait, what do you mean?

3922
02:19:02,970 --> 02:19:03,850
You're on my head.

3923
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:04,710
I am?

3924
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:06,330
No, you're on my head.

3925
02:19:07,150 --> 02:19:08,790
No, I'm on nobody's head.

3926
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:10,250
You're on my head.

3927
02:19:10,330 --> 02:19:11,070
No, you're on my head.

3928
02:19:11,310 --> 02:19:11,710
What?

3929
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:12,110
What?

3930
02:19:13,210 --> 02:19:15,610
She's on Hanyu's head, but she's also on my head.

3931
02:19:15,850 --> 02:19:17,710
I don't see... I see myself on...

3932
02:19:17,710 --> 02:19:19,130
Do you see me walking on the ground?

3933
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:20,070
No.

3934
02:19:20,130 --> 02:19:21,910
No, I see you on my head.

3935
02:19:22,930 --> 02:19:23,370
What?

3936
02:19:24,270 --> 02:19:26,590
Let me leave the server and I'll come back.

3937
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:27,710
Okay.

3938
02:19:30,130 --> 02:19:31,650
What is going on?

3939
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:33,590
I think the game is bugged.

3940
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:35,510
Did you see my home yet?

3941
02:19:35,650 --> 02:19:36,610
It's a hole in the ground.

3942
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:37,370
No, I haven't.

3943
02:19:38,130 --> 02:19:39,130
Going on my own...

3944
02:19:39,130 --> 02:19:40,850
A tour in Japan in a week.

3945
02:19:40,930 --> 02:19:41,530
Any recommendations?

3946
02:19:42,910 --> 02:19:43,810
Maid cafe!

3947
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:49,820
Here we go.

3948
02:19:53,320 --> 02:19:54,520
What am I wearing?

3949
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:55,280
Oh!

3950
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:00,640
Thank you!

3951
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,340
Am I normal again?

3952
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:03,900
Okay.

3953
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,900
Oh, the chimes!

3954
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:12,540
They're so cool!

3955
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:14,380
They are!

3956
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,380
They make a good sound.

3957
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:21,060
She also made this like a farm for the wool as well.

3958
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:23,780
Oh!

3959
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:24,680
Oh!

3960
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3961
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,060
Your crafting methods are so cute!

3962
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:30,520
It is!

3963
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:31,260
I know, right?

3964
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,200
It is!

3965
02:20:32,580 --> 02:20:34,800
Wait, how does it farm?

3966
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:37,660
Um...

3967
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:39,720
I think there's a scissor inside.

3968
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:41,960
And a shear shear inside.

3969
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:43,120
Oh, I see it!

3970
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:47,460
But I think it's not working because the shears are broken.

3971
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:49,760
Oh, it's down here!

3972
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,800
It's all working, I think.

3973
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,040
Oh, it's this snail thing again.

3974
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:55,500
Scary.

3975
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:57,380
Oh!

3976
02:20:57,380 --> 02:20:57,840
Oh, God!

3977
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:00,120
I need to...

3978
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:07,420
Oh, how do I get out?

3979
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:07,880
Oh, there we go.

3980
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:11,480
Mmm!

3981
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:15,080
And this is her room.

3982
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:15,940
Right here.

3983
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:17,440
Whoa!

3984
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:20,640
Oh, my gosh!

3985
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:21,700
She also has dead people!

3986
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:24,000
Oh?

3987
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:25,580
Maybe I should add.

3988
02:21:27,230 --> 02:21:28,600
Rod and corpse.

3989
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:30,440
Corpse.

3990
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:33,000
Skele-man.

3991
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,260
Corpse, corpse, Skele-man.

3992
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:38,540
I like the skeleton.

3993
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:39,500
I do too.

3994
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:40,280
He's really cute.

3995
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:40,720
Yeah, me too.

3996
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:41,080
I like it.

3997
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:46,840
Also, when you put the corpse on the ground, it makes the mushy sound like...

3998
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:48,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3999
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:52,140
Whoa.

4000
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:53,560
Wait, whose house is this?

4001
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,320
This is Ruth's.

4002
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:56,120
Oh, okay, okay.

4003
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:58,900
Whoa, there's a piggy head too!

4004
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:00,520
Yeah!

4005
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:03,200
They are.

4006
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:03,800
They are.

4007
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:07,120
I knew you were gonna do that.

4008
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:08,840
I knew you were gonna do that.

4009
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:09,300
I'm safe.

4010
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:10,200
I'm safe!

4011
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:12,200
Nice!

4012
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:12,940
Yeah!

4013
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:18,520
I'll go around.

4014
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:20,740
I'll go down.

4015
02:22:20,940 --> 02:22:21,320
Here we go.

4016
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:24,260
What is this?

4017
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:26,580
Is there anything down here?

4018
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:28,540
Oh wait, there is some stuff down here.

4019
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,960
Oh, wait a minute.

4020
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:32,140
This is...

4021
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:34,740
This is where the treasure at, wasn't it?

4022
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:35,520
Treasure?

4023
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:36,740
More treasure?

4024
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:40,460
Oh, what is that?

4025
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:41,620
I think there is treasure around here.

4026
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:46,350
I think there is treasure around here.

4027
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:46,690
You good?

4028
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:48,790
Yep, I'm okay.

4029
02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:50,570
Oh,

4030
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:56,490
there's the treasure.

4031
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:57,150
There's the treasure.

4032
02:22:59,830 --> 02:23:00,350
Zombie.

4033
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:06,810
Whoa, there's a lot of stuff in here.

4034
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:07,350
Whoa!

4035
02:23:09,490 --> 02:23:12,070
Wait, is this the same where it's different for everybody?

4036
02:23:13,070 --> 02:23:15,710
It's different for everybody, so you can take it.

4037
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:19,590
Except the regular chest, you can take everything inside.

4038
02:23:20,050 --> 02:23:20,310
Oh, nice!

4039
02:23:20,610 --> 02:23:21,010
Wow.

4040
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:24,170
Oh my gosh, I'm actually gonna run out of space.

4041
02:23:26,370 --> 02:23:27,330
Tomato seeds.

4042
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:32,990
They used to have mimics, but I don't know, maybe it was lagging the server.

4043
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:33,990
It's gone now.

4044
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:34,710
What's a mimic?

4045
02:23:35,090 --> 02:23:36,730
Oh, like it would eat you.

4046
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:41,050
Yeah, it's like a freedom, but it's gone now.

4047
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:42,930
And then...

4048
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:43,490
No!

4049
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:46,990
Oh, wait.

4050
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:48,050
Take this.

4051
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:51,750
So, yeah.

4052
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:53,330
I think that's the treasure.

4053
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:58,370
I forgot to tell you important things.

4054
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:02,670
Do you remember the place that we changed the heights?

4055
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:03,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4056
02:24:04,570 --> 02:24:10,690
There is a green portal, and when you go there, it leads to a mirror world from this one.

4057
02:24:11,890 --> 02:24:20,070
That one is for resource, so when you get a lot of wood, when you want to get a lot of wood, or dirt, or stuff like that, you can get it from there.

4058
02:24:21,690 --> 02:24:22,630
That's so awesome!

4059
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:26,670
So you don't take everything from this world.

4060
02:24:28,690 --> 02:24:35,730
If you want to keep the landscape, but you want to get a lot of material from the mirror world, I didn't get all the stuff you need.

4061
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:37,030
That's so smart!

4062
02:24:37,330 --> 02:24:38,210
That's so awesome!

4063
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:39,870
Oh my gosh.

4064
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:42,550
And yeah, this place is amazing.

4065
02:24:43,850 --> 02:24:44,650
It is!

4066
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:49,210
It was my first time modding Minecraft as well, but I love it so much.

4067
02:24:49,310 --> 02:24:50,790
Yeah, I can see why.

4068
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:53,490
Hello!

4069
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:55,670
I think Zen is having connection problems.

4070
02:24:56,370 --> 02:24:56,770
Oh!

4071
02:24:57,130 --> 02:25:03,310
Yeah, I ran up to her when she was on, and she had that disconnect symbol next to her, and I think that's why she keeps logging in and logging out.

4072
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:04,090
Oh!

4073
02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:08,150
Yeah, she's got connection problems, I think.

4074
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:10,970
Why is that happening to her?

4075
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:11,850
I don't know.

4076
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:13,770
I wish she could join us.

4077
02:25:14,970 --> 02:25:15,410
Yeah.

4078
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:16,910
Yeah.

4079
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:19,990
That happened to Heavenly too?

4080
02:25:20,290 --> 02:25:22,750
Yeah, Heavenly can't get on anymore.

4081
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:23,490
Really?

4082
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:26,410
Alright, Zen!

4083
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:28,430
Um...

4084
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:31,810
Um...

4085
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:32,930
Um...

4086
02:25:32,930 --> 02:25:33,170
Man!

4087
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:38,980
I think maybe Zen is fine.

4088
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:44,540
Oh, she makes me so mad sometimes.

4089
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:45,660
I think she's fine.

4090
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:46,440
I think she's fine.

4091
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:46,980
Yeah.

4092
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:49,800
Yeah, the disconnect thing!

4093
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:54,060
I worried for no reason.

4094
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:55,560
I worried for no reason.

4095
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:55,820
What's that?

4096
02:25:58,320 --> 02:25:58,980
What's that?

4097
02:25:59,080 --> 02:25:59,100
Oh!

4098
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:03,180
Oh, it's that guy again.

4099
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:04,080
What does this thing do?

4100
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:07,300
What does he do?

4101
02:26:07,460 --> 02:26:07,900
This guy.

4102
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:08,440
Oh!

4103
02:26:08,460 --> 02:26:12,980
When you find him for like three times, after you find him, he'll be gone.

4104
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:16,140
And after you find him for three times, he'll give you a gift.

4105
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:16,800
Oh!

4106
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:19,740
It's that one guy.

4107
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:20,480
Yeah.

4108
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:23,940
Oh, there he is!

4109
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:26,260
Oh, he's escaping!

4110
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:27,600
He's climbing up!

4111
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:28,840
No, sir!

4112
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:31,440
Sir!

4113
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,680
Okay, okay, he's gone again.

4114
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:33,340
We gotta go find him.

4115
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:35,520
But that was the third time!

4116
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:35,560
But that was the third time!

4117
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:39,060
Third, third, or fourth?

4118
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:41,820
I forgot, but you have to find him for multiple times.

4119
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:42,120
Okay.

4120
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:44,980
Oh, I see him, I see him, I see him!

4121
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:46,380
Right here.

4122
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:50,700
He gave...

4123
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:51,660
something.

4124
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,760
What was it?

4125
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:56,660
Take it, take it.

4126
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:57,740
A bundle.

4127
02:26:59,520 --> 02:26:59,960
Oh!

4128
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:02,480
Yeah, there's a...

4129
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:04,440
gold blocks in it.

4130
02:27:04,820 --> 02:27:05,260
Oh!

4131
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:06,920
Where did it go?

4132
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:08,240
Oh, oh, oh!

4133
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:09,480
Oh, oh, oh!

4134
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:10,140
I need this one.

4135
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:11,660
Do you want your potatoes back?

4136
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:14,480
No, no, it's okay, I have a lot of potatoes.

4137
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:15,940
Okay, thank you!

4138
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:19,020
Oh, I'm gonna put the mailbox...

4139
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:20,340
Wait, how do I put the mailbox...

4140
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:20,900
Oh, there we go.

4141
02:27:24,460 --> 02:27:24,900
Nice!

4142
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:26,760
Nice!

4143
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:27,480
Cool!

4144
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:28,700
Yeah!

4145
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:31,880
What a cool guy.

4146
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:35,180
Hard to combat...

4147
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:37,100
Yeah, he just kind of shows up randomly.

4148
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:38,760
He really likes Mata's...

4149
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,060
dirt house hole.

4150
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:41,900
Oh wait, I heard about that.

4151
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:43,720
He shows up there a lot.

4152
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:44,520
Really?

4153
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:45,660
Yeah.

4154
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:47,320
I wonder why.

4155
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:50,340
I wonder why.

4156
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,660
Mata, you have someone living in your house.

4157
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:54,120
Oh my gosh, he scared me.

4158
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:56,400
Yeah, someone taking over your house, Mata.

4159
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:56,920
Yeah!

4160
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:00,520
Come back and claim it.

4161
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:02,260
How do we get out of here?

4162
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:04,260
Oh, we go up here.

4163
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:04,780
That's right.

4164
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:08,320
Yeah!

4165
02:28:09,460 --> 02:28:10,240
I can't see.

4166
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:13,500
I don't know how I'm climbing.

4167
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:15,580
I don't know how I'm climbing, but I'm climbing.

4168
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:17,260
I don't know how this is happening.

4169
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:18,060
Oh god!

4170
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:20,400
Oh, there we go.

4171
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:22,500
I don't know how that happened.

4172
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,180
Careful, careful.

4173
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:26,440
Are you okay?

4174
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:27,920
Did Hennie just fall?

4175
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:28,900
Good, thank you.

4176
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:31,500
What a thrill.

4177
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:32,060
I think I need a spell.

4178
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:35,080
Has Hennie met Hennie Jr. yet?

4179
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:37,020
Wait, what is Hennie Jr.?

4180
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:38,480
Hennie Jr.?

4181
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:40,800
What is a Hennie Jr. dial?

4182
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:42,460
What is that?

4183
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:43,780
What?

4184
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:47,480
I have a Hennie Jr.?

4185
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:48,020
What?

4186
02:28:48,100 --> 02:28:49,660
Would you like your corpses back, Mint?

4187
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,180
Yeah, I think I missed them.

4188
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:56,200
I can take it.

4189
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:59,120
I can do it for you.

4190
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,080
Thank you.

4191
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:04,340
I think you like them more than I do.

4192
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:07,340
Here, I'll stand really close.

4193
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:08,260
Oh.

4194
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:12,700
Thank you.

4195
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:13,480
Here you go.

4196
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:16,820
Thank you.

4197
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,620
Something must be sacrificed.

4198
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:21,500
I'll sacrifice this dagger.

4199
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:24,180
You know what?

4200
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:25,540
You have a trash can.

4201
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:27,080
At the bottom.

4202
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:30,180
So if you put your item, you don't need it over there.

4203
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:30,640
Oh.

4204
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:32,500
Yeah.

4205
02:29:33,820 --> 02:29:34,260
What?

4206
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:36,960
And then it's gone forever?

4207
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:38,620
Yeah.

4208
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:40,560
Yeah, it'll be gone forever.

4209
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:42,140
You can get it back out.

4210
02:29:42,340 --> 02:29:44,380
As long as you don't put something else in the trash can.

4211
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:45,060
Oh.

4212
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:48,900
But if you put something else in there, then it's gone.

4213
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,060
That's crazy.

4214
02:29:51,340 --> 02:29:51,780
Yeah.

4215
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,200
Bing bong bing.

4216
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,700
Bing bong.

4217
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,400
Bing bong bing.

4218
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:01,480
Just keep adding stuff to it.

4219
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:05,280
I don't know what else to add.

4220
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:06,340
I need everything else.

4221
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:07,280
Everything else is precious.

4222
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,220
Cook.

4223
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:13,580
We got so many stuff over here.

4224
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:16,280
I know.

4225
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:17,580
Oh no.

4226
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:18,420
Everybody's leaving.

4227
02:30:18,460 --> 02:30:19,300
Everybody's leaving.

4228
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,120
What's happening?

4229
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:26,600
Is there a bee in here?

4230
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:27,920
Oh, it's a bee lamp.

4231
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:28,660
That's so cute.

4232
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:30,620
Yeah.

4233
02:30:31,300 --> 02:30:33,040
I can make you one if you want to.

4234
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:33,800
But...

4235
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:34,840
Uh...

4236
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:38,160
So...

4237
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:42,120
Sometimes you might will get some item you don't know how to use it.

4238
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:43,360
Yeah.

4239
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,300
And then when you go to the...

4240
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:46,760
When you...

4241
02:30:46,760 --> 02:30:53,940
When you're pointing at the item you don't know how to use it and press U, it'll show you the recipe of what can you do with it.

4242
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:55,460
Oh, really?

4243
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:56,520
Wait, you press what?

4244
02:30:58,660 --> 02:30:58,800
U.

4245
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:00,240
U.

4246
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,540
U.

4247
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:04,220
Yeah.

4248
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:07,140
U.

4249
02:31:07,780 --> 02:31:08,100
U.

4250
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:12,720
So you can see it.

4251
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:13,220
With U.

4252
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,740
Oh my god.

4253
02:31:17,620 --> 02:31:18,460
What?

4254
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,920
Oh my god, there's so much.

4255
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:26,460
There is.

4256
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:27,580
There is.

4257
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:29,780
Ooh.

4258
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:31,660
Witch's house.

4259
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:34,320
This is so cute.

4260
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:35,440
It is.

4261
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:38,200
Oh, do you want to go to End City?

4262
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:42,120
Do you want to touch a waystone so you can go back anytime you want?

4263
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:42,740
Oh, sure.

4264
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:44,840
Okay.

4265
02:31:45,220 --> 02:31:45,820
Here we go.

4266
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:50,420
Oh.

4267
02:31:55,480 --> 02:31:56,820
She left us, everybody.

4268
02:31:59,140 --> 02:31:59,660
Now...

4269
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:02,020
We're just out here.

4270
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:03,500
And then...

4271
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:05,100
Oh, gloomy bear.

4272
02:32:07,480 --> 02:32:08,120
There's...

4273
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:09,380
There's a big old gloomy bear.

4274
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:11,080
Um...

4275
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:12,960
There's this house over here.

4276
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:14,040
Oh, there's a waystone here.

4277
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:17,140
This is the kitten hole?

4278
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:19,140
Uh...

4279
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:24,960
She hates us.

4280
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:27,080
She hates us!

4281
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:27,560
Oh.

4282
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:28,920
Huh?

4283
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:29,500
Huh?

4284
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:36,280
What?

4285
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:38,100
Who hates you?

4286
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:38,760
No, no.

4287
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:39,820
Oh, oh, oh.

4288
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:40,240
Nothing.

4289
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:41,900
Huh?

4290
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:43,620
Huh?

4291
02:32:45,220 --> 02:32:46,360
She's hiding something.

4292
02:32:46,700 --> 02:32:48,060
No, no, no, no.

4293
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:50,200
No, no, no, no.

4294
02:32:50,380 --> 02:32:51,620
She's hiding something.

4295
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:54,160
The end.

4296
02:32:54,500 --> 02:32:58,000
Is there anything different in here or is it the same as normal?

4297
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:00,040
Oh, it's a lot different.

4298
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:01,340
It's a lot different, too.

4299
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:01,940
It is?

4300
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:04,620
Wait, is it?

4301
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:06,160
A little different.

4302
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:08,020
Not crazy different, I think.

4303
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:09,260
But it's different.

4304
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:09,940
Hmm.

4305
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:12,840
Let's see.

4306
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:15,100
Anything...

4307
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:16,500
Oh, wait, there's trees in here!

4308
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:21,260
There's trees.

4309
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:22,680
End...

4310
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:23,720
Midlands.

4311
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:25,040
What's this?

4312
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,620
It's a special kind of tree.

4313
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:29,340
Preem log.

4314
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:29,820
Oh, no.

4315
02:33:30,380 --> 02:33:31,540
Everybody keeps crashing.

4316
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:32,340
Is it me?

4317
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,780
Am I the problem?

4318
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,040
Hiya!

4319
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:36,580
Welcome back!

4320
02:33:36,660 --> 02:33:37,780
Did it crash for you, too?

4321
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:42,780
Why are we in the end?

4322
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:45,400
Oh, because I thought she was...

4323
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:45,760
So much happened!

4324
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:48,840
So much happened.

4325
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:49,180
Ah!

4326
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:49,300
Ah!

4327
02:33:53,020 --> 02:33:54,000
What's wrong with him?

4328
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:54,960
Why is he among us?

4329
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:03,620
Oh, man.

4330
02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:07,940
So, I think the problem is Zen's house.

4331
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,800
Because I crashed, too, when I went near Zen's house.

4332
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:10,600
Oh.

4333
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:12,080
Yeah.

4334
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:12,720
Wait, really?

4335
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,760
We went with no problems, though.

4336
02:34:15,460 --> 02:34:17,340
Yeah, the first time I went with no problems.

4337
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:18,580
But then when I went again...

4338
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:20,520
What happened to the armor I gave you?

4339
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,640
It broke because everybody kills me every five seconds.

4340
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:24,840
No!

4341
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:26,320
I have no more armor.

4342
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:28,400
Because everything breaks.

4343
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:29,480
No!

4344
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:33,120
Sad value.

4345
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:35,860
Everybody kills me every five seconds.

4346
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:45,660
I'm trying to not make eye contact with any of these enemies, but because I know I shouldn't look at them, I want to look at them.

4347
02:34:45,740 --> 02:34:45,920
I know.

4348
02:34:46,180 --> 02:34:46,520
Oh, wait.

4349
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:47,280
Hold on.

4350
02:34:47,300 --> 02:34:50,240
This is not the end zone I was trying to take her with.

4351
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:51,260
Hold on.

4352
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:51,780
What's different?

4353
02:34:57,560 --> 02:34:58,280
Where did she go?

4354
02:34:58,960 --> 02:34:59,920
I don't know.

4355
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:01,740
She's gone.

4356
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:02,440
She left us.

4357
02:35:03,020 --> 02:35:06,100
There's some weird Endermen that look like Among Us.

4358
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:08,800
What?

4359
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:10,380
That guy right there.

4360
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:12,100
Oh, yeah.

4361
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:13,580
He attacks on...

4362
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:15,880
You don't need to look at him for him to attack.

4363
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:17,220
If he just sees you, he'll attack you.

4364
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:18,580
Okay, okay.

4365
02:35:19,940 --> 02:35:21,020
I think we should go.

4366
02:35:21,140 --> 02:35:23,040
Oh, thank you.

4367
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:27,580
So, if you ever want to go to the ender dragon and stuff, it's right here.

4368
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:27,840
What is that?

4369
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:31,280
That's an annoying thing.

4370
02:35:33,220 --> 02:35:33,900
Not friend.

4371
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:34,840
Where's the...

4372
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:37,220
Oh, Henya!

4373
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:38,900
Henya!

4374
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:40,080
Hold on.

4375
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:40,500
Come here, Henya.

4376
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:42,540
Oh, no.

4377
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:45,860
How do I pick you guys up?

4378
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:46,720
Help!

4379
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:46,820
Help!

4380
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:48,200
Help!

4381
02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:51,420
Henya!

4382
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:52,480
Come here!

4383
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:57,460
Oh, there you go.

4384
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:59,780
You're on my head now.

4385
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:01,900
How do I get Henya off my head?

4386
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:03,840
Wait, I'm not.

4387
02:36:04,860 --> 02:36:05,880
You're on my head for me.

4388
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:06,180
It's okay.

4389
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:07,060
I'll just keep you on my head.

4390
02:36:07,160 --> 02:36:08,680
Wait, I don't see you on her head either.

4391
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:10,620
Yeah, I'm not.

4392
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:12,500
You are for me.

4393
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:13,220
What?

4394
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,040
It's okay.

4395
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:16,380
I'll just have a pet.

4396
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:18,640
River's having a little bit of trouble, I think.

4397
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:20,600
Yeah, it's a little laggy today.

4398
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:22,780
Wait, is there a way stone here?

4399
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:23,460
Or...

4400
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:25,340
Oh, this way, this way, this way.

4401
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:27,820
I don't know where this way is.

4402
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:29,540
Henya's still on my head.

4403
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:32,200
Wait, where is...

4404
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,460
Right here, right here.

4405
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:34,600
Oh, I see it.

4406
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:35,300
It blended in.

4407
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,000
Nice.

4408
02:36:37,060 --> 02:36:38,120
And portal dial.

4409
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:40,440
It's so cool in here too.

4410
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:42,640
Yeah, but...

4411
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:45,260
It looks a lot different as well.

4412
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:46,620
Yeah, it looks so different.

4413
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:47,680
Oh, I...

4414
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:50,080
Monster Hunter.

4415
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:50,980
I can't...

4416
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:51,740
Monster Hunter.

4417
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:52,800
Monster Hunter.

4418
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:52,840
Monster Hunter.

4419
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:53,140
Monster Hunter.

4420
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:57,360
Wait, you play Monster Hunter?

4421
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:02,420
No, but right now, actually there's a sale on a bunch of Monster Hunter games.

4422
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:03,520
I want to get them.

4423
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:07,640
I'm playing World right now, so if you ever want to play it with me, I'm always available.

4424
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:09,140
Okay, that fixed it.

4425
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:09,800
That fixed it.

4426
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:10,800
You got it?

4427
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:14,740
Yeah, I logged out and logged back in so I could fix it.

4428
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,320
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4429
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:17,960
Mermaid.

4430
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:20,540
Oh, yeah.

4431
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:23,180
Wait, these are like rainbow candles.

4432
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:24,660
They're cute.

4433
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:25,640
They're really cute.

4434
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:27,100
It is pretty.

4435
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:31,060
I want to steal them.

4436
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:33,000
Do it.

4437
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:34,040
Take it.

4438
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:34,960
Steal it.

4439
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:37,760
No one can stop me.

4440
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:40,780
There's a lot.

4441
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:42,420
There's a lot of places to explore.

4442
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:44,400
If you ever want to, you can.

4443
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:45,940
Names.

4444
02:37:45,940 --> 02:37:47,120
So many name tags.

4445
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:48,440
Yeah.

4446
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:50,680
Wowee.

4447
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:53,560
I'm out of space.

4448
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:55,520
I think we should get the good backpack for you.

4449
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:57,000
I'm gonna get it.

4450
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:58,580
That's okay.

4451
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:01,680
Mouse can help you for a prize.

4452
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:02,920
For a prize.

4453
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,820
I can give her.

4454
02:38:05,380 --> 02:38:06,020
It's okay.

4455
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:07,320
I don't really care about my soul.

4456
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,920
Do I have it?

4457
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:13,720
Do they stack?

4458
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:17,040
Man, where was the Henya Lone Shark hospitality?

4459
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:18,240
For me, huh?

4460
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:18,960
Helmet.

4461
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:19,700
What do you mean?

4462
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:23,440
I'm Henya the Generous.

4463
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:25,760
Hi, Henya.

4464
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,780
You've been an amazing tour guide.

4465
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:29,360
You've been so nice.

4466
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:30,580
So everything.

4467
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:32,400
Yeah.

4468
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:34,160
You stole my candle.

4469
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:37,460
Henya.

4470
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:38,740
No, no.

4471
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:39,900
She stole my candle.

4472
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:45,080
Everything comes with a price, Addy.

4473
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:46,340
Yep.

4474
02:38:46,580 --> 02:38:47,860
Nothing is free, Dayo.

4475
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:49,380
Nothing is free, Dayo.

4476
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:50,900
It's okay, Henya.

4477
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:51,340
If you want...

4478
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:54,000
If you need a henchman for your business, I'm here for you.

4479
02:38:54,360 --> 02:38:57,180
I thank you that my business is bad, Dayo.

4480
02:38:57,260 --> 02:38:59,000
Henya, I built a watermelon for you.

4481
02:39:00,860 --> 02:39:01,800
That is true.

4482
02:39:02,060 --> 02:39:03,940
It took you seven hours, you said?

4483
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:05,460
It took me seven hours.

4484
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:06,600
Seven hours?

4485
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:07,420
No way.

4486
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:08,300
Oh, wait.

4487
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:09,120
Have you shown her?

4488
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,340
Oh yeah, I did.

4489
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:13,100
Do you remember the Curlsprays watermelon?

4490
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:14,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4491
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:15,320
That's the watermelon.

4492
02:39:15,700 --> 02:39:16,500
Oh my god.

4493
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:19,480
It took a long time.

4494
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:21,100
Very long time.

4495
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:23,380
Super long.

4496
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:26,140
We also made a wall for the mochi house too.

4497
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:26,880
You wanna see it?

4498
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:29,620
Let's go spawn.

4499
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:30,840
Spawn.

4500
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:37,320
Okay, so this way.

4501
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:42,340
This way.

4502
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:50,960
Henya Junior is there?

4503
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:52,000
What the heck?

4504
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,100
What is a Henya Junior?

4505
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:55,680
Okay, I need to see the Henya Junior.

4506
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:59,840
When the heck did I get the Henya Junior, Dayo?

4507
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:03,320
Oh, so cute.

4508
02:40:04,460 --> 02:40:06,480
Yeah, her place is so cute.

4509
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:08,860
Let's see.

4510
02:40:11,060 --> 02:40:15,080
She stole the dirt from my chest, so I gave her the wall of dirt.

4511
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:15,620
She stole the dirt from my chest, so I gave her the wall of dirt.

4512
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:16,940
You see the square dirt over there?

4513
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,720
I gave her a wall of dirt.

4514
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:19,820
Oh, I see it.

4515
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:22,260
Up there, that wall?

4516
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:24,240
Yeah, the huge, yeah.

4517
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:25,060
Wow.

4518
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:26,900
I and I the mouse did it together.

4519
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:30,940
Her place is so fun.

4520
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:31,940
Her place is so fun.

4521
02:40:32,560 --> 02:40:33,960
When you go down here...

4522
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:35,200
Yeah, this way, this way.

4523
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:36,300
This way, this way.

4524
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:36,680
This way?

4525
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:36,920
Okay.

4526
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:39,580
There's a...

4527
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:42,840
There's a toilet.

4528
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:46,580
But you can go in the...

4529
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:47,180
Oh.

4530
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:50,660
But you're revving up to use the toilet?

4531
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:51,880
Is that what's going on?

4532
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:53,780
Yeah, I'm revving up to use the toilet.

4533
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:54,200
Okay.

4534
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:57,980
It's okay, I get it.

4535
02:40:58,020 --> 02:40:59,300
We all have a little bit of...

4536
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,020
Something to get out of there, you know?

4537
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:03,700
There's a gun run on the ceiling.

4538
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:04,920
Oh.

4539
02:41:06,620 --> 02:41:08,420
Yeah, there's a gun on the ceiling.

4540
02:41:08,660 --> 02:41:09,320
Can you see it?

4541
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:10,400
Yeah, I see him.

4542
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:12,260
Oh.

4543
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:15,000
Hanya.

4544
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:17,000
Hanya, you had one job.

4545
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:19,340
No, no, it's not me.

4546
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:20,500
I think Mochi did it.

4547
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:20,880
I wonder.

4548
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,880
Did you just say dang it?

4549
02:41:27,980 --> 02:41:29,380
What did I hear from you?

4550
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:30,480
No, no, no, no.

4551
02:41:30,660 --> 02:41:32,160
I think Mochi is somewhere.

4552
02:41:33,220 --> 02:41:35,520
Do you think she's like, maybe she's invisible?

4553
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:36,540
She pulled the lever?

4554
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:38,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4555
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:39,400
I'm pretty sure she did it.

4556
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,660
I don't see her on the server.

4557
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:44,320
I don't see her.

4558
02:41:44,460 --> 02:41:49,900
They have legs?

4559
02:41:55,910 --> 02:41:57,330
What else is in here?

4560
02:41:58,470 --> 02:41:59,290
I don't know.

4561
02:41:59,350 --> 02:42:01,230
Her place is like a lot of...

4562
02:42:01,230 --> 02:42:02,990
You can go a lot of places.

4563
02:42:03,250 --> 02:42:03,490
Hmm.

4564
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:08,070
I like the fish tanks.

4565
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:13,460
Oh!

4566
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,120
I thought this was a person.

4567
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:25,340
She has security cameras and everything.

4568
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:26,680
Yup.

4569
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:28,280
I'm gonna give her something.

4570
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:31,320
A lot of security cameras over here.

4571
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:31,800
Yeah.

4572
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:34,120
What should I give her?

4573
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:36,960
A lot of stuff.

4574
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:37,660
You know what?

4575
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:38,520
I'll keep everything.

4576
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:40,800
Ew, they walk.

4577
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:41,820
There's a Herobrine again!

4578
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:43,620
Why there's a Herobrine everywhere?

4579
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:45,120
Up there too!

4580
02:42:45,380 --> 02:42:45,760
Oh my gosh!

4581
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:47,100
That's terrifying!

4582
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,720
I found another one right there!

4583
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:51,520
I've been jumpscared by so many of those.

4584
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:53,400
There's so many of them!

4585
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:54,440
Oh, I see them right there!

4586
02:42:55,140 --> 02:42:56,680
It's really realistic looking.

4587
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:58,360
It's in here too!

4588
02:42:58,520 --> 02:42:59,280
Do you see them?

4589
02:42:59,780 --> 02:43:00,760
Oh my god.

4590
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:01,400
Where?

4591
02:43:02,740 --> 02:43:03,460
Up there.

4592
02:43:03,460 --> 02:43:03,620
Over here.

4593
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:05,880
Over here, right?

4594
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:07,420
Right here, right here.

4595
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:09,860
No, no, no.

4596
02:43:09,880 --> 02:43:10,500
Right here, right here.

4597
02:43:10,700 --> 02:43:11,600
Stand right here.

4598
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:15,700
And look that way.

4599
02:43:15,980 --> 02:43:16,740
I see them.

4600
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:19,360
On the wall, right?

4601
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:20,980
Uh...

4602
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:23,660
I think you're looking at the different direction.

4603
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:25,540
There's more?

4604
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:25,840
Oh!

4605
02:43:26,580 --> 02:43:27,420
Oh my god!

4606
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:29,180
Oh my god, I see them!

4607
02:43:30,380 --> 02:43:30,780
Wow!

4608
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:31,200
Where are they?

4609
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:35,360
Scary though.

4610
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:35,620
Scary!

4611
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:39,380
Why I can't see in here?

4612
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:45,100
I think this is her mining area?

4613
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:46,280
I don't know.

4614
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:46,780
Maybe, yeah.

4615
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:55,280
Can't see out anywhere in here.

4616
02:43:56,540 --> 02:43:57,340
Water!

4617
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:01,380
I'm lost?

4618
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:03,000
Oh, water!

4619
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:05,200
Haha!

4620
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:08,520
I'm just gonna drop down.

4621
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,700
Oh, never mind.

4622
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:12,520
Oh!

4623
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:13,760
Oh, it's all the...

4624
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:15,440
Oh, she has a limpid too!

4625
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:17,080
Oh yeah, she has a limpid too!

4626
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:19,560
What's this?

4627
02:44:26,220 --> 02:44:27,900
She got a lot of stuff.

4628
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:28,720
Yeah.

4629
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:29,900
Fish tank.

4630
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:31,400
Wait, I don't see any genie here.

4631
02:44:31,420 --> 02:44:31,980
Where is that?

4632
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:33,720
Prismarite?

4633
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:36,380
Prismarite?

4634
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:38,260
Yeah, where's Henea junior?

4635
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:40,860
Wait!

4636
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:43,660
Four skins?

4637
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:46,400
Four skins...

4638
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:47,060
skin.

4639
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:48,940
Henea junior?

4640
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:51,480
Four skin junior.

4641
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:53,860
So many!

4642
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:54,720
So many!

4643
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:57,720
There's just so many...

4644
02:44:57,720 --> 02:45:00,660
Is she a nature over here?

4645
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:03,720
Okay.

4646
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:05,620
Why are there so many?

4647
02:45:05,960 --> 02:45:07,720
She got the Henea junior at the dome.

4648
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:08,500
Is this it?

4649
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:10,760
No, fourth...

4650
02:45:11,660 --> 02:45:12,360
This way.

4651
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:14,880
Up here?

4652
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:16,900
She got the beautiful dorm as well.

4653
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:19,840
No, not this way.

4654
02:45:21,860 --> 02:45:23,980
This is definitely a meaty place, yeah.

4655
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:26,160
I think so too.

4656
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:30,160
She also has a little man.

4657
02:45:30,500 --> 02:45:30,800
Wow!

4658
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:32,340
Look at it!

4659
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:33,160
Oh my goodness!

4660
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:35,020
This table is so good!

4661
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:39,880
The axolotls are all so many different colors.

4662
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:41,400
Who is that?

4663
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:43,000
Who is that?

4664
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:44,400
What is this?

4665
02:45:44,780 --> 02:45:46,260
Who is that, you guys?

4666
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:47,400
Who is that?

4667
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:50,920
Is it black?

4668
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:52,420
No!

4669
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:52,480
No!

4670
02:45:53,620 --> 02:45:54,560
I'm scared!

4671
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:56,720
It's mint!

4672
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:57,820
No, it's black!

4673
02:45:58,380 --> 02:45:59,040
What?

4674
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:03,430
Thank you!

4675
02:46:03,570 --> 02:46:04,570
Thank you!

4676
02:46:04,570 --> 02:46:06,310
Thank you, Ari!

4677
02:46:08,290 --> 02:46:09,390
What's gun run?

4678
02:46:09,650 --> 02:46:10,110
Gun run!

4679
02:46:11,930 --> 02:46:13,710
Oh my god, these are alive!

4680
02:46:14,290 --> 02:46:14,890
Oh my god!

4681
02:46:15,330 --> 02:46:16,230
Haruka junior?

4682
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:33,710
Ari junior, fruit junior, Kuro junior, Giga junior, Matan junior, Dusclap junior, Iron mouse junior, Heavenly junior, Sushi junior, Joel junior, Is there, is there, Hennya junior maybe in here?

4683
02:46:33,890 --> 02:46:34,670
Maybe in here?

4684
02:46:35,750 --> 02:46:36,510
Hennya junior!

4685
02:46:36,710 --> 02:46:37,710
Oh no, it's just Hennya!

4686
02:46:39,210 --> 02:46:39,630
Huh?

4687
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:40,890
Hennya junior!

4688
02:46:41,170 --> 02:46:42,250
Right here, right here!

4689
02:46:42,930 --> 02:46:44,290
Where's, where's my junior?

4690
02:46:45,690 --> 02:46:46,690
He's right...

4691
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:48,150
here.

4692
02:46:49,610 --> 02:46:51,690
If you look, here, here, here.

4693
02:46:51,690 --> 02:46:52,790
Right there, right there.

4694
02:46:56,050 --> 02:46:56,970
Hennya junior!

4695
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:57,730
Hennya junior!

4696
02:46:58,750 --> 02:46:59,130
Hennya junior!

4697
02:46:59,130 --> 02:46:59,510
Did I eat it?

4698
02:46:59,710 --> 02:47:02,130
Oh, did you eat yourself?

4699
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:05,030
No, no, of course not, of course not.

4700
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:06,390
I will never, I will never.

4701
02:47:07,890 --> 02:47:09,750
Is that germa?

4702
02:47:10,370 --> 02:47:11,350
Gingerbread picnic.

4703
02:47:11,810 --> 02:47:13,090
Please don't eat it.

4704
02:47:13,130 --> 02:47:14,090
Is this germa?

4705
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:17,930
We can eat them?

4706
02:47:19,470 --> 02:47:21,110
Thank goodness I didn't eat them.

4707
02:47:22,650 --> 02:47:24,010
Thank goodness I didn't eat them.

4708
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:24,130
Oh.

4709
02:47:25,370 --> 02:47:26,550
During the picnic?

4710
02:47:26,730 --> 02:47:27,690
That's so cute.

4711
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:34,080
This germa...

4712
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:35,280
On the other side?

4713
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:36,640
What's this?

4714
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:38,460
Germa-san.

4715
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:40,260
Germa?

4716
02:47:40,280 --> 02:47:40,800
Germa?

4717
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:42,240
Germa-san?

4718
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:43,720
Germa-san.

4719
02:47:44,100 --> 02:47:45,280
Yeah, I think he's on the wall.

4720
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:46,940
Oh, really?

4721
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:47,960
Yeah, right here.

4722
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:49,460
Huh?

4723
02:47:53,930 --> 02:47:55,110
Wait, that's a germa-san?

4724
02:47:55,390 --> 02:47:55,850
I think so.

4725
02:47:56,550 --> 02:47:59,010
Oh, everybody talking about him.

4726
02:47:59,010 --> 02:48:00,730
But I never know what does he look like.

4727
02:48:00,750 --> 02:48:02,090
Now I see him.

4728
02:48:02,270 --> 02:48:03,090
Germa-san!

4729
02:48:07,010 --> 02:48:07,890
Now you know.

4730
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:09,070
No, it's a different people.

4731
02:48:13,990 --> 02:48:14,590
What's this?

4732
02:48:16,270 --> 02:48:17,210
That's not germa.

4733
02:48:17,210 --> 02:48:18,490
That's not germa.

4734
02:48:19,090 --> 02:48:19,570
What?

4735
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:23,650
I will never know what germa-san look like.

4736
02:48:24,730 --> 02:48:25,830
Maybe it's this one.

4737
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:26,390
Over here.

4738
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:30,590
They say it's black though.

4739
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:32,450
Oh, yeah.

4740
02:48:32,490 --> 02:48:33,670
My chat told me that's black.

4741
02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:35,770
It's his brother?

4742
02:48:36,010 --> 02:48:37,010
Wait, really?

4743
02:48:37,530 --> 02:48:39,070
Oh, he has brother?

4744
02:48:39,510 --> 02:48:40,130
That's wonderful.

4745
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:42,330
That's right.

4746
02:48:42,910 --> 02:48:44,090
He's so popular.

4747
02:48:45,730 --> 02:48:46,330
Nice.

4748
02:48:46,330 --> 02:48:47,110
Germa-san.

4749
02:48:47,190 --> 02:48:49,190
People keep talking about Germa-san.

4750
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:51,330
One day I will see him.

4751
02:48:51,490 --> 02:48:51,930
One day.

4752
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:54,670
One day, one day.

4753
02:48:54,770 --> 02:48:55,750
He has brother?

4754
02:48:56,050 --> 02:48:56,610
That's cool.

4755
02:48:59,070 --> 02:49:00,830
His gingerbread is so cute.

4756
02:49:01,830 --> 02:49:02,430
Yeah.

4757
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:05,150
Oh, is this the room?

4758
02:49:05,290 --> 02:49:07,010
Who is this?

4759
02:49:07,090 --> 02:49:07,610
It's a dog.

4760
02:49:08,810 --> 02:49:10,230
I love her kitchen.

4761
02:49:10,370 --> 02:49:11,210
That looks so cute.

4762
02:49:11,510 --> 02:49:13,130
This place is kind of crazy.

4763
02:49:16,950 --> 02:49:18,170
It's kind of crazy.

4764
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:20,150
Crazy.

4765
02:49:21,050 --> 02:49:22,010
I like it.

4766
02:49:22,210 --> 02:49:22,670
I like it.

4767
02:49:32,020 --> 02:49:33,400
Are you okay?

4768
02:49:33,400 --> 02:49:33,800
What the heck?

4769
02:49:34,340 --> 02:49:34,780
Oh.

4770
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:40,200
Why do so many dogs live here?

4771
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:41,220
I think she's obsessed.

4772
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:43,440
I think so.

4773
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:46,120
Hi, boss.

4774
02:49:46,380 --> 02:49:46,940
See you.

4775
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:47,260
Hello.

4776
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:48,060
Hi, boss.

4777
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:49,740
Hi, boss.

4778
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:52,280
No, she keeps the fox in the cage.

4779
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:53,500
What is this?

4780
02:49:54,200 --> 02:49:54,900
A turtle?

4781
02:49:56,180 --> 02:49:56,940
I don't know.

4782
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:57,580
What is that?

4783
02:49:58,300 --> 02:49:59,060
What is that?

4784
02:49:59,100 --> 02:49:59,920
I don't think it's a turtle.

4785
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:00,760
A dinosaur?

4786
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:03,740
A little dinosaur?

4787
02:50:04,060 --> 02:50:05,140
Little baby dinosaur.

4788
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:08,740
A little baby dinosaur trapped in here, though.

4789
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:10,240
A little baby dinosaur trapped in here, though.

4790
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:10,660
So sad.

4791
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:11,340
That's abuse.

4792
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:14,100
I'm reporting her.

4793
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:16,300
Oh, and a smoking bird.

4794
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:17,420
Oh, and a smoking bird.

4795
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:19,360
Yeah, she gets a smoking bird.

4796
02:50:19,860 --> 02:50:20,500
Robin.

4797
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:21,760
It's not good for you.

4798
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:22,340
Don't smoke.

4799
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:24,500
That's why Robin is dying.

4800
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:25,640
Stop smoking.

4801
02:50:25,740 --> 02:50:27,260
Yeah, stop smoking.

4802
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:29,500
Stop dying smoking.

4803
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:31,600
Stop dying smoking.

4804
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:32,660
Smoking hot bird?

4805
02:50:33,020 --> 02:50:34,400
I don't know.

4806
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:36,500
I don't know about that.

4807
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:38,960
I don't know about that.

4808
02:50:40,990 --> 02:50:43,220
Stevie, hot kiddo in your area.

4809
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:44,000
Whoa.

4810
02:50:47,260 --> 02:50:47,880
Whoa.

4811
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:49,580
It's starting to lag a little bit.

4812
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:51,460
It's okay.

4813
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:54,980
This was so fun.

4814
02:50:54,980 --> 02:50:55,320
Yeah.

4815
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:58,340
I hope you enjoy it.

4816
02:50:58,360 --> 02:50:59,340
I hope you enjoy it.

4817
02:50:59,360 --> 02:51:02,280
There's a lot of places you can enjoy here.

4818
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:05,320
I really hope we can have fun together again soon.

4819
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:06,140
Yeah.

4820
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:08,980
I will have to find a place to make my home.

4821
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:10,500
Oh, yeah.

4822
02:51:10,660 --> 02:51:12,840
Do you have any places you want to make it?

4823
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:13,900
I don't know.

4824
02:51:13,980 --> 02:51:15,840
Maybe next to your house.

4825
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:17,640
Maybe under your house.

4826
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:18,840
Above your house.

4827
02:51:18,980 --> 02:51:20,040
In your house.

4828
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:21,760
You want to see what's under my house?

4829
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:22,560
Yeah.

4830
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:27,780
Okay.

4831
02:51:28,460 --> 02:51:30,460
I'm going to make you TP sword.

4832
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:31,200
Okay.

4833
02:51:33,220 --> 02:51:36,820
There she goes.

4834
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:40,320
I'm going to make a house inside her house.

4835
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:41,220
Under her house.

4836
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:42,160
Above her house.

4837
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:44,020
Let's accept.

4838
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:48,300
Welcome to my basement.

4839
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:49,320
Wow.

4840
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:50,320
It's huge.

4841
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:52,360
Yeah.

4842
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:56,280
I'm going to place a lot of chest down here.

4843
02:51:56,380 --> 02:51:58,340
So I can place everything I want.

4844
02:51:58,640 --> 02:51:59,280
Oh, yeah.

4845
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:00,200
You already started.

4846
02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:01,920
Yeah.

4847
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:02,520
I am.

4848
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:02,880
I am.

4849
02:52:03,140 --> 02:52:03,940
This is the inventory.

4850
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:05,700
This is the same thing Mousy had.

4851
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:08,240
It's the same one.

4852
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:10,220
I believe.

4853
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:11,400
I need to place more.

4854
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:13,120
Zen is coming here.

4855
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:14,240
Zen.

4856
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:17,900
Zen, what are you doing?

4857
02:52:19,980 --> 02:52:21,800
I tried to steal my stuff again.

4858
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:22,360
Oh.

4859
02:52:22,360 --> 02:52:22,720
Zen.

4860
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:26,280
We're so fast.

4861
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:27,060
She ran away.

4862
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:29,340
Did she steal my stuff?

4863
02:52:34,240 --> 02:52:34,820
Manga.

4864
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:37,820
What's this?

4865
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:42,920
But yeah.

4866
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,900
Once you have a chest down here.

4867
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:46,440
And you connect with those.

4868
02:52:46,640 --> 02:52:48,340
Like a cable.

4869
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:50,160
And this one.

4870
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:51,900
The connector in the terminal.

4871
02:52:52,340 --> 02:52:53,900
And you're ready to go.

4872
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:56,500
It's like moving.

4873
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:59,040
You have so many sticks.

4874
02:53:00,380 --> 02:53:01,260
I do.

4875
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:01,700
I do.

4876
02:53:04,060 --> 02:53:04,700
Wow.

4877
02:53:05,140 --> 02:53:05,600
Okay.

4878
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:06,880
I'm gonna learn from you.

4879
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:10,340
I'm gonna build a huge place.

4880
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:14,500
That's gonna have every inventory item ever.

4881
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:16,160
That's gonna have every inventory item ever.

4882
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:18,100
If you ever have a question about the Minecraft.

4883
02:53:18,480 --> 02:53:20,040
I'll help you as I can.

4884
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:21,240
Okay.

4885
02:53:21,540 --> 02:53:22,520
Thank you.

4886
02:53:22,520 --> 02:53:24,460
Of course.

4887
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:25,480
Of course.

4888
02:53:25,480 --> 02:53:27,840
I'm not gonna take anything.

4889
02:53:28,940 --> 02:53:30,260
Oh thank you.

4890
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:31,960
Because everybody who took my stuff.

4891
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:33,500
They ended up dead.

4892
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:34,300
Oh.

4893
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:37,380
By your hands or?

4894
02:53:39,480 --> 02:53:40,660
I don't know.

4895
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:41,600
It just happened.

4896
02:53:50,010 --> 02:53:51,350
I'm not gonna take anything.

4897
02:53:53,910 --> 02:53:55,530
I don't wanna end up dead.

4898
02:53:55,610 --> 02:53:56,150
By...

4899
02:53:57,830 --> 02:53:59,110
By Hanya killing me.

4900
02:53:59,190 --> 02:53:59,970
Who would want that?

4901
02:54:01,150 --> 02:54:01,590
Yeah.

4902
02:54:02,010 --> 02:54:03,610
You're not stealing anything, right?

4903
02:54:03,810 --> 02:54:04,110
No.

4904
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:04,290
No.

4905
02:54:04,350 --> 02:54:04,510
No.

4906
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:04,750
No.

4907
02:54:04,750 --> 02:54:06,590
I'm looking at all the things that...

4908
02:54:06,590 --> 02:54:08,390
That the game has to offer.

4909
02:54:08,610 --> 02:54:08,790
Yeah.

4910
02:54:08,930 --> 02:54:09,270
Yeah.

4911
02:54:09,370 --> 02:54:09,550
Yeah.

4912
02:54:12,110 --> 02:54:13,490
I'm not taking a single thing.

4913
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:16,910
Chat, is she stealing my stuff?

4914
02:54:17,070 --> 02:54:17,350
No.

4915
02:54:17,370 --> 02:54:17,630
No.

4916
02:54:17,690 --> 02:54:17,910
No.

4917
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:19,050
You were such a nice...

4918
02:54:19,050 --> 02:54:20,450
You were such a nice tour guide.

4919
02:54:20,530 --> 02:54:21,570
Why would I steal anything?

4920
02:54:22,670 --> 02:54:23,110
Yeah.

4921
02:54:23,110 --> 02:54:23,190
Yeah.

4922
02:54:25,970 --> 02:54:27,430
Stop touching me.

4923
02:54:42,340 --> 02:54:43,800
I'm on the way back here.

4924
02:54:44,060 --> 02:54:44,500
Oh my god.

4925
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:46,500
I forgot that I set my spawn point.

4926
02:54:50,740 --> 02:54:51,260
Spawn.

4927
02:54:51,780 --> 02:54:52,780
Is she at the entrance?

4928
02:54:53,140 --> 02:54:53,860
I'm here.

4929
02:54:54,760 --> 02:54:55,760
Welcome back.

4930
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:56,700
Welcome back, Dayo.

4931
02:54:56,860 --> 02:54:57,340
Thank you.

4932
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:00,380
Here.

4933
02:55:00,500 --> 02:55:01,080
I'll give you your energy.

4934
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:01,260
Take back.

4935
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:05,420
Thank you for the egg.

4936
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:06,400
Thank you for the egg.

4937
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:10,200
No happy birthday.

4938
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:11,200
None.

4939
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:13,680
No life.

4940
02:55:13,800 --> 02:55:15,240
I also have like a...

4941
02:55:15,240 --> 02:55:17,540
Well, I think a lot of people took it.

4942
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:20,640
So you can take an iron chest if you want to.

4943
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:22,480
Iron armor.

4944
02:55:22,820 --> 02:55:23,660
Oh, thank you.

4945
02:55:23,860 --> 02:55:24,740
I might take it.

4946
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:24,940
Yeah.

4947
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:27,440
But also Mousy gave me a lot of diamond.

4948
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:28,700
I think I'll make diamond armor.

4949
02:55:28,700 --> 02:55:30,320
Oh, that's true.

4950
02:55:30,440 --> 02:55:30,900
That's true.

4951
02:55:32,220 --> 02:55:33,660
I'll be more powerful.

4952
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:34,620
So yeah.

4953
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:34,620
There's a lot of places.

4954
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:37,900
There's a lot of places and a lot of people in here.

4955
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,080
I hope you'll enjoy it.

4956
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:39,680
Yeah.

4957
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:40,580
Thank you, Hanya.

4958
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:43,160
Thank you for giving me the tour today.

4959
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:45,060
Of course.

4960
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:46,020
Anytime.

4961
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:46,800
Anytime.

4962
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:47,640
Yeah.

4963
02:55:47,980 --> 02:55:50,560
I would love to play Minecraft with you more.

4964
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:52,120
Because always I wanted to.

4965
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:52,820
Yeah.

4966
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:54,140
Okay.

4967
02:55:54,360 --> 02:55:54,640
Yeah.

4968
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:56,660
I'll find a place to build.

4969
02:55:56,820 --> 02:55:57,260
And...

4970
02:55:58,280 --> 02:55:59,100
I'll play.

4971
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:01,060
Yes.

4972
02:56:01,060 --> 02:56:01,580
Yes.

4973
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:01,880
Yes.

4974
02:56:01,880 --> 02:56:02,100
Yes.

4975
02:56:02,100 --> 02:56:02,500
Yeah.

4976
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:04,860
Thank you.

4977
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:06,560
Anything you need, please let me know.

4978
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:07,160
Okay.

4979
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:08,720
For a price, right?

4980
02:56:10,180 --> 02:56:10,860
Oh, no.

4981
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:11,620
Not for me.

4982
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:12,460
Not for me.

4983
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:13,640
Really?

4984
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:15,100
Yeah.

4985
02:56:16,220 --> 02:56:18,100
I wish I could crouch right now.

4986
02:56:18,340 --> 02:56:18,560
Here.

4987
02:56:18,640 --> 02:56:19,040
I can do this.

4988
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:21,540
Hanya-sama.

4989
02:56:21,820 --> 02:56:22,600
Hanya-sama.

4990
02:56:23,140 --> 02:56:23,760
Oh, no.

4991
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:24,820
You're so kind.

4992
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:27,320
You're so kind.

4993
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:30,600
You're so genius.

4994
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:32,220
You're so beautiful.

4995
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:33,420
You're so kind.

4996
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:34,300
You're so wonderful.

4997
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:38,180
Well, if you ask me, I can give you anything.

4998
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:39,580
But if you steal, I'm going to...

4999
02:56:39,580 --> 02:56:40,340
Yeah.

5000
02:56:40,660 --> 02:56:41,140
Okay.

5001
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,380
I won't steal.

5002
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:43,920
Yeah.

5003
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:44,360
Yeah.

5004
02:56:44,500 --> 02:56:45,240
No steal.

5005
02:56:45,440 --> 02:56:46,120
No steal.

5006
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:47,940
No steal.

5007
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:49,280
No steal.

5008
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:51,360
When you do...

5009
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:52,820
When you do...

5010
02:56:55,620 --> 02:56:57,020
That sounds horrible.

5011
02:56:57,880 --> 02:56:58,000
That sounds horrible.

5012
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:58,900
Something will happen.

5013
02:56:59,300 --> 02:57:03,040
That sounds like... I don't wish that upon anybody.

5014
02:57:03,760 --> 02:57:04,140
That sounds like...

5015
02:57:04,140 --> 02:57:04,140
I don't wish that upon anybody.

5016
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:04,620
Yeah.

5017
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:06,540
Why would you steal?

5018
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:07,540
Just ask her.

5019
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:07,940
Yeah.

5020
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:08,240
Yeah.

5021
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:08,640
Yeah.

5022
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:09,280
Yeah.

5023
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:09,560
Of course.

5024
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:10,600
Yeah.

5025
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:14,380
Okay.

5026
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:17,060
I'm going to go talk to my chat now, Hanya.

5027
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:18,480
Okay.

5028
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:20,260
Thank you for hanging out with me.

5029
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:20,860
Okay.

5030
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:20,860
Thank you for hanging out with me.

5031
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:21,100
Thank you.

5032
02:57:24,100 --> 02:57:24,660
Okay.

5033
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:26,060
I'll see you later.

5034
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:28,360
I'll see you later, too.

5035
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:28,980
Bye-bye.

5036
02:57:33,780 --> 02:57:34,900
Bye-bye.

5037
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:36,040
Bye.

5038
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:39,300
Bye-bye.

5039
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,120
Bye-bye.

5040
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:44,460
Let

5041
02:57:49,770 --> 02:57:51,170
me...

5042
02:57:51,170 --> 02:57:52,970
I forgot to say bye to Mousy.

5043
02:57:53,370 --> 02:57:54,950
Let me go say bye to Mousy.

5044
02:57:57,110 --> 02:57:58,370
And then to...

5045
02:57:59,670 --> 02:58:00,530
One second.

5046
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:03,370
Oh.

5047
02:58:05,050 --> 02:58:06,090
Bye, Mousy.

5048
02:58:06,770 --> 02:58:07,550
Thank you.

5049
02:58:09,390 --> 02:58:10,430
Bye, Zen.

5050
02:58:13,510 --> 02:58:14,610
The mouse is...

5051
02:58:16,350 --> 02:58:16,870
Is...

5052
02:58:16,870 --> 02:58:18,430
Is AFK.

5053
02:58:18,490 --> 02:58:19,610
But maybe she'll see it.

5054
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:22,710
And we can steal stuff while riding.

5055
02:58:22,830 --> 02:58:23,230
Oh my gosh.

5056
02:58:23,350 --> 02:58:24,470
That sounds awesome.

5057
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:27,090
If I steal something, she'll ruin my life?

5058
02:58:27,370 --> 02:58:28,450
Oh yeah.

5059
02:58:28,810 --> 02:58:29,330
Baby.

5060
02:58:29,330 --> 02:58:29,470
Baby.

5061
02:58:32,290 --> 02:58:34,250
That sounds like the best thing ever.

5062
02:58:35,890 --> 02:58:36,630
That sounds like the best thing ever.

5063
02:58:36,630 --> 02:58:37,870
You got braver with your mask?

5064
02:58:38,030 --> 02:58:39,870
It's because she couldn't see my pervert smile.

5065
02:58:41,530 --> 02:58:42,090
It's because she couldn't see my pervert smile.

5066
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:45,670
Why does this fit on my head so well?

5067
02:58:48,410 --> 02:58:51,050
Why does this fit on my head actually so well?

5068
02:58:51,050 --> 02:58:51,710
So perfectly?

5069
02:58:53,270 --> 02:58:53,670
Oh.

5070
02:58:53,690 --> 02:58:54,990
Maybe not perfect-perfect.

5071
02:58:55,450 --> 02:58:58,010
But it feels like my head was made to wear panties.

5072
02:58:58,110 --> 02:58:58,210
But it feels like my head was made to wear panties.

5073
02:58:59,330 --> 02:58:59,890
There we go!

5074
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:02,810
There we go!

5075
02:59:03,010 --> 02:59:04,610
Oh, I just needed to make it a little bit smaller.

5076
02:59:06,790 --> 02:59:07,190
Perfect!

5077
02:59:10,910 --> 02:59:12,950
Your head is the size of Hena's butt.

5078
02:59:14,090 --> 02:59:15,870
Dang, she's got a big butt.

5079
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:28,500
So I guess I have to find a place to build a house in there.

5080
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:31,180
Oh gosh, there's so many... oh, wait, hold on, I'm a little...

5081
02:59:31,860 --> 02:59:33,100
It's a little wobbly.

5082
02:59:33,860 --> 02:59:35,320
There's so many people that joined the server.

5083
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:38,480
I've never met Ari before, Froggy before, but they were so nice.

5084
02:59:38,660 --> 02:59:41,580
And I'm nervous about meeting new people, but...

5085
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:43,900
I will do my best.

5086
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:46,960
To be social!

5087
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:51,040
I'll do my best!

5088
02:59:51,700 --> 02:59:53,540
I can't believe you're wearing Hena's panties.

5089
02:59:53,540 --> 02:59:55,440
She gave them to me for this purpose!

5090
02:59:56,300 --> 02:59:58,060
You can take that mask off now.

5091
02:59:58,100 --> 02:59:59,840
The rest of the team can't see you.

5092
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:01,460
What do you mean, the team?

5093
03:00:03,860 --> 03:00:05,640
It was hot in there.

5094
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:08,500
It was hot in there.

5095
03:00:10,840 --> 03:00:11,880
Thanks for the guide.

5096
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:12,540
Thank you!

5097
03:00:12,760 --> 03:00:14,520
Oh my gosh, I think also...

5098
03:00:15,860 --> 03:00:16,380
The...

5099
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:18,440
What's it called?

5100
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:19,040
All the mods?

5101
03:00:20,480 --> 03:00:22,860
There's so much to be able to...

5102
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:24,380
Ah, it's a pervert!

5103
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:29,220
There's so much to...

5104
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:30,920
There's so much to...

5105
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:31,660
Create.

5106
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:36,020
This shoujo server was amazing.

5107
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:37,680
Modern Minecraft is completely different.

5108
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:39,700
By the way, nice hentai common cosplay.

5109
03:00:39,980 --> 03:00:40,640
Thank you!

5110
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:43,280
Mint, what are your thoughts on dog-dog?

5111
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:45,840
Oh no, don't get me started about dog-dog.

5112
03:00:46,900 --> 03:00:47,620
Dog-dog.

5113
03:00:47,720 --> 03:00:49,560
Don't get me started about saying dog-dog.

5114
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:51,960
Because once I start saying dog-dog, I won't stop saying dog-dog.

5115
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:54,780
Over and over, I just gotta be compelled to say dog-dog.

5116
03:00:54,940 --> 03:00:58,460
If I start saying dog-dog, I can't stop saying dog-dog.

5117
03:00:58,540 --> 03:00:59,880
I just gotta keep saying dog-dog.

5118
03:01:01,560 --> 03:01:03,180
I still prefer vanilla Minecraft.

5119
03:01:03,180 --> 03:01:08,260
I think both have its good things, right?

5120
03:01:08,460 --> 03:01:16,740
Because I think the one thing, if I could turn it off about the v-shojo server, while it's convenient.

5121
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:21,520
But you know, dying and losing your stuff is part of the thrill, you know?

5122
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:24,800
So, it's part of the thrill.

5123
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:26,500
But...

5124
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:29,120
But...

5125
03:01:29,900 --> 03:01:30,780
You know...

5126
03:01:30,780 --> 03:01:32,480
If I...

5127
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:33,640
If I...

5128
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:36,660
I think for this, it seems very much more like...

5129
03:01:38,300 --> 03:01:38,780
Like...

5130
03:01:38,780 --> 03:01:39,680
What's the word?

5131
03:01:41,020 --> 03:01:41,980
Building stuff.

5132
03:01:42,120 --> 03:01:47,620
Because there's so many pretty mods to like customize your house and things like that.

5133
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:49,240
They kill each other a lot.

5134
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:50,920
That makes sense too then, you know?

5135
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:54,700
It's also what makes new players quit often.

5136
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:56,940
I guess if you join a server...

5137
03:01:58,180 --> 03:01:58,660
And...

5138
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:01,220
And people are always...

5139
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:02,460
There's a lot of PvP.

5140
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:03,420
Then, you know.

5141
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:07,040
There were so many graves.

5142
03:02:07,340 --> 03:02:08,020
I believe it.

5143
03:02:08,220 --> 03:02:09,140
But that was so fun.

5144
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:10,520
Oh, I turned off my music earlier.

5145
03:02:14,740 --> 03:02:16,160
That was so fun.

5146
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:18,260
I hope you guys enjoyed the tour as well.

5147
03:02:18,380 --> 03:02:20,300
HENYA was so awesome for...

5148
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:22,360
For giving us such a nice tour.

5149
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:23,360
And...

5150
03:02:23,360 --> 03:02:26,280
I hope you guys liked it.

5151
03:02:29,240 --> 03:02:30,940
There's a raid, but I can't read it.

5152
03:02:30,980 --> 03:02:31,380
Oh my god.

5153
03:02:31,380 --> 03:02:32,560
I can't...

5154
03:02:33,240 --> 03:02:34,460
Oh my gosh, I can't read it.

5155
03:02:34,700 --> 03:02:36,340
I can't read it.

5156
03:02:36,680 --> 03:02:38,220
I'm so sorry, but thank you for the raid.

5157
03:02:43,940 --> 03:02:45,420
Not to mention booby traps.

5158
03:02:46,100 --> 03:02:46,580
Yeah.

5159
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:49,940
The white on white is so bad.

5160
03:02:50,080 --> 03:02:50,760
It is.

5161
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:52,940
Salve.

5162
03:02:53,580 --> 03:02:54,060
Salve.

5163
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:54,620
Thank you.

5164
03:02:54,740 --> 03:02:55,780
Thank you so much.

5165
03:02:58,680 --> 03:03:01,100
YouTube turned pinned messages white as...

5166
03:03:01,100 --> 03:03:01,360
No.

5167
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:01,660
No way.

5168
03:03:09,500 --> 03:03:10,900
What's my secret?

5169
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:11,560
Oh wait.

5170
03:03:13,180 --> 03:03:15,000
You didn't tell me that.

5171
03:03:15,140 --> 03:03:16,840
The text was...

5172
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:17,900
Was black.

5173
03:03:30,580 --> 03:03:32,260
The text

5174
03:03:35,840 --> 03:03:36,840
was black.

5175
03:03:41,630 --> 03:03:44,070
Oh my god, you guys.

5176
03:03:44,190 --> 03:03:45,230
Making me look like a...

5177
03:03:45,590 --> 03:03:46,570
Damn clown.

5178
03:03:47,490 --> 03:03:48,730
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

5179
03:03:50,310 --> 03:03:52,430
Issues that Zen is in the server, so there's that.

5180
03:03:53,010 --> 03:03:56,650
I think the prison thing, that was really cool.

5181
03:03:56,990 --> 03:03:57,810
I liked that.

5182
03:03:57,910 --> 03:03:59,330
Tego, thanks for a month.

5183
03:04:00,010 --> 03:04:01,090
Thank you so much.

5184
03:04:03,050 --> 03:04:07,930
Sorry I couldn't read people's super chats and stuff while they were happening, but thank you very much, everybody.

5185
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:09,290
Thanks for all the gifted.

5186
03:04:09,670 --> 03:04:11,350
Thank you for watching.

5187
03:04:11,650 --> 03:04:12,450
Thank you for donating.

5188
03:04:12,570 --> 03:04:14,790
Thank you for super chatting.

5189
03:04:15,030 --> 03:04:15,570
Thank you.

5190
03:04:15,570 --> 03:04:15,810
Thank you.

5191
03:04:15,830 --> 03:04:16,110
Thank you.

5192
03:04:16,690 --> 03:04:18,150
Can anyone read it though?

5193
03:04:18,270 --> 03:04:19,290
It'd be cool to know.

5194
03:04:21,870 --> 03:04:23,510
Exploring dungeons with friends is always fun.

5195
03:04:23,590 --> 03:04:25,130
I think also the...

5196
03:04:27,550 --> 03:04:29,390
The gacha with the...

5197
03:04:29,390 --> 03:04:30,470
I mean, I guess...

5198
03:04:31,130 --> 03:04:32,530
Chests are always gacha.

5199
03:04:32,630 --> 03:04:34,150
But I also really like that...

5200
03:04:35,410 --> 03:04:38,410
That each one can be taken...

5201
03:04:38,410 --> 03:04:38,830
Like...

5202
03:04:39,470 --> 03:04:42,590
Each person has a different stuff in the special chest.

5203
03:04:42,730 --> 03:04:43,330
It's so cool.

5204
03:04:43,950 --> 03:04:44,970
Wait, a month already?

5205
03:04:44,970 --> 03:04:46,430
Hell yeah!

5206
03:04:46,670 --> 03:04:47,790
Doc, thank you!

5207
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:56,510
The prisoner area was a mod that's based on dead cells.

5208
03:04:56,730 --> 03:04:57,870
Along with the weapons as well.

5209
03:04:57,990 --> 03:04:59,090
Okay, that's what...

5210
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:02,190
Yeah, yeah, that's what Henya was saying earlier too, right?

5211
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:04,170
Oh my gosh, I...

5212
03:05:04,170 --> 03:05:06,190
I'm so happy that I got...

5213
03:05:06,990 --> 03:05:09,130
Henya and Maus to help me go around.

5214
03:05:09,210 --> 03:05:10,110
And Maus was giving...

5215
03:05:10,110 --> 03:05:11,330
Oh my gosh, the Dejiko hat!

5216
03:05:11,750 --> 03:05:13,530
When I saw her wearing it, I was like...

5217
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:15,090
That looks so much like a Dejiko hat.

5218
03:05:15,190 --> 03:05:16,290
But maybe it's just a cat hat.

5219
03:05:16,570 --> 03:05:17,090
But...

5220
03:05:17,090 --> 03:05:19,030
It was a Dejiko hat.

5221
03:05:19,710 --> 03:05:20,590
It was so cute.

5222
03:05:21,350 --> 03:05:21,870
And...

5223
03:05:21,870 --> 03:05:24,070
And then Henya getting the Puchiko hat.

5224
03:05:25,230 --> 03:05:26,030
And this...

5225
03:05:26,030 --> 03:05:27,210
Yeah, her cinnamon rolls!

5226
03:05:27,270 --> 03:05:28,050
So sweet!

5227
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:31,450
Mausie helping out was so awesome.

5228
03:05:31,630 --> 03:05:32,490
Oh, let me...

5229
03:05:33,430 --> 03:05:35,430
Thank you both so much.

5230
03:05:36,870 --> 03:05:38,870
And Ahri coming with us.

5231
03:05:38,910 --> 03:05:39,450
It was so fun.

5232
03:05:41,930 --> 03:05:44,150
The real question is...

5233
03:05:44,150 --> 03:05:45,670
Why do they all have dungeons in their basements?

5234
03:05:47,370 --> 03:05:48,410
That's just, you know...

5235
03:05:49,310 --> 03:05:49,750
Standard...

5236
03:05:50,870 --> 03:05:52,870
V-Shojo protocol, you know?

5237
03:05:56,670 --> 03:05:57,810
What was I gonna say?

5238
03:05:59,190 --> 03:05:59,990
Fab, I see this!

5239
03:06:00,070 --> 03:06:00,610
Thanks for a month!

5240
03:06:01,950 --> 03:06:02,950
I have to...

5241
03:06:02,950 --> 03:06:04,550
I have to figure out what I'm...

5242
03:06:04,550 --> 03:06:06,330
What I want my house to be like.

5243
03:06:06,550 --> 03:06:07,310
I think...

5244
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:08,430
The most...

5245
03:06:08,430 --> 03:06:10,650
The most intimidating thing is like...

5246
03:06:10,650 --> 03:06:12,410
With all the mods, I'm like...

5247
03:06:12,410 --> 03:06:12,950
You know...

5248
03:06:12,950 --> 03:06:15,590
I'm not used to having so many more...

5249
03:06:16,770 --> 03:06:18,450
More options for building.

5250
03:06:18,630 --> 03:06:19,090
So...

5251
03:06:19,090 --> 03:06:20,490
I have to get used to it.

5252
03:06:20,790 --> 03:06:21,450
I think.

5253
03:06:23,470 --> 03:06:26,050
So we're glad to see you going around the V-Shojo server.

5254
03:06:26,170 --> 03:06:27,050
Can't wait to see you.

5255
03:06:27,090 --> 03:06:28,990
Meet more new people and have fun on there.

5256
03:06:29,310 --> 03:06:30,150
Thank you!

5257
03:06:31,130 --> 03:06:32,390
Make a maid cafe house?

5258
03:06:32,510 --> 03:06:33,250
I was thinking that.

5259
03:06:33,910 --> 03:06:34,990
I was thinking that.

5260
03:06:35,290 --> 03:06:37,050
Yeah, there's like a million different blocks.

5261
03:06:39,890 --> 03:06:41,470
The world is our oyster.

5262
03:06:42,390 --> 03:06:43,390
Haunted maid cafe?

5263
03:06:43,630 --> 03:06:45,790
Why do you think I was collecting corpses, huh?

5264
03:06:47,730 --> 03:06:49,890
Why do you think I was collecting corpses?

5265
03:06:51,630 --> 03:06:54,150
I wonder if there are ghosts in the mod though.

5266
03:06:54,810 --> 03:06:56,030
Like little wisps?

5267
03:06:57,850 --> 03:06:59,430
I wonder if there's wisps.

5268
03:07:01,050 --> 03:07:03,090
Make Shadow Moses Island.

5269
03:07:04,470 --> 03:07:05,510
You know...

5270
03:07:06,470 --> 03:07:07,650
First of all...

5271
03:07:08,810 --> 03:07:13,850
Tenya making a Raiden reference was not on my bingo list for tonight.

5272
03:07:15,350 --> 03:07:16,550
But also...

5273
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:18,970
With the...

5274
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:23,510
With the extra blocks and everything, it might even be possible to make...

5275
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:24,670
To make wrecks.

5276
03:07:27,050 --> 03:07:29,170
Yeah, there's even RGB blocks.

5277
03:07:30,210 --> 03:07:34,530
Pretty sure even one of the builder mods adds over 4000 new blocks.

5278
03:07:40,540 --> 03:07:41,840
Net cafe wrecks?

5279
03:07:44,060 --> 03:07:46,500
I'm gonna have to figure out what to build.

5280
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:48,460
And I want to explore.

5281
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:50,240
I feel like maybe...

5282
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:52,320
A lot of the server has been explored already.

5283
03:07:52,640 --> 03:07:53,880
But that's okay too.

5284
03:07:54,560 --> 03:07:57,100
With create, you can make a function wrecks I bet.

5285
03:07:57,180 --> 03:07:57,580
Oh my god.

5286
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,120
That would be...

5287
03:07:58,120 --> 03:07:59,960
That would be so insane.

5288
03:07:59,960 --> 03:08:00,100
That's insane.

5289
03:08:10,460 --> 03:08:11,640
There's still a lot to see?

5290
03:08:13,800 --> 03:08:14,540
I'm excited.

5291
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:20,820
Minto is streaming this late?

5292
03:08:21,140 --> 03:08:22,520
Yeah, it is pretty late, huh?

5293
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:24,460
And I streamed late last night too.

5294
03:08:24,980 --> 03:08:26,860
But we're just finishing up and I'm...

5295
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:29,120
I'm actually getting...

5296
03:08:29,960 --> 03:08:34,140
I think I have all my social energy...

5297
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:37,040
All my social energy is...

5298
03:08:37,040 --> 03:08:38,760
It just disappeared.

5299
03:08:39,140 --> 03:08:41,440
And when social energy disappears...

5300
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:43,060
My energy disappears.

5301
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:45,640
I also become just a tiny wisp.

5302
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:47,100
It's hard to keep this form.

5303
03:08:47,840 --> 03:08:50,200
It's hard to keep this form when I...

5304
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:52,520
When I become so sleepy.

5305
03:08:55,180 --> 03:08:55,940
But...

5306
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,660
The VSHojo girls are always in contact with Tofu.

5307
03:09:00,820 --> 03:09:02,580
So if you want something added, you can ask.

5308
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:03,060
Oh, yes!

5309
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:08,940
The way I got added to the server was I joined some Discord.

5310
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:14,740
Actually, I was having technical issues with Minecraft just this morning.

5311
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:16,840
Or last night when I was trying to get in.

5312
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:18,980
So I also was like...

5313
03:09:18,980 --> 03:09:19,320
Tofu!

5314
03:09:20,140 --> 03:09:21,100
Help meee!

5315
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:25,820
I don't know Tofu, but they were very nice.

5316
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:32,820
Not even Mouse has explored the whole server yet?

5317
03:09:33,220 --> 03:09:33,740
Okay!

5318
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:36,060
Leave it to me!

5319
03:09:37,880 --> 03:09:39,680
We'll go on a grand adventure!

5320
03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:45,660
We'll go on a grand adventure in the server.

5321
03:09:46,940 --> 03:09:48,420
The server seems so friendly.

5322
03:09:51,100 --> 03:09:53,200
Have you heard that the Metal Gear Solid board game drops this month?

5323
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:56,000
If we get it, I wonder if we'll get a hand cam playthrough with Matara.

5324
03:09:56,560 --> 03:09:57,480
That's a great idea!

5325
03:09:57,660 --> 03:09:58,660
I pre-ordered it!

5326
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:02,440
I pre-ordered it when they first announced it, so...

5327
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,340
We can see if that can be arranged.

5328
03:10:12,100 --> 03:10:13,220
Yeah, thanks for the idea.

5329
03:10:20,910 --> 03:10:21,330
Okay.

5330
03:10:21,330 --> 03:10:23,390
Does it have spoilers?

5331
03:10:24,250 --> 03:10:25,170
No, it's only...

5332
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:27,650
It's only Metal Gear Solid 1.

5333
03:10:28,870 --> 03:10:29,530
I believe.

5334
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:31,130
Oh, let me exit out of Minecraft.

5335
03:10:31,390 --> 03:10:31,770
I think it's...

5336
03:10:33,450 --> 03:10:33,890
Goodbye.

5337
03:10:35,230 --> 03:10:36,490
Hold on, let me...

5338
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:42,950
One second...

5339
03:10:42,950 --> 03:10:44,550
We'll go to the maid cafe.

5340
03:10:46,510 --> 03:10:48,190
I'm lagging a little bit though.

5341
03:10:52,210 --> 03:10:54,470
Recently, my computer has been acting so funky.

5342
03:10:55,530 --> 03:10:55,930
Like...

5343
03:10:58,730 --> 03:10:59,130
Wait,

5344
03:11:03,860 --> 03:11:04,500
where are you guys?

5345
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:06,280
What?

5346
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:08,000
Where did you guys go?

5347
03:11:13,440 --> 03:11:14,240
We're dead!

5348
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:16,760
There's nothing on the menu.

5349
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:26,840
I missed the last bit of Ghost Trick, but wanted to mention after I finished it, I was so floored I had to immediately drop everything and go buy a Sizzle plushie from Etsy.

5350
03:11:27,560 --> 03:11:29,160
Thanks again for introducing the game.

5351
03:11:29,240 --> 03:11:29,600
Of course!

5352
03:11:30,440 --> 03:11:32,380
Glad you liked it as much as I did.

5353
03:11:33,880 --> 03:11:34,680
One second...

5354
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:41,160
Okay, there you are looking bulky.

5355
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:43,120
There we go.

5356
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:45,000
It's dark.

5357
03:11:49,480 --> 03:11:51,860
I missed most of the stream, but are you excited to build?

5358
03:11:51,940 --> 03:11:52,460
I am!

5359
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:53,860
I am, I am.

5360
03:11:54,800 --> 03:11:56,040
There was something I was going to say.

5361
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:56,200
Oh!

5362
03:11:57,740 --> 03:11:59,060
Oh my god.

5363
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:01,720
My um...

5364
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:04,840
Recently, I was like trying to search for something on my computer.

5365
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:09,080
Like you know how like when you go to the start menu and you search for something?

5366
03:12:09,360 --> 03:12:12,220
But like I would go to search and it would just like...

5367
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:13,880
Stop.

5368
03:12:14,300 --> 03:12:15,160
It would like...

5369
03:12:15,160 --> 03:12:16,680
The menu would disappear.

5370
03:12:16,880 --> 03:12:17,480
It was so weird.

5371
03:12:19,100 --> 03:12:22,440
I've been having some weird issues with my computer lately.

5372
03:12:22,760 --> 03:12:23,240
Hopefully...

5373
03:12:23,240 --> 03:12:24,440
Hopefully it's okay.

5374
03:12:28,200 --> 03:12:28,720
Hm...

5375
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:29,900
Mine stream...

5376
03:12:29,900 --> 03:12:30,840
Mine stream?

5377
03:12:31,060 --> 03:12:33,120
Minecraft stream...

5378
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:34,600
Are back!

5379
03:12:36,420 --> 03:12:37,460
Maybe...

5380
03:12:37,460 --> 03:12:38,820
I don't wanna...

5381
03:12:39,300 --> 03:12:41,280
I don't want to, um...

5382
03:12:41,280 --> 03:12:44,700
I still am trying to think about a way to do...

5383
03:12:44,700 --> 03:12:46,160
A...

5384
03:12:46,160 --> 03:12:48,980
A Memble.

5385
03:12:50,780 --> 03:12:53,880
But I also realized...

5386
03:12:54,500 --> 03:12:55,300
Um...

5387
03:12:56,140 --> 03:13:07,160
I guess this sounds kind of mean, but if someone stops being a membu, if they still had access to the server, to the Minecraft server, it wouldn't be very fair.

5388
03:13:07,740 --> 03:13:12,760
So I'm still trying to figure out how exactly to do it.

5389
03:13:16,260 --> 03:13:23,560
But I also still want... not a modern Minecraft, like a vanilla one too, maybe.

5390
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:26,440
Give us the fushoujo server keys.

5391
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:27,740
Oh yeah, totally.

5392
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:32,740
Make it hardcore for giggles.

5393
03:13:36,800 --> 03:13:38,520
Change the password every month.

5394
03:13:42,480 --> 03:13:44,220
I guess that's a good idea.

5395
03:13:44,940 --> 03:13:46,680
You can change the password every month.

5396
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:48,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5397
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:58,840
Okay, that's a smart idea, you guys.

5398
03:13:59,080 --> 03:13:59,480
See?

5399
03:13:59,640 --> 03:14:01,300
I'm glad I brought it up with you guys.

5400
03:14:04,340 --> 03:14:05,940
I'm glad I brought it up with you guys.

5401
03:14:19,050 --> 03:14:20,590
Michi just DMed me.

5402
03:14:21,070 --> 03:14:23,170
She said, Mint, you're in the Minecraft server now.

5403
03:14:27,290 --> 03:14:27,830
But yeah.

5404
03:14:30,750 --> 03:14:32,510
It's the username whitelist feature.

5405
03:14:32,630 --> 03:14:33,290
Much safer.

5406
03:14:35,050 --> 03:14:35,530
Maybe.

5407
03:14:35,790 --> 03:14:36,330
I don't know.

5408
03:14:36,470 --> 03:14:38,090
There's lots of... there's some ways we can do it.

5409
03:14:38,210 --> 03:14:40,750
I just have to... get around to doing it.

5410
03:14:42,770 --> 03:14:47,090
Since you love ghost trick, can I recommend a PS2 game called Shadow of Destiny?

5411
03:14:48,590 --> 03:14:49,550
You... you...

5412
03:14:50,810 --> 03:14:56,290
You... you... you... you play as a guy who uses time travel to stop his own murder.

5413
03:14:57,410 --> 03:15:01,490
That sounds so familiar to what we just played.

5414
03:15:02,270 --> 03:15:02,750
That sounds so familiar to what we just played.

5415
03:15:03,150 --> 03:15:04,010
Let's play together.

5416
03:15:05,510 --> 03:15:05,990
Yeah!

5417
03:15:11,540 --> 03:15:13,100
Can't wait to play Minecraft though.

5418
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:16,720
I can't wait to play Minecraft with people though.

5419
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:19,820
The server seems so active.

5420
03:15:19,960 --> 03:15:20,700
I'm so happy.

5421
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:23,620
