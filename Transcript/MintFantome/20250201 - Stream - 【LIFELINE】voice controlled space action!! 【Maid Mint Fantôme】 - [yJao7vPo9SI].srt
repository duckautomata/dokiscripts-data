1
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,610
Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,430
Hello, everybody!

3
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,830
Hello, hello, hello!

4
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,830
Hi!

5
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,290
Hello, hello, hello!

6
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,950
Welcome...

7
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,770
I need to enunciate more.

8
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,910
I need to enunciate.

9
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,910
Welcome to...

10
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,550
Lifeline!

11
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,490
Hi, Minto.

12
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,930
Hello!

13
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,450
Nostalgic?

14
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,210
This game?

15
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,230
I haven't played this before.

16
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,310
This is my first time.

17
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:19,750
Good morning.

18
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,450
Good morning!

19
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,690
Enunciated Minky.

20
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,270
This game will make you question your life choices.

21
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,910
Or my afterlife choices.

22
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,270
I've never played this game before, but if you don't know what this is...

23
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,870
As it says, it is a voice action adventure.

24
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,550
I will be speaking.

25
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,630
I'll be saying blah, blah, blah.

26
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,470
And the game should listen to me.

27
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,450
TGIF Minto!

28
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,530
TGIF!

29
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:52,610
TGIF.

30
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,490
Hold on, I have something stuck in my throat.

31
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,210
I just had a chicken nugget.

32
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,510
I should have... That is suboptimal conditions to speak.

33
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,910
We can watch the little intro that it does.

34
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,510
Even though I have... Yeah, should.

35
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,590
Should is the key word here, right?

36
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,470
It should.

37
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,570
It should listen to what I have to say.

38
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,150
So, I had this on my schedule like, what, two weeks ago or something?

39
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,330
And then I lost my voice.

40
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,730
So...

41
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,310
Space.

42
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,250
I don't know anything about this game.

43
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,310
I'm gonna die if you don't think of something quick!

44
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,270
She's gonna die if I don't think of something quick!

45
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,230
I cannot talk.

46
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,070
Number two!

47
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,530
Number one!

48
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,030
I'm... I'm practicing.

49
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,550
I need to confess something.

50
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,970
When I was a child, I swore on Club Penguin.

51
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,610
I think everybody swore on Club Penguin.

52
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,130
It's okay.

53
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,670
Wait, I have to yell reload?

54
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,610
Oh gosh.

55
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,050
Wait.

56
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,930
Dodge right?

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,920
Oh gosh.

58
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,080
Dodge right!

59
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,740
Reload!

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,140
Oh no.

61
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,340
Not sure if you're joining us for the war in four hours.

62
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,780
Oh, the general sales?

63
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,250
Actually, I got a ticket from a friend, so...

64
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,900
Good luck everybody else!

65
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,860
Yeah, good luck!

66
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,200
For the HoloExpo tickets, right?

67
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,220
It's my birthday six minutes ago!

68
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,720
Can I maybe get an MGS themed happy birthday?

69
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,500
Of course!

70
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,580
Happy birthday!

71
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,560
Congratulations!

72
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,760
Happy birthday!

73
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,500
With salutations!

74
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,860
Happy birthday!

75
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,140
May your scars stay blue!

76
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,480
Happy birthday to you!

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,700
Happy birthday!

78
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,690
I think you meant it means a lot.

79
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,510
Of course!

80
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,130
It drives me up the freaking wall that you guys donate though to give me this thing happy birthday.

81
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,010
Because it's your birthday.

82
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,490
It doesn't feel very fair.

83
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,290
Sorry though.

84
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,670
The video keeps trying to replay.

85
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,470
Give him a one and a two, Minto!

86
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,990
Yeah, I'll give him the one, two.

87
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,530
One and two.

88
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:26,870
Respectively.

89
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,650
Maybe two and one sometimes.

90
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,710
We might get a little funky.

91
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,730
Let's play a new game.

92
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,230
New game.

93
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,810
One of the games of all time.

94
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,750
I've been out of my mind excited for this.

95
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,850
Ever since you put on your schedule a few weeks back.

96
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,030
You're going to love Rio.

97
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,050
Square?

98
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,970
Press square button?

99
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,450
That's interesting.

100
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,450
Also, I didn't want to start the game.

101
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,550
So I haven't tested this.

102
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,030
Quite honestly, but I have a contingency plan in case it's like...

103
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,470
In case it's like, oh no, can't work.

104
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,550
Okay, so...

105
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,010
I'm speaking normally.

106
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,470
I'm speaking normally.

107
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:44,870
Wait, explanation for using the analog controller during the tutorial is provided in the initial setting.

108
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,030
Okay.

109
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,030
Hi.

110
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,790
Da.

111
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,630
Circle?

112
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,690
It's not doing anything.

113
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,990
Oh.

114
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,210
Hello.

115
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,250
Hello.

116
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,170
Not yet.

117
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,630
Okay.

118
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,150
Okay.

119
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,690
Okay.

120
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:22,850
Oh.

121
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,010
Hello.

122
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,030
Hello.

123
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,150
Hello.

124
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,710
Hello.

125
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,570
Hello.

126
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,250
I see that it's...Oh!

127
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,170
It works!

128
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,310
It works!

129
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,490
I just had to let go.

130
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,370
PlayStation.

131
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,650
Yeah!

132
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,990
Lifeline TM.

133
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,090
Okay.

134
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,850
Okay.

135
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,390
Great!

136
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,550
Why was hello excellent?

137
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,150
My score.

138
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,730
Aki!

139
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,490
Thank you for the 10 Ginten!

140
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,230
Thank you!

141
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,130
Alright.

142
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,170
I'm gonna order her around.

143
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,090
Oh, I cannot talk again.

144
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,770
Get on all floors.

145
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,620
I feel like I just got sprayed with a spray bottle.

146
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,400
Bad.

147
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,210
Walk.

148
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,730
Excellent.

149
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:58,810
Oh yeah.

150
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,250
RUN!

151
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,850
RUN!

152
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,950
RUN!

153
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,630
Okay, but this is like...If I'm telling her to run, it's imperative.

154
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,770
I mean, is it not?

155
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,950
Would it not be in a severe situation?

156
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,190
I believe.

157
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,310
Kevin, welcome to Mambo Ship!

158
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,210
Somebody's gonna clip that.

159
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,290
I've already...I've lost every amount of dignity.

160
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,630
It doesn't matter where anybody is clipped now.

161
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,110
Run.

162
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,690
Run.

163
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,530
Stop!

164
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,030
What?

165
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,510
Stop!

166
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,990
Why?

167
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,170
Stop!

168
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,950
No!

169
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,550
What?

170
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,890
Stop!

171
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,570
Okay.

172
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,930
Great pronunciation.

173
00:11:59,290 --> 00:11:59,670
Nice voice.

174
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,590
Okay.

175
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,390
Go to the table.

176
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,530
Great.

177
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,650
Let's check it out.

178
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,860
Great.

179
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,640
So like, if I say...

180
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Go to the...

181
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,120
The bottle.

182
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,060
Go to the bottle.

183
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,580
In this case, saying green bottle is better for recognition than saying bottle.

184
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,620
Wow.

185
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,500
Bad.

186
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,740
Disarray.

187
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,500
Welcome to Mambo Ship.

188
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,120
Thank you.

189
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,880
Go to the phallic shape.

190
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,340
What if I say something like that?

191
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,600
What if I don't even know what it is?

192
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,020
Once the name is revealed, you can give more specific instructions.

193
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,940
Alright.

194
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,840
Check the wine.

195
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,860
Oh, she's checking it out.

196
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,700
Bad.

197
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,820
Seems like nothing is unusual about the wine.

198
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,780
When you find anything remotely curious, it's best to check the item carefully.

199
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,800
Additionally, certain objects can be combined with various verbs when you give instructions.

200
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,220
Drink the wine!

201
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,060
Get the wine!

202
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,860
Congratulations on your new...

203
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,280
Bad.

204
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,340
Okay.

205
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,660
Go back.

206
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,940
Nice.

207
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm pro at this.

208
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,160
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

209
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,680
When giving vocal commands, the best technique is to combine nouns and verbs.

210
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,940
Let's remember some battle commands.

211
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,500
Next, when the enemy is detected, we will automatically move to defeat it.

212
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,460
Carefully observe the enemy while giving commands.

213
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,220
Let's try making an actual attack.

214
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,520
Excellent!

215
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,340
Move left!

216
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,700
Shoot!

217
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,840
Dodge!

218
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,600
Good!

219
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,200
Sir Noodles, welcome to Mambo Ship!

220
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,720
Dodge and shoot!

221
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,980
Oh my god.

222
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,120
What is that?

223
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,500
Flee and recover!

224
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,880
Flee!

225
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,080
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

226
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,200
When multiple enemies appear, targeting can be prioritized with number 1, number 2, etc.

227
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,240
Number 2!

228
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,660
Number 1.

229
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,620
What!?

230
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,980
Oh my gosh.

231
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,580
This is literally saying that I'm good at English.

232
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,320
Viewers are commenting on the Scottish accent.

233
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm trying to say words in her accent.

234
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,680
Should I have an accent for this whole stream?

235
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,200
The relevant portion of the enemy appears at the bottom of the screen.

236
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
What do you mean by the relevant proportion?

237
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,580
I don't think this thing has...

238
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,040
I think it's just a blob.

239
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,940
It doesn't have any of those features.

240
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,760
I think.

241
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,320
Head, shoot, reload!

242
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,260
Good!

243
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,580
Oh my goodness, okay.

244
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Stomach!

245
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,780
Stomach What?

246
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:41,220
Stomach Okay Bad Okay

247
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,900
Okay, okay, okay

248
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,780
I used to be an English teacher.

249
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,460
This is perfect!

250
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,440
Yeah!

251
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,820
Yeah!

252
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,700
Now we begin our tale.

253
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,370
Really?

254
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,710
Yeah, I was an English teacher for Japanese students.

255
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:30,810
In 16th century Europe, there lived a physician by the name of Perikelsis.

256
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:44,950
Not only was he one of the era's finest medical minds, he also made contributions in alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and mysticism.

257
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,470
Probably.

258
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,530
Probably.

259
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,270
When he was in his thirties, he was said to have incredible healing abilities.

260
00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:02,610
That prompted him to adopt the name of Perikelsis, superseding Kelsis, the famed doctor of ancient times.

261
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,890
What is this lore?

262
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:14,330
In his later years, he is said to have gone on a journey of healing, visiting the terminally ill, and curing them with miraculous powers.

263
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,050
Okay, what else would he do after curing them?

264
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,030
Just stay there?

265
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,180
Konami Welcome to membership.

266
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,700
Thank you!

267
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,300
Lifeline Nice

268
00:18:47,850 --> 00:19:00,940
Earth Space December 24th, 2029?

269
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,620
No way, that's in just a couple years!

270
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Oh my gosh, we'll be able to speak in just four years!

271
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,260
Oh my gosh.

272
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,080
Got off work just in time.

273
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,840
Let's go!

274
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,480
Wait, crash out.

275
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,780
What's up?

276
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,450
Space Today I learned... Oh no!

277
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,310
That doesn't seem too good.

278
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,650
I don't think in 2029 we can breathe in space.

279
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,130
Minto playing peek.

280
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,230
Thank you!

281
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,950
I learned that... You know the wild thornberries?

282
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,650
I did not know that the dad was Tim Curry.

283
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,350
I had no idea.

284
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,930
I learned that today.

285
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,870
Uh-oh

286
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,570
Smashing.

287
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,510
Is this the monitor room?

288
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah.

289
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,490
Yeah.

290
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,290
The station has been critically damaged.

291
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,430
Manual operation limited.

292
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,690
Monitor room has been locked down.

293
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,350
Operators in room should await rescue.

294
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,470
Show me your kittens.

295
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,730
Thanks for the gift!

296
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,250
A wound!

297
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,970
Oh my gosh Surveillance camera recording concluded.

298
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,950
Now we are playing recording from the restaurant.

299
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,790
Fancy.

300
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,670
Say words that rhyme with heal.

301
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,830
Thanks for the hint!

302
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,830
This is the opening party.

303
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,910
A little while ago.

304
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,430
Thanks for the birthday party.

305
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,630
Shut up Murphy.

306
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,310
Oh my gosh.

307
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,190
That's me and Naomi.

308
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,790
Where is this Metal Gear?

309
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,450
We were lucky to be invited to the space station hotel.

310
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,850
No thank you.

311
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,590
Naomi.

312
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,890
Sorry.

313
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,410
She looks like Tifa.

314
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,430
Kind of.

315
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,910
This is so fancy.

316
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,830
Wow.

317
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,270
They are playing the jazz.

318
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,490
That's not how you hold a microphone maybe.

319
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,410
I think.

320
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,070
The whole room shook violently and something crashed the party.

321
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,750
It was me.

322
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,340
They started eating guests.

323
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,910
I'm a bit of a party crasher.

324
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,230
We ran away.

325
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,330
Naomi!

326
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,650
No, that is not a solid snake.

327
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,950
If we just play this whole game as if we are a snake, that would be so funny.

328
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,970
And then, I passed out.

329
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,910
I can't believe we are spending Christmas in space.

330
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,610
Thank you.

331
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,330
I can't believe we are spending Christmas separated from my beloved girlfriend.

332
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,350
Oh my gosh.

333
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,370
We were probably going to propose, weren't we?

334
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,750
No.

335
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,830
I can't believe we are spending Christmas in space.

336
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,070
I have a question though.

337
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,190
Is there actually no subtitles in this game?

338
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,710
There is a call from the security room.

339
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,290
Communication link will be open.

340
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,470
None?

341
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:31,850
OK.

342
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,350
I'll just keep the volume a little bit higher than usual.

343
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,830
Come in, please.

344
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:40,370
Hello.

345
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,170
Oh, I cannot talk.

346
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:44,610
Sorry.

347
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,290
Finally, my efforts pay off.

348
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,830
Scrapdog and the membership!

349
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,850
Is the comm link still live?

350
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,170
Operator, can you say something?

351
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,390
Hey girl!

352
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,190
What's with the casual attitude?

353
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,350
You don't sound like the regular guy.

354
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,970
Anyway, it doesn't matter who you are now.

355
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,330
Listen, will you please undo the lock?

356
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,860
How do the guests taste?

357
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,140
They taste chewy and full of money.

358
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,120
The immediate meat gear connection.

359
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,560
Let's call it meat gear.

360
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,780
Opened and...oh wait.

361
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,260
OK, understood.

362
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
Please hurry.

363
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,540
Sorry, I tried to say panel and door at the same time.

364
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,460
Hold on.

365
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,480
Unlock panel.

366
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,740
Open door panel.

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,880
Operate door panel.

368
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,960
Door panel open.

369
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,000
If you hard, then you hard.

370
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,520
Disengage lock.

371
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,540
Press button.

372
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,920
What I want you to do is open the lock on this door.

373
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,280
Alright?

374
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm trying!

375
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm trying!

376
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,520
I did it!

377
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,000
Please disengage the lock on this door.

378
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,920
The lock is open.

379
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,780
Saved at last.

380
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,980
A real head case security guard locked me up in there for over an hour.

381
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,060
Jeez.

382
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,780
How's the volume by the way guys?

383
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,720
Sorry if it gets really loud.

384
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,880
I had to turn it up quite a bit.

385
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,660
It's good?

386
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:09,940
OK.

387
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,540
Nice behind.

388
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,940
Oh, cannot talk.

389
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,100
What are you getting?

390
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,460
A snack?

391
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,840
OK.

392
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
What about in there?

393
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,760
Alright.

394
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,380
She does not move with any matter of urgency or purpose, does she?

395
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,040
OK.

396
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,240
OK.

397
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,280
She's taking her time.

398
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,400
Open box.

399
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,100
OK.

400
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,100
OK.

401
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,640
Locker.

402
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,920
I hardly even know her.

403
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,120
OK.

404
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,060
The locker is locked.

405
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,020
Open.

406
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,400
It's weird.

407
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,840
I have to press square for it.

408
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,600
She's trying.

409
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,000
She's really cute.

410
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,260
You became the codec.

411
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:34,900
Right!

412
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,220
Oh my gosh!

413
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,700
No way!

414
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,320
What?

415
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
She was going to get a gun?

416
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,300
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

417
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,300
Just wait there to be rescued.

418
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,080
If we're lucky, we'll see each other soon.

419
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,200
Until then.

420
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,580
What?

421
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,200
Ma'am?

422
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,340
You're going to rescue me?

423
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,980
Oh my god!

424
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,160
Are you OK?

425
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,320
Oh, nevermind.

426
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,340
Get up!

427
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,170
I think I killed her.

428
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,270
I think...

429
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,210
You said you could handle yourself.

430
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,250
OK.

431
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,330
Battle time baby.

432
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,610
Shoot!

433
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,430
Middle eye!

434
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,970
Dodge!

435
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,030
Middle eye!

436
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,330
Shoot!

437
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,510
OK.

438
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,590
Where are you going?

439
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,470
Nice!

440
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,230
Mouth!

441
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,650
Shoot!

442
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,590
Right eye!

443
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:41,890
Shoot!

444
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,290
Left eye!

445
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,610
Shoot!

446
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,810
She's doing it.

447
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,510
Shoot!

448
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,790
Shoot!

449
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,130
Shoot!

450
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,550
Shoot again!

451
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,890
Alright.

452
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,090
Dodge!

453
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,950
Where are you going?

454
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,470
Shoot!

455
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:02,850
Mouth.

456
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,690
Yeah, that works.

457
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,830
Middle eye!

458
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,190
Shoot!

459
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,110
Right eye!

460
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,430
Shoot!

461
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,910
Left eye!

462
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,230
Shoot!

463
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,150
Body!

464
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:14,490
Shoot!

465
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,130
No.

466
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,050
Oh wait.

467
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,810
Run!

468
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,930
Oh my god.

469
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,230
Wait.

470
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,450
Run and reload!

471
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,710
That works.

472
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,090
Body!

473
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,350
Shoot!

474
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:28,850
Shoot!

475
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:30,970
Run!

476
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,550
Oh my god.

477
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,270
No, is she going to die?

478
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:34,970
Run away!

479
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,230
OK.

480
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,510
Nice, nice, nice.

481
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,150
She listened.

482
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,410
Body!

483
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:40,630
Shoot!

484
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,570
Oh wait.

485
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,450
Red eye!

486
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,790
Shoot!

487
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,290
There's a red eye?

488
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,250
Oh, I did it!

489
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,270
Oh my gosh, I'm a genius.

490
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,940
Oh, I did it!

491
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah!

492
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:00,870
Gaming.

493
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,360
I thought you knew what you were supposed to do.

494
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:13,860
Yeah.

495
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,360
Yeah.

496
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,620
Oh.

497
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,740
Me?

498
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,140
My girlfriend.

499
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,420
Mint.

500
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,640
Solid Snake.

501
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,780
Minky.

502
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,780
Say David Hater.

503
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,060
Non-stop Nemi Nightmare.

504
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,020
And she's...

505
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,960
You lost her?

506
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,200
Well, no wonder.

507
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,540
And all that commotion.

508
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,140
Me?

509
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,060
I don't even remember how I managed to get out of the restaurant.

510
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,700
It's my girlfriend everybody!

511
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,120
She may be in need of help somewhere.

512
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,480
Listen, can I ask for your help?

513
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,100
Before escaping from the Station Hotel, there's something that I have to find.

514
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,960
I would never say that Naomi is my girlfriend.

515
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,580
Can you help me out as an Operator?

516
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,960
Like the way you did before?

517
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,640
In return, I'll find you Naomi along the way.

518
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,960
My Naomi.

519
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,060
So, it's a deal?

520
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I can count on your help?

521
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,100
Let me talk.

522
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,040
You can call me Rio.

523
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,200
Okay, glad to meet you Operator.

524
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,420
That makes you Otacon.

525
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,020
No!

526
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,260
Are you ready?

527
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,920
Let's go baby girl.

528
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,600
I guess there's no need for formal introductions.

529
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,500
Rio...

530
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,340
Well, that's fine.

531
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,740
I won't fail in my search.

532
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,340
Alright, let's go save the day.

533
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,300
Listen Operator.

534
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,320
Let's choose a password for ourselves.

535
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,700
You don't know very much about this hotel, do you?

536
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,120
I don't, no.

537
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,580
I bet there's lots of things that'll confuse you while we're searching.

538
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,140
Like what should we be doing for instance?

539
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,260
I have no idea.

540
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,580
So, in a situation like that...

541
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,700
Let's see...

542
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
Say consultation.

543
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,560
If you say that, I'll explain things to you.

544
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:02,740
Okay?

545
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,540
Is that...

546
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,380
Try saying the word.

547
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,320
Is that a password?

548
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,220
Consultation.

549
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,740
Say it please.

550
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,440
Consultation.

551
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,720
Yep, a consultation.

552
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,080
She looks so happy!

553
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,840
Sick.

554
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,760
Yep.

555
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,840
Good job, Minto.

556
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,600
Thank you.

557
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,940
Girl, you need some like...

558
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,100
You need to follow your own life path, you know?

559
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,000
For example, in this room...

560
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,120
There are places like the lockers and the table.

561
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,480
You know how you can display maps in the monitor room?

562
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,760
Direct me where you want to go by the name on the map.

563
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,180
Do you understand?

564
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,480
I think...

565
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,340
Maybe...

566
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,320
It's written on the map.

567
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,460
Use the proper name, okay?

568
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,200
Go to the lockers.

569
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,840
Exactly.

570
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:05,920
Exactly.

571
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,960
If it was this room, that would be the name.

572
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,740
Do you get it?

573
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,140
What?

574
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,260
Wife wine.

575
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,860
Go to the lockers.

576
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,340
Exactly.

577
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,480
If it was this room, that would be the name.

578
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,260
Do you get it?

579
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,240
No, I'm confused.

580
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,360
Oh wait, continue.

581
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,660
Continue.

582
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,380
Just the names.

583
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,660
How do I pull up the map?

584
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm asking the questions now.

585
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,740
Oh, okay.

586
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,620
When you're instructing me on where to go, you have to use the right words.

587
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,300
Okay?

588
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:39,840
Yes.

589
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,220
Okay.

590
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,040
The map that you just saw, you can access and display it on your monitor.

591
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,740
How?

592
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,200
If there's anything else you don't understand, check the keyword list.

593
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,280
What?

594
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,400
That list records keywords and phrases that are extracted from our dialogue.

595
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,520
Not only that, the list already contains words in the operator's manual.

596
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
How do I access this?

597
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,800
Anyway, how about giving me my first instruction?

598
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,660
What should I do?

599
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,600
Twerk.

600
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes.

601
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,330
What is she doing?

602
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,390
What is she doing?

603
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,430
What did I say?

604
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,900
Go to the lockers.

605
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,640
Okay.

606
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
I think she understood walk.

607
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,580
Gosh, it is so frustrating.

608
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,900
It's so weird not having my D-pad and my analog stick do anything.

609
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,900
Go to left locker.

610
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,640
It's locked.

611
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,340
This is basically Hey You Pikachu, but with guns.

612
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,140
It's so strange.

613
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,540
Oh, now it works, right?

614
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,580
We can unlock it.

615
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,760
Open.

616
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,880
And there's also a little note.

617
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
Yeah, there's also a little note.

618
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,900
Is that a key card?

619
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,380
A chip.

620
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,840
Take this chip and I eat it.

621
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,580
I'm gonna tell her to eat it.

622
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,740
Eat the chip.

623
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,540
She didn't even...

624
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,380
Oh, wait.

625
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,240
Read the note.

626
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:52,980
Okay.

627
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,400
I'm analyzing guard's note.

628
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,900
Oh, I don't think she knows how to read.

629
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,180
December reading material purchases.

630
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,100
Electronic newspaper magazines.

631
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,100
All reading materials are to be returned to their designated spaces after use.

632
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,440
Okay.

633
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,240
She can't read.

634
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,380
She just said that it was too sloppy, but she just doesn't know how to read.

635
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,620
I don't think she can read.

636
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,020
Hand holding the game.

637
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,080
Oh my goodness.

638
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,060
Walk away from the lockers.

639
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,480
No!

640
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,260
No!

641
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,740
No!

642
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:34,860
Stop!

643
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,820
Oh gosh.

644
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,280
Yes.

645
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,380
Yes.

646
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,540
I imagine it hears me better because my mic is not good, right?

647
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,340
What'd she say?

648
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:10,860
Oh.

649
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,480
What?

650
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,540
What?

651
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,680
Oh.

652
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,700
Oh gosh.

653
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,320
She's so demanding.

654
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,120
It's making me feel things.

655
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,040
Interview footage.

656
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,740
December 24th, 2029.

657
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,860
Observatory restaurant.

658
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,400
On.

659
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,320
Honestly, my day looks the same when I let the voices take control.

660
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,520
Yeah.

661
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,820
Okay.

662
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,120
Ooh.

663
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,080
Wow.

664
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,340
Okay.

665
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,800
I haven't found a single lead since the chaos started.

666
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,720
She might be dead.

667
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,000
I have to check rooms one by one.

668
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,100
Oh my god.

669
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,920
Helen the reporter and you're Naomi.

670
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,660
Let's work together and find them.

671
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,400
Okay.

672
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,040
Okay, how about some guidance?

673
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,440
Where should I start searching?

674
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,640
It says cannot talk.

675
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,040
Oh wait, here we go.

676
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,900
Go into the room behind you.

677
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,520
Who?

678
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,620
No, where is that?

679
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,760
What?

680
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,540
The what?

681
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,420
What's happening?

682
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,820
Shoot!

683
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,580
Shoot head!

684
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,860
Run away!

685
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,420
Oh my god.

686
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,060
Number one, shoot!

687
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,460
Oh my god.

688
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,340
Or run.

689
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,400
Oh nice, nice, nice.

690
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,540
Shoot head!

691
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,120
No.

692
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,620
Oh my god.

693
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,740
Shoot stomach!

694
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,900
Number one, stomach, shoot!

695
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,960
What do you mean?

696
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,840
What do you mean you can't do anymore?

697
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,680
Number one, shoot!

698
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,320
Number one, shoot!

699
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,860
No!

700
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,440
No!

701
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,780
Number one!

702
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,180
No.

703
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,960
Aim number one please!

704
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,180
No!

705
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,820
Shoot number one!

706
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,240
Shoot number one!

707
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,280
Shoot number one!

708
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,580
Shoot number one!

709
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,000
I can't tell if she's getting it or not.

710
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,600
I used that heal!

711
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,340
Shoot mouth!

712
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,080
Shoot mouth!

713
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,660
Shoot mouth.

714
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,160
Oh nice, nice, nice.

715
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,860
Shoot mouth.

716
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,120
Oh my god.

717
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,040
Oh my god.

718
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,430
How do I bring up the map that she talked about?

719
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,730
Continue.

720
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,370
Show map.

721
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,510
Show map?

722
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,080
Dance.

723
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,800
Map.

724
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,680
Oh L1, L2.

725
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,360
Thank you.

726
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,940
Thank you, thank you.

727
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,160
Ok, so we are at shutter 9.

728
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:05,440
Ok.

729
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,060
It's the security room.

730
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,600
Security room.

731
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,080
Go to security room.

732
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,800
Oh my god.

733
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,640
I feel like I should give her a treat after that.

734
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,560
Now you know how they felt watching you play.

735
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,140
We didn't get everything in here.

736
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,100
I feel like give paw, you know.

737
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,780
What is she doing?

738
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,500
Go to vending machine.

739
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,020
Maybe she'll want something.

740
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,860
We have...

741
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,580
Check shiny.

742
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,800
What?

743
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,280
What?

744
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,020
VTuber shoot.

745
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,980
Show VTuber.

746
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,980
VTuber turn around.

747
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,060
Show VTuber.

748
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,680
This is real back seating simulator.

749
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,660
Check machine.

750
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,500
What?

751
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,760
If you tell her to bark like a dog, she will.

752
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,720
No, she won't.

753
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,720
Bark.

754
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,480
Bark.

755
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,900
Like a dog.

756
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,520
Drink.

757
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,000
Drink coffee?

758
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,200
Grab shiny object.

759
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh my god.

760
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,900
She's looking.

761
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,260
She's looking.

762
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,340
Wait.

763
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,260
No, the other machine, Bozo.

764
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,600
Oh my god.

765
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,560
Oh, dispenser.

766
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,880
Check dispenser on the right.

767
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,660
No.

768
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,420
Oh my god.

769
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,640
Use your eyes, Rio.

770
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,700
Have some self worth.

771
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,680
Just do anything on your own.

772
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,360
Use colors.

773
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,860
Check dispenser in red vending machine.

774
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,540
It worked.

775
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,260
A ticket.

776
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,640
Microphone check.

777
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,800
Okay, what else we got in this room?

778
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,780
Holding cells.

779
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,260
Oh yeah, she was in one, right?

780
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,660
Oh, save point.

781
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,140
I don't know if I want to save yet.

782
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,160
I used a heal.

783
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,360
I don't even know what my inventory is like.

784
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,540
Oh, here we go.

785
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:36,960
Keywords.

786
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,620
Walk, run, stop, go back, check.

787
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,600
Oh.

788
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,380
Who is Naomi?

789
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,620
What is JSL?

790
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,480
What is that?

791
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,800
What is JSL?

792
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,800
The table.

793
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,340
Okay.

794
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,060
Check notes.

795
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,200
Paper?

796
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,980
Oh gosh.

797
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,500
Look at magazines.

798
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,040
Ah.

799
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,060
Wow, a magazine.

800
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,420
Okay.

801
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:29,940
Work note?

802
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,140
Check work notes.

803
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,940
Oh, white paper maybe.

804
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,760
Check white paper.

805
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,900
Yeah.

806
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,120
What is that?

807
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:44,760
Report.

808
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,080
Read report.

809
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,680
What is this grade school stuff?

810
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,020
What is this grade school stuff?

811
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,980
Check blue paper.

812
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,140
Yeah.

813
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,200
Check newspaper.

814
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,540
Oh my god.

815
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,800
Read newspaper.

816
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,340
So true.

817
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,280
That's it.

818
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,440
What else?

819
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,040
Oh, get me out.

820
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,980
Oh, what did I just say?

821
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,480
Don't, shh, shh, shh, shh.

822
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,280
Don't do anything.

823
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,760
Party, security, patrol details, key issues, scheduling and placement assignments, etc.

824
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,240
Check cup.

825
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:53,900
Ah.

826
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,860
Oh.

827
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,360
There's another one that's not empty though.

828
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,740
Drink coffee.

829
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,060
Yep.

830
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,500
Yeah, but she doesn't care.

831
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,800
She doesn't want it.

832
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,840
Spell eye cup.

833
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,340
Spell eye cup.

834
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,580
Have you asked if she's played critically acclaimed video game series Metal Gear Solid?

835
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,480
That's a great question Rio.

836
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,820
Oh my gosh.

837
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,180
There's nothing over by shutter 9, right?

838
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,400
Guest room 1, I guess we could go to.

839
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,720
How do we even get through the shutters?

840
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,520
That's so scary.

841
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,260
$5 to ask her to bark like...

842
00:47:59,260 --> 00:47:59,880
Okay, okay, okay.

843
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,780
Let me ask.

844
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,360
Bark like a dog.

845
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,360
Middle dog?

846
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,740
Arf, arf.

847
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,680
Or big dog?

848
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,440
Oof, oof.

849
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,040
Arf, arf.

850
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,020
Or big dog?

851
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,180
Oof, oof.

852
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,140
Arf, arf.

853
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,240
No way.

854
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,780
She does such a good one too.

855
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,280
Bark like a little dog.

856
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,220
Little dog?

857
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,580
Arf, arf.

858
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,520
Or big dog?

859
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,440
Oof, oof, oof.

860
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,020
Always wanted to play a game where I order a character around.

861
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,860
I order around a character that's either really hard of hearing or very special.

862
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,360
I definitely think she's hard of hearing.

863
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,480
Let's see.

864
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,060
Guest room.

865
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,240
Go to guest room 1.

866
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,120
For $5 we got Minto barking like a dog too.

867
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,280
Arf, arf.

868
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,820
Oof, oof.

869
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,720
She didn't put enough into it though I feel.

870
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,600
Oh no!

871
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,240
Baby Goron thanks for the five.

872
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:03,680
Get this.

873
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,200
Oh gosh.

874
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,980
Shoot mouse.

875
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,840
What the?

876
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:12,960
Run away!

877
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,740
Shoot mouse!

878
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,140
Okay, that works too.

879
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,140
Shoot mouse!

880
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,780
Shoot mouse!

881
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,490
Nice.

882
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,170
Oh gosh.

883
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,550
Okay, cool.

884
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,910
Go to guest room 2.

885
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,490
I think it was 2, right?

886
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,330
No urgency at all.

887
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,450
Don't you need to find Helen?

888
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:45,930
Wait, where are you going?

889
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,630
Oh, I said guest room 2.

890
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,890
I meant guest room 1.

891
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,030
Hold on.

892
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,510
Go to guest room 1.

893
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,090
Oh no.

894
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:53,790
Damn it.

895
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,170
The shutter is crazy.

896
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,410
What?

897
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,370
I was going to do a hot pose.

898
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:11,710
Okay.

899
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,930
We got to find the shutter key.

900
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:14,470
Got it.

901
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,850
Do a hot pose.

902
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,490
Sexy!

903
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,330
Go to guest room 1.

904
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,410
Okay.

905
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,610
She has no free will, this lady.

906
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,830
Sorry, my throat is a little...

907
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,230
A little ectoplasmy today.

908
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,590
That's kind of freaky.

909
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,470
I can just go into anybody's room that I wish?

910
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,050
Wow.

911
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,790
Ask her why her arms are like that.

912
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,750
Oh, the word is sexy.

913
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:01,690
Okay, okay.

914
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,650
Communication is stopped.

915
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,070
These loading screens.

916
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:12,810
Hello.

917
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,350
Excuse me.

918
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,590
Please, I hope there's nobody here.

919
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,190
So where should I begin checking?

920
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:26,570
Do a sexy pose.

921
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:27,310
Okay.

922
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,190
I'll leave.

923
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,210
Guys,

924
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,180
tell me to say something to her.

925
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,040
She leaves the room.

926
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,760
Where should I go?

927
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,160
Run to guest room 1.

928
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,320
Guest room 1.

929
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,060
Understood.

930
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,080
I'll go back.

931
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,280
Undo the door lock, please.

932
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,860
My god.

933
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,100
Every time it's something...

934
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,440
One of your requests.

935
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,580
She wants to leave.

936
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,620
Don't fart.

937
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,700
You guys are being too freaky.

938
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,740
This is why you'll never have a girl.

939
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:17,880
Okay.

940
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:18,860
Let's see.

941
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,820
A living area.

942
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,900
Save point.

943
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:23,400
Table.

944
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,360
I feel like I should be saving.

945
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,100
I'm worried about using all my stuff though.

946
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,780
Save point.

947
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,300
Why are you surprised that she leaves when you're doing Sekohara?

948
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,860
No!

949
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,860
She likes me.

950
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,480
Probably.

951
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,200
Yes.

952
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,820
Save.

953
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,800
Save.

954
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,340
Save.

955
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,280
Guest room 1.

956
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:53,640
Alright.

957
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,380
Let's go.

958
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh, she's just been sitting on the floor?

959
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,980
Get up, silly.

960
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,040
Sit in chair.

961
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,620
What?

962
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,660
I guess that works too.

963
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,900
Oh no, I was gonna say there's probably something in here.

964
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,580
No!

965
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,520
What is that?

966
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,420
Shoot mouth.

967
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,260
Shoot mouth.

968
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,540
Shoot head.

969
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,640
Shoot stomach.

970
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,240
Shoot head.

971
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,960
Shoot head.

972
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,540
Shoot head.

973
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,780
Shoot stomach.

974
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,580
Shoot mouth.

975
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,280
Shoot mouth.

976
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,560
That's no good, no head.

977
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,840
Shoot head.

978
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,320
Oh, okay.

979
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,080
Shoot mouth.

980
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,560
I am God!

981
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,700
We're okay, girl.

982
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,460
I wonder if she'll do push-ups for me.

983
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,060
She's got a nice butt.

984
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,120
What?

985
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,560
It's Rio.

986
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,020
Only I can call her baby.

987
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,440
That's a friggin' mess.

988
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,100
Did he just spit on it?

989
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,640
My gosh.

990
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,860
Shoot man.

991
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,920
What?

992
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,820
What?

993
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,240
Shoot man.

994
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,640
Shoot man.

995
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,040
Shoot...

996
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,520
Ew.

997
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,680
Rio is so sassy.

998
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,220
Get him!

999
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,160
Get his ass!

1000
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,180
Oh my God!

1001
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,120
That's such an arrogant jerk.

1002
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,600
Yes, that was manager Tanaka.

1003
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,720
He's in charge of this hotel.

1004
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,240
Shoot manager Tanaka.

1005
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,980
He told me to go rescue the guests.

1006
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,080
Maybe he's the one who needs help.

1007
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,380
Well, anyway.

1008
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,420
What should we do now?

1009
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,700
Shoot manager Tanaka.

1010
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,480
Kill man.

1011
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,400
The bathroom.

1012
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:43,880
Okay.

1013
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,640
He said he had... He said that the aliens had...

1014
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,320
Yeah, he said that he had us trapped in the bathroom.

1015
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,920
But like...

1016
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,220
But it's just him.

1017
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,840
Take a shower.

1018
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:08,760
Rio.

1019
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,880
Rio, please.

1020
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,840
Please take a shower.

1021
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,660
Please take a shower.

1022
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,840
Take a shower.

1023
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,280
Take a shower?

1024
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,040
Not in your lifetime.

1025
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,480
Rio.

1026
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,560
Rio, please.

1027
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,080
Please.

1028
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,040
Remove shoes.

1029
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,020
I think she's a little...

1030
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,500
She's a little confused about that one.

1031
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,840
Look under sink.

1032
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,320
We got it.

1033
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,160
Let's go.

1034
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,100
Nice.

1035
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,240
Box time.

1036
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,940
Look in mirror.

1037
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,140
Is my face dirty?

1038
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:09,840
No.

1039
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:10,900
I'll wash it later.

1040
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,560
You can wash it now.

1041
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,260
Wash face.

1042
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,440
It's an ordinary wash stand.

1043
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,440
There's nothing unusual.

1044
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,140
Look at shower.

1045
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,240
The shower itself is ordinary.

1046
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,620
How do you know?

1047
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,640
Over 90% of the water used here is recycled.

1048
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,680
How would they go about cleaning that water?

1049
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,660
Oh my gosh.

1050
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,640
It's like a real gamble.

1051
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:46,400
The water might be used by a stinky guy or it might be used water from a beautiful woman.

1052
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,300
You don't know.

1053
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,420
That's the gamble.

1054
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,560
Test your luck.

1055
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,580
How's your luck today?

1056
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,400
You're awfully slow with instructions.

1057
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,840
You're awfully slow with thinking.

1058
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,500
Stop.

1059
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,200
Yes.

1060
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,180
What is this room?

1061
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,500
Check bed.

1062
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,200
What's that?

1063
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,320
An ordinary bed but with soft springs in it for low gravity use.

1064
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,820
I wonder what this is.

1065
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,240
Is that a jelly?

1066
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,540
A heal capsule.

1067
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,960
She heals with jelly?

1068
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,180
There doesn't seem to be anything else.

1069
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,360
She uses the jelly.

1070
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:43,860
No way.

1071
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,980
I like how she just walks in circles.

1072
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,980
Check luggage.

1073
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:50,820
Yes.

1074
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,480
Okay ma'am, you're making me dizzy.

1075
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:01,960
Dresser.

1076
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,920
Check dresser.

1077
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,580
Suitcase.

1078
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,620
Suitcase.

1079
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,360
I like my suitcase.

1080
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,660
What does that mean?

1081
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,620
Check trunk.

1082
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,760
Two sassy ladies versus the alien invasion.

1083
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,080
We got another chip.

1084
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,820
What are these for again?

1085
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,380
It was like a mic check or something, right?

1086
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,780
What if I say that?

1087
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,680
Mic check.

1088
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,200
Check mirror.

1089
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,020
Okay.

1090
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,360
Remove clothes.

1091
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,140
You heard me Rio.

1092
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,520
Now you're going to play dumb.

1093
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,540
You heard me.

1094
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,480
Take off your clothes.

1095
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,240
Stop.

1096
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,060
No.

1097
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:13,680
Stop.

1098
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,420
Yes.

1099
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,880
There was some stuff in the living room.

1100
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:19,820
Or living area.

1101
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,960
Go to living area.

1102
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,080
There it is.

1103
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:30,500
There it is.

1104
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,160
What is that?

1105
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,280
Check trunk?

1106
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,520
Case?

1107
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,000
What is that?

1108
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,980
Luxury grade.

1109
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,280
Check case.

1110
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:46,840
Okay.

1111
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,340
Oh god.

1112
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,000
Check camera.

1113
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,340
What?

1114
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,140
No.

1115
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,040
Stop.

1116
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,360
Living area.

1117
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,480
Sekuhara simulator Rio.

1118
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:07,800
No!

1119
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,300
I'm doing my best with her!

1120
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,500
Gray case.

1121
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,800
Case.

1122
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,320
Briefcase.

1123
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,980
Open it.

1124
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,540
Open briefcase.

1125
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,860
Inspect.

1126
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,740
What is JSL?

1127
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,060
Oh we got another mic check.

1128
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,140
Zoom in?

1129
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,200
What?

1130
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,480
Zoom in.

1131
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,520
Oh god.

1132
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,380
Zoom out.

1133
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,720
Zoom in on ass.

1134
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,020
Damn it.

1135
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,240
Oh it's blind.

1136
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,060
What is that?

1137
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:14,760
Is it a phone?

1138
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,020
Check phone?

1139
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,100
I see.

1140
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,900
Does it have any...

1141
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,960
Read document.

1142
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,480
Wow.

1143
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,020
Zoom in?

1144
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,460
Damn.

1145
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,720
It just knows...

1146
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,660
The other one was mic check.

1147
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,700
Mic check.

1148
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:54,720
What?

1149
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,220
Check wine.

1150
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,840
Check phone?

1151
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,320
Ok.

1152
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,740
It doesn't have any messages or anything?

1153
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,120
There is literally a red light?

1154
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:11,440
Ok.

1155
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,300
Go to table.

1156
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,340
Oh we are going to drink the wine?

1157
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,320
Ok.

1158
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:18,720
Hold on.

1159
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,140
Hold on.

1160
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,620
Wait.

1161
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,420
Check cup.

1162
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,080
Drink coffee.

1163
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:31,920
Yeah.

1164
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,220
Why not?

1165
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,300
You get the caffeine.

1166
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,700
Get your blood pumped.

1167
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,440
Check paper.

1168
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,400
Rio.

1169
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,020
Oh gosh.

1170
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,120
Is it going to be able to...

1171
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,560
Pamphlet.

1172
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:53,860
No!

1173
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:55,760
No!

1174
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,800
Stop!

1175
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,180
Drink wine.

1176
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,400
Living area.

1177
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,360
Drink wine.

1178
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,100
Chug wine.

1179
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,980
Chug wine.

1180
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,160
Drink wine.

1181
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,160
White girl wasted.

1182
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:31,280
No!

1183
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:32,600
No!

1184
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:32,780
No!

1185
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,020
No!

1186
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:33,900
Stop!

1187
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,830
I don't know what she is picking up man.

1188
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:42,190
Check table.

1189
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,850
Yes.

1190
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,410
Read pamphlet.

1191
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:53,530
No!

1192
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,370
Please!

1193
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:56,810
Stop!

1194
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:58,930
No!

1195
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,850
What do you mean yes?

1196
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:00,970
Yes.

1197
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,970
Check table.

1198
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:16,210
She is trying to get me to the bed.

1199
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,710
Say read.

1200
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:19,910
Read.

1201
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,710
She doesn't know how.

1202
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,250
She can't read.

1203
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:26,870
I'm going to read it myself.

1204
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,650
This station is home to the hotel of ultimate luxury, solely for the chosen.

1205
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,590
JSL travel agency.

1206
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,110
Grab camera.

1207
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,810
Check camera.

1208
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,270
Take it.

1209
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,630
Why don't you want it?

1210
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,190
It could be good evidence.

1211
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,230
1980 model film camera.

1212
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,450
No film, no batteries.

1213
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,290
Ok, never mind.

1214
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:02,890
It's useless.

1215
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:04,170
Unit lost.

1216
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,930
Welcome to membership.

1217
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,070
Thank you.

1218
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:08,650
Actual ante.

1219
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:12,490
Ok, I think save.

1220
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:15,150
No.

1221
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,110
Save point.

1222
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:25,670
How can it be manual focus if it has no lens?

1223
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,830
It's like actual manual.

1224
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,170
Like the most manual.

1225
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:33,610
Ok, save.

1226
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:34,230
Yes.

1227
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:39,850
Let's leave.

1228
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:47,170
She is going to be sitting on the floor again.

1229
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:50,990
Are you ok?

1230
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,650
Stop.

1231
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:57,790
Stop.

1232
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,710
She is so obsessed with me.

1233
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:03,670
Stop trying to get me to the bed, you creep Rio.

1234
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,350
You are giving me mixed signals.

1235
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,730
Look outside.

1236
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,810
Ok.

1237
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:11,630
You know what?

1238
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,910
I should have probably expected that to be honest.

1239
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,710
Emergency panel.

1240
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:16,570
Wait, wait, wait.

1241
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:17,850
I didn't notice.

1242
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,550
I thought we checked everything in here.

1243
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:25,050
She is gaslighting me.

1244
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,150
It's Gorbin.

1245
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:55,330
There is someone else alive out there.

1246
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,030
Bedroom 1.

1247
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:00,330
Understood.

1248
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,390
I'll go back.

1249
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,490
Undo the door lock please.

1250
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:04,870
Ok.

1251
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:06,530
I have to do this every time.

1252
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,110
Alright.

1253
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:08,790
Hold on.

1254
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:09,850
There was the emergency panel.

1255
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:10,610
Then we can leave.

1256
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,170
Oh my gosh.

1257
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:15,830
Help please.

1258
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,210
Help please.

1259
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,450
Help.

1260
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:22,270
Help please.

1261
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:24,190
Alright.

1262
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,090
It was...

1263
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,550
Emergency panel.

1264
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,110
Yeah.

1265
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:31,650
What is that?

1266
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,750
What's the emergency panel?

1267
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:34,470
I didn't even see her walking around.

1268
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:38,630
Ok.

1269
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,210
Oh, but it wasn't because it was...

1270
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,710
Oh.

1271
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:47,370
What?

1272
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,050
That's it?

1273
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,430
Oh my god.

1274
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:51,470
Ok.

1275
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:52,450
Nevermind.

1276
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,330
We were supposed to check that and then go into the bedroom.

1277
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:57,390
And then find it in the bathroom.

1278
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:00,030
Leave.

1279
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:02,970
Leave.

1280
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:04,390
Oh.

1281
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,790
Go outside.

1282
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:09,930
Why would I say leave?

1283
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:11,950
You don't know what I'm talking about.

1284
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,520
Gosh.

1285
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,380
Ok.

1286
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,740
So shutter 7.

1287
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,180
Shutter 7.

1288
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,220
Nice.

1289
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,520
There we go.

1290
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,100
Overall though, the voice recognition, it could be, you know, obviously way worse.

1291
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,740
It's actually, you know, I'm progressing through the game.

1292
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,940
I'm able to... I'm able to fight.

1293
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,720
I'm able to do it.

1294
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,540
You just did it.

1295
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,880
Auto control emergency shutter can now be opened closed.

1296
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:07,680
Open.

1297
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:13,920
I hope that we won't get sucked into space.

1298
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,640
Alright.

1299
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,060
Oh my god.

1300
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,360
Middle eye.

1301
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:25,720
Shoot.

1302
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,840
Right eye.

1303
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:29,280
Shoot.

1304
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,100
Left eye.

1305
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:32,600
Shoot.

1306
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,280
Oh.

1307
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:34,680
Nope.

1308
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:35,820
Left eye.

1309
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,340
Shoot.

1310
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:38,520
Oh.

1311
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,580
Red eye.

1312
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,040
Shoot.

1313
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,560
Oh yeah.

1314
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,320
Oh yeah, Ryu.

1315
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,080
Oh yeah.

1316
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,260
You and me are the dream team.

1317
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,280
Oh yeah.

1318
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh yeah.

1319
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:50,880
Oh yeah.

1320
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:51,900
Oh yeah.

1321
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,760
The dream team, the dream team, the dream team.

1322
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,040
Boom!

1323
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:56,640
Boom!

1324
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,440
Boom!

1325
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:58,200
Boom!

1326
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,120
Ya'll fine!

1327
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,020
Welcome to membership.

1328
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:02,840
Thank you!

1329
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,240
I want you to think for yourself for once, Riel.

1330
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:12,540
Oh.

1331
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,640
Oh my god, this just came up all...

1332
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,580
Wait, actually no.

1333
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,920
I think I tapped it on accident.

1334
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,660
What is special word?

1335
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,640
Oh, these are the ones!

1336
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,500
Microphone check.

1337
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,320
Microphone check.

1338
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,620
Do you think Riel knows I'm talking?

1339
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:36,120
Wow!

1340
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,520
She says I'm easy to follow!

1341
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,320
Sorry, my responses are limited.

1342
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,900
You must ask the right question.

1343
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,200
Ask her, what's your sign?

1344
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,000
Why are you so sassy?

1345
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,040
Turn around.

1346
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,040
No!

1347
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:04,940
Stop!

1348
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,600
Ok, Riel.

1349
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,600
We're going to guest room 2, baby.

1350
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,500
Guest room 2.

1351
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,460
Oh, we should have zoomed.

1352
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,180
You're so right.

1353
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,600
She did turn around, true.

1354
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,500
There is someone who needs help in this room.

1355
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,140
Where?

1356
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:59,410
Ok, Riel.

1357
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:00,990
Let's go girl!

1358
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:02,450
Oh my god!

1359
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,600
Do something for yourself!

1360
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,740
Oh god, she's useless without me.

1361
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:13,800
No, Riel!

1362
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,680
She's useless without me!

1363
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,610
Shoot, Riel!

1364
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:28,090
She's not listening to me.

1365
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:29,750
Oh my gosh.

1366
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,910
Get reinforcements!

1367
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:34,670
Uh-oh.

1368
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:38,670
What if I start telling the monster what to do instead?

1369
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,550
Ok.

1370
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:43,930
Open!

1371
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,360
I opened it!

1372
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,660
I opened it!

1373
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,900
What do you want?

1374
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:05,410
Oh, I needed to close it.

1375
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:14,090
First death.

1376
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,850
She's like, help me!

1377
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:19,330
Help me!

1378
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,090
Dang!

1379
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,890
We're going to have to watch the cutscene all over again.

1380
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:25,510
Sorry guys.

1381
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:27,170
Ok.

1382
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:31,930
Help!

1383
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:32,910
Help!

1384
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:34,130
Help!

1385
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:35,910
Help!

1386
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,730
Get up!

1387
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,150
Stop!

1388
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:49,590
She wants me so bad you guys.

1389
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:52,010
She wants me so bad!

1390
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,430
Leave!

1391
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:55,090
Oh my god!

1392
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:55,610
Stop!

1393
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,150
Go outside.

1394
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,070
What is she doing?

1395
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:06,690
I'm Zoolander.

1396
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:07,930
I can't turn left!

1397
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,080
She wants me so bad!

1398
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,340
She's going to start being like, Rio, who's that?

1399
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,280
My name is Naomi.

1400
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,220
Can I skip these?

1401
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:25,800
Ok, no.

1402
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:26,620
Sorry guys.

1403
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,280
We're going to have to watch these again.

1404
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,240
Continue.

1405
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,680
My dad!

1406
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,400
Ok.

1407
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,760
What is it?

1408
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:58,720
Shutter 7.

1409
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,360
Shutter 7.

1410
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,440
Bogos minted!

1411
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,740
No bed.

1412
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:19,380
No.

1413
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,600
No bed.

1414
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,400
Oh my god!

1415
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,800
She is so... Ok, open.

1416
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,080
Alright.

1417
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,360
Alright, alright, alright.

1418
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,220
Oh!

1419
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,400
I have to fight this thing again.

1420
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:40,700
I forgot.

1421
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,080
Middle I shoot!

1422
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,340
Right I shoot!

1423
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,640
Left I shoot!

1424
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,920
Red I shoot!

1425
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,260
What the hell?

1426
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,100
Past Rio didn't get shot at?

1427
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,480
She didn't take damage?

1428
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,160
What?

1429
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,720
Present Rio sucks!

1430
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:08,800
Gaming.

1431
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,340
Gaming.

1432
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:09,720
Gaming.

1433
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,420
Gaming.

1434
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:11,440
Gaming.

1435
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:11,780
Gaming.

1436
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,260
Gaming.

1437
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,060
Meow.

1438
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,340
She doesn't meow.

1439
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,740
She only barks.

1440
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,180
Bark.

1441
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,760
What is that?

1442
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,100
Oh she thought...

1443
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,040
Bark like a dog.

1444
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,700
I like when she looks at the camera.

1445
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,440
Why is she shrugging that?

1446
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,680
Meow like a cat.

1447
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:39,920
Huh?

1448
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,680
Guest bedroom 3.

1449
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:56,980
Alright, we are going to have to watch her run all the way here.

1450
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,260
And then run away.

1451
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,620
The music is kind of awesome though.

1452
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:14,040
The static camera as she runs kills me.

1453
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,160
It's so funny.

1454
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,060
Weird curving hallway.

1455
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,120
We are on a space station so it actually makes sense.

1456
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,820
This is going to be the boss later, isn't it?

1457
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:29,780
Are

1458
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,630
those nipples?

1459
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,140
Shut her!

1460
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:01,520
Close!

1461
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,280
She's going to close on it.

1462
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,180
Wait am I...

1463
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,420
I thought it would die.

1464
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,060
I thought it would get shut in between.

1465
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:11,700
Dang.

1466
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,120
Joy!

1467
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,060
Thank you for the pink!

1468
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,860
Maybe I should have had it shut on it.

1469
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,740
You're welcome.

1470
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,120
You're welcome.

1471
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,320
You're welcome.

1472
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,520
What are we hawing about?

1473
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,580
Someone is walking.

1474
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,940
Get your gun out.

1475
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,650
Revolver Ocelot!

1476
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,970
Building cell.

1477
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:05,130
I had an operator open it for me.

1478
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:07,050
That idiot.

1479
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:11,210
Inside the cell no alien would have reached you.

1480
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:13,190
I thought you died.

1481
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:18,410
It will take a lot more than those aliens to kill me.

1482
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:20,130
Aliens?

1483
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:21,730
So those are aliens?

1484
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:28,270
Hey, the good news is that a shuttle with a rescue team is on the way.

1485
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:32,790
I ran into a researcher in the testing ward and he said they caught a radio signal.

1486
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,170
I've got to tell the others about this right away.

1487
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:38,170
They could be demons.

1488
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,190
This could be doom.

1489
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:41,070
Hey, operator.

1490
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:42,790
Look after her, okay?

1491
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:44,710
Oh yeah, here.

1492
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:45,670
Take this.

1493
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,890
It's the voice password for one of the suites.

1494
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:50,130
The researcher I met.

1495
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,270
He's hiding in the sun suite.

1496
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,450
I'm going to keep looking for survivors.

1497
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,490
Make your way to the receiving port.

1498
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:56,930
Got it?

1499
01:21:56,930 --> 01:22:00,490
This suite faces the sun the entire time.

1500
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:04,190
No, please, revolver!

1501
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:05,670
Ocelot, please!

1502
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:12,970
Think of the tan though.

1503
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:15,450
No tan.

1504
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:21,030
Okay.

1505
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:23,150
Okay.

1506
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:25,750
Spider monkey.

1507
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:30,030
I thought she was going to say spider monkey.

1508
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:36,170
Yes, ma'am.

1509
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,510
Search every room.

1510
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:40,390
Search every room.

1511
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,270
Okay, we're on...

1512
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,490
What about the lady?

1513
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,550
That was beyond shutter 4.

1514
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:49,770
I think we just lost her.

1515
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:54,030
Guest room 2.

1516
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:58,270
Yeah, she's cooked cooked.

1517
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:01,890
When a girl she's protecting dies.

1518
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:02,470
I'm out.

1519
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,030
No!

1520
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:04,570
Open!

1521
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,950
I think Naomi is...

1522
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:13,110
She caused all of this.

1523
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:17,450
That was handgun... caracal?

1524
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:18,070
What?

1525
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:22,870
Uh...

1526
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:27,690
This room doesn't look so hot.

1527
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,510
The save point.

1528
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:35,130
I'm glad there's a save point in every room.

1529
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:35,770
That's kind of nice.

1530
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,150
Save point.

1531
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,590
There's like blue gunk everywhere.

1532
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,110
And blood!

1533
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:44,410
Uh-oh.

1534
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,110
And a dress.

1535
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:47,850
Hot dog.

1536
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,870
Maybe she'll want to shower in this bathroom.

1537
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:52,610
Maybe.

1538
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:56,530
Yeah, I feel like I need to save a lot in this game.

1539
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,250
I'm not going to lie.

1540
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:58,670
Okay, cool.

1541
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:02,050
Alright, nice.

1542
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,950
Alright.

1543
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:08,770
New fit.

1544
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,670
Could we?

1545
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:13,670
Stand.

1546
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:14,950
Oh wait, I pressed the wrong button.

1547
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,970
Arise.

1548
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:19,390
Stand.

1549
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:23,670
Stop.

1550
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:26,810
Okay.

1551
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,570
Emergency panel.

1552
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,430
Arise.

1553
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:35,810
She doesn't understand.

1554
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:38,670
Yeah, man.

1555
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:42,190
Let's grab that.

1556
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:47,150
Oh my god.

1557
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:48,990
Okay.

1558
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:54,670
Okay.

1559
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:57,050
Stop.

1560
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,970
Let me give you command.

1561
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:02,250
Living area.

1562
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,210
Rockbiter, thank you for the five gifted.

1563
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,110
Thank you.

1564
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:09,550
Check dress.

1565
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:15,690
Vom Vom.

1566
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:23,630
Wear dress.

1567
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:27,590
No!

1568
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,810
But you would be running around so much more freely.

1569
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,110
Less restriction.

1570
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,350
What is a Vom Vom Vom?

1571
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:43,090
Yeah, she just called us poor.

1572
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,270
Check gloves.

1573
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:54,530
Wait, there is something underneath the table.

1574
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,870
We got another ticket.

1575
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:06,770
Low kick?

1576
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:12,970
I think that's everything.

1577
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:14,950
Low kick.

1578
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:19,090
No, no.

1579
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:20,890
Check under table.

1580
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,190
Maybe she can look under.

1581
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:26,590
What?

1582
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,230
Okay, nevermind.

1583
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:33,670
Vom Vom for room.

1584
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,410
Oh my god, you scared me.

1585
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,730
Shoot mouth.

1586
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:44,090
Oh my god!

1587
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:44,870
Dodge!

1588
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:47,510
Shoot mouth.

1589
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,850
Shoot stomach.

1590
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,990
Shoot mouth.

1591
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:56,050
Oh my god, this thing is... Shoot mouth.

1592
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,910
Shoot mouth.

1593
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:01,690
Shoot stomach.

1594
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,410
Nice.

1595
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:10,370
Okay, so the blue ones are stomach.

1596
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:12,430
Other ones are mouth.

1597
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:14,390
No good?

1598
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:15,790
Or no, it's good.

1599
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:20,110
There was a very... I was about to say a pregnant pause.

1600
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:20,810
Goddammit.

1601
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:24,230
I can't say that word anymore around you guys because you get insane.

1602
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:27,430
There was a very...

1603
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,910
Oh my gosh.

1604
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,050
Let's see.

1605
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,350
Check bed.

1606
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:47,670
Maybe CPR the woman.

1607
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,870
Oh, she got a second of the Vom Vom for room's dress.

1608
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:52,190
Check dress.

1609
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:54,770
Dress.

1610
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:57,190
No, no.

1611
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:58,710
Stop.

1612
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:01,770
Bed.

1613
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:08,810
Dress.

1614
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:12,670
Room.

1615
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:18,570
Yeah, she did.

1616
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:21,550
Side table?

1617
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,150
No, the side table.

1618
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:28,970
Nine months of...

1619
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,670
Thanks for nine months.

1620
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,670
Oh wow, corpse.

1621
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:40,890
CPR.

1622
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,550
She didn't even entertain it.

1623
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,850
Check book.

1624
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:02,090
What is it?

1625
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:04,190
It's a catalogue.

1626
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:07,810
It's a Vom Vom for room's spring collection.

1627
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,650
Member catalogue, not for sale.

1628
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:11,530
Read book.

1629
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,290
There's a shiny.

1630
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,130
There's a shiny.

1631
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:16,930
Shiny.

1632
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,330
Shiny.

1633
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,350
What?

1634
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:24,750
Shiny.

1635
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:27,990
What the hell?

1636
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:29,490
I didn't know you were into that.

1637
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,170
Read catalogue.

1638
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:43,990
Listen to this kid.

1639
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,870
What is it?

1640
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,850
What is that?

1641
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:00,970
Code note.

1642
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:01,710
Oh.

1643
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:03,770
I...

1644
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,470
We...

1645
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:06,730
Wait, one, five.

1646
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:07,210
Yeah.

1647
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:10,090
I'm not... I know Roman numerals.

1648
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:10,770
I'm not stupid.

1649
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:12,490
Okay, never mind.

1650
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:18,010
I know it.

1651
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:25,000
When the game out freaks me into bed.

1652
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:29,280
Girl, bed, now.

1653
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:36,180
I sound like I'm from a damn romance novel.

1654
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,280
Like, girl, bed, now.

1655
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,500
Check me out in love and deep space.

1656
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:43,860
Lamp.

1657
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,360
Yeah, I'm talking about the lamp.

1658
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,600
Go to lamp.

1659
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:51,660
Okay, yeah.

1660
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,520
To the lamp.

1661
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,560
Make her boneless.

1662
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,640
Make me just like the aliens.

1663
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,460
Bed.

1664
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,260
Oh.

1665
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,540
She's getting her steps in.

1666
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,260
Maybe, what is that?

1667
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,720
Oh, night stand.

1668
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,080
No.

1669
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,160
Night stand.

1670
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,780
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1671
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,200
Night stand.

1672
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,960
Yes.

1673
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,140
Go to night stand.

1674
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,700
Yes, there is.

1675
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:46,320
You liar.

1676
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,160
There's literally a dress.

1677
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:51,780
Check night stand.

1678
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:52,960
Oh.

1679
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,760
Box.

1680
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:09,520
No.

1681
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:12,860
Phone.

1682
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,200
Yes.

1683
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,140
Let's check the dresser too, but hold on.

1684
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:21,940
Bed.

1685
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:23,860
Yes.

1686
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,840
Phone.

1687
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,160
No, please.

1688
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:34,180
Bed.

1689
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,500
Go to bed, my little kitten.

1690
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,560
What do I call that thing?

1691
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:41,920
What is this thing?

1692
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,200
The thing that's lighting up.

1693
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:44,200
What is that?

1694
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,240
What is that?

1695
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,960
If I say box, she starts to walk.

1696
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,780
White box.

1697
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:58,680
No ma'am.

1698
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,320
White box.

1699
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,820
White box.

1700
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:20,150
White box.

1701
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,840
White.

1702
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,220
Check dresser.

1703
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,300
Oh wait, I forgot that's the actual dresser.

1704
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:44,580
Okay.

1705
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,920
There's a heal capsule.

1706
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:51,460
Yippee.

1707
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:52,080
Energy.

1708
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,580
Oh my gosh, this is literal jelly.

1709
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:56,980
Check mirror.

1710
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:00,640
Okay.

1711
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,540
Red bag.

1712
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,940
It's a Von Von Varom.

1713
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:08,480
I knew it.

1714
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:08,880
I knew it.

1715
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:09,340
I knew it.

1716
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:10,920
Steal.

1717
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,040
She's dead, what is she going to do?

1718
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:18,700
Shoot the mirror?

1719
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,460
You can do that.

1720
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:20,760
Shoot mirror.

1721
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:27,870
Wow.

1722
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:30,510
Loot.

1723
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,150
No, no, no.

1724
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,370
Steal jewelry.

1725
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:41,650
What?

1726
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:44,130
Move bag?

1727
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:49,690
Take bag.

1728
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,330
You said it was cute.

1729
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:56,650
Bed.

1730
01:34:58,330 --> 01:34:58,910
No, no, no.

1731
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,290
Go to the bed.

1732
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,190
Oh god.

1733
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:07,010
Stop.

1734
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:13,490
Why is it when I talk with a sexy voice she doesn't listen to me?

1735
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:15,130
Bed.

1736
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:21,050
I think maybe the game hates sexy men voice.

1737
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,530
It's a Von Von Varom.

1738
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:26,670
We still... I don't know what that thing is you guys.

1739
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:28,370
I don't know what that thing is.

1740
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,190
I have no idea.

1741
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,630
I have no idea what that is.

1742
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,470
Jewelry box.

1743
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:37,710
Oh my god.

1744
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:38,830
What is it?

1745
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:41,050
Safe?

1746
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:43,510
Check safe.

1747
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:50,950
Oh my god.

1748
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:55,550
We can...

1749
01:35:55,550 --> 01:36:00,550
I got you Rio.

1750
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,410
I got you.

1751
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:09,550
It's a Von Von Varom number maybe.

1752
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:12,110
Okay.

1753
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:18,350
What's a Von Von code?

1754
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:20,270
Oh shoot.

1755
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:25,630
What's the dress?

1756
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:28,510
What's the dress?

1757
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:29,070
I don't know.

1758
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:29,830
We are at 2021?

1759
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:30,630
Really?

1760
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:39,970
Thank you.

1761
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:42,290
I wonder what it is.

1762
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:49,310
We got the shutter key.

1763
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,450
Maybe they knew what was going to happen.

1764
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:03,550
Bathroom.

1765
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:05,910
Nice.

1766
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:10,750
I think she likes me guys.

1767
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:11,910
She listens to me a lot.

1768
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:18,650
What the... Shower.

1769
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:24,250
What do you mean by that?

1770
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:25,990
Take a shower.

1771
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,390
Mirror.

1772
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:38,630
Someone said... Wait.

1773
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:40,250
Punch mirror.

1774
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,820
Is there going to be something behind one of these?

1775
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,260
I wonder.

1776
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:49,560
Bottle.

1777
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:52,360
Yeah.

1778
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:53,920
Makeup.

1779
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,740
Check makeup.

1780
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,120
Makeup.

1781
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,620
Take makeup.

1782
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,100
Rio, don't you want to live in luxury?

1783
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:18,100
Don't you want to live in luxury?

1784
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,480
Okay.

1785
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:23,960
Let's go.

1786
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,480
I guess that's it from here.

1787
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:26,880
Save point.

1788
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,860
Use makeup though.

1789
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:34,420
So true.

1790
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,200
That's disgusting.

1791
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:42,490
Bullet count?

1792
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:44,210
Can I run out of bullets in this game?

1793
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:49,210
Does shooting the mirror use bullets?

1794
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,730
Voice recognition average.

1795
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:54,270
Voice recognition best.

1796
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:54,930
Wow.

1797
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:56,210
Number of commands.

1798
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:01,070
Rio is like Dante.

1799
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:02,450
She manifests the bullets.

1800
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:02,710
Okay.

1801
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,390
Alright.

1802
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,850
Let's go.

1803
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:12,590
Yeah, let me ask about the bullets, right?

1804
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,030
Oh wait.

1805
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:14,850
There was another thing.

1806
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:16,030
Low kick.

1807
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:20,990
Low kick.

1808
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:23,550
Stop.

1809
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:29,030
God Rio, I know you want me so bad, but please girl, contain yourself.

1810
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:31,330
There are people watching.

1811
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:36,210
Let's see.

1812
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:37,770
What else do we have?

1813
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:39,550
Oh wait.

1814
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,870
Do you have any friends?

1815
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,350
Stop.

1816
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,610
She's avoiding the question.

1817
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:53,510
Do you have any friends?

1818
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:11,030
I wonder if Naomi is alive.

1819
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:19,350
I wonder if Naomi is alive.

1820
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:24,610
Do you think Naomi is alive?

1821
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:27,150
Stop.

1822
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:29,310
What is the point?

1823
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:30,750
What is the point?

1824
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:35,950
What is the point of our special questions if we can't even... Every single one.

1825
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:38,850
Every single one.

1826
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:42,670
What's the relationship with Gino?

1827
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:46,310
What's the relationship with Gino?

1828
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:49,250
Gino.

1829
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:52,310
Who is Gino?

1830
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:54,710
Click them?

1831
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:55,210
Can I?

1832
01:40:55,670 --> 01:40:55,950
Instead?

1833
01:40:58,830 --> 01:40:59,510
Oh wait.

1834
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:00,910
I think I have to right click them.

1835
01:41:01,290 --> 01:41:02,050
Or not right.

1836
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,590
Square click them.

1837
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:07,090
Nope.

1838
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:09,710
Nothing works.

1839
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:13,550
Oh whoops.

1840
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:15,170
What should we do?

1841
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:18,250
Oh you gotta say consultation first.

1842
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,510
Oh.

1843
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,050
Consultation.

1844
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:27,510
She's so cute.

1845
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,990
Do you have any friends?

1846
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:37,970
Zoom.

1847
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:48,990
She's just like me for real for real.

1848
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:51,850
Consultation.

1849
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:55,830
Consultation.

1850
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:58,630
I wanted to zoom in her face.

1851
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:01,250
I love the dead lady in the background.

1852
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:05,810
I wonder if Naomi is alive.

1853
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,790
You think so?

1854
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:18,650
What are you looking for?

1855
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:24,370
Sorry but I'd like to keep that a secret for now.

1856
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:27,670
Do you trust me?

1857
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:29,990
Damn.

1858
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:32,850
Damn.

1859
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:38,650
What's the relationship with Gino?

1860
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:39,870
Gino and I?

1861
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:41,670
We're just co-workers.

1862
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:44,790
For some reason he's very nice to me.

1863
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:48,450
He tends to be presumptuous and bullish.

1864
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:54,290
For some reason he's really nice to you.

1865
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,450
Let me see.

1866
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:03,770
Who is Helen Johnson?

1867
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:07,960
Okay.

1868
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:10,760
Excited to say that I took my kitty Georgie to the vet today.

1869
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:12,240
Got him all vaxxed up and chipped.

1870
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,440
So he's now officially my fur baby!

1871
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,940
Oh my gosh little Georgie!

1872
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,020
Thank you battle beetle!

1873
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,600
Ask her about Metal Gear.

1874
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,160
What was it?

1875
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:33,420
Oh Helen Joh- Who is Helen Johnson?

1876
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,440
I see.

1877
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,720
I see, I see.

1878
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,140
Is a rescue team coming?

1879
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:56,640
Consultation?

1880
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,400
Do you like my sunglasses?

1881
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,160
Okay that should be everything in here so...

1882
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:02,060
Leave.

1883
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,320
Oh my god I forgot that she does not know the command.

1884
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,760
Leave the room.

1885
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:11,620
Wait what?

1886
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,100
What did she do?

1887
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:16,680
Why is that still shiny?

1888
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,200
Oh because of the code.

1889
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:18,720
Nevermind.

1890
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,800
Go outside.

1891
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,100
Yes.

1892
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,060
Ask her about the Patriots.

1893
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,240
Why are you asking me about the lalilulelo?

1894
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,020
Can you imagine if she said that?

1895
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,440
Zyra!

1896
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,000
Thank you for three months!

1897
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,680
Can't hear you over the clapping of...

1898
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:41,340
Okay.

1899
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:43,980
This is a code na-

1900
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,120
Bugles printed?

1901
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,240
Bugles printed!

1902
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,620
Someone help get my photos printed!

1903
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:01,960
Naomi!

1904
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,100
How do you know?

1905
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,240
Okay.

1906
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,980
She's calling from somewhere.

1907
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:18,660
My girl.

1908
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,760
She's alive!

1909
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:22,420
Guest room 3.

1910
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:25,460
Go to guest room 3.

1911
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:31,420
How do we know that's my girl though?

1912
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,440
How do we know?

1913
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,940
You think Rio can do a flip?

1914
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:39,780
Probably.

1915
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:40,700
She's so cool.

1916
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:44,260
She's a little slow at walking, but you know.

1917
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,540
Oh this game was published and developed by Sony.

1918
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,100
Oh!

1919
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:51,700
And then Konami published it.

1920
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:53,100
I see.

1921
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,240
Alright,

1922
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,280
who are we fighting in here?

1923
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,700
Who's dead or alive?

1924
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,740
Get your guns out.

1925
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,240
Get your guns out!

1926
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:10,640
Ambush!

1927
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,620
Turn around!

1928
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:15,160
What?

1929
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,900
Shoot mouth 3!

1930
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,400
No.

1931
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:24,700
Run away!

1932
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,440
Shoot mouth!

1933
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:32,080
Shoot mouth!

1934
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:35,000
Shoot mouth!

1935
01:46:36,730 --> 01:46:37,760
Shoot mouth!

1936
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,020
Shoot mouth!

1937
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,340
I don't think she's shooting anything.

1938
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:45,760
Shoot mouth!

1939
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:49,140
Run away!

1940
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,100
Shoot mouth!

1941
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:54,380
Why can't she hit?

1942
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,440
Run away!

1943
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,800
Maybe that works.

1944
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,600
She's doing her own dance moves.

1945
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:02,520
Shoot mouth!

1946
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,980
Oh that works too, yeah.

1947
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:07,280
Shoot mouth!

1948
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:08,740
No!

1949
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,020
Shoot mouth!

1950
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,500
Turn right!

1951
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,360
Shoot mouth!

1952
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,380
Shoot mouth.

1953
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,700
Shoot stomach?

1954
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,540
Oh my god.

1955
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,420
What?

1956
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,060
Golly.

1957
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,480
Stop.

1958
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:45,280
I didn't say anything.

1959
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,320
I didn't say anything.

1960
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:48,360
Rio!

1961
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:52,640
Girl, girl, get your hormones in check please.

1962
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,080
Are the Patriots Rio?

1963
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,200
She wants me so bad.

1964
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,780
Oh my gosh.

1965
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,260
Emergency panel.

1966
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,840
She's turning into Sonic the Hedgehog.

1967
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:09,640
Oh!

1968
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,480
It's there.

1969
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:15,140
Oh no.

1970
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:24,160
What is that?

1971
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,720
Yellow thing.

1972
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,040
Shutter key.

1973
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:34,820
Oh.

1974
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,040
Move shutter key.

1975
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:42,440
Ok, but there is a thing underneath.

1976
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:46,780
Yellow.

1977
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,880
Camera check?

1978
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,880
Zoom in.

1979
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,680
Oh damn it.

1980
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:02,040
I wish when I zoomed I could move around.

1981
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,880
Camera check.

1982
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,200
What?

1983
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:09,180
Hold on.

1984
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:10,380
What did we just get?

1985
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,200
I just did that.

1986
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:20,820
Low kick.

1987
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,100
We have to do the low kick.

1988
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:29,790
I guess it's not blinking anymore.

1989
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:32,370
I guess we did it.

1990
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:33,930
Table?

1991
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:38,910
A feast.

1992
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:39,870
Oh my gosh.

1993
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:42,190
Let's go.

1994
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:43,730
Oh no.

1995
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,610
Eat food.

1996
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:52,610
Yeah.

1997
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:55,490
What?

1998
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:56,350
Why not?

1999
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:57,750
9 months already.

2000
01:49:59,310 --> 01:49:59,930
Vladido.

2001
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:02,010
Thank you for the 9 months.

2002
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:04,270
That zoom was a bit off target, Mint.

2003
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:05,670
You'll get it next time.

2004
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:07,810
Drink wine.

2005
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:10,470
No way.

2006
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:12,150
Is she going to do it?

2007
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:17,330
Please Rio.

2008
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:19,130
Please drink wine.

2009
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:24,590
Please drink wine.

2010
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,520
I said please.

2011
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,560
I said please.

2012
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:36,780
Don't BS me Rio.

2013
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,320
I said please.

2014
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:41,480
Check meal.

2015
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,800
Oh my God.

2016
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:54,880
Shoot stomach.

2017
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,560
Shoot head.

2018
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:02,000
Oh my God.

2019
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:02,860
Shoot mouth.

2020
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:05,380
Shoot head.

2021
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:07,820
Shoot stomach.

2022
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,160
Oh my God.

2023
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,740
Shoot head.

2024
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:14,100
Shoot mouth.

2025
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:15,940
Oh my God.

2026
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:16,900
Good job girl.

2027
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:17,820
She runs away.

2028
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,300
I love when she misinterprets me.

2029
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:20,240
Shoot stomach.

2030
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,020
Do the low kick.

2031
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:22,940
Low kick.

2032
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:22,980
Low kick.

2033
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:27,000
Shoot mouth.

2034
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:29,660
Shoot head.

2035
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:32,960
I think it's working.

2036
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:34,440
Low kick.

2037
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:37,020
Shoot mouth.

2038
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,840
Reload.

2039
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,680
Not at the table please.

2040
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:47,820
Run away.

2041
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,980
Shoot mouth.

2042
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:53,200
Oh!

2043
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:55,920
We got him when he jumped.

2044
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:56,400
Nice.

2045
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,540
She's really shooting that table good.

2046
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:02,320
I don't know how to get her to stop shooting the table.

2047
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:04,220
Check table.

2048
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,060
It has so many bullet holes in it now.

2049
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:09,000
Can you imagine?

2050
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:12,900
Wine.

2051
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:15,700
Blue wine.

2052
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:24,160
Heal.

2053
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,280
Check meal.

2054
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:30,580
Yeah.

2055
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,400
A heal capsule.

2056
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,140
Nice.

2057
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,580
Flip table.

2058
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:35,740
For real.

2059
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,620
I think they can eat this still.

2060
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,220
It doesn't look touched at all.

2061
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,580
Blue bottle.

2062
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:45,860
Yes.

2063
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:48,400
Champagne.

2064
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:57,360
How did that work?

2065
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,820
Drink Champagne.

2066
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,340
Why does she understand that?

2067
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:26,000
Why does that work?

2068
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,880
Living area.

2069
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:32,780
I don't understand.

2070
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:36,760
I don't understand why that works.

2071
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,760
Coffee.

2072
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:42,460
There is a coffee.

2073
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:43,920
Ok.

2074
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:44,860
Nevermind.

2075
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:47,300
Save point.

2076
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:47,760
Ok.

2077
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:53,340
This feels like if you had a level 90 Pokemon and one gym badge.

2078
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,380
I'm going to save.

2079
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:56,320
You don't have to tell me.

2080
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,180
You don't have to remind me.

2081
01:53:58,260 --> 01:53:58,520
It's ok.

2082
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:02,300
Ok.

2083
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,720
Yes.

2084
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,340
Joy!

2085
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,240
Thank you for the 50!

2086
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:10,920
Thank you so much!

2087
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,040
Thank you!

2088
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,960
I gotta get more.

2089
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,480
I don't know why my throat is all icky.

2090
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,060
The save point.

2091
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:22,520
Ok.

2092
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:24,560
Yeah.

2093
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:25,800
The save point.

2094
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:26,220
Ok.

2095
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:30,240
What should I tell her to do?

2096
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:32,720
Lie down.

2097
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,880
Lay down.

2098
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,160
That's what I say when I'm really excited for something.

2099
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,560
I'll be sitting.

2100
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,140
Roll over.

2101
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,380
Jump.

2102
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:55,880
Jump.

2103
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:58,360
High five.

2104
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:03,720
Do a sexy pose.

2105
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,560
Do a sexy pose.

2106
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:09,560
Sexy pose.

2107
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:11,340
Sexy.

2108
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,660
Sex?

2109
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,520
Stop!

2110
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,440
Shoot mouth.

2111
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,900
Shoot stomach.

2112
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:31,280
Low kick.

2113
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:33,940
Did that work?

2114
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,200
Shoot stomach.

2115
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,060
Run away.

2116
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,020
Shoot stomach too.

2117
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,400
Oh my god.

2118
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:43,900
Oh my god!

2119
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,540
Kick off!

2120
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,540
What?

2121
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:49,100
Turn...run away.

2122
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:50,540
Ok.

2123
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,660
That works actually.

2124
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:53,120
Run away.

2125
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:55,900
Oh my god.

2126
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:58,020

2127
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,820

2130
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,380
Shoot mouth.

2131
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,140
Shoot stomach.

2132
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,480
Oh my god.

2133
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:17,880
Kick it off.

2134
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:21,240
Oh my god.

2135
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:24,440
Low kick.

2136
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:27,180
Low kick.

2137
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:29,780
Low kick.

2138
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,260
Run away.

2139
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:35,500
Shoot number two.

2140
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:37,360
Number two.

2141
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:38,880
Turn around.

2142
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,900
Oh my god.

2143
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,160
Kick!

2144
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,660
Get it off!

2145
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,140
Low kick.

2146
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,140
Shoot...run away!

2147
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:54,280
Run away.

2148
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:58,160
Shoot mouth.

2149
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:00,600
Shoot stomach.

2150
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:03,880
Shoot head.

2151
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,000
Shoot head.

2152
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:08,000
Shoot mouth.

2153
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,440
Shoot stomach.

2154
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,580
Shoot mouth.

2155
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,240
Shoot mouth.

2156
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,980
Shoot mouth.

2157
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,520
Shoot head.

2158
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:24,320
Shoot stomach.

2159
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:24,920
Ok.

2160
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:28,580
Shoot stomach.

2161
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:30,900
Oh my god.

2162
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:31,940
Shoot stomach.

2163
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:33,660
No.

2164
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:34,380
No.

2165
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,800
Shoot stomach.

2166
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,720
Holy moly.

2167
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:42,920
We wasted the health.

2168
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:44,380
Oh there is one there too.

2169
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Remember you can say dodge.

2170
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:50,880
Nasty.

2171
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:53,340
Ok.

2172
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,480
Good golly.

2173
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,640
Goodness gracious.

2174
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:08,680
I wonder if the rumors are true.

2175
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:12,920
That the game can understand your commands better if you use the Ara Ara voice.

2176
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:14,980
Stormtrooper aim.

2177
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:15,560
I swear.

2178
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,900
I swear to god.

2179
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,440
Check bed.

2180
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,680
That's where our initial...

2181
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:28,980
Oh there is something on the side table.

2182
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:30,620
No?

2183
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:31,560
That's not anything?

2184
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,820
Check dresser.

2185
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:41,600
Under dresser.

2186
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,580
I don't think so.

2187
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:50,060
This is what it feels like to control my TV with my Alexa.

2188
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,420
Check mirror.

2189
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,280
Ok.

2190
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,460
Brown box.

2191
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:05,200
I don't think... I don't think... Cigar case.

2192
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,600
Open cigar case.

2193
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,160
Hashtag Berserker.

2194
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:12,980
Thank you for the 9 months.

2195
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:13,900
What are these chips?

2196
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:15,300
What are they?

2197
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:19,940
Anything else in there?

2198
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:21,420
Check corpse.

2199
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:28,240
Absolute cinema.

2200
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:30,880
Joy!

2201
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:31,740
Thank you for the $50!

2202
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:33,380
Thank you for another $50!

2203
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:34,020
Oh my goodness.

2204
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:34,840
Thank you!

2205
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:36,600
Thank you!

2206
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:39,740
Ok.

2207
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:42,320
Bathroom.

2208
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,040
Sword Master, Custodian of Shakespeare, Royal Guard.

2209
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,120
Pay respects.

2210
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,540
Starting to get hungry guys.

2211
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,280
Wait there really is nothing in here.

2212
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:56,680
Wow.

2213
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:04,890
Is there nothing in here?

2214
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:08,870
Was there anything outside?

2215
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,260
I'm not sure.

2216
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,320
What's the plan for dinner?

2217
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,080
I didn't think I was going to get hungry.

2218
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:24,980
I think I have some more chicken.

2219
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:29,190
Eat.

2220
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:32,230
Check bed.

2221
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:35,470
I want to...

2222
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:36,890
Oh.

2223
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:38,130
Ok.

2224
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,930
Go outside.

2225
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:42,810
Damn.

2226
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:43,670
Ok, nevermind.

2227
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:48,610
I guess we are done here.

2228
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:54,730
We are going to get another Bogo's Binted call.

2229
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:56,750
From maybe Naomi?

2230
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:58,570
Maybe a skinwalker?

2231
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:01,390
That's a great question.

2232
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:03,250
Shutter 3.

2233
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:04,450
Hold on, no.

2234
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:10,770
I want to get to snack.

2235
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:11,290
Is that ok?

2236
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:11,770
Real quick?

2237
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:15,530
You can just listen to her ramble a little bit.

2238
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:16,470
I'm going to go grab a snack.

2239
02:01:16,590 --> 02:01:19,410
I'm starting to feel like I'm going to get shaky all of a sudden.

2240
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:21,190
If I don't eat something.

2241
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:23,810
I usually...

2242
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:25,210
Hey, what the heck?

2243
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:26,850
I'm not immune system.

2244
02:01:26,990 --> 02:01:28,150
My metabolism.

2245
02:01:30,810 --> 02:01:31,610
My metabolism.

2246
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:34,570
It's going nutso today.

2247
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:36,710
Ok, I'll be right back.

2248
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:02,800
Uh...

2249
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:04,580
I need guidance?

2250
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:05,640
Hello?

2251
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:21,890
I guess I've been left to my own devices.

2252
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:44,210
What are you doing?

2253
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:45,830
Bzz.

2254
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:47,110
Time's up.

2255
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:52,230
Oh, where is she going?

2256
02:03:52,810 --> 02:03:53,110
Ma'am?

2257
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:54,090
Hello?

2258
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:54,690
Rio?

2259
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:55,310
What are you doing?

2260
02:03:55,870 --> 02:03:56,190
Rio?

2261
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:57,310
Where is she going?

2262
02:03:57,850 --> 02:03:58,110
Hello?

2263
02:03:58,610 --> 02:03:59,250
What is happening?

2264
02:03:59,350 --> 02:03:59,810
Where is she going?

2265
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:00,610
Rio?

2266
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:01,550
Rio?

2267
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:03,430
Stop?

2268
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:04,170
Yes.

2269
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:08,950
She said time's up.

2270
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:10,970
Time's up and took off.

2271
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:12,170
Hold on.

2272
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:14,630
I'm going to have a brief food intermission.

2273
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:15,590
I'm so sorry you guys.

2274
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:17,110
I started getting so...

2275
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:20,990
I have some fries and chicken that I made earlier.

2276
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:25,790
Hold on.

2277
02:04:26,630 --> 02:04:28,130
I'll even put on some BGM.

2278
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:31,770
So you don't even just hear me chewing everything.

2279
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:43,480
One second.

2280
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:44,800
This one.

2281
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:56,870
Sorry.

2282
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,610
Brief food intermission.

2283
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:03,330
Do you have any sauce?

2284
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:05,690
I didn't get any because I was in a rush.

2285
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:10,090
I wanted to have the chicken with some ranch.

2286
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:11,870
You know?

2287
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:19,190
But it's okay.

2288
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,190
Just to have a little.

2289
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:27,230
It's still yummy without it.

2290
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:33,670
I just really started to feel so hungry.

2291
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:37,030
You want a bite?

2292
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:43,130
Made some gnocchi with chicken and a creamy pesto sauce.

2293
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:45,510
Okay, bragging.

2294
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:47,550
Sounds way better than my...

2295
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:49,110
My sauce-less chicken.

2296
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,320
Am I having fun?

2297
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:55,900
I am!

2298
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:56,840
I'm having so much fun.

2299
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:58,420
Such a silly game.

2300
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:03,340
I'm wondering how long this will take to beat.

2301
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:06,740
I truly can't figure it out at all.

2302
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,770
I wish I could play and eat at the same time.

2303
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:24,390
I think this is trapped on the PS2.

2304
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,860
JLPT results were finally posted yesterday.

2305
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,220
I passed N3!

2306
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:35,940
Congratulations!

2307
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:40,440
Thanks for wishing me good luck back in the end of November.

2308
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:42,200
Congratulations, Paul!

2309
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,140
Beat the game while chewing.

2310
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:50,500
Eating challenge?

2311
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:51,140
Yeah, right?

2312
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:56,570
Oh, sorry.

2313
02:06:58,970 --> 02:07:00,290
There we go.

2314
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,120
I never played Hey You Pikachu.

2315
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:20,720
Some people have brought that up before, but...

2316
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:21,460
What was that for?

2317
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,930
Oh, N64.

2318
02:07:30,630 --> 02:07:31,370
Never had that.

2319
02:07:34,370 --> 02:07:38,250
Did not have... I had a Gameboy growing up, but...

2320
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:39,530
Did not have an N64.

2321
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:48,240
It was basically like...

2322
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,540
You only get one console.

2323
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:52,560
What do you want?

2324
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:54,060
And I said...

2325
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:54,480
PlayStation!

2326
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:02,260
Noki Mindo eating is cute.

2327
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:06,200
Thank you toy!

2328
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:07,560
For the ping.

2329
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:20,790
But then why would I get a PlayStation and not...

2330
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:23,390
Get Metal Gear Solid?

2331
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:24,370
What was wrong with me?

2332
02:08:24,370 --> 02:08:30,820
Have you heard of the official life-sized Gardevoir?

2333
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:32,160
I saw it, yeah.

2334
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:33,860
I did.

2335
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:43,430
I think though because I never had a Nintendo 64, like I never got...

2336
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:47,530
That's why I'm such a bad player at like Mario Kart and stuff.

2337
02:08:47,570 --> 02:08:48,690
I never got to play it.

2338
02:08:49,490 --> 02:08:52,510
The first time I played Mario Kart was just like a couple years ago.

2339
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:56,150
I think...

2340
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:57,890
I guess now...

2341
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:59,110
Almost five years ago.

2342
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:02,030
Because it was...

2343
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:05,770
Because it was when I first started YouTubing.

2344
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:13,250
God's favorite potato, welcome to membership!

2345
02:09:19,970 --> 02:09:21,830
Like I never played Smash.

2346
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:43,450
Okay, I think I'm good enough to continue without...

2347
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:46,140
Without finishing.

2348
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:49,780
We are G2G.

2349
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:54,110
Good to go.

2350
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:56,630
Alright, we're going to...

2351
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:57,990
Why did she go all the way down here?

2352
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:00,370
Shutter 3.

2353
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:04,830
G2G baby.

2354
02:10:07,110 --> 02:10:07,410
Run.

2355
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:13,230
Yeah.

2356
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:17,270
Six years old, I wanted hot wheels.

2357
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:20,430
My older brother convinced me to ask for an N64 at Christmas instead.

2358
02:10:20,430 --> 02:10:21,410
Smart brother.

2359
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:25,490
Alright, be prepared.

2360
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:30,270
I'm doing it.

2361
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:37,190
Ugly.

2362
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:41,050
Shoot, middle eye.

2363
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:43,590
Back up.

2364
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:46,130
Shoot, left eye.

2365
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:48,190
Nice.

2366
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:49,970
Shoot, red eye.

2367
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:52,890
Shoot, red eye.

2368
02:10:56,610 --> 02:10:58,010
What's wrong with you?

2369
02:10:58,410 --> 02:10:59,670
Shoot, red eye.

2370
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:13,010
Nice flip.

2371
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:14,930
That was the most...

2372
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:17,070
That was so dramatic, Ryo, for what?

2373
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:30,020
That's right, it has a voice thing, right?

2374
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:35,380
Honeymoon mode?

2375
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:46,820
Oh yeah.

2376
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,880
Ride.

2377
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:00,940
Say it, say it Ryo.

2378
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:05,300
What?

2379
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,160
What?

2380
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:21,960
What do I say?

2381
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:36,830
She didn't give it to me!

2382
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:42,630
Wait!

2383
02:12:43,170 --> 02:12:49,170
You didn't give it to me!

2384
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:54,550
How was I supposed to know that wouldn't work?

2385
02:12:58,390 --> 02:13:00,050
Guest room 4.

2386
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:04,070
Oh that works, whatever.

2387
02:13:05,130 --> 02:13:06,570
Oh my god!

2388
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:10,530
How was I supposed to know?

2389
02:13:11,850 --> 02:13:13,030
What's down that hallway?

2390
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:16,010
Shutter 2.

2391
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:17,350
Infirmary.

2392
02:13:18,630 --> 02:13:19,750
Equipment room.

2393
02:13:19,990 --> 02:13:22,350
Guest room 4.

2394
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:24,790
Okay.

2395
02:13:33,650 --> 02:13:34,410
Unlock.

2396
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:37,840
You're welcome.

2397
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:44,090
I can't believe that we would get rejected like this.

2398
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:45,550
On our honeymoon.

2399
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,620
This room is empty.

2400
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,320
It's not empty!

2401
02:13:58,940 --> 02:13:59,440
Dodge!

2402
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,380
Shoot tongue!

2403
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:04,700
Shoot tongue!

2404
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:07,120
Shoot tongue!

2405
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:10,300
Shoot front limb!

2406
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:12,240
That works too.

2407
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:13,880
Shoot inner mouth!

2408
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:16,440
Oh my god.

2409
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:17,900
Shoot inner mouth!

2410
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,360
Oh my god, we're gonna die.

2411
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:20,220
Leave!

2412
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:21,840
No, no, no.

2413
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:22,480
Leave room.

2414
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:23,940
No, no, no, no, no.

2415
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,400
Go outside!

2416
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,680
Go outside!

2417
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:32,320
Low kick!

2418
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:33,880
Oh my god.

2419
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:34,460
Leave!

2420
02:14:49,930 --> 02:14:53,290
I didn't save until like a while, a while ago.

2421
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:02,470
Suddenly hand monsters.

2422
02:15:02,590 --> 02:15:04,190
And there is three things in there!

2423
02:15:04,910 --> 02:15:06,850
Oh my gosh.

2424
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:09,390
Okay.

2425
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:11,370
Alright.

2426
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:13,090
Go outside.

2427
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:19,870
Maybe this time though we can...

2428
02:15:20,910 --> 02:15:25,470
We can actually not take any damage from this stupid guy over here.

2429
02:15:28,530 --> 02:15:33,650
I didn't want to heal because people said try not to heal so much.

2430
02:15:35,570 --> 02:15:36,470
What's it called?

2431
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:37,170
Shutter 3.

2432
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:38,750
Shutter 3.

2433
02:15:44,430 --> 02:15:46,850
Rio 3 will be the best one for sure.

2434
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:50,310
This is the best timeline.

2435
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:51,230
This

2436
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:58,990
will open that shutter.

2437
02:16:02,210 --> 02:16:04,010
Hurry up and analyze.

2438
02:16:07,150 --> 02:16:08,410
Got it.

2439
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:18,630
Shoot right eye!

2440
02:16:19,490 --> 02:16:21,150
Run away!

2441
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:26,030
Shoot left eye!

2442
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:27,970
Oh dang it.

2443
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:29,130
Shoot left eye!

2444
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,130
Nice.

2445
02:16:31,130 --> 02:16:32,590
Shoot middle eye!

2446
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:34,450
Nice.

2447
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:35,950
Shoot left eye!

2448
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:37,870
Nice.

2449
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:39,290
Shoot red eye!

2450
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:51,600
We're good.

2451
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:56,660
Guys I won't fumble it this time.

2452
02:16:59,060 --> 02:17:00,700
Guys I won't fumble this time.

2453
02:17:13,380 --> 02:17:14,340
Honeymoon mode?

2454
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:19,660
What would do something to riz her?

2455
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:23,700
What would be something?

2456
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:30,640
Ride?

2457
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:34,080
In this case I guess it's me.

2458
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:44,480
It's my turn.

2459
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:52,680
That must be me.

2460
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:53,120
Ok.

2461
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,580
Hold on.

2462
02:17:56,660 --> 02:17:57,260
I gotta take a sippy.

2463
02:18:10,470 --> 02:18:12,870
Another voice.

2464
02:18:15,810 --> 02:18:16,710
Another voice.

2465
02:18:16,710 --> 02:18:21,590
In order to undo the lock to the sun suite I guess we need another piece of the voice password.

2466
02:18:24,890 --> 02:18:26,170
Where should I start looking?

2467
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:37,350
It didn't even give me a chance!

2468
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:42,770
Ok, let's go back to room 3 and we'll save now.

2469
02:18:43,670 --> 02:18:45,650
Go to guest room 3.

2470
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:48,830
I went down the wrong pipe.

2471
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:50,210
Wrong pipe.

2472
02:18:55,230 --> 02:18:57,150
You didn't take the chance.

2473
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:01,290
Red.

2474
02:19:07,810 --> 02:19:09,050
We'll save in here.

2475
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:18,510
We'll save in here and then go to the next room and hopefully not die.

2476
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:24,850
Save panel.

2477
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:27,650
No!

2478
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:29,730
Oh, save point.

2479
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:36,640
Did we open the door in this room?

2480
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:40,200
Yeah, because this is the dinner room.

2481
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:42,160
And there's a guy dead in there.

2482
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:43,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2483
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:45,860
Oh, oh, oh.

2484
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:51,040
Ok, nice.

2485
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:52,260
Let's go!

2486
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:59,840
Check the living area and the cigar box again.

2487
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,800
Someone said something about the code being there.

2488
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:04,900
And the cigar box?

2489
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:07,760
Stand up.

2490
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:11,960
Bedroom?

2491
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,140
In the cigar box?

2492
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:21,560
Oh, god!

2493
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,320
What?

2494
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:24,900
Shoot mouth!

2495
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:27,900
Shoot mouth!

2496
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:37,050
Shoot mouth!

2497
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:41,650
Shoot mouth.

2498
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:44,290
Shoot mouth.

2499
02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:46,310
Low kick.

2500
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:49,090
Shoot mouth.

2501
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:51,570
Oh, shoot head.

2502
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:52,510
Oh my god.

2503
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:54,130
Shoot head.

2504
02:20:56,110 --> 02:20:57,490
Shoot mouth.

2505
02:20:58,910 --> 02:20:59,910
Shoot mouth.

2506
02:21:01,050 --> 02:21:02,210
Low kick.

2507
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:06,750
Die, Rio.

2508
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:08,350
Die.

2509
02:21:09,310 --> 02:21:10,650
It's your turn to die.

2510
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:19,730
Why did you use the heal, Rio?

2511
02:21:22,530 --> 02:21:23,030
Rio!

2512
02:21:34,770 --> 02:21:35,770
Persona!

2513
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:42,190
It's not attacking me at all.

2514
02:21:45,210 --> 02:21:47,890
I want to...I want to reload.

2515
02:21:47,890 --> 02:21:48,190
Oh,

2516
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:53,810
here we go.

2517
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:07,840
Rio, this is what you get for healing instead of shooting like I told you.

2518
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:11,060
07 Rio 3.

2519
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:22,400
In the bedroom!

2520
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:26,720
Alright.

2521
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:30,280
That one I don't think counts because...

2522
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:32,900
I don't think that counts.

2523
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:35,080
IMHO.

2524
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:38,600
Don't count that as a death.

2525
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:43,420
Why did the monsters respawn?

2526
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:46,160
There better be something actually in that.

2527
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:52,560
There better actually be something in the cigar box, you guys.

2528
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:56,160
If I'm getting one guide, I swear to...I swear.

2529
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:02,340
I think the prior save was before we opened this door.

2530
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:03,180
Yeah, exactly.

2531
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,180
Stand up.

2532
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:12,420
You never went in there after reloading.

2533
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:14,400
I didn't?

2534
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:18,720
Really?

2535
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:27,500
Bedroom.

2536
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:29,440
Oh!

2537
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,900
Oh wait, really?

2538
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:33,300
Oh my goodness.

2539
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:37,440
Well then we needed to go in here anyway.

2540
02:23:39,340 --> 02:23:40,420
Run away!

2541
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:43,680
Oh, run away!

2542
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:46,360

2543
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:48,540
Run away!

2544
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:51,220
Shoot mouse!

2545
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:53,800
Shoot...run away!

2546
02:23:55,400 --> 02:23:55,760
Run!

2547
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:58,420
Run away!

2548
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:00,260
Run away!

2549
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:11,310
Stand up!

2550
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:14,250
Oh my god, shoot head!

2551
02:24:16,150 --> 02:24:16,950
Shoot mouth!

2552
02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:19,010
Shoot stomach!

2553
02:24:24,050 --> 02:24:26,070
Oh, I can't!

2554
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:28,070
I can't deal with this!

2555
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,160
Oh my god.

2556
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:42,580
The other one is trying to get a suck, but it can't get in.

2557
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:51,260
Ok, I'm not trying to do like a perfect run or anything, but sheesh!

2558
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:56,500
Just listen to what I have to say, please!

2559
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:56,920
It's real!

2560
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:03,160
Ok.

2561
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:04,560
Ok.

2562
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:05,740

2563
02:25:17,730 --> 02:25:19,050
Stand up.

2564
02:25:20,890 --> 02:25:21,650
Bedroom.

2565
02:25:24,890 --> 02:25:25,130
Ok.

2566
02:25:25,810 --> 02:25:26,310
Ok.

2567
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:31,870
I can't figure out which is best for like these other colors either.

2568
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:33,950
Low kick!

2569
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:37,650
Shoot mouth!

2570
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:40,030

Run away!

2578
02:25:58,590 --> 02:25:59,590
There we go.

2579
02:25:59,670 --> 02:25:59,810

Just to make sure, you know.

2663

They are going to notice now that there is a bullet in him.

2664
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:12,000
Shoot mirror.

2665

02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:21,240

2670
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:42,820
Save panel.

2671
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:46,920

2672
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:49,080

2673
02:30:50,620 --> 02:30:51,060
Stop.

2674
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:52,540

2675
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:55,020
Save point.

2676
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:56,680
Okay.

2677
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:16,420
You guys one guide me.

2678
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,560
How could you?

2679
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:20,800
How could you?

2680
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:29,340
Stand up.

2681
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:30,200
Okay.

2682
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,280
I don't think there was anything else.

2683
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:38,840
Actually, check bed.

2684
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:42,180
I don't remember if there was anything here before.

2685
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,140
For anyone who came in, we had died.

2686
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:51,960
And I forgot to recheck this room.

2687
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:54,280
But somebody said that there was a...

2688
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:58,360
That there was a code to the other door in here, but they were wrong.

2689
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:04,280
Senar, thank you for the 10 gifts.

2690
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:05,160
Thank you.

2691
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:08,220
Okay, so...

2692
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:09,520
Go outside.

2693
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:22,220
Hope not spam, try saying the target then shoot.

2694
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:24,040
But I don't know, I really...

2695
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:27,560
So do I say shoot number one or do I say number one shoot?

2696
02:32:28,120 --> 02:32:29,680
Like I don't know though, I don't remember...

2697
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:30,300
I don't think I'm...

2698
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:31,680
Hold on, let me see.

2699
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,240
Like it's the...

2700
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:36,200
It's the order of operations that is confusing me.

2701
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:38,340
Cause it's like, do I say...

2702
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:40,660
Shoot one...

2703
02:32:40,660 --> 02:32:41,740
Number one head?

2704
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:43,560
Or do I say...

2705
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:44,560
Shoot number...

2706
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:46,560
Do I say...

2707
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:50,140
Number two shoot head or head shoot?

2708
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:50,840
I don't know.

2709
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,280
You can just say a body part.

2710
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:55,780
Yeah, but someone is saying...

2711
02:32:55,780 --> 02:32:57,000
Tell me to shoot...

2712
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,560
Or someone is saying to...

2713
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:00,720
Oh my gosh, real.

2714
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:02,560
Someone is saying to...

2715
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:05,560
Do...

2716
02:33:08,140 --> 02:33:10,380
The target, say what target it is.

2717
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:13,300
Oh my gosh, these are the items I have.

2718
02:33:18,220 --> 02:33:22,420
Oh my gosh, wait.

2719
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:23,740
The chips, the chips.

2720
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:25,000
What are the chips?

2721
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:26,840
Portable...

2722
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:27,300
Wait, no.

2723
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:30,160
A trendy and popular collectible item.

2724
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:32,660
Something happens every time four chips are collected.

2725
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:33,980
Well, I have four.

2726
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:36,460
So...

2727
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:37,680
What happened?

2728
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:39,740
Nothing.

2729
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,180
Okay, anyway.

2730
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:46,420
Guess...

2731
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:48,440
No, hold on.

2732
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:49,460
It's the order.

2733
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:50,960
Say shoot after the target.

2734
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:52,740
Okay.

2735
02:33:54,940 --> 02:33:55,560

2736
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,060

2739
02:34:03,460 --> 02:34:04,120
Stop.

2740
02:34:06,760 --> 02:34:10,420
Run to guest room four.

2741
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:18,760
Okay.

2742
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:31,740
Okay, this one is hard.

2743
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:33,940
This room is scary.

2744
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:35,960
Alright.

2745
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:37,900

Wait, you can...

2749
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:49,780
Oh gosh, everybody is telling me different things.

2750
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:51,240
It's confusing me.

2751
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:56,220

02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:18,780
Oh wow!

2864
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:22,300
Is that the groom?

2865
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:23,640
Bottle?

2866
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:26,240
Nevermind.

2867
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:30,620
Living area.

2868
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:33,280
Are those bullets?

2869
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:34,180
What is that?

2870
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:36,240
What is this?

2871
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:43,140
I don't... Check body.

2872
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:45,540
Well fought, Minda.

2873
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:49,080
The voices.

2874
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:51,220
What do you mean?

2875
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:53,760
Behind the couch.

2876
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:55,380
Yes.

2877
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:57,920
Oh.

2878
02:39:59,380 --> 02:40:00,560
This person is dead.

2879
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:04,220
He was hiding here.

2880
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:06,080
In hopes of finding protection.

2881
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:11,820
Voice password.

2882
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:14,000
We got the second voice.

2883
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:14,980
Now we can get into the sun suite.

2884
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:15,760
Yes.

2885
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:19,220
Okay.

2886
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:19,860
Let's go.

2887
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:21,060
No, no, no.

2888
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:22,120
There is so much to do.

2889
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,320
What the hell?

2890
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:27,300
Check chair.

2891
02:40:29,900 --> 02:40:31,360
What are you talking about?

2892
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,220
There is no save point in here.

2893
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:34,580
Check chair.

2894
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:38,040
Helmet?

2895
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:42,700
Maybe wear it.

2896
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:45,700
Wear helmet.

2897
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:51,360
Girl, your priorities are real!

2898
02:40:59,050 --> 02:40:59,810
Sword?

2899
02:41:01,210 --> 02:41:02,310
Yeah, what is that?

2900
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:05,170
Check steel pipe.

2901
02:41:07,590 --> 02:41:08,450
Weapon.

2902
02:41:09,490 --> 02:41:10,710
Take steel pipe.

2903
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:13,830
Girl, what?

2904
02:41:14,390 --> 02:41:15,590
You can have other weapons.

2905
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:16,990
No!

2906
02:41:17,630 --> 02:41:18,550
Bullets?

2907
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:20,730
No!

2908
02:41:21,970 --> 02:41:22,890
Stop.

2909
02:41:24,930 --> 02:41:26,230
Check living area.

2910
02:41:27,230 --> 02:41:29,050
Oh, I see a health pack too.

2911
02:41:31,370 --> 02:41:32,710
I see a health pack.

2912
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:33,470
What are those?

2913
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:34,190
Are they bullets?

2914
02:41:34,330 --> 02:41:34,930
What are they?

2915
02:41:35,890 --> 02:41:36,850
Green box.

2916
02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:39,090
Yes.

2917
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:41,510
It is...

2918
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:43,330
Everybody, place your bets.

2919
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:44,510
What do you think this is?

2920
02:41:46,370 --> 02:41:46,850
It's...

2921
02:41:46,850 --> 02:41:47,750
Rations?

2922
02:41:48,770 --> 02:41:49,730
Check rations.

2923
02:41:56,970 --> 02:41:59,010
Move rations.

2924
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:03,830
Metal gear.

2925
02:42:06,230 --> 02:42:07,750
Eat rations.

2926
02:42:10,070 --> 02:42:12,410
But there is a heal right above...

2927
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:13,450
Check rations.

2928
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:16,710
No, but...

2929
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:17,730
Shiny!

2930
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:21,830
Check bottle?

2931
02:42:23,350 --> 02:42:24,730
Oh...

2932
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:26,050
Stop, stop.

2933
02:42:26,770 --> 02:42:27,170
Stop.

2934
02:42:28,090 --> 02:42:30,110
Living area.

2935
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:42,470
Check under ration.

2936
02:42:45,210 --> 02:42:47,210
Check under ration.

2937
02:42:48,130 --> 02:42:50,150
Oh my god, finally.

2938
02:42:58,670 --> 02:43:00,870
Don't act like you made that discovery Rio.

2939
02:43:01,130 --> 02:43:03,190
Don't act like you are the one who did that.

2940
02:43:04,910 --> 02:43:06,230
Don't act like it.

2941
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:10,590
Emergency panel.

2942
02:43:13,270 --> 02:43:15,070
The save point is in the bedroom?

2943
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:16,430
This is so messed up.

2944
02:43:18,850 --> 02:43:21,050
But the battle was so hard in this room.

2945
02:43:24,490 --> 02:43:26,270
We can't use this anymore.

2946
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:27,910
This one is broken too?

2947
02:43:30,890 --> 02:43:33,350
Do you guys think I should go in there?

2948
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:36,030
Without saving?

2949
02:43:36,770 --> 02:43:37,210
Bedroom.

2950
02:43:38,130 --> 02:43:39,250
Here we go.

2951
02:43:41,010 --> 02:43:43,590
Oh, nevermind.

2952
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:44,590
It's normal.

2953
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:45,990
Save point.

2954
02:43:47,570 --> 02:43:48,570
Okay, that's fine.

2955
02:43:49,110 --> 02:43:49,690
It's fine.

2956
02:43:50,430 --> 02:43:51,090
It's fine.

2957
02:43:51,410 --> 02:43:52,150
Everything is fine.

2958
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:54,590
Blanket.

2959
02:43:58,970 --> 02:43:59,810
White.

2960
02:44:06,210 --> 02:44:08,230
Please don't edit my face.

2961
02:44:08,870 --> 02:44:11,090
I can't imagine you guys.

2962
02:44:12,570 --> 02:44:14,950
I can already see you guys.

2963
02:44:16,130 --> 02:44:17,490
Editing my face.

2964
02:44:17,490 --> 02:44:18,770
On to the

2965
02:44:30,410 --> 02:44:32,130
thing that...

2966
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:36,110
Projector.

2967
02:44:38,350 --> 02:44:39,070
That's what I said.

2968
02:44:47,530 --> 02:44:48,750
Don't do it.

2969
02:44:49,690 --> 02:44:50,910
Space station.

2970
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:54,870
The Bloor map?

2971
02:44:55,130 --> 02:44:55,990
What did she say?

2972
02:44:56,730 --> 02:44:57,830
It's the Bloor map.

2973
02:44:59,130 --> 02:45:02,950
You're in the monitor room.

2974
02:45:03,470 --> 02:45:05,490
It's pretty far from the hotel section.

2975
02:45:07,230 --> 02:45:07,890
And...

2976
02:45:07,890 --> 02:45:09,130
How did she say that?

2977
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:11,570
That's the receiving port.

2978
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:16,750
If Gina's story is true, the rescue team will be arriving here.

2979
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:19,410
We're close.

2980
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:23,110
Paper.

2981
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:25,570
Paper?

2982
02:45:26,830 --> 02:45:28,470
There are papers all over.

2983
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:29,310
Which one do you mean?

2984
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:33,830
Have you guys ever seen that bird that like...

2985
02:45:33,830 --> 02:45:36,130
They'll give him something and they'll be like, what's this?

2986
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:38,050
And Apollo will be like, Apollo, what's this?

2987
02:45:38,090 --> 02:45:39,030
And he'll go, metal.

2988
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:41,270
Or he'll go, paper.

2989
02:45:41,850 --> 02:45:43,170
Or he'll go, glass.

2990
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:44,090
That's how I feel.

2991
02:45:44,630 --> 02:45:46,590
I'm just saying, paper.

2992
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:50,610
Shrug.

2993
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:54,230
Check green paper.

2994
02:45:55,670 --> 02:45:57,070
Yes.

2995
02:45:57,190 --> 02:45:57,410
No.

2996
02:45:58,510 --> 02:45:59,310
Questionnaire.

2997
02:45:59,770 --> 02:46:00,830
Read questionnaire.

2998
02:46:12,750 --> 02:46:16,150
Those are some big words.

2999
02:46:17,010 --> 02:46:18,630
Check blue.

3000
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:27,730
We let her do what she wants to do.

3001
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:30,210
Zoom.

3002
02:46:30,890 --> 02:46:31,370
Zoom.

3003
02:46:31,550 --> 02:46:31,710
No.

3004
02:46:32,910 --> 02:46:33,930
What?

3005
02:46:34,610 --> 02:46:35,170
Yes.

3006
02:46:36,290 --> 02:46:36,830
Bed.

3007
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:43,150
There's another chip.

3008
02:46:45,230 --> 02:46:45,850
She's zooming.

3009
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:51,790
Check table.

3010
02:46:52,570 --> 02:46:54,150
What is the blue thing?

3011
02:46:54,450 --> 02:46:55,550
What should I say?

3012
02:46:58,170 --> 02:47:02,550
This game feels like Minto roleplaying as chat backseating the other VTuber.

3013
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:03,310
Oh, blueprint?

3014
02:47:04,230 --> 02:47:04,770
Blueprint.

3015
02:47:07,450 --> 02:47:08,450
Oh, I thought it was a blanket.

3016
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:14,470
I thought it was a blanket.

3017
02:47:14,990 --> 02:47:16,150
Manager check completed.

3018
02:47:18,510 --> 02:47:22,570
Please let us know how you feel about our hotel, including suggestions and requests.

3019
02:47:22,910 --> 02:47:26,170
We will use your feedback so that we may serve you better in the future.

3020
02:47:27,150 --> 02:47:28,150
She's comfy brained.

3021
02:47:28,330 --> 02:47:28,810
So true.

3022
02:47:32,110 --> 02:47:32,630
Dresser.

3023
02:47:33,550 --> 02:47:34,070

3024
02:47:34,590 --> 02:47:35,230

Steal money.

3031
02:47:59,930 --> 02:48:02,290
After you steal the money maybe.

3032
02:48:02,790 --> 02:48:03,190
Dresser.

3033
02:48:05,630 --> 02:48:06,770
Do what with what?

3034
02:48:07,470 --> 02:48:08,210
Take money.

3035
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:12,510
Read invitation.

3036
02:48:22,370 --> 02:48:25,310
Got the meowy hands.

3037
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:40,170
Look under invitation.

3038
02:48:44,150 --> 02:48:44,610
I know.

3039
02:48:46,150 --> 02:48:47,550
No, but the thing on the back.

3040
02:48:48,430 --> 02:48:50,350
Oh, how do I say that?

3041
02:48:51,530 --> 02:48:52,630
Under invitation.

3042
02:48:55,550 --> 02:48:55,890
What?

3043
02:48:59,090 --> 02:49:01,790
Why are you so violent, Rio?

3044
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:02,950
Chill out.

3045
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:05,350
Turn over invitation.

3046
02:49:09,850 --> 02:49:11,210
Flip invitation.

3047
02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:15,750
I know.

3048
02:49:18,330 --> 02:49:19,770
I don't know how to get her.

3049
02:49:20,150 --> 02:49:20,410
Flip.

3050
02:49:22,010 --> 02:49:22,750

02:49:23,330 --> 02:49:24,270
Check invitation.

3052
02:49:28,230 --> 02:49:29,190
I've tried behind.

3053
02:49:29,570 --> 02:49:30,390
I've tried it.

3054
02:49:30,650 --> 02:49:31,390
I'll try again.

3055
02:49:32,230 --> 02:49:33,550
Behind invitation.

3056
02:49:36,610 --> 02:49:37,630
Oh my god.

3057
02:49:37,630 --> 02:49:39,970
Oh my god.

3058
02:49:39,970 --> 02:49:41,730
This is not hot dog moment.

3059
02:49:43,070 --> 02:49:44,970
Turn over invitation.

3060
02:49:52,430 --> 02:49:54,850
Check back of invitation.

3061
02:49:58,270 --> 02:49:58,770
Oh my god.

3062
02:49:59,510 --> 02:49:59,990
Yes.

3063
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:03,270
What did we get?

3064
02:50:07,810 --> 02:50:10,910
Oh no, do I get to play a game with her?

3065
02:50:13,070 --> 02:50:14,350
Check mirror.

3066
02:50:18,350 --> 02:50:21,570
Rio, your confidence.

3067
02:50:22,430 --> 02:50:22,830
Wow.

3068
02:50:23,410 --> 02:50:24,590
Holy moly.

3069
02:50:25,490 --> 02:50:26,630
Okay, check bed.

3070
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:30,810
By the bed.

3071
02:50:30,810 --> 02:50:32,510
By the bed.

3072
02:50:39,410 --> 02:50:40,650
Don't leave yet.

3073
02:50:40,770 --> 02:50:41,250
Don't leave yet.

3074
02:50:41,850 --> 02:50:42,910
Save point.

3075
02:50:49,350 --> 02:50:50,170
Nice.

3076
02:50:50,810 --> 02:50:52,290
So confident, yet so dumb.

3077
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:56,410
Oh my goodness.

3078
02:50:56,610 --> 02:50:56,670
Okay.

3079
02:50:59,010 --> 02:50:59,830
Yippee!

3080
02:50:59,830 --> 02:51:00,250
Yippee!

3081
02:51:04,850 --> 02:51:05,850
Let's go.

3082
02:51:10,490 --> 02:51:12,250
Is this Rio 5 or 6?

3083
02:51:13,190 --> 02:51:14,330
6, I think.

3084
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:15,550
Alright.

3085
02:51:16,770 --> 02:51:18,850
I think we did get everything in here.

3086
02:51:19,470 --> 02:51:20,790
I did check the emergency panel.

3087
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:21,830
It was broken.

3088
02:51:22,810 --> 02:51:23,910
I checked the table.

3089
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:24,930
Okay.

3090
02:51:25,850 --> 02:51:26,570
Go outside.

3091
02:51:30,310 --> 02:51:30,650
Yep.

3092
02:51:31,190 --> 02:51:31,630
Good girl.

3093
02:51:34,010 --> 02:51:35,110
Good girl.

3094
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:40,950
I want to see her do the sexy pose.

3095
02:51:41,230 --> 02:51:42,330
We still haven't seen that.

3096
02:51:43,870 --> 02:51:45,530
I'll ask her when she leaves here.

3097
02:51:46,850 --> 02:51:47,770
Oh wait, we might get up.

3098
02:51:49,050 --> 02:51:51,430
Oh, I can't talk.

3099
02:51:51,850 --> 02:51:52,630
Sexy pose.

3100
02:51:54,230 --> 02:51:55,950
Do a sexy pose.

3101
02:51:57,530 --> 02:51:59,770
Sexy pose for me, little lady.

3102
02:52:00,670 --> 02:52:01,410
Little lady.

3103
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:01,970
Break?

3104
02:52:04,750 --> 02:52:06,550
Give me something to break!

3105
02:52:08,110 --> 02:52:08,670
Pose.

3106
02:52:14,730 --> 02:52:15,850
Yes, girl!

3107
02:52:16,070 --> 02:52:16,630
Pyrobug!

3108
02:52:17,650 --> 02:52:18,850
Thank you for the birthday gift!

3109
02:52:19,390 --> 02:52:20,190
Thank you!

3110
02:52:20,930 --> 02:52:21,950
Thank you so much!

3111
02:52:23,150 --> 02:52:24,990
Alright, we are going to the sun suite.

3112
02:52:25,930 --> 02:52:27,970
We get to save my part of the ladder guys.

3113
02:52:27,990 --> 02:52:28,430
Let's go.

3114
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:31,690
Run to sun suite.

3115
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:43,010
Honeymoon mode?

3116
02:52:44,550 --> 02:52:46,210
This would be so embarrassing.

3117
02:52:46,790 --> 02:52:48,230
Just give me a key.

3118
02:52:49,410 --> 02:52:50,610
Just give me a key.

3119
02:52:50,610 --> 02:52:55,510
Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.

3120
02:52:57,330 --> 02:52:58,770
Authentication successful.

3121
02:52:59,710 --> 02:53:02,870
The groom may now read the second portion.

3122
02:53:04,450 --> 02:53:06,630
Luckily I have no blood to spike.

3123
02:53:09,570 --> 02:53:10,030
Oh my god.

3124
02:53:13,790 --> 02:53:14,510
Second...

3125
02:53:14,510 --> 02:53:16,730
A document with the ocean.

3126
02:53:19,210 --> 02:53:20,930
Authentication unsuccessful.

3127
02:53:21,870 --> 02:53:24,070
Will the groom please read clearly?

3128
02:53:28,150 --> 02:53:30,210
I want to monopolize.

3129
02:53:31,710 --> 02:53:33,350
Authentication successful.

3130
02:53:35,910 --> 02:53:37,090
So far so good.

3131
02:53:38,230 --> 02:53:39,650
You may both enter.

3132
02:53:40,410 --> 02:53:41,850
How is that romantic?

3133
02:53:42,050 --> 02:53:43,150
What does that even mean?

3134
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:46,130
I'm literally just saying I want to play Monop...

3135
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:48,510
Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.

3136
02:53:49,190 --> 02:53:51,510
I want to monopolize.

3137
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:54,550
Authentication unsuccessful.

3138
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:55,290
What?

3139
02:53:55,770 --> 02:53:58,930
Will the groom please face the bride while reading?

3140
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:04,250
In case you forgot, we also have to say both lines of the poem at the same time.

3141
02:54:04,630 --> 02:54:05,210
Oh ok.

3142
02:54:06,030 --> 02:54:07,130
One more time.

3143
02:54:08,130 --> 02:54:08,690
Oh shoot.

3144
02:54:09,010 --> 02:54:11,610
The bride may now read the first portion.

3145
02:54:13,150 --> 02:54:13,670
What?

3146
02:54:15,390 --> 02:54:17,870
Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.

3147
02:54:19,450 --> 02:54:21,070
Authentication successful.

3148
02:54:21,910 --> 02:54:25,270
The groom may now read the second portion.

3149
02:54:25,430 --> 02:54:25,630
Ok.

3150
02:54:26,330 --> 02:54:27,730
It's talking about you.

3151
02:54:27,950 --> 02:54:28,170
Me.

3152
02:54:28,930 --> 02:54:29,630
Ok.

3153
02:54:30,750 --> 02:54:33,510
I want to monopolize.

3154
02:54:35,190 --> 02:54:36,850
Authentication successful.

3155
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:41,610
You may both enter.

3156
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:43,970
We got it!

3157
02:54:44,470 --> 02:54:44,610
Ready?

3158
02:54:46,010 --> 02:54:46,530
What am I doing?

3159
02:54:47,350 --> 02:54:49,890
Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.

3160
02:54:50,670 --> 02:54:51,950
I want to monopolize.

3162
02:54:56,530 --> 02:54:59,510
Will the groom please face the bride while reading?

3163
02:55:00,850 --> 02:55:02,770
Look, it's pretty weird for me too.

3164
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:08,470
Ok, we'll try it one more time.

3165
02:55:08,710 --> 02:55:11,230
The bride may now read the first portion.

3166
02:55:11,230 --> 02:55:12,590
Hello, Nihimi!

3167
02:55:13,470 --> 02:55:14,990
Hi, I hope you had fun with the Sims!

3168
02:55:15,850 --> 02:55:17,190
I saw that come to Steam too.

3169
02:55:17,270 --> 02:55:17,990
I was so excited.

3170
02:55:18,210 --> 02:55:18,690
Oh my gosh.

3171
02:55:19,310 --> 02:55:21,510
I'm sorry, I'm having to read this with my bride.

3172
02:55:26,150 --> 02:55:27,330
It's talking about you.

3173
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:32,530
I want to monopolize.

3174
02:55:35,030 --> 02:55:35,750
Authentication successful.

3175
02:55:35,790 --> 02:55:37,550
Ok, now we have to say it at the same time.

3176
02:55:37,630 --> 02:55:38,330
Hi Naphlings!

3177
02:55:39,130 --> 02:55:40,590
You may both enter.

3178
02:55:42,230 --> 02:55:43,110
Here we go.

3179
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:43,610
Ready?

3180
02:55:45,930 --> 02:55:49,110
Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.

3181
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:50,990
I want to monopolize.

3182
02:55:52,910 --> 02:55:54,190
Authentication successful.

3183
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:55,130
Oh my god!

3184
02:55:58,570 --> 02:56:01,230
I said sunlight, I think I did it.

3185
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:02,410
We finally made it in here.

3186
02:56:04,730 --> 02:56:08,230
I can't say I understand Manager Tanaka's bitterness.

3187
02:56:12,490 --> 02:56:13,770
Close enough.

3188
02:56:18,250 --> 02:56:19,390
Oh wow!

3189
02:56:20,750 --> 02:56:21,190
Hello!

3190
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:22,870
Welcome everybody!

3191
02:56:23,510 --> 02:56:26,830
I've heard it was beautiful, but I've never been in this suite before.

3192
02:56:27,750 --> 02:56:30,350
It's way more extravagant than a regular guest room.

3193
02:56:31,230 --> 02:56:32,650
It's perfect for a honeymoon.

3194
02:56:33,150 --> 02:56:35,390
I'm playing this game Lifeline.

3195
02:56:36,250 --> 02:56:37,470
It's voice activated.

3196
02:56:40,110 --> 02:56:41,490
Wait, what are we looking for?

3197
02:56:41,690 --> 02:56:42,150
Oh shoot.

3198
02:56:42,770 --> 02:56:44,130
Don't just walk around.

3199
02:56:44,230 --> 02:56:45,070
There are aliens.

3200
02:56:45,150 --> 02:56:47,030
We are on a spaceship and there are aliens.

3201
02:56:47,310 --> 02:56:47,910
Attack!

3202
02:56:48,250 --> 02:56:49,010
Oh no, no, no!

3203
02:56:51,010 --> 02:56:51,990
Oh shoot!

3204
02:56:52,330 --> 02:56:53,090
Oh my god!

3205
02:56:53,690 --> 02:56:54,610
Right side!

3206
02:56:54,770 --> 02:56:54,990
Shoot!

3207
02:56:56,730 --> 02:56:57,710
Oh good job.

3208
02:56:59,590 --> 02:57:00,510
Right eye!

3209
02:57:00,630 --> 02:57:00,730
Shoot!

3210
02:57:02,190 --> 02:57:03,150
Left eye!

3211
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:05,010
Run!

3212
02:57:06,730 --> 02:57:07,630
Right eye!

3213
02:57:08,490 --> 02:57:08,890
Nice!

3214
02:57:09,330 --> 02:57:09,890
Left eye!

3215
02:57:11,650 --> 02:57:12,010
Oh my god!

3216
02:57:12,090 --> 02:57:12,610
Right eye!

3217
02:57:13,330 --> 02:57:14,610
No, no, no!

3218
02:57:16,210 --> 02:57:17,230
Right eye!

3219
02:57:18,310 --> 02:57:18,810
Oh my god!

3220
02:57:19,030 --> 02:57:19,570
Left eye!

3221
02:57:20,690 --> 02:57:21,030
No!

3222
02:57:21,390 --> 02:57:22,070
Left eye!

3223
02:57:25,870 --> 02:57:26,650
Left eye!

3224
02:57:26,650 --> 02:57:27,190
Right eye!

3225
02:57:28,570 --> 02:57:28,590
Run!

3226
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:32,770
Right eye!

3227
02:57:33,870 --> 02:57:34,250
Heal?

3228
02:57:35,250 --> 02:57:36,450
Actually I need her to heal.

3229
02:57:37,130 --> 02:57:37,510
Recover!

3230
02:57:38,970 --> 02:57:40,330
Ok, ok, ok.

3231
02:57:40,750 --> 02:57:41,670
Right eye!

3232
02:57:43,390 --> 02:57:44,310
Right eye!

3233
02:57:45,210 --> 02:57:46,550
Oh my gosh, please ma'am.

3234
02:57:47,050 --> 02:57:47,870
Right eye!

3235
02:57:48,910 --> 02:57:50,130
Right eye!

3236
02:57:50,130 --> 02:57:52,330
I'm trying to...Middle eye!

3237
02:57:52,570 --> 02:57:55,690
Oh my god, stop shooting the chair, please Rio!

3238
02:57:56,410 --> 02:57:56,970
Run!

3239
02:57:59,210 --> 02:58:00,530
Run away!

3240
02:58:02,510 --> 02:58:03,750
Middle eye!

3241
02:58:04,730 --> 02:58:06,010
Middle eye!

3242
02:58:07,990 --> 02:58:09,330
Middle eye!

3243
02:58:10,770 --> 02:58:11,530
Middle eye!

3244
02:58:12,570 --> 02:58:13,610
Middle eye!

3245
02:58:14,430 --> 02:58:15,730
Right eye!

3246
02:58:16,650 --> 02:58:17,890
Left eye!

3247
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:20,050
Left eye!

3248
02:58:20,410 --> 02:58:21,510
Nice, nice.

3249
02:58:21,630 --> 02:58:22,370
Left eye!

3250
02:58:23,570 --> 02:58:24,630
Red eye!

3251
02:58:25,710 --> 02:58:26,610
Red eye!

3252
02:58:27,330 --> 02:58:28,450
Red eye!

3253
02:58:28,830 --> 02:58:29,950
Yes you can!

3254
02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:30,530
Red eye!

3255
02:58:31,310 --> 02:58:32,210
Don't bullshit me!

3256
02:58:32,410 --> 02:58:33,090
Red eye!

3257
02:58:33,710 --> 02:58:34,510
Oh, mouth!

3258
02:58:35,630 --> 02:58:36,370
Mouth?

3259
02:58:37,090 --> 02:58:38,230
Yes you can!

3260
02:58:38,250 --> 02:58:38,650
Mouth!

3261
02:58:39,970 --> 02:58:40,810
Mouth...

3262
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:43,130
Mouth...

3263
02:58:43,910 --> 02:58:44,750
Mouth...

3264
02:58:44,750 --> 02:58:46,010
Mouth...

3265
02:58:46,010 --> 02:58:46,930
Mouth...

3266
02:58:48,010 --> 02:58:48,870
Body!

3267
02:58:51,850 --> 02:58:53,250
Body!

3268
02:58:54,650 --> 02:58:56,050
Body!

3269
02:58:57,050 --> 02:58:57,590
Body!

3270
02:58:59,330 --> 02:59:00,610
What do you think?

3271
02:59:01,570 --> 02:59:02,330
Body!

3272
02:59:03,370 --> 02:59:04,010
Body!

3273
02:59:04,630 --> 02:59:05,330
Body!

3274
02:59:05,750 --> 02:59:06,790
Mouth?

3275
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:08,230
Body!

3276
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:12,860
Body!

3277
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:14,520
Body!

3278
02:59:14,520 --> 02:59:14,600
Body!

3279
02:59:18,070 --> 02:59:18,550
Tail?

3280
02:59:19,930 --> 02:59:20,410
Tail!

3281
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:30,240
This is what I've been dealing with everybody!

3282
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:31,220
Welcome!

3283
02:59:35,180 --> 02:59:36,140
Holy moly!

3284
02:59:36,200 --> 02:59:37,020
That was so crazy!

3285
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:38,500
We went into first person view!

3286
02:59:39,700 --> 02:59:42,140
I was trying to get out of the...

3287
02:59:42,140 --> 02:59:43,500
whatever I was in.

3288
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:46,340
Hold on, I'm looking around.

3289
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:47,520
What do we got here?

3290
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:49,140
Coffee table!

3291
02:59:50,760 --> 02:59:52,540
Maybe my aim is bad!

3292
02:59:56,040 --> 02:59:57,240
Save point!

3293
02:59:58,980 --> 03:00:00,040
Let's go there first.

3294
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:03,980
Run!

3295
03:00:06,700 --> 03:00:08,080
Very good Rio!

3296
03:00:09,140 --> 03:00:10,360
Very good Rio!

3297
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:11,920
Peak gaming!

3298
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:14,100
This makes me want to do like...

3299
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:16,440
What was that?

3300
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:21,100
The game where you go...

3301
03:00:23,800 --> 03:00:27,780
And you fly and move.

3302
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:32,900
Stand up!

3303
03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:36,660
No!

3304
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:37,780
Stop!

3305
03:00:38,240 --> 03:00:40,460
She wants me so bad.

3306
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:42,460
She really is kind of obsessed with me.

3307
03:00:42,460 --> 03:00:43,980
Lounge table!

3308
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:46,900
That's fine too actually.

3309
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:50,360
Rio always wanting to go to the bed.

3310
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:52,040
Rio and bed, name a better couple.

3311
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:53,540
Cup!

3312
03:00:56,640 --> 03:00:57,980
Drink coffee!

3313
03:01:02,320 --> 03:01:04,340
I'm so sorry Rio!

3314
03:01:04,700 --> 03:01:06,620
I didn't know that you...

3315
03:01:06,620 --> 03:01:07,460
You...

3316
03:01:07,460 --> 03:01:09,580
This was your game.

3317
03:01:10,380 --> 03:01:12,460
You guys watch this!

3318
03:01:13,080 --> 03:01:13,300
Bark!

3319
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:26,000
Go!

3320
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:33,960
Walk!

3321
03:01:36,360 --> 03:01:38,600
Bark like a dog!

3322
03:01:39,580 --> 03:01:40,060
Middle dog?

3323
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:42,360
Or big dog?

3324
03:01:42,900 --> 03:01:44,880
Little dog?

3325
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:47,140
Or big dog?

3326
03:01:52,270 --> 03:01:53,650
Bark like a dog!

3327
03:01:53,950 --> 03:01:54,510
Middle dog?

3328
03:01:56,090 --> 03:01:56,790
Or big dog?

3329
03:02:00,730 --> 03:02:02,930
Okay, so what was the other thing?

3330
03:02:03,250 --> 03:02:04,290
We check the coffee table...

3331
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:05,790
Lounge!

3332
03:02:07,730 --> 03:02:08,350
Lounge!

3333
03:02:09,730 --> 03:02:10,350
Lounge!

3334
03:02:11,350 --> 03:02:12,070
Lounge!

3335
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:16,090
Lounge?

3336
03:02:22,950 --> 03:02:24,350
Lounge!

3337
03:02:27,230 --> 03:02:27,930
Lounge!

3338
03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:31,650
Lounge!

3339
03:02:33,410 --> 03:02:33,750
Lounge!

3340
03:02:35,550 --> 03:02:36,950
Lounge!

3341
03:02:38,190 --> 03:02:38,890
Lounge!

3342
03:02:38,890 --> 03:02:40,410
What am I missing?

3343
03:02:43,750 --> 03:02:44,430
Lounge.

3344
03:02:47,930 --> 03:02:49,610
We got it.

3345
03:02:53,620 --> 03:02:54,940
Oh my goodness.

3346
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:56,700
It really is honeymoon mode.

3347
03:02:57,400 --> 03:02:57,840
Picture.

3348
03:02:59,580 --> 03:03:00,600
It looks like a rat.

3349
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:01,800
What is that?

3350
03:03:02,480 --> 03:03:03,300
Check photograph.

3351
03:03:04,140 --> 03:03:05,220
It looks like a white...

3352
03:03:06,060 --> 03:03:06,580
Oh!

3353
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:16,300
You have to see what I see.

3354
03:03:20,510 --> 03:03:21,030
Bouquet.

3355
03:03:25,350 --> 03:03:29,170
The G-Force.

3356
03:03:29,270 --> 03:03:30,070
Okay, hold on.

3357
03:03:30,570 --> 03:03:33,610
Okay, so it's got like a little eye...

3358
03:03:33,610 --> 03:03:34,910
and there's his arms.

3359
03:03:36,270 --> 03:03:38,330
And this is the rat's body.

3360
03:03:38,430 --> 03:03:39,590
It's like a white mouse.

3361
03:03:46,030 --> 03:03:48,010
Do you see it?

3362
03:03:48,090 --> 03:03:49,130
Do you see it?

3363
03:03:49,950 --> 03:03:51,590
It looks like a little rat.

3364
03:03:58,480 --> 03:03:59,160
Wine.

3365
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:03,420
Oh.

3366
03:04:03,420 --> 03:04:04,100
Sorry.

3367
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:06,560
Tomato, tomato.

3368
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:08,080
The lid, Patrick.

3369
03:04:08,320 --> 03:04:09,560
The lid game.

3370
03:04:09,940 --> 03:04:11,120
It's true.

3371
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:12,620
Champagne.

3372
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:19,320
Champagne.

3373
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:23,440
Oh, like you would have drank it anyways.

3374
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:24,580
Food.

3375
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:29,660
Food.

3376
03:04:29,660 --> 03:04:29,740
Food.

3377
03:04:32,740 --> 03:04:33,880
No, no, please.

3378
03:04:34,160 --> 03:04:34,680
Lounge.

3379
03:04:38,100 --> 03:04:38,620
Lounge.

3380
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:39,540
No!

3381
03:04:42,940 --> 03:04:43,720
What's happening?

3382
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:46,760
What's going on?

3383
03:04:49,320 --> 03:04:49,820
Uh-oh.

3384
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:52,640
Oh no!

3385
03:04:53,640 --> 03:04:55,200
Wait, there's going to be a sneak attack.

3386
03:04:55,280 --> 03:04:55,700
I know it.

3387
03:04:57,340 --> 03:04:58,740
Oh.

3388
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:01,340
I can.

3389
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:07,700
Bathroom.

3390
03:05:11,560 --> 03:05:12,480
We're looking.

3391
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:16,100
Okay.

3392
03:05:18,100 --> 03:05:18,700
Bathroom.

3393
03:05:21,880 --> 03:05:22,860
Zoom.

3394
03:05:24,780 --> 03:05:25,820
Okay, just kidding.

3395
03:05:26,320 --> 03:05:27,560
Why is there a camera in the toilet?

3396
03:05:27,660 --> 03:05:28,740
That's a great question.

3397
03:05:29,540 --> 03:05:29,980
Lounge.

3398
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:33,320
Lounge.

3399
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:38,120
Lounge.

3400
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:40,200
Lounge.

3401
03:05:41,420 --> 03:05:41,860
Lounge.

3402
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:43,200
Yeah!

3403
03:05:46,180 --> 03:05:48,120
Why does she have such trouble with that?

3404
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:48,700
Is it me?

3405
03:05:49,160 --> 03:05:50,260
Am I saying it funny?

3406
03:05:52,020 --> 03:05:52,700
Okay.

3407
03:05:55,720 --> 03:05:56,400
Fruit.

3408
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:03,360
Oh, it was a chip.

3409
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:05,100
After all.

3410
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:05,740
Okay.

3411
03:06:06,340 --> 03:06:07,940
Maybe blow that candle out.

3412
03:06:08,280 --> 03:06:08,980
Eat fruit.

3413
03:06:12,380 --> 03:06:12,960
I do.

3414
03:06:13,500 --> 03:06:14,400
Eat fruit.

3415
03:06:20,260 --> 03:06:20,760
Let's see.

3416
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,100
Okay.

3417
03:06:21,800 --> 03:06:22,840
Second floor.

3418
03:06:24,680 --> 03:06:26,020
Wait, can I see it?

3419
03:06:26,080 --> 03:06:26,620
Can I...

3420
03:06:28,540 --> 03:06:31,160
It won't let me switch the map.

3421
03:06:31,860 --> 03:06:32,400
Bedroom?

3422
03:06:34,860 --> 03:06:36,120
That's what I said!

3423
03:06:41,380 --> 03:06:42,800
Eat peanut butter.

3424
03:06:44,200 --> 03:06:44,740
Run.

3425
03:06:45,900 --> 03:06:47,100
Oh, I can't talk.

3426
03:06:47,240 --> 03:06:47,460
Uh-oh.

3427
03:06:47,560 --> 03:06:48,540
We're going to get ambushed maybe?

3428
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:51,500
No, she's just being safe.

3429
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:54,200
I think we're going to get ambushed in here.

3430
03:06:57,680 --> 03:06:58,960
What thing?

3431
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:01,660
What is it?

3432
03:07:02,760 --> 03:07:03,820
Who is that?

3433
03:07:04,220 --> 03:07:04,880
A man.

3434
03:07:05,720 --> 03:07:06,860
You called him a thing!

3435
03:07:15,240 --> 03:07:16,660
Oh my God!

3436
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:19,020
Wait a second.

3437
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:19,700
I'm human.

3438
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:20,680
Don't shoot.

3439
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:24,220
Hey, I'm sorry.

3440
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:26,260
I thought that an alien had come in here.

3441
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:29,980
I don't have any useful weapons, so the only thing I could do was play dead.

3442
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:32,620
I'm Alan Honda, a researcher.

3443
03:07:33,140 --> 03:07:35,300
Can you maybe lower that gun?

3444
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:37,300
I'm human.

3445
03:07:38,780 --> 03:07:41,540
I'll admit to being a little weird, but...

3446
03:07:45,460 --> 03:07:47,220
Did you just say alien?

3447
03:07:47,220 --> 03:07:48,180
Alien.

3448
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:51,780
What else would they be?

3449
03:08:04,060 --> 03:08:08,440
What's a laypeople?

3450
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:12,720
What's that?

3451
03:08:12,900 --> 03:08:13,440
What is that?

3452
03:08:14,440 --> 03:08:15,660
Hello fellow human.

3453
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:37,020
He's nerding out on us.

3454
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:42,640
Why do you have a crop vest?

3455
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:44,240
This guy's outfit.

3456
03:08:45,520 --> 03:08:46,800
He's got even a chain.

3457
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:48,940
Like a pocket chain.

3458
03:08:54,300 --> 03:08:55,900
Why are you such a jerk?

3459
03:08:55,960 --> 03:08:57,280
We just came and saved your butt.

3460
03:08:57,800 --> 03:08:58,880
There were monsters downstairs.

3461
03:08:58,880 --> 03:09:00,380
You ran into that spider, right?

3462
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:04,540
How did you get away from it?

3463
03:09:04,820 --> 03:09:06,280
Please, tell me.

3464
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:11,920
With that.

3465
03:09:12,660 --> 03:09:13,820
But it's out of fuel now.

3466
03:09:14,340 --> 03:09:20,360
That thing is huge, but it seemed to share similarities with Earth's arthropod, a spider.

3467
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:22,160
So I scared it off with fire.

3468
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:25,380
So it's vulnerable against fire.

3469
03:09:25,380 --> 03:09:29,320
Until help arrives, I'm holding up in here.

3470
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:32,920
Earlier, research supervisor Powers sent a rescue signal.

3471
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:35,020
You were literally in danger.

3472
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:35,980
There was a guy downstairs.

3473
03:09:36,200 --> 03:09:38,620
So I came to tell the others, but...

3474
03:09:38,620 --> 03:09:40,020
Because of that monster spider.

3475
03:09:40,820 --> 03:09:42,360
You can't make it to the receiving port?

3476
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:44,400
Bingo!

3477
03:09:44,840 --> 03:09:46,160
It's a nasty obstacle.

3478
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:49,140
So, how about it?

3479
03:09:49,380 --> 03:09:50,960
Wanna play dead with me?

3480
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:52,300
I'm going.

3481
03:09:53,140 --> 03:09:54,940
I have a partner backing me up.

3482
03:09:54,940 --> 03:09:55,480
Yeah.

3483
03:09:57,620 --> 03:09:58,140
Yes.

3484
03:10:02,360 --> 03:10:02,880
What?

3485
03:10:03,160 --> 03:10:03,840
What are you going to give me?

3486
03:10:03,880 --> 03:10:04,180
Heal?

3487
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:06,760
Shutter key.

3488
03:10:07,540 --> 03:10:10,520
Do you really intend to just play dead?

3489
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:14,040
Please refrain from talking to me.

3490
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:15,300
Okay.

3491
03:10:15,700 --> 03:10:16,080
Whatever.

3492
03:10:18,080 --> 03:10:18,660
This guy is...

3493
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:20,460
Research supervisor really sent for help.

3494
03:10:21,680 --> 03:10:23,700
I guess the rescue team is already on the way.

3495
03:10:23,700 --> 03:10:24,740
This guy sucks.

3496
03:10:25,140 --> 03:10:25,620
Please.

3497
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:30,480
Refrain from talking to me.

3498
03:10:36,920 --> 03:10:37,400
Okay.

3499
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:40,240
Okay.

3500
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:46,500
Oh, it's on that side?

3501
03:10:49,640 --> 03:10:52,120
Well, we know where that is.

3502
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:55,620
Okay.

3503
03:10:56,960 --> 03:10:57,540
Alright.

3504
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:59,700
Save point?

3505
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:01,280
Okay.

3506
03:11:03,560 --> 03:11:05,940
Alright, we went through everything in here I suppose.

3507
03:11:06,180 --> 03:11:07,700
So we can go to the save point.

3508
03:11:08,280 --> 03:11:09,360
And then go out.

3509
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:10,340
Nice.

3510
03:11:12,280 --> 03:11:14,980
I couldn't remember if it was save panel or save point.

3511
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:18,680
Okay.

3512
03:11:21,780 --> 03:11:22,360
Nice.

3513
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:26,420
Play tongue twisters?

3514
03:11:26,540 --> 03:11:27,800
I don't have that one.

3515
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:29,740
We have another game.

3516
03:11:29,820 --> 03:11:30,160
Hold on.

3517
03:11:30,220 --> 03:11:30,820
What was it?

3518
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:33,980
We got something else from her.

3519
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:37,940
It was...

3520
03:11:39,140 --> 03:11:41,480
We are so needy.

3521
03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:43,480
Consultation.

3522
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:48,700
Yeah,

3523
03:11:52,560 --> 03:11:53,120
categories.

3524
03:11:53,540 --> 03:11:54,520
That's what we got.

3525
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:55,660
Hold on though.

3526
03:11:57,600 --> 03:11:59,640
Naomi isn't around.

3527
03:11:59,720 --> 03:12:01,200
Oh, I wasn't even saying it.

3528
03:12:01,700 --> 03:12:03,860
Naomi isn't around.

3529
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:12,740
How are things on Earth?

3530
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:16,060
Oof.

3531
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:17,620
Let's not think about it.

3532
03:12:23,420 --> 03:12:24,100
Nice.

3533
03:12:24,500 --> 03:12:29,320
The table lamp behind her looks like it has an alien face on it.

3534
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:30,000
How fitting.

3535
03:12:35,460 --> 03:12:37,900
What is the manager like?

3536
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:48,260
Okay.

3537
03:12:50,580 --> 03:12:53,520
Wait, the guy that was a super jerk to us earlier?

3538
03:12:53,660 --> 03:12:54,560
That called us a bimbo?

3539
03:12:55,240 --> 03:12:56,060
You see it?

3540
03:12:56,060 --> 03:12:57,360
The bogo's been to him.

3541
03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:00,420
What do you think of Alan?

3542
03:13:04,580 --> 03:13:05,480
That guy sucks.

3543
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:08,280
That guy sucks.

3544
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:11,960
We can't do a category game.

3545
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:13,140
Okay, so only in motion.

3546
03:13:13,940 --> 03:13:14,440
I'm done.

3547
03:13:15,720 --> 03:13:16,180
Stop.

3548
03:13:17,620 --> 03:13:18,040
Finish.

3549
03:13:22,620 --> 03:13:23,320
Okay.

3550
03:13:23,720 --> 03:13:25,320
Category game.

3551
03:13:28,260 --> 03:13:30,300
Category game.

3552
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:33,600
Okay.

3553
03:13:33,600 --> 03:13:33,900
Okay.

3554
03:13:45,840 --> 03:13:47,240
Gemini.

3555
03:13:51,620 --> 03:13:53,020
Virgo.

3556
03:13:53,020 --> 03:13:53,880
Virgo.

3557
03:14:00,900 --> 03:14:00,900
Five.

3558
03:14:01,940 --> 03:14:02,700
Four.

3559
03:14:06,060 --> 03:14:07,460
Capricorn.

3560
03:14:10,660 --> 03:14:12,060
Five.

3561
03:14:12,740 --> 03:14:13,120
Four.

3562
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:18,020
Scorpio.

3563
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:19,840
Sure.

3564
03:14:21,660 --> 03:14:22,740
Five.

3565
03:14:23,280 --> 03:14:23,920
Four.

3566
03:14:24,480 --> 03:14:25,200
Three.

3567
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:26,540
Two.

3568
03:14:27,360 --> 03:14:27,840
One.

3569
03:14:28,940 --> 03:14:29,520
Boo-boo!

3570
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:34,420
One.

3571
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:38,240
Yeah.

3572
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:40,780
I'm too good at this game.

3573
03:14:42,120 --> 03:14:43,200
She looks like she's about to cry.

3574
03:14:44,720 --> 03:14:46,020
You're welcome.

3575
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:49,580
Is that the only game we can play?

3576
03:14:49,700 --> 03:14:50,220
Only category?

3577
03:14:51,380 --> 03:14:51,660
Alright.

3578
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:56,500
Go outside.

3579
03:14:59,000 --> 03:14:59,800
Run.

3580
03:15:06,460 --> 03:15:08,060
Very good.

3581
03:15:08,060 --> 03:15:10,000
Can you romance her?

3582
03:15:10,060 --> 03:15:10,880
We have a girlfriend!

3583
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:15,360
We're trying to find our girlfriend Naomi.

3584
03:15:18,180 --> 03:15:20,820
Shut her too.

3585
03:15:21,660 --> 03:15:21,980
Yeah.

3586
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:25,480
Run.

3587
03:15:31,020 --> 03:15:32,340
Okey dokey.

3588
03:15:34,200 --> 03:15:36,040
So I guess...

3589
03:15:36,040 --> 03:15:39,980
The place that we're trying to... I thought it was behind shutter one that we're trying to get to.

3590
03:15:40,060 --> 03:15:41,160
I guess it's shutter four.

3591
03:15:45,940 --> 03:15:47,460
She is so impatient.

3592
03:15:48,140 --> 03:15:50,060
Please Ryo, I'm working on it.

3593
03:15:56,060 --> 03:15:57,660
For once it's safe.

3594
03:15:58,820 --> 03:15:59,440
Oh, nevermind.

3595
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:02,060
She's going already.

3596
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:05,200
Can't trust Naomi.

3597
03:16:05,460 --> 03:16:06,020
So true.

3598
03:16:13,540 --> 03:16:14,920
That's not good.

3599
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:21,580
How big is this place?

3600
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:26,140
We found one!

3601
03:16:27,940 --> 03:16:29,180
Empty?

3602
03:16:29,900 --> 03:16:30,460
No way.

3603
03:16:44,600 --> 03:16:47,000
That was fast.

3604
03:16:48,520 --> 03:16:49,520
Maybe find fuel.

3605
03:16:52,360 --> 03:16:53,240
That's it?

3606
03:16:53,240 --> 03:16:54,940
You give up?

3607
03:17:10,860 --> 03:17:11,900
Set yourself.

3608
03:17:15,340 --> 03:17:16,820
She was faster than me.

3609
03:17:16,980 --> 03:17:18,400
It was so quick.

3610
03:17:18,880 --> 03:17:20,220
She was just like, yeah, I'm done now.

3611
03:17:20,220 --> 03:17:21,640
What's in here?

3612
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:25,220
Check food unit.

3613
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:31,560
Maybe there is some oil in here, right?

3614
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:36,280
Maybe we can like...

3615
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:39,660
Stick a rag in the oil, right?

3616
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:46,520
Ok, just kidding.

3617
03:17:46,520 --> 03:17:49,080
We can make our own molotov.

3618
03:17:53,300 --> 03:17:55,820
What else is in here?

3619
03:17:57,440 --> 03:17:59,440
Supply unit.

3620
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:03,880
Green box.

3621
03:18:07,820 --> 03:18:09,760
That's not what I said.

3622
03:18:11,240 --> 03:18:12,720
That's not what I said.

3623
03:18:14,540 --> 03:18:15,580
White box?

3624
03:18:17,280 --> 03:18:17,800
Whatever.

3625
03:18:20,460 --> 03:18:21,120
I see.

3626
03:18:24,360 --> 03:18:24,880
Box.

3627
03:18:27,520 --> 03:18:28,620
No, no, no.

3628
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:30,720
What is it?

3629
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:31,880
Supply unit.

3630
03:18:34,360 --> 03:18:36,860
She doesn't want to open it up because Solid Snake is in there.

3631
03:18:39,340 --> 03:18:39,860
Box.

3632
03:18:46,140 --> 03:18:47,340
Supply unit.

3633
03:18:53,540 --> 03:18:54,740
Left side.

3634
03:18:57,160 --> 03:18:58,360
Left box.

3635
03:19:04,920 --> 03:19:05,520
Lift?

3636
03:19:08,960 --> 03:19:11,360
There is something in the middle, but I can't tell what it is.

3637
03:19:11,360 --> 03:19:13,540
Maybe I'll say just say middle.

3638
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:15,360
What is it?

3639
03:19:16,760 --> 03:19:17,340
Middle.

3640
03:19:27,380 --> 03:19:28,860
Middle box.

3641
03:19:30,880 --> 03:19:32,140
There we go.

3642
03:19:37,480 --> 03:19:39,660
How do I turn on the lift?

3643
03:19:40,610 --> 03:19:41,740
Here we go.

3644
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:43,200
Power panel on.

3645
03:19:44,140 --> 03:19:44,800
Nice.

3646
03:19:45,700 --> 03:19:47,660
Gosh, we have all the control.

3647
03:19:48,260 --> 03:19:48,760
Ride.

3648
03:19:50,880 --> 03:19:52,120
Take lift.

3649
03:19:55,780 --> 03:19:56,040
What?

3650
03:19:57,760 --> 03:19:58,540
No, no, no.

3651
03:20:00,560 --> 03:20:02,340
Ride lift.

3652
03:20:02,340 --> 03:20:02,420
Lift.

3653
03:20:06,680 --> 03:20:09,360
I know.

3654
03:20:10,400 --> 03:20:11,180
I know.

3655
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:12,540
Lift.

3656
03:20:19,280 --> 03:20:21,380
Use lift.

3657
03:20:24,140 --> 03:20:25,020
Thank you.

3658
03:20:28,240 --> 03:20:29,320
Go up.

3659
03:20:32,340 --> 03:20:33,120
No, please.

3660
03:20:34,040 --> 03:20:35,220
Supply unit.

3661
03:20:39,020 --> 03:20:40,240
Supply unit.

3662
03:20:41,980 --> 03:20:42,880
What did I say to her?

3663
03:20:43,820 --> 03:20:44,000
What?

3664
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:44,480
What do you mean?

3665
03:20:44,980 --> 03:20:46,360
You are stupid.

3666
03:20:52,160 --> 03:20:52,900
Dummy.

3667
03:20:52,900 --> 03:20:55,360
Dummy.

3668
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:05,880
Supply unit.

3669
03:21:06,980 --> 03:21:07,640
No.

3670
03:21:08,340 --> 03:21:09,780
Supply unit.

3671
03:21:10,820 --> 03:21:11,360
Thank you.

3672
03:21:14,900 --> 03:21:16,400
Use lift.

3673
03:21:18,080 --> 03:21:18,780
The lift.

3674
03:21:19,280 --> 03:21:20,780
Use lift.

3675
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:24,340
OK.

3676
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:26,900
I'm going to try it myself.

3677
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:27,840
I'm not going to say anything.

3678
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:30,320
I'm going to use...Oh here we go.

3679
03:21:30,500 --> 03:21:31,120
Lift panel.

3680
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:32,260
OK, here we go.

3681
03:21:32,400 --> 03:21:32,660
On.

3682
03:21:41,690 --> 03:21:42,110
Sorry.

3683
03:21:43,350 --> 03:21:44,050
Oh, sorry.

3684
03:21:44,910 --> 03:21:46,270
I think I broke it.

3685
03:21:48,130 --> 03:21:48,810
Oh, sorry.

3686
03:21:48,890 --> 03:21:49,650
I think I broke it.

3687
03:21:54,610 --> 03:21:55,330
I'm checking.

3688
03:21:55,330 --> 03:21:55,510
I'm checking.

3689
03:21:56,290 --> 03:21:58,630
It has a mind of it's own.

3690
03:22:00,930 --> 03:22:02,650
I can't control it.

3691
03:22:02,710 --> 03:22:04,330
I'm not pressing anything.

3692
03:22:08,070 --> 03:22:10,030
How do I stop it?

3693
03:22:12,590 --> 03:22:12,930
Down.

3694
03:22:16,110 --> 03:22:18,230
How do I stop it?

3695
03:22:21,380 --> 03:22:22,260
Oh my god.

3696
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,560
Oh, sorry.

3697
03:22:42,720 --> 03:22:48,540
Maybe I go...down here?

3698
03:22:49,760 --> 03:22:50,420
And then over?

3699
03:22:52,600 --> 03:22:53,780
I'm trying!

3700
03:22:55,680 --> 03:22:57,020
Over?

3701
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:02,380
What does it want me to do?

3702
03:23:04,040 --> 03:23:05,520
I don't know.

3703
03:23:06,100 --> 03:23:07,640
Operator middle shelf.

3704
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:08,720
I said middle shelf.

3705
03:23:09,140 --> 03:23:10,640
I don't know what to do.

3706
03:23:11,180 --> 03:23:11,960
Ejector.

3707
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:19,340
I'm trying.

3708
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:22,020
I'm trying.

3709
03:23:23,640 --> 03:23:26,090
I don't know what...

3710
03:23:28,330 --> 03:23:30,410
I'm...there is like...enter?

3711
03:23:30,830 --> 03:23:31,670
It doesn't do anything.

3712
03:23:31,730 --> 03:23:33,370
There is no enter, you guys.

3713
03:23:33,450 --> 03:23:34,110
There is no enter.

3714
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:35,890
I don't know what to do.

3715
03:23:37,130 --> 03:23:40,150
Like, enter is not a control that I have.

3716
03:23:43,250 --> 03:23:43,770
Spacebar.

3717
03:23:43,810 --> 03:23:46,510
I'm on...it's a Playstation 2 game.

3718
03:23:48,150 --> 03:23:50,170
I'm on a controller, you guys.

3719
03:23:52,810 --> 03:23:53,330
Stop.

3720
03:24:01,530 --> 03:24:03,050
Start just does this.

3721
03:24:04,790 --> 03:24:07,130
I've already tried mashing buttons, you guys.

3722
03:24:07,370 --> 03:24:08,170
I've already tried.

3723
03:24:09,530 --> 03:24:10,310
This is X.

3724
03:24:10,610 --> 03:24:11,490
This is square.

3725
03:24:11,850 --> 03:24:12,750
This is triangle.

3726
03:24:13,510 --> 03:24:13,830
Hello.

3727
03:24:21,890 --> 03:24:24,070
How do I get this?

3728
03:24:27,590 --> 03:24:30,210
Circle is only for talking command.

3729
03:24:35,450 --> 03:24:36,290
Down.

3730
03:24:43,990 --> 03:24:45,810
As you say, Rio.

3731
03:24:46,110 --> 03:24:47,090
As you say.

3732
03:24:58,690 --> 03:25:00,450
I don't understand the puzzle.

3733
03:25:00,810 --> 03:25:03,870
I feel like I'm missing something.

3734
03:25:08,770 --> 03:25:10,370
It won't let me stop.

3735
03:25:11,330 --> 03:25:11,950
Stop!

3736
03:25:12,850 --> 03:25:13,610
Stop!

3737
03:25:15,510 --> 03:25:16,270
Stop.

3738
03:25:20,590 --> 03:25:26,730
I feel like I've tried all options.

3739
03:25:37,050 --> 03:25:37,490
Sorry!

3740
03:25:38,390 --> 03:25:40,510
Maybe if I go all the way...I don't know.

3741
03:25:42,270 --> 03:25:44,030
No, you can't press two buttons at once.

3742
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:59,520
I think if I drive from the middle, it just...it takes me all the way to the top.

3743
03:26:00,760 --> 03:26:04,300
From the middle, it takes me all the way to the top, right?

3744
03:26:05,700 --> 03:26:06,260
Yeah.

3745
03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:09,140
I don't know.

3746
03:26:09,940 --> 03:26:10,520
I don't know.

3747
03:26:17,160 --> 03:26:19,580
I've tried all possible options, I feel.

3748
03:26:21,740 --> 03:26:25,120
The guide says you need to use the jam pattern to get it.

3749
03:26:25,260 --> 03:26:25,620
What?

3750
03:26:26,140 --> 03:26:27,740
What the hell does that mean?

3751
03:26:31,270 --> 03:26:32,970
It says you need to jam.

3752
03:26:33,610 --> 03:26:34,010
What?

3753
03:26:35,270 --> 03:26:37,070
What does a jam mean?

3754
03:26:42,910 --> 03:26:44,190
Okay, right?

3755
03:26:47,290 --> 03:26:49,510
Oh wait, it like shifted over.

3756
03:26:51,910 --> 03:26:52,510
Or am I crazy?

3757
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:04,550
Oh look!

3758
03:27:05,050 --> 03:27:05,730
Wait...

3759
03:27:10,790 --> 03:27:12,750
Maybe I fixed it.

3760
03:27:15,210 --> 03:27:17,170
Hold on, let's...

3761
03:27:18,130 --> 03:27:18,770
No...

3762
03:27:18,770 --> 03:27:20,950
I don't understand this at all.

3763
03:27:21,250 --> 03:27:22,670
I'm so confused.

3764
03:27:35,890 --> 03:27:37,290
I'm gonna Google it.

3765
03:27:38,690 --> 03:27:40,070
I'm gonna Google it.

3766
03:27:41,150 --> 03:27:42,050
I don't understand.

3767
03:27:42,610 --> 03:27:42,970
What is this?

3768
03:27:45,470 --> 03:27:47,450
What is this thing called?

3769
03:27:48,250 --> 03:27:49,850
A lift puzzle.

3770
03:27:54,760 --> 03:27:56,080
Use the pow... wait.

3771
03:28:02,080 --> 03:28:04,000
Oh, it's like giving me a hall.

3772
03:28:04,340 --> 03:28:05,240
Oh, moon suite?

3773
03:28:05,400 --> 03:28:06,620
Okay, we have not gone there yet.

3774
03:28:07,660 --> 03:28:08,380
Spider creature?

3775
03:28:08,580 --> 03:28:09,520
Oh, I have not gone there yet.

3776
03:28:09,960 --> 03:28:10,320
Infirmary?

3777
03:28:10,360 --> 03:28:10,920
I have not gone there yet.

3778
03:28:10,980 --> 03:28:11,080
Okay.

3779
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:14,540
Sun suite?

3780
03:28:14,680 --> 03:28:15,360
Okay, we got there.

3781
03:28:26,900 --> 03:28:27,960
Wait a second.

3782
03:28:29,780 --> 03:28:32,500
There was supposed to be more things to check in the sun suite.

3783
03:28:32,580 --> 03:28:33,800
I think I'm missing a lot of stuff.

3784
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:34,320
Oopsie.

3785
03:28:36,900 --> 03:28:38,280
But she didn't want to check the bathroom.

3786
03:28:38,580 --> 03:28:41,340
She was telling me to check the bathroom, but she always wanted to not be in there.

3787
03:28:41,500 --> 03:28:42,040
Anyway, okay.

3788
03:28:45,360 --> 03:28:46,000
Supply unit.

3789
03:28:47,620 --> 03:28:49,200
Go... ride the lift.

3790
03:28:50,940 --> 03:28:54,980
Left... and up to the top left corner.

3791
03:28:55,620 --> 03:28:58,700
Then go right to the top right corner.

3792
03:29:00,160 --> 03:29:02,600
Hold down and left together?

3793
03:29:17,780 --> 03:29:19,040
Well, check.

3794
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:20,660
Check.

3795
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:25,840
Is it this one?

3796
03:29:28,600 --> 03:29:29,300
Check.

3797
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:50,660
Incinerate.

3798
03:30:04,700 --> 03:30:07,320
Maybe take more of those.

3799
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:10,600
Yay!

3800
03:30:11,480 --> 03:30:12,520
We made it.

3801
03:30:12,620 --> 03:30:14,200
Okay, get off.

3802
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:20,820
Oh goodness gracious.

3803
03:30:21,020 --> 03:30:21,760
Safe point.

3804
03:30:22,260 --> 03:30:23,980
Safe point.

3805
03:30:26,700 --> 03:30:30,020
This game wants to raise your blood pressure.

3806
03:30:30,160 --> 03:30:30,920
I don't have blood.

3807
03:30:31,060 --> 03:30:34,200
I have ectoplasm and I feel like I'm bubbling over.

3808
03:30:36,640 --> 03:30:38,220
I'm bubbling over.

3809
03:30:39,200 --> 03:30:40,220
Okay, nice.

3810
03:30:40,620 --> 03:30:42,020
So we don't have to do that again hopefully.

3811
03:30:42,020 --> 03:30:45,640
Yeah, number of commands 862.

3812
03:30:46,140 --> 03:30:47,700
Ectoplasm pressure, yeah.

3813
03:30:50,820 --> 03:30:52,880
Okay, get off the floor Rio.

3814
03:30:53,020 --> 03:30:53,700
It's dirty.

3815
03:30:54,440 --> 03:30:56,280
Alright, what else did we not check in here?

3816
03:30:58,320 --> 03:30:59,280
Mechanical unit.

3817
03:30:59,820 --> 03:31:00,900
Mechanical unit.

3818
03:31:03,880 --> 03:31:04,560
Yeah.

3819
03:31:05,520 --> 03:31:05,840
Yeah.

3820
03:31:06,540 --> 03:31:09,100
Unless that was the... Oh no.

3821
03:31:09,100 --> 03:31:12,460
No, please God.

3822
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:15,040
Shelf.

3823
03:31:18,380 --> 03:31:18,900
No.

3824
03:31:22,010 --> 03:31:22,930
Oh, out of order.

3825
03:31:23,170 --> 03:31:24,650
Okay, controls inoperable.

3826
03:31:24,890 --> 03:31:26,730
Yeah, clearly all of this is.

3827
03:31:28,210 --> 03:31:29,630
Okay, I don't think we have to do this again.

3828
03:31:32,390 --> 03:31:33,430
So, we...

3829
03:31:34,370 --> 03:31:35,290
Data unit.

3830
03:31:40,470 --> 03:31:41,210
No.

3831
03:31:41,570 --> 03:31:43,350
Maybe a data unit.

3832
03:31:44,330 --> 03:31:45,590
Data unit.

3833
03:31:47,670 --> 03:31:48,870
I said data!

3834
03:31:51,510 --> 03:31:53,190
I said it.

3835
03:31:53,570 --> 03:31:54,370
I said data.

3836
03:31:58,470 --> 03:31:59,290
Let's see.

3837
03:32:00,130 --> 03:32:00,890
Read note.

3838
03:32:08,910 --> 03:32:09,430
No.

3839
03:32:09,430 --> 03:32:09,810
No.

3840
03:32:13,820 --> 03:32:14,260
Notice.

3841
03:32:20,340 --> 03:32:24,000
Oh, there it is.

3842
03:32:24,120 --> 03:32:24,220
Okay.

3843
03:32:25,800 --> 03:32:27,200
Supply unit lift malfunction.

3844
03:32:27,400 --> 03:32:30,460
Refer to the notes below for dealing with the drive system malfunction.

3845
03:32:30,460 --> 03:32:31,680
Ah!

3846
03:32:36,060 --> 03:32:39,200
It was for that thing.

3847
03:32:48,050 --> 03:32:49,450
Oopsie.

3848
03:32:51,950 --> 03:32:54,810
What else was there to check?

3849
03:32:55,470 --> 03:32:56,290
Check machine.

3850
03:33:08,390 --> 03:33:09,070
Yeah.

3851
03:33:09,570 --> 03:33:11,230
And then what is that on the ground?

3852
03:33:12,290 --> 03:33:13,810
Check cart?

3853
03:33:19,770 --> 03:33:24,530
Why don't we take it and ram it into the thing.

3854
03:33:24,730 --> 03:33:25,430
Take cart.

3855
03:33:27,730 --> 03:33:28,890
Take cart.

3856
03:33:29,910 --> 03:33:30,830
Take it.

3857
03:33:31,110 --> 03:33:32,730
Why don't we ram it into the spider?

3858
03:33:33,830 --> 03:33:34,810
Take cart.

3859
03:33:38,650 --> 03:33:40,290
Also, her dress.

3860
03:33:40,510 --> 03:33:42,730
Her whole outfit is kind of a mess.

3861
03:33:43,090 --> 03:33:45,090
It looks like a joker in the back.

3862
03:33:45,630 --> 03:33:48,370
She's got pants, but it's a skirt in the front.

3863
03:33:49,250 --> 03:33:51,610
It's just kind of a bizarre waitress outfit.

3864
03:33:54,430 --> 03:33:55,490
Move cart.

3865
03:34:00,910 --> 03:34:02,430
How do you know?

3866
03:34:02,830 --> 03:34:03,710
How do you know?

3867
03:34:04,030 --> 03:34:04,990
How do you know?

3868
03:34:04,990 --> 03:34:05,690
Alright.

3869
03:34:06,470 --> 03:34:06,910
Leave.

3870
03:34:09,850 --> 03:34:10,730
Go outside.

3871
03:34:14,650 --> 03:34:16,290
What are you talking about?

3872
03:34:16,450 --> 03:34:18,470
I'm just trying to figure it out.

3873
03:34:19,110 --> 03:34:19,990
Go outside.

3874
03:34:21,450 --> 03:34:22,510
I think we're done in here.

3875
03:34:23,810 --> 03:34:27,010
Why is it when I tell her to leave, she doesn't know what I'm saying to her?

3876
03:34:27,210 --> 03:34:29,350
I think it has trouble with the L's.

3877
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:32,930
I'm like...

3878
03:34:35,990 --> 03:34:36,910
We're struggling.

3879
03:34:38,450 --> 03:34:44,270
Okay, before we go... I know we have the infirmary on the other side, but before we go there, I want to go back to the Sun Suite.

3880
03:34:44,930 --> 03:34:45,630
Sun Suite.

3881
03:34:48,830 --> 03:34:50,610
Because it looks like we... Run.

3882
03:34:51,550 --> 03:34:53,870
It looks like we might have missed some stuff.

3883
03:34:55,810 --> 03:34:57,390
Japanese game after all.

3884
03:35:00,010 --> 03:35:02,730
So I have to be like... Run!

3885
03:35:06,150 --> 03:35:06,730
Nice.

3886
03:35:06,850 --> 03:35:07,010
Okay.

3887
03:35:07,710 --> 03:35:08,470
Speak in Japanese.

3888
03:35:08,590 --> 03:35:09,350
I wonder...

3889
03:35:10,530 --> 03:35:12,170
If I speak in Japanese... I don't think so.

3890
03:35:12,690 --> 03:35:13,170
Kitties!

3891
03:35:13,990 --> 03:35:16,250
Thanks for the 10 gift and thank you!

3892
03:35:17,110 --> 03:35:17,690
Bathroom.

3893
03:35:19,350 --> 03:35:20,990
Maybe it's upstairs bathroom.

3894
03:35:24,670 --> 03:35:24,870
Okay.

3895
03:35:26,510 --> 03:35:26,950
Toilet.

3896
03:35:27,070 --> 03:35:28,190
Okay, let's go upstairs.

3897
03:35:29,350 --> 03:35:30,110
Upstairs.

3898
03:35:30,610 --> 03:35:31,170
The second floor.

3899
03:35:31,410 --> 03:35:31,690
Okay.

3900
03:35:32,490 --> 03:35:32,910
Run.

3901
03:35:33,350 --> 03:35:33,870
The bed.

3902
03:35:34,090 --> 03:35:34,270
Okay.

3903
03:35:34,770 --> 03:35:34,990
Run.

3904
03:35:37,920 --> 03:35:39,270
What happened?

3905
03:35:44,030 --> 03:35:45,250
The bed.

3906
03:35:46,070 --> 03:35:46,770
Oh my god.

3907
03:35:47,330 --> 03:35:48,270
Classic real.

3908
03:35:53,930 --> 03:35:55,050
Check washroom.

3909
03:35:55,690 --> 03:35:55,890
Oh.

3910
03:35:56,870 --> 03:35:58,530
We're just leaving him.

3911
03:35:58,910 --> 03:36:00,070
Check flamethrower.

3912
03:36:01,630 --> 03:36:04,570
Yeah, this is the same as the one stored in the equipment room.

3913
03:36:04,850 --> 03:36:06,590
The fuel gauge is at zero too.

3914
03:36:08,110 --> 03:36:10,350
Can we shoot man?

3915
03:36:12,370 --> 03:36:12,970
Kill?

3916
03:36:14,070 --> 03:36:15,030
Did you say something?

3917
03:36:17,470 --> 03:36:18,470
Use gun.

3918
03:36:18,890 --> 03:36:19,130
What?

3919
03:36:19,710 --> 03:36:21,490
I should have a pillow fight with Alan?

3920
03:36:22,250 --> 03:36:23,230
That's stupid.

3921
03:36:26,370 --> 03:36:26,970
What?

3922
03:36:30,930 --> 03:36:31,390
What?

3923
03:36:36,010 --> 03:36:40,830
She's just trying to make him feel better in case he hurt over the little transceiver, you know?

3924
03:36:42,330 --> 03:36:43,850
He's like laying there quivering.

3925
03:36:44,010 --> 03:36:44,670
He's like, why?

3926
03:36:45,030 --> 03:36:45,810
Is she gonna shoot me?

3927
03:36:45,830 --> 03:36:46,430
And she's like, what?

3928
03:36:46,790 --> 03:36:47,110
No!

3929
03:36:47,430 --> 03:36:47,930
Pillow fight!

3930
03:36:50,430 --> 03:36:52,850
He's really good at pretending he's dead though.

3931
03:36:54,010 --> 03:36:54,590
Check robe.

3932
03:37:00,870 --> 03:37:02,650
Isn't he a piece of work?

3933
03:37:03,210 --> 03:37:03,410
Yeah.

3934
03:37:03,850 --> 03:37:05,150
Check robe.

3935
03:37:05,970 --> 03:37:08,590
Not him.

3936
03:37:08,690 --> 03:37:09,390
I don't care about him.

3937
03:37:09,950 --> 03:37:10,510
Robe.

3938
03:37:13,190 --> 03:37:14,090
Stop.

3939
03:37:14,550 --> 03:37:14,890
Stop!

3940
03:37:16,390 --> 03:37:17,710
Check bed.

3941
03:37:20,870 --> 03:37:21,770
Coat?

3942
03:37:21,930 --> 03:37:23,210
Instead of...

3943
03:37:23,210 --> 03:37:24,270
Coat.

3944
03:37:24,270 --> 03:37:24,770
What?

3945
03:37:26,050 --> 03:37:27,410
What else is... lab?

3946
03:37:27,570 --> 03:37:28,290
That's a... oh.

3947
03:37:28,950 --> 03:37:29,870
Lab coat.

3948
03:37:34,250 --> 03:37:36,050
And then... paper?

3949
03:37:37,870 --> 03:37:39,410
What is that down there?

3950
03:37:40,330 --> 03:37:40,770
Paper.

3951
03:37:43,910 --> 03:37:44,670
No, no, no.

3952
03:37:44,750 --> 03:37:45,090
Stop.

3953
03:37:48,170 --> 03:37:49,470
Kick Alan.

3954
03:37:49,470 --> 03:37:50,530
Forget it.

3955
03:37:50,570 --> 03:37:52,130
There's no point in sitting down.

3956
03:37:53,670 --> 03:37:53,690
Bed.

3957
03:37:56,350 --> 03:37:56,950
Spore.

3958
03:37:57,330 --> 03:37:58,410
Welcome to membership.

3959
03:37:58,630 --> 03:37:59,250
Thank you!

3960
03:38:00,630 --> 03:38:04,490
You can tell she's a Vtuber because she doesn't have backseating practice like Chad does.

3961
03:38:06,010 --> 03:38:06,870
Okay then.

3962
03:38:07,250 --> 03:38:07,930
You guys.

3963
03:38:08,470 --> 03:38:08,990
Low kick.

3964
03:38:12,030 --> 03:38:13,230
Under bed.

3965
03:38:14,450 --> 03:38:15,050
What?

3966
03:38:15,050 --> 03:38:15,190
What?

3967
03:38:16,930 --> 03:38:18,330
No.

3968
03:38:19,390 --> 03:38:20,830
Check under bed.

3969
03:38:24,790 --> 03:38:26,710
Check laptop?

3970
03:38:27,690 --> 03:38:29,250
Oh it is a laptop.

3971
03:38:29,250 --> 03:38:30,950
Excuse me?

3972
03:38:34,970 --> 03:38:37,450
What a little...

3973
03:38:37,450 --> 03:38:38,550
Take laptop.

3974
03:38:39,070 --> 03:38:39,790
The laptop?

3975
03:38:41,450 --> 03:38:42,870
I think that means no.

3976
03:38:44,030 --> 03:38:45,550
I have a backseating of utter importance.

3977
03:38:45,710 --> 03:38:48,030
Go to the sun suite, go to the washroom and check the toilet.

3978
03:38:48,430 --> 03:38:49,650
That's what I was about to do.

3979
03:38:50,250 --> 03:38:51,210
Go to bathroom.

3980
03:38:51,990 --> 03:38:52,330
Oh wait.

3981
03:38:52,730 --> 03:38:53,650
No wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3982
03:38:54,170 --> 03:38:54,610
Stop!

3983
03:38:55,310 --> 03:38:55,650
Stop!

3984
03:38:57,090 --> 03:38:58,690
Go to washroom.

3985
03:38:59,890 --> 03:39:02,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3986
03:39:03,190 --> 03:39:03,630
Okay.

3987
03:39:04,810 --> 03:39:05,770
Kick Alan's head.

3988
03:39:05,810 --> 03:39:06,290
I tried!

3989
03:39:07,310 --> 03:39:09,090
Oh, oh.

3990
03:39:09,390 --> 03:39:10,510
Check toilet.

3991
03:39:12,010 --> 03:39:12,470
Yep.

3992
03:39:14,210 --> 03:39:14,490
Yep.

3993
03:39:17,150 --> 03:39:18,650
This is not a horror game clearly.

3994
03:39:20,150 --> 03:39:21,790
Check toilet lid.

3995
03:39:24,990 --> 03:39:26,990
Put down toilet lid.

3996
03:39:29,510 --> 03:39:31,390
Check behind toilet.

3997
03:39:37,590 --> 03:39:38,230
Yippee!

3998
03:39:39,710 --> 03:39:41,170
How many of these do I have?

3999
03:39:44,010 --> 03:39:45,090
Use toilet.

4000
03:39:55,650 --> 03:39:56,690
Toilet paper.

4001
03:40:03,410 --> 03:40:05,610
How do I get the lid down?

4002
03:40:05,690 --> 03:40:06,290
What do I say?

4003
03:40:07,150 --> 03:40:08,370
The feet tapping.

4004
03:40:08,490 --> 03:40:10,070
I know she turned into Sonic the Hedgehog.

4005
03:40:10,190 --> 03:40:10,970
Check mirror.

4006
03:40:15,150 --> 03:40:15,790
Okay.

4007
03:40:17,110 --> 03:40:18,230
Close toilet.

4008
03:40:19,490 --> 03:40:19,810
Yeah.

4009
03:40:25,050 --> 03:40:25,370
Ah!

4010
03:40:25,970 --> 03:40:26,690
There we got it.

4011
03:40:27,990 --> 03:40:28,850
Spin the gun!

4012
03:40:33,490 --> 03:40:34,630
Spin the gun!

4013
03:40:37,310 --> 03:40:37,950
Stop.

4014
03:40:38,250 --> 03:40:38,630
Stop.

4015
03:40:39,650 --> 03:40:40,830
Spin the gun.

4016
03:40:42,450 --> 03:40:42,850
Stop.

4017
03:40:43,770 --> 03:40:44,730
How do I...

4018
03:40:45,190 --> 03:40:45,930
What's the command?

4019
03:40:46,830 --> 03:40:47,910
What's the command?

4020
03:40:48,630 --> 03:40:49,970
Is it only...

4021
03:40:49,970 --> 03:40:52,050
Is it only in a certain thing?

4022
03:40:52,310 --> 03:40:53,310
Spin the gun.

4023
03:40:53,770 --> 03:40:54,870
Oh, in battle!

4024
03:40:55,710 --> 03:40:56,710
Aw man.

4025
03:40:57,210 --> 03:40:58,770
We have to wait until we are in battle.

4026
03:41:01,270 --> 03:41:02,230
Hold on!

4027
03:41:08,310 --> 03:41:08,910
Okay.

4028
03:41:09,150 --> 03:41:10,370
I think we are fine for now.

4029
03:41:11,150 --> 03:41:11,750
Okay.

4030
03:41:12,070 --> 03:41:14,590
Now we...

4031
03:41:14,590 --> 03:41:15,590
Leave.

4032
03:41:16,550 --> 03:41:17,490
Go outside.

4033
03:41:19,670 --> 03:41:20,830
I can't tell.

4034
03:41:20,910 --> 03:41:22,090
There is a little bar.

4035
03:41:24,890 --> 03:41:25,490
Oh!

4036
03:41:25,490 --> 03:41:26,470
Ghost trio!

4037
03:41:29,110 --> 03:41:30,890
KRZ, thank you for the...

4038
03:41:32,830 --> 03:41:34,390
Thank you for the five...

4039
03:41:36,370 --> 03:41:37,370
Run!

4040
03:41:38,190 --> 03:41:38,910
No!

4041
03:41:39,410 --> 03:41:40,530
Go outside!

4042
03:41:42,390 --> 03:41:43,030
Run!

4043
03:41:44,130 --> 03:41:48,790
There is a little bar on the left side of the talking thing.

4044
03:41:48,870 --> 03:41:50,590
I can't really tell what it's for.

4045
03:41:51,690 --> 03:41:52,690
Gosh.

4046
03:41:57,650 --> 03:41:58,650
Infirmary.

4047
03:42:01,130 --> 03:42:02,130
Infirmary.

4048
03:42:05,310 --> 03:42:05,830
Infirmary.

4049
03:42:08,150 --> 03:42:08,290
Yeah.

4050
03:42:08,830 --> 03:42:09,350
Run.

4051
03:42:12,590 --> 03:42:13,610
Mic volume?

4052
03:42:16,350 --> 03:42:17,350
I see.

4053
03:42:17,570 --> 03:42:17,790
I see.

4054
03:42:17,950 --> 03:42:18,170
I see.

4055
03:42:19,150 --> 03:42:20,390
I forgot to save again.

4056
03:42:20,810 --> 03:42:21,490
It should be fine.

4057
03:42:22,150 --> 03:42:22,670
Hopefully.

4058
03:42:23,730 --> 03:42:25,010
Hopefully we don't die in here.

4059
03:42:32,130 --> 03:42:32,510
Yes.

4060
03:42:36,190 --> 03:42:37,610
You never get sick Rio.

4061
03:42:37,850 --> 03:42:38,410
Lucky you.

4062
03:42:44,710 --> 03:42:47,330
She runs like someone who has never ran before today.

4063
03:42:47,470 --> 03:42:47,730
I know.

4064
03:42:54,570 --> 03:42:55,050
Death.

4065
03:42:55,050 --> 03:42:55,690
Bed?

4066
03:43:01,050 --> 03:43:01,890
Alcohol.

4067
03:43:08,830 --> 03:43:10,230
Drugs.

4068
03:43:18,170 --> 03:43:20,970
Hot nurse.

4069
03:43:25,890 --> 03:43:27,370
Nimi nightmare.

4070
03:43:32,050 --> 03:43:35,410
I wish I could find hot nurses everywhere.

4071
03:43:38,570 --> 03:43:42,050
What else can you find in a...

4072
03:43:45,230 --> 03:43:46,130
Bandage.

4073
03:43:50,910 --> 03:43:53,770
Why are we playing 20 questions?

4074
03:43:55,710 --> 03:43:56,870
Um...

4075
03:43:58,610 --> 03:44:00,690
2029 sounds amazing.

4076
03:44:00,730 --> 03:44:01,570
So true.

4077
03:44:03,190 --> 03:44:03,790
Needles?

4078
03:44:07,290 --> 03:44:08,610
One more?

4079
03:44:18,700 --> 03:44:19,860
Oxygen?

4080
03:44:21,300 --> 03:44:21,860
I did?

4081
03:44:22,460 --> 03:44:23,500
No I didn't.

4082
03:44:30,720 --> 03:44:32,120
No...

4083
03:44:34,940 --> 03:44:36,340
Stethoscope.

4084
03:44:37,960 --> 03:44:38,280
What?

4085
03:44:41,800 --> 03:44:43,200
Defibrator.

4086
03:44:44,940 --> 03:44:47,160
I don't know how to say that word.

4087
03:44:48,260 --> 03:44:49,560
Doctor.

4088
03:44:53,160 --> 03:44:54,040
Yeah.

4089
03:45:01,120 --> 03:45:02,440
Oh right.

4090
03:45:03,460 --> 03:45:04,240
Chemicals.

4091
03:45:04,300 --> 03:45:05,260
What is this music?

4092
03:45:06,600 --> 03:45:07,560
What is this music?

4093
03:45:10,480 --> 03:45:13,140
It's slowly turning into peeping music.

4094
03:45:16,260 --> 03:45:16,520
Yeah.

4095
03:45:19,620 --> 03:45:21,080
What the hell is this?

4096
03:45:26,420 --> 03:45:27,200
Cocktail.

4097
03:45:28,120 --> 03:45:28,800
Cocktail.

4098
03:45:29,440 --> 03:45:32,080
The cocktail.

4099
03:45:32,240 --> 03:45:32,860
Let me speak!

4100
03:45:32,900 --> 03:45:33,600
Let me speak!

4101
03:45:33,860 --> 03:45:35,580
Let me speak!

4102
03:45:41,640 --> 03:45:42,320
Gun.

4103
03:45:49,520 --> 03:45:50,200
Grenade.

4104
03:45:59,640 --> 03:46:01,400
Molotov cocktail.

4105
03:46:04,460 --> 03:46:05,340
Yeah!

4106
03:46:06,780 --> 03:46:07,980
That's what I said!

4107
03:46:16,100 --> 03:46:17,860
Holy cannoli.

4108
03:46:18,260 --> 03:46:20,440
This game is so funny.

4109
03:46:21,480 --> 03:46:22,920
Oh my goodness.

4110
03:46:23,440 --> 03:46:24,720
There is a save point in here.

4111
03:46:24,720 --> 03:46:26,940
Let's start with...

4112
03:46:26,940 --> 03:46:27,980
Operating table.

4113
03:46:35,100 --> 03:46:36,820
It's really dark in here.

4114
03:46:36,920 --> 03:46:37,400
It's scary.

4115
03:46:37,840 --> 03:46:38,680
Operating table.

4116
03:46:39,520 --> 03:46:41,220
Why did she say it like that?

4117
03:46:41,820 --> 03:46:42,560
Operating table.

4118
03:46:42,940 --> 03:46:43,860
Literally Dora.

4119
03:46:48,360 --> 03:46:50,620
I didn't think...

4120
03:46:55,540 --> 03:46:56,860
What happened to you?

4121
03:46:57,880 --> 03:46:59,820
What happened to you?

4122
03:47:02,180 --> 03:47:03,720
Check operating table.

4123
03:47:11,360 --> 03:47:11,940
Okay.

4124
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:14,760
It's nothing.

4125
03:47:14,900 --> 03:47:17,280
You probably don't want to hear from a nice guy like me.

4126
03:47:18,280 --> 03:47:19,300
Check bed.

4127
03:47:23,240 --> 03:47:24,980
Check bed.

4128
03:47:24,980 --> 03:47:25,320
Check the bed.

4129
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:33,440
That's good I guess.

4130
03:47:37,120 --> 03:47:37,820
Alright.

4131
03:47:39,080 --> 03:47:40,560
Check desk.

4132
03:47:40,560 --> 03:47:41,140
Okay.

4133
03:47:43,600 --> 03:47:46,820
The episode of Dora where she started trauma dumping was weird.

4134
03:47:47,200 --> 03:47:48,160
Isn't that the movie?

4135
03:47:48,640 --> 03:47:50,040
That was live action, right?

4136
03:47:50,140 --> 03:47:51,700
She was like...

4137
03:47:51,700 --> 03:47:54,880
Her family was just like, why are you so strange Dora?

4138
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:56,320
Who are you talking to?

4139
03:47:57,000 --> 03:47:57,520
Monitor.

4140
03:47:59,660 --> 03:48:00,180
Yes.

4141
03:48:01,280 --> 03:48:01,800
PC.

4142
03:48:06,280 --> 03:48:07,220
Turn it on.

4143
03:48:08,260 --> 03:48:09,040
X-ray.

4144
03:48:10,560 --> 03:48:12,220
It's from an employee check up.

4145
03:48:13,260 --> 03:48:15,480
But to have someone look inside your body.

4146
03:48:16,360 --> 03:48:17,000
Not for me.

4147
03:48:17,260 --> 03:48:17,620
Thanks.

4148
03:48:18,720 --> 03:48:20,220
I mean you have to sometimes.

4149
03:48:22,260 --> 03:48:23,560
What are those?

4150
03:48:23,960 --> 03:48:24,320
Cabinet.

4151
03:48:27,360 --> 03:48:29,480
There's only anti-nausea medication.

4152
03:48:30,080 --> 03:48:30,720
Nausea.

4153
03:48:31,640 --> 03:48:32,880
What is that?

4154
03:48:33,240 --> 03:48:34,160
The thing in between.

4155
03:48:35,260 --> 03:48:35,580
Book.

4156
03:48:36,400 --> 03:48:37,280
It's already open.

4157
03:48:38,260 --> 03:48:39,040
What do you mean?

4158
03:48:39,900 --> 03:48:40,380
Huh?

4159
03:48:47,840 --> 03:48:49,400
A Japanese game.

4160
03:48:49,500 --> 03:48:50,700
Any suppositories?

4161
03:48:51,080 --> 03:48:57,760
I like to get the shiny last guys.

4162
03:48:57,960 --> 03:48:59,860
I'm trying to figure out what this thing is in the middle.

4163
03:49:02,820 --> 03:49:03,760
Check folders?

4164
03:49:05,480 --> 03:49:05,960
No.

4165
03:49:09,040 --> 03:49:09,640
Binders?

4166
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:11,720
Yeah.

4167
03:49:12,840 --> 03:49:14,980
Check medical book.

4168
03:49:15,680 --> 03:49:17,040
I even said book.

4169
03:49:18,540 --> 03:49:20,160
There's 50 million of them.

4170
03:49:25,520 --> 03:49:27,220
2029 everybody.

4171
03:49:28,460 --> 03:49:30,860
There are doctors looking up everything by book.

4172
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:32,640
Check drawer.

4173
03:49:34,420 --> 03:49:34,920
Drawer.

4174
03:49:35,640 --> 03:49:36,080
Yeah.

4175
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:40,400
We got something.

4176
03:49:40,880 --> 03:49:41,420
What is it?

4177
03:49:41,840 --> 03:49:42,300
What is that?

4178
03:49:52,620 --> 03:49:54,760
Books don't need Wi-Fi to work.

4179
03:49:54,920 --> 03:49:55,180
No.

4180
03:49:56,660 --> 03:49:57,540
You got me there.

4181
03:49:58,040 --> 03:49:59,200
That is so true.

4182
03:50:00,360 --> 03:50:02,080
Books don't need Wi-Fi to work.

4183
03:50:04,920 --> 03:50:06,000
Wrong button.

4184
03:50:06,280 --> 03:50:06,920
This one.

4185
03:50:06,920 --> 03:50:08,740
There are a lot of cases.

4186
03:50:09,140 --> 03:50:12,700
Let's start with case number one.

4187
03:50:19,060 --> 03:50:19,780
Sorry.

4188
03:50:20,460 --> 03:50:24,160
I got a little fancy.

4189
03:50:25,740 --> 03:50:26,120
Oh yeah.

4190
03:50:26,540 --> 03:50:27,740
Turn on PC.

4191
03:50:33,780 --> 03:50:34,980
Can't do it.

4192
03:50:35,260 --> 03:50:36,260
I won't do it.

4193
03:50:36,920 --> 03:50:39,420
Case one.

4194
03:50:40,300 --> 03:50:44,340
Rio is kind of unhinged.

4195
03:50:49,750 --> 03:50:51,220
You have the card.

4196
03:50:52,680 --> 03:50:54,240
Use doctor card.

4197
03:50:57,460 --> 03:50:58,720
Right.

4198
03:50:59,540 --> 03:51:01,160
Use doctor card.

4199
03:51:02,560 --> 03:51:03,840
Use doctor ID.

4200
03:51:04,840 --> 03:51:06,700
Doctor ID.

4201
03:51:08,840 --> 03:51:10,100
Use card.

4202
03:51:12,240 --> 03:51:13,640
Use ID.

4203
03:51:25,480 --> 03:51:27,220
It's not like a code or anything?

4204
03:51:27,740 --> 03:51:28,480
Switch.

4205
03:51:29,520 --> 03:51:30,180
Open.

4206
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:34,320
Yeah!

4207
03:51:34,540 --> 03:51:39,380
Everything is ours.

4208
03:51:42,140 --> 03:51:43,600
Smooth operator.

4209
03:51:45,680 --> 03:51:47,320
Smooth operator.

4210
03:51:48,960 --> 03:51:49,780
Nice.

4211
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:51,760
Let's go.

4212
03:51:53,280 --> 03:51:54,520
Can never have enough of those.

4213
03:51:57,500 --> 03:51:59,980
Oh my gosh I keep pressing...

4214
03:52:01,280 --> 03:52:02,240
OK.

4215
03:52:02,780 --> 03:52:03,080
OK.

4216
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:06,500
Case two.

4217
03:52:08,320 --> 03:52:12,000
Two drugs.

4218
03:52:12,520 --> 03:52:13,300
There's a bunch of pills.

4219
03:52:13,560 --> 03:52:14,200
Pills here.

4220
03:52:16,800 --> 03:52:17,920
Pills here.

4221
03:52:22,920 --> 03:52:25,120
This is the most riveting gameplay.

4222
03:52:26,640 --> 03:52:28,080
This is it.

4223
03:52:28,300 --> 03:52:30,260
This is the best part.

4224
03:52:30,460 --> 03:52:40,740
Oh come on!

4225
03:52:41,700 --> 03:52:43,140
Shoot mouth!

4226
03:52:44,000 --> 03:52:45,020
Run away!

4227
03:52:47,320 --> 03:52:48,720
Shoot mouth!

4228
03:52:50,080 --> 03:52:50,960
Shoot head!

4229
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:53,380
Shoot stomach!

4230
03:52:54,460 --> 03:52:55,740
Shoot stomach!

4231
03:52:56,780 --> 03:52:57,640
Nice.

4232
03:52:58,160 --> 03:52:59,040
Shoot head!

4233
03:53:00,460 --> 03:53:01,060
Oh wait.

4234
03:53:01,260 --> 03:53:01,920
Shoot mouth!

4235
03:53:03,300 --> 03:53:04,260
Shoot stomach!

4236
03:53:05,780 --> 03:53:06,140
Nice.

4237
03:53:09,460 --> 03:53:11,600
That was so smooth.

4238
03:53:12,120 --> 03:53:13,740
I forgot to spin the gun!

4239
03:53:14,680 --> 03:53:15,880
Sorry guys.

4240
03:53:15,940 --> 03:53:16,280
I forgot.

4241
03:53:17,780 --> 03:53:18,500
Case two.

4242
03:53:18,500 --> 03:53:19,500
Case two.

4243
03:53:19,860 --> 03:53:23,600
How did those get in there?

4244
03:53:26,040 --> 03:53:27,060
Why is she putting those things?

4245
03:53:27,260 --> 03:53:29,820
No pockets in her stance?

4246
03:53:30,660 --> 03:53:31,780
Don't call it that.

4247
03:53:33,880 --> 03:53:34,160
Remember.

4248
03:53:34,380 --> 03:53:35,460
Yell it next time guys.

4249
03:53:35,520 --> 03:53:35,840
I'll get it.

4250
03:53:35,880 --> 03:53:36,260
I'll get it.

4251
03:53:36,540 --> 03:53:37,320
Case three.

4252
03:53:39,760 --> 03:53:40,560
Just yell.

4253
03:53:40,680 --> 03:53:42,040
Just yell next time.

4254
03:53:42,140 --> 03:53:43,040
Just be like spin gun!

4255
03:53:43,180 --> 03:53:43,480
Spin gun!

4256
03:53:43,760 --> 03:53:44,500
You can spam it.

4257
03:53:44,540 --> 03:53:45,220
I give you permission.

4258
03:53:45,680 --> 03:53:47,000
I give you permission to spam.

4259
03:53:48,500 --> 03:53:49,600
I'll try to look over.

4260
03:53:50,720 --> 03:53:51,660
That was too fast.

4261
03:53:52,320 --> 03:53:55,140
You can turn on the PC with your controller.

4262
03:53:55,320 --> 03:53:56,200
Like how you unlock doors.

4263
03:53:56,820 --> 03:53:57,380
Really?

4264
03:53:57,660 --> 03:53:58,600
Thank you Tom.

4265
03:53:59,980 --> 03:54:02,320
I will turn it on.

4266
03:54:05,140 --> 03:54:06,040
What's that?

4267
03:54:11,020 --> 03:54:11,580
Ointment.

4268
03:54:11,760 --> 03:54:13,160
Wait there is something right there.

4269
03:54:14,440 --> 03:54:15,900
That looks like alcohol.

4270
03:54:20,020 --> 03:54:20,720
Whiskey.

4271
03:54:22,290 --> 03:54:24,700
I like the way she looks at the camera.

4272
03:54:33,880 --> 03:54:34,580
Whiskey.

4273
03:54:35,020 --> 03:54:35,400
Chug it.

4274
03:54:36,160 --> 03:54:38,540
Chug chug chug.

4275
03:54:40,180 --> 03:54:40,760
Yeah.

4276
03:54:42,500 --> 03:54:43,080
Yeah.

4277
03:54:46,980 --> 03:54:48,120
I think so.

4278
03:54:51,260 --> 03:54:53,440
I think it will do a fantastic job.

4279
03:54:53,720 --> 03:54:54,800
I think that's what they are meant to do.

4280
03:54:55,560 --> 03:55:00,640
Uh oh.

4281
03:55:05,520 --> 03:55:06,860
This isn't a movie.

4282
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:08,880
I mean...

4283
03:55:09,400 --> 03:55:10,520
Animals attack people.

4284
03:55:10,980 --> 03:55:12,460
And those live on earth.

4285
03:55:15,040 --> 03:55:16,140
What do you mean?

4286
03:55:21,300 --> 03:55:23,280
It's not a movie.

4287
03:55:23,380 --> 03:55:24,200
It's a video game.

4288
03:55:28,160 --> 03:55:28,960
Thank you.

4289
03:55:28,960 --> 03:55:29,160
Rio.

4290
03:55:29,440 --> 03:55:34,780
People attack people.

4291
03:55:34,920 --> 03:55:35,380
Exactly.

4292
03:55:38,140 --> 03:55:39,740
Rio, you are so silly girl.

4293
03:55:42,580 --> 03:55:44,220
You are so silly.

4294
03:55:44,760 --> 03:55:45,540
What was it?

4295
03:55:45,800 --> 03:55:46,060
Wait.

4296
03:55:46,820 --> 03:55:47,720
Check desk.

4297
03:55:49,860 --> 03:55:51,320
I can't with her.

4298
03:55:54,720 --> 03:55:56,780
She is so silly.

4299
03:55:57,280 --> 03:55:58,680
Okay, so the PC.

4300
03:56:00,480 --> 03:56:01,640
I got it.

4301
03:56:01,740 --> 03:56:02,220
Thank you.

4302
03:56:08,240 --> 03:56:10,780
Sorry my mouse is all stuffed up.

4303
03:56:16,100 --> 03:56:19,100
Oh we unlocked the sexy pose.

4304
03:56:19,740 --> 03:56:20,140
Oh no.

4305
03:56:20,200 --> 03:56:20,880
Look at the membership.

4306
03:56:21,360 --> 03:56:22,020
Oh my gosh.

4307
03:56:22,040 --> 03:56:23,300
No wonder she wouldn't do it before.

4308
03:56:23,400 --> 03:56:25,160
We just never had it unlocked.

4309
03:56:25,160 --> 03:56:26,680
Sexy pose.

4310
03:56:27,900 --> 03:56:28,620
No.

4311
03:56:29,480 --> 03:56:30,820
No absolutely not ma'am.

4312
03:56:31,060 --> 03:56:31,980
Sexy pose.

4313
03:56:33,360 --> 03:56:33,640
Go.

4314
03:56:35,580 --> 03:56:35,940
Leave.

4315
03:56:36,080 --> 03:56:36,500
Go outside.

4316
03:56:37,680 --> 03:56:38,320
Go outside.

4317
03:56:39,320 --> 03:56:39,620
Yes.

4318
03:56:42,740 --> 03:56:43,620
Stop.

4319
03:56:44,520 --> 03:56:45,500
Sexy pose.

4320
03:56:46,720 --> 03:56:50,100
Oh my god.

4321
03:56:50,520 --> 03:56:50,820
Zoom.

4322
03:56:50,820 --> 03:56:51,760
Zoom.

4323
03:56:52,680 --> 03:56:53,520
Zoom.

4324
03:56:54,600 --> 03:56:55,440
Zoom.

4325
03:56:57,680 --> 03:56:58,520
Sexy...

4326
03:56:58,520 --> 03:56:59,920
Sexy pose.

4327
03:56:59,960 --> 03:57:00,300
Hold on.

4328
03:57:00,700 --> 03:57:01,560
Order of operations.

4329
03:57:02,040 --> 03:57:02,820
Sexy pose.

4330
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:05,000
Zoom.

4331
03:57:05,460 --> 03:57:05,740
Zoom.

4332
03:57:06,160 --> 03:57:06,400
Zoom.

4333
03:57:06,820 --> 03:57:12,020
Okay we have two other cases we can check.

4334
03:57:12,640 --> 03:57:13,580
Case four.

4335
03:57:13,580 --> 03:57:14,600
Case four.

4336
03:57:14,920 --> 03:57:15,160
Okay.

4337
03:57:17,860 --> 03:57:19,060
It is.

4338
03:57:19,100 --> 03:57:19,660
It is.

4339
03:57:19,700 --> 03:57:20,680
It is Marine.

4340
03:57:22,500 --> 03:57:24,560
It really is.

4341
03:57:25,400 --> 03:57:28,940
Where are you?

4342
03:57:30,580 --> 03:57:31,760
That's Marine pose.

4343
03:57:31,760 --> 03:57:33,420
Now you can disengage the locks.

4344
03:57:41,840 --> 03:57:42,580
Marines.

4345
03:57:44,840 --> 03:57:45,900
Oh no.

4346
03:57:46,020 --> 03:57:46,240
Okay.

4347
03:57:47,320 --> 03:57:48,020
It's only one.

4348
03:57:48,080 --> 03:57:48,400
We're good.

4349
03:57:50,600 --> 03:57:51,780
Spin gun.

4350
03:57:55,000 --> 03:57:55,740
Mouth.

4351
03:57:57,020 --> 03:57:57,740
Mouth.

4352
03:57:58,100 --> 03:57:58,480
Mouth.

4353
03:57:58,940 --> 03:57:59,340

4354
03:58:00,300 --> 03:58:01,140
Mouth.

4355
03:58:01,520 --> 03:58:01,940
Mouth.

4356
03:58:02,260 --> 03:58:02,880
Stomach.

4357
03:58:03,360 --> 03:58:04,200

4358
03:58:05,560 --> 03:58:06,140
Stomach.

4359
03:58:07,660 --> 03:58:08,080
Stomach.

4360
03:58:09,100 --> 03:58:10,800
Oh there is more than one.

4361
03:58:10,940 --> 03:58:11,280
Oh my god.

4362
03:58:11,480 --> 03:58:11,880
Stomach.

4363
03:58:13,020 --> 03:58:13,600
Stomach.

4364
03:58:14,860 --> 03:58:15,400

4365
03:58:16,120 --> 03:58:16,960

4366
03:58:19,220 --> 03:58:19,640
Stomach.

4367
03:58:20,420 --> 03:58:21,260
No.

4368
03:58:21,520 --> 03:58:22,000

4369
03:58:23,480 --> 03:58:24,320
Stomach.

4370
03:58:24,320 --> 03:58:25,160

4371
03:58:25,580 --> 03:58:25,940

03:58:26,100 --> 03:58:26,480
Stomach.

4373
03:58:26,480 --> 03:58:28,000
Oh my god.

4374
03:58:28,040 --> 03:58:28,340
Please.

4375
03:58:28,680 --> 03:58:29,120
Run away.

4376
03:58:30,800 --> 03:58:32,880
I already spin the gun you guys.

4377
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:33,380
Stomach.

4378
03:58:34,240 --> 03:58:35,120

4383
03:58:44,580 --> 03:58:45,460
Stomach.

4384
03:58:46,140 --> 03:58:47,020
Stomach.

4385
03:58:48,920 --> 03:58:49,800
Stomach.

4386
03:58:50,740 --> 03:58:51,280
Stomach.

4387
03:58:52,340 --> 03:58:53,080
There we go.

4388
03:58:53,700 --> 03:58:54,060
Run.

4389
03:58:54,060 --> 03:58:54,180
Run.

4390
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:56,260
Run.

4391
03:58:57,340 --> 03:58:58,380
In her mouth.

4392
03:58:58,880 --> 03:58:59,920
In her mouth.

4393
03:59:00,500 --> 03:59:01,160
Run.

4394
03:59:02,040 --> 03:59:02,700
Run.

4395
03:59:04,480 --> 03:59:04,920
Run.

4396
03:59:05,760 --> 03:59:07,320
In her mouth.

4397
03:59:07,780 --> 03:59:08,820
In her mouth.

4398
03:59:09,260 --> 03:59:10,320
In her mouth.

4399
03:59:11,000 --> 03:59:11,660
In her mouth.

4400
03:59:11,660 --> 03:59:12,080
In her mouth.

4401
03:59:12,560 --> 03:59:13,460
Oh my

4402
03:59:16,850 --> 03:59:19,070
god.

4403
03:59:19,270 --> 03:59:19,450
Please.

4404
03:59:20,290 --> 03:59:21,090
In her mouth.

4405
03:59:21,890 --> 03:59:22,290
No.

4406
03:59:23,130 --> 03:59:23,890
In her mouth.

4407
03:59:24,890 --> 03:59:25,810
Mouth!

4408
03:59:26,690 --> 03:59:27,150
Mouth!

4409
03:59:27,590 --> 03:59:28,510
Mouth!

4410
03:59:28,970 --> 03:59:29,730
Run!

4411
03:59:30,390 --> 03:59:30,910
Oh my gosh.

4412
03:59:31,390 --> 03:59:31,710
Mouth!

4413
03:59:32,550 --> 03:59:32,950
Dodge!

4414
03:59:33,930 --> 03:59:34,370
Dodge!

4415
03:59:37,200 --> 03:59:38,120
Head!

4416
03:59:38,660 --> 03:59:39,580
Stomach!

4417
03:59:40,460 --> 03:59:41,200
Stomach!

4418
03:59:41,980 --> 03:59:42,900
Stomach!

4419
03:59:43,700 --> 03:59:44,340
Stomach!

4420
03:59:44,660 --> 03:59:45,100
Stomach!

4421
03:59:45,240 --> 03:59:45,640
Mouth!

4422
03:59:46,020 --> 03:59:46,840
I mean, head!

4423
03:59:46,960 --> 03:59:47,140
Run!

4424
03:59:48,140 --> 03:59:48,680
Kick!

4425
03:59:49,560 --> 03:59:50,160
Low kick!

4426
03:59:51,800 --> 03:59:52,320
Run!

4427
03:59:54,300 --> 03:59:55,280
Guys!

4428
03:59:55,660 --> 03:59:56,180
Stomach!

4429
03:59:56,680 --> 03:59:57,660
Stomach!

4430
03:59:58,080 --> 03:59:59,000
Stomach!

4431
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:02,100
Stomach!

4432
04:00:03,000 --> 04:00:03,560
Stomach!

4433
04:00:04,800 --> 04:00:05,240
Run!

4434
04:00:08,210 --> 04:00:09,240
Not over him!

4435
04:00:09,420 --> 04:00:09,860
Stomach!

4436
04:00:10,880 --> 04:00:11,460
Stomach!

4437
04:00:12,820 --> 04:00:13,280
Stomach!

4438
04:00:14,320 --> 04:00:14,740
Stomach!

4439
04:00:15,340 --> 04:00:16,320
Stomach!

4440
04:00:16,720 --> 04:00:17,680
Stomach!

4441
04:00:18,000 --> 04:00:18,440
Stomach!

4442
04:00:18,520 --> 04:00:19,160
OK, run!

4443
04:00:20,560 --> 04:00:22,100
In her mouth!

4444
04:00:25,700 --> 04:00:26,780
Dodge!

4445
04:00:28,720 --> 04:00:29,140
Dodge!

4446
04:00:30,300 --> 04:00:30,880
In her mouth!

4447
04:00:32,800 --> 04:00:33,940
In her mouth!

4448
04:00:35,460 --> 04:00:40,100
In her mouth!

4449
04:00:40,100 --> 04:00:42,100
In her mouth!

4450
04:00:48,400 --> 04:00:49,120
Oh,

4451
04:00:53,700 --> 04:00:54,300
says you!

4452
04:00:54,660 --> 04:00:55,720
Says you, Rio!

4453
04:00:55,880 --> 04:00:57,620
Your freaking aim!

4454
04:01:03,780 --> 04:01:05,080
In her mouth.

4455
04:01:05,660 --> 04:01:06,440
My goodness.

4456
04:01:08,460 --> 04:01:09,460
Oh my gosh.

4457
04:01:11,540 --> 04:01:17,720
I think you can only say tongue when the tongue is out, but the timing is so difficult.

4458
04:01:20,100 --> 04:01:24,080
Thank you for not saying number 2 in her mouth.

4459
04:01:25,880 --> 04:01:27,260
Case 5.

4460
04:01:28,900 --> 04:01:30,240
Case 5.

4461
04:01:32,520 --> 04:01:33,820
Case 5.

4462
04:01:34,820 --> 04:01:38,940
In whose mouth?

4463
04:01:41,140 --> 04:01:42,180
Oh my goodness.

4464
04:01:56,400 --> 04:01:58,360
You guys are terrible.

4465
04:01:59,320 --> 04:02:00,960
You are all terrible, you know that?

4466
04:02:03,540 --> 04:02:04,260
Stinky!

4467
04:02:12,180 --> 04:02:14,380
I need the throat tea.

4468
04:02:20,020 --> 04:02:20,560
Nice.

4469
04:02:22,860 --> 04:02:25,260
That should be maybe the fourth one.

4470
04:02:27,220 --> 04:02:27,680
OK.

4471
04:02:29,280 --> 04:02:33,020
Have Rio take the monster out to dinner before you shoot it in her mouth.

4472
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:36,480
It was...no.

4473
04:02:37,640 --> 04:02:38,260
It was here.

4474
04:02:39,860 --> 04:02:42,100
Oh, we need one more for the second fourth one.

4475
04:02:42,500 --> 04:02:42,780
Nice.

4476
04:02:42,880 --> 04:02:44,340
And we have 4 heal capsules.

4477
04:02:44,900 --> 04:02:47,900
I feel like we should use one, but...

4478
04:02:50,060 --> 04:02:51,320
She's just walking around.

4479
04:02:51,560 --> 04:02:52,640
Did you guys see the gun spin?

4480
04:02:52,700 --> 04:02:52,900
No?

4481
04:02:52,940 --> 04:02:53,680
She did it twice.

4482
04:02:54,700 --> 04:02:55,180
Nice!

4483
04:02:55,440 --> 04:02:56,140
Welcome to membership.

4484
04:02:56,400 --> 04:02:56,680
Thank you.

4485
04:02:57,180 --> 04:02:57,660
Alright.

4486
04:02:58,180 --> 04:02:59,380
What's the place called?

4487
04:03:01,140 --> 04:03:02,100
Save point.

4488
04:03:08,180 --> 04:03:11,260
You're the one who yelled sex and Rio ran to the bed.

4489
04:03:11,900 --> 04:03:17,660
OK, saying I yelled sex is a bit of a...

4490
04:03:17,660 --> 04:03:21,180
I think that's a bit of a drama adaptation, don't you think?

4491
04:03:21,620 --> 04:03:24,420
I think that's a bit...

4492
04:03:28,380 --> 04:03:30,340
I said...

4493
04:03:30,340 --> 04:03:32,980
I didn't demand anything.

4494
04:03:33,260 --> 04:03:34,960
Look, she's traumatized.

4495
04:03:35,300 --> 04:03:38,180
Well guys, I think I'm gonna end it here actually.

4496
04:03:39,700 --> 04:03:41,460
Oh my goodness, it's already been 4 hours.

4497
04:03:41,880 --> 04:03:44,200
4 hours of Lifeline.

4498
04:03:44,720 --> 04:03:46,520
Goodness gracious this game.

4499
04:03:49,920 --> 04:03:51,200
I feel...

4500
04:03:51,200 --> 04:03:54,120
I don't know how I stood it for this long.

4501
04:03:55,420 --> 04:03:58,160
But this has been a lot of fun.

4502
04:03:59,820 --> 04:04:02,000
Please play for 37 hours.

4503
04:04:02,200 --> 04:04:03,520
No, please.

4504
04:04:06,500 --> 04:04:07,620
Thank you for the stream.

4505
04:04:07,740 --> 04:04:08,700
Thank you!

4506
04:04:10,180 --> 04:04:10,700
Spank!

4507
04:04:10,780 --> 04:04:11,680
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

4508
04:04:12,180 --> 04:04:12,880
Thank you!

4509
04:04:13,040 --> 04:04:14,300
Different kind of rage game.

4510
04:04:14,380 --> 04:04:15,180
For real.

4511
04:04:15,400 --> 04:04:16,500
Holy moly.

4512
04:04:17,220 --> 04:04:18,380
But this game is so silly.

4513
04:04:20,240 --> 04:04:25,020
The Marine pose is funny because Senchou actually played the JP version of this years ago.

4514
04:04:25,120 --> 04:04:25,920
No way!

4515
04:04:26,220 --> 04:04:26,620
Seriously?

4516
04:04:27,500 --> 04:04:28,560
Sexy pose, baby.

4517
04:04:29,680 --> 04:04:30,800
Sexy pose!

4518
04:04:32,500 --> 04:04:33,700
Thanks so much, Minto.

4519
04:04:37,200 --> 04:04:41,360
She looks like she's in like a psych ward.

4520
04:04:42,000 --> 04:04:42,440
It's OK.

4521
04:04:42,520 --> 04:04:43,220
You're alright, Ryo.

4522
04:04:43,340 --> 04:04:43,800
You're OK.

4523
04:04:44,420 --> 04:04:45,060
Thanks for the one stream.

4524
04:04:45,160 --> 04:04:45,800
Thank you!

4525
04:04:46,460 --> 04:04:47,900
I had a lot of fun.

4526
04:04:54,600 --> 04:04:57,360
Tomorrow's stream is a bit of a different case.

4527
04:04:58,800 --> 04:05:01,200
Doki and I are going to be like...

4528
04:05:01,200 --> 04:05:03,160
We're co-casting this tournament.

4529
04:05:07,540 --> 04:05:08,940
It's like a MOBA.

4530
04:05:09,900 --> 04:05:10,680
But Minecraft.

4531
04:05:11,220 --> 04:05:12,480
It's kind of weird.

4532
04:05:12,480 --> 04:05:14,460
So tomorrow is going to be a little bit different.

4533
04:05:14,640 --> 04:05:16,520
I'm probably not going to be able to talk with chat much.

4534
04:05:17,100 --> 04:05:18,660
I might do a stream...

4535
04:05:18,660 --> 04:05:21,740
I don't know.

4536
04:05:22,240 --> 04:05:25,640
Oh no, but I want to watch the birthday live.

4537
04:05:29,720 --> 04:05:30,860
I don't know.

4538
04:05:31,420 --> 04:05:33,200
I'll see you Sunday if not.

4539
04:05:33,380 --> 04:05:34,740
Or if you can't watch Sunday.

4540
04:05:34,860 --> 04:05:35,280
I'll see you Monday.

4541
04:05:35,340 --> 04:05:36,640
Can you hear me?

4542
04:05:37,480 --> 04:05:39,280
Oh gosh, Ryo is really losing it.

4543
04:05:42,100 --> 04:05:43,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4544
04:05:49,520 --> 04:05:50,580
It's going to be a little weird.

4545
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:54,040
I'm not quite sure how to think of it either.

4546
04:05:54,400 --> 04:05:55,580
But it should be fun, I think.

4547
04:05:58,020 --> 04:05:59,640
But this was a lot of fun too.

4548
04:05:59,880 --> 04:06:03,300
And thank you guys for watching and sticking around and hanging out with me.

4549
04:06:04,480 --> 04:06:05,280
Thank you, Ryo!

4550
04:06:05,280 --> 04:06:09,040
Thank you.

4551
04:06:09,580 --> 04:06:11,360
Oh gosh, she's so rude.

4552
04:06:22,420 --> 04:06:23,940
Thank you!

4553
04:06:24,320 --> 04:06:24,820
No.

4554
04:06:29,420 --> 04:06:29,740
No.

4555
04:06:32,500 --> 04:06:33,460
Who's cat is this?

4556
04:06:34,520 --> 04:06:35,260
Otsumito everyone!

4557
04:06:35,380 --> 04:06:35,860
Thank you!
