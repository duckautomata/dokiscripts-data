1
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,050
Wah wah.

2
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,170
Wah wah.

3
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,650
All aboard!

4
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,610
Hello everybody.

5
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,190
I look a little dark, huh?

6
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm trying something new today.

7
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,410
I'm trying a more atmospheric...

8
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,770
vibe.

9
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,410
Trying a more...

10
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,150
atmosphere.

11
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,870
Trying a more atmospheric vibe.

12
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,490
Hello, hello, hello.

13
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,270
You alright?

14
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,730
I'm trying to think.

15
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,710
I'm trying to think.

16
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,030
Anyways, welcome back to Jurassic World.

17
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,750
Yippee!

18
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,310
Yippee!

19
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,750
I've been wanting to play this game...

20
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,050
for...

21
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,230
so long.

22
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,070
We're off to Cap'n...

23
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,970
Well, let's see how this works.

24
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,910
Oh, I'm darker.

25
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,270
Let's see.

26
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,410
See?

27
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:20,870
See?

28
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,770
It kind of works.

29
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,990
It kind of works.

30
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,650
One year!

31
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,330
Wah wah wah.

32
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,670
Wishing I was fishing.

33
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,490
Thank you for one year!

34
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,550
So...

35
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,150
This music, I can't think over it.

36
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,330
I...

37
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,150
I...

38
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,750
Someone told me...

39
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,070
last time.

40
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,930
They were like, I think you should do the icy area because...

41
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,270
you can beat the game and forget about the icy area.

42
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,070
And I was like, I paid for that!

43
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,170
I paid for that, so...

44
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,230
What is the one year badge?

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,990
That's a great question, Mr. YumYum.

46
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,390
Let me show you.

47
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,730
Hold on, where do I have it saved?

48
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,750
Oh, I have it saved here.

49
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,150
Here!

50
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,670
If you have the one year Mamboo badge...

51
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,170
you are officially...

52
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,710
the Jorker.

53
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,010
Number one.

54
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,550
We do...

55
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,470
Well, I don't live.

56
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,990
I exist.

57
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,750
Technically.

58
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,470
In a society.

59
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,810
Oh man, I can't wait.

60
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,070
Yeah, you too!

61
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,970
You can beat the Jorker.

62
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,510
I don't remember why Snake is there.

63
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,690
Why did I include him?

64
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,670
Probably because I love him.

65
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,170
So, yeah.

66
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,630
I'm a what now?

67
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,850
Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,550
Congratulations.

69
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,130
So, I think what I want to do is rest.

70
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,770
And then I think what I want to do is go to the icy area.

71
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,630
I think.

72
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,410
Is what I want to do.

73
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,630
And see what we can do...

74
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,450
in the ice.

75
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,430
He was number one.

76
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,870
Thank you guys!

77
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,590
Wow, thank you so much.

78
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,450
Thank you, thank you.

79
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,090
Really appreciate all the...

80
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,190
All the 12 monthers.

81
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,690
Captain Minton, huh?

82
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,490
Or the moon.

83
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,370
Otherwise, I don't even...

84
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,410
I don't remember what we did last time.

85
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,870
So, we're just gonna...

86
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,810
Let's go figure it out.

87
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,910
This game has so much going on.

88
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,870
I always have to...

89
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,050
Remind myself what we're doing.

90
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,550
Wait.

91
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,730
Oh, I just need to go down.

92
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,910
Wait, what is this?

93
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,870
Why is there a big old white spot on my...

94
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,710
It's Jork.

95
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,750
It's Jork!

96
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,390
Jork!

97
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,570
I think last game was Mother Base Upgrades.

98
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:23,630
Hmm.

99
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,410
Bald.

100
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,790
Why is it bald there?

101
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,850
Probably one of the rigged boxes.

102
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,810
Maybe.

103
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,330
That's so...

104
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:40,910
Peculiar.

105
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,670
Okay, we need to go south.

106
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,490
How would you feel about someone getting a tattoo?

107
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,830
Inspired by me?

108
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,250
That's a little permanent though.

109
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,830
If you cut off your arm...

110
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,850
Or wherever you got it...

111
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,030
Then...

112
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,090
You could forget.

113
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,870
13 more days till I'm a Jorker.

114
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,750
Don't cry!

115
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,210
I'll reach the Jork point someday.

116
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,490
I believe in you!

117
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,930
Laser.

118
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,670
Laser.

119
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,130
Laser.

120
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,450
That's how you choose to take off your arm?

121
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,070
With a laser?

122
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,710
Oh, why do I not have my...

123
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,550
Hold on.

124
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,410
No, just kidding.

125
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,150
My trawl net.

126
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,330
Oh, we have the siphon trawl.

127
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,250
I messed up.

128
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,270
It's fine.

129
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,690
We can siphon trawl here, I guess.

130
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,190
Laser.

131
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,710
The laser explodes the tattoo.

132
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,690
They mean the tattoo.

133
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,690
Yeah, that's what I was talking about also.

134
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,050
Oh, we're red!

135
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,910
How do you guys... How do we feel in the atmosphere?

136
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,830
Lighting.

137
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,510
It's a little different from normal.

138
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,710
But I felt like this is the type of game for it, no?

139
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,350
Don't run into the...

140
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,290
Are we gooping?

141
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,430
Just a tad.

142
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,770
Just a tad.

143
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,430
I'm gonna go sleep in there anyway, so...

144
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,830
Collecting some goop.

145
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,690
Sleep in the goop?

146
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,430
What would we wake up with, I wonder.

147
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,110
I feel like we'd wake up with something horrible.

148
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,910
Okay.

149
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:42,990
Alright.

150
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,230
Goop has been...

151
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,470
Properly, thoroughly...

152
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,030
Scooped.

153
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,790
Let's get some... I don't remember if we needed any of this stuff either.

154
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,570
But...

155
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,590
I'll grab it.

156
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,270
Why not?

157
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,720
Oh, slopped up.

158
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,280
I need a shower.

159
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,820
Oh, oh.

160
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,520
The night cometh.

161
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,560
I'm stuck.

162
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,440
Why does it sound so scary?

163
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm gonna have my light on.

164
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,930
On stream?

165
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,230
I don't think so.

166
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,650
I don't think I'll shower on stream.

167
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,450
I don't think I'll do that.

168
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,350
Aw, dang.

169
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,410
Guys, how do you know when something is black mold?

170
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,570
Is my other question.

171
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,890
I might have it.

172
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,130
In my...

173
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,270
In my bathroom.

174
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,270
How do you know when something is a black mold?

175
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,410
Is it humid?

176
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,970
Yeah.

177
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,090
Huh?

178
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,950
Oh, do I have room for all that?

179
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,170
I guess so.

180
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,910
Rub it in your face.

181
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,270
Okay.

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,860
Not all black mold is black mold.

183
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,440
I hope it's not.

184
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,660
I took some pictures of it today and I'm gonna say...

185
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,740
You know, well, it's like...

186
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,240
I don't know...

187
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,040
I mean, I know it's like an abandoned maid cafe and all that, but it's like...

188
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,840
I don't know.

189
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,660
Like...

190
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,580
I don't know.

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,300
I just...

192
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,980
I just hope it's not, you know, bad.

193
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,740
I hope they'll clean it.

194
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,020
My place is abandoned, but I'm still here.

195
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,220
We have patrons.

196
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,040
You guys...

197
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,180
Don't go into my bathroom.

198
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,020
Can we see the mold pictures for science?

199
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,780
No.

200
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,860
Grow white mold to cancel it out.

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,140
Then they'll have grey mold babies.

202
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,640
Black mold tastes like wet dirt and metal.

203
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,660
Really?

204
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,460
Wait, actually?

205
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,520
Okay, I'm gonna sell my fish.

206
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Make some money.

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,200
Maybe.

208
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,460
I can't remember what we've been trying to do.

209
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,640
Let's see.

210
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,320
I'm just looking around at stuff.

211
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,840
Did I...

212
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,980
I can't tell if down here is another...

213
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Engine spot or not.

214
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,220
It is.

215
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,500
Repair everything?

216
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,600
I don't know what we're repairing.

217
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,860
We're gonna take off this net.

218
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,060
Uninstall.

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Store.

220
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,980
I already took the thingies out.

221
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
Took these out, so we're good.

222
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,940
We got two more.

223
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,120
One whole year of Mito Kawaii.

224
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,740
Wow.

225
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,380
You can't go?

226
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:21,960
Jersey.

227
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,360
Eat the mold.

228
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,420
Don't taste the mold.

229
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,920
Too late.

230
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,960
You're upgrading the iron rig with your rods.

231
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,920
Thank you!

232
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

233
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

234
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,250
What do I wanna...

235
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,530
Let's see, let's replace it with our heavy duty trawl.

236
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,070
Wait.

237
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,690
Yeah!

238
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,130
Oh, what's this?

239
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,830
Oh no.

240
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,610
That's rot.

241
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,170
Wait.

242
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,990
Some people said to keep the rot.

243
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,890
Oh, soothing tea.

244
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,950
So many new Jorkers this stream.

245
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,630
I know!

246
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,210
What do you mean, too late?

247
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,530
I don't know if I told you guys this, but not too long ago...

248
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,670
A couple months ago, I'd say...

249
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,290
A pipe burst?

250
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,870
And a bunch of water came through my ceiling.

251
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,890
In my bathroom.

252
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,870
And...

253
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:38,930
They put a dehumidifier in my bathroom, but I think there might be mold in the walls.

254
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,390
So...

255
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,610
I thought it was just the sink.

256
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,170
Nah.

257
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,870
That was different.

258
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:53,830
Yeah.

259
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,810
Yeah.

260
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,290
And they keep...

261
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,210
They're like, hey, do you wanna renew your lease?

262
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,650
And I'm like, well...

263
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,050
I kinda wanna leave, but I don't have anywhere else to go.

264
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,390
I have to decide within a week.

265
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,170
Are you cursed?

266
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,270
I didn't know it.

267
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,160
So...

268
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,780
Where do I go?

269
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,700
I don't have anywhere to go.

270
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,180
I have nowhere to move to.

271
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,980
I can't just be like, okay, bye.

272
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,800
I mean, I guess I could say I'm not renewing my lease and then find a place before...

273
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,400
But moving is so bad.

274
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,300
I don't have time to move.

275
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,480
There's only so many abandoned maid cafes that I can go to.

276
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,720
Actually, pink mold tastes like strawberries.

277
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,860
Wait, I'm having a sense of deja vu.

278
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,300
That sometimes grows in my bathtub.

279
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,620
Moving with Mata.

280
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,660
Short, hairy bloke.

281
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,040
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

282
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,820
Thank you.

283
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,870
I have so many issues.

284
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,010
Many issues.

285
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,090
Let's see.

286
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,930
Let's do...

287
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,210
More fish.

288
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,450
I think we need that more than materials.

289
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,100
Okay.

290
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,540
Cool.

291
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,440
We sleep for...

292
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,300
It's daylight.

293
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,180
Let's just keep going.

294
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,560
I think I'm going to be a little crazy, but that's alright.

295
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,820
Cool.

296
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,500
We're heading south.

297
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,820
Onward!

298
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,540
That must be it, no?

299
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:08,580
No?

300
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,380
Yeah.

301
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
Oh, my thingy.

302
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,880
Moving sucks, but living with worsening mold isn't good for your health either.

303
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,620
Wait, I hope things work out.

304
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,540
Thanks!

305
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,280
Me too!

306
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm a ghost though.

307
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,060
I don't know.

308
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm more worried about the patrons.

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,800
She has no body to move in with.

310
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Maybe the mold will...

311
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
I don't know.

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,540
Make me a little...

313
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,940
To prevent mold, you should leave your bathroom...

314
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,440
What?

315
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,480
Sorry, I missed it.

316
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,580
I leave my bathroom door open...

317
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,600
You!

318
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,640
You came out of nowhere!

319
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,260
Oh, my god.

320
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,120
That stinks!

321
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,240
That stinks!

322
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,720
Oh, my god!

323
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,810
Leaving the door open works too?

324
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,050
Yeah, I don't think the fan works very well in mine.

325
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,170
Okay, let's try and get the...

326
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,630
We need to break this ice.

327
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,010
Icy works.

328
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,630
To build a new icebreaker, there are the parts you need.

329
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,610
Oh, where do I get these?

330
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,960
Do you have them?

331
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,910
The last part meant my unit caught fire!

332
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,630
The fire department flooded all the way down five floors!

333
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,350
Luckily, I moved my stuff out the day before.

334
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,150
Oh, my god!

335
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,170
That's so scary!

336
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,620
What the...

337
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,820
Wait, how do I get this?

338
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,920
How do I get the icebreaker?

339
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,400
Plow.

340
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,560
I think maybe this is where I...

341
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,460
Um...

342
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm lost.

343
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,300
Go out and explore.

344
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,400
Is it in here?

345
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,760
Let's check inside here.

346
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,100
Like these, I can't break through.

347
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,450
Can I fish this?

348
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,290
Ice.

349
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,350
I need ice.

350
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,730
Can you give us your best line you use to break ice?

351
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:55,870
Ha.

352
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,610
Ha.

353
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,530
Hey.

354
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,130
It's a foreshore inn.

355
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,450
Do I need ice?

356
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,510
I think I need an ice rod.

357
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,850
Alright, let's go back.

358
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,670
You just gotta play it cool.

359
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,670
If you're just like, I'm playing it cool...

360
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,650
You could say, I am the ice.

361
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,880
Ice!

362
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,260
Barbed ice rod.

363
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,240
Maybe we'll do...

364
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,500
This one's cheaper.

365
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,640
This one's cheaper.

366
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,220
Cause we're gonna have to get this eventually for infuse, no?

367
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,980
Ice, ice, baby, minky.

368
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,880
We know your line is Pokemon names translated.

369
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,410
That's not an ice... Well, yes.

370
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,050
Isn't that, I guess, maybe technically an icebreaker?

371
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,050
But like, the first thing you say...

372
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,410
But no, that is my thing.

373
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,750
But that only works in Japan.

374
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,330
If you're just like, hey, do you know what Pikachu is in English?

375
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,250
Pikachu.

376
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,270
Do you know what Fushigidane is in English?

377
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,830
Bulbasaur.

378
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,650
And then they're like...

379
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,910
And then you're like, yeah, and...

380
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,790
What's another one?

381
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,510
I

382
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,810
don't remember anymore.

383
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,890
She's fumbling.

384
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,690
Wait!

385
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,110
I forgot all of them.

386
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,690
Lizardon.

387
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,250
Oh, that's... Yeah, you could be like Charizard.

388
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,910
Lizard... No, opposite.

389
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,410
Liz... Maybe you could do this in English too, but I think everybody would think you're so lame.

390
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,410
I don't think they would care very much.

391
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,430
I don't think... They'd be like, oh, okay.

392
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,970
You could be like Gengar.

393
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,450
Gengar.

394
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,250
Why are some of them changed and some of them aren't?

395
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,610
The Pokemon Orthworm is...

396
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,110
Shlurm.

397
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,390
Hope you guys... I love the videos of like...

398
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,510
Of like...

399
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,130
The way Pokemon sound in other languages.

400
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,150
Like...

401
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,750
Install.

402
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,210
Like the Goldeen clip.

403
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,510
She's like...

404
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,810
Well, I don't wanna say it.

405
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,970
Look it up yourself.

406
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,170
Look up French Goldeen.

407
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,510
This game makes the same creaky sounds all the doors of my house makes.

408
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,430
Oh my gosh, it's...

409
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,370
Kinda creepy.

410
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,080
I don't even know what we're gonna do in this area.

411
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Let's get some ice fish.

412
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,620
That's what we're gonna do in the area.

413
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,180
Wow!

414
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,080
Wow, it's literal ice fish.

415
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,420
That's a snake.

416
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you sure the maids don't just think you're cute?

417
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,800
I don't think so.

418
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,840
Cause I'm not.

419
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
I'm scary spooky.

420
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,140
Trophy.

421
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,840
I'm creepy crawly.

422
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,340
How many ice fish are there?

423
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,840
Oh my god.

424
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,980
I think we have a problem with too many ice fish.

425
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,300
How many are there?

426
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
Medium stock still?

427
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm gonna have the most ice fish anybody has ever obtained.

428
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,200
Before ever.

429
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,300
In the world.

430
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,880
There's so many.

431
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,110
I don't think it's possible to make them go extinct.

432
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,490
Uh oh.

433
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,390
I made them go extinct.

434
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,820
Kowakawa.

435
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,400
Shut up.

436
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,780
Can I get some money for this?

437
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,020
And they're extinct.

438
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,140
How much were they worth?

439
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,500
Not much.

440
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,720
Thank you.

441
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,100
Undock.

442
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,960
Let's go around and see if we can find any more parts.

443
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,410
Now that we can fish.

444
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,190
There's gonna be some parts.

445
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,730
Wait a second.

446
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,490
Is this a crab?

447
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,610
That's not a crab.

448
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,630
I'm gonna place my hand on the stone.

449
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,490
It does not respond to my touch.

450
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,100
I see no reason why spooky, scary and cute would be mutually exclusive.

451
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,960
Most people... Wait, what's that over there?

452
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,520
Most people would think so.

453
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,220
Are one or the other?

454
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,020
Can we go in here?

455
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,220
No.

456
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,260
I wanna know what that is.

457
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,240
If anybody has played this, can I get a hint?

458
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,280
I don't know how to stink and find these parts.

459
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,220
Is this a crab?

460
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,000
Please don't be a crab.

461
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,240
Please be real.

462
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,480
Oh, this is a man.

463
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,620
Dang it.

464
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,260
I prefer the crab.

465
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,860
Go inside.

466
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,060
I can't.

467
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,080
I don't have ice.

468
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,420
The ice thing.

469
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,860
To break it.

470
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,790
What the hell is that?

471
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,770
Aberrated ice fish.

472
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,210
Okay, I don't have that.

473
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,730
Hi.

474
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,970
I can't go inside.

475
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,030
Wait.

476
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,950
That just looks like some scrap, but I'll check it anyway.

477
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,190
Just scrap.

478
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,670
It was back near the pontoon.

479
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,610
Like where we were before?

480
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,380
How did the ice become a perfect ledge like that?

481
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,180
Probably aliens?

482
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,350
Can I go inside here?

483
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,690
I didn't realize I'm a jorker.

484
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,010
You're a jorker.

485
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,450
Thank you.

486
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,760
Hot dog.

487
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,920
What's this?

488
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,200
Engar and Boo are ghosts and are cute, so let me know.

489
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,700
Whoa.

490
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,060
Hinged.

491
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,020
What about the unhinged?

492
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,000
What about an unhinged fish?

493
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,500
Would that not be more spooky than a hinged fish?

494
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,920
I'd say.

495
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,080
A pontoon lady.

496
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,500
I think maybe I should turn my light on just in case.

497
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,820
Oh, just kidding.

498
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,320
I don't want my sanity to go so down.

499
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,300
Or maybe I do.

500
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,960
A pontoon lady.

501
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,300
That's a really big one.

502
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,060
Wait, I haven't seen a pirate ship.

503
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,540
Lady?

504
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,000
Where is she?

505
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,100
Welcome back.

506
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,160
Thank you.

507
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,440
Hinged fish.

508
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,100
Maybe this one is friendly.

509
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,200
I probably don't think so.

510
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,790
Where is she?

511
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,070
Is the ice this big?

512
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,850
What's that sound?

513
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,230
I didn't like that.

514
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,880
What the heck are you?

515
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,080
Oh my god!

516
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,600
It's Gundam Man.

517
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,700
She's dredging on my side.

518
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,860
Dredge to meet ya.

519
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,980
I'm dredging any social interaction.

520
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:44,020
Oh, it's day.

521
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,800
Uh oh, I'm a little crazy.

522
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,480
Get fish.

523
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
Go to photographer inside island.

524
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,920
Narwhal breaks ice wall.

525
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,660
Thank you!

526
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,140
Ok, I'm getting fish.

527
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,500
Thank you, thank you.

528
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,460
So, I do remember where the photographer is.

529
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,160
Why is the music like this?

530
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,760
Let's get some more fish then.

531
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,520
I don't know what she wants so we'll just grab a couple.

532
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,400
Oh, this is abyssal.

533
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,740
I don't need you.

534
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,180
Aha!

535
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,120
I'm dredging to this game.

536
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,760
What does that mean?

537
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:37,040
You think anybody is watching me on the great open sea?

538
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,880
Any sea lovers?

539
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,220
What is that?

540
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:45,900
Sorry.

541
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,080
What was that?

542
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,880
I don't think that was a good thing.

543
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,040
What was that?

544
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,520
Did you see that thing underneath the water at me?

545
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,340
It's a shark.

546
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,220
Where did he come from?

547
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,900
H-O-H.

548
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,600
No, S-O-S.

549
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,300
Let's go see what she wants first.

550
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,320
That was sick.

551
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,360
Mother nature is so beautiful.

552
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,140
Okay, let's go in here.

553
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,900
We'll talk to the photographer lady.

554
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,400
She wanted some... Oh my god, leave me alone.

555
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
She wanted some fish?

556
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,400
I got your fish.

557
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,650
Hi lady.

558
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,250
Oh, and I guess I couldn't do it before because I...

559
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,250
I didn't have...

560
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,830
The ice rod.

561
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,230
And... So close to being perfect.

562
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,310
Hold on, let's go get another ice fish.

563
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,030
Ice minky.

564
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,850
Lady.

565
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,400
Perfect.

566
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,260
Hello.

567
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,160
That's perfect.

568
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,340
Now cut your engines.

569
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,300
We need to wait in complete silence.

570
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,910
I think I hear something under the ice.

571
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,470
It's really dark.

572
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,990
Was that thing going to be chasing me?

573
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,610
What on earth was that thing?

574
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,750
I'm not sticking around to find out.

575
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,370
Okay.

576
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,250
Me neither.

577
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:10,870
Bye.

578
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,560
Is that thing going to be chasing me?

579
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,260
I do want to sell my fish though.

580
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,560
Yeah, I don't know... That was a narwhal?

581
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,420
What are they feeding the narwhal in this place?

582
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,260
Give me the... Give me the aberrated one, please.

583
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,070
The next one is definitely a freak.

584
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,890
Ew, it's thawed.

585
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,070
It's so nasty.

586
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,870
I don't like the sound of the ice crackling.

587
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,570
It kind of makes me nervous.

588
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,350
Sorry.

589
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,990
I think we're okay, but let's just park our boat.

590
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,710
Park.

591
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,730
Freak recognizes freak.

592
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,410
It can't match my freak?

593
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,330
I don't know.

594
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,190
Do I look like that?

595
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,530
Do I look like that?

596
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,530
Alright, let's sell all of our fish.

597
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,870
Yeah, he's stale.

598
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,830
Oh, rotting!

599
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,150
Oh no!

600
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,250
Get rid of him.

601
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,750
Get rid of him.

602
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:45,930
And then...

603
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,510
We sleep.

604
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,190
Good night.

605
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,160
And we awake.

606
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,100
And we go out.

607
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,760
Let's see.

608
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,180
Let's put on our haste just in case we get chased by a narwhal.

609
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,180
I want the ice breaker real bad.

610
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,080
Because then we can plow through all of these, I imagine.

611
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,610
Okay, we're going in.

612
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,730
Oh, she really did leave.

613
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,150
Wait, what's that over there?

614
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,430
It's like a whole village.

615
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,210
And I'm guessing the yellow spots are where we get the pieces.

616
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,250
Yes.

617
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,950
What's that?

618
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,270
What was that?

619
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,730
Why did it make that sound?

620
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,250
What was the heartbeat sound for?

621
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm scared.

622
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Is

623
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,660
that the narwhal?

624
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,340
I

625
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,310
don't like this.

626
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,250
I don't like this area.

627
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,830
I can dock here.

628
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,450
Wait, there's a frozen man.

629
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,650
This is a frozen guy.

630
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,200
Is this John Carpenter's The Thing?

631
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,560
I'm scared.

632
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,720
Why is this like a horror game all of a sudden?

633
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,860
Which entry do you want to read?

634
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,760
I guess we'll go in order.

635
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,500
Okay.

636
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:45,460
So that was May 30th, 1847.

637
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,460
Okay, two days later, June 1st.

638
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,380
Okay.

639
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,340
Vivi-Gor, thank you so much for the gift.

640
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,680
You still haven't changed your profile, have you?

641
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,440
Is that a picture of it?

642
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,880
And then June 5th, 1847.

643
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,840
Did they only last less than a week?

644
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,300
There was no mistaking this as a trick of the wind, nor a jest by the crew.

645
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:57,160
It did not pause for response or acknowledgement, but whispered a cryptic prophecy.

646
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,020
At first, I could not make sense of it.

647
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,440
Three listeners shall hear the heart.

648
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,940
When?

649
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,180
And that I should indulge these listeners.

650
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,220
It spoke of boundless wealth from the stars, and of eye-opening unto the world.

651
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,220
The rest of my sleep was feverish, as my mind was plagued with the sound of the voice.

652
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,700
It spun in my head, echoing even louder.

653
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:37,480
In the morning, the boat swang, and the navigator came to me separately, claiming to have heard a sound like a heartbeat as the men were digging yesterday.

654
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:45,420
They indicated a desire to explore the eastern and western reaches of the ice field.

655
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,080
I shall indulge them.

656
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,180
Pronounced Bowson.

657
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,560
What's the ice shard?

658
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:09,940
Light pierces through the ice, intensifying and concentrating into a glow in the center.

659
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,560
A dark form takes shape against the light.

660
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,540
A place in here to the ice?

661
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,280
A distorted voice echoes from within.

662
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,640
Don't disturb the ice.

663
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,340
What happened here?

664
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,980
It whispered, promised, stones from the stars.

665
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,020
It knew three would hear the heart beneath the ice.

666
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,460
The voice grows louder.

667
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:49,560
It commanded three listeners, three sacrifices for three eyes.

668
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
Nerd.

669
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,440
Four eyes.

670
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,800
I obeyed, but a fourth now sees forever futile.

671
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,700
The shadow is silent for a time.

672
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,160
Slumbering, still, should leave.

673
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,940
It sees you before it whispers.

674
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,860
A pursuit added.

675
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,480
Wait, we can just break the ice?

676
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,520
Who are you?

677
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,480
Captain, the expedition.

678
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,000
Chart the ice field.

679
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,280
Appeared suddenly, through the ice.

680
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,360
Do I?

681
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,380
Wait, hold on.

682
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,420
What do you mean?

683
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,760
What do you mean a pursuit appeared?

684
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,220
Explore the area.

685
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,220
Find whatever the voice the ice was talking about.

686
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,740
A voice speaks from within the ice in the central camp.

687
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,500
A voice spoke from within.

688
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,640
It mentions listeners, eyes, and valuable stones.

689
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,360
It specifically mentioned three.

690
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,420
Or was it four?

691
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,820
I think our character is stupid.

692
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,140
Also, I noticed we have a message in a bottle.

693
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,020
Oh, these are the journals.

694
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,380
I was like, did I miss a message in a bottle?

695
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,000
We gotta go get these samples too.

696
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,060
Let's break the ice, for the bit.

697
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,900
Do not.

698
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,520
Oh, I need a thing.

699
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,220
Risk breaking his senses through the ice, through the shadows.

700
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,220
No hope.

701
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,280
Okay, well I can't help you anyway right now.

702
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,340
I'm scared of leaving here.

703
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,880
I'm scared of leaving here.

704
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,280
I don't have any fish to placate the narwhal.

705
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,260
Maybe I will.

706
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,480
Is he coming for me?

707
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,020
Okay, I think this is just atmosphere.

708
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,580
I think.

709
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,420
Is this just atmosphere?

710
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,560
I can't move, I'm too scared.

711
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,440
I don't want the narwhal to chase me.

712
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,360
It's so ominous.

713
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,640
It really is.

714
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,460
Okay.

715
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,200
Maybe we're fine.

716
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,700
Anyway, let's get some fishies for the narwhal.

717
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,380
Ooh, a prime.

718
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,080
Surely, it will love ice fish.

719
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,380
And we can get...

720
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,380
This species is in no...

721
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,260
No threat of being extinct.

722
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,020
Oh, just kidding.

723
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,900
I depleted the spot.

724
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,020
Oh, okay.

725
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,020
This is fine.

726
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,860
I don't like it.

727
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,480
I don't like it.

728
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,760
I don't...

729
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,540
Is that what you humans hear all the time?

730
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,940
Your own heartbeat like that?

731
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,280
Creepy.

732
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,420
I don't like it.

733
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,480
I'm trying to find a place to put the food at.

734
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,960
Kind of what we had it on before.

735
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,130
I don't see any places though.

736
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,930
Just in case this guy comes after me.

737
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,550
It's usually my stomach.

738
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,350
I don't like this at all.

739
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,410
It's so creepy.

740
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,770
Oh, I see one.

741
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,320
Looks like someone built a feeding station.

742
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,400
He will be satiated by offering a fish.

743
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,320
I have many ice fish.

744
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,160
I hope you like.

745
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,240
It doesn't feel, but hopefully it's okay.

746
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,160
What's happening?

747
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,640
Oh my god!

748
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,480
Wait, is he going to go eat it?

749
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,980
We are placating the narwhal.

750
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,020
Oh my god!

751
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,000
Wait, he's kind of cute.

752
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,880
Wow, that was fast.

753
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,440
Okay, cool.

754
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,380
Let's go look around for some other things without worry now.

755
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,410
Can we keep them?

756
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,610
Oh, there was one literally right there.

757
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:49,970
Okay.

758
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,790
We are looking for other pieces...

759
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,690
to build.

760
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,010
Can I break that down?

761
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,610
We are looking for other pieces to build the ice breaker.

762
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,570
Maybe he will just have one fish on hand at all times.

763
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,620
Oh, didn't you get a map?

764
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,360
You are so right!

765
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,430
What are these sounds?

766
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,700
I do like to throw a few crab pots in this zone for a steady supply of narwhal placation.

767
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,040
Oh my gosh!

768
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,820
Starman, you are so smart!

769
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,760
That's really smart.

770
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,800
I don't have any on me though.

771
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,100
Okay, we can buy some though.

772
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,600
Brian!

773
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,880
Thank you so much for the five gift.

774
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,540
Thank you!

775
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,800
Okay, we got...

776
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,800
We gotta go...

777
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,940
Can I even get to these areas?

778
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,180
Okay, let's go to sleep.

779
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,020
I don't wanna travel through the ice in the dark.

780
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,140
Let's throw some stuff around.

781
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,380
Maybe I...

782
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,420
Actually, I'm gonna use some of these mixed baits as well so that I can just...

783
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,860
My stuff is all over the place.

784
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,660
This is bad.

785
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,760
This is not great.

786
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,440
Throw you in there for now.

787
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,400
I wanna get some extra fish though with the bait.

788
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,220
We sleep!

789
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,640
Undock?

790
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,220
Go here?

791
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,040
How do I use this actually?

792
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,540
I don't remember.

793
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,240
I don't remember how to use the mixed bait.

794
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,280
Oh!

795
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,710
No, it's through here.

796
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,250
I remember.

797
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,720
No.

798
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,860
Oh bait!

799
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,320
There we go.

800
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
Big boy.

801
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,200
Okay, surely he'll like that.

802
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,280
World is disappointing right now.

803
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,100
Brian, are you okay?

804
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,860
Are you going through it, man?

805
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,420
Going through it?

806
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,640
What the heck is this?

807
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,940
Lizard!

808
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,300
How

809
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,830
does she smell?

810
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,290
I have a keen sense.

811
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,870
Don't you worry.

812
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,450
Okay.

813
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:19,810
Map.

814
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,350
We need to go this way.

815
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:25,370
So let's...is it this way?

816
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:26,150
I believe.

817
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,200
No, that's the pontoon.

818
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:33,820
I'm silly.

819
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,020
We need to go this way.

820
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,460
Phil, thank you so much for the five gifted teku.

821
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,660
East and west.

822
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,020
Okay, so in like...

823
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,020
I see!

824
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,040
I see it.

825
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,580
Let's placate.

826
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,280
Wait, but how am I supposed to get in there?

827
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,840
See, this is the issue that I have.

828
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,580
I can't.

829
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Unless I don't need to go there yet.

830
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:06,800
Maybe...

831
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,600
Let's fish a little.

832
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,100
Gonna grab some more stuff to placate the narwhal god.

833
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,300
Did you wish my friend Mike a happy birthday?

834
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,380
Us British wisps love to tune into your streams before bed with our tea and biscuits at the ready.

835
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:27,940
Cheerios!

836
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,960
Yeah, I'm not like a...I think, you know...

837
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,860
Saying their first and last name just sounds so formal, no?

838
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,260
I think just a simple...Mike.

839
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,180
Mikey.

840
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,000
Mikey my man.

841
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,580
You know!

842
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,040
Gene, welcome to my friendship.

843
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:51,660
Thank you.

844
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,780
Happy birthday to you.

845
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,800
Happy birthday to you.

846
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,740
Happy birthday dear Mike.

847
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,640
Happy birthday to you.

848
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,600
Happy birthday.

849
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,280
Mikey.

850
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,380
Okay, hold on.

851
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,080
Now let's see.

852
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,080
How do we get around?

853
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,300
I guess we could go this way instead.

854
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:30,900
Avoid you.

855
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,280
Avoid that thing.

856
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,180
There we go.

857
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,570
Wait, how do I...

858
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,150
How am I supposed to do anything?

859
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:45,530
I'm so confused.

860
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:46,210
I can't...

861
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,250
I can't break the ice yet.

862
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:48,850
Eh?

863
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:57,490
Run!

864
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,610
Thank you so much for the 10 yen.

865
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,980
Fill it with fish.

866
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,460
But I don't have one that's just a singular fish.

867
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,250
I see.

868
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,610
He's gotta break it.

869
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,330
No more fish will fit on the...

870
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,250
I see.

871
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,150
Wow, I think we should have backed up a little bit.

872
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,890
I should keep it satisfied at least for a little while.

873
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,360
How is he supposed to eat it if he just breaks it like that?

874
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,240
Second piece acquired.

875
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,520
And I know where the other one was.

876
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,740
I think that he needs to break.

877
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,460
Wait, there's another guy in here.

878
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,000
Why is he so skinny legend?

879
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,220
Also, does this look like a claw?

880
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,440
Or...

881
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,800
I think this doesn't look very good.

882
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,660
Hello funny ghost maid with a comically tall fishing hat.

883
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,840
I'm at work, but I found out today that my cat doesn't need to have her tail amputated.

884
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,660
That's good news.

885
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,920
No, it's fine.

886
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,340
Gosh.

887
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,780
Born too late to explore the world.

888
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,340
Born too early to explore space.

889
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,120
Katy Perry.

890
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,040
Ice shard.

891
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,220
Oh, it's a guy again.

892
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,240
An unnatural spire of ice stands above scraps of snowed over equipment.

893
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,320
A dark shape twists within.

894
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm listening to the ice.

895
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,680
An anguished voice cries from deep within the ice.

896
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,180
Hey, the other guy seemed less sussy.

897
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,460
Please break the ice.

898
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,820
The other guy told us not to break the ice.

899
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,820
What's your dealio?

900
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,740
Who are you?

901
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,600
I was... I am the...

902
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,980
How do you say it's pronounced?

903
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,040
It's the Avatar.

904
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,740
Aang, I'll get you out of there.

905
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,500
Bolson.

906
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,420
The expedition.

907
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,820
The terror.

908
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,240
Please, break the ice.

909
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,300
What happened?

910
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,480
The figure contorts through painful shapes.

911
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,020
How's he moving in there?

912
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,680
We saw lights dancing in ice.

913
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,660
Dug deep.

914
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,600
Didn't know.

915
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,700
I heard it.

916
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,440
The heart beating under ice.

917
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,260
The cracking.

918
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:22,940
Waking.

919
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,980
The noises in the east.

920
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:26,820
I went.

921
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,340
The captain brought him here to find it.

922
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,140
The hand in the night.

923
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,800
Shadow of claws.

924
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,920
Big icy claws.

925
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,080
The darkness shrinks.

926
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,620
I turned away.

927
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,520
Just a moment.

928
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,520
The pain.

929
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,380
The claws.

930
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,580
My back.

931
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,540
So cold.

932
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,360
So dark.

933
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,320
Under ice.

934
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,600
Please, break the ice.

935
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,300
Bye.

936
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,040
Frozen equipment.

937
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,780
What you got here?

938
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,060
You rummage through the small pile of equipment.

939
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,400
In the snow.

940
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,460
Most items are stuck fast in the ice, but inside a small backpack you find an old journal.

941
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,360
More?

942
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,160
Oh, okay.

943
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:07,920
June 2nd.

944
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,300
Captain ordered us to make camp on the ice in the center of the lagoon.

945
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,260
After we saw those lights in the ice, everyone got treasure on their minds.

946
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,560
I've seen the light.

947
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,940
There's like a big golden light in the sky.

948
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,560
The claw.

949
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:33,940
Treasure hunting isn't exactly what the expedition was commissioned for, but given the captain gets the lion's share of whatever we find...

950
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,920
It doesn't surprise me that he is willing to bend the rules a bit.

951
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,900
We start digging after the camp's done.

952
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,280
The sun?

953
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:41,680
No!

954
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,140
It wasn't the sun!

955
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,580
June 4th.

956
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,660
Spent the day digging down in the ice.

957
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,260
Shovels and ice picks.

958
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,160
Can't remember the last time I was this tired.

959
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,420
We were only allowed two short breaks all day.

960
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,160
Down in the pit, as I rested with my back against the ice, I started hearing something.

961
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,220
It was different to the sounds of the picks.

962
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,840
They were short and sharp.

963
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,180
This was a lull.

964
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,420
This was lull.

965
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,320
A rumble from deeper down.

966
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,620
What's my favorite fish?

967
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,280
My favorite sea creature might be a horseshoe crab.

968
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,900
But that's not a fish.

969
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,640
It's fish adjacent.

970
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,440
Does it count?

971
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,300
I love horseshoe crabs.

972
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,100
They're so cute.

973
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:09,320
I like... honorary fish?

974
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,480
I don't know about that.

975
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,540
They're not even crabs.

976
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,380
What's my favorite sushi?

977
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:18,860
Egg.

978
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:24,840
Eggy.

979
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,100
Manta rays.

980
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,260
I do like manta rays.

981
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,600
Yeah.

982
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,000
Maybe that's my favorite.

983
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,740
Coelacanth?

984
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,380
Oh yeah, those guys are cool.

985
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,640
Let's get back to the journal.

986
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,180
On my first break it was occasional.

987
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,780
Only a few each minute.

988
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,140
But on my second break it had quickened like a heartbeat.

989
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,320
Next day, June 5th.

990
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,160
I can't keep yawning.

991
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,060
Oh gosh, I have late stuff to do tonight.

992
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,500
The captain overheard me telling some others about the sound I heard in the pit.

993
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,920
Before I knew it, I was in front of his desk.

994
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,180
Sure, I was about to have my pay docked.

995
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:16,920
Hagfish?

996
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,760
What is that?

997
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,440
To my great surprise, he seemed to know something of it already.

998
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,420
He was keen on hearing it described over and over.

999
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,120
He wants me to help locate the source of it.

1000
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,340
When he pressed me on it further, I said that it did seem to be coming from the east.

1001
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,540
Tomorrow we are setting off to see if we can find it.

1002
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,120
Perhaps I shall get a bonus after this is done.

1003
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,300
All they think about is money, money, money.

1004
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,760
Where does that head to?

1005
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,000
It heads out?

1006
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,100
Push a mark?

1007
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,980
Let's go back where we came.

1008
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,440
I can't wait to get the ice breaker.

1009
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:16,460
I don't like staying in this area at night, so...

1010
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,880
What we are going to do is...

1011
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,480
I like this lizard fish, but we don't need to sell him, I suppose.

1012
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,720
We are going to catch some more fish...

1013
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,080
before placating our friend.

1014
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,740
Some more ice fish.

1015
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,540
All this ice breaking reminds me of the kids' board game, Don't Break the Ice with the Plastic Hammers.

1016
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,200
I don't think I played that one.

1017
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,700
Blob fish!

1018
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,280
Did you guys see that angler fish?

1019
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,660
I think it was an angler that swam to the top of the water...

1020
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,100
and people were like, why are you here?

1021
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,380
That's a little concerning.

1022
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,880
You shouldn't be up this far.

1023
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,240
Yeah, he was a teeny tiny little guy.

1024
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,990
He wasn't dead, he was...

1025
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,030
But he was dying.

1026
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,210
Yeah, he was nearly dead.

1027
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,870
He was nearly dead.

1028
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,190
Oh, no, that's not what I meant to do.

1029
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:19,750
There we go.

1030
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:20,270
Rest.

1031
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:25,890
Yeah, but people were just like, oh my gosh, it's so beautiful.

1032
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:28,830
He's seeing the sun for the first time.

1033
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,630
And I'm like, I think...

1034
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,290
I think that will make him even more blind.

1035
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,670
Do you like Depth Charge and Rampage from Beasties?

1036
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,670
Or Manta Ray and some kind of crab?

1037
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,630
I don't remember them, I'll be honest.

1038
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,330
Okay, let's go placate our guy.

1039
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,260
Thread the needle, thread the needle.

1040
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,600
Why is the music so like this?

1041
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,540
Uh-oh, I rotted something.

1042
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,380
We'll just get rid of it.

1043
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,150
I don't know if the amount makes him stay placated for longer or not.

1044
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,530
Wait, I kind of want a picture of him.

1045
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,130
Look at him chomp.

1046
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,910
Nice.

1047
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,150
See ya, see ya, see ya.

1048
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,330
Okay, go back to haste.

1049
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,090
Actually, what if I do this?

1050
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,450
No victims!

1051
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,870
Reap the corpse of any fish in your sights.

1052
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:06,910
Oh, I don't have any.

1053
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,770
Just kidding.

1054
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,230
So there was...

1055
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,920
One overheat... There, right there.

1056
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,420
That we need to get to.

1057
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,180
Let's get some more fish.

1058
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:31,280
That's not fish.

1059
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,680
Oh, this looks like a big guy.

1060
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,140
A goblin shark!

1061
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,040
That's so ugly.

1062
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,180
Nasty creature.

1063
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,520
I see something over here too.

1064
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,690
Please don't bully.

1065
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:04,350
Sorry.

1066
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:06,170
Sorry.

1067
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,510
I'm not trying to.

1068
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:13,070
He's just got a bit of an overbite.

1069
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:16,330
Let's see.

1070
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:21,530
I don't think this is enough, but we can see all the more we need.

1071
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,760
Like how could I... Oh, maybe...

1072
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,840
No, see, I don't think that'll work.

1073
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,820
Because I don't have any.

1074
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,760
If I put down...

1075
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:43,640
Wait.

1076
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,900
Ah, okay.

1077
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,520
Wait.

1078
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,640
Oh, if only... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1079
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1080
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,760
Oh, no.

1081
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,330
So close.

1082
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:12,150
If I could get a char and then another ice fish would be good.

1083
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,510
Let's try that.

1084
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,170
You know where the ice fish are?

1085
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:17,910
Right here?

1086
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,280
Okay.

1087
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,920
And let's get out our trusty handy dandy.

1088
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,580
Easy.

1089
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,840
As a young wisp, I yearned for the sea.

1090
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,820
But something always got in the way.

1091
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,840
But the call of the sea was too strong.

1092
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,680
So one day I started dredging.

1093
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,460
Is this what he says in the Minecraft movie?

1094
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:59,780
Is this the start of the Minecraft movie or whatever?

1095
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:10,900
Alright.

1096
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:11,640
Oopsie.

1097
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,760
Oh gosh, it's gonna be kind of dark by the time he does this.

1098
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,520
We might be okay.

1099
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,900
I should keep it satisfied at least for a little while.

1100
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,340
Dredge goes binten.

1101
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,620
I don't think that works.

1102
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,940
I don't think that works as well as you think it does.

1103
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,280
Let's grab this first.

1104
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,100
How many more do I need?

1105
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,900
Oh wait, that should be it.

1106
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,060
That should be it baby.

1107
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:24,840
Nice.

1108
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm scared of what's gonna be here at night.

1109
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,600
I'm freaked out by this area.

1110
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,740
Another makeshift camp constructed in the shadows of a frozen clawed hand.

1111
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,880
Someone was seeking these out.

1112
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,700
There are very few pieces that still remain.

1113
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,320
The lover maid camp here was poorly prepared.

1114
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,700
Inside a small bag you find a leather bound journal.

1115
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,080
Okay, we're from June 4th where we left off.

1116
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,340
Chintzeler, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

1117
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:00,900
Thank you.

1118
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,900
The men spent the whole day digging.

1119
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,760
They passed up chunks of ice, some as brilliant as crystal.

1120
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,480
Others of a deepest bloom were beautiful than sapphires.

1121
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,600
But none held the glow we had seen in the night.

1122
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,180
However, I did note a disturbance in the ice to the west.

1123
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:29,100
It began as a periodic distant rumble.

1124
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:35,900
As the men dug deeper, the pulsing quickened, strengthening until I could see the ice shifting on the surface.

1125
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,220
I was leaving all these giant claws around.

1126
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,400
I shall have to inform the captain.

1127
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,640
It may as well be that narwhal creature we saw earlier.

1128
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,300
Though this did seem much larger.

1129
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,520
As I write this, I can already feel my eyes closing.

1130
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,400
We will have to wait until the morning.

1131
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,640
Okay, June 7th.

1132
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,440
This morning the captain appeared out of the fog, rowing alone.

1133
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,740
Apparently the boat...

1134
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:08,960
Boatson...

1135
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:10,600
Boatson...

1136
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,460
Boatson...

1137
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:18,620
Boatson...

1138
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:19,720
Yes.

1139
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,620
Remains at a camp in the east, waiting for nightfall.

1140
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,640
That was an excerpt...

1141
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,280
The opening of a movie the hag made in the depths.

1142
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,220
Shut up!

1143
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,440
They were unsuccessful in their search.

1144
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,880
But it does make sense that the lights would be more visible at night.

1145
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:43,820
Tomorrow we're to journey together to the west, towards the shifting ice that I reported.

1146
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,060
Okay, tomorrow, June 8th.

1147
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,460
We are alone on a small island of ice.

1148
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:55,380
After hours of rowing through narrow channels, it rose through the fog.

1149
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,580
Our gargantuan, monstrous claw, reaching from the deep.

1150
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:07,280
Whatever creature it once belonged to must be long dead, as the claw is frozen solid.

1151
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:11,720
I wanted to turn back immediately, but the captain insisted we investigate.

1152
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,720
He is on edge, his head turning this way and that, listening for the slightest sound.

1153
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,140
He is convinced something will happen after dark.

1154
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,320
Wait, it's dark for me.

1155
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,000
I'm scared!

1156
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:31,660
As the last light from the cold sun fades, I have the sense that it will be a long night.

1157
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,960
Can I sleep here?

1158
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,360
Oh, I can.

1159
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,270
Nice.

1160
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:46,710
Nice.

1161
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,290
Let's undock.

1162
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,970
Oh wait, sorry, I forgot to talk to this guy.

1163
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:51,210
Hello!

1164
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,530
The voice calls out.

1165
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,330
Trapped forever, this prison.

1166
01:11:59,010 --> 01:11:59,750
Get me out!

1167
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:01,890
Onix, thank you so much for your bond.

1168
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,650
Break it, somehow, free me.

1169
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:06,810
Who are you?

1170
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:08,810
The navigator.

1171
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,530
Find safe passage.

1172
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,910
Chart the ice it came from.

1173
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:14,850
Beyond.

1174
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:18,910
Break it, somehow, free me.

1175
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,050
What happened?

1176
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:25,230
The digging, the cracked ice, like a web, awoke the ice heart.

1177
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:33,330
I told him, whispers in the west, took the bosun, east, returned alone.

1178
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:37,310
The dark figure shudders, sending vibrations through the ice.

1179
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:41,850
The next day, rode here, the captain saw the claws.

1180
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:46,570
Grip my soul, he insisted, made camp, shadow of the beast.

1181
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:52,670
Waiting for the stars, in the night, I saw his shape.

1182
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:57,810
Suddenly, swallowed by the cold, in the dark, he left me.

1183
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,470
Why does this sound like...

1184
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,910
Why does this sound like a one night stand?

1185
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,960
I'm sorry.

1186
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,600
Our poor little navigator caught feelings and he left him.

1187
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,880
Break it, somehow, free me.

1188
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:18,840
Ok, later.

1189
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,140
Bye bye.

1190
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,900
We can go back and we can now equip this.

1191
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,220
My fish are stale.

1192
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:42,270
It sucks that you can't really make money here, because I feel like I'm giving it all to the damn narwhal.

1193
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:47,650
Okie dokie.

1194
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,050
Which I will do right now.

1195
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,120
I will give him my fish.

1196
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,980
I don't know how often he appears and I don't really want to find out.

1197
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,520
Let's take that.

1198
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,700
Bye bye.

1199
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,760
Alright, let's go attach this.

1200
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,040
And then we can break some of these things.

1201
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,700
I'm overfeeding him.

1202
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:20,860
I'm gonna make him fat so he can't move.

1203
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm gonna make him fat so he can't chase after me.

1204
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,760
Keep eating, narwhal.

1205
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,500
Keep eating.

1206
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,700
Chunky boy.

1207
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,380
I mean, he might be delicious.

1208
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,200
Who knows?

1209
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,460
Has anyone thought to eat the narwhal?

1210
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,970
Ok, Icy worksite.

1211
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:01,480
That's everything.

1212
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,100
Let me just warm my hands up a little then I'll get started.

1213
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,380
Installing icebreaker.

1214
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,540
It took the whole day.

1215
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,100
Alright, I think that should do it.

1216
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,140
The front of your ship can now break through chunks of ice.

1217
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,800
Go ahead and test it out.

1218
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,020
I'll be watching from here.

1219
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,120
Does it take up anything in our...

1220
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,380
Oh, it doesn't.

1221
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,620
That's so nice.

1222
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,820
I forgot to mention.

1223
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,360
Just let me know if you want to temporarily remove the icebreaker.

1224
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,860
And swap it out.

1225
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,840
I've been looking through the schematics we found before and there are plans for another device.

1226
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:39,840
For an ice shaper.

1227
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,020
That's different to your icebreaker.

1228
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,960
It's for cutting chunks of ice.

1229
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,740
If you find the missing device, you'll be able to harvest ice blocks for refrigeration.

1230
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,080
The blocks of ice can be packed into your cargo to slow fish spoilage.

1231
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,960
Ok, that's what it looks like.

1232
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,160
Interesting.

1233
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:00,420
Interesting.

1234
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,400
Oh wait, I have no fish.

1235
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:06,960
Cool, let's sleep.

1236
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:13,100
And then we shall go and break some ice.

1237
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,480
Let's go break the ice, everybody.

1238
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,720
Like this?

1239
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,760
Do I just ram into it?

1240
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,450
Why did that happen?

1241
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,630
Am I taking damage?

1242
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:36,570
No.

1243
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:38,630
Neat.

1244
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,340
This is awesome.

1245
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,350
He's probably hungry after a long night.

1246
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:54,110
And even if he's not, I'm gonna force him to eat?

1247
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,990
I'm gonna poison him.

1248
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,090
What the hell?

1249
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:17,660
Oh my god.

1250
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,620
That's horrible.

1251
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,140
Vessels feed on distended fluid-filled body.

1252
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,240
A shadow stirs inside.

1253
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,680
Do you think there's a man in there too?

1254
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:33,600
Wait.

1255
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:35,660
Yay!

1256
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,100
Another one?

1257
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,720
Wow!

1258
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,860
Wait, I kinda wanna go sell these.

1259
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,080
Dang, this bait works too well.

1260
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,020
For Gante, actually.

1261
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:56,900
Let's go sell these.

1262
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,460
He doesn't deserve my good fish.

1263
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,670
I'm just plowing through.

1264
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:17,330
Who needs an icebreaker when you can just ram into it?

1265
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:21,690
539!

1266
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,290
Let's go.

1267
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,290
And you know what?

1268
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,970
I will grab some more bait from the storage though.

1269
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,410
I don't see why not.

1270
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:33,050
Look,

1271
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,680
even this...

1272
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,500
No ice is too large!

1273
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,270
I'm gonna... See?

1274
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:06,750
See?

1275
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,590
That's not the sun right there.

1276
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,530
That's what I was talking about before.

1277
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,690
That's what I was talking about before.

1278
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:15,110
And...

1279
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,010
Toothfish.

1280
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,250
We'll grab it.

1281
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:26,410
Oh my gosh.

1282
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:27,590
I'm back.

1283
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:31,010
It's night.

1284
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,530
Almost.

1285
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,090
Maybe we'll sleep.

1286
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,950
And then satiate it.

1287
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,770
It's not the sun.

1288
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,270
Did I ever see the Titanic?

1289
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:43,210
Yeah, what about it?

1290
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:46,070
What about the Titanic?

1291
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:50,930
Lizard.

1292
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,520
Lizard.

1293
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,290
The movie Titanic?

1294
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:03,450
Yeah.

1295
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:12,980
Oh it's just the ice fish.

1296
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,120
Astral ice fish!

1297
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:17,980
Wait, it's so cool!

1298
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,820
Constellations of light dances through its body, stitching fin to flesh and spine to bone.

1299
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,280
I like it.

1300
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:34,640
How do I know when the narwhal is coming after me?

1301
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,220
Oh my gosh.

1302
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:37,760
You know what?

1303
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,060
Let's just feed him.

1304
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,040
Let's just feed him.

1305
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,620
I don't want him on my tail at all.

1306
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,260
Oh, I'm stupid.

1307
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:01,300
These are very... These are top delicious fish that any... that money could buy.

1308
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,520
I don't think I can... I don't think I can... Yeah.

1309
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,040
It's one or the other.

1310
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:12,020
This guy, he looks a little bit... He's got a little bit more bone on him.

1311
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:13,500
Or meat on him maybe.

1312
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:14,840
Maybe not actually.

1313
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,440
OK.

1314
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,820
So while he's eating that...

1315
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,800
Oh my gosh!

1316
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:25,080
Wait!

1317
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,020
We're gonna go break the ice!

1318
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,280
Again!

1319
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,600
Ice axe!

1320
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,320
We got it!

1321
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,820
Wait, do I need one each time?

1322
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,320
You think?

1323
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,900
Let's go break the ice.

1324
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,490
Ask them about their day.

1325
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:51,870
Ask them if they've seen any good fish lately.

1326
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:01,650
OK, captain.

1327
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:08,550
Anyway...

1328
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,350
Cleaving away fragments that fall and shatter.

1329
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:42,070
A frozen heart?

1330
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,630
You take the stone and leave.

1331
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:47,390
I mean the...

1332
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:49,990
Thank you.

1333
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,330
I don't leave, instead I sleep.

1334
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,130
That's not what I expected.

1335
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,410
Me neither, actually.

1336
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:01,130
I don't know what I expected, but...

1337
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:03,250
That was...

1338
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:04,310
Interesting.

1339
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:10,410
Hold on, let me actually put this in the storage.

1340
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:11,970
I've been to do that before.

1341
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:17,330
I don't...

1342
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,010
Put you in there.

1343
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:20,550
How are my fish doing?

1344
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:21,650
Oh, he's a little stale.

1345
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:25,960
Wait.

1346
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,140
Do you hear it?

1347
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:36,950
Creepy.

1348
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,110
OK, undock.

1349
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:41,750
Let's go find some more.

1350
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:46,290
In fact, we should know where the second one is.

1351
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,890
Over this way.

1352
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:51,190
And I'm gonna feed our guy again.

1353
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:52,430
Get fat!

1354
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:53,190
Get fat!

1355
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,030
Eat up!

1356
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:57,730
Yummy, yummy.

1357
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:05,420
You'll never catch me.

1358
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,250
Wait, there was this one, right?

1359
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,770
Yeah, pretty sure.

1360
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:19,250
And then to the left.

1361
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,350
That was kind of fun.

1362
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,160
Oops.

1363
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,740
Alright, let's go get our next guy.

1364
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:43,190
Hello you, Mr. Navigator.

1365
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,330
Our heartbroken little fella.

1366
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:49,330
Break the ice.

1367
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,390
You strike hard against the center of the shard where the shadowy shape appears darkest.

1368
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:59,790
A deep crack chases upwards, cleaving away fragments that fall and shatter.

1369
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,400
That's a narwhal.

1370
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,060
That's a giant narwhal.

1371
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,000
I see its horn.

1372
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,020
Wait a second.

1373
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,800
Take the stone and leave.

1374
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,060
Wait, there is no storage here.

1375
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,840
What is over here anyway?

1376
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:38,500
I guess we can now like kind of form paths and stuff outside.

1377
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1378
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,960
Are you a crab or a boat?

1379
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,840
Oh, I just, I just, I just...

1380
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,820
It looks like I just like pooped on top of it.

1381
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,320
No, my face!

1382
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,300
You guys didn't see that, okay?

1383
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,750
Didn't see a thing.

1384
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:25,210
Yeah, of course you didn't.

1385
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,190
Of course you didn't.

1386
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,330
I was so scared, I just...

1387
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:37,990
I threw my bait.

1388
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:39,950
Hey, stop!

1389
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:49,390
Don't send that, ducky.

1390
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,170
That's gross.

1391
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:59,940
Maybe you can reap your... I don't think I can get it though, because it's right next to the crab.

1392
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,200
Alright, my storage.

1393
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,340
Throw you in there as well.

1394
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,520
Okay, I don't think I want to sleep.

1395
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,900
I think I want to go get the next one.

1396
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,660
I don't know where exactly it is.

1397
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:14,540
Is it down this way?

1398
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,520
I feel like...

1399
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,640
Let's go see.

1400
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,520
Because the other one was close to the guy.

1401
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,360
This one, maybe not so much.

1402
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:41,040
Maybe it's behind him.

1403
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,540
Over here?

1404
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,900
Where does this lead out to?

1405
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,880
Oh no, this just leads outside.

1406
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,840
That big chunk of ice that I couldn't go before.

1407
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,520
That was a lot of places.

1408
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,080
That looks like a giant claw.

1409
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:07,440
It actually is.

1410
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,280
You would be correct, my friend.

1411
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,680
I'm going to sleep only so that we can... Actually, maybe it would have been...

1412
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:18,920
I'm committed.

1413
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,960
I was going to say it would have been easier to see it in the dark maybe.

1414
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,720
Oh, wake up, wake up.

1415
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,120
Maybe through here?

1416
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,020
Ah, I see it, I see it.

1417
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,700
Now what are you?

1418
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,980
Is this an ice fish?

1419
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,160
Oh, it's a tooth fish.

1420
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:06,260
Now there was one area that we haven't been to yet.

1421
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,500
So I guess once we get all these guys out, we'll head to that area.

1422
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,300
What is this?

1423
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,020
Not a crab.

1424
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,200
It is a translucent spire of ice.

1425
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,300
Stretches down into the darkness.

1426
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,200
A pulsing glow rises from the deep, illuminating four round sockets.

1427
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:25,820
What?

1428
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,680
So we do need four.

1429
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,280
But they said there was only three, but we need a fourth.

1430
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,300
Interesting.

1431
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:42,220
The last one must be in that area that we have not been to yet.

1432
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1433
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:51,920
Let's get our friend here.

1434
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,880
How's the ice fishing going, man?

1435
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,260
Pretty good, I'd say.

1436
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,860
We're just freeing some little zombies from their icy prisons.

1437
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,740
You strike hard and it shatters.

1438
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,780
And then he closes his eyes.

1439
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:14,600
Good night.

1440
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,700
Good night, Mr. Narwhal.

1441
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:22,380
Take the stone and leave.

1442
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,400
Yes, we do.

1443
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,920
Actually, let's go get the others, maybe.

1444
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,380
Maybe we should have them all set up in there.

1445
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,560
The ice area is very strange.

1446
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,560
So far I'm not sure how to...

1447
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,200
Oh, oh, wait a second.

1448
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,400
Is that who I think that was?

1449
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:47,240
Was that sound?

1450
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:48,080
The narwhal?

1451
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,200
He won't get me if I'm docked, right?

1452
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,320
Sorry!

1453
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,160
Oh no!

1454
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,520
I didn't make him fat enough.

1455
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,200
Do I have any food?

1456
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,080
I have a tooth fish!

1457
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,340
Shoot, what do I do?

1458
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,120
Can I evade him?

1459
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,060
The music doesn't help here at all.

1460
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,300
The music actually does not help here at all.

1461
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,880
Hold on, there has to be another one.

1462
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,340
Another place to placate him.

1463
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:34,760
No?

1464
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,680
Here, let's get another fish.

1465
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,630
Perfect.

1466
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,010
Big boy.

1467
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:48,350
Big boy for our big appetite narwhal.

1468
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,060
My friend can't fish for himself.

1469
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,800
Oh, I think that's him.

1470
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,780
Oh, I think that's him.

1471
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,950
Awesome and heartwarming music.

1472
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:22,870
If I sleep...

1473
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:23,750
Maybe he'll leave me alone.

1474
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,910
Go eat, go get your own food!

1475
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,350
You lazy bones!

1476
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:33,850
OK, I don't see him.

1477
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,030
Let's go give him his fish.

1478
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:39,070
Before he comes back.

1479
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:40,530
Come here!

1480
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,070
Take this.

1481
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,890
And this.

1482
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:47,950
And that's all you get.

1483
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:49,090
The other is stale.

1484
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,700
We are going to deliver these real quick.

1485
01:32:58,260 --> 01:32:59,000
Before I forget.

1486
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:08,890
And here.

1487
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,150
I like breaking the ice.

1488
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,290
It's kind of...

1489
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:16,510
It kind of feels good.

1490
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:20,970
I like the crack sound that it makes.

1491
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:29,660
OK.

1492
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,880
I feel like we might not be doing a good thing, but...

1493
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,700
Oh well.

1494
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:46,020
But he's actually closing his eyes, so maybe it actually is for...

1495
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:46,940
The better.

1496
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:48,700
Oh wait, where am I?

1497
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:50,580
This?

1498
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:51,380
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1499
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:52,080
OK,

1500
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:56,580
we're heading this way.

1501
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,920
We're not going this way yet.

1502
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:07,690
No!

1503
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:09,490
It pushed me!

1504
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:10,270
No!

1505
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:11,170
Oh whoops, wrong button.

1506
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:32,590
There's our fourth guy!

1507
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,770
This must be...

1508
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:43,410
Nevermind, I thought this was going to be the other ice thing the lady talked about.

1509
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:49,800
Hello!

1510
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,840
He's not even looking at us.

1511
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,360
He doesn't care.

1512
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,300
Nevermind, he is looking at us.

1513
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,440
He's definitely looking at us.

1514
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,460
Hello Mr. Ice Shard.

1515
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,260
He's staring me down.

1516
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:27,220
Oh yeah, he's definitely alive.

1517
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,900
The voice abates.

1518
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,880
He wants us so bad.

1519
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:44,820
Oh yeah, he does.

1520
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:58,560
What is that thing in the ice?

1521
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:02,540
The shape in the ice shrinks into itself.

1522
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,080
What will Mitt do after dredge?

1523
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,240
I don't know.

1524
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:10,580
I feel like we maybe still have one more dredge stream.

1525
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,200
One or two.

1526
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,380
I think maybe one after this.

1527
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:18,200
Because I probably finished the ice today.

1528
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:20,980
I know not.

1529
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,480
The eyes open, watching.

1530
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:26,940
Shadow of shadow through the ice, yet more closed still.

1531
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,480
It cannot arise.

1532
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,380
Break the ice.

1533
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,320
Call the heart.

1534
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:34,880
Find the axe.

1535
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,600
Undo this.

1536
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,760
The betrayer.

1537
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,080
So who are you?

1538
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:39,320
First officer.

1539
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:40,700
Safety of the crew.

1540
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:41,580
Failed them.

1541
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:42,420
Should have.

1542
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:43,800
Cursed place.

1543
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:44,740
What do you mean you should have?

1544
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:46,600
Find the axe.

1545
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,280
Undo this.

1546
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,280
The betrayer.

1547
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,020
What happened?

1548
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,340
The men saw the lights.

1549
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,100
Southern cliffs at night.

1550
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,140
Captain and I were looking too.

1551
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,380
We rode alone.

1552
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,620
He was restless.

1553
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:00,600
Sleepless.

1554
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,380
We passed walls of ice.

1555
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:03,700
Finally arrived.

1556
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,200
The great horn into view.

1557
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:09,480
That's what I... The big yellow I've been seeing is the horn.

1558
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,340
Still need to finish the main story too.

1559
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1560
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:18,900
I think maybe...

1561
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,320
We have, yeah.

1562
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:20,880
We still have.

1563
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:21,900
So maybe...

1564
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:27,900
I have the iron rig and then I have the main story, so...

1565
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,920
Start a new save and replay it.

1566
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:34,500
Twitch forever.

1567
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,580
The words drifted.

1568
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,100
Some carried away in the wind.

1569
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:41,560
Pulled ashore.

1570
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,080
Quickly.

1571
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,180
The size of it.

1572
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:43,980
The light.

1573
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:44,780
Somehow.

1574
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:45,680
He knew.

1575
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:46,820
Eyes were wild.

1576
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:47,600
He was.

1577
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,380
Whispering.

1578
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:49,500
Answering.

1579
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:50,540
He said.

1580
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:51,520
I chose him.

1581
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,000
Alone.

1582
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,120
Avert my eyes.

1583
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:53,840
Could not help.

1584
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,380
Look upon.

1585
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:54,900
We fought.

1586
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:55,600
Cold hands.

1587
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,340
An iron grip.

1588
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,260
Breathless.

1589
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:58,720
Find the axe.

1590
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:58,940
OK.

1591
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,560
I have that.

1592
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:01,820
There you go.

1593
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,740
You strike hard against the center.

1594
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,640
And good night.

1595
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,240
Do I get some?

1596
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,100
Structure peels open.

1597
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,080
Split to its core.

1598
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,220
Glistening stone.

1599
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,360
And that's our thing.

1600
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:31,660
Very good.

1601
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,800
And what's that?

1602
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:38,920
This piece of art.

1603
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,300
Wait, what the heck is this?

1604
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,410
Orris Anchor.

1605
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:52,930
A fragment of a golden splintered horn.

1606
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:55,950
Discordant buzzing fills the surrounding air.

1607
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:57,410
It yearns for the deep.

1608
01:38:59,390 --> 01:38:59,870
Cast?

1609
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,310
Wait.

1610
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:02,150
I can cast it overboard.

1611
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:03,830
Wait, is that what I should do?

1612
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:09,330
If it's yearning for the deep, I just... I should send it back there, no?

1613
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:17,220
Just as the child yearns for the mines.

1614
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,040
Our little horn yearns for the deep.

1615
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,520
Rolling in the deep.

1616
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,680
I'm going to sleep.

1617
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:36,740
I really don't want to go crazy in this area.

1618
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,380
And by crazy I mean low sanity.

1619
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,480
Because this area scares me.

1620
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,380
And rest.

1621
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:52,320
Our big fish is probably going to turn into some...

1622
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,680
To rot though, I just realized.

1623
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:56,380
That's OK.

1624
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,260
There it is.

1625
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,160
Little rat.

1626
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:12,770
We got to go feed our narwhal friend.

1627
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:40,970
Low stock.

1628
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,130
That should be good enough for now.

1629
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:48,430
Gas, gas, gas.

1630
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:50,190
Let's give him some food.

1631
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:51,870
Leave us alone.

1632
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:55,010
Don't come any closer please.

1633
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,180
Oh my gosh.

1634
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,760
This would be the perfect...

1635
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,700
That would have been so close to perfect.

1636
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,580
Or it was so close to perfect.

1637
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:10,420
It would have been perfect.

1638
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:13,520
OK.

1639
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,620
Oh, screw you.

1640
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,420
Oh, it's just an ice fish.

1641
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,740
I like the astral one though.

1642
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,420
It's really cool.

1643
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,420
Oh.

1644
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:34,080
Oh my gosh.

1645
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:34,620
Stop please.

1646
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,320
Please.

1647
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:38,740
Wait, what are you?

1648
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:44,460
Wait.

1649
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:45,980
Wait, what are you?

1650
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,640
Didn't I... I didn't... I left my whole repair kit.

1651
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:53,660
Because I'm stupid.

1652
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,020
I was like, I have the ice breaker.

1653
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:58,420
I will need it.

1654
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,880
It's been a while since we've had a good bump.

1655
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,980
It's because I'm too good at the game.

1656
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,820
Finish the main quest in the Pale Reach.

1657
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:15,080
Oh, the glowing light intensifies, feeding into the four stones.

1658
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:18,480
A web of light grows between them, connecting, rejoining, uniting...

1659
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:19,560
What?

1660
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,800
That's some fancy stuff.

1661
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:30,980
Wait, then what do I do with this thing?

1662
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,720
Cast this overboard to create a reusable two-way portal to Blackstone Island.

1663
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:38,880
Oh, I should have read it.

1664
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,720
Oh, I should have read it.

1665
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,520
I should have read the description.

1666
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:50,900
Is that it?

1667
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,020
That's everything that's here?

1668
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:53,820
That's it?

1669
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:58,540
Wait, what about the thing the lady was talking about?

1670
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:03,410
We never found that.

1671
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:06,930
Like the ice maker.

1672
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:13,540
Greetings for nerds, we're fishermen.

1673
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:14,660
So true.

1674
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,720
The mini ice machine.

1675
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,120
Peculiar.

1676
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,040
Curious.

1677
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:29,220
So we completed the Pale Reach.

1678
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,700
Oh wait, find the ice shaper.

1679
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,580
Bring it, wait.

1680
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,920
Oh yeah, that's right.

1681
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:41,520
They wanted an aberrated...

1682
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,040
Lily Starves.

1683
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:45,760
Welcome to membership.

1684
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,000
Thank you so much.

1685
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:47,800
Thank you.

1686
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:48,600
You want a hint?

1687
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:49,280
No, it's okay.

1688
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,620
I think for right now, honestly, I don't even feel like I need it so much.

1689
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,800
Hold on, I'm just gonna re-read all of these.

1690
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,300
Very good, very nice.

1691
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,600
Go through my encyclopedia.

1692
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,660
Oh, there's even more things here that we haven't caught.

1693
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,320
Wow, what the heck is this?

1694
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,840
Wait, aberration of... I haven't even seen... Oh, this is from a pot.

1695
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,600
This is the open ocean.

1696
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,940
That just looks like a sunfish.

1697
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,140
Pot.

1698
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,080
So many fish in this game.

1699
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:34,740
There's so many fish.

1700
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:36,560
Laypine.

1701
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:37,300
Welcome to membership.

1702
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:38,260
Thank you so much.

1703
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,120
Thank you.

1704
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,560
Well, cool.

1705
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:43,580
I guess what I'll do is then... I'm gonna undock.

1706
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:48,920
What I'm gonna do is cast aside the little thing here.

1707
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:50,860
So, cast overboard.

1708
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,600
And I placed a portal.

1709
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:01,940
Wow.

1710
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:10,420
Our fish are still fresh, so let's go sell them.

1711
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,300
I don't wanna travel just yet.

1712
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,180
Wait, what's over here?

1713
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,440
Oh, this just leads outside.

1714
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,560
We can still check it though.

1715
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,500
Oh, that looks like some... Oh, wait.

1716
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,620
Did I just find it?

1717
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:40,810
And... easy.

1718
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:52,110
Yes.

1719
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:56,850
Well, very cool guys.

1720
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:01,830
Oh, that's scary.

1721
01:46:01,950 --> 01:46:02,430
I don't like that.

1722
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:06,330
I thought I saw something... in the water.

1723
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,600
Don't leave the portal.

1724
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,420
Wait, is it a one time use?

1725
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:24,390
Hmm...

1726
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,260
Oh, yes?

1727
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:30,020
Oh, you place it down and pick it up.

1728
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:30,720
Uh-oh.

1729
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,060
OK.

1730
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,620
You can pick it up.

1731
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,320
It's a portal wherever you leave it.

1732
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,720
I didn't realize.

1733
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,040
OK.

1734
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,400
OK, shipyard.

1735
01:46:58,520 --> 01:46:59,860
Let's repair my ship first.

1736
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,100
Oh, pricey.

1737
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,560
I think we can do this.

1738
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,480
Coastal oceanic.

1739
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:15,460
Awesome.

1740
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,980
We're never gonna need this thing again.

1741
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,580
OK, awesome.

1742
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,180
Oh, yeah, I don't think I had any.

1743
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:28,820
OK.

1744
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:31,620
OK.

1745
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,000
Very nice.

1746
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,660
It's 5, so let's undock.

1747
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:42,680
It's basically day.

1748
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,000
I'm not even a little bit crazy.

1749
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:50,840
Then... Oh, wait.

1750
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:54,260
Place it down.

1751
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:56,400
And keep going.

1752
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,880
OP net.

1753
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,820
For real though.

1754
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,080
Wait, this net is so good.

1755
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,400
It was worth the...

1756
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,540
There's my portal.

1757
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:08,260
Hello.

1758
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,860
Oh, yeah, it does say retrieve.

1759
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:21,120
Cool.

1760
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,840
Wait, do I have to go back to retrieve it?

1761
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,000
Ah, I see.

1762
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,320
Oh, I'm kinda crazy.

1763
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:30,060
Oopsie.

1764
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,080
My bad.

1765
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,580
Let's get out of here.

1766
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:38,380
Back to our normally scheduled programming.

1767
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:53,790
What the hell was that?

1768
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:56,610
It didn't damage my ship.

1769
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,690
Stupid drive-by shark.

1770
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:08,450
Wow.

1771
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:18,840
The portal also takes a heavy toll on your sanity.

1772
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:19,900
I can tell.

1773
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:21,420
Golly.

1774
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:22,940
What's this?

1775
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:24,260
Wait, what are you?

1776
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:27,300
What is this?

1777
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:30,900
Oh, it's a barrel-eye.

1778
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,660
This is a useless info and off-topic.

1779
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,100
Okay, I'll determine that.

1780
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,300
I need to share, otherwise I explode.

1781
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:43,520
Your anagrams are timid man or I am fit-tanned mom.

1782
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:49,260
Okay, you weren't wrong, road bird.

1783
01:49:54,690 --> 01:49:56,710
Alrighty, let's see.

1784
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:01,490
Our pursuits at the Iron Ring are...

1785
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:02,670
The researcher!

1786
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:04,670
Yes, that's right.

1787
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:12,110
The researcher was going to see about fixing the defenses of the Iron Ring.

1788
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:14,010
Yes, yes, yes.

1789
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:18,010
Hold on, I want to go through this again because there's some that...

1790
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:26,130
Fit-tanned mom.

1791
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:38,980
Big boy.

1792
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:56,670
Oh, big shark.

1793
01:50:58,730 --> 01:51:00,870
I'm still a little crazy, but...

1794
01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:06,570
That's fine, maybe.

1795
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:09,150
Where am I headed to?

1796
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:13,150
Let's...we need to go to...

1797
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,000
What's it?

1798
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,600
Oh, here, yes.

1799
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,700
Because we gotta go see the lady.

1800
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:25,860
Our researcher friend.

1801
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:27,900
What the?

1802
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,380
What do you mean something slithers?

1803
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,540
Ew, no!

1804
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,400
Oh, no, no!

1805
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,960
Being crazy is hard.

1806
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,520
Okay.

1807
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,420
She is over there.

1808
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,800
We can make it, surely.

1809
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,640
Nothing slithering onto our boat.

1810
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:02,940
We're getting less crazy.

1811
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:10,830
Full speed.

1812
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:14,550
I might be coming a little red.

1813
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:21,080
Let's fish some.

1814
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:21,660
Oh, wait.

1815
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:25,080
Actually, let's go sell this first because...

1816
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,960
After we...let's go sell all of our stuff.

1817
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:30,860
You got this, Minky.

1818
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:31,440
Thanks!

1819
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:34,760
Maybe.

1820
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:35,660
I'm red.

1821
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:36,520
Now I'm blue.

1822
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,000
Green.

1823
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,900
I'm always green.

1824
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,080
You can't stop me.

1825
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:46,420
You can't stop me from being green.

1826
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:48,100
My bad.

1827
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:00,370
405...

1828
01:53:00,370 --> 01:53:02,170
That thing is ugly.

1829
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:06,570
Eyes turned upwards, it lies in ambush.

1830
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:09,010
Looking to the sky for falling food.

1831
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:10,430
Stargazer.

1832
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:14,390
That thing is ugly.

1833
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:16,830
Nice.

1834
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,850
He's looking at me?

1835
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:21,190
I'm no food.

1836
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:26,090
You don't wanna know what ectoplasm tastes like.

1837
01:53:30,850 --> 01:53:32,710
I gotta move some of my stuff around.

1838
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,640
We're running out of space.

1839
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,080
I do still have my research parts.

1840
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:50,910
And we're gonna move that on board too.

1841
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:53,510
What was I doing here?

1842
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:55,150
Nothing.

1843
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:55,830
Undock.

1844
01:53:56,350 --> 01:53:57,390
I sold my stuff.

1845
01:53:57,950 --> 01:53:58,530
Now we can go.

1846
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:00,670
Ew, don't do that.

1847
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:12,900
Wait, which one's the...

1848
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,180
Vanish.

1849
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,040
What

1850
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:28,990
are you?

1851
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:41,750
Oh it's hideous.

1852
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:50,790
Mito is a fish.

1853
01:54:50,910 --> 01:54:52,450
In which area would she spawn?

1854
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:53,690
Hell.

1855
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:07,120
Hello researcher.

1856
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,200
Hello, a gun.

1857
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,200
What do you need?

1858
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,600
About those defenses on the rig.

1859
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:14,320
I hope they worked.

1860
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,800
The workers on the rig want to find a way to sabotage them.

1861
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:19,880
We'll say yes, they worked.

1862
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,440
Good, it's always nice to have additional data points.

1863
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:23,520
Anything else?

1864
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:25,100
Yeah, they want to sabotage them.

1865
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,000
Found their conscience, have they?

1866
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,340
I suppose they're wanting it to look like an accident.

1867
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:33,200
They wouldn't want to face the corporation's wrath.

1868
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,200
They were found culpable.

1869
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:36,560
Dia!

1870
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,600
Thank you for the raid!

1871
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:44,510
Hello party people.

1872
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:45,390
Hello!

1873
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:46,590
Thank you!

1874
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:48,930
Welcome, welcome.

1875
01:55:51,370 --> 01:55:53,990
My name is Mint Phantom.

1876
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:56,710
I always forget to introduce myself during raids.

1877
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:27,710
Yeah.

1878
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:33,970
Bugbug, thank you for the gift.

1879
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:35,370
And I saw that.

1880
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:38,070
Distracting super chat.

1881
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,370
Nailed it.

1882
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,170
Furby, thank you for the gift.

1883
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,890
We love Miss Freaky Phantom.

1884
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,830
That's my name, don't wear it out.

1885
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:57,230
Yeah, playing Dredge, I like this game.

1886
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:58,310
This game is a lot of fun.

1887
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:04,150
Ahuel, thank you for the gift.

1888
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:06,170
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

1889
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:09,350
Resting glitch face, thank you so much for the five gift.

1890
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:13,670
I do have a pleasingly elegant idea, actually.

1891
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:19,250
We don't have to sabotage the defenses in a traditional sense.

1892
01:57:19,730 --> 01:57:22,210
If you recall, they emit a sort of word.

1893
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:24,310
At the moment, they're broadcasting a warning.

1894
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:25,370
Flee.

1895
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:27,970
We can change that.

1896
01:57:28,290 --> 01:57:29,750
I have other recordings of other words.

1897
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:33,090
Instead of a warning, it could broadcast an invitation.

1898
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:39,110
CC, thank you for the five gift.

1899
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:44,670
There's one in particular I've been referring to.

1900
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:48,570
It's by its closest human analog, Rise.

1901
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:50,730
Rise.

1902
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:55,130
I'll prepare some blueprints for the module.

1903
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:58,950
You'll have to assemble it and slot it into the top of the black box.

1904
01:57:59,070 --> 01:57:59,990
Uh-oh, I might sneeze.

1905
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,560
Some blueprints.

1906
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:16,640
Oh my gosh, I wish.

1907
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:30,420
I'm here from the MGS playthroughs.

1908
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:34,560
Thank you.

1909
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:37,980
Glad you liked them.

1910
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,680
I kind of like Metal Gear.

1911
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:47,700
It's like a bit of a thing that I enjoy.

1912
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,300
Let's see.

1913
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:53,720
Let's sell this bad boy.

1914
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:55,900
Holy cow!

1915
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,320
472 doubloons!

1916
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:01,200
Let's go.

1917
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,400
We're back to getting big money back.

1918
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,340
We're back to being the richest pirate in the sea.

1919
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:12,780
Yeah, I mildly tolerate it.

1920
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:14,520
It's a bit of a secret.

1921
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,960
What else can we buy?

1922
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:22,240
Buy, buy, buy.

1923
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,480
Oh, we probably want to undo this one, huh?

1924
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:26,960
Wait.

1925
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:28,320
Sorry.

1926
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:29,600
I'm yawning again.

1927
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:30,720
Uninstall.

1928
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:34,980
Uninstall, uninstall.

1929
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:39,400
And let's do the infused one.

1930
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:44,940
Nice.

1931
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:47,140
What else can we install?

1932
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:51,080
Nothing.

1933
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:55,180
I don't think a single thing.

1934
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:59,060
Wait, so do I have to wait for her to do the blueprints?

1935
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:08,180
Override the defenses.

1936
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:11,440
I should construct an override at the loose panel in the defense tower.

1937
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,800
Oh, okay.

1938
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:13,800
I will do that.

1939
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:15,060
Wait, is this the loose tower?

1940
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:35,440
Outpost.

1941
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:36,180
No.

1942
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,480
Nah, there's nothing here.

1943
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:40,740
Okay.

1944
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:47,620
One year since my capture.

1945
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:50,440
Yeah.

1946
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:56,440
How are you enjoying the simple life?

1947
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:09,730
Minta with 2000 hours in an MGS game.

1948
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:10,310
It's okay.

1949
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:12,530
Yeah, you know.

1950
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:13,730
You gotta play it cool.

1951
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:16,890
I'm good at playing it cool.

1952
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:19,390
Everybody knows.

1953
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:22,390
Yeah, I'm just playing it cool.

1954
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:25,830
I'm just, you know, I'm such a cool cat.

1955
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,140
Lady, are you done?

1956
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:34,160
What do you need?

1957
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:35,740
Oh, it's nothing.

1958
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:36,180
Okay.

1959
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,240
Maybe I go back.

1960
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,460
Let's go back to the...

1961
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,380
This way?

1962
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,260
What is... Wait, what's that?

1963
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:55,750
Is this a...

1964
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:58,170
Yeah, it's a crate.

1965
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:03,050
We like to collect these.

1966
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:07,590
We don't care what's in them.

1967
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:08,770
We just like to collect the crate.

1968
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:12,190
Oh, this way.

1969
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:17,630
Yeah, I'm very cool.

1970
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:22,750
What does this thing do?

1971
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:25,650
Ice and shallow.

1972
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:33,010
I think those were the new ones that the old net didn't use.

1973
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:39,050
It goes to ice cold for a reason.

1974
02:02:44,610 --> 02:02:45,910
I'm too cool.

1975
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:46,730
I'm too calm.

1976
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:48,210
I'm too collect...

1977
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:49,630
Collect...

1978
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:50,630
Tuna.

1979
02:02:57,690 --> 02:02:59,010
Razor mouth tuna.

1980
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:20,660
Oh, it's just a squid.

1981
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:20,700
Squid.

1982
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:26,680
Are you ready, kids?

1983
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:28,220
Aye aye, captain.

1984
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,440
I can't hear you.

1985
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:31,940
Aye aye, captain.

1986
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:39,770
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

1987
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,210
Minky.

1988
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:43,690
Minky.

1989
02:03:45,210 --> 02:03:47,930
I'm a very huge fan of your Lieutenant Dan cosplay.

1990
02:03:48,210 --> 02:03:50,110
Very cool and very accurate.

1991
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:50,250
Accurate.

1992
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:57,210
What do you mean accurate?

1993
02:03:58,770 --> 02:04:00,130
What do you mean by that?

1994
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:04,110
I think I need to lose a limb though to make it more accurate.

1995
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,340
I do not like those guys.

1996
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:19,240
What the hell is this thing?

1997
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,040
A moonfish.

1998
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:24,080
What's that sound?

1999
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:27,640
Skeletal moonfish.

2000
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:32,420
Why do things sound really bad right now?

2001
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:33,360
Let's dock.

2002
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,440
Been trying to keep a record of all the black liquid... the dark liquid.

2003
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2004
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:43,960
I don't care.

2005
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:49,180
Ghostly body.

2006
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:50,800
Ghostly.

2007
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:53,160
How's me?

2008
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:54,760
Moonfish.

2009
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,400
It's kinda cute.

2010
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:58,920
I'm gonna feed all of the stuff to the generator.

2011
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,580
I know you get less money, but it's ok.

2012
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:02,420
Defenses.

2013
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,720
The rise.

2014
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:09,740
The rise.

2015
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,820
Rise, my children.

2016
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:23,360
Rise.

2017
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:23,480
What's that?

2018
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:30,560
Wait, this seems really bad.

2019
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:32,520
Wait, all the people are gonna die, no?

2020
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:34,720
Maybe not.

2021
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:37,880
My boat!

2022
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:38,760
Is it ok?

2023
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:41,720
Barely missed.

2024
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:42,460
Oh my god.

2025
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:51,030
See ya!

2026
02:05:53,590 --> 02:05:54,970
We've been saved!

2027
02:05:56,170 --> 02:06:02,690
With the last scraps of metal still falling from the destroyed drill tower, the executive boards his helicopter.

2028
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,050
Rotors already spinning.

2029
02:06:05,530 --> 02:06:06,590
Is everyone alright?

2030
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:08,950
All accounted for in the factory.

2031
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:12,070
Yep, foundry's fine.

2032
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:15,110
I guess we'll wait for our airlifts outta here.

2033
02:06:15,430 --> 02:06:17,650
There's no way I'm traveling anywhere by boat.

2034
02:06:18,490 --> 02:06:19,650
Yeah, I'll sit tight for now.

2035
02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:24,290
Fishermen, the main buildings are mostly undamaged, so if you still need stuff made, we can sort you out.

2036
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:29,250
I overrode the rig's defenses and that's...

2037
02:06:29,250 --> 02:06:29,950
Is that it?

2038
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:33,130
Is that... everything?

2039
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:37,590
For the iron rig?

2040
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:40,590
Besides collecting samples?

2041
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:43,070
Construct buildings on the rig.

2042
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:46,510
I haven't built a tier 4 factory.

2043
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:51,870
Wait, that was it?

2044
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:55,810
Tier 4.

2045
02:06:58,210 --> 02:06:59,670
Okay, let's go do this.

2046
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:06,780
Undock.

2047
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:12,280
Let's go find a crate, which I guess I have right here.

2048
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:14,380
I have listed on the map.

2049
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:17,600
Only thing left is samples.

2050
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:18,500
I think so too.

2051
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:21,680
Neat.

2052
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:26,500
So then maybe next stream we really can just finish the game.

2053
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:28,420
Unless I stream for longer today.

2054
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:31,400
I did start earlier because I was like, maybe I'll stream for a long time.

2055
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:33,440
But I'm actually starting to get hungry.

2056
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:35,900
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

2057
02:07:44,510 --> 02:07:44,910
There.

2058
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,500
Let me eat more popcorn.

2059
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:54,620
I don't have anymore popcorn.

2060
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:55,440
What's for dinner?

2061
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:00,180
Maybe ravioli.

2062
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:06,700
Maybe ravioli.

2063
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:10,160
I don't know yet.

2064
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:25,140
From the chef?

2065
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:25,780
No.

2066
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:28,860
Heck no.

2067
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:31,980
But I'm still kind of craving salmon from yesterday.

2068
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:35,660
Salmon.

2069
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:43,830
Fish fear me, doki fears me, women fear me, but snakes obsess with me.

2070
02:08:45,810 --> 02:08:47,830
That's like just my delusions though.

2071
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:49,110
I wish that were real.

2072
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:53,170
Guys, do you think snake would like me?

2073
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:57,170
You can be honest.

2074
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:59,330
Do you think snake would like me?

2075
02:09:06,910 --> 02:09:07,970
He liked Emma.

2076
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:22,270
Why is this lady...

2077
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:24,150
She talks, or she like...

2078
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:27,290
She hums like a Minecraft villager.

2079
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:28,730
That'll do it for the factory.

2080
02:09:28,730 --> 02:09:28,870
Sorry.

2081
02:09:32,870 --> 02:09:35,470
Build all levels of all buildings on the rig.

2082
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:38,390
What do we got here?

2083
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:39,430
Exotic bait.

2084
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:41,490
Oh my gosh, 700 dollars.

2085
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:43,550
Insta crab bait.

2086
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:46,570
That's actually really nice, no?

2087
02:09:48,210 --> 02:09:49,730
Wait, we need the mixed bait.

2088
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:54,290
We need a dark splash and we need some rot.

2089
02:09:58,030 --> 02:09:58,830
Yeah baby!

2090
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:01,310
I just need a little bit of a dark splash.

2091
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:07,110
And then the aberrated bait, which I still have.

2092
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:10,110
But I think some insta crab would be great.

2093
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:13,210
Would have been so useful.

2094
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:13,710
I know.

2095
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:20,700
What do you need again?

2096
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:25,450
Where are... Oh these are all volcanic.

2097
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:27,270
That was like dunklesores.

2098
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:32,830
What the heck is a dunklesores?

2099
02:10:35,050 --> 02:10:35,590
OK.

2100
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:40,800
So...

2101
02:10:41,980 --> 02:10:43,820
I guess it's time to go.

2102
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:51,280
19, I fear you're too old for snake's taste.

2103
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:13,680
I

2104
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:24,660
won't entertain this slander.

2105
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:27,280
Even if it's accurate.

2106
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:38,420
Don't like that.

2107
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:40,100
Let's go to sleep here.

2108
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:44,900
So we haven't really explored this area at all.

2109
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,960
Mito aren't you forever 19?

2110
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:48,480
Yes!

2111
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,200
I am forever.

2112
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:55,240
But Eva, Eva that's a naked snake.

2113
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,080
Holy cannoli.

2114
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:01,400
Alright.

2115
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:05,840
I can't see anything.

2116
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:08,320
I was like, oh I'll see better in the morning.

2117
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:09,640
Can't see.

2118
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:12,080
Can't see anything.

2119
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:17,920
So apparently here there's like little fishies that attach to you.

2120
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:19,960
Or they call for their mom.

2121
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,380
Or something.

2122
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:27,520
Think snake would kill billions for Minky.

2123
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:28,720
I don't think so.

2124
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,940
I don't think he'd like me.

2125
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:33,000
I'm gonna sell my fish.

2126
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:34,760
Wow!

2127
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:36,340
We caught a sailfish.

2128
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:37,020
That's crazy.

2129
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:40,880
Throw these.

2130
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,500
Oh no!

2131
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:48,920
Gonna have to start really doing some Tetris here.

2132
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,360
He didn't specify.

2133
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,360
Any of them.

2134
02:13:09,450 --> 02:13:09,650
Ok.

2135
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:12,390
So here...

2136
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:15,490
Let's go through our things again.

2137
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:17,190
Search for relics.

2138
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:19,490
Find the watch and devil's spine.

2139
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,830
So that's where we are at now.

2140
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:25,410
And light the statues with the fathomless flames.

2141
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:26,550
Ok.

2142
02:13:27,330 --> 02:13:28,970
And catch rare fish.

2143
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:31,030
Ok.

2144
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:33,310
Oh we got to catch a coelacanth.

2145
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:41,450
Solidus would love you maybe.

2146
02:13:42,170 --> 02:13:43,790
I like Solidus.

2147
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:49,790
I think the only one I wouldn't go with is Liquid.

2148
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,180
So I gotta eat some goldfish.

2149
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:42,300
Coelacanth is here.

2150
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:43,980
Goliath tiger is in the swamp.

2151
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:44,640
Oh!

2152
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:45,740
Thank you.

2153
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:52,140
I think your only hope is Venom?

2154
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:53,200
Don't say that.

2155
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:56,020
Don't say that!

2156
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:00,560
Guys, I'm out of goldfish.

2157
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,060
No!

2158
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:05,780
Mogu mogu.

2159
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:13,180
Do they have goldfish crackers in Japan?

2160
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:19,020
You don't like Venom?

2161
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:21,140
No, he's so boring!

2162
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:22,860
I

2163
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:28,940
need my man to be a little bit more unhinged.

2164
02:15:32,420 --> 02:15:33,460
And talkative.

2165
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:36,800
What do I just do there and talk the whole time?

2166
02:15:44,070 --> 02:15:47,430
Yeah, let's not get into spoiler territory though.

2167
02:15:49,450 --> 02:15:52,150
We'll call it here so we avoid spoilers.

2168
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:58,130
I think I'm gonna... I don't think we'll get any more.

2169
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:03,710
I don't want to sell this just in case we get more slots, you know, but...

2170
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:09,130
Which MGS gal is your favorite then?

2171
02:16:10,590 --> 02:16:11,630
That's hard!

2172
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:13,290
Maybe Meiling.

2173
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:16,550
19 inches of Venom.

2174
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:18,670
What are you talking about?

2175
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:20,810
Alright.

2176
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:25,410
So we gotta go light up some stuff here.

2177
02:16:26,630 --> 02:16:30,590
Which... Let's just go to the X's on the map.

2178
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:31,990
Maybe?

2179
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:33,590
What is this?

2180
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:39,450
Something shiny.

2181
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,140
So it's like right here, no?

2182
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:51,160
Oh my god.

2183
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:57,500
I just... I just... I just tapped it.

2184
02:16:57,580 --> 02:16:58,540
I didn't mean to.

2185
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:01,540
A stone shrine.

2186
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:03,860
An upright slab bears a carving.

2187
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:07,760
Two heavily plated creatures locked in battle.

2188
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:10,640
A lower slab holds two shallow grooves.

2189
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,840
What the hell?

2190
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:14,340
Okay.

2191
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:16,320
Let's go get our insta-crab.

2192
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:17,640
Bait.

2193
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:24,040
Let's get the insta-crab bait.

2194
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,120
Return the slab.

2195
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:30,300
I gotta... I gotta repair my ship first.

2196
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:33,700
Well,

2197
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:40,680
wait a second.

2198
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,280
I do have a large crab pot.

2199
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:43,380
What if I just leave it here?

2200
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:47,600
But, I wanted to get some slime.

2201
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:50,680
And...

2202
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:50,740
Look.

2203
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:56,860
I wanted to get some slime, so let's get this as well.

2204
02:17:58,460 --> 02:17:59,480
Come here slime.

2205
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:00,980
What are you?

2206
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,060
What is this?

2207
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:12,740
And pop!

2208
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:13,600
Nice.

2209
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:14,040
Alright.

2210
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:19,440
It might take over that guy.

2211
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:20,660
We'll put it in like the corner.

2212
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:22,200
Okay.

2213
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:26,120
Normal fish.

2214
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:29,680
Normal is subjective maybe.

2215
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:31,000
Can I go over these?

2216
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:31,800
I'm gonna test it.

2217
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:32,880
I can!

2218
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:39,000
I was for sure thinking they would hurt my vessel.

2219
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:41,840
What do I need from this one?

2220
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:42,580
Let's see.

2221
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:45,160
Maybe we can stick this guy some...

2222
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:45,480
Oh.

2223
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:01,200
Is it still chasing after me?

2224
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:02,900
No?

2225
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:05,400
Oh gosh.

2226
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,780
Maybe I can banish these things.

2227
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:13,300
Why can't I ever... Oh, banish.

2228
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:15,560
Why can't I ever remember what each thing does?

2229
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:20,940
Maybe... Let's go around.

2230
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:26,820
Oh.

2231
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:28,320
Never mind.

2232
02:19:28,380 --> 02:19:28,880
They are everywhere.

2233
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:30,140
Let's see.

2234
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:31,140
Let's try it.

2235
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:35,280
I banished it!

2236
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:41,560
Okay,

2237
02:19:44,860 --> 02:19:45,620
I guess that worked.

2238
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:47,320
Very cool.

2239
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:49,840
And I'm a little crazy.

2240
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:53,000
Might not be the best place to be crazy in, but...

2241
02:19:54,580 --> 02:19:56,080
A stone shrine.

2242
02:19:57,360 --> 02:20:00,360
Two malformed fish writhing under the sun.

2243
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:03,940
That's it?

2244
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:08,060
Can it be any fish?

2245
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:14,000
The what's it called seems pretty big, so...

2246
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:31,610
They are calling their mom!

2247
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:34,890
Just two abnormal fish.

2248
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:35,130
Okay.

2249
02:20:35,630 --> 02:20:37,350
First we are going to go get our crab thing.

2250
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:38,830
Six!

2251
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:39,430
Welcome to the membership.

2252
02:20:39,550 --> 02:20:40,110
Thank you.

2253
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:41,390
Any two aberrations.

2254
02:20:41,590 --> 02:20:41,950
Nice.

2255
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:42,250
Okay.

2256
02:20:43,330 --> 02:20:44,450
That doesn't seem too bad.

2257
02:21:05,550 --> 02:21:09,910
You might have some in your net.

2258
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:14,790
I do have one tiny guy!

2259
02:21:18,370 --> 02:21:19,410
I do!

2260
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:26,050
The cell to the generator.

2261
02:21:26,370 --> 02:21:27,910
This guy...

2262
02:21:34,310 --> 02:21:35,390
He's in storage.

2263
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:35,650
Wait.

2264
02:21:35,910 --> 02:21:36,370
There he goes.

2265
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:37,750
Into cargo.

2266
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:38,590
There we go.

2267
02:21:38,590 --> 02:21:40,810
Okay, we have one tiny little man.

2268
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:43,270
And then let's go to the factory.

2269
02:21:44,290 --> 02:21:47,990
And we'll get our tier 4 crab bait.

2270
02:21:52,210 --> 02:21:52,790
Nice.

2271
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:57,830
Attracts the rarest of fish.

2272
02:21:58,570 --> 02:22:00,050
Wait a second, we can make this too.

2273
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:10,240
Fancy.

2274
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:14,280
Glad to have been here a year.

2275
02:22:14,440 --> 02:22:15,180
Excited for more!

2276
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,920
Thank you!

2277
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:19,800
Thank you so much for a whole year.

2278
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:24,760
I don't like the music here.

2279
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,540
It annoys my ears.

2280
02:22:28,820 --> 02:22:30,260
It's just a little too much.

2281
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:35,280
Oops, my bad.

2282
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:45,180
We go back.

2283
02:22:55,230 --> 02:22:56,890
This place spooks me though.

2284
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:58,690
All the places spook me.

2285
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:05,090
One year of making... Thank you!

2286
02:23:07,930 --> 02:23:10,750
Alright, before our little guy rots away...

2287
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:13,150
Let's... Oh, he's still fresh actually.

2288
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:17,690
Let's go check our crab pot.

2289
02:23:17,690 --> 02:23:17,890
What?

2290
02:23:20,270 --> 02:23:24,990
I don't want to go back over there until we have a second freaky guy.

2291
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:29,350
What the hell is that?

2292
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:34,680
Not friend.

2293
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:37,060
Not good.

2294
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:43,710
That's the mom?

2295
02:23:43,870 --> 02:23:44,970
Oh, that's the mom!

2296
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:45,470
Come on.

2297
02:23:49,850 --> 02:23:52,330
What the hell is that?

2298
02:23:55,310 --> 02:23:56,690
She's not coming this way, is she?

2299
02:23:57,710 --> 02:23:59,370
Nah, she's chilling over there.

2300
02:24:01,850 --> 02:24:02,290
No.

2301
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:03,770
Yes, bait.

2302
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:05,890
It counts as a bait, no?

2303
02:24:06,470 --> 02:24:07,130
Yeah, okay.

2304
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:18,620
Wait, but...

2305
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:29,190
Wait, huh?

2306
02:24:30,950 --> 02:24:31,550
Wrong bait.

2307
02:24:31,790 --> 02:24:32,650
Did I use the wrong one?

2308
02:24:33,470 --> 02:24:34,610
How do I know which one I used?

2309
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:36,550
Oh, it's the crab bait.

2310
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:47,770
Aren't those the guys I need?

2311
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:53,100
Aren't those the guys I need?

2312
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:57,720
I got both of them.

2313
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:00,000
Easy peasy.

2314
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:00,340
Easy peasy.

2315
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:04,060
Where is your mama?

2316
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:07,320
Maybe it's fine.

2317
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:13,440
Okay, it sounds kinda... I think that's her sound.

2318
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:15,940
She seems a little far, so...

2319
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:19,460
Alright, we light her up!

2320
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:24,000
These guys look expensive.

2321
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:28,600
The rock splits with an almighty crack.

2322
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,360
It crumbles away, revealing its core.

2323
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:38,110
Okay.

2324
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:40,090
How are you doing?

2325
02:25:40,190 --> 02:25:41,990
He's a little stale, but not dead yet.

2326
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:44,370
And some wood.

2327
02:25:45,890 --> 02:25:46,910
Do I light you up?

2328
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:53,830
Is that it?

2329
02:25:56,450 --> 02:25:57,310
Is that it?

2330
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:04,640
It's crossed off the map, so I guess so.

2331
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,640
Very nice.

2332
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,340
I'm gonna sell these then.

2333
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:14,760
Maybe get some ice.

2334
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:20,040
It probably did...

2335
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:22,680
It probably did... Yeah, I had ice in it.

2336
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:26,320
Definitely...

2337
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:31,000
Definitely melted.

2338
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:33,620
As ice tends to do.

2339
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:34,240
Well...

2340
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:39,710
Maybe we'll get something.

2341
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:40,610
Maybe we'll get lucky.

2342
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:41,470
Let's just try this.

2343
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:45,390
We might get lucky.

2344
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:58,620
Wow, this thing is freaky!

2345
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:00,780
Giant dragonfish.

2346
02:27:08,810 --> 02:27:10,070
I'm gonna sell that.

2347
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:15,290
I think I might just have to get rid of this little guy.

2348
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:17,010
We'll find another one, I'm sure.

2349
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:19,070
If I get one, I won't remove it.

2350
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:19,570
It's my fault.

2351
02:27:19,710 --> 02:27:22,290
I shouldn't have removed it from the net.

2352
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:23,150
That was my fault.

2353
02:27:24,350 --> 02:27:28,150
Let's just sell him before he... Also, he's oceanic.

2354
02:27:28,190 --> 02:27:28,910
Does that even count?

2355
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:30,930
Does it have to be volcanic?

2356
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:31,150
Oceanic?

2357
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:44,910
We're officially full.

2358
02:27:45,090 --> 02:27:48,750
Wait, let's use some of our research thingies.

2359
02:27:49,390 --> 02:27:51,230
We can... Do I need this?

2360
02:27:51,290 --> 02:27:51,390
No.

2361
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:56,130
We can research more crab pots.

2362
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:15,660
Oceanic.

2363
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:18,920
Oceanic.

2364
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:27,680
We'll keep him in there for now.

2365
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:29,240
I'm gonna go around.

2366
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:33,920
Let's check out what the other...

2367
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:37,020
guy is.

2368
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:37,920
The other...

2369
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:40,160
All the way over here.

2370
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:45,200
What is this?

2371
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:46,620
Oh.

2372
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,940
That's just a whale.

2373
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:53,340
How curious.

2374
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:57,640
Gosh, this area sucks.

2375
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,660
I don't like it.

2376
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:02,620
It's so hard to maneuver.

2377
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:07,180
A stone tablet.

2378
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:10,520
Wait, you mean pursuit added.

2379
02:29:12,060 --> 02:29:13,280
I'm not doing enough for you?

2380
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:18,200
Visit the trader.

2381
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:20,400
Oh, take the tablet to the trader.

2382
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:23,340
I found an ancient stone tablet with a strange glyph on it.

2383
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:26,900
Looks similar to the ones I saw on the trader's desk in Little Morrow.

2384
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,620
Like down here?

2385
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:35,660
Trader.

2386
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,860
Actually, this is good.

2387
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:43,100
Because we have a bunch of stuff to sell.

2388
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:45,200
So let's just do that.

2389
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:48,120
Tablet lore is heavy in this game.

2390
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:48,600
What?

2391
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:50,120
Oh no, seriously?

2392
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:54,160
Wait, is he the trader?

2393
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:11,010
What is it?

2394
02:30:12,210 --> 02:30:15,890
Oh, he's the collector.

2395
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:17,410
What's in the workshop?

2396
02:30:19,410 --> 02:30:22,470
You go inside, taking a moment to let your eyes adjust to the dim light.

2397
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:24,430
You find some horrifying creations.

2398
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:26,650
Wait, what is this?

2399
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:29,590
A symbol of the deep is carved into this small talisman.

2400
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:32,470
It's sure to draw the attention of those attuned to it.

2401
02:30:35,930 --> 02:30:36,670
Mine, no.

2402
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:40,310
The bony blades of this grotesque engine are...

2403
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:41,530
Oh, it's an engine!

2404
02:30:43,150 --> 02:30:44,170
But mine is better.

2405
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:46,130
Oh man.

2406
02:30:52,830 --> 02:30:53,610
Mine is better.

2407
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:56,450
OK.

2408
02:30:58,990 --> 02:30:59,410
Trader.

2409
02:31:02,270 --> 02:31:04,790
We have a lot of stuff to sell to this guy.

2410
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:06,630
So actually it's good to come back here.

2411
02:31:10,570 --> 02:31:11,850
DLC starter gear.

2412
02:31:13,770 --> 02:31:15,090
Oh, this guy!

2413
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:16,770
What can I do for you?

2414
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:17,610
Show him the tablet.

2415
02:31:18,750 --> 02:31:23,990
The trader takes the stone tablet from you and inspects it closely, turning it over in his hands.

2416
02:31:24,550 --> 02:31:25,030
Remarkable.

2417
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:27,890
Yes, I do believe this is a fragment of a larger arrangement.

2418
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:33,890
He reaches up to a high shelf and brings down a similar looking stone, albeit one covered in much more dust.

2419
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:37,770
Some years ago I acquired this other piece.

2420
02:31:38,450 --> 02:31:43,610
You found this near those ruins in Devil's Spine, didn't you?

2421
02:31:43,610 --> 02:31:44,090
Yeah.

2422
02:31:44,890 --> 02:31:46,410
Well, I suspect there will be more out there.

2423
02:31:46,610 --> 02:31:49,590
I'll hold on to this for now and study it further while you search for the other fragments.

2424
02:31:50,170 --> 02:31:51,470
In the meantime, do you have any trinkets?

2425
02:31:51,610 --> 02:31:54,310
I have so many trinkets, sir.

2426
02:31:55,310 --> 02:31:56,050
Oh, that's tea.

2427
02:31:56,410 --> 02:31:57,830
I have this.

2428
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:02,390
Actually, sell...

2429
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,560
OK, I have three trinkets.

2430
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:09,340
I might have overestimated how many trinkets I had for you.

2431
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:18,400
I might have gotten a little overzealous about my trinket amount.

2432
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:22,940
Oh, my bad.

2433
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,240
Sell all trinkets.

2434
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:26,100
Bye bye.

2435
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:29,060
And let's go to the flag guy, the painter.

2436
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:31,740
Deliver flag.

2437
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:34,720
No, I like my pirate flag.

2438
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:36,600
Leave.

2439
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:38,820
Cool.

2440
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:40,280
Unlock.

2441
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:51,950
Find more tablets.

2442
02:32:52,810 --> 02:32:54,270
So there's only three statues?

2443
02:32:55,010 --> 02:32:57,110
Why did it look like there were so many more on the map?

2444
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:02,090
I had one.

2445
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,430
Wait, I had one more?

2446
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:05,910
What did I have?

2447
02:33:10,690 --> 02:33:11,390
Oh, this.

2448
02:33:11,810 --> 02:33:13,470
Yes, the sextant.

2449
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:17,010
Yes, I always forget that it is this.

2450
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:19,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2451
02:33:20,130 --> 02:33:20,770
Thank you.

2452
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:23,010
It looks like a...

2453
02:33:24,210 --> 02:33:26,810
A piece of a boat, so I forget.

2454
02:33:27,410 --> 02:33:28,130
Thank you guys.

2455
02:33:29,170 --> 02:33:30,170
Thank you, thank you.

2456
02:33:37,950 --> 02:33:39,850
I'm gonna sell my fishies while we're here.

2457
02:33:41,470 --> 02:33:42,590
Make color boat?

2458
02:33:42,690 --> 02:33:44,710
I don't have the cram for it.

2459
02:33:46,330 --> 02:33:48,790
I haven't seen that strange red light in a while.

2460
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:57,860
And we're gonna repair.

2461
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:24,840
Alright, so we need to get some...

2462
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:30,300
I think I asked earlier, and I didn't check what you guys said if you said it.

2463
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:39,580
For the map, or for the light that requires the mutated guys...

2464
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:43,660
Can it be anyone from anywhere, or does it have to be volcanic?

2465
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:50,380
For the mutated fishies, for the lamp.

2466
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:52,960
If anybody knows.

2467
02:34:53,460 --> 02:34:54,180
I think it's Annie.

2468
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:57,960
That would be great.

2469
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:00,280
Anyone from anywhere?

2470
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:02,160
Let's go back then.

2471
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:04,760
I saw one over here.

2472
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:11,580
Yeah, I see it lit up in the distance.

2473
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:13,300
You!

2474
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:18,200
What is this anyway?

2475
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:20,760
Oh, it's a snake mackerel.

2476
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:25,260
There, one.

2477
02:35:30,180 --> 02:35:31,300
One moment please.

2478
02:35:42,850 --> 02:35:44,230
Let's go sleep.

2479
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,880
Oh, I was gonna say, that's a boat over there.

2480
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:54,580
It's not a boat.

2481
02:35:54,580 --> 02:35:54,660
It's not a boat.

2482
02:35:55,560 --> 02:35:56,600
It's the port.

2483
02:35:58,600 --> 02:35:58,900
Alright.

2484
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:03,300
Okay.

2485
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:05,060
Alright.

2486
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:10,900
Okay, alright, okay, alright, okay, alright, okay, alright.

2487
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:14,100
What's this guy got to...

2488
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:16,240
We don't have anything to talk to him about.

2489
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:18,280
Statues.

2490
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:20,520
We don't have anything here.

2491
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:22,300
Stone columns.

2492
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:23,660
Nothing there.

2493
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:25,220
Okay, I've looked at all this stuff already.

2494
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:29,400
Oh, Andrew!

2495
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:31,860
Thank you for the brain.

2496
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:34,000
Hello, hello, hello.

2497
02:36:35,580 --> 02:36:39,740
Hello people, I'm playing this game called Dredge.

2498
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:40,900
My name is Mifrater.

2499
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:49,040
It's kind of spooky, but also really fun.

2500
02:36:51,580 --> 02:36:53,340
I think I can... Wait.

2501
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:55,440
Why is it so red?

2502
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:58,620
Why is it actually so, so red?

2503
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:00,920
Holy cannoli.

2504
02:37:04,340 --> 02:37:06,460
We gotta get another freaky fish.

2505
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:14,110
Scary, but fun.

2506
02:37:14,330 --> 02:37:16,830
It's pretty cozy, I mean, all things considered.

2507
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:19,930
It is pretty cozy.

2508
02:37:22,330 --> 02:37:23,450
What is this?

2509
02:37:24,270 --> 02:37:25,830
Oh wait, I can probably blow this up, huh?

2510
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:29,770
Use explosives.

2511
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:32,090
I gotta go get some explosives.

2512
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:34,610
Let's go get some.

2513
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:37,010
She should have some, no?

2514
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:37,830
The lady.

2515
02:37:45,810 --> 02:37:47,070
I don't like the mama fish.

2516
02:37:49,470 --> 02:37:50,730
Indy, if you had a boat.

2517
02:37:58,930 --> 02:38:00,270
Let's get some explosives.

2518
02:38:00,370 --> 02:38:02,350
That looks to be like maybe another...

2519
02:38:02,350 --> 02:38:03,030
Oh, okay.

2520
02:38:04,090 --> 02:38:05,330
We're docking here.

2521
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:12,100
Oh, she sells ice even.

2522
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:13,080
Oh, that's good.

2523
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:18,060
You know what?

2524
02:38:18,100 --> 02:38:18,540
Why not?

2525
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:19,760
Let's just buy some ice.

2526
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:26,760
Let's keep our fish a little... It's stale, but we can make it not so stale.

2527
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:29,960
I wish someone would dredge my marriage from the depths.

2528
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:30,920
Am I right, fellas?

2529
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:38,880
Sir, I'm a VTuber.

2530
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:41,640
Sir?

2531
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:57,220
Big ol' crabs.

2532
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:08,320
Hold on, sorry.

2533
02:39:08,380 --> 02:39:12,160
I know I keep going back to her, but I'm just gonna get rid of stuff that...

2534
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:15,660
Like this stuff, you know?

2535
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:18,720
Okay.

2536
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:20,140
Just so we can have enough room.

2537
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:23,240
And just in case I hit something, I don't want to lose it on accident.

2538
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:27,920
Sir, this is a Wendy's.

2539
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:29,400
I kind of want a Wendy's.

2540
02:39:31,980 --> 02:39:34,380
I have a go-to Wendy's order.

2541
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:37,460
Because Wendy's sells baked potatoes.

2542
02:39:37,820 --> 02:39:39,540
I like that a whole lot.

2543
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:42,860
I like their baked potatoes.

2544
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:47,160
I mean, it's just a baked potato, but... I don't know.

2545
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:51,260
Use explosives.

2546
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:53,340
Noice.

2547
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,680
Drop the meal.

2548
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,260
Baked potato.

2549
02:40:11,880 --> 02:40:14,160
That sure was unfortunate.

2550
02:40:24,910 --> 02:40:27,110
Let's go put this guy into the fountain.

2551
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,260
Or not fountain.

2552
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:42,220
Wait, what's it called?

2553
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:44,320
Wait, where am I?

2554
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:45,640
I think I'm lost.

2555
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:46,260
Hold on.

2556
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:48,480
Where was it?

2557
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:58,200
The lantern.

2558
02:40:58,440 --> 02:40:59,120
The light.

2559
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:03,540
Why is it turned so red?

2560
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:04,540
I don't like this.

2561
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:07,240
I think... Was it over there?

2562
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:08,760
Yes.

2563
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:11,320
Spicy nugs.

2564
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:16,160
Uh-oh.

2565
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:17,980
I think mama's coming.

2566
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:20,460
Wait mama, please wait.

2567
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:21,440
Mama.

2568
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:22,440
Mama.

2569
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:23,520
Where

2570
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:46,920
is she anyway?

2571
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:57,470
I need... I almost hit that rock.

2572
02:41:57,910 --> 02:41:59,990
The wind blows.

2573
02:42:03,030 --> 02:42:04,350
Please leave me alone.

2574
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:06,730
I'm not in the mood for your...

2575
02:42:07,550 --> 02:42:08,350
Wait.

2576
02:42:09,730 --> 02:42:10,490
Wait.

2577
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:11,590
Wait.

2578
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:13,510
Over there.

2579
02:42:15,970 --> 02:42:17,450
Wait, I need this.

2580
02:42:18,470 --> 02:42:19,030
No!

2581
02:42:19,450 --> 02:42:20,350
I'm volcanic!

2582
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:24,350
Ok, we got to buy a new rod.

2583
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:30,060
We got to buy a new rod.

2584
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:32,060
Ok.

2585
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:33,940
Yeah, I do have a few holes.

2586
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,440
Oh, my light went out.

2587
02:42:44,410 --> 02:42:47,890
I'm punching the air right now.

2588
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:52,010
No!

2589
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:02,150
Let's buy this.

2590
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:28,100
I have... Wait, I have the rod?

2591
02:43:33,890 --> 02:43:34,450
Oopsie.

2592
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:37,790
How much was it?

2593
02:43:38,070 --> 02:43:38,890
Anyway, sell that.

2594
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:43,290
Oops.

2595
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:50,280
Will it fit?

2596
02:43:51,420 --> 02:43:52,220
Yes, it will.

2597
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:00,330
What?

2598
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:13,020
Anyway, it's morning.

2599
02:44:45,950 --> 02:44:49,350
Why can't I find this stinking thing every time?

2600
02:44:49,410 --> 02:44:50,150
Get off of me!

2601
02:44:53,250 --> 02:44:54,610
You're making me slow.

2602
02:44:56,830 --> 02:44:58,810
Why am I so bad at finding this thing?

2603
02:45:01,230 --> 02:45:02,370
Wait, what's in there?

2604
02:45:07,170 --> 02:45:09,250
Why does it look different every day?

2605
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:15,420
No one likes to be slow.

2606
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:16,320
What's that in there?

2607
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:17,760
Is that another...

2608
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:18,200
Oh, wait.

2609
02:45:18,480 --> 02:45:18,840
You know what?

2610
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:20,660
We're just going to go buy a bunch of C4.

2611
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,400
And not have to deal with it.

2612
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:26,180
And deal with those stinking fish.

2613
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:29,060
Except I'm going to have to deal with them right here.

2614
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:31,280
Leave me alone, please.

2615
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:31,720
Mama!

2616
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:33,140
Mama!

2617
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:33,280
Mama!

2618
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,180
Please leave me alone.

2619
02:45:35,220 --> 02:45:35,900
Mama, please.

2620
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:38,000
Oh my god.

2621
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:38,920
The

2622
02:45:47,400 --> 02:45:52,200
rock splits and almighty... What the heck is this?

2623
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,080
To my storage you go.

2624
02:45:55,700 --> 02:45:56,240
And you too.

2625
02:45:57,220 --> 02:45:58,160
We lit a flame!

2626
02:46:03,410 --> 02:46:04,990
I don't like this area.

2627
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:05,970
It's so frustrating.

2628
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:12,500
Blip bloop.

2629
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:13,160
Blip bloop.

2630
02:46:15,220 --> 02:46:17,220
Yeah, we're going to read that...

2631
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:19,160
Soon.

2632
02:46:22,320 --> 02:46:24,060
Okay, we can read it now.

2633
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:24,980
They're all gone.

2634
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:27,800
Oh wait, I have to go to my storage.

2635
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:33,080
Okay.

2636
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:34,240
Okay.

2637
02:46:35,140 --> 02:46:36,420
What is that?

2638
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:41,400
This freaky thing is a stone tablet surrounded by tooth and bone.

2639
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:44,080
A glyph of a hook is carved into the center.

2640
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:47,780
Okay.

2641
02:46:52,530 --> 02:46:54,970
Wait, I can put it on my...

2642
02:46:59,190 --> 02:47:00,930
Oh wait, fishing speed...

2643
02:47:03,290 --> 02:47:05,430
I'm sorry, 375%?

2644
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:13,600
But what does it... It just gives speed?

2645
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:22,350
It doesn't catch any types, it's just faster.

2646
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:31,740
Your expression makes me think you pooped yourself.

2647
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:33,780
Why would you send that to me?

2648
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:52,680
What do you think I'm an actual baby?

2649
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:58,200
You think I'm like a real baby with diapers?

2650
02:48:05,400 --> 02:48:06,200
Is

2651
02:48:10,360 --> 02:48:12,300
it because I'm saying mama?

2652
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:16,180
I'm not talking about a real mom.

2653
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:20,680
I'm talking about this ugly fish lady mom.

2654
02:48:21,060 --> 02:48:21,920
Fish mom.

2655
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:24,560
Aren't you?

2656
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:25,000
No!

2657
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:29,980
Does 19 sound like a baby?

2658
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:34,620
19 forever even?

2659
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:37,040
Don't send poop.

2660
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:38,740
Don't send poop.

2661
02:48:40,420 --> 02:48:41,540
I sprung a leak.

2662
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:41,940
Oops.

2663
02:48:43,300 --> 02:48:44,640
I'm just casually sinking.

2664
02:48:46,540 --> 02:48:49,040
Let's sell all of our fish.

2665
02:48:49,860 --> 02:48:50,580
Nice.

2666
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:52,360
Making a big bunch of money.

2667
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:01,520
Anyone under 20 is a child to me.

2668
02:49:08,690 --> 02:49:12,370
Hey Christian, I know you might be worried, but not really the place.

2669
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:16,250
Trying to remember the rules.

2670
02:49:16,410 --> 02:49:17,210
Thank you.

2671
02:49:19,650 --> 02:49:21,090
19 is baby.

2672
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:26,370
Can't drink you baby.

2673
02:49:26,670 --> 02:49:27,730
Depends on the country.

2674
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:31,370
Also, I don't drink anyway.

2675
02:49:33,490 --> 02:49:36,930
Also, you don't even know what age you need to be as a ghost to drink.

2676
02:49:39,970 --> 02:49:42,210
So, you don't even know.

2677
02:49:43,790 --> 02:49:45,150
You're so wrong.

2678
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:55,880
Alright, we got two.

2679
02:49:57,140 --> 02:49:59,180
We just got to go get... What was this one?

2680
02:49:59,400 --> 02:50:00,200
I don't think we even...

2681
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:01,400
Oh, I was going to buy C4.

2682
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:01,820
That's right.

2683
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:05,700
Give me that.

2684
02:50:05,960 --> 02:50:07,480
I'm not even buying more ice.

2685
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:08,300
It's a scam.

2686
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:22,620
Where is it?

2687
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:24,640
Over yonder.

2688
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:28,880
Ghost drink booze.

2689
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:30,800
Oh,

2690
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:41,540
there it is.

2691
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:48,300
The hell is that sound?

2692
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:00,820
What do you wish?

2693
02:51:00,940 --> 02:51:01,780
What do you require?

2694
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:05,600
Or...

2695
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:11,500
How do I acquire these?

2696
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:15,380
Wait, I feel like I've gotten at least this thing.

2697
02:51:18,710 --> 02:51:20,310
The one on the... Wait a second.

2698
02:51:20,650 --> 02:51:21,430
Pale skate?

2699
02:51:22,750 --> 02:51:23,330
From a pot?

2700
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:25,750
Wait, I've gotten both of these before.

2701
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:30,490
Wait, I've gotten these before.

2702
02:51:31,910 --> 02:51:33,570
I just have to get them again.

2703
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:34,970
Ghost shark.

2704
02:51:39,230 --> 02:51:39,950
So...

2705
02:51:40,570 --> 02:51:43,890
I have to fish the ghost shark though.

2706
02:51:48,510 --> 02:51:51,010
So that guy sound... I heard...

2707
02:51:51,010 --> 02:51:54,090
She sounded awfully close, so...

2708
02:51:56,030 --> 02:51:57,050
Wait, what's this?

2709
02:51:57,570 --> 02:51:58,230
Are you a ghost?

2710
02:51:58,610 --> 02:51:59,710
Oh my gosh.

2711
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:01,830
Easiest...

2712
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:02,590
A what?

2713
02:52:03,850 --> 02:52:05,630
A rapt shark.

2714
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:07,050
I don't like that.

2715
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:13,770
Wait, they are not going to get my trophy.

2716
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:15,030
It's depleted.

2717
02:52:24,940 --> 02:52:26,980
I told you guys she sounded close.

2718
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,760
I told you guys she sounded close.

2719
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:47,580
Ok, maybe from our crab pot...

2720
02:52:48,380 --> 02:52:49,240
Pick up.

2721
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:50,400
Please repair.

2722
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:55,860
That was so close.

2723
02:53:02,180 --> 02:53:02,720
Alright.

2724
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:05,360
We are going to sell you.

2725
02:53:06,560 --> 02:53:10,380
Or first we are going to repair our... We are going to repair the crab pot.

2726
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:12,180
Because we are going to...

2727
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:16,860
Wait, but we can just fish another ghost shark since it's right next to her.

2728
02:53:17,300 --> 02:53:18,340
Or right next to the thing.

2729
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:22,340
I think we can... I think we can sell all of these, honestly.

2730
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:26,460
And make the most out of our money, baby.

2731
02:53:28,140 --> 02:53:28,660
Ok.

2732
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:31,980
Thank you so much.

2733
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:32,500
Thank you.

2734
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:33,760
You can banish mommy.

2735
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:34,260
Ok.

2736
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:35,720
Mommy.

2737
02:53:36,840 --> 02:53:37,360
Ok.

2738
02:53:43,060 --> 02:53:44,460
Oh, I should have...

2739
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:48,900
I'm a silly goose.

2740
02:53:49,640 --> 02:53:51,340
I should have put this down first.

2741
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:58,640
It did say that we can get her in the crab pot.

2742
02:54:06,630 --> 02:54:07,050
Troll.

2743
02:54:07,530 --> 02:54:08,770
Oh no, it's not the pot.

2744
02:54:08,970 --> 02:54:10,730
I'm a dummy dum-dum, sorry.

2745
02:54:10,970 --> 02:54:11,870
Hold on, I'll show you guys.

2746
02:54:13,190 --> 02:54:14,610
See, it says rod or troll.

2747
02:54:14,750 --> 02:54:17,030
Ok, so we gotta find the pale skate.

2748
02:54:21,410 --> 02:54:22,450
Or was it not?

2749
02:54:23,130 --> 02:54:23,450
Wait.

2750
02:54:29,660 --> 02:54:30,080
Yes?

2751
02:54:36,530 --> 02:54:38,970
Oh, spot a fish of each category.

2752
02:54:39,470 --> 02:54:40,330
Oh, neat.

2753
02:54:41,190 --> 02:54:42,730
Alright, well we found that guy.

2754
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:43,790
Alright, let's go over there.

2755
02:54:55,390 --> 02:54:56,310
Twisted shark.

2756
02:54:56,530 --> 02:54:57,530
Don't get it twisted.

2757
02:54:58,310 --> 02:54:59,470
Don't get it twisted.

2758
02:54:59,870 --> 02:55:00,290
Is it you?

2759
02:55:00,570 --> 02:55:01,410
Oh, it's you.

2760
02:55:03,850 --> 02:55:04,310
Ok.

2761
02:55:05,270 --> 02:55:06,930
Let's get another one, just in case.

2762
02:55:08,470 --> 02:55:10,410
Well, this wasn't so bad.

2763
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:14,090
I say before eating my words.

2764
02:55:20,060 --> 02:55:21,320
Get it twisted.

2765
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:29,200
You mean now you just need the ghost shark again?

2766
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:32,020
Yeah, we can get him right where we got him before.

2767
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,100
I'm so over the goop.

2768
02:55:43,460 --> 02:55:45,240
I'm so over the goop.

2769
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:49,160
It's like so...

2770
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:49,760
What the heck?

2771
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:50,600
You see that?

2772
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:50,900
Wait.

2773
02:55:57,780 --> 02:56:00,260
The goop is like so last stream.

2774
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:03,660
We're beyond the goopening.

2775
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:06,520
Uh-oh.

2776
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:12,320
Uh-oh.

2777
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:15,920
Surely more will respawn.

2778
02:56:16,820 --> 02:56:19,100
Let's just put this guy in for now.

2779
02:56:19,300 --> 02:56:21,020
Oh gosh, she sounds so close, you guys.

2780
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:23,380
Mama sounds so close.

2781
02:56:42,730 --> 02:56:43,590
Wait, hold on.

2782
02:56:44,270 --> 02:56:46,370
I use my handy dandy...

2783
02:56:46,370 --> 02:56:47,030
Wait, what the heck?

2784
02:56:47,230 --> 02:56:47,990
Oh, that's a thing?

2785
02:56:51,810 --> 02:56:53,190
It's kind of cool.

2786
02:56:54,050 --> 02:56:55,290
Is this the water temple?

2787
02:56:56,170 --> 02:56:57,030
Do you still have bait?

2788
02:56:57,350 --> 02:56:57,990
Oh, on me?

2789
02:56:59,090 --> 02:56:59,410
No.

2790
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:02,850
No, I don't.

2791
02:57:03,790 --> 02:57:06,390
It's okay, we can just wait for another...

2792
02:57:09,470 --> 02:57:09,950
Sawfish.

2793
02:57:12,790 --> 02:57:16,410
We can just wait for him to... for it to respawn.

2794
02:57:16,550 --> 02:57:17,130
It will.

2795
02:57:17,130 --> 02:57:17,170
It will.

2796
02:57:19,870 --> 02:57:21,990
Or maybe we caught one in our net.

2797
02:57:25,710 --> 02:57:27,930
Is eating volcanic fish raw?

2798
02:57:28,070 --> 02:57:29,950
Still sashimi or are they kind of pre-cooked?

2799
02:57:31,590 --> 02:57:33,070
That's a good question.

2800
02:57:36,410 --> 02:57:37,210
Oh my god.

2801
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:38,590
Hi mama.

2802
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:43,770
Is she coming after me?

2803
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:45,730
Oh, uh-oh.

2804
02:57:45,730 --> 02:57:47,510
Hey, get off of me.

2805
02:57:48,370 --> 02:57:49,610
Uh-oh, now she's coming after me.

2806
02:57:49,710 --> 02:57:52,870
She wasn't before, she sure is now.

2807
02:57:53,110 --> 02:57:55,210
Wait, go away you stupid kids.

2808
02:57:56,390 --> 02:57:58,530
Mom, control your children.

2809
02:58:00,090 --> 02:58:02,010
I need leashes or something.

2810
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:06,210
I gotta say, baby leashes are probably one of the greatest inventions ever.

2811
02:58:12,310 --> 02:58:13,930
Get off my line.

2812
02:58:15,550 --> 02:58:17,310
That's a child right there.

2813
02:58:21,970 --> 02:58:23,550
That's a hot take, really?

2814
02:58:23,870 --> 02:58:25,130
I don't think it should be.

2815
02:58:25,610 --> 02:58:29,210
I think they're like, so helpful.

2816
02:58:32,370 --> 02:58:33,290
But then what?

2817
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:35,530
Does the kid have a dignity?

2818
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:38,930
Is the kid like, oh no, I'm on a leash, I'm like a dog.

2819
02:58:39,710 --> 02:58:42,310
No, the kid doesn't care, it's a baby.

2820
02:58:42,310 --> 02:58:43,230
This is no.

2821
02:58:46,750 --> 02:58:48,530
Wow, 704 dollars.

2822
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:50,130
Let's go.

2823
02:58:52,890 --> 02:58:54,870
And I'm gonna buy some more.

2824
02:58:56,050 --> 02:58:56,570
C4.

2825
02:58:58,190 --> 02:59:02,470
And I'm gonna sleep and we're gonna hope that the guy respawns.

2826
02:59:02,910 --> 02:59:04,950
Actually, I'm gonna buy some bait too just in case.

2827
02:59:05,170 --> 02:59:05,530
Alright, sleep.

2828
02:59:07,990 --> 02:59:09,190
Those kids are the worst.

2829
02:59:09,190 --> 02:59:09,690
China!

2830
02:59:11,470 --> 02:59:12,270
I cared.

2831
02:59:12,350 --> 02:59:13,390
You don't remember.

2832
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:16,650
Don't lie.

2833
02:59:17,750 --> 02:59:19,050
You don't remember.

2834
02:59:21,130 --> 02:59:23,970
This guy is so cool.

2835
02:59:24,850 --> 02:59:26,630
Wait, he's so cute.

2836
02:59:33,890 --> 02:59:37,690
Oh my god, he's so cute.

2837
02:59:37,690 --> 02:59:41,090
I had a leash, apparently, loved it.

2838
02:59:42,030 --> 02:59:43,570
And I turned out.

2839
02:59:44,850 --> 02:59:46,150
You turned out alright.

2840
02:59:47,030 --> 02:59:48,290
You became something.

2841
02:59:48,630 --> 02:59:50,710
Thank you so much for the 20 gifts.

2842
02:59:52,290 --> 02:59:53,210
Thank you.

2843
02:59:59,130 --> 03:00:00,950
Yeah, you turned out.

2844
03:00:02,670 --> 03:00:04,190
Oh, I'm too close.

2845
03:00:05,550 --> 03:00:08,010
Why can't I just put my arms down?

2846
03:00:11,770 --> 03:00:11,910
No!

2847
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:25,650
One ghost shark please.

2848
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:35,720
Ok, I see her.

2849
03:00:36,980 --> 03:00:38,680
I'm not gonna, she does not bother me.

2850
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:41,160
I'm not gonna let her, she does not control my life.

2851
03:00:41,820 --> 03:00:43,540
This, this, this...

2852
03:00:43,540 --> 03:00:44,820
Oh god, she's so close.

2853
03:00:44,960 --> 03:00:46,120
Oh my god, she's so close.

2854
03:00:46,660 --> 03:00:49,120
The rock splits and we get this.

2855
03:00:55,940 --> 03:00:59,540
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

2856
03:00:59,600 --> 03:01:01,520
There's so much in here I wanna grab, but...

2857
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:03,500
Mommy scares me.

2858
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:06,900
Ok!

2859
03:01:10,020 --> 03:01:10,740
Now we...

2860
03:01:10,740 --> 03:01:12,620
Go back to our guy.

2861
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:17,720
Light the statues, what do you mean 0 out of 3?

2862
03:01:17,940 --> 03:01:20,300
Oh, I have to go take the wisps.

2863
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:23,140
I have to go take you guys.

2864
03:01:23,140 --> 03:01:25,220
It says the naked Murphy.

2865
03:01:25,540 --> 03:01:26,320
What do you mean naked?

2866
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,040
Why are we naked?

2867
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:29,580
The leash I got when I was a kid had a buckle.

2868
03:01:32,800 --> 03:01:34,380
It was bazazzle?

2869
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:38,020
I've never had a leash, but I also turned out...

2870
03:01:38,020 --> 03:01:40,680
But, it's not the leash's fault.

2871
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,440
Little wisp, wisp, wisp, wisp, wisp.

2872
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:49,860
Little wisp, wisp, wisp, wisp, wisp.

2873
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:52,680
What are you?

2874
03:01:54,700 --> 03:01:57,140
Oh, just a stinking snake mackerel.

2875
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:09,240
Oh my gosh, when I would go on a boat sometimes...

2876
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:12,620
That was my favorite thing is when it would go like...

2877
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:14,580
On the water.

2878
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:19,040
Ok!

2879
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:24,280
Let's go into my storage, grab you guys.

2880
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:29,080
Throw this in here, throw that in there, throw this in there.

2881
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:34,140
This guy is just chilling.

2882
03:02:35,560 --> 03:02:39,320
But, it looks like he's picking them up, like clogging them.

2883
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:41,160
Statues.

2884
03:02:42,640 --> 03:02:43,480
The left statue.

2885
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:48,520
A cold flame roars in the statue's hands.

2886
03:02:49,400 --> 03:02:50,360
Alright, middle statue.

2887
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:55,160
Right statue.

2888
03:02:57,160 --> 03:02:58,840
What's gonna happen?

2889
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,120
Preparations are complete.

2890
03:03:03,340 --> 03:03:04,280
The fanatic awaits.

2891
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:07,180
Hold on, let me go sell my crab.

2892
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:16,400
I love how as the fishermen we play like for no one team.

2893
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:20,380
We're just like, yeah, I'll do it for some scrap.

2894
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:24,960
Yeah, ok.

2895
03:03:31,150 --> 03:03:31,890
Oh my goodness.

2896
03:03:33,230 --> 03:03:34,110
Slowest, ok.

2897
03:03:35,050 --> 03:03:36,170
Holy cannoli!

2898
03:03:38,330 --> 03:03:41,950
We're making such, sorry I always do this, we're making tons of money.

2899
03:03:42,950 --> 03:03:43,510
Nice.

2900
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:46,330
Oh my gosh, we're almost at five thousand dollars.

2901
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:53,100
Cash money, baby.

2902
03:03:54,680 --> 03:03:55,600
Do it for some scrap.

2903
03:03:57,860 --> 03:04:00,680
This area sucks, it's so foggy you can't see anything.

2904
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:04,200
It's so foggy and red, my eyes.

2905
03:04:07,740 --> 03:04:08,940
The scientist quest?

2906
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,260
Wait, is this gonna end the game?

2907
03:04:15,580 --> 03:04:17,100
Does this end the game?

2908
03:04:26,230 --> 03:04:26,750
Not yet?

2909
03:04:26,810 --> 03:04:26,950
No?

2910
03:04:27,050 --> 03:04:27,810
Ok, then we're fine.

2911
03:04:29,030 --> 03:04:29,730
What is it?

2912
03:04:30,250 --> 03:04:31,550
Wow, ok, hello?

2913
03:04:32,670 --> 03:04:33,730
The flames are lit.

2914
03:04:33,730 --> 03:04:35,470
I can feel it.

2915
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:37,530
The chill of the deep torches us now.

2916
03:04:37,670 --> 03:04:38,850
It is time.

2917
03:04:39,270 --> 03:04:39,510
Come.

2918
03:04:40,190 --> 03:04:41,810
We follow him up the steps of the temple.

2919
03:04:42,230 --> 03:04:43,930
At the top is a black stone altar.

2920
03:04:44,470 --> 03:04:47,250
Stacked high above the altar are layers of dark, damp wood.

2921
03:04:48,110 --> 03:04:49,490
Been a long, unfun day.

2922
03:04:49,650 --> 03:04:49,830
No!

2923
03:04:51,550 --> 03:04:54,410
Serenus, I hope it gets better.

2924
03:04:56,650 --> 03:04:59,750
He draws the antique pocket watch from his robe.

2925
03:05:00,290 --> 03:05:03,530
It sways hypnotically in the breeze.

2926
03:05:04,610 --> 03:05:06,110
Is he gonna hypnotize me?

2927
03:05:06,530 --> 03:05:07,130
Sexy.

2928
03:05:07,830 --> 03:05:09,330
It is almost yours.

2929
03:05:09,730 --> 03:05:11,430
May it mark the start of your journey.

2930
03:05:12,110 --> 03:05:12,950
And the end.

2931
03:05:13,770 --> 03:05:18,770
Still holding the pocket watch, in one hand he clambers atop the pyre and raises his skull.

2932
03:05:19,030 --> 03:05:20,530
Not skull, sorry.

2933
03:05:26,110 --> 03:05:27,310
His scroll.

2934
03:05:31,170 --> 03:05:32,910
Oh no, he just like...

2935
03:05:35,570 --> 03:05:38,690
He just rips his head off.

2936
03:05:39,570 --> 03:05:41,030
His skull metal.

2937
03:05:43,030 --> 03:05:44,430
He begins to chant.

2938
03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:45,870
What are you doing?

2939
03:05:46,350 --> 03:05:47,190
He ignores you.

2940
03:05:47,390 --> 03:05:48,470
I had a feeling that would happen.

2941
03:05:48,470 --> 03:05:49,910
The wind picks up.

2942
03:05:50,410 --> 03:05:52,310
Swirling sea spray around the altar.

2943
03:05:52,810 --> 03:05:55,930
A cold blue flame rises from the sodden wood at his feet.

2944
03:05:56,590 --> 03:05:57,450
Stop this?

2945
03:05:57,830 --> 03:05:58,830
Says nothing.

2946
03:05:59,770 --> 03:06:02,430
The freezing blaze climbs his legs.

2947
03:06:03,150 --> 03:06:06,110
His chanting continues, no pain detectable in his voice.

2948
03:06:06,950 --> 03:06:08,050
Oh wait, he's on fire?

2949
03:06:08,430 --> 03:06:09,410
Oh no!

2950
03:06:10,390 --> 03:06:12,490
He lifts his arms skyward.

2951
03:06:12,830 --> 03:06:14,830
Seconds later, the inferno engulfs him.

2952
03:06:15,930 --> 03:06:16,530
Oops!

2953
03:06:17,510 --> 03:06:20,130
It rages for a moment, then abruptly dies away.

2954
03:06:20,490 --> 03:06:25,690
A cold mist pools around the floor of the temple, briefly before the wind sweeps it into the sea.

2955
03:06:26,930 --> 03:06:29,490
No trace of the fanatic remains.

2956
03:06:30,010 --> 03:06:30,590
Oh no!

2957
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:33,410
The pyre is cold and damp.

2958
03:06:33,770 --> 03:06:36,830
We're going to expect it and we get our pocket watch!

2959
03:06:36,830 --> 03:06:38,870
We take the pocket watch.

2960
03:06:39,230 --> 03:06:40,270
It's freezing cold.

2961
03:06:40,770 --> 03:06:42,030
It vibrates in your palm.

2962
03:06:42,650 --> 03:06:45,370
Clock hands spinning wildly below the cracked face.

2963
03:06:48,130 --> 03:06:49,750
So he burned himself?

2964
03:06:50,650 --> 03:06:51,410
I guess so.

2965
03:06:55,650 --> 03:06:57,190
Freaky little guy.

2966
03:06:58,890 --> 03:07:00,850
Is that the last relic?

2967
03:07:01,430 --> 03:07:01,990
Yes.

2968
03:07:02,990 --> 03:07:05,570
It is the last relic.

2969
03:07:06,350 --> 03:07:07,490
Let's see.

2970
03:07:08,810 --> 03:07:15,990
I might actually call it here guys and have the last part of...

2971
03:07:17,010 --> 03:07:21,750
Because I still want to do the aberrated ice fish.

2972
03:07:22,530 --> 03:07:24,710
No, sorry.

2973
03:07:25,030 --> 03:07:26,770
The devil's spine fish.

2974
03:07:27,450 --> 03:07:31,870
Well, I feel like maybe we can do these.

2975
03:07:32,650 --> 03:07:37,170
Oh, I need the different version of the... Hold on.

2976
03:07:38,590 --> 03:07:40,030
Maybe I can keep going a little bit more.

2977
03:07:41,630 --> 03:07:42,110
Let's see.

2978
03:07:42,170 --> 03:07:42,450
Hold on.

2979
03:07:43,490 --> 03:07:44,050
Hold on.

2980
03:07:46,890 --> 03:07:51,690
I do have some stuff I gotta do tonight, which is why I had a bit of an earlier stream today.

2981
03:07:54,170 --> 03:08:02,930
One thing that kind of sucks about having meetings with Japanese companies is you have to have meetings with them on Japanese time.

2982
03:08:12,940 --> 03:08:16,820
Let's go see what we need for the other...

2983
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:18,700
What's the word?

2984
03:08:20,140 --> 03:08:21,520
The other rod.

2985
03:08:23,820 --> 03:08:25,580
The things you do go well.

2986
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,400
Thank you!

2987
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:30,280
I'm trying to plan lots of cool stuff.

2988
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:35,020
Do you have 3AM meetings?

2989
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:35,940
Not today.

2990
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:42,820
Actually, I've never had a 3AM meeting luckily, but today's meeting is at 1AM for me, so...

2991
03:08:45,240 --> 03:08:46,500
It's a factory, right?

2992
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:52,740
This infused fireproof... Wait a second.

2993
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:56,460
I needed this anyway.

2994
03:08:57,340 --> 03:08:58,240
Oh, I sold it.

2995
03:09:38,370 --> 03:09:41,690
Anyway, then we'll end it here, because I gotta get some more goop.

2996
03:09:41,710 --> 03:09:42,770
I gotta get this.

2997
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:49,050
There's a little more things I wanna do before we end off, so... Next time!

2998
03:09:50,210 --> 03:09:52,750
We get the samples for this...

2999
03:09:53,470 --> 03:09:57,190
We get the samples for this guy, I cannot think with this stinking music.

3000
03:09:59,130 --> 03:09:59,650
And...

3001
03:10:00,790 --> 03:10:03,370
It might be a bit of a shorter one, maybe.

3002
03:10:06,650 --> 03:10:09,770
I don't know, maybe... Should I just...

3003
03:10:11,070 --> 03:10:14,370
After I give the final trinket, is there way more?

3004
03:10:14,770 --> 03:10:15,430
Hot dog!

3005
03:10:15,610 --> 03:10:16,150
Thank you!

3006
03:10:28,420 --> 03:10:30,020
Wait, 30 minutes more?

3007
03:10:30,100 --> 03:10:31,760
Wait, people are saying you're really close.

3008
03:10:37,580 --> 03:10:38,700
Hold on.

3009
03:10:58,870 --> 03:11:01,350
You'll need to do a bit for the second ending.

3010
03:11:03,710 --> 03:11:07,070
I guess then we can do the first ending and the second ending...

3011
03:11:09,770 --> 03:11:10,790
Next time then?

3012
03:11:12,510 --> 03:11:12,950
Maybe?

3013
03:11:16,250 --> 03:11:17,410
What do I keep hearing?

3014
03:11:17,530 --> 03:11:18,690
I guess it's the game.

3015
03:11:21,990 --> 03:11:23,550
It's pretty short after this trinket.

3016
03:11:24,750 --> 03:11:28,210
And then if I have the second... I maybe have 30 minutes left?

3017
03:11:28,230 --> 03:11:28,510
Really?

3018
03:11:31,310 --> 03:11:31,950
What do?

3019
03:11:32,090 --> 03:11:32,450
What do?

3020
03:11:32,810 --> 03:11:35,590
I'm not like, attempting to 100% the game.

3021
03:11:35,710 --> 03:11:38,290
I think maybe I'm just feeling a little tired for today.

3022
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:42,130
So I'm kind of like, not as into it as I have been in the past.

3023
03:11:42,350 --> 03:11:43,530
Maybe I'm over dredged.

3024
03:11:43,610 --> 03:11:44,050
Oh no!

3025
03:11:49,340 --> 03:11:51,940
I mean, this is part 5, so...

3026
03:11:54,940 --> 03:11:55,660
What should we do?

3027
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:56,540
Should we finish up?

3028
03:12:00,010 --> 03:12:02,070
We can do everything next stream.

3029
03:12:04,990 --> 03:12:06,730
Okay, we'll just do it next stream.

3030
03:12:06,810 --> 03:12:08,290
Maybe I could do like a...

3031
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:10,290
What do I keep hearing?

3032
03:12:10,430 --> 03:12:11,270
It must be in the game.

3033
03:12:12,750 --> 03:12:13,790
It sounds like a cat.

3034
03:12:13,990 --> 03:12:15,010
I'm getting out of here.

3035
03:12:15,470 --> 03:12:15,810
I'm a dog.

3036
03:12:20,110 --> 03:12:22,290
I guess then...

3037
03:12:24,150 --> 03:12:26,890
Starting my mandatory military service tomorrow!

3038
03:12:27,650 --> 03:12:30,010
So no more minky stream for the next month.

3039
03:12:30,290 --> 03:12:31,190
Master Paladin!

3040
03:12:32,490 --> 03:12:33,270
Fooled me.

3041
03:12:33,630 --> 03:12:34,870
Good luck!

3042
03:12:35,090 --> 03:12:35,790
Good luck!

3043
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:42,120
Friendship ended with dredge.

3044
03:12:42,200 --> 03:12:43,500
Blue Prince is my new best friend.

3045
03:12:43,620 --> 03:12:45,080
I feel like that.

3046
03:12:47,140 --> 03:12:49,300
I do feel like that a little bit.

3047
03:12:54,160 --> 03:12:54,560
Okay.

3048
03:12:55,780 --> 03:12:58,120
Maybe I could do like another afternoon stream.

3049
03:12:58,620 --> 03:13:02,420
And it can be kind of small and then I can do a longer stream that night, next week.

3050
03:13:03,940 --> 03:13:05,400
I think that will work.

3051
03:13:07,400 --> 03:13:08,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3052
03:13:09,020 --> 03:13:10,120
I think that could work.

3053
03:13:16,060 --> 03:13:18,960
If you want to end the story, deliver the pocket watch.

3054
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:21,260
You can get the rest of the fish and members if you want to.

3055
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:22,560
That's true.

3056
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:23,540
I don't know.

3057
03:13:23,620 --> 03:13:24,960
Should we just finish the story then?

3058
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:27,080
I can't tell what I want to do!

3059
03:13:28,340 --> 03:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

3060
03:13:29,100 --> 03:13:30,140
I'm so indecisive.

3061
03:13:37,550 --> 03:13:38,430
Finish it?

3062
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:52,500
Let's finish this.

3063
03:13:56,420 --> 03:13:58,020
Finish it for Master Paladin.

3064
03:13:58,100 --> 03:13:58,980
You're so right!

3065
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:00,860
You won't be able to see the story.

3066
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:03,620
Deliver the relic.

3067
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:06,940
He approaches, drawing closer with an incessant ticking.

3068
03:14:07,420 --> 03:14:08,700
You have the pocket watch.

3069
03:14:09,340 --> 03:14:10,320
You take out the watch.

3070
03:14:11,060 --> 03:14:17,780
Its once frozen hands are now inexplicably twitching in a rhythmic struggle.

3071
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:20,100
Trying but failing to move forward.

3072
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:22,140
You place it in front of the collector.

3073
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:24,480
Flip a coin.

3074
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:25,840
Heads to finish it.

3075
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:26,700
Heads!

3076
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:34,260
Though it has been some decades since I last laid eyes upon this, the sound of its mechanisms has grown no less unpleasant.

3077
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:37,860
And with that, our collection is complete.

3078
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:39,660
I must admit, I am surprised.

3079
03:14:40,100 --> 03:14:42,720
I did not think you had the determination for such a job.

3080
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:45,260
Where's your motivation?

3081
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:51,300
Now, with these five relics in our possession, only one thing remains.

3082
03:14:52,100 --> 03:14:54,080
I suspect you know that by now.

3083
03:14:54,880 --> 03:14:55,600
Know what?

3084
03:14:57,100 --> 03:14:58,660
It will become apparent soon enough.

3085
03:14:58,740 --> 03:14:59,900
I don't know anything, mister.

3086
03:15:00,480 --> 03:15:02,000
We must take one final voyage.

3087
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:04,180
This time, I will be with you.

3088
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:05,400
I'm ready.

3089
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,580
Warning, you are entering the final phase of the game.

3090
03:15:09,280 --> 03:15:11,860
Your progress will not be saved from this point onwards.

3091
03:15:12,600 --> 03:15:13,700
You wish to continue?

3092
03:15:14,620 --> 03:15:15,000
Yes.

3093
03:15:16,100 --> 03:15:17,160
Warning, one more time.

3094
03:15:17,220 --> 03:15:19,260
Your progress will not be saved from this point onwards.

3095
03:15:20,040 --> 03:15:22,720
Okay, so that means if I want to finish anything else, I can.

3096
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:26,760
The relics are coming with us.

3097
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:29,100
We should wait for the fog to thicken.

3098
03:15:29,620 --> 03:15:32,480
With luck, the seas will remain unaware of our intentions.

3099
03:15:33,100 --> 03:15:34,380
Yeah, you can come back.

3100
03:15:34,480 --> 03:15:36,000
Waiting for the right time.

3101
03:15:42,540 --> 03:15:47,840
Now, our destination is the open expanse to the west of Great Morrow.

3102
03:15:48,140 --> 03:15:49,180
It's marked on the map.

3103
03:15:49,740 --> 03:15:52,160
We must not tarry on the open waters.

3104
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:54,140
Not with such a significant cargo.

3105
03:15:54,680 --> 03:15:55,560
Make haste!

3106
03:15:57,840 --> 03:15:59,480
So no open waters?

3107
03:15:59,580 --> 03:16:00,140
Got it.

3108
03:16:00,440 --> 03:16:01,180
Wait, where is he?

3109
03:16:01,220 --> 03:16:02,180
He's not on my ship.

3110
03:16:04,940 --> 03:16:05,540
Here.

3111
03:16:07,080 --> 03:16:08,180
Greater Morrow.

3112
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:13,040
Please sir, I'm nothing but a simple fisher ghost.

3113
03:16:15,900 --> 03:16:17,100
Okay, uh...

3114
03:16:17,100 --> 03:16:17,500
Eco?

3115
03:16:17,500 --> 03:16:17,540
Eco?

3116
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:28,100
What do you mean we shouldn't go on the open waters?

3117
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:29,620
What's the issue?

3118
03:16:32,140 --> 03:16:33,220
Oh, my bad.

3119
03:16:36,100 --> 03:16:37,140
Is something gonna come get me?

3120
03:16:38,960 --> 03:16:40,340
I dare you to try.

3121
03:16:45,990 --> 03:16:48,370
I like the way the...

3122
03:16:49,930 --> 03:16:52,970
I like the way the cracks in the ocean look.

3123
03:16:52,970 --> 03:16:54,510
They're so neat.

3124
03:16:57,150 --> 03:16:58,250
Almost there!

3125
03:17:02,370 --> 03:17:04,070
This is the place.

3126
03:17:05,750 --> 03:17:10,490
This is where she was taken from us, and where we can at last bring her back.

3127
03:17:11,370 --> 03:17:14,390
Only here, and only because of what we've achieved.

3128
03:17:15,210 --> 03:17:17,130
He opens the book and begins to read aloud.

3129
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:20,390
To release a lost one frozen in time.

3130
03:17:21,150 --> 03:17:23,010
He throws the pocket watch overboard.

3131
03:17:23,850 --> 03:17:26,350
And tethered by chains in the deep.

3132
03:17:26,990 --> 03:17:29,050
He throws the necklace overboard.

3133
03:17:30,230 --> 03:17:32,710
Bind them to this world once more.

3134
03:17:33,250 --> 03:17:35,390
He throws the ring overboard.

3135
03:17:36,230 --> 03:17:38,650
Open the door to the starry heavens.

3136
03:17:39,510 --> 03:17:42,150
He slots the key into the lock of the music box.

3137
03:17:42,210 --> 03:17:45,070
Is this guy just like trying to bring back his girlfriend or something?

3138
03:17:45,070 --> 03:17:49,010
Is all this meant for some guy who's simping for a lady friend?

3139
03:17:50,230 --> 03:17:52,630
And lay the weary world to rest.

3140
03:17:53,490 --> 03:17:55,170
He throws the music box overboard.

3141
03:17:55,330 --> 03:17:57,070
Its key left unturned.

3142
03:18:00,470 --> 03:18:02,990
The achievement was find a use for the relics.

3143
03:18:12,650 --> 03:18:14,370
Reread the notes chronologically.

3144
03:18:16,390 --> 03:18:17,330
No way.

3145
03:18:18,410 --> 03:18:19,210
Oh

3146
03:18:34,110 --> 03:18:35,130
my god.

3147
03:18:42,150 --> 03:18:45,110
Our lady friend comes with a little extra.

3148
03:18:47,790 --> 03:18:49,630
Two for one deal baby.

3149
03:18:50,730 --> 03:18:51,910
That's it.

3150
03:18:56,520 --> 03:18:57,800
Oh, oh no.

3151
03:18:58,200 --> 03:18:58,540
Oopsie.

3152
03:19:00,780 --> 03:19:01,340
Oops.

3153
03:19:02,720 --> 03:19:03,120
Oops.

3154
03:19:05,300 --> 03:19:05,560
Oops.

3155
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:07,960
The good ending.

3156
03:19:11,980 --> 03:19:12,620
Oops.

3157
03:19:14,320 --> 03:19:15,780
Hear me out.

3158
03:19:17,900 --> 03:19:19,760
Who wouldn't do this for a Kamiyoshi?

3159
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:20,380
Don't be real.

3160
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:24,720
Oops.

3161
03:19:31,050 --> 03:19:33,370
She came back with bigger asset.

3162
03:19:34,930 --> 03:19:36,450
The ultimate super chat.

3163
03:19:39,250 --> 03:19:39,970
Wow.

3164
03:19:43,120 --> 03:19:44,300
Big oopsie.

3165
03:19:44,900 --> 03:19:45,940
The music is so awesome.

3166
03:19:49,680 --> 03:19:50,540
So epic.

3167
03:20:53,720 --> 03:20:55,360
Sorry, I didn't mean to block the credits.

3168
03:21:10,490 --> 03:21:12,030
The true ancient one.

3169
03:21:12,530 --> 03:21:13,350
Wait a second.

3170
03:21:14,290 --> 03:21:15,090
What do you mean by that?

3171
03:21:17,170 --> 03:21:18,110
What do you mean by that?

3172
03:21:22,860 --> 03:21:24,200
This Kaiju is kind of cute.

3173
03:21:24,320 --> 03:21:25,120
It has a cool hat.

3174
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:30,100
God, this music is so good.

3175
03:21:32,200 --> 03:21:33,560
Not old, ancient.

3176
03:21:37,980 --> 03:21:40,080
Would it be better if I looked like this instead?

3177
03:21:59,440 --> 03:21:59,920
Yeah.

3178
03:21:59,920 --> 03:22:00,080
Yeah.

3179
03:22:04,100 --> 03:22:07,960
Wait, hold on.

3180
03:22:08,040 --> 03:22:09,080
Let me fix my chat.

3181
03:22:10,640 --> 03:22:11,420
There we go.

3182
03:22:13,360 --> 03:22:14,660
Ancient and dimensional.

3183
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:19,040
Nice.

3184
03:22:22,820 --> 03:22:25,660
The credits have gone on for so long the soundtrack ended.

3185
03:22:32,180 --> 03:22:34,040
I didn't know this was Team17.

3186
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:40,120
Not the Latin singing of fighter jet boss is about to turn face combat style.

3187
03:22:46,130 --> 03:22:48,210
You hear like the crackling.

3188
03:22:52,430 --> 03:22:54,310
I wonder what happened with the lady at the lighthouse.

3189
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:57,730
So what happens to us?

3190
03:23:05,370 --> 03:23:08,130
There is no special after credits scene.

3191
03:23:08,250 --> 03:23:08,690
Oh, really?

3192
03:23:09,850 --> 03:23:11,950
Wait, I just heard another boat go...

3193
03:23:13,830 --> 03:23:16,310
We get a CGF as well.

3194
03:23:18,690 --> 03:23:22,010
This whole thing was basically just like a blind date.

3195
03:23:22,530 --> 03:23:27,370
So he got his girl back and he's like, by the way, she has a really great friend.

3196
03:23:27,990 --> 03:23:31,430
And she's so... she's a great person.

3197
03:23:32,070 --> 03:23:32,670
Creature.

3198
03:23:32,670 --> 03:23:33,890
Great thing.

3199
03:23:34,150 --> 03:23:34,870
She's great.

3200
03:23:35,850 --> 03:23:39,230
And it would just mean the world to us if you met her.

3201
03:23:39,330 --> 03:23:40,510
Just give her a chance.

3202
03:23:42,070 --> 03:23:44,290
She has a great personality.

3203
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:56,320
Find the old mare for the alternative ending.

3204
03:23:57,240 --> 03:24:00,820
There are honestly so much that I did not do.

3205
03:24:01,440 --> 03:24:05,660
Like I didn't... there was like those frozen guys that asked for fish.

3206
03:24:05,800 --> 03:24:06,880
I didn't do those.

3207
03:24:07,620 --> 03:24:13,920
Obviously, I didn't finish the iron rig thing, but I don't think that would be a new ending.

3208
03:24:15,020 --> 03:24:17,020
The mito that sold the world!

3209
03:24:21,320 --> 03:24:23,180
There's so much more also to explore here.

3210
03:24:23,200 --> 03:24:24,040
I'm just going to skip the rest.

3211
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:27,040
Just because you said there was no other ending, right?

3212
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:31,480
So...

3213
03:24:32,080 --> 03:24:34,060
There are no DLC endings, I think.

3214
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:35,440
Best ending.

3215
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:40,080
This ending changes a little if you do the thing to unlock the other ending.

3216
03:24:40,520 --> 03:24:41,320
Ah, cool!

3217
03:24:42,280 --> 03:24:44,840
Canonically the greatest wingman of the seven seas.

3218
03:24:46,680 --> 03:24:48,680
Yeah, there was the treasure map too!

3219
03:24:49,280 --> 03:24:52,120
I was thinking about that earlier because I saw it in our storage.

3220
03:24:52,220 --> 03:24:53,640
I was like, oh my gosh, the treasure map.

3221
03:24:54,660 --> 03:24:56,780
But yeah, there's still so much.

3222
03:25:06,520 --> 03:25:10,460
Maybe if I want to do anymore, I'll touch it in member streams.

3223
03:25:11,620 --> 03:25:15,680
But overall, I think that this was a good conclusion we got.

3224
03:25:17,400 --> 03:25:20,880
Would you consider this the main ending of Dredge?

3225
03:25:25,050 --> 03:25:27,730
The collector just chilled in his place the whole time.

3226
03:25:27,790 --> 03:25:28,090
I know!

3227
03:25:29,030 --> 03:25:31,450
We did all the work, but we did get the bigger girl.

3228
03:25:32,730 --> 03:25:33,950
Oh, it's the bad end.

3229
03:25:37,190 --> 03:25:38,150
That's subjective.

3230
03:25:41,470 --> 03:25:44,410
There's a good and bad ending, but both are bad endings really.

3231
03:25:45,050 --> 03:25:45,470
I see.

3232
03:25:45,470 --> 03:25:50,510
Well, this is like a very...

3233
03:25:50,510 --> 03:25:52,630
Oh, what's the guy?

3234
03:25:53,370 --> 03:25:55,770
Lovecraftian kind of game.

3235
03:25:56,010 --> 03:25:59,990
And those stories tend to not have the best of endings.

3236
03:26:05,350 --> 03:26:07,510
The other ending is very worth doing.

3237
03:26:07,790 --> 03:26:07,990
Cool!

3238
03:26:08,730 --> 03:26:09,590
When you remember!

3239
03:26:10,470 --> 03:26:11,470
Good old Tino!

3240
03:26:11,870 --> 03:26:12,470
Thank you!

3241
03:26:12,470 --> 03:26:14,430
Really loved all the Dredge streams.

3242
03:26:14,530 --> 03:26:16,110
Have a nice meal and good luck with the meeting.

3243
03:26:16,290 --> 03:26:17,070
Thank you, Marilyn!

3244
03:26:18,490 --> 03:26:19,470
Me and Toecraftian.

3245
03:26:20,770 --> 03:26:22,970
We got a GF, that's a good ending.

3246
03:26:23,510 --> 03:26:23,990
Yippee!

3247
03:26:24,990 --> 03:26:25,450
Lady!

3248
03:26:27,770 --> 03:26:33,130
Any ending involving a lady seems like a win to me.

3249
03:26:35,390 --> 03:26:40,530
But yeah, if you wanted to see the other ending, I will probably be doing that in member streams.

3250
03:26:42,770 --> 03:26:43,250
And...

3251
03:26:46,010 --> 03:26:46,490
And...

3252
03:26:47,150 --> 03:26:47,630
Yeah!

3253
03:26:48,050 --> 03:26:50,310
Thanks for Dredging with me guys!

3254
03:26:50,430 --> 03:26:52,170
This is so fun!

3255
03:26:57,110 --> 03:26:59,510
I hope you guys have a good day.

3256
03:26:59,690 --> 03:27:01,310
I hope you have a good night.

3257
03:27:01,730 --> 03:27:05,490
I hope you have a good rest of whatever time it is for you.

3258
03:27:05,590 --> 03:27:07,870
Thank you for the gifted membership!

3259
03:27:08,350 --> 03:27:08,650
Thank you!

3260
03:27:08,650 --> 03:27:10,330
Thank you for the pig!

3261
03:27:11,010 --> 03:27:12,910
I like this ending because...

3262
03:27:13,590 --> 03:27:17,230
Because you get to see Cthulhu coming out of the ocean.

3263
03:27:18,150 --> 03:27:18,950
Good luck with your meetings.

3264
03:27:19,070 --> 03:27:19,690
Thank you!

3265
03:27:19,910 --> 03:27:22,870
Thank you guys!

3266
03:27:24,010 --> 03:27:25,110
Thanks for Dredging with me.

3267
03:27:25,190 --> 03:27:25,730
Thank you!

3268
03:27:25,990 --> 03:27:27,650
This is a great journey all things considered.

3269
03:27:27,810 --> 03:27:28,630
Enjoy the ravioli.

3270
03:27:29,110 --> 03:27:30,210
Thank you!

3271
03:27:32,330 --> 03:27:33,230
See you later!

3272
03:27:34,090 --> 03:27:35,910
See you later!

3273
03:27:36,070 --> 03:27:36,690
Thank you everyone!

3274
03:27:36,950 --> 03:27:38,090
Bye bye!
