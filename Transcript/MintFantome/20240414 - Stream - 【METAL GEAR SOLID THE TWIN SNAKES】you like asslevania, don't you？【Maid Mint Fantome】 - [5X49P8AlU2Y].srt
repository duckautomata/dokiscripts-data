1
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,820
Can you hear it okay?

2
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,610
That part sounds a little quiet, you know what I mean?

3
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,300
Yeah?

4
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,740
No?

5
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,700
Stop it.

6
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,040
No audio?

7
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,660
Stop!

8
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,680
I know you're lying!

9
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,840
What do you mean no sound?

10
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Actually?

11
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,840
Wait, what?

12
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,600
Oh, you can't hear the game?

13
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,200
Wait, actually?

14
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,500
Now you can.

15
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,140
Really?

16
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,160
The game is actually silent.

17
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,620
So I'm just laughing to myself?

18
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:31,940
Quietly?

19
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,880
Huh.

20
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,760
Oh!

21
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,500
I see why.

22
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,260
I see why.

23
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,680
I see why.

24
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,940
I see why.

25
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,400
I see why.

26
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,800
I see why.

27
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,340
Okay, hold on.

28
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,100
Restart!

29
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,480
Redo!

30
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:49,900
Redo!

31
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,220
Redo!

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Redo!

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,840
Redo!

34
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,730
Redo!

35
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:19,890
Redo!

36
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,450
Redo!

37
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,290
Welcome

38
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
back!

39
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,200
Master!

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,580
Lady!

41
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,940
Lady!

42
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Say a mint?

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,840
Say the line?

44
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,100
Say the line, boss!

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,460
For old time's sake.

46
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,300
Kept you waiting, huh?

47
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,500
Oh my gosh!

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,780
Oh my gosh, you guys.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,400
Welcome.

50
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,060
Welcome, welcome, welcome to...

51
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,980
The Twin Snakes, baby!

52
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,760
I was gonna say the most controversial...

53
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,120
Metal Gear game, but actually I don't think so.

54
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,580
I don't think it's the most controversial one.

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,880
But you know, it is one that...

56
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,700
I think a lot of people are...

57
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,140
I don't know, I think more nowadays it's more like...

58
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,900
What's the word?

59
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,060
It's more...

60
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,260
Beloved by people than it used to be.

61
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,640
I think nowadays more people are like...

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,840
Yeah, this game kind of owns.

63
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,280
Because of how crazy it gets.

64
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,480
You know?

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,540
I think...

66
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,800
So, for those unaware...

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,360
This is a...

68
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,340
Quote unquote...

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,840
Remake of Metal Gear Solid.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,980
First game.

71
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,360
Thank you guys for the silver chance!

72
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,920
Thank you!

73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,000
Gaseous steak.

74
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,460
I have a confession to make.

75
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,420
I've never played Twin Snakes.

76
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm a fake fan.

77
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,140
So I'm looking forward to this.

78
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,660
Awesome!

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Me too!

80
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,560
It's my first time actually playing it.

81
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
I have seen some of the cutscenes.

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,420
But not all of them.

83
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:25,860
So...

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,180
Very much looking forward to playing it.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,140
For realsies now.

86
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,640
But it is a...

87
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Remake of Metal Gear Solid 1.

88
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,980
So the first game.

89
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,040
But it is made in the Metal Gear Solid 2 engine.

90
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
And so it's gonna look like...

91
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,160
All kind of fancy and new.

92
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,060
And...

93
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,020
And...

94
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,780
And it's...

95
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,500
It's different.

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,480
It is.

97
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,040
It's...

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,120
It's different.

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,800
It's different.

100
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,160
Alright.

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,500
Thank you guys for the silver chance!

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,940
Thank you!

103
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,420
Glad you're playing this.

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,840
I actually got into VTubers because of this game.

105
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,860
The VTuber had a sultry voice like Sniper Wolf.

106
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,660
But was replaced by a nerdy energetic lady like EE.

107
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,160
What?

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,240
What do you...

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,780
They were...

110
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,740
What do you mean they were replaced?

111
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,140
The best explanation I've seen is that MGS1 is what really happened.

112
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,560
While Twin Snakes is what Snake tells people happened.

113
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,560
You'll understand.

114
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,540
No, no, no.

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,820
That's not my favorite theory.

116
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,380
My favorite theory...

117
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,700
Is that...

118
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,420
Metal Gear Solid...

119
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,200
Okay, so there's several theories, right?

120
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,600
First theory...

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,920
Is what you just said.

122
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,360
That Snake is retelling the story.

123
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,140
The second theory...

124
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,020
Is that this is Raiden's VR missions that he went through.

125
00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:02,140
Because, you know, in Metal Gear Solid 2 you learn that he went through VR missions of Shadow Moses to kind of learn how to be like Solid Snake.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
The third...

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,920
The third theory and my favorite...

128
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,980
And my favorite...

129
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,680
Is that this is Otacon's retelling.

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,540
Of Shadow Moses.

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,240
And that makes the most sense to me.

132
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,580
I think this...

133
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,580
I think this is Otacon being like...

134
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,180
Oh my gosh.

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,060
And then Snake...

136
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,980
He like...

137
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,780
Jumped off the missiles and blew up the Hindy.

138
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,720
It makes entirely...

139
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,320
More sense if you think of it as Otacon being like...

140
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,300
It's literally just like my Japanese anime.

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,540
Because he thinks Snake is like a superhero.

142
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,020
It's so great.

143
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,100
Otacon left off in the...

144
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,740
Left in the part where he peed.

145
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,560
What's under special?

146
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,260
Oh, I do also want to say...

147
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,680
This is my first time ever playing on a Gamecube.

148
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,740
I did have a friend when I was a...

149
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,600
When I was a...

150
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,520
A little...

151
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,500
A little ghost.

152
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,780
Who...

153
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,720
Had a Gamecube.

154
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,880
And didn't let me play.

155
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,400
That kid was a jerk.

156
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,640
Um...

157
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,520
I still hold it against him.

158
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,260
I would...

159
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,540
I would sit there like...

160
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,000
Because he was one of my few friends that was in my neighborhood.

161
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,620
And so...

162
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,420
Um...

163
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,520
I would go to his house.

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,060
And he would sit and play Animal Crossing.

165
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,560
And I would just watch.

166
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,840
For...

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,960
For a long time.

168
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,880
He was always...

169
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,500
Just playing by himself.

170
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,520
Ugh.

171
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,940
Yeah.

172
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,920
Friend in quotes.

173
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,300
Yeah.

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Friend in quotes.

175
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,380
But I also just didn't have one growing up.

176
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,840
So...

177
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,660
Um...

178
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,480
And then I...

179
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,880
I don't know.

180
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,600
I just never had an opportunity to play one.

181
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,080
So...

182
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,560
The controller...

183
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,000
The controls are very new to me.

184
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,020
Extremely...

185
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,040
As of...

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,580
As of...

187
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,080
As of like 30 minutes ago.

188
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,360
And I bought this Gamecube just to play the Twin Snakes.

189
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,400
Um...

190
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,440
But because I have it now, we can play more Gamecube games.

191
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:04,920
Yippee!

192
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,200
But I bought it literally only for this game.

193
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,840
So...

194
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,120
Um...

195
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,060
Yup.

196
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,080
Yup.

197
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,880
Yup.

198
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,700
Um...

199
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,120
So...

200
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,540
Yeah.

201
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,600
Um...

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
What else?

203
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,320
Uh...

204
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah.

205
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,100
So let's...

206
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,040
What is under special?

207
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm curious.

208
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,500
Um...

209
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,080
Oh my gosh!

210
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,260
Wait!

211
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,200
There's dog tags!

212
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,360
In this?

213
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,140
Just like in Metal Gear Solid 2?

214
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,600
The briefings are in full 3D?

215
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:34,960
Oh yes!

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,160
Yes!

217
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,340
Yes!

218
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,600
We will be watching the briefings.

219
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:36,960
Don't worry.

220
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,820
Because there's one part that I really love.

221
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,760
That Snake does.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,260
There's photo album too.

223
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,960
I don't know what this is.

224
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,740
It looks like a gun.

225
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,020
Previous operations.

226
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
Oh my gosh!

227
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,360
Otacon's pee!

228
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,660
Okay.

229
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,460
Let's do the briefings.

230
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,260
I think they're quite long.

231
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,740
Like the original briefings, right?

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,100
I'm not sure to be honest.

233
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,720
So...

234
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,940
It's been a long time, Snake.

235
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,020
He's got pants!

236
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
I should have known you were behind this, Colonel.

237
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,600
Let me know how the audio is by the way.

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Snake.

239
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,860
Let me know how you feel.

240
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,240
Okay.

241
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,300
I can't remember what I want to hear in this.

242
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,660
I'm just going to leave you to your decision.

243
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,580
Thanks, bro.

244
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,800
And let's go back to the briefings.

245
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,720
That's what I'm saying.

246
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,100
Damn.

247
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,420
I always wanted a gun.

248
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,540
That was a good one.

249
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:24,580
And why are you still here?

250
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:24,620
I was in the army with you.

251
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,500
That was a good one.

252
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,640
We had a good time.

253
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,340
I think we can always join the army together.

254
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,640
I think so.

255
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,080
Good.

256
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm glad we're back.

257
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Thank you.

258
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,060
You're welcome.

259
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,820
Thank you, Obi-Wan.

260
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,780
You can change, move the cameras, I can.

261
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,400
Is there a way to zoom in?

262
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,260
I don't want to accidentally skip the cutscene.

263
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,580
Ew!

264
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,600
Don't touch me!

265
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,800
Who is this?

266
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm Dr. Naomi Hunter, the unit's chief medic.

267
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,640
An expert in gene therapy.

268
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,220
Are you military?

269
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,680
No, civilian.

270
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,260
I've been sent here from ATGC.

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
Pleasure to meet you, Snake.

272
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,940
Don't worry, this injection won't hurt a bit.

273
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,900
Don't touch me!

274
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,400
Oh!

275
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,200
Ah!

276
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,100
Oh, God.

277
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,880
I found out how to zoom in.

278
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,300
What's the shot for?

279
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,940
What's wrong?

280
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
You don't like shots?

281
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,240
No, I do not.

282
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,880
Snake, listen up.

283
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,300
Doesn't go any closer.

284
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,000
Camera A, how do I change it?

285
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,980
About five hours ago, an island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago, called Shadow Moses Island, was occupied by special ops soldiers.

286
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,360
What soldiers?

287
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,620
What is she doing, anyway?

288
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,020
Next generation special forces, led by members of Unit Foxhound.

289
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,840
Foxhound!

290
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,220
They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.

291
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,880
Take off your pants!

292
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,880
A nuclear weapon?

293
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,200
Also, how's he...

294
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm afraid so.

295
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,640
What hairstyle is he gonna change?

296
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,420
You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility.

297
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,200
Foxhound, hijacking a nuclear weapon?

298
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,580
Five nights in.

299
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,940
Now you understand how serious the situation is.

300
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,240
This is actually FNAF, you guys.

301
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
You have two objectives.

302
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,380
First, infiltrate the nuclear weapons disposal facility...

303
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,820
...and rescue the two hostages.

304
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,360
That's a suit!

305
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,880
Oh my gosh, that's so cool!

306
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,860
...and Kenneth Baker, president of Arms Tech.

307
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,400
Okay, I know those guys.

308
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,560
Those are some heavy-duty hostages.

309
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,780
Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike...

310
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,280
How do I get to the other camera?

311
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
Oh, let me try a trigger.

312
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,960
...and stop them if they do.

313
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,260
Oh!

314
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,700
Any questions, Snake?

315
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,260
Questions?

316
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,060
I haven't even said whether I accept this mission.

317
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh my gosh, so cool!

318
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,040
You can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation.

319
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,620
Welcome back, thank you!

320
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,350
Next one?

321
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,230
Oh, here we go.

322
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,430
Oh my god, the music is so awesome!

323
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,150
We will know if this is really a retelling...

324
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,790
...or if Snake's dumpy is still as chonky as it is supposed to be.

325
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,550
I think it is going to be as chonky, right?

326
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,010
Next one?

327
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,610
Infiltration.

328
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,790
The insertion method.

329
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,210
So cool!

330
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,790
Wait, what if I do Z?

331
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,050
Okay, it doesn't.

332
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,990
The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base.

333
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,410
Thank you!

334
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,310
Even with our most advanced intelligence-gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside.

335
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,510
Oh, Colonel!

336
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,650
Colonel!

337
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:40,970
Oh!

338
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,350
So, someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence and report back.

339
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,290
Yes.

340
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,310
Sounds like a spy method.

341
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,490
No one...

342
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,070
What's the insertion method?

343
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,930
No one even lats...

344
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,630
No one even bats an eye at it.

345
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,830
Sounds like a spy method.

346
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,430
Not the hand...

347
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,170
...the handgun.

348
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,610
The handgun.

349
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,530
The facility is equipped with sonar detection capabilities.

350
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,650
They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise.

351
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,610
And then...

352
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,930
God, it's so goofy.

353
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,310
You'll launch a one-man SDV.

354
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:20,950
Launch.

355
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,010
Launch?

356
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,730
Same as a torpedo.

357
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,750
Only this has no propulsion device of its own.

358
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,810
Bond.

359
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,950
James Bond.

360
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,730
After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.

361
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,890
From there on, you'll have to swim.

362
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,530
You want me to swim?

363
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:34,630
Swim.

364
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,810
In sub-zero Alaskan water.

365
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,770
Oh.

366
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,230
Oh.

367
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,010
Oh.

368
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,030
Oh.

369
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,150
That suit represents the latest advances in polyphonic technology.

370
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,430
Sorry if I'm switching around so much.

371
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,790
The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island.

372
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,650
Wait.

373
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,530
I'll instruct you by coach...

374
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,010
I think his dumpy is there.

375
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,990
You guys?

376
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,990
Anyone going with me?

377
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,390
Look at that.

378
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,870
As always, this is a one-man sneaking mission.

379
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,430
One -man sneaking mission.

380
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,490
Weapons and equipment OSP.

381
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:02,970
Yes.

382
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,390
Why are you even here?

383
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,550
This is a top-secret black-off.

384
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,030
Yeah, we get out of here.

385
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:07,910
Don't expect any official support.

386
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,030
He's cheeked up.

387
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,510
I'm embarrassed to look down.

388
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,890
I'm embarrassed to move the camera down.

389
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,560
We got our time.

390
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,520
That was my favorite part, though, of the briefings.

391
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,180
That I know of.

392
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,220
Where he goes...

393
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,820
Seems like a spy movie.

394
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,300
And he does his little handgun and nobody laughs at him or nobody makes a comment or anything.

395
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,080
He just...

396
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,520
Everyone's just kind of like...

397
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,240
Snake.

398
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,480
And then he's like...

399
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,800
Uh...

400
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:35,980
Uh...

401
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,960
What's the insertion method?

402
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,980
It's so funny.

403
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,620
What's the time limit?

404
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,060
Oh!

405
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,960
Jeez!

406
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,020
24 hours.

407
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,120
So exasperating.

408
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,980
They say they'll launch after 24 hours.

409
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,000
This is so goofy.

410
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,500
Yeah.

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah.

412
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,280
Did they say what the target will be?

413
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,080
So far.

414
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,060
I love this game for different reasons than one, you know?

415
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,460
Like...

416
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,880
They did the countdown.

417
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:05,980
You know?

418
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,700
Okay, so it's not 24 hours.

419
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,220
Gosh!

420
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,360
Are you okay, Snake?

421
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,680
Why does it just stop there?

422
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,380
Oh my gosh, so funny.

423
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,260
Wait, how do I go back?

424
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,880
Oh, there we go.

425
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,060
Okay.

426
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,200
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see...

427
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
Unit Foxhound.

428
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,820
I can't wait to see what they look like in the...

429
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,520
I'm so excited.

430
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,020
Person in charge of the operation.

431
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,120
He's like, bro...

432
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,260
He's like, no, you can't be serious.

433
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,320
What is... oh.

434
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,460
Hey!

435
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,420
Hey, no smoking on the job!

436
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,880
She actually tried.

437
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,160
She's still trying!

438
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,840
Get him.

439
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
Get him.

440
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,840
Get him, Naomi.

441
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,740
Oh!

442
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
Oh!

443
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,080
Come on.

444
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,600
Reach.

445
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,560
Just go in.

446
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,320
If you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities...

447
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,980
Oh my god, the spread.

448
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,140
Yo, Snake!

449
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,540
I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry.

450
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,620
Yet.

451
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,440
Is the National Security Agency in on this?

452
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,500
The Power Stats.

453
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,020
Yeah.

454
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,720
And so is the D.I.A.

455
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,800
The Defense Intelligence Agency.

456
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,040
The D.I.A.

457
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,740
Get him.

458
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,480
Get him, Naomi.

459
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,180
Get him.

460
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm starting to have a bad feeling about this.

461
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,080
They'll be sending us some support.

462
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,440
We don't need desk jockeys.

463
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,540
We need a nuclear weapons specialist.

464
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,620
Of course.

465
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,820
Yeah.

466
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,620
A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us.

467
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,360
Oh.

468
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,040
Oh, she got him!

469
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,210
Oh, yeah!

470
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,830
You get him.

471
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,730
You show him, girl.

472
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,750
That, you know what?

473
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,070
Respect.

474
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,070
She went for it.

475
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,090
She girl-bust her way.

476
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,610
Let's see.

477
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,270
Support crew.

478
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
She's talking about Nastasha, right?

479
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,500
Where is she?

480
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,360
Let her come in.

481
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,760
Enter the room.

482
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,260
Romanenko.

483
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,220
Oh, there she is.

484
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,880
Kinda.

485
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,600
Let me see.

486
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,620
Let me see her.

487
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,780
Come on, Snake.

488
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,300
She's built up an impressive record as an advisor for the nuclear emergency search team.

489
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,680
Contact her if you have any questions.

490
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,140
Nastasha.

491
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,460
She's also an expert on high-tech weapons.

492
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,240
A female.

493
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
Where is she working from?

494
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Her home in Los Angeles.

495
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,060
Oh, she's in LA.

496
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,660
California.

497
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,200
Ew.

498
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,000
California's a lot different than this place.

499
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,380
California, boo.

500
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,740
Ew.

501
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,530
Roy Campbell.

502
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,870
Our guy coming out of retirement.

503
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,710
All of us coming out of retirement.

504
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:45,910
Colonel.

505
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,630
Oh.

506
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,330
You're retired.

507
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,990
Why are you involved in this?

508
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,130
Because there aren't many people who know Foxhound as well as I do.

509
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,350
Wait, if I...

510
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,830
Is that the only reason?

511
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,710
Oh, yeah, baby.

512
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,030
I've been saving dreams for a long time.

513
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,170
I don't know anything else.

514
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,150
I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field.

515
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,650
Why are you...

516
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,430
Why are you look...

517
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,750
Why are you standing like that?

518
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,710
Oh, my God.

519
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,070
Oh, my God.

520
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

521
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,590
Tell me the real reason.

522
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:15,810
Oh.

523
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,970
Okay, Snake.

524
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,130
Sorry.

525
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,370
Oh.

526
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,150
Take it.

527
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,530
Come on.

528
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,010
Come on.

529
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,970
I'll be frank.

530
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,370
A person very dear to me.

531
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:34,790
Oh.

532
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,110
Oh, my God.

533
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,210
Is being held hostage.

534
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,790
Who is it?

535
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,010
What?

536
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,070
Don't act surprised, Naomi.

537
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:40,830
Meryl.

538
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,150
Don't act surprised.

539
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,190
Pikachu surprise.

540
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,590
She's like, why you have someone in there?

541
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,730
Oh, my...

542
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,970
Actually, I don't even know if she does know about Meryl being in there to be honest.

543
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,950
Actually, not sure.

544
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,890
This is so fun being able to move the camera around so fast.

545
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,610
What was your niece doing there?

546
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,950
Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt.

547
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,910
Meryl...

548
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,530
My niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement.

549
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,190
Aww.

550
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,690
Oh, he's got a picture of her in his pocket.

551
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,730
She looks like you.

552
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,570
She's my little brother's girl.

553
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,290
She looks like you.

554
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,470
...and since then I've been watching after her.

555
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,770
This is kind of messed up.

556
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,570
A personal motive, Colonel.

557
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,710
That's not very soldierly.

558
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,010
Oh.

559
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,290
I'm retired.

560
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,970
I'm retired.

561
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm just an old man now.

562
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,110
And I'm your friend.

563
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,630
Well, if you were merely my friend, you wouldn't have pulled me out of retirement either.

564
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,590
I've always been a friend since the fall of Zanzibar land.

565
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:56,930
Zanzibar!

566
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,650
Haven't you had enough of a moody bastard like me?

567
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,450
No.

568
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,130
That's the part of you I trust.

569
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,010
Zanzibar land.

570
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,110
Please, Snake.

571
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,730
Save my niece, Meryl.

572
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,670
She's just here.

573
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,690
Awkwardly standing.

574
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,670
Alright.

575
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,550
Okay.

576
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,730
But I have two conditions.

577
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,170
Name them.

578
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,830
One.

579
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,090
He's got that...

580
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,690
No more secrets between us.

581
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,870
He's got that Gollum posture.

582
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,690
I'm a complete disclosure at all times.

583
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,390
Snake, your gamer posture, please.

584
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:25,710
And two.

585
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,550
I'll only accept orders directly from you, Colonel.

586
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,010
No cut-offs involved, okay?

587
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,530
Oh, my precious.

588
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:31,970
Snake.

589
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,910
That's why I was...

590
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,130
He's back!

591
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:36,630
What?

592
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,230
What?

593
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,990
He's not Colonel anymore.

594
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,730
I am not a Colonel anymore.

595
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,370
Okay, Colonel.

596
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,490
Just a retired old war-horse.

597
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,110
Nah.

598
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,130
Naomi, what are you doing?

599
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,170
Why are you looking like that?

600
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,430
I understand, Colonel.

601
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,720
The way he scooted closer, so cute.

602
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
Why are they doing that?

603
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,080
We're stealing this together!

604
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,000
Ah, yes.

605
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,400
We have 19 hours left until this nuclear warhead explodes.

606
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,400
You know what?

607
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,280
Or until they launch the nuke.

608
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
Let's just kick back and relax on the bed a little bit, you know?

609
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,440
It's fine.

610
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,320
They're so cute!

611
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,860
Oh my gosh.

612
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,340
They're like actual bros, you know?

613
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,140
It's so cute.

614
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,340
Hanging out with the homies.

615
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,360
Oh, so cute.

616
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,560
Naomi's third wheeling?

617
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,300
Yeah, just a little bit.

618
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm invading their privacy!

619
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:41,940
Hold on.

620
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,980
It's like Naomi walked in on the wrong scene and doesn't know what to do.

621
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,540
Oh!

622
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,900
Oh, look at her!

623
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,340
He's...

624
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,240
Ah!

625
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Don't sit like that!

626
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,140
Snake!

627
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,180
Snake, you... you... hey!

628
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,200
It's a combination of nanomachines and an anti-freezing pathway.

629
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,780
Help, please!

630
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,800
Wait, he's like sat up like that!

631
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,840
When he's talking about her being naked!

632
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,700
Oh my god!

633
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,060
Snake!

634
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,180
There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline...

635
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,920
Nanomachines.

636
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,120
... and sugar in your bloodstream.

637
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,320
Now I don't have to worry about food.

638
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,220
No, that's Snake's worst enemy!

639
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,580
Or it's his worst fear!

640
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,620
Not eating!

641
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,340
No, drugs.

642
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,940
A class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning.

643
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,900
Mmm.

644
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
It'll make me smarter, huh?

645
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,420
Anything else?

646
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,620
Oh my god, the tension here.

647
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
It's a type of stimulant.

648
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
It'll keep you alert...

649
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,800
Now, he's even looking away!

650
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,080
He's like, now I'm third wheeling.

651
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,100
That was quite a cocktail.

652
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,100
Anything else in there?

653
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,200
Those nanomachines will also keep your codex batteries charged up.

654
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,880
Poor Roy.

655
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,360
Oh!

656
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,940
I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.

657
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,880
Stop!

658
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,820
Why are you doing this, Snake?

659
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,280
What?

660
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,380
The tummy rub.

661
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,700
The Snake tummy rub.

662
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,200
Thank you so much for the donut.

663
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,740
Thank you.

664
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,440
I guess I can call you when I wanna go on a diet.

665
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,640
Okay, last little bit.

666
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,840
Well, I say little bit, but it's quite a lot of bit.

667
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,740
That's okay.

668
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,480
Such a goofy old man he is.

669
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,520
The tension though.

670
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,500
Wow.

671
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,760
Okay, let's talk about the hostages.

672
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,100
Now we know the meaning of the twin snakes.

673
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,200
The chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company.

674
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,820
Mm-hmm.

675
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,860
What business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?

676
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,640
Let's try this angle a little bit.

677
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,640
Ooh.

678
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,900
The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked.

679
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,160
China.

680
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Look it.

681
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,360
Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved.

682
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,480
Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?

683
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm not privy to that information.

684
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,400
Do we know exactly where they're being held?

685
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,740
Why is he pointing his fingers?

686
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,120
Seriously.

687
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,180
Um, actually, do we know where they're being held?

688
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,660
I can't with the finger guns.

689
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,280
Oh, gosh, sorry.

690
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,200
I know I'm not paying attention, but also at the same time, I know most of this already, so it's fine.

691
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,200
It's more interesting to look at the visuals, you know?

692
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,940
Um, actually...

693
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,180
Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?

694
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,940
They say they do.

695
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,740
They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use.

696
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,040
He's doing it again.

697
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,560
Draw me like you're French, girl.

698
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,540
Was the number confirmed?

699
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
I'm afraid so.

700
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,500
What are you doing, Naomi?

701
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
At the very least...

702
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,120
What are you doing?

703
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,180
They got their hands on a real nuclear warhead.

704
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,560
Oh!

705
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,720
Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this type of terrorism?

706
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:23,980
Wait, no!

707
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,680
No, no!

708
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,260
Yes.

709
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,580
She's, like, massaging her calf.

710
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,720
Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a POW, which uses a discreet detonation.

711
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,220
Girlie, what?

712
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,360
POW.

713
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,700
Why did...

714
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,440
This is...

715
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,200
Wait, or she's pulling up her stocking?

716
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,400
I can't tell!

717
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,020
A safety control system built into all nuclear weapon systems.

718
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,800
Ma'am!

719
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,420
What are you doing?

720
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
We can't rest easy.

721
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,600
We're right here!

722
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,560
Why not?

723
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,900
Oh my god.

724
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,900
Because the DARPA chief knows the detonation code.

725
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,320
Yeah, she's pulling up her...

726
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Don't turn around, Snake.

727
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,340
Do not turn around.

728
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,780
It must have been removed from its missile.

729
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,680
All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled.

730
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,860
It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM.

731
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:05,940
What if...

732
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,140
That used to be true.

733
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,200
I can't...

734
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,780
I can't pay attention.

735
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,020
I'm just looking at Naomi.

736
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,000
But since the end of the Cold War...

737
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,060
Press R1.

738
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,260
...you can pay the money.

739
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,780
Also, her...

740
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,460
Her shoes are on the bed!

741
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,220
That's so gross!

742
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,260
Don't do that!

743
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,160
Oh my god.

744
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,280
There's a fly in my room.

745
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,320
I think I'm gonna lose it.

746
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,560
Get out of here!

747
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,140
This is a clean mid-cafe.

748
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,320
Not a stinky mid-cafe where flies can fly around.

749
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:31,660
Oh my god.

750
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,260
Every scene delivers something new.

751
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,840
It's so...

752
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,540
It's like...

753
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,520
It's like a...

754
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,580
It's like a tree, you know?

755
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,240
Everything is new.

756
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,630
How well armed are these terrorists?

757
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,130
I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted.

758
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,490
They're heavily armed, I'm afraid.

759
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,170
Heavily armed...

760
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,410
What about their battle experience?

761
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,610
The six in charge are planning to...

762
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:03,930
Why is she just standing there?

763
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:03,970
I don't know.

764
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,030
They're standing man emojis.

765
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,050
After all, they're foxhound people.

766
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,730
Hey.

767
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,670
You're gonna make me blush.

768
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,230
The others are next generation special forces.

769
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,750
They're not your average grunts either.

770
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,950
What was that?

771
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,810
That was like the most dramatic kick ever.

772
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,710
I can't.

773
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,650
I can't.

774
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,510
Oh my gosh.

775
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,950
You're gonna make me blush.

776
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,130
We're just...

777
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,970
I can't.

778
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:35,890
You're not kidding.

779
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,370
What is going on?

780
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,930
I cannot...

781
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,530
Can we watch it again?

782
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:40,810
Yeah.

783
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,490
That was really short, so let's watch it again.

784
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,690
That one was so funny.

785
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,830
Oh my goodness.

786
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,710
Oh my goodness.

787
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,090
Hold on.

788
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,870
I kinda wanna watch it.

789
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,810
How well armed are these terrorists?

790
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,190
Wait.

791
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:50,310
Hold on.

792
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,350
I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted.

793
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,690
They're heavily armed, I'm afraid.

794
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,770
There we go.

795
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,610
What about their battle experience?

796
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,710
The six in charge are planning to thugth.

797
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,970
Oh my gosh.

798
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,290
I'm embarrassed.

799
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,530
Why am I looking at him?

800
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,010
Thank you!

801
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,510
Good luck have fun on your Metal Gear Observation Dunia!

802
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,730
Oh my gosh!

803
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,790
The kick is so crazy!

804
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,490
I love it!

805
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,850
I'm such a fan.

806
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,810
I should have done Cabaret.

807
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,950
So what exactly are they demanding?

808
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,590
A person's remains.

809
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,470
Remains?

810
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,150
That's right.

811
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,710
To be more accurate.

812
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,630
Cell specimens which contain the individual's genetic information.

813
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,290
Cell specimens.

814
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,910
Why would they want that?

815
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,990
What are you doing?

816
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,670
The terrorists need them.

817
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,430
Oh god!

818
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,550
I didn't expect to change the camera.

819
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,290
I've never seen that.

820
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,230
Genes?

821
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,110
Strengthened?

822
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,150
You've heard of the Human Genome Project.

823
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:08,670
Oh gosh.

824
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,630
They've been mapping the human genome and they're nearly finished.

825
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,030
What?

826
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,170
Following up on this research.

827
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,130
Thank you so much!

828
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,170
The military has been working towards identifying those genes.

829
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,370
Which are responsible for making effective soldiers.

830
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,770
There are genes that do that.

831
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,470
Naomi over here like...

832
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,790
That's so weird!

833
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,190
They're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers.

834
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,110
That's so weird, right?

835
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,210
Gene therapy.

836
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,070
Yeah.

837
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,290
Gene therapy.

838
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,290
I'll explain this part.

839
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,190
Okay, here she comes.

840
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,650
Okay.

841
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,610
With gene therapy, it becomes easy to remove genes that cause sickness and disease.

842
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,250
Or, alternatively, to splice in additional genetic material.

843
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,430
Why are you so quiet?

844
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,150
You know what?

845
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,630
I knew that Naomi has...

846
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,050
She can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases.

847
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,630
And at the same time, add genetic characteristics as desired.

848
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,750
I knew she had no British accent in this one, but I completely forgot until just now.

849
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,050
And so you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier.

850
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,610
You could implant them in the same way, right?

851
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,350
No wonder they made him wear pants this time.

852
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,170
Can you imagine?

853
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,030
But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those soldier genes.

854
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,290
The genes.

855
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,470
And in order to do that, it's helpful if you can study the genetic information...

856
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,550
The genetic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever.

857
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,330
They un-British-ed her?

858
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,010
They did, yeah.

859
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,210
She loses her British accent for some reason.

860
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,740
I think for the most part, um...

861
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,160
Well, Liquid still has his accent.

862
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:51,980
Genes...

863
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,120
Mei-Ling also no longer has her...

864
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,640
Oh yeah, she doesn't have her accent either.

865
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,360
Yeah...

866
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,400
Is that Jennifer Hale?

867
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,940
Yes, it is still Jennifer Hale.

868
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,040
It is still almost...

869
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,120
Almost all the original voice actors.

870
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,180
Just a...

871
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,020
A few changes, like um...

872
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,980
Uh...

873
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,400
Uh...

874
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,120
What's his name?

875
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,720
Um...

876
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,280
Grey...

877
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,120
Grey Fox...

878
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,940
I'm trying to think of the voice actor's name.

879
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,520
Uh...

880
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,880
Jor...

881
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,800
Jor...

882
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,200
Jor...

883
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,920
Um...

884
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,880
I'm really sorry.

885
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,500
I've...

886
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:21,980
Uh...

887
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,860
I'm the ninja.

888
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,760
Um...

889
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,900
What's...

890
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,220
What's his voice actor's name again?

891
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,280
Greg!

892
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,360
Greg...

893
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,100
Greg Eagles.

894
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,480
Yes.

895
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,280
Greg Eagles.

896
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,500
Yes, yes, yes.

897
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,300
George Sears.

898
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,800
I know it started with a G.

899
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,500
It's so funny because I actually watched a video this morning about um...

900
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,980
About uh...

901
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,920
The voice actors of the Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy.

902
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,980
And Greg Eagles is also the voice of Grimm.

903
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,260
So it's really funny because it's just like...

904
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,760
Oh my gosh, you are...

905
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,340
You are...

906
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,320
Grey Fox?

907
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,920
And the DARPA chief?

908
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,380
And Grimm?

909
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,040
Like it's...

910
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,320
What?

911
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:02,760
Yeah!

912
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,040
Isn't that so awesome?

913
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,860
Isn't that so crazy?

914
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,880
Oh yeah, I totally forgot.

915
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,340
Yeah.

916
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,760
Grimm Fox.

917
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,760
It's so...

918
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,260
It's so...

919
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,720
It's um...

920
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,680
It was cool seeing...

921
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,100
Watching the video and being like...

922
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,420
I...

923
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,220
I got to meet him.

924
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,020
I went to...

925
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,980
MGS Con.

926
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,640
Last year.

927
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,040
And I got to meet him.

928
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,900
And he was selling like some prints of...

929
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,820
The Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy.

930
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,900
So...

931
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,940
I was like...

932
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,700
I was like...

933
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:34,820
Yo!

934
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,400
That was like one of my favorite shows as a kid.

935
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,480
So...

936
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,820
Because I loved Mandy.

937
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,460
Hater took a pay cut so all the OG VAs would come back.

938
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:47,980
Respect.

939
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,420
I love David Hater.

940
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,340
He's so...

941
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,380
Oh!

942
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,920
Big boss.

943
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Big boss?

944
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,000
That's right.

945
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,580
We've been working feverishly to identify him.

946
00:35:59,580 --> 00:35:59,880
He's so...

947
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
We had to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill.

948
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,820
Oh!

949
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,340
So far, we've discovered about 60 of the so called soldier genes.

950
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,300
They have so much personality when they move around, you know?

951
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,760
I just love it so much.

952
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,140
So his body was recovered after all.

953
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,200
Yes.

954
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,700
And his cells have remained frozen in a cryo chamber.

955
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,080
I thought he was naked for a second.

956
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,560
Oh my gosh.

957
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,220
His genetic information is a priceless treasure to mankind.

958
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,920
Respectator.

959
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,280
He's so awesome.

960
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,460
He's so good to his fans, too.

961
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
They already have!

962
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,800
You!

963
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,060
It's your fault!

964
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,760
Oh, hello.

965
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,120
What are you doing?

966
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,080
I think he was getting the dust off of his jacket.

967
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,440
Checking the fly.

968
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,740
Your zipper's down, Colonel!

969
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,320
Okay.

970
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,120
Okay.

971
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,500
The sons of Big Boss.

972
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,540
Dramatic stupid.

973
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,980
The sons of Big Boss.

974
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,360
Nice.

975
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,100
Next Generation Special Forces Unit.

976
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,240
These guys... don't mess with them.

977
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,600
They have an IQ of 180, everybody.

978
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,200
I'm telling you.

979
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,780
Don't mess with them.

980
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,300
Tell me about these Next Generation Special Forces.

981
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,920
Why do you look like you're about to jump him?

982
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:59,140
They started out as an anti-terrorist special ops unit made up of former members of biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

983
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:07,380
Their purpose was to respond to threats involving Next Generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC weapons.

984
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,900
Until they were added, that is.

985
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,500
They.

986
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,780
Who's they?

987
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,020
Oh my god.

988
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,720
These guys didn't start out as regular army.

989
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,500
Looks like a pretty international group.

990
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,760
Mercenaries.

991
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,740
Look at them!

992
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,200
Look at them!

993
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,940
They're little portraits!

994
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,200
And it gets worse.

995
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:26,640
So cute!

996
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,800
Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with.

997
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,180
They were part of Big Boss's private guard.

998
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,360
And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts.

999
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,680
What was one guy?

1000
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,300
Oh, like this guy?

1001
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,340
The speedy, fast man.

1002
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,960
Outer Heaven.

1003
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,040
Outer Heaven, baby!

1004
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,300
After that, they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21.

1005
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,760
Running Man.

1006
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:03,420
If you ask me, these so-called Next Generation Special Forces should be called Simulating Soldiers.

1007
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:03,760
Why isn't he back?

1008
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:03,920
Man.

1009
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,800
They have no real battle experience.

1010
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,180
Gosh, I really hope we get to see Decoy Octopus in this game.

1011
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,300
Video game generation, huh?

1012
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,400
Video game!

1013
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,840
Don't forget, they've all been strengthened with gene therapy.

1014
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,820
And they're smarter.

1015
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,060
They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers.

1016
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,540
Oh, yes.

1017
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,300
Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience.

1018
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:19,780
Okay.

1019
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,740
I thought international law banned the military use of genetic therapy.

1020
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,700
Yes, but those are just declarations, not actual treaties.

1021
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,940
The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack.

1022
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,820
What I think I like most about this scene...

1023
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,020
Well, until the static part.

1024
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,480
Is the bitrate okay?

1025
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,840
On it?

1026
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,720
On YouTube?

1027
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,600
And, like, watching it?

1028
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,900
Like, it doesn't mess up, does it?

1029
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,500
Why do they keep talking about pants therapy?

1030
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,020
Yeah, looks fine?

1031
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,600
Looks good?

1032
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,380
Cool.

1033
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,620
Looking clear?

1034
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,740
Good, good, good.

1035
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,320
Even though it's, like, all, like, kind of funky looking, you know?

1036
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,820
What the hell is that gif?

1037
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Hahaha.

1038
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,560
Thank you!

1039
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,000
Thank you!

1040
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,460
Thank you!

1041
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,840
Greg Eagles!

1042
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,060
Greg Eagles is still the DARPA chief.

1043
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,040
Yes.

1044
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,460
Oh, Rob Paulson.

1045
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,800
Oh, Yakko!

1046
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,520
Oh, okay.

1047
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,760
It's gonna be interesting to hear it, then.

1048
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,360
But if they were regular army, they must have been interviewed periodically by army counselors.

1049
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,580
According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests.

1050
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,740
They all seemed like fine, upstanding, patriotic soldiers.

1051
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,460
They're so patriotic.

1052
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,020
But they all took part in the uprising?

1053
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,260
No.

1054
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,440
Several people didn't show up.

1055
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,600
They didn't show up on the day of the exercise.

1056
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,420
That's why there was a resupply of troops.

1057
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,300
They cheated on their tests?

1058
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,760
Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?

1059
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,480
All I just realized?

1060
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,660
For free?

1061
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,320
There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely.

1062
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,220
Toes out?

1063
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:03,020
Apparently, they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments.

1064
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,800
They can do that?

1065
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,520
Oh my god!

1066
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,060
Oh my god!

1067
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,440
Ah!

1068
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,220
Don't get closer!

1069
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,460
Oh my god!

1070
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,800
Stop!

1071
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,180
Not the way he looks away again.

1072
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,060
Oh my god!

1073
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,940
Colonel, please!

1074
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,700
Put an end to this!

1075
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,760
Colonel, I'm uncomfortable!

1076
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,780
I'm uncomfortable!

1077
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,420
Yeah, get away.

1078
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,960
Shy boy.

1079
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,120
He's a bit of a shy boy.

1080
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,300
Be a soldier, Mint.

1081
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,700
Sorry.

1082
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,080
Sorry.

1083
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,620
All right.

1084
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,580
Last one.

1085
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,360
Maybe.

1086
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,880
Unless...

1087
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,860
I don't think they add another one.

1088
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,340
They might.

1089
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,080
They might add one about Liquid, right?

1090
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,840
I don't remember.

1091
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,420
We'll see.

1092
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,320
Unit Foxhound.

1093
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,360
This is just how it goes starting a Metal Gear Solid game.

1094
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
The briefings are long.

1095
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,700
Special Forces Unit Foxhound.

1096
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,240
Your former unit.

1097
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,420
And one that I was the commander of.

1098
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,860
An elite group combining firepower and expertise.

1099
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,340
They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them.

1100
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,520
So they're still around.

1101
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,380
Hmm.

1102
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,040
There are six members of Foxhound involved in this terrorist activity.

1103
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,640
He really does have terrible back posture.

1104
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,120
Psycho Mantis.

1105
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,260
With his powerful psychic abilities.

1106
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,000
Wait.

1107
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,160
Where's their pictures?

1108
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:21,560
Sniper Wolf.

1109
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,300
The beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

1110
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,920
He's like...

1111
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,080
Wait.

1112
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,740
He's going through them.

1113
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,480
Decoy Octopus.

1114
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,820
Master of disguise.

1115
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,800
Wait.

1116
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,640
I want to see them too.

1117
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,340
Your oxygen.

1118
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,700
Thank you.

1119
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,700
Oh.

1120
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,440
Is that it?

1121
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,820
Hello?

1122
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,000
Vulcan Raven.

1123
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,300
Oh.

1124
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,360
Oh.

1125
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,820
Giant and Shaman.

1126
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,320
And Revolver Ocelot.

1127
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,380
Specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter.

1128
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,000
Dramatic pause.

1129
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,940
Sounds like a bunch of cartoon characters.

1130
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,820
Maybe...

1131
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,060
In charge of them.

1132
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,360
Was he doing something that was off screen?

1133
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,340
I don't know.

1134
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,280
Liquid Snake.

1135
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,980
Liquid Snake.

1136
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,800
Yes.

1137
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,760
Liquid Snake.

1138
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,160
And you're the only person who can stand against him.

1139
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,680
Where'd Naomi go?

1140
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,300
Hello?

1141
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,500
Naomi?

1142
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,160
Wait.

1143
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,600
Where is she?

1144
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:17,980
Naomi?

1145
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,440
Okay.

1146
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,780
There was one for Liquid Snake.

1147
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,700
I knew there would be.

1148
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,640
She Liquid Snaked.

1149
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,380
Oh.

1150
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,160
She was behind Roy.

1151
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,420
He's just that much of a unit.

1152
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,900
Liquid Snake.

1153
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,540
The man who shares your code name.

1154
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,680
The Solid.

1155
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,100
Versus the Liquid.

1156
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,460
Tell me what you know.

1157
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:39,660
I don't know.

1158
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,640
Tell me what you know.

1159
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,800
He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager.

1160
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,240
The youngest person in the SAS.

1161
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,360
And the sass.

1162
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,880
He is pretty sassy.

1163
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,120
His job was to track down and destroy mobile scud missile launching platforms.

1164
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,140
You were there too, I believe.

1165
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,420
Didn't you infiltrate Western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?

1166
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,520
I was just a kid myself back then.

1167
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,100
Aww.

1168
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,400
The details are classified.

1169
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,140
But it seems that originally, he penetrated the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS.

1170
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,720
How do you feel about that?

1171
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,640
How do you feel about that?

1172
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,340
He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service.

1173
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,640
But he never once showed his face in Century House.

1174
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,260
He was taken prisoner in Iraq.

1175
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,220
And after that, there was no trace of him for several years.

1176
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,240
Yeah.

1177
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,540
You like Castlevania, don't you?

1178
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,040
After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of Foxhound.

1179
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,260
I thought that by the time I left, they were no longer using code names.

1180
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,280
I don't know his real name.

1181
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,420
That interesting.

1182
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,860
That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it.

1183
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,400
I know it.

1184
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,820
Here's a photo of him.

1185
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,220
Let me see.

1186
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,400
Let me see.

1187
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,320
Oh my gosh!

1188
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,480
Wait!

1189
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,280
You can actually see it!

1190
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,040
You can actually tell that it's him!

1191
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,460
Pretty shocking.

1192
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,060
His skin tone is different.

1193
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,520
Otherwise, you two are exact duplicates.

1194
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,500
I have a twin?

1195
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,020
I don't know the details, but it seems so.

1196
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,100
I have a twin?

1197
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,980
That's why we really need you for this mission.

1198
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,340
You're the only one who can beat him.

1199
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,900
Big Boss was kind of freaky out there.

1200
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,540
You've got something that he doesn't.

1201
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,960
Why don't I find that thought more comforting?

1202
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
Why is he standing like that?

1203
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,560
Why was he standing like that?

1204
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,680
Like the Hulk.

1205
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,040
All right.

1206
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,360
Guys, how are we feeling?

1207
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,480
Are we getting a good vibe of the game so far?

1208
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,780
Getting a good vibe of what we're in for?

1209
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:54,900
Oh!

1210
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,240
Wait!

1211
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,400
No!

1212
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:55,760
No!

1213
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:55,920
No!

1214
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,020
No!

1215
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,040
How do I get out?

1216
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,220
Thank you!

1217
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,680
Really digging the MGS telenovela.

1218
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,920
Oh, here we go.

1219
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,750
Oh, yeah.

1220
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:18,530
Oh, the haircut.

1221
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:20,270
Wait.

1222
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:20,970
Did I just accidentally...

1223
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,650
Did I accidentally skip something?

1224
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,470
Maybe that was the part where he cuts his hair.

1225
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,310
Oh, no!

1226
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,570
I thought it...

1227
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,590
I thought I had accidentally...

1228
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:37,550
I thought I had accidentally clicked on the file zero again.

1229
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,830
Okay.

1230
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:39,110
Hold on.

1231
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,830
Maybe if I leave again, it will do it.

1232
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:41,170
Right?

1233
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,230
Let's see.

1234
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,450
No!

1235
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,820
I missed it!

1236
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,180
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1237
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,700
I'm sorry.

1238
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,060
I haven't seen this title screen in so long.

1239
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:05,640
If I wait on this screen, I don't think it shows the video, but that's okay.

1240
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,220
I think we still see it when we do a new game anyway, so...

1241
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,460
We press on.

1242
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,000
You have to select exit.

1243
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,780
That's what I did.

1244
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,620
I pressed exit.

1245
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,340
Watch the last brief...

1246
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,540
Okay.

1247
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,480
Let's try that one more time.

1248
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,960
Sorry.

1249
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
I do want to see it.

1250
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,600
I'm sorry.

1251
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,260
I thought I accidentally pressed zero again.

1252
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:24,680
Oh!

1253
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,500
Let's try it.

1254
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,680
Liquid snakes wasn't that long.

1255
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,240
Right?

1256
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,290
It's just audio again, I think.

1257
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:36,750
Don't worry.

1258
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:37,630
Oh, is it?

1259
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,430
Let's just try it, though.

1260
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:41,910
It's okay.

1261
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,170
It's okay, guys.

1262
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,190
No worries.

1263
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,130
No rush.

1264
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,350
Liquid snake.

1265
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,670
Liquid snake.

1266
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,710
Liquid snake.

1267
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:48,970
Ugh.

1268
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,270
My controller cord is like everywhere.

1269
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,830
The solid versus the liquid.

1270
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,150
Tell me what you know.

1271
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:56,970
I don't know.

1272
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,950
He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS.

1273
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,830
His job was to track down and destroy mobile scud missile launching platforms.

1274
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:10,050
Bum bum.

1275
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,890
You were there too, I believe.

1276
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,270
Oh my gosh, the almost convenient censoring of...

1277
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,070
What if they censored...

1278
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,450
Like, what if Snake really was...

1279
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,210
I was just kidding myself back then.

1280
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:20,850
...snakey.

1281
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,010
And like they just censored him in crazy ways.

1282
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,970
Kind of like how in MJS2 with Raiden, when he's on the Torch.

1283
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:27,370
They censor him with a torture device.

1284
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,890
They censor him with like the straw from the soda can.

1285
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,250
I'm like an Austin Powers.

1286
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:36,890
Yes, yes, yes!

1287
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,890
I've never seen Austin Powers.

1288
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,290
I've never seen Austin Powers.

1289
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,970
I thought that by the time I left, they were no longer using code names.

1290
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,770
My mom never let me.

1291
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,030
She said it was too inappropriate.

1292
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,890
She was like, you're not allowed to... you're not allowed to...

1293
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:02,930
Oh my gosh!

1294
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:03,470
You can see him there!

1295
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,030
You can see him!

1296
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:04,430
You can see him!

1297
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:07,690
But yeah...

1298
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:10,970
Makes sense.

1299
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,110
Yeah, she was like, you're not allowed to watch.

1300
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,170
The gasp.

1301
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,550
He doesn't look like he gets a haircut.

1302
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,790
He looks... unless like...

1303
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:34,610
He looks more like how he does in... in 2 maybe.

1304
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,950
Maybe he's got like a little bit of a longer hair?

1305
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,650
It doesn't look like he cuts that much.

1306
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,270
The stance.

1307
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,290
The stance.

1308
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:55,450
Okay.

1309
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,270
Okay.

1310
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,850
Now... exit.

1311
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,030
It's okay.

1312
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,910
It's okay.

1313
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,150
We missed out, but...

1314
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,230
All he does is cut his hair.

1315
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,150
Okay!

1316
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:12,790
New game!

1317
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,130
Normal.

1318
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,410
Hard.

1319
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,770
Very easy.

1320
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:18,330
Easy.

1321
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,230
I got... I'm gonna try on normal.

1322
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,790
Because I feel like...

1323
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:26,650
Rip.

1324
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:27,090
Run.

1325
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,830
But again, this is my first time using a GameCube controller.

1326
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:35,990
So I'm gonna...

1327
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,150
Do my bestest.

1328
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,490
You're a pro?

1329
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:39,890
Oh.

1330
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,330
Absolutely.

1331
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,700
Oh.

1332
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,360
I am...

1333
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,640
A pro.

1334
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,870
Absolutely.

1335
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,110
Mint?

1336
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,450
Boss?

1337
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,070
Big... Big Moss?

1338
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,770
Oh my god.

1339
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,010
Thank you for the pink!

1340
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:09,970
Thank you so much!

1341
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,030
Let's go.

1342
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,970
Radar for novices?

1343
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,590
Standard.

1344
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,010
There we go.

1345
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:18,510
Game start?

1346
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,770
Yes!

1347
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,170
Here we go!

1348
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,090
David Hayter!

1349
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:30,910
Yeah!

1350
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,150
Christopher Randolph!

1351
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:36,510
Yeah!

1352
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,810
Debbie Mae West!

1353
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,330
Yeah!

1354
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:43,950
Paul Eiding!

1355
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:44,170
Yeah!

1356
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:44,750
Jennifer Hale!

1357
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:44,990
Yeah!

1358
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:45,990
Kim Iguess!

1359
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:46,390
Yeah!

1360
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,560
Whoa!

1361
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,140
Whoa!

1362
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:51,640
Whoa!

1363
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,900
Rob Wilson!

1364
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,160
Yeah!

1365
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,900
Patrick Zimmerman!

1366
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,140
Yeah!

1367
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:56,620
Doug Stone!

1368
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:56,980
Yeah!

1369
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:03,500
Patrick Zimmerman, the voice of Ocelot, is the husband of Chris Zimmerman.

1370
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,200
Who... She is the one who, like, directed all the voices and everything.

1371
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,840
Like, she's... she's so awesome.

1372
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,020
Her dir... Whoa!

1373
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,000
Her direction for the games is just so cool.

1374
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,960
But they were like, who do we get to voice Ocelot?

1375
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,000
And they... look at the rats.

1376
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,740
They just kind of, like, chose him.

1377
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,620
And he was so perfect.

1378
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,340
Stay alert.

1379
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,320
He'll beat you here.

1380
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,080
Wow!

1381
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,740
I'm going to swap down a couple of bothersome flies.

1382
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,880
There he goes.

1383
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,560
Liquid.

1384
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,900
There he goes.

1385
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,560
Bothersome flies.

1386
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,100
Kim Clark!

1387
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,320
Yes!

1388
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,240
He's so him.

1389
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:54,780
I know.

1390
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,560
It's so great.

1391
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,260
Ooh, the sounds are, like, kind of nice.

1392
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,300
Look at us.

1393
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,360
Wait, where'd our flippers go?

1394
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,140
I guess we just dumped them.

1395
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,180
Nobody sees me.

1396
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,900
Sneaky sneaky!

1397
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,760
Nobody, nobody sees.

1398
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,800
It's good to have you back, boss.

1399
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,460
Thank you!

1400
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,400
Thanks for the super chat!

1401
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,500
This is Snake.

1402
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,740
Colonel, can you hear me?

1403
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,140
Loud and clear.

1404
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,100
What's the situation, Snake?

1405
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,980
Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.

1406
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,360
Just as I expected.

1407
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,100
You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.

1408
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,400
But make sure nobody sees you.

1409
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,940
Yep.

1410
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,060
If you need to, contact me by codec.

1411
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,640
The frequency is one four zero point eight five.

1412
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,600
One four zero point eight...

1413
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,980
When you want to use the codec, push the pause button and then the A button.

1414
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,360
What?

1415
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,620
When we need to contact you, the codec will beep.

1416
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,700
When you hear that noise, press the pause button and then the A button to receive the call.

1417
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,180
What?

1418
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,260
Oh.

1419
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:04,640
It's two buttons?

1420
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,400
The codec's receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear.

1421
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,140
Oh my gosh.

1422
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,860
No one but you will be able to hear it.

1423
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,620
My small bones.

1424
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,340
Got it.

1425
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:12,480
Okay.

1426
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,620
I'm ready to go.

1427
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,540
I guess it makes sense because there is no select on the controller.

1428
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,380
Okay.

1429
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,460
Oh, wow.

1430
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,380
Hello, Colonel.

1431
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,680
Snake, you'll have to crawl to get through there.

1432
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,140
Okay.

1433
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,880
First, crouch down by pressing the crawl button.

1434
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,620
What does that mean?

1435
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,100
And then press the control stick in the direction you want to crawl.

1436
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:32,780
Okay.

1437
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,420
Just remember that you can't move very fast when you're crawling.

1438
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,340
You can stand up by pressing the crawl button again.

1439
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:38,900
Okay.

1440
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,860
Thank you.

1441
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,440
Okay.

1442
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,840
Start plus A button.

1443
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,440
Is there still the ration down here or...

1444
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,800
Oh, yes, there is.

1445
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,000
I'll take that.

1446
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,800
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

1447
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,860
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp.

1448
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:55,940
Nice.

1449
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,160
Uh, get up there.

1450
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,800
Get up.

1451
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,100
Okay, nice.

1452
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,280
Okay, so Y is basically triangle to action button.

1453
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,620
Good to know.

1454
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,020
And then crawl...

1455
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,100
Okay.

1456
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,420
That's B.

1457
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,500
A is nothing.

1458
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,580
Oh, X.

1459
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:18,960
Okay.

1460
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,800
Okay.

1461
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,520
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop.

1462
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,480
Whoa.

1463
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,210
And then up.

1464
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:30,850
Look at the rat.

1465
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,050
Look at the rat.

1466
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,210
Look at him go.

1467
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,330
He's so fat.

1468
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:38,350
He's so fat.

1469
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:40,990
Okay.

1470
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,690
My cigarettes, my skull.

1471
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,630
Okay, my ration.

1472
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,210
Okay.

1473
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,330
Oh!

1474
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,790
Okay, this is first person view.

1475
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,710
Okay.

1476
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:57,550
Oh shit.

1477
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,750
No one.

1478
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,770
No one.

1479
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:05,450
Why is your vision so good already?

1480
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,580
Hey, hold on though.

1481
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,040
They're stupid.

1482
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,600
They don't know.

1483
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,500
They can't get over here.

1484
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,560
I'm trying to figure out the controls.

1485
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,400
Can you leave me alone for like two seconds?

1486
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,100
The other ration is over there.

1487
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,920
Then there should be another ration.

1488
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,200
No!

1489
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,080
Don't die in security!

1490
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,480
180 IQ, by the way.

1491
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,000
I mean, he saw me.

1492
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,320
That was pretty good, the way he saw me.

1493
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,040
It's not bad.

1494
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,180
It's not bad, right?

1495
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,160
Okay.

1496
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,700
From... from... Okay, okay.

1497
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,440
I have to get used to X as the crawl button.

1498
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,400
That's so weird.

1499
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,520
It's... it's... it's new.

1500
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,740
It's... it's strange, but it's okay.

1501
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,960
We're gonna... we're gonna... we're gonna fumble a little bit.

1502
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,300
Oh my gosh, I just pressed the wrong button again.

1503
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,000
This is fine.

1504
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,720
We're gonna fumble...

1505
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,380
Wait, I think he saw me at the same time.

1506
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:31,980
No!

1507
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,800
Oh my god!

1508
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,440
Oh my god!

1509
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,140
No!

1510
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,380
I was in a cutscene!

1511
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,680
This is so unfair!

1512
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,280
This is so unfair!

1513
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,160
They won't come over here.

1514
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,060
They also won't see me.

1515
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,400
From here.

1516
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,540
Oh my gosh.

1517
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,920
Oh wow, the water going down the thing is so cool.

1518
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,960
Look, he's just gonna leave.

1519
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,540
This is so messed up, you guys.

1520
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,420
This is messed up.

1521
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,860
Oh please, just go away so I can start the game!

1522
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,520
Um, I think, um...

1523
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,900
What was it?

1524
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,940
Uh, there... okay, so this is crawl.

1525
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,360
Okay.

1526
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,060
Don't see me, you bastard.

1527
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,820
Don't see me.

1528
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,420
I need to go get the gun.

1529
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,040
Where's the rest of the guys though?

1530
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,420
Hold on.

1531
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,420
Okay, this way.

1532
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,880
Alright, go snake, go.

1533
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,820
Okay.

1534
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,040
We're not gonna let them see us.

1535
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,300
I got distracted by the rat at first, okay.

1536
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,780
But not this time.

1537
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,160
We're gonna flip this guy.

1538
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,100
We're gonna flip him over.

1539
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,700
I think it's A.

1540
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,880
Yeah, return your positions, everybody!

1541
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,140
Nothing weird going on here.

1542
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:01,900
Thank you!

1543
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,380
Okay.

1544
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,100
Turn around.

1545
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,180
Oh.

1546
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,740
Grab him!

1547
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,420
Grab him!

1548
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,340
Oh god, no!

1549
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:18,760
Grab him!

1550
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,720
No, why?

1551
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,460
No, uh, okay, we're fine.

1552
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,630
Yoink!

1553
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,910
He didn't see anything.

1554
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,140
He didn't see anything!

1555
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,400
Oh my god, he's so short!

1556
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,520
I would've never seen you, pipsqueak!

1557
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,580
I would've never even noticed you were there!

1558
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,740
It was not accidental!

1559
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,280
For the M9.

1560
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,120
Okay, I think I can go.

1561
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:57,880
You know what?

1562
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,060
Alright, let's go snake.

1563
00:59:59,640 --> 00:59:59,760
Ah!

1564
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,400
It's the enemy.

1565
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,120
I need help.

1566
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,240
Uh...

1567
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,740
Uh...

1568
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,540
Open the...

1569
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,180
Start the...

1570
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,180
Start the...

1571
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,700
Start the elevator.

1572
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,500
Uh...

1573
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,680
Uh, you guys?

1574
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,680
This is not good.

1575
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,720
Um, okay.

1576
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,080
This is our first time...

1577
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,280
How do I shoot?

1578
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:15,700
Wait.

1579
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,660
Okay, hold on.

1580
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,680
How do I use the gun?

1581
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,280
Uh oh.

1582
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:19,740
Uh...

1583
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,300
Ah!

1584
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,620
Oh gosh, I'm fighting with my hands!

1585
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:24,740
Wait!

1586
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,420
Hold on!

1587
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:25,920
I can't...

1588
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,800
Stop it!

1589
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,020
I don't know how to shoot!

1590
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,800
This is unfair!

1591
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:30,620
Wait.

1592
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,180
Uh...

1593
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,320
Press A button to aim!

1594
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,540
A!

1595
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,380
A!

1596
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,340
Oh, I...

1597
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,020
I unequipped it.

1598
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,180
We're fine, everybody.

1599
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,840
Oh sh...

1600
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,780
What the hell was that?

1601
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:41,980
Um...

1602
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,340
Oh my god.

1603
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,680
I don't know how to use these controllers!

1604
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,760
Caught in the dodge roll.

1605
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:55,280
I know!

1606
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,520
It was so...

1607
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,500
Okay.

1608
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,140
Alright.

1609
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:58,720
This is...

1610
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,280
This is fine.

1611
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
This is so fine, you guys.

1612
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,060
This is fine.

1613
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,580
Do I still have my...

1614
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,080
No.

1615
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,680
Let's go.

1616
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:05,880
Oh.

1617
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,920
I don't want that.

1618
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,580
Go away.

1619
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,620
Okay.

1620
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,600
This is fine, everybody.

1621
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,980
Give me that.

1622
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,820
Stop, stop, stop.

1623
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,140
Yes, yes, yes!

1624
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,040
It's just a little bit of a...

1625
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,360
Um...

1626
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,940
A little bit of a...

1627
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,500
I don't know.

1628
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:28,940
I don't know.

1629
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,940
Performance anxiety, but we're fine.

1630
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,080
I wish I had my gun.

1631
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,440
Don't...

1632
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,220
Don't see me here.

1633
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,720
Turn around and walk away.

1634
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,400
Don't get distracted by the rat.

1635
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:43,800
I'm sorry.

1636
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,040
Don't get distracted by the rat!

1637
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,940
Where is he anyway?

1638
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,560
I think that guy's gonna walk over here.

1639
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,020
I do want to get the other ration in the other corner.

1640
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,720
We can probably forego the one...

1641
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,840
That was... what's the word?

1642
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:20,240
The one in the lower corner.

1643
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,160
He's gonna come back here.

1644
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,240
He's gonna pass us, I think.

1645
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,580
Actually, I don't know their route at all.

1646
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,740
Oh, here he is.

1647
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:30,860
Look at you.

1648
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:31,900
Teeny tiny.

1649
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,220
Little baby.

1650
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,200
What's the... what is that sound?

1651
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,640
It's like a scuttle...

1652
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,110
Oh, there it is.

1653
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,470
And then there's another guy on there.

1654
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,710
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

1655
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,830
So I... wait, do I need to press a button while I'm in there?

1656
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,430
It must be Y then, right?

1657
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,290
To press the button or...

1658
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,070
I guess?

1659
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,110
Snake made win.

1660
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:05,330
Oh.

1661
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:10,470
Doki doki.

1662
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,150
Doki doki waku waku.

1663
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,630
Maybe not waku waku.

1664
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,550
I don't know where this guy goes.

1665
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,330
Okay, I wanna be able to shoot him.

1666
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:22,070
So once this guy comes back through here, I gotta...

1667
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:25,830
Okay, so it's A... A and Z.

1668
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,450
Right?

1669
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,930
Okay.

1670
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:30,710
Wait, how do I get out of here?

1671
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,310
It must be Y, right?

1672
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:32,990
It's triangle.

1673
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:37,890
Oh.

1674
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:38,250
Hey!

1675
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:39,910
Get out of here!

1676
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:41,510
Lazy bones!

1677
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,570
Come on, get out of here.

1678
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,470
I don't know what their pattern is.

1679
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,510
Okay, it's Y to get out of here.

1680
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:50,690
We don't wanna get out just yet.

1681
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:53,130
Are they gonna see me?

1682
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,630
Don't see me.

1683
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,010
Okay.

1684
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:00,690
Oh, wait.

1685
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:01,570
This one.

1686
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:02,470
No.

1687
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,430
I was right.

1688
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:04,930
Okay, A...

1689
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:08,310
Oh, gosh.

1690
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,030
Can you peek around the corner again?

1691
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:14,310
Oh, my God.

1692
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:14,550
No!

1693
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,250
Oh, gosh!

1694
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:16,910
Dang it!

1695
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:17,610
Stop it!

1696
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:18,330
Stop!

1697
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,310
Stop shooting me!

1698
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,430
I can't with this... Oh, I got him.

1699
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,430
Oh, my God.

1700
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:23,370
Stop shooting me.

1701
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,130
I'm trying to learn the controls.

1702
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,730
I've never played on this tank thing.

1703
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:28,990
Wait, I'm holding the gun.

1704
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:29,690
Oh, I unequipped.

1705
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,050
Wait.

1706
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,630
I didn't unequip it.

1707
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,130
What happened?

1708
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,150
I missed it.

1709
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,700
Why are you just shooting?

1710
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,050
Okay, he's gone.

1711
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,980
Maybe I can get him from over here.

1712
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,900
Oh, dang it.

1713
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,300
You jerk.

1714
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:55,980
Hey.

1715
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,640
Hey, you.

1716
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,020
Hey.

1717
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,700
Hey, you.

1718
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,040
Oh.

1719
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,700
Can I... It's B, right?

1720
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,540
There we go.

1721
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:03,920
Okay.

1722
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:04,940
All right.

1723
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,420
Don't... Oh, my God.

1724
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,140
Oh, please shoot.

1725
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:09,880
Please shoot.

1726
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,400
Can I loot these?

1727
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:18,680
Oh.

1728
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:20,920
It's fine.

1729
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,760
Of course, getting out of the dang locker.

1730
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,480
Okay.

1731
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,120
It's fine, though.

1732
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,940
We got this, you guys.

1733
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,560
This game... I just got to get used to it a little bit.

1734
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,080
Oh.

1735
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,000
What is going on?

1736
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,300
Oh, wow.

1737
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,420
Oh.

1738
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,360
Oh, oh.

1739
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,560
There's the hindie.

1740
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,460
Liquid.

1741
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,670
Oh, my God.

1742
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,370
Oh,

1743
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,800
my God.

1744
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,080
Oh, my God.

1745
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,290
Oh.

1746
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:22,530
Yo, that was so crazy.

1747
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,270
That was crazy.

1748
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,330
Yeah.

1749
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:26,390
Oh, no.

1750
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:40,150
Also, for anyone curious, I'm not necessarily going for a full non-lethal route because I feel in this game it doesn't make much sense.

1751
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,690
I will maybe for the guards.

1752
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,010
There might be some times I kill guards.

1753
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:48,150
But for the bosses, I'm going to kill them.

1754
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,250
Because it only makes sense.

1755
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,730
They end up dying anyway.

1756
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,430
So, I gotta kill them.

1757
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:57,990
Ultraviolets.

1758
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,030
You enjoy all the killing.

1759
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:05,250
Sorry.

1760
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,930
Sorry, Colonel.

1761
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:15,090
Age hasn't slowed you down one bit.

1762
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,850
Not the call-out line.

1763
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,590
Take it.

1764
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:28,690
If it weren't for your suit and your shot, I would have turned into a popsicle out there.

1765
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,030
Took you a long time.

1766
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,050
All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it.

1767
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,050
I see.

1768
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,830
I'm relieved to hear that.

1769
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:37,910
Sorry, Colonel.

1770
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,590
I had coffee and it's making me shake a little.

1771
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:42,090
By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?

1772
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:46,130
Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

1773
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,110
The terrorist radar should have already picked them up.

1774
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:51,090
Phew.

1775
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,810
Hind D?

1776
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:55,970
Colonel.

1777
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,510
What's the Russian gunship doing here?

1778
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,870
Oh no, I'm gonna have to fight that later.

1779
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,590
But it looks like our little diversion got their attention.

1780
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,230
Actually, I'm curious how the propelling part will be.

1781
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,930
Who's that?

1782
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:14,310
Oh!

1783
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:17,050
I was looking at the guy behind him.

1784
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,250
Look what is in there.

1785
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:25,570
Behind me!

1786
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:26,730
Whoa!

1787
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:31,070
My controller's rumbly.

1788
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,570
Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed.

1789
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:34,490
Unnoticed?

1790
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:35,830
Snake?

1791
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:37,530
Unnoticed?

1792
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,150
Unnoticed, Snake?

1793
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:47,050
There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.

1794
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,350
You've got to hurry.

1795
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:50,310
Oh well, whose fault is that for not getting me?

1796
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,330
It must be crazy to fly Hind in this kind of weather.

1797
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:53,210
Who's that?

1798
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,030
Oh my god, she sounds so... different.

1799
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:56,610
I haven't introduced you two yet.

1800
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,390
This is Mei Ling.

1801
01:08:58,570 --> 01:08:59,190
Mei Ling!

1802
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:02,610
She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.

1803
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,410
I love you, Mei Ling.

1804
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:06,810
She designed your codec, as well as your soliton radar system.

1805
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,370
Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.

1806
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:10,390
She sounds the same but different, you know?

1807
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:12,870
Nice to meet you, Snake.

1808
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,830
It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.

1809
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,170
Oh, it doesn't sound so bad.

1810
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,110
Actually, it sounds...

1811
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,850
Oh, what's wrong?

1812
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:19,610
Nothing.

1813
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:23,150
I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military.

1814
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,890
Military technology to be so...

1815
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:25,570
So cute.

1816
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:25,990
Cute.

1817
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,870
You're just flattering me.

1818
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,370
No, I'm serious.

1819
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:33,990
Well, I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.

1820
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,010
What's this?

1821
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,830
I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake?

1822
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,270
But I'm surprised.

1823
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:40,770
Cute.

1824
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,170
I didn't think you'd be so frank.

1825
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,650
Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.

1826
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,390
No, my name is Snake.

1827
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,310
It does, doesn't it?

1828
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,250
Well, let's get to know each other better.

1829
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:50,550
But first, can you explain about your soliton radar system?

1830
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,270
Colonel looking away.

1831
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,110
Can you explain about your soliton radar system?

1832
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:52,830
Colonel's blushing.

1833
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:53,130
Colonel's blushing.

1834
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,350
Colonel, he's like...

1835
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:56,810
The bright dot in the middle is you, Snake.

1836
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:57,210
That's me.

1837
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,890
The red dots are your enemies.

1838
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,910
And the blue cone shape represents their field of vision.

1839
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:02,470
Okay.

1840
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,150
Get out of here.

1841
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:03,730
Be careful, Snake.

1842
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:08,790
The Genome Soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.

1843
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,510
Make sure you don't let them see you.

1844
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:11,750
Okay.

1845
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:16,890
First, I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief.

1846
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:17,630
DARPA Chief.

1847
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,050
The diaper chief.

1848
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,590
The same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you.

1849
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,570
Highly developed.

1850
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:23,130
He should appear on your radar system.

1851
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:24,850
Okay.

1852
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,530
Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.

1853
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:27,990
Okay.

1854
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,850
If he's alive, that is.

1855
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:31,530
Oh, he's fine.

1856
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,170
He's okay.

1857
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:34,770
He's fine.

1858
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:35,970
Why did you guys say it like that?

1859
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:39,670
But if you're discovered by an enemy, he won't be able to use it.

1860
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,290
I think we need to upgrade our technology.

1861
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,490
Yes, it gets jammed easily, I'm afraid.

1862
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,750
Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.

1863
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,310
I think we need to upgrade that.

1864
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,890
You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.

1865
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,190
So be careful.

1866
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:51,810
Be careful.

1867
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,130
We'll be monitoring your movement.

1868
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:54,550
Nanomachines.

1869
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,050
Mentor.

1870
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,190
So contact us by codec anytime you want.

1871
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,050
Got it.

1872
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,130
I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.

1873
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,830
Seriously, Snake.

1874
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,730
We're here to back you up.

1875
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,970
So call if you need some information or advice.

1876
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:06,530
Okay.

1877
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,430
I'm also in charge of your mission data.

1878
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:11,090
Contact me if you want me to save your current status.

1879
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:15,550
My frequency is 140.96.

1880
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,230
140.96, everybody.

1881
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:18,990
It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.

1882
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:19,770
Don't forget it.

1883
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:20,970
Don't forget it.

1884
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:23,110
Remember, except for your binoculars, you can't use them.

1885
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:26,330
You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.

1886
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,690
I remember.

1887
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:31,010
First, I'm strip searched by Dr. Naomi here.

1888
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,950
Then all my weapons are taken away.

1889
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,810
What weapons did you have?

1890
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,270
Imagine yourself put in that position.

1891
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,070
140.96.

1892
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:39,950
Maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me.

1893
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:41,930
Hold you to that, doctor.

1894
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:46,790
By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.

1895
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,610
Oh, not in the...

1896
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,450
How did you do that?

1897
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,390
He ate them.

1898
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,110
Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach.

1899
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,170
Am I out of breath?

1900
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:54,410
Cigarette.

1901
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,390
How are those gonna help you?

1902
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:57,410
You never know.

1903
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:58,710
Hey!

1904
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,210
This guy is so dumb!

1905
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:04,650
Oh my God.

1906
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:05,850
He's so dumb.

1907
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,970
If you wanna get in, there's the front door.

1908
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:12,730
It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy.

1909
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:13,190
There's the door!

1910
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:13,770
Which way should we go?

1911
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,250
You can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.

1912
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,610
I'm probably gonna go in the way that I...

1913
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:18,210
What about the airdrill near the door?

1914
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,530
That way.

1915
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,370
Yeah, that one.

1916
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,410
One sentry on the left.

1917
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,610
And one on the right.

1918
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:23,110
Sir?

1919
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,530
But we already have our gun.

1920
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:26,210
We can take these guys out, I think.

1921
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,950
Also, since this is like MGS2, you can hold them up, right?

1922
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:38,190
Oh, but I've been trying to practice how to hold up people, but I'm still not really good at it, so...

1923
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:40,810
I'll do my best.

1924
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:42,790
Pineapples.

1925
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,470
Pineapple, pine...

1926
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,370
There's nothing over here, right?

1927
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,190
I don't remember there being anything over here.

1928
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,350
Um...

1929
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,270
Okay, let's see.

1930
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,220
Uh, I'm assuming the zoom is the same...

1931
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:06,900
Okay, yes.

1932
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,580
And then it's X.

1933
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,680
Okay, there's that guy over there.

1934
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:13,960
Um...

1935
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,300
There's a guy up there.

1936
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,420
Yeah, there's, uh...

1937
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:26,620
Obviously the spotlight's in the middle, but there's a guy over here.

1938
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,300
That's our sleeping buddy!

1939
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:31,500
Oh!

1940
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,440
But there's also the camera here.

1941
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,920
Yes, yes, yes.

1942
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,280
Okay.

1943
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,670
Okay, so A...

1944
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:47,570
And then Z.

1945
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,270
Okay.

1946
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:51,930
We'll get this, we'll get this, you guys.

1947
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,990
Can I run?

1948
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:55,890
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to run, though?

1949
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:56,550
How am I supposed to...

1950
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,810
Oh!

1951
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:56,970
Oh!

1952
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,110
What?!

1953
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:59,610
There's Auto-Abe?!

1954
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,650
Yo, no way!

1955
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,330
Oh, oh, oh, hold on.

1956
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:02,970
Okay, wait.

1957
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,510
My fingers are all messed up right now.

1958
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:04,730
Okay.

1959
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:05,710
I almost had him.

1960
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,070
I could've gotten him.

1961
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:11,710
But if he faints right now, they'll notice I'm here.

1962
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,090
Do you think he's too far away?

1963
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:16,710
Think he's too far?

1964
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:20,270
Can't tell.

1965
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,770
How am I supposed to walk when I have all the...

1966
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:23,870
How am I supposed to do this?

1967
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,030
Okay, hold on.

1968
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:27,650
She's hacking.

1969
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:28,470
Aimbot.

1970
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,610
Let's get this guy.

1971
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:32,890
Never mind.

1972
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:34,490
Let's get him.

1973
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,410
I can't tell if it's too far or not.

1974
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:39,250
It looks way too far, right?

1975
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:40,370
Okay, wait.

1976
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:40,870
Oh, wait.

1977
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,190
Hold on.

1978
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:42,090
There we go.

1979
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:42,310
Okay.

1980
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,150
I'm just getting a feel for things, you guys.

1981
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,350
I'm just getting a feel for things.

1982
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:49,350
Okay.

1983
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,410
So the quick...

1984
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:51,810
Oh, okay.

1985
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:54,790
The quick...

1986
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,050
All this is...

1987
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:56,350
Oh.

1988
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:57,690
Oh, oh.

1989
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:58,730
Oh, interesting.

1990
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,790
Okay, so if I hold...

1991
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:01,870
If I push down...

1992
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,190
I didn't mean to do that.

1993
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:11,170
If I push down, it brings up the menu.

1994
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,350
But if I'm in first person, I can do that.

1995
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,970
Okay.

1996
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,210
Wow.

1997
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,450
It's like not so...

1998
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,650
Or it's...

1999
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:19,990
Okay.

2000
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:20,450
Sorry.

2001
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:21,610
Sorry.

2002
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:23,950
We're learning.

2003
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:24,350
We're learning.

2004
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:24,670
We're learning.

2005
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,110
What is...

2006
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,570
What is crawling?

2007
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,250
Oh, my God.

2008
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:29,690
Nope.

2009
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:30,090
Nope.

2010
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:30,290
Nope.

2011
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:30,390
Nope.

2012
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,210
No, no, no.

2013
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:31,990
Get up, Snake.

2014
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:32,170
Run.

2015
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,350
No, no, no, no.

2016
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:33,910
There's nobody here.

2017
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,110
Snake, we're still learning the controls.

2018
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,510
We can't do this yet.

2019
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:44,500
Oh.

2020
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,000
Wait.

2021
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,140
I can't move in first...

2022
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,140
I can't walk in first person?

2023
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,560
Why did I think I could?

2024
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,200
Unless it's just holding my gun.

2025
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:53,860
No.

2026
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,460
Come back.

2027
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,480
Please.

2028
01:15:58,700 --> 01:15:59,240
Okay.

2029
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,740
Whose footprints are these?

2030
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,860
No one's.

2031
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,300
It's your imagination.

2032
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,460
No one's.

2033
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:10,060
No one's.

2034
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:10,680
No one's.

2035
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,520
Do I have to equip it before I go into first person?

2036
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,120
Okay.

2037
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,980
Good to know.

2038
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,580
Come here, mister.

2039
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,960
I'm gonna get your butt.

2040
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,380
Come on.

2041
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:24,280
Oh, there you are.

2042
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:24,800
Okay.

2043
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,440
Okay.

2044
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,440
I don't think...

2045
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:28,560
Oh.

2046
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:29,440
I did get him.

2047
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,140
I don't have very many bullets left.

2048
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:36,920
And he's down.

2049
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,980
And this is what makes the game a little bit easier because of the first person and stuff, you know?

2050
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:44,780
Come here.

2051
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,380
Do you think I can get him?

2052
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:49,260
Oh.

2053
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,320
I got him.

2054
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:56,150
Go down.

2055
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,630
Psst.

2056
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,190
Come here.

2057
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:58,730
Come here.

2058
01:16:58,730 --> 01:16:59,530
Oh.

2059
01:16:59,530 --> 01:16:59,790
There he goes.

2060
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,780
I will learn.

2061
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,260
Oh, no.

2062
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,200
I got the wrong one.

2063
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,360
A surveillance camera.

2064
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,520
What?

2065
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:19,380
Oh, I can see their... what's it called?

2066
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,480
Um, it's range.

2067
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,960
Is that gun still in here?

2068
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:27,660
Or...

2069
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,240
Oh, yeah.

2070
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:29,640
There we go.

2071
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:29,980
Okay.

2072
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:30,320
Nice.

2073
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,620
A surveillance camera.

2074
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:31,980
Okay.

2075
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,540
That guy...

2076
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:35,320
Go back to sleep.

2077
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,280
Go to sleep, little baby.

2078
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:42,560
Oh.

2079
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,720
Uh.

2080
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:44,860
Uh.

2081
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,040
We'll get him from this side.

2082
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,560
Go to sleep.

2083
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:54,720
Oh.

2084
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,780
I need to equip the gun.

2085
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,120
Go to sleep.

2086
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,900
Go to sleep, little baby.

2087
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,700
Go to sleep.

2088
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,040
Um.

2089
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:04,700
Now, how do I...

2090
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:05,120
A crawl.

2091
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:05,580
Oh.

2092
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:05,940
Okay.

2093
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,860
Crawl is...

2094
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:09,460
This.

2095
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,400
There we go.

2096
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:12,600
Ikuzo.

2097
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,260
I think...

2098
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,660
Did I forget...

2099
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,540
Did I forget anything?

2100
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,200
I don't remember.

2101
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,460
Did I forget...

2102
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,980
It's fine if I forgot some items.

2103
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,340
We got the SOCOM, though.

2104
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,720
So we can perform violence.

2105
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,880
But the M9 has the suppressor.

2106
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,300
Gosh.

2107
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,240
It makes it so easy.

2108
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:35,960
Okay.

2109
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:42,150
Okay.

2110
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:42,850
Hello.

2111
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:45,710
Hello.

2112
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,010
Where's the rat?

2113
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,290
Where's the rat?

2114
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:57,750
Natsukasii.

2115
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:00,630
Wait.

2116
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:01,250
Where's the item?

2117
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:02,630
No way.

2118
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,070
It took away...

2119
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,930
Wasn't there a ration down here?

2120
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:08,990
Violence!

2121
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,150
Thank you.

2122
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,070
Thanks for the download.

2123
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:12,150
Oh.

2124
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,910
They took away my... no rats.

2125
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:18,790
Follow the mice.

2126
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,350
Where are they?

2127
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:22,410
I only have three bullets left.

2128
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:25,330
Maybe we need to be a... Oh, there they are!

2129
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:28,750
Beep beep!

2130
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:29,530
Beep beep!

2131
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,550
Oh, it did it by itself.

2132
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:32,090
Thank you.

2133
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:32,530
Wait!

2134
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:33,310
Yes!

2135
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,150
Master Miller!

2136
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,130
Oh my god!

2137
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:39,850
Master Miller!

2138
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,250
Just... he's in retirement.

2139
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,710
What skills does Kaz have?

2140
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:02,410
I'm actually legitimately... I actually don't know.

2141
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,770
I've never seen Kaz on the floor.

2142
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:11,010
He's always like... Burgers.

2143
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,230
Hahaha!

2144
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,110
Thanks master.

2145
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:25,190
Oh yeah, let's call, uh, let's call Mei Ling.

2146
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,850
The skill of arm regress.

2147
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,730
What is it?

2148
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:34,250
Start and... A?

2149
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,790
A dark side.

2150
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:40,950
Are you sure they're not dangerous?

2151
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:41,250
To ensure the survival of the animals.

2152
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:41,510
Are you sure they're not dangerous?

2153
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,770
To ensure the survival of the animals.

2154
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:41,770
Are you sure they're not dangerous?

2155
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:42,130
To ensure the survival of the animals.

2156
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,630
Follow the mice.

2157
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:53,570
What is it?

2158
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,230
Start plus A.

2159
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,250
Okay.

2160
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:01,530
Oh wait, it's already put in there.

2161
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:02,630
Lucky ass.

2162
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:03,510
Well, we should save anyway.

2163
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,010
Never mind.

2164
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:14,110
Oh wait.

2165
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:18,730
Oh, wait, we're fine.

2166
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:19,990
Just kidding.

2167
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:22,890
New file.

2168
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,090
Yes.

2169
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:27,890
Okay, beep, beep.

2170
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,030
Thanks, Mei Ling.

2171
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,650
Wait, where's my... Um, excuse me.

2172
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:38,470
Where is my... Where is my proverb?

2173
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:43,210
Didn't realize you like this franchise.

2174
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,670
Be cautious about the brain rot.

2175
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:47,450
AP.

2176
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:51,270
AP, it's over for me.

2177
01:21:53,230 --> 01:22:06,220
It's... It's... When did they tell us... Oh yeah.

2178
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,040
When do we learn Nastasha's?

2179
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,360
I don't remember hers actually.

2180
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,080
What was it?

2181
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,600
What was hers?

2182
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,040
Mei Ling sounds different without an accent.

2183
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:19,960
Yeah.

2184
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:21,920
14152?

2185
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,260
This is Nastasha Romanenko.

2186
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,540
A pleasure to work with you, salad snake.

2187
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:32,460
Nastasha!

2188
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,340
You're the nuclear specialist that the colonel mentioned.

2189
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,220
That's me.

2190
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,260
You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.

2191
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,860
I am also a military analyst.

2192
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,300
So sad she never got like a 3D model.

2193
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,780
So I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.

2194
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:44,840
So sad she never got like a 3D model.

2195
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,680
She's so hot.

2196
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:51,240
They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the nuclear emergency search team.

2197
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,340
I was happy to accept.

2198
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,140
She still has her accent, but it's...

2199
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:57,340
We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind.

2200
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:57,700
It's muted.

2201
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,100
It's way less.

2202
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,720
I hope I can help you to stop them.

2203
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,500
It's...

2204
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,100
You're a tough lady.

2205
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,980
You're a tough lady.

2206
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,760
Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon.

2207
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:08,180
The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen.

2208
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,560
And neither can I.

2209
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,700
Yeah, it's much more subdued.

2210
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,840
Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information.

2211
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,840
Thank you, Nastasha.

2212
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:16,760
Hopefully, that'll be enough.

2213
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,420
Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway.

2214
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,320
It's good to work with you, Nastasha.

2215
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,720
Same here, Snake.

2216
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,700
Yeah, yeah, you can hear it there, right?

2217
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,080
Okay, start a button.

2218
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,080
So strange.

2219
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,840
All right, little rats, let's go.

2220
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,100
Let's go, little rats.

2221
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,420
Oh.

2222
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,020
Oh, yes, the water.

2223
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:37,940
Oh, my God.

2224
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:38,940
Oh.

2225
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:40,920
Why is it going down so fast?

2226
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:43,640
Stop.

2227
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,440
It's so messed up.

2228
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:44,820
Oh, my God.

2229
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:47,140
I can't believe I lost health.

2230
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,620
This should be an exit right here.

2231
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,000
Oh, no, it is not.

2232
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:03,620
Interesting.

2233
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,000
Okay.

2234
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,520
Where do they want me to exit then from?

2235
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,200
Hello?

2236
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:08,880
Here?

2237
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:10,060
Varian?

2238
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,520
Aha!

2239
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,100
I should have followed the rat.

2240
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,770
Did that hit him?

2241
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,550
Uh-oh, I only have one bullet left.

2242
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,410
Good night.

2243
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,280
How do I get up?

2244
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:46,680
Shit.

2245
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,160
Okay.

2246
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,440
Start, start.

2247
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,980
Use the elevator to change floors.

2248
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,520
There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there.

2249
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,000
How do I pick up the elevator?

2250
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,320
Pick him up.

2251
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:01,960
Try to find it.

2252
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:03,620
How do I...

2253
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,900
How do I pick him up for the loot?

2254
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:07,740
Yeah.

2255
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,480
Like, if I can check the bodies in two, right?

2256
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,140
It's the same thing?

2257
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:11,700
What do I...

2258
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:12,060
Is it...

2259
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,420
Maybe A?

2260
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,120
A or B?

2261
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,120
Let's try.

2262
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:17,860
A.

2263
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,020
Oh, there we go.

2264
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:20,660
Give me all you got.

2265
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,920
Give me all you got.

2266
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,040
Give me all you got.

2267
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,240
Okay.

2268
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,740
He's got nothing.

2269
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:30,800
Lame-ass.

2270
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,000
Okay.

2271
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,620
Oh, the music in here is so...

2272
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:41,640
Okay.

2273
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,200
Nothing in here.

2274
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:56,050
I should also have my ration equipment, right?

2275
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:56,690
Yeah.

2276
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,210
Let's have...

2277
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,610
That was so close.

2278
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:02,830
I don't know where he goes.

2279
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:09,650
Oh.

2280
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,010
Can I get out of here, please?

2281
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:11,430
Thank you.

2282
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,400
How do I want to take this guy out?

2283
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,580
I don't know.

2284
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,320
I don't know.

2285
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:21,800
Okay.

2286
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:22,580
How do I...

2287
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,060
Okay.

2288
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:23,520
Hold on.

2289
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:24,500
All right.

2290
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,920
If I run up to him, behind him, and then do that...

2291
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:28,720
Oh, no!

2292
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,340
Oh.

2293
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,460
I could still hold it up.

2294
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,020
They don't know I have zero bullets.

2295
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:54,320
Right.

2296
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:55,200
Time to bluff.

2297
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:57,640
Okay.

2298
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,460
Is there anyone...

2299
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,220
I think there's...

2300
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,320
A guy upstairs, right?

2301
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,120
So he'll hear me.

2302
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,200
Oh, man.

2303
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:10,820
Okay.

2304
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:13,620
Okay.

2305
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:13,980
Let's see.

2306
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,040
He comes around.

2307
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:16,980
I'll wait for him.

2308
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:24,480
I'm gonna...

2309
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,000
I'm gonna lose my brain.

2310
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,180
I'm gonna lose my brain.

2311
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:27,700
Please.

2312
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:28,840
Please.

2313
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:29,420
No.

2314
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,060
Please.

2315
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:30,600
Please.

2316
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,040
Go in there, Snake.

2317
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,500
Oh, why?

2318
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,000
Why?

2319
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,260
Why?

2320
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:35,520
Why?

2321
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:35,640
Why?

2322
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:35,660
Why?

2323
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,300
Why do I just let go of the button?

2324
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,900
Why do I...

2325
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,760
Why do I just let go of the button?

2326
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,880
Actually, this works, though.

2327
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,940
Can you just lift up just a tiny bit, Snake?

2328
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,160
They're gonna know.

2329
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,880
They're never gonna stop leaving me alone.

2330
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:11,860
They're never gonna leave me alone.

2331
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,320
You can go.

2332
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:17,460
Did he pull out his?

2333
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:17,720
Now.

2334
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,400
Did he pull out his...

2335
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,460
He pulled out his shield.

2336
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,060
The other guy is still asleep.

2337
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:30,940
That's some strong 180 I.Q., everybody.

2338
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,360
Are their legs okay now?

2339
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,940
That guy's snoring up a storm over here.

2340
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,080
Don't wake him up though, please.

2341
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:46,860
Oh, dang it.

2342
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,300
Oh.

2343
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,100
Please, I have no more guns!

2344
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,200
No more bullets!

2345
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,120
Okay.

2346
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,900
You guys, this is just all so familiar, isn't it?

2347
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,460
Come on.

2348
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,880
Leave me alone.

2349
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,140
Hello?

2350
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:09,920
No more gun.

2351
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,460
Can I still use it though?

2352
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,280
Even if it's empty?

2353
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:14,960
Oh!

2354
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,580
I could still bluff.

2355
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:20,940
Perhaps.

2356
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,720
I could make him lay down.

2357
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,440
Maybe.

2358
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:30,860
Yeah.

2359
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,340
Get out of here, attack team!

2360
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,640
Get out of here!

2361
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:36,020
Okay.

2362
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,300
That guy is the one that patrols over on that side.

2363
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:44,000
Then we are going to have our other friend who walks around this tank, I think is what he does.

2364
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:46,900
Oh, hello.

2365
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,460
They are both on the other side.

2366
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,080
They are both on the right side.

2367
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,420
Where are you?

2368
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,940
There's that...

2369
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,100
Okay.

2370
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,060
Okay.

2371
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,800
If I can...

2372
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,060
Okay.

2373
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:01,260
Let's try this out.

2374
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,260
You

2375
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:12,450
jerk!

2376
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:13,930
Oh.

2377
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,290
Oh, dang.

2378
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:19,930
Security!

2379
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:25,990
Grab him!

2380
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:28,530
Wait.

2381
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:29,150
Oh

2382
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:34,700
my god.

2383
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,240
They are so loud.

2384
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:35,820
You know what?

2385
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:36,360
Let's just kill them.

2386
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,540
Or let them kill me.

2387
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:38,700
It's fine.

2388
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,360
You guys can just kill me.

2389
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,360
In fact, I'll help you.

2390
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,260
Let's restart.

2391
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:52,270
Okay.

2392
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:55,690
It's okay because I didn't even have any bullets.

2393
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,190
Okay.

2394
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,010
We are going to sneak up on him.

2395
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,910
And we are going to get his butt.

2396
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:01,930
We are going to get his butt.

2397
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:03,550
The control.

2398
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:05,090
It's okay.

2399
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,720
One left!

2400
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,760
One left!

2401
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:12,780
Wait.

2402
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:13,400
Only one?

2403
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,900
I had two before.

2404
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,080
I had two before.

2405
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,740
Hey game!

2406
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,240
I had two before.

2407
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:21,440
You know?

2408
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,060
It's not really fair.

2409
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:24,780
I'm just saying.

2410
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,800
If I had taken him down, the other guy would have seen him faint.

2411
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:29,940
If I had taken him down, the other guy would have seen him faint.

2412
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:30,400
Maybe he'll come back.

2413
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:33,240
Let's see.

2414
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,020
Where are you?

2415
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:38,140
Where did he go?

2416
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,500
Where does he walk to?

2417
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:43,640
Oh, there he is.

2418
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,900
It's X to get up.

2419
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,320
Is this about the elevator?

2420
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,120
Thank you.

2421
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:02,700
You guys...

2422
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,020
There we go.

2423
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,140
The other guy is going to come though!

2424
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,180
Uh, shoot.

2425
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:19,480
Um...

2426
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,400
You're supposed to...

2427
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,140
Why didn't you shake down?

2428
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,820
Why didn't you shake your little booties?

2429
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:28,620
Why didn't you shake your little booties and get on the ground?

2430
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:29,960
Why didn't you shake your little booties and get on the ground?

2431
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:39,470
Uh, wait.

2432
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:40,070
Oh, shit.

2433
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,110
Yeah, kill me again.

2434
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:43,530
Actually, just take me out.

2435
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:46,410
You have to be in front of him!

2436
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:47,330
You

2437
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:56,440
have to be in front of him!

2438
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,660
I want him to get on the ground.

2439
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,960
Okay, let's try...

2440
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,440
Well, I was going to kill him.

2441
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,000
But we won't kill him.

2442
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,100
And I won't waste this bullet.

2443
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,320
Maybe we just go upstairs.

2444
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:08,900
You know what?

2445
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:09,980
Maybe we don't even...

2446
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,240
care about these guys.

2447
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:14,420
Or...

2448
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:15,780
Wait, the elevator...

2449
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,680
We gotta go down to get to...

2450
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,700
I need more bullets though.

2451
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,880
We need to go upstairs and kind of loot the place a little bit.

2452
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,080
I don't think you can make them lie down though.

2453
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:24,880
Not in this one?

2454
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:26,600
Maybe not.

2455
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,140
Cause they're supposed to like...

2456
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:29,520
chill there and be like...

2457
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,160
Oh my...

2458
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,940
I can't...

2459
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,640
get used to the get up button.

2460
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:42,300
I seriously cannot.

2461
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,740
Because the A button...

2462
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,320
is so big!

2463
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,420
It's so big my fingers...

2464
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:51,540
just instinctively click it.

2465
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:52,680
It's so...

2466
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,560
Just kill me.

2467
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,600
Dang!

2468
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:02,890
Oh, I almost had you.

2469
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:08,530
Oh, hold on.

2470
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:32,990
There he is!

2471
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:38,580
Radar!

2472
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,060
It's picking up the DARPA chief!

2473
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,400
He's the green dot!

2474
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:42,940
Hurry and rescue him!

2475
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,760
Hurry and rescue him!

2476
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,520
Um...

2477
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,680
Oh, this is first person.

2478
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,020
There's no one over here though.

2479
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,360
There's the guy in here, but we can't go in there.

2480
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,540
Boop boop!

2481
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,920
I know to press the action...

2482
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,560
button, Colonel.

2483
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,300
Pressing Y while...

2484
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,900
holding the...

2485
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,660
A will put down the gun without...

2486
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:07,900
shooting.

2487
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,660
I thought you had to...

2488
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,060
unequip the... Whoa.

2489
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,040
I can't see anything.

2490
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:12,880
Oh, there we go.

2491
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:15,400
I thought you had to unequip it so that it wouldn't...

2492
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,080
It wouldn't shoot.

2493
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,200
What's this?

2494
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,860
It's a sparrow.

2495
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:32,230
...

2496
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:34,010
Sneaky sneaky...

2497
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:35,090
Oh!

2498
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,270
Oh, it's Johnny.

2499
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:40,590
Oh god, why do I have to...

2500
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:40,850
see this?

2501
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:41,990
Ow!

2502
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:42,690
Gross!

2503
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:44,430
Ew, it's so steamy!

2504
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:49,090
Boy oh boy!

2505
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:51,090
I sound like Goofy.

2506
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,190
Boy oh boy!

2507
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,550
That woman is built alright.

2508
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,670
...

2509
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:59,550
Honey my man!

2510
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:03,630
Let's get our bullets.

2511
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:09,010
Yay!

2512
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:13,150
Uh, first person...

2513
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:13,410
down?

2514
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:14,530
Wait.

2515
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:17,230
First person...

2516
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:17,470
down?

2517
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:19,550
Oh.

2518
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:20,870
There's no one in here.

2519
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:26,230
What is that?

2520
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:30,910
Are you playing...

2521
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:32,550
naughty games at work?

2522
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:33,250
Oh, wrong way.

2523
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:33,610
There we go.

2524
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,400
Snake is such a...

2525
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,680
voyeur.

2526
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:42,080
Oh, gross!

2527
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,680
We don't even know if he flushed!

2528
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,220
We definitely know he didn't...

2529
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:47,020
wash his hands.

2530
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,960
Oh, there is a dirty magazine!

2531
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:51,780
Nice.

2532
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:00,620
La la la la la la la.

2533
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,680
Meryl, I'm coming for you.

2534
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,860
Are you still doing sit-ups?

2535
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,640
Like you always do?

2536
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,300
It's weird that it forces...

2537
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:15,780
Oh, hello.

2538
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,760
Forces you into the cutscene.

2539
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,740
There she is.

2540
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:21,880
Merl.

2541
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:30,420
Oh, really?

2542
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:30,660
Really?

2543
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,020
Really, Snake?

2544
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:32,620
Oh my gosh.

2545
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:33,980
Don't look up, Merl.

2546
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:34,900
Don't look up.

2547
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,020
I'm just gonna completely...

2548
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:44,220
forget about what the Colonel said.

2549
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,980
About, uh...

2550
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:49,980
About, um...

2551
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,080
you know, his niece...

2552
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,220
and all of that, you know.

2553
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,860
How does she not see him?

2554
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,440
I know.

2555
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,240
He's just that sneaky.

2556
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:04,370
Shh.

2557
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,120
Hush.

2558
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:18,480
Who's that?

2559
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,600
I'm here to save you.

2560
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,040
You're the DARPA chief.

2561
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,240
Donald Anderson, right?

2562
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:26,120
The diaper chief.

2563
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:29,520
That's my favorite character, you guys!

2564
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,720
You're here to save me, huh?

2565
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,640
What's your outfit?

2566
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,360
Uh... Louis Vuitton.

2567
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,940
I'm the con they sent in here to save your worthless butt.

2568
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,360
Really?

2569
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,520
Greg Eagles.

2570
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,760
It's true.

2571
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,580
You don't look like one of them.

2572
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:49,820
In that case...

2573
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,960
Hurry up and get me out of here.

2574
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,240
Slow down.

2575
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,200
Don't worry.

2576
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,520
First, I want some information about the terrorists.

2577
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,640
The diaper chief in this very cell...

2578
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,180
This guy standing before us...

2579
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,720
Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?

2580
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,660
What are you talking about?

2581
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,160
Just this diaper chief right here.

2582
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,420
The terrorists are threatening the White House.

2583
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:12,440
They say if they don't exceed to their demands, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.

2584
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,640
Oh, LMAO.

2585
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:17,720
Sweet Jesus.

2586
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:29,250
Is it possible?

2587
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:33,010
Well?

2588
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:34,690
It's possible.

2589
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:37,730
They could launch a nuke.

2590
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:38,510
Oh my God.

2591
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:41,750
Whoa!

2592
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:43,890
I'm getting...

2593
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:44,310
Oh my God.

2594
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:45,430
I'm getting...

2595
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:52,450
I'm getting whiplash.

2596
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:53,530
I'm getting motion sick.

2597
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:55,050
I'm getting whiplash.

2598
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:55,930
I'm getting motion sick.

2599
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:56,430
You guys...

2600
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:00,650
We were conducting exercises...

2601
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:00,790
We were conducting exercises...

2602
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:02,650
with a new type of experimental weapon.

2603
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:05,050
A truly historical weapon.

2604
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:05,750
Metal gear.

2605
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,810
Ooh, whee!

2606
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:10,130
With the ability to launch a nuclear attack...

2607
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:11,930
from any place on the face of the Earth.

2608
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,370
Miss Gurley.

2609
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:14,670
Kicked up.

2610
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:20,010
Do we get the real-life picture?

2611
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:21,850
Metal Gear!

2612
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:25,010
Ah, Rex!

2613
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,190
Not with this little guy.

2614
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:39,050
He's so cute!

2615
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:44,630
Oh my god, little Rex.

2616
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:45,090
Ow!

2617
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,310
Oh my god, show the other side.

2618
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,430
Show the laser...

2619
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,710
Ow!

2620
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:56,930
He's little...

2621
01:40:56,930 --> 01:40:57,230
Ow!

2622
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:58,130
He's so cute!

2623
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,970
Guys, my mouth!

2624
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:00,890
Oh my god!

2625
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:04,290
Tiny arms...

2626
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:08,130
Is this Grim from Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy?

2627
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:08,410
Yes!

2628
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:08,950
It is!

2629
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:09,750
You can hear it, right?

2630
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:10,310
Revolution.

2631
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:11,950
Revolution?

2632
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,790
You can hear it a little bit.

2633
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:15,410
It's so funny.

2634
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:19,390
Rex has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

2635
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:20,670
Rex?

2636
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:21,670
Rex?

2637
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:24,630
Little baby.

2638
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,630
Metal Gear Rex.

2639
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:28,230
The codename for the new Metal Gear prototype.

2640
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:33,470
They're probably already finished arming the warhead they plan to use with Rex.

2641
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:35,710
Johnny's just like, shut the hell up, man.

2642
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:36,150
These guys are bros.

2643
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:39,730
They're all experienced in handling and equipping new weapons.

2644
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,670
Maybe you shouldn't...

2645
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:43,010
Shut up in there, will ya?

2646
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,970
Maybe Snake shouldn't be standing in front of the door, you know?

2647
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:49,610
Maybe, like...

2648
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,090
Yeah, whatever.

2649
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:53,910
Yeah, whatever.

2650
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:03,090
Where could he be?

2651
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:05,490
All

2652
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,200
nuclear warheads were equipped with safety measures.

2653
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,960
Some kind of detonation...

2654
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:16,720
What are you doing up there?

2655
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,480
Oh, you mean Pal.

2656
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:20,340
Pal?

2657
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,160
Yes, of course.

2658
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,160
There is a Pal.

2659
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,060
It's not a Pal, though.

2660
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:27,260
It's set up so that you need to input two different passwords in order to launch the device.

2661
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,040
There are two passwords?

2662
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:29,800
Two?

2663
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,600
Baker knows one.

2664
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,180
And I know one.

2665
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,240
Baker?

2666
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,840
The president of Arms Tech?

2667
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:36,680
That's right.

2668
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:37,700
But did you talk?

2669
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,980
Each of us needs to input our password or there can be no launch.

2670
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:42,900
Pal Emmerich?

2671
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:45,200
Icky.

2672
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,080
Don't say that.

2673
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,540
He's no Pal either.

2674
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,280
Look at the membership!

2675
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,280
Thank you so much.

2676
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:51,540
Lithia, thank you.

2677
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,600
They found out my password.

2678
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,760
Oh, you're so weak.

2679
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:55,040
You talk.

2680
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:55,660
You're weak.

2681
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,600
Psycho Mantis can read people's minds.

2682
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,040
You can't resist.

2683
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,580
No, you had the train.

2684
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,040
Psycho Mantis.

2685
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:04,380
One of the members of Foxhound.

2686
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:05,180
Yeah, you know that.

2687
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,680
He has psychic powers.

2688
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:07,720
You just said that.

2689
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:11,960
Password one, two, three.

2690
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:12,300
This is bad.

2691
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:12,760
No!

2692
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,460
It's just a matter of time...

2693
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:15,620
Oh, my God.

2694
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:16,160
She's...

2695
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,420
The sweat?

2696
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:21,020
If they find out Baker's password...

2697
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:21,340
Yes.

2698
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,880
They'll be able to launch a nuke any time.

2699
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:25,900
Any time.

2700
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:29,580
But there is a way to stop the launch.

2701
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,000
What?

2702
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:34,540
The card keys.

2703
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,860
Card keys?

2704
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:37,860
Card keys.

2705
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,440
They were designed by Arms Tech.

2706
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,100
The system developers as an emergency override.

2707
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:47,400
Even without the passwords, you can just insert the card keys and engage the safety system.

2708
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,240
Okay.

2709
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,400
Sounds easy enough.

2710
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:50,860
Right, guys?

2711
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:51,280
Yes.

2712
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:53,660
You can stop the launch.

2713
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,260
Look at her.

2714
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,060
That card key.

2715
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,080
So, where are the card keys?

2716
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:02,680
Baker should have them.

2717
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:04,140
Listen.

2718
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,420
You need three card keys.

2719
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,240
Three card keys.

2720
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,920
There are three different slots to put them in.

2721
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:09,760
Easy peasy.

2722
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:11,620
You need to insert a card into each one of them.

2723
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:12,420
Okay.

2724
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,020
Okay.

2725
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,300
Three card keys.

2726
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,060
Three card keys.

2727
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:17,380
Do you know where they are?

2728
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,500
Do you know where they might be keeping Baker?

2729
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,940
Somewhere in the second floor basement.

2730
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,080
Second floor basement?

2731
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,100
Second floor basement.

2732
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:27,240
I heard the guards say they moved them into an area that has a lot of electronic jamming.

2733
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:27,380
Meryl is pretty.

2734
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,400
She's so pretty.

2735
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,240
Any other clues?

2736
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:30,840
Yes.

2737
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:34,980
They cemented over the entrances, but didn't have enough time to paint them.

2738
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,960
Why don't you look for the areas where the walls are a different color?

2739
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,640
Got it.

2740
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,160
Yippee!

2741
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:42,980
Here.

2742
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:43,660
Take this.

2743
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:44,200
Oh, wow.

2744
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,400
It's my ID card.

2745
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,380
It'll open any level one door.

2746
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,640
Why do you only have a level one security card?

2747
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:51,860
It's called a PAN card.

2748
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,880
That is insane.

2749
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,320
It works together with your body's own electrical field.

2750
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,340
Personal area network, huh?

2751
01:44:59,200 --> 01:44:59,500
Huh?

2752
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:03,040
It transmits data using the salts in your body as a transmission medium.

2753
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:03,660
Wow.

2754
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:07,260
If you approach the door's security devices, they'll read the data stored in the card.

2755
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:07,700
Girl, welcome to membership.

2756
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:08,600
Thank you so much.

2757
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,860
And the doors will open automatically.

2758
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:10,920
Gotcha.

2759
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,800
He's just the DARPA chief after all.

2760
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:13,020
Yeah.

2761
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:14,740
He's not even that big of a...

2762
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:15,000
Okay.

2763
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I'm gonna get you out of here.

2764
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,140
I'm gonna...

2765
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:16,440
Oh, my God.

2766
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,220
This persona is so flowy.

2767
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:17,820
It's so great.

2768
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,160
What is it?

2769
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,060
You haven't heard any other way to disarm the pal, have you?

2770
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,520
From your bosses or anyone?

2771
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,060
No.

2772
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,060
No.

2773
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,840
Are you sure you haven't heard anything?

2774
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:29,580
I just said no.

2775
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:34,300
So, does the White House plan to give in to the terrorist demands?

2776
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,520
That's their problem.

2777
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:35,600
Yeah.

2778
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:36,460
That's not our problem.

2779
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,660
It has nothing to do with my orders.

2780
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:40,300
But what about the Pentagon?

2781
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,140
Pentagon?

2782
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,060
Hmm?

2783
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:43,260
Uh-oh.

2784
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,120
Oh!

2785
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,340
Oh, his tummy!

2786
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:45,980
Oh, my God.

2787
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:46,540
Oh, no.

2788
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,560
Oh, no!

2789
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,180
I'm...

2790
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:50,420
Ow!

2791
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:50,880
Oh, my God.

2792
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:51,540
It's so scary.

2793
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:51,780
Look.

2794
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:53,760
IBS.

2795
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:55,740
He's got tummy issues.

2796
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,320
The toilet's right there.

2797
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,800
Ah!

2798
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,080
Hey.

2799
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,160
What happened?

2800
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,740
Girlie, stop making a scene!

2801
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:10,220
Stop making a scene!

2802
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,060
Oh!

2803
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:14,960
Oh, my God.

2804
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:15,960
Oh, my God!

2805
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:16,200
Oh my god!

2806
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,880
He's really dragging this now.

2807
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:31,330
He's still going.

2808
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:33,850
He's earning that Oscar.

2809
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:38,230
Wait, his eyes turned black?

2810
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:42,110
Yamcha.

2811
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:52,570
Is he gonna grab him and go for a second round?

2812
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:55,430
Huh.

2813
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:56,110
Dead.

2814
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,480
Oh, he just shut his eyes?

2815
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,100
It looked like they went like...

2816
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,920
Like he's wearing sclera lenses.

2817
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,440
Great observation, Snake.

2818
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:16,380
Huh.

2819
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:17,340
Dead.

2820
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,060
Really?

2821
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:26,060
No!

2822
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,540
Colonel, are you hiding something from me?

2823
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:31,040
No.

2824
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,560
No, Snake.

2825
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,020
Absolutely not.

2826
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:37,700
This counter-terrorist op is security level red.

2827
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:41,820
You'll need the highest security clearance to learn the real story.

2828
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:48,520
Then you just told me that you were hiding something and I have to play the game to unlock it.

2829
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:51,420
I told you, the secretary of defense is in operational control.

2830
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,580
I'm just here as your support.

2831
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:57,980
Snake, we don't have time to do this.

2832
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,580
Yeah.

2833
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,920
What do you mean the real story?

2834
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,560
What do you mean by that?

2835
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:03,920
You mean it wasn't a heart attack.

2836
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,980
Why would you say the real story?

2837
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,980
The real story is you just had a heart attack, right?

2838
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:09,640
That's all.

2839
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,560
Oh, uh...

2840
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:13,480
This way.

2841
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:16,540
Thank you!

2842
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,880
Oh, I hear her getting zipped up.

2843
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,420
Oh, sorry.

2844
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,300
How you doing down there?

2845
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,860
Oh, there she goes!

2846
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,160
Oh!

2847
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:32,060
Oh!

2848
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,260
Pretty suspicious.

2849
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:35,480
She's waiting for me.

2850
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,480
Oh my gosh.

2851
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:37,940
Sorry, I really...

2852
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:39,960
Thank you!

2853
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,620
Hope that you read this portable...

2854
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,100
MGS portable ops quote.

2855
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,280
You've given me a real reason to fight.

2856
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,380
Thank you.

2857
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,340
X is to crouch.

2858
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,380
X is to crouch.

2859
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:56,220
X is to crouch.

2860
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,000
Y is to fight.

2861
01:48:58,340 --> 01:48:59,940
X is to crouch.

2862
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,100
Y is action.

2863
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:03,960
X is to crouch.

2864
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:04,760
X is to crouch.

2865
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:07,600
X is to crouch.

2866
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,520
B is to fight.

2867
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:11,580
X is to crouch.

2868
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,320
And B is to fight.

2869
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,320
X is to crouch.

2870
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,160
And B is to fight.

2871
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:20,360
And don't click the big A unless you mean it.

2872
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:21,340
Okay.

2873
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:24,340
Hmm...

2874
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:28,750
Fight!

2875
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:36,590
Actually, I was told to try something in this next part.

2876
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:36,830
Actually, I was told to try something in this next part.

2877
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:36,910
Actually, I was told to try something in this next part.

2878
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:38,450
I want to kind of try it out.

2879
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:39,570
Just move!

2880
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:44,650
So you killed the chief, you bastard!

2881
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:45,530
No, it wasn't me!

2882
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:47,930
It was IBS.

2883
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:49,010
It's really serious.

2884
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,230
It's plaguing the nation.

2885
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:51,450
No, you're not.

2886
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:53,870
Don't move!

2887
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:56,630
No, I'm solid.

2888
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:00,470
Is this the first time you ever pointed a gun at a person?

2889
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:01,830
Your hands are shaking.

2890
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:03,110
Your hands are shaking.

2891
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:06,930
Got your nose!

2892
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,310
Where did that come from?

2893
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:19,950
Can you shoot me, rookie?

2894
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:22,150
I've got rookie's eyes.

2895
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:23,970
I mean, she's got rookie's eyes.

2896
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:24,510
Liar.

2897
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:25,890
Your eyes wander.

2898
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,690
There's no confidence in them.

2899
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:28,910
The eyes of a rookie.

2900
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,190
You're not a person, have you?

2901
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:33,270
You talk too much.

2902
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:35,470
You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.

2903
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:37,230
I told you, I'm no rookie.

2904
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:38,970
Oh no!

2905
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:40,410
You're not one of them, are you?

2906
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:42,630
Open that door.

2907
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:43,850
Oh, Johnny.

2908
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:48,290
So we can get the hell out of here.

2909
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:49,190
Looks like you'll be a little delayed.

2910
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:51,470
Foxhound!

2911
01:50:51,690 --> 01:50:52,190
What are you doing?

2912
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:53,270
Don't think!

2913
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:53,830
Shoot!

2914
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:01,640
Oh, you know what?

2915
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:02,080
Never mind.

2916
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:02,960
It didn't work at all.

2917
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:04,500
What I was told to do?

2918
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:06,020
Didn't work at all.

2919
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:06,980
Well, maybe if I...

2920
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,040
Anyway.

2921
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:11,140
Shoot.

2922
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:11,740
How do I shoot?

2923
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:18,070
Why aren't you shooting at me?

2924
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:20,950
Why aren't you shooting at all?

2925
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:25,130
Shoot!

2926
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:27,830
Don't talk to me like a rookie!

2927
01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:29,450
I'm telling you...

2928
01:51:29,450 --> 01:51:29,970
Shoot!

2929
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:30,150
Shoot!

2930
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:31,450
No!

2931
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:34,470
Oh,

2932
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:39,450
gosh.

2933
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:40,030
Dang it.

2934
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:41,110
They did it to me again.

2935
01:51:42,410 --> 01:51:43,070
Oh my god.

2936
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:43,450
Hold on.

2937
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:44,210
I need to...

2938
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:46,710
Oh, gosh.

2939
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:47,710
It's so...

2940
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:48,950
Oh my god.

2941
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:49,150
No!

2942
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:50,970
Oh, I'm out!

2943
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:51,810
No way.

2944
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:52,330
What?

2945
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:54,750
Uh...

2946
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:57,390
Girlie, you need to handle this by yourself.

2947
01:51:57,890 --> 01:51:58,590
I'm sorry.

2948
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:59,830
I'm out of bullets.

2949
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:01,150
Oh, thank you.

2950
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:02,890
Oh, there they are.

2951
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:03,470
Never mind.

2952
01:52:03,610 --> 01:52:04,010
I got it.

2953
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:04,030
I got them.

2954
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:04,530
We're back.

2955
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:05,990
We're back, everybody.

2956
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:07,230
Oh.

2957
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:10,810
Oh.

2958
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:11,170
Two.

2959
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:11,590
Two.

2960
01:52:11,630 --> 01:52:11,810
Two.

2961
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:12,330
Oh.

2962
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:13,290
Good job, girlie.

2963
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:20,250
Oh.

2964
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:20,830
Oh, shoot.

2965
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:21,350
Oh.

2966
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:23,950
Where did the grenade go?

2967
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:24,670
Oh.

2968
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:26,930
It

2969
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:33,230
doesn't help when the...

2970
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:35,590
It kind of like... What's the word?

2971
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:37,310
It kind of auto-aims.

2972
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:39,090
So, even if I go for the head, it like...

2973
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:39,910
aims down.

2974
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:40,510
You see that?

2975
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:43,850
So, it's... I don't know if there's a way to turn that off.

2976
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:47,590
You did it, Merle.

2977
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:48,450
You did it, Merle.

2978
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:52,010
Yeah, I saw it move.

2979
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:53,130
Yeah, so like...

2980
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:58,010
If I'm trying to aim, it tries to like move down a little.

2981
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:00,010
It makes it more difficult.

2982
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:02,210
It makes it more difficult.

2983
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:03,570
Yes, girl!

2984
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:07,670
Auto-miss.

2985
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:08,290
Auto-miss.

2986
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:08,850
Auto-miss.

2987
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:12,950
Oh!

2988
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:13,270
Oh!

2989
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:13,310
Please!

2990
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:16,670
Please!

2991
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:19,390
Please!

2992
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,780
Oh, just kidding!

2993
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,040
You fool!

2994
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,680
You've killed him!

2995
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:32,040
I'm sorry, sir.

2996
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:32,560
I'm sorry, sir.

2997
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:37,280
His mental shielding was very strong.

2998
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:40,000
I could not dive into his mind.

2999
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,780
Oh my god, he sounds so awesome.

3000
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:45,380
You fool!

3001
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,300
Who did they kill?

3002
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,660
Now we'll never get that detonation code.

3003
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:52,380
Oh, wait.

3004
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,260
What?

3005
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,640
Boss, I have a good idea.

3006
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,220
What?

3007
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,360
It was Baker.

3008
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:13,440
Ah!

3009
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:15,820
Whoa, what am I doing?

3010
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,900
Oh my god, look at her go.

3011
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:19,700
Yeah!

3012
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:20,200
Oh!

3013
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:20,700
Whoa!

3014
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:21,720
Go stay!

3015
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,600
Oh, yeah!

3016
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:25,460
Whoa!

3017
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:32,890
Dodged every single one.

3018
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:35,950
Like a true champion.

3019
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:41,510
Doesn't she pose there in the original?

3020
01:54:41,650 --> 01:54:42,950
Doesn't she like kind of...

3021
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:44,330
Psycho Mantis!

3022
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,370
Good girl.

3023
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,430
Thank you.

3024
01:54:57,930 --> 01:54:59,370
Just like that.

3025
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:01,110
Are you saying that to me or Snake?

3026
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:03,810
I mean, wait.

3027
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:05,470
Are you saying that to Meryl or Snake?

3028
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:07,750
Not me, sorry.

3029
01:55:08,050 --> 01:55:08,810
Whew, got a little...

3030
01:55:09,930 --> 01:55:10,850
A little...

3031
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:12,190
You know.

3032
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:19,310
Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.

3033
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:22,130
Naomi, I'm going kind of crazy.

3034
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:22,690
No, Snake.

3035
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,150
The nanomachines are functional properly.

3036
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:25,670
So what was it?

3037
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:26,550
Self-insert caught.

3038
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:30,150
It must have been psychometric interference coming from Psycho Mantis.

3039
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:31,430
Fox sounds psychic.

3040
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:34,030
Think of it as a mental feedback loop.

3041
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:35,310
So...

3042
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:36,790
That was Mantis.

3043
01:55:37,050 --> 01:55:39,490
I would say that that scene...

3044
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:44,750
It doesn't spoil, but it does...

3045
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,910
Oh, I'm bleeding out.

3046
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:51,090
Snake, there we go.

3047
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:52,450
There you go.

3048
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:53,710
Stop bleeding!

3049
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:54,670
Stop!

3050
01:55:55,090 --> 01:55:56,170
You're getting...

3051
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:57,850
You're messing up the floor!

3052
01:55:59,470 --> 01:56:00,290
We're good?

3053
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:01,990
Okay.

3054
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:03,850
Uh...

3055
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:05,290
Oh, they're all gone even.

3056
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:08,250
Well, almost.

3057
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:12,670
Anything under here?

3058
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:13,310
I can't remember.

3059
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:16,030
Nope.

3060
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:21,530
But there is stuff in here.

3061
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:24,510
That we saw in the pot.

3062
01:56:24,790 --> 01:56:25,950
Wait, is there anything in here?

3063
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:28,350
Ahaha!

3064
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:31,010
Very good!

3065
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:33,470
Very good!

3066
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:38,530
Hacking...

3067
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:41,750
What is...

3068
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:44,530
Is that the nuclear warheads building?

3069
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:45,770
No.

3070
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:47,570
Oh no, this is the first...

3071
01:56:47,690 --> 01:56:48,010
Okay, wait.

3072
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:49,750
Because that looks like the tank.

3073
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:51,330
And then...

3074
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:53,190
Okay, no, this is just the building that we're in.

3075
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:54,430
Oh, I see it.

3076
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:55,810
VR missions?

3077
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:58,610
No, I think that top one is the floor we were just at.

3078
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:00,150
The floor you sneak into.

3079
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:01,750
And then the second...

3080
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:02,350
Right?

3081
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:04,570
But there's no tank on this floor.

3082
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,090
Huh, I don't know.

3083
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,940
Actually, I don't think there is.

3084
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:16,920
What's this one?

3085
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:17,220
Six.

3086
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:24,760
Wait, what is this?

3087
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,400
Oh!

3088
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:29,100
Come on, snake.

3089
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,920
Here, let me...

3090
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:31,200
Reangle.

3091
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:32,220
Re...

3092
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:34,160
Readjust.

3093
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,800
Okay, there we go.

3094
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:37,040
Ah!

3095
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:39,180
Unequipped the gun!

3096
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,860
Unequipped the gun, Mint!

3097
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:47,310
X is for shooting!

3098
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:54,950
I mean, no!

3099
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:56,250
X is for crawling!

3100
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:07,650
Oh my god...

3101
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:12,210
X is for crawling!

3102
01:58:12,690 --> 01:58:14,650
P is for fight!

3103
01:58:19,730 --> 01:58:21,190
There's nothing under the desk, is there?

3104
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:22,470
Actually, I didn't think about it.

3105
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:26,990
X is for crawling!

3106
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:28,830
A is to shoot!

3107
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,990
A is to shoot!

3108
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,730
X is to crawl!

3109
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:34,690
A is to shoot!

3110
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:36,470
And you shoot good!

3111
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:39,670
Unequipped if you don't wanna waste your bullet!

3112
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:41,810
Unequipped if you don't wanna waste your bullet!

3113
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,420
I'm gonna check under the desk real quick.

3114
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:55,880
Oh!

3115
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:57,360
What the?

3116
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:01,900
Oh, I was like, what is that spinning thing on the radar?

3117
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:03,640
But it's this thingy.

3118
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,200
That's so funny.

3119
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:08,160
Nothing.

3120
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:08,720
Okay.

3121
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,920
Let's get out of here.

3122
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:13,160
So now we...

3123
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,080
Go fight.

3124
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,040
Aww.

3125
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:19,780
Now we go fight.

3126
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:21,620
Well, first we go...

3127
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:22,300
Explode.

3128
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:24,780
Beep!

3129
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:25,920
Beep!

3130
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:39,150
I remember some of the guard choke-out noises in this game being particularly over the top and silly if you want a good laugh.

3131
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:41,590
Chris, thank you.

3132
01:59:41,690 --> 01:59:42,750
Not back-sitting at all.

3133
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:44,690
I'm letting you know, I'm trying.

3134
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:47,030
I'm so bad at getting the guy sometimes.

3135
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:48,370
Not sometimes.

3136
01:59:48,630 --> 01:59:49,730
Like, almost all the time.

3137
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:50,610
But, you know.

3138
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:58,170
Which floors cave in?

3139
01:59:59,390 --> 01:59:59,790
Let's...

3140
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:02,110
Start A.

3141
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:04,610
Um...

3142
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:08,450
What is it, Snake?

3143
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:09,190
Hey!

3144
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:11,850
I'm just saving for no big reason.

3145
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:13,970
Not that I think I'm gonna...

3146
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:18,470
Why can't I be like riding and do a little cart flip...

3147
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:19,910
cartwheel over it, you know?

3148
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:21,470
Thank you.

3149
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:25,810
Shakespeare?

3150
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:32,670
First they take your accent and now you're quoting a western guy?

3151
02:00:35,650 --> 02:00:37,810
That goes for items too.

3152
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:40,150
Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry.

3153
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:41,670
Be careful, Snake.

3154
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:43,330
I hate that one.

3155
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:44,930
I'm not gonna listen.

3156
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:50,160
I should...

3157
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:57,100
I feel like I should be calling Kodek more because I don't know how many things are different but also it's fun to talk to them, right?

3158
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:57,780
Try!

3159
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,180
He's telling me I'm dumb!

3160
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:05,380
If things are getting too complicated try to simplify your thoughts.

3161
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:08,000
You can also try calling Campbell for advice.

3162
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,080
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

3163
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:09,560
Thank you!

3164
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,220
Thank you so much!

3165
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:14,260
Nastasha, what do you have to say?

3166
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:18,900
They were conducting exercises with this new Metal Gear prototype?

3167
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,300
Is that what the DARPA chief said?

3168
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:22,200
Yeah, it is.

3169
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:23,460
What the hell?

3170
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:25,820
What the hell?

3171
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:32,460
I heard it was some kind of walking tank that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain.

3172
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:35,260
Mountains, deserts, swamps, wherever.

3173
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:35,940
Wherever!

3174
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:36,900
Wherever!

3175
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:42,080
I'll be here and you'll be near!

3176
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:44,440
But what about the PAL system that the DARPA chief mentioned?

3177
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:51,480
It is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent the missile from being armed or launched.

3178
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:57,280
Usually a secret detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the missile.

3179
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:02,040
According to the chief, there are two codes and the terrorists already know one of them.

3180
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:03,120
The other code.

3181
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,960
If the terrorists find out that one too...

3182
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:06,400
Do they though?

3183
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:07,940
Because he's dead.

3184
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:09,680
I gotta hurry and rescue President Baker.

3185
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:10,920
Do they know?

3186
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:13,180
Because one of them is dead.

3187
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:14,920
Okay.

3188
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:17,200
I don't remember.

3189
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,400
Let's try down here.

3190
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:18,960
Run!

3191
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:21,560
Three...

3192
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,520
Is this a trap?

3193
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:37,060
Wow!

3194
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:41,140
That actually makes your health go down way faster than it did before.

3195
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,980
Is this the one I was looking for?

3196
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:48,620
Well, no.

3197
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,540
No, it's not because we need the C4.

3198
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:51,540
Right?

3199
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:52,660
You know what?

3200
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,540
I'm just gonna crawl anyway.

3201
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,300
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

3202
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,940
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl.

3203
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:00,520
Crawl, crawl.

3204
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,640
Oh, don't get up, Snake.

3205
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:03,880
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

3206
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,620
Just in case.

3207
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:06,820
I don't think it is though.

3208
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:09,240
Oh, I think we're good.

3209
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:17,830
Am I gonna regret this later?

3210
02:03:20,550 --> 02:03:22,550
More C4!

3211
02:03:23,450 --> 02:03:24,610
More C4!

3212
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:25,430
Nice.

3213
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:27,550
Wait, there's so much C4.

3214
02:03:30,670 --> 02:03:33,370
I think we...

3215
02:03:35,350 --> 02:03:36,510
Oopsie.

3216
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:41,690
Oopsie.

3217
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:42,370
Run!

3218
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:45,670
I thought that was a hole.

3219
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:47,110
One.

3220
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:48,590
Grenades?

3221
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:54,830
Is this one a trap?

3222
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:00,290
Is this one a trap?

3223
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,070
Oh, doh, doh, doh, doh.

3224
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:03,950
Oh.

3225
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:07,090
Is this one a trap?

3226
02:04:09,330 --> 02:04:10,870
It says no smoking.

3227
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:14,470
I can't...

3228
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:14,790
Wait.

3229
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:17,210
Why is she paranoid?

3230
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:20,250
Because sometimes there's traps.

3231
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:22,150
Wait, that's two.

3232
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:23,950
Wait, did that say Famas?

3233
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:24,950
Oh!

3234
02:04:26,190 --> 02:04:27,630
Guess we know where to get the Famas.

3235
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:29,570
Wait, are they all labeled?

3236
02:04:29,650 --> 02:04:30,150
That's so cute.

3237
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:33,290
Grenade.

3238
02:04:34,830 --> 02:04:36,130
Okay, does this one...

3239
02:04:38,450 --> 02:04:38,770
PSG?

3240
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:42,790
Were they C4?

3241
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:44,450
Were they labeled...

3242
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:46,030
What is that one?

3243
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:46,390
Nikita?

3244
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:48,390
Were they labeled in the first game too?

3245
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:49,350
I just never noticed.

3246
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:50,610
Nikita.

3247
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:51,510
Oh, cool.

3248
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:52,910
How nice of them.

3249
02:04:54,330 --> 02:04:56,660
Now, I'm pretty sure this one...

3250
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:58,190
Falls.

3251
02:04:59,450 --> 02:04:59,690
Ugh!

3252
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:01,010
Ah!

3253
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:06,370
Run, Snake, run!

3254
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:07,950
Okay.

3255
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:09,070
No.

3256
02:05:09,670 --> 02:05:10,330
Run!

3257
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:11,970
Okay.

3258
02:05:13,690 --> 02:05:16,570
The place to blow it up is...

3259
02:05:16,570 --> 02:05:18,090
Step back a little bit.

3260
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:19,610
Oh!

3261
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:24,600
Wait, is there just the door?

3262
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:28,580
Beep, beep.

3263
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:29,580
What's this one?

3264
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:31,320
Two.

3265
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,300
Oh wait, I don't know where it is then.

3266
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:33,900
In this one, right?

3267
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:38,260
It doesn't...

3268
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:39,160
Oh!

3269
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:39,560
There!

3270
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,260
It does look like a different color.

3271
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:41,860
Just kidding.

3272
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:43,020
Okay, C4.

3273
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:44,520
How to use.

3274
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:47,520
Press A button to set.

3275
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:48,680
B button...

3276
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:49,820
Detonate.

3277
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:00,940
Easy.

3278
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:03,680
How do I do the book?

3279
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,860
Adult-oriented material.

3280
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:09,520
Full of girly photos and interesting columns.

3281
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:11,160
Interesting.

3282
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,360
I'm running around with my book.

3283
02:06:24,190 --> 02:06:25,670
I like the music here.

3284
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:29,390
Okay.

3285
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:32,550
Whoa!

3286
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:34,990
There we go.

3287
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:37,710
Didn't have time to paint it, eh?

3288
02:06:38,450 --> 02:06:39,830
What were you going to paint it anyway?

3289
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:42,150
Concrete color?

3290
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:44,190
How do you...

3291
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:44,950
How do you paint it?

3292
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:48,370
Wait, hold on.

3293
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:48,990
Let me make sure.

3294
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:49,690
Set to A.

3295
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:50,410
Okay, A to set.

3296
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:55,290
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3297
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:57,730
Wait.

3298
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:00,950
Concrete gray.

3299
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:03,850
Um?

3300
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:09,790
And then those two.

3301
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:14,570
A to set.

3302
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:16,270
This is Ocelot.

3303
02:07:22,910 --> 02:07:23,750
Oh my gosh!

3304
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:24,390
Oh!

3305
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:25,150
He looks...

3306
02:07:25,150 --> 02:07:27,450
He looks kind of naked in this...

3307
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:28,370
in this position.

3308
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:37,170
He looks a little...

3309
02:07:37,170 --> 02:07:37,890
Oh, there we go.

3310
02:07:37,890 --> 02:07:38,390
Oh!

3311
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:40,330
Wait.

3312
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:43,190
Why is his jacket, like, over top his body?

3313
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:45,990
Were you cold, President Baker?

3314
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:47,010
Were you cold?

3315
02:07:47,390 --> 02:07:48,790
Did they give you a...

3316
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:51,530
a little jacket to help you...

3317
02:07:54,430 --> 02:07:56,930
to help you, um, stay warm?

3318
02:07:58,770 --> 02:07:59,450
Aww.

3319
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:02,530
Actually, that's even...

3320
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:04,470
His arm sleeves are like...

3321
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:05,910
They're flapping everywhere.

3322
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:07,670
Everywhere there, it's more of a liability.

3323
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:09,810
Cause it's gonna, like...

3324
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:10,990
What if those...

3325
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:12,250
What if the breeze...

3326
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:12,710
Oh my god.

3327
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:14,410
They're gonna touch the wires!

3328
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:16,730
It is Alaska.

3329
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,490
You're right.

3330
02:08:17,570 --> 02:08:17,990
You're right.

3331
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:21,690
You're right.

3332
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:23,270
Okay.

3333
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:23,710
Um...

3334
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:25,270
I'm gonna call real quick.

3335
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:25,910
We're gonna save.

3336
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:27,670
Okay.

3337
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:28,930
Ocelot time, baby.

3338
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:33,250
Snake, you can't use your radar.

3339
02:08:33,350 --> 02:08:33,950
Yeah, I know.

3340
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:34,350
Oh.

3341
02:08:36,110 --> 02:08:37,110
Don't worry about it.

3342
02:08:38,190 --> 02:08:38,930
New file.

3343
02:08:39,650 --> 02:08:40,050
Yes.

3344
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:42,030
Ba-ding!

3345
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:42,830
Okay.

3346
02:08:43,410 --> 02:08:43,810
Alright.

3347
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:46,570
Be careful, Snake.

3348
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:47,470
Thanks, Meiling.

3349
02:08:48,090 --> 02:08:49,590
Wait, I'm gonna go get those grenades.

3350
02:08:49,710 --> 02:08:51,390
I don't think I need them right now, but...

3351
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:52,230
Um, you know what?

3352
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:53,050
I will go get them.

3353
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:56,230
Just a half.

3354
02:08:58,010 --> 02:08:58,410
Tum!

3355
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:04,030
As Shakespeare said, you can't use the radar.

3356
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:05,770
What if this is what...

3357
02:09:05,910 --> 02:09:06,350
That's what he meant, though.

3358
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:07,070
As in like...

3359
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:08,450
You can't get everything you want.

3360
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:11,550
You can't always get...

3361
02:09:11,550 --> 02:09:13,190
What you want.

3362
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:14,730
Okay.

3363
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:15,410
I guess we're fine.

3364
02:09:17,290 --> 02:09:18,390
And it was...

3365
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:19,970
This one too, right?

3366
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:22,310
I'm so calm.

3367
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:25,530
And, uh...

3368
02:09:25,530 --> 02:09:26,750
I think we're safe.

3369
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:27,870
I think we're safe.

3370
02:09:29,610 --> 02:09:30,170
Right?

3371
02:09:30,170 --> 02:09:31,190
I'm so scared.

3372
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:37,230
Lots of so calm bullets.

3373
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:39,010
Very good.

3374
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:39,590
Okay, cool.

3375
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:40,470
Perfect.

3376
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:45,230
The first person makes it easier...

3377
02:09:45,230 --> 02:09:45,970
compared to the original?

3378
02:09:46,170 --> 02:09:46,810
Oh, yeah.

3379
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:47,730
It really does.

3380
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:51,370
I think it's just...

3381
02:09:51,370 --> 02:09:53,230
For me, the controller is the more...

3382
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:54,110
difficult thing.

3383
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:55,490
Well, actually...

3384
02:09:57,190 --> 02:09:57,670
Um...

3385
02:09:58,210 --> 02:10:00,850
The easiest way that I've played the game...

3386
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:02,990
Well, Metal Gear Solid 1...

3387
02:10:04,010 --> 02:10:04,810
I've done...

3388
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:05,730
my best...

3389
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:09,290
Like, my best performance...

3390
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:10,650
Playing the Switch version.

3391
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:12,630
Which is absolutely wild.

3392
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:13,690
I think.

3393
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:15,190
Um...

3394
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:17,030
But, I don't know.

3395
02:10:17,610 --> 02:10:20,010
I don't know why it was so easy for me.

3396
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:21,190
On a DDR mat.

3397
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:25,430
You'll get used to it.

3398
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:26,030
Yeah, yeah.

3399
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:26,930
I will, uh...

3400
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:28,870
I will practice with it...

3401
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:29,490
some more and stuff.

3402
02:10:29,650 --> 02:10:31,010
I gotta get used to, like, the...

3403
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:32,890
The first...

3404
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:34,930
person being here, and then...

3405
02:10:36,210 --> 02:10:36,650
Okay.

3406
02:10:36,730 --> 02:10:37,730
We don't need to crouch in this.

3407
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:40,890
And we don't need to kick-fight.

3408
02:10:41,110 --> 02:10:41,890
We just gotta...

3409
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:43,770
We just gotta shoot.

3410
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:47,090
Hopefully, we can actually shoot him in the head, though.

3411
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:51,130
Oh my god.

3412
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:52,250
Your sleeves!

3413
02:10:52,450 --> 02:10:52,930
Be careful!

3414
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:56,910
Oh my god.

3415
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:57,930
He's alive.

3416
02:10:58,830 --> 02:10:59,410
Yep.

3417
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:02,110
Astute observation, Snake.

3418
02:11:02,670 --> 02:11:05,270
You're the arms tech president, Kenneth Baker, right?

3419
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:08,470
President Baker.

3420
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:08,950
Don't worry.

3421
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,430
I'm here to save you.

3422
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:13,110
No!

3423
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:15,450
Don't touch it!

3424
02:11:17,490 --> 02:11:18,070
Well,

3425
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:23,550
you're the one who was coughing like crazy, mister.

3426
02:11:24,430 --> 02:11:25,010
C4!

3427
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:26,990
C4!

3428
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:31,410
Your cough...

3429
02:11:31,410 --> 02:11:32,510
My

3430
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:50,110
controller's going crazy.

3431
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:50,370
Right.

3432
02:11:51,190 --> 02:11:54,870
Touch that wire and the C4 will blow up the log of the old man.

3433
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:56,030
Oh my god!

3434
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:59,250
So you're the one that the boss keeps talking about.

3435
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:00,130
Look at the way he's standing.

3436
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,070
He's so sassy.

3437
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:04,230
And you.

3438
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:05,030
And you.

3439
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:08,010
Special Operations Foxhound.

3440
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:11,630
Revolver.

3441
02:12:12,670 --> 02:12:13,350
Yes!

3442
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:14,550
Keep going, kid!

3443
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:15,350
Keep going!

3444
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:16,270
Yes!

3445
02:12:17,710 --> 02:12:18,410
Dramatic pause!

3446
02:12:19,730 --> 02:12:20,070
Yes!

3447
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:21,890
Oh my god.

3448
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:22,210
Okay.

3449
02:12:22,290 --> 02:12:22,630
Yes.

3450
02:12:22,690 --> 02:12:23,230
Yes.

3451
02:12:23,290 --> 02:12:23,970
Don't stop.

3452
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:25,890
Arcelor.

3453
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:26,450
Yes!

3454
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:29,790
Oh yes!

3455
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:30,470
Keep it up!

3456
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:35,370
Oh my god.

3457
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:36,230
He's so awesome!

3458
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:37,990
Oh my god.

3459
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:37,990
He's so awesome!

3460
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:39,670
I've been waiting for you, Solid Snake.

3461
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:41,450
Oh, I bet you have!

3462
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:45,330
Now we'll see if the man can live up to the legend.

3463
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:53,540
Shadashaska!

3464
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:05,120
Don't...

3465
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:08,620
This is the greatest handgun ever made.

3466
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,300
The Colt Single Action Army.

3467
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:16,000
Six bullets.

3468
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:17,060
Six bullets?

3469
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:19,260
More than enough to kill anything that moves.

3470
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:19,980
Yeah!

3471
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:21,240
He said the thing!

3472
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:29,900
Stares at him.

3473
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:32,220
Just kind of like, why are you putting your gun away, you idiot?

3474
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:33,600
Don't let your guard down!

3475
02:13:33,740 --> 02:13:34,120
What do you mean?

3476
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:37,720
Now I'll show you why they call me Revolver.

3477
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:40,820
Revolver.

3478
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,680
Yeah, Ocelot!

3479
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:48,460
Draw!

3480
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:49,440
Yeah!

3481
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:53,420
Okay.

3482
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:57,660
How to do this with first person?

3483
02:13:58,300 --> 02:13:59,120
Where is he?

3484
02:13:59,300 --> 02:13:59,600
Oh!

3485
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:01,020
Hold on!

3486
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:01,540
Let me draw!

3487
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:02,060
Let me draw!

3488
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:04,220
Where are you?

3489
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:05,040
Where are you anyway?

3490
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:05,500
Oh!

3491
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:06,100
Oh!

3492
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:06,800
Oh!

3493
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:09,580
Hello?

3494
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:17,480
Oh, he's reloading?

3495
02:14:17,660 --> 02:14:18,240
I'm alive!

3496
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:20,560
No!

3497
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:21,460
No!

3498
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:22,720
No, Ocelot!

3499
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:23,400
This is too easy!

3500
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:29,280
No way!

3501
02:14:35,590 --> 02:14:36,110
Hmm...

3502
02:14:36,110 --> 02:14:37,590
You're pretty good.

3503
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:41,870
Just what I'd expect from the man with the same code as the boss.

3504
02:14:42,910 --> 02:14:46,010
It's been a long time since I had such a good fight.

3505
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,950
That was a good fight.

3506
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:47,670
You're so right.

3507
02:14:47,670 --> 02:14:48,970
I'm just getting warmed up.

3508
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:49,690
Ah!

3509
02:14:51,190 --> 02:14:51,870
Ah!

3510
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:59,170
This is... That is actually one of the bigger criticisms of this game.

3511
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:02,590
Is that the boss fights tend to be too easy because of... Watch!

3512
02:15:03,950 --> 02:15:05,310
My hand!

3513
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:06,730
Ah!

3514
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:08,110
Ah!

3515
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:17,130
Poor President Baker is just like...

3516
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:18,310
Oh, God!

3517
02:15:20,650 --> 02:15:21,250
Ah!

3518
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:24,130
Ah!

3519
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:24,750
Ah!

3520
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:28,270
That's a cool shot.

3521
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:35,690
Speedrunning the fight with Ocelot for real.

3522
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:42,150
This one is really easy to cheese and um...

3523
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:43,450
What's his name?

3524
02:15:44,410 --> 02:15:46,870
Uh... Vulcan Raven is very easy to cheese.

3525
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:49,350
Allegedly.

3526
02:15:54,650 --> 02:15:55,890
You're that ninja!

3527
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:07,050
After standing mostly still and getting shot seven times, you're pretty good.

3528
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:12,370
You know what I just realized?

3529
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:14,590
Snake's got those Kim Possible lips.

3530
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:16,030
You see it?

3531
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:20,670
I want to hear what he sounds like.

3532
02:16:22,270 --> 02:16:23,030
I want to

3533
02:16:26,130 --> 02:16:26,950
hear what he sounds like.

3534
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:27,930
I like you.

3535
02:16:28,070 --> 02:16:29,710
I have no name.

3536
02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:30,150
I like you.

3537
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:30,150
I have no name.

3538
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:31,230
Oh, he sounds so cool though.

3539
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:33,610
I mean, it's... I get that...

3540
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:36,790
I get that it's sad that it's not Grey Giggles but...

3541
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,750
What's the voice...

3542
02:16:38,750 --> 02:16:41,130
What's it called?

3543
02:16:41,930 --> 02:16:43,250
The voice effect over top?

3544
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:44,750
The voice effect over top?

3545
02:16:44,750 --> 02:16:44,830
The voice effect...

3546
02:16:46,310 --> 02:16:46,770
The voice effect...

3547
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:51,410
The voice effect...

3548
02:16:51,410 --> 02:16:52,170
Wait, what did it say?

3549
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:55,090
Wait, what did it say?

3550
02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:55,630
What was it saying?

3551
02:16:56,510 --> 02:16:56,970
Whoa!

3552
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:01,830
Sounds like Ryden?

3553
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:02,910
Do you think so?

3554
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,890
Oh no!

3555
02:17:05,230 --> 02:17:06,910
Oh my god he's going crazy!

3556
02:17:08,030 --> 02:17:10,930
Oh, the fight with him is probably gonna be so...

3557
02:17:10,930 --> 02:17:11,270
Wow!

3558
02:17:17,410 --> 02:17:18,050
Wow!

3559
02:17:18,050 --> 02:17:19,590
Slow motion bullets!

3560
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:26,470
What?

3561
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:28,010
What was that implying?

3562
02:17:28,590 --> 02:17:30,350
Oh, he was cutting the top!

3563
02:17:31,090 --> 02:17:34,910
Oh, he cut the top of the building just to kick it at Snake!

3564
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,290
No way!

3565
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:36,370
No way!

3566
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:52,350
The tension...

3567
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:57,160
Bye!

3568
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:03,000
It's a little messy, but okay.

3569
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:07,080
It's like if I'm controlling him...

3570
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:09,260
How do they make my man even more chuny?

3571
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:13,980
Because the man describing these events is absolute otaku freak!

3572
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:19,100
Can you talk?

3573
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:20,820
Who are you?

3574
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:22,880
I'm not one of them.

3575
02:18:30,180 --> 02:18:32,080
I like this part too.

3576
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:35,280
The way Snake reacts in this part makes me laugh.

3577
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:38,680
Oh, I get it.

3578
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,380
Jim sent you.

3579
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:41,260
Oh, Jim!

3580
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:43,100
Jim!

3581
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:44,780
Answer my question.

3582
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,960
What about your code?

3583
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:48,120
There's no time.

3584
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:50,840
I... I talked.

3585
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:51,740
Oh, yeah.

3586
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:52,220
You're weak.

3587
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:53,280
You...

3588
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,600
Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch any time.

3589
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:56,800
These cutscenes are crazy.

3590
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:57,540
It's like the Matrix.

3591
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:58,440
It's not like I didn't fight.

3592
02:18:58,660 --> 02:18:59,160
It is.

3593
02:18:59,180 --> 02:19:01,980
I managed to resist Psycho Mantis' mind probe.

3594
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:03,460
He couldn't read you?

3595
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,720
How'd you do it?

3596
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,420
Surgical implants in my brain.

3597
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:10,840
Surgical implants?

3598
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:11,760
Surgical implants?

3599
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:13,920
Kinda like psychic insulation.

3600
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:17,580
Everyone who knows these top secret codes has it.

3601
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:18,540
Wow.

3602
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:19,400
Even the DARPA chief?

3603
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:20,940
Of course.

3604
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:22,240
Dun dun.

3605
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:25,260
But the DARPA chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind.

3606
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:25,560
Oh.

3607
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:27,960
Are you sure you heard him right?

3608
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,320
Yeah.

3609
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:31,260
Yeah.

3610
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:33,740
Anyway, how did they get your code?

3611
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:35,180
Why'd you talk, buddy?

3612
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:39,560
I... I never had any training on how to resist torture.

3613
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:46,500
It looks like he had some fun with you, all right.

3614
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:50,240
It's just a little torture.

3615
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:50,920
He's not human.

3616
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:54,180
I tell you he loved every second of it.

3617
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,640
He's such a freak.

3618
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:57,960
He broke it.

3619
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:58,640
Oh.

3620
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:02,140
Looks like you're more than even now.

3621
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:03,740
His was sliced off.

3622
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:05,120
The effects.

3623
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,480
You're a funny guy.

3624
02:20:09,160 --> 02:20:10,120
He is.

3625
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:13,420
So, the DARPA chief, is he okay?

3626
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:14,100
Nah.

3627
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:15,140
Dead.

3628
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:16,180
Dead?

3629
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:18,400
Dun dun.

3630
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:20,220
It can't be.

3631
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:21,760
He's a little quirky, yeah.

3632
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,780
No, that's not what you promised, Jim.

3633
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:26,200
Now you want to shut me up?

3634
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,480
Calm down.

3635
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:30,620
Calm down?

3636
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,660
What's wrong with you?

3637
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:35,740
I just told you I was here to save you.

3638
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:41,120
I didn't kill the DARPA chief.

3639
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:43,180
He had a heart attack or something.

3640
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:45,560
A heart attack?

3641
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:47,280
Oh, don't be a fool.

3642
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:52,260
Lucky Baker.

3643
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:54,140
Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now.

3644
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:55,220
Wow.

3645
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:59,280
Oh, those boys are totally insane.

3646
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:02,220
They wouldn't hesitate to launch.

3647
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:04,200
I agree.

3648
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:06,220
But what do they really want?

3649
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:07,440
What do they really want?

3650
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:08,840
Who knows?

3651
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,380
Maybe they're like us in the arms industry.

3652
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:11,820
Welcome to the bamboo ship.

3653
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:12,660
Thank you so much.

3654
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:15,580
Always looking forward to the next good war.

3655
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:20,200
Well, I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war.

3656
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,700
Not today.

3657
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:23,380
Do you still have the card keys?

3658
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:25,480
Card keys?

3659
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:26,320
Give me a card key.

3660
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,800
To override the detonation code.

3661
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:30,420
I heard you had them.

3662
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:31,760
No.

3663
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:34,120
Definitely not a god bad woman.

3664
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:34,520
Not anymore.

3665
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:35,560
Who does then?

3666
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:36,640
Not the terrorists?

3667
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:37,940
No.

3668
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:39,040
That woman.

3669
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:40,660
Woman?

3670
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:41,460
Who?

3671
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:44,180
The one with the nice butt.

3672
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:46,220
The soldier that was thrown in prison along with me.

3673
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,360
Prison?

3674
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:48,260
Prison.

3675
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:49,660
That female soldier.

3676
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:50,180
Prison.

3677
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:55,180
She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.

3678
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:57,780
This girl is a thorn in my side.

3679
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,260
Because she refused to take part in the rebellion.

3680
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:02,700
A new recruit?

3681
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:05,080
Could that be the colonel's niece?

3682
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,780
I gave her the key.

3683
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,480
Looks like she managed to break out of here though.

3684
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:13,400
I hope she's okay.

3685
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:16,320
I gotta go to the bathroom after this part.

3686
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:16,580
I'm sure she is.

3687
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:18,320
She's green, but as tough as they come.

3688
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:20,180
But how did you know she escaped?

3689
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:24,180
I was in contact with her by Kodak.

3690
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:24,780
Oh, this part.

3691
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:25,760
This is the part that I like.

3692
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:29,720
Because in the original, it's like the Goblet of Fire part.

3693
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:33,480
Where in the book, Dumbledore reacts so calmly.

3694
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:35,200
But in the movie, he's crazy.

3695
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:37,920
If she still has it, you should be able to contact her.

3696
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,400
In the original, he acts like...

3697
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:40,320
I'm sure she has it.

3698
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:41,700
This one, he acts so crazy.

3699
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:41,920
What frequency was she at?

3700
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:46,080
Oh, yeah.

3701
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:47,420
Give her Kodak.

3702
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:48,720
Let me tell you, it's...

3703
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,580
Oh, sorry.

3704
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:59,360
I forgot.

3705
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:06,740
Oh, that's right.

3706
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:09,860
It should be on the back of the package.

3707
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:12,240
Try to contact her.

3708
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:16,680
I'll contact her right away.

3709
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:19,680
And in the original, he's just like damn, and he kind of hits his knee.

3710
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:21,620
Is there some other way to prevent the missile from hitting his head?

3711
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:23,860
In this one, he acts like an actual lunatic.

3712
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,580
Hal Emmerich!

3713
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:38,780
Little bit of an oddball, you guys.

3714
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:44,460
Oh.

3715
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:50,400
I'll say after this.

3716
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:52,480
Where is this Emmerich?

3717
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:58,720
Well, he's probably being held somewhere in the nuclear warhead storage building.

3718
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,720
It's north from here.

3719
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:02,540
That's where he worked.

3720
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:04,200
Got it.

3721
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:07,580
I understand, but why Metal Gear?

3722
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:10,480
The nuclear age ended with the turn of the millennium.

3723
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:11,800
Oh, you're wrong.

3724
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:14,340
The nuclear threat hasn't disappeared.

3725
02:24:14,700 --> 02:24:17,780
The threat is more real than ever before.

3726
02:24:17,980 --> 02:24:19,200
It's so icky.

3727
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:26,400
The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.

3728
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:27,600
Real footage!

3729
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:31,140
Have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?

3730
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:32,680
You're pretty good.

3731
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:33,460
Thank you.

3732
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,100
Drums and drums of nuclear waste stack this high.

3733
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:38,800
As far as you can see.

3734
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:44,320
Because there's still no real way to use it or dispose of it.

3735
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:48,020
So they just close the lid and try to pretend like it'll go away?

3736
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:49,840
Essentially, yes.

3737
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:50,420
Wow.

3738
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:53,000
And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.

3739
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:53,200
No.

3740
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:54,600
Oh, there's just people right there.

3741
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:57,840
Many of the drums are corroded with nuclear waste seeping out of them.

3742
02:24:58,220 --> 02:24:58,780
Unbelievable.

3743
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:01,020
Un-be-lievable.

3744
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:04,380
Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year.

3745
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:05,120
Not the MUF!

3746
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:07,860
It stands for material unaccounted for.

3747
02:25:08,060 --> 02:25:13,780
It proves that there's a large and well-organized black market in nuclear materials.

3748
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:22,680
Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn.

3749
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:25,620
Hey, I beat him that quickly because I'm good at the game.

3750
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,860
In other words, there's plenty of available nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.

3751
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:35,760
We live in an age where any small country can have a nuclear weapons program.

3752
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:38,400
What about the other superpowers?

3753
02:25:39,180 --> 02:25:43,220
The Russians and Chinese still pursue a policy of deterrence.

3754
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:43,980
Deterrence.

3755
02:25:44,140 --> 02:25:44,960
Do you see?

3756
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:49,100
Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.

3757
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:50,320
Oh, deterrence.

3758
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:56,180
To maintain our own policy of deterrence, we need a weapon of overwhelming power.

3759
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:56,300
Oh, it hurts.

3760
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:00,260
The Peace Walker flashbacks.

3761
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:00,840
You mean Metal Gear?

3762
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:01,880
Yes.

3763
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:02,920
Oh my god, Rex is so cute.

3764
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:09,600
You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cuts in military budgets due to this so-called peace.

3765
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:14,400
I remember hearing a lot about mergers and takeovers from the big weapons makers.

3766
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:14,620
Oh, I missed the Ocelot boss fight.

3767
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:15,420
Yes.

3768
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:17,300
Sorry, it lasted like 15 seconds.

3769
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:19,080
And after my company lost their bid to produce the UAV.

3770
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:21,040
And now we have to deal with the US Air Force's next line of fighter jet.

3771
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:25,140
The Metal Gear system was our last ace in the hole.

3772
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:29,480
That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project.

3773
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:31,080
Black project.

3774
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:31,940
Black project.

3775
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,960
Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.

3776
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:35,880
Yeah, that's what the DARPA chief talked about earlier.

3777
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:40,700
You can avoid a lot of red tape and get a great lead time on your weapons production.

3778
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:44,240
You avoid the red tape because you use black instead.

3779
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:46,620
Not even a bunch on the military oversight committee.

3780
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:47,380
It's a common secret.

3781
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:49,080
It's a well-known secret.

3782
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:53,620
Bribes.

3783
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:54,760
Bribes.

3784
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:57,820
Just call it the military-industrial complex.

3785
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:05,220
Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed.

3786
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:08,740
I don't give a crap about you or your company.

3787
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:10,260
Yeah.

3788
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:13,000
Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you.

3789
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,480
Like Victoria's Secret?

3790
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:15,020
Here.

3791
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:17,020
This is what you came for, right?

3792
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:17,660
Ah, thanks.

3793
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:18,100
Finally.

3794
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:19,060
Oh, thanks.

3795
02:27:19,060 --> 02:27:19,880
What's that?

3796
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,040
An optical disc.

3797
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:23,580
It's all here.

3798
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:26,320
Don't give me your junk.

3799
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,160
The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.

3800
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:30,880
This is the only remaining copy of the data.

3801
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:32,500
What kind of data?

3802
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:32,620
Solid Snake vs.

3803
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:34,380
Sam Fisher death battle episode.

3804
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:34,500
I'm not seeing...

3805
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:35,400
All the data collected from this exercise.

3806
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:38,480
Don't play dumb.

3807
02:27:38,980 --> 02:27:40,920
I know you were sent to get this.

3808
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:45,240
I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.

3809
02:27:45,360 --> 02:27:45,980
Where'd you hide it?

3810
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:47,480
They don't know this disc exists.

3811
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:49,040
Make sure that you don't get it.

3812
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:50,520
I know that you report this to Jim.

3813
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:51,220
Where'd you hide that?

3814
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:51,880
To your boss.

3815
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:54,940
Where did you hide that?

3816
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:56,160
I'll give you my card, too.

3817
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:59,080
It'll open up all security level two doors.

3818
02:27:59,260 --> 02:27:59,880
Between the cheeks.

3819
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:09,230
I love how flowy his, uh, his bandana is.

3820
02:28:09,390 --> 02:28:10,370
So fun to look at.

3821
02:28:10,650 --> 02:28:10,830
No.

3822
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:12,390
You go on without me.

3823
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:13,730
Ugh.

3824
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:16,470
My stomach's starting to hurt.

3825
02:28:16,490 --> 02:28:16,510
They got my password.

3826
02:28:17,130 --> 02:28:18,950
They don't want anything else from me.

3827
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:19,470
Oof.

3828
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:20,770
I have one more question.

3829
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:22,150
Do you have IB?

3830
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:23,330
What was that ninja thing?

3831
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:25,350
It looked like you knew something.

3832
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:26,570
Did it?

3833
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:28,270
That ninja?

3834
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:32,110
That was Foxhound's dark little secret.

3835
02:28:32,910 --> 02:28:34,390
Dark little secret?

3836
02:28:34,690 --> 02:28:37,610
I'll keep you my dark little secret.

3837
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,750
An experimental genome soldier.

3838
02:28:39,450 --> 02:28:42,250
Don't tell anyone or you'll be...

3839
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:43,510
You know him?

3840
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:51,370
You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from Foxhound.

3841
02:28:51,450 --> 02:28:52,070
Oh.

3842
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:53,590
She knows better than I.

3843
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:54,870
Naomi.

3844
02:28:55,290 --> 02:28:55,890
Naomi.

3845
02:28:55,890 --> 02:28:57,210
You've got to stop them.

3846
02:28:57,730 --> 02:29:02,290
If it goes public, my, my company and I are, are finished.

3847
02:29:02,650 --> 02:29:02,670
Just another reason.

3848
02:29:02,670 --> 02:29:03,310
Who has to know?

3849
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:03,810
What?

3850
02:29:04,570 --> 02:29:07,070
Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?

3851
02:29:09,330 --> 02:29:11,670
Metal Gear itself does, but...

3852
02:29:11,670 --> 02:29:11,930
Oh!

3853
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:12,910
He's turning green!

3854
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:12,930
Oh!

3855
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:13,570
Oh!

3856
02:29:13,630 --> 02:29:14,170
Oh!

3857
02:29:14,170 --> 02:29:14,770
Oh!

3858
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:15,870
Oh!

3859
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:16,310
Oh!

3860
02:29:16,870 --> 02:29:17,470
Oh!

3861
02:29:17,470 --> 02:29:18,310
He's turning green!

3862
02:29:18,570 --> 02:29:19,830
What did you do to me?

3863
02:29:19,830 --> 02:29:20,170
Oh my god!

3864
02:29:20,290 --> 02:29:21,990
He ate the blueberry from...

3865
02:29:22,150 --> 02:29:23,490
Willy Wonka!

3866
02:29:23,810 --> 02:29:24,230
Oh!

3867
02:29:26,410 --> 02:29:28,150
He's turning into...

3868
02:29:28,150 --> 02:29:28,510
What's...

3869
02:29:28,510 --> 02:29:28,890
A grape!

3870
02:29:29,550 --> 02:29:31,070
Why is he so green?

3871
02:29:35,570 --> 02:29:36,910
He's hulking out.

3872
02:29:39,150 --> 02:29:39,870
Oh!

3873
02:29:42,910 --> 02:29:44,430
What are you talking about?

3874
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:45,910
What are you talking about?

3875
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:46,270
They...

3876
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:48,230
They're just...

3877
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:49,770
Using you...

3878
02:29:49,770 --> 02:29:50,550
Using me?

3879
02:29:50,590 --> 02:29:51,090
For...

3880
02:29:51,090 --> 02:29:51,650
For...

3881
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:52,110
For...

3882
02:29:52,110 --> 02:29:52,130
For...

3883
02:29:56,270 --> 02:29:57,050
That's it?

3884
02:29:57,350 --> 02:29:57,950
Oh!

3885
02:29:59,270 --> 02:29:59,870
Oh!

3886
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:06,010
That one was way less dramatic than, uh...

3887
02:30:06,010 --> 02:30:07,970
The DARPA chiefs.

3888
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:10,170
The DARPA chief was crawling all over us!

3889
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:15,250
Um...

3890
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:19,940
Colonel, are you listening?

3891
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,400
Now he's dead too!

3892
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:22,280
Yeah, Colonel!

3893
02:30:22,420 --> 02:30:23,340
I have no idea.

3894
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:23,760
I'm going to have to find you.

3895
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,980
Don't lie to me!

3896
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:27,280
I have no idea.

3897
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:28,340
Some kind of poison?

3898
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:31,960
Well, there are lots of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.

3899
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:34,600
I have no idea, Snake.

3900
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:35,460
I have no idea, Snake.

3901
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:38,220
But we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.

3902
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:38,700
Damn!

3903
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:42,220
Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together.

3904
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:44,020
Can I trust her?

3905
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:46,240
More than you can trust me.

3906
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:49,380
Get in contact with her.

3907
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:52,960
Snake, there's a lot of electrical interference coming from there.

3908
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:56,320
It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us.

3909
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:58,700
But normal transmission is probably impossible.

3910
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,000
Try moving away from that area.

3911
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:01,560
Okay.

3912
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:03,280
Snake, get a hold of yourself.

3913
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:05,300
Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing?

3914
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,540
Move Long is the better All-American Rejects song.

3915
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:09,800
You could tell because it was, like, in the Bionicle.

3916
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:11,360
Is that the one that's...

3917
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:12,360
Yes.

3918
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:14,820
We have no one like that in our unit.

3919
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:17,020
Is that the song?

3920
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:19,260
Snake, I'm counting on you.

3921
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:21,560
I'm counting on you.

3922
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,400
Alright, we need to get her stuff from the back of the box.

3923
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:29,520
Alright, we need to get her stuff from the back of the box.

3924
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:32,800
Let's call some people real quick, such as Mei Ling.

3925
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:33,440
Let's save.

3926
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:34,920
I gotta go to the bathroom so bad.

3927
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:37,000
Snake, you can't use your radar in that area.

3928
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:37,860
There's...

3929
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:38,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3930
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:39,500
Save.

3931
02:31:42,220 --> 02:31:43,020
Yes, exactly.

3932
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:43,520
Yeah.

3933
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:47,600
Memory card.

3934
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:49,540
I'll just do new file.

3935
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:49,880
Yes.

3936
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:52,880
I've had too much coffee.

3937
02:31:56,420 --> 02:31:57,760
Be careful, Snake.

3938
02:31:58,020 --> 02:31:58,840
Come on, Mei Ling.

3939
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:00,580
Tell me one of your stories.

3940
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:02,740
Call Campbell, too.

3941
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:10,660
This sucks.

3942
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:11,000
Yeah.

3943
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:14,240
And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.

3944
02:32:15,620 --> 02:32:16,540
I have to pee.

3945
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,060
I have to pee.

3946
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:18,480
Please.

3947
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:21,200
The only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either use the detonation code release keys...

3948
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:22,160
I guess I didn't have to start this up.

3949
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:22,960
I guess I could have gone to the bathroom.

3950
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:24,260
I gotta go to the bathroom.

3951
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:24,920
Okay.

3952
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:29,140
Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned.

3953
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:30,920
Hal Emmerich.

3954
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:36,100
In any case, you should contact Meryl by codec.

3955
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:36,780
Oh, okay.

3956
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:39,200
Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the package?

3957
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:39,720
Yes.

3958
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:40,740
Oh, thank you.

3959
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:42,040
Okay, I'll be right back.

3960
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:42,720
I'll be right back.

3961
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:43,280
I'll be right back.

3962
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:44,820
I gotta go to the little ghosty's room.

3963
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:46,700
BRB.

3964
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:47,940
BRB.

3965
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:48,900
BRB.

3966
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,420
I'm back.

3967
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,260
I am back.

3968
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:46,600
Thank you.

3969
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:48,040
For the...

3970
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:49,840
For the...

3971
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:51,400
Super chat.

3972
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:52,600
Thank you.

3973
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:55,040
Thank you.

3974
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:55,340
Thank you.

3975
02:34:55,340 --> 02:34:55,720
Thank you, guys.

3976
02:34:55,820 --> 02:34:56,160
Thank you.

3977
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,260
Oh my gosh.

3978
02:34:58,340 --> 02:34:58,780
You guys.

3979
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:02,520
Welcome back.

3980
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:02,920
I'm back.

3981
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:04,640
I'm back.

3982
02:35:04,700 --> 02:35:05,060
I'm back.

3983
02:35:05,060 --> 02:35:05,340
I'm back.

3984
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:06,500
Alright.

3985
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:08,360
As one must do...

3986
02:35:11,180 --> 02:35:12,700
As one must do...

3987
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:14,260
In this moment...

3988
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:16,160
One must look at the back of the box.

3989
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:20,520
Which I have...

3990
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:21,500
Right next to me.

3991
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:26,620
We must look at the back of the box, everybody.

3992
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:30,340
So let's pull that up.

3993
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:30,640
So let's pull that up.

3994
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,300
So we can get Meryl's codec.

3995
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:38,300
It's written for ants.

3996
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:39,780
It's written for ants.

3997
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:41,100
I can't read it.

3998
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:44,420
I can't read it.

3999
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:45,360
It's so small.

4000
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:46,460
It's so small.

4001
02:35:50,450 --> 02:35:51,210
Okay, well...

4002
02:35:51,210 --> 02:35:52,530
I can't read it.

4003
02:35:52,550 --> 02:35:53,430
Well, we know what it says anyway.

4004
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:58,370
Oh, but we can't even do it here.

4005
02:35:58,570 --> 02:36:00,710
Oh, but we can't even do it here.

4006
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:03,590
Okay.

4007
02:36:03,810 --> 02:36:04,210
Okay.

4008
02:36:08,670 --> 02:36:10,350
Oh, there's bullets and stuff there, too.

4009
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,490
Hello, mister.

4010
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:14,490
Do we have clearance, too, now?

4011
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:15,290
I don't remember.

4012
02:36:15,630 --> 02:36:16,270
Oh, yes, we do.

4013
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:17,390
Grab that.

4014
02:36:18,090 --> 02:36:18,770
Grab that.

4015
02:36:20,090 --> 02:36:20,890
Grab that.

4016
02:36:20,930 --> 02:36:21,630
Oh, never mind.

4017
02:36:21,950 --> 02:36:23,550
We didn't even use that many bullets.

4018
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:28,250
Wait, what is this place?

4019
02:36:31,410 --> 02:36:32,610
What is this place?

4020
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:36,830
Oh, the armory.

4021
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:37,790
Oh, this is the...

4022
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:41,170
Oh, now the people are here.

4023
02:36:42,490 --> 02:36:43,050
Okay.

4024
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:45,650
Um...

4025
02:36:47,110 --> 02:36:48,570
But we gotta go...

4026
02:36:48,570 --> 02:36:49,350
Oh, well...

4027
02:36:50,290 --> 02:36:51,210
I guess...

4028
02:36:52,450 --> 02:36:52,730
Okay.

4029
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:54,570
Was that door always there?

4030
02:36:56,650 --> 02:36:57,970
Was that door always there?

4031
02:36:58,470 --> 02:37:00,890
Not the size of the codec, but how you use it.

4032
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:02,150
Not the size of the codec, but how you use it.

4033
02:37:02,150 --> 02:37:03,330
Right, of course, of course.

4034
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:06,150
We... There's no reason for us to go in here.

4035
02:37:06,830 --> 02:37:07,190
We...

4036
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,190
There's no reason for us to go in here.

4037
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,910
Yeah, I don't think.

4038
02:37:09,370 --> 02:37:10,830
Okay, let's go...

4039
02:37:10,830 --> 02:37:12,570
I'm just gonna go this way, cause...

4040
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:14,090
But...

4041
02:37:14,750 --> 02:37:16,550
Well, the guys are gonna, like, walk down the way.

4042
02:37:17,450 --> 02:37:19,170
Let's get our M... Hello?

4043
02:37:20,430 --> 02:37:20,790
M9?

4044
02:37:21,730 --> 02:37:22,450
Control... Controller?

4045
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:22,990
There we go.

4046
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:25,130
Okay.

4047
02:37:25,130 --> 02:37:27,310
We gotta go to the...

4048
02:37:28,590 --> 02:37:29,190
Um...

4049
02:37:31,590 --> 02:37:33,310
Nuclear Warheads building.

4050
02:37:34,110 --> 02:37:34,710
For...

4051
02:37:35,390 --> 02:37:36,510
Our little buddy.

4052
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:40,490
Yes, even in the original?

4053
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:41,830
Yes, even in the original?

4054
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:43,530
That door wasn't available...

4055
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:44,430
That door wasn't available...

4056
02:37:45,130 --> 02:37:47,370
In the OG game with your card key at the time.

4057
02:37:47,490 --> 02:37:47,870
In the OG game with your card key at the time.

4058
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:50,350
Okay, that's probably why.

4059
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:52,110
It's originally like level 6.

4060
02:37:53,470 --> 02:37:54,490
That's so interesting.

4061
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:55,210
Okay.

4062
02:37:56,010 --> 02:37:57,070
Alright, don't be a baby.

4063
02:37:58,690 --> 02:37:59,850
I'm a little scared though.

4064
02:38:00,990 --> 02:38:02,110
Cause what if they see me?

4065
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:20,020
Where is the trap?

4066
02:38:20,140 --> 02:38:21,420
Oh, the trap is already activated.

4067
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:21,800
Nice.

4068
02:38:22,300 --> 02:38:22,700
Okay.

4069
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:39,630
Snake, turn around!

4070
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:41,150
Press the button!

4071
02:38:43,390 --> 02:38:44,530
Drop him in the hole!

4072
02:38:45,410 --> 02:38:46,370
That's so rude!

4073
02:38:46,670 --> 02:38:49,410
I don't remember if there's any level 2s in here.

4074
02:38:49,490 --> 02:38:49,930
But we got it.

4075
02:38:49,950 --> 02:38:50,590
We'll come back anyway.

4076
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:53,370
It doesn't really matter, I think.

4077
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:54,170
Uh, whoop.

4078
02:38:54,910 --> 02:38:55,430
Press...

4079
02:38:56,670 --> 02:38:57,190
1.

4080
02:38:59,230 --> 02:39:00,230
Oh, that was close.

4081
02:39:00,430 --> 02:39:02,250
He was coming right up behind us.

4082
02:39:03,430 --> 02:39:04,790
Oh, the Famas!

4083
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:06,990
It's okay, we'll come back.

4084
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:09,370
Famas is level 2.

4085
02:39:17,950 --> 02:39:19,010
Why is it...

4086
02:39:22,410 --> 02:39:24,130
That was so close.

4087
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:25,730
You little jerk.

4088
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:31,060
I saw him back there.

4089
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:33,100
Hmm...

4090
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:38,220
Where are you?

4091
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:38,640
Oh, oh!

4092
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:39,040
Hello.

4093
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:40,280
Hello, sir.

4094
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:43,820
That's one down.

4095
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:46,020
Next one...

4096
02:39:49,060 --> 02:39:49,580
Is...

4097
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:51,040
Uh...

4098
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:52,300
Actually, I don't know where he is.

4099
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:55,020
Next one is...

4100
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:00,970
Thank you, Soup!

4101
02:40:01,890 --> 02:40:02,410
Um...

4102
02:40:04,250 --> 02:40:05,830
This part is so lame.

4103
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:06,910
Oh, dang it!

4104
02:40:08,010 --> 02:40:10,430
It's so not good as the original.

4105
02:40:11,290 --> 02:40:13,910
Get rid of the chorus and it's just so...

4106
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:15,410
Oh, hello to you!

4107
02:40:16,190 --> 02:40:17,110
Hello, hello!

4108
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:24,360
It's just not as nice.

4109
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,700
Where the heck is this other guy?

4110
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:28,920
Ah!

4111
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:31,160
Not the status report!

4112
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:32,900
You're killing me!

4113
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:34,920
Oh, gosh!

4114
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,660
No!

4115
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:37,660
Please, no!

4116
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:42,820
No!

4117
02:40:43,060 --> 02:40:43,580
They don't...

4118
02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:44,700
We don't need the backup unit!

4119
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:47,820
Oh, is there a...

4120
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:48,000
No.

4121
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:51,120
Yes!

4122
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:53,020
Ah!

4123
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:55,600
Ah!

4124
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:57,340
It feels so good.

4125
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:00,200
Status report...

4126
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:02,640
It's the bane of my existence, for real.

4127
02:41:03,740 --> 02:41:07,120
The status report will actually kill me.

4128
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:07,760
I think.

4129
02:41:14,890 --> 02:41:16,650
Just imagining things.

4130
02:41:16,850 --> 02:41:18,050
Just imagining things.

4131
02:41:20,310 --> 02:41:21,330
Just imagining...

4132
02:41:21,930 --> 02:41:22,610
things.

4133
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:25,490
They're not gonna come up here, are they?

4134
02:41:26,010 --> 02:41:26,990
Oh, shoot!

4135
02:41:27,090 --> 02:41:27,930
They're right here!

4136
02:41:28,850 --> 02:41:29,290
Ah!

4137
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:31,610
Um, hold on.

4138
02:41:33,710 --> 02:41:34,390
Um...

4139
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:35,430
Hmm...

4140
02:41:38,470 --> 02:41:40,010
I didn't realize they were on the second floor.

4141
02:41:42,790 --> 02:41:43,110
Hmm...

4142
02:41:44,350 --> 02:41:45,390
How do I want to handle this?

4143
02:41:49,010 --> 02:41:50,090
How do we want to...

4144
02:41:57,230 --> 02:41:58,530
I thought they were down below.

4145
02:41:58,770 --> 02:41:59,670
I didn't know they were up...

4146
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:05,980
You didn't see them on your radar?

4147
02:42:06,320 --> 02:42:06,640
No!

4148
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:07,860
They weren't on the radar!

4149
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:09,760
Can I

4150
02:42:22,170 --> 02:42:22,570
get up, please?

4151
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:24,590
Also, can we attach my rations?

4152
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:25,050
Thank you.

4153
02:42:25,410 --> 02:42:26,490
And, uh...

4154
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:29,090
Uh...

4155
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:31,710
Oh, please, please, please, please!

4156
02:42:32,010 --> 02:42:32,510
Please!

4157
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:36,350
You piece of shit!

4158
02:42:36,550 --> 02:42:37,250
Shut up!

4159
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:40,310
Oh, oh...

4160
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:42,270
And, uh...

4161
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:43,250
I'm bleeding out.

4162
02:42:43,450 --> 02:42:44,890
But you will be too soon!

4163
02:42:45,790 --> 02:42:48,250
Can you, like, not run towards me?

4164
02:42:48,670 --> 02:42:49,850
It's stressing me out.

4165
02:42:49,850 --> 02:42:51,950
I underestimated.

4166
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:53,290
Oh my god.

4167
02:42:55,550 --> 02:42:56,950
Ouch!

4168
02:42:57,350 --> 02:42:59,830
Can you calm down?

4169
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,680
Clear!

4170
02:43:14,840 --> 02:43:15,760
Clear!

4171
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:32,370
No...

4172
02:43:33,630 --> 02:43:34,330
No...

4173
02:43:34,330 --> 02:43:35,490
No...

4174
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:42,800
Don't keep going.

4175
02:43:59,150 --> 02:44:00,150
Get up, stank!

4176
02:44:02,230 --> 02:44:02,790
Oh, wait.

4177
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:12,040
My cardboard box!

4178
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:12,700
How could you?

4179
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:15,600
How could you?

4180
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:19,400
Ah, la la la.

4181
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,140
Do you think I can get him?

4182
02:44:33,900 --> 02:44:34,860
There we go.

4183
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:40,260
I'm going to get him.

4184
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:40,820
I'm going to get him.

4185
02:44:43,220 --> 02:44:43,700
Stop!

4186
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,020
Please, stop coming!

4187
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:52,620
Why are you hooming?

4188
02:44:52,840 --> 02:44:53,400
At who?

4189
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:53,920
At what?

4190
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:55,360
Who are you hooming at?

4191
02:44:56,780 --> 02:44:57,260
Clear!

4192
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:58,480
Get out of here.

4193
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:06,000
I think I just...

4194
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:09,900
Maybe ruined my chances of getting away with that.

4195
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:17,810
All good!

4196
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:22,270
Return to your positions, everybody.

4197
02:45:31,270 --> 02:45:33,310
Return to your positions, everybody.

4198
02:45:35,210 --> 02:45:36,290
Return to your positions.

4199
02:45:37,530 --> 02:45:37,970
Return to your positions.

4200
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:42,470
If I knock this guy out, though, it's going to cause another status report issue thing, isn't it?

4201
02:45:43,350 --> 02:45:43,950
Stop move.

4202
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:51,560
Actually, can you not make some noise?

4203
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,080
Can you, like...

4204
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:56,540
Are they

4205
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:14,100
coming up?

4206
02:46:16,860 --> 02:46:17,500
Can't tell.

4207
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:21,860
Are they going to come up?

4208
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:22,300
Are they going to come up?

4209
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:22,480
Are they going to come up?

4210
02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:24,220
Hmm.

4211
02:46:31,480 --> 02:46:32,540
I'm actually not sure.

4212
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:36,140
I don't think so.

4213
02:46:36,460 --> 02:46:36,860
Lockers?

4214
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:38,960
Oh, you're right.

4215
02:46:40,300 --> 02:46:41,520
Actually, that might be even better.

4216
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:44,520
Oh.

4217
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:47,300
I don't see...

4218
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:53,040
I don't see anyone on the radar, so maybe it's okay.

4219
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:54,440
B, B, B is to attack.

4220
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:56,460
B, B.

4221
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:58,040
B, B, B, B.

4222
02:46:58,220 --> 02:46:58,680
Oh.

4223
02:47:01,180 --> 02:47:01,640
Okay.

4224
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:03,680
I think we're good, maybe.

4225
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:10,120
I think we're good, maybe.

4226
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,880
The camera is so fast.

4227
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:20,340
Did it go?

4228
02:47:21,220 --> 02:47:21,680
What?

4229
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:22,140
No!

4230
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:23,120
Please, no!

4231
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:23,900
I did it!

4232
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:24,720
I did it, me too!

4233
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:28,760
Safe.

4234
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:30,800
Safe.

4235
02:47:32,320 --> 02:47:33,280
Oh, safe.

4236
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:34,760
No!

4237
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:36,320
It was so fast!

4238
02:47:41,830 --> 02:47:42,750
La, la, la.

4239
02:47:43,970 --> 02:47:44,530
Uh.

4240
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:46,910
La.

4241
02:47:47,970 --> 02:47:49,770
This goes back outside, doesn't it?

4242
02:47:49,950 --> 02:47:50,410
Uh-oh.

4243
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:58,770
I don't want to shoot the cams yet until we get the suppressor for the...

4244
02:48:00,210 --> 02:48:00,770
SOCOM.

4245
02:48:02,530 --> 02:48:03,730
Just imagining things.

4246
02:48:03,870 --> 02:48:06,070
Just imagining things.

4247
02:48:07,410 --> 02:48:08,830
So, so true.

4248
02:48:10,870 --> 02:48:11,830
So true.

4249
02:48:12,070 --> 02:48:13,070
Just imagining things.

4250
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:17,490
Is there any way to get down from here, or...

4251
02:48:18,730 --> 02:48:19,870
Does this just go outside?

4252
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:21,750
I don't want to go outside yet.

4253
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:22,670
Or again.

4254
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:27,600
It's so bright out.

4255
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:32,020
Is there anything in here?

4256
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:33,440
Hmm.

4257
02:48:35,400 --> 02:48:36,460
La, la, la.

4258
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:38,440
Is there any items, though?

4259
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:39,740
Nope.

4260
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:40,740
Okay.

4261
02:48:40,900 --> 02:48:42,000
All the way back.

4262
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:44,440
Maybe the...

4263
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:45,300
Maybe the...

4264
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:47,820
Maybe they don't know where I am.

4265
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:49,660
Maybe it got rid of the alert.

4266
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:51,600
Right?

4267
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:53,400
Yeah.

4268
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:56,780
Yeah, it just got rid of it, probably.

4269
02:48:59,440 --> 02:49:00,620
Nothing here.

4270
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:02,160
See?

4271
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:03,460
Nothing here.

4272
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:08,100
Right.

4273
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:16,960
But that guy who was asleep, he's going to be my biggest worry.

4274
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:20,660
Because we're going to not know if he is staring at us or not.

4275
02:49:22,300 --> 02:49:23,000
Or not.

4276
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:24,060
He's probably awake now.

4277
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:26,620
Okay.

4278
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:29,480
And the camera.

4279
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:33,580
Um...

4280
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:36,440
What's our best...

4281
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:41,460
What's our best call to action here?

4282
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:42,160
Oh.

4283
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:43,480
I can hear him.

4284
02:49:47,330 --> 02:49:48,310
Oh, I can hear him.

4285
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:52,420
Can I get him from here?

4286
02:49:54,700 --> 02:49:55,540
Nothing here.

4287
02:49:55,780 --> 02:49:55,900
Oh.

4288
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:56,900
I missed my shot.

4289
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:00,440
I wonder, though.

4290
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:04,200
Maybe we... Hold on.

4291
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:04,580
I'm going to...

4292
02:50:05,380 --> 02:50:05,960
Oh, wait.

4293
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,980
If I press A, it doesn't come out.

4294
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:09,980
Oh.

4295
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:11,360
Oh.

4296
02:50:11,460 --> 02:50:11,740
Oh.

4297
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:13,560
We can't get...

4298
02:50:15,100 --> 02:50:16,500
We can't get low enough.

4299
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:18,220
That's a shame.

4300
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,140
That's a shame.

4301
02:50:21,080 --> 02:50:22,300
That is a darn shame.

4302
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:24,280
Okay.

4303
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:27,200
I'm going to wait for him to come all the way back.

4304
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:30,840
We're going to have to be fast.

4305
02:50:32,060 --> 02:50:32,460
We're going to have to be fast.

4306
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:33,120
Actually...

4307
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:34,880
I have another idea.

4308
02:50:39,070 --> 02:50:40,070
I have another idea.

4309
02:50:40,150 --> 02:50:40,570
Wait a second.

4310
02:50:41,570 --> 02:50:44,930
To get to Huey, we go through...

4311
02:50:44,930 --> 02:50:46,390
We go to... Yes.

4312
02:50:46,450 --> 02:50:46,990
I know where to go.

4313
02:50:47,050 --> 02:50:47,250
Okay.

4314
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:48,270
Yes, yes, yes.

4315
02:50:49,690 --> 02:50:50,090
Um...

4316
02:50:50,910 --> 02:50:51,830
Is he walking away?

4317
02:50:52,330 --> 02:50:53,170
I think we're good.

4318
02:50:54,170 --> 02:50:54,910
Can I go down?

4319
02:50:55,190 --> 02:50:55,590
Hello?

4320
02:50:55,690 --> 02:50:56,410
How do I go down?

4321
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:57,750
Nothing here.

4322
02:50:59,530 --> 02:51:00,050
Please don't...

4323
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:02,150
Please don't notice me.

4324
02:51:02,230 --> 02:51:02,410
Okay.

4325
02:51:02,450 --> 02:51:02,890
Good, good, good.

4326
02:51:03,490 --> 02:51:03,810
Okay.

4327
02:51:04,410 --> 02:51:04,950
Here we go.

4328
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,630
This is...

4329
02:51:10,010 --> 02:51:10,730
How do I drop?

4330
02:51:11,730 --> 02:51:12,630
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4331
02:51:13,550 --> 02:51:14,610
How do I drop down?

4332
02:51:15,210 --> 02:51:15,690
Drop down.

4333
02:51:18,270 --> 02:51:19,710
We got to go through...

4334
02:51:24,110 --> 02:51:25,530
How do I...

4335
02:51:30,930 --> 02:51:32,430
I said... I keep saying Huey.

4336
02:51:33,010 --> 02:51:33,450
Oh, no.

4337
02:51:33,590 --> 02:51:34,910
My brain is poisoned.

4338
02:51:35,470 --> 02:51:37,230
My brain is poisoned, you guys.

4339
02:51:37,490 --> 02:51:37,930
No.

4340
02:51:38,250 --> 02:51:39,190
Not Huey.

4341
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:46,820
Shit.

4342
02:52:07,030 --> 02:52:08,030
Take him over here.

4343
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:10,350
I'm getting a little bit more used to the controls now.

4344
02:52:10,910 --> 02:52:11,350
Yippee.

4345
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:13,390
Yippee.

4346
02:52:13,550 --> 02:52:14,470
Thank you, sir.

4347
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:16,530
Okay.

4348
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:18,170
Where's our other friend at?

4349
02:52:30,580 --> 02:52:32,940
I'm not going to get that guy because he scares me.

4350
02:52:36,750 --> 02:52:37,290
What?

4351
02:52:41,590 --> 02:52:42,670
Just run.

4352
02:52:48,150 --> 02:52:48,690
Oh.

4353
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:49,590
It's this guy.

4354
02:52:49,730 --> 02:52:50,430
I forgot about him.

4355
02:52:52,970 --> 02:52:54,050
Oh, shit.

4356
02:52:54,210 --> 02:52:54,870
Oh, gosh.

4357
02:52:56,090 --> 02:52:56,830
Never mind.

4358
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:03,950
We're okay.

4359
02:53:05,150 --> 02:53:05,930
Everything's good.

4360
02:53:06,170 --> 02:53:08,170
How do I attach the suppressor?

4361
02:53:12,710 --> 02:53:14,010
Get out of here, Huey.

4362
02:53:14,030 --> 02:53:14,470
SMH.

4363
02:53:16,230 --> 02:53:16,830
Truth.

4364
02:53:21,870 --> 02:53:22,470
Respond.

4365
02:53:22,630 --> 02:53:24,090
Oh, here.

4366
02:53:25,450 --> 02:53:26,050
Equip.

4367
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:27,370
Equip.

4368
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:30,630
With you.

4369
02:53:32,370 --> 02:53:32,970
Attach.

4370
02:53:33,110 --> 02:53:33,650
Yippee.

4371
02:53:35,290 --> 02:53:36,430
Now we can kill.

4372
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:38,570
Without.

4373
02:53:40,750 --> 02:53:41,470
Without worry.

4374
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:48,100
Thank you.

4375
02:53:48,940 --> 02:53:49,300
Um.

4376
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:51,920
They're not going to come in here.

4377
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:53,980
Oh, my God.

4378
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:54,760
Oh, my God.

4379
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:55,320
Oh, my God.

4380
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:55,800
Oh, my God.

4381
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:56,100
Oh, my God.

4382
02:53:56,100 --> 02:53:56,180
Oh, my God.

4383
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:57,080
Oh, my God.

4384
02:53:57,220 --> 02:53:58,180
Oh, my God.

4385
02:53:58,180 --> 02:53:58,640
Oh, my God.

4386
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:01,240
Oh, my God.

4387
02:54:01,640 --> 02:54:04,300
I think.

4388
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:06,540
I think I'm getting a sense of deja vu.

4389
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:07,680
In here.

4390
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:09,480
I think I'm receiving...

4391
02:54:09,480 --> 02:54:11,660
Oh, a weird, strange...

4392
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:12,980
What is this?

4393
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:13,660
Sense of...

4394
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:16,560
Oh, my brain.

4395
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:17,520
Brain hurts.

4396
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:19,380
It's like I've lived through this before.

4397
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:20,820
Oh, my gosh.

4398
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:23,360
Okay.

4399
02:54:23,780 --> 02:54:24,720
Attach the rations.

4400
02:54:26,820 --> 02:54:27,340
No.

4401
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:29,400
Oh, okay.

4402
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:30,700
You're just...

4403
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:31,200
Where are you?

4404
02:54:34,660 --> 02:54:35,380
Acknowledge what?

4405
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:35,720
Huh?

4406
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:37,360
That I'm too strong for you?

4407
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:39,920
Okay.

4408
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,300
Hmm.

4409
02:54:48,430 --> 02:54:49,890
I know they're going to come in here.

4410
02:54:49,970 --> 02:54:50,890
And they're going to see my box.

4411
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:52,310
And they're going to come after me.

4412
02:54:52,370 --> 02:54:53,430
They're going to see my box.

4413
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:01,680
Why don't you go after your dead friends first?

4414
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:02,660
Hmm.

4415
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:12,140
Level a million IQ, everybody.

4416
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:14,820
Um.

4417
02:55:15,620 --> 02:55:16,060
Um.

4418
02:55:17,820 --> 02:55:18,580
Excuse me.

4419
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:19,440
I'm trying to call.

4420
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:20,380
Thank you.

4421
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:25,160
In any case, you should contact Meryl by codec.

4422
02:55:25,720 --> 02:55:26,960
Wasn't her frequency...

4423
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:30,240
I forgot this whole time that we haven't called Meryl yet.

4424
02:55:31,060 --> 02:55:32,120
Oh, my gosh.

4425
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:33,640
I forgot this.

4426
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:36,720
I was just like, Meryl, when are you going to open the door for us to go?

4427
02:55:37,100 --> 02:55:39,420
We haven't even contacted her.

4428
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:39,880
We haven't even contacted her.

4429
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:41,620
Oh, I'm...

4430
02:55:41,620 --> 02:55:42,660
Oh, no.

4431
02:55:44,940 --> 02:55:46,860
I forgot this whole time.

4432
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:52,830
Who are you?

4433
02:55:53,570 --> 02:55:54,530
I was really impressed.

4434
02:55:54,710 --> 02:55:57,110
When are you going to open the door for us to go?

4435
02:55:57,850 --> 02:55:59,070
You're the Colonel's niece.

4436
02:55:59,590 --> 02:56:00,310
Meryl, right?

4437
02:56:00,750 --> 02:56:02,430
No, it's not him.

4438
02:56:02,730 --> 02:56:04,430
Just exactly who are you?

4439
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:08,170
I'm the fool that your uncle sent to this hellhole.

4440
02:56:08,530 --> 02:56:09,150
You came alone?

4441
02:56:09,550 --> 02:56:10,970
You are so silly.

4442
02:56:11,690 --> 02:56:13,330
I don't need lectures.

4443
02:56:14,030 --> 02:56:15,710
You're just like your uncle, you know.

4444
02:56:15,910 --> 02:56:17,470
I didn't know my uncle.

4445
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:18,610
We go way back.

4446
02:56:18,890 --> 02:56:19,570
What's your name?

4447
02:56:19,930 --> 02:56:21,370
My name is not important.

4448
02:56:24,030 --> 02:56:25,550
Could you be Snake?

4449
02:56:26,270 --> 02:56:27,650
Are you Solid Snake?

4450
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:29,430
That's what some people called me.

4451
02:56:29,690 --> 02:56:31,570
The legendary Solid Snake?

4452
02:56:32,090 --> 02:56:32,610
You?

4453
02:56:32,870 --> 02:56:33,830
Yeah, I'm a little legendary.

4454
02:56:34,190 --> 02:56:35,170
Sorry about before.

4455
02:56:35,510 --> 02:56:37,570
I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys.

4456
02:56:37,890 --> 02:56:39,010
But I knew you were.

4457
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:40,130
How?

4458
02:56:40,630 --> 02:56:41,610
It's your eyes.

4459
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:42,950
My eyes?

4460
02:56:43,950 --> 02:56:44,850
Not soldier's eyes.

4461
02:56:45,530 --> 02:56:46,990
They're rookie's eyes, right?

4462
02:56:47,350 --> 02:56:47,670
No.

4463
02:56:48,010 --> 02:56:49,950
They're beautiful, compassionate eyes.

4464
02:56:50,890 --> 02:56:53,730
Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.

4465
02:56:54,010 --> 02:56:55,670
You trying to sweep me off my feet?

4466
02:56:55,870 --> 02:56:56,150
Wow.

4467
02:56:56,450 --> 02:56:57,070
Don't worry.

4468
02:56:57,430 --> 02:56:59,510
You'll land back on them once you meet me.

4469
02:56:59,650 --> 02:57:02,230
The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.

4470
02:57:02,490 --> 02:57:03,170
I don't believe that.

4471
02:57:03,170 --> 02:57:04,390
Have more confidence, Snake.

4472
02:57:04,450 --> 02:57:06,830
Why did you look so surprised when you saw my face?

4473
02:57:07,150 --> 02:57:08,730
Because you look just like him.

4474
02:57:09,070 --> 02:57:11,870
You mean the terrorist leader, Liquid Snake?

4475
02:57:12,090 --> 02:57:12,650
Liquid Snake.

4476
02:57:12,990 --> 02:57:13,110
Yeah.

4477
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:13,770
You know him?

4478
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:15,890
You're not brothers, are you?

4479
02:57:16,210 --> 02:57:17,230
I have no family.

4480
02:57:17,570 --> 02:57:18,970
So what's the deal then?

4481
02:57:19,250 --> 02:57:19,950
I don't know.

4482
02:57:19,970 --> 02:57:20,750
I killed my dad.

4483
02:57:20,990 --> 02:57:22,050
Maybe I'll ask him personally.

4484
02:57:22,390 --> 02:57:23,990
But first, I want some information.

4485
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:25,250
I miss womanizing, Snake.

4486
02:57:25,510 --> 02:57:27,430
You were involved in this exercise from the beginning.

4487
02:57:27,650 --> 02:57:29,410
What exactly happened here?

4488
02:57:29,850 --> 02:57:32,070
I just joined the training that same day.

4489
02:57:32,410 --> 02:57:33,170
That's okay.

4490
02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:35,010
But what is this place?

4491
02:57:35,370 --> 02:57:38,490
I don't think it's just a nuclear weapon disposal facility.

4492
02:57:38,610 --> 02:57:39,910
Yeah, it's a little weird.

4493
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:41,170
It's just like them.

4494
02:57:41,830 --> 02:57:43,570
Nobody's told you anything, did they?

4495
02:57:43,730 --> 02:57:44,070
Nope.

4496
02:57:44,570 --> 02:57:45,010
Okay.

4497
02:57:45,370 --> 02:57:48,670
You see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.

4498
02:57:49,090 --> 02:57:52,910
This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of arms tech.

4499
02:57:53,290 --> 02:57:54,850
This is a civilian base?

4500
02:57:55,870 --> 02:57:56,310
Right.

4501
02:57:56,310 --> 02:57:57,190
For the development of Metal Gear.

4502
02:57:57,190 --> 02:57:58,270
Guys, what should I have for dinner today?

4503
02:57:58,850 --> 02:57:59,290
Colonel.

4504
02:58:00,770 --> 02:58:03,250
I'm starting to get hungry.

4505
02:58:04,110 --> 02:58:05,750
Actually, I think I have a pizza in the fridge.

4506
02:58:05,870 --> 02:58:07,690
I was gonna have it yesterday, but I didn't.

4507
02:58:08,350 --> 02:58:08,870
Why pizza?

4508
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:10,670
You read my mind.

4509
02:58:12,710 --> 02:58:15,270
They figured they could help keep it all hush-hush.

4510
02:58:15,410 --> 02:58:18,530
But they must have been test-firing dummy warheads for a while.

4511
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:20,090
Why just this time?

4512
02:58:20,730 --> 02:58:22,530
The coffee is making me a little shaky.

4513
02:58:22,710 --> 02:58:25,370
I heard it was because this was supposed to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program.

4514
02:58:25,450 --> 02:58:26,470
So I'll have to go start the...

4515
02:58:26,470 --> 02:58:27,090
That's what I heard, anyway.

4516
02:58:27,230 --> 02:58:28,870
When I went to the bathroom, I should have started the oven.

4517
02:58:29,010 --> 02:58:29,890
Sounds kind of fishy.

4518
02:58:30,430 --> 02:58:30,870
It smells fishy in here.

4519
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:32,150
So what do you think the terrorists want?

4520
02:58:32,850 --> 02:58:34,330
Sorry, I'm not sure.

4521
02:58:34,810 --> 02:58:37,870
I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started.

4522
02:58:38,230 --> 02:58:38,630
Damn.

4523
02:58:39,910 --> 02:58:42,810
That's when he gave you the detonation code override keys, right?

4524
02:58:42,850 --> 02:58:43,490
That's right.

4525
02:58:45,250 --> 02:58:46,090
Reticulated Python.

4526
02:58:47,670 --> 02:58:50,570
Well, women have more hiding places than men.

4527
02:58:50,570 --> 02:58:50,850
Oh, and some more.

4528
02:58:51,230 --> 02:58:53,090
Anyway, you met Baker, huh?

4529
02:58:54,670 --> 02:58:55,150
Girlie?

4530
02:58:55,350 --> 02:58:56,030
He's dead.

4531
02:58:56,370 --> 02:58:57,970
Heart attack.

4532
02:58:58,490 --> 02:58:59,270
What do you mean?

4533
02:59:00,310 --> 02:59:02,310
The chief died from a heart attack, too?

4534
02:59:02,730 --> 02:59:03,050
Yeah.

4535
02:59:03,470 --> 02:59:05,130
Was either of them sick or anything?

4536
02:59:05,550 --> 02:59:05,910
No.

4537
02:59:06,610 --> 02:59:07,710
Not that I heard of.

4538
02:59:07,710 --> 02:59:11,170
You know, first time I get it, but second time, it's a little suspicious.

4539
02:59:11,670 --> 02:59:12,590
Something funny's going on.

4540
02:59:13,470 --> 02:59:14,570
Sounds like it.

4541
02:59:14,870 --> 02:59:16,410
But I have no idea what.

4542
02:59:16,750 --> 02:59:17,550
Me neither.

4543
02:59:17,810 --> 02:59:20,310
Dinner, diazepam, and cigarettes.

4544
02:59:20,450 --> 02:59:21,750
Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?

4545
02:59:22,170 --> 02:59:23,610
You mean Dr. Emmerich?

4546
02:59:23,830 --> 02:59:24,190
How?

4547
02:59:24,670 --> 02:59:29,650
He should be in the research lab in the second floor basement of the nuclear warhead storage building to the north.

4548
02:59:29,650 --> 02:59:29,830
Not Huey.

4549
02:59:29,830 --> 02:59:30,590
I can't believe I kept saying Huey.

4550
02:59:30,590 --> 02:59:31,430
Second floor basement.

4551
02:59:31,430 --> 02:59:32,250
Yeah.

4552
02:59:32,490 --> 02:59:33,310
Second floor basement.

4553
02:59:33,390 --> 02:59:34,070
That's where his lab is.

4554
02:59:34,370 --> 02:59:37,290
I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program.

4555
02:59:37,870 --> 02:59:40,730
So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway.

4556
02:59:40,730 --> 02:59:41,030
Thank you.

4557
02:59:41,430 --> 02:59:46,450
Miller does say going to the bathroom is important since you never know when a long cutscene will begin.

4558
02:59:46,450 --> 02:59:50,390
In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.

4559
02:59:50,850 --> 02:59:53,490
You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?

4560
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:54,070
Oh yeah.

4561
02:59:54,250 --> 02:59:55,390
It won't be the first time.

4562
02:59:56,170 --> 02:59:57,150
It's so cool.

4563
02:59:57,150 --> 03:00:01,490
How do we get to the nuclear warhead storage where the doctor's being held?

4564
03:00:01,950 --> 03:00:05,670
There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north.

4565
03:00:05,810 --> 03:00:07,810
What's the security level of the door there?

4566
03:00:08,190 --> 03:00:08,590
Five.

4567
03:00:09,050 --> 03:00:09,490
Five!

4568
03:00:10,290 --> 03:00:14,430
I've gotta go save the doctor.

4569
03:00:14,770 --> 03:00:16,070
You should go to the...

4570
03:00:16,070 --> 03:00:17,010
I'm going with you.

4571
03:00:17,150 --> 03:00:18,610
No, you're just gonna get in my way.

4572
03:00:18,910 --> 03:00:19,490
You're still too green.

4573
03:00:19,710 --> 03:00:20,950
I want you to hide somewhere.

4574
03:00:21,110 --> 03:00:22,490
I told you to be a good girl.

4575
03:00:22,850 --> 03:00:23,690
Oh yes you are.

4576
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:29,390
You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over.

4577
03:00:29,470 --> 03:00:30,570
I know, I'm still green too.

4578
03:00:30,710 --> 03:00:31,590
Good luck doesn't last forever.

4579
03:00:32,010 --> 03:00:32,490
Five!

4580
03:00:32,730 --> 03:00:33,950
I don't know what happened.

4581
03:00:34,330 --> 03:00:36,470
I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.

4582
03:00:36,570 --> 03:00:37,190
Sad music?

4583
03:00:37,590 --> 03:00:39,290
I never had any problems in training.

4584
03:00:39,890 --> 03:00:44,010
It was frightening to think that with a pull of a trigger I could take someone's life.

4585
03:00:44,570 --> 03:00:46,750
It's not like shooting targets in training.

4586
03:00:47,170 --> 03:00:47,190
Wait.

4587
03:00:47,350 --> 03:00:48,490
What is this music?

4588
03:00:48,530 --> 03:00:50,290
I always dreamed of being a soldier.

4589
03:00:51,090 --> 03:00:52,490
Every day of my life.

4590
03:00:53,690 --> 03:00:57,610
My mind and body for the one day when I could finally see some real action.

4591
03:00:57,810 --> 03:00:58,510
And now...

4592
03:00:58,510 --> 03:00:59,570
So what now?

4593
03:00:59,670 --> 03:01:00,670
You wanna quit?

4594
03:01:00,890 --> 03:01:01,690
I can't quit.

4595
03:01:01,930 --> 03:01:03,950
I can't allow myself to quit now.

4596
03:01:04,670 --> 03:01:05,190
Listen.

4597
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:08,810
You're not normal if you don't feel something the first time you kill.

4598
03:01:09,030 --> 03:01:10,050
I don't hate it, but...

4599
03:01:10,050 --> 03:01:12,370
Killing without guilt produces more carnage.

4600
03:01:12,710 --> 03:01:13,690
In a war...

4601
03:01:13,690 --> 03:01:14,190
You'll get used to it.

4602
03:01:14,190 --> 03:01:17,230
All of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits emerge.

4603
03:01:17,770 --> 03:01:21,150
It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield.

4604
03:01:21,430 --> 03:01:22,310
I don't hate it, like I said, but it's not as iconic.

4605
03:01:22,310 --> 03:01:23,150
But this isn't a war.

4606
03:01:23,690 --> 03:01:24,430
It's a terrorist action.

4607
03:01:24,910 --> 03:01:27,130
You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.

4608
03:01:27,470 --> 03:01:30,070
The adrenaline in your bloodstream is starting to thin out.

4609
03:01:30,350 --> 03:01:31,410
Just take it easy.

4610
03:01:31,730 --> 03:01:34,530
But I learned all about combat high at the academy.

4611
03:01:35,010 --> 03:01:36,590
We'll talk about it later.

4612
03:01:36,870 --> 03:01:39,530
For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.

4613
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:40,650
Can you open the door for me?

4614
03:01:40,710 --> 03:01:41,590
I think I'm in trouble.

4615
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:44,830
If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff.

4616
03:01:45,010 --> 03:01:45,610
I need to get the hell.

4617
03:01:45,810 --> 03:01:45,830
Okay.

4618
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:48,270
Let me try to say this another way.

4619
03:01:48,810 --> 03:01:51,230
Stay the hell out of my way.

4620
03:01:52,190 --> 03:01:54,890
Stay the hell out of my way.

4621
03:01:54,950 --> 03:01:55,110
You're a real bastard.

4622
03:01:55,110 --> 03:01:56,050
Just like my uncle said.

4623
03:01:56,830 --> 03:01:58,150
I told you.

4624
03:01:58,270 --> 03:02:00,210
The real me is no match for the legend.

4625
03:02:00,210 --> 03:02:01,490
What if I just hide under the...

4626
03:02:03,390 --> 03:02:05,010
the tank until...

4627
03:02:06,590 --> 03:02:07,510
Okay, Snake.

4628
03:02:08,070 --> 03:02:09,470
I'll be a good girl.

4629
03:02:10,090 --> 03:02:12,330
We'll link up after I grab the doctor.

4630
03:02:12,550 --> 03:02:14,450
Hang on to the key until then.

4631
03:02:14,730 --> 03:02:15,350
Got ya.

4632
03:02:15,470 --> 03:02:18,110
But listen, I know this area better than you.

4633
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:19,950
Call me if you have any questions.

4634
03:02:20,590 --> 03:02:22,070
Be careful, okay?

4635
03:02:22,390 --> 03:02:24,370
I love the awkward laugh together.

4636
03:02:24,570 --> 03:02:25,470
After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.

4637
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:27,410
Wait!

4638
03:02:28,370 --> 03:02:29,150
You're a...

4639
03:02:29,150 --> 03:02:30,650
Thank you!

4640
03:02:31,730 --> 03:02:35,510
Your influence made me buy the Metal Gear collection on Switch for my birthday!

4641
03:02:36,790 --> 03:02:37,270
Woohoo!

4642
03:02:37,430 --> 03:02:38,410
Have fun with it!

4643
03:02:40,510 --> 03:02:40,990
Um...

4644
03:02:41,810 --> 03:02:43,050
I have to leave first.

4645
03:02:43,310 --> 03:02:43,930
Get the FAMAS.

4646
03:02:44,090 --> 03:02:46,170
Yeah, we'll go back to the armory and go get it.

4647
03:02:46,270 --> 03:02:46,630
You know what?

4648
03:02:46,650 --> 03:02:48,010
Because we're right here by the...

4649
03:02:50,870 --> 03:02:52,770
I'm in caution anyway, so it's probably...

4650
03:02:52,770 --> 03:02:53,310
Come on, please!

4651
03:02:53,590 --> 03:02:54,310
Please, Snake!

4652
03:02:54,750 --> 03:02:55,370
No, God!

4653
03:02:55,410 --> 03:02:56,130
Please, please, please.

4654
03:02:56,310 --> 03:02:56,850
No one.

4655
03:03:07,100 --> 03:03:08,560
Just press the button.

4656
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:10,960
Press the button!

4657
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:11,840
Thank you.

4658
03:03:12,820 --> 03:03:14,140
Please, please, please, please!

4659
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:14,660
Oh, God!

4660
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:17,820
They're both coming!

4661
03:03:33,160 --> 03:03:33,520
Easy.

4662
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:37,040
Which, uh...

4663
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:39,480
Two.

4664
03:04:14,870 --> 03:04:15,390
Oh...

4665
03:04:15,390 --> 03:04:16,390
Oh...

4666
03:04:18,930 --> 03:04:19,650
Who's there?

4667
03:04:19,830 --> 03:04:20,470
No one.

4668
03:04:21,630 --> 03:04:22,270
Who's that?

4669
03:04:23,030 --> 03:04:24,270
It's the enemy.

4670
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:24,790
I need...

4671
03:04:24,790 --> 03:04:25,430
It is?

4672
03:04:25,730 --> 03:04:26,250
Oh...

4673
03:04:27,590 --> 03:04:29,010
Oh, come on!

4674
03:04:29,010 --> 03:04:29,970
Let me just get that gun!

4675
03:04:32,230 --> 03:04:32,750
Um...

4676
03:04:32,750 --> 03:04:34,470
I'll go in blasting.

4677
03:04:35,770 --> 03:04:36,950
I don't like the alert.

4678
03:04:37,070 --> 03:04:37,790
Oh my gosh!

4679
03:04:38,510 --> 03:04:39,510
Get out of my way!

4680
03:04:39,650 --> 03:04:40,610
Get out of my way!

4681
03:04:41,090 --> 03:04:42,150
Out of my way!

4682
03:04:43,490 --> 03:04:44,530
What the?

4683
03:04:51,310 --> 03:04:51,830
What?

4684
03:04:52,410 --> 03:04:52,930
What?

4685
03:04:54,830 --> 03:04:55,350
What?

4686
03:04:56,390 --> 03:04:56,910
No!

4687
03:05:00,150 --> 03:05:01,390
Is this a trap?

4688
03:05:02,130 --> 03:05:03,490
I think this one's a trap.

4689
03:05:05,810 --> 03:05:07,570
This one we need the cigarettes for.

4690
03:05:08,050 --> 03:05:08,570
Yeah.

4691
03:05:08,570 --> 03:05:09,690
Uh...

4692
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:24,700
Are they gonna come in here?

4693
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:28,560
That was so close!

4694
03:05:30,060 --> 03:05:32,340
That was so close!

4695
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:35,660
They won't come in here because...

4696
03:05:35,660 --> 03:05:36,760
What are they gonna do?

4697
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:38,160
Pass through the lasers?

4698
03:05:38,480 --> 03:05:39,320
They can't.

4699
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:40,860
I don't...

4700
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:42,880
What?

4701
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:45,480
Who just died?

4702
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:51,820
Um...

4703
03:05:51,820 --> 03:05:52,360
Huh?

4704
03:05:57,200 --> 03:05:58,760
Who just died?

4705
03:06:02,330 --> 03:06:04,090
He fell into the trap hole?

4706
03:06:04,450 --> 03:06:05,230
No way.

4707
03:06:09,390 --> 03:06:11,250
It's gonna run out and they're gonna leave.

4708
03:06:15,940 --> 03:06:16,560
Nice.

4709
03:06:18,820 --> 03:06:19,440
Okay.

4710
03:06:19,860 --> 03:06:21,400
He just does that.

4711
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:25,600
I almost pressed the wrong button.

4712
03:06:25,700 --> 03:06:27,600
I almost pressed A when I had it equipped.

4713
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:51,130
Press Y button for safety?

4714
03:06:53,130 --> 03:06:53,870
What do you mean?

4715
03:06:53,970 --> 03:06:55,470
Wait, I can turn the safety on?

4716
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:57,690
Probably should save.

4717
03:06:57,770 --> 03:06:59,070
You are so...

4718
03:06:59,070 --> 03:06:59,910
right.

4719
03:07:03,770 --> 03:07:04,890
Can call it fake?

4720
03:07:05,650 --> 03:07:06,890
Can call it fake?

4721
03:07:12,830 --> 03:07:14,690
It's the theme they don't use anymore.

4722
03:07:16,790 --> 03:07:17,570
Save complete.

4723
03:07:17,730 --> 03:07:20,170
Come on, Mei-Ling.

4724
03:07:20,230 --> 03:07:20,570
Give me that.

4725
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:21,110
Snake.

4726
03:07:26,050 --> 03:07:28,810
Oh, let's also call the colonel since we got Meryl.

4727
03:07:32,630 --> 03:07:33,970
I'm not wise.

4728
03:07:35,430 --> 03:07:36,750
Avoid the trap.

4729
03:07:36,890 --> 03:07:37,730
I got you, girl.

4730
03:07:37,870 --> 03:07:38,550
I know.

4731
03:07:39,130 --> 03:07:40,570
I was so smart before.

4732
03:07:41,610 --> 03:07:44,470
It looks like the place is protected by infrared sensors.

4733
03:07:44,830 --> 03:07:45,490
Copyright issues, right?

4734
03:07:45,710 --> 03:07:47,230
Yeah, it was very...

4735
03:07:48,810 --> 03:07:50,110
Very similar... wait.

4736
03:07:50,290 --> 03:07:50,610
No!

4737
03:07:51,170 --> 03:07:51,730
Colonel!

4738
03:07:51,970 --> 03:07:52,750
Your nephew!

4739
03:07:54,130 --> 03:07:55,170
Your nephew...

4740
03:07:55,170 --> 03:07:55,470
Niece!

4741
03:07:55,610 --> 03:07:56,170
Niece!

4742
03:07:58,170 --> 03:07:58,990
Your niece!

4743
03:07:59,670 --> 03:08:00,970
Your niece!

4744
03:08:01,390 --> 03:08:01,950
Um...

4745
03:08:01,950 --> 03:08:04,230
Yeah, it was very similar to...

4746
03:08:05,470 --> 03:08:06,030
to...

4747
03:08:06,890 --> 03:08:08,290
Russian composed song.

4748
03:08:08,690 --> 03:08:10,890
So, unfortunately, it had to be...

4749
03:08:11,810 --> 03:08:12,410
Um...

4750
03:08:13,150 --> 03:08:14,050
Had to...

4751
03:08:14,050 --> 03:08:15,650
Could not use it anymore.

4752
03:08:16,910 --> 03:08:17,830
So sad.

4753
03:08:18,150 --> 03:08:19,570
Oh, there's the hole.

4754
03:08:19,770 --> 03:08:20,430
That is so...

4755
03:08:20,430 --> 03:08:21,890
I thought that was a hole again!

4756
03:08:22,070 --> 03:08:22,850
Oh my god!

4757
03:08:23,230 --> 03:08:24,570
Oh my god!

4758
03:08:26,090 --> 03:08:27,770
Oh my god!

4759
03:08:43,730 --> 03:08:45,570
Don't see me, but I am gonna...

4760
03:08:46,750 --> 03:08:47,950
Just gonna...

4761
03:08:47,950 --> 03:08:49,170
There we go.

4762
03:08:50,450 --> 03:08:51,050
Sleep tight.

4763
03:08:54,750 --> 03:08:56,250
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

4764
03:08:56,370 --> 03:08:56,710
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

4765
03:08:57,190 --> 03:08:57,690
Come on!

4766
03:08:57,790 --> 03:08:58,070
Come on!

4767
03:08:58,070 --> 03:08:58,170
Come on!

4768
03:08:58,170 --> 03:08:58,230
Come on!

4769
03:08:58,230 --> 03:08:58,590
Please!

4770
03:08:58,890 --> 03:08:59,290
Please!

4771
03:09:10,210 --> 03:09:10,830
Wait a minute.

4772
03:09:10,930 --> 03:09:12,470
You reheat your pizza in the oven?

4773
03:09:13,230 --> 03:09:14,490
No, it's um...

4774
03:09:15,870 --> 03:09:16,270
Ah!

4775
03:09:16,630 --> 03:09:17,030
Perfect.

4776
03:09:17,450 --> 03:09:19,630
It's one of those, like, oven pizzas.

4777
03:09:20,030 --> 03:09:21,610
Where I can see ya.

4778
03:09:26,550 --> 03:09:27,050
No, it's...

4779
03:09:27,050 --> 03:09:28,150
Please smash the ball!

4780
03:09:28,190 --> 03:09:29,670
Thank you for the... super job!

4781
03:09:30,710 --> 03:09:31,870
What does that mean?

4782
03:09:31,970 --> 03:09:32,550
It's been nine years.

4783
03:09:40,390 --> 03:09:42,870
Wait, where is the...

4784
03:09:42,870 --> 03:09:43,530
Gas.

4785
03:09:45,330 --> 03:09:45,650
Gas.

4786
03:09:49,070 --> 03:09:51,170
I thought you said you'd be a good girl.

4787
03:09:51,350 --> 03:09:52,190
I thought you said you'd be a good girl.

4788
03:09:52,350 --> 03:09:53,930
I changed my mind.

4789
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:55,410
Don't get careless.

4790
03:09:55,750 --> 03:09:56,430
That's when...

4791
03:09:56,550 --> 03:09:57,550
things always turn sour.

4792
03:09:57,550 --> 03:09:58,570
You said you'd be a good girl.

4793
03:09:58,650 --> 03:10:02,770
Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure whether or not I'm cut out to be a soldier.

4794
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:03,350
Um...

4795
03:10:03,350 --> 03:10:04,710
I gotta get my hands dirty.

4796
03:10:04,750 --> 03:10:07,390
Actually, where... can I get the thermal goggles yet?

4797
03:10:07,390 --> 03:10:10,250
Cause the one room had...

4798
03:10:10,250 --> 03:10:12,530
the suppressor and the other...

4799
03:10:13,770 --> 03:10:14,230
had...

4800
03:10:20,140 --> 03:10:20,600
Wait.

4801
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:37,800
Be careful, Snake.

4802
03:10:37,980 --> 03:10:40,080
That airlock is set with infrared sensors.

4803
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:41,640
What is it?

4804
03:10:41,640 --> 03:10:42,440
What is it?

4805
03:10:42,580 --> 03:10:46,700
You probably can't see them with your naked eyes, but there are infrared beams coming out of that wall.

4806
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:51,340
Touch any one of them and the doors will seal off and the place will be flooded with poison gas.

4807
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:55,220
Somehow you've got to get through without setting off those sensors.

4808
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:57,440
I'm gonna die from the cigarettes!

4809
03:10:58,880 --> 03:10:59,880
Cigarettes are gonna kill me.

4810
03:11:00,900 --> 03:11:01,340
Uh...

4811
03:11:01,340 --> 03:11:01,720
Okay.

4812
03:11:03,180 --> 03:11:06,960
Okay, this one's slow.

4813
03:11:13,620 --> 03:11:14,700
Don't see me in here.

4814
03:11:15,940 --> 03:11:17,520
Oh, it's really...

4815
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:19,300
Okay.

4816
03:11:21,380 --> 03:11:22,280
Nothing here.

4817
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:23,880
Yep, nothing here.

4818
03:11:24,660 --> 03:11:25,700
Nice and easy.

4819
03:11:29,380 --> 03:11:31,140
I wonder if I should use one.

4820
03:11:32,580 --> 03:11:33,100
Um...

4821
03:11:33,860 --> 03:11:34,640
What is...

4822
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:35,420
Mint alignment.

4823
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:36,200
Good girl?

4824
03:11:36,300 --> 03:11:36,760
Bad girl?

4825
03:11:36,900 --> 03:11:37,420
Neutral girl?

4826
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:40,800
I think I'm a...

4827
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:43,040
I was a good girl, but I changed my mind.

4828
03:11:46,730 --> 03:11:48,930
I think I will use it just in case though.

4829
03:11:49,090 --> 03:11:50,430
We're about to go into another fight.

4830
03:11:51,130 --> 03:11:52,790
So we'll get some more rations.

4831
03:11:55,430 --> 03:11:56,350
Uh... okay.

4832
03:12:00,170 --> 03:12:01,570
Okay, that one is down.

4833
03:12:01,830 --> 03:12:02,930
It's really slow.

4834
03:12:03,650 --> 03:12:05,410
So now probably is...

4835
03:12:05,410 --> 03:12:06,830
Okay, it's going back up.

4836
03:12:06,990 --> 03:12:08,970
It's so slow.

4837
03:12:12,310 --> 03:12:13,390
This one's not so bad.

4838
03:12:15,030 --> 03:12:15,710
Nice.

4839
03:12:18,550 --> 03:12:19,230
Yippee!

4840
03:12:22,550 --> 03:12:24,410
I'm a bad girl.

4841
03:12:24,650 --> 03:12:25,650
I changed my mind.

4842
03:12:25,710 --> 03:12:27,430
I'm a bad girl now.

4843
03:12:32,390 --> 03:12:34,470
Good thing we got the grenades.

4844
03:12:47,010 --> 03:12:48,070
Who are you?

4845
03:12:48,090 --> 03:12:48,490
Who is this?

4846
03:12:48,730 --> 03:12:49,490
Who is this?

4847
03:12:52,330 --> 03:12:53,410
Deep Throat?

4848
03:12:53,670 --> 03:12:55,270
Deep Throat?

4849
03:12:56,930 --> 03:12:58,430
Never mind about that.

4850
03:12:58,690 --> 03:13:00,170
You're not using burst transmission.

4851
03:13:00,170 --> 03:13:01,470
Are you nearby?

4852
03:13:03,110 --> 03:13:05,130
There's a tank in front of your position.

4853
03:13:05,290 --> 03:13:06,490
Waiting to ambush you.

4854
03:13:06,490 --> 03:13:06,830
What?

4855
03:13:06,950 --> 03:13:07,770
Who are you anyway?

4856
03:13:08,390 --> 03:13:10,250
One of your fans.

4857
03:13:10,530 --> 03:13:10,970
Me?

4858
03:13:12,390 --> 03:13:14,170
You're one of my fans, huh?

4859
03:13:15,590 --> 03:13:16,810
I am going to save too.

4860
03:13:17,790 --> 03:13:19,270
Let's actually call Campbell too.

4861
03:13:19,390 --> 03:13:20,570
Because we didn't do that yet.

4862
03:13:20,850 --> 03:13:23,310
Colonel, I got a codec call from someone outside this operation.

4863
03:13:23,310 --> 03:13:24,610
We missed the one I guess about Meryl.

4864
03:13:24,610 --> 03:13:24,790
My bad.

4865
03:13:25,290 --> 03:13:25,990
I know.

4866
03:13:26,310 --> 03:13:27,810
We were monitoring the call.

4867
03:13:28,310 --> 03:13:30,990
Mei Ling knows everything about the communication system.

4868
03:13:31,210 --> 03:13:31,630
He's a wisp.

4869
03:13:31,630 --> 03:13:32,130
He's part of the fandom.

4870
03:13:32,130 --> 03:13:33,110
Have her explain it to you.

4871
03:13:34,250 --> 03:13:35,690
Thanks for the advice.

4872
03:13:36,630 --> 03:13:38,030
But the question is...

4873
03:13:38,030 --> 03:13:39,170
How did he learn it?

4874
03:13:39,250 --> 03:13:40,490
It's top secret information.

4875
03:13:41,370 --> 03:13:43,750
So you mean someone leaked the information.

4876
03:13:44,590 --> 03:13:46,930
And that's the only explanation I can think of.

4877
03:13:46,990 --> 03:13:48,350
Who's got my number?

4878
03:13:48,670 --> 03:13:51,390
Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from?

4879
03:13:51,450 --> 03:13:52,630
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

4880
03:13:52,810 --> 03:13:52,830
I'm sorry.

4881
03:13:53,050 --> 03:13:55,550
The radio waves were too weak to locate their source.

4882
03:13:56,110 --> 03:13:57,970
But I'm sure he's near you.

4883
03:13:58,810 --> 03:14:00,870
Snake, you'll have to go through the minefield to advance.

4884
03:14:00,870 --> 03:14:01,610
One of my fans.

4885
03:14:02,450 --> 03:14:02,930
Okay.

4886
03:14:04,350 --> 03:14:04,830
Um...

4887
03:14:05,950 --> 03:14:07,070
Hey, Master Miller.

4888
03:14:08,170 --> 03:14:11,250
Master, does the name Deep Throat mean anything to you?

4889
03:14:11,270 --> 03:14:11,570
Yeah.

4890
03:14:11,690 --> 03:14:12,290
Deep Throat?

4891
03:14:12,950 --> 03:14:13,430
What?

4892
03:14:13,550 --> 03:14:15,290
You mean the guy from Watergate?

4893
03:14:15,450 --> 03:14:15,790
No.

4894
03:14:16,090 --> 03:14:17,610
But he uses the same name.

4895
03:14:17,610 --> 03:14:17,950
No.

4896
03:14:17,950 --> 03:14:18,910
How do you know, Snake?

4897
03:14:19,010 --> 03:14:19,590
You don't know.

4898
03:14:20,110 --> 03:14:22,170
You don't know if it's the same guy from Watergate.

4899
03:14:23,270 --> 03:14:24,630
You can't say for sure.

4900
03:14:24,850 --> 03:14:25,710
You don't even know who he is.

4901
03:14:26,050 --> 03:14:27,090
He wasn't using burst transmission.

4902
03:14:27,450 --> 03:14:30,830
It seems he was transmitting from somewhere on this base.

4903
03:14:31,330 --> 03:14:32,110
Somewhere on this base?

4904
03:14:32,130 --> 03:14:32,410
Yes.

4905
03:14:34,210 --> 03:14:36,190
I have no idea who that could be.

4906
03:14:36,190 --> 03:14:39,090
Master Miller is very intrigued in this information.

4907
03:14:39,550 --> 03:14:39,990
Master Miller is very intrigued in this information.

4908
03:14:39,990 --> 03:14:42,070
He's like, who else is on the base?

4909
03:14:42,470 --> 03:14:44,190
Hey, Meryl, do you know a Deep Throat?

4910
03:14:45,050 --> 03:14:45,750
Sounds like...

4911
03:14:45,750 --> 03:14:48,070
Sounds like harassment if I ask her.

4912
03:14:48,310 --> 03:14:50,550
You'll be able to see the mines displayed on your radar.

4913
03:14:50,550 --> 03:14:52,370
Hey, Meryl, do you know Deep Throat?

4914
03:14:52,510 --> 03:14:53,930
Oh, we didn't even ask her.

4915
03:14:54,050 --> 03:14:55,790
Okay, we have some... a little bit of a...

4916
03:14:56,790 --> 03:14:58,210
We have, I guess, some...

4917
03:14:58,750 --> 03:14:59,510
Some clash.

4918
03:14:59,510 --> 03:15:05,710
After you locate the mines on your radar, crawl forward and retrieve them.

4919
03:15:05,730 --> 03:15:07,350
Oh, I'm gonna crawl forward and retrieve them.

4920
03:15:07,650 --> 03:15:10,750
...have killed over 20,000 non-combatants in the past 30 years...

4921
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:11,070
Is that real?

4922
03:15:11,390 --> 03:15:13,650
...in countries like Cambodia and Nicaragua.

4923
03:15:13,870 --> 03:15:16,010
The killing and maiming of innocent victims...

4924
03:15:16,010 --> 03:15:16,930
Master Miller will be like...

4925
03:15:16,930 --> 03:15:18,350
...continues long after the wars have ended.

4926
03:15:18,850 --> 03:15:21,050
It is easy to plant the mines, you see.

4927
03:15:21,390 --> 03:15:23,410
But removing them is a different matter.

4928
03:15:23,490 --> 03:15:24,070
She's out.

4929
03:15:24,230 --> 03:15:25,990
She was like...

4930
03:15:25,990 --> 03:15:27,450
She didn't even let us ask.

4931
03:15:27,770 --> 03:15:29,130
By the way, bombs?

4932
03:15:29,430 --> 03:15:31,650
The superpowers need to donate more mine detectors...

4933
03:15:31,650 --> 03:15:33,170
...and other equipment to remove them.

4934
03:15:33,470 --> 03:15:36,210
It is the least we could do after laying them.

4935
03:15:36,490 --> 03:15:36,770
Yeah.

4936
03:15:37,370 --> 03:15:40,530
People still find grenades and stuff to this day.

4937
03:15:40,730 --> 03:15:42,890
Which is insane to me.

4938
03:15:43,610 --> 03:15:44,010
Which is insane to me.

4939
03:15:45,090 --> 03:15:45,830
Pick up.

4940
03:15:46,110 --> 03:15:49,630
If you're one of my fans, isn't it an honor to have me call you?

4941
03:15:49,950 --> 03:15:50,530
If you're one of my fans, isn't it an honor to have me call you?

4942
03:15:50,530 --> 03:15:51,570
Wouldn't you be like, wow!

4943
03:15:53,550 --> 03:15:54,870
A minefield, huh?

4944
03:15:55,070 --> 03:15:55,090
A minefield, huh?

4945
03:15:55,990 --> 03:15:57,530
Don't forget to use your mine detector.

4946
03:15:57,870 --> 03:15:58,530
Oh, I got it.

4947
03:15:58,650 --> 03:16:01,630
When you find out where a mine is, crawl forward...

4948
03:16:01,630 --> 03:16:02,750
...and try to recover it.

4949
03:16:03,050 --> 03:16:05,950
In this game, does it matter which way I crawl towards it?

4950
03:16:07,950 --> 03:16:09,010
A minefield, huh?

4951
03:16:09,430 --> 03:16:11,730
Do I have to crawl from behind?

4952
03:16:14,090 --> 03:16:15,290
What can I do for you, Snake?

4953
03:16:16,050 --> 03:16:17,170
I'm just saving.

4954
03:16:17,370 --> 03:16:17,870
You know.

4955
03:16:26,590 --> 03:16:27,550
Don't forget to save.

4956
03:16:27,550 --> 03:16:27,750
Save!

4957
03:16:29,890 --> 03:16:31,030
Too shy to pick up.

4958
03:16:31,770 --> 03:16:32,910
Wow, the save is so fast.

4959
03:16:35,190 --> 03:16:36,050
How's it going, Snake?

4960
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:37,750
Have you gotten used to the radar yet?

4961
03:16:38,190 --> 03:16:38,750
I'm getting there.

4962
03:16:39,870 --> 03:16:42,830
Imagine if Master Milla answered, Who told you that code name?

4963
03:16:44,050 --> 03:16:45,050
Pretty convenient, huh?

4964
03:16:45,250 --> 03:16:47,210
It also makes it easy for us to see everything.

4965
03:16:47,950 --> 03:16:48,890
You're watching everything?

4966
03:16:49,230 --> 03:16:49,610
Of course.

4967
03:16:50,070 --> 03:16:52,910
If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.

4968
03:16:53,150 --> 03:16:55,650
Being monitored 24 hours a day...

4969
03:16:55,650 --> 03:16:56,950
That'd be like hell.

4970
03:16:57,550 --> 03:16:58,830
Don't think of it like that.

4971
03:16:59,090 --> 03:17:00,530
At least you'd never get lost.

4972
03:17:01,830 --> 03:17:03,430
Snake does not like being watched.

4973
03:17:04,450 --> 03:17:08,310
I'll tell you, years ago when I was in another unit, my unit's morale was at an all-time low.

4974
03:17:08,490 --> 03:17:10,270
It was up to me to boost their morale somehow.

4975
03:17:11,630 --> 03:17:12,950
What do you mean by that?

4976
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:19,030
What do you mean by that, Customer Johnson?

4977
03:17:21,910 --> 03:17:23,570
What do you mean by that?

4978
03:17:27,020 --> 03:17:27,860
Is this a mine?

4979
03:17:27,960 --> 03:17:28,080
Oh.

4980
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:29,420
Oh!

4981
03:17:31,620 --> 03:17:33,400
Holy cow, that was so close.

4982
03:17:39,320 --> 03:17:39,800
Nope,

4983
03:17:43,100 --> 03:17:43,540
turn around.

4984
03:17:46,020 --> 03:17:47,060
Just like that.

4985
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:49,820
Be a good girl.

4986
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:51,720
And then I can get up.

4987
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:53,400
And we can go this way.

4988
03:17:54,340 --> 03:17:57,260
I'm too scared to know if I have to...

4989
03:17:59,720 --> 03:18:01,700
If I have to approach them from behind or not.

4990
03:18:01,860 --> 03:18:02,340
You know what I mean?

4991
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:03,600
Spin.

4992
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:07,200
But I guess maybe not.

4993
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:09,120
Because I can get...

4994
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:10,900
These ones?

4995
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:12,400
Or...

4996
03:18:13,480 --> 03:18:13,960
Uh...

4997
03:18:13,960 --> 03:18:15,060
Just go?

4998
03:18:15,180 --> 03:18:15,600
Just get them?

4999
03:18:16,480 --> 03:18:18,120
I'm afraid of triggering the cutscene.

5000
03:18:21,460 --> 03:18:21,940
Ooh!

5001
03:18:23,580 --> 03:18:25,320
It doesn't matter in the first game.

5002
03:18:26,440 --> 03:18:26,920
So...

5003
03:18:26,920 --> 03:18:27,680
Maybe it's fine.

5004
03:18:29,500 --> 03:18:30,720
They will not go off?

5005
03:18:30,900 --> 03:18:31,180
Okay.

5006
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:32,780
I'm trusting you guys.

5007
03:18:32,920 --> 03:18:33,700
I'm trusting you guys.

5008
03:18:36,440 --> 03:18:38,000
That's so evil.

5009
03:18:44,580 --> 03:18:45,100
Okay.

5010
03:18:46,820 --> 03:18:47,340
Okay.

5011
03:18:50,100 --> 03:18:51,060
That was scary.

5012
03:18:51,940 --> 03:18:52,880
That was so scary.

5013
03:18:53,540 --> 03:18:53,980
Alright.

5014
03:18:54,080 --> 03:18:54,840
No more mind detector.

5015
03:18:55,080 --> 03:18:55,660
I think we're good.

5016
03:18:56,560 --> 03:18:57,540
Clip our rations.

5017
03:18:59,160 --> 03:19:00,040
Um... Okay.

5018
03:19:00,120 --> 03:19:01,020
How to use the grenades.

5019
03:19:01,220 --> 03:19:02,520
Press A button to hold.

5020
03:19:02,620 --> 03:19:03,380
Release to throw.

5021
03:19:03,500 --> 03:19:04,520
How long button is pressed.

5022
03:19:05,700 --> 03:19:06,840
Varies the distance.

5023
03:19:07,380 --> 03:19:08,260
And we got...

5024
03:19:08,260 --> 03:19:10,140
A couple chaff grenades.

5025
03:19:10,880 --> 03:19:11,660
Not a lot.

5026
03:19:12,720 --> 03:19:13,480
Just a few.

5027
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:17,020
But it should be enough to maybe get them stunned a couple times.

5028
03:19:18,020 --> 03:19:18,460
Oh!

5029
03:19:18,520 --> 03:19:19,500
When did we get magazines?

5030
03:19:20,820 --> 03:19:22,700
Mint Boss, I discovered you by Metal Gear.

5031
03:19:22,880 --> 03:19:24,840
When you were in heaven over a year ago and became a fan.

5032
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:27,760
I discovered a long-term health issue and had a rough time.

5033
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:31,920
Your positivity and Metal Gear brain rot helped save my life.

5034
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:32,120
Your positivity and Metal Gear brain rot helped save my life.

5035
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:33,060
Oh my gosh, George!

5036
03:19:34,880 --> 03:19:36,040
I'm glad that...

5037
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:38,000
Rather, I hope you're doing better now.

5038
03:19:38,560 --> 03:19:40,400
And I hope that...

5039
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:42,860
Or I'm glad that...

5040
03:19:42,860 --> 03:19:45,700
I was able to help out even if just a little bit.

5041
03:19:49,260 --> 03:19:50,140
I was able to help out even if just a little bit.

5042
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:50,900
Okay.

5043
03:19:59,630 --> 03:20:00,330
I don't remember...

5044
03:20:00,330 --> 03:20:01,730
How to do this fight.

5045
03:20:02,030 --> 03:20:04,350
Like I remember and I don't remember at the same time.

5046
03:20:04,510 --> 03:20:06,630
Oh my gosh, we're gonna see Vulcan Raven for the first time though.

5047
03:20:06,690 --> 03:20:07,330
This is so exciting.

5048
03:20:09,510 --> 03:20:11,190
Come on out, buddy.

5049
03:20:16,240 --> 03:20:17,780
Like you use the chaff to...

5050
03:20:18,440 --> 03:20:20,240
Distract him and then you...

5051
03:20:20,240 --> 03:20:22,380
Throw the grenade...

5052
03:20:22,380 --> 03:20:23,760
Oh my ears.

5053
03:20:24,040 --> 03:20:25,440
You throw the grenade inside.

5054
03:20:27,560 --> 03:20:28,000
Alright.

5055
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:31,920
Average VTuber enjoyer, thanks for the 10 gifted!

5056
03:20:32,260 --> 03:20:32,700
Average VTuber enjoyer, thanks for the 10 gifted!

5057
03:20:32,720 --> 03:20:33,260
My D!

5058
03:20:33,980 --> 03:20:34,660
Wow!

5059
03:20:36,260 --> 03:20:36,840
Oh!

5060
03:20:38,840 --> 03:20:40,980
This is Raven's territory.

5061
03:20:41,480 --> 03:20:41,660
Oh!

5062
03:20:43,400 --> 03:20:44,500
He's gonna say it!

5063
03:20:44,580 --> 03:20:46,360
Snakes don't belong in Alaska!

5064
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:48,720
I will not let you pass.

5065
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:50,200
He doesn't sound as cool.

5066
03:20:51,040 --> 03:20:51,720
Yeah!

5067
03:20:53,100 --> 03:20:55,700
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

5068
03:20:56,720 --> 03:20:57,400
Whoa!

5069
03:20:58,120 --> 03:21:01,600
Snake, don't just stand there.

5070
03:21:02,720 --> 03:21:03,080
I have a message.

5071
03:21:04,240 --> 03:21:05,340
Go bird, go!

5072
03:21:07,960 --> 03:21:10,600
Snake, what is wrong with you?

5073
03:21:15,900 --> 03:21:16,820
Oh my god!

5074
03:21:16,900 --> 03:21:18,300
Snake, what's wrong with you?

5075
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:20,900
That's right.

5076
03:21:21,260 --> 03:21:22,980
You belong on the ground.

5077
03:21:23,300 --> 03:21:23,680
Oh, I see.

5078
03:21:23,740 --> 03:21:24,280
I hear it now.

5079
03:21:24,420 --> 03:21:25,060
I hear it more now.

5080
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:27,860
You belong on the ground.

5081
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:29,300
I'm like a slithery snake.

5082
03:21:29,840 --> 03:21:30,960
A little snake.

5083
03:21:32,720 --> 03:21:35,920
You should crawl on the ground like the snake you are.

5084
03:21:38,380 --> 03:21:40,280
You should crawl on the ground like the snake you are.

5085
03:21:40,280 --> 03:21:42,200
Come, let's fight!

5086
03:21:43,480 --> 03:21:44,060
Okay.

5087
03:21:45,060 --> 03:21:46,540
Don't forget to shut it!

5088
03:21:48,360 --> 03:21:49,880
Yeah, don't forget to shut it, buddy.

5089
03:21:50,520 --> 03:21:51,100
Okay.

5090
03:21:51,680 --> 03:21:53,120
Let me also...

5091
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:53,620
Wait.

5092
03:21:53,860 --> 03:21:58,040
Chaff grenades, press A to aim, release, to throw.

5093
03:21:58,220 --> 03:21:58,460
Okay.

5094
03:21:58,560 --> 03:22:01,540
So we gotta get pretty close so we can...

5095
03:22:02,460 --> 03:22:04,120
We only have six, though.

5096
03:22:05,860 --> 03:22:06,340
Okay.

5097
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:08,060
Remember to punch the tank.

5098
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:08,960
Can I actually?

5099
03:22:11,560 --> 03:22:12,280
Oh my god.

5100
03:22:13,680 --> 03:22:14,160
Wait.

5101
03:22:15,780 --> 03:22:16,260
Wait.

5102
03:22:16,340 --> 03:22:17,960
Why is there a...

5103
03:22:22,860 --> 03:22:24,940
He came out to laugh at me.

5104
03:22:25,960 --> 03:22:27,200
Oh my gosh.

5105
03:22:27,780 --> 03:22:28,520
Oh my gosh.

5106
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:29,600
I wish I could cartwheel right now.

5107
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:29,900
No!

5108
03:22:30,340 --> 03:22:31,100
Oh my god.

5109
03:22:31,300 --> 03:22:32,940
Okay, I'm just gonna throw the chaff grenade.

5110
03:22:33,660 --> 03:22:34,940
Oh gosh, please!

5111
03:22:35,320 --> 03:22:36,980
I don't know if I... Okay, I threw it.

5112
03:22:37,420 --> 03:22:37,820
Nice.

5113
03:22:40,020 --> 03:22:40,780
I'm dying.

5114
03:22:48,170 --> 03:22:48,570
Ouch.

5115
03:22:49,470 --> 03:22:50,610
I don't know where I threw it.

5116
03:22:53,890 --> 03:22:54,690
To the...

5117
03:22:55,350 --> 03:22:56,610
You don't... Do not.

5118
03:22:56,670 --> 03:22:57,210
Do not.

5119
03:22:57,310 --> 03:22:57,850
Do not.

5120
03:22:59,110 --> 03:22:59,510
Ow!

5121
03:23:00,190 --> 03:23:00,630
Ow!

5122
03:23:00,990 --> 03:23:01,730
Oh my god.

5123
03:23:01,790 --> 03:23:02,110
Snake.

5124
03:23:04,450 --> 03:23:05,470
Where did he go?

5125
03:23:05,670 --> 03:23:06,110
Okay.

5126
03:23:06,410 --> 03:23:07,870
Oh god!

5127
03:23:08,010 --> 03:23:08,930
I'm stuck inside the hole!

5128
03:23:10,650 --> 03:23:11,090
What?

5129
03:23:11,210 --> 03:23:12,390
Oh no, he's gonna run me over.

5130
03:23:14,210 --> 03:23:15,250
He's gonna run me...

5131
03:23:17,170 --> 03:23:18,890
Why did you throw it that way?

5132
03:23:22,630 --> 03:23:23,470
Get that guy.

5133
03:23:25,970 --> 03:23:27,670
There we go.

5134
03:23:29,510 --> 03:23:29,690
Yeah, yeah.

5135
03:23:29,710 --> 03:23:30,050
There we go.

5136
03:23:30,150 --> 03:23:30,390
There we go.

5137
03:23:37,510 --> 03:23:38,070
And... Nice.

5138
03:23:40,530 --> 03:23:40,970
I think.

5139
03:23:42,450 --> 03:23:43,210
Actually, I'm not sure.

5140
03:23:44,230 --> 03:23:44,510
Actually,

5141
03:23:54,080 --> 03:23:55,080
I don't know if that worked.

5142
03:24:00,850 --> 03:24:01,690
Come here, gunner one.

5143
03:24:04,870 --> 03:24:05,150
Oh!

5144
03:24:08,760 --> 03:24:09,040
Nice.

5145
03:24:12,320 --> 03:24:12,880
Oh god!

5146
03:24:12,980 --> 03:24:13,500
Please, snake!

5147
03:24:13,520 --> 03:24:13,760
Please!

5148
03:24:14,200 --> 03:24:14,680
Oh my god.

5149
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:15,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5150
03:24:17,200 --> 03:24:17,680
Ohhhhhhh!

5151
03:24:19,420 --> 03:24:19,900
Laowie!

5152
03:24:23,610 --> 03:24:24,270
Oh my god.

5153
03:24:24,310 --> 03:24:24,930
Snake, please!

5154
03:24:28,070 --> 03:24:29,770
Oh my god.

5155
03:24:29,770 --> 03:24:29,770
Snake, please!

5156
03:24:29,770 --> 03:24:30,850
Oh, that did not work.

5157
03:24:46,060 --> 03:24:46,820
Oh, that did not work.

5158
03:24:46,900 --> 03:24:47,760
Oh, gunner two!

5159
03:24:48,340 --> 03:24:49,000
Oh, gunner two!

5160
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:50,740
Oh, I pressed it but it didn't work.

5161
03:24:50,840 --> 03:24:51,420
Okay, that's fine.

5162
03:24:52,200 --> 03:24:54,320
I don't think it registered because he was loading.

5163
03:24:54,860 --> 03:24:55,340
Ha!

5164
03:24:57,560 --> 03:24:59,640
It lands right in his lap!

5165
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:02,080
It lands right in his lap!

5166
03:25:02,080 --> 03:25:02,420
It lands right in his lap!

5167
03:25:03,740 --> 03:25:04,700
It's so funny.

5168
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:06,220
Ha, ha, ha.

5169
03:25:07,980 --> 03:25:09,440
He's like holding on to it.

5170
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:11,340
Oh, we have to wait for him to come back up.

5171
03:25:11,560 --> 03:25:12,180
Okay, there we go.

5172
03:25:12,380 --> 03:25:13,460
Alright, come back mister.

5173
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:14,740
Oh, yeah.

5174
03:25:16,180 --> 03:25:17,160
Don't run me over.

5175
03:25:17,340 --> 03:25:18,200
Don't run me over.

5176
03:25:18,900 --> 03:25:19,260
Oh!

5177
03:25:21,200 --> 03:25:22,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5178
03:25:22,380 --> 03:25:22,660
Oh gosh.

5179
03:25:22,860 --> 03:25:24,080
We only have one ration left.

5180
03:25:24,480 --> 03:25:24,600
Ha!

5181
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:27,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

5182
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:28,280
Oh my god.

5183
03:25:28,340 --> 03:25:28,960
Get up, snake.

5184
03:25:30,260 --> 03:25:32,580
Okay, I'm gonna chop grenade real quick.

5185
03:25:33,360 --> 03:25:35,080
So that we can, um...

5186
03:25:36,940 --> 03:25:37,580
Oh my gosh.

5187
03:25:37,720 --> 03:25:39,060
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

5188
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:40,320
Where's some rations?

5189
03:25:40,500 --> 03:25:40,860
Please.

5190
03:25:41,320 --> 03:25:41,980
Please, rations.

5191
03:25:42,200 --> 03:25:42,940
Oh, no, no, no.

5192
03:25:42,980 --> 03:25:43,560
There's no rations.

5193
03:25:45,020 --> 03:25:46,200
Oh no, there's no rations.

5194
03:25:46,820 --> 03:25:48,180
Okay, that's not good.

5195
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:49,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

5196
03:25:56,020 --> 03:25:56,380
Uh...

5197
03:25:56,380 --> 03:26:02,600
I know I might be wasting them but I don't want them to get me with the...

5198
03:26:07,670 --> 03:26:08,430
I'm about dead.

5199
03:26:08,650 --> 03:26:09,230
I'm gonna die.

5200
03:26:09,310 --> 03:26:10,830
I'm gonna die for real.

5201
03:26:11,310 --> 03:26:12,470
Where are the rations?

5202
03:26:15,550 --> 03:26:16,070
Um...

5203
03:26:17,510 --> 03:26:18,370
I'm gonna die!

5204
03:26:28,070 --> 03:26:30,290
If he gets me one more time, I'm dead.

5205
03:26:31,770 --> 03:26:32,290
Boo!

5206
03:26:34,610 --> 03:26:35,450
I can't... Oh.

5207
03:26:35,830 --> 03:26:37,050
Uh, yeah, that's fine actually.

5208
03:26:47,140 --> 03:26:47,940
So unfair.

5209
03:26:48,640 --> 03:26:50,380
This is so unfair!

5210
03:26:53,280 --> 03:26:54,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

5211
03:26:56,820 --> 03:26:57,940
Oh, that was a nice hit.

5212
03:26:59,960 --> 03:27:00,280
Ha!

5213
03:27:02,280 --> 03:27:03,700
Oh, dang it, he's not there yet.

5214
03:27:04,880 --> 03:27:05,200
There

5215
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:10,140
are no rations.

5216
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:11,680
I'm gonna die again.

5217
03:27:11,800 --> 03:27:12,100
Please.

5218
03:27:26,850 --> 03:27:27,490
So unfair.

5219
03:27:27,970 --> 03:27:28,850
This is so unfair!

5220
03:27:30,410 --> 03:27:31,510
Oh, la, la, la, la, la.

5221
03:27:43,240 --> 03:27:43,760
Don't get me.

5222
03:27:44,680 --> 03:27:45,240
Don't get me.

5223
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:46,480
Don't get me.

5224
03:27:46,900 --> 03:27:47,460
Don't get me.

5225
03:27:48,340 --> 03:27:48,900
Don't... Ah!

5226
03:27:51,210 --> 03:27:52,150
Oh my god, he just...

5227
03:27:52,150 --> 03:27:53,550
Oh, there he is, there he is.

5228
03:27:53,630 --> 03:27:54,190
Nice, nice, nice.

5229
03:27:54,990 --> 03:27:55,390
Ah!

5230
03:28:00,640 --> 03:28:01,440
Oh, we...

5231
03:28:01,440 --> 03:28:03,760
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

5232
03:28:03,760 --> 03:28:05,000
La, la, la, la, la, la...

5233
03:28:12,040 --> 03:28:13,520
We were so close.

5234
03:28:15,460 --> 03:28:17,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

5235
03:28:17,420 --> 03:28:18,820
Last time I did that fight...

5236
03:28:19,620 --> 03:28:22,320
I don't wanna brag, but I did it in one try.

5237
03:28:26,980 --> 03:28:27,380
Two!

5238
03:28:32,330 --> 03:28:33,710
That was too early.

5239
03:28:34,010 --> 03:28:34,950
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

5240
03:28:37,510 --> 03:28:38,310
Stop it!

5241
03:28:38,870 --> 03:28:39,270
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

5242
03:28:49,220 --> 03:28:50,100
Oh, wait.

5243
03:28:50,260 --> 03:28:50,420
Oh!

5244
03:28:50,520 --> 03:28:52,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

5245
03:28:52,620 --> 03:28:54,740
You wasted all the time laughing at me!

5246
03:28:56,040 --> 03:28:57,060
This is so unfair.

5247
03:28:57,580 --> 03:28:58,660
That's so unfair!

5248
03:28:59,320 --> 03:29:00,320
I can't believe!

5249
03:29:01,060 --> 03:29:02,460
That is so unfair!

5250
03:29:03,100 --> 03:29:03,920
No way!

5251
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:06,080
Okay, well, I'm here now, I guess.

5252
03:29:06,980 --> 03:29:08,240
Oh my God!

5253
03:29:17,560 --> 03:29:17,980
That's right!

5254
03:29:18,900 --> 03:29:20,740
And then he goes inside for a second.

5255
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:24,260
Come back out!

5256
03:29:24,360 --> 03:29:24,600
Oh, wait.

5257
03:29:24,680 --> 03:29:25,940
I'm gonna lose my health.

5258
03:29:31,450 --> 03:29:31,990
Oh my God!

5259
03:29:32,010 --> 03:29:32,610
Don't run me over!

5260
03:29:33,370 --> 03:29:33,990
You know what?

5261
03:29:33,990 --> 03:29:34,230
It's fine.

5262
03:29:34,350 --> 03:29:35,310
Wait, did he go back in?

5263
03:29:35,810 --> 03:29:37,310
You son of a jerk!

5264
03:29:38,150 --> 03:29:38,510
You...

5265
03:29:40,890 --> 03:29:41,750
You poopy hole!

5266
03:29:43,890 --> 03:29:46,350
Yeah, let it... I just ran right into that.

5267
03:30:18,320 --> 03:30:18,960
There we go.

5268
03:30:24,280 --> 03:30:24,960
Oh, no!

5269
03:30:26,400 --> 03:30:26,820
When

5270
03:30:35,390 --> 03:30:37,010
I got shot, it...

5271
03:30:37,830 --> 03:30:40,330
Oh my gosh, the way it lands in his lap is so funny.

5272
03:30:40,690 --> 03:30:42,690
When I got shot, it made me drop my grenade.

5273
03:30:42,870 --> 03:30:43,650
That's so messed up.

5274
03:30:48,200 --> 03:30:49,600
No, that's the wrong way.

5275
03:30:52,200 --> 03:30:53,280
That's the wrong way.

5276
03:30:56,440 --> 03:30:57,220
No, no, no.

5277
03:30:57,420 --> 03:30:58,420
I'm waiting for my...

5278
03:31:00,260 --> 03:31:01,440
Don't shoot me, please.

5279
03:31:04,820 --> 03:31:06,740
This is so...

5280
03:31:07,940 --> 03:31:08,380
Oh!

5281
03:31:08,380 --> 03:31:08,820
No!

5282
03:31:11,520 --> 03:31:12,800
Gotta fix my contact.

5283
03:31:16,590 --> 03:31:17,250
Thank you.

5284
03:31:18,510 --> 03:31:21,310
The voice is the same as Robin from Teen Titans.

5285
03:31:21,490 --> 03:31:21,830
No way!

5286
03:31:23,710 --> 03:31:24,150
Really?

5287
03:31:37,600 --> 03:31:38,760
Oh my God, he's gonna run!

5288
03:31:49,590 --> 03:31:50,510
Oh, no, no, no!

5289
03:31:50,550 --> 03:31:50,770
Get up!

5290
03:31:50,810 --> 03:31:50,970
Get up!

5291
03:31:51,010 --> 03:31:51,130
Get up!

5292
03:31:52,370 --> 03:31:57,070
Where did... Why did you turn around?

5293
03:31:58,110 --> 03:31:58,550
Haha!

5294
03:32:02,320 --> 03:32:02,740
This is...

5295
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:04,440
I miss Ocelot fight.

5296
03:32:08,260 --> 03:32:10,260
The way it lands in his lap.

5297
03:32:11,020 --> 03:32:11,620
Okay.

5298
03:32:12,420 --> 03:32:15,420
He's down, but also so are we, basically.

5299
03:32:15,460 --> 03:32:17,540
We are so not looking good.

5300
03:32:17,880 --> 03:32:19,720
Why are there...

5301
03:32:19,720 --> 03:32:21,040
It does sound like Robin!

5302
03:32:21,400 --> 03:32:22,520
You're... It is Robin!

5303
03:32:29,660 --> 03:32:30,260
Um...

5304
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:44,060
Still got two rations.

5305
03:32:46,900 --> 03:32:47,800
Oh, no, no, no, no!

5306
03:32:47,840 --> 03:32:49,020
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

5307
03:32:49,140 --> 03:32:49,700
It's okay, though.

5308
03:32:50,140 --> 03:32:50,720
It's okay, though.

5309
03:32:56,830 --> 03:32:57,590
Oh, no, no, no, no.

5310
03:32:57,610 --> 03:32:57,990
I dropped it.

5311
03:32:58,030 --> 03:32:58,410
I dropped it.

5312
03:33:04,580 --> 03:33:04,860
Shoot!

5313
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:05,580
Shoot!

5314
03:33:05,740 --> 03:33:06,200
This way!

5315
03:33:12,060 --> 03:33:12,980
Don't run over me.

5316
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:15,400
Why is this fight so stupid?

5317
03:33:16,440 --> 03:33:16,720
Please!

5318
03:33:16,720 --> 03:33:17,780
Snake, just throw it in there!

5319
03:33:20,260 --> 03:33:20,540
No!

5320
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:23,660
There we go.

5321
03:33:24,400 --> 03:33:24,960
Yes, yes, yes.

5322
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:25,940
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

5323
03:33:26,460 --> 03:33:27,220
Run, run, run.

5324
03:33:27,220 --> 03:33:27,640
Run, run.

5325
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:28,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5326
03:33:28,740 --> 03:33:29,480
There we go.

5327
03:33:29,680 --> 03:33:30,940
I'm gonna... I'm gonna die.

5328
03:33:31,160 --> 03:33:31,540
I'm gonna...

5329
03:33:31,540 --> 03:33:35,140
I dropped the grenade again.

5330
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:37,700
Let's go get some more...

5331
03:33:43,360 --> 03:33:44,880
More grenades, please.

5332
03:33:46,400 --> 03:33:47,140
Thank you.

5333
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:50,600
Where are you?

5334
03:33:51,840 --> 03:33:52,360
Where's...

5335
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:54,520
You think it would be easier finding a tank?

5336
03:33:56,600 --> 03:33:57,120
Golly!

5337
03:33:57,600 --> 03:33:58,440
Whoa, Molly!

5338
03:33:59,840 --> 03:34:00,360
What?

5339
03:34:00,600 --> 03:34:01,000
And...

5340
03:34:01,430 --> 03:34:01,740
Shoot!

5341
03:34:02,820 --> 03:34:03,920
Oh my god!

5342
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:06,120
This hurts so much.

5343
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:07,020
No!

5344
03:34:07,220 --> 03:34:07,580
What?

5345
03:34:07,780 --> 03:34:08,980
That didn't get in him?

5346
03:34:09,280 --> 03:34:14,930
Someone said to crawl in here.

5347
03:34:15,310 --> 03:34:16,570
What happens if I do?

5348
03:34:16,750 --> 03:34:17,730
Is there another...

5349
03:34:19,290 --> 03:34:20,890
There's just ammo in here.

5350
03:34:20,990 --> 03:34:21,610
There's no...

5351
03:34:24,730 --> 03:34:25,750
There's no...

5352
03:34:25,750 --> 03:34:27,430
There's no ration in here.

5353
03:34:31,990 --> 03:34:34,410
There's only ammo in here.

5354
03:34:37,670 --> 03:34:40,750
You're not supposed to get run over by the tank.

5355
03:34:57,760 --> 03:35:00,300
Aren't you supposed to run out of bullets at some point?

5356
03:35:02,700 --> 03:35:04,200
I pressed A.

5357
03:35:04,420 --> 03:35:05,000
Please.

5358
03:35:10,310 --> 03:35:12,090
Why didn't that work?

5359
03:35:12,970 --> 03:35:14,630
No, Snake, please.

5360
03:35:15,670 --> 03:35:17,150
Why didn't that work?

5361
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:22,240
Why?

5362
03:35:33,700 --> 03:35:35,360
What are these cutscenes?

5363
03:35:36,220 --> 03:35:39,260
What are these cutscenes that are killing me?

5364
03:35:40,820 --> 03:35:42,260
I don't understand.

5365
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:46,680
I keep thinking that the cutscene means that it's hitting him, but it's not.

5366
03:35:47,180 --> 03:35:48,580
I don't understand.

5367
03:35:49,940 --> 03:35:51,820
Oh my goodness.

5368
03:35:59,660 --> 03:36:01,400
I wish there was some more.

5369
03:36:02,880 --> 03:36:05,720
Does the stun grenade help so much?

5370
03:36:05,860 --> 03:36:07,900
I see that they're suggesting it.

5371
03:36:09,380 --> 03:36:11,680
Why don't they give any rations, though?

5372
03:36:13,620 --> 03:36:15,120
The game says, get good.

5373
03:36:15,580 --> 03:36:16,180
Truly.

5374
03:36:20,310 --> 03:36:23,150
The game just says, get good, loser.

5375
03:36:29,100 --> 03:36:30,240
I hate this.

5376
03:36:30,860 --> 03:36:31,460
I...

5377
03:36:33,520 --> 03:36:35,120
Why do you show me that?

5378
03:36:42,630 --> 03:36:43,710
Oh, there it is.

5379
03:36:43,750 --> 03:36:44,110
There it is.

5380
03:36:44,110 --> 03:36:44,430
There it is.

5381
03:36:44,510 --> 03:36:45,490
In his little lap.

5382
03:36:46,710 --> 03:36:47,130
What?

5383
03:36:49,070 --> 03:36:50,810
But it showed it in his lap!

5384
03:37:09,650 --> 03:37:11,810
Or just get hit immediately again.

5385
03:37:11,970 --> 03:37:12,590
That's okay, too.

5386
03:37:14,430 --> 03:37:14,850
Shoot!

5387
03:37:17,430 --> 03:37:17,850
Shoot!

5388
03:37:19,590 --> 03:37:20,190
Right there.

5389
03:37:20,290 --> 03:37:20,630
No!

5390
03:37:20,630 --> 03:37:21,290
Oh!

5391
03:37:22,770 --> 03:37:23,190
Oh!

5392
03:37:23,190 --> 03:37:24,090
Now it worked.

5393
03:37:24,970 --> 03:37:25,390
Yeah!

5394
03:37:39,200 --> 03:37:41,520
Why are you saying, Vince, die, die, die?

5395
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:42,340
What do you mean?

5396
03:37:43,680 --> 03:37:47,760
The cutscene you keep seeing is when a grenade destroys a tank tread.

5397
03:37:50,880 --> 03:37:52,800
There's so many ways to do this, but she's stubborn.

5398
03:37:52,900 --> 03:37:57,700
Hey, this is the way that I've always done, you know?

5399
03:37:59,040 --> 03:38:00,560
And, yeah, I am stubborn.

5400
03:38:00,680 --> 03:38:01,220
What of it?

5401
03:38:05,140 --> 03:38:05,460
What?

5402
03:38:11,380 --> 03:38:13,740
Oh, he's doing sick wheelies.

5403
03:38:15,400 --> 03:38:15,720
Okay.

5404
03:38:16,320 --> 03:38:16,880
Get up.

5405
03:38:17,160 --> 03:38:17,620
Get out.

5406
03:38:25,250 --> 03:38:25,830
You know what?

5407
03:38:25,850 --> 03:38:28,210
That's how every Metal Gear game is, actually.

5408
03:38:28,330 --> 03:38:28,990
There's... Oh, my God.

5409
03:38:29,010 --> 03:38:29,470
No, please.

5410
03:38:29,950 --> 03:38:30,270
Oh!

5411
03:38:30,710 --> 03:38:31,410
But... Okay.

5412
03:38:31,570 --> 03:38:31,850
Okay.

5413
03:38:31,870 --> 03:38:32,310
I see it.

5414
03:38:32,350 --> 03:38:33,070
I get it now.

5415
03:38:34,190 --> 03:38:36,050
It kind of makes it so it... Oh, shit.

5416
03:38:36,250 --> 03:38:37,090
Oh, no, no, no.

5417
03:38:37,130 --> 03:38:37,890
No, no, no, no, no, no.

5418
03:38:38,650 --> 03:38:41,030
It makes it so it's harder for it to move.

5419
03:38:41,170 --> 03:38:41,570
I get it.

5420
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:46,880
What?

5421
03:38:47,460 --> 03:38:48,680
Where did that come from?

5422
03:38:51,180 --> 03:38:52,660
It just completely rolled.

5423
03:38:58,560 --> 03:38:59,860
Punch the tank.

5424
03:39:00,500 --> 03:39:01,000
Okay.

5425
03:39:01,100 --> 03:39:02,020
I'll punch the tank.

5426
03:39:12,290 --> 03:39:17,950
I did so well every time I fought this dang thing in the original.

5427
03:39:18,550 --> 03:39:19,790
I truly...

5428
03:39:19,790 --> 03:39:20,150
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5429
03:39:21,170 --> 03:39:23,370
I'm only gonna... I'm just gonna say...

5430
03:39:24,710 --> 03:39:28,030
I'm gonna... I'm gonna chalk it up to performance anxiety.

5431
03:39:28,450 --> 03:39:29,490
That's all I can say.

5432
03:39:30,330 --> 03:39:33,990
That's all I can... You know, I can believe in what really...

5433
03:39:33,990 --> 03:39:35,250
Oh, my God.

5434
03:39:37,820 --> 03:39:43,800
Maybe because I'm playing it the way that I have been in... What's it called?

5435
03:39:43,920 --> 03:39:44,560
In the original?

5436
03:39:44,600 --> 03:39:46,560
But, like, this is still so similar.

5437
03:39:46,720 --> 03:39:48,160
So, it's... You know.

5438
03:39:57,880 --> 03:39:58,800
Just CQC it.

5439
03:39:58,880 --> 03:39:59,720
Does that actually work?

5440
03:39:59,800 --> 03:40:01,040
I can't tell if you guys are trolling me.

5441
03:40:06,770 --> 03:40:07,370
Where'd you go?

5442
03:40:25,170 --> 03:40:26,130
Right in his lap.

5443
03:40:27,130 --> 03:40:28,250
Like Santa Claus.

5444
03:40:29,070 --> 03:40:30,250
We're only on gunner one.

5445
03:40:32,210 --> 03:40:32,810
Oh, gosh.

5446
03:40:32,990 --> 03:40:33,210
Oh, gosh.

5447
03:40:47,780 --> 03:40:48,540
Round two.

5448
03:40:49,940 --> 03:40:51,060
Come on, gunner two.

5449
03:40:51,200 --> 03:40:52,100
See how you like this.

5450
03:40:52,380 --> 03:40:52,880
Thanks, Robin.

5451
03:41:08,900 --> 03:41:09,340
Wow.

5452
03:41:09,340 --> 03:41:10,520
That did big damage.

5453
03:41:35,420 --> 03:41:36,220
Can you move?

5454
03:41:38,040 --> 03:41:39,200
Stop capping me.

5455
03:41:39,360 --> 03:41:40,840
Why are you so obsessed with me?

5456
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:45,020
Stop capping me.

5457
03:41:45,460 --> 03:41:45,820
Okay, we're going.

5458
03:41:46,280 --> 03:41:46,920
Up, up, up.

5459
03:41:47,320 --> 03:41:48,020
Go, go, go.

5460
03:41:48,560 --> 03:41:49,340
Run, run, run.

5461
03:41:51,340 --> 03:41:52,940
Oh, I only have four grenades left.

5462
03:41:53,580 --> 03:41:54,020
Please.

5463
03:41:56,120 --> 03:41:56,720
Nice.

5464
03:42:00,650 --> 03:42:01,250
Nice.

5465
03:42:02,970 --> 03:42:03,570
I

5466
03:42:21,350 --> 03:42:22,250
need more grenades.

5467
03:42:26,870 --> 03:42:27,590
Don't follow me.

5468
03:42:30,410 --> 03:42:31,850
No, not trap grenades.

5469
03:42:32,290 --> 03:42:33,230
Regular grenades.

5470
03:42:33,710 --> 03:42:35,030
Oh, grenade, grenade.

5471
03:42:36,230 --> 03:42:38,050
I need more grenade, grenade.

5472
03:42:38,510 --> 03:42:39,270
There we go.

5473
03:42:46,680 --> 03:42:47,580
Santa Claus.

5474
03:42:47,580 --> 03:42:47,980
Santa Claus.

5475
03:42:51,660 --> 03:42:52,060
Wait.

5476
03:42:52,300 --> 03:42:53,220
Is it going to explode?

5477
03:42:53,560 --> 03:42:54,660
Did it already explode?

5478
03:42:55,580 --> 03:42:55,980
Oh.

5479
03:42:58,340 --> 03:42:58,740
Okay,

5480
03:43:18,820 --> 03:43:19,960
I'm going to go punch the tank.

5481
03:43:20,100 --> 03:43:20,780
I'll punch the tank.

5482
03:43:20,980 --> 03:43:22,160
You guys want me to punch the tank?

5483
03:43:22,200 --> 03:43:22,900
I'll go punch the tank.

5484
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:25,840
CQC to flip the tank.

5485
03:43:26,380 --> 03:43:28,320
I wouldn't believe it in this game, truly.

5486
03:43:40,090 --> 03:43:43,010
He's so... Oh my god, he's aiming right at me.

5487
03:43:43,310 --> 03:43:44,530
This is so funny.

5488
03:43:44,890 --> 03:43:45,450
Okay.

5489
03:43:45,870 --> 03:43:46,930
Beat up the tank!

5490
03:43:48,490 --> 03:43:49,050
Ouch!

5491
03:43:50,490 --> 03:43:52,030
You guys, it didn't work.

5492
03:43:54,190 --> 03:43:55,190
It didn't...

5493
03:44:01,980 --> 03:44:04,220
You guys, it didn't work.

5494
03:44:06,800 --> 03:44:08,280
Hold on, my chat froze.

5495
03:44:09,340 --> 03:44:10,180
Oh, my chat froze.

5496
03:44:10,180 --> 03:44:11,080
My tap just crashed.

5497
03:44:12,060 --> 03:44:13,260
No, I'll just do this.

5498
03:44:13,640 --> 03:44:14,480
Give me a second.

5499
03:44:15,320 --> 03:44:16,340
I almost died!

5500
03:44:17,820 --> 03:44:19,840
You guys, how could you lie to me?

5501
03:44:21,480 --> 03:44:22,660
How could you do that?

5502
03:44:23,600 --> 03:44:25,000
How could you lie to me?

5503
03:44:26,880 --> 03:44:28,480
You CQC'd the chat instead?

5504
03:44:28,900 --> 03:44:29,780
Okay, I think we're good.

5505
03:44:32,880 --> 03:44:33,640
Where is he?

5506
03:44:33,980 --> 03:44:35,220
Hold on, I'm going to go this way.

5507
03:44:37,380 --> 03:44:38,300
There it is.

5508
03:44:38,680 --> 03:44:39,040
No!

5509
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:39,340
No!

5510
03:44:39,400 --> 03:44:39,580
No!

5511
03:44:39,920 --> 03:44:40,420
Hold on!

5512
03:44:40,540 --> 03:44:41,180
Don't cap me!

5513
03:44:41,280 --> 03:44:41,780
Don't cap me!

5514
03:44:42,400 --> 03:44:43,640
Let me get out of here first.

5515
03:44:48,630 --> 03:44:48,990
Okay.

5516
03:44:49,050 --> 03:44:49,810
We're so close.

5517
03:44:49,950 --> 03:44:50,970
We just got to do it.

5518
03:44:51,870 --> 03:44:52,990
We just got to beat him.

5519
03:44:53,690 --> 03:44:54,450
Up and away!

5520
03:45:07,780 --> 03:45:10,480
Sorry, Robin.

5521
03:45:16,740 --> 03:45:17,540
Why are you...

5522
03:45:17,540 --> 03:45:18,700
It's gonna explode.

5523
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:19,240
It's gonna explode, Snake!

5524
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:20,040
It's gonna explode!

5525
03:45:26,480 --> 03:45:27,820
No way, he's walking.

5526
03:45:48,760 --> 03:45:51,100
Oh my god, what a dummy.

5527
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:54,800
Oh, nice.

5528
03:45:55,340 --> 03:45:56,200
Number three.

5529
03:45:58,160 --> 03:45:58,760
Wow.

5530
03:46:00,360 --> 03:46:00,960
Wow.

5531
03:46:02,400 --> 03:46:03,920
Wait, Vulcan Raven...

5532
03:46:10,020 --> 03:46:10,440
How

5533
03:46:13,630 --> 03:46:15,370
are you still alive?

5534
03:46:22,430 --> 03:46:23,690
A buffoon.

5535
03:46:35,590 --> 03:46:36,310
From your what?

5536
03:46:36,570 --> 03:46:40,670
General Ivan, I hear that you lost your arm and ran away home.

5537
03:46:41,170 --> 03:46:43,070
Watch your tongue, Shaman.

5538
03:46:43,430 --> 03:46:44,190
Thank you!

5539
03:46:44,310 --> 03:46:47,530
In the language of the Sioux people, Sioux means snake.

5540
03:46:47,650 --> 03:46:47,990
Snake.

5541
03:46:48,070 --> 03:46:50,270
It is known as an animal to be feared.

5542
03:46:51,530 --> 03:46:53,450
Well, Snake is mine now.

5543
03:46:54,030 --> 03:46:58,190
When I meet him next, I'll take special care of him.

5544
03:46:58,290 --> 03:46:59,570
Oh yes, you will.

5545
03:46:59,930 --> 03:47:00,050
Not yet.

5546
03:47:00,350 --> 03:47:01,630
Oh, never mind.

5547
03:47:01,830 --> 03:47:02,490
Don't kill him yet.

5548
03:47:03,110 --> 03:47:05,290
He and I will meet again.

5549
03:47:06,250 --> 03:47:07,350
Yes, we will.

5550
03:47:09,890 --> 03:47:11,050
Sioux snake.

5551
03:47:11,390 --> 03:47:12,810
Yes, the raven on my head.

5552
03:47:13,370 --> 03:47:15,730
It thirsts for his blood.

5553
03:47:17,070 --> 03:47:17,410
Kaka!

5554
03:47:21,010 --> 03:47:21,350
Yeah!

5555
03:47:22,130 --> 03:47:23,630
I love Vulcan Raven.

5556
03:47:23,770 --> 03:47:24,370
He's so cool.

5557
03:47:25,550 --> 03:47:27,490
Thirst for his blood.

5558
03:47:32,810 --> 03:47:34,130
Wait, can I go back out?

5559
03:47:35,810 --> 03:47:37,210
I kinda wanna get some more stuff.

5560
03:47:37,430 --> 03:47:38,590
Wait, are the cameras gonna be here though?

5561
03:47:39,490 --> 03:47:40,330
Actually, I don't remember.

5562
03:47:41,810 --> 03:47:42,930
When did the camera show up?

5563
03:47:45,610 --> 03:47:47,150
Not quite yet.

5564
03:47:47,210 --> 03:47:47,610
Cool.

5565
03:47:48,490 --> 03:47:49,570
But, are there mines?

5566
03:47:49,730 --> 03:47:50,550
I don't think so.

5567
03:47:53,510 --> 03:47:53,950
Grenade.

5568
03:47:56,490 --> 03:47:57,370
Anything else?

5569
03:47:58,950 --> 03:48:01,230
That guy didn't even leave anything either.

5570
03:48:03,330 --> 03:48:03,770
Chaffs.

5571
03:48:05,330 --> 03:48:09,250
Which we will need lots and lots of later on.

5572
03:48:10,670 --> 03:48:12,090
Oh, this is all back too.

5573
03:48:12,290 --> 03:48:12,750
Nice.

5574
03:48:13,470 --> 03:48:13,950
Grenade.

5575
03:48:14,950 --> 03:48:17,270
Doesn't hurt to stock back up on some things.

5576
03:48:17,370 --> 03:48:17,650
Right!

5577
03:48:18,390 --> 03:48:19,870
Is there anything under the tank?

5578
03:48:24,750 --> 03:48:26,230
Can we even go under the tank?

5579
03:48:26,850 --> 03:48:27,330
Spin.

5580
03:48:28,210 --> 03:48:28,690
Nope.

5581
03:48:36,340 --> 03:48:37,200
Any goodies?

5582
03:48:38,780 --> 03:48:40,060
Things for me to collect?

5583
03:48:42,240 --> 03:48:43,760
Anything that I missed out on?

5584
03:48:44,660 --> 03:48:45,680
I don't think so.

5585
03:48:46,520 --> 03:48:49,100
Mei Ling would tell me that I am a fool right now.

5586
03:48:52,040 --> 03:48:53,580
Was that there the whole time?

5587
03:48:55,860 --> 03:48:57,840
But, I did so well on that last one.

5588
03:48:57,900 --> 03:48:58,840
We have 5 out of 5.

5589
03:48:59,060 --> 03:49:00,060
I didn't even use any.

5590
03:49:00,340 --> 03:49:01,880
So, take that.

5591
03:49:02,720 --> 03:49:03,120
Game.

5592
03:49:04,820 --> 03:49:06,160
Speaking of Mei Ling.

5593
03:49:06,660 --> 03:49:07,260
Let's save.

5594
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:11,920
Save.

5595
03:49:13,440 --> 03:49:14,160
Thank you!

5596
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:16,580
Just giving him the card like that.

5597
03:49:16,620 --> 03:49:20,520
Implying Robin flying out to the tank and landing in front of Snake was plaid.

5598
03:49:20,620 --> 03:49:21,200
I know.

5599
03:49:22,940 --> 03:49:23,380
Right!

5600
03:49:24,180 --> 03:49:24,800
We'll save complete.

5601
03:49:24,880 --> 03:49:25,140
There we go.

5602
03:49:25,220 --> 03:49:25,480
Okay.

5603
03:49:28,120 --> 03:49:32,560
Snake, have you ever heard the saying, friendly counsel cuts off many foes?

5604
03:49:32,680 --> 03:49:32,900
No.

5605
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:36,620
It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble.

5606
03:49:36,800 --> 03:49:37,240
I know.

5607
03:49:37,240 --> 03:49:38,640
You should think about it.

5608
03:49:38,900 --> 03:49:44,720
If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else.

5609
03:49:44,960 --> 03:49:45,360
Okay?

5610
03:49:46,020 --> 03:49:46,420
Yeah.

5611
03:49:46,640 --> 03:49:47,360
Thank you.

5612
03:49:47,500 --> 03:49:47,680
Oh.

5613
03:49:48,380 --> 03:49:48,780
Okay.

5614
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:51,260
That is so...

5615
03:49:51,260 --> 03:49:51,680
Oh my gosh.

5616
03:49:51,700 --> 03:49:52,160
That's so true.

5617
03:49:52,340 --> 03:49:53,320
Last night, I don't know.

5618
03:49:53,900 --> 03:49:54,700
Like recently?

5619
03:49:54,940 --> 03:49:55,840
Well, I don't know.

5620
03:49:55,860 --> 03:50:01,100
Ever since I came back, I've been feeling like kind of a little overwhelmed.

5621
03:50:01,140 --> 03:50:03,180
I feel like I'm kind of like a little...

5622
03:50:06,120 --> 03:50:07,220
There's just been a lot going on.

5623
03:50:07,220 --> 03:50:09,780
That I'm like, oh my gosh, I don't know.

5624
03:50:10,760 --> 03:50:11,740
I don't know.

5625
03:50:13,120 --> 03:50:14,820
I don't know what I'm doing.

5626
03:50:15,160 --> 03:50:19,340
Essentially, I've been kind of feeling like super not rusty.

5627
03:50:19,500 --> 03:50:30,620
It's just that, you know, when I was streaming before, I, you know, I was teeny tiny.

5628
03:50:31,140 --> 03:50:35,680
And then in heaven, I had a lot of stuff handled for me.

5629
03:50:35,760 --> 03:50:36,760
And then I came back.

5630
03:50:36,760 --> 03:50:37,200
Okay.

5631
03:50:37,220 --> 03:50:42,760
And there's like, you know, like things that I'm just like, I don't know how to handle some of this stuff.

5632
03:50:42,920 --> 03:50:46,420
And so last night, I like talked with Mataram for like maybe two hours.

5633
03:50:46,680 --> 03:50:48,060
I was just like, are you free?

5634
03:50:49,920 --> 03:50:53,600
Because I've just been feeling like it was like we talked until like 2 a.m.

5635
03:50:53,600 --> 03:50:53,980
or something.

5636
03:50:54,200 --> 03:50:56,600
I was like, I'm feeling I need I need your advice.

5637
03:50:56,760 --> 03:50:58,060
I'm so overwhelmed.

5638
03:50:59,460 --> 03:51:01,720
And I was like, I was like crying.

5639
03:51:01,860 --> 03:51:02,660
I'm just like.

5640
03:51:05,020 --> 03:51:06,040
So just like.

5641
03:51:07,940 --> 03:51:09,860
So I don't know what I'm doing.

5642
03:51:12,060 --> 03:51:13,920
But she gave me some good advice.

5643
03:51:14,160 --> 03:51:15,600
She's good to help.

5644
03:51:15,720 --> 03:51:16,280
Good stuff.

5645
03:51:16,440 --> 03:51:16,820
Good.

5646
03:51:17,240 --> 03:51:17,680
Good.

5647
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:18,540
Good to help me.

5648
03:51:18,920 --> 03:51:21,940
And like, I've been talking with some other people, too.

5649
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:22,540
Just about.

5650
03:51:22,740 --> 03:51:23,340
I don't know.

5651
03:51:23,340 --> 03:51:23,520
Sorry.

5652
03:51:23,600 --> 03:51:25,780
That, like, really resonated with me for some reason.

5653
03:51:27,220 --> 03:51:28,120
Thanks, Mei-Ling.

5654
03:51:28,180 --> 03:51:29,280
You're a real one.

5655
03:51:31,160 --> 03:51:32,380
You're a real one, Mei-Ling.

5656
03:51:32,440 --> 03:51:32,720
Wait.

5657
03:51:32,820 --> 03:51:34,580
There wasn't anything in here either, was there?

5658
03:51:34,940 --> 03:51:36,380
Unless it respawned.

5659
03:51:37,580 --> 03:51:38,080
Oh.

5660
03:51:40,430 --> 03:51:41,450
Oh, there is.

5661
03:51:42,110 --> 03:51:43,090
Nothing behind me?

5662
03:51:43,190 --> 03:51:43,470
Yeah.

5663
03:51:47,930 --> 03:51:48,950
Thanks, Mei-Ling.

5664
03:51:49,090 --> 03:51:50,710
Yeah, it's real advice.

5665
03:51:51,390 --> 03:51:51,890
Oh.

5666
03:51:52,070 --> 03:51:52,570
Oh.

5667
03:51:53,890 --> 03:51:54,650
There we go.

5668
03:51:54,730 --> 03:51:55,070
Nice.

5669
03:51:56,590 --> 03:52:01,110
Okay, I think I got everything from this area for now.

5670
03:52:03,910 --> 03:52:04,410
Yeah.

5671
03:52:07,370 --> 03:52:08,110
But, yeah.

5672
03:52:08,110 --> 03:52:11,570
Yeah, it's just been... it hasn't been easy.

5673
03:52:11,790 --> 03:52:13,330
Because I'm... yeah, like I said...

5674
03:52:15,490 --> 03:52:17,230
But it's... you know, it's fine.

5675
03:52:17,990 --> 03:52:20,810
I'm just feeling all sorts of things.

5676
03:52:22,930 --> 03:52:24,570
Feeling all sorts of ways.

5677
03:52:25,090 --> 03:52:26,270
Let's get our ration.

5678
03:52:30,530 --> 03:52:31,050
Oh!

5679
03:52:31,050 --> 03:52:31,850
Never mind.

5680
03:52:32,190 --> 03:52:33,330
We don't need it.

5681
03:52:33,470 --> 03:52:34,390
I'm too good.

5682
03:52:35,190 --> 03:52:35,670
Wow!

5683
03:52:36,990 --> 03:52:38,190
This is so cool!

5684
03:52:38,990 --> 03:52:39,890
Look at them going!

5685
03:52:47,540 --> 03:52:49,080
Literally growing pains.

5686
03:52:49,740 --> 03:52:50,820
Yeah, a little maybe.

5687
03:52:53,200 --> 03:52:53,800
Let's see.

5688
03:52:53,940 --> 03:52:55,420
We don't need our mind detector anymore.

5689
03:52:55,700 --> 03:52:56,720
I'm gonna put our rations...

5690
03:52:56,720 --> 03:52:57,220
Oh wait!

5691
03:52:57,260 --> 03:52:58,200
We can't shoot in here.

5692
03:52:58,460 --> 03:52:58,860
Wait!

5693
03:52:59,800 --> 03:53:00,840
We can put them to...

5694
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:01,980
Wait!

5695
03:53:06,500 --> 03:53:06,980
No!

5696
03:53:08,060 --> 03:53:11,240
I was gonna say we can use our M9, but we can't!

5697
03:53:11,580 --> 03:53:12,600
Use that either!

5698
03:53:15,640 --> 03:53:16,040
Okay.

5699
03:53:16,300 --> 03:53:16,980
Never mind.

5700
03:53:17,480 --> 03:53:21,340
The game... before it lets you at least try, but now it's like...

5701
03:53:22,020 --> 03:53:23,960
Don't even think about it, missy.

5702
03:53:32,780 --> 03:53:34,580
Trying on a hearing aid play is good for the soul.

5703
03:53:34,760 --> 03:53:35,700
You're doing so well.

5704
03:53:35,700 --> 03:53:35,960
Keep it up.

5705
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:37,160
Thanks, Conqueror.

5706
03:53:37,460 --> 03:53:39,060
I'm not doing that well, but it's okay.

5707
03:53:39,100 --> 03:53:39,420
I'm having fun.

5708
03:53:42,680 --> 03:53:43,680
It is interesting...

5709
03:53:44,520 --> 03:53:46,340
That's where they keep the nuclear warheads.

5710
03:53:46,700 --> 03:53:47,600
Can't you see them?

5711
03:53:47,900 --> 03:53:48,580
No, I'm...

5712
03:53:48,580 --> 03:53:48,700
Yeah.

5713
03:53:49,240 --> 03:53:51,680
There's lots of boxes piled up in here, but...

5714
03:53:51,680 --> 03:53:53,420
Why are there just warheads in boxes?

5715
03:53:54,060 --> 03:53:55,880
They're all dismantled warheads.

5716
03:53:56,180 --> 03:53:57,780
They just leave them here?

5717
03:53:57,960 --> 03:53:58,260
Yeah!

5718
03:53:58,520 --> 03:53:59,780
Just like President Baker said.

5719
03:54:00,740 --> 03:54:01,620
Totally careless.

5720
03:54:02,100 --> 03:54:03,400
They're working on a limited budget.

5721
03:54:03,900 --> 03:54:08,300
They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.

5722
03:54:08,620 --> 03:54:10,660
Where are my tax dollars going to?

5723
03:54:10,660 --> 03:54:10,740
Two.

5724
03:54:12,200 --> 03:54:17,460
All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation mechanisms removed, so there's no fear of them exploding.

5725
03:54:17,460 --> 03:54:18,540
Thank you for the five gifted.

5726
03:54:18,820 --> 03:54:19,140
Thank you.

5727
03:54:19,140 --> 03:54:22,060
If the warheads are broken, they might leak plutonium, and that would be a serious problem.

5728
03:54:22,420 --> 03:54:22,800
Oh.

5729
03:54:23,100 --> 03:54:25,700
Snake, never use your weapon on that floor.

5730
03:54:26,060 --> 03:54:26,520
Okay.

5731
03:54:26,640 --> 03:54:28,560
Well, it won't even let me anyway, so...

5732
03:54:30,620 --> 03:54:33,080
You can't catch me using my weapon on this floor.

5733
03:54:33,880 --> 03:54:35,000
Because I'm not allowed.

5734
03:54:35,220 --> 03:54:37,020
Because the game...

5735
03:54:37,940 --> 03:54:38,400
What?

5736
03:54:38,400 --> 03:54:40,760
What do you mean, no use?

5737
03:54:43,360 --> 03:54:44,900
What do you mean, no use?

5738
03:54:45,240 --> 03:54:46,080
It's a box!

5739
03:54:48,600 --> 03:54:50,740
Oh, because I'm crouched, I think.

5740
03:54:52,820 --> 03:54:55,720
I was about to say, you...

5741
03:54:57,620 --> 03:54:59,120
You can't do this to me.

5742
03:55:07,900 --> 03:55:09,000
Just a box.

5743
03:55:28,700 --> 03:55:29,500
Just a box.

5744
03:55:30,340 --> 03:55:31,860
He didn't even say anything to me, though.

5745
03:55:31,960 --> 03:55:33,060
I'm kind of surprised.

5746
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:36,800
I like how she says, you see those boxes?

5747
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:38,080
Actually, I don't.

5748
03:55:41,380 --> 03:55:42,380
Actually, I don't see.

5749
03:55:43,700 --> 03:55:48,310
I need that guy up there to move.

5750
03:55:49,350 --> 03:55:51,830
I need that guy up there to leave.

5751
03:55:52,530 --> 03:55:53,150
Okay, there we go.

5752
03:55:55,750 --> 03:55:56,510
Oh, lockers.

5753
03:55:57,910 --> 03:55:58,390
Okay,

5754
03:56:03,910 --> 03:56:04,770
um, thank you.

5755
03:56:04,950 --> 03:56:05,790
We're not safe.

5756
03:56:25,010 --> 03:56:26,370
Okay, thank you.

5757
03:56:28,430 --> 03:56:29,190
That's fine.

5758
03:56:29,490 --> 03:56:30,330
This is fine.

5759
03:56:34,670 --> 03:56:35,750
Yep, this is...okay.

5760
03:56:44,370 --> 03:56:45,070
Press the button.

5761
03:56:45,310 --> 03:56:46,090
Go, Snake, go.

5762
03:56:46,450 --> 03:56:47,210
Go, Snake, go.

5763
03:56:53,910 --> 03:56:54,390
Whoa!

5764
03:56:56,790 --> 03:56:57,270
Whoa!

5765
03:56:58,770 --> 03:56:59,250
B1.

5766
03:56:59,250 --> 03:56:59,330
B1.

5767
03:57:05,130 --> 03:57:05,730
Sheesh!

5768
03:57:07,770 --> 03:57:10,390
That was pretty close, wasn't it?

5769
03:57:12,950 --> 03:57:15,290
This is not the right floor.

5770
03:57:18,930 --> 03:57:19,530
B2.

5771
03:57:23,870 --> 03:57:26,390
This is the right floor.

5772
03:57:26,510 --> 03:57:27,610
Oh my gosh, you can see him!

5773
03:57:33,020 --> 03:57:33,500
Ow!

5774
03:57:36,370 --> 03:57:37,150
He's pacing.

5775
03:57:37,650 --> 03:57:38,710
He's a scientist.

5776
03:57:40,290 --> 03:57:41,090
You hear me?

5777
03:57:42,110 --> 03:57:42,990
You hear me?

5778
03:57:45,050 --> 03:57:47,650
Okay, this is where we discover the poison room.

5779
03:57:48,710 --> 03:57:50,530
Well, it doesn't look so gassy in there.

5780
03:57:51,070 --> 03:57:52,030
Actually, it looks fine.

5781
03:57:58,200 --> 03:57:59,620
Actually, it looks totally normal.

5782
03:58:02,580 --> 03:58:03,500
Oh, never mind.

5783
03:58:04,100 --> 03:58:05,000
Watch out, Snake.

5784
03:58:09,090 --> 03:58:12,730
The, like, the levels of security here.

5785
03:58:13,290 --> 03:58:15,030
First, you gotta make it gassy.

5786
03:58:15,810 --> 03:58:16,130
Whoa!

5787
03:58:16,370 --> 03:58:16,930
Whoa!

5788
03:58:17,490 --> 03:58:17,770
Whoa!

5789
03:58:18,370 --> 03:58:18,930
Yeah!

5790
03:58:20,470 --> 03:58:22,930
And then you also have to make it electrified.

5791
03:58:24,070 --> 03:58:26,130
It is overkill, absolutely.

5792
03:58:27,930 --> 03:58:28,490
Wait.

5793
03:58:29,110 --> 03:58:31,790
But, you know, um...

5794
03:58:32,610 --> 03:58:36,350
I guess, um, it's not overkill because I get past it.

5795
03:58:37,550 --> 03:58:38,070
Boing!

5796
03:58:46,800 --> 03:58:47,320
Hey!

5797
03:58:49,020 --> 03:58:49,720
It's filled with gas!

5798
03:58:49,940 --> 03:58:51,380
Also, the floor will kill you!

5799
03:58:55,200 --> 03:58:56,100
I'll destroy it.

5800
03:58:56,480 --> 03:58:57,760
I can't reach it.

5801
03:58:59,820 --> 03:59:00,340
Okay.

5802
03:59:01,140 --> 03:59:02,440
I'm gonna leave.

5803
03:59:02,740 --> 03:59:04,100
And go back.

5804
03:59:06,400 --> 03:59:10,640
Going all the way here, then to go all the way back.

5805
03:59:11,320 --> 03:59:12,960
I'll come back for you, Otacon.

5806
03:59:13,760 --> 03:59:15,080
I'll come back for you.

5807
03:59:15,940 --> 03:59:20,580
Oh, for anyone curious, I am going for the Otacon ending this time.

5808
03:59:21,340 --> 03:59:24,320
So, um, because I think it's funnier.

5809
03:59:25,460 --> 03:59:29,740
There's a particular scene that is, that is particularly comical.

5810
03:59:30,260 --> 03:59:33,180
So, uh, sorry, Meryl.

5811
03:59:33,180 --> 03:59:38,120
Um, but we are gonna get Otacon ending in this run.

5812
03:59:38,680 --> 03:59:41,500
Oh, we gotta go all the way back.

5813
03:59:41,700 --> 03:59:48,180
Actually, I'm going to try and do the heliport, um, thingy.

5814
03:59:49,520 --> 03:59:52,200
The heliport, uh...

5815
03:59:53,520 --> 03:59:54,300
What's the word?

5816
04:00:00,730 --> 04:00:01,290
Yes.

5817
04:00:03,450 --> 04:00:04,570
The thing.

5818
04:00:04,770 --> 04:00:05,870
I'm gonna do that thing.

5819
04:00:06,170 --> 04:00:06,730
Hahaha.

5820
04:00:07,930 --> 04:00:08,870
The truck ride.

5821
04:00:09,090 --> 04:00:09,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5822
04:00:11,490 --> 04:00:13,490
Oh, there's two guys down there, though.

5823
04:00:14,850 --> 04:00:15,970
Wait, is there two guys?

5824
04:00:19,470 --> 04:00:20,290
Oh, it's a...

5825
04:00:26,590 --> 04:00:26,990
Um...

5826
04:00:27,610 --> 04:00:30,370
I'm gonna hang over the rail and try and fall.

5827
04:00:30,610 --> 04:00:32,790
But I'm looking at their patterns real quick.

5828
04:00:33,210 --> 04:00:33,870
I don't...

5829
04:00:33,870 --> 04:00:34,230
Oh, no.

5830
04:00:34,310 --> 04:00:37,050
I think the camera will see me if I get out of the box, won't it?

5831
04:00:38,490 --> 04:00:39,390
I think it will.

5832
04:00:42,630 --> 04:00:43,610
So scary.

5833
04:00:45,550 --> 04:00:46,270
So scary.

5834
04:00:47,690 --> 04:00:52,150
The time is, like, so well.

5835
04:00:52,390 --> 04:00:52,730
Okay.

5836
04:00:52,770 --> 04:00:53,230
Here we go.

5837
04:00:53,910 --> 04:00:54,790
Oh, shit.

5838
04:00:54,850 --> 04:00:55,090
Please.

5839
04:00:55,210 --> 04:00:55,630
There we go.

5840
04:00:55,870 --> 04:00:56,850
And drop.

5841
04:00:57,970 --> 04:00:58,490
No!

5842
04:01:01,150 --> 04:01:02,110
Okay, next time.

5843
04:01:04,110 --> 04:01:05,390
What's the button to drop?

5844
04:01:06,110 --> 04:01:07,430
Uh, maybe it's B.

5845
04:01:07,710 --> 04:01:08,690
I don't know it.

5846
04:01:08,930 --> 04:01:09,450
Hahaha.

5847
04:01:12,930 --> 04:01:13,450
Okay.

5848
04:01:13,550 --> 04:01:13,790
Okay.

5849
04:01:13,810 --> 04:01:15,650
I should try number two.

5850
04:01:15,990 --> 04:01:17,830
Okay, we gotta wait for this guy to leave, too.

5851
04:01:17,970 --> 04:01:19,130
I think...

5852
04:01:19,130 --> 04:01:20,270
Yeah, he's coming over.

5853
04:01:20,430 --> 04:01:20,630
Okay.

5854
04:01:21,930 --> 04:01:22,770
Okay, okay, okay.

5855
04:01:24,470 --> 04:01:25,190
Oh, that...

5856
04:01:25,190 --> 04:01:25,690
Oh, okay.

5857
04:01:25,930 --> 04:01:26,970
We had it perfect.

5858
04:01:27,090 --> 04:01:28,370
If only I didn't mess it up.

5859
04:01:29,330 --> 04:01:30,130
What's the button?

5860
04:01:30,190 --> 04:01:30,570
Is it B?

5861
04:01:35,500 --> 04:01:38,180
I don't know if it's B or X.

5862
04:01:43,020 --> 04:01:43,540
It's X?

5863
04:01:44,980 --> 04:01:45,640
Thank you!

5864
04:01:46,460 --> 04:01:46,860
Okay.

5865
04:01:47,100 --> 04:01:47,500
Okay.

5866
04:01:48,140 --> 04:01:48,540
Okay.

5867
04:01:48,540 --> 04:01:49,220
X!

5868
04:01:52,120 --> 04:01:52,640
Nice.

5869
04:01:57,110 --> 04:01:57,910
Thank you, guys.

5870
04:01:58,070 --> 04:02:00,030
Otherwise, I would have totally pressed B.

5871
04:02:06,400 --> 04:02:07,440
Time to go!

5872
04:02:12,340 --> 04:02:12,860
Teleport.

5873
04:02:17,200 --> 04:02:20,100
How can you not see him?

5874
04:02:20,260 --> 04:02:20,860
It's the mask.

5875
04:02:21,180 --> 04:02:23,560
The mask is, you know, not helping them, you know?

5876
04:02:23,940 --> 04:02:24,820
I get it.

5877
04:02:24,960 --> 04:02:25,160
Okay.

5878
04:02:25,820 --> 04:02:26,940
To the heliport.

5879
04:02:27,440 --> 04:02:27,600
Huh?

5880
04:02:28,880 --> 04:02:30,620
It's not helping at all.

5881
04:02:30,700 --> 04:02:31,220
I get it.

5882
04:02:31,440 --> 04:02:32,000
I get it.

5883
04:02:33,440 --> 04:02:36,460
He thinks it's full of junk or something.

5884
04:02:39,000 --> 04:02:39,960
I get it.

5885
04:02:40,500 --> 04:02:40,940
Maybe.

5886
04:02:42,360 --> 04:02:42,800
Probably.

5887
04:02:43,860 --> 04:02:44,300
Okay.

5888
04:02:44,460 --> 04:02:45,020
Let's see.

5889
04:02:45,100 --> 04:02:46,920
We got a guy there.

5890
04:02:47,160 --> 04:02:47,900
We got the same guys.

5891
04:02:48,620 --> 04:02:49,280
No more.

5892
04:02:49,300 --> 04:02:49,660
No less.

5893
04:02:51,660 --> 04:02:52,100
Nice.

5894
04:02:55,880 --> 04:02:57,040
Does he look this way?

5895
04:02:57,120 --> 04:02:57,260
Okay.

5896
04:02:59,120 --> 04:02:59,600
Get off the heliport.

5897
04:02:59,600 --> 04:02:59,840
Oh, there you are.

5898
04:03:00,760 --> 04:03:01,240
Oh.

5899
04:03:06,090 --> 04:03:07,250
La, la, la, la.

5900
04:03:08,470 --> 04:03:09,610
Beep, beep, boop, bop.

5901
04:03:10,790 --> 04:03:11,610
M9 ammo.

5902
04:03:12,610 --> 04:03:13,570
Very good.

5903
04:03:15,930 --> 04:03:16,970
Which can I?

5904
04:03:17,410 --> 04:03:22,870
I don't think I can reach.

5905
04:03:26,970 --> 04:03:28,150
This guy's going to come back.

5906
04:03:29,630 --> 04:03:30,610
Oh, wait.

5907
04:03:31,630 --> 04:03:32,110
Oh.

5908
04:03:34,240 --> 04:03:39,340
Well, we want to get this guy over here first because otherwise he'll discover his sleeping friend.

5909
04:03:39,600 --> 04:03:43,100
Even though if he's sleeping right now, it's no biggie.

5910
04:03:44,160 --> 04:03:45,860
So calm to destroy the camera.

5911
04:03:47,140 --> 04:03:49,680
Yeah, oh actually that is a good point.

5912
04:03:50,820 --> 04:03:55,300
Once we... is he coming or does he not come this way actually?

5913
04:03:55,440 --> 04:03:55,960
I don't know.

5914
04:03:55,960 --> 04:03:57,360
Let's just put this guy to sleep.

5915
04:03:58,480 --> 04:04:00,200
Good night, little baby.

5916
04:04:01,660 --> 04:04:03,980
Go to sleep, little baby.

5917
04:04:18,160 --> 04:04:18,960
Oh, there he is.

5918
04:04:26,330 --> 04:04:26,930
It's fine.

5919
04:04:27,710 --> 04:04:28,410
Are you dead?

5920
04:04:28,590 --> 04:04:28,990
Oh!

5921
04:04:30,090 --> 04:04:30,570
Cool.

5922
04:04:36,910 --> 04:04:37,470
I

5923
04:04:41,910 --> 04:04:42,990
thought he was gone.

5924
04:04:44,430 --> 04:04:47,870
I thought he was gone.

5925
04:04:48,430 --> 04:04:50,970
He was in fact still there.

5926
04:05:04,450 --> 04:05:07,370
It doesn't matter anyway because...

5927
04:05:12,170 --> 04:05:13,750
Why would it... why did it go away?

5928
04:05:13,770 --> 04:05:15,250
It went down so quickly before.

5929
04:05:15,970 --> 04:05:16,850
That's weird.

5930
04:05:18,490 --> 04:05:19,090
Oh god.

5931
04:05:24,670 --> 04:05:27,570
Now... we... are these open?

5932
04:05:29,830 --> 04:05:33,540
Can I shoot from here?

5933
04:05:34,180 --> 04:05:35,780
That'd be pretty handy if I could.

5934
04:05:37,180 --> 04:05:39,380
If I back up a little.

5935
04:05:41,120 --> 04:05:41,720
Oh!

5936
04:05:41,720 --> 04:05:42,620
Oh ho ho!

5937
04:05:43,220 --> 04:05:44,760
Oh ho ho ho!

5938
04:05:47,100 --> 04:05:48,760
Can I get a little closer?

5939
04:05:49,780 --> 04:05:50,500
No.

5940
04:05:51,380 --> 04:05:52,860
Okay, right here.

5941
04:05:53,280 --> 04:05:54,000
No.

5942
04:05:54,440 --> 04:05:55,820
Okay, right...

5943
04:05:56,680 --> 04:05:57,040
Here!

5944
04:05:58,320 --> 04:05:59,040
Alright.

5945
04:06:00,280 --> 04:06:01,920
Come over here.

5946
04:06:02,820 --> 04:06:06,020
Where I can see... see you.

5947
04:06:06,640 --> 04:06:08,540
Gotta get your legs.

5948
04:06:14,650 --> 04:06:15,970
Just a mosquito.

5949
04:06:16,110 --> 04:06:16,890
In Alaska.

5950
04:06:16,890 --> 04:06:21,050
It happens way more often than you'd imagine.

5951
04:06:22,210 --> 04:06:27,250
Those pesky Alaska mosquitoes, you guys, are so icky.

5952
04:06:27,870 --> 04:06:28,810
Did it work?

5953
04:06:28,990 --> 04:06:29,570
I think so.

5954
04:06:30,410 --> 04:06:31,090
Oh!

5955
04:06:34,860 --> 04:06:36,760
He technically did his report.

5956
04:06:37,180 --> 04:06:38,680
Oh, maybe he didn't.

5957
04:06:41,680 --> 04:06:42,360
Um...

5958
04:06:46,130 --> 04:06:47,070
Backup unit.

5959
04:06:47,070 --> 04:06:47,170
Unit.

5960
04:06:48,910 --> 04:06:49,750
Well, there they come.

5961
04:06:52,970 --> 04:06:53,950
We can get them, too.

5962
04:06:55,170 --> 04:06:55,930
Easy peasy.

5963
04:06:56,850 --> 04:06:58,610
One... hit them with the old one, too.

5964
04:06:59,730 --> 04:07:01,570
And they will never...

5965
04:07:01,570 --> 04:07:01,570
oh.

5966
04:07:01,690 --> 04:07:02,790
I think they woke him up.

5967
04:07:03,070 --> 04:07:04,650
I'm just imagining things.

5968
04:07:06,570 --> 04:07:07,350
There's a mosquito!

5969
04:07:08,490 --> 04:07:10,810
It's... it's really awful, powerful one.

5970
04:07:10,870 --> 04:07:11,710
It sucks all your...

5971
04:07:13,070 --> 04:07:14,010
Oh, they're searching?

5972
04:07:14,190 --> 04:07:14,630
I think.

5973
04:07:16,150 --> 04:07:16,830
Nothing here.

5974
04:07:17,070 --> 04:07:17,770
Nothing here.

5975
04:07:20,010 --> 04:07:20,890
Nothing here.

5976
04:07:21,210 --> 04:07:22,890
Where... I'm hearing so many footsteps.

5977
04:07:23,030 --> 04:07:25,950
Oh, I think I'm hearing them... above me, maybe?

5978
04:07:26,490 --> 04:07:27,650
They sound so close.

5979
04:07:29,430 --> 04:07:33,090
I can't believe there's the... they already... the... the one tanker's gone.

5980
04:07:33,150 --> 04:07:34,590
It's so fun... or the one tank is gone.

5981
04:07:35,110 --> 04:07:35,930
It's so funny.

5982
04:07:36,690 --> 04:07:37,710
Where am I going again?

5983
04:07:37,830 --> 04:07:38,430
Oh, the armory.

5984
04:07:38,510 --> 04:07:38,910
That's right.

5985
04:07:40,010 --> 04:07:40,930
Is that your leg?

5986
04:07:50,480 --> 04:07:52,160
Once he's down, we're gonna leave.

5987
04:07:52,700 --> 04:07:54,880
Actually, I think I can leave now, but...

5988
04:07:55,400 --> 04:07:56,860
We'll just be... be safe.

5989
04:07:58,820 --> 04:07:59,600
Go down.

5990
04:08:00,500 --> 04:08:01,480
Go to sleep.

5991
04:08:09,420 --> 04:08:09,940
Um...

5992
04:08:10,640 --> 04:08:11,160
Okay.

5993
04:08:11,700 --> 04:08:11,740
Hmm?

5994
04:08:13,520 --> 04:08:13,780
Hmm?

5995
04:08:13,940 --> 04:08:15,100
Is there somebody there?

5996
04:08:15,280 --> 04:08:15,480
No.

5997
04:08:16,220 --> 04:08:17,000
Nobody here.

5998
04:08:18,440 --> 04:08:18,960
Nobody.

5999
04:08:20,660 --> 04:08:21,700
Nothing here.

6000
04:08:29,480 --> 04:08:30,440
Oh, wait.

6001
04:08:30,540 --> 04:08:31,180
No, it's B-2.

6002
04:08:32,440 --> 04:08:33,040
It's okay.

6003
04:08:35,700 --> 04:08:36,220
Nowhere.

6004
04:08:36,320 --> 04:08:36,800
Actually...

6005
04:08:37,820 --> 04:08:38,860
It's five.

6006
04:08:44,780 --> 04:08:45,820
Nothing here.

6007
04:08:47,080 --> 04:08:49,920
We need... the Nikita missiles, right?

6008
04:08:55,580 --> 04:08:56,620
So stressful.

6009
04:08:59,220 --> 04:09:01,220
This guy's gonna come up and discover us.

6010
04:09:01,320 --> 04:09:02,060
I do know that.

6011
04:09:02,340 --> 04:09:04,300
So we need to act first.

6012
04:09:04,840 --> 04:09:07,500
We need to... box it up.

6013
04:09:11,710 --> 04:09:12,370
Oh, my God.

6014
04:09:14,770 --> 04:09:16,750
Is he gonna notice me or...

6015
04:09:16,750 --> 04:09:17,790
Am I in your way?

6016
04:09:18,630 --> 04:09:19,510
Oh, shoot.

6017
04:09:20,390 --> 04:09:22,970
Well, that just puts a little damper in our plans now.

6018
04:09:23,950 --> 04:09:24,450
Doesn't it?

6019
04:09:27,530 --> 04:09:27,970
Um...

6020
04:09:31,890 --> 04:09:32,450
What's that?

6021
04:09:32,670 --> 04:09:34,370
Oh, you kicked me before I could grab you.

6022
04:09:38,110 --> 04:09:38,850
Oh, come on.

6023
04:09:44,770 --> 04:09:45,450
It's okay, Snake.

6024
04:09:45,830 --> 04:09:47,550
All we gotta do is get the Nikita and go.

6025
04:09:48,270 --> 04:09:48,990
It doesn't matter.

6026
04:09:49,770 --> 04:09:50,830
But wait, actually...

6027
04:09:50,830 --> 04:09:52,270
This might be a good place to hide.

6028
04:09:52,630 --> 04:09:52,990
Right?

6029
04:09:53,850 --> 04:09:54,210
Because...

6030
04:09:54,850 --> 04:09:56,070
We can just...

6031
04:09:56,070 --> 04:09:56,710
...

6032
04:09:57,210 --> 04:09:57,570
...

6033
04:10:16,800 --> 04:10:18,580
They don't like coming in here.

6034
04:10:19,440 --> 04:10:21,460
They don't like coming in here, I've noticed.

6035
04:10:21,720 --> 04:10:24,880
So, uh, good stuff.

6036
04:10:25,160 --> 04:10:27,420
Okay, they are right where we need to go.

6037
04:10:27,540 --> 04:10:29,300
So you guys need to leave.

6038
04:10:30,360 --> 04:10:32,000
That's where the room is.

6039
04:10:36,800 --> 04:10:37,720
You're checking?

6040
04:10:40,500 --> 04:10:41,660
It's a spooky room.

6041
04:10:41,920 --> 04:10:42,240
It is.

6042
04:10:43,440 --> 04:10:45,560
I kind of wanted to hear the BDM one, though.

6043
04:10:46,020 --> 04:10:46,840
Kind of awesome.

6044
04:10:48,060 --> 04:10:49,440
You need to leave!

6045
04:10:51,620 --> 04:10:57,800
Actually, I think they do check in here, but we'll see if the radar goes down before they get it to this place.

6046
04:11:00,220 --> 04:11:00,680
Yep.

6047
04:11:01,600 --> 04:11:02,060
Nice.

6048
04:11:04,400 --> 04:11:05,340
Nice, nice, nice.

6049
04:11:05,700 --> 04:11:11,140
That guy...

6050
04:11:15,290 --> 04:11:15,970
what are you doing?

6051
04:11:16,070 --> 04:11:16,690
You're going that way.

6052
04:11:16,810 --> 04:11:16,970
Okay.

6053
04:11:26,960 --> 04:11:28,120
Get Nikita first.

6054
04:11:29,180 --> 04:11:30,400
Did he hear me in here?

6055
04:11:31,040 --> 04:11:31,640
Oh, shit.

6056
04:11:34,600 --> 04:11:36,220
Where's the... where's the box?

6057
04:11:36,500 --> 04:11:36,740
Okay.

6058
04:11:38,660 --> 04:11:40,360
I think the door's still open.

6059
04:11:42,100 --> 04:11:43,100
Okay, no, we're good.

6060
04:11:44,300 --> 04:11:45,260
Is there a...

6061
04:11:47,620 --> 04:11:49,340
No... no tricks.

6062
04:11:50,660 --> 04:11:51,760
No tricks.

6063
04:11:52,440 --> 04:11:53,220
Okay.

6064
04:11:53,620 --> 04:11:55,000
And what's in here?

6065
04:11:59,000 --> 04:11:59,800
What's this?

6066
04:12:02,620 --> 04:12:03,800
Eternal darkness?

6067
04:12:05,120 --> 04:12:05,900
Hello?

6068
04:12:07,860 --> 04:12:08,920
Oh, okay.

6069
04:12:10,640 --> 04:12:14,740
Alright, now we gotta go back all the way.

6070
04:12:16,160 --> 04:12:18,860
Let's wait for him to loop around again.

6071
04:12:20,560 --> 04:12:22,280
What if I leave a book?

6072
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:26,000
Leave a sexy book for you to look at.

6073
04:12:26,140 --> 04:12:27,880
So you don't come back around.

6074
04:12:28,920 --> 04:12:30,020
Wait, how do I plan this?

6075
04:12:30,280 --> 04:12:31,300
Press A to set.

6076
04:12:32,880 --> 04:12:33,280
Over

6077
04:12:43,090 --> 04:12:43,770
there, you!

6078
04:12:47,450 --> 04:12:48,130
Thank you!

6079
04:12:56,760 --> 04:12:57,800
He's just hanging out.

6080
04:12:57,920 --> 04:12:58,240
You know what?

6081
04:12:58,280 --> 04:12:59,780
I gave him a little present, you know?

6082
04:13:01,460 --> 04:13:02,840
Now he won't come back.

6083
04:13:03,120 --> 04:13:03,920
Okay, let's go.

6084
04:13:05,080 --> 04:13:06,040
To what?

6085
04:13:07,880 --> 04:13:09,680
I gave him a little present.

6086
04:13:09,860 --> 04:13:11,140
Now we're... we're buds now.

6087
04:13:11,860 --> 04:13:12,800
We're buddies.

6088
04:13:16,640 --> 04:13:17,600
Do I...

6089
04:13:18,440 --> 04:13:19,940
I hear someone snoring.

6090
04:13:20,540 --> 04:13:21,220
I think.

6091
04:13:23,420 --> 04:13:24,080
I didn't.

6092
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:25,500
Um...

6093
04:13:26,500 --> 04:13:28,680
They turned off the lasers right here.

6094
04:13:28,680 --> 04:13:29,940
This part.

6095
04:13:32,160 --> 04:13:32,640
Right?

6096
04:13:32,820 --> 04:13:34,180
Did they turn off the lasers here?

6097
04:13:38,620 --> 04:13:39,740
No, they didn't!

6098
04:13:40,760 --> 04:13:42,080
That's so evil.

6099
04:13:44,540 --> 04:13:45,280
Oh my god.

6100
04:13:45,540 --> 04:13:45,760
Um...

6101
04:13:46,300 --> 04:13:46,780
Dying!

6102
04:13:54,020 --> 04:13:55,240
Good to check.

6103
04:13:55,560 --> 04:13:56,880
When did they turn them off?

6104
04:13:58,320 --> 04:13:58,800
Colonel?

6105
04:13:59,120 --> 04:14:00,260
Can you do that for me?

6106
04:14:02,620 --> 04:14:03,140
Hmm...

6107
04:14:03,140 --> 04:14:07,120
It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here had been switched off.

6108
04:14:07,300 --> 04:14:07,400
Wait!

6109
04:14:07,520 --> 04:14:07,880
What?

6110
04:14:18,120 --> 04:14:19,620
Am I willing to test it?

6111
04:14:21,780 --> 04:14:24,680
Am I... Am I willing to test it?

6112
04:14:27,060 --> 04:14:27,580
Huh?

6113
04:14:31,080 --> 04:14:32,580
Why don't I trust that?

6114
04:14:35,720 --> 04:14:38,240
I don't... I'm gonna try.

6115
04:14:38,940 --> 04:14:40,500
Because usually they are, right?

6116
04:14:40,740 --> 04:14:44,580
In my parents' homeland, they say, if there are more wolves, the people are eaten.

6117
04:14:44,700 --> 04:14:47,440
If there are more people, the wolves are eaten.

6118
04:14:47,700 --> 04:14:47,920
If there are more people, the wolves are eaten.

6119
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:48,840
Who are... who is...

6120
04:14:48,840 --> 04:14:51,540
Do people eat wolves?

6121
04:14:52,260 --> 04:14:53,940
Try not to let them see you.

6122
04:14:54,100 --> 04:14:54,420
I know.

6123
04:14:54,600 --> 04:14:55,660
I know, Mei-Ling.

6124
04:14:55,720 --> 04:14:56,020
I know.

6125
04:14:57,720 --> 04:14:58,520
Gaslight 100.

6126
04:14:59,100 --> 04:14:59,120
Gaslight 100.

6127
04:15:01,720 --> 04:15:02,160
Um...

6128
04:15:03,700 --> 04:15:04,480
Oh my god.

6129
04:15:05,120 --> 04:15:05,820
I'm gonna run.

6130
04:15:06,080 --> 04:15:06,460
Oh!

6131
04:15:23,340 --> 04:15:25,380
I've never seen this cutscene before, though.

6132
04:15:30,550 --> 04:15:31,070
Colonel?

6133
04:15:32,370 --> 04:15:32,890
Colonel!

6134
04:15:34,330 --> 04:15:34,850
Yo!

6135
04:15:34,890 --> 04:15:35,850
This is so messed up!

6136
04:15:37,170 --> 04:15:37,590
I...

6137
04:15:38,950 --> 04:15:40,130
Get me out of here!

6138
04:15:40,650 --> 04:15:45,170
Get me out of here!

6139
04:15:45,170 --> 04:15:47,910
Might as well give one last read before I die.

6140
04:15:48,310 --> 04:15:48,750
Might as well give one last read before I die.

6141
04:15:48,750 --> 04:15:49,310
Might as well give one last read before I die.

6142
04:15:50,970 --> 04:15:51,910
Call him?

6143
04:15:52,230 --> 04:15:53,450
Yeah, for real.

6144
04:15:53,590 --> 04:15:54,850
Colonel, this is your fault!

6145
04:15:55,910 --> 04:15:57,190
Snake, it's gas.

6146
04:15:57,470 --> 04:15:58,510
Hold your breath.

6147
04:15:58,870 --> 04:15:59,910
Your O2 gauge...

6148
04:15:59,910 --> 04:16:00,890
Until when?

6149
04:16:01,830 --> 04:16:04,770
If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.

6150
04:16:05,310 --> 04:16:08,750
When it reaches zero, your life gauge will begin to decrease.

6151
04:16:08,810 --> 04:16:09,050
What?

6152
04:16:11,590 --> 04:16:12,430
No way.

6153
04:16:12,450 --> 04:16:13,790
He just told me to hold my breath.

6154
04:16:18,070 --> 04:16:18,590
Merrill?

6155
04:16:19,350 --> 04:16:19,870
No!

6156
04:16:20,090 --> 04:16:21,650
That's not what I'm asking you.

6157
04:16:22,430 --> 04:16:23,230
I see.

6158
04:16:23,770 --> 04:16:24,590
Master Miller?

6159
04:16:26,430 --> 04:16:27,430
No idea.

6160
04:16:28,110 --> 04:16:29,030
A trap?

6161
04:16:29,390 --> 04:16:30,110
Could be.

6162
04:16:30,290 --> 04:16:33,210
But for the time being, I'll have to trust him.

6163
04:16:37,930 --> 04:16:41,670
Here's to almost two weeks of Mint's return of MGS Dream.

6164
04:16:42,010 --> 04:16:46,390
People who have been through war and survived develop a kind of sixth sense to warn them of danger.

6165
04:16:46,690 --> 04:16:48,790
Trust your instincts as a soldier.

6166
04:16:48,970 --> 04:16:50,010
As a gamer.

6167
04:16:50,410 --> 04:16:52,210
I love that line so much.

6168
04:16:52,730 --> 04:16:56,150
Um, well, I guess it's a good thing I saved.

6169
04:16:56,390 --> 04:16:57,170
I don't know.

6170
04:16:57,830 --> 04:16:58,870
What a joke.

6171
04:17:01,110 --> 04:17:02,390
What a joke!

6172
04:17:03,330 --> 04:17:06,130
The game told me the sensors were off!

6173
04:17:06,950 --> 04:17:09,790
The game told me the sensors were off.

6174
04:17:10,430 --> 04:17:11,930
That's so messed up.

6175
04:17:12,550 --> 04:17:13,490
Oh, thank goodness.

6176
04:17:13,750 --> 04:17:13,990
Okay.

6177
04:17:14,270 --> 04:17:15,370
I wonder though.

6178
04:17:16,110 --> 04:17:16,950
Okay, hold on.

6179
04:17:17,090 --> 04:17:17,770
Hold on.

6180
04:17:17,850 --> 04:17:19,050
I'm not even gonna look.

6181
04:17:19,190 --> 04:17:21,090
Let's try calling Colonel again.

6182
04:17:23,770 --> 04:17:24,330
Hmm.

6183
04:17:25,010 --> 04:17:28,770
It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here have been switched off.

6184
04:17:28,950 --> 04:17:29,370
Yes!

6185
04:17:31,030 --> 04:17:32,290
Oh my god.

6186
04:17:32,310 --> 04:17:33,090
I'm so scared.

6187
04:17:36,830 --> 04:17:39,230
No, they have not been turned off.

6188
04:17:39,430 --> 04:17:40,750
Colonel is actually...

6189
04:17:40,750 --> 04:17:43,650
He is actively sabotaging me.

6190
04:17:46,850 --> 04:17:47,670
Oh my god.

6191
04:17:47,750 --> 04:17:51,070
He is actively sabotaging me.

6192
04:17:51,930 --> 04:17:52,710
Welcome back.

6193
04:17:52,750 --> 04:17:54,530
It's been a while, but I kept up.

6194
04:17:54,610 --> 04:17:55,430
Thank you so much!

6195
04:17:58,930 --> 04:17:59,370
Okay.

6196
04:17:59,490 --> 04:18:00,350
Oh, dang it.

6197
04:18:00,410 --> 04:18:00,750
I missed it.

6198
04:18:01,910 --> 04:18:02,350
I

6199
04:18:10,150 --> 04:18:11,710
think the game is a little bugged.

6200
04:18:18,390 --> 04:18:18,830
Respond!

6201
04:18:23,300 --> 04:18:24,380
This is messed up.

6202
04:18:25,080 --> 04:18:26,660
I think the game is a little bugged.

6203
04:18:39,230 --> 04:18:41,930
Is it because I took the...

6204
04:18:43,270 --> 04:18:44,950
The heliport way?

6205
04:18:46,250 --> 04:18:47,850
Would that affect it?

6206
04:18:55,250 --> 04:18:55,910
Hmm.

6207
04:19:00,230 --> 04:19:00,890
Interesting.

6208
04:19:02,010 --> 04:19:02,990
Just a game.

6209
04:19:02,990 --> 04:19:03,810
Do you want to love trolling?

6210
04:19:04,430 --> 04:19:04,930
Just a game.

6211
04:19:05,030 --> 04:19:05,690
Do you want to love trolling?

6212
04:19:09,170 --> 04:19:13,790
Yeah, because there's also not the cameras set up here and stuff.

6213
04:19:15,190 --> 04:19:15,850
Interesting.

6214
04:19:19,330 --> 04:19:19,810
Um...

6215
04:19:19,810 --> 04:19:20,470
I think...

6216
04:19:20,470 --> 04:19:23,590
Actually, I am going to use this and we're going to grab the ration that's up here.

6217
04:19:28,190 --> 04:19:31,010
Colonel is misleading me more than chat does.

6218
04:19:34,570 --> 04:19:35,530
Colonel is...

6219
04:19:37,670 --> 04:19:39,470
really trying to make me throw.

6220
04:19:48,590 --> 04:19:49,070
Whoa...

6221
04:19:50,010 --> 04:19:50,490
Whoa...

6222
04:19:52,920 --> 04:19:54,580
Actually, this is a good opportunity.

6223
04:20:00,630 --> 04:20:01,630
Uh... box.

6224
04:20:02,230 --> 04:20:02,870
Oh, wait.

6225
04:20:02,970 --> 04:20:03,450
Get up.

6226
04:20:03,650 --> 04:20:04,650
And box.

6227
04:20:05,750 --> 04:20:06,810
And over here.

6228
04:20:08,890 --> 04:20:09,430
Over...

6229
04:20:10,770 --> 04:20:11,310
Over...

6230
04:20:12,030 --> 04:20:12,570
here.

6231
04:20:14,590 --> 04:20:16,050
My little safety net.

6232
04:20:16,210 --> 04:20:17,450
My little safety spot.

6233
04:20:18,170 --> 04:20:19,450
Can I see up there?

6234
04:20:19,750 --> 04:20:21,090
I kinda can.

6235
04:20:22,150 --> 04:20:23,110
Oh, there he is.

6236
04:20:23,270 --> 04:20:23,470
Okay.

6237
04:20:23,610 --> 04:20:24,090
Nice.

6238
04:20:24,210 --> 04:20:24,350
Nice.

6239
04:20:24,390 --> 04:20:24,510
Nice.

6240
04:20:27,010 --> 04:20:28,970
We do know that we can box in front of the...

6241
04:20:28,970 --> 04:20:33,510
We can box in front of the elevator though, so... hopefully.

6242
04:20:33,790 --> 04:20:35,330
As long as I align it right, I guess.

6243
04:20:44,760 --> 04:20:45,820
Does he stop there?

6244
04:20:46,060 --> 04:20:48,200
I guess he does, but I can go.

6245
04:20:53,350 --> 04:20:53,950
Thank you.

6246
04:20:57,730 --> 04:20:58,670
Okay, we gotta hurry.

6247
04:20:59,010 --> 04:20:59,950
We gotta go, go, go.

6248
04:21:02,450 --> 04:21:03,130
Oh my god, please.

6249
04:21:03,310 --> 04:21:04,330
Press the button.

6250
04:21:04,490 --> 04:21:04,710
Oh.

6251
04:21:04,770 --> 04:21:05,370
Press the button.

6252
04:21:10,110 --> 04:21:10,870
Let's go.

6253
04:21:11,410 --> 04:21:11,990
Let's go.

6254
04:21:13,410 --> 04:21:14,170
Let's go.

6255
04:21:14,450 --> 04:21:15,530
Holy cow!

6256
04:21:16,410 --> 04:21:17,510
That was close.

6257
04:21:18,150 --> 04:21:19,110
Me too.

6258
04:21:23,890 --> 04:21:25,990
Nothing I see here.

6259
04:21:26,190 --> 04:21:27,450
Nothing to see here.

6260
04:21:28,290 --> 04:21:29,370
All good.

6261
04:21:31,910 --> 04:21:34,350
It is the Nakina missiles that I need.

6262
04:21:34,470 --> 04:21:34,930
Wait...

6263
04:21:35,810 --> 04:21:36,250
Okay.

6264
04:21:36,690 --> 04:21:40,930
I was about to say, what if I don't even have them?

6265
04:21:41,790 --> 04:21:44,410
Okay Snake, we're gonna need you to hold your breath, buddy.

6266
04:21:46,710 --> 04:21:49,850
It's my first time trying this in this game, so...

6267
04:21:50,590 --> 04:21:52,490
It's gonna be interesting.

6268
04:21:53,850 --> 04:21:54,790
To say the least.

6269
04:21:55,270 --> 04:21:56,330
Might take a couple tries.

6270
04:21:56,590 --> 04:21:57,370
Okay, how do I use this?

6271
04:21:59,230 --> 04:22:01,370
A button to aim in first person view.

6272
04:22:01,690 --> 04:22:03,290
Release the fire and control.

6273
04:22:03,510 --> 04:22:03,670
Okay.

6274
04:22:06,470 --> 04:22:07,810
Wait, what are you saying?

6275
04:22:08,310 --> 04:22:10,370
Sorry, I'm missing some of your thingies.

6276
04:22:10,370 --> 04:22:11,130
Your donuts.

6277
04:22:12,450 --> 04:22:13,110
Oh wait.

6278
04:22:15,470 --> 04:22:17,690
Twin snakes is a ride in VR mission.

6279
04:22:17,790 --> 04:22:20,510
The colonel telling you sensors are off might be a glitch in the matrix.

6280
04:22:23,130 --> 04:22:23,570
Mysterious.

6281
04:22:23,570 --> 04:22:24,410
Welcome back, Mint.

6282
04:22:24,530 --> 04:22:26,170
Metal Gear brain rot is forever.

6283
04:22:26,790 --> 04:22:27,230
Forever!

6284
04:22:32,430 --> 04:22:34,830
You have 40 shots, so go for it.

6285
04:22:34,890 --> 04:22:35,110
True.

6286
04:22:35,350 --> 04:22:36,130
Okay, here we go.

6287
04:22:38,210 --> 04:22:39,130
And release!

6288
04:22:42,090 --> 04:22:43,010
Okay, turn.

6289
04:22:45,830 --> 04:22:46,290
Okay.

6290
04:22:46,290 --> 04:22:47,710
And nice and neat.

6291
04:22:47,990 --> 04:22:48,350
Go!

6292
04:22:49,090 --> 04:22:49,550
Go!

6293
04:22:49,610 --> 04:22:49,750
Go!

6294
04:22:49,750 --> 04:22:49,890
Go!

6295
04:22:49,890 --> 04:22:49,970
Go!

6296
04:22:50,330 --> 04:22:50,790
Zoom!

6297
04:22:51,070 --> 04:22:51,310
Zoom!

6298
04:22:51,330 --> 04:22:51,570
Zoom!

6299
04:22:51,570 --> 04:22:51,710
Zoom!

6300
04:22:52,770 --> 04:22:54,090
Don't shoot it down.

6301
04:22:54,190 --> 04:22:55,290
Don't shoot it down.

6302
04:23:06,770 --> 04:23:08,450
I think I'm a gamer.

6303
04:23:11,580 --> 04:23:13,080
I think I'm a gamer.

6304
04:23:18,720 --> 04:23:19,300
Nice.

6305
04:23:19,660 --> 04:23:20,240
Nice.

6306
04:23:20,440 --> 04:23:20,620
Nice.

6307
04:23:20,660 --> 04:23:24,140
Now which one has the gas mask in it?

6308
04:23:25,160 --> 04:23:26,320
This one?

6309
04:23:26,860 --> 04:23:27,440
No.

6310
04:23:27,940 --> 04:23:29,140
This one.

6311
04:23:29,740 --> 04:23:31,080
That's a dirty magazine.

6312
04:23:31,860 --> 04:23:32,440
Wait.

6313
04:23:32,920 --> 04:23:34,200
A chaff grenade.

6314
04:23:34,280 --> 04:23:35,240
I'm just gonna chaff it.

6315
04:23:36,720 --> 04:23:38,440
I know I probably shouldn't, but...

6316
04:23:39,940 --> 04:23:40,260
Okay.

6317
04:23:40,380 --> 04:23:40,980
We gotta hurry.

6318
04:23:41,160 --> 04:23:41,540
Come on.

6319
04:23:43,900 --> 04:23:44,540
It's one of these.

6320
04:23:45,040 --> 04:23:45,360
Good.

6321
04:23:45,420 --> 04:23:45,540
Go!

6322
04:23:45,600 --> 04:23:45,720
Go!

6323
04:23:45,760 --> 04:23:45,860
Go!

6324
04:23:45,860 --> 04:23:45,920
Go!

6325
04:23:46,180 --> 04:23:47,180
Grab the book.

6326
04:23:47,620 --> 04:23:48,280
Grab the mask.

6327
04:23:48,520 --> 04:23:49,300
Put on the mask.

6328
04:23:52,780 --> 04:23:54,540
Can I get in this one while it's still jammed?

6329
04:23:54,940 --> 04:23:56,080
Oh, I ca- I could've.

6330
04:23:56,140 --> 04:23:57,120
I could've, but it's okay.

6331
04:23:57,840 --> 04:23:58,160
Shoo!

6332
04:24:00,020 --> 04:24:00,340
Okay.

6333
04:24:00,540 --> 04:24:00,860
Nice.

6334
04:24:03,760 --> 04:24:04,080
Hehehe.

6335
04:24:04,520 --> 04:24:05,260
Oh my gosh.

6336
04:24:05,280 --> 04:24:06,740
We got that Raiden vision real.

6337
04:24:07,500 --> 04:24:08,620
Is there a... Oh no.

6338
04:24:08,680 --> 04:24:09,220
There's nothing in here.

6339
04:24:10,400 --> 04:24:10,900
Oh wait.

6340
04:24:10,940 --> 04:24:12,720
There's actually nothing in here.

6341
04:24:12,900 --> 04:24:13,300
Okay.

6342
04:24:13,760 --> 04:24:14,380
There's a node.

6343
04:24:24,820 --> 04:24:28,200
I don't remember if there's anything over here that I can get.

6344
04:24:28,600 --> 04:24:29,260
But we'll try.

6345
04:24:31,900 --> 04:24:33,380
I don't have much oxygen left.

6346
04:24:33,480 --> 04:24:33,740
Come on.

6347
04:24:33,780 --> 04:24:34,020
Let's go.

6348
04:24:34,520 --> 04:24:34,920
Nope.

6349
04:24:34,960 --> 04:24:35,400
Not that one.

6350
04:24:36,180 --> 04:24:36,580
Yep.

6351
04:24:36,680 --> 04:24:37,200
This one.

6352
04:24:38,300 --> 04:24:38,700
Grenade.

6353
04:24:38,700 --> 04:24:39,080
Chaff.

6354
04:24:39,700 --> 04:24:40,240
Grenade full.

6355
04:24:41,140 --> 04:24:41,800
Oh shit.

6356
04:24:41,920 --> 04:24:42,680
Oh shoot.

6357
04:24:43,020 --> 04:24:43,540
Uh oh.

6358
04:24:43,860 --> 04:24:44,720
Uh... Chaff?

6359
04:24:45,000 --> 04:24:45,500
Uh oh.

6360
04:24:45,540 --> 04:24:45,920
We're in trouble.

6361
04:24:46,220 --> 04:24:46,440
Ah!

6362
04:24:49,120 --> 04:24:49,800
Just run!

6363
04:25:00,850 --> 04:25:01,250
Shoo.

6364
04:25:05,420 --> 04:25:07,140
There's some more st- Oh, there's chaffs over there!

6365
04:25:10,800 --> 04:25:11,920
Oxygen runs out so fast.

6366
04:25:12,020 --> 04:25:13,340
And that's with the gas mask on.

6367
04:25:14,000 --> 04:25:15,580
That's with the gas mask on.

6368
04:25:20,040 --> 04:25:21,260
I mean, no one comes.

6369
04:25:21,380 --> 04:25:22,300
Maybe I could just...

6370
04:25:23,080 --> 04:25:23,960
...bolt through it.

6371
04:25:25,620 --> 04:25:26,680
Maybe I could just...

6372
04:25:26,680 --> 04:25:28,300
...run really fast.

6373
04:25:28,980 --> 04:25:29,900
Maybe I could just...

6374
04:25:36,070 --> 04:25:37,470
Can you shoot the guns?

6375
04:25:37,590 --> 04:25:39,670
I don't think so because of the gas, right?

6376
04:25:42,270 --> 04:25:43,230
Or can I?

6377
04:25:43,850 --> 04:25:44,470
Can I?

6378
04:25:44,530 --> 04:25:45,390
Can I shoot them down?

6379
04:25:46,350 --> 04:25:47,350
Or will I die?

6380
04:25:47,770 --> 04:25:48,390
I'm scared.

6381
04:25:48,690 --> 04:25:49,070
You can?

6382
04:25:49,310 --> 04:25:49,910
Wait, no way.

6383
04:25:49,970 --> 04:25:50,170
Really?

6384
04:25:52,350 --> 04:25:53,350
Uh, where is it?

6385
04:25:55,470 --> 04:25:55,830
Oh.

6386
04:25:58,910 --> 04:25:59,270
Uh.

6387
04:25:59,270 --> 04:25:59,630
Uh.

6388
04:26:00,650 --> 04:26:01,010
Oh!

6389
04:26:06,850 --> 04:26:08,850
I thought because of the gas, it was like gonna...

6390
04:26:09,450 --> 04:26:09,810
Pew!

6391
04:26:09,890 --> 04:26:10,990
I cannot see.

6392
04:26:12,890 --> 04:26:14,290
Could've run out of bullets at this rate.

6393
04:26:15,750 --> 04:26:16,410
Oh, I got him.

6394
04:26:17,210 --> 04:26:19,170
I cannot see with this mask on though.

6395
04:26:19,530 --> 04:26:20,170
Oh, there's one.

6396
04:26:21,390 --> 04:26:21,750
Ugh.

6397
04:26:21,750 --> 04:26:22,910
It's so hard to tell.

6398
04:26:23,770 --> 04:26:24,310
There we go.

6399
04:26:24,470 --> 04:26:25,230
Let's go back.

6400
04:26:28,910 --> 04:26:29,690
There we go.

6401
04:26:31,630 --> 04:26:32,250
Okay.

6402
04:26:35,110 --> 04:26:36,230
And again.

6403
04:26:38,530 --> 04:26:41,270
It's that one right there that's gonna be tricky.

6404
04:26:44,430 --> 04:26:45,350
This one.

6405
04:26:45,550 --> 04:26:48,370
The one that's pointed straight in my direction.

6406
04:26:48,510 --> 04:26:49,750
And is not moving.

6407
04:26:52,020 --> 04:26:53,450
Could you move a little?

6408
04:26:53,450 --> 04:26:54,450
Could you...

6409
04:26:56,750 --> 04:26:57,230
Um.

6410
04:26:58,170 --> 04:26:58,650
Okay.

6411
04:26:59,790 --> 04:27:00,270
Uh.

6412
04:27:02,090 --> 04:27:02,570
Eltaline?

6413
04:27:03,650 --> 04:27:05,210
Oh, you are so smart.

6414
04:27:06,970 --> 04:27:07,590
Come on.

6415
04:27:08,690 --> 04:27:09,290
Come on.

6416
04:27:09,370 --> 04:27:10,090
Where is it?

6417
04:27:12,410 --> 04:27:12,890
Where?

6418
04:27:14,330 --> 04:27:15,310
Where is it?

6419
04:27:16,950 --> 04:27:17,750
Oh, I got it.

6420
04:27:17,790 --> 04:27:18,210
Okay, nice.

6421
04:27:21,330 --> 04:27:22,390
So hard to say.

6422
04:27:38,440 --> 04:27:40,220
Oh, maybe I should've gotten closer.

6423
04:27:42,460 --> 04:27:43,300
Like here.

6424
04:27:43,620 --> 04:27:44,220
I can...

6425
04:27:46,540 --> 04:27:46,960
Uh.

6426
04:27:47,180 --> 04:27:47,760
Maybe not.

6427
04:27:50,680 --> 04:27:51,100
Wait.

6428
04:27:51,120 --> 04:27:51,540
Where is it?

6429
04:27:51,600 --> 04:27:51,760
Here?

6430
04:27:51,860 --> 04:27:52,380
That's it.

6431
04:27:52,480 --> 04:27:52,680
Yeah.

6432
04:27:53,680 --> 04:27:54,100
You.

6433
04:27:54,980 --> 04:27:55,400
Nice.

6434
04:27:56,740 --> 04:27:57,160
And...

6435
04:27:57,840 --> 04:27:58,260
Uh.

6436
04:27:59,020 --> 04:27:59,440
Uh.

6437
04:28:00,320 --> 04:28:01,360
Oh, I can't see it.

6438
04:28:01,420 --> 04:28:01,680
Oh, there.

6439
04:28:01,760 --> 04:28:01,940
There.

6440
04:28:01,980 --> 04:28:02,100
There.

6441
04:28:04,300 --> 04:28:04,940
Got him.

6442
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:10,320
No, more Nakeda missiles.

6443
04:28:11,440 --> 04:28:11,960
Beep.

6444
04:28:11,980 --> 04:28:12,260
Beep.

6445
04:28:12,700 --> 04:28:13,900
I think I can make it.

6446
04:28:17,560 --> 04:28:18,360
Grab it.

6447
04:28:24,270 --> 04:28:25,230
Run, Snake!

6448
04:28:25,290 --> 04:28:25,590
Run!

6449
04:28:26,510 --> 04:28:27,030
Nooo!

6450
04:28:28,470 --> 04:28:30,030
Oh no no no no.

6451
04:28:30,090 --> 04:28:30,410
For real.

6452
04:28:30,550 --> 04:28:31,270
No no no.

6453
04:28:31,470 --> 04:28:35,390
Oh my gosh.

6454
04:28:36,850 --> 04:28:37,830
I was right though.

6455
04:28:37,870 --> 04:28:38,850
I knew we'd make it.

6456
04:28:40,030 --> 04:28:40,550
Danger.

6457
04:28:42,670 --> 04:28:43,190
Okay.

6458
04:28:43,190 --> 04:28:43,190
Okay.

6459
04:28:44,490 --> 04:28:45,750
Um... worse?

6460
04:28:46,210 --> 04:28:47,510
We wouldn't have died though.

6461
04:28:47,570 --> 04:28:48,210
We wouldn't have died.

6462
04:28:48,390 --> 04:28:48,910
It would have been fine.

6463
04:28:50,650 --> 04:28:52,430
Okay, let's go see our little buddy.

6464
04:28:53,190 --> 04:28:54,310
Our little piss-pal.

6465
04:28:56,910 --> 04:28:58,790
And one of my favorite scenes of the game.

6466
04:29:06,790 --> 04:29:08,510
One of my favorite parts of the game!

6467
04:29:08,790 --> 04:29:09,190
Oh, save?

6468
04:29:09,830 --> 04:29:10,990
Yeah, I'll save real quick.

6469
04:29:15,390 --> 04:29:16,830
Oh, he's saying the...

6470
04:29:18,870 --> 04:29:20,330
Are those the train stations?

6471
04:29:23,430 --> 04:29:26,390
Snake, you can't use the radar because something's jamming it.

6472
04:29:26,410 --> 04:29:28,670
And whatever's doing it is very close to you.

6473
04:29:28,850 --> 04:29:29,670
Be careful.

6474
04:29:29,950 --> 04:29:31,190
I'm careful, I'm careful.

6475
04:29:36,010 --> 04:29:39,350
Whoa, it's so... it's going back and forth between my headphones.

6476
04:29:39,630 --> 04:29:40,410
It's so crazy.

6477
04:29:48,350 --> 04:29:48,870
Whoa...

6478
04:29:49,450 --> 04:29:50,390
Be careful, Snake.

6479
04:29:50,650 --> 04:29:51,270
Thanks, Mei-Ling.

6480
04:29:52,190 --> 04:29:53,230
Um... Colonel?

6481
04:29:53,950 --> 04:29:54,710
I'm scared.

6482
04:29:56,850 --> 04:30:00,730
The less you maneuver a remote-controlled missile, the faster it will fly.

6483
04:30:00,930 --> 04:30:01,450
Thanks, Colonel.

6484
04:30:01,530 --> 04:30:04,090
Remember this if you want to fire the missile over a greater distance.

6485
04:30:04,290 --> 04:30:04,610
Awesome.

6486
04:30:06,510 --> 04:30:07,130
Thank you.

6487
04:30:07,210 --> 04:30:08,430
Also, what's going on?

6488
04:30:10,250 --> 04:30:12,030
Snake, look at your sea rations.

6489
04:30:12,170 --> 04:30:12,930
They're frozen.

6490
04:30:13,290 --> 04:30:15,250
You can't use frozen sea rats.

6491
04:30:15,810 --> 04:30:18,690
Until they defrost, you won't be able to replenish your energy.

6492
04:30:18,930 --> 04:30:19,770
Be very careful.

6493
04:30:19,770 --> 04:30:21,190
Wait, my... why are my rations frozen?

6494
04:30:21,450 --> 04:30:22,350
They'll defrost in a warm place.

6495
04:30:22,350 --> 04:30:24,490
Probably just your bare skin would be fine.

6496
04:30:24,490 --> 04:30:25,110
My sea rats?

6497
04:30:26,650 --> 04:30:28,490
Who says sea rats?

6498
04:30:30,650 --> 04:30:33,250
Master Miller, my sea rats are frozen.

6499
04:30:33,530 --> 04:30:38,090
People who've been through war and survived develop a kind of success to warn them of danger.

6500
04:30:38,290 --> 04:30:38,890
Gamer, gamer, gamer, gamer.

6501
04:30:38,890 --> 04:30:41,750
Trust your instincts as a soldier, as a gamer.

6502
04:30:41,770 --> 04:30:42,610
The sea rats.

6503
04:30:43,910 --> 04:30:47,290
Yo ho, yo ho, the rat life for me.

6504
04:30:47,530 --> 04:30:51,210
I'm on the sea, I am a rat, I have no business here.

6505
04:30:53,690 --> 04:30:54,910
Meryl, are you okay?

6506
04:30:56,570 --> 04:30:58,850
Meryl, what are these holes and walls for?

6507
04:30:59,430 --> 04:31:00,070
Uh, bullets?

6508
04:31:00,150 --> 04:31:00,590
I don't know.

6509
04:31:00,950 --> 04:31:05,130
For blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.

6510
04:31:05,330 --> 04:31:05,450
Oh!

6511
04:31:06,090 --> 04:31:08,010
I've never heard that dialogue before.

6512
04:31:10,410 --> 04:31:11,390
Nastasha, how you doing?

6513
04:31:11,510 --> 04:31:11,730
Good.

6514
04:31:11,870 --> 04:31:13,110
You found a SOCOM?

6515
04:31:13,190 --> 04:31:13,850
Yeah, I did.

6516
04:31:13,870 --> 04:31:15,870
That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.

6517
04:31:16,530 --> 04:31:19,870
It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power.

6518
04:31:19,870 --> 04:31:23,470
It's also equipped with a LAM for nighttime combat.

6519
04:31:24,330 --> 04:31:26,370
I love that artist's LAM.

6520
04:31:26,690 --> 04:31:27,690
You can equip that too.

6521
04:31:28,230 --> 04:31:31,970
That pistol was designed specifically for use by Special Forces.

6522
04:31:32,210 --> 04:31:33,950
So I think it will be useful.

6523
04:31:34,490 --> 04:31:36,150
Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use.

6524
04:31:36,150 --> 04:31:37,070
Her voice is so different.

6525
04:31:37,170 --> 04:31:37,670
Yeah.

6526
04:31:38,010 --> 04:31:39,610
But it shouldn't be a problem for you.

6527
04:31:40,790 --> 04:31:42,950
Okay, the voices are a little...

6528
04:31:43,750 --> 04:31:44,630
Oh, these holes!

6529
04:31:46,430 --> 04:31:48,950
They look like, they look like dominoes.

6530
04:31:50,630 --> 04:31:51,570
Alright, here we go.

6531
04:31:55,680 --> 04:31:57,320
I love this scene.

6532
04:31:57,780 --> 04:32:00,040
I hope it's good in this version too.

6533
04:32:02,020 --> 04:32:02,820
We'll see.

6534
04:32:08,440 --> 04:32:10,700
This scene is so awesome.

6535
04:32:14,040 --> 04:32:17,860
Oh my gosh.

6536
04:32:17,940 --> 04:32:19,940
There's not as much blood so far.

6537
04:32:40,860 --> 04:32:41,240
Wait.

6538
04:32:44,980 --> 04:32:47,340
Wait, why did he take off his stealth camo?

6539
04:32:49,060 --> 04:32:49,840
Oh my god though.

6540
04:32:49,860 --> 04:32:50,800
He sliced that guy in half.

6541
04:32:55,160 --> 04:32:55,680
No, no.

6542
04:32:55,740 --> 04:32:56,580
You're supposed to be invisible.

6543
04:32:57,960 --> 04:32:59,040
Okay, that's kind of cool though.

6544
04:33:04,770 --> 04:33:06,430
No, you're supposed to be invisible though.

6545
04:33:09,650 --> 04:33:10,030
Robin!

6546
04:33:11,050 --> 04:33:11,610
He's alive.

6547
04:33:17,370 --> 04:33:18,070
The music.

6548
04:33:21,450 --> 04:33:22,310
Caution, stand back.

6549
04:33:23,970 --> 04:33:26,730
Because the guy is supposed to be like, it's like he's a ghost.

6550
04:33:28,650 --> 04:33:29,270
I don't know.

6551
04:33:29,410 --> 04:33:31,450
I don't... I didn't really need to see the whole scene.

6552
04:33:32,990 --> 04:33:35,370
It was so much more mysterious when we didn't see it.

6553
04:33:37,010 --> 04:33:37,610
You know?

6554
04:33:38,530 --> 04:33:41,770
And then obviously, like, he's supposed to be invisible and then like...

6555
04:33:42,330 --> 04:33:44,030
The guy's like, it's like he's a ghost.

6556
04:33:44,490 --> 04:33:44,890
Hmm.

6557
04:33:46,630 --> 04:33:47,030
Oh!

6558
04:33:47,030 --> 04:33:47,430
Oh!

6559
04:33:48,790 --> 04:33:49,850
He's a skewer!

6560
04:33:50,590 --> 04:33:52,030
Oh my gosh, the barbecue.

6561
04:33:54,510 --> 04:33:56,010
No, that doesn't make any sense.

6562
04:33:59,330 --> 04:34:01,130
No, that doesn't make any sense!

6563
04:34:04,890 --> 04:34:05,870
You can see it!

6564
04:34:05,970 --> 04:34:07,170
Wow, he looks so cool though.

6565
04:34:10,820 --> 04:34:11,300
Ghost?

6566
04:34:13,760 --> 04:34:14,240
Me?

6567
04:34:15,860 --> 04:34:17,800
The music is also killing me.

6568
04:34:17,860 --> 04:34:18,100
Okay.

6569
04:34:18,800 --> 04:34:20,800
This scene was definitely...

6570
04:34:24,080 --> 04:34:24,480
I'm...

6571
04:34:24,920 --> 04:34:25,820
I'm not a fan.

6572
04:34:26,300 --> 04:34:26,960
Actually, I'm...

6573
04:34:27,660 --> 04:34:29,060
I'm actually quite disappointed.

6574
04:34:29,560 --> 04:34:30,320
But that's okay.

6575
04:34:31,380 --> 04:34:31,980
That's fine.

6576
04:34:32,760 --> 04:34:33,540
I get it.

6577
04:34:34,440 --> 04:34:35,680
Not all the scenes are the same.

6578
04:34:35,740 --> 04:34:36,140
I get it.

6579
04:34:36,160 --> 04:34:37,000
Can I loot their bodies?

6580
04:34:39,040 --> 04:34:40,220
You got any rations?

6581
04:34:41,800 --> 04:34:44,680
Oh my gosh, I completely forgot that I could get dog tags in this game.

6582
04:34:44,680 --> 04:34:44,780
Damn.

6583
04:34:46,300 --> 04:34:48,220
Okay, time to fight...

6584
04:34:49,240 --> 04:34:50,040
Gray Fox.

6585
04:34:53,340 --> 04:34:54,340
I don't know.

6586
04:34:54,400 --> 04:34:55,700
All my sea rats...

6587
04:34:55,700 --> 04:34:56,580
Wait, are they still frozen?

6588
04:34:56,740 --> 04:34:57,020
Uh-oh.

6589
04:34:57,640 --> 04:34:59,100
I'm gonna start calling them.

6590
04:35:03,960 --> 04:35:04,980
Stealth camouflage?

6591
04:35:05,680 --> 04:35:06,860
Who are you?

6592
04:35:07,860 --> 04:35:08,880
The nipples!

6593
04:35:10,860 --> 04:35:11,460
Ow!

6594
04:35:11,900 --> 04:35:12,500
Ow!

6595
04:35:14,480 --> 04:35:15,920
Oh no!

6596
04:35:17,140 --> 04:35:18,980
Where is my friend?

6597
04:35:19,200 --> 04:35:20,760
It gets me every time.

6598
04:35:21,140 --> 04:35:21,640
What?

6599
04:35:21,700 --> 04:35:22,620
What are you talking about?

6600
04:35:22,780 --> 04:35:23,860
Right behind you.

6601
04:35:25,320 --> 04:35:26,040
Whoa!

6602
04:35:30,280 --> 04:35:31,000
Whoa!

6603
04:35:32,240 --> 04:35:32,960
Oh!

6604
04:35:35,480 --> 04:35:36,920
What next?

6605
04:35:38,700 --> 04:35:40,700
They made him pee twice!

6606
04:35:40,800 --> 04:35:41,520
Snake.

6607
04:35:41,520 --> 04:35:41,680
Snake.

6608
04:35:41,680 --> 04:35:41,720
Snake.

6609
04:35:41,720 --> 04:35:41,780
Snake.

6610
04:35:41,780 --> 04:35:41,900
Snake.

6611
04:35:41,900 --> 04:35:41,940
Snake.

6612
04:35:42,500 --> 04:35:43,420
You're that ninja.

6613
04:35:43,780 --> 04:35:44,060
What?

6614
04:35:44,060 --> 04:35:44,680
You're that ninja!

6615
04:35:45,060 --> 04:35:46,920
I've been waiting for you, Snake.

6616
04:35:47,120 --> 04:35:48,520
No, no, I...

6617
04:35:48,520 --> 04:35:48,860
Who are you?

6618
04:35:49,000 --> 04:35:50,440
I already have more.

6619
04:35:50,880 --> 04:35:51,960
Neither enemy nor friend.

6620
04:35:52,580 --> 04:35:53,180
Yes!

6621
04:35:53,300 --> 04:35:56,000
I am back from a world where such words are meaningless.

6622
04:35:56,000 --> 04:35:57,100
Neither enemy nor friend.

6623
04:35:57,400 --> 04:35:58,440
I've removed all my shoes.

6624
04:35:58,440 --> 04:35:59,120
You're that maid.

6625
04:35:59,580 --> 04:36:02,740
Now you and I will battle to the death.

6626
04:36:03,100 --> 04:36:04,340
What do you want?

6627
04:36:04,480 --> 04:36:05,080
What do you want?

6628
04:36:05,500 --> 04:36:08,100
Oh, I've waited a long time for this day.

6629
04:36:08,780 --> 04:36:11,560
Now I want to enjoy this moment.

6630
04:36:11,660 --> 04:36:12,480
I think...

6631
04:36:12,500 --> 04:36:14,580
Grey Fox still sounds...

6632
04:36:14,580 --> 04:36:15,220
Like I said.

6633
04:36:15,260 --> 04:36:16,420
What's with these guys?

6634
04:36:16,460 --> 04:36:16,780
Hold on.

6635
04:36:17,160 --> 04:36:19,380
It's like one of my Japanese animes.

6636
04:36:20,300 --> 04:36:23,480
I've come from another world to battle with you.

6637
04:36:23,640 --> 04:36:24,500
What is it?

6638
04:36:24,820 --> 04:36:25,300
Revenge?

6639
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:29,120
Because of the voice effects on his...

6640
04:36:29,120 --> 04:36:31,720
Like, with him, it doesn't sound so different, you know?

6641
04:36:31,840 --> 04:36:32,680
Maybe because...

6642
04:36:32,680 --> 04:36:33,820
A fight to the death with you?

6643
04:36:34,040 --> 04:36:36,260
Maybe side by side it does, but...

6644
04:36:36,260 --> 04:36:37,480
I think it sounds pretty good.

6645
04:36:37,780 --> 04:36:39,140
He said the thing.

6646
04:36:39,440 --> 04:36:42,040
I will kill you, or you will kill me.

6647
04:36:42,100 --> 04:36:42,480
A fight to the death with you?

6648
04:36:43,320 --> 04:36:44,700
B is to punch.

6649
04:36:45,740 --> 04:36:46,860
Get in there, Otacon!

6650
04:36:50,080 --> 04:36:51,660
B is to punch, you guys.

6651
04:36:52,080 --> 04:36:53,140
B is to punch.

6652
04:37:06,620 --> 04:37:11,180
Okay, that line, I remember how he said it before.

6653
04:37:11,180 --> 04:37:13,360
And it definitely was better before.

6654
04:37:13,920 --> 04:37:15,400
He's like, make me...

6655
04:37:16,500 --> 04:37:19,300
He's like, make me feel alive again.

6656
04:37:20,400 --> 04:37:22,020
Okay, how do I beat him again?

6657
04:37:22,160 --> 04:37:23,440
I have to just punch him, right?

6658
04:37:25,320 --> 04:37:25,760
Yeah.

6659
04:37:26,220 --> 04:37:28,280
And then he does like a...

6660
04:37:28,280 --> 04:37:28,640
Whoa!

6661
04:37:30,460 --> 04:37:32,080
Oh, I can only get one hit in?

6662
04:37:41,130 --> 04:37:43,290
Okay, I'm hearing the differences more now.

6663
04:37:45,010 --> 04:37:47,910
I'm hearing the differences in the voice acting more now.

6664
04:37:49,670 --> 04:37:50,530
Where are you?

6665
04:37:50,890 --> 04:37:51,690
Oh, come here.

6666
04:37:52,270 --> 04:37:52,890
Come here.

6667
04:37:57,540 --> 04:37:58,840
I can't kick him.

6668
04:38:01,640 --> 04:38:02,820
Why can't I kick you?

6669
04:38:05,080 --> 04:38:05,560
No!

6670
04:38:07,100 --> 04:38:08,480
I was in mid-attack!

6671
04:38:11,360 --> 04:38:12,200
Oh my gosh.

6672
04:38:16,220 --> 04:38:16,700
Oh, nice.

6673
04:38:16,780 --> 04:38:17,160
There we go.

6674
04:38:20,220 --> 04:38:22,540
I don't remember when I can...

6675
04:38:25,180 --> 04:38:27,240
When can I start using my gun?

6676
04:38:27,300 --> 04:38:28,680
I don't remember...

6677
04:38:29,780 --> 04:38:30,420
Oh, ouch.

6678
04:38:51,860 --> 04:38:53,460
It'd be so funny if you...

6679
04:38:54,980 --> 04:38:56,860
I just realized... wait, I need my...

6680
04:38:56,860 --> 04:38:57,660
They're still frozen!

6681
04:38:57,820 --> 04:38:58,140
Oh gosh.

6682
04:38:58,320 --> 04:38:59,840
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6683
04:38:59,900 --> 04:39:00,360
Hold on!

6684
04:39:00,480 --> 04:39:01,360
My sea rats!

6685
04:39:01,360 --> 04:39:02,700
My sea rats!

6686
04:39:10,420 --> 04:39:11,400
Oh, ouch.

6687
04:39:11,460 --> 04:39:11,760
Oh,

6688
04:39:20,430 --> 04:39:20,690
keep...

6689
04:39:20,690 --> 04:39:21,390
please, Snake!

6690
04:39:22,330 --> 04:39:24,630
When he's like in mid-action...

6691
04:39:24,630 --> 04:39:26,050
Oh my god, the GameCube!

6692
04:39:28,790 --> 04:39:29,410
There we go.

6693
04:39:29,510 --> 04:39:29,910
Nice.

6694
04:39:31,730 --> 04:39:32,490
There we go.

6695
04:39:33,090 --> 04:39:37,430
And then I have to remember that one last part where he like goes kind of in...

6696
04:39:37,430 --> 04:39:39,830
Oh, they're better.

6697
04:39:40,150 --> 04:39:40,210
They're better.

6698
04:39:40,210 --> 04:39:40,470
They're better.

6699
04:39:40,530 --> 04:39:40,850
Nice.

6700
04:39:42,070 --> 04:39:42,850
Oh, hello?

6701
04:39:44,290 --> 04:39:45,670
Invincibility... Invincibility Frames!

6702
04:39:46,090 --> 04:39:46,770
Excuse me?

6703
04:39:47,490 --> 04:39:48,230
Oh my god.

6704
04:39:48,330 --> 04:39:49,150
That is unfair.

6705
04:39:49,590 --> 04:39:50,530
That is unfair.

6706
04:39:51,330 --> 04:39:52,110
Excuse me, sir.

6707
04:39:52,430 --> 04:39:53,410
I kicked you.

6708
04:39:55,330 --> 04:39:56,210
And you...

6709
04:39:56,210 --> 04:39:58,450
Oh, I got stuck on the wall.

6710
04:39:58,570 --> 04:39:58,830
That's okay.

6711
04:40:01,290 --> 04:40:01,730
Okay.

6712
04:40:01,730 --> 04:40:02,390
This is...

6713
04:40:02,390 --> 04:40:03,850
Don't hurt the GameCube!

6714
04:40:04,770 --> 04:40:05,830
Don't hurt Mario!

6715
04:40:07,710 --> 04:40:09,410
Why can I only get one hit in?

6716
04:40:11,490 --> 04:40:12,030
Hey-do!

6717
04:40:14,980 --> 04:40:16,360
Whoa, yeah, well...

6718
04:40:16,360 --> 04:40:19,320
He's going... He's going crazy mode!

6719
04:40:19,780 --> 04:40:21,700
He's going... Insano style!

6720
04:40:22,540 --> 04:40:24,640
He's parkouring all over me!

6721
04:40:24,800 --> 04:40:25,880
Oh, there we go.

6722
04:40:29,880 --> 04:40:33,940
Can you stop doing Cirque du Soleil for two seconds?

6723
04:40:36,460 --> 04:40:37,340
Oh my god.

6724
04:40:42,670 --> 04:40:43,170
Please.

6725
04:40:43,310 --> 04:40:43,830
Oh my god.

6726
04:40:43,930 --> 04:40:44,630
Oh my god.

6727
04:40:46,990 --> 04:40:47,550
Nice!

6728
04:40:49,780 --> 04:40:50,480
There we go.

6729
04:40:50,680 --> 04:40:50,900
Oh!

6730
04:40:51,660 --> 04:40:53,500
Hurt me more, Snake!

6731
04:40:57,800 --> 04:40:59,740
Oh no, I'm so bad at this part.

6732
04:41:00,000 --> 04:41:00,900
Oh no, wait.

6733
04:41:01,040 --> 04:41:01,160
Oh!

6734
04:41:01,180 --> 04:41:01,600
Oh!

6735
04:41:01,620 --> 04:41:02,320
Oh, never mind!

6736
04:41:02,660 --> 04:41:04,160
I know exactly where you are!

6737
04:41:06,040 --> 04:41:07,620
Hurry up and catch me.

6738
04:41:10,740 --> 04:41:11,220
Okay.

6739
04:41:13,220 --> 04:41:14,500
Oh, I saw where you went.

6740
04:41:15,480 --> 04:41:15,960
Nice.

6741
04:41:17,520 --> 04:41:18,480
Oh, uh...

6742
04:41:26,870 --> 04:41:27,490
Yeah?

6743
04:41:30,790 --> 04:41:31,410
Yup.

6744
04:41:34,830 --> 04:41:35,450
Uh...

6745
04:41:35,450 --> 04:41:36,370
Oh.

6746
04:41:37,170 --> 04:41:38,710
When can I use my gun?

6747
04:41:39,650 --> 04:41:40,590
Oh, shit.

6748
04:41:40,870 --> 04:41:41,250
Ah!

6749
04:41:42,750 --> 04:41:43,510
Uh-oh.

6750
04:41:43,610 --> 04:41:44,090
Okay.

6751
04:41:44,850 --> 04:41:45,550
Hey-do!

6752
04:41:48,810 --> 04:41:50,070
Is he gonna come get me?

6753
04:41:50,730 --> 04:41:51,350
Run?

6754
04:41:59,710 --> 04:42:00,790
Where are you?

6755
04:42:00,970 --> 04:42:01,670
Hello?

6756
04:42:07,430 --> 04:42:08,750
Hurt me more!

6757
04:42:09,190 --> 04:42:11,670
Hurt me more, Snake!

6758
04:42:12,030 --> 04:42:12,210
Hey!

6759
04:42:12,950 --> 04:42:16,310
Hurt me more!

6760
04:42:18,190 --> 04:42:19,710
He said the thing!

6761
04:42:21,110 --> 04:42:21,810
Nice.

6762
04:42:22,170 --> 04:42:24,970
I remember that one...

6763
04:42:24,970 --> 04:42:27,450
Yeah, we punched each other in Zanzibar!

6764
04:42:28,570 --> 04:42:29,270
Remember...

6765
04:42:29,270 --> 04:42:29,470
Oh!

6766
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:30,610
Dang it!

6767
04:42:33,070 --> 04:42:36,430
I remember when I punched you and you punched me.

6768
04:42:38,010 --> 04:42:41,150
We were punching each other in Zanzibar.

6769
04:42:41,190 --> 04:42:41,690
I remember.

6770
04:42:41,950 --> 04:42:42,750
I remember that.

6771
04:42:42,770 --> 04:42:43,190
Good times.

6772
04:42:44,250 --> 04:42:44,830
Oh, shit.

6773
04:42:44,950 --> 04:42:45,990
Oh, my god.

6774
04:42:46,050 --> 04:42:46,430
No, no, no.

6775
04:42:46,470 --> 04:42:46,950
Snake, get up.

6776
04:42:47,030 --> 04:42:47,710
Get up, please.

6777
04:42:47,910 --> 04:42:48,610
Oh, Snake.

6778
04:42:51,690 --> 04:42:52,510
Oh, yeah.

6779
04:42:52,930 --> 04:42:53,490
It's okay.

6780
04:42:54,670 --> 04:42:55,670
He won't see me here.

6781
04:42:56,130 --> 04:42:56,730
Just kidding.

6782
04:42:58,390 --> 04:42:58,950
Be-do!

6783
04:42:59,650 --> 04:43:00,570
Can I, like...

6784
04:43:00,570 --> 04:43:00,590
Can I, like...

6785
04:43:00,590 --> 04:43:02,270
Give me, like, two seconds, okay, Gravebox?

6786
04:43:03,190 --> 04:43:03,790
Never mind.

6787
04:43:04,590 --> 04:43:07,350
Like, two seconds to regain my composure.

6788
04:43:08,630 --> 04:43:09,070
Okay.

6789
04:43:09,210 --> 04:43:09,370
There we go.

6790
04:43:10,350 --> 04:43:10,890
All right.

6791
04:43:10,990 --> 04:43:11,150
Ah!

6792
04:43:12,070 --> 04:43:12,510
Ah!

6793
04:43:16,930 --> 04:43:18,570
The feeling of battle.

6794
04:43:22,630 --> 04:43:23,430
So awesome.

6795
04:43:25,670 --> 04:43:26,550
Come on.

6796
04:43:26,610 --> 04:43:27,910
Do your little teleporty thing.

6797
04:43:29,530 --> 04:43:30,170
Come on.

6798
04:43:30,190 --> 04:43:30,690
Come here.

6799
04:43:33,390 --> 04:43:34,070
There we go.

6800
04:43:34,190 --> 04:43:34,630
Come on.

6801
04:43:34,650 --> 04:43:34,930
Nice.

6802
04:43:34,990 --> 04:43:35,130
Nice.

6803
04:43:37,850 --> 04:43:38,390
Go, baby.

6804
04:43:40,450 --> 04:43:41,570
We got two hits in.

6805
04:43:42,130 --> 04:43:43,030
Hurt me more.

6806
04:43:43,570 --> 04:43:44,110
Come on.

6807
04:43:44,290 --> 04:43:44,910
Come on.

6808
04:43:45,190 --> 04:43:45,730
Come on.

6809
04:43:47,990 --> 04:43:48,670
Oh, ouch.

6810
04:43:51,530 --> 04:43:53,190
All I've been doing is running away.

6811
04:43:54,630 --> 04:44:03,230
I still have a lot of rations, so I think we're mostly good, but at the same time, it's better to be safe than sorry, you know?

6812
04:44:03,530 --> 04:44:03,930
Yeah.

6813
04:44:04,230 --> 04:44:04,630
Yeah.

6814
04:44:08,360 --> 04:44:09,100
Oh, my God.

6815
04:44:09,200 --> 04:44:09,740
Oh, my God.

6816
04:44:11,300 --> 04:44:12,540
That's good, Snake.

6817
04:44:12,680 --> 04:44:13,440
That's good, Snake.

6818
04:44:15,200 --> 04:44:16,100
Can he, like...

6819
04:44:17,200 --> 04:44:18,120
Oh, my God.

6820
04:44:25,660 --> 04:44:26,060
Hadoop.

6821
04:44:27,020 --> 04:44:27,420
Hadoop.

6822
04:44:28,680 --> 04:44:33,180
Why is it that every time he punches me, it

6823
04:44:36,270 --> 04:44:39,570
makes me, like, start losing blood?

6824
04:44:44,790 --> 04:44:45,830
Hurt me more.

6825
04:44:51,450 --> 04:44:51,970
Nice.

6826
04:44:54,190 --> 04:44:54,910
Come here.

6827
04:44:55,070 --> 04:44:55,370
Come here.

6828
04:44:55,510 --> 04:44:56,230
Cause of the age.

6829
04:44:59,810 --> 04:45:01,570
You can't even punch well, Ninja.

6830
04:45:03,570 --> 04:45:08,450
Oh, I totally missed you.

6831
04:45:13,910 --> 04:45:15,170
I can't punch well.

6832
04:45:15,190 --> 04:45:18,290
Oh, his knife hands.

6833
04:45:18,430 --> 04:45:18,890
Got it.

6834
04:45:19,150 --> 04:45:20,730
I love if I just touch him.

6835
04:45:20,750 --> 04:45:21,630
It hurts me, though, even.

6836
04:45:25,380 --> 04:45:26,380
Hurt me more!

6837
04:45:33,740 --> 04:45:35,200
Oh, just a little bit.

6838
04:45:35,320 --> 04:45:36,060
Just a little bit more.

6839
04:45:37,020 --> 04:45:37,500
Ouch!

6840
04:45:42,030 --> 04:45:42,730
I'm trying!

6841
04:45:43,550 --> 04:45:44,390
Stand still!

6842
04:45:45,670 --> 04:45:46,630
I'll hurt you!

6843
04:45:46,690 --> 04:45:47,190
I'll hurt you!

6844
04:45:48,370 --> 04:45:48,850
Ouch!

6845
04:45:50,330 --> 04:45:50,870
It's OK.

6846
04:45:54,070 --> 04:45:54,510
Yippee!

6847
04:45:54,630 --> 04:45:54,950
OK.

6848
04:45:55,430 --> 04:45:56,590
Don't touch him.

6849
04:45:57,070 --> 04:45:58,210
Don't touch him.

6850
04:45:58,950 --> 04:45:59,390
Wait.

6851
04:45:59,390 --> 04:45:59,990
Yeah, yeah.

6852
04:46:00,010 --> 04:46:00,590
Don't touch him.

6853
04:46:01,190 --> 04:46:01,990
Don't touch him.

6854
04:46:03,110 --> 04:46:03,550
Shoot.

6855
04:46:03,550 --> 04:46:04,210
Shoot him.

6856
04:46:08,130 --> 04:46:09,730
He's gonna go...

6857
04:46:12,590 --> 04:46:15,830
Oh, my God!

6858
04:46:17,170 --> 04:46:17,610
See,

6859
04:46:22,670 --> 04:46:25,050
this is what we could have been doing the whole time, but someone...

6860
04:46:25,650 --> 04:46:26,250
had to be like...

6861
04:46:26,250 --> 04:46:28,110
all over the place.

6862
04:46:28,930 --> 04:46:29,830
It's also mean.

6863
04:46:29,950 --> 04:46:31,030
I was running everywhere, too.

6864
04:46:35,930 --> 04:46:38,110
This guy was avoiding bullets!

6865
04:46:38,490 --> 04:46:39,610
And then...

6866
04:46:41,670 --> 04:46:42,150
Wait.

6867
04:46:47,100 --> 04:46:47,420
Wait.

6868
04:46:47,480 --> 04:46:48,620
Where's the last part of the fight?

6869
04:46:50,920 --> 04:46:52,280
Where's the last part of the fight?

6870
04:46:52,860 --> 04:46:55,140
Is he dead?

6871
04:46:56,460 --> 04:46:58,160
No... No Electro Phase?

6872
04:46:59,280 --> 04:46:59,960
Say it!

6873
04:47:04,320 --> 04:47:04,840
Zanzibar!

6874
04:47:09,740 --> 04:47:10,260
Wait.

6875
04:47:10,260 --> 04:47:11,020
Is it here?

6876
04:47:11,540 --> 04:47:12,060
No.

6877
04:47:12,120 --> 04:47:12,840
This happens anyway.

6878
04:47:13,100 --> 04:47:13,620
Right?

6879
04:47:15,960 --> 04:47:17,360
And he goes...

6880
04:47:21,160 --> 04:47:24,520
I love how they kept this part, even though it was a...

6881
04:47:24,520 --> 04:47:26,900
dropped subplot.

6882
04:47:28,580 --> 04:47:29,180
Crazy!

6883
04:47:30,680 --> 04:47:31,960
Bang your head on the floor!

6884
04:47:32,180 --> 04:47:32,520
Oh!

6885
04:47:33,080 --> 04:47:34,160
Oh, my God!

6886
04:47:34,500 --> 04:47:35,860
Gray Fox, no!

6887
04:47:37,280 --> 04:47:38,020
Oh, my God!

6888
04:47:38,120 --> 04:47:38,560
Oh!

6889
04:47:38,560 --> 04:47:39,420
Oh, no!

6890
04:47:39,920 --> 04:47:41,060
Oh, he's crazy!

6891
04:47:42,720 --> 04:47:43,740
What's going on?

6892
04:47:52,910 --> 04:47:54,110
Gray Fox!

6893
04:47:54,470 --> 04:47:54,850
Oh!

6894
04:47:54,850 --> 04:47:54,930
Oh!

6895
04:47:56,390 --> 04:47:57,270
Are you just gonna...

6896
04:47:57,270 --> 04:47:57,930
Are you...

6897
04:47:58,690 --> 04:47:59,130
Uh...

6898
04:47:59,130 --> 04:47:59,630
Uh...

6899
04:47:59,630 --> 04:48:00,850
Is it over?

6900
04:48:01,210 --> 04:48:02,250
Are you just gonna run out?

6901
04:48:05,290 --> 04:48:05,730
Um...

6902
04:48:07,270 --> 04:48:08,150
The medicine...

6903
04:48:10,610 --> 04:48:11,770
Take your meds, everybody.

6904
04:48:25,190 --> 04:48:27,290
Snake, this might be a good time to move.

6905
04:48:29,450 --> 04:48:30,970
Snake, this might be a good...

6906
04:48:30,970 --> 04:48:32,870
Why is he always just standing there?

6907
04:48:34,030 --> 04:48:36,910
He stood there and got blasted by the tank.

6908
04:48:37,270 --> 04:48:37,710
Gray Fox.

6909
04:48:38,910 --> 04:48:40,990
Colonel, that ninja is Gray Fox.

6910
04:48:41,310 --> 04:48:42,550
No doubt about it.

6911
04:48:43,330 --> 04:48:43,810
Ridiculous.

6912
04:48:43,830 --> 04:48:44,390
He said it.

6913
04:48:44,470 --> 04:48:46,490
You, yourself, in Zanzibar land.

6914
04:48:46,570 --> 04:48:47,730
He said, I'm Gray Fox.

6915
04:48:48,310 --> 04:48:50,970
He should have been killed, but he's still alive.

6916
04:48:51,590 --> 04:48:51,970
What?

6917
04:48:52,450 --> 04:48:54,590
It happened before I joined Fox Health Medical Staff.

6918
04:48:54,590 --> 04:48:55,630
What do you know about that, Naomi, huh?

6919
04:48:55,910 --> 04:48:58,570
They were using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.

6920
04:48:58,570 --> 04:48:59,430
What do you know about that, Naomi?

6921
04:48:59,530 --> 04:49:00,550
I never heard that.

6922
04:49:00,790 --> 04:49:00,970
Hm?

6923
04:49:01,090 --> 04:49:02,530
It happened right after you retired.

6924
04:49:02,530 --> 04:49:05,350
My predecessor, Dr. Clark, was in charge.

6925
04:49:05,750 --> 04:49:06,750
Dr. Clark?

6926
04:49:06,810 --> 04:49:07,110
Yes.

6927
04:49:07,130 --> 04:49:08,010
Dr. Clark.

6928
04:49:08,030 --> 04:49:09,730
He started the gene therapy project.

6929
04:49:10,130 --> 04:49:11,390
And where is he now?

6930
04:49:11,730 --> 04:49:12,230
Dead.

6931
04:49:12,270 --> 04:49:14,870
He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.

6932
04:49:15,210 --> 04:49:16,730
So what about this soldier?

6933
04:49:17,430 --> 04:49:23,610
Apparently, for their test subject, they decided to use the body of a soldier who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar land.

6934
04:49:24,130 --> 04:49:25,670
And that was Gray Fox.

6935
04:49:26,190 --> 04:49:27,830
But he was already dead.

6936
04:49:28,250 --> 04:49:28,650
Yes.

6937
04:49:29,090 --> 04:49:30,790
I miss English, Naomi.

6938
04:49:30,790 --> 04:49:32,610
Here, I'll redo the lines.

6939
04:49:33,190 --> 04:49:38,910
They fed him with a prototype exos while they experimented on him like a plaything.

6940
04:49:38,930 --> 04:49:42,530
Today's genome soldiers were born from those experiments.

6941
04:49:42,790 --> 04:49:44,930
That's the sickest thing I've ever heard.

6942
04:49:46,710 --> 04:49:48,270
I'm sorry, Colonel.

6943
04:49:48,570 --> 04:49:51,850
I didn't think my accent would offend you so much.

6944
04:49:52,190 --> 04:49:54,190
Because it's confidential information.

6945
04:49:54,530 --> 04:49:56,150
Is that the only reason?

6946
04:49:58,930 --> 04:50:01,530
Naomi, what happened to Gray Fox after that?

6947
04:50:01,770 --> 04:50:03,730
The records said he died in an accident.

6948
04:50:04,110 --> 04:50:04,950
I see.

6949
04:50:05,010 --> 04:50:05,470
I'm sorry.

6950
04:50:05,930 --> 04:50:08,130
But even if that ninja is Gray Fox...

6951
04:50:08,130 --> 04:50:10,150
He hated it.

6952
04:50:10,490 --> 04:50:12,230
From what I could tell...

6953
04:50:12,230 --> 04:50:13,210
That was Australian?

6954
04:50:14,150 --> 04:50:17,130
You're saying he's just living off his will to fight?

6955
04:50:17,490 --> 04:50:18,430
I'm not sure.

6956
04:50:18,630 --> 04:50:21,510
But he seems intent on fighting me to the death.

6957
04:50:21,830 --> 04:50:22,890
We'll meet again.

6958
04:50:23,030 --> 04:50:24,050
I know it.

6959
04:50:24,150 --> 04:50:24,670
Yeah.

6960
04:50:24,670 --> 04:50:25,270
Until you fight again?

6961
04:50:26,070 --> 04:50:27,290
Until you kill him?

6962
04:50:27,430 --> 04:50:27,970
Shut up, Naomi.

6963
04:50:29,010 --> 04:50:29,970
I'd rather not.

6964
04:50:30,490 --> 04:50:32,030
But maybe that's what he wants.

6965
04:50:32,050 --> 04:50:32,750
That's what he wants.

6966
04:50:32,770 --> 04:50:33,910
He said, hurt me more.

6967
04:50:34,270 --> 04:50:35,310
It was consensual.

6968
04:50:37,070 --> 04:50:38,610
Look at the little GameCube.

6969
04:50:40,450 --> 04:50:41,470
Oh my gosh.

6970
04:50:41,770 --> 04:50:42,650
It's so cute.

6971
04:50:43,090 --> 04:50:44,030
It looks just like...

6972
04:50:44,030 --> 04:50:44,350
Actually...

6973
04:50:44,350 --> 04:50:45,690
Sorry, my GameCube is black.

6974
04:50:46,610 --> 04:50:48,150
I was going to say it looks just like mine.

6975
04:50:48,310 --> 04:50:48,870
It is not.

6976
04:50:48,910 --> 04:50:49,570
Are you one of them?

6977
04:50:50,210 --> 04:50:50,990
An anime?

6978
04:50:51,130 --> 04:50:51,710
No, I'm not.

6979
04:50:51,990 --> 04:50:53,190
I always work alone.

6980
04:50:54,670 --> 04:50:55,070
Alone?

6981
04:50:56,550 --> 04:50:58,130
Are you an otaku too?

6982
04:50:59,430 --> 04:51:00,190
Come on.

6983
04:51:00,310 --> 04:51:00,850
Get out.

6984
04:51:01,010 --> 04:51:02,290
We can't stay here forever.

6985
04:51:02,630 --> 04:51:05,470
Snake in the Twin Snakes is so mean to Otacon.

6986
04:51:05,950 --> 04:51:07,310
He's so like...

6987
04:51:07,310 --> 04:51:09,150
In the original, he's kind of like...

6988
04:51:09,150 --> 04:51:10,530
He's like soft boy.

6989
04:51:10,710 --> 04:51:11,450
Your uniform is different from theirs.

6990
04:51:11,510 --> 04:51:12,810
But in this game, he's like...

6991
04:51:12,810 --> 04:51:13,550
Otacon.

6992
04:51:13,810 --> 04:51:14,670
Get up.

6993
04:51:16,630 --> 04:51:17,950
He's so mean to him.

6994
04:51:18,010 --> 04:51:18,710
You know me?

6995
04:51:18,910 --> 04:51:19,730
Aw, Hal.

6996
04:51:19,730 --> 04:51:21,130
I heard about you from Meryl.

6997
04:51:21,510 --> 04:51:21,990
Oh.

6998
04:51:23,050 --> 04:51:24,650
So you're here to rescue me?

6999
04:51:24,650 --> 04:51:25,410
Ugh.

7000
04:51:25,590 --> 04:51:27,150
My headphones are starting to hurt my ears.

7001
04:51:27,350 --> 04:51:27,370
Sorry.

7002
04:51:27,490 --> 04:51:29,270
There's something that I've got to do first.

7003
04:51:31,570 --> 04:51:32,050
Oh.

7004
04:51:32,350 --> 04:51:32,830
Oh.

7005
04:51:32,990 --> 04:51:33,270
Oh.

7006
04:51:33,590 --> 04:51:34,610
His beady eyes.

7007
04:51:34,610 --> 04:51:35,450
Well, at least you're not one of them.

7008
04:51:41,730 --> 04:51:42,930
Are you hurt?

7009
04:51:49,940 --> 04:51:50,640
I'm okay.

7010
04:51:51,160 --> 04:51:53,780
I just twisted my ankle a little trying to get away.

7011
04:51:54,040 --> 04:51:54,320
My boy.

7012
04:51:54,320 --> 04:51:54,680
It's okay.

7013
04:51:54,740 --> 04:51:56,700
My son is used to people being mean to him.

7014
04:51:57,260 --> 04:51:58,240
Stop, Yui.

7015
04:51:58,780 --> 04:52:00,820
I need information about Metal Gear.

7016
04:52:00,960 --> 04:52:01,180
Metal Gear.

7017
04:52:01,180 --> 04:52:01,500
Metal Gear.

7018
04:52:01,520 --> 04:52:01,820
Huh?

7019
04:52:02,080 --> 04:52:02,400
Huh?

7020
04:52:02,720 --> 04:52:03,260
Metal Gear?

7021
04:52:03,840 --> 04:52:04,320
Yeah.

7022
04:52:04,520 --> 04:52:06,240
Oh, the posters aren't in this one.

7023
04:52:06,280 --> 04:52:06,600
That's...

7024
04:52:06,600 --> 04:52:07,080
What's Metal Gear really designed for?

7025
04:52:07,280 --> 04:52:07,560
Oh, wait.

7026
04:52:08,460 --> 04:52:10,120
It's a mobile TMD.

7027
04:52:10,200 --> 04:52:10,660
Wait.

7028
04:52:10,720 --> 04:52:11,380
What is that poster?

7029
04:52:11,400 --> 04:52:12,540
It's designed to shoot down nuclear missiles.

7030
04:52:12,620 --> 04:52:13,200
It's not a police mod.

7031
04:52:13,200 --> 04:52:14,740
Only for defensive purposes, of course.

7032
04:52:15,440 --> 04:52:15,920
Liar.

7033
04:52:15,920 --> 04:52:16,140
What?

7034
04:52:16,340 --> 04:52:19,560
I already know that Metal Gear is nothing but a nuclear equipped...

7035
04:52:19,560 --> 04:52:20,740
Stop shaking him.

7036
04:52:21,260 --> 04:52:21,740
...working death on you.

7037
04:52:21,740 --> 04:52:22,160
A nuclear?

7038
04:52:22,660 --> 04:52:23,140
What are you talking about?

7039
04:52:23,140 --> 04:52:24,380
Why are you acting like a bully?

7040
04:52:24,680 --> 04:52:26,440
He's like a high school bully to him.

7041
04:52:26,840 --> 04:52:28,800
The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a nuclear missile.

7042
04:52:29,000 --> 04:52:29,360
You tell me you didn't know.

7043
04:52:29,360 --> 04:52:30,460
Oh, it's Zone of the Enders.

7044
04:52:30,480 --> 04:52:31,440
Oh my god.

7045
04:52:31,440 --> 04:52:36,040
Aren't they just trying to use the TMD missile module to launch a disabled nuclear warhead?

7046
04:52:36,040 --> 04:52:38,860
He's so unbothered by it, which is even funnier.

7047
04:52:39,100 --> 04:52:44,540
The purpose of this exercise was to test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear warhead.

7048
04:52:44,640 --> 04:52:47,280
The terrorists are just continuing the work you started.

7049
04:52:47,860 --> 04:52:48,420
No.

7050
04:52:48,580 --> 04:52:49,280
You're wrong.

7051
04:52:49,760 --> 04:52:52,240
I heard it directly from your boss, Baker.

7052
04:52:53,800 --> 04:52:54,360
No.

7053
04:52:54,860 --> 04:52:55,420
No.

7054
04:52:55,440 --> 04:52:57,480
A nuclear missile on Rex?

7055
04:52:57,840 --> 04:52:58,080
No.

7056
04:52:58,680 --> 04:53:00,340
So you really didn't know.

7057
04:53:00,660 --> 04:53:01,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

7058
04:53:01,440 --> 04:53:01,580
The president of Nauticon.

7059
04:53:02,300 --> 04:53:03,320
Little baby.

7060
04:53:05,920 --> 04:53:06,980
He's like, er...

7061
04:53:06,980 --> 04:53:07,480
No!

7062
04:53:08,340 --> 04:53:11,280
All the armament was built by a separate department...

7063
04:53:11,280 --> 04:53:11,720
The...

7064
04:53:11,720 --> 04:53:15,100
And the president personally supervised the final assembly with the main unit.

7065
04:53:15,180 --> 04:53:17,120
The picture on his badge looks like...

7066
04:53:17,120 --> 04:53:17,740
President Baker.

7067
04:53:18,080 --> 04:53:18,640
Yes.

7068
04:53:18,640 --> 04:53:19,680
Looks like his PS...

7069
04:53:19,680 --> 04:53:20,140
Metal Gear model.

7070
04:53:20,140 --> 04:53:22,440
I was never told what they armed Rex with.

7071
04:53:22,800 --> 04:53:26,920
I only know it's equipped with a Vulcan Cannon, a laser and a railgun.

7072
04:53:27,400 --> 04:53:27,960
Railgun!

7073
04:53:30,620 --> 04:53:31,420
Do you guys know what I mean?

7074
04:53:31,440 --> 04:53:32,460
Do you guys remember that old video?

7075
04:53:33,520 --> 04:53:34,280
Nail gun!

7076
04:53:37,360 --> 04:53:40,020
Every time they say rail gun it makes me want to say it.

7077
04:53:41,480 --> 04:53:42,400
Rail gun!

7078
04:53:42,400 --> 04:53:42,720
Good!

7079
04:53:57,960 --> 04:54:01,860
Rex is so cute.

7080
04:54:12,420 --> 04:54:14,380
But that's not all I think.

7081
04:54:14,540 --> 04:54:20,260
If Metal Gear fired only standard nuclear missiles, then they should already have all the practical data they need.

7082
04:54:20,620 --> 04:54:22,660
Thank you so much!

7083
04:54:29,560 --> 04:54:35,280
Metal Gear's co-developer, Rivermore National Labs, was working on a new type of nuclear weapon.

7084
04:54:35,660 --> 04:54:41,060
They were using NOVA and NIF laser nuclear fusion testing equipment and super computers.

7085
04:54:41,600 --> 04:54:43,940
So they developed a new type of nuclear weapon.

7086
04:54:43,960 --> 04:54:45,760
A nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab, huh?

7087
04:54:46,120 --> 04:54:46,740
Yes.

7088
04:54:47,080 --> 04:54:50,000
But you can't use virtual data on a battlefield.

7089
04:54:50,400 --> 04:54:52,620
They would need actual launch data.

7090
04:54:54,600 --> 04:54:56,900
These are some of the super computers.

7091
04:54:58,980 --> 04:55:02,380
If you link these, you can test everything in a virtual environment.

7092
04:55:03,160 --> 04:55:04,920
But it's all just theoretical.

7093
04:55:06,360 --> 04:55:09,980
So, this exercise was designed to test the real thing.

7094
04:55:10,760 --> 04:55:12,880
What did our president do?

7095
04:55:13,960 --> 04:55:14,600
He took a lot of time.

7096
04:55:14,940 --> 04:55:17,500
Did the terrorists launch that thing?

7097
04:55:18,960 --> 04:55:19,640
No.

7098
04:55:19,880 --> 04:55:21,140
Oh, and then your Nikes.

7099
04:55:21,580 --> 04:55:22,200
Damn!

7100
04:55:23,260 --> 04:55:23,940
Damn!

7101
04:55:24,380 --> 04:55:24,900
Damn.

7102
04:55:26,620 --> 04:55:27,300
Holy...

7103
04:55:27,300 --> 04:55:28,700
I'm such a fool.

7104
04:55:28,880 --> 04:55:29,240
Snakes.

7105
04:55:29,540 --> 04:55:31,100
It's all my fault.

7106
04:55:34,020 --> 04:55:35,400
No, it's all...

7107
04:55:35,400 --> 04:55:36,320
The truth is...

7108
04:55:37,940 --> 04:55:40,860
My grandfather was part of the Manhattan Project.

7109
04:55:41,320 --> 04:55:41,540
Ah.

7110
04:55:42,780 --> 04:55:45,540
He suffered with a guilt for the rest of his life.

7111
04:55:46,680 --> 04:55:47,760
And my father?

7112
04:55:48,980 --> 04:55:51,660
He was born on August 6th, 1945.

7113
04:55:52,500 --> 04:55:54,200
The day of the Hiroshima bomb.

7114
04:55:54,620 --> 04:55:55,540
Huey is the devil.

7115
04:55:55,560 --> 04:55:57,060
God's got a sense of humor, all right.

7116
04:55:57,240 --> 04:55:58,040
He is the devil.

7117
04:55:58,040 --> 04:55:59,760
Three generations of Emmerich men.

7118
04:56:01,300 --> 04:56:02,160
Can't with that.

7119
04:56:02,200 --> 04:56:05,760
We must have the curse of nuclear weapons written into our DNA.

7120
04:56:06,780 --> 04:56:07,740
Oh, Huey.

7121
04:56:08,080 --> 04:56:10,320
I used to think that I could use science...

7122
04:56:10,320 --> 04:56:10,340
That guy sucks.

7123
04:56:10,340 --> 04:56:11,260
...to help mankind.

7124
04:56:12,520 --> 04:56:13,860
He's the literal devil.

7125
04:56:14,140 --> 04:56:15,600
I was the one being used.

7126
04:56:15,820 --> 04:56:16,700
No, Hal.

7127
04:56:16,800 --> 04:56:17,380
You didn't know.

7128
04:56:17,420 --> 04:56:18,120
Using science for peace.

7129
04:56:19,260 --> 04:56:20,640
That's only in anime.

7130
04:56:21,020 --> 04:56:22,440
Oh, no, Hal.

7131
04:56:24,980 --> 04:56:26,120
That's enough crying.

7132
04:56:26,360 --> 04:56:27,420
Pull yourself together.

7133
04:56:29,480 --> 04:56:31,060
You're so mean in this.

7134
04:56:31,320 --> 04:56:33,280
Where on this base are they keeping it?

7135
04:56:35,340 --> 04:56:36,660
Anime is real, Hal.

7136
04:56:37,460 --> 04:56:37,980
Yeah.

7137
04:56:38,140 --> 04:56:40,100
Rex is in the underground maintenance base.

7138
04:56:40,680 --> 04:56:41,360
Where's that?

7139
04:56:41,840 --> 04:56:42,420
Where's that?

7140
04:56:42,420 --> 04:56:43,560
North of the communications tower.

7141
04:56:44,000 --> 04:56:45,520
But it's a long way there.

7142
04:56:45,740 --> 04:56:46,160
Is it?

7143
04:56:46,240 --> 04:56:49,260
The emergency override system for the detonation code is there, too.

7144
04:56:49,480 --> 04:56:49,920
Yeah.

7145
04:56:50,260 --> 04:56:51,840
In the base's control room.

7146
04:56:52,380 --> 04:56:53,400
You'd better hurry.

7147
04:56:53,640 --> 04:56:57,840
If they were planning a launch from the start, then their ballistic program is probably finished.

7148
04:56:58,120 --> 04:57:01,580
And since they haven't called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.

7149
04:57:01,760 --> 04:57:04,340
In other words, they must be ready to launch.

7150
04:57:04,700 --> 04:57:06,000
We gotta go stop it.

7151
04:57:06,020 --> 04:57:07,200
Meryl's got the detonation code override keys.

7152
04:57:07,260 --> 04:57:10,040
Yeah, we gotta put in the override keys and stop it for sure.

7153
04:57:10,060 --> 04:57:10,320
If we can't override the power, we'll make up for it.

7154
04:57:10,320 --> 04:57:12,300
We'll have to destroy Rex.

7155
04:57:12,600 --> 04:57:12,840
Yeah!

7156
04:57:13,080 --> 04:57:13,960
Oh, no!

7157
04:57:14,860 --> 04:57:18,060
I need to use that guy in a later game.

7158
04:57:20,400 --> 04:57:21,100
Oh, you're hurt.

7159
04:57:21,100 --> 04:57:23,480
On that leg of yours, you'll just slow me down.

7160
04:57:23,740 --> 04:57:23,840
Oh.

7161
04:57:24,980 --> 04:57:27,200
You'll need me if you're gonna destroy Rex.

7162
04:57:27,480 --> 04:57:27,840
True.

7163
04:57:28,100 --> 04:57:28,980
I don't need you.

7164
04:57:29,200 --> 04:57:30,460
I just need your brain.

7165
04:57:31,200 --> 04:57:33,160
Hey, you said earlier I need that guy.

7166
04:57:33,180 --> 04:57:33,460
I created Rex.

7167
04:57:33,700 --> 04:57:34,660
It's my right.

7168
04:57:34,840 --> 04:57:36,780
My duty to destroy him.

7169
04:57:36,820 --> 04:57:37,820
If you get a chance...

7170
04:57:37,820 --> 04:57:37,980
Hey!

7171
04:57:38,160 --> 04:57:38,900
...try to escape.

7172
04:57:38,980 --> 04:57:39,620
Don't do that.

7173
04:57:39,640 --> 04:57:40,300
When the coast is gone...

7174
04:57:40,300 --> 04:57:42,240
...I'll contact you by codec.

7175
04:57:42,760 --> 04:57:43,240
Oh.

7176
04:57:43,240 --> 04:57:45,700
How am I supposed to escape from an island?

7177
04:57:47,140 --> 04:57:47,620
Hmm.

7178
04:57:48,720 --> 04:57:49,200
Okay.

7179
04:57:49,620 --> 04:57:49,940
Yeah.

7180
04:57:50,620 --> 04:57:51,700
Last luck on the membership.

7181
04:57:51,920 --> 04:57:52,280
Thank you.

7182
04:57:52,300 --> 04:57:53,320
Thank you guys for joining my membership.

7183
04:57:53,320 --> 04:57:53,360
I really appreciate it.

7184
04:57:53,360 --> 04:57:55,440
I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.

7185
04:57:55,700 --> 04:57:57,480
You know this place well, don't you?

7186
04:57:57,960 --> 04:57:59,060
Of course I do.

7187
04:57:59,260 --> 04:58:00,140
And don't worry.

7188
04:58:00,500 --> 04:58:01,460
I've got this.

7189
04:58:03,120 --> 04:58:03,600
Oh.

7190
04:58:03,640 --> 04:58:03,920
Whoa.

7191
04:58:04,420 --> 04:58:06,800
It's the same stealth technology as the ninja.

7192
04:58:07,000 --> 04:58:07,860
He looks so much like...

7193
04:58:07,860 --> 04:58:09,360
...Foxhound was gonna use them, but...

7194
04:58:09,360 --> 04:58:10,280
With the glasses.

7195
04:58:10,300 --> 04:58:11,080
...I'll be fine.

7196
04:58:11,360 --> 04:58:12,480
Bad leg and all.

7197
04:58:12,580 --> 04:58:14,660
And he looks so much like MGS1.

7198
04:58:14,780 --> 04:58:14,960
Good.

7199
04:58:14,960 --> 04:58:16,560
But I want Meryl to watch after you too.

7200
04:58:17,240 --> 04:58:17,680
Oh.

7201
04:58:17,860 --> 04:58:17,980
Autobot.

7202
04:58:17,980 --> 04:58:18,860
Thank you for the birthday.

7203
04:58:19,140 --> 04:58:19,440
Wait.

7204
04:58:19,480 --> 04:58:20,240
Did Sneak just smile?

7205
04:58:20,620 --> 04:58:21,380
That's my 7B32.

7206
04:58:21,860 --> 04:58:22,240
Thank you.

7207
04:58:22,280 --> 04:58:22,340
Meryl.

7208
04:58:22,340 --> 04:58:22,800
The engineer is okay.

7209
04:58:23,280 --> 04:58:24,080
That's a relief.

7210
04:58:24,340 --> 04:58:25,680
I want you to look after him.

7211
04:58:25,680 --> 04:58:26,460
That music.

7212
04:58:26,560 --> 04:58:26,700
Where are you now?

7213
04:58:27,040 --> 04:58:27,840
Very close.

7214
04:58:28,080 --> 04:58:28,480
There she is.

7215
04:58:28,600 --> 04:58:28,760
Over there.

7216
04:58:28,760 --> 04:58:29,340
Oh no.

7217
04:58:29,820 --> 04:58:30,260
Damn.

7218
04:58:30,420 --> 04:58:31,300
They spotted me.

7219
04:58:31,880 --> 04:58:32,520
Oh no.

7220
04:58:33,300 --> 04:58:33,740
Meryl.

7221
04:58:33,740 --> 04:58:34,460
What happened?

7222
04:58:34,640 --> 04:58:35,040
Meryl.

7223
04:58:35,540 --> 04:58:35,980
Meryl.

7224
04:58:38,100 --> 04:58:38,540
Mario.

7225
04:58:40,300 --> 04:58:42,080
Mario, did you hear something?

7226
04:58:43,000 --> 04:58:44,760
Wasn't that some kind of music?

7227
04:58:44,960 --> 04:58:46,120
Some kind of music.

7228
04:58:46,220 --> 04:58:46,640
Mario!

7229
04:58:46,820 --> 04:58:47,820
What did she look like?

7230
04:58:50,000 --> 04:58:51,560
She's got a nice butt.

7231
04:58:52,600 --> 04:58:53,800
We know that for sure.

7232
04:58:54,400 --> 04:58:56,140
She's kinda cute the way she walks.

7233
04:58:58,020 --> 04:59:01,900
She... she was wearing the same green uniform as the terrorists.

7234
04:59:05,260 --> 04:59:05,780
Oh.

7235
04:59:06,920 --> 04:59:07,560
And she...

7236
04:59:07,560 --> 04:59:10,660
If she's disguised as the enemy, Huh?

7237
04:59:11,080 --> 04:59:11,560
Wait!

7238
04:59:11,800 --> 04:59:13,020
You didn't talk about her butt!

7239
04:59:14,520 --> 04:59:15,000
Otacon!

7240
04:59:15,540 --> 04:59:16,900
You didn't talk about her butt!

7241
04:59:19,540 --> 04:59:22,260
Oh, the girl's bathroom.

7242
04:59:25,400 --> 04:59:27,100
Otacon is a gentleman now.

7243
04:59:29,980 --> 04:59:33,000
You guys, it was too raunchy for Nintendo, okay?

7244
04:59:35,780 --> 04:59:37,960
Nintendo said... No, no, no.

7245
04:59:38,520 --> 04:59:40,500
No talking about girl's butts, please.

7246
04:59:40,500 --> 04:59:41,160
You're not in pain, are you?

7247
04:59:41,540 --> 04:59:44,300
You feel okay?

7248
04:59:45,520 --> 04:59:47,080
Nothing bothering you?

7249
04:59:47,940 --> 04:59:48,740
What's wrong?

7250
04:59:49,540 --> 04:59:51,480
You're all friendly all of a sudden.

7251
04:59:52,860 --> 04:59:53,780
No, nothing.

7252
04:59:53,980 --> 04:59:56,260
I'm just glad you're okay.

7253
04:59:57,320 --> 04:59:58,460
You're strange.

7254
05:00:00,420 --> 05:00:01,560
I'm a little nervous.

7255
05:00:01,560 --> 05:00:04,180
Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies.

7256
05:00:05,820 --> 05:00:06,880
You're bad luck.

7257
05:00:07,160 --> 05:00:08,240
You're bad luck.

7258
05:00:09,220 --> 05:00:10,160
Forget it, doctor.

7259
05:00:11,360 --> 05:00:13,960
If I shoot those guys, do they make sounds like Kero-tan?

7260
05:00:15,180 --> 05:00:16,660
Call me Otacon.

7261
05:00:17,020 --> 05:00:18,380
Stands for Otaku Convention.

7262
05:00:18,500 --> 05:00:18,980
Oh, sorry.

7263
05:00:19,040 --> 05:00:19,500
Spoilers.

7264
05:00:19,500 --> 05:00:19,700
Sorry.

7265
05:00:19,860 --> 05:00:21,040
What does it stand for?

7266
05:00:21,260 --> 05:00:21,960
It stands for Otaku Convention.

7267
05:00:22,900 --> 05:00:25,560
And Otaku is a guy like me who likes Japanimation.

7268
05:00:26,220 --> 05:00:26,700
Yeah!

7269
05:00:27,280 --> 05:00:27,760
Oh!

7270
05:00:27,800 --> 05:00:28,180
Oh!

7271
05:00:28,200 --> 05:00:28,480
Yeah!

7272
05:00:28,800 --> 05:00:29,280
Yeah!

7273
05:00:29,340 --> 05:00:29,720
Yeah!

7274
05:00:29,800 --> 05:00:30,260
Yeah!

7275
05:00:30,360 --> 05:00:30,640
Yeah!

7276
05:00:30,720 --> 05:00:31,540
Is this the one?

7277
05:00:31,560 --> 05:00:32,120
Is this the one of the Enders?

7278
05:00:32,500 --> 05:00:33,420
Oh, there it is!

7279
05:00:33,500 --> 05:00:33,820
Yeah, yeah!

7280
05:00:33,900 --> 05:00:36,220
The first country to successfully make bipedal robots.

7281
05:00:36,700 --> 05:00:38,940
They're still the best in the field of robotics.

7282
05:00:40,240 --> 05:00:43,260
And Japanese cartoons played some part in that?

7283
05:00:43,460 --> 05:00:44,220
They did.

7284
05:00:44,400 --> 05:00:44,860
They did?

7285
05:00:45,220 --> 05:00:47,820
I didn't get into science to make nuclear weapons, you know.

7286
05:00:47,900 --> 05:00:49,280
I just wanted to make robots.

7287
05:00:49,580 --> 05:00:50,860
Yeah, that's what all scientists do.

7288
05:00:50,860 --> 05:00:53,120
Why are we zooming in on them?

7289
05:00:54,100 --> 05:00:54,600
Stop!

7290
05:00:55,720 --> 05:00:58,380
The product placement is too obvious now.

7291
05:00:58,520 --> 05:00:58,820
Stop it!

7292
05:00:58,820 --> 05:01:00,780
Because I became a scientist because I wanted to make robots like the ones in the Japanese animes.

7293
05:01:01,400 --> 05:01:02,520
Really, it's true.

7294
05:01:03,300 --> 05:01:04,460
Sounds like an excuse to me.

7295
05:01:04,460 --> 05:01:05,000
We get it!

7296
05:01:05,500 --> 05:01:07,200
This is on the GameCube!

7297
05:01:08,720 --> 05:01:09,460
You're right.

7298
05:01:10,040 --> 05:01:11,620
We have to take responsibility.

7299
05:01:11,620 --> 05:01:13,140
Bad luck equals beat out equals boys?

7300
05:01:13,140 --> 05:01:14,900
Science has progressed because there is war.

7301
05:01:15,240 --> 05:01:19,020
And because of scientists' greed, weapons of mass destruction were born.

7302
05:01:19,320 --> 05:01:20,460
But you're not greedy, Otacon.

7303
05:01:20,460 --> 05:01:21,520
But that's all over.

7304
05:01:21,740 --> 05:01:22,700
You just want to make robots.

7305
05:01:22,720 --> 05:01:24,740
I won't take part in murder anymore.

7306
05:01:25,160 --> 05:01:25,400
Yeah.

7307
05:01:26,100 --> 05:01:27,160
You're a good boy.

7308
05:01:27,300 --> 05:01:28,440
You're a good guy, Otacon.

7309
05:01:31,360 --> 05:01:31,760
Whatever.

7310
05:01:32,240 --> 05:01:34,160
All I want from you is information.

7311
05:01:35,460 --> 05:01:35,860
Sure.

7312
05:01:36,140 --> 05:01:37,640
I know everything about this whole base.

7313
05:01:37,640 --> 05:01:38,920
Why you gotta touch him like that, though?

7314
05:01:39,020 --> 05:01:41,140
Ask me anything about Rex or about this place.

7315
05:01:43,140 --> 05:01:47,400
Also, with this stealth camouflage, I can sneak in and out of the armory and mess hall.

7316
05:01:47,680 --> 05:01:50,920
If you need ammo or rations, just tell me and I'll bring them to you.

7317
05:01:51,000 --> 05:01:51,340
Uh-huh.

7318
05:01:51,420 --> 05:01:52,400
Yeah, I know you will.

7319
05:01:52,920 --> 05:01:55,740
I'm on frequency 141.12.

7320
05:01:56,300 --> 05:01:56,900
141.12.

7321
05:01:56,920 --> 05:01:57,060
See you later.

7322
05:01:57,980 --> 05:01:58,780
Bye, Otacon.

7323
05:02:00,780 --> 05:02:01,520
See ya.

7324
05:02:03,020 --> 05:02:03,860
Bye-bye.

7325
05:02:05,040 --> 05:02:06,400
Otacon looks like my uncle?

7326
05:02:06,920 --> 05:02:08,260
You have a hot uncle, then.

7327
05:02:12,580 --> 05:02:13,120
Yippee!

7328
05:02:17,070 --> 05:02:18,470
Did he change his pants?

7329
05:02:19,050 --> 05:02:21,490
I don't think he did.

7330
05:02:23,090 --> 05:02:26,090
Why do they give you bullets in this if...

7331
05:02:26,090 --> 05:02:27,810
Like, can you actually shoot Gray Fox?

7332
05:02:29,250 --> 05:02:30,790
I've always just punched him to death.

7333
05:02:40,140 --> 05:02:40,800
It's clean.

7334
05:02:41,800 --> 05:02:43,580
He must drink a lot of water.

7335
05:02:50,220 --> 05:02:51,260
Oh my gosh!

7336
05:02:51,440 --> 05:02:54,380
That looks similar to the controller I'm using now.

7337
05:02:56,140 --> 05:02:56,740
Wowee!

7338
05:02:57,860 --> 05:02:59,020
It's a GameCube!

7339
05:02:59,360 --> 05:03:00,180
Wait, can I shoot this thing?

7340
05:03:06,740 --> 05:03:07,040
Ow!

7341
05:03:08,720 --> 05:03:09,020
Sorry.

7342
05:03:10,600 --> 05:03:11,200
Pencil.

7343
05:03:17,120 --> 05:03:18,080
Goodbye, Yoshi.

7344
05:03:18,080 --> 05:03:18,180
Yoshi!

7345
05:03:19,140 --> 05:03:19,920
Yoshi!

7346
05:03:21,660 --> 05:03:23,100
Goodbye, Mario.

7347
05:03:27,300 --> 05:03:30,020
Why'd my life show up?

7348
05:03:31,940 --> 05:03:32,640
Yoshi!

7349
05:03:35,980 --> 05:03:36,680
Yoshi!

7350
05:03:39,020 --> 05:03:39,900
So cute!

7351
05:03:39,900 --> 05:03:40,040
So cute!

7352
05:03:51,920 --> 05:03:53,320
Does Mario heal you?

7353
05:03:53,440 --> 05:03:53,900
No way!

7354
05:03:54,500 --> 05:03:55,780
Does Mario heal you?

7355
05:03:56,040 --> 05:03:56,860
Is that why it says...

7356
05:03:57,980 --> 05:03:59,340
That one makes sense!

7357
05:04:02,380 --> 05:04:03,040
What's this?

7358
05:04:03,600 --> 05:04:03,880
Oh!

7359
05:04:04,000 --> 05:04:04,600
It's the...

7360
05:04:05,980 --> 05:04:07,100
That's so funny.

7361
05:04:11,280 --> 05:04:12,440
Wait, what's on this computer?

7362
05:04:12,780 --> 05:04:14,340
Actually, I think he destroyed this computer.

7363
05:04:14,340 --> 05:04:14,880
Oh!

7364
05:04:14,960 --> 05:04:15,420
No, he didn't.

7365
05:04:17,040 --> 05:04:17,600
Accessing...

7366
05:04:17,600 --> 05:04:18,440
Port...

7367
05:04:18,440 --> 05:04:19,680
Some of them.

7368
05:04:20,780 --> 05:04:21,480
Can't tell.

7369
05:04:23,200 --> 05:04:25,120
There's so much science in here.

7370
05:04:25,260 --> 05:04:26,100
So much science!

7371
05:04:28,320 --> 05:04:29,420
I want the box.

7372
05:04:34,770 --> 05:04:35,470
Let's go!

7373
05:04:39,890 --> 05:04:40,450
Um...

7374
05:04:40,450 --> 05:04:41,810
Let's save real quick.

7375
05:04:43,190 --> 05:04:43,750
Maybe?

7376
05:04:45,190 --> 05:04:47,270
Snake, there's an old Chinese saying.

7377
05:04:47,270 --> 05:04:52,350
A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.

7378
05:04:52,970 --> 05:04:54,490
Einstein said it another way.

7379
05:04:54,610 --> 05:04:57,730
He said that only a life lived for others is worth living.

7380
05:04:58,450 --> 05:05:02,270
That's why I entered MIT instead of CMU or Princeton like my friends.

7381
05:05:02,590 --> 05:05:03,530
Boo, Princeton!

7382
05:05:03,910 --> 05:05:05,490
I wanted to do applied physics, not just theoretical stuff.

7383
05:05:05,990 --> 05:05:06,170
Yeah!

7384
05:05:06,530 --> 05:05:07,770
I wanted to make things for people.

7385
05:05:07,770 --> 05:05:09,590
We wanted to do real stuff!

7386
05:05:09,970 --> 05:05:11,410
The Sol -Time -R system or the Codex system.

7387
05:05:11,530 --> 05:05:12,510
You're so awesome, Mei-Ling.

7388
05:05:12,630 --> 05:05:15,350
I just wanted to make something that would be useful for people.

7389
05:05:15,530 --> 05:05:15,790
Yeah!

7390
05:05:15,790 --> 05:05:18,970
I think that it was the same for Dr. Emmerich, too.

7391
05:05:19,270 --> 05:05:21,870
But he was used like a tool.

7392
05:05:22,250 --> 05:05:24,290
Used to make a horrible killing machine.

7393
05:05:24,610 --> 05:05:25,310
Just like Snake.

7394
05:05:26,030 --> 05:05:27,130
Used by everybody.

7395
05:05:27,230 --> 05:05:27,490
As a machine.

7396
05:05:27,490 --> 05:05:30,090
It would be better if engineers like us just stopped making things.

7397
05:05:31,150 --> 05:05:31,970
I don't know.

7398
05:05:32,230 --> 05:05:32,650
No!

7399
05:05:33,070 --> 05:05:33,890
No, you're wrong.

7400
05:05:34,430 --> 05:05:37,830
There's at least one person whose life has gotten better as a result of your inventions.

7401
05:05:38,510 --> 05:05:38,950
Me.

7402
05:05:39,130 --> 05:05:39,510
Me?

7403
05:05:40,030 --> 05:05:42,650
Without the Codex, I wouldn't be able to talk to you like this.

7404
05:05:42,830 --> 05:05:43,210
Yeah.

7405
05:05:43,530 --> 05:05:44,290
Thanks, Snake.

7406
05:05:44,290 --> 05:05:44,970
Aw.

7407
05:05:46,270 --> 05:05:46,730
Aw...

7408
05:05:48,630 --> 05:05:49,090
Why?

7409
05:05:54,030 --> 05:05:54,950
So sweet...

7410
05:06:01,090 --> 05:06:02,330
Actually, I forgot.

7411
05:06:03,710 --> 05:06:05,370
I want to see if she still does this.

7412
05:06:05,570 --> 05:06:06,330
Do not say.

7413
05:06:06,470 --> 05:06:07,050
Good luck, Snake.

7414
05:06:07,370 --> 05:06:08,210
Thanks, Mei-Ling.

7415
05:06:10,810 --> 05:06:11,630
What's up, Snake?

7416
05:06:13,230 --> 05:06:14,130
Good luck, Snake.

7417
05:06:14,390 --> 05:06:14,970
Thank you!

7418
05:06:15,310 --> 05:06:15,910
You're welcome.

7419
05:06:16,250 --> 05:06:16,410
Bye, Snake.

7420
05:06:18,310 --> 05:06:19,510
What can I do for you, Snake?

7421
05:06:20,370 --> 05:06:21,450
Come on, Snake.

7422
05:06:21,570 --> 05:06:22,810
Don't call me for no reason.

7423
05:06:23,050 --> 05:06:24,150
I just want to look at your pretty face.

7424
05:06:25,710 --> 05:06:26,630
She gets upset.

7425
05:06:34,510 --> 05:06:35,650
She's so cute.

7426
05:06:37,930 --> 05:06:38,870
She's upset at me.

7427
05:06:41,050 --> 05:06:42,210
Maybe one more time?

7428
05:06:43,410 --> 05:06:44,470
I love the squint.

7429
05:06:50,230 --> 05:06:53,370
She really said...

7430
05:06:57,750 --> 05:06:59,150
Cute.

7431
05:07:18,370 --> 05:07:20,210
But the real problem is your niece.

7432
05:07:21,290 --> 05:07:21,950
She's a problem.

7433
05:07:22,410 --> 05:07:24,110
She was supposed to be a good girl.

7434
05:07:25,330 --> 05:07:26,630
Why wasn't she a good girl?

7435
05:07:27,770 --> 05:07:28,770
Shut up, Naomi.

7436
05:07:28,770 --> 05:07:28,970
Exactly.

7437
05:07:29,790 --> 05:07:32,550
It's just that she's holding the detonation code over IDs.

7438
05:07:32,550 --> 05:07:33,990
Oh, I just thought you were human for a second.

7439
05:07:34,010 --> 05:07:36,350
For our last chance of stopping that nuclear launch.

7440
05:07:36,690 --> 05:07:36,810
No, you're a snake.

7441
05:07:36,810 --> 05:07:37,170
My mistake.

7442
05:07:37,230 --> 05:07:37,950
You're a cold man.

7443
05:07:38,330 --> 05:07:40,710
Your mission is more important than the life of your companions.

7444
05:07:40,830 --> 05:07:41,630
You're a cold man?

7445
05:07:41,630 --> 05:07:42,110
This is war.

7446
05:07:43,010 --> 05:07:44,370
Survival is the name of the game.

7447
05:07:44,910 --> 05:07:46,910
Sometimes you have to be cold to survive.

7448
05:07:47,110 --> 05:07:47,130
But that better mean...

7449
05:07:47,630 --> 05:07:48,310
Yes, but...

7450
05:07:48,310 --> 05:07:53,210
Snake, either way, I want you to find Meryl as soon as possible.

7451
05:07:53,330 --> 05:07:54,070
I understand.

7452
05:07:55,830 --> 05:07:59,090
It is kind of bad that he said that in front of Campbell.

7453
05:07:59,250 --> 05:08:02,690
I feel like in front of the colonel, it feels a little, you know...

7454
05:08:04,050 --> 05:08:04,530
Meryl?

7455
05:08:04,610 --> 05:08:05,170
No response.

7456
05:08:06,890 --> 05:08:08,350
Ah, let's try Master Meryl.

7457
05:08:09,170 --> 05:08:14,110
In war, a split second can mean the difference between victory and defeat.

7458
05:08:14,690 --> 05:08:15,750
Don't ever hesitate.

7459
05:08:16,130 --> 05:08:19,950
The slower you react, the greater the chance that you will be beaten.

7460
05:08:20,250 --> 05:08:21,730
Why does he sound out of breath?

7461
05:08:22,150 --> 05:08:22,710
Did you hear that?

7462
05:08:22,750 --> 05:08:23,350
He was like...

7463
05:08:23,350 --> 05:08:27,230
In war, every second counts.

7464
05:08:27,730 --> 05:08:30,770
Don't think that you will...

7465
05:08:30,770 --> 05:08:33,530
He's like, don't waste any second.

7466
05:08:35,570 --> 05:08:38,090
Why did... are you okay, Master Meryl?

7467
05:08:38,150 --> 05:08:39,370
Are you on the treadmill or something?

7468
05:08:39,790 --> 05:08:42,710
That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby?

7469
05:08:43,050 --> 05:08:45,010
You can't learn that in training.

7470
05:08:45,270 --> 05:08:51,870
You've got to have survived a few firefights, seen a few friends blown away before you learned that trick.

7471
05:08:52,210 --> 05:08:53,330
He sounds so...

7472
05:08:53,350 --> 05:08:54,150
He's so, like, breathy.

7473
05:08:54,270 --> 05:08:55,210
I don't understand why.

7474
05:08:55,850 --> 05:08:56,510
Alright, guys.

7475
05:08:56,590 --> 05:08:59,130
Before we continue onwards, I'm going to go...

7476
05:09:00,430 --> 05:09:03,570
I'm going to set my oven.

7477
05:09:03,770 --> 05:09:07,850
I'm going to turn on my oven and I'm going to set an alarm for like five minutes or something.

7478
05:09:08,550 --> 05:09:10,610
I'll do like ten minutes and then...

7479
05:09:13,130 --> 05:09:14,010
And then...

7480
05:09:14,970 --> 05:09:18,350
Go put my pizza in the oven so I can have some food.

7481
05:09:20,650 --> 05:09:22,210
Bro is getting back shots.

7482
05:09:23,350 --> 05:09:23,890
Back shots?

7483
05:09:24,230 --> 05:09:26,090
While on the... Wait, what's a back shot?

7484
05:09:28,710 --> 05:09:29,930
Okay, clock.

7485
05:09:32,950 --> 05:09:34,370
What time is it?

7486
05:09:37,430 --> 05:09:42,450
Let's set it for not... No, that's not... Let's set it for 9.05.

7487
05:09:43,570 --> 05:09:44,370
Thank you!

7488
05:09:46,650 --> 05:09:47,170
Yeah.

7489
05:09:49,050 --> 05:09:49,990
No, not AM.

7490
05:09:50,110 --> 05:09:50,570
No, no, no.

7491
05:09:50,690 --> 05:09:51,350
PM, PM.

7492
05:09:51,970 --> 05:09:53,310
Okay, set for...

7493
05:09:54,970 --> 05:09:55,870
9 minutes from now.

7494
05:09:55,950 --> 05:09:56,370
Oh, wait.

7495
05:09:56,670 --> 05:09:57,950
Let me set it a little...

7496
05:09:57,950 --> 05:10:00,210
It should heat up in like 10 minutes, alright?

7497
05:10:00,350 --> 05:10:01,250
Okay, I'll be right back.

7498
05:10:01,350 --> 05:10:02,550
I'm going to go heat up...

7499
05:10:02,550 --> 05:10:04,630
Or I'm going to go set the oven for my pizza.

7500
05:10:05,770 --> 05:10:06,130
BRB.

7501
05:10:06,910 --> 05:10:07,770
Don't look it up.

7502
05:10:07,890 --> 05:10:08,430
Wait, what?

7503
05:10:08,810 --> 05:10:09,710
What am I looking up?

7504
05:10:10,250 --> 05:10:10,710
Hold on.

7505
05:10:10,790 --> 05:10:11,150
Hold on!

7506
05:10:11,230 --> 05:10:11,850
I'm on a timer!

7507
05:10:12,130 --> 05:10:12,810
Give me a second!

7508
05:10:54,750 --> 05:10:55,950
Oh, I just hit my knee.

7509
05:10:56,190 --> 05:10:56,390
Ah!

7510
05:10:56,670 --> 05:10:57,390
I don't know.

7511
05:10:59,610 --> 05:11:01,710
Okay, I'm back.

7512
05:11:02,370 --> 05:11:02,730
Okay.

7513
05:11:02,730 --> 05:11:04,810
So in 9 minutes, it should be heated up, maybe.

7514
05:11:05,310 --> 05:11:06,390
And then we can...

7515
05:11:06,390 --> 05:11:07,350
I'll go put my pizza in.

7516
05:11:07,510 --> 05:11:08,650
And then I'll set another timer.

7517
05:11:09,870 --> 05:11:10,230
Pizza!

7518
05:11:10,750 --> 05:11:11,110
BASAMIN!

7519
05:11:12,770 --> 05:11:13,130
OHAYO!

7520
05:11:15,250 --> 05:11:18,410
Back shots are when you throw your ball backwards towards the hoop.

7521
05:11:19,030 --> 05:11:20,250
No need to look it up now.

7522
05:11:20,310 --> 05:11:20,630
You're welcome.

7523
05:11:21,170 --> 05:11:24,150
Oh, so it's like a basketball... thing.

7524
05:11:25,190 --> 05:11:25,550
Makes...

7525
05:11:25,930 --> 05:11:26,550
Well, he's...

7526
05:11:26,550 --> 05:11:26,950
Oh, my God.

7527
05:11:27,430 --> 05:11:30,030
Master Miller is shooting the hoops on the job?

7528
05:11:32,970 --> 05:11:33,930
Master Miller...

7529
05:11:33,930 --> 05:11:35,430
Pay attention to me.

7530
05:11:38,150 --> 05:11:41,170
Okay, the way you guys are describing it is making me scared.

7531
05:11:41,270 --> 05:11:42,370
I'm just gonna believe whatever.

7532
05:11:42,930 --> 05:11:43,410
Whatever.

7533
05:11:43,810 --> 05:11:44,850
Let's listen to the...

7534
05:11:44,850 --> 05:11:46,050
Let's listen to the...

7535
05:11:46,050 --> 05:11:46,170
Let's listen to the...

7536
05:11:46,170 --> 05:11:46,870
Let's listen to Sasha instead.

7537
05:11:53,030 --> 05:11:57,530
What kind of pizza is this?

7538
05:11:57,530 --> 05:11:58,570
It's just cheese pizza.

7539
05:11:58,610 --> 05:11:59,090
Okay.

7540
05:11:59,530 --> 05:12:00,010
You're liking it?

7541
05:12:01,870 --> 05:12:02,390
Dart.

7542
05:12:05,990 --> 05:12:06,510
Dart.

7543
05:12:13,910 --> 05:12:14,930
Fission and fusion.

7544
05:12:30,010 --> 05:12:31,610
Are you going to do a full run in one setting?

7545
05:12:31,750 --> 05:12:32,270
No, no.

7546
05:12:32,330 --> 05:12:34,070
I think maybe after...

7547
05:12:35,150 --> 05:12:36,190
Psycho Mantis, maybe.

7548
05:12:39,510 --> 05:12:41,910
Since he's coming up relatively soon.

7549
05:12:42,430 --> 05:12:42,850
Right?

7550
05:12:43,470 --> 05:12:46,040
Yeah, we go to Psycho Mantis, then we go through to...

7551
05:12:47,150 --> 05:12:47,730
We'll see.

7552
05:12:48,950 --> 05:12:49,990
Oh, I went the wrong way.

7553
05:12:52,290 --> 05:12:53,810
Maybe after Psycho Mantis.

7554
05:12:57,090 --> 05:12:59,890
And then I'll probably do a...

7555
05:13:00,010 --> 05:13:01,530
the rest of it next week.

7556
05:13:03,290 --> 05:13:03,930
I

7557
05:13:11,250 --> 05:13:11,950
don't know.

7558
05:13:12,010 --> 05:13:12,290
We'll see.

7559
05:13:15,360 --> 05:13:16,160
Oh, nice.

7560
05:13:16,220 --> 05:13:17,080
Everything's still broken.

7561
05:13:18,480 --> 05:13:20,640
Otacon gave me...

7562
05:13:24,860 --> 05:13:26,760
his stuff, right?

7563
05:13:26,860 --> 05:13:27,720
His card?

7564
05:13:27,940 --> 05:13:29,120
What card key do I have now?

7565
05:13:30,520 --> 05:13:31,160
Four.

7566
05:13:33,000 --> 05:13:35,180
Metal Gear Exercise Data.

7567
05:13:36,060 --> 05:13:37,180
Number four.

7568
05:13:48,710 --> 05:13:49,930
Was there four over here?

7569
05:13:53,470 --> 05:13:54,350
Was there four over here?

7570
05:13:54,350 --> 05:13:54,870
Did I go in here before?

7571
05:13:55,290 --> 05:13:57,870
Oh, grenade full.

7572
05:14:02,170 --> 05:14:03,290
Nakida bullet full.

7573
05:14:04,330 --> 05:14:05,990
I think I went in this one before already.

7574
05:14:06,410 --> 05:14:06,850
I think I went in this one before already.

7575
05:14:06,850 --> 05:14:08,570
Night vision goggles!

7576
05:14:08,910 --> 05:14:09,330
What?

7577
05:14:09,410 --> 05:14:10,190
How did I miss that?

7578
05:14:10,870 --> 05:14:12,810
Wait, how did I actually miss that before?

7579
05:14:14,830 --> 05:14:15,750
That's kind of crazy.

7580
05:14:17,170 --> 05:14:17,910
Oh, uh oh.

7581
05:14:17,990 --> 05:14:19,170
How do I get out of here?

7582
05:14:20,150 --> 05:14:21,490
Run, Snake, run!

7583
05:14:23,110 --> 05:14:24,310
Go, go, go!

7584
05:14:27,490 --> 05:14:29,070
Oh, level four door.

7585
05:14:30,030 --> 05:14:30,510
Okay.

7586
05:14:30,570 --> 05:14:32,230
That makes way more sense.

7587
05:14:32,470 --> 05:14:35,290
I was gonna say, I thought there was a door that we could...

7588
05:14:36,570 --> 05:14:37,050
Okay.

7589
05:14:39,530 --> 05:14:40,610
B1, baby.

7590
05:14:45,420 --> 05:14:46,300
Where are cameras?

7591
05:14:46,300 --> 05:14:47,680
I shot them down.

7592
05:14:47,800 --> 05:14:48,860
I shot them down.

7593
05:14:53,690 --> 05:14:56,870
Okay, I'm gonna try and hold up the guy going to the bathroom.

7594
05:15:21,130 --> 05:15:21,710
Freeze.

7595
05:15:22,070 --> 05:15:22,490
No.

7596
05:15:26,950 --> 05:15:29,770
Now pee without using your hands.

7597
05:15:36,760 --> 05:15:37,340
Oh.

7598
05:15:40,690 --> 05:15:42,570
I don't need any more rations right now.

7599
05:15:56,480 --> 05:15:57,060
Ew!

7600
05:15:57,880 --> 05:15:59,040
Why is that in the stall?

7601
05:16:00,320 --> 05:16:01,820
That's nasty.

7602
05:16:02,220 --> 05:16:03,000
Okay, come in.

7603
05:16:06,560 --> 05:16:07,660
Get in there.

7604
05:16:09,220 --> 05:16:10,020
Yup.

7605
05:16:10,100 --> 05:16:10,880
Goodnight.

7606
05:16:11,340 --> 05:16:11,620
Oh

7607
05:16:21,440 --> 05:16:23,600
my god.

7608
05:16:24,340 --> 05:16:26,240
I didn't realize that.

7609
05:16:29,100 --> 05:16:29,900
Freeze.

7610
05:16:36,890 --> 05:16:39,670
You're also going in the stall.

7611
05:16:42,710 --> 05:16:43,510
Pizza time?

7612
05:16:43,690 --> 05:16:44,770
What do you mean pizza time?

7613
05:16:46,130 --> 05:16:47,690
My alarm hasn't gone off yet.

7614
05:16:51,770 --> 05:16:53,050
You guys, I set an alarm.

7615
05:16:54,090 --> 05:16:54,870
Get in there.

7616
05:17:01,090 --> 05:17:03,630
This is where Psycho Mantis is.

7617
05:17:03,850 --> 05:17:05,630
Oh, I was like, what are those two dots?

7618
05:17:06,230 --> 05:17:07,010
But it's...

7619
05:17:09,090 --> 05:17:10,030
They're little guys.

7620
05:17:12,630 --> 05:17:14,210
We can't go into the girl's room.

7621
05:17:14,910 --> 05:17:15,350
Unfortunately.

7622
05:17:15,450 --> 05:17:16,030
Oh, wait.

7623
05:17:19,700 --> 05:17:20,400
Is that her?

7624
05:17:26,520 --> 05:17:26,960
Easy.

7625
05:17:31,120 --> 05:17:33,300
Wow, the bathroom got like such an upgrade.

7626
05:17:33,580 --> 05:17:34,400
Oh my gosh.

7627
05:17:35,180 --> 05:17:36,100
It's so nice.

7628
05:17:37,100 --> 05:17:39,300
There's a little place to do your makeup.

7629
05:17:41,260 --> 05:17:41,900
It's so cool.

7630
05:17:41,920 --> 05:17:43,120
It's so fancy in here now.

7631
05:17:49,140 --> 05:17:51,220
They have the toilet paper on the floor.

7632
05:17:51,360 --> 05:17:52,000
That's disgusting.

7633
05:17:53,920 --> 05:17:54,400
Ew.

7634
05:17:57,960 --> 05:17:58,440
Freeze.

7635
05:18:00,260 --> 05:18:00,740
Freeze.

7636
05:18:02,360 --> 05:18:03,320
You trickster.

7637
05:18:03,480 --> 05:18:04,760
You trickster.

7638
05:18:05,960 --> 05:18:07,880
I let my guard down because you're beautiful.

7639
05:18:07,940 --> 05:18:11,180
That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the legendary Solid Snake.

7640
05:18:11,240 --> 05:18:11,840
What a peeper.

7641
05:18:11,840 --> 05:18:12,300
Ow!

7642
05:18:17,780 --> 05:18:18,700
You're Merrill.

7643
05:18:18,860 --> 05:18:19,800
You're hot.

7644
05:18:21,100 --> 05:18:22,300
No, wait, my alarm!

7645
05:18:23,020 --> 05:18:23,620
Oh, no.

7646
05:18:23,740 --> 05:18:24,560
No, no, hold on.

7647
05:18:24,700 --> 05:18:25,320
Oh, gosh.

7648
05:18:27,040 --> 05:18:28,360
What do you mean?

7649
05:18:28,900 --> 05:18:31,100
Hey, men aren't allowed in here.

7650
05:18:31,260 --> 05:18:31,720
Hold on.

7651
05:18:31,840 --> 05:18:33,180
I gotta get to the cutscene.

7652
05:18:33,860 --> 05:18:35,940
I had no idea you were so...

7653
05:18:36,480 --> 05:18:36,960
feminine.

7654
05:18:38,660 --> 05:18:41,440
This is no time to try and hit on me, Snake.

7655
05:18:41,440 --> 05:18:43,260
She has psychosis.

7656
05:18:43,660 --> 05:18:46,120
Besides, it's a waste of time.

7657
05:18:46,260 --> 05:18:46,700
Exactly.

7658
05:18:46,700 --> 05:18:50,300
When I joined up, they gave me psychotherapy to destroy my interest in men.

7659
05:18:50,520 --> 05:18:50,740
Psychotherapy.

7660
05:18:50,740 --> 05:18:50,800
Yeah.

7661
05:18:51,120 --> 05:18:52,000
Same smart mouth.

7662
05:18:52,300 --> 05:18:53,320
You're Merrill, all right.

7663
05:18:53,560 --> 05:18:54,440
Are you hurt?

7664
05:18:54,600 --> 05:18:55,280
Pizza time.

7665
05:18:55,320 --> 05:18:55,620
Not yet.

7666
05:18:56,180 --> 05:18:58,620
After all, I was disguised as a genome soldier.

7667
05:18:59,460 --> 05:19:00,640
So why'd you change?

7668
05:19:00,940 --> 05:19:03,040
You'd be a lot better off dressed like one of them.

7669
05:19:03,320 --> 05:19:05,500
I got tired of disguising myself.

7670
05:19:05,920 --> 05:19:06,500
Rip pizza?

7671
05:19:06,700 --> 05:19:08,720
No, it's just the oven.

7672
05:19:09,620 --> 05:19:11,400
I gotta go put the pizza inside.

7673
05:19:11,680 --> 05:19:13,220
Truth is, the uniform smelled like blood.

7674
05:19:13,580 --> 05:19:13,980
Ew.

7675
05:19:14,280 --> 05:19:15,100
What's that mark?

7676
05:19:15,460 --> 05:19:16,580
What is this music?

7677
05:19:16,840 --> 05:19:17,480
Oh, this?

7678
05:19:18,380 --> 05:19:19,500
It's a paint tattoo.

7679
05:19:19,740 --> 05:19:20,600
It's not real.

7680
05:19:21,160 --> 05:19:22,980
I'm a fan of Foxhound way back.

7681
05:19:23,200 --> 05:19:25,460
When guys like you and my uncle were in it.

7682
05:19:25,560 --> 05:19:27,560
This is a weird soundtrack.

7683
05:19:27,860 --> 05:19:30,020
None of that gene therapy like there is today.

7684
05:19:30,660 --> 05:19:32,640
You guys were real heroes.

7685
05:19:33,500 --> 05:19:35,440
There are no heroes in war.

7686
05:19:35,600 --> 05:19:36,460
It's funny you mention that.

7687
05:19:36,460 --> 05:19:39,420
All the heroes I know are either dead or in prison.

7688
05:19:39,760 --> 05:19:40,800
One or the other.

7689
05:19:42,660 --> 05:19:43,920
You're a hero, aren't you?

7690
05:19:44,040 --> 05:19:46,380
Her foundation does not match the rest of her body.

7691
05:19:49,200 --> 05:19:50,680
She looks like...

7692
05:19:50,680 --> 05:19:53,540
I'm just a guy who can only find meaning on the battlefield.

7693
05:19:53,960 --> 05:19:56,180
There's no winning or losing for a mercenary.

7694
05:19:56,660 --> 05:19:59,240
The only winners in war are the people.

7695
05:20:00,460 --> 05:20:01,200
That's right.

7696
05:20:01,400 --> 05:20:02,960
And you fight for the people.

7697
05:20:02,960 --> 05:20:04,940
She thinks she's way paler than she actually is.

7698
05:20:04,940 --> 05:20:05,940
I've never fought for anyone but myself.

7699
05:20:06,600 --> 05:20:08,160
I've got no purpose in life.

7700
05:20:08,720 --> 05:20:09,680
No ultimate goal.

7701
05:20:11,000 --> 05:20:12,620
I don't like the music yet.

7702
05:20:12,720 --> 05:20:12,740
Come on.

7703
05:20:14,240 --> 05:20:16,500
It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.

7704
05:20:16,800 --> 05:20:18,800
The only time I feel truly alive.

7705
05:20:19,420 --> 05:20:20,720
Feel truly alive.

7706
05:20:20,760 --> 05:20:23,100
Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh?

7707
05:20:23,300 --> 05:20:24,040
I mean...

7708
05:20:24,040 --> 05:20:25,520
You can't stop loving war.

7709
05:20:25,940 --> 05:20:28,480
Is it the same for all soldiers throughout history?

7710
05:20:28,760 --> 05:20:30,960
No interest in men yet marries the toilet man?

7711
05:20:31,540 --> 05:20:32,060
Hey.

7712
05:20:32,620 --> 05:20:33,720
He was very convincing.

7713
05:20:33,720 --> 05:20:34,800
Why didn't you contact me?

7714
05:20:35,440 --> 05:20:36,420
Yeah, actually.

7715
05:20:37,200 --> 05:20:38,860
My Kodak was broken.

7716
05:20:39,140 --> 05:20:39,960
Your shoes.

7717
05:20:40,060 --> 05:20:41,500
Not in the bathroom.

7718
05:20:41,700 --> 05:20:43,780
Shouldn't you just be happy we met up like this?

7719
05:20:43,920 --> 05:20:44,580
Girlie, please.

7720
05:20:47,020 --> 05:20:48,200
That's so nasty.

7721
05:20:50,040 --> 05:20:50,600
Anyway.

7722
05:20:51,220 --> 05:20:53,200
How did you recognize me in disguise?

7723
05:20:53,760 --> 05:20:54,600
You got a nice...

7724
05:20:54,600 --> 05:20:55,620
I'd never forget a lady.

7725
05:20:56,160 --> 05:20:58,400
So there's something you like about me, huh?

7726
05:20:59,080 --> 05:20:59,640
Yeah.

7727
05:20:59,860 --> 05:21:01,160
You've got a great butt.

7728
05:21:02,020 --> 05:21:02,580
Butt?

7729
05:21:04,800 --> 05:21:05,200
Oh, I see.

7730
05:21:05,400 --> 05:21:06,700
First it's my eyes.

7731
05:21:06,860 --> 05:21:07,900
Now it's my butt.

7732
05:21:08,100 --> 05:21:08,920
What's next?

7733
05:21:09,460 --> 05:21:12,900
On the battlefield, you never think about what's next.

7734
05:21:13,200 --> 05:21:13,400
The tangle.

7735
05:21:17,440 --> 05:21:18,280
Love it.

7736
05:21:18,320 --> 05:21:19,020
Love that.

7737
05:21:19,260 --> 05:21:20,560
Love that for you, Snake.

7738
05:21:22,720 --> 05:21:24,380
I miss this guy.

7739
05:21:24,940 --> 05:21:25,760
So, Snake.

7740
05:21:25,960 --> 05:21:27,660
How are the negotiations going?

7741
05:21:28,480 --> 05:21:29,420
No progress.

7742
05:21:30,080 --> 05:21:30,640
Negotiations?

7743
05:21:30,640 --> 05:21:31,820
So it's all up to you, huh?

7744
05:21:34,800 --> 05:21:36,560
Stop them from launching a nuclear missile.

7745
05:21:37,080 --> 05:21:38,340
There are two ways.

7746
05:21:38,620 --> 05:21:41,120
Either we destroy Metal Gear, or...

7747
05:21:41,120 --> 05:21:43,220
We override the detonation code.

7748
05:21:43,960 --> 05:21:45,940
You got the card keys from Baker?

7749
05:21:48,960 --> 05:21:50,040
Ah, yeah.

7750
05:21:50,460 --> 05:21:51,700
You mean this?

7751
05:21:51,940 --> 05:21:54,000
Where are the others?

7752
05:21:54,300 --> 05:21:55,760
There should be three keys.

7753
05:21:56,080 --> 05:21:57,520
This is all I've got.

7754
05:21:58,840 --> 05:22:00,300
Where could the other two be?

7755
05:22:01,040 --> 05:22:02,260
I have no idea.

7756
05:22:02,500 --> 05:22:04,060
But they must be somewhere.

7757
05:22:04,800 --> 05:22:08,040
If we can't find them, we'll have no choice but to destroy Metal Gear.

7758
05:22:08,040 --> 05:22:09,520
There's like two ladies on this whole base.

7759
05:22:09,560 --> 05:22:11,000
I heard that Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north of here.

7760
05:22:11,000 --> 05:22:12,520
Did you hear the ladies' washroom floor is pretty clean?

7761
05:22:12,940 --> 05:22:13,820
Take me too.

7762
05:22:14,100 --> 05:22:16,100
I know this place better than you do.

7763
05:22:16,460 --> 05:22:17,880
You'll just slow me down.

7764
05:22:18,060 --> 05:22:19,900
You don't have enough battle experience.

7765
05:22:20,620 --> 05:22:22,160
I won't slow you down.

7766
05:22:22,280 --> 05:22:23,000
I promise.

7767
05:22:23,120 --> 05:22:25,400
She says that and then she gets shot and slows us down.

7768
05:22:25,600 --> 05:22:25,800
And what if you do?

7769
05:22:27,120 --> 05:22:28,360
Then you can shoot me.

7770
05:22:30,380 --> 05:22:32,080
I don't like to waste bullets.

7771
05:22:33,460 --> 05:22:35,100
None of that gene therapy nonsense.

7772
05:22:35,180 --> 05:22:36,180
You guys are real heroes.

7773
05:22:36,200 --> 05:22:39,420
Woman who goes all in on nanos a few years later.

7774
05:22:39,740 --> 05:22:41,660
Okay, to be fair, it's like ten years later.

7775
05:22:44,660 --> 05:22:45,100
Spoilers!

7776
05:22:45,100 --> 05:22:45,360
Sorry.

7777
05:22:45,500 --> 05:22:45,920
Sorry.

7778
05:22:46,020 --> 05:22:46,460
Sorry.

7779
05:22:48,920 --> 05:22:49,800
No spoilers.

7780
05:22:50,160 --> 05:22:51,040
Got it.

7781
05:22:51,340 --> 05:22:52,300
I'll be careful.

7782
05:22:58,280 --> 05:23:01,740
You know, I don't use makeup the way other women do.

7783
05:23:01,740 --> 05:23:02,760
No, you don't.

7784
05:23:02,760 --> 05:23:03,900
Because it looks very bad.

7785
05:23:03,960 --> 05:23:05,560
I hardly ever look at myself in the mirror.

7786
05:23:05,700 --> 05:23:06,940
Maybe you should look more.

7787
05:23:06,940 --> 05:23:08,220
I always despise that kind of woman.

7788
05:23:08,760 --> 05:23:10,400
Oh no, she's not like other girls.

7789
05:23:10,400 --> 05:23:12,140
I've always dreamed of becoming a soldier.

7790
05:23:14,680 --> 05:23:15,560
Your foundation.

7791
05:23:15,560 --> 05:23:16,060
But I was wrong.

7792
05:23:16,820 --> 05:23:18,340
It wasn't really my dream.

7793
05:23:19,360 --> 05:23:20,160
My father.

7794
05:23:20,920 --> 05:23:22,920
He was killed in action when I was younger.

7795
05:23:24,320 --> 05:23:26,320
You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps?

7796
05:23:29,000 --> 05:23:29,700
Not really.

7797
05:23:30,620 --> 05:23:33,900
I thought that if I became a soldier, I could understand him better.

7798
05:23:35,020 --> 05:23:36,020
It looks good here.

7799
05:23:36,340 --> 05:23:37,600
And so, you became a soldier.

7800
05:23:37,740 --> 05:23:39,700
It looks like she tries to blend it in with her neck at least.

7801
05:23:40,020 --> 05:23:41,260
I thought I was.

7802
05:23:41,840 --> 05:23:42,720
Until today.

7803
05:23:43,840 --> 05:23:45,200
Now I understand.

7804
05:23:46,080 --> 05:23:48,900
The truth is, I was just afraid of looking at myself.

7805
05:23:49,880 --> 05:23:52,200
Afraid of having to make my own decisions in life.

7806
05:23:52,420 --> 05:23:53,960
I'm so sad about the music change.

7807
05:23:54,280 --> 05:23:56,080
But I'm not gonna lie to myself anymore.

7808
05:23:56,500 --> 05:23:57,220
I'll do it myself.

7809
05:23:57,520 --> 05:24:00,080
It's time I took a long, hard look at myself.

7810
05:24:00,220 --> 05:24:00,640
...

7811
05:24:02,100 --> 05:24:03,940
I want to know who I am.

7812
05:24:04,020 --> 05:24:05,300
What I'm capable of.

7813
05:24:05,680 --> 05:24:08,780
I want to know why I've lived the way I've lived until now.

7814
05:24:09,720 --> 05:24:11,560
I want to know...

7815
05:24:11,560 --> 05:24:13,080
I want to know...

7816
05:24:13,080 --> 05:24:13,760
Take a good look.

7817
05:24:13,960 --> 05:24:16,020
You won't be seeing mirrors for a while.

7818
05:24:16,240 --> 05:24:18,700
There won't be any chances to wash your face, either.

7819
05:24:19,100 --> 05:24:19,180
There won't be any chances to wash your face, either.

7820
05:24:19,180 --> 05:24:20,020
I know your foundation.

7821
05:24:20,980 --> 05:24:21,500
Yeah.

7822
05:24:22,420 --> 05:24:24,000
This isn't a training exercise.

7823
05:24:24,500 --> 05:24:26,340
Our lives are riding on this.

7824
05:24:26,440 --> 05:24:28,780
There are no heroes or heroines.

7825
05:24:28,780 --> 05:24:29,020
No.

7826
05:24:29,280 --> 05:24:31,580
You lose, you die a dog's death.

7827
05:24:31,720 --> 05:24:32,680
A dog's death.

7828
05:24:33,220 --> 05:24:33,780
Yeah.

7829
05:24:37,220 --> 05:24:38,620
Is that FAMAS functional?

7830
05:24:39,100 --> 05:24:41,080
I have one, too.

7831
05:24:41,840 --> 05:24:43,260
Unfortunately, it's out of ammo.

7832
05:24:44,040 --> 05:24:45,500
Where'd you get that Desert Eagle?

7833
05:24:47,440 --> 05:24:48,940
I found it in the armory.

7834
05:24:49,940 --> 05:24:52,120
It's a .50 caliber Action Express.

7835
05:24:53,300 --> 05:24:55,180
There was a SOCOM pistol, too.

7836
05:24:55,440 --> 05:24:56,680
But I chose this.

7837
05:24:57,280 --> 05:24:58,520
Look, give us the leftovers.

7838
05:24:59,040 --> 05:25:00,520
So I got a leftover, huh?

7839
05:25:01,700 --> 05:25:03,700
Isn't that gun a little big for a girl?

7840
05:25:03,940 --> 05:25:04,620
Hey, Snake.

7841
05:25:05,780 --> 05:25:07,220
Now you treat me like a woman?

7842
05:25:08,940 --> 05:25:09,560
Come on.

7843
05:25:09,840 --> 05:25:10,940
Use my .45.

7844
05:25:11,240 --> 05:25:11,680
I want the...

7845
05:25:11,680 --> 05:25:13,520
She's like, give me that bigger gun.

7846
05:25:13,760 --> 05:25:16,140
Listen, I've used a gun like this since I was eight years old.

7847
05:25:16,400 --> 05:25:18,620
I'm more comfortable with it than I am with a bra.

7848
05:25:19,000 --> 05:25:19,240
Woo!

7849
05:25:22,340 --> 05:25:23,040
Yes, Snake.

7850
05:25:23,040 --> 05:25:26,340
If we're gonna go north, we'll have to go through the commander's room on this floor.

7851
05:25:26,680 --> 05:25:26,960
Okay.

7852
05:25:27,200 --> 05:25:29,380
The overland route is blocked by glaciers.

7853
05:25:30,140 --> 05:25:32,640
The door to the commander's room is security level five.

7854
05:25:33,180 --> 05:25:34,180
But you got the key.

7855
05:25:35,120 --> 05:25:36,360
This card will open it.

7856
05:25:36,480 --> 05:25:37,260
Ah, yeah.

7857
05:25:37,420 --> 05:25:39,440
Why does this like lighting on Snake's face?

7858
05:25:39,620 --> 05:25:40,800
Looks like he's got like a lightning bolt.

7859
05:25:40,800 --> 05:25:42,720
It was inside the pocket of the uniform I was wearing.

7860
05:25:43,100 --> 05:25:43,500
Nice.

7861
05:25:43,660 --> 05:25:45,960
It looks like he must have been guarding someplace important.

7862
05:25:46,040 --> 05:25:47,040
Could've used that earlier.

7863
05:25:47,440 --> 05:25:48,280
Okay, let's go.

7864
05:25:48,720 --> 05:25:50,420
I know this place better than you.

7865
05:25:50,800 --> 05:25:51,740
I'll be point man.

7866
05:25:52,180 --> 05:25:52,860
Follow me.

7867
05:25:53,960 --> 05:25:54,400
Oh.

7868
05:25:54,900 --> 05:25:55,580
She's going.

7869
05:25:55,700 --> 05:25:56,380
She's running.

7870
05:25:57,840 --> 05:25:58,280
What?

7871
05:26:02,670 --> 05:26:04,070
Why is he in Australia?

7872
05:26:08,030 --> 05:26:09,710
What happened to the music?

7873
05:26:10,350 --> 05:26:11,330
I'll keep a lookout.

7874
05:26:11,530 --> 05:26:12,770
Make sure you're ready, okay?

7875
05:26:13,030 --> 05:26:14,310
What happened to the music?

7876
05:26:19,170 --> 05:26:19,610
Okay.

7877
05:26:19,690 --> 05:26:21,030
Give me one second.

7878
05:26:22,850 --> 05:26:24,610
I'm gonna go into Kodak real quick.

7879
05:26:24,770 --> 05:26:25,170
Um.

7880
05:26:25,330 --> 05:26:26,990
I'm gonna go put my pizza in the oven.

7881
05:26:28,010 --> 05:26:34,130
So then we'll run around and then we'll wait a little bit until my pizza's cooked.

7882
05:26:34,290 --> 05:26:35,550
Because it shouldn't take too long.

7883
05:26:35,610 --> 05:26:41,510
It should take like 10 minutes and I don't want to be in the middle of Mantis' fight when it goes off.

7884
05:26:41,710 --> 05:26:43,610
So give me... Sorry, I know I keep leaving.

7885
05:26:43,930 --> 05:26:47,730
But give me like 2 minutes to put it into the oven.

7886
05:26:47,950 --> 05:26:49,050
And yeah, I'll be right back.

7887
05:28:15,470 --> 05:28:16,190
Okie dokie.

7888
05:28:17,150 --> 05:28:19,130
Alright, let me set a timer for Oh.

7889
05:28:19,270 --> 05:28:19,830
Yeah.

7890
05:28:19,970 --> 05:28:25,170
Let me set a timer for 10 minutes.

7891
05:28:26,650 --> 05:28:27,950
Thank you for all the super times.

7892
05:28:28,150 --> 05:28:29,110
Thank you.

7893
05:28:29,250 --> 05:28:30,350
Thank you.

7894
05:28:31,430 --> 05:28:33,710
10 minutes would be 25.

7895
05:28:35,750 --> 05:28:36,350
Ok.

7896
05:28:36,490 --> 05:28:36,990
Save.

7897
05:28:37,390 --> 05:28:37,990
Ok.

7898
05:28:38,910 --> 05:28:40,890
Alright, let's grab some stuff.

7899
05:28:41,350 --> 05:28:44,470
Actually, let's We can call the Kodak first.

7900
05:28:45,450 --> 05:28:47,470
Colonel, your niece is fine.

7901
05:28:47,690 --> 05:28:48,690
Thank goodness.

7902
05:28:48,930 --> 05:28:49,310
Thank goodness.

7903
05:28:51,090 --> 05:28:51,650
No.

7904
05:28:52,750 --> 05:28:53,310
Snake.

7905
05:28:54,050 --> 05:28:55,430
She's quite a woman.

7906
05:28:55,770 --> 05:28:57,510
Don't say that about her.

7907
05:28:57,970 --> 05:29:01,710
I can't ask you to watch after Meryl, but duty first.

7908
05:29:02,370 --> 05:29:03,730
Maybe I was wrong.

7909
05:29:04,250 --> 05:29:06,390
Sending my own flesh and blood to war.

7910
05:29:06,530 --> 05:29:08,110
She understands about duty.

7911
05:29:08,390 --> 05:29:09,330
I know she does.

7912
05:29:09,390 --> 05:29:13,990
But what I want to know is What was the real purpose of this military exercise?

7913
05:29:14,610 --> 05:29:15,710
I don't know.

7914
05:29:15,990 --> 05:29:18,950
Like I said, I'm nothing more than a middleman.

7915
05:29:19,170 --> 05:29:21,830
Is this transmission being monitored by the military?

7916
05:29:22,230 --> 05:29:22,910
Of course.

7917
05:29:23,150 --> 05:29:23,830
I get it.

7918
05:29:23,910 --> 05:29:27,170
All the world's a stage and we're merely players, right?

7919
05:29:27,430 --> 05:29:27,950
Yes.

7920
05:29:28,390 --> 05:29:30,750
But even players can influence the play.

7921
05:29:31,070 --> 05:29:33,370
I just hope we can prevent it from having a bad ending.

7922
05:29:33,370 --> 05:29:33,910
Thanks for the beat.

7923
05:29:37,650 --> 05:29:39,210
What did I call Meryl?

7924
05:29:39,290 --> 05:29:39,970
Is she right there?

7925
05:29:40,150 --> 05:29:40,850
Oh, no response.

7926
05:29:41,030 --> 05:29:41,750
Come on, girlie.

7927
05:29:42,650 --> 05:29:43,390
Come on.

7928
05:29:43,390 --> 05:29:43,650
Time.

7929
05:29:45,550 --> 05:29:46,790
Uh, Master Miller?

7930
05:29:48,450 --> 05:29:50,450
You managed to link up with Meryl.

7931
05:29:50,470 --> 05:29:50,650
Yeah.

7932
05:29:50,770 --> 05:29:51,010
Good.

7933
05:29:51,270 --> 05:29:54,910
So now you must have the card keys that will override the detonation code.

7934
05:29:54,910 --> 05:29:56,350
Yes, we're gonna override that code.

7935
05:29:56,430 --> 05:29:56,450
You should hurry.

7936
05:29:56,690 --> 05:29:58,610
The time limit is running out.

7937
05:29:58,670 --> 05:29:59,050
Oh my gosh.

7938
05:29:59,130 --> 05:30:01,450
We only probably have like two hours.

7939
05:30:02,930 --> 05:30:03,890
Let's see Nastasha.

7940
05:30:05,250 --> 05:30:06,950
You found Meryl.

7941
05:30:07,030 --> 05:30:09,010
The Colonel will be so relieved.

7942
05:30:09,450 --> 05:30:10,430
Oh, okay.

7943
05:30:13,430 --> 05:30:15,150
It's a good thing you hooked up with Meryl.

7944
05:30:15,190 --> 05:30:16,290
You should have seen the Colonel.

7945
05:30:16,430 --> 05:30:18,550
He doesn't like to let it show because he's the boss.

7946
05:30:18,790 --> 05:30:20,310
But he was so happy.

7947
05:30:20,410 --> 05:30:21,410
He could barely contain himself.

7948
05:30:21,410 --> 05:30:21,910
Oh, that's right.

7949
05:30:21,950 --> 05:30:22,790
Her codec is broken.

7950
05:30:22,970 --> 05:30:23,150
I'm glad to hear that.

7951
05:30:23,430 --> 05:30:23,970
You're right.

7952
05:30:26,210 --> 05:30:28,450
Why did I keep saying hook up with her?

7953
05:30:29,310 --> 05:30:30,650
I don't really like the...

7954
05:30:30,650 --> 05:30:32,530
I don't really like that wording.

7955
05:30:40,110 --> 05:30:41,450
Talk to you later, Snake.

7956
05:30:41,930 --> 05:30:42,330
Bye.

7957
05:30:45,910 --> 05:30:47,370
Wait, does she turn red in this too?

7958
05:30:55,340 --> 05:30:56,460
I'm looking at you.

7959
05:30:56,600 --> 05:30:57,060
What?

7960
05:30:57,360 --> 05:30:58,260
What is it?

7961
05:31:02,560 --> 05:31:04,020
I almost punched her.

7962
05:31:04,180 --> 05:31:05,720
Why are you staring at my...

7963
05:31:06,420 --> 05:31:07,540
I'm not staring at...

7964
05:31:07,540 --> 05:31:08,500
your face.

7965
05:31:08,780 --> 05:31:10,180
Why are you staring at my face?

7966
05:31:10,800 --> 05:31:12,100
Come on, Snake.

7967
05:31:18,100 --> 05:31:19,660
Don't stare at me like that.

7968
05:31:20,140 --> 05:31:21,800
She doesn't look to be getting redder.

7969
05:31:22,180 --> 05:31:22,800
Does she?

7970
05:31:23,780 --> 05:31:25,460
Why are you staring at my face?

7971
05:31:25,780 --> 05:31:26,820
What are you doing?

7972
05:31:27,340 --> 05:31:28,780
We've got to get a move on.

7973
05:31:29,200 --> 05:31:30,200
She's so shy.

7974
05:31:32,020 --> 05:31:32,800
Your face.

7975
05:31:34,400 --> 05:31:34,840
What?

7976
05:31:35,140 --> 05:31:35,980
What is it?

7977
05:31:36,540 --> 05:31:38,360
She doesn't seem to be getting redder, does she?

7978
05:31:38,500 --> 05:31:39,180
Takes a while?

7979
05:31:41,480 --> 05:31:43,260
Why are you staring at my...

7980
05:31:43,260 --> 05:31:43,620
face?

7981
05:31:44,420 --> 05:31:45,340
It's the foundation.

7982
05:31:46,760 --> 05:31:47,980
It's covering her blush.

7983
05:31:48,060 --> 05:31:48,540
So true.

7984
05:31:48,760 --> 05:31:49,800
Come on, Snake.

7985
05:31:49,800 --> 05:31:51,860
It doesn't take that long in the original.

7986
05:31:55,720 --> 05:31:57,380
Don't stare at me like that.

7987
05:31:58,300 --> 05:31:59,860
What's wrong with your face?

7988
05:32:01,060 --> 05:32:03,080
Why are you staring at my face?

7989
05:32:03,560 --> 05:32:04,500
What are you doing?

7990
05:32:04,900 --> 05:32:06,500
We've got to get a move on.

7991
05:32:06,720 --> 05:32:08,080
She's so like...

7992
05:32:08,080 --> 05:32:08,900
If she could like...

7993
05:32:08,900 --> 05:32:11,160
index finger...

7994
05:32:11,160 --> 05:32:12,240
What?

7995
05:32:12,700 --> 05:32:13,680
What is it?

7996
05:32:13,860 --> 05:32:15,280
She's so like...

7997
05:32:15,280 --> 05:32:15,900
Oh my god.

7998
05:32:15,940 --> 05:32:18,000
Right now she's giving Bella from Twilight.

7999
05:32:19,100 --> 05:32:20,880
Why are you staring at my...

8000
05:32:22,140 --> 05:32:22,980
She's giving...

8001
05:32:22,980 --> 05:32:24,340
She's so Bella from Twilight.

8002
05:32:24,720 --> 05:32:26,500
Why are you...

8003
05:32:26,500 --> 05:32:27,400
Come on, Snake.

8004
05:32:27,800 --> 05:32:29,380
I don't think she's going to turn red.

8005
05:32:29,640 --> 05:32:31,240
That's a little sad, but...

8006
05:32:31,240 --> 05:32:32,940
Are these guys still in here?

8007
05:32:33,500 --> 05:32:34,520
Even they are gone?

8008
05:32:36,060 --> 05:32:36,500
Okay.

8009
05:32:37,320 --> 05:32:37,760
Okay.

8010
05:32:42,220 --> 05:32:42,840
Everyone's gone.

8011
05:32:42,900 --> 05:32:44,560
So I'm taking advantage of the situation, baby.

8012
05:32:46,220 --> 05:32:46,660
Yeah.

8013
05:32:46,840 --> 05:32:48,060
Let's take that.

8014
05:32:48,820 --> 05:32:50,400
Bombas bullets are full.

8015
05:32:52,100 --> 05:32:52,900
What's this?

8016
05:32:54,740 --> 05:32:55,460
Wait.

8017
05:32:56,360 --> 05:32:57,740
That's the Pazaza meme.

8018
05:32:58,080 --> 05:32:58,760
Sorry.

8019
05:32:59,060 --> 05:32:59,880
Don't hit me.

8020
05:33:01,780 --> 05:33:03,460
Get out of my way, Meryl.

8021
05:33:03,740 --> 05:33:04,460
Wait.

8022
05:33:05,320 --> 05:33:07,880
Why is the name of the Pazaza meme different?

8023
05:33:10,660 --> 05:33:11,120
What's this?

8024
05:33:12,000 --> 05:33:13,380
Call Soup.

8025
05:33:15,340 --> 05:33:16,060
Sorry.

8026
05:33:17,620 --> 05:33:18,560
I'm hiding now.

8027
05:33:19,420 --> 05:33:20,460
What does this say?

8028
05:33:20,880 --> 05:33:21,400
Notice.

8029
05:33:23,840 --> 05:33:24,360
Oh.

8030
05:33:24,440 --> 05:33:25,180
Not yet.

8031
05:33:26,480 --> 05:33:27,300
Over here.

8032
05:33:29,060 --> 05:33:29,820
Stung grenade.

8033
05:33:30,460 --> 05:33:31,620
No more Nikita.

8034
05:33:31,800 --> 05:33:33,100
Why are there so many?

8035
05:33:34,960 --> 05:33:36,560
They're all just chilling there.

8036
05:33:41,990 --> 05:33:42,770
Everything is...

8037
05:33:42,770 --> 05:33:44,250
I think I'm good, honestly.

8038
05:33:44,310 --> 05:33:44,670
On everything.

8039
05:33:45,010 --> 05:33:46,730
I don't think I can get anything else.

8040
05:33:47,490 --> 05:33:49,590
Unless there's like a... Yeah.

8041
05:33:57,660 --> 05:33:58,640
I'm good on everything.

8042
05:33:59,740 --> 05:34:01,140
It's a well-stocked office.

8043
05:34:01,300 --> 05:34:01,800
Yes, it is.

8044
05:34:02,760 --> 05:34:03,200
Nice.

8045
05:34:03,800 --> 05:34:05,980
I don't think there's anything under these ones.

8046
05:34:06,660 --> 05:34:07,820
I don't think I can remember.

8047
05:34:08,380 --> 05:34:08,820
Sorry.

8048
05:34:10,200 --> 05:34:11,860
This is what I mean, Meryl.

8049
05:34:11,860 --> 05:34:12,920
Get out of my way, Meryl.

8050
05:34:14,400 --> 05:34:14,840
Okay.

8051
05:34:16,720 --> 05:34:17,300
Hold on.

8052
05:34:17,360 --> 05:34:17,580
Let me...

8053
05:34:17,580 --> 05:34:18,420
How much time?

8054
05:34:18,700 --> 05:34:18,940
Okay.

8055
05:34:18,980 --> 05:34:21,800
I have five minutes before my pizza is done.

8056
05:34:22,240 --> 05:34:26,820
Like I said, I don't want to get into Psycho Mantis and like have to stop mid-fight.

8057
05:34:34,040 --> 05:34:36,460
Let's just listen to this ASMR of their footsteps.

8058
05:34:40,780 --> 05:34:41,680
Oh my god.

8059
05:34:43,620 --> 05:34:44,600
The sound...

8060
05:34:44,600 --> 05:34:45,960
This is so like...

8061
05:34:45,960 --> 05:34:48,880
Snake, let's hurry up and go to the commander's room.

8062
05:34:49,080 --> 05:34:49,560
I'm sorry!

8063
05:34:51,160 --> 05:34:53,000
She is not having it.

8064
05:34:53,040 --> 05:34:54,220
She is leaving without me.

8065
05:35:01,100 --> 05:35:02,140
What kind of pizza?

8066
05:35:02,240 --> 05:35:03,780
It's just cheese pizza.

8067
05:35:04,240 --> 05:35:05,880
It's just a cheese pizza.

8068
05:35:09,400 --> 05:35:11,240
Can I go back into the girl's bathroom?

8069
05:35:14,830 --> 05:35:17,950
I'm not going to see mirrors for very long anymore.

8070
05:35:41,770 --> 05:35:43,330
I'm a handsome fellow, aren't I?

8071
05:35:48,700 --> 05:35:49,660
Working mirrors.

8072
05:35:49,820 --> 05:35:50,140
Yeah.

8073
05:35:50,700 --> 05:35:51,220
Technology.

8074
05:35:54,420 --> 05:35:54,800
Okay.

8075
05:35:54,800 --> 05:35:55,680
Wash your hands.

8076
05:35:59,660 --> 05:36:01,040
Maybe there's stuff in here too.

8077
05:36:01,080 --> 05:36:01,520
We haven't checked.

8078
05:36:01,720 --> 05:36:01,800
Oh.

8079
05:36:03,960 --> 05:36:04,340
Nice.

8080
05:36:06,420 --> 05:36:06,800
Okay.

8081
05:36:06,940 --> 05:36:09,160
Is this the one with the toilet on the ground?

8082
05:36:09,800 --> 05:36:10,180
Oh!

8083
05:36:12,440 --> 05:36:12,820
Oh.

8084
05:36:15,900 --> 05:36:17,000
Excuse me, Meryl.

8085
05:36:17,640 --> 05:36:19,620
I have to go to the little girl's room.

8086
05:36:22,740 --> 05:36:23,420
And let's...

8087
05:36:24,140 --> 05:36:24,480
Also...

8088
05:36:28,430 --> 05:36:28,770
Sniffle.

8089
05:36:30,470 --> 05:36:31,730
Sniffle, sniffle, sniffle, sniffle.

8090
05:36:31,870 --> 05:36:31,950
Sniffle, sniffle, sniffle, sniffle.

8091
05:36:32,970 --> 05:36:33,310
Okay.

8092
05:36:33,410 --> 05:36:35,910
We're just wasting time right now.

8093
05:36:36,030 --> 05:36:36,210
Okay.

8094
05:36:46,650 --> 05:36:46,990
We're just wasting time right now.

8095
05:36:46,990 --> 05:36:47,370
No way!

8096
05:36:47,450 --> 05:36:47,890
It works!

8097
05:36:49,190 --> 05:36:49,530
Okay.

8098
05:36:51,570 --> 05:36:51,850
Hold on.

8099
05:36:51,870 --> 05:36:52,110
Hold on.

8100
05:36:52,190 --> 05:36:52,950
We have to wash our hands.

8101
05:36:54,130 --> 05:36:57,610
We have to wash our hands.

8102
05:36:57,610 --> 05:37:00,510
Sniffle, sniffle, sniffle, sniffle.

8103
05:37:00,730 --> 05:37:02,390
Get under the fingernails.

8104
05:37:02,550 --> 05:37:03,570
Sniffle, sniffle, sniffle, sniffle.

8105
05:37:10,120 --> 05:37:10,980
All dry.

8106
05:37:13,320 --> 05:37:18,360
Did you hear about the marines in real life who fooled an AI security camera during training by sneaking around in a cardboard box?

8107
05:37:18,440 --> 05:37:19,500
I have heard about that!

8108
05:37:19,920 --> 05:37:20,700
I have.

8109
05:37:20,760 --> 05:37:21,060
I have.

8110
05:37:22,980 --> 05:37:23,460
Okay.

8111
05:37:25,440 --> 05:37:25,920
God.

8112
05:37:26,120 --> 05:37:28,180
This sound is just so...

8113
05:37:29,020 --> 05:37:30,420
It's like the Barbie movie.

8114
05:37:33,240 --> 05:37:34,720
Oh, it's so satisfying.

8115
05:37:37,600 --> 05:37:41,200
Look at her, like, slapping her thigh with her gun.

8116
05:37:41,480 --> 05:37:42,560
She looks so cool.

8117
05:37:53,410 --> 05:37:53,830
Freeze.

8118
05:37:53,990 --> 05:37:57,450
I probably shouldn't joke with that because I will make a mistake.

8119
05:37:58,470 --> 05:38:00,230
I will accidentally shoot her.

8120
05:38:00,930 --> 05:38:01,770
Or purposefully.

8121
05:38:03,850 --> 05:38:04,270
Okay.

8122
05:38:04,330 --> 05:38:05,310
Just one more minute, you guys.

8123
05:38:05,470 --> 05:38:06,530
Actually, I'm just gonna go.

8124
05:38:06,890 --> 05:38:09,070
I'm just gonna go get my pizza out of the fridge.

8125
05:38:09,090 --> 05:38:09,290
Out of the oven.

8126
05:38:10,730 --> 05:38:11,170
Okay.

8127
05:38:11,250 --> 05:38:13,230
I'll BRB one more time.

8128
05:38:13,350 --> 05:38:13,950
I'm so sorry.

8129
05:38:14,210 --> 05:38:14,650
BRB.

8130
05:38:14,690 --> 05:38:14,890
BRB.

8131
05:38:15,150 --> 05:38:15,250
BRB.

8132
05:38:15,250 --> 05:38:15,570
BRB.

8133
05:39:54,030 --> 05:39:56,270
Pizza is served.

8134
05:39:57,690 --> 05:39:59,250
Pizza is served.

8135
05:40:00,970 --> 05:40:03,390
They're really hot though, so I gotta let them cool before...

8136
05:40:03,390 --> 05:40:05,650
I think I really need to eat before I fight him.

8137
05:40:07,010 --> 05:40:09,490
So maybe we'll take a little bit of a break.

8138
05:40:10,190 --> 05:40:11,290
Little bit of a break.

8139
05:40:11,510 --> 05:40:12,950
Well, they need to cool down.

8140
05:40:14,490 --> 05:40:15,590
Actually, you know what?

8141
05:40:16,490 --> 05:40:18,350
I'll eat once they're cool.

8142
05:40:18,730 --> 05:40:20,490
And in the middle of the battle, maybe.

8143
05:40:21,010 --> 05:40:22,410
I just realized something.

8144
05:40:22,630 --> 05:40:23,810
Also, I'm gone.

8145
05:40:23,930 --> 05:40:24,590
I'm missing...

8146
05:40:26,510 --> 05:40:27,190
No, no!

8147
05:40:30,710 --> 05:40:32,310
I put my thing on backwards.

8148
05:40:32,690 --> 05:40:33,010
Hold on.

8149
05:40:33,030 --> 05:40:34,430
I have to fix my headband.

8150
05:40:36,550 --> 05:40:37,150
Good enough.

8151
05:40:37,350 --> 05:40:37,650
Okay.

8152
05:40:39,110 --> 05:40:40,390
I realized something.

8153
05:40:41,730 --> 05:40:49,890
For Psycho Mantis, you know how you have to change the controller port and all that fun stuff?

8154
05:40:51,870 --> 05:40:52,350
What?

8155
05:40:52,790 --> 05:40:54,550
What do I do on the GameCube?

8156
05:40:59,230 --> 05:41:00,530
Colonel will tell me.

8157
05:41:00,730 --> 05:41:01,930
Colonel will tell me, right?

8158
05:41:02,630 --> 05:41:03,370
Oh, sorry.

8159
05:41:05,430 --> 05:41:06,470
Colonel will tell me.

8160
05:41:09,390 --> 05:41:09,870
Yes.

8161
05:41:10,210 --> 05:41:10,690
Oh my gosh.

8162
05:41:12,670 --> 05:41:13,890
What's wrong, Snake?

8163
05:41:14,470 --> 05:41:15,790
Don't you like girls?

8164
05:41:18,570 --> 05:41:19,050
Ouch!

8165
05:41:19,070 --> 05:41:19,230
Ouch!

8166
05:41:19,270 --> 05:41:19,490
Ouch!

8167
05:41:19,490 --> 05:41:20,010
It's okay.

8168
05:41:20,150 --> 05:41:20,510
It's hot.

8169
05:41:20,570 --> 05:41:20,850
It's hot.

8170
05:41:22,390 --> 05:41:23,270
She's so cute.

8171
05:41:25,770 --> 05:41:27,090
Oh, no thinking!

8172
05:41:27,630 --> 05:41:28,490
My head!

8173
05:41:28,630 --> 05:41:29,990
It hurts to think!

8174
05:41:31,790 --> 05:41:33,270
I'm just a woman!

8175
05:41:37,930 --> 05:41:39,110
Don't come here, Snake!

8176
05:41:43,930 --> 05:41:45,790
I'm getting motion sick for real.

8177
05:41:47,630 --> 05:41:48,210
Too many thighs!

8178
05:41:49,350 --> 05:41:51,470
I don't think she's okay, Snake.

8179
05:41:51,670 --> 05:41:52,430
I don't think she's okay.

8180
05:42:01,770 --> 05:42:02,970
What happened?

8181
05:42:03,910 --> 05:42:05,550
I'm fine.

8182
05:42:07,730 --> 05:42:08,810
Hi, Hana!

8183
05:42:14,200 --> 05:42:15,880
What is that?

8184
05:42:23,420 --> 05:42:24,180
Okay.

8185
05:42:27,780 --> 05:42:28,720
Let's go.

8186
05:42:31,340 --> 05:42:33,280
Come on, Mr. Foxhound.

8187
05:42:33,440 --> 05:42:34,920
The commander is waiting.

8188
05:42:35,260 --> 05:42:36,940
Wait, where's our extra, like...

8189
05:42:40,080 --> 05:42:43,400
That's the extra, like, zoomies and stuff?

8190
05:42:43,500 --> 05:42:44,540
That's what you take away?

8191
05:42:44,880 --> 05:42:47,480
But you'll add in everything else to this version?

8192
05:42:48,820 --> 05:42:50,180
I like that line, though.

8193
05:42:50,200 --> 05:42:51,200
The commander is waiting.

8194
05:42:55,570 --> 05:42:56,090
Also...

8195
05:42:56,090 --> 05:42:56,370
Oh!

8196
05:42:56,650 --> 05:42:57,550
There it is!

8197
05:42:57,650 --> 05:42:58,190
I was gonna say...

8198
05:42:58,190 --> 05:43:00,550
When you look at her, it's...

8199
05:43:00,570 --> 05:43:01,970
You looking at her, but...

8200
05:43:03,110 --> 05:43:04,150
It switches!

8201
05:43:04,650 --> 05:43:05,890
Oh my gosh, that's kinda cool.

8202
05:43:08,530 --> 05:43:10,110
But you can't move it.

8203
05:43:10,230 --> 05:43:11,430
You can't move around or anything.

8204
05:43:11,970 --> 05:43:12,290
Oh!

8205
05:43:18,860 --> 05:43:20,040
That is pretty cool.

8206
05:43:22,740 --> 05:43:26,060
And also, she's red on the thing now.

8207
05:43:26,920 --> 05:43:28,240
The commander is waiting.

8208
05:43:40,710 --> 05:43:42,350
Can you tranq her?

8209
05:43:46,330 --> 05:43:47,910
I wonder in this part, actually.

8210
05:43:51,830 --> 05:43:53,190
If we can tranq her instead.

8211
05:43:55,990 --> 05:43:56,430
Whoa!

8212
05:43:56,510 --> 05:43:56,890
Whoa!

8213
05:43:57,030 --> 05:43:57,470
Whoa!

8214
05:43:57,630 --> 05:43:58,070
Whoa!

8215
05:43:58,770 --> 05:43:59,210
Whoa!

8216
05:43:59,310 --> 05:43:59,750
Whoa!

8217
05:44:00,170 --> 05:44:00,610
Whoa!

8218
05:44:00,610 --> 05:44:00,670
Whoa!

8219
05:44:00,670 --> 05:44:00,830
Whoa!

8220
05:44:12,810 --> 05:44:14,030
She's getting handsy with us.

8221
05:44:14,170 --> 05:44:16,210
No, don't go any lower.

8222
05:44:16,410 --> 05:44:17,490
Do you like me?

8223
05:44:17,490 --> 05:44:17,990
That's for Hal.

8224
05:44:24,310 --> 05:44:24,990
Whoa.

8225
05:44:25,190 --> 05:44:27,010
Hold me, Snake.

8226
05:44:28,010 --> 05:44:28,550
What's wrong?

8227
05:44:28,970 --> 05:44:30,370
Your psychotherapy.

8228
05:44:30,770 --> 05:44:31,090
Hurry.

8229
05:44:32,230 --> 05:44:32,910
Please.

8230
05:44:33,550 --> 05:44:34,930
Make left me.

8231
05:44:44,600 --> 05:44:45,280
Snake...

8232
05:44:45,900 --> 05:44:47,040
I want you.

8233
05:44:48,260 --> 05:44:48,880
Who's that?

8234
05:44:49,260 --> 05:44:51,840
The fact that Psycho Mantis is saying all this...

8235
05:44:51,840 --> 05:44:53,320
That's one freaky guy.

8236
05:45:11,870 --> 05:45:12,350
Meryl's?

8237
05:45:16,690 --> 05:45:17,650
Hold on.

8238
05:45:17,730 --> 05:45:18,830
Do I need to do something now?

8239
05:45:19,670 --> 05:45:20,630
I'm eating pizza.

8240
05:45:22,750 --> 05:45:23,870
That wasn't me.

8241
05:45:24,470 --> 05:45:25,330
Meryl's not herself.

8242
05:45:25,730 --> 05:45:26,850
Don't use your weapon.

8243
05:45:26,990 --> 05:45:28,310
I was only starting the codec.

8244
05:45:28,570 --> 05:45:29,910
He's controlling Meryl.

8245
05:45:30,070 --> 05:45:31,950
That tune is his mind control music.

8246
05:45:32,870 --> 05:45:34,030
Don't use your weapon.

8247
05:45:34,330 --> 05:45:35,490
Try to knock her out.

8248
05:45:35,650 --> 05:45:35,810
Okay.

8249
05:45:37,590 --> 05:45:38,890
Oh, he shot me?

8250
05:45:39,170 --> 05:45:40,190
That's so messed up.

8251
05:45:40,230 --> 05:45:41,390
I was answering the codec.

8252
05:45:44,110 --> 05:45:44,550
Oh!

8253
05:45:44,930 --> 05:45:45,370
Whoa!

8254
05:45:46,730 --> 05:45:47,170
Wait.

8255
05:45:49,050 --> 05:45:50,710
I forgot how to shoot all of a sudden.

8256
05:45:52,350 --> 05:45:53,310
There we go.

8257
05:45:53,870 --> 05:45:54,530
She's out?

8258
05:46:08,180 --> 05:46:09,340
Useless woman!

8259
05:46:13,470 --> 05:46:15,110
Optic camouflage, huh?

8260
05:46:15,370 --> 05:46:16,390
Who are these guys?

8261
05:46:16,510 --> 05:46:17,470
I hope that's not your only trick.

8262
05:46:18,550 --> 05:46:19,270
Ah!

8263
05:46:19,770 --> 05:46:19,890
Him!

8264
05:46:19,890 --> 05:46:21,790
You doubt my power.

8265
05:46:23,730 --> 05:46:24,650
Psycho Mantis.

8266
05:46:24,910 --> 05:46:31,730
Now I will show you why I am the most powerful practitioner of psychokinesis and telepathy in the world.

8267
05:46:32,830 --> 05:46:35,990
No, there's no need for words, Snake.

8268
05:46:37,410 --> 05:46:38,710
I am...

8269
05:46:39,630 --> 05:46:41,070
Psycho Mantis.

8270
05:46:41,490 --> 05:46:42,210
Nyam!

8271
05:46:42,210 --> 05:46:43,090
That's right.

8272
05:46:43,410 --> 05:46:45,210
Doug Stone is so awesome.

8273
05:46:45,630 --> 05:46:45,650
This is no trick.

8274
05:46:45,650 --> 05:46:47,390
It's true power.

8275
05:46:49,430 --> 05:46:50,870
Who's the white guy?

8276
05:46:51,130 --> 05:46:51,150
That's useless.

8277
05:46:51,470 --> 05:46:52,810
I told you.

8278
05:46:52,850 --> 05:46:55,610
I can read your every thought.

8279
05:46:55,730 --> 05:46:56,450
Kojima!

8280
05:46:56,670 --> 05:46:57,810
In the middle.

8281
05:47:00,130 --> 05:47:01,570
Psycho Mantis.

8282
05:47:01,730 --> 05:47:01,910
Oh.

8283
05:47:02,550 --> 05:47:05,430
You're a careless man, aren't you?

8284
05:47:05,710 --> 05:47:06,630
Hey, what are you trying to say, huh?

8285
05:47:07,390 --> 05:47:10,430
However, you are a skilled warrior.

8286
05:47:10,810 --> 05:47:11,370
Yeah.

8287
05:47:11,410 --> 05:47:12,870
You like brute force.

8288
05:47:14,090 --> 05:47:14,650
Sure.

8289
05:47:15,030 --> 05:47:18,650
You are extremely cautious around traps.

8290
05:47:19,150 --> 05:47:19,790
Yeah, I am.

8291
05:47:19,890 --> 05:47:20,670
Yeah, I am.

8292
05:47:21,270 --> 05:47:22,830
Still don't believe me?

8293
05:47:23,130 --> 05:47:26,630
Now I'll read more deeply into your soul.

8294
05:47:26,950 --> 05:47:28,990
She's just sleeping on the ground in front of us.

8295
05:47:28,990 --> 05:47:31,490
I see that you enjoy Nintendo games.

8296
05:47:33,050 --> 05:47:36,730
You like Silicon Knights games, don't you?

8297
05:47:39,410 --> 05:47:41,890
So you like adventure games?

8298
05:47:43,810 --> 05:47:47,290
Did you enjoy playing Eternal Darkness?

8299
05:47:49,130 --> 05:47:50,350
I'll be honest...

8300
05:47:50,350 --> 05:47:52,750
You seem to like The Legend of Zelda, don't you?

8301
05:47:53,010 --> 05:47:55,310
I had a friend help me set up the memory card.

8302
05:47:55,590 --> 05:47:56,270
You like action games?

8303
05:47:58,430 --> 05:48:01,270
You've been playing Super Mario Sunshine.

8304
05:48:02,530 --> 05:48:04,170
Just for this part.

8305
05:48:08,470 --> 05:48:10,230
No, I have not.

8306
05:48:14,170 --> 05:48:18,030
I'm a prudent person.

8307
05:48:31,730 --> 05:48:32,650
Don't believe me?

8308
05:48:33,490 --> 05:48:36,670
I will show you my psychokinetic power.

8309
05:48:39,090 --> 05:48:41,850
Put your controller on the floor.

8310
05:48:42,410 --> 05:48:44,390
Okay, I'm actually gonna put it close to the mic.

8311
05:48:44,750 --> 05:48:47,350
Put it down as flat as you can.

8312
05:48:48,090 --> 05:48:49,370
I'm not touching it though.

8313
05:48:49,470 --> 05:48:50,330
I mean, I'm holding it up.

8314
05:48:50,450 --> 05:48:51,390
Oh, he's looking at me?

8315
05:48:51,470 --> 05:48:52,070
Okay, I'm sorry.

8316
05:48:52,250 --> 05:48:52,730
That's good.

8317
05:48:54,750 --> 05:48:55,230
Okay.

8318
05:48:55,230 --> 05:48:56,490
It's flat on my hands.

8319
05:48:56,570 --> 05:49:01,710
Now, I will move your controller by the power of my will alone.

8320
05:49:01,730 --> 05:49:03,810
Not the fourth wall break.

8321
05:49:04,410 --> 05:49:05,330
Okay, here we go.

8322
05:49:09,310 --> 05:49:10,650
It's barely moving.

8323
05:49:11,450 --> 05:49:12,050
Oh my god.

8324
05:49:12,110 --> 05:49:13,350
It's barely shaking.

8325
05:49:14,370 --> 05:49:15,910
I don't even think you can hear it.

8326
05:49:16,990 --> 05:49:18,570
Thanks to your friend for saying that.

8327
05:49:33,110 --> 05:49:35,170
What do you think now?

8328
05:49:35,670 --> 05:49:37,790
Can you feel my power?

8329
05:49:40,950 --> 05:49:43,250
The demonstration is over.

8330
05:49:43,270 --> 05:49:43,330
The demonstration is over.

8331
05:49:50,100 --> 05:49:50,860
Stop

8332
05:50:00,970 --> 05:50:02,090
drop and roll!

8333
05:50:03,610 --> 05:50:05,110
What is going on?

8334
05:50:05,910 --> 05:50:06,290
What?

8335
05:50:10,920 --> 05:50:11,680
Huh?

8336
05:50:13,360 --> 05:50:14,120
Huh?

8337
05:50:15,460 --> 05:50:16,580
I don't remember.

8338
05:50:16,960 --> 05:50:20,080
The pictures.

8339
05:50:23,200 --> 05:50:24,820
Wait, they're back to normal.

8340
05:50:31,420 --> 05:50:31,860
Um...

8341
05:50:33,200 --> 05:50:34,280
That was weird.

8342
05:50:42,400 --> 05:50:42,840
Oh!

8343
05:50:49,160 --> 05:50:49,600
Um...

8344
05:50:50,220 --> 05:50:51,120
Colonel, what do I do?

8345
05:50:53,460 --> 05:50:53,900
No!

8346
05:50:54,000 --> 05:50:54,580
Not you, Naomi!

8347
05:50:56,180 --> 05:50:56,620
Help!

8348
05:50:59,240 --> 05:51:03,320
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job.

8349
05:51:03,800 --> 05:51:06,160
He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic provider.

8350
05:51:06,160 --> 05:51:06,540
I'm sorry.

8351
05:51:06,700 --> 05:51:07,260
It's so funny.

8352
05:51:07,260 --> 05:51:09,300
He came to America because he was jobless.

8353
05:51:10,280 --> 05:51:11,140
He was unemployed.

8354
05:51:11,920 --> 05:51:13,300
He got too far into the killer's mind.

8355
05:51:13,840 --> 05:51:16,060
As a result, he became just like the killer.

8356
05:51:16,700 --> 05:51:20,420
So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's thoughts?

8357
05:51:21,060 --> 05:51:24,540
In any case, after that he became sort of a psychic spy...

8358
05:51:24,540 --> 05:51:26,200
Wait, this music is not...

8359
05:51:26,200 --> 05:51:27,400
He traveled all around the world.

8360
05:51:28,060 --> 05:51:29,940
That's when he was recruited by Foxhound.

8361
05:51:30,500 --> 05:51:31,140
He can read people's minds.

8362
05:51:31,140 --> 05:51:31,660
This is not it.

8363
05:51:31,980 --> 05:51:34,160
He knows every move that you're going to make.

8364
05:51:34,300 --> 05:51:35,420
What should I do?

8365
05:51:35,420 --> 05:51:37,340
I've got no chance of beating him.

8366
05:51:37,600 --> 05:51:39,180
There must be some way.

8367
05:51:39,440 --> 05:51:41,580
He's a master at controlling people, Snake.

8368
05:51:41,880 --> 05:51:43,240
Don't let him manipulate you.

8369
05:51:43,660 --> 05:51:44,960
I don't know about the music.

8370
05:51:46,780 --> 05:51:48,500
I think we just got blasted.

8371
05:51:48,520 --> 05:51:48,700
Yep.

8372
05:51:52,160 --> 05:51:52,640
M9?

8373
05:51:52,760 --> 05:51:53,440
I don't need that.

8374
05:51:54,040 --> 05:51:55,240
Oh, I guess for Meryl.

8375
05:51:58,820 --> 05:51:59,780
Oh, nice.

8376
05:52:00,080 --> 05:52:03,160
Oh my god.

8377
05:52:06,920 --> 05:52:08,720
Okay, maybe I have to try shooting him.

8378
05:52:11,120 --> 05:52:11,800
Oh, shit!

8379
05:52:11,880 --> 05:52:12,140
Ouch!

8380
05:52:13,300 --> 05:52:13,800
Okay.

8381
05:52:13,980 --> 05:52:15,700
I have to remember his patterns again.

8382
05:52:15,840 --> 05:52:16,480
Oh, god.

8383
05:52:17,000 --> 05:52:17,780
Oh, god.

8384
05:52:19,660 --> 05:52:20,660
Oh, that's...

8385
05:52:20,660 --> 05:52:21,700
Oh, no!

8386
05:52:27,720 --> 05:52:28,600
He's right there.

8387
05:52:29,760 --> 05:52:30,580
Oh, god.

8388
05:52:30,680 --> 05:52:30,940
Ouch.

8389
05:52:30,980 --> 05:52:31,380
Ouchie ouch.

8390
05:52:31,640 --> 05:52:33,000
No, not these guys, please.

8391
05:52:33,380 --> 05:52:34,000
Ouchie ouch.

8392
05:52:45,910 --> 05:52:47,250
Colonel, help me!

8393
05:52:47,650 --> 05:52:48,710
How do I shoot him?

8394
05:52:48,750 --> 05:52:49,390
How do I shoot him?

8395
05:52:49,630 --> 05:52:50,630
I don't know what to do.

8396
05:52:51,350 --> 05:52:54,090
Not everything you see with your two eyes is real.

8397
05:52:54,670 --> 05:52:57,730
Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his body.

8398
05:52:58,150 --> 05:52:59,370
Don't let him read you.

8399
05:52:59,430 --> 05:52:59,570
Okay.

8400
05:52:59,930 --> 05:53:00,950
Be a blank slate.

8401
05:53:01,210 --> 05:53:01,690
Okay.

8402
05:53:01,810 --> 05:53:02,150
Okay.

8403
05:53:02,270 --> 05:53:03,390
Clear your mind.

8404
05:53:03,730 --> 05:53:04,210
Um...

8405
05:53:04,210 --> 05:53:04,970
Um...

8406
05:53:04,970 --> 05:53:05,830
His...

8407
05:53:05,830 --> 05:53:06,830
Destroy his spirit.

8408
05:53:08,590 --> 05:53:09,530
Hey, Bozo.

8409
05:53:09,850 --> 05:53:10,550
Oh, god.

8410
05:53:13,390 --> 05:53:14,470
You look really dumb.

8411
05:53:14,470 --> 05:53:15,550
With that, uh...

8412
05:53:18,530 --> 05:53:19,090
Oh, my god.

8413
05:53:20,070 --> 05:53:22,130
You look really stupid with that mask on.

8414
05:53:23,790 --> 05:53:24,150
Uh...

8415
05:53:32,870 --> 05:53:33,230
You...

8416
05:53:33,230 --> 05:53:33,470
Your...

8417
05:53:33,470 --> 05:53:33,890
Your...

8418
05:53:33,890 --> 05:53:35,350
Your pants are ugly.

8419
05:53:35,710 --> 05:53:36,250
Oh, my god.

8420
05:53:38,490 --> 05:53:40,290
Oh, why don't you grow some hair, Baldi?

8421
05:53:40,890 --> 05:53:41,490
Oh, my god.

8422
05:53:41,770 --> 05:53:42,050
Ouch!

8423
05:53:56,160 --> 05:53:57,280
What port to put it in?

8424
05:53:57,380 --> 05:53:57,620
Put it in.

8425
05:53:58,600 --> 05:54:00,100
Somehow, you've got to get around him.

8426
05:54:00,160 --> 05:54:01,560
What port do I put it in?

8427
05:54:02,000 --> 05:54:03,640
Where do I put it in, Campbell?

8428
05:54:04,100 --> 05:54:04,460
Oh, my god.

8429
05:54:05,620 --> 05:54:08,460
He's using his psychic ability to read your controller's moves.

8430
05:54:08,460 --> 05:54:08,820
Campbell!

8431
05:54:09,660 --> 05:54:11,180
That's how he's evading your attack.

8432
05:54:11,820 --> 05:54:12,220
Okay.

8433
05:54:12,300 --> 05:54:13,140
I'm going to try port two.

8434
05:54:13,260 --> 05:54:15,140
You've got to do something so he can't read your controller's moves.

8435
05:54:15,600 --> 05:54:16,000
Think.

8436
05:54:16,320 --> 05:54:17,740
There must be some way.

8437
05:54:17,880 --> 05:54:18,120
Okay.

8438
05:54:18,180 --> 05:54:18,720
I'm on court...

8439
05:54:18,720 --> 05:54:19,820
I'm on port two right now.

8440
05:54:21,600 --> 05:54:22,500
There's four slots.

8441
05:54:23,820 --> 05:54:24,220
What?

8442
05:54:24,280 --> 05:54:25,100
How did that hit me?

8443
05:54:25,140 --> 05:54:26,040
I was on the ground.

8444
05:54:27,080 --> 05:54:27,480
Oh.

8445
05:54:27,720 --> 05:54:28,680
No, no, no, no, no.

8446
05:54:29,320 --> 05:54:29,920
Oh, my god.

8447
05:54:29,960 --> 05:54:30,680
No, no, no, no.

8448
05:54:32,580 --> 05:54:33,380
Oh, my god.

8449
05:54:33,880 --> 05:54:34,280
Oh, my god.

8450
05:54:34,280 --> 05:54:34,320
Oh, my god.

8451
05:54:34,320 --> 05:54:34,740
Where are you?

8452
05:54:44,870 --> 05:54:45,850
Oh, where is he?

8453
05:54:46,870 --> 05:54:47,390
I

8454
05:54:53,080 --> 05:54:55,340
can't tell, actually, if I'm just bad or...

8455
05:54:55,340 --> 05:54:55,960
No.

8456
05:54:56,260 --> 05:54:56,880
Dang it.

8457
05:55:16,450 --> 05:55:16,970
Okay.

8458
05:55:17,110 --> 05:55:18,690
Actually, this remix is kind of awesome.

8459
05:55:26,110 --> 05:55:26,630
Ouch.

8460
05:55:27,970 --> 05:55:28,490
Okay.

8461
05:55:29,170 --> 05:55:29,830
Hold on.

8462
05:55:30,270 --> 05:55:31,470
It's not port two.

8463
05:55:32,790 --> 05:55:33,310
Turtle.

8464
05:55:33,630 --> 05:55:34,150
Turtle.

8465
05:55:34,390 --> 05:55:34,810
Turtle.

8466
05:55:36,610 --> 05:55:39,930
He's using his psychic ability to read your controller's moves.

8467
05:55:40,650 --> 05:55:42,190
That's how he's evading your attack.

8468
05:55:42,330 --> 05:55:42,430
Okay.

8469
05:55:42,430 --> 05:55:42,870
I'm going to try.

8470
05:55:43,090 --> 05:55:46,190
You've got to do something so he can't read your controller's moves.

8471
05:55:46,550 --> 05:55:46,990
Port three.

8472
05:55:47,330 --> 05:55:48,050
There must be some way.

8473
05:55:48,050 --> 05:55:48,250
Port three.

8474
05:55:48,250 --> 05:55:48,750
Port three.

8475
05:55:48,810 --> 05:55:49,250
Port three.

8476
05:55:49,530 --> 05:55:49,970
Okay.

8477
05:55:51,630 --> 05:55:52,070
Oh.

8478
05:55:52,130 --> 05:55:52,410
Wait.

8479
05:55:52,470 --> 05:55:52,850
Where am I?

8480
05:55:52,910 --> 05:55:53,090
Oh.

8481
05:55:53,130 --> 05:55:54,230
I blend in with the floor.

8482
05:55:57,630 --> 05:55:58,330
Where are you?

8483
05:55:58,390 --> 05:55:58,930
There you are.

8484
05:56:00,890 --> 05:56:01,770
Come on.

8485
05:56:01,790 --> 05:56:02,290
Stop it.

8486
05:56:03,630 --> 05:56:04,430
Stop moving.

8487
05:56:04,590 --> 05:56:04,810
Oh.

8488
05:56:06,930 --> 05:56:07,330
Oh.

8489
05:56:09,200 --> 05:56:10,180
Did I get you?

8490
05:56:11,460 --> 05:56:11,860
Oh.

8491
05:56:11,940 --> 05:56:12,180
Oh.

8492
05:56:12,340 --> 05:56:12,660
Nice.

8493
05:56:12,820 --> 05:56:12,940
Nice.

8494
05:56:13,020 --> 05:56:13,100
Nice.

8495
05:56:21,680 --> 05:56:22,080
Okay.

8496
05:56:22,200 --> 05:56:22,560
Port three.

8497
05:56:24,240 --> 05:56:24,640
Oh.

8498
05:56:27,660 --> 05:56:27,860
Oh.

8499
05:56:27,860 --> 05:56:28,000
Oh.

8500
05:56:28,000 --> 05:56:28,480
That's my arrow.

8501
05:56:28,560 --> 05:56:28,780
Ouch.

8502
05:56:37,130 --> 05:56:38,090
That didn't work.

8503
05:56:43,990 --> 05:56:44,790
Cut it out.

8504
05:56:44,890 --> 05:56:45,390
Cut it out.

8505
05:56:48,970 --> 05:56:49,770
I can't...

8506
05:56:57,800 --> 05:56:58,560
Is it working?

8507
05:56:59,240 --> 05:56:59,640
Oh.

8508
05:57:01,390 --> 05:57:02,830
It doesn't seem to be working.

8509
05:57:03,090 --> 05:57:03,490
Oh.

8510
05:57:09,120 --> 05:57:09,480
Oh.

8511
05:57:09,520 --> 05:57:09,640
Oh, my God.

8512
05:57:09,680 --> 05:57:10,340
Not this thing again.

8513
05:57:10,900 --> 05:57:12,020
Not this guy, please.

8514
05:57:15,720 --> 05:57:16,420
Let's get here.

8515
05:57:16,620 --> 05:57:17,560
Oh, there's saw combos.

8516
05:57:20,480 --> 05:57:21,380
Where are you at?

8517
05:57:21,460 --> 05:57:21,840
There you are.

8518
05:57:22,440 --> 05:57:23,280
Oh, my God.

8519
05:57:23,420 --> 05:57:24,140
Shut up.

8520
05:57:28,400 --> 05:57:30,560
He's so slippery.

8521
05:57:30,820 --> 05:57:32,200
This guy is moving everywhere.

8522
05:57:33,080 --> 05:57:34,920
I don't think my shots are hitting him.

8523
05:57:37,860 --> 05:57:38,220
He's so slippery.

8524
05:57:38,220 --> 05:57:38,260
How is he?

8525
05:57:38,440 --> 05:57:38,620
I don't think...

8526
05:57:38,620 --> 05:57:38,660
I don't know.

8527
05:57:38,660 --> 05:57:38,700
I'm not sure.

8528
05:57:38,700 --> 05:57:38,720
I'm not sure.

8529
05:57:41,130 --> 05:57:45,090
Like, I know I'm bad, but like... Even

8530
05:57:52,220 --> 05:57:53,700
when he's still...

8531
05:58:07,180 --> 05:58:08,220
Oh no!

8532
05:58:13,240 --> 05:58:14,460
He dodged it still!

8533
05:58:15,520 --> 05:58:16,560
Wait, Colonel!

8534
05:58:16,740 --> 05:58:17,380
Colonel, wait!

8535
05:58:18,400 --> 05:58:19,860
Wait, Colonel, I think I...

8536
05:58:20,420 --> 05:58:24,520
Snake, is there any reason you can't use controller socket 4?

8537
05:58:24,520 --> 05:58:24,740
Oh.

8538
05:58:25,740 --> 05:58:26,480
Four?

8539
05:58:27,200 --> 05:58:27,940
Oh,

8540
05:58:32,840 --> 05:58:34,400
okay.

8541
05:58:37,320 --> 05:58:38,960
Four is a spooky number.

8542
05:58:39,320 --> 05:58:40,160
That's why.

8543
05:58:40,560 --> 05:58:42,320
Okay, we got this now.

8544
05:58:44,100 --> 05:58:44,840
Maybe.

8545
05:58:45,180 --> 05:58:47,640
Oh, if I can aim.

8546
05:58:47,960 --> 05:58:49,360
If I can aim for...

8547
05:58:53,460 --> 05:58:54,800
That's so funny.

8548
05:58:55,300 --> 05:58:55,740
What?

8549
05:58:56,540 --> 05:58:57,900
Oh, John.

8550
05:58:59,300 --> 05:59:00,420
These things suck.

8551
05:59:06,940 --> 05:59:08,420
Gosh, dang it, this guy again.

8552
05:59:13,560 --> 05:59:14,520
He's right there!

8553
05:59:20,710 --> 05:59:22,530
Actually, what if I use the fan mess instead?

8554
05:59:25,530 --> 05:59:26,370
Where are you?

8555
05:59:26,470 --> 05:59:26,790
Come here.

8556
05:59:30,430 --> 05:59:31,350
Where did you go?

8557
05:59:35,830 --> 05:59:36,710
And... shoot!

8558
06:00:06,920 --> 06:00:08,060
Whoa, whoa, where did you go?

8559
06:00:08,060 --> 06:00:08,140
Oh.

8560
06:00:08,140 --> 06:00:08,520
Oh.

8561
06:00:08,880 --> 06:00:09,440
Dang.

8562
06:00:09,540 --> 06:00:09,700
This

8563
06:00:18,180 --> 06:00:19,040
is so scuffed.

8564
06:00:20,240 --> 06:00:22,900
This is so scuffed.

8565
06:00:25,960 --> 06:00:32,120
I was gonna say, it's way easier than the original, but it's just funny.

8566
06:00:32,780 --> 06:00:35,540
It's just funny how...

8567
06:00:36,720 --> 06:00:37,160
Hahahaha!

8568
06:00:39,880 --> 06:00:40,320
Ouch!

8569
06:00:41,320 --> 06:00:41,760
Oh!

8570
06:00:42,700 --> 06:00:43,140
And...

8571
06:00:44,040 --> 06:00:44,880
And, oh!

8572
06:00:45,320 --> 06:00:45,660
And, oh!

8573
06:00:45,820 --> 06:00:47,020
And, back to me.

8574
06:00:48,220 --> 06:00:49,540
Oh, not this guy again.

8575
06:00:50,480 --> 06:00:51,900
This is kinda the best spot.

8576
06:01:01,070 --> 06:01:02,790
Uh, this is so funny.

8577
06:01:03,350 --> 06:01:03,790
Oh.

8578
06:01:04,490 --> 06:01:05,670
Oh, not Meryl again.

8579
06:01:05,830 --> 06:01:06,710
Okay, this is fine though.

8580
06:01:06,730 --> 06:01:07,050
This is fine.

8581
06:01:07,750 --> 06:01:08,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

8582
06:01:09,090 --> 06:01:09,690
What's going on?

8583
06:01:09,750 --> 06:01:10,290
What's going on?

8584
06:01:11,410 --> 06:01:11,850
Uh...

8585
06:01:11,850 --> 06:01:12,550
I don't know.

8586
06:01:12,550 --> 06:01:13,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

8587
06:01:15,110 --> 06:01:16,010
Oh, girly.

8588
06:01:16,070 --> 06:01:16,890
Ah, girly!

8589
06:01:16,990 --> 06:01:17,410
Hold on!

8590
06:01:21,970 --> 06:01:22,630
We'll get her.

8591
06:01:22,690 --> 06:01:23,290
We'll get her down.

8592
06:01:23,870 --> 06:01:24,410
Come on.

8593
06:01:25,190 --> 06:01:25,810
There we go.

8594
06:01:26,730 --> 06:01:27,430
Easy peasy.

8595
06:01:54,340 --> 06:01:55,460
That was close.

8596
06:01:59,280 --> 06:02:00,160
Meryl, stop!

8597
06:02:00,400 --> 06:02:01,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

8598
06:02:02,820 --> 06:02:05,140
I thought me punching her did enough.

8599
06:02:08,060 --> 06:02:09,640
Um... Okay, that should be good now.

8600
06:02:10,800 --> 06:02:11,180
Okay.

8601
06:02:38,100 --> 06:02:40,560
Okay, so fa- Oh, oh, I ran right into that.

8602
06:02:53,690 --> 06:02:54,570
Where are you?

8603
06:02:54,990 --> 06:02:55,730
Oh, there you are.

8604
06:02:56,530 --> 06:02:56,910
What?

8605
06:02:58,170 --> 06:03:00,310
I cannot read you!

8606
06:03:00,490 --> 06:03:01,350
Oh, where did you go?

8607
06:03:02,110 --> 06:03:02,490
Nobody?

8608
06:03:04,310 --> 06:03:05,070
Oh, no.

8609
06:03:06,030 --> 06:03:07,010
Where are you?

8610
06:03:07,110 --> 06:03:07,130
Oh.

8611
06:03:13,520 --> 06:03:14,000
Ouch!

8612
06:03:24,380 --> 06:03:25,440
He's so fast.

8613
06:03:29,620 --> 06:03:31,280
I shot him in the butt!

8614
06:03:32,120 --> 06:03:34,080
Oh, uh, oh, dang it.

8615
06:03:34,220 --> 06:03:35,480
I pressed X too slowly.

8616
06:03:37,820 --> 06:03:39,060
Oh, they're all coming out.

8617
06:03:39,220 --> 06:03:40,780
Oh, he's pulling out all the stops.

8618
06:03:41,700 --> 06:03:42,360
That's fine.

8619
06:03:45,700 --> 06:03:46,780
I can still hit you.

8620
06:03:53,920 --> 06:03:55,860
Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.

8621
06:03:56,280 --> 06:03:56,720
Is she?

8622
06:03:57,860 --> 06:03:59,220
I owe you one.

8623
06:03:59,400 --> 06:04:00,260
No way.

8624
06:04:01,360 --> 06:04:03,520
The boss fights in this are crazy.

8625
06:04:05,420 --> 06:04:08,640
But why did you go so far out of your way to save her?

8626
06:04:09,260 --> 06:04:10,460
For Campbell's sake?

8627
06:04:10,900 --> 06:04:12,440
Or maybe it's because you like her?

8628
06:04:12,440 --> 06:04:15,260
I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.

8629
06:04:15,300 --> 06:04:16,400
Or a person, you know?

8630
06:04:16,400 --> 06:04:17,200
I don't want to see anyone die.

8631
06:04:17,200 --> 06:04:19,400
Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?

8632
06:04:20,840 --> 06:04:23,620
Naomi, it's true that Snake has killed a lot of people.

8633
06:04:23,960 --> 06:04:26,400
But that does not mean he doesn't have a heart.

8634
06:04:26,920 --> 06:04:27,840
It's okay, Colonel.

8635
06:04:28,960 --> 06:04:29,580
She's right.

8636
06:04:30,240 --> 06:04:31,180
Nah, just women.

8637
06:04:32,240 --> 06:04:33,020
Arigato, arigato.

8638
06:04:33,280 --> 06:04:39,280
Is it still possible to beat Psycho Mantis by dying twice and calling the Colonel afterwards to find out what's during the statue bust?

8639
06:04:39,400 --> 06:04:40,000
Oh, yeah!

8640
06:04:40,320 --> 06:04:40,720
Okay.

8641
06:04:42,560 --> 06:04:44,200
Should I switch back to port one?

8642
06:04:45,440 --> 06:04:46,700
Does it matter at this point?

8643
06:04:52,840 --> 06:04:53,740
Controller port?

8644
06:04:54,000 --> 06:04:54,700
Yeah, sorry.

8645
06:04:58,220 --> 06:04:58,880
I know.

8646
06:05:00,320 --> 06:05:09,460
I'm like trying port two, port three, and then Colonel's just like, hey, any reason you haven't switched to port four, dummy?

8647
06:05:13,980 --> 06:05:21,320
To get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base, you have to go through the hidden door.

8648
06:05:21,780 --> 06:05:23,040
Open the door.

8649
06:05:23,260 --> 06:05:25,440
There's a hidden door behind the bookcase.

8650
06:05:25,720 --> 06:05:25,980
Yeah.

8651
06:05:28,440 --> 06:05:29,440
Called out.

8652
06:05:31,740 --> 06:05:34,500
I thought, well, I hit him that one time.

8653
06:05:34,780 --> 06:05:36,760
Go past the communication towers.

8654
06:05:36,760 --> 06:05:38,480
So I thought with the three port, it was fine.

8655
06:05:38,620 --> 06:05:39,600
And use the tower's walkway.

8656
06:05:40,840 --> 06:05:41,440
Hang time.

8657
06:05:41,440 --> 06:05:42,400
And then I'll tell you this.

8658
06:05:43,500 --> 06:05:46,400
I can read people's minds.

8659
06:05:46,420 --> 06:05:47,620
First time clear.

8660
06:05:47,780 --> 06:05:50,680
In my lifetime, I have read the past thousands and futures.

8661
06:05:50,680 --> 06:05:51,780
This game is way easier.

8662
06:05:52,600 --> 06:05:55,320
You don't need to thank, or you don't need to congratulate me.

8663
06:05:55,500 --> 06:05:56,600
Thousands upon thousands of men and women.

8664
06:05:56,600 --> 06:05:57,900
But thank you so much for that, Akadu.

8665
06:06:00,880 --> 06:06:01,920
Oh, disgust.

8666
06:06:04,020 --> 06:06:05,060
Oh, God.

8667
06:06:05,140 --> 06:06:06,000
Oh, gross.

8668
06:06:06,200 --> 06:06:07,500
Oh, you're so mean, Meryl.

8669
06:06:08,520 --> 06:06:11,360
And each mind that I peered into.

8670
06:06:11,360 --> 06:06:16,120
Was stuffed with the same single object of obsession.

8671
06:06:16,680 --> 06:06:22,580
That selfish and atrophistic desire to pass on one's seed.

8672
06:06:22,880 --> 06:06:26,040
It wasn't enough to make me sick.

8673
06:06:26,360 --> 06:06:34,020
Every living thing on this planet exists to mindlessly pass on their DNA.

8674
06:06:34,740 --> 06:06:36,760
We're designed that way.

8675
06:06:37,060 --> 06:06:40,240
And that is why there is war.

8676
06:06:40,240 --> 06:06:41,420
Is that?

8677
06:06:41,660 --> 06:06:42,520
But you...

8678
06:06:42,520 --> 06:06:43,480
Is that it?

8679
06:06:43,620 --> 06:06:43,920
...different.

8680
06:06:44,260 --> 06:06:45,360
I don't know about that.

8681
06:06:45,680 --> 06:06:47,140
You're the same as us.

8682
06:06:47,540 --> 06:06:49,080
We have no past.

8683
06:06:49,340 --> 06:06:50,540
No future.

8684
06:06:50,760 --> 06:06:51,520
Aw, no.

8685
06:06:51,580 --> 06:06:52,620
Snake has his dogs.

8686
06:06:53,020 --> 06:06:53,420
We live in the moment.

8687
06:06:53,420 --> 06:06:54,980
That's our only purpose.

8688
06:06:55,580 --> 06:06:56,980
He has his dogs.

8689
06:06:56,980 --> 06:07:00,460
Humans weren't designed to bring each other happiness.

8690
06:07:00,520 --> 06:07:02,320
I kind of like that they're not showing his face.

8691
06:07:02,580 --> 06:07:09,540
From the moment we're thrown into this world, we're fated to bring each other nothing but pain and...

8692
06:07:09,540 --> 06:07:10,120
Ah!

8693
06:07:10,240 --> 06:07:10,860
Oh, just kidding.

8694
06:07:12,000 --> 06:07:16,960
The first person whose mind I dove into was my father's.

8695
06:07:16,980 --> 06:07:17,380
Don't scare.

8696
06:07:18,360 --> 06:07:23,200
I saw nothing but disgust and hatred for me.

8697
06:07:23,200 --> 06:07:23,820
It is hard.

8698
06:07:23,960 --> 06:07:25,300
Because I was thinking in like...

8699
06:07:25,300 --> 06:07:27,660
My mother died in childbirth.

8700
06:07:27,700 --> 06:07:34,740
In the original, they show his face obviously, but it's more low poly, so you can't really tell how he looks exactly.

8701
06:07:34,960 --> 06:07:35,500
My father was going to kill me.

8702
06:07:38,840 --> 06:07:39,400
Oh.

8703
06:07:39,400 --> 06:07:42,180
That's when my future disappeared.

8704
06:07:43,020 --> 06:07:44,000
Voldemort confirmed.

8705
06:07:44,320 --> 06:07:45,300
And my past as well.

8706
06:07:46,040 --> 06:07:50,880
When I came to, the village was engulfed in flames.

8707
06:07:51,540 --> 06:07:55,780
Are you saying that you burned your village down to bury your past?

8708
06:07:57,160 --> 06:08:00,020
I see that you have suffered the same trauma.

8709
06:08:02,120 --> 06:08:03,960
We are truly the same.

8710
06:08:04,120 --> 06:08:05,340
You and I.

8711
06:08:05,340 --> 06:08:11,440
The world is a more interesting place with people like you in it.

8712
06:08:14,420 --> 06:08:17,900
I never agreed with the boss's revolution.

8713
06:08:18,720 --> 06:08:23,260
His dreams of world conquest do not interest me.

8714
06:08:23,960 --> 06:08:29,240
I just want an excuse to kill as many people as I could.

8715
06:08:30,880 --> 06:08:32,180
You monster.

8716
06:08:32,540 --> 06:08:33,080
Let him talk.

8717
06:08:33,320 --> 06:08:33,800
Yeah.

8718
06:08:33,800 --> 06:08:35,520
He doesn't have much time left.

8719
06:08:38,580 --> 06:08:40,560
I've seen true evil.

8720
06:08:41,420 --> 06:08:46,040
Snake, seeing you calms my soul.

8721
06:08:46,440 --> 06:08:47,580
Let him cook.

8722
06:08:47,760 --> 06:08:48,400
I'm like the boss.

8723
06:08:48,680 --> 06:08:49,860
No, worse.

8724
06:08:50,520 --> 06:08:51,300
That's so messed up.

8725
06:08:51,520 --> 06:08:54,060
Compared to you, I'm like a saint.

8726
06:08:54,600 --> 06:08:56,120
How could you even say that?

8727
06:08:56,800 --> 06:08:59,640
I read her mind as well.

8728
06:09:00,340 --> 06:09:00,940
Meryl's.

8729
06:09:00,940 --> 06:09:03,160
I saw you there.

8730
06:09:03,620 --> 06:09:06,540
You have a large place in her heart.

8731
06:09:07,100 --> 06:09:08,580
A large place.

8732
06:09:09,440 --> 06:09:11,160
And getting bigger.

8733
06:09:15,520 --> 06:09:19,840
But I do not know if your futures lie together.

8734
06:09:20,300 --> 06:09:20,960
Oh, they do not.

8735
06:09:24,680 --> 06:09:25,900
Getting bigger.

8736
06:09:26,080 --> 06:09:27,840
I have a last request.

8737
06:09:29,180 --> 06:09:30,260
What is it?

8738
06:09:31,720 --> 06:09:32,960
My mask.

8739
06:09:33,320 --> 06:09:34,820
Put it back on.

8740
06:09:35,560 --> 06:09:36,240
Okay.

8741
06:09:36,340 --> 06:09:37,780
The voices are too strong.

8742
06:09:38,120 --> 06:09:44,140
Like this, other people's thoughts force their way into my mind.

8743
06:09:44,660 --> 06:09:48,820
Before I die, I want to be by myself.

8744
06:09:49,540 --> 06:09:53,680
I want to be left alone in my own world.

8745
06:09:54,040 --> 06:09:54,260
No.

8746
06:09:54,920 --> 06:09:57,200
I really like Psycho Mantis.

8747
06:10:13,730 --> 06:10:15,550
I'll open the door for you.

8748
06:10:16,470 --> 06:10:21,970
If you want to find your future, go through that door.

8749
06:10:24,650 --> 06:10:28,790
The controller is rumbling more than when he was controlling it.

8750
06:10:28,990 --> 06:10:34,290
This is the first time I've ever used my power to help someone.

8751
06:10:34,870 --> 06:10:35,670
Awww.

8752
06:10:40,530 --> 06:10:41,330
Strange.

8753
06:10:42,310 --> 06:10:45,370
Such a nostalgic feeling.

8754
06:11:01,990 --> 06:11:07,490
Even in a goofy version of the series like this, it gets me all choked up.

8755
06:11:08,790 --> 06:11:09,950
Let's go, Meryl.

8756
06:11:11,370 --> 06:11:12,270
I'm sorry.

8757
06:11:13,710 --> 06:11:14,310
Meryl.

8758
06:11:14,990 --> 06:11:18,330
How could I let Mantis control my mind like that?

8759
06:11:19,930 --> 06:11:22,890
If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here.

8760
06:11:24,710 --> 06:11:25,510
You're right.

8761
06:11:27,150 --> 06:11:28,490
Don't regret your past.

8762
06:11:28,810 --> 06:11:29,750
Learn from it.

8763
06:11:30,170 --> 06:11:31,890
Regrets just make a person weaker.

8764
06:11:32,290 --> 06:11:33,830
So true, Snake.

8765
06:11:34,250 --> 06:11:34,850
You're right.

8766
06:11:35,330 --> 06:11:36,090
I'm sorry.

8767
06:11:36,890 --> 06:11:38,190
I won't do it again.

8768
06:11:39,970 --> 06:11:41,850
Snake, can I ask you something?

8769
06:11:42,190 --> 06:11:43,110
What's your name?

8770
06:11:43,230 --> 06:11:43,870
What's your birthday?

8771
06:11:44,170 --> 06:11:44,750
More complaints.

8772
06:11:45,010 --> 06:11:45,390
Your family.

8773
06:11:46,070 --> 06:11:47,530
About what Mantis said.

8774
06:11:48,070 --> 06:11:49,170
I was just wondering...

8775
06:11:50,130 --> 06:11:51,170
No regrets.

8776
06:11:51,310 --> 06:11:52,070
No regrets.

8777
06:11:52,590 --> 06:11:52,950
What?

8778
06:11:53,050 --> 06:11:53,750
What's the problem now?

8779
06:11:53,750 --> 06:11:54,110
No regrets.

8780
06:11:56,610 --> 06:11:57,790
Oh, no.

8781
06:11:58,350 --> 06:11:58,890
Nothing.

8782
06:11:59,210 --> 06:11:59,810
What's your issue?

8783
06:11:59,990 --> 06:12:01,910
What are you complaining about?

8784
06:12:01,970 --> 06:12:02,550
Are you cold?

8785
06:12:03,210 --> 06:12:04,170
What's your name?

8786
06:12:05,150 --> 06:12:06,410
Your real name.

8787
06:12:06,590 --> 06:12:07,350
I don't got one.

8788
06:12:07,930 --> 06:12:10,170
A name means nothing on the battlefield.

8789
06:12:10,790 --> 06:12:13,050
After a week, no one has a name.

8790
06:12:14,750 --> 06:12:15,930
How old are you?

8791
06:12:17,630 --> 06:12:18,470
Old enough.

8792
06:12:18,550 --> 06:12:20,530
Old enough to know what death looks like.

8793
06:12:21,710 --> 06:12:22,790
Any family?

8794
06:12:22,790 --> 06:12:23,170
No.

8795
06:12:24,490 --> 06:12:26,410
But I was raised by many people.

8796
06:12:27,350 --> 06:12:28,850
Is there anyone you like?

8797
06:12:30,770 --> 06:12:31,650
My dogs.

8798
06:12:33,370 --> 06:12:36,130
I've never been interested in anyone else's life.

8799
06:12:36,890 --> 06:12:38,040
My fifty huskies.

8800
06:12:38,790 --> 06:12:40,270
So you are all alone.

8801
06:12:40,770 --> 06:12:42,190
Just like Mantis said.

8802
06:12:47,000 --> 06:12:49,140
Other people just complicate my life.

8803
06:12:49,320 --> 06:12:50,600
I don't like to get involved.

8804
06:12:52,440 --> 06:12:54,460
You're a sad, lonely man.

8805
06:12:56,840 --> 06:12:57,420
Come on.

8806
06:12:57,840 --> 06:12:58,360
Let's go.

8807
06:12:59,620 --> 06:13:06,660
I like the original more because I think in the original it was more like kind of quick, like quick quips.

8808
06:13:06,720 --> 06:13:07,900
Like, how old are you?

8809
06:13:07,900 --> 06:13:08,300
Blah, blah, blah.

8810
06:13:09,380 --> 06:13:09,980
Where are you?

8811
06:13:10,000 --> 06:13:12,500
Like, how many people are in your family?

8812
06:13:12,580 --> 06:13:13,080
Blah, blah, blah.

8813
06:13:13,220 --> 06:13:15,360
Like it was, oh, oh, I used controller.

8814
06:13:18,760 --> 06:13:19,600
There we go.

8815
06:13:20,100 --> 06:13:20,580
Look out.

8816
06:13:20,900 --> 06:13:21,260
Yay!

8817
06:13:21,260 --> 06:13:21,320
Yay!

8818
06:13:23,260 --> 06:13:24,320
Plugged it all back up.

8819
06:13:26,380 --> 06:13:29,480
Why is it so loud in my rumbly ears?

8820
06:13:32,820 --> 06:13:34,120
Who is this guy?

8821
06:13:38,020 --> 06:13:38,700
Who's that guy?

8822
06:13:42,580 --> 06:13:43,720
Actually, who's this guy too?

8823
06:13:49,030 --> 06:13:50,670
Oh, Silicon Knights guy!

8824
06:13:51,190 --> 06:13:51,410
Oh!

8825
06:13:52,590 --> 06:13:53,750
I see, I see, I see.

8826
06:13:56,350 --> 06:13:57,730
Wait, that's Yoji Shinkawa?

8827
06:13:59,810 --> 06:14:00,590
Is it actually?

8828
06:14:00,730 --> 06:14:01,670
He looks, no.

8829
06:14:02,290 --> 06:14:02,830
Is it?

8830
06:14:02,930 --> 06:14:04,270
He looks so young if that's him.

8831
06:14:06,430 --> 06:14:07,850
Is it actually Yoji Shinkawa?

8832
06:14:08,030 --> 06:14:10,350
Oh my gosh, I didn't recognize him because he looks so young.

8833
06:14:11,670 --> 06:14:12,350
No way!

8834
06:14:14,510 --> 06:14:15,390
Oh my gosh.

8835
06:14:16,050 --> 06:14:17,610
I mean, so does Hideo Kojima.

8836
06:14:17,750 --> 06:14:18,430
He looks so young.

8837
06:14:21,930 --> 06:14:22,510
Oops, sorry.

8838
06:14:25,050 --> 06:14:26,130
Ugh, I'm gonna miss this sound.

8839
06:14:27,570 --> 06:14:28,410
So crisp.

8840
06:14:29,450 --> 06:14:29,910
Yummy.

8841
06:14:39,510 --> 06:14:40,210
Good night.

8842
06:14:40,330 --> 06:14:41,550
Good night, sweet prince.

8843
06:14:45,830 --> 06:14:46,930
Alright, let's go, Merrill.

8844
06:14:49,990 --> 06:14:50,850
Oh, let's save.

8845
06:14:56,710 --> 06:14:57,170
Tongues!

8846
06:14:59,750 --> 06:15:01,510
No, I didn't use tongue.

8847
06:15:02,850 --> 06:15:04,130
Timelessly lie with their dying breaths.

8848
06:15:04,770 --> 06:15:06,310
I think he was telling the truth.

8849
06:15:06,950 --> 06:15:08,350
Maybe you should believe him.

8850
06:15:08,910 --> 06:15:09,410
Hmm.

8851
06:15:13,670 --> 06:15:15,090
Maybe you should believe him.

8852
06:15:17,990 --> 06:15:19,450
Now you can eat your pizza in peace.

8853
06:15:19,590 --> 06:15:21,310
Actually, I already finished it.

8854
06:15:22,570 --> 06:15:24,350
I already finished my pizza.

8855
06:15:25,470 --> 06:15:26,910
Please Snake, don't give up.

8856
06:15:27,210 --> 06:15:28,070
Don't give up.

8857
06:15:28,510 --> 06:15:31,290
I think, actually, maybe we'll get to, right?

8858
06:15:31,470 --> 06:15:32,530
Like we'll get to...

8859
06:15:36,050 --> 06:15:37,150
Uh... Sniper Wolf.

8860
06:15:37,770 --> 06:15:39,070
Not finished Sniper Wolf.

8861
06:15:39,150 --> 06:15:44,370
We'll get to Meryl being down and then we can end it, because... I want to go keep going, just a little bit more.

8862
06:15:47,370 --> 06:15:48,210
You're welcome.

8863
06:15:48,670 --> 06:15:49,050
Oh.

8864
06:15:49,750 --> 06:15:51,350
You have something to say?

8865
06:15:52,550 --> 06:15:53,910
Can you please eat the mic?

8866
06:15:53,910 --> 06:15:57,130
You should be able to go north from the commander's room.

8867
06:16:01,330 --> 06:16:02,330
Master Mailer?

8868
06:16:03,490 --> 06:16:04,490
Psycho Mantis.

8869
06:16:04,710 --> 06:16:06,170
What a pathetic man.

8870
06:16:06,510 --> 06:16:10,930
He was born with all the right tools, but he never knew how to use them.

8871
06:16:10,990 --> 06:16:13,030
Never knew how to use them.

8872
06:16:16,550 --> 06:16:17,650
She's right behind me.

8873
06:16:18,130 --> 06:16:20,270
But if she's just like Snake, I'm right here.

8874
06:16:22,390 --> 06:16:25,450
The enormous costs for the development of military...

8875
06:16:25,470 --> 06:16:29,010
Are you eating your pizza while touching your controller with greasy hands?

8876
06:16:29,450 --> 06:16:29,930
Sacrilege.

8877
06:16:29,990 --> 06:16:30,470
No!

8878
06:16:33,230 --> 06:16:35,370
It's not... It wasn't that greasy of a pizza.

8879
06:16:35,690 --> 06:16:36,670
What did you say?

8880
06:16:37,170 --> 06:16:39,690
I missed what Nastasha said because of you.

8881
06:16:48,930 --> 06:16:50,990
Oh yeah, I forgot about Otacon.

8882
06:16:51,190 --> 06:16:51,810
Sorry, Otacon.

8883
06:16:53,290 --> 06:16:54,270
Wait, is he listed?

8884
06:16:55,470 --> 06:16:56,250
I don't remember what his codec is.

8885
06:17:01,730 --> 06:17:03,630
Is he in here?

8886
06:17:03,990 --> 06:17:04,530
Oh no.

8887
06:17:04,690 --> 06:17:06,410
What is Otacon's codec?

8888
06:17:08,050 --> 06:17:09,630
One for... Ah yes, 14112.

8889
06:17:18,640 --> 06:17:19,040
Sorry?

8890
06:17:19,040 --> 06:17:21,340
I guess fighting was all he ever knew.

8891
06:17:21,660 --> 06:17:23,360
What are you feeling sorry for him?

8892
06:17:23,440 --> 06:17:23,720
Sorry?

8893
06:17:24,060 --> 06:17:25,320
The Mantis had incredible power.

8894
06:17:25,360 --> 06:17:25,860
Mr. Hater.

8895
06:17:26,280 --> 06:17:27,160
Fantastic power.

8896
06:17:27,160 --> 06:17:27,600
Are you Canadian?

8897
06:17:28,120 --> 06:17:30,700
Maybe that power could have been used to make people happy.

8898
06:17:30,820 --> 06:17:31,560
Did you just say sorry?

8899
06:17:31,660 --> 06:17:34,720
It's a sad thing when you see all that power being used just for war.

8900
06:17:37,740 --> 06:17:39,900
What are you feeling sorry for him?

8901
06:17:45,700 --> 06:17:46,180
Snake.

8902
06:17:47,380 --> 06:17:50,340
Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north.

8903
06:17:50,620 --> 06:17:51,100
Hurry!

8904
06:17:55,860 --> 06:17:56,160
Snake.

8905
06:17:56,860 --> 06:17:57,460
Okay.

8906
06:18:01,600 --> 06:18:02,460
Let's go.

8907
06:18:03,300 --> 06:18:04,200
What's over here?

8908
06:18:05,260 --> 06:18:05,860
Nice.

8909
06:18:05,940 --> 06:18:06,900
Oh, sorry.

8910
06:18:07,000 --> 06:18:07,500
Sorry, girl.

8911
06:18:07,600 --> 06:18:07,960
Wow.

8912
06:18:08,100 --> 06:18:08,580
Okay.

8913
06:18:10,140 --> 06:18:12,920
You don't have to be so dramatic about it, Meryl.

8914
06:18:14,040 --> 06:18:14,640
Sheesh.

8915
06:18:17,440 --> 06:18:19,360
Left picture is Ryuhei Kitamura.

8916
06:18:19,360 --> 06:18:22,980
Japanese movie director who directed the Twin Snake cutscenes.

8917
06:18:23,140 --> 06:18:23,300
Oh!

8918
06:18:24,440 --> 06:18:25,360
I was gonna say.

8919
06:18:25,620 --> 06:18:26,520
Could there be wolves in here?

8920
06:18:27,380 --> 06:18:28,280
I was like...

8921
06:18:28,280 --> 06:18:29,060
Wolf dogs.

8922
06:18:29,140 --> 06:18:29,460
No wonder.

8923
06:18:29,600 --> 06:18:29,780
Okay.

8924
06:18:29,960 --> 06:18:31,340
So it wasn't Yoji Shikawa.

8925
06:18:31,560 --> 06:18:32,980
I feel... I don't feel as bad now.

8926
06:18:33,140 --> 06:18:33,980
How do you know so much?

8927
06:18:34,360 --> 06:18:34,760
Oh!

8928
06:18:35,700 --> 06:18:37,160
Five, six, seven, oh, nine.

8929
06:18:37,280 --> 06:18:37,940
I'm a musher.

8930
06:18:38,180 --> 06:18:38,800
Oh, my God.

8931
06:18:38,880 --> 06:18:39,480
I love it.

8932
06:18:40,880 --> 06:18:41,680
I'll take point.

8933
06:18:41,940 --> 06:18:43,100
Snake, you follow me.

8934
06:18:44,700 --> 06:18:45,100
Oh!

8935
06:18:57,930 --> 06:18:59,130
Oh, that's where we crawl through.

8936
06:19:00,330 --> 06:19:00,810
Huh?

8937
06:19:00,970 --> 06:19:02,030
Whose footsteps are these?

8938
06:19:04,010 --> 06:19:04,830
Where did you go?

8939
06:19:05,150 --> 06:19:05,930
Follow me.

8940
06:19:06,110 --> 06:19:07,370
To where, madam?

8941
06:19:08,190 --> 06:19:09,310
You just left me...

8942
06:19:09,310 --> 06:19:10,330
You left me to die.

8943
06:19:14,400 --> 06:19:14,880
No.

8944
06:19:16,080 --> 06:19:16,560
No.

8945
06:19:16,600 --> 06:19:17,900
We can fit through there.

8946
06:19:20,040 --> 06:19:20,520
Okay.

8947
06:19:20,580 --> 06:19:22,640
I believed it maybe in...

8948
06:19:24,100 --> 06:19:24,580
In...

8949
06:19:24,580 --> 06:19:26,760
In the original, but there...

8950
06:19:26,760 --> 06:19:27,860
No, we can fit through that.

8951
06:19:29,440 --> 06:19:32,280
Please do a $40 reward.

8952
06:19:32,600 --> 06:19:33,100
Oh!

8953
06:19:34,420 --> 06:19:34,920
Oh!

8954
06:19:36,320 --> 06:19:36,820
Oh!

8955
06:19:38,740 --> 06:19:40,200
We can fit through that.

8956
06:19:40,780 --> 06:19:41,920
Snake, just go through.

8957
06:19:47,520 --> 06:19:48,760
Sounds kind of meaty.

8958
06:19:52,340 --> 06:19:53,800
We can fit through that.

8959
06:19:56,620 --> 06:19:57,840
Is this the way we came from?

8960
06:19:57,920 --> 06:19:58,100
Yeah.

8961
06:19:59,700 --> 06:20:00,200
Oh!

8962
06:20:00,720 --> 06:20:01,220
Oh!

8963
06:20:01,220 --> 06:20:04,180
How do I get the dogs to pee on my box?

8964
06:20:07,720 --> 06:20:08,560
Oh, I hear them.

8965
06:20:09,160 --> 06:20:10,360
I hear them growling.

8966
06:20:10,940 --> 06:20:11,360
Oh!

8967
06:20:12,040 --> 06:20:12,460
Oh!

8968
06:20:12,760 --> 06:20:13,180
Scary.

8969
06:20:17,600 --> 06:20:18,200
Oh, wait.

8970
06:20:18,380 --> 06:20:20,600
Actually, I can put them to sleep.

8971
06:20:30,580 --> 06:20:31,000
Oh!

8972
06:20:31,260 --> 06:20:32,560
Why is the music so scary?

8973
06:20:35,320 --> 06:20:35,740
Wait.

8974
06:20:35,780 --> 06:20:36,660
Why is the music so scary?

8975
06:20:37,180 --> 06:20:37,600
Oh!

8976
06:20:43,000 --> 06:20:43,620
I'm scared.

8977
06:20:46,220 --> 06:20:47,400
Why is it so scary?

8978
06:20:49,580 --> 06:20:49,980
Ah!

8979
06:20:51,160 --> 06:20:53,260
Good to know that there's some ammo there, though.

8980
06:20:55,820 --> 06:20:56,220
Oh!

8981
06:20:56,260 --> 06:20:56,660
Oh!

8982
06:20:56,720 --> 06:20:57,080
Oh!

8983
06:20:57,120 --> 06:20:57,420
Wait.

8984
06:20:57,540 --> 06:20:58,080
Where is he coming from?

8985
06:20:59,400 --> 06:20:59,800
Dog!

8986
06:21:00,420 --> 06:21:00,820
Wait.

8987
06:21:00,920 --> 06:21:01,520
Where did...

8988
06:21:01,520 --> 06:21:02,320
Where am I coming from?

8989
06:21:03,740 --> 06:21:04,900
I'm lost already.

8990
06:21:05,060 --> 06:21:05,220
Okay.

8991
06:21:06,740 --> 06:21:07,140
This...

8992
06:21:07,140 --> 06:21:07,640
Wait.

8993
06:21:07,700 --> 06:21:08,920
That's where we crawled out from, right?

8994
06:21:09,100 --> 06:21:09,500
Okay.

8995
06:21:09,540 --> 06:21:09,940
Okay.

8996
06:21:09,980 --> 06:21:10,380
Okay.

8997
06:21:11,120 --> 06:21:11,520
Okay.

8998
06:21:18,290 --> 06:21:19,550
Can he pee on my box?

8999
06:21:25,180 --> 06:21:26,060
Pee on my box?

9000
06:21:29,700 --> 06:21:30,860
Pee on my box?

9001
06:21:34,300 --> 06:21:35,140
Pee on my box.

9002
06:21:35,260 --> 06:21:35,440
Oh!

9003
06:21:35,520 --> 06:21:35,880
Oh!

9004
06:21:35,920 --> 06:21:36,100
Oh!

9005
06:21:36,100 --> 06:21:36,220
Oh!

9006
06:21:36,220 --> 06:21:36,400
Nice!

9007
06:21:36,540 --> 06:21:36,680
Nice!

9008
06:21:36,720 --> 06:21:36,840
Nice!

9009
06:21:38,960 --> 06:21:39,940
Pee on my box.

9010
06:21:41,200 --> 06:21:41,560
Wait.

9011
06:21:41,640 --> 06:21:42,340
It's never in the ground floor.

9012
06:21:47,860 --> 06:21:51,700
I need him to pee on my box so that we can get past the dogs easily.

9013
06:21:52,380 --> 06:21:52,740
Go!

9014
06:22:16,480 --> 06:22:18,200
Oh yeah, I have to punch her.

9015
06:22:18,300 --> 06:22:18,740
That's right.

9016
06:22:19,480 --> 06:22:21,100
We punch her and then hide.

9017
06:22:21,820 --> 06:22:24,420
And then... wait, which way is it?

9018
06:22:30,760 --> 06:22:31,840
I can't tell.

9019
06:22:32,060 --> 06:22:32,720
You know what, let's just go.

9020
06:22:33,220 --> 06:22:33,880
They're here.

9021
06:22:35,160 --> 06:22:36,500
Is this the correct spot?

9022
06:22:38,200 --> 06:22:39,080
Uh... maybe.

9023
06:22:44,500 --> 06:22:45,060
What's this?

9024
06:22:45,600 --> 06:22:46,780
Oh, this is Azimim.

9025
06:22:50,080 --> 06:22:50,520
Nice.

9026
06:22:51,820 --> 06:22:53,040
Wait, is this a hole?

9027
06:22:53,760 --> 06:22:55,160
It's so hard to tell.

9028
06:22:55,480 --> 06:22:58,680
Oh gosh, even in the original, I can never remember.

9029
06:22:59,620 --> 06:23:00,240
Oh no.

9030
06:23:00,580 --> 06:23:01,240
Okay, hold on.

9031
06:23:05,750 --> 06:23:07,550
Wait, this one, this one, this one.

9032
06:23:08,150 --> 06:23:08,590
Right?

9033
06:23:12,860 --> 06:23:13,900
A little...

9034
06:23:15,040 --> 06:23:15,560
Yeah.

9035
06:23:20,300 --> 06:23:21,180
There she is.

9036
06:23:21,520 --> 06:23:22,400
And the dog.

9037
06:23:23,220 --> 06:23:24,140
The baby dog.

9038
06:23:24,500 --> 06:23:25,440
Oh, he likes...

9039
06:23:28,600 --> 06:23:30,420
Why do they all like her?

9040
06:23:31,780 --> 06:23:33,120
It's cause she's so cute.

9041
06:23:34,700 --> 06:23:35,920
Okay, so we gotta hit her.

9042
06:23:40,160 --> 06:23:40,680
Hide!

9043
06:23:45,800 --> 06:23:46,600
I think I'm in trouble.

9044
06:23:49,480 --> 06:23:50,460
There's a whole cutscene.

9045
06:23:53,800 --> 06:23:54,900
Well, that didn't go as planned.

9046
06:23:55,620 --> 06:23:56,340
Too slow?

9047
06:23:58,920 --> 06:23:59,480
Oh yeah.

9048
06:24:01,000 --> 06:24:01,360
Okay.

9049
06:24:01,360 --> 06:24:02,000
One more try.

9050
06:24:02,100 --> 06:24:02,420
One more try.

9051
06:24:02,720 --> 06:24:03,440
I had it.

9052
06:24:03,460 --> 06:24:03,940
I had it.

9053
06:24:03,940 --> 06:24:04,500
What are you thinking?

9054
06:24:04,920 --> 06:24:05,280
I had it.

9055
06:24:05,320 --> 06:24:05,720
I had it.

9056
06:24:05,720 --> 06:24:06,140
I had it.

9057
06:24:06,680 --> 06:24:07,660
You gotta get distant.

9058
06:24:10,380 --> 06:24:10,740
Oh.

9059
06:24:14,400 --> 06:24:15,620
What are you doing?

9060
06:24:16,000 --> 06:24:16,360
Stop.

9061
06:24:16,440 --> 06:24:17,440
Hold on, Meryl.

9062
06:24:20,380 --> 06:24:20,940
Ah!

9063
06:24:28,220 --> 06:24:29,680
Now they won't attack me.

9064
06:24:32,160 --> 06:24:32,720
Yay!

9065
06:24:33,280 --> 06:24:34,360
What are you doing?

9066
06:24:34,580 --> 06:24:34,800
Okay.

9067
06:24:34,880 --> 06:24:35,860
Come on, Meryl.

9068
06:24:35,860 --> 06:24:36,660
Let's get you...

9069
06:24:36,660 --> 06:24:37,440
Oh, sorry.

9070
06:24:38,920 --> 06:24:40,640
Let's get you in trouble.

9071
06:24:42,980 --> 06:24:44,340
You're so cute.

9072
06:24:46,340 --> 06:24:48,000
I wish I could pet the dog.

9073
06:24:49,480 --> 06:24:50,920
Look how cute it is.

9074
06:24:51,520 --> 06:24:52,480
Oh my god.

9075
06:24:52,500 --> 06:24:53,360
He's so cute.

9076
06:24:53,820 --> 06:24:54,340
Look at him.

9077
06:24:54,360 --> 06:24:55,120
He looks so happy.

9078
06:24:56,040 --> 06:24:57,280
Oh my gosh.

9079
06:24:57,280 --> 06:24:57,840
So cute.

9080
06:24:58,140 --> 06:24:58,380
All right.

9081
06:24:58,380 --> 06:24:58,620
Let's go.

9082
06:25:07,490 --> 06:25:07,970
Okay.

9083
06:25:08,370 --> 06:25:09,590
This place is mined.

9084
06:25:09,830 --> 06:25:10,930
I'll take point again.

9085
06:25:11,110 --> 06:25:12,090
Stay back, okay?

9086
06:25:12,350 --> 06:25:12,790
Okay.

9087
06:25:13,490 --> 06:25:15,050
But the radar isn't working.

9088
06:25:15,250 --> 06:25:17,250
And since we can't use the mine detector either...

9089
06:25:17,970 --> 06:25:18,450
No.

9090
06:25:19,630 --> 06:25:20,590
Psycho Mantis.

9091
06:25:20,990 --> 06:25:21,890
Leave it to me.

9092
06:25:24,410 --> 06:25:24,930
Okay.

9093
06:25:51,070 --> 06:25:52,530
So what do you think?

9094
06:25:52,710 --> 06:25:53,490
Pretty good, huh?

9095
06:25:53,750 --> 06:25:55,310
How did you know where the mines were?

9096
06:25:55,730 --> 06:25:58,950
It sounds weird, but when Mantis dove into my mind...

9097
06:25:58,950 --> 06:26:01,150
I was able to see where the mines were placed.

9098
06:26:01,430 --> 06:26:02,370
Are you impressed?

9099
06:26:02,990 --> 06:26:04,770
Well, a little bit.

9100
06:26:04,790 --> 06:26:05,310
Ew!

9101
06:26:05,490 --> 06:26:06,150
Only a little?

9102
06:26:14,530 --> 06:26:15,690
Are you impre...

9103
06:26:16,530 --> 06:26:17,050
It...

9104
06:26:17,050 --> 06:26:17,130
I...

9105
06:26:22,250 --> 06:26:23,670
You know what?

9106
06:26:24,350 --> 06:26:25,790
It was worth that.

9107
06:26:32,190 --> 06:26:34,390
It was worth that.

9108
06:26:34,490 --> 06:26:35,310
I think.

9109
06:26:36,110 --> 06:26:37,110
Quite honestly.

9110
06:26:46,090 --> 06:26:46,730
Anyway...

9111
06:26:47,590 --> 06:26:48,510
Here I come.

9112
06:26:49,390 --> 06:26:50,090
Here I come.

9113
06:26:53,920 --> 06:26:54,560
Here I come.

9114
06:26:54,560 --> 06:26:54,740
I'm done.

9115
06:26:55,220 --> 06:26:59,340
Why are we once again standing in the middle of the way?

9116
06:26:59,740 --> 06:27:02,020
Why do we never learn our lesson?

9117
06:27:02,580 --> 06:27:03,080
Why?

9118
06:27:03,300 --> 06:27:03,840
Oh my god.

9119
06:27:03,880 --> 06:27:04,740
Why are you turning around?

9120
06:27:05,340 --> 06:27:05,840
No!

9121
06:27:06,780 --> 06:27:07,560
Oh my gosh.

9122
06:27:07,720 --> 06:27:08,220
Merrill.

9123
06:27:08,340 --> 06:27:08,840
Merrill.

9124
06:27:08,900 --> 06:27:09,360
Merrill?

9125
06:27:09,940 --> 06:27:10,440
Merrill!

9126
06:27:11,860 --> 06:27:13,520
Merrill, don't you know what that is?

9127
06:27:16,060 --> 06:27:18,320
Why are you guys just standing there?

9128
06:27:21,240 --> 06:27:22,400
Oh, she's actually...

9129
06:27:24,080 --> 06:27:25,940
She purposefully aimed for the leg.

9130
06:27:31,120 --> 06:27:33,260
Oh my god.

9131
06:27:39,960 --> 06:27:41,840
Like, I know she wasn't trying to kill her.

9132
06:27:41,940 --> 06:27:42,420
Oh my god.

9133
06:27:42,500 --> 06:27:43,000
Sniper.

9134
06:27:44,280 --> 06:27:45,720
She's just getting every limb.

9135
06:27:45,920 --> 06:27:46,240
Dang.

9136
06:27:47,120 --> 06:27:48,160
Oh my gosh.

9137
06:27:52,880 --> 06:27:53,400
Sniper.

9138
06:27:53,400 --> 06:27:53,660
Why?

9139
06:27:54,460 --> 06:27:54,980
Why?

9140
06:27:55,440 --> 06:27:55,780
Why?

9141
06:28:00,790 --> 06:28:01,310
Why?

9142
06:28:01,390 --> 06:28:01,910
Why?

9143
06:28:01,910 --> 06:28:02,070
Why?

9144
06:28:02,130 --> 06:28:02,990
Oh my gosh.

9145
06:28:05,390 --> 06:28:05,910
Merrill.

9146
06:28:05,910 --> 06:28:09,690
Snake, leave me and run.

9147
06:28:10,750 --> 06:28:11,270
Merrill.

9148
06:28:11,430 --> 06:28:11,950
Merrill.

9149
06:28:13,830 --> 06:28:16,090
I guess I'm a rookie after all.

9150
06:28:16,210 --> 06:28:17,490
Oh, both of you are.

9151
06:28:17,530 --> 06:28:19,050
For standing in the middle of the way.

9152
06:28:21,670 --> 06:28:22,710
Her leg.

9153
06:28:22,870 --> 06:28:24,370
It's the oldest trick in the book.

9154
06:28:24,890 --> 06:28:29,610
You guys, this is actually the last time we will see Merrill.

9155
06:28:29,810 --> 06:28:31,810
Sniper's using me for bait to lure you out.

9156
06:28:31,850 --> 06:28:32,110
Oh my gosh.

9157
06:28:32,130 --> 06:28:35,330
This is the last time we will see Merrill.

9158
06:28:37,050 --> 06:28:38,410
Shoot me, Snake.

9159
06:28:38,770 --> 06:28:39,330
No.

9160
06:28:42,910 --> 06:28:43,890
My gun.

9161
06:28:45,350 --> 06:28:47,650
I can't reach it by myself.

9162
06:28:47,650 --> 06:28:50,730
Since we're going for the Otacon exit ending.

9163
06:28:51,170 --> 06:28:54,490
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.

9164
06:28:55,790 --> 06:28:56,430
I...

9165
06:28:56,430 --> 06:28:58,510
I can still help.

9166
06:28:58,570 --> 06:29:00,030
It's actually her...

9167
06:29:00,030 --> 06:29:00,830
I wanna help you.

9168
06:29:00,890 --> 06:29:02,110
This is actually her death.

9169
06:29:02,210 --> 06:29:03,010
It's so sad.

9170
06:29:03,070 --> 06:29:03,230
Why down?

9171
06:29:03,230 --> 06:29:03,570
Save your strength.

9172
06:29:03,630 --> 06:29:03,670
Why down?

9173
06:29:03,690 --> 06:29:04,930
It's actually so sad.

9174
06:29:05,490 --> 06:29:06,650
Bye, Merrill.

9175
06:29:06,870 --> 06:29:07,650
I was a fool.

9176
06:29:08,030 --> 06:29:10,610
I wanted to be a soldier.

9177
06:29:10,730 --> 06:29:11,430
I'm sorry.

9178
06:29:12,950 --> 06:29:14,330
I'm sorry, Merrill.

9179
06:29:16,670 --> 06:29:18,390
War is meaningless.

9180
06:29:19,570 --> 06:29:21,270
Nothing comes out of war.

9181
06:29:24,190 --> 06:29:25,310
Snake, please.

9182
06:29:25,610 --> 06:29:25,950
Ew.

9183
06:29:26,070 --> 06:29:26,570
Save your strength...

9184
06:29:26,570 --> 06:29:27,310
It's so like...

9185
06:29:27,310 --> 06:29:29,550
It's sad watching her trying to reach for her gun.

9186
06:29:29,810 --> 06:29:30,750
Don't give up on people.

9187
06:29:30,750 --> 06:29:31,230
So sad.

9188
06:29:33,110 --> 06:29:33,670
Please, help me.

9189
06:29:39,420 --> 06:29:41,900
She's being so dramatic despite dying.

9190
06:29:42,700 --> 06:29:44,560
Gosh, why are you gonna be so dramatic, Meryl?

9191
06:29:56,530 --> 06:29:58,650
I love that scene in the original.

9192
06:30:03,090 --> 06:30:04,610
Who just said Colonel?

9193
06:30:08,030 --> 06:30:09,510
Who just said that?

9194
06:30:11,110 --> 06:30:14,530
It must be Sniper Wolf, Foxhound's best shooter.

9195
06:30:14,950 --> 06:30:16,470
Sniper's usually work in pairs.

9196
06:30:16,730 --> 06:30:17,670
Who said Colonel?

9197
06:30:18,090 --> 06:30:19,030
I know her.

9198
06:30:19,250 --> 06:30:19,950
Naomi maybe.

9199
06:30:20,190 --> 06:30:21,770
She can wait for hours, days, or weeks.

9200
06:30:21,990 --> 06:30:23,970
It was a woman's voice.

9201
06:30:24,190 --> 06:30:26,730
She's just watching and waiting for you to expose yourself.

9202
06:30:26,750 --> 06:30:27,390
It's not Snake.

9203
06:30:27,570 --> 06:30:30,090
Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long.

9204
06:30:30,470 --> 06:30:33,070
Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are?

9205
06:30:33,350 --> 06:30:35,570
There's nowhere to hide between here and the tower.

9206
06:30:35,830 --> 06:30:37,910
She must be on the second floor of the tower.

9207
06:30:38,450 --> 06:30:38,930
Tower.

9208
06:30:38,930 --> 06:30:39,410
Tower.

9209
06:30:41,030 --> 06:30:41,510
Perfectly.

9210
06:30:41,510 --> 06:30:43,310
It's the classic sniper's position.

9211
06:30:43,410 --> 06:30:43,890
Classic.

9212
06:30:43,970 --> 06:30:46,810
At that distance, you won't be able to hit her with a standard weapon either.

9213
06:30:47,030 --> 06:30:48,350
You'll need a sniper rifle.

9214
06:30:48,590 --> 06:30:49,230
The penis gene.

9215
06:30:49,610 --> 06:30:50,310
Take it easy.

9216
06:30:52,370 --> 06:30:55,270
I'm going to save Meryl, no matter what it takes.

9217
06:30:55,910 --> 06:30:56,390
Okay.

9218
06:30:57,330 --> 06:30:57,810
Thanks.

9219
06:30:59,990 --> 06:31:00,970
What's wrong, Naomi?

9220
06:31:01,390 --> 06:31:02,170
Don't you know?

9221
06:31:02,830 --> 06:31:05,750
There's a tendency toward murder written in your very genes.

9222
06:31:06,150 --> 06:31:09,050
So saving someone else's skin is out of the question.

9223
06:31:09,050 --> 06:31:10,050
Why are you gotta bring that up again?

9224
06:31:10,050 --> 06:31:10,890
I don't know that far, but...

9225
06:31:10,890 --> 06:31:13,430
I don't know what the hell my genes look like, and I don't care.

9226
06:31:13,610 --> 06:31:14,090
I operate on instinct.

9227
06:31:14,090 --> 06:31:15,370
You hate me so much, Naomi.

9228
06:31:15,610 --> 06:31:16,330
Like an animal?

9229
06:31:16,510 --> 06:31:17,310
Like an animal.

9230
06:31:17,310 --> 06:31:18,550
I'm going to save Meryl.

9231
06:31:18,650 --> 06:31:20,110
I don't need an excuse.

9232
06:31:20,610 --> 06:31:21,090
Okay.

9233
06:31:21,350 --> 06:31:23,390
And I'm not doing it for someone else either.

9234
06:31:23,630 --> 06:31:25,330
I'm going to save Meryl for myself.

9235
06:31:25,610 --> 06:31:27,410
Colonel, don't worry.

9236
06:31:27,930 --> 06:31:28,410
Snake.

9237
06:31:29,010 --> 06:31:29,490
Thanks.

9238
06:31:29,930 --> 06:31:30,750
I understand.

9239
06:31:31,170 --> 06:31:32,350
Don't thank me yet.

9240
06:31:32,370 --> 06:31:32,430
I'm sorry.

9241
06:31:33,770 --> 06:31:35,150
Don't thank me yet, Colonel.

9242
06:31:35,670 --> 06:31:37,530
You have no reason to thank me.

9243
06:31:54,170 --> 06:32:01,210
I love that scene in the original where like the codec is just like going off over and over again.

9244
06:32:01,270 --> 06:32:04,710
And Snake is just sitting there like, oh my God, what do I do?

9245
06:32:04,750 --> 06:32:05,170
What do I do?

9246
06:32:05,230 --> 06:32:05,590
What do I do?

9247
06:32:05,590 --> 06:32:06,250
Like he's just...

9248
06:32:06,250 --> 06:32:06,910
He's not moving.

9249
06:32:06,990 --> 06:32:07,870
He's just like thinking.

9250
06:32:08,630 --> 06:32:09,070
Wait,

9251
06:32:18,500 --> 06:32:19,160
don't you like...

9252
06:32:19,160 --> 06:32:19,640
Oh.

9253
06:32:20,280 --> 06:32:20,720
Who...

9254
06:32:20,720 --> 06:32:21,580
Who caught me then?

9255
06:32:24,200 --> 06:32:25,140
Oh my gosh.

9256
06:32:25,600 --> 06:32:28,340
You are freaking me out, little pup.

9257
06:32:28,900 --> 06:32:29,340
Please.

9258
06:32:30,960 --> 06:32:31,740
Thank you.

9259
06:32:31,780 --> 06:32:32,140
Thank you.

9260
06:32:41,030 --> 06:32:44,470
Those dogs after getting a whiff of newly scented box on Snake.

9261
06:32:46,830 --> 06:32:47,650
Time to leave.

9262
06:33:07,820 --> 06:33:08,680
We're good now.

9263
06:33:10,820 --> 06:33:11,780
Everything's fine now.

9264
06:33:12,000 --> 06:33:13,460
Oh, Famas.

9265
06:33:13,480 --> 06:33:13,840
Very nice.

9266
06:33:14,700 --> 06:33:15,920
Can I always use more of that?

9267
06:33:16,200 --> 06:33:17,140
This is the PSG.

9268
06:33:17,260 --> 06:33:17,380
Okay.

9269
06:33:20,440 --> 06:33:21,380
Is that an exit?

9270
06:33:22,700 --> 06:33:23,220
Right there?

9271
06:33:24,760 --> 06:33:25,520
What is...

9272
06:33:26,100 --> 06:33:26,480
Nothing.

9273
06:33:26,620 --> 06:33:27,560
Oh, I guess there's nothing here.

9274
06:33:31,280 --> 06:33:31,660
Okay.

9275
06:33:31,980 --> 06:33:32,360
Go.

9276
06:33:34,720 --> 06:33:35,100
Go.

9277
06:33:35,160 --> 06:33:35,500
Crawl.

9278
06:33:35,500 --> 06:33:35,740
Crawl.

9279
06:33:35,760 --> 06:33:35,940
Stay.

9280
06:33:36,040 --> 06:33:36,400
Crawl.

9281
06:33:40,160 --> 06:33:40,540
Okay.

9282
06:33:40,800 --> 06:33:41,180
Nice.

9283
06:33:41,240 --> 06:33:41,480
See?

9284
06:33:41,920 --> 06:33:42,300
See?

9285
06:33:42,700 --> 06:33:43,820
That's why the box was there.

9286
06:33:43,820 --> 06:33:44,540
That's why the box was important, everybody.

9287
06:33:47,720 --> 06:33:49,660
That's why the box was so important.

9288
06:33:51,340 --> 06:33:53,200
Dogs just running around in circles.

9289
06:33:55,400 --> 06:33:55,920
Okay.

9290
06:33:56,780 --> 06:33:57,300
Okay.

9291
06:33:58,700 --> 06:34:02,060
We have to go all the way back to the...

9292
06:34:02,060 --> 06:34:03,060
Oh my goodness.

9293
06:34:03,240 --> 06:34:04,820
I can't find where the door is.

9294
06:34:04,980 --> 06:34:07,060
I have to go all the way back to the...

9295
06:34:08,340 --> 06:34:09,720
To the armory?

9296
06:34:10,720 --> 06:34:12,780
But we will do that next time.

9297
06:34:13,280 --> 06:34:13,800
Okay.

9298
06:34:16,380 --> 06:34:17,920
Even though I want to keep playing.

9299
06:34:18,120 --> 06:34:21,860
We will do that next time.

9300
06:34:22,020 --> 06:34:24,060
It's rumbling in my ears again.

9301
06:34:24,340 --> 06:34:25,240
What is this thing?

9302
06:34:25,300 --> 06:34:25,820
Is that a phone?

9303
06:34:33,260 --> 06:34:34,540
Ooh, it's freaky.

9304
06:34:36,600 --> 06:34:37,040
Wait.

9305
06:34:38,600 --> 06:34:40,160
Oh, the mirror's all broken, too.

9306
06:34:40,280 --> 06:34:41,320
He doesn't like to see himself.

9307
06:34:44,400 --> 06:34:46,240
What the heck is this thing?

9308
06:34:46,900 --> 06:34:48,000
I was wondering that before.

9309
06:34:48,400 --> 06:34:49,380
Is this in the...

9310
06:34:49,380 --> 06:34:51,480
Oh, that's the communications tower, isn't it?

9311
06:34:53,620 --> 06:34:55,960
We fight the hindie up there, right?

9312
06:34:57,080 --> 06:34:58,520
Oh, that's kind of funny.

9313
06:35:02,620 --> 06:35:03,520
Oh, fun!

9314
06:35:06,320 --> 06:35:07,540
Interesting, interesting.

9315
06:35:10,740 --> 06:35:13,280
Are those the giant staircases you climb?

9316
06:35:14,200 --> 06:35:14,780
Yes.

9317
06:35:14,880 --> 06:35:17,020
And I think we have...

9318
06:35:17,020 --> 06:35:18,040
Oh, wait.

9319
06:35:18,760 --> 06:35:20,700
We have 14 chaff grenades!

9320
06:35:21,420 --> 06:35:22,560
We're doing well.

9321
06:35:23,160 --> 06:35:24,380
We're doing alright.

9322
06:35:25,120 --> 06:35:26,540
Wait, are there any...

9323
06:35:26,540 --> 06:35:28,120
Are we still alone in here?

9324
06:35:28,300 --> 06:35:28,680
Oh.

9325
06:35:30,020 --> 06:35:30,880
No, we're not.

9326
06:35:31,020 --> 06:35:31,360
Okay.

9327
06:35:32,380 --> 06:35:33,340
Gonna go here.

9328
06:35:35,700 --> 06:35:36,440
Okay, yeah.

9329
06:35:36,540 --> 06:35:37,580
We're gonna go back inside.

9330
06:35:37,680 --> 06:35:38,380
I'm gonna save.

9331
06:35:43,960 --> 06:35:45,180
Save, save, save.

9332
06:35:46,440 --> 06:35:48,640
And yeah, we'll finish it off here.

9333
06:35:50,400 --> 06:35:51,160
You called, Snake?

9334
06:35:51,460 --> 06:35:51,880
Yep.

9335
06:35:58,850 --> 06:35:59,450
Nice.

9336
06:36:00,770 --> 06:36:01,650
Save complete.

9337
06:36:03,750 --> 06:36:08,050
The Chinese say it is the strong swimmer who most often drowns.

9338
06:36:08,070 --> 06:36:13,430
It's because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.

9339
06:36:13,630 --> 06:36:17,030
You're probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.

9340
06:36:17,350 --> 06:36:18,550
No, I'm not careless.

9341
06:36:18,650 --> 06:36:19,870
I'm very careful.

9342
06:36:21,430 --> 06:36:23,210
Do you remember what day tomorrow is?

9343
06:36:24,770 --> 06:36:34,570
You know, I thought about maybe if I finish this next week, maybe doing like playing Metal Gear Solid like Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

9344
06:36:35,990 --> 06:36:36,950
Or, I don't know.

9345
06:36:37,030 --> 06:36:38,170
I don't know how long it would take me.

9346
06:36:38,250 --> 06:36:40,190
Maybe even like Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

9347
06:36:41,070 --> 06:36:43,810
Of like the 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th.

9348
06:36:45,870 --> 06:36:46,670
So, maybe.

9349
06:36:47,250 --> 06:36:48,030
Because I knew...

9350
06:36:48,030 --> 06:36:49,850
The other day I was just like, oh my gosh, it's A!

9351
06:36:49,850 --> 06:36:50,030
April!

9352
06:36:51,070 --> 06:36:53,250
I can do April 30th!

9353
06:36:53,710 --> 06:36:54,150
So...

9354
06:36:55,010 --> 06:36:56,450
The OG, of course.

9355
06:36:56,610 --> 06:36:58,230
I mean...

9356
06:36:58,730 --> 06:37:00,230
Well, actually it would probably be the Master Collection.

9357
06:37:02,270 --> 06:37:02,710
Or...

9358
06:37:02,710 --> 06:37:03,890
I already...

9359
06:37:03,890 --> 06:37:06,450
I've done the HD Collection.

9360
06:37:06,790 --> 06:37:07,930
Probably will be the Master Collection.

9361
06:37:08,890 --> 06:37:09,330
But...

9362
06:37:10,850 --> 06:37:12,610
Depends on how...

9363
06:37:13,610 --> 06:37:14,050
How...

9364
06:37:14,050 --> 06:37:14,790
I don't know.

9365
06:37:14,870 --> 06:37:16,210
I don't know if I would need four days.

9366
06:37:16,310 --> 06:37:18,810
I guess it depends on how much I play each day, right?

9367
06:37:18,810 --> 06:37:20,210
And how well I do.

9368
06:37:22,430 --> 06:37:22,850
But...

9369
06:37:23,270 --> 06:37:24,290
I think I'll...

9370
06:37:24,290 --> 06:37:24,990
I don't know.

9371
06:37:25,050 --> 06:37:25,750
We might do it.

9372
06:37:25,810 --> 06:37:26,070
Who knows?

9373
06:37:31,410 --> 06:37:33,410
The Master Collection kinda poopy.

9374
06:37:33,450 --> 06:37:34,350
No, they fixed it!

9375
06:37:34,610 --> 06:37:36,910
They have done a lot of patches.

9376
06:37:37,170 --> 06:37:37,790
I think it's...

9377
06:37:37,790 --> 06:37:38,590
Most...

9378
06:37:38,590 --> 06:37:39,110
I think it's...

9379
06:37:39,110 --> 06:37:41,650
I think it's like pretty much up to speed now.

9380
06:37:41,750 --> 06:37:42,810
From what I understand.

9381
06:37:44,630 --> 06:37:47,070
Like they've done a lot of patches on it.

9382
06:37:47,150 --> 06:37:47,550
So...

9383
06:37:48,510 --> 06:37:48,950
Um...

9384
06:37:51,050 --> 06:37:51,850
Updates are great.

9385
06:37:51,910 --> 06:37:52,130
Yeah.

9386
06:37:52,290 --> 06:37:52,730
Yeah.

9387
06:37:52,790 --> 06:37:53,490
They've done a bunch.

9388
06:37:53,730 --> 06:37:54,810
That was a good run, Mint.

9389
06:37:54,850 --> 06:37:55,350
Thank you!

9390
06:37:55,990 --> 06:37:57,170
Andregos, thanks for the tan gift!

9391
06:37:57,190 --> 06:37:57,690
And thank you!

9392
06:37:59,130 --> 06:38:01,090
I do wanna keep playing, but...

9393
06:38:02,610 --> 06:38:03,050
Um...

9394
06:38:03,050 --> 06:38:03,630
I...

9395
06:38:03,630 --> 06:38:06,010
I'm still not sure about a stream tomorrow.

9396
06:38:06,570 --> 06:38:07,010
Actually...

9397
06:38:07,010 --> 06:38:07,690
Um...

9398
06:38:07,690 --> 06:38:09,370
There's actually something I kinda wanna play.

9399
06:38:09,630 --> 06:38:10,890
There was a new...

9400
06:38:10,890 --> 06:38:11,530
Um...

9401
06:38:11,530 --> 06:38:13,410
Hollow Indie game that came out.

9402
06:38:13,510 --> 06:38:14,150
Like the...

9403
06:38:14,150 --> 06:38:15,730
Wow Wow Korone...

9404
06:38:16,890 --> 06:38:17,330
Korone...

9405
06:38:17,330 --> 06:38:17,530
Korone...

9406
06:38:17,550 --> 06:38:17,890
Box?

9407
06:38:18,430 --> 06:38:18,950
Uh...

9408
06:38:18,950 --> 06:38:19,230
Hold on.

9409
06:38:19,310 --> 06:38:19,930
What is it called?

9410
06:38:20,530 --> 06:38:20,910
Ko...

9411
06:38:20,910 --> 06:38:21,330
Ko...

9412
06:38:21,330 --> 06:38:22,330
Korone...

9413
06:38:23,370 --> 06:38:23,890
Korone...

9414
06:38:23,890 --> 06:38:24,110
Yeah!

9415
06:38:24,170 --> 06:38:24,350
Yeah!

9416
06:38:24,370 --> 06:38:26,390
The Wow Wow Wow Korone Box!

9417
06:38:26,650 --> 06:38:28,210
I was thinking of playing that tomorrow.

9418
06:38:28,490 --> 06:38:29,010
So...

9419
06:38:29,010 --> 06:38:29,890
Um...

9420
06:38:31,310 --> 06:38:33,010
Since I didn't have a game planned or anything.

9421
06:38:34,390 --> 06:38:34,910
Um...

9422
06:38:35,550 --> 06:38:35,910
So...

9423
06:38:35,910 --> 06:38:37,370
Not sure what time yet.

9424
06:38:37,450 --> 06:38:37,970
Uh...

9425
06:38:37,970 --> 06:38:41,050
Might start actually around the same time as today's stream.

9426
06:38:41,950 --> 06:38:42,470
So...

9427
06:38:42,470 --> 06:38:43,430
Yeah!

9428
06:38:43,750 --> 06:38:44,270
Yeah!

9429
06:38:44,350 --> 06:38:44,610
Yeah!

9430
06:38:44,610 --> 06:38:44,810
Yeah!

9431
06:38:44,810 --> 06:38:45,810
And uh...

9432
06:38:46,370 --> 06:38:48,050
But it looks really fine and really cute.

9433
06:38:48,310 --> 06:38:50,070
So I wanted to try it out.

9434
06:38:50,250 --> 06:38:51,390
And I love Korone-san.

9435
06:38:51,610 --> 06:38:51,990
So...

9436
06:38:51,990 --> 06:38:52,870
Mm-hmm!

9437
06:38:53,330 --> 06:38:54,250
I haven't seen it yet.

9438
06:38:54,350 --> 06:38:54,730
So...

9439
06:38:55,310 --> 06:38:55,690
Uh...

9440
06:38:55,690 --> 06:38:56,410
That'd be good to see.

9441
06:38:56,470 --> 06:38:56,690
Yeah!

9442
06:38:56,810 --> 06:38:57,110
Yeah!

9443
06:38:57,150 --> 06:38:57,990
I wanna try it.

9444
06:38:58,070 --> 06:38:59,110
It looks so fine.

9445
06:39:00,550 --> 06:39:00,930
Um...

9446
06:39:01,910 --> 06:39:02,670
And uh...

9447
06:39:03,090 --> 06:39:03,470
Yeah!

9448
06:39:05,810 --> 06:39:06,190
Um...

9449
06:39:07,450 --> 06:39:07,830
Mythanar!

9450
06:39:07,950 --> 06:39:08,810
Thank you for the tan!

9451
06:39:09,590 --> 06:39:09,970
Gifted!

9452
06:39:10,230 --> 06:39:10,970
Thank you!

9453
06:39:11,130 --> 06:39:11,610
Thank you!

9454
06:39:11,650 --> 06:39:11,830
Thank you!

9455
06:39:11,830 --> 06:39:12,250
Thank you!

9456
06:39:12,270 --> 06:39:12,350
Thank you!

9457
06:39:13,210 --> 06:39:14,730
I saw that she got a new outfit.

9458
06:39:14,810 --> 06:39:15,730
It's so...

9459
06:39:15,730 --> 06:39:17,370
It's not what I expected.

9460
06:39:17,670 --> 06:39:17,850
Like...

9461
06:39:17,850 --> 06:39:18,590
Like...

9462
06:39:18,590 --> 06:39:19,050
It's so...

9463
06:39:19,050 --> 06:39:19,670
It's so cool!

9464
06:39:19,950 --> 06:39:20,530
The...

9465
06:39:20,530 --> 06:39:20,890
The...

9466
06:39:20,890 --> 06:39:21,870
The Viking...

9467
06:39:21,870 --> 06:39:23,190
Viking style.

9468
06:39:23,710 --> 06:39:24,530
It's so...

9469
06:39:24,530 --> 06:39:25,230
I like her...

9470
06:39:25,230 --> 06:39:26,270
How messy and like...

9471
06:39:26,270 --> 06:39:27,730
Shaggy her hair is.

9472
06:39:27,810 --> 06:39:28,430
It's really cute.

9473
06:39:30,190 --> 06:39:31,230
So yeah...

9474
06:39:31,690 --> 06:39:32,610
It's so her too.

9475
06:39:32,930 --> 06:39:33,530
Yeah!

9476
06:39:34,690 --> 06:39:36,590
The Vinland Saga fit.

9477
06:39:38,030 --> 06:39:39,030
Her new song?

9478
06:39:39,230 --> 06:39:39,430
Oh wait!

9479
06:39:40,070 --> 06:39:40,990
I don't...

9480
06:39:40,990 --> 06:39:41,690
I don't...

9481
06:39:41,690 --> 06:39:42,250
I don't...

9482
06:39:42,250 --> 06:39:43,870
I don't know if I heard her new song.

9483
06:39:45,370 --> 06:39:46,970
I'm not going to listen to it here...

9484
06:39:46,970 --> 06:39:47,290
But...

9485
06:39:48,990 --> 06:39:49,510
Coll...

9486
06:39:49,510 --> 06:39:50,290
Collon...

9487
06:39:50,290 --> 06:39:51,030
Collon...

9488
06:39:54,850 --> 06:39:55,370
Oh!

9489
06:39:55,450 --> 06:39:55,570
Oh!

9490
06:39:55,570 --> 06:39:56,430
Trouble Wan...

9491
06:39:56,430 --> 06:39:57,030
Wan!

9492
06:39:57,310 --> 06:39:58,130
That's so cute!

9493
06:39:59,710 --> 06:40:01,050
I will listen to it.

9494
06:40:02,790 --> 06:40:03,030
Um!

9495
06:40:03,170 --> 06:40:03,470
Um!

9496
06:40:03,510 --> 06:40:03,850
Um!

9497
06:40:04,110 --> 06:40:07,010
But yeah...

9498
06:40:07,010 --> 06:40:10,110
Glad we get to watch you play Twinsnakes at last.

9499
06:40:10,290 --> 06:40:11,050
Me too!

9500
06:40:11,490 --> 06:40:11,970
Oh my gosh!

9501
06:40:11,990 --> 06:40:12,970
The cutscenes...

9502
06:40:12,970 --> 06:40:13,950
Are killing me.

9503
06:40:14,050 --> 06:40:14,630
Each time...

9504
06:40:14,630 --> 06:40:15,590
They are so crazy!

9505
06:40:15,870 --> 06:40:16,610
It's so much fun!

9506
06:40:16,890 --> 06:40:17,410
Okay.

9507
06:40:17,410 --> 06:40:18,910
They're so, so, so fun.

9508
06:40:21,590 --> 06:40:23,570
They're so outlandish.

9509
06:40:23,590 --> 06:40:24,070
I love them.

9510
06:40:26,090 --> 06:40:26,870
For real.

9511
06:40:28,430 --> 06:40:29,270
Thank you, Maryland!

9512
06:40:30,670 --> 06:40:31,510
Thank you for the stream.

9513
06:40:31,530 --> 06:40:33,490
You can never have enough MGS.

9514
06:40:33,490 --> 06:40:35,670
Those laughing pictures from the Mantis fight will give...

9515
06:40:35,670 --> 06:40:37,070
Those are really creepy!

9516
06:40:37,250 --> 06:40:39,530
I did not expect that.

9517
06:40:41,070 --> 06:40:41,910
I did not.

9518
06:40:42,030 --> 06:40:43,390
It was freaky.

9519
06:40:43,510 --> 06:40:44,590
It was freaky, freaky.

9520
06:40:49,470 --> 06:40:52,250
Still so surreal seeing this game in HD.

9521
06:40:52,650 --> 06:40:53,290
It's cool.

9522
06:40:53,550 --> 06:40:54,650
It is very different.

9523
06:40:55,010 --> 06:40:57,250
You can't replace the original, but I'm glad it exists.

9524
06:40:57,370 --> 06:40:57,670
Me too!

9525
06:40:57,930 --> 06:40:58,690
I agree.

9526
06:41:00,790 --> 06:41:07,770
Obviously, I don't say this is a remake remake.

9527
06:41:08,210 --> 06:41:14,450
That's why I'm very interested in what MGS3 Delta will be like.

9528
06:41:15,130 --> 06:41:16,930
I don't think it'll... I mean, I don't know.

9529
06:41:17,410 --> 06:41:19,210
I don't think it'll be like this.

9530
06:41:19,410 --> 06:41:24,650
But, it seems like they're remaining true to the original.

9531
06:41:24,850 --> 06:41:27,110
So, I'm very curious.

9532
06:41:27,250 --> 06:41:29,110
Like, if it's just gonna be the same game.

9533
06:41:29,250 --> 06:41:34,050
But, maybe, hopefully with, like, better gameplay.

9534
06:41:34,230 --> 06:41:37,430
And just, like, the cutscenes all the same.

9535
06:41:37,490 --> 06:41:38,870
Just HD graphics.

9536
06:41:39,350 --> 06:41:41,310
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

9537
06:41:41,310 --> 06:41:42,090
Thank you!

9538
06:41:43,150 --> 06:41:44,330
Thank you so much!

9539
06:41:45,530 --> 06:41:46,470
I wouldn't...

9540
06:41:46,470 --> 06:41:48,670
I wouldn't really want it to be like this.

9541
06:41:48,990 --> 06:41:49,630
So...

9542
06:41:50,470 --> 06:41:52,610
But, we shall see.

9543
06:41:52,770 --> 06:41:53,470
I suppose.

9544
06:41:54,670 --> 06:41:55,970
We shall see.

9545
06:41:57,130 --> 06:41:58,230
This one...

9546
06:41:58,230 --> 06:41:58,970
It does...

9547
06:41:58,970 --> 06:42:00,910
The cutscenes do feel really weird.

9548
06:42:01,110 --> 06:42:01,750
Because...

9549
06:42:01,750 --> 06:42:04,030
Like, the tone is just completely different.

9550
06:42:04,390 --> 06:42:07,510
In the original, like, you can feel, like, this cold...

9551
06:42:08,250 --> 06:42:08,890
Holowness.

9552
06:42:08,990 --> 06:42:10,070
You know, like...

9553
06:42:10,070 --> 06:42:12,470
Because the audio is so...

9554
06:42:13,310 --> 06:42:15,130
Like, it's echoey.

9555
06:42:15,130 --> 06:42:16,110
And it's...

9556
06:42:16,110 --> 06:42:16,870
And...

9557
06:42:16,870 --> 06:42:19,210
It just feels, like, so different.

9558
06:42:19,270 --> 06:42:20,370
And, like...

9559
06:42:20,370 --> 06:42:22,090
So, each has a different energy.

9560
06:42:22,230 --> 06:42:23,670
Like, this one is so much more action.

9561
06:42:23,790 --> 06:42:24,270
And...

9562
06:42:24,270 --> 06:42:24,870
Crazy.

9563
06:42:26,070 --> 06:42:26,550
Outlandish.

9564
06:42:27,510 --> 06:42:27,990
But...

9565
06:42:27,990 --> 06:42:28,890
So, it's not...

9566
06:42:28,890 --> 06:42:29,470
I don't think I...

9567
06:42:29,470 --> 06:42:30,050
It's like...

9568
06:42:30,050 --> 06:42:31,010
I don't prefer this one.

9569
06:42:31,150 --> 06:42:31,510
But...

9570
06:42:31,510 --> 06:42:32,910
I also still love this one.

9571
06:42:33,090 --> 06:42:34,210
Because it's so funny.

9572
06:42:36,010 --> 06:42:37,070
Yeah, way di...

9573
06:42:37,070 --> 06:42:38,090
Different atmosphere.

9574
06:42:38,490 --> 06:42:38,790
Yeah!

9575
06:42:38,830 --> 06:42:40,690
And the music in the first one!

9576
06:42:41,930 --> 06:42:42,410
So...

9577
06:42:42,410 --> 06:42:43,790
It just hits so good.

9578
06:42:43,990 --> 06:42:44,610
Like, it just...

9579
06:42:44,610 --> 06:42:47,130
Even for me, when I was first playing it...

9580
06:42:47,130 --> 06:42:47,430
Like...

9581
06:42:47,430 --> 06:42:49,690
Obviously, I never played it as a kid.

9582
06:42:50,870 --> 06:42:53,750
I never even seen footage of it as a kid.

9583
06:42:53,850 --> 06:42:54,150
Like, I...

9584
06:42:54,150 --> 06:42:56,570
Never touched it until I first played it.

9585
06:42:57,490 --> 06:42:58,010
But...

9586
06:42:58,010 --> 06:43:00,090
Like, it still felt, like, nostalgic.

9587
06:43:00,830 --> 06:43:02,330
There's just something about it.

9588
06:43:03,270 --> 06:43:04,110
Then, I...

9589
06:43:04,110 --> 06:43:05,250
I did like, uh...

9590
06:43:05,250 --> 06:43:06,430
Psycho Mantis's...

9591
06:43:06,430 --> 06:43:07,050
Zzz...

9592
06:43:07,050 --> 06:43:07,450
Zzz...

9593
06:43:07,450 --> 06:43:07,570
Zzz...

9594
06:43:07,570 --> 06:43:07,970
Zzz...

9595
06:43:07,970 --> 06:43:08,310
Remix.

9596
06:43:08,550 --> 06:43:09,430
That was cool.

9597
06:43:10,170 --> 06:43:10,690
But...

9598
06:43:10,690 --> 06:43:12,310
Still hits different.

9599
06:43:13,350 --> 06:43:13,830
Yeah.

9600
06:43:14,470 --> 06:43:15,310
Humma humma.

9601
06:43:15,870 --> 06:43:16,970
Humma humma humma.

9602
06:43:17,590 --> 06:43:18,530
Humma humma humma.

9603
06:43:19,590 --> 06:43:21,430
Twin Snakes seems pretty great so far.

9604
06:43:21,690 --> 06:43:22,650
It is a lot of fun.

9605
06:43:22,870 --> 06:43:23,870
It is a lot of fun.

9606
06:43:24,030 --> 06:43:24,390
It's...

9607
06:43:24,390 --> 06:43:25,070
Uh...

9608
06:43:25,710 --> 06:43:26,190
I'm...

9609
06:43:26,190 --> 06:43:27,070
I'm...

9610
06:43:27,730 --> 06:43:28,210
Uh...

9611
06:43:28,850 --> 06:43:29,810
Kind of like...

9612
06:43:29,810 --> 06:43:29,970
Oh!

9613
06:43:30,030 --> 06:43:30,990
If I play this...

9614
06:43:30,990 --> 06:43:32,610
And then play MGS2...

9615
06:43:32,610 --> 06:43:33,450
Next?

9616
06:43:33,770 --> 06:43:34,890
Maybe I won't...

9617
06:43:34,890 --> 06:43:36,030
Like, uh...

9618
06:43:36,030 --> 06:43:36,970
Well, the controls will be...

9619
06:43:37,810 --> 06:43:38,290
Uh...

9620
06:43:38,290 --> 06:43:38,970
A little different.

9621
06:43:39,030 --> 06:43:39,390
But...

9622
06:43:39,390 --> 06:43:40,130
Maybe...

9623
06:43:40,130 --> 06:43:40,430
It...

9624
06:43:40,430 --> 06:43:40,830
I'll...

9625
06:43:40,830 --> 06:43:41,890
It'll be, like, more...

9626
06:43:41,890 --> 06:43:42,290
I'll be able to...

9627
06:43:42,290 --> 06:43:43,370
Be a little bit more used to it.

9628
06:43:44,870 --> 06:43:46,130
Because I have not...

9629
06:43:46,130 --> 06:43:48,250
I have not touched MGS2.

9630
06:43:48,850 --> 06:43:50,610
I think since I last played it.

9631
06:43:52,690 --> 06:43:57,570
Twin Snakes seems like Otacon retelling the story to add its otaku weeb flair to the reality of what actually happened.

9632
06:43:57,670 --> 06:43:59,010
That's my favorite theory.

9633
06:43:59,670 --> 06:44:00,910
That's my favorite theory.

9634
06:44:01,730 --> 06:44:02,210
Yeah.

9635
06:44:06,200 --> 06:44:07,020
Mint doko?

9636
06:44:07,360 --> 06:44:08,200
Mint koko!

9637
06:44:09,860 --> 06:44:10,480
But yeah.

9638
06:44:10,540 --> 06:44:11,660
Thank you guys for, uh...

9639
06:44:11,660 --> 06:44:12,460
Hanging out with me.

9640
06:44:12,460 --> 06:44:13,380
With playing this.

9641
06:44:13,560 --> 06:44:14,380
And, um...

9642
06:44:14,380 --> 06:44:15,740
I think I'm...

9643
06:44:15,740 --> 06:44:16,320
I'm...

9644
06:44:17,040 --> 06:44:18,100
Going to go to bed.

9645
06:44:18,220 --> 06:44:18,300
Oh!

9646
06:44:19,840 --> 06:44:21,160
I was a little late...

9647
06:44:21,780 --> 06:44:22,700
For a stream today.

9648
06:44:22,860 --> 06:44:24,600
I had to delay it by about 45 minutes.

9649
06:44:24,860 --> 06:44:25,580
Which again...

9650
06:44:25,580 --> 06:44:25,860
Uh...

9651
06:44:25,860 --> 06:44:27,960
Actually, I don't think I apologized for that in the beginning.

9652
06:44:28,080 --> 06:44:28,720
I'm so sorry.

9653
06:44:29,200 --> 06:44:30,020
I'm so sorry.

9654
06:44:30,080 --> 06:44:31,240
I'm so sorry that I was late.

9655
06:44:32,180 --> 06:44:33,500
I had some errands.

9656
06:44:33,520 --> 06:44:34,160
And, um...

9657
06:44:34,160 --> 06:44:34,740
Hold on.

9658
06:44:35,500 --> 06:44:35,880
Uh...

9659
06:44:35,880 --> 06:44:36,740
Let me...

9660
06:44:36,740 --> 06:44:38,000
I did save, right?

9661
06:44:38,060 --> 06:44:38,540
I'm actually...

9662
06:44:38,540 --> 06:44:38,840
I...

9663
06:44:38,840 --> 06:44:40,640
I plan on talking just a little tiny bit more.

9664
06:44:40,820 --> 06:44:42,380
But I'm actually gonna turn off the gameplay.

9665
06:44:42,380 --> 06:44:42,440
And, um...

9666
06:44:43,920 --> 06:44:44,400
Uh...

9667
06:44:44,400 --> 06:44:45,160
I don't want it to, like...

9668
06:44:45,160 --> 06:44:45,960
Wear out or anything.

9669
06:44:46,140 --> 06:44:46,880
So, give me a second.

9670
06:44:48,940 --> 06:44:50,300
Let's transition here.

9671
06:44:51,320 --> 06:44:53,400
And I'm gonna just turn it off.

9672
06:44:55,600 --> 06:44:56,080
Okay.

9673
06:45:02,500 --> 06:45:02,980
Um...

9674
06:45:05,660 --> 06:45:06,140
Uh...

9675
06:45:06,140 --> 06:45:07,900
So, I was a little bit late.

9676
06:45:10,220 --> 06:45:11,840
But I cannot say why.

9677
06:45:14,060 --> 06:45:14,540
Hmm...

9678
06:45:14,540 --> 06:45:14,720
Hmm...

9679
06:45:14,720 --> 06:45:14,940
Hmm...

9680
06:45:15,800 --> 06:45:16,400
I...

9681
06:45:19,820 --> 06:45:23,060
Cannot say why I was a little bit late...

9682
06:45:23,060 --> 06:45:23,780
Hmm...

9683
06:45:23,780 --> 06:45:24,080
Hmm...

9684
06:45:24,080 --> 06:45:24,980
Hmm...

9685
06:45:27,620 --> 06:45:28,220
Mysterious...

9686
06:45:28,920 --> 06:45:29,520
Curious...

9687
06:45:29,520 --> 06:45:30,300
Yes!

9688
06:45:30,420 --> 06:45:31,940
I had some errands.

9689
06:45:31,980 --> 06:45:32,800
I went out...

9690
06:45:32,800 --> 06:45:33,680
I went out...

9691
06:45:33,680 --> 06:45:34,740
Um...

9692
06:45:34,740 --> 06:45:35,580
Of my maid cafe.

9693
06:45:35,680 --> 06:45:37,480
I did a little bit of outside haunting.

9694
06:45:38,980 --> 06:45:39,580
Hmm...

9695
06:45:43,400 --> 06:45:44,600
Taco Bell?

9696
06:45:45,080 --> 06:45:47,180
I wish I had Taco Bell to go with.

9697
06:45:49,860 --> 06:45:52,460
Who said giving birth?

9698
06:45:53,100 --> 06:45:57,980
I don't think ghosts can give birth.

9699
06:45:59,640 --> 06:46:00,940
I don't...

9700
06:46:02,440 --> 06:46:04,060
I don't...

9701
06:46:04,060 --> 06:46:05,140
I

9702
06:46:18,410 --> 06:46:19,850
don't think ghosts...

9703
06:46:21,210 --> 06:46:22,130
Nope.

9704
06:46:31,260 --> 06:46:32,280
I don't think ghosts can give birth.

9705
06:46:33,860 --> 06:46:34,340
But...

9706
06:46:36,060 --> 06:46:36,540
Congratulations.

9707
06:46:40,520 --> 06:46:41,900
Yeah, you'll be saying that.

9708
06:46:42,400 --> 06:46:43,680
You'll be saying that later.

9709
06:46:44,320 --> 06:46:45,160
You will be.

9710
06:46:45,620 --> 06:46:47,240
You will be saying that later.

9711
06:46:47,840 --> 06:46:49,140
Once I can tell you.

9712
06:46:49,820 --> 06:46:50,300
Maybe.

9713
06:46:54,480 --> 06:46:55,080
Maybe.

9714
06:46:55,720 --> 06:46:56,320
Yeah.

9715
06:46:57,200 --> 06:46:58,200
I think so.

9716
06:46:59,540 --> 06:47:01,740
But yeah, sorry I can't tell you yet.

9717
06:47:01,920 --> 06:47:08,420
But I also may have hinted about it in the next podcast episode on Monday.

9718
06:47:08,520 --> 06:47:10,600
So be sure to listen to episode...

9719
06:47:11,960 --> 06:47:12,560
3?

9720
06:47:14,780 --> 06:47:15,380
3.

9721
06:47:16,160 --> 06:47:16,760
3?

9722
06:47:19,380 --> 06:47:19,980
3?

9723
06:47:20,180 --> 06:47:20,660
Right?

9724
06:47:20,820 --> 06:47:21,160
3?

9725
06:47:21,440 --> 06:47:21,980
3.

9726
06:47:24,360 --> 06:47:24,760
Yes, 3.

9727
06:47:25,600 --> 06:47:26,180
Yeah.

9728
06:47:29,540 --> 06:47:30,120
So...

9729
06:47:30,120 --> 06:47:31,900
It feels so much longer.

9730
06:47:32,040 --> 06:47:33,700
When someone was just like...

9731
06:47:33,700 --> 06:47:35,620
Someone was just like...

9732
06:47:35,620 --> 06:47:37,600
Almost 2 weeks that you've been back.

9733
06:47:37,920 --> 06:47:39,680
I mean maybe if you count...

9734
06:47:39,680 --> 06:47:40,840
April 1st.

9735
06:47:42,220 --> 06:47:42,800
But...

9736
06:47:43,400 --> 06:47:44,320
I don't know.

9737
06:47:49,300 --> 06:47:49,880
Sorry.

9738
06:47:51,640 --> 06:47:52,940
Podcast episode 3.

9739
06:47:53,060 --> 06:47:53,860
Snake Eater.

9740
06:47:55,860 --> 06:47:56,440
Cheapreg.

9741
06:47:56,780 --> 06:47:57,320
No.

9742
06:47:58,460 --> 06:47:59,440
I'm gonna go sleep.

9743
06:47:59,520 --> 06:48:01,260
It was fun to be here.

9744
06:48:01,360 --> 06:48:02,020
I'm just getting sleepy.

9745
06:48:02,320 --> 06:48:03,060
Have a good night.

9746
06:48:03,640 --> 06:48:05,920
Thanks for hanging out till the end.

9747
06:48:06,580 --> 06:48:07,720
Congratulations in advance.

9748
06:48:07,900 --> 06:48:11,760
I hope it's a healthy big baby boss.

9749
06:48:12,100 --> 06:48:12,780
Boss baby.

9750
06:48:13,600 --> 06:48:14,460
Boss baby.

9751
06:48:14,580 --> 06:48:14,960
Boss baby.

9752
06:48:17,940 --> 06:48:19,580
Can't wait for April 30th.

9753
06:48:22,320 --> 06:48:23,400
April 30th.

9754
06:48:24,920 --> 06:48:26,000
April 30th.

9755
06:48:26,000 --> 06:48:26,720
I'm just like...

9756
06:48:26,720 --> 06:48:27,440
Yeah, I can wait.

9757
06:48:27,540 --> 06:48:30,440
Because I have so much that I need to plan and think of.

9758
06:48:31,460 --> 06:48:32,400
But I'm like...

9759
06:48:32,400 --> 06:48:32,700
Wait.

9760
06:48:32,840 --> 06:48:34,740
I want time to slow down a little bit.

9761
06:48:36,300 --> 06:48:37,860
I don't need it to go so quickly.

9762
06:48:42,250 --> 06:48:42,690
But...

9763
06:48:45,210 --> 06:48:45,650
Hopefully...

9764
06:48:46,730 --> 06:48:47,750
But the brain rot.

9765
06:48:49,990 --> 06:48:52,610
I missed you like I missed the raft.

9766
06:48:54,250 --> 06:48:55,130
You belong...

9767
06:48:57,050 --> 06:48:57,930
You belong...

9768
06:48:57,930 --> 06:48:58,830
You belong on this boat.

9769
06:49:03,760 --> 06:49:04,200
Man.

9770
06:49:04,320 --> 06:49:05,920
Came back just to say thanks for the stream.

9771
06:49:06,080 --> 06:49:06,780
Thank you.

9772
06:49:08,060 --> 06:49:10,660
Time either goes too fast or too slow.

9773
06:49:11,460 --> 06:49:12,420
Yeah, I know.

9774
06:49:13,800 --> 06:49:14,240
Sometimes...

9775
06:49:14,240 --> 06:49:16,920
Though, if it's too slow, you gotta just...

9776
06:49:17,400 --> 06:49:18,540
Think and be like...

9777
06:49:18,540 --> 06:49:19,620
Okay, you know what?

9778
06:49:19,980 --> 06:49:22,920
It might be something that I'm doing that I don't like.

9779
06:49:23,560 --> 06:49:24,860
And it's going too slow.

9780
06:49:24,940 --> 06:49:25,880
And I just want it to pass.

9781
06:49:26,240 --> 06:49:29,560
But at the same time, you should appreciate the slow times too.

9782
06:49:29,760 --> 06:49:30,200
Because...

9783
06:49:31,420 --> 06:49:31,900
Um...

9784
06:49:32,480 --> 06:49:34,420
You know, then if you're just like...

9785
06:49:35,240 --> 06:49:36,940
When it gets too fast...

9786
06:49:36,940 --> 06:49:37,960
It's too...

9787
06:49:38,500 --> 06:49:38,980
It's...

9788
06:49:41,480 --> 06:49:42,500
It's hard to...

9789
06:49:43,840 --> 06:49:44,320
Notice...

9790
06:49:44,320 --> 06:49:46,640
It's hard to notice things in the moment.

9791
06:49:46,700 --> 06:49:47,780
When things are too fast.

9792
06:49:48,620 --> 06:49:50,100
Like a kidney stone.

9793
06:49:50,380 --> 06:49:52,980
If you have a kidney stone, go on a roller coaster.

9794
06:49:55,340 --> 06:49:56,560
Like... I think...

9795
06:49:56,560 --> 06:49:57,120
What is it?

9796
06:49:57,120 --> 06:49:58,420
Thunder Mountain...

9797
06:49:58,420 --> 06:50:00,900
Third seat from the last or something?

9798
06:50:01,200 --> 06:50:01,560
Is...

9799
06:50:01,560 --> 06:50:02,460
Huh?

9800
06:50:03,820 --> 06:50:04,040
What?

9801
06:50:04,160 --> 06:50:05,880
Yeah, if you have a kidney stone...

9802
06:50:06,680 --> 06:50:08,620
Some doctors actually...

9803
06:50:08,620 --> 06:50:09,360
I wanna say doctors.

9804
06:50:09,560 --> 06:50:11,580
I'm not a doctor, so don't listen to that.

9805
06:50:11,700 --> 06:50:14,300
Some things do...

9806
06:50:15,020 --> 06:50:16,740
I have read...

9807
06:50:16,740 --> 06:50:19,080
That it is also...

9808
06:50:19,080 --> 06:50:20,440
Said that you...

9809
06:50:20,440 --> 06:50:23,340
Should go on certain roller coasters...

9810
06:50:23,340 --> 06:50:25,420
That will help dislodge it.

9811
06:50:25,980 --> 06:50:27,080
I feel like...

9812
06:50:27,080 --> 06:50:29,580
2024 just came, but now it's already April.

9813
06:50:29,660 --> 06:50:30,020
I know!

9814
06:50:30,980 --> 06:50:31,900
I know, right?

9815
06:50:32,440 --> 06:50:35,780
Well, I mean, I spent two months in Japan and that flew by so quickly.

9816
06:50:36,020 --> 06:50:36,460
So...

9817
06:50:36,460 --> 06:50:39,260
To me, I can't even believe it's April.

9818
06:50:39,800 --> 06:50:40,860
Mid-April, I thought.

9819
06:50:42,720 --> 06:50:43,160
Disclaimer.

9820
06:50:43,320 --> 06:50:44,340
Mint is not a doctor.

9821
06:50:44,580 --> 06:50:45,840
No, I am a ghost maid.

9822
06:50:45,920 --> 06:50:46,920
I am not a doctor.

9823
06:50:47,780 --> 06:50:48,220
Yet.

9824
06:50:51,500 --> 06:50:51,940
Hmm...

9825
06:50:51,940 --> 06:50:52,360
Hmm...

9826
06:50:52,360 --> 06:50:52,780
Hmm...

9827
06:50:55,500 --> 06:50:55,980
Hmm...

9828
06:50:55,980 --> 06:50:56,920
Yet.

9829
06:51:00,780 --> 06:51:01,260
Hmm...

9830
06:51:02,420 --> 06:51:02,900
Hmm...

9831
06:51:04,120 --> 06:51:04,600
Yet.

9832
06:51:16,690 --> 06:51:18,510
With jumping out of a plane work...

9833
06:51:18,510 --> 06:51:20,250
No, I think you actually need like...

9834
06:51:20,250 --> 06:51:22,150
The bumpiness of a roller coaster to...

9835
06:51:22,650 --> 06:51:23,350
Dislodge it.

9836
06:51:23,810 --> 06:51:25,090
Like, look it up!

9837
06:51:25,130 --> 06:51:25,490
Look it up!

9838
06:51:25,490 --> 06:51:25,750
Look it up!

9839
06:51:27,270 --> 06:51:29,110
I wrote this before I saw Sakura.

9840
06:51:30,730 --> 06:51:31,210
Wow!

9841
06:51:32,010 --> 06:51:33,390
I didn't see it at all!

9842
06:51:33,630 --> 06:51:34,090
Too bad.

9843
06:51:36,510 --> 06:51:36,870
Well, it's okay.

9844
06:51:38,390 --> 06:51:39,190
Next year too.

9845
06:51:40,750 --> 06:51:41,150
Sakura.

9846
06:51:42,790 --> 06:51:44,130
Time flies when you're having fun.

9847
06:51:44,230 --> 06:51:46,410
And I've been having a lot of fun since you've been back, Mint.

9848
06:51:46,530 --> 06:51:47,130
Thank you!

9849
06:51:47,490 --> 06:51:48,150
Thanks, Nixxi!

9850
06:51:48,950 --> 06:51:50,310
Congratulations on being a doctor.

9851
06:51:50,470 --> 06:51:51,690
Stop spoiling!

9852
06:51:54,910 --> 06:51:55,490
Stop it!

9853
06:52:00,990 --> 06:52:03,010
I don't need excuses to go on a roller coaster.

9854
06:52:03,130 --> 06:52:04,230
All I'm saying is that...

9855
06:52:04,650 --> 06:52:05,590
It could help.

9856
06:52:05,590 --> 06:52:07,010
If you have a kidney stone.

9857
06:52:07,190 --> 06:52:08,250
It could help.

9858
06:52:09,230 --> 06:52:11,070
Not 100%, but you know.

9859
06:52:16,150 --> 06:52:16,710
Yeah.

9860
06:52:19,710 --> 06:52:20,650
Hi, Asu!

9861
06:52:23,910 --> 06:52:25,250
Hot nurse Mint.

9862
06:52:26,390 --> 06:52:26,950
What?

9863
06:52:29,370 --> 06:52:29,930
Okay.

9864
06:52:31,330 --> 06:52:34,430
Tomorrow, like I said, I think I'll be streaming same time-ish.

9865
06:52:34,430 --> 06:52:38,190
Not as on the schedule, but as when I started the stream.

9866
06:52:38,410 --> 06:52:40,710
So, about 4pm EST.

9867
06:52:41,090 --> 06:52:42,530
I'll make a waiting room for it tonight.

9868
06:52:44,530 --> 06:52:47,110
But as usual, I probably won't be streaming on Monday.

9869
06:52:48,290 --> 06:52:48,810
So...

9870
06:52:49,850 --> 06:52:52,130
So you can watch the...

9871
06:52:53,010 --> 06:52:54,050
Watch the...

9872
06:52:54,050 --> 06:52:55,070
No.

9873
06:52:55,170 --> 06:52:55,410
Yes.

9874
06:52:55,450 --> 06:52:56,330
Listen to the podcast.

9875
06:52:58,030 --> 06:52:59,310
Listen to the podcast.

9876
06:53:00,570 --> 06:53:01,470
Listen to it.

9877
06:53:01,470 --> 06:53:02,970
You guys, I have a question.

9878
06:53:03,050 --> 06:53:04,010
Sorry, I just opened up Twitter.

9879
06:53:05,070 --> 06:53:05,590
When...

9880
06:53:06,630 --> 06:53:09,910
When did yapping become the word?

9881
06:53:10,170 --> 06:53:10,790
You know what I mean?

9882
06:53:11,230 --> 06:53:12,250
When did...

9883
06:53:12,250 --> 06:53:15,170
I feel like ever since I came back...

9884
06:53:15,170 --> 06:53:16,110
Like...

9885
06:53:16,870 --> 06:53:18,570
Everyone started saying like...

9886
06:53:18,570 --> 06:53:19,850
I'm doing a yapping stream.

9887
06:53:20,110 --> 06:53:21,230
When did that happen?

9888
06:53:22,950 --> 06:53:24,090
3 months ago?

9889
06:53:25,310 --> 06:53:26,650
So it's recent, huh?

9890
06:53:27,070 --> 06:53:28,190
I was like...

9891
06:53:28,190 --> 06:53:29,750
I've never seen it before.

9892
06:53:29,890 --> 06:53:31,730
When I come back and suddenly everyone's like...

9893
06:53:31,730 --> 06:53:32,570
I'm yapping.

9894
06:53:33,210 --> 06:53:34,570
I'm yapping here.

9895
06:53:36,690 --> 06:53:38,890
When the Twitch emote got popular.

9896
06:53:39,130 --> 06:53:40,370
Oh, it's a Twitch emote.

9897
06:53:45,510 --> 06:53:47,810
I heard it for the first time from Tuna.

9898
06:53:48,730 --> 06:53:49,990
Mint Phantom MD.

9899
06:53:50,350 --> 06:53:51,930
MD stands for maid doctor.

9900
06:53:53,450 --> 06:53:54,010
Yes.

9901
06:53:57,650 --> 06:54:00,570
I just ordered one of 5000 keycard set from MGS.

9902
06:54:00,710 --> 06:54:00,970
I just ordered one of 5000 keycard set from MGS.

9903
06:54:00,970 --> 06:54:01,490
Oh, yes!

9904
06:54:02,950 --> 06:54:03,390
Nice!

9905
06:54:04,410 --> 06:54:05,710
I did want to get those too.

9906
06:54:06,170 --> 06:54:07,750
But it kind of feels weird.

9907
06:54:08,010 --> 06:54:12,050
It feels weird that they are 3 different cards.

9908
06:54:12,650 --> 06:54:13,770
It feels weird that they are 3 different cards.

9909
06:54:14,330 --> 06:54:15,290
Yappity yappy yapp.

9910
06:54:17,010 --> 06:54:17,450
Hmm.

9911
06:54:20,720 --> 06:54:22,500
Like I've heard of yapping before.

9912
06:54:22,600 --> 06:54:23,240
Like a word.

9913
06:54:23,480 --> 06:54:24,700
Like I didn't think it was a new word.

9914
06:54:25,380 --> 06:54:27,240
I'm surprised that so many Vtubers were using it.

9915
06:54:27,320 --> 06:54:28,200
For their streams.

9916
06:54:28,360 --> 06:54:30,980
Like if sometimes for like Zatsudan and stuff.

9917
06:54:31,240 --> 06:54:32,680
I would like call them chit chatting.

9918
06:54:33,440 --> 06:54:33,960
But...

9919
06:54:35,300 --> 06:54:37,640
But now they're all becoming yapping.

9920
06:54:38,900 --> 06:54:40,100
Yapping is from TikTok?

9921
06:54:40,840 --> 06:54:41,280
Oh wait, who?

9922
06:54:42,840 --> 06:54:43,360
Nobody...

9923
06:54:43,360 --> 06:54:45,160
Oh wait, the sources are getting crossed.

9924
06:54:46,260 --> 06:54:47,040
Okay, hi!

9925
06:54:47,500 --> 06:54:48,460
Welcome to membership.

9926
06:54:48,860 --> 06:54:50,900
Mr. Bones, welcome to membership.

9927
06:54:50,940 --> 06:54:51,660
Thank you!

9928
06:54:53,200 --> 06:54:54,740
Yeah, it just kind of picked up.

9929
06:54:55,380 --> 06:54:55,800
Hmm.

9930
06:54:57,540 --> 06:54:59,680
And like Matara says it all the time too.

9931
06:54:59,780 --> 06:55:00,760
So I'm just like...

9932
06:55:01,240 --> 06:55:01,860
Yappy yappy yapp.

9933
06:55:03,080 --> 06:55:04,260
Play Ace Combat.

9934
06:55:04,780 --> 06:55:07,160
Oh my gosh, what is this username?

9935
06:55:08,640 --> 06:55:10,940
You don't have to super chat me to play it.

9936
06:55:11,060 --> 06:55:14,340
Though I don't have any plans on playing it super soon.

9937
06:55:14,500 --> 06:55:14,800
But...

9938
06:55:15,660 --> 06:55:17,420
You can probably see it in the future.

9939
06:55:18,060 --> 06:55:19,780
Dr. Mint playing as Big Boss.

9940
06:55:20,200 --> 06:55:21,420
Can it be V?

9941
06:55:22,220 --> 06:55:23,240
I'm not Big Boss.

9942
06:55:24,280 --> 06:55:25,260
I'm Solid Mint.

9943
06:55:32,110 --> 06:55:33,290
It's popularized on TikTok.

9944
06:55:35,030 --> 06:55:36,110
Just looked it up.

9945
06:55:36,250 --> 06:55:38,450
There's actual research on roller coasters and kidney stones.

9946
06:55:38,670 --> 06:55:40,270
Thunder Mountain is recommended roller coaster...

9947
06:55:40,270 --> 06:55:41,090
That's what I said!

9948
06:55:42,990 --> 06:55:44,010
That's what I said!

9949
06:55:46,490 --> 06:55:50,350
I don't know if you remember, but one time in Among Us, you said you have a very large pee-pee.

9950
06:55:50,390 --> 06:55:51,010
Is this still true?

9951
06:55:53,050 --> 06:55:54,750
Having a large pee-pee is...

9952
06:55:55,590 --> 06:55:57,090
Is a physical...

9953
06:55:57,090 --> 06:55:57,590
Not a physical.

9954
06:55:57,750 --> 06:55:59,710
It's a mindset.

9955
06:56:00,850 --> 06:56:01,810
It's a mindset.

9956
06:56:02,970 --> 06:56:03,570
Right?

9957
06:56:04,310 --> 06:56:05,450
I'd say...

9958
06:56:07,730 --> 06:56:08,770
I'd say sure.

9959
06:56:10,470 --> 06:56:11,070
Anyway.

9960
06:56:12,710 --> 06:56:14,330
It's a state of mind.

9961
06:56:15,290 --> 06:56:16,390
A mint set.

9962
06:56:18,370 --> 06:56:18,970
Yes.

9963
06:56:19,370 --> 06:56:21,430
The big pee-pee grind set.

9964
06:56:25,970 --> 06:56:26,370
Yeah.

9965
06:56:27,990 --> 06:56:28,390
Yeah.

9966
06:56:28,690 --> 06:56:29,090
Just...

9967
06:56:29,850 --> 06:56:31,510
Just think it and you got it.

9968
06:56:32,350 --> 06:56:33,970
April has been great so far.

9969
06:56:34,050 --> 06:56:35,770
My Kamiyoshi is back from hiatus.

9970
06:56:35,930 --> 06:56:36,810
I started a new job.

9971
06:56:36,850 --> 06:56:37,730
My best friend got engaged.

9972
06:56:38,350 --> 06:56:39,310
Here's to a fun summer.

9973
06:56:39,510 --> 06:56:39,950
Oh my gosh!

9974
06:56:40,030 --> 06:56:41,130
Congrats, Melanie!

9975
06:56:43,430 --> 06:56:43,910
Let's go!

9976
06:56:45,050 --> 06:56:48,050
Does Solid Mint imply the existence of liquid mint and gas mint?

9977
06:56:48,530 --> 06:56:51,490
Well, I mean, if I'm a ghost, I'm like kind of gaseous?

9978
06:56:52,710 --> 06:56:53,110
Maybe?

9979
06:56:53,110 --> 06:56:54,090
I don't want to say that.

9980
06:56:54,990 --> 06:56:55,630
I think...

9981
06:56:55,990 --> 06:56:57,010
I don't want to say that.

9982
06:56:58,470 --> 06:56:59,710
I don't think I should say that.

9983
06:57:00,610 --> 06:57:02,590
I don't think I should say I'm gassy.

9984
06:57:04,110 --> 06:57:04,990
I don't think I should...

9985
06:57:04,990 --> 06:57:05,150
Okay.

9986
06:57:06,450 --> 06:57:07,010
Hold on.

9987
06:57:08,930 --> 06:57:09,390
Hold on.

9988
06:57:09,410 --> 06:57:11,150
If I say something stupid, I gotta do this.

9989
06:57:16,190 --> 06:57:16,670
Hold on.

9990
06:57:22,480 --> 06:57:22,960
Oh, wait.

9991
06:57:23,300 --> 06:57:23,760
Oh, no.

9992
06:57:23,780 --> 06:57:24,000
Hold on.

9993
06:57:24,020 --> 06:57:24,280
Hold on.

9994
06:57:25,000 --> 06:57:25,660
I messed up.

9995
06:57:25,720 --> 06:57:26,120
I messed up.

9996
06:57:26,160 --> 06:57:26,640
Hold on.

9997
06:57:27,380 --> 06:57:28,040
I messed up.

9998
06:57:28,080 --> 06:57:28,440
I messed up.

9999
06:57:32,160 --> 06:57:32,800
Thank you!

10000
06:57:33,180 --> 06:57:33,360
Soup?

10001
06:57:42,500 --> 06:57:44,220
If I say something dumb...

10002
06:57:46,320 --> 06:57:48,260
And I put this over my face...

10003
06:57:52,610 --> 06:57:53,290
There we go.

10004
06:57:55,670 --> 06:57:56,990
I should not say...

10005
06:57:56,990 --> 06:57:59,090
I should not say what I just said earlier.

10006
06:58:09,390 --> 06:58:12,670
I should not say what I just said earlier.

10007
06:58:12,730 --> 06:58:13,550
Mistress, thank you!

10008
06:58:13,690 --> 06:58:16,690
Congratulations on threatening that accountant and getting your taxes done.

10009
06:58:16,890 --> 06:58:19,670
Oh, you can come back.

10010
06:58:20,090 --> 06:58:21,390
I mean, I didn't threaten anyone.

10011
06:58:23,930 --> 06:58:32,930
As mentioned, Ryuhei did a 1-2-1 cutscene remake of the OG Ps1 cutscenes before Kojima told him specifically Make it like one of his action films and then re-film them.

10012
06:58:33,090 --> 06:58:34,170
I did know about that.

10013
06:58:34,230 --> 06:58:35,090
I did know about that.

10014
06:58:35,170 --> 06:58:35,610
Yes, yes.

10015
06:58:36,970 --> 06:58:38,310
Thank you for the really fun stream, Mint.

10016
06:58:38,370 --> 06:58:40,950
I'm so happy to get to see you play it and enjoy all the silly cutscenes.

10017
06:58:41,150 --> 06:58:42,670
I'm so happy seeing you react to snakes.

10018
06:58:42,810 --> 06:58:43,890
Sounds like a spy movie.

10019
06:58:44,230 --> 06:58:45,050
It's so goofy.

10020
06:58:45,250 --> 06:58:47,230
I really just feel like Otacon retelling.

10021
06:58:47,270 --> 06:58:47,570
It does!

10022
06:58:48,890 --> 06:58:49,270
GGG.

10023
06:58:49,690 --> 06:58:50,690
Ghastly, gassy ghost.

10024
06:58:51,530 --> 06:58:52,450
Ghastly, gas...

10025
06:58:53,450 --> 06:58:54,490
Ghastly, gassy ghost.

10026
06:58:58,310 --> 06:59:00,010
I have to have this on the ready.

10027
06:59:01,450 --> 06:59:02,430
Wee-woo!

10028
06:59:02,710 --> 06:59:03,530
Wee-woo!

10029
06:59:03,870 --> 06:59:04,470
Wee-woo!

10030
06:59:05,330 --> 06:59:07,470
Incoming... bad clip!

10031
06:59:07,790 --> 06:59:08,150
Avert,

10032
06:59:14,030 --> 06:59:15,170
avert, avert your eyes!

10033
06:59:15,850 --> 06:59:18,630
Don't... don't... don't watch!

10034
06:59:19,050 --> 06:59:19,930
Don't watch!

10035
06:59:24,290 --> 06:59:26,950
Do... do... do not watch.

10036
06:59:29,870 --> 06:59:31,370
Let's pick a better...

10037
06:59:33,850 --> 06:59:36,150
Oh no, I think...

10038
06:59:37,610 --> 06:59:39,930
Oh, a bunch of my fonts got...

10039
06:59:40,430 --> 06:59:40,990
Here we go.

10040
06:59:41,030 --> 06:59:41,850
This one's kind of cuter.

10041
06:59:42,150 --> 06:59:42,690
Beep-boop!

10042
06:59:48,510 --> 06:59:50,590
And then let's make it center.

10043
06:59:51,870 --> 06:59:53,490
Wait, why is it like off like that?

10044
06:59:54,510 --> 06:59:55,150
Oh, there we go.

10045
06:59:57,350 --> 06:59:59,090
Okay, outline a little bit more.

10046
07:00:01,450 --> 07:00:02,430
Oh, here we go.

10047
07:00:03,530 --> 07:00:04,810
Oh, that's as thick as it can get.

10048
07:00:05,610 --> 07:00:05,970
Oh, that's as thick as it can get.

10049
07:00:06,150 --> 07:00:06,510
Oh, that's as thick as it can get.

10050
07:00:06,510 --> 07:00:07,110
Oh wait, hold on.

10051
07:00:07,370 --> 07:00:10,030
If I make it this size...

10052
07:00:10,610 --> 07:00:11,850
And there...

10053
07:00:11,850 --> 07:00:13,630
Making this really official, aren't I?

10054
07:00:15,230 --> 07:00:16,110
Oh, it's so small.

10055
07:00:18,570 --> 07:00:18,970
And...

10056
07:00:19,530 --> 07:00:19,930
Oh!

10057
07:00:20,310 --> 07:00:21,150
Wait, wait.

10058
07:00:24,110 --> 07:00:24,910
Reset, reset.

10059
07:00:29,580 --> 07:00:30,300
There we go.

10060
07:00:33,400 --> 07:00:34,280
Oh, this one too.

10061
07:00:34,380 --> 07:00:34,700
There we go.

10062
07:00:35,960 --> 07:00:36,880
Okay, okay, okay.

10063
07:00:37,000 --> 07:00:37,560
Now that's...

10064
07:00:37,560 --> 07:00:38,160
There we go.

10065
07:00:45,080 --> 07:00:45,520
Okay.

10066
07:00:46,540 --> 07:00:46,980
Okay.

Even though it overwhelms me.

10087
07:01:29,500 --> 07:01:30,640
In a good way though.

10088
07:01:30,780 --> 07:01:31,360

Wait, I saw it.

10097
07:01:48,100 --> 07:01:48,420
Where did it go?

10098
07:01:50,520 --> 07:01:51,320
Never mind.

10099
07:01:51,440 --> 07:01:52,840
Did I imagine that?

10100
07:01:53,000 --> 07:01:53,460
I don't know.

10101
07:01:55,020 --> 07:01:58,300
Can I use that incoming bad clip sound bite as my channel intro?

10102
07:01:58,540 --> 07:01:59,320
Yes, of course.

10103
07:02:00,800 --> 07:02:01,600
Of course.

Oh, there it is.

Wait, no it's not.

10106
07:02:03,900 --> 07:02:04,540

07:02:04,860 --> 07:02:05,040
