a minkin kitty i can't speak this does not bode well for karaoke

20
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:19,480

21
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,100
Oh, let me check Discord.

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,820
Uh, back in February.

24
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,980
Started working on, or rather, I started it in February.

25
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,360
And then, I think things, most of it got done April.

26
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,640
But by then, my voice was completely shot.

27
00:05:43,680 --> 00:06:17,580
And so I was like, I'm sorry guys, I have to wait to record and so i couldn't record until like what last month month before last and so i've just been kind of like buzzing this entire time and i'm like just because i love this song Oh, Phoebe just messaged me New cover with Nimmy,

30
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,220
So thank you, everybody who worked with me.

31
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,560
Hime.

32
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,460
Well, I'm trying to...

33
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,260
I mean, I don't want to miss anybody.

34
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,600
Wait.

35
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,440
Noi and Desi did the illustrations.

36
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,120
And then the live 2D was Hime.

37
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,760
And then Soke did the video.

38
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,540
And then Veshen did the mixing.

39
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,820
So thank you, everybody.

40
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

41
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,840
And Shina was the project manager.

42
00:07:12,060 --> 00:08:14,680
i don't want to forget i don't want to forget anybody so thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you thank you so please listen to it lots it cost me a pretty penny so listen not that i make money from you watching the video because uh you know covers covers usually get what's the word uh copyright claimed but I want you to just enjoy it animation was great yeah they did such an amazing job of mimicking the original yeah claimed claimed claimed demonetized yeah yeah yeah so I just really wanted to say and I felt Nimi was perfect because the angel is a little bit devilish and the devil is not so devilish.

43
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
At the same time, so I felt like it suited us.

44
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,820
And then, of course, stop getting pregnant, of course I have to say death, death, death.

45
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,140
I'm also a ghost.

46
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,740
So I thought it was like the perfect song for the two of us.

47
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,280
Hearing you cover this song as a dream come true.

48
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,260
And then it was a perfect choice as a partner.

49
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,080
Yeah!

50
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,520
So happy I could sing it with her.

51
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,860
So catchy.

52
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,180
It's so, so catchy.

53
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,280
Yeah.

54
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,960
Both you and Nimi did a great job on the cover.

55
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,540
Why are you guys pregnant now, though?

56
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,780
Did the death, death, death not work?

57
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,780
And I'm sorry I've been doing so many karyokies lately.

58
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:40,060
for my debut well short but I did a little bit of singing on my debut and then I did an unarchived one not so long ago but that was on that was impromptu but I but ever since my voice has gotten mostly better like 99% better it's also good for me to kind of retrain it because I've been I my voice is better but it also is hard for me to reach some notes that I used to be able to reach

59
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,840
practicing again to get there, you know?

60
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,440
A little bit.

61
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,060
So sorry.

62
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,220
I've been doing a lot of karaoke because I am excited.

63
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,200
I can sing again.

64
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,260
Thank you for the super chance, you guys.

65
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,260
Thank you.

66
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,460
Thank you.

67
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,540
A long time dream of mine?

68
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,820
What kind of dream could that be?

69
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,020
Well, I'm so happy.

70
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,000
That is finally out.

71
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Oh!

72
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:14,960
Ah!

73
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,540
And so, also because of the 400k.

74
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,840
Thank you guys!

75
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,900
Thank you!

76
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,660
Thank you!

77
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,300
Thank you!

78
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah!

79
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,540
Wow!

80
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,480
Thank you for that!

81
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,060
Wow!

82
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,260
Wow!

83
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
So many...

84
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,860
Red pink!

85
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,100
The sassiness you sang with?

86
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,220
Perfect homage to the original performance while serving that trademark Minto attitude.

87
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,280
There's never too many Minto Karyokis!

88
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

89
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,120
No such thing is too much Karyokis.

90
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,680
Did you guys have the same thought?

91
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,360
Did you guys have the same exact thought?

92
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,040
Wow, thank you so much for the 50 Gifted Rubber, thank you.

93
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,360
Listen, thank you so much for Aqua Supa.

94
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,700
Thank you guys!

95
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,580
That squeak at the end though.

96
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,760
Originally, I was going to re-record it because I was just like...

97
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe I shouldn't have that voice squeak.

98
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
But then I thought it was kind of cute.

99
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,120
It kind of fit.

100
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,520
So I kept it.

101
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,380
I kept it.

102
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
I kept it.

103
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,700
Jeff, thank you.

104
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,340
Twas a great cover.

105
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,660
Thank you so much.

106
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,820
Whoa, weird world.

107
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,740
Do you think your karaoke is something to apologize for?

108
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,880
Well, I know it's not everybody's favorite kind of...

109
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,780
I love your singing, also green women in suits.

110
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah!

111
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,100
My steak is too tender, too juicy.

112
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,540
Love the squeak.

113
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,320
Yay!

114
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,380
Yippee!

115
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,100
Nah.

116
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,780
I'm so happy with how it turned out.

117
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,620
Even though it's my own cover, I'm like, yeah, I want to repeat it.

118
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,420
Even though it was my own cover I'm still so like

119
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,320
And then

120
00:12:28,240 --> 00:13:19,760
She I think she sounded So perfect She was worried about her About her singing But to me I thought it sounded So cute Though luckily the song is not It's less It's more kind of like Talk singing than like singing singing So I you know Even if she is a little self-conscious about that i thought it would still fit her very well and i think it did she sounded amazing your voice is beautiful be don't take you you know how sometimes an idol's performance isn't perfect but it's so much better than they don't but stop it stop stop it stop relating it to idols last year sorry for not enough karaoke this year less karaoke sorry for too Did I do that too much?

121
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,940
When did I ask Nimmy to join?

122
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,800
Probably shortly before I asked Aire about it.

123
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,060
Because I really love noise art.

124
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,360
I thought that she would be able to do it well.

125
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,780
Like replicate the original.

126
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,740
So probably around February...

127
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,880
Late January.

128
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:56,240
January ish when did when did the original come out I don't remember I look it up I look it up

129
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:25,900
wait I have to turn the music off because it's gonna play there we go um it came out February 4th was the original I hopped on that February 7th I already Okay, so it came out February 4th of this year, and on the 7th, I was like, yeah, I'm going to cover this.

130
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
I hopped on that.

131
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,740
I wasted no time.

132
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,040
I was like, Nimi Nightmare, we want to do this cover with me.

133
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,860
And she said, yeah.

134
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
And I was like, okay, thank you.

135
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,820
And then I went immediately to Airu.

136
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,180
I was like, hey, do you guys have time to do this project?

137
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,360
They were like, we can probably start in March or April.

138
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
They could start in April.

139
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,740
And I was like, okay, sounds good.

140
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,060
That's crazy.

141
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,080
I was super duper like.

142
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:06,240
Which sucks because if it had come out originally in like May, June when I wanted it to, it would have been.

143
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,900
It would have been like zooming fast.

144
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,860
Curse my voice.

145
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,460
But it's okay.

146
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,600
Never get tired of your karaoke's.

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,360

Deserve to be proud, because you sure make us proud.

I don't know how to put stuff on Spotify.

151
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,400
Maybe I can figure it out.

152
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,340
Striking while the iron is still just like lava.

153
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,860

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,660
Oh, drive home safe!

171
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,540
Yeah, the intonations and stuff.

172
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:08,040
But I think that also makes it kind of our own as well, if it's not exactly to the original, but close enough.

173
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,640
I think it worked.

174
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,560
Yes.

175
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,960
Guys, we only have about one month left of summer.

176
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,160
Isn't that crazy?

177
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,980
Summer, wait, maybe I should get more summer.

178
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,020
Maybe I should be more summery then.

179
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,700
But we're outside.

180
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,480
It's hot.

181
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm gonna be sweaty if I don't take off my jacket.

182
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,740
Too fast.

183
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,600
Right.

184
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,300
Doesn't feel like it.

185
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,100
Is this gonna be archived?

186
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,300
It will be archived.

187
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,500
Yes, this will be an archived stream.

188
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,060
But don't leave.

189
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,300
Don't leave, though.

190
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,770
She eats s'mores yet?

191
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,050
I should.

192
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,370
I really haven't done anything summery this whole summer.

193
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:11,650
But.

194
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,250
That's okay.

195
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,690
I've been having fun, so.

196
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,170
You know.

197
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,390
Archives, I am out of here.

198
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,030
No!

199
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,950
Have you eaten ice cream?

200
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:27,810
Yeah?

201
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,650
Yeah.

202
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,890
What other summer things have I done?

203
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,610
Bra-funds?

204
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,110
Do you think I need a bra?

205
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,610
What will it support?

206
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,080
The beach?

207
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,900
Well, I went to Enoshima.

208
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,500
I guess.

209
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,180
That's kind of summer-y.

210
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,460
I could go anytime.

211
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,920
But it is a beach-ish.

212
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,020
I didn't walk in the sand.

213
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,700
I touched the sand a little.

214
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,840
But not with my toes.

215
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,720
Barbecue?

216
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:10,980
Wait!

217
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,660
I did do barbecue!

218
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,800
I did!

219
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,580
That was early summer, though.

220
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,460
Hmm.

221
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,960
Did you eat watermelon?

222
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,060
No.

223
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,180
But I've been craving watermelon recently.

224
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,380
I think I'll grab some.

225
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,380
I want to...

226
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,960
Have you guys ever done the watermelon smash?

227
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,940
With the...

228
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,520
You take the bat and you smash the watermelon?

229
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,640
I've done that before.

230
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,160
It's actually quite effective.

231
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,620
Why did I say it like a...

232
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,260
Like a finisher.

233
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,980
Like a finishing move.

234
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,300
The watermelon smash.

235
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,940
With your thighs.

236
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
I think it would go through my thighs.

237
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:14,120
I think I would need like a ton of spiritual energy to like be super physical form so that I could properly squash it with my thighs.

238
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,920
I don't know if I could though.

239
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,020
My thighs are more squishy than strong.

240
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Maybe.

241
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,560
I don't want to think about it.

242
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,060
I don't want to think about it.

243
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,020
I volunteer.

244
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
As what?

245
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,620
Shall we sing?

246
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,640
Watermelon rubber band stream.

247
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,140
I've always kind of wanted to try that.

248
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,400
Congrats on the cover.

249
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,260
Thank you.

250
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,040
What should we sing first?

251
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,420
Summer songs.

252
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,520
Summer songs.

253
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,220
Summer songs.

254
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,140
Summer songs.

255
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,870
I so good here.

256
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,970
It's a three-person song, though.

257
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,760
I secordium, secordium.

258
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,940
Are we doing EN or JP or both?

259
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,960
Well...

260
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,840
I didn't set up my switch.

261
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,140
It's probably gonna be okay.

262
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,240
Probably okay.

263
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,180
Hot to go!

264
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,800
That's a fun one to start with.

265
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,380
Hmm.

266
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,190
Let's just...

267
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:25,820
I could be the one or your new addiction It's all in my head, but I want nonfiction I don't want this world, but I'll take this city Who can blame a girl call me hot, not pretty?

268
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,760
Baby, do you like this beat?

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:39,980

I think of that song is so silly.

278
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:15,370
A hot to go H-O-T-T-O-G-O Hardware store!

279
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,750
I didn't learn it.

280
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,910
I didn't learn the hardware store.

281
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,890
Why you, why you, wow, that would be fun to sing.

282

Sing some green day.

285
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,570
It's my 20th birthday.

286
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,710
Can you please sing Fantasy by Meiko Nakahara?

287
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,890
If you know, I don't know it, but let me write it down.

288
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,190
I have a list of...

289
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,110
Though I haven't gone through it very much lately.

290
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,550
Fantasy by Meiko Nakahara.

291
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,830
so I can learn it for a future.

292
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,950
Happy birthday, James!

293
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,590
Hold on, give me guys one second.

294
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,730
To set up my Switch.

295
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,270
Hora game.

296
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,230
I learned something yesterday.

297
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,530
I learned that Souls-like games in Japanese are called Parigay.

298
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,370
Parigay.

299
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,670
Because they're Perry games.

300
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,110
Parigay.

301
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:49,870
Parigay.

302
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,670
Isn't that kind of cute?

303
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,650
Um, kyoko sagas, kiwado.

304
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,590
Parry games.

305
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,150
Parry game.

306
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,950
Interesting.

307
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,530
Yeah, it's kind of cute.

308
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,010
So, so, so, so.

309
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,970
Parry, parry game.

310
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:07,910
Like, parry.

311
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,250
I love singing this song.

312
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,470
Wow.

313
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
I hope they have it.

314
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,790
Yeah.

315
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,950
They should, though, because it was an anime ending.

316
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,870
Why, yeah, why, yeah, why?

317
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:26,410
It sounds kind of like a baby when I say it like that.

318
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,370
Oh, I forgot to turn off the note of sounds.

319
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,470
I'm so sorry, you guys.

320
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,570
Oh, but thank you so much for the don't know.

321
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,550
Thank you.

322
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,710
Yeah, stream labs.

323
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,590
Furry game.

324
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,790
No.

325
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,710
Oh, I was also something.

326
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,170
There was something about furries, too, that I was watching.

327
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,070
the other day too.

328
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,070
There's this guy on TikTok that like, hold on, let me get his name.

329
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,570
Wait, where's my phone?

330
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,250
Oh, there it is.

331
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,470
I left it on the ground.

332
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:08,930
Okay.

333
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,170
There's this guy on TikTok I like to watch.

334
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,510
I was doing P-Cross on the ground.

335
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,570
But he's actually so interesting.

336
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:52,050
He like teaches kind of obscure and like obscure japanese and like internet slang and stuff like that it feels very like nico nico doga esk but his name is dr west robertson he's just some white dude that like teaches you about and the video i watched was was video game vocabulary so i recommend him because his stuff is really interesting that guy's cool yeah he's cool i like his stuff you've seen him He's everywhere,

00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,970
I've never heard of him before.

339
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,130
Am I the only one?

340
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,330
I think I have enough money.

341
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,870
I think actually I still have all the money that you guys...

342
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:17,170
The e-shop stuff, long, long time ago, you guys gifted some of you guys.

343
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,070
And so I've been using that.

344
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,210
But I wasted it last time.

345
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:51,890
because it was like a hold on you might see my Elgato go away because I was so scuffed last time of during my debut apologize open source new window there we go okay and then let me get it not 90 days three hours three hours three 300 yen.

346
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,130
Cover your Elgato girl.

347
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,130
Cover your Elgato girl.

348
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,850
And then...

349
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,050
Yeah, I still have like 6,000 yen.

350
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,870
It's crazy.

351
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,810
Yes, you are, Kat.

352
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,750
Yeah.

353
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,110
Okay.

354
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,140
That's right?

355
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,240
Yeah.

356
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,080
Oh, it wasn't even going...

357
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,640
I thought the karaoke was going to start.

358
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,300
I'll adjust the sound as it starts and stuff.

359
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
It'll start in a second.

360
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,990
I started to look like a little bit like this.

361
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,430
It's just so weird and I'm alone, I get to go go.

362
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:44,510
And all these words, all these words, all these things are all special, they're all colored to me.

363
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:56,770
Papa, today, from the morning to the night, even if I think about you all right now, Oh, how do you get there?

364
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:09,890
This love is going to be the love This chig-hagg, I'll stop it P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-I This is love,

365
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,620
love, love, love No, mama, jam, oh

366
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:28,660
It's kind of a bit too much, This kind of a long time, I'm sure I'm probably the right way to go, I'm not too much, I'm not too much

367
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,580
Nana no, you can't do it.

368
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,640
Hehehe.

369
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,820
Fully-zumote ku.

370
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:26,520
Kimi-e no, Kimi-e no, awa-tadashi-ku no, new, new, today, today, today, today,

371
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:45,900
Sorry, I forgot the middle.

372
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,250
Sorry, I forgot the middle.

373
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:19,310
That was waya waya waya waya waya, which is not really a summer song at all because the show takes place in Hokkaido.

374
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,570
It was so cold the whole time.

375
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,190
Also, the music was like so low for me.

376
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,790
I had to keep turning it up.

377
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,770
Hold on, let me adjust my El Gato stuff.

378
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,400
Maybe like the...

379
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,500
Cold places have summer too?

380
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,140
No, I guess so.

381
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,660
Sounded fine on your end?

382
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,300
Okay, that's good.

383
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,100
I'm gonna go to the songs and search summer.

384
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,780
Actually, wait, maybe there's like some...

385
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,980
Uh...

386
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,660
Uh...

387
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,940
Anime...

388
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,480
Anime...

389
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,360
Anime...

390
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,380
Anime...

391
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,340
Anime...

392
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,580
What's your anime?

393
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,200
Nostalgic Vocaloid.

394
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,180
Let's see what we have here.

395
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,400
What did...

396
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,240
Next page?

397
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,180
Oh, here we go.

398
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,820
Oh, they do have ice cream.

399
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,420
I don't...

400
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
I could try.

401
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,200
I don't remember... I only remember the chorus.

402
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
I don't remember how the verses go.

403
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,500
Actually, I've been listening to the...

404
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,360
Koyori from Hello Live.

405
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:59,910
released a cover recently and I've been listening to her I've been listening to her cover there is a Chiyage Hanabi but I don't know the rapping part I don't know Yonazu Kenji part at all

406
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,630
What is that from?

407
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,210
From the first time in forever.

408
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,250
What's it from?

409
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,480
What?

410
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,920
Wait, sabi kara?

411
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,640
Wait.

412
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:31,900
Sabi?

413
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,900
Just the chorus?

414
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,520
Hold on, let me see what this is.

415
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,860
No way.

416
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,140
Wait, this is so funny.

417
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,880
Hold on, just so you guys know I'm not bullshitting.

418
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,180
Oh, from frozen!

419
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,420
Oh, sabi kara.

420
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,080
No way, is it just that part?

421
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,060
Choco mint!

422
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:05,780
Your

423
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,730
strawberry flavor Yorima-anata!

424
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,710
Shiki-chan!

425
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,310
Hi!

426
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,870
What do you like?

427
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,890
Cookie and cream?

428
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,550
Yorima-anata!

429
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,510
Mina!

430
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,690
Hi!

431
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,130
What do you like?

432
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,570
Of course!

433
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,830
I love ice cream!

434
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,580
Nobody

435
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,990
else knows this song.

436
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,620
They had to add literally just the chorus to karaoke for people to do.

437
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,900
That's insane.

438
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,600
I scream chorus only.

439
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,500
That's so funny.

440
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,500
I didn't even know there was more.

441
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,020
Oh, I forgot to turn off the streamlapse.

442
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,100
Sorry, I keep...

443
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I'm all over the place.

444
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,460
I'm so sorry.

445
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,340
I'm so sorry I'm all over.

446
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,500
Save.

447
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,840
Save.

448
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,180
Ah!

449
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,180
Save.

450
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,820
So I have to go to each individual sound and turn them to zero.

451
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,160
She's our pro streamer.

452
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,620
Na na na na na na na.

453
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,880
You guys can see what else there is.

454
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,300
Let's see.

455
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,760
Where do my...

456
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,380
There it is.

457
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,320
I can't watch the preview, though, because the timing is so bad.

458
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,060
Wait, anime, yeah, yeah.

459
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,420
Let's see.

460
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,580
What would it be?

461
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,480
Summer, summer.

462
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,920
Love the song cover with Nimi.

463
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,320
Congrats.

464
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,040
Thank you, guys.

465
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,020
Make sure you loop, loop, loop it.

466
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,600
Loop and listen much.

467
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:09,340
I wanted to, I meant to ask Vesan if they could do a mix that had only Nimi, but me out so that I could sing it.

468
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,220
So that I could sing it, but I forgot to ask.

469
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,860
I'm sorry.

470
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,740
I'm sorry.

471
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,860
It's very loopable.

472
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,660
Yippee!

473
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,140
Butterfly is always fun.

474
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,140

It's from you.

00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,820
I'm the one who's been there.

490
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,040
Please, please don't be surprised.

491
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:25,260
Don't be surprised, Tell me, tell me, my heart, my heart, my heart.

492
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:40,480
Arregatenev, Artelevega, You are your hands on the third, I remember you, I'm looking for you.

493
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,040
I finally found you, the ory-hime-same, But where's the other one?

494
00:44:45,180 --> 00:45:14,820
The little bosh-sama This is a one-touch A-touch It's a fun-giant one one-touching One I can't say anything but I'm always First of all, I knew about you.

495
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:19,740
Where did you find me?

496
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,540
I found my hand, but it won't be able to reach me.

497
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,440
It's no, it's not.

498
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,320
Don't cry, don't cry.

499
00:45:33,460 --> 00:46:04,750
So I said, Ah, I'm a strong, I was a little bit I'm not interested in but But, But the heart of the heart The heart of my heart Is, oh, yeah, What do you mean?

500
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,680
What do you want to say?

501
00:46:40,120 --> 00:47:29,680
The heart's voice will hear You're the one who's next to you The truth is sad-cooked I didn't say it, I didn't say it again I'm not going to be able to see that that's all that's all that's all that's all that's all I loved it.

502
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,960
It's a bit strange, isn't it?

503
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:44,200
I know it was just that you don't know it's just a little bit of my own secret.

504
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,220
It's a night that's all over the place in a long way.

505
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,500
It's like you are the only one who's the only one who's the only one.

506
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,240
I know what song I want to sing next

507
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:47,940
Don't worry, we can switch back and forward But right now I'm just thinking Nihongo only But I won't sing only Nihongo I will sing lots of stuff Oh my gosh, that song is so hard.

508
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:48,880
I could try.

509
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,920
I'll sing that one before I try singing.

510
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,620
Umah.

511
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,620
The song, I can't sing it.

512
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,640
I'll just tell you now.

513
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,760
I'll just tell you now I can't sing Umah Pure Identity because it's so hard.

514
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,120
I kind of know it.

515
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,120
Barely.

516
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,980
Rake it off.

517
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,500
Barely.

518
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,780
I gotta learn it better.

519
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,220
Wait.

520
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,300
Okay, I know the chorus of this song.

521
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,700
But I don't know.

522
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,400
This song is so hard.

523
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,600
Wait, isn't there an English version of this song now?

524
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,760
I wonder if I could sing that.

525
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,810
The first 33% is really hard.

526
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:35,450
I know.

527
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,170
I can't do it.

528
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,590
I'm just gonna be like...

529
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,310
I'm just gonna be like...

530
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,720
Ichi-Ni-Tu-Tu-Tu-Tu?

531
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,240
Yo-I-O!

532
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,360
Oh, my pioi!

533
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:57,600
Fight!

534
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:35,290
Daichi-Li-Li-Di-Li-Li-Li-Li-Li-Li-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-DiDiDi-DiDiDi-DiDiDiDiDiDi-DiDiDiDi-DiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDiDi

535
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:24,530
I don't know this part either Wait, the music video is kind of Oh, we missed the guy skiing Or snowboarding Oh, wow Oh,

536
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:34,190
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Wait, I've lost it.

537
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,640
Look at him go.

538
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,300
Look at him go!

539
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:17,780
I don't know the rest.

540
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm gonna quit it here.

541
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,500
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.

542
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:26,700
Yeah!

543
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:37,040
That was kind of umapyo-yoi- umap-umap- that was kind of umapyo-yoi-den-setsu.

544
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,720
Okay, next the total tonal whiplash, I apologize in advance.

545
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,120
Tonal- oh, what did I just move?

546
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,620
Tonal whiplash.

547
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,500
Covered chocolate by Babymetal.

548
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,480
Yude-pioi-denetsu.

549
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,420
Yeah!

550
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,240
The favorite mumble rubber.

551
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,520
Oh, wait.

552
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,560
Oh, uh...

553
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,900
Stop, you flatter me.

554
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,440
Stop!

555
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,230
There she is.

556
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,110
Then maybe after the song we'll go back to...

557
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:30,670
Ego!

558
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,190
Ego!

559
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:34,730
Ego!

560
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,080
Which one should I do?

561
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,720
Actually, can I do all three?

562
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,380
I really like this artist, but I always sing the same three songs, because they're my favorite.

563
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,740
Oh my gosh, they have a sabi-cara too.

564
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,380
Sabi, sabi, S-A-B-I.

565
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,080
In Japanese, it's chorus.

566
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:02,320
So sabi-cara is chorus karaoke for people that only know the chorus.

567
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,100
And they have sabi-cara of this too.

568
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,680
That's so funny.

569
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:06,860
Yeah.

570
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,760
Bekizune.

571
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:08,880
I could try.

572
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,240
Let me do two of these.

573
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,080
I'll do this, y'all.

574
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,240
Because we have a hana bee behind me.

575
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,760
I know, but still want to be close to you.

576
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:16,280
I know,

577
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:21,390
I know.

578
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:41,010
In the summer, in the rain and the rain, the pothapotha, falling down, the green-gown annavy, with the light, the eyes are glaring, and in the instant I'm going to see the moon.

579
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,050
The moon of the moon, the

580
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:19,040
moon and the moon is iniquity, and it's not going to be this summer's only life and I'm going to make it a little bit of time just for your happiness I'm going to see you.

581
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,500
The night of the night is bright.

582
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,120
The night of the snowy night is falling.

583
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:37,300
The golden flowers are made out of the blue sky.

584
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:42,400
No one can say any words.

585
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,900
The moment you make your smile.

586
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,560
Nats no Nats no no no In the

587
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:31,960
Nats no no Nats no no In the rain Pota Pota Foggy

588
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:45,630
Hickory Netsune I'm sure You'll have your You can't hear me.

589
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:51,650
The night of the night is full of night.

590
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,710
The boda boda is falling, kinkyo, and the flowering.

591
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:03,450
No words can't speak any words.

592
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,010
The moment you can't hear me.

593
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:13,210
You can't

594
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:58,190
hear me.

595
00:58:59,130 --> 00:58:59,610
Yuppie!

596
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,230
Yuppie!

597
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,590
Ene!

598
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,070
Thank you.

599
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,930
I want to sing.

600
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:07,990
Sorry.

601
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:10,390
Oi.

602
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,130
Do I have to put in her name?

603
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,830
Do I have to put in her name again?

604
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:16,830
I'm lazy.

605
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,410
I'm lazy.

606
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,090
Z-R.

607
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,450
Thank you for Summer Song!

608
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:29,510
Yeah!

609
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:59,810
Next one is from a movie that I really like which movie oh it's kind of sad oh no you're not lazy not what was it uh oh wait it's written right there there's a movie but it's really cute but it's sad but it's cute but it's sad

610
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,290
Puggy Puggy!

611
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,510
Good morning.

612
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:19,540
It's about this girl who does photography but she's really nerdy and this guy who like...

613
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,280
She's normal.

614
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,640
I clicked

615
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,750
mute instead of reverb.

616
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,280
But

617
01:00:55,830 --> 01:01:00,470
he's kind of a jerk to her because she's a little nerdy, but she's so cute.

618
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:02,670
She's just quirky.

619
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:09,330
But then it's sad, a sad movie, if you watch.

620
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,990
I'm more than ever.

621
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:31,450

I love you.

625
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,990
Just that's it.

626
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,070
It's just that it's good.

627
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:57,520
When the rain when it's raining, the I've seen the kiss is it's the two two two two two is all all are all I can't but you

629
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,620
I can't, I can't read it, but I can.

630
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,840
I'm so sorry.

631
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,380
No, the music video, baby, love.

632
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:05,320
I think she was confessing her feelings to him, but she just gives him this joy.

633
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:11,450
Oh Sorry, I didn't look too

634
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:38,780

635
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,810
You.

636
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:58,990
Futari.

637
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:03,490
Sorry.

638
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,550
Her and her West Virginia hat.

639
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,930
Oh, I'm...

640
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:17,170
I was okay until she just handed him a rolled up piece of paper.

641
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,620
I was okay.

642
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,880
Okay, girl who left her time.

643
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,080
That's a great idea.

644
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,540
Oh golly, I'm so sorry everybody.

645
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,840
It's fine, this is karaoke.

646
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,000
I've sung that song before.

647
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,100
Probably better than this.

648
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,280
No, no, no, no, that's a Rennai Shashen.

649
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,720
Rennai Shashen.

650
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,160
Holy moly.

651
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,960
Okay, I won't pay attention.

652
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,200
I was really good at ignoring it until just there.

653
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,160
Oh man, I suck.

654
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:03,680
Okay, wait.

655
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,000
If I search Tokyo Kakeh Ujo, will it show up?

656
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,040
Oh, I...

657
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,440
Oh my gosh.

658
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,720
I have to show you guys right now.

659
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,960
I was looking for something in my closet.

660
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:17,840
And I...

661
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,520
Hold on, I'm taking a picture right now.

662
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,280
I'll show you literally in this very moment.

663
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,380
I was looking for something in my closet.

664
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,060
And I was going through like old drawers.

665
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,460
And I found this.

666
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,420
And I was like, oh my gosh, I forgot I had this.

667
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,700
I've never used it before.

668
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,900
It's like pristine.

669
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,060
It looks kind of goofy.

670
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,260
as it is, but it's...

671
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,940
Wait, let me make it smaller.

672
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,460
Let me make it smaller.

673
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:45,660
One moment.

674
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:46,500
Please hold.

675
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,420
It's related to the Girlhood Up to Time, which is like my favorite movie ever.

676
01:06:51,760 --> 01:07:00,640
Because uh, there was once a a collab cafe when I was living in Japan, there was a collab cafe for an anniversary.

677
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:07,380
An for the anniversary of of...

678
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,960
not Tokikake, something else.

679
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,600
But they included Tokikake in there.

680
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,220
And...

681
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,900
that's my favorite movie, so I went.

682
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,420
And I was like, Yahoo!

683
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,600
And I bought this there.

684
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,160
I actually still have, like, cups and stuff that I use from the collab cafe.

685
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,580
Uh, here.

686
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,860
Uh, here.

687
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,980
Look at my...

688
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,680
Please hold!

689
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:36,880
Please hold.

690
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,040
Look at my...

691
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,880
My handkerchief!

692
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,280
Which has the two main characters and they're on their little bike.

693
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,400
This is so cute.

694
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,740
If you guys watch the movie, you know.

695
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,640
It's so cute, right?

696
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,720
It's so cute.

697
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,080
And they're like, I love the style, like the way that it's...

698
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,340
That's so cute.

699
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,680
Yeah, watch the movie if you haven't watched it.

700
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,500
It's so good.

701
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,920
It's also pretty sad though.

702
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,640
It's also pretty sad though.

703
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:19,260
To-to-to-toke-toke-toke.

704
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,920
Oh, ah, ah, oh, there it is.

705
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,080
I don't know a movie.

706
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,760
The girl who leapt through time!

707
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,120
The girl who leapt through time.

708
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,040
Yeah, we'll do this one.

709
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,060
My mom bought that movie to watch with the whole family because she thought it would be like, Totoro!

710
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,120
Were you guys traumatized by the ending?

711
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:42,780
Because I would be.

712
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,160
Okay, I'm going to keep the music video up so that you guys, if I...

713
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,320
If I laugh about something, we'll all laugh together, okay?

714
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,440
Hopefully the music video is not stupid.

715
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:03,810
Oh, sorry.

716
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,250
Wait, we've seen this one before.

717
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,890
This one won't get me, I don't think.

718
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:25,090
It's a lot of fun for me to get up to you.

719
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:34,390
I wanted to see all the different faces I wanted to see.

720
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:47,390
The big eyes, the big, the big, the big, now I'm going to put my head on my head.

721
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:59,210
I'm a different person in the world I'm I'm

722
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:21,160
I'm I'm looking for something I'm looking for I'm looking for that day's me, I'm not I'm not I'm trying to get over over my own

723
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,820
He's a cool guy

724
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:57,890
He's a cool guy But the night was white, you were talking to us.

725
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:16,070
You said, You said, You said, You said, I said that voice, now it's still sound now even though it's still heard from the voices

726
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:29,130
I said, I said, I love you and love you.

727
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:38,390
I was looking for something that I was looking for.

728
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:55,990
That day I found a place to go to, if you and me together can go there, I'm still alive I'll be back again

729
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:46,700
I'll be the one I'll be the one I'll be holding I'll be the one The broken sound I can't hear The same way I'm still on the same way The same way I'll trust you to continue.

730
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:58,880
I'm always looking for the things that you never forget.

731
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,980
I don't want to forget you.

732
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,820
I love you.

733
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,720
I love you.

734
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,460
I want to see you.

735
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,220
I love you.

736
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,540
Thank you guys, thank you!

737
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

738
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,860
Shall we go to some English songs?

739
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,940
Some English, English maybe.

740
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,720
I'll keep the, what's it called?

741
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,920
Joy sound music in the background though.

742
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,400
It's playing a guitar, but I hear a single guitar in the song.

743
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,500
Because it's...

744
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:13,740
It's...

745
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,100
Can I sing, Leve?

746
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,600
Sing some of the songs that I did not last unarchived.

747
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,660
I'll sing some songs that I did in the last archive.

748
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,300
Yes?

749
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,100
Yes?

750
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,400
Yes, I love Lever.

751
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:43,400
Goodbye, Dory Song.

752
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:44,320
Ciao.

753
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,900
The skyscrapers causing vertigo.

754
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:02,180
The countdown begins in Tokyo.

755
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,160
27 days alone means 20 million ways to cope.

756
01:15:09,180 --> 01:16:37,470
Without you I'm in a reckless fever Love struck girl, I tease her Thought I'd never be her Quite the job you've done on me, sir You've been hosting parties In my mind, I'm working Over time to have you in my world Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl forced to get creative wrote my feelings down the independent lady in me is nowhere to be found I can't wait another day to see you how embarrassing to be this way I'm in a reckless fever left struck girl I tease her never thought I'd be her quite the job you've done on me so you've been hosting parties in my mind I'm working over time to have you in my world oh what a curse it is to be in love I wave by the phone like a high school movie dream

760
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:29,860
I didn't call you for 16 long days And I should get a cigarette for so much restraint no matter how long I resist temptation I will always lose.

761
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:36,620
It hurts to be something, it's worse to be nothing.

762
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:56,690
with you I've done the math there's no solution will never last why can't I let go of this

01:20:21,300 --> 01:21:04,460
so I broke my promise I called you last night I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have If it weren't for the sight of a boy who looked just like you Standing out on Melrose Avenue It hurts to be something, it's worse to be nothing with you

764
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:19,170
it hurts to be something it's worse to be nothing

765
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:24,950

01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:25,780
One day, I will stop falling in love with you.

778
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:32,760

784
01:25:49,750 --> 01:26:01,970

789
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,510
Gotta go teach cry punching now.

790
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:02,370
What does that mean?

791
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:05,390
The Simpsons theme song.

792
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,450
The Simpsons.

793
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:10,190
A simple and clean!

794
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:12,570
I feel like people really like...

795
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,470
Wait, I think a long time ago I sang simple and clean.

796
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,430
To this exact background.

797
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:20,110
People really like when I sing this song.

798
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:21,190
I feel like...

799
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:26,310
People, hold on, I think I need a, let me, let me spray my throat spray.

800
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:31,750
Poor unfortunate souls.

801
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:33,750
Because you kill it.

802
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:35,310
I'm done.

803
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:38,030
I'm done.

804
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,550
I'm done.

805
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:51,670
Bye bye from a critically acclaimed live action film, The Lion.

806
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:52,730
thinking.

807
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:58,110
What throat spray?

808
01:27:58,330 --> 01:27:59,590
I got this in Japan.

809
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:02,150
It's called Purple Shot Plus R.

810
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:08,370
But I don't like it very much because it's rose flavor and I don't like rose flavor anything.

811
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:09,970
I don't like the smell of roses.

812
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,050
I don't like the taste of roses.

813
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,730
I don't like it.

814
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,270
I don't like it.

815
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:19,590
Before I do Simple and Clean, let me...

816
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:24,590
No, we'll do Simple and Clean.

817
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:25,410
It's fine.

818
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:28,670
It's fine.

819
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:54,470
When you walk away, you don't hear me say, Please, oh baby, don't go simple and clean Is the way that you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go

820
01:28:57,650 --> 01:29:12,170
You're giving me too many things lately, you're all I need.

821
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:28,270
Oh, you smiled at me and said, don't get me wrong, I love you, but does that mean I have to meet your father when we...

822
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:55,070
are older you'll understand what i meant when i said no i don't think life is quite that simple when you walk away you don't hear me say please oh baby don't go simple and clean is the way

823
01:29:58,290 --> 01:30:37,570
tonight it's hard to let it go so simple and clean the daily things like this and that and what is what that keep us all busy are confusing me that's when you And said, I wish I could prove I love you, but does that mean I have to walk on water?

824
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:46,890
When we are older, you'll understand it's enough when I say so.

825
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:51,410
And maybe some things are that simple.

826
01:30:51,890 --> 01:31:44,390
When you walk away, you don't hear me say, So baby, don't go simple and clean It's the way that you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go Hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning Is a little later on, regardless of warnings It doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before When you walk away You don't hear me say Please Oh baby,

827
01:31:44,790 --> 01:32:47,250
don't go Simple and clean Is the way that you're making me feel Tonight It's hard to let it go Hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before Hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all nothing's like before oh oh yeah

828
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:55,860
oh yeah oh

829
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:33,800
my gosh that song doesn't allow me to swallow my spit in the middle so I'm like Hold me!

830
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:39,500
I'm like...

831
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:43,480
I had to put on my glasses so I'd be less embarrassed.

832
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:45,980
But I want to sing this one.

833
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:47,800
Can I sing this one?

834
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,560
I don't remember why I haven't sung this one before.

835
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,680
More Kingdom Hearts.

836
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,020
Let's say English.

837
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,580
Maybe it's kind of cringe.

838
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:20,580
How did I live in a kingdom of these?

839
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:35,060
And people who say things they don't really mean, really mean all.

840
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:39,020
You're only everything I've ever dreamed of.

841
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:54,180
ever dreamed of, ever dreamed of You must be kidding me, did you really think I could say no?

842
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:27,700
I want you for a lifetime, so if you're gonna think twice So baby, I don't wanna know, baby, I don't wanna know everything It's just right But if you're gonna think twice So baby, I don't wanna know Baby, I don't wanna know I really don't get What everyone else believes

843
01:35:30,920 --> 01:36:02,780
And so why do I say The things I don't really mean It really means, oh, I'm only crying because I never dreamed It'd take, take this long, it'd take this long I want you for a lifetime, so if you're gonna think twice So baby, I don't wanna know, baby,

844
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:16,540
I don't wanna know everything is just right And baby, I don't wanna know, baby, I don't wanna know.

845
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,360
Don't think twice.

846
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:22,040
Don't think twice.

847
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:27,140
Don't think twice, baby, don't think twice.

848
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:33,880
If you wanna take it to an even higher level, all you gotta do is say the word, you know I'll follow.

849
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:37,980
If you wanna take it to an even higher level, I don't...

850
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,220
If you wanna...

851
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:42,320
If you wanna...

852
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:49,040
All you gotta do is say the word, the walls will crumble If you wanna make it happen, nothing's impossible Ha!

853
01:36:49,720 --> 01:37:00,700
If you wanna die So if you're gonna think twice So baby, I don't wanna know Baby She talked about biting!

854
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:38,860
Everything is just right But if you're gonna think twice So baby, I don't wanna know Baby, I don't want to know Kiss me once Kiss me twice I don't think twice I don't know this one Don't think twice Don't think twice, baby Don't think twice Kiss me once Kiss me twice

855
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:00,620
I don't know how this part goes.

856
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,560
Don't think twice.

857
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:06,940
Yeah, I'm thinking twice about singing this song, yeah.

858
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:08,860
Why did she say baby so many times?

859
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:39,500
it's so different from the japanese even like part of the cadence is different well that was don't think twice i like the japanese one i think i was it's so like i want to sing this song because i like it but i only like the japanese one yeah baby yeah baby baby with justin beaver over here It's such a pretty song,

860
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,720
but the Japanese one is so much nicer.

861
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,000
But the part where it's like the fast part, I can't read it fast enough because I'm stupid.

862
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,280
I'm still here from Treasure Planet.

863
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:52,060
I don't know.

864
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:54,060
Torn?

865
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:57,720
This sounds familiar, but I don't think...

866
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:00,700
Tangled!

867
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:03,800
Let's see.

868
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:06,700
Hmm.

869
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,000
Tangle makes me cry though.

870
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:11,860
I love Tangled.

871
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,380
Oh, I did do Simple and Clean.

872
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:16,800
Thank you.

873
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:17,120
Thank you.

874
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:17,420
Thank you.

875
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,880
I forgot to write a...

876
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,640
Simple and Clean.

877
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:26,740
Simple and Clean.

878
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,260
Just a few more songs, guys.

879
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:29,040
Oh, wait.

880
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:30,920
It hasn't even been two hours.

881
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:31,760
That's crazy.

882
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,140
Hmm.

883
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,020
Oh, new world.

884
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,060
I want to sing Disney.

885
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,640
Let me just type in Disney.

886
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,340
Disney.

887
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:51,000
Oh.

888
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:53,440
Oh.

889
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:53,980
Bye-bye.

890
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:01,790
There was one song I was listening to that I was like, oh my gosh, I need to sing this karaoke.

891
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:03,350
But I can't remember what it was.

892
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,950
Hellfire.

893
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:12,310
It's there?

894
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:12,950
Oh, yeah.

895
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:14,210
Bye-bye.

896
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:15,930
I'm going to make you go.

897
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:16,650
Bye-bye.

898
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,530
Wait, actually, is it?

899
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:19,450
Oh, yeah, there it is.

900
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:20,750
I was like, I'm pretty sure it's here.

901
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:22,870
Wait.

902
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:25,350
Lion King.

903
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:28,850
That but with passion.

904
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,530
Oh, I love passion.

905
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:33,750
I actually like both versions of passion, though.

906
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:35,930
I think the English one is not so bad.

907
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,270
But don't think twice is just...

908
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:45,650
It's like, it's like, it's like she thought, you know, that's how English people speak.

909
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:50,670
They're just like, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby.

910
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:56,010
And you and I have a new name.

911
01:40:57,670 --> 01:40:58,430
Uh-oh.

912
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:00,390
No, they're my.

913
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:02,230
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

914
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:05,130
My sanctuary.

915
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:06,850
My sanctuary.

916
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:09,990
Wait, I can't even remember what the...

917
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:12,970
Wait, I can't remember what the I always wanted a breather.

918
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:14,990
I don't know how that song is called.

919
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:17,410
What's it called?

920
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:18,130
What?

921
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:20,270
I can't remember it at all.

922
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,830
I always wanted a breather.

923
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:30,610
I always wanted a breather.

924
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:32,490
I always wanted a breather.

925
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:34,230
Just like you.

926
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,110
I always wanted a breather.

927
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:37,870
I always wanted a breather.

928
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:39,950
I always wanted a breather.

929
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:41,610
What was it called?

930
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:44,270
It's not called Sanctuary.

931
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:45,690
You guys...

932
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:48,950
Why are you guys saying sanctuary?

933
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:52,730
No, we're past that.

934
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:56,730
No, I'm talking about the brother's song.

935
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,810
You guys are talking about Kingdom Hearts.

936
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:01,070
We are on two different wavelengths.

937
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,920
You guys are right.

938
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,880
You guys are like, Mint, it's called sanctuary.

939
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:17,580
No, it's called the Lion King.

940
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,890
I don't I don't see it on here.

941
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:26,250
Selection work?

942
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:31,790
It's called I always wanted a brother.

943
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:35,150
I always wanted a brother.

944
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,290
Wait.

945
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:40,190
They don't have it!

946
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:44,010
Unfortunately copyright owners do not authorize the project.

947
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:53,030
Disney's mad.

948
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:55,870
Disney's mad at their sound.

949
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:56,590
They don't...

950
01:42:58,170 --> 01:42:59,710
Oh wait, no, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.

951
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:01,690
I meant to click, I accidentally clicked this.

952
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:02,090
Oh, gosh.

953
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:02,770
Go, go, go.

954
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:03,470
Okay, never mind.

955
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:03,830
Just kidding.

956
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:05,750
You guys didn't even hear it.

957
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,370
Everything's fine.

958
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:06,990
Everything's fine.

959
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:07,870
Hold on.

960
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:10,690
I saved a song recently that I wanted to sing.

961
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:11,910
I have to go to TikTok.

962
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,350
I have to go to TikTok and find it.

963
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,970
I'm not singing Sanctuary now out of spite.

964
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:28,430
Wait, did I save it?

965
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,090
I don't see it.

966
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:30,150
Unless it got taken down.

967
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,270
I'll cry.

968
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:46,070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I think I got taken down.

969
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:47,430
I saved it like today, so.

970
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:51,590
My memory is too bad.

971
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:52,310
Hello?

972
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,390
Oh, oh, oh!

973
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:55,270
I saw him moving.

974
01:43:58,420 --> 01:43:58,940
Hello?

975
01:43:59,160 --> 01:43:59,660
I'm back.

976
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:02,930
What the heck just happened?

977
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:03,270
Oh.

978
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,780
Oh, my stream deck is possessed.

979
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:11,980
That's what's happening.

980
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:13,020
Okay, Disney.

981
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,540
Sabrina Carpenter?

982
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,900
There's too many people making a killing out.

983
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,040
So I just wanted a brother, yeah.

984
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,520
Oh, what's Sabrina Carpenter?

985
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,460
