00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,960
Hello everyone, my friends, my sister.

2
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,040
I feel so fancy with this music.

3
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,120
So refined.

4
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes, hello everybody.

5
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,340
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

6
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
Welcome back.

7
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,620
If this is your first time watching the Pixel Museum, welcome.

8
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,940
If this is your first time watching me, welcome.

9
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
I don't know how to introduce myself.

10
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Why did I make this...

11
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,680
Why did I make this an arbitrary, like, intro?

12
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
Why did I... I don't know.

13
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,400
Why did I make this...

14
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm so sorry.

15
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,620
Yes, I'm so sorry.

16
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,560
You are a VTuber?

17
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
Who am I?

18
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,640
Who's this?

19
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,960
Um...

20
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,200
H...

21
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,840
H...

22
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,400
H...

23
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
T...

24
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,840
H...

25
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,160
H...å¼µ...

26
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,280
VITAL!

27
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
This is my first time watching you, trust.

28
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
Who are you?

29
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:39,400
Why do I feel so... I don't know, on the spot.

30
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,140
But I have to introduce myself.

31
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Such a lust for maids.

32
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
First time viewer here.

33
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,180
I'm ignoring the...

35
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,920
The one-year badge.

36
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,320
Show your true nature to all the wisps.

38
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,960
What's my true nature?

39
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,160
Last time watcher.

40
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,760
No, you have to come back!

41
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,360
I'll be so lonely.

42
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,820
This isn't my first time watching you.

43
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,560
Who am I?

44
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,960
Yeah, why are you asking who I am?

45
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,360
Why don't you introduce yourself instead?

46
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,900
Huh?

47
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
You come into my chat and you don't introduce yourself?

48
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,180
Hmm...

49
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,740
Show them the power of...

50
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:38,960
WIT!

51
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,190
Who are we?

52
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,230
WIT.

53
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,790
I'm MintoLover123.

54
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,650
That's not what your username says.

55
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,550
More like...

56
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,150
More like...

57
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,470
Phony123.

58
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,350
YouTube got rid of usernames.

59
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,890
Not our fault.

60
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,710
Oh, yeah, yeah.

61
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,990
That's um...

62
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,150
Everybody's username originally was...

63
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,070
MintoLover123 and every number upwards.

64
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,250
So, 1, 2, 3...

65
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,430
1, 2...

66
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,450
Wait...

67
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,070
1, 2, 4...

68
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,170
1, 2, 5...

69
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,410
1, 2, 6...

70
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,070
1, 2, 7...

71
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,190
And onwards and onwards and onwards.

72
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,150
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

73
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,010
Oh my goodness.

74
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,610
You guys wrote the super chat.

75
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,130
Today will be Minto.

76
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,270
You are Minto.

77
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,230
Who are we thinking about?

78
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,570
I don't know anymore.

79
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,170
Vintuber, who are you?

80
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,340
Vintuber.

81
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,900
Hello, just a fan of acute ghost mitts.

82
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,400
Understandable.

83
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,600
Good taste.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,460
I never watched you before, or I never will.

85
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,420
My name is Gato, not Gator.

86
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,560
I like robots.

87
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,580
Do you like robots?

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Maybe...

89
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,340
I'm just a teacup.

90
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,960
You are!

91
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

92
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,620
Thank you guys.

93
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,100
Not me, I'm Bintolover123.

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
Totally different.

95
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,460
My original character.

96
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,960
Do not steal.

97
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,320
Bintol.

98
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm missing out.

99
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
My name stayed the same.

100
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,100
Yeah, I did.

101
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,220
I prefer that.

102
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,560
I prefer that.

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
First time watching.

104
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,920
Sergeant Bobby, thank you so much for the 15 months.

106
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,800
Thank you.

107
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,780
Thank you.

108
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,440
El...

109
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,740
A-ha-roll.

110
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,540
What's up with the gifted?

111
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,740
Thank you so much.

112
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,400
Thank you.

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
So you admitted that you're cute.

114
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,760
So you admitted that you're cute.

115
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
What is this mean girl's moment?

116
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,740
So you admitted that you're cute.

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm Pippin and I like potatoes.

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,060
Oh my gosh.

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,840
I don't know.

120
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,760
Oh, I...

121
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,320
I...

122
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,380
I...

123
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:40,860
Oh, what was it?

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,260
Oh!

125
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh!

126
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,260
Um...

127
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,680
I saw...

128
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,340
Someone recreate that...

129
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,760
Heee...

130
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,080
The other day!

131
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,220
And it had me thinking about old memes.

132
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,340
And then like how sometimes people will still reference...

133
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,660
Potatoes, boil em...

134
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:06,920
Mash em...

135
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,740
Stick em in a stew.

136
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,900
I saw, like, I saw that reference recently, too.

137
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,680
I was like, no, what?

138
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh, they're sending the... They're sending the... They're sending the... Oh, what were they?

139
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,340
They're going to Isagard.

140
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,440
What are those things?

141
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,640
Ouch.

142
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't tell me.

143
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,970
They're sending... My brain wants to say elves, but it's...

144
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,250
It's the elf guy that says it.

145
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,470
They're sending the elves to Isagard.

146
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,570
No, they're not.

147
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,230
Why don't they send everybody to Isagard?

148
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,230
VK!

149
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,150
Hobbits!

150
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,190
They're sending the hobbits to Isagard.

151
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,150
Isagard!

152
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,770
What is, Isagard a nice place?

153
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Surprise, Lord of the Re... Lord of the Reference.

154
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,280
No, it's not good.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,800
Isagard is awful.

156
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,630
It is the... Lord of the Flies.

157
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,910
Back off.

158
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,750
Lord of the Reference now.

159
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,970
Wait, was it called?

160
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,730
Lord of the Flies?

161
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,090
Yeah.

162
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,150
Yeah.

163
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,130
No, gosh.

164
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,570
Guys, I...

165
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,930
Tomorrow... Okay, let's start playing the game.

166
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,870
Before I forget...

167
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:08,930
This way?

168
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,210
This one took me forever.

169
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,610
Um, my brain is so... Not great today.

170
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,090
What about Epic Sax Guy with Gandalf nodding?

171
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,010
Wait, I don't think I know that one.

172
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,230
Feeling the need for... Lord of the Rings trilogy watch-along.

173
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,050
I clearly need it because I can't remember Hobbits or...

174
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,690
Or Isagard or anybody.

175
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,650
I can't remember any of this stuff.

176
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,490
We start in small.

177
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,810
I don't know how I want to start today.

178
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,830
I guess we could start small.

179
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,770
15 by 15.

180
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,710
For those who don't know...

181
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,950
These are...

182
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,250
Pixel.puzzle.

183
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,710
I'll explain.

184
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,270
I'll explain.

185
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,070
You have all these numbers up top.

186
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,690
All these numbers on the side.

187
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,670
So this is 1, 3, 1.

188
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,490
Which means...

189
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,030
That the dots will appear in this row.

190
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,450
As one.

191
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,810
With a space.

192
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,790
At least one space.

193
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:25,750
Three.

194
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,510
At least one space.

195
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:27,970
One.

196
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,710
And then eventually...

197
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,410
It creates a picture.

198
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,950
Nonograms!

199
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,490
Yeah!

200
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,510
It's time to have a Lord of the Rings watch-along with Wawa.

201
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,690
She would greatly...

202
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,050
She would be greatly disappointed if she saw a clip of the Hobbits.

203
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,230
Don't show her then.

204
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,470
Don't show her then, please.

205
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,770
Oh, I have to challenge it.

206
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:51,930
Okay.

207
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:52,910
Here we go.

208
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:53,850
Start up!

209
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,890
Oh, I forgot that this one shows like...

210
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,950
It turns blue when it shows...

211
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,350
Something you can do.

212
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,010
So see...

213
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,970
Out of this 15, we know that...

214
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,150
The 9 will always overlap here.

215
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,510
Which is why I can put it in.

216
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,510
And then this...

217
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,330
The 3...

218
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,750
Is to be the first number.

219
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,830
So we know...

220
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,090
It can't be...

221
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,250
It has to be like...

222
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,250
1, 2, 3...

223
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,990
Or 1, 2, 3...

224
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,410
Like that.

225
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,230
Your aura today is nice and round.

226
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,130
Are you saying I put on weight?

227
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,030
Some kind of pixel Sudoku.

228
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,950
Pretty much.

229
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,790
Yes!

230
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,150
No, it's Spectra.

231
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,670
If you say so.

232
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,310
And then like 8 can be here.

233
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,330
But then also...

234
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:58,690
We can...

235
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,030
So since there's 3...

236
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,670
We can go 1, 2, 3...

237
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,070
And then also add the space in.

238
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,990
Like that.

239
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,330
What was the X?

240
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,290
There we go.

241
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,930
We can do that...

242
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,650
Because 6 has to...

243
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,670
6 wouldn't be able to fill in here.

244
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,850
Like that.

245
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,970
Oh wait, I can do one more.ãªãã»ã© .ãªãã»ã©.

246
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,090
This is 5... Wait.

247
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,390
1, 2... Oh wait, okay.

248
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:23,710
Hold on.

249
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,130
1, 2, 3, 4.

250
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,430
Oh, we can fill this in.

251
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,070
Oops.

252
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:31,750
Yippee!

253
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,310
Easy peasy .ãªãã»ã©.

254
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,810
And then since these are...

255
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,890
1s...

256
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,910
We know that there's gonna be spaces in between.

257
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,310
Like so.

258
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,390
It was my birthday the other day.

259
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,830
I think I can get a Slightly Belated B-Day song.

260
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,830
TXR!

261
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,370
I'm so sorry.

262
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,830
I'm not doing birthday songs right now.

263
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,390
But...

264
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,490
Happy Belated Birthday!

265
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,030
Happy, happy, belated birthday!

266
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,890
Why couldn't 6 fit in there?

267
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,150
Because there was this little X.

268
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,770
Oh wait.

269
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,310
Hold on.

270
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,650
Let me make myself a little bit smaller.

271
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,720
There we go.

272
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,420
And so there's only 4 spots.

273
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
6 wouldn't be able to fit in there.

274
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,060
There we go.

275
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,500
And we can do that.

276
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
So we can do that.

277
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,100
Because 4.

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,040
But yeah, guys.

279
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,500
I don't know.

280
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,280
I...

281
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,100
I didn't sleep well last night.

282
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,180
I have my throat doctor appointment tomorrow.

283
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,100
I've never...

284
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,480
I don't know.

285
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,620
I've never...

286
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,420
I've never gotten it done before.

287
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,640
The tube in my throat.

288
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,380
I'm scared.

289
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,380
That's right.

290
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm scared.

291
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,260
For real.

292
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,380
Uh-oh.

293
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,300
Wait.

294
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,300
Did I mess up already?

295
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,460
I messed up already.

296
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,520
Uh-oh.

297
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,900
Maybe I chose the wrong game to play today.

298
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,700
Wait.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,120
Okay.

300
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,440
Hold on.

301
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,000
Let me reset.

302
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,740
Restart!

303
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm so scared tomorrow though.

304
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm so scared.

305
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

306
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,460
Hold on.

307
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,460
What's it?

308
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,000
One.

309
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,840
Two.

310
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,980
Three.

311
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,900
Four.

312
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,580
Wait.

313
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,180
One.

314
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,440
Two.

315
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,280
Three.

316
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,100
Four.

317
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,740
Space.

318
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,280
One.

319
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,600
Two.

320
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,080
Three.

321
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,480
Four.

322
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,660
There we go.

323
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,340
Okay.

324
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,880
Like that.

325
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,540
Should be it.

326
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,700
It's gonna be okay.

327
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,860
Plus you get cool pics.

328
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,400
our video.

329
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,000
Uh-oh.

330
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Uh-oh.

331
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,940
Ah-oh.

332
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,380
Ah-oh.

333
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,040
Guru guru.

334
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,660
Guru guru guru.

335
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,000
Wait.

336
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,640
Oh, I forgot that, uh...

337
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,140
The scroll.

338
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,480
The scroll does that.

339
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,120
Whoopsie.

340
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:15,900
Teeheehee.

341
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm scared.

342
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,180
Guru guru.

343
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,680
Guru guru.

344
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:22,900
Guru guru.

345
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,400
But yeah.

346
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,780
Uh-oh.

347
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.

348
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,890
But I'll be brave...

349
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,490
Maybe...

350
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,590
The retired play is something relaxing and not stressful.

351
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,250
This isn't stressful...

352
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,650
But my brain is very slow today.

353
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:48,930
I...

354
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,410
To be honest, I was like...

355
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,630
I was like...

356
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,530
Trying to figure out what to play today.

357
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,350
Because I was like...

358
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,690
I even took a nap...

359
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,170
For like over an hour.

360
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,710
I'm still so sleepy.

361
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,350
Did they give you any instructions?

362
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,570
I don't think so.

363
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,350
I probably just won't eat in the morning.

364
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,610
I'm afraid of throwing up.

365
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm so scared.

366
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm so scared!

367
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay, hold on.

368
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,880
Let me lock in.

369
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,430
It says I can do something here, but...

370
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,850
Here's the...

371
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,510
Hold on.

372
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,230
1...

373
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,350
2...

374
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,170
3...

375
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,410
1...

376
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:39,750
2...

377
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,190
3...

378
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,930
4...

379
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,070
I'm gonna assume.

380
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,170
1...

381
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,330
2...

382
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,330
1...

383
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,530
2...

384
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:44,870
3...

385
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,050
4...

386
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,950
5...

387
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,930
That's right.

388
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,410
We can assume.

389
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,990
This is stressful.

390
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,170
The column that says 3, then 8 below it, but...

391
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,030
2 were pressed, and then 5 below that.

392
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,010
Wait, what?

393
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,470
Huh?

394
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,230
You're confusing me even more!

395
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,330
It's okay, we'll get it eventually.

396
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,310
Doesn't matter.

397
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,030
Okay, 4...

398
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

399
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,850
Like that.

400
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,040
For those who don't get it...

401
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,030
It'll...

402
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,190
It'll...

403
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,790
You'll get it eventually, probably.

404
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,450
Like that.

405
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

406
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,850
A lot of it is kind of pattern recognition, you know?

407
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,230
Because...

408
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,930
You'll eventually be like, oh, if it looks like this, it has to be like this.

409
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,350
You know?

410
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,150
Thanks for getting me addicted to Meow Tower.

411
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,610
I'm almost 100% through the hard puzzles.

412
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,830
Oh my gosh!

413
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,210
I feel like...

414
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,070
I feel like...

415
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,330
I feel like I've gotten so many people addicted to Meow Tower.

416
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,010
It's my greatest...

417
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,710
It's my greatest accomplishment, maybe.

418
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,230
In Afterlife.

419
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,070
Like that.

420
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,710
They should sponsor you.

421
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,530
I know, right?

422
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,150
I know, right?

423
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,770
They should.

424
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:43,810
They should.

425
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:45,890
5...

426
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,910
7...

427
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,270
8...

428
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,270
Like that.

429
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,450
Like that.

430
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,470
Oh, wait.

431
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,010
Okay...

432
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,690
And then 2.

433
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,650
Hold on.

434
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,610
I'm gonna turn down...

435
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,490
I'm gonna turn down the clicky-clacky noise.

436
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,750
It's kind of driving me insane.

437
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,470
Sound effects, maybe?

438
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,210
Wait, this is so chill!

439
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,830
You solve these so quickly, it's kind of scary.

440
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,250
Really?

441
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,890
I feel like I'm actually quite slow.

442
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,730
Konnichiwa!

443
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,070
Naano, are you out here helping explain things?

444
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,850
I like this BGM.

445
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,730
I wanna keep it.

446
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,030
Wait, hold on.

447
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,070
Maybe...

448
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,410
Puzzle BGM 3.

449
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,650
Let's just change everything to Puzzle BGM 3.

450
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,180
This is so nice!

451
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,420
And we have completed this row.

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:07,960
Yatta!

453
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,220
Yatta!

454
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,960
Yes, yes.

455
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,580
Oh, so we've completed...

456
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,380
That row.

457
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,120
And this...

458
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
And this...

459
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,820
And this...

460
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,480
And this...

461
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,500
And this...

462
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,700
And this...

463
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,000
Close...

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,020
This...

465
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,960
Close...

466
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,420
Thank you!

467
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,900
I see a shape.

468
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,190
I see a shape forming...

469
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,580
Oop, that's not what I meant to do.

470
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,380
There we go.

471
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,020
Zeke?

472
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,340
Thank you so much for the gift of Deku!

473
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,220
Speaking of Metal Gear...

474
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,940
Oh my gosh, did you guys see...

475
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,560
The new dinosaur's name in the new Jurassic Park?

476
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,020
Little dragon, thank you so much for the supertante!

477
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,640
Thank you!

478
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,820
I was like, do they know?

479
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,360
Do they know?

480
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,180
It's called...

481
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,260
D-rex!

482
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,620
I was like, there's so many layers here!

483
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,080
D-rex...

484
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Do they know?

485
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,280
Oh...

486
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,200
I got it!

487
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Amazing!

488
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,750
Okay...

489
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,450
Wait, there we go.

490
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,010
Diamond Rex...

491
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,250
It stands for dinosaur.

492
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,710
No, no...

493
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,550
It stands for diamond...

494
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,370
Like diamond dogs...

495
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,630
Like D-dog and D-horse...

496
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,730
D-rex...

497
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,730
D-rex...

498
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,990
Welcome to the diamond dogs!

499
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,790
This works!

500
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,150
D-rex...

501
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,010
Actually, yeah...

502
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,590
I was like...

503
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,890
D-rex?

504
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,090
What...

505
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,890
This is...

506
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,870
This name!

507
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,890
This name...

508
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,770
D-rex...

509
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,750
D-rex...

510
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,410
D-rex...

511
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:19,870
D-rex...

512
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,090
D-rex...

513
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,790
D-rex...

514
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:32,710
D-rex...

515
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,730
Okay then that's for certain.

516
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,070
Then I guess it's... wait no.

517
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,500
That's for certain.

518
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,230
Doubtful Rex.

519
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,210
I was thinking the other day, I was just like, oh my gosh.

520
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:14,170
Maybe I'll play... the new Metal Gear on my...

521
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,650
Um... On my... PS5.

522
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,950
Because probably... like... I'm... 90% sure I'm gonna lag like crazy.

523
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,690
But then I remembered that I... did this special pre-order.

524
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,310
The one that uh... The one that allows you to play early a couple days.

525
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,070
I did that on Steam.

526
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,370
Aw man... I messed up.

527
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,830
I... I did a silly.

528
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,330
I like the far left column.

529
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,290
This one?

530
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,030
Why?

531
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,790
Why do you like it?

532
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,610
Okay, hold on.

533
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,840
It says I know it, but I don't know it.

534
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,640
Hmm... curious.

535
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,140
I'm curious.

536
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,060
Um... Hmm... Hmm... Like that.

537
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,800
Naruhodo!

538
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,280
Yes.

539
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,320
Yes.

540
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,060
Yes.

541
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,580
How?

542
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,360
Oh, I was looking at the wrong one.

543
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,940
Oh my goodness!

544
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,680
Oh my goodness.

545
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,380
You get it now?

546
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,280
We just have to use Chimiminto.

547
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,820
Yeah, I guess so.

548
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,300
Wait.

549
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,520
Three... This is seven.

550
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:41,900
There we go.

551
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,760
Naruhodo!

552
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,340
Hmm... Hmm...

553
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,780
What could this be?

554
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,880
It kind of looks like... a worm.

555
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,620
Maybe.

556
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,960
I mean...

557
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,320
Kind of... Hold on.

558
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm gonna... Let's see.

559
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,940
I'm gonna... Let's see.

560
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,100
Ha ha ha!

561
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,420
I'm a genius?

562
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,060
Hmm... Hmm...

563
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,180
I am a genius.

564
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,420
Yes.

565
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,080
Naruhodo!

566
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,480
Yaatta!

567
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,580
Hehehe!

568
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
Mehehehe.

569
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,700
Ehm...

570
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:17,720
Ehm...

571
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,680
Ehm... Ehm... I can't stop seeing the...

572
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,780
Eyeball of the worm.

573
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

574
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,380
Um.

575
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,300
I can't un-see it.

576
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,400
Yuh...

577
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,010
Mm hmm!

578
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,950
Sugoi!

579
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,220
I feel like I'm gonna fall asleep at any moment.

580
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
Uh-oh.

581
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,040
I feel like this is making me so sleepy.

582
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,090
Almost there!

583
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,650
Yippee!

584
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,370
It's a worm!

585
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:24,970
It's a worm!

586
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,990
It's a worm!

587
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,370
It's the Alba Madonna!

588
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,610
Let's listen to the...

589
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,090
A worm!

590
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,110
A worm!

591
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,070
Oh, I'm taking notes!

592
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Okay, that was a nice warm-up, huh?

593
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,420
Actually...

594
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,680
What size is this?

595
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,500
Oh, this is another 15x15.

596
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,320
Easy peasy!

597
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,660
Easy peasy!

598
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,880
Easy peasy!

599
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,020
You have a good memory?

600
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,320
I almost wish I had like a...

601
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,920
Photographic memory or something.

602
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,980
But...

603
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,760
Maybe you don't learn so much with just a photographic memory, you know?

604
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,520
Oh...

605
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,030
You don't retain it for long term...

606
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,360
Oh...

607
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,660
Oh, this one's super easy.

608
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,960
Yatta!

609
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,640
This one's so easy!

610
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,870
I'm all over the place, though.

611
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,630
My brain is a lint roller.

612
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,690
In...

613
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,070
In...

614
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,470
In...

615
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,230
In what way?

616
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,850
In what way?

617
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Before my membership expires, I want to say...

618
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,140
Thank you, Dr. Professor, for your...

619
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,320
Wise words.

620
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Thank you!

621
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,740
Thank you!

622
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,800
This one is complete!

623
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,660
That's right!

624
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,560
That's great!

625
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,260
Thank you!

626
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,120
Four, five, six, seven...

627
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,640
That's right!

628
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,980
Oh, we can complete...

629
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,820
That...

630
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,100
That's nice!

631
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,980
This one's very easy.

632
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,180
Do you guys see the vision yet?

633
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,560
You see the vision...

634
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:07,900
Yatta!

635
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,160
It's an apple.

636
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,220
Hmm?

637
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,960
That's right!

638
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,030
Is it an apple?

639
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,070
Place your bets?

640
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,590
I'm just double counting everything...

641
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,610
Yatta!

642
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,490
Okay.

643
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,240
Oh, boy!

644
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,300
In the sentence...

645
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,030
Ngunly...

646
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,530
THE WHO LOOK ABOUT IT.

647
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,200
Yeah, by that.

648
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,300
The Britishman!

649
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,680
Ngunly...

650
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,820
The Britishman!

651
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,140
Yes, Yatta!

652
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,680
That's right!

653
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,020
The Britishman...

654
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,240
Is it an apple?

655
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,560
Yes, man.

656
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:17,940
Yes, man!

657
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,440
Nintendo!

658
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,920
You see...

659
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,480
The Britishman.

660
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,770
Easy.

661
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,410
It's a person.

662
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,510
It's a guy.

663
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,530
It's that.

664
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,130
It's Rembrandt.

665
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,350
Rembrandt.

666
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,750
It's Rembrandt.

667
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,290
Ed Sheeran.

668
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,610
The Maestro.

669
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,550
Pro Tag Hair Stag.

670
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:16,730
Oh!

671
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,430
Oh!

672
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,630
He was just talking about his hair.

673
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:32,890
Interesting.

674
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:39,250
I did notice how the strokes of the hair looked so interesting.

675
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,530
He's kind of a child.

676
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,550
Especially here.

677
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,650
Oh!

678
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,630
I forgot what this means.

679
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,370
Oh, but I didn't finish.

680
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,430
Oh, that's what we did.

681
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,630
40 by 30.

682
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,690
That was my largest ever, ever, ever...

683
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,530
Painting that I've ever dot... or, uh, P-Cross...

684
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,630
Nonogram I've ever dot in.

685
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,310
Never done one bigger than 40 by 30.

686
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,030
It was really long.

687
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,350
Wait, I wonder if it says...

688
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,290
How long it took me...

689
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,970
Almost two hours!

690
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,890
Almost two whole hours of just that one.

691
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,910
Maybe we should do...

692
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,030
The room in the back?

693
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,350
She's trying to get me into the back rooms?

694
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,250
Wait, this one?

695
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,310
What?

696
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,550
This is the special one, eh?

697
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,970
You get the sense there's a story behind this one.

698
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,690
It's 25 by 30.

699
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,200
Let's try it.

700
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,980
This one will take me much longer because I...

701
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,640
You know...

702
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,060
Before I can be kind of used to the pa...

703
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,640
Okay, hold on.

704
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,480
We just started the stream.

705
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,740
Let me...

706
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
Have a little bit more...

707
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,620
15 by 15.

708
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,000
Give me...

709
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,640
Wait, special artworks room.

710
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,280
Maybe it's here.

711
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,580
Oh...

712
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,800
Nevermind, that is the one.

713
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,220
Oh wait...

714
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,820
Can I not?

715
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,920
F1...

716
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,320
Nevermind.

717
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,620
How do I get to another level?

718
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,040
Oh wait, I think here.

719
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,620
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.

720
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,840
Let's do 15 by 15.

721
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,020
Okay, easy.

722
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,420
I really like nonograms, you guys.

723
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,240
Ah!

724
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,840
There we go.

725
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,400
Oopsie.

726
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,140
I caught it.

727
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,480
I caught it, I caught it.

728
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,680
That was just me...

729
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,720
Going too fast.

730
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,830
The...

731
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,970
Meow Tower that I usually play...

732
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,850
Catches your mistakes...

733
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:04,950
Like immediately.

734
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,230
So if I mess up...

735
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,090
It...

736
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,290
Immediately will clock me.

737
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,870
So I'm so used to...

738
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,790
Immediately being...

739
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,130
Immediately...

740
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,910
Immediate...

741
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,390
Uh...

742
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,290
What's the word?

743
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,710
I'm used to the immediate...

744
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,150
Um...

745
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,910
Feedback.

746
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,350
I prefer when it doesn't do that.

747
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,530
Me too, honestly.

748
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,890
I wish you could turn it off.

749
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,730
Especially because it also kind of has like a grading system.

750
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,710
Um...

751
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,470
So...

752
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,830
If you mess up so many times...

753
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,650
And sometimes it's not even me messing up.

754
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,050
Sometimes it's me like...

755
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,490
Miss clicking, you know?

756
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,730
Like uh...

757
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,390
Like I know it's the wrong thing.

758
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,050
I just...

759
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,510
My hand slipped or something.

760
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,090
You know?

761
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,070
Yeah...

762
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,050
But...

763
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,950
It...

764
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,610
There's one?

765
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,390
Oh my gosh.

766
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,350
It was the...

767
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,990
Hatsune Miku one.

768
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,450
It's so unforgiving.

769
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,410
Because...

770
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,120
Um...

771
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,760
Two...

772
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,360
One...

773
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,140
Two...

774
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,860
Uh...

775
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,500
Because...

776
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,880
It also costs...

777
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,200
Like you have stamina to play and everything.

778
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,100
I hate that too.

779
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,480
No...

780
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,360
Have no idea how to play PCOS, but this stream has two cute girls.

781
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,860
So...

782
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Respect.

783
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,760
Maitake, Maitake, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu!

784
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,340
Thank you!

785
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
Miku PCOS 2 next week.

786
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,920
Maitake, Maitake, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu!

787
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,900
There we go.

788
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,560
Really?

789
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,560
They're making another one?

790
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,900
Let's go.

791
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
This one's pretty easy too.

792
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,280
I say that if...

793
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,480
I don't know if I'm messing up.

794
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,580
Huh...

795
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,360
I don't know if I'm messing up.

796
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,320
Who knows?

797
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,200
Who knows?

798
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,360
Who knows?

799
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,460
Who knows?

800
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,780
Huh...

801
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,440
See ya!

802
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,230
Three or two!

803
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,310
Who knows?

804
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:20,870
Not me.

805
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:21,850
Huh...

806
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,210
I don't mean to do that one.

807
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:46,870
There we go.

808
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,370
Okay...

809
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:52,970
Three...

810
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,490
Two...

811
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,950
I'm literally on autopilot right now.

812
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,690
I can't tell if this is right at all.

813
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:08,690
Oh, okay.

814
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,950
Logite art grimoire by the same dev has grid nonograms and some cool...

815
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,670
Metal games.

816
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,170
King Charles Spaniel.

817
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,730
There's a dog!

818
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,510
See that Picross crime slash Ace Attorney like any...

819
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,230
I have seen that!

820
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:25,730
I wanna...

821
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,110
Oh my gosh, look at how stinking cute King Charles Spaniel is.

822
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,330
You knew it was a dog?

823
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,710
I can never... I'm so focused on the puzzle!

824
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,610
I can't never tell.

825
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,110
I can't even tell what it is until I'm done.

826
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:10,110
I can't even tell what it is until I'm done.

827
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,790
Oh my gosh, an artist that knows how to paint a dog!

828
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,450
Wow!

829
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,410
Wow.

830
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,570
An artist that knows that dogs look like dogs and not human.

831
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,070
I can see it.

832
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,420
Hold on.

833
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,160
There we go.

834
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,860
Sorry, I'm fixing something.

835
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,700
There we go.

836
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,300
Well, we did three 15x15s.

837
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,540
Have you seen Superman?

838
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,380
No.

839
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,740
I don't usually go to the movies.

840
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,020
I also don't watch...

841
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,540
Uh...

842
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,520
Superhero movies.

843
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,560
Shall we do the special one?

844
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,000
Corona is that breed of dog.

845
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,300
A spaniel?

846
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,400
I have no idea.

847
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,270
So tired of comic book films.

848
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,030
I think...

849
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,470
a lot of people are.

850
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,350
I think a lot of people are.

851
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,190
I think a lot of people are.

852
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,830
I usually...

853
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,430
If there's a movie I want to watch, I wait until it's on the plane.

854
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,670
And then I'm still waiting for the Minecraft movie to be on the plane.

855
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,190
So I can watch it.

856
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,490
It's like I spend so much money for a plane ticket.

857
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,290
And it's...

858
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,090
It's really instead a movie theater visit.

859
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,510
But there are so few superhero movies.

860
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,710
I bet you would catch up in no time.

861
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,110
The last superhero movie I watched...

862
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,670
Besides falling asleep to Deadpool Wolverine.

863
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,690
I tried watching that.

864
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,550
I fell asleep.

865
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,370
Literally at the beginning of the movie.

866
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:15,330
Um...

867
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,390
But the last movie I watched was...

868
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,110
Then probably...

869
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,430
When the first Iron Man came out.

870
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,470
Yeah.

871
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,260
Yeah, I think that's the last one I watched.

872
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,800
A long time ago.

873
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,700
I told you, I don't go watch superhero movies.

874
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,100
Well...

875
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,220
Wait.

876
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,960
When did Captain America come out?

877
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,460
Because I watched that first one too.

878
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,740
America.

879
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,160
No, movie...

880
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,860
Movie one.

881
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,940
2011.

882
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,120
And then...

883
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,040
Iron Man.

884
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,500
Movie one.

885
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,040
2008.

886
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,020
Okay, so then maybe Captain America was the last one I watched.

887
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,540
Wait.

888
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,920
I think?

889
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,980
I think I watched it.

890
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,940
I feel like I watched it.

891
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,780
I don't remember anything that happens in it though.

892
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,860
He gets frozen, right?

893
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,640
Yeah?

894
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,010
Yeah, at the end.

895
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:51,630
Okay.

896
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,010
Oh, that's a spoiler.

897
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,350
Wait, how is that spoilers?

898
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:55,970
Is that...

899
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,090
That are not...

900
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,750
Exactly what you know about...

901
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,530
Captain America?

902
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,010
Okay.

903
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,690
We're gonna do a 25 by 30, guys.

904
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,810
This might be the rest of the stream.

905
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,820
Okay.

906
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,780
Holy moly.

907
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,250
Five...

908
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,470
I'm already...

909
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,750
I'm already getting...

910
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,410
Jumbled.

911
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:26,690
Five...

912
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,150
One...

913
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,550
Two...

914
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:27,850
Three...

915
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,130
Four...

916
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,470
Five...

917
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,090
One...

918
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:33,490
One...

919
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:34,750
Two...

920
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:34,990
Three...

921
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,450
Wait, can I put a...

922
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,790
Okay, I can put this.

923
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,070
One...

924
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:40,690
Two...

925
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,190
Three...

926
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,570
Four...

927
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,030
Five...

928
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,410
Six...

929
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:42,870
Seven...

930
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,210
Eight...

931
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:43,670
Nine...

932
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,390
Ten...

933
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,590
Okay.

934
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,230
One...

935
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,670
Two...

936
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,030
Three...

937
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,510
Four...

938
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,110
Five...

939
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:48,950
Six...

940
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,290
Seven...

941
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:49,650
Eight...

942
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,090
Nine...

943
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,890
Ten...

944
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,310
20...

945
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:58,790
What was it?

946
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,430
25 by 30 or something?

947
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:01,830
Five...

948
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:02,230
Ten...

949
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,710
Fifteen...

950
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,030
Twenty...

951
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,370
Twenty...

952
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,630
Five...

953
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,990
Ten...

954
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,570
Fifteen...

955
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,070
Twenty...

956
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:06,630
Okay, yes.

957
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,310
Okay, so this is...

958
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,550
One...

959
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:13,350
One...

960
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,310
One...

961
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:14,550
Two...

962
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:14,930
Three...

963
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:15,330
Four...

964
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,750
Five...

965
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,430
Five...

966
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,110
One...

967
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:22,370
Two...

968
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:22,690
Three...

969
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,170
Four...

970
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,170
There we go.

971
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,090
Ahh...

972
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,110
Seventeen...

973
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,730
Maybe somewhere in the middle, no?

974
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,220
They had to Photoshop Chris Evans to be skinny in Captain America, what?

975
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,900
What do you mean?

976
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,600
What?

977
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,640
It's melting my brain.

978
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,100
Me too.

979
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,380
It's a little gun shooting.

980
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,710
Fifteen...

981
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,270
Sixteen...

982
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,830
Seventeen...

983
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,990
Five...

984
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,890
Ten...

985
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,310
Fi...

986
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,210
Fifteen...

987
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,010
Sixteen...

988
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:07,550
Seventeen...

989
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,230
Um...

990
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,810
Um...

991
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,390
Like that.

992
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,190
So then, would this be like this?

993
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,170
It seems to be the case.

994
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,110
Five...

995
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,150
Ten...

996
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,890
Fifteen...

997
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:19,150
Sixteen...

998
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,030
Yeah, yeah, okay.

999
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,170
And so...

1000
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,850
And so...

1001
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,290
Five...

1002
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,710
Five...

1003
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,450
Like that.

1004
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,520
Hum-hum...

1005
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,560
Hum-hum...

1006
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,630
Two...

1007
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,030
Three...

1008
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,370
Four...

1009
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,050
Five...

1010
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:35,450
Three...

1011
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,290
Now we're cooking.

1012
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,050
You sound tired?

1013
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,950
I am tired, but I'm also concentrated.

1014
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,890
Uh, I really didn't know what to do today.

1015
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,050
Okay.

1016
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:52,910
So I'm sorry that it's, you know, just me being like... Puzzle Cam.

1017
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,960
Mince more into Rich Evans than Chris Evans.

1018
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,460
Chris Evans is Captain America.

1019
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,740
Wait.

1020
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,700
There's another Evans, no?

1021
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,140
Oh, who's the other Evans?

1022
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,400
That's not Rich Evans.

1023
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,760
Who isn't into Rich Evans?

1024
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,360
So true.

1025
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,140
Chris Evans' real name.

1026
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,550
There's another Chris.

1027
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,770
Oh, maybe I'm thinking of Chris then.

1028
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,970
Because there's another Chris in the cinematic universes.

1029
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:50,430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

1030
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,450
Okay, that actually knocked out a ton.

1031
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,490
Oh, oh.

1032
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,210
I misread.

1033
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,090
I misread.

1034
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:01,790
Okay.

1035
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,220
Chris Hemsworth.

1036
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1037
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,440
He is...

1038
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,100
Thor.

1039
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,960
Loki is Chris, too?

1040
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,800
No, Loki is...

1041
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,660
Cumberbatch.

1042
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,080
1, 2, 3, 4...

1043
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,860
Chris...

1044
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,600
Chris...

1045
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,180
What's his name?

1046
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:33,900
Not Chris.

1047
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,280
No.

1048
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,540
Benedict Cumberbatch.

1049
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,660
No?

1050
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,520
I'm wrong?

1051
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,380
Oh, Tom.

1052
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,880
Thomas Hiddleston.

1053
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,840
Hiddleston.

1054
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,040
Hiddleston.

1055
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,660
I said it with such confidence, too.

1056
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,520
Cumberbatch is Dr. Strange.

1057
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,020
I'll never understand any of this.

1058
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,700
7, 8, 9.

1059
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,620
I swear...

1060
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,680
I'll never understand...

1061
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,920
2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1062
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,720
5, 6, 7, 8.

1063
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,920
It's not worth understanding.

1064
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,240
Chris Pratt is Star-Lord.

1065
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,560
That is...

1066
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,680
Guardians of the Galaxy.

1067
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,170
I know, I know.

1068
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,020
He's Mario, unfortunately.

1069
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,520
Yeah.

1070
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,080
I know that, too.

1071
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1072
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1073
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,710
I was like...

1074
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,290
I was about to say, did I mess up?

1075
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,070
Oh my gosh, I was so scared for a second.

1076
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,380
Okay, nice.

1077
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,240
We got a side.

1078
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,960
That's always...

1079
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,200
That's always a good thing to get.

1080
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,360
Yeah.

1081
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,090
I believed in you.

1082
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,490
Yeah!

1083
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,390
Just joined.

1084
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,490
Is this Minesweeper?

1085
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,210
Mm-hmm.

1086
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,410
And if I get it wrong, we all explode.

1087
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:17,430
I put a little bit of ectoplasm inside each and every one of your brains.

1088
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,730
And if I get it wrong...

1089
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,990
I will activate that ectoplasm.

1090
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,170
So that...

1091
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,070
Isn't every single person here...

1092
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:31,590
Goes...

1093
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,510
Keep nono grabbing, but it explodes.

1094
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:42,930
Luckily...

1095
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,390
I'm...

1096
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,150
I'm...

1097
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,350
I'm pretty good at this.

1098
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1099
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,410
Luckily, you have nothing to worry about.

1100
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,350
You would trust me.

1101
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,410
Or you would trust your life...

1102
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,030
In my hand.

1103
00:54:59,330 --> 00:54:59,890
Right?

1104
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,250
You would.

1105
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,790
You would.

1106
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,960
This is probably like that.

1107
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:13,860
And then...

1108
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,440
Like that.

1109
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1110
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,780
I hope that's right.

1111
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,240
Or else we're...

1112
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,000
Going out!

1113
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,320
We're going to hell, baby!

1114
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,500
Oh my gosh.

1115
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,200
Have you guys seen that ride at Disneyland?

1116
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,480
Okay.

1117
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,800
It's called...

1118
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,710
I always confuse it with the Mr. Bones Wild Ride.

1119
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,030
It's, uh...

1120
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,470
Mr. Toad's...

1121
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,490
Wacky Bizarre Adventure or something.

1122
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:48,450
Wait.

1123
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,830
Mr. Toad Ride.

1124
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,270
Mr....

1125
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,010
Oh, it is Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1126
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:55,830
Wait.

1127
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,910
What's Mr. Bones?

1128
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,490
Wacky Bizarre Adventure or something.

1129
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,570
See you guys at Respawn.

1130
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:03,990
Trust in Minto.

1131
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:05,210
Yeah.

1132
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,970
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1133
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,610
I've never seen the movie.

1134
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,290
Mr. Bones is the rollercoaster tycoon map.

1135
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:16,750
Yeah, yeah.

1136
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,790
Is it also called Mr. Bones Wild Ride?

1137
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:20,350
Okay.

1138
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,550
So basically, I'm going to describe to you...

1139
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,190
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1140
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:30,410
And Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is...

1141
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,270
Okay.

1142
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,930
So...

1143
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,490
I've never seen the movie, like I said.

1144
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,290
But you...

1145
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,050
I don't know.

1146
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,710
You are in a car.

1147
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,250
And you're like...

1148
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:43,850
Beep, beep.

1149
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:44,750
Broop, broop.

1150
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:45,910
I'm Mr. Toad.

1151
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,270
And I'm driving here.

1152
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,410
And you're driving, you're driving, you're driving.

1153
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:50,970
And then...

1154
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,670
This is the ride, okay?

1155
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:53,410
You're driving.

1156
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,450
And you're getting into all sorts of shenanigans.

1157
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,990
You're crashing into people.

1158
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,310
You almost get run over by a train.

1159
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,430
You are...

1160
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,350
You are on the wildest ride of your life.

1161
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,190
And then...

1162
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,230
And then...

1163
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,870
You have to pay for your crimes.

1164
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,850
And so you go to court...

1165
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,350
And you are sentenced...

1166
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:13,670
Guilty!

1167
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:14,790
And you are...

1168
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:15,930
Sentenced to death.

1169
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,010
And then at the end of the ride...

1170
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,310
You get sent to hell.

1171
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,190
And then it ends.

1172
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,640
And so...

1173
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,940
At the end of the ride...

1174
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,420
You are driving around in hell.

1175
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,380
And then it ends.

1176
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,060
The end.

1177
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,980
Sounds like a fever dream.

1178
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,440
No, it's a wild ride.

1179
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,240
It's so... It's such a funny ride, no?

1180
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,040
Oh, wait.

1181
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,300
Oh, one, two, I can't count.

1182
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,720
I was right the first time.

1183
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,540
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1184
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,220
But I've never seen the movie, so I really actually... I feel like it's a good advertisement for it, no?

1185
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,540
Because it makes you want to be like... What is this about?

1186
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,860
This one's so confusing.

1187
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,400
I should probably lock in, huh?

1188
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,640
Or else I'm gonna get...

1189
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:22,880
Stupid.

1190
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,260
One?

1191
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,840
Okay, five, ten.

1192
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,570
Five, ten, eleven, twelve.

1193
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:39,970
Wait.

1194
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,750
It has to be this.

1195
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,590
It has to be that, no?

1196
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,030
One, two, three, wait.

1197
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:53,630
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1198
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,170
Like that?

1199
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,070
Is that right?

1200
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,550
I can't count!

1201
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:03,950
I can't count.

1202
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,600
Makes you go, what the F is this?

1203
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,500
I must know more.

1204
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,080
Apparently he never dies in the movie.

1205
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,540
Then why are we in hell?

1206
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,720
In the ride!

1207
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,260
Why are we in hell in the ride?

1208
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,680
Press C?

1209
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,000
Ah, I forgot about this!

1210
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

1211
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,120
I completely forgot about this feature.

1212
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,840
Ah, thank you!

1213
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,880
Thank you!

1214
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,640
Thank you!

1215
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,080
Thank you!

1216
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,840
Okay, so here's an example of like a tricky part, right?

1217
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,320
So it's one, two, five.

1218
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,400
You could assume...

1219
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,140
You can't assume in this game because...

1220
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,360
Guys, this could be one, and then two here, and then five.

1221
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,660
Or, it could be five, where you connect this, and then two, and then one.

1222
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,390
It's, it's very...

1223
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,180
It's very, very tricky.

1224
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,460
Okay.

1225
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,520
And we just...

1226
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,000
Figured it out.

1227
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,600
And we just...

1228
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,260
We just...

1229
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,320
We just figured it out.

1230
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,780
The trick...

1231
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,120
Is in the possibilities.

1232
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:37,950
Two.

1233
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:39,590
Yes.

1234
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,970
I feel like one...

1235
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,830
Oh, okay.

1236
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,730
So this should be 11.

1237
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:49,330
Yeah.

1238
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,270
Okay, nice!

1239
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:51,910
Nice, nice, nice.

1240
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,630
One.

1241
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,390
How far is 10?

1242
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,930
If Doom has taught me anything, you just...

1243
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,750
You don't need to die to go to hell.

1244
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,150
You just need to be angry in that.

1245
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,570
I was looking at...

1246
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,330
I don't wanna...

1247
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,910
The new Nothing Phone.

1248
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,010
Have you guys seen it?

1249
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:12,730
The Nothing Phone 3?

1250
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:14,670
I even...

1251
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:14,730
I even...

1252
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,170
There was even an ad for it.

1253
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,110
In Japan.

1254
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,530
But, um...

1255
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,570
There's...

1256
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,270
There's like...

1257
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,450
I...

1258
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,290
I'm kind of a sucker for like...

1259
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,610
Phones with gimmicks, you know?

1260
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,430
The what?

1261
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:29,710
It's the Nothing Phone!

1262
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,110
It's the Nothing Phone!

1263
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,830
It's got like no stupid bloatware on it or anything.

1264
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,930
And, uh...

1265
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,450
Um...

1266
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:47,710
What's the gimmick?

1267
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,730
I'm about to tell you.

1268
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,610
So the...

1269
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,130
It has a little gimmick on it.

1270
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:52,670
Or on the back of the phone.

1271
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:53,910
Um...

1272
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,330
On the top right...

1273
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:56,950
Part of the screen.

1274
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,330
Or the...

1275
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:58,610
The...

1276
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,230
Not the screen.

1277
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,210
The back of the phone.

1278
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,110
There's a tiny little like...

1279
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:03,270
Pixel circle.

1280
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,050
And you can...

1281
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,550
Put apps on it.

1282
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,290
Like...

1283
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,970
You can put like a spin the bottle app on it.

1284
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,750
Or a timer on it.

1285
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:13,410
Or...

1286
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,470
Um...

1287
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,450
You can even use it as like...

1288
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,630
A tiny...

1289
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:18,890
Pixelated...

1290
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,290
Pixelated...

1291
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:21,950
Uh...

1292
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:22,470
Camera?

1293
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,790
If you're like using the back...

1294
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,910
Camera to try and take a selfie.

1295
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:31,150
And the reason I brought it up is because...

1296
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,810
I saw a comment...

1297
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,610
Of someone saying...

1298
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:36,050
How long is it going to take...

1299
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,590
Before they put Doom on this tiny...

1300
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,610
On the tiny screen!

1301
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,110
And you know what?

1302
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,110
Valid question.

1303
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,550
No time at all.

1304
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:51,310
I know, right?

1305
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,490
Flip phones had this feature in 2007.

1306
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,330
Yeah, but we've regressed with phones a lot.

1307
01:02:59,630 --> 01:02:59,970
You know?

1308
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,230
We truly have.

1309
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,670
See?

1310
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:07,870
This could be one, one.

1311
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,710
And then two.

1312
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:09,510
And then...

1313
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,110
Another two.

1314
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:10,770
And then five.

1315
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,770
So we cannot trust.

1316
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,230
Hmm...

1317
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,450
We used to have so many cool features on phones.

1318
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,810
And now every phone is the same.

1319
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,410
So that's why I think I get so excited over like...

1320
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,470
A little gimmick like that.

1321
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:27,630
Spin the bottle app.

1322
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,190
Feeling old.

1323
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,970
I remember when actual bottles were a thing.

1324
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,710
I was gonna say...

1325
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,250
You remember when actual spin the bottle was a thing?

1326
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,190
Because, uh...

1327
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,730
Wow, you did...

1328
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,010
You played spin the bottle?

1329
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,830
What are you, a Riaju or something?

1330
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,570
Hmm...

1331
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:44,830
Riaju.

1332
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,230
Playing spin the bottle.

1333
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:51,490
One...

1334
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,630
One...

1335
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,110
Two...

1336
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,310
Three...

1337
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:55,470
Four...

1338
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,310
Wait, hold on.

1339
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,110
It was here, right?

1340
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:57,870
Oh no, it was here.

1341
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:00,770
One...

1342
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,190
Two...

1343
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,870
Three...

1344
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:02,610
Four...

1345
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,070
Five...

1346
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:03,430
Six...

1347
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,910
Seven...

1348
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:04,270
Eight...

1349
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:04,730
Nine...

1350
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,630
Ten...

1351
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,410
Wait, what were bottles invented?

1352
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,430
No one actually played spin the bottle?

1353
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,010
It was a meme?

1354
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:17,150
You're gonna tell me next that...

1355
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,870
Seven minutes in heaven wasn't real either.

1356
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,980
You're gonna tell me that...

1357
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,800
Nobody ever did seven minutes in heaven either.

1358
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,120
We can make it real?

1359
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,580
We can make it real?

1360
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,520
Ooh, that lot!

1361
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,080
Sucker for gimmicks reminds me I have to...

1362
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,000
Still get myself a play date.

1363
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,240
Gameboy with a crank is the gimmick.

1364
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,680
Haha!

1365
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,360
Wait, I don't know that.

1366
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,560
Sorry Mint, they don't actually go to heaven.

1367
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,160
You know, from my experience, that might be for the best.

1368
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:56,240
Huh?

1369
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:01,350
Let's see...

1370
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,410
Two...

1371
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,470
One...

1372
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,990
Wait, two...

1373
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,850
One...

1374
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,270
Space...

1375
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,470
Eight...

1376
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,150
Nine...

1377
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:11,250
Okay.

1378
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,770
Play date actually has some good games on it too?

1379
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:18,330
Really?

1380
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,470
Wait, I've never heard of this thing.

1381
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:20,950
I don't know.

1382
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,870
How have I never heard?

1383
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:27,030
Yes...

1384
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,510
One...

1385
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:29,930
One...

1386
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:30,970
One...

1387
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:31,310
Two...

1388
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,270
Three...

1389
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:33,230
Four...

1390
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,070
Five...

1391
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:34,510
Oh my goodness.

1392
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,190
And now we have eight here.

1393
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,240
Wait...

1394
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,480
Like that?

1395
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,340
And we can get rid of that.

1396
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,160
So far, this one's not as...

1397
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,740
As evil as the one before.

1398
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,560
Better to be with Minto than be in heaven.

1399
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,820
No, don't say that.

1400
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,980
Unique indie handheld.

1401
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:09,660
Whoa!

1402
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,960
This looks like a hand.

1403
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,980
Maybe.

1404
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,300
One...

1405
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:20,440
Space.

1406
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:27,940
Nice.

1407
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,900
I'm gonna check if there's any mistakes.

1408
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:33,340
Just wait.

1409
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,360
I'm a genius.

1410
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,020
I'm a genius.

1411
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:38,540
I'm a genius.

1412
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:38,700
I'm a genius.

1413
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:42,640
Nice.

1414
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,100
Stars.

1415
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,240
Win with Minto.

1416
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,220
I'm in heaven.

1417
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,620
Stop!

1418
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,380
Stop!

1419
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,460
Stop!

1420
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:54,740
Stop!

1421
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,660
Stop!

1422
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,000
You're just making fun of me.

1423
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:23,180
Wait.

1424
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,300
I think I messed this up.

1425
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,740
Yeah, there we go.

1426
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,080
That should be right.

1427
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,800
I hope...

1428
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,280
I hope...

1429
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,820
She doesn't believe us.

1430
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,200
I...

1431
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,120
I...

1432
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,560
I...

1433
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,060
Don't believe many things.

1434
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,840
But I do believe in ghosts.

1435
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,580
And I should do.

1436
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,330
How am I supposed to know this?

1437
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,050
Twenty.

1438
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,170
Eleven.

1439
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:06,150
One...

1440
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:06,190
Ghost?

1441
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,470
You are watching a ghost right now.

1442
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,390
I'm afraid of no ghosts.

1443
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,370
One...

1444
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:22,570
Space.

1445
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:24,230
Okay.

1446
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,030
Yeah, I did that one.

1447
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:27,770
Space...

1448
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,970
Like that, okay.

1449
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,350
Hopefully that's right.

1450
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,470
I'm scared.

1451
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:37,430
What if it's not?

1452
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,510
This one's bizarre so far.

1453
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,510
Do you believe that we love and support you?

1454
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:04,650
I

1455
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:09,860
don't know.

1456
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,150
Rose means love at first sight.

1457
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,010
Okay, but I really... I don't like this...

1458
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,590
Taste of rose.

1459
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,510
I don't think I'm alone in that either.

1460
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,970
I don't like the... You know, like if something's a rose...

1461
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:44,650
Taste.

1462
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,150
You know, like a rose tea or rose drink.

1463
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,330
Oh wait, that's the same.

1464
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:50,350
Rose...

1465
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:51,270
Rose...

1466
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,670
I don't like it.

1467
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,930
I don't believe in ghosts.

1468
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,130
There's a mass hallucination caused by gasoline.

1469
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,930
Also blue, thank you.

1470
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,810
I believe in one ghost.

1471
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,110
Thanks for showcasing this game.

1472
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,510
I love Picross likes.

1473
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,750
Thank you.

1474
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,030
Me too.

1475
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:12,690
Space.

1476
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:16,730
Can't be that.

1477
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:17,730
Okay, okay, okay.

1478
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,510
You don't like rose, but what about Jack?

1479
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,470
Oh my gosh, Titanic watch along.

1480
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:40,810
Okay.

1481
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,270
Okay, so because this one is a one...

1482
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,570
This one has to be the one...

1483
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,030
Other one.

1484
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,190
Because...

1485
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,650
It's above...

1486
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:51,450
The two.

1487
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,350
So there's no way it would be the two, you know?

1488
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,930
So we finally figured that out.

1489
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,690
We finally figured that out.

1490
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:01,310
Good, good.

1491
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,020
Isn't Turkish delight...

1492
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,680
Oh my gosh, I had Turkish delight once.

1493
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,320
And I...

1494
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,740
Hated it.

1495
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:12,880
Maybe...

1496
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,260
I didn't wait.

1497
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,480
Is it actually rose flavored?

1498
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,660
Maybe that's why I hated it.

1499
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,020
Two.

1500
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,970
Ah, hate.

1501
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:29,790
Hate it.

1502
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,830
It's like the most disappointing sweet ever.

1503
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,070
It's not a delight at all.

1504
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,690
It's such false advertising.

1505
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,390
Oh, this scared me.

1506
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,330
I was like, oh no, there's not enough room for six.

1507
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,430
Okay, so then...

1508
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,690
We can do...

1509
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:50,190
That.

1510
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,090
And that.

1511
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,990
Good, good, good, good, good.

1512
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,290
How am I supposed to know this?

1513
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,630
Oh, that's why.

1514
01:11:59,870 --> 01:11:59,990
Hold on, hold on.

1515
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:00,930
I didn't realize.

1516
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,330
I didn't seal it up.

1517
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:07,350
We're like, running out of blue spots, you know?

1518
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:26,570
Yes.

1519
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,140
We'll be sure to gift you Turkish delight.

1520
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,300
You'll watch me spit it out.

1521
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,720
Never care for Turkish disappointment.

1522
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,160
At least you know what you're getting.

1523
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,240
You know?

1524
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,880
Imagine being advertised as a Turkish delight.

1525
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,620
And it just makes you feel dread and anger.

1526
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:56,940
Oh.

1527
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,320
Oh my gosh, I was looking...

1528
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:58,720
I was...

1529
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,600
I thought I was looking at this one and being like...

1530
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,460
Oh my gosh, no.

1531
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,060
Oh no, stop.

1532
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,180
Stop.

1533
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,460
I was scared for a second.

1534
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,260
So, did a cute girl make you waffles today?

1535
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,860
Or did you get something else for breakfast?

1536
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,740
In the end...

1537
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,120
My breakfast was so disappointing.

1538
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,540
In the end, I had to have leftover pizza.

1539
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,940
It was the last of my leftover pizza.

1540
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,080
Why are you eating roses, Minky?

1541
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,080
Taste of rose...

1542
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,000
There's a...

1543
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,720
Actually, rose flavored stuff is so common though, no?

1544
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,760
I feel...

1545
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,460
Yeah, I feel like I see rose flavored things all the time.

1546
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,100
Horrible.

1547
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:10,840
I don't know.

1548
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,860
Seven...

1549
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,280
Yeah, okay.

1550
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,090
What is this?

1551
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,770
It looks like a mangled hand.

1552
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,050
I can't tell.

1553
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,710
I had leftover pizza.

1554
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,250
Besties!

1555
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,090
How do you know I didn't possess you and eat your pizza?

1556
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,050
You know?

1557
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:52,730
I'm just saying, it's more likely than you think, possession.

1558
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,730
Position.

1559
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,100
More than once.

1560
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,650
That's it!

1561
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,660
Hmm, hmm.

1562
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,900
What toppings?

1563
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,200
Do you really wanna know?

1564
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,260
You won't judge me?

1565
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,120
People get so defensive over their pizza choices.

1566
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,680
Their pizza toppings?

1567
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,580
They say, if you don't have the same topping as me...

1568
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,400
You are...

1569
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,560
Considered...

1570
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,120
The devil.

1571
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,620
No judgment, Minto?

1572
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,840
I'll judge you a little.

1573
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:35,460
Okay!

1574
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,700
I had...

1575
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,020
It was a...

1576
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,140
It was a pineapple and spinach.

1577
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:40,340
Spinach.

1578
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,200
I've been trying to eat more spinach lately.

1579
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,230
I like making spinach...

1580
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,180
And...

1581
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,200
Sesame oil.

1582
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:55,920
You know, you can...

1583
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,200
Wait.

1584
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,000
You can what?

1585
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,200
Oh, sorry.

1586
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,290
You can just ask me when someone's talking...

1587
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,880
Sulkababa's homemade pizza.

1588
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,520
That sounds yummy.

1589
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,800
Homemade pizza?

1590
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,560
Fancy.

1591
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:10,660
Fancy, fancy.

1592
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,580
I didn't...

1593
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:15,940
That's right.

1594
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,340
We did it!

1595
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,680
Oh my gosh!

1596
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,460
We actually finished a row!

1597
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,350
A row.

1598
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:29,850
Wait.

1599
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,490
Just kidding.

1600
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:31,010
Oh shoot.

1601
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:32,470
Uh...

1602
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,910
Actual undue moment.

1603
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:35,690
GULULU GULU GULU!

1604
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,010
GULU GULU GULU!

1605
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,790
Actual rewind moment.

1606
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,530
I don't know if this is a 2.

1607
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,350
Wait, actually, what is this?

1608
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,110
Yeah, see, see, see?

1609
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,350
You can never be so sure.

1610
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,910
You can never be so sure.

1611
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,670
I have no clue what's going on, but this is fire.

1612
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,530
I'm glad you like it.

1613
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,750
Glad when we can just kind of chill.

1614
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,590
Sorry, I'm very low energy today.

1615
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:13,550
I'm... oh.

1616
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,450
I'm just so scared.

1617
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,690
Oh, I'm scared.

1618
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,590
I was like, I won't cry on stream.

1619
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:26,470
I won't do it, but I'm scared.

1620
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:36,330
Ah, wait.

1621
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,930
Oh, no!

1622
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,410
Mistake!

1623
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,930
Wait, wait, grudu grudu.

1624
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:48,930
Uh-oh.

1625
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,990
Just wait a minute.

1626
01:17:59,090 --> 01:17:59,610
Here.

1627
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,670
Okay, I felt like this had to be... wait.

1628
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,250
And here.

1629
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:08,710
Oh, yeah.

1630
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:09,770
Wait, this is... wait.

1631
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,010
Eh?

1632
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:10,510
Oh?

1633
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:11,010
Eh?

1634
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:11,450
Oh?

1635
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:11,970
Eh?

1636
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:14,450
Wait.

1637
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:17,820
Oh?

1638
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:18,380
Eh?

1639
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,120
Ah.

1640
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,800
Why did I put that?

1641
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,700
Why did I put that there?

1642
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,340
Because... yeah, obviously that doesn't even equal to 8.

1643
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,120
Maybe I meant to put...

1644
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,240
This... that... and I accidentally put...

1645
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,520
The X.

1646
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,560
I do that sometimes.

1647
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,020
Then this part is also wrong, right?

1648
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:40,500
It said?

1649
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,180
Oh.

1650
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,580
Oh, I think that's why I got it wrong.

1651
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,280
Maybe I just miscounted.

1652
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,840
Oh, I think that's why I got it.

1653
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,460
That's why I got it.

1654
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,380
Oh, I think that's why I got it.

1655
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:04,520
This is a lot of Q-L... Q-O-L features that I like from a PCross.

1656
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,140
Right!

1657
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,820
It's actually so...

1658
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,040
It's so easy to get into.

1659
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,200
It's so nice.

1660
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,720
Your appointment is going to be fine.

1661
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,100
But head pats and hugs make you feel better.

1662
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:20,960
Thank you.

1663
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:21,940
I'm so scared.

1664
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,300
I've never had the tube.

1665
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,560
For those who don't know, I have a doctor's appointment for my throat tomorrow.

1666
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,780
No, it's not hot dog at all.

1667
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:33,980
Huh.

1668
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,760
It's going to be nervous.

1669
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,700
Wisps only wish Minto the best at their appointment.

1670
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,620
And that you'll come out stronger and healthier than ever.

1671
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,400
Gamba, Minto.

1672
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,700
Thank you.

1673
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,080
Ghost doctor.

1674
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,000
Yes, at the Boospital.

1675
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,360
Yes, yes.

1676
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,380
You would think.

1677
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,440
After death, things would be easier, huh?

1678
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,860
What's the point of dying if I still get sick?

1679
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,220
What's the point?

1680
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:16,190
I see.

1681
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,410
This also feels wrong.

1682
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:28,950
I'm going to get sick!

1683
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,810
I'm going to

1684
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:37,060
get sick!

1685
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,200
I'm going to get sick!

1686
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:39,920
I'm going to get sick!

1687
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,340
Huh?

1688
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,000
Maybe I just counted wrong.

1689
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:44,200
Oh?

1690
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,940
Maybe I counted...

1691
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,280
No, right?

1692
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,320
Life or death, existence is suffering...

1693
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,140
Exactly!

1694
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:54,420
Exactly!

1695
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,200
But this is impossible.

1696
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,180
I can't fit three...

1697
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,420
Oh, the two is over here!

1698
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,860
I'm a silly Willy.

1699
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,720
That's why I was so confused.

1700
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,920
The developer Jupiter Core made a lot of PCOS games, especially my Nintendo.

1701
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1702
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,220
I didn't remember that.

1703
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,460
That's what you're making.

1704
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,500
That should be that.

1705
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:40,980
What?

1706
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,620
Wait, where did the 11 go?

1707
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,440
Yes.

1708
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:49,740
I think so.

1709
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,100
I think so.

1710
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,480
I think so.

1711
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:55,920
Oh...

1712
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:02,590
That's right.

1713
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,650
There we go.

1714
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:06,970
Sure.

1715
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,430
See, it's so easy for me to accidentally click the wrong thing.

1716
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:12,230
That's great!

1717
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,890
I had camera down my throat last week.

1718
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,850
Took only 15 minutes and I slept through it.

1719
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,610
I don't think...

1720
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:19,990
I don't think I'm sleeping.

1721
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,490
I don't think so.

1722
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:23,950
Support me!

1723
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,070
Thank you!

1724
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:27,110
I think I'm gonna be...

1725
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:29,090
Awake though!

1726
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,150
Cause wouldn't they tell me?

1727
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:37,010
That...

1728
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:37,730
Um...

1729
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:38,870
I need someone to...

1730
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,870
Drive me there.

1731
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:40,330
Sorry.

1732
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,880
I'm scared!

1733
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,460
The down the mouth is too scary.

1734
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,240
I could...

1735
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,080
Reach the throat from the butt.

1736
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:06,560
So true.

1737
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,640
I think someone else had to do that too.

1738
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,760
Kind of like a two-in-one deal.

1739
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,060
I'm too scared.

1740
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,260
I don't wanna think about it.

1741
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,540
They did genius.

1742
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,810
You can do it, Bryce.

1743
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,190
I have to.

1744
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,210
That's the only thing.

1745
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,890
It's not that I can do it.

1746
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,850
It's not that I have to...

1747
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,710
Have to do it.

1748
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:53,730
No matter if I want to or not.

1749
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,010
Maybe I should...

1750
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:01,810
I don't know.

1751
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,050
I'll expose myself to more pains.

1752
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,710
It's what being a ghost is all about.

1753
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:12,650
Being in pain.

1754
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,690
I got it.

1755
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,100
Still no idea what this picture is.

1756
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,280
I believe it has to be a corner of a painting.

1757
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,260
Because what the hell?

1758
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,380
What the hell?

1759
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,800
I don't know either.

1760
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,180
I like it.

1761
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,420
Yes, yes.

1762
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,720
Amazing!

1763
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,480
Very...

1764
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,120
Very...

1765
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:50,740
Wait,

1766
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,560
this is correct, right?

1767
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,480
Nope.

1768
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,040
It's so easy...

1769
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:01,820
To be wrong.

1770
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,140
Be so confidently wrong.

1771
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:09,900
If you walk in and see the tube looks suspiciously wisp-shaped, please pay me no mind.

1772
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,220
I mean pay it, don't worry.

1773
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,240
Yeah, I wish you guys could join me.

1774
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,460
Keep me company there.

1775
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,040
Wait,

1776
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,640
it kind of looks like a person...

1777
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,140
With...

1778
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,460
Killing another person.

1779
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,860
You guys see it?

1780
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:39,100
It kind of looks like this person's dead on the ground and this person's stabbing them.

1781
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:41,920
I think.

1782
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:47,170
There's so few blues here.

1783
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,270
Wait, how can I figure...

1784
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,570
Oh wait, this is 2...

1785
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:50,410
1-1.

1786
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:51,190
Oh, here we go.

1787
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:53,610
Wait.

1788
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:54,590
I messed up.

1789
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,090
Uh-oh.

1790
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,690
Uh-oh.

1791
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:00,740
Uh-oh.

1792
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:02,450
Uh-oh.

1793
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,090
Uh-oh.

1794
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:03,570
Wait, wait.

1795
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:05,890
Wait, wait.

1796
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,830
Oh, I... I mixed up the one.

1797
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:09,570
That's right.

1798
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:10,710
There we go.

1799
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,170
Okay.

1800
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:12,870
Just click.

1801
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,150
Awesome!

1802
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,170
Someone who has been awake for a camera in this...

1803
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:19,790
In this...

1804
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,450
In this...

1805
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,510
In the...

1806
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,310
Huh?

1807
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,000
It makes me flinch.

1808
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,820
It makes me...

1809
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:40,920
It makes me...

1810
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,040
Spiritually cringe.

1811
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:44,920
Oh.

1812
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,900
Oh, I don't like that.

1813
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,000
I don't like that one bit.

1814
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,500
I'm sure you didn't either.

1815
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,980
I'm sure you also didn't like that one bit.

1816
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:12,940
I'm sure you're ready.

1817
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,860
And just like that, you're ready.

1818
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:15,560
I'm...

1819
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,260
That doesn't make me feel any better.

1820
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,240
That doesn't make...

1821
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,300
I don't think so.

1822
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,120
I feel like I might pass out actually.

1823
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:29,820
Okay...

1824
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,420
Two...

1825
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,160
One... Oh, wait, no.

1826
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,400
There we go, okay.

1827
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,780
I'm mixed.

1828
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,600
Uh, so this is four.

1829
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,140
There we go, okay.

1830
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,720
And then two and one, okay.

1831
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,140
Two...

1832
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,870
One...

1833
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,350
Two.

1834
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:10,330
Okay.

1835
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:12,470
Two.

1836
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,920
I can't... I think it's someone getting stabbed.

1837
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,360
I think it's someone getting stabbed.

1838
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,920
I believe.

1839
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,480
Get stabbed, get stabbed.

1840
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,200
I'll say.

1841
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,040
Who's that?

1842
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,080
Oh.

1843
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:45,360
... Wolfen.

1844
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:47,500
ok.

1845
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:07,050
...etsu ni it we Yeah ...

1846
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:32,810
A serious paper cut.

1847
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:34,990
Vermeer?

1848
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,750
Yeah, that's what I was thinking!

1849
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:36,450
Yeah, Vermeer!

1850
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:41,890
Oh my gosh, we do!

1851
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,570
Oh my gosh, we do!

1852
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,210
We do!

1853
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:03,790
Oh my gosh, this is the first sentence.

1854
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:09,610
So, the use of theæè¡ is wonderful, but this is the story of the story.

1855
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:16,550
At the time, the letter is a very small number of words.

1856
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:25,950
That's why, the letter is a far away from theç¸æ and aç´æ¥ to meet theç¸æ and the relationship between the two and the relationship.

1857
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,630
What was the letter?

1858
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:30,830
How was the letter?

1859
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:33,750
Do you think it's related to the story behind the world's map?

1860
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:45,610
See, I didn't even notice the map on the wall, but Vermeer has a very specific way of...

1861
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:49,770
of painting clothing and also, like...

1862
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:54,410
the... the... the brightness of the color, so I could tell.

1863
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,290
Letter from a lover?

1864
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:01,510
Ooh la la!

1865
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:03,170
You think it's steamy?

1866
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:04,950
Thanks for this chill stream.

1867
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:05,590
Had a long day.

1868
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:06,590
Not bad, just long.

1869
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:08,510
That was good that it wasn't bad.

1870
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:11,850
And this is just the speed for me.

1871
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:12,730
I love this game, too.

1872
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,190
Love all the stuff you've been up to lately.

1873
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:14,870
Take care of yourself.

1874
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,830
Thank you, Lunar!

1875
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:16,690
Thank you!

1876
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:19,110
You take it easy, too.

1877
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:24,530
I know my art.

1878
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,710
I know just a few artists.

1879
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:27,550
Yeah.

1880
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:30,810
Privet from Russia!

1881
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:36,210
Speaking of museums, be sure to visit St. Petersburg... St. Petersburg someday!

1882
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:38,070
It's one of the most beautiful cities.

1883
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:43,190
Full of museums, theaters, and other cultural attractions related to our thousand-year history!

1884
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,130
Oh!

1885
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:46,050
Spasiba!

1886
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:50,090
Thank you!

1887
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:50,950
I want to go.

1888
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:52,350
You sound so nice, right?

1889
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,410
Okay, okay, okay!

1890
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,870
Okay, okay, okay.

1891
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,210
Thank you so much!

1892
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:09,670
Yeah, what is...

1893
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,890
I actually... there was a book I read...

1894
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,670
...a long time ago.

1895
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,150
I can't remember.

1896
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,170
I can't remember...

1897
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:20,530
I can't remember...

1898
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:21,690
...what it was called.

1899
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:23,450
But it was very...

1900
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:24,530
...about...

1901
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,330
...like, uh...

1902
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,750
Vermeer's paintings, and...

1903
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,470
...um...

1904
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:29,790
It was... it was like a mystery...

1905
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:31,310
...one of those mystery-type thing...

1906
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:33,090
...like, books, where it's like...

1907
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,990
...there's a hidden meaning in the painting!

1908
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:38,210
Like, a national treasure-type thing.

1909
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,870
Oh, it might have been Chasing Vermeer!

1910
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:41,330
Hold on.

1911
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,350
Maybe?

1912
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:48,460
Maybe?

1913
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:48,560
Maybe?

1914
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,460
2004 Children's Mystery Novel.

1915
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,900
Might have been.

1916
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,580
Is that me in the painting?

1917
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,740
Might be.

1918
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:07,740
If I...

1919
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:08,980
What if I...

1920
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,380
Well, I don't look like her.

1921
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,360
Maybe I was her, and then I...

1922
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,580
...died, and then I reincarnated, and then I died again.

1923
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,780
Was Vermeer a good runner?

1924
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,080
Bust in his class!

1925
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,640
Well, you can call someone up, and you'd be like...

1926
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,020
Was your Vermeer running?

1927
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,180
Because you better go chase it!

1928
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:38,290
I live!

1929
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:38,790
I die!

1930
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,030
I live again!

1931
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:41,370
And I died.

1932
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:52,110
That one didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would.

1933
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:56,990
I guess a 25 by 30 is pretty doable for us, huh?

1934
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,710
We're that good.

1935
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,470
We're that good.

1936
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:02,610
Let's see.

1937
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,870
We could do the 25 by 15.

1938
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:08,670
Let's do that one.

1939
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:13,470
It's such a strange shape.

1940
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,290
I make it look easy.

1941
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,910
No way.

1942
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:27,010
Like I said, I feel like I'm actually quite slow at these.

1943
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,830
Because I have to do so much counting.

1944
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:33,310
Six.

1945
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,330
Five.

1946
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:37,890
Four.

1947
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,050
Four.

1948
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:40,870
Two.

1949
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:41,790
Wait, okay.

1950
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,350
One.

1951
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:43,690
Two.

1952
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,430
I should've...

1953
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:46,870
Whatever.

1954
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:47,670
Wait.

1955
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:48,730
Six.

1956
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:49,730
Ah!

1957
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,970
No, no, no!

1958
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,270
My finger slipped.

1959
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:58,950
Wait, yeah, space.

1960
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:02,430
Actually, I like to use these as the spaces.

1961
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:03,850
Space.

1962
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:06,650
Space.

1963
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,570
Space.

1964
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:11,070
Okay, so one.

1965
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:12,070
Two.

1966
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:15,370
One, two, three, four.

1967
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:19,650
Maybe?

1968
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:22,370
One, two, three, four.

1969
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:24,170
Oh, wait.

1970
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,230
Five.

1971
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:27,190
Maybe?

1972
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,200
I can't tell if that's right or not.

1973
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,540
I can't tell.

1974
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,100
You're pretty good.

1975
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,280
At these.

1976
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,520
Your pace is steady.

1977
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:46,700
Quite good, to be honest.

1978
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,140
Well, thank you.

1979
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,950
I don't have the patience for these games, but you do.

1980
01:35:58,290 --> 01:35:59,630
Oh my gosh, James Cameron.

1981
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,590
Oh my gosh.

1982
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,050
I was thinking about you earlier.

1983
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,310
Because I was...

1984
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:06,470
I was...

1985
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:07,510
I don't remember why.

1986
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:11,050
I think I was talking to a friend about my VOD for Deal or No Deal.

1987
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:12,730
And then I was watching it.

1988
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:15,810
And part of the part that I was watching...

1989
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,050
You told me to...

1990
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:19,490
To...

1991
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:21,270
Pick one of the boxes.

1992
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,070
And I did.

1993
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:23,690
And I think it was the million.

1994
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,680
And I was just like...

1995
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:32,190
I was like, oh my gosh, James Cameron!

1996
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:38,730
Yeah!

1997
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:46,570
I think about you guys sometimes.

1998
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:47,630
You know?

1999
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:51,330
If I'm like out and about and I see something...

2000
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,390
If I'm like haunting...

2001
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:57,290
Doing my little, you know, ghostly paranormal activities...

2002
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:00,290
I see something that reminds you of you guys.

2003
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,930
I'll be like...

2004
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:02,030
Oh my gosh!

2005
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,130
Oh my gosh, that's like so and so.

2006
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:19,170
I guess the parasocialism runs deep.

2007
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:26,250
But it's just kind of like, I wonder how they're doing.

2008
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,270
I hope they're okay.

2009
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,990
I hope they're doing well.

2010
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:33,390
You know?

2011
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:39,050
Meow.

2012
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:44,110
But, you know, because of my name, I bet you guys are thinking about me all the time, huh?

2013
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:49,590
You guys, you brush your teeth and you're just like, mint flavored toothpaste.

2014
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:53,670
Or you go to the store and you're just like, mint ice cream.

2015
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,850
I'm everywhere.

2016
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,770
I'm actually haunting.

2017
01:37:59,130 --> 01:37:59,610
For real.

2018
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:08,170
Good branding.

2019
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:12,030
Did the parasocial relationship just become social?

2020
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,370
If you rainbow... Wait, what?

2021
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,310
Don't rainbow.

2022
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,150
If I rainbow super mint, she'll come through my monitor and call me stinky.

2023
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:25,510
No, no, no.

2024
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:29,330
You're thinking of Binto, my original character.

2025
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,170
Do not steal.

2026
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:36,290
I can safely say, eating mint ice cream has never been quite the same.

2027
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:38,430
Hahaha.

2028
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:38,910
Freak.

2029
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:39,590
Hahaha.

2030
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,510
Yeah, because of the name.

2031
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:43,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2032
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,310
Hmm.

2033
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:48,890
Hmm.

2034
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:54,010
I think about you every time I look at my arm.

2035
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,230
Oh my gosh.

2036
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:56,550
Sulk in your arm.

2037
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:57,350
You're crazy.

2038
01:38:59,090 --> 01:38:59,570
Crazy.

2039
01:38:59,730 --> 01:38:59,730
Crazy.

2040
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,390
One, two, three, four, five.

2041
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,060
One, one.

2042
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:09,480
One, two, three.

2043
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,380
I think.

2044
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,320
One, one, two, three, space.

2045
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:17,000
One, two, three, four, five.

2046
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:17,480
Oh.

2047
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,160
I think?

2048
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,540
But it still says there's more.

2049
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:28,680
Actually, Bob in chocolate ice cream the other day and was thinking of you.

2050
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:29,980
How are you spying on us?

2051
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:30,700
I'm a ghost.

2052
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:31,760
It's like my duty.

2053
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,380
It's my job.

2054
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,600
I had to cancel my food delivery because the store closed before they kick up a driver.

2055
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,660
I ordered it at the start of stream.

2056
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,240
What?

2057
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,880
So I'm going to cook something instead so you can have the...

2058
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,160
No!

2059
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:49,080
Phil!

2060
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:50,880
What?

2061
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,780
That sucks so much though.

2062
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,460
They're forcing you to be... to be responsible.

2063
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,280
Wait, hold on.

2064
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,040
Mint flavor stuff burns hotter than sriracha.

2065
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:09,960
Is that like the same gene that makes it so that you hate?

2066
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:14,510
What's that?

2067
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:15,810
What's that one plant?

2068
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:15,910
What's that one plant?

2069
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:18,270
It's not...

2070
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,130
It's, uh...

2071
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:22,970
Cilantro!

2072
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:24,730
I was like, parsley?

2073
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:27,190
Yes, the cilantro!

2074
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:30,830
Raise your hand if you have that.

2075
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:32,290
If you can't eat cilantro.

2076
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,950
Nadine's technically wrong about the chair.

2077
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:44,510
Upholstery often use a polished brass capable of bright reflection.

2078
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,110
So wait, hold on.

2079
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:46,770
That's so interesting.

2080
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:48,150
So as long...

2081
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:51,470
Sorry, every time I click out of the window, it stops the music.

2082
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:55,810
So as long as the sun shone directly on it through a window...

2083
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:58,930
I've seen it with my own eye.

2084
01:40:59,230 --> 01:40:59,630
Really?

2085
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:03,610
Upholstery often used a polished brass.

2086
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:05,930
You're just...

2087
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:08,830
You get flash banged by your chair.

2088
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:09,810
It would suck.

2089
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:15,090
I feel like I'm not doing this one quite right.

2090
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,230
But this would be one.

2091
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:20,050
One, two, three, four, five.

2092
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,730
Okay, maybe...

2093
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:23,370
Maybe...

2094
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:25,630
Um...

2095
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:26,590
Two, space.

2096
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,230
Two, space.

2097
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:30,350
One, two, three, space.

2098
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:32,470
One...

2099
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,170
Space.

2100
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,530
One, two, space.

2101
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:35,630
One, two, space.

2102
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:38,470
One, two, space.

2103
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:38,710
One, two, space.

2104
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:39,590
One, two, space.

2105
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,870
I don't understand this one.

2106
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:41,930
This one's def...

2107
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:42,490
Tricky.

2108
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:43,650
Because of the...

2109
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:45,530
I don't like when they're not as square.

2110
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:49,270
I wish I could enjoy cilantro.

2111
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,010
No!

2112
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,530
It's wideness is overwhelming.

2113
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:54,990
I know!

2114
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:57,810
Why'd I get flash banged by Minto?

2115
01:41:58,170 --> 01:41:58,530
Stop.

2116
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:01,110
Stop!

2117
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,940
This one confuses me.

2118
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,360
What am I missing?

2119
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,260
What am I doing wrong?

2120
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:11,980
Six.

2121
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,500
One, two, three, four, five.

2122
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,640
One, two, three, four.

2123
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,480
One, two, one.

2124
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,800
One, one, two.

2125
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:23,540
One, two, three, four.

2126
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,280
One, two, three, four, five.

2127
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,960
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2128
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,040
I suppose.

2129
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:42,360
Would you rather play Sudoku for all eternity or eat a bowl of cilantro?

2130
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,100
I can eat cilantro.

2131
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,880
So give me that cilantro, baby.

2132
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:47,920
Oh my gosh.

2133
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:48,840
I've heard of people.

2134
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,360
So there, you know, people will...

2135
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,100
Oh!

2136
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,280
Midcuts from Ayami's booth!

2137
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,180
Yay!

2138
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,160
Oh my gosh.

2139
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,300
Thank you for ordering, Barely.

2140
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:07,780
I love that thing where you say or do something IRL and you can instantly picture the chat's reactions.

2141
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,880
No, I don't want to think about that.

2142
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,940
I don't want to think about you guys perceiving me at all like that.

2143
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,420
That's way too embarrassing.

2144
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,700
But, um, going back to the eat a bowl of cilantro.

2145
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,920
There are some people that are like, that are like, I'm not good at eating my veggies.

2146
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,220
Not just veggies.

2147
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,500
I'm not good at eating my leafy greens.

2148
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,900
And so what they've done is they...

2149
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:31,520
Just look how...

2150
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:31,920
Oh my gosh.

2151
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:34,900
I'm blocking her, but she's so cute when she stares at the puzzle.

2152
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,220
Um, what they've done is they...

2153
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,010
To make it so that they...

2154
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,320
Will eat their leafy greens.

2155
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,180
They call it Dinosaur Time.

2156
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,920
And they pretend that they are a dinosaur.

2157
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,080
And they eat their...

2158
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,400
And apparently it really helps.

2159
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,890
It's kind of awesome.

2160
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:11,990
Just like tree stars.

2161
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:15,570
I mean, they made the tree stars look so delicious.

2162
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:18,430
They made them seem so delicious in the Land Before Time.

2163
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:20,590
I feel like it has to work.

2164
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,060
Dinosaur Time.

2165
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:27,920
Dino Time.

2166
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,040
Dinosaur Time.

2167
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:29,100
That's...

2168
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,060
That's my...

2169
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,720
Life and afterlife hack.

2170
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,420
Let's see.

2171
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:34,900
One.

2172
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:35,840
One.

2173
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:37,580
One, two, three, four.

2174
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:37,880
Okay.

2175
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,440
So it has to be...

2176
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:39,640
One.

2177
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,320
One, two, three, four.

2178
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,080
But is it one, one?

2179
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,040
Or...

2180
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:51,630
Tricky.

2181
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:53,150
Okay.

2182
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:54,110
So if I did...

2183
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:56,870
I think like...

2184
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:57,790
One, space.

2185
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,490
One, two, three, four.

2186
01:44:59,490 --> 01:44:59,570
Dinosaur.

2187
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:00,350
Yeah.

2188
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,130
Yeah.

2189
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:01,970
Yeah.

2190
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:02,950
Yeah.

2191
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,470
This one is so long.

2192
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:06,970
Confuses me.

2193
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:10,410
I'd eat a dinosaur.

2194
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,730
Don't do that.

2195
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,730
It's probably really...

2196
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:15,410
Tough.

2197
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,170
What do you mean pretend?

2198
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,930
Nah.

2199
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:25,170
You can put an X there.

2200
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:25,810
Wait, where?

2201
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:44,110
Under there?

2202
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:45,370
Under there?

2203
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:45,470
Under where?

2204
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:51,790
We eat T-Rex's ancestors all the time.

2205
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:52,270
True.

2206
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:57,010
The hard ones are because of all the small numbers.

2207
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,410
Yeah, that can be the case.

2208
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:08,250
She said underwear.

2209
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:13,150
I tricked the streamer into saying a silly word.

2210
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:18,390
Oh, this one confuses me.

2211
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,170
Two.

2212
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:20,830
Ah.

2213
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:21,730
Ah.

2214
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:23,170
Ah.

2215
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:25,170
Ah.

2216
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,050
Ah.

2217
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,620
What is this?

2218
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,120
Nothing.

2219
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:38,680
Click on it.

2220
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:39,240
It does nothing.

2221
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,860
Blue row.

2222
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,840
You can mark the second tile as an X.

2223
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:48,280
Second.

2224
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:48,900
What?

2225
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:49,460
This one.

2226
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:49,740
Why?

2227
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:49,900
Why?

2228
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,960
But how?

2229
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,180
Hmm.

2230
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:12,520
Would missing a stream because of an ecchi convention be considered excused apps?

2231
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:14,620
Wait.

2232
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,060
What?

2233
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,140
What's an ecchi convention?

2234
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,700
Will you take Minto along?

2235
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:28,180
Wait.

2236
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,160
Second from the right.

2237
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,340
Wait.

2238
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,000
Did I get it wrong?

2239
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:40,660
This?

2240
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:41,440
That's right.

2241
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:50,810
I believe you.

2242
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:52,410
I just don't know how you got it at all.

2243
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:59,320
It's an 18 plus anime convention.

2244
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:02,180
They have those?

2245
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:06,300
I was lurking whilst exercising.

2246
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:07,420
Can I go make dinner now?

2247
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:08,240
Have a good dinner!

2248
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:14,060
It's either two or one at the end.

2249
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:14,280
Yeah.

2250
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,700
So we can't mark anything else.

2251
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,680
But we can do that.

2252
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,360
Oh my gosh.

2253
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,080
We only have one row that's blue.

2254
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:21,700
Hold on.

2255
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,080
Okay.

2256
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,720
Only one row that's blue.

2257
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,040
I hate this.

2258
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:30,820
Two.

2259
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:45,010
So let's just assume this is...

2260
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,150
One.

2261
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:51,910
I think we have to assume.

2262
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:53,810
In that case.

2263
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:55,170
One.

2264
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,770
One, two, three.

2265
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:01,670
One, two, three.

2266
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:01,810
One, one, one.

2267
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:04,890
Like so.

2268
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:12,330
That's right.

2269
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:14,490
Yeah, because I don't think four...

2270
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:16,930
Two, two...

2271
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:17,490
Oh, what?

2272
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,110
Oh yeah, because there's a one too.

2273
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:19,790
Okay, so never mind.

2274
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:20,450
So...

2275
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:20,770
Oh wait.

2276
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:22,010
Wow...

2277
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:22,350
Wow...

2278
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:23,170
Gura gura gura gura gura.

2279
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,230
Maitake maitake.

2280
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:25,510
Gura gura gura gura.

2281
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:26,370
Yes.

2282
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:27,630
I messed up.

2283
01:49:27,630 --> 01:49:28,210
Oh, there we go.

2284
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,570
I did too many.

2285
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:34,170
Maitake maitake.

2286
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:35,550
Gura gura gura gura.

2287
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,250
Um...

2288
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:41,850
Two here.

2289
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:46,670
Gura gura gura.

2290
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:47,050
Yes.

2291
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,370
One, space.

2292
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:54,930
One, two, three, four.

2293
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:59,430
Uh oh.

2294
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:00,450
My chat froze.

2295
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:02,270
Give me one moment, please.

2296
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:08,110
Distracted by ecchi convention.

2297
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:10,890
I mean...

2298
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:12,830
You aren't...

2299
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:15,030
Incorrect.

2300
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:16,810
But also...

2301
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,590
Guys...

2302
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:25,890
I...

2303
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:29,050
What should we do for 400,000 subscribers?

2304
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,430
We're gonna get there eventually.

2305
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:33,490
I think?

2306
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:36,870
What should we do?

2307
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,170
Party!

2308
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,950
E400,000 leaves of cilantro.

2309
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,870
It's also spooky.

2310
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,300
It's quite a spooky...

2311
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:54,230
Achievement.

2312
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:57,270
Pizza party.

2313
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,350
New outfit reveal.

2314
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:10,190
Oh, I might actually be able to do that.

2315
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,910
Eat 400,000 hot dogs.

2316
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:19,070
I'll sing a song 400,000 times.

2317
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:28,270
Okay, so here is tricky because it could be two, one, four, or...

2318
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:32,890
Two, one, and then four somewhere.

2319
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:37,570
I'll sing there.

2320
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,610
Count four...

2321
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,590
Four, four, four, K pennies.

2322
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:43,370
Yeah, but that would be four, four, four, four, K, no?

2323
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:43,930
Oh...

2324
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:50,850
I sang...

2325
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:51,530
I've sung...

2326
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:52,610
I've sung...

2327
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:53,270
Uh...

2328
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,230
Ikenai Borderline 50 times.

2329
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:59,710
I feel like I could have the endurance to sing a song 100 times.

2330
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:01,430
Even 101 times.

2331
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:02,710
I think.

2332
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:10,840
Ban 400,000 wisps.

2333
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:11,200
True.

2334
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:32,250
How are we supposed to...

2335
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:32,510
No!

2336
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:37,150
I'm sorry I'm yawning now.

2337
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:42,060
I don't know.

2338
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,280
Because this could be...

2339
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:46,760
Wait.

2340
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:49,640
This could be...

2341
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,160
Wait.

2342
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,220
No, wait, no.

2343
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:52,420
Just wait.

2344
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,080
One, two, three, four, one.

2345
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:56,500
See?

2346
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:57,540
I don't know.

2347
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:00,140
I don't know.

2348
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:07,960
This one's tricking me out.

2349
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,860
I know you guys are trying to help, but...

2350
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:17,160
I...

2351
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,140
I get confused.

2352
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,020
I get confused.

2353
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,980
Yeah, maybe 400K will do outfit reveal.

2354
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,500
I still have some stuff I need to prepare though.

2355
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,120
The weird dimensions throwing you off.

2356
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,220
Yeah, I think so.

2357
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,100
I think so.

2358
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,000
See?

2359
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:39,740
Because...

2360
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,920
This could be four.

2361
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:41,760
Wait.

2362
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:43,640
Can it?

2363
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:44,840
Yeah, it can.

2364
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:44,920
Hmm.

2365
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:46,600
Or it could be two...

2366
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,380
Four, one.

2367
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,900
Conventions have been censored nowadays.

2368
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:01,100
I remember someone talking about their whole booth getting removed just for regular Higurashi merch.

2369
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:11,700
I know some conventions have rules based on how much fan art you can have.

2370
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:16,360
Versus, like, original goods.

2371
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:20,540
Mint, I need to take care of my voice.

2372
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,040
Also, Mint.

2373
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:22,820
I didn't say I was going to sing.

2374
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,960
I just said I could.

2375
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,720
If I wanted to.

2376
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,100
No!

2377
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,560
It's already been 20 minutes with this one.

2378
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,000
Help!

2379
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:36,820
Wait.

2380
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,400
Is there a hint system in this?

2381
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,120
Jump to Matsu Takeo!

2382
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:43,620
Hint!

2383
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,400
I'm not trying to help Mint.

2384
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:51,800
Don't worry.

2385
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,320
No!

2386
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:52,860
Please!

2387
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:58,800
Please!

2388
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,160
Column 7 put an X between the two boxes.

2389
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:06,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2390
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,400
How do you know?

2391
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,000
How do you know?

2392
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,960
What if you did four activities simultaneously for 100 minutes to show your ultimate power?

2393
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,100
Four.

2394
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,140
Ha ha ha ha!

2395
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,500
Easy mode.

2396
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,480
Because it can't be your four.

2397
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:34,280
Oh!

2398
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:35,460
Oh!

2399
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:35,860
Oh!

2400
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:36,760
I see it now!

2401
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,800
I see it!

2402
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,000
I see it!

2403
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,200
I see it!

2404
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:40,640
You're right!

2405
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,960
I see it!

2406
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,000
Yes.

2407
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,220
Yes.

2408
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:52,620
Yes.

2409
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:55,140
Twinkle dogs reunion.

2410
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,270
Let's see.

2411
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:08,820
This has to be... R3.

2412
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,020
Yeah.

2413
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:13,000
Wait.

2414
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:18,340
Wait.

2415
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,560
Now I remember why I didn't... Hold on.

2416
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:24,360
Because it could be 1, 3, 1, 1.

2417
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:24,960
You know?

2418
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,920
It could be connected to the 5.

2419
01:56:38,690 --> 01:56:40,450
What do the blue numbers mean?

2420
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:45,730
The blue numbers mean that there's a part that is solvable on the row.

2421
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,830
So... But I don't know.

2422
01:56:55,110 --> 01:57:00,390
We only have two quote-unquote columns that have things that are able to be placed.

2423
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:02,710
Yeah.

2424
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:04,170
Enough info to solve a square.

2425
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:04,550
Yeah.

2426
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:04,730
Yeah.

2427
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:04,950
Yeah.

2428
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,130
Yeah.

2429
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,190
I'm like, what info?

2430
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:08,950
Huh?

2431
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:11,330
Are we looking at the same thing?

2432
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:16,070
None of this feels solvable right now.

2433
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,560
We have no errors.

2434
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:30,840
Yeah?

2435
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,560
Let me double-check.

2436
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,800
Just wait a minute.

2437
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:34,420
Nope.

2438
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,960
We are all good.

2439
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,860
We keep our brains today.

2440
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,140
Think if it could be 3 or 1, what would be the same?

2441
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:56,570
That this is...

2442
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:57,370
Naruhono.

2443
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:57,850
Next.

2444
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:15,960
What do you mean, though?

2445
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:17,700
Huh?

2446
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,620
What do you mean, why?

2447
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:22,180
Because if it's 3, it's like this.

2448
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,940
And then that would have to be 1.

2449
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,360
Wait.

2450
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:28,680
I'll mix it myself up.

2451
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,120
Or...

2452
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:37,620
Or if it's 1 and this is 3, then it's like that.

2453
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:43,430
Like that.

2454
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:50,640
So either way, that is an X.

2455
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:10,790
Maetake, maetake, gulu, gulu, gulu, gulu.

2456
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:11,930
Oh.

2457
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:13,770
Oh, yeah.

2458
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:19,850
But it can be a 1.

2459
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:22,170
It can't.

2460
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:26,230
It can't be a 1.

2461
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:29,010
Oh, wait.

2462
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:29,770
You're right.

2463
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:31,270
It can be a 1.

2464
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:42,350
I saw it immediately, as soon as you said it.

2465
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:47,410
Oh, golly.

2466
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:50,470
My brain is very slow today.

2467
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,080
Why did I think that?

2468
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:04,440
Why did I think that?

2469
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,540
Curious.

2470
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:11,670
I don't like this one.

2471
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:13,390
It's making me angry.

2472
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:34,750
I don't like this one.

2473
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:37,250
I don't like this.

2474
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:44,110
The one below it is an X, though.

2475
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:45,350
No.

2476
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,390
Because what if it's 3?

2477
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,030
Or I should do the middle clicks.

2478
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,070
What if it's like 3?

2479
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:53,990
I like that.

2480
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:55,690
One, three.

2481
02:00:58,610 --> 02:01:04,710
Wait, I messed up all... I don't like doing the middle clicks.

2482
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:19,570
Oh, wait.

2483
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:21,850
Maybe I just got the position wrong.

2484
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:24,350
This is the X.

2485
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:29,350
Maybe that's what I was visualizing and I did it wrong.

2486
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:33,670
You want to like it when Mint gets angry.

2487
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:36,490
Yeah, okay.

2488
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,290
I was like, wait a second.

2489
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:41,690
I know I was seeing a vision somewhere there.

2490
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:51,470
That didn't open up anything else for... It closed that row, but it didn't open up... Or that column, but it didn't open up anything else.

2491
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:51,770
Hold on.

2492
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:55,910
I'm gonna get... Uh, uh, throat Mint.

2493
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,430
There it is.

2494
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:07,720
Thank you guys for your help.

2495
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:09,660
Let's see.

2496
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,400
Now this one.

2497
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,900
This is the one that's gonna...

2498
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,280
Help a lot.

2499
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:17,160
Hopefully.

2500
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,000
With opening new doors.

2501
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:22,460
So currently, it could be one, two.

2502
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:25,240
One, two, three, four, one.

2503
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:27,820
Like so.

2504
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:29,140
Like so.

2505
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:30,260
Or it could be...

2506
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,380
One, two, three, four somewhere.

2507
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,100
And one up here somewhere.

2508
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,580
And two down here somewhere.

2509
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:43,540
You're like Coke Zero Sugar.

2510
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:44,900
If you know, you know.

2511
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,400
I don't know.

2512
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:05,300
If I know, I know.

2513
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,360
Don't worry about it then.

2514
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:12,360
I never had a Coke before.

2515
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,720
I don't know what it tastes like.

2516
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,640
So what's...

2517
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,680
Is it like a...

2518
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,360
Is it...

2519
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:17,960
Are you saying that I taste...

2520
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:18,620
I...

2521
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:20,620
I have less sweetness than...

2522
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,380
The original...

2523
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:23,960
Zero calorie?

2524
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,540
Worse than normal Coke?

2525
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:33,040
It's gross.

2526
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:33,660
Is it?

2527
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:35,700
Oh yeah.

2528
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:36,820
The aspartame.

2529
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,260
Is that the sugar that they use?

2530
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:41,460
You haven't?

2531
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:41,660
No.

2532
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:42,700
I can't drink soda.

2533
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,260
So I've never had it before.

2534
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,140
Hmm.

2535
02:03:53,170 --> 02:03:53,910
What does it mean?

2536
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:57,450
Let's see here.

2537
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:13,810
There.

2538
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:14,470
There's one.

2539
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:20,990
I think...

2540
02:04:27,350 --> 02:04:28,390
I think...

2541
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:29,730
Oh wait.

2542
02:04:29,950 --> 02:04:30,090
Yeah.

2543
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:31,250
This is an X.

2544
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:32,150
I don't wanna...

2545
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:33,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2546
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,590
Okay.

2547
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:37,270
It shouldn't be so hard.

2548
02:04:38,890 --> 02:04:40,330
It shouldn't be so difficult.

2549
02:04:40,330 --> 02:04:40,590
There we go.

2550
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,910
My goodness gracious.

2551
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:48,430
Like that, right?

2552
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:08,370
There we go.

2553
02:05:21,150 --> 02:05:23,090
It really just takes one thing...

2554
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,450
To kind of set things into motion.

2555
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:27,410
Okay, let's see.

2556
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:28,910
Three...

2557
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:29,810
Space...

2558
02:05:29,810 --> 02:05:30,650
Two...

2559
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:31,170
Space...

2560
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:31,850
One...

2561
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:33,590
Space...

2562
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,480
Like so.

2563
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:53,740
Do be like that.

2564
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,100
Do be.

2565
02:06:00,790 --> 02:06:02,530
Do be.

2566
02:06:02,650 --> 02:06:03,370
Four.

2567
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:04,990
Cool.

2568
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:08,530
Like so.

2569
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:09,750
I love...

2570
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,370
That is nice, they are...

2571
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:11,550
Cool.

2572
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:15,450
Guys also,

2573
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:24,530
I forget...

2574
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:37,230
Tikes...

2575
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:37,870
Three...

2576
02:06:37,870 --> 02:06:37,910
Why, yes...

2577
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:38,110
Too good.

2578
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:41,350
It's a silly, cute name.

2579
02:06:41,630 --> 02:06:42,670
Yeah, it's so fun.

2580
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:47,070
Love saying her name.

2581
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:53,130
Okay, so this is four.

2582
02:06:53,870 --> 02:06:54,350
Space.

2583
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,790
It would be like that.

2584
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:57,790
Yeah, yeah.

2585
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:00,610
Okay.

2586
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:03,670
This one, I don't know if it's two...

2587
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:05,250
or if it's part of... like, two up here...

2588
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,110
and part of the four.

2589
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:15,100
To one...

2590
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:16,000
Oh, whoops.

2591
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:16,420
My bad.

2592
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:16,920
I'm stupid.

2593
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:20,500
Um...

2594
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,520
Two here.

2595
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,840
One space.

2596
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:35,910
One space.

2597
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:45,990
Like that.

2598
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,040
Three.

2599
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:56,420
I see.

2600
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,940
I see.

2601
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:02,030
Good night, Minuto.

2602
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:02,810
Good night.

2603
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,370
Good night, good night.

2604
02:08:06,590 --> 02:08:07,490
Let's see...

2605
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:08,410
Hmm, hmm.

2606
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:11,670
Hmm, hmm.

2607
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:26,010
Hmm...

2608
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:26,510
Wait, okay.

2609
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:27,670
Two...

2610
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:31,950
Two...

2611
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:33,590
This has to be...

2612
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:33,690
Ouch!

2613
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:34,790
I just open my tongue.

2614
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:37,570
Has to be like that, right?

2615
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:39,750
I believe.

2616
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:42,630
I believe.

2617
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:44,010
I believe...

2618
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,480
Still no idea what it's supposed...

2619
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:49,860
It just...

2620
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:50,600
It looks...

2621
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:52,300
It looks like a worm.

2622
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,240
Everything looks like a worm to me.

2623
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:03,260
I can't stop seeing worms everywhere.

2624
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:05,260
It's all worms.

2625
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,900
Do you see the curly tail?

2626
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:08,520
And this is the head?

2627
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:11,680
It looks like a little lima bean or something.

2628
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:19,080
I can't stop seeing worm.

2629
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:20,700
Oh.

2630
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:21,960
Oh.

2631
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:22,840
Oh.

2632
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:23,240
Hmm, hmm.

2633
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:23,780
There we go.

2634
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:33,310
Oh my gosh.

2635
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:36,670
It took so long for us to get here, but finally...

2636
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:40,570
We're making progress, finally.

2637
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:40,710
We're making progress, finally.

2638
02:09:47,410 --> 02:09:48,990
It took us so long.

2639
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:51,450
We'll helm the worm.

2640
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:54,370
I would love Minto if she were a worm.

2641
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:56,470
I don't believe that.

2642
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:01,350
Are you guys worm savers?

2643
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:06,750
If you see a worm on the sidewalk on a hot dry day, do you send him back to the...

2644
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:09,070
To the pits of dirt?

2645
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:09,990
Hmm, hmm.

2646
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:12,950
Yeah, yeah.

2647
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,110
Me too, me too.

2648
02:10:17,450 --> 02:10:19,610
I try to at least...

2649
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,190
Wait, okay.

2650
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:22,250
One, two, one...

2651
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:25,650
Three...

2652
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:27,010
Two, two.

2653
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:28,010
That should be it.

2654
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:39,850
I say back to your dirty ways, dirty worm.

2655
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:42,810
I don't go outside.

2656
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,670
That's so...

2657
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:45,250
That's...

2658
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:46,410
That's fair.

2659
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,950
That's fair, but would you be the type?

2660
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:01,220
Do you think...

2661
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:04,160
If you saw a worm, would you stop and help?

2662
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:10,690
Have no sympathy for black widows, though.

2663
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:11,210
I don't...

2664
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:12,070
That's a complete...

2665
02:11:12,070 --> 02:11:12,930
That's not a...

2666
02:11:12,930 --> 02:11:14,090
That's not a worm.

2667
02:11:15,790 --> 02:11:19,650
I don't think anybody is telling you to have sympathy for black widows.

2668
02:11:21,510 --> 02:11:22,110
Yatta!

2669
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:22,330
Yatta!

2670
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:25,930
Sugooi!

2671
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:29,650
I think that's a little...

2672
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:30,750
That's not even the same.

2673
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:35,170
Ah, let's see...

2674
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:36,530
Two...

2675
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:39,950
One...

2676
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:40,810
Hum, hum.

2677
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:41,790
Hum, hum.

2678
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,710
Yes...

2679
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:04,900
We're almost there!

2680
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:07,800
We almost got it!

2681
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:13,280
Are worms bugs?

2682
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:16,540
They're...

2683
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:17,060
They're...

2684
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:23,970
They're...

2685
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:24,830
They're...

2686
02:12:24,830 --> 02:12:25,210
They're gummy.

2687
02:12:26,450 --> 02:12:28,010
It's a kiwi bird?

2688
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:30,330
Sugooi!

2689
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:31,830
Where do you see this?

2690
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:34,030
With your eyes.

2691
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:37,410
Yatta!

2692
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:37,910
Ah!

2693
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:38,970
Nehihi...

2694
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:44,870
Not...

2695
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:45,570
Uh-oh!

2696
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:48,310
Uh-oh!

2697
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:49,750
Uh-oh!

2698
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:51,290
Uh...

2699
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:56,090
I made a lot of mistakes.

2700
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:56,690
Huh?

2701
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:59,130
Oh!

2702
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:00,590
Yeah, I see.

2703
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:01,090
Okay.

2704
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:05,970
Oh, I...

2705
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:07,590
I don't goofed!

2706
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:10,090
Was that right?

2707
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:10,490
Okay.

2708
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:13,230
More!

2709
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:19,170
This one.

2710
02:13:19,690 --> 02:13:20,070
Okay.

2711
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:20,930
Ah!

2712
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:28,170
No sympathy for...

2713
02:13:29,070 --> 02:13:32,470
Uber eats robots that fell over the street, though.

2714
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:35,950
I don't know, I feel like I see those dogs.

2715
02:13:36,710 --> 02:13:37,590
Hum, hum.

2716
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:39,670
Sugoi!

2717
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:41,650
The dogs that, like, do...

2718
02:13:42,230 --> 02:13:42,810
Ii ne!

2719
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:43,790
That...

2720
02:13:43,790 --> 02:13:47,570
They're not Uber, but you know, like, people will keep pushing them over and stuff.

2721
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:50,790
Sorry, I cheated so much.

2722
02:13:53,630 --> 02:13:55,430
It's because my brain is slow today.

2723
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,130
Yatta!

2724
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:00,630
Yatta!

2725
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:00,830
Oh!

2726
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:09,300
You know, the robot dogs?

2727
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,500
They're pretty cute, though.

2728
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:15,920
I've raised butterflies and found my first eggs of the season!

2729
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:17,060
You see, worms?

2730
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,440
You might be excited to hear this.

2731
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:21,720
I've got monarchs and swallowtails!

2732
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:23,740
That's so sweet!

2733
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,480
Wait, that's actually so sweet!

2734
02:14:34,670 --> 02:14:36,370
I used to grow butterflies.

2735
02:14:41,450 --> 02:14:43,090
Worms or caterpillars?

2736
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:46,390
They're a little different, huh?

2737
02:14:48,710 --> 02:14:49,370
They...

2738
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:50,790
They are a little different.

2739
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:52,370
Just don't worry about it.

2740
02:14:52,670 --> 02:14:53,390
Hum, hum.

2741
02:14:59,390 --> 02:15:00,050
Sugoi!

2742
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:04,850
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2743
02:15:07,370 --> 02:15:08,410
Yes, yes.

2744
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:09,010
Yes, yes.

2745
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:11,470
Yes.

2746
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:12,150
Yatta!

2747
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:14,150
Yes, yes, yes.

2748
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:19,790
My eyes are so heavy right now.

2749
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:21,050
You guys don't even understand.

2750
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:24,530
I don't want to end stream early, but...

2751
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,930
I'm like...

2752
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:29,910
I'm so...

2753
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:31,190
I think it's...

2754
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:35,290
But I don't want to go to sleep because when I wake up, I have to go!

2755
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:36,770
No!

2756
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:37,370
Yatta!

2757
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:37,470
No!

2758
02:15:40,410 --> 02:15:42,170
I don't want to go tomorrow.

2759
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:44,970
You can't make me!

2760
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:46,850
Sugoi!

2761
02:15:49,970 --> 02:15:51,310
I was catching up to you.

2762
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:53,310
I thought I was over the jet lag.

2763
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:56,070
I thought I was over it.

2764
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:57,190
Yes, yes, yes.

2765
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:59,390
It's good.

2766
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:00,470
Yatta!

2767
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,890
Sugoi!

2768
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:05,450
One, one...

2769
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:06,210
I'll hear...

2770
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:09,150
Wait, it's a swan!

2771
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:10,890
It's a...

2772
02:16:10,890 --> 02:16:11,730
It's a bird!

2773
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:11,890
Good!

2774
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:14,210
What is that?

2775
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:17,470
I was right!

2776
02:16:23,230 --> 02:16:24,610
What the hell?

2777
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:30,610
I decided to race against you.

2778
02:16:30,710 --> 02:16:31,190
Just finished.

2779
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:32,290
Yeah, me too.

2780
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,810
No, I think.acÄããããã®ä½åã§ããã¾ããç¬ããå®ãã³ããã¯ãã§ã¦ãå¤§ä½å®å¯¸å¤§ãµã¤ãºã§æããã¦ãã¾ãã

2781
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:44,890
That's true, this lag.

2782
02:16:44,890 --> 02:16:45,210
This figures lag.

2783
02:16:45,790 --> 02:16:57,890
You can see theæå­ on the floor, and that they're in the foot of the heart of football.

2784
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:17,890
No, I think...

2785
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:35,690
I think someone knows how...um...wait...oh wait, the enemy of the state was a bo...I didn't even notice this was a dog.

2786
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:46,690
I think someone knows that...that geese are evil...even though it's a swan.

2787
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:49,830
But swans...I guess swans are mean too.

2788
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:50,450
Look at that.

2789
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:52,410
There's no way that's a nice swan.

2790
02:17:54,170 --> 02:17:55,430
I like geese though.

2791
02:17:55,590 --> 02:17:56,690
I love geese.

2792
02:17:58,350 --> 02:18:04,090
But...you cannot deny...that they are pretty evil.

2793
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:07,670
Swans are extremely mean.

2794
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,570
Swan geese by association.

2795
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2796
02:18:22,170 --> 02:18:25,830
So...I think that this person had a...tricky run-in.

2797
02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:29,050
With a swan and said they are the enemy of the state.

2798
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:32,290
That's my artistic...analysis.

2799
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:38,550
That is my...grand artistic analysis.

2800
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:44,750
What I want to do is not do...a 25 by 20...oh maybe 20 by 20.

2801
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:49,720
Maybe that's okay.

2802
02:18:57,430 --> 02:18:59,930
Maybe that'll be okay then, 15 by 15.

2803
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:01,270
Okay, let's try it.

2804
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:06,210
Attempt.

2805
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:09,770
Oh...uh...

2806
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:10,370
Not attempt.

2807
02:19:10,770 --> 02:19:13,330
Let's do a 15 by 15 and I'll call it there.

2808
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,730
Oh, whoops.

2809
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,570
Went the wrong way.

2810
02:19:20,950 --> 02:19:23,250
Where are all the 15 by 15s?

2811
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:26,870
Where are they?

2812
02:19:28,470 --> 02:19:30,110
Oh, Japanese painting.

2813
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:30,970
Okay, we'll try it.

2814
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:37,390
15 by 15 is extremely cozy.

2815
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:39,030
I can do these fast.

2816
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:42,610
Most of the time.

2817
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:47,770
Most of the time, at least.

2818
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:52,770
Yatta!

2819
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:10,410
Wait, did I go too far?

2820
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:12,570
Yes.

2821
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,540
Keys don't even feel the need to run away...

2822
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:31,520
when you walk through a swarm of them.

2823
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:33,300
Should tell you all you need to know.

2824
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:37,300
I once saw a video of a...goose that landed in a tiger pin.

2825
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:37,860
Sugoi!

2826
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,260
Wait, yeah.

2827
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:41,340
And a tiger pin.

2828
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:42,600
And...

2829
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,640
The tiger was like...

2830
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:45,480
Yatta!

2831
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:47,480
That's a little snacky for me.

2832
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:51,180
And the goose literally attacked him and was just like...

2833
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:52,340
Back the hell off.

2834
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:54,200
Back the hell off.

2835
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,100
And then the tiger was like...

2836
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:56,820
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2837
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:57,760
I'm sorry.

2838
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:58,460
I'm sorry.

2839
02:20:59,380 --> 02:20:59,900
Sugoi!

2840
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:05,290
Okay.

2841
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:05,510
Gese.

2842
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:06,150
The geese are crazy.

2843
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:10,410
I'm sorry.

2844
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:11,570
Yatta!

2845
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:31,350
Yatta!

2846
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:34,890
Oh, so this is just so easy.

2847
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:37,830
Maybe we can do another one.

2848
02:21:38,610 --> 02:21:39,490
I don't know.

2849
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:53,290
Wait, what did I get wrong?

2850
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:55,690
Wait, uh, why... there we go.

2851
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,010
There we go.

2852
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:07,030
It's a puppy?

2853
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:12,170
This is where I asked if you've played an untitled goose game.

2854
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:16,970
This is where I asked if you've played an untitled goose game.

2855
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:17,150
Oh, for Anna!

2856
02:22:17,150 --> 02:22:18,310
I'm sorry, Anna.

2857
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:23,010
It's too much fun to describe the appearance of the nature of the nature.

2858
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:25,570
Oh, okay.

2859
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:32,010
In this movie, it's a lovely little girl, which is a beautiful feeling.

2860
02:22:33,190 --> 02:22:34,890
The face is painted on the face.

2861
02:22:55,470 --> 02:22:56,510
So cute!

2862
02:22:57,410 --> 02:23:00,670
Okay, I saw one last, 15 by 15.

2863
02:23:01,150 --> 02:23:04,010
We can get this done out of the way.

2864
02:23:04,130 --> 02:23:04,710
Easy too!

2865
02:23:06,730 --> 02:23:09,070
Sorry, I'm obsessed, Hajime!

2866
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:13,090
I'm obsessed with... game.

2867
02:23:15,230 --> 02:23:16,750
I'm obsessed.

2868
02:23:18,790 --> 02:23:20,130
I'm obsessed.

2869
02:23:20,130 --> 02:23:26,790
I'm obsessed with this.

2870
02:23:37,210 --> 02:23:37,930
That's it!

2871
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,790
Amazing!

2872
02:23:49,730 --> 02:23:58,070
Wait, I'll do the one too... Yes... Just

2873
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:05,890
one more famous last words.

2874
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:22,360
I don't think... as much as I would... I don't think I even have... the strength... I don't have the strength to go...

2875
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:22,940
Go on!

2876
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:48,280
Not the yawning virus... I've got it... I've got this... the tired... The tired... Oh gosh, okay... Okay... I'm okay... A hundred more fifteen by fifteens later... Oh no though... I'm getting real sleepy...

2877
02:24:48,280 --> 02:25:02,400
Come on, come on... Oh... I'm awake... Have

2878
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:11,350
time...

2879
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:29,890
Okay, yes... One... Space two... Space two... Space one... Okay... Yes... Yes... Yes...

2880
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:30,590
Yes, maybe.

2881
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:40,250
Oh, that one was... I should have gotten that one from the beginning.

2882
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:43,090
Whoopsie.

2883
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:46,150
It's fine, I'm sleepy as well.

2884
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:49,390
It's just one of those days, you know?

2885
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:55,090
What's today, Monday?

2886
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:55,870
Yeah.

2887
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:58,750
Lazy Monday.

2888
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,750
Well, not lazy, but you know when you...

2889
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:06,750
Mondays make you feel a certain way.

2890
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:08,950
Thank you, Garfield.

2891
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:26,920
The angry...

2892
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:29,360
The angry of Buzhi is so funny.

2893
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:31,060
Okay.

2894
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:31,760
Hold on.

2895
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,340
Good.

2896
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,680
Morale is dead on Mondays.

2897
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:42,300
Yeah, but you just gotta look forward to next...

2898
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:43,400
To the Friday again.

2899
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:46,320
And that'll get you motivated.

2900
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:49,060
To be like, yeah, Friday will come...

2901
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:50,300
Once again.

2902
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:51,520
Eventually.

2903
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:53,260
Eventually.

2904
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:53,600
Eventually.

2905
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:02,820
The peak collab.

2906
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:04,000
Yeah, that's on Friday.

2907
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:04,820
That's right.

2908
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:06,020
Oh.

2909
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:06,820
I did it!

2910
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:07,780
Don't do that.

2911
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,600
Don't do that.

2912
02:27:25,630 --> 02:27:26,430
That's right.

2913
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:45,190
I just called them Minto Monday.

2914
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:49,150
I guess we'll have to see what...

2915
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:50,850
The doctor says tomorrow, though.

2916
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,430
Oh, whoops.

2917
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:53,770
Because, uh...

2918
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:57,930
That could change my schedule if they're just like...

2919
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:58,290
Missy!

2920
02:27:58,770 --> 02:27:59,790
No talking!

2921
02:28:00,890 --> 02:28:01,490
Forever.

2922
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:04,330
Hopefully, they don't say that.

2923
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:09,120
That's right.

2924
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:11,520
But you know...

2925
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:16,980
Good news, we all hope.

2926
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:17,460
Yeah!

2927
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:19,220
Minto of the sleepless.

2928
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,740
What is your wisdom?

2929
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:29,640
Don't become sleepless!

2930
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:34,240
Don't do it!

2931
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:37,740
Don't...

2932
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:38,920
Don't become sleepless!

2933
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:39,440
Don't become sleepless!

2934
02:28:43,650 --> 02:28:46,450
This one's taken me just a little bit longer...

2935
02:28:46,450 --> 02:28:47,410
Because my brain...

2936
02:28:47,410 --> 02:28:48,670
Well, my brain's been shut down.

2937
02:28:49,430 --> 02:28:51,330
My brain has been shut down.

2938
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:56,610
Wait, two...

2939
02:28:56,610 --> 02:28:57,630
One...

2940
02:28:57,630 --> 02:28:58,230
One...

2941
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:04,510
Very good.

2942
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:06,710
Very good.

2943
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:10,630
One...

2944
02:29:11,410 --> 02:29:12,130
Two...

2945
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:13,610
One...

2946
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:14,710
Two...

2947
02:29:17,470 --> 02:29:17,990
Wait...

2948
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,510
One...

2949
02:29:26,190 --> 02:29:26,710
Huh?

2950
02:29:27,450 --> 02:29:27,970
Wait...

2951
02:29:27,970 --> 02:29:28,270
Okay...

2952
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:28,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2953
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:31,230
Oh, golly.

2954
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:34,430
If they went that far...

2955
02:29:34,430 --> 02:29:35,430
Saying never talk again...

2956
02:29:35,430 --> 02:29:36,790
Probably would want to give a second opinion.

2957
02:29:37,090 --> 02:29:37,350
It's true!

2958
02:29:38,390 --> 02:29:39,790
Well, if you need to stay awake...

2959
02:29:39,790 --> 02:29:41,090
Remember to use code BOOBER...

2960
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:41,870
For that extra energy...

2961
02:29:42,230 --> 02:29:43,030
With giver subs!

2962
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:45,250
What if the doctor prescribes...

2963
02:29:45,250 --> 02:29:46,270
Turkish delight?

2964
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:47,670
Huh...

2965
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:49,130
Second opinion...

2966
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:50,090
Second opinion!

2967
02:29:54,410 --> 02:29:56,470
You can't force me...

2968
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:00,670
To enjoy Turkish delight...

2969
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:03,530
It's not a delight for me...

2970
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,630
Everybody has a different opinion...

2971
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:12,590
I like the way she says that part...

2972
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:22,680
I like the way she says...

2973
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:23,120
I like it!

2974
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,480
I like it!

2975
02:30:25,180 --> 02:30:25,260
That's it!

2976
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:26,220
Mm, mm!

2977
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,320
Almost there?

2978
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:28,200
I like it!

2979
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:29,800
Almost there?

2980
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:32,380
Yuffie!

2981
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:33,580
A

2982
02:30:38,310 --> 02:30:41,430
little pause... Wait!

2983
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:44,270

allegiance

2989

?ãªãã ãã©...ãã¼...and...cause I was making my schedule .Today .I'm not gonna lie, I felt so depressed.

2990
02:31:55,270 --> 02:32:00,110
Because I was just like, I don't want to take this many days off.

2991
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:02,270
I know I have to, but...

2992
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:04,250
I have your med song.

2993
02:32:04,570 --> 02:32:05,570
My med song?

2994
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:12,210
What's my alarm for taking my nighttime medication and you jump scare me nightly?

2995
02:32:12,830 --> 02:32:13,850
What's my med song?

2996
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:17,270
But thanks!

2997
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:21,850
Just a few months.

2998
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:26,550
I think until September, you know, obviously we'll have to see.

2999
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:28,970
Especially after tomorrow.

3000
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:31,150
What the diagnosis is.

3001
02:32:32,030 --> 02:32:34,990
I think resting mostly until September would be good.

3002
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:36,310
But we'll see, we'll see.

3003
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:38,390
Hoping for good news tomorrow.

3004
02:32:38,570 --> 02:32:39,410
Try not to stress too much.

3005
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:40,750
I'm sure it'll be over before you know it.

3006
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:42,010
Thank you!

3007
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,230
ASMR typing strings.

3008
02:32:47,690 --> 02:32:50,610
We're up for whatever type of stream we need while recovering.

3009
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:51,450
Thank you!

3010
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:55,210
I don't think I could do text-to-speech stream.

3011
02:32:56,890 --> 02:32:57,970
I don't think I could.

3012
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:03,910
Yeah, I'll definitely let you guys know how things go.

3013
02:33:04,070 --> 02:33:04,850
Of course, of course.

3014
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:07,270
No talking charade stream.

3015
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:09,790
Oh my gosh, I'm forced to use 3D.

3016
02:33:10,130 --> 02:33:11,690
Because it's the only way I can communicate.

3017
02:33:11,690 --> 02:33:14,070
I know a little bit of ASL.

3018
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:16,530
American Sign Language.

3019
02:33:19,310 --> 02:33:20,350
My WPM?

3020
02:33:20,710 --> 02:33:22,110
It's like 90 something.

3021
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,530
But still, I feel like it's...

3022
02:33:26,530 --> 02:33:27,330
I don't know.

3023
02:33:28,390 --> 02:33:29,710
I talk too much.

3024
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:31,110
I have too much that I want to say.

3025
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:36,730
And...

3026
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:40,250
Typing would not be...

3027
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:42,150
Efficient.

3028
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:47,610
Sending all my energy for tomorrow.

3029
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:49,290
Thank you guys.

3030
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:50,470
Thank you.

3031
02:33:58,920 --> 02:33:59,840
Puppy.

3032
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:03,460
I guess Japan likes morning glories.

3033
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:06,040
Wait, is it the same...

3034
02:34:06,040 --> 02:34:08,120
No, it's not even the same...

3035
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,680
The same person.

3036
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:14,540
Hello guys!

3037
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,740
Thank you.

3038
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:19,380
Uh...

3039
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:21,600
I'll let you guys know how my doctor's appointment goes.

3040
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:23,100
And if you're watching the VOD...

3041
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:24,380
Then you might already know!

3042
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:27,400
Talking using the 15...

3043
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:30,120
By 15 seconds...

3044
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:30,260
Huh?

3045
02:34:39,210 --> 02:34:40,410
Good luck, have a good night.

3046
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:41,050
Thank you!

3047
02:34:41,810 --> 02:34:42,830
It'll be okay tomorrow.

3048
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,610
Thank you!

3049
02:34:49,740 --> 02:34:51,360
Oh gosh, you scared me.

3050
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:53,920
Welcome!

3051
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:54,060
You're welcome!

3052
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:59,420
Guifu-tei-la-renga-gu-an-nai!

3053
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:00,800
Pixel Museum!

3054
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,080
I don't know that tomorrow.

3055
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:03,720
You'll be in and out before you know it.

3056
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:05,360
Hopefully...

3057
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:06,460
Margo, thank you!

3058
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:08,120
Pain, thank you!

3059
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,140
Thank you guys.

3060
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:11,400
Otsumi-ta!

3061
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,100
I'll see you guys...

3062
02:35:13,100 --> 02:35:14,220
When I see you next.

3063
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:15,980
Thank you so much for...

3064
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:16,800
for...

3065
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:17,020
uh...

3066
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:19,020
indulging me in my Nonogram obsession.

3067
02:35:19,940 --> 02:35:20,440
And...

3068
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:20,820
um...

3069
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:21,040
Yeah.

3070
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:22,620
Otsumi-ta, otumi-ta!

3071
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:24,280
Hello, oh my gosh.

3072
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,660
Toziko, your icon is so cute.

3073
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:29,780
Have a good sleep.

3074
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:30,560
You as well.

3075
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:34,700
I'm gonna have a good night.

3076
02:35:34,860 --> 02:35:35,760
I'll see you guys later.

3077
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:36,980
Bye-bye.

3078
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,540
I'll do my best tomorrow.

3079
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:39,580
I'll be brave.

3080
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:41,560
Hi, dog.

3081
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:44,740
Thank you, Joy Princess.

3082
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:46,200
Bye-bye.

3083
02:35:48,980 --> 02:35:49,840
Bye-bye.
