00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,960
Hello everyone, my friends, my sister.

2
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,040
I feel so fancy with this music.

3
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,120
So refined.

4
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes, hello everybody.

5
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,340
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

6
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
Welcome back.

7
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,620
If this is your first time watching the Pixel Museum, welcome.

8
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,940
If this is your first time watching me, welcome.

9
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
I don't know how to introduce myself.

10
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Why did I make this...

11
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,680
Why did I make this an arbitrary, like, intro?

12
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
Why did I... I don't know.

13
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,400
Why did I make this...

14
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm so sorry.

15
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,620
Yes, I'm so sorry.

16
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,560
You are a VTuber?

17
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
Who am I?

18
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,640
Who's this?

19
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,960
Um...

20
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,200
H...

21
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,840
H...

22
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,400
H...

23
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
T...

24
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,840
H...

25
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,160
H...張...

26
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,280
VITAL!

27
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
This is my first time watching you, trust.

28
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
Who are you?

29
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:39,400
Why do I feel so... I don't know, on the spot.

30
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,140
But I have to introduce myself.

31
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Such a lust for maids.

32
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
First time viewer here.

33
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,180
I'm ignoring the...

35
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,920
The one-year badge.

36
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,320
Show your true nature to all the wisps.

38
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,960
What's my true nature?

39
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,160
Last time watcher.

40
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,760
No, you have to come back!

41
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,360
I'll be so lonely.

42
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,820
This isn't my first time watching you.

43
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,560
Who am I?

44
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,960
Yeah, why are you asking who I am?

45
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,360
Why don't you introduce yourself instead?

46
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,900
Huh?

47
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
You come into my chat and you don't introduce yourself?

48
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,180
Hmm...

49
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,740
Show them the power of...

50
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:38,960
WIT!

51
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,190
Who are we?

52
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,230
WIT.

53
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,790
I'm MintoLover123.

54
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,650
That's not what your username says.

55
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,550
More like...

56
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,150
More like...

57
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,470
Phony123.

58
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,350
YouTube got rid of usernames.

59
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,890
Not our fault.

60
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,710
Oh, yeah, yeah.

61
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,990
That's um...

62
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,150
Everybody's username originally was...

63
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,070
MintoLover123 and every number upwards.

64
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,250
So, 1, 2, 3...

65
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,430
1, 2...

66
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,450
Wait...

67
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,070
1, 2, 4...

68
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,170
1, 2, 5...

69
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,410
1, 2, 6...

70
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,070
1, 2, 7...

71
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,190
And onwards and onwards and onwards.

72
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,150
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

73
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,010
Oh my goodness.

74
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,610
You guys wrote the super chat.

75
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,130
Today will be Minto.

76
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,270
You are Minto.

77
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,230
Who are we thinking about?

78
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,570
I don't know anymore.

79
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,170
Vintuber, who are you?

80
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,340
Vintuber.

81
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,900
Hello, just a fan of acute ghost mitts.

82
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,400
Understandable.

83
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,600
Good taste.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,460
I never watched you before, or I never will.

85
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,420
My name is Gato, not Gator.

86
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,560
I like robots.

87
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,580
Do you like robots?

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Maybe...

89
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,340
I'm just a teacup.

90
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,960
You are!

91
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

92
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,620
Thank you guys.

93
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,100
Not me, I'm Bintolover123.

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
Totally different.

95
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,460
My original character.

96
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,960
Do not steal.

97
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,320
Bintol.

98
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm missing out.

99
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
My name stayed the same.

100
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,100
Yeah, I did.

101
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,220
I prefer that.

102
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,560
I prefer that.

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
First time watching.

104
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,920
Sergeant Bobby, thank you so much for the 15 months.

106
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,800
Thank you.

107
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,780
Thank you.

108
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,440
El...

109
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,740
A-ha-roll.

110
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,540
What's up with the gifted?

111
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,740
Thank you so much.

112
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,400
Thank you.

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
So you admitted that you're cute.

114
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,760
So you admitted that you're cute.

115
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
What is this mean girl's moment?

116
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,740
So you admitted that you're cute.

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm Pippin and I like potatoes.

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,060
Oh my gosh.

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,840
I don't know.

120
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,760
Oh, I...

121
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,320
I...

122
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,380
I...

123
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:40,860
Oh, what was it?

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,260
Oh!

125
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh!

126
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,260
Um...

127
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,680
I saw...

128
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,340
Someone recreate that...

129
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,760
Heee...

130
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,080
The other day!

131
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,220
And it had me thinking about old memes.

132
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,340
And then like how sometimes people will still reference...

133
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,660
Potatoes, boil em...

134
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:06,920
Mash em...

135
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,740
Stick em in a stew.

136
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,900
I saw, like, I saw that reference recently, too.

137
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,680
I was like, no, what?

138
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh, they're sending the... They're sending the... They're sending the... Oh, what were they?

139
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,340
They're going to Isagard.

140
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,440
What are those things?

141
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,640
Ouch.

142
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't tell me.

143
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,970
They're sending... My brain wants to say elves, but it's...

144
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,250
It's the elf guy that says it.

145
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,470
They're sending the elves to Isagard.

146
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,570
No, they're not.

147
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,230
Why don't they send everybody to Isagard?

148
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,230
VK!

149
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,150
Hobbits!

150
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,190
They're sending the hobbits to Isagard.

151
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,150
Isagard!

152
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,770
What is, Isagard a nice place?

153
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Surprise, Lord of the Re... Lord of the Reference.

154
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,280
No, it's not good.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,800
Isagard is awful.

156
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,630
It is the... Lord of the Flies.

157
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,910
Back off.

158
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,750
Lord of the Reference now.

159
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,970
Wait, was it called?

160
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,730
Lord of the Flies?

161
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,090
Yeah.

162
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,150
Yeah.

163
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,130
No, gosh.

164
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,570
Guys, I...

165
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,930
Tomorrow... Okay, let's start playing the game.

166
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,870
Before I forget...

167
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:08,930
This way?

168
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,210
This one took me forever.

169
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,610
Um, my brain is so... Not great today.

170
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,090
What about Epic Sax Guy with Gandalf nodding?

171
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,010
Wait, I don't think I know that one.

172
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,230
Feeling the need for... Lord of the Rings trilogy watch-along.

173
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,050
I clearly need it because I can't remember Hobbits or...

174
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,690
Or Isagard or anybody.

175
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,650
I can't remember any of this stuff.

176
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,490
We start in small.

177
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,810
I don't know how I want to start today.

178
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,830
I guess we could start small.

179
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,770
15 by 15.

180
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,710
For those who don't know...

181
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,950
These are...

182
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,250
Pixel.puzzle.

183
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,710
I'll explain.

184
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,270
I'll explain.

185
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,070
You have all these numbers up top.

186
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,690
All these numbers on the side.

187
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,670
So this is 1, 3, 1.

188
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,490
Which means...

189
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,030
That the dots will appear in this row.

190
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,450
As one.

191
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,810
With a space.

192
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,790
At least one space.

193
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:25,750
Three.

194
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,510
At least one space.

195
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:27,970
One.

196
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,710
And then eventually...

197
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,410
It creates a picture.

198
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,950
Nonograms!

199
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,490
Yeah!

200
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,510
It's time to have a Lord of the Rings watch-along with Wawa.

201
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,690
She would greatly...

202
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,050
She would be greatly disappointed if she saw a clip of the Hobbits.

203
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,230
Don't show her then.

204
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,470
Don't show her then, please.

205
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,770
Oh, I have to challenge it.

206
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:51,930
Okay.

207
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:52,910
Here we go.

208
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:53,850
Start up!

209
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,890
Oh, I forgot that this one shows like...

210
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,950
It turns blue when it shows...

211
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,350
Something you can do.

212
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,010
So see...

213
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,970
Out of this 15, we know that...

214
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,150
The 9 will always overlap here.

215
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,510
Which is why I can put it in.

216
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,510
And then this...

217
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,330
The 3...

218
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,750
Is to be the first number.

219
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,830
So we know...

220
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,090
It can't be...

221
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,250
It has to be like...

222
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,250
1, 2, 3...

223
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,990
Or 1, 2, 3...

224
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,410
Like that.

225
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,230
Your aura today is nice and round.

226
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,130
Are you saying I put on weight?

227
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,030
Some kind of pixel Sudoku.

228
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,950
Pretty much.

229
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,790
Yes!

230
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,150
No, it's Spectra.

231
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,670
If you say so.

232
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,310
And then like 8 can be here.

233
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,330
But then also...

234
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:58,690
We can...

235
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,030
So since there's 3...

236
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,670
We can go 1, 2, 3...

237
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,070
And then also add the space in.

238
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,990
Like that.

239
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,330
What was the X?

240
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,290
There we go.

241
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,930
We can do that...

242
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,650
Because 6 has to...

243
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,670
6 wouldn't be able to fill in here.

244
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,850
Like that.

245
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,970
Oh wait, I can do one more.なるほど .なるほど.

246
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,090
This is 5... Wait.

247
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,390
1, 2... Oh wait, okay.

248
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:23,710
Hold on.

249
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,130
1, 2, 3, 4.

250
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,430
Oh, we can fill this in.

251
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,070
Oops.

252
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:31,750
Yippee!

253
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,310
Easy peasy .なるほど.

254
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,810
And then since these are...

255
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,890
1s...

256
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,910
We know that there's gonna be spaces in between.

257
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,310
Like so.

258
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,390
It was my birthday the other day.

259
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,830
I think I can get a Slightly Belated B-Day song.

260
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,830
TXR!

261
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,370
I'm so sorry.

262
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,830
I'm not doing birthday songs right now.

263
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,390
But...

264
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,490
Happy Belated Birthday!

265
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,030
Happy, happy, belated birthday!

266
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,890
Why couldn't 6 fit in there?

267
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,150
Because there was this little X.

268
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,770
Oh wait.

269
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,310
Hold on.

270
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,650
Let me make myself a little bit smaller.

271
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,720
There we go.

272
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,420
And so there's only 4 spots.

273
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
6 wouldn't be able to fit in there.

274
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,060
There we go.

275
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,500
And we can do that.

276
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
So we can do that.

277
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,100
Because 4.

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,040
But yeah, guys.

279
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,500
I don't know.

280
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,280
I...

281
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,100
I didn't sleep well last night.

282
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,180
I have my throat doctor appointment tomorrow.

283
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,100
I've never...

284
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,480
I don't know.

285
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,620
I've never...

286
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,420
I've never gotten it done before.

287
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,640
The tube in my throat.

288
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,380
I'm scared.

289
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,380
That's right.

290
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm scared.

291
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,260
For real.

292
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,380
Uh-oh.

293
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,300
Wait.

294
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,300
Did I mess up already?

295
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,460
I messed up already.

296
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,520
Uh-oh.

297
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,900
Maybe I chose the wrong game to play today.

298
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,700
Wait.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,120
Okay.

300
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,440
Hold on.

301
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,000
Let me reset.

302
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,740
Restart!

303
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm so scared tomorrow though.

304
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm so scared.

305
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

306
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,460
Hold on.

307
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,460
What's it?

308
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,000
One.

309
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,840
Two.

310
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,980
Three.

311
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,900
Four.

312
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,580
Wait.

313
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,180
One.

314
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,440
Two.

315
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,280
Three.

316
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,100
Four.

317
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,740
Space.

318
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,280
One.

319
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,600
Two.

320
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,080
Three.

321
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,480
Four.

322
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,660
There we go.

323
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,340
Okay.

324
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,880
Like that.

325
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,540
Should be it.

326
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,700
It's gonna be okay.

327
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,860
Plus you get cool pics.

328
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,400
our video.

329
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,000
Uh-oh.

330
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Uh-oh.

331
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,940
Ah-oh.

332
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,380
Ah-oh.

333
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,040
Guru guru.

334
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,660
Guru guru guru.

335
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,000
Wait.

336
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,640
Oh, I forgot that, uh...

337
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,140
The scroll.

338
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,480
The scroll does that.

339
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,120
Whoopsie.

340
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:15,900
Teeheehee.

341
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm scared.

342
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,180
Guru guru.

343
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,680
Guru guru.

344
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:22,900
Guru guru.

345
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,400
But yeah.

346
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,780
Uh-oh.

347
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.

348
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,890
But I'll be brave...

349
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,490
Maybe...

350
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,590
The retired play is something relaxing and not stressful.

351
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,250
This isn't stressful...

352
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,650
But my brain is very slow today.

353
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:48,930
I...

354
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,410
To be honest, I was like...

355
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,630
I was like...

356
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,530
Trying to figure out what to play today.

357
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,350
Because I was like...

358
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,690
I even took a nap...

359
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,170
For like over an hour.

360
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,710
I'm still so sleepy.

361
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,350
Did they give you any instructions?

362
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,570
I don't think so.

363
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,350
I probably just won't eat in the morning.

364
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,610
I'm afraid of throwing up.

365
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm so scared.

366
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm so scared!

367
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay, hold on.

368
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,880
Let me lock in.

369
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,430
It says I can do something here, but...

370
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,850
Here's the...

371
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,510
Hold on.

372
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,230
1...

373
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,350
2...

374
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,170
3...

375
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,410
1...

376
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:39,750
2...

377
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,190
3...

378
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,930
4...

379
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,070
I'm gonna assume.

380
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,170
1...

381
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,330
2...

382
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,330
1...

383
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,530
2...

384
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:44,870
3...

385
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,050
4...

386
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,950
5...

387
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,930
That's right.

388
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,410
We can assume.

389
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,990
This is stressful.

390
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,170
The column that says 3, then 8 below it, but...

391
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,030
2 were pressed, and then 5 below that.

392
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,010
Wait, what?

393
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,470
Huh?

394
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,230
You're confusing me even more!

395
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,330
It's okay, we'll get it eventually.

396
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,310
Doesn't matter.

397
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,030
Okay, 4...

398
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

399
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,850
Like that.

400
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,040
For those who don't get it...

401
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,030
It'll...

402
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,190
It'll...

403
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,790
You'll get it eventually, probably.

404
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,450
Like that.

405
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

406
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,850
A lot of it is kind of pattern recognition, you know?

407
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,230
Because...

408
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,930
You'll eventually be like, oh, if it looks like this, it has to be like this.

409
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,350
You know?

410
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,150
Thanks for getting me addicted to Meow Tower.

411
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,610
I'm almost 100% through the hard puzzles.

412
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,830
Oh my gosh!

413
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,210
I feel like...

414
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,070
I feel like...

415
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,330
I feel like I've gotten so many people addicted to Meow Tower.

416
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,010
It's my greatest...

417
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,710
It's my greatest accomplishment, maybe.

418
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,230
In Afterlife.

419
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,070
Like that.

420
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,710
They should sponsor you.

421
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,530
I know, right?

422
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,150
I know, right?

423
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,770
They should.

424
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:43,810
They should.

425
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:45,890
5...

426
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,910
7...

427
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,270
8...

428
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,270
Like that.

429
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,450
Like that.

430
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,470
Oh, wait.

431
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,010
Okay...

432
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,690
And then 2.

433
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,650
Hold on.

434
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,610
I'm gonna turn down...

435
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,490
I'm gonna turn down the clicky-clacky noise.

436
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,750
It's kind of driving me insane.

437
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,470
Sound effects, maybe?

438
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,210
Wait, this is so chill!

439
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,830
You solve these so quickly, it's kind of scary.

440
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,250
Really?

441
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,890
I feel like I'm actually quite slow.

442
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,730
Konnichiwa!

443
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,070
Naano, are you out here helping explain things?

444
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,850
I like this BGM.

445
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,730
I wanna keep it.

446
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,030
Wait, hold on.

447
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,070
Maybe...

448
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,410
Puzzle BGM 3.

449
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,650
Let's just change everything to Puzzle BGM 3.

450
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,180
This is so nice!

451
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,420
And we have completed this row.

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:07,960
Yatta!

453
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,220
Yatta!

454
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,960
Yes, yes.

455
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,580
Oh, so we've completed...

456
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,380
That row.

457
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,120
And this...

458
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
And this...

459
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,820
And this...

460
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,480
And this...

461
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,500
And this...

462
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,700
And this...

463
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,000
Close...

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,020
This...

465
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,960
Close...

466
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,420
Thank you!

467
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,900
I see a shape.

468
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,190
I see a shape forming...

469
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,580
Oop, that's not what I meant to do.

470
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,380
There we go.

471
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,020
Zeke?

472
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,340
Thank you so much for the gift of Deku!

473
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,220
Speaking of Metal Gear...

474
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,940
Oh my gosh, did you guys see...

475
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,560
The new dinosaur's name in the new Jurassic Park?

476
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,020
Little dragon, thank you so much for the supertante!

477
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,640
Thank you!

478
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,820
I was like, do they know?

479
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,360
Do they know?

480
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,180
It's called...

481
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,260
D-rex!

482
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,620
I was like, there's so many layers here!

483
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,080
D-rex...

484
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Do they know?

485
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,280
Oh...

486
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,200
I got it!

487
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Amazing!

488
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,750
Okay...

489
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,450
Wait, there we go.

490
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,010
Diamond Rex...

491
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,250
It stands for dinosaur.

492
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,710
No, no...

493
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,550
It stands for diamond...

494
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,370
Like diamond dogs...

495
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,630
Like D-dog and D-horse...

496
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,730
D-rex...

497
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,730
D-rex...

498
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,990
Welcome to the diamond dogs!

499
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,790
This works!

500
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,150
D-rex...

501
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,010
Actually, yeah...

502
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,590
I was like...

503
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,890
D-rex?

504
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,090
What...

505
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,890
This is...

506
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,870
This name!

507
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,890
This name...

508
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,770
D-rex...

509
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,750
D-rex...

510
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,410
D-rex...

511
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:19,870
D-rex...

512
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,090
D-rex...

513
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,790
D-rex...

514
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:32,710
D-rex...

515
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,730
Okay then that's for certain.

516
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,070
Then I guess it's... wait no.

517
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,500
That's for certain.

518
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,230
Doubtful Rex.

519
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,210
I was thinking the other day, I was just like, oh my gosh.

520
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:14,170
Maybe I'll play... the new Metal Gear on my...

521
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,650
Um... On my... PS5.

522
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,950
Because probably... like... I'm... 90% sure I'm gonna lag like crazy.

523
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,690
But then I remembered that I... did this special pre-order.

524
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,310
The one that uh... The one that allows you to play early a couple days.

525
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,070
I did that on Steam.

526
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,370
Aw man... I messed up.

527
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,830
I... I did a silly.

528
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,330
I like the far left column.

529
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,290
This one?

530
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,030
Why?

531
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,790
Why do you like it?

532
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,610
Okay, hold on.

533
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,840
It says I know it, but I don't know it.

534
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,640
Hmm... curious.

535
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,140
I'm curious.

536
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,060
Um... Hmm... Hmm... Like that.

537
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,800
Naruhodo!

538
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,280
Yes.

539
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,320
Yes.

540
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,060
Yes.

541
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,580
How?

542
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,360
Oh, I was looking at the wrong one.

543
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,940
Oh my goodness!

544
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,680
Oh my goodness.

545
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,380
You get it now?

546
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,280
We just have to use Chimiminto.

547
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,820
Yeah, I guess so.

548
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,300
Wait.

549
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,520
Three... This is seven.

550
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:41,900
There we go.

551
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,760
Naruhodo!

552
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,340
Hmm... Hmm...

553
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,780
What could this be?

554
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,880
It kind of looks like... a worm.

555
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,620
Maybe.

556
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,960
I mean...

557
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,320
Kind of... Hold on.

558
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm gonna... Let's see.

559
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,940
I'm gonna... Let's see.

560
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,100
Ha ha ha!

561
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,420
I'm a genius?

562
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,060
Hmm... Hmm...

563
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,180
I am a genius.

564
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,420
Yes.

565
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,080
Naruhodo!

566
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,480
Yaatta!

567
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,580
Hehehe!

568
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
Mehehehe.

569
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,700
Ehm...

570
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:17,720
Ehm...

571
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,680
Ehm... Ehm... I can't stop seeing the...

572
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,780
Eyeball of the worm.

573
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

574
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,380
Um.

575
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,300
I can't un-see it.

576
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,400
Yuh...

577
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,010
Mm hmm!

578
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,950
Sugoi!

579
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,220
I feel like I'm gonna fall asleep at any moment.

580
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
Uh-oh.

581
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,040
I feel like this is making me so sleepy.

582
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,090
Almost there!

583
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,650
Yippee!

584
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,370
It's a worm!

585
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:24,970
It's a worm!

586
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,990
It's a worm!

587
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,370
It's the Alba Madonna!

588
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,610
Let's listen to the...

589
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,090
A worm!

590
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,110
A worm!

591
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,070
Oh, I'm taking notes!

592
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Okay, that was a nice warm-up, huh?

593
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,420
Actually...

594
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,680
What size is this?

595
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,500
Oh, this is another 15x15.

596
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,320
Easy peasy!

597
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,660
Easy peasy!

598
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,880
Easy peasy!

599
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,020
You have a good memory?

600
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,320
I almost wish I had like a...

601
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,920
Photographic memory or something.

602
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,980
But...

603
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,760
Maybe you don't learn so much with just a photographic memory, you know?

604
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,520
Oh...

605
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,030
You don't retain it for long term...

606
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,360
Oh...

607
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,660
Oh, this one's super easy.

608
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,960
Yatta!

609
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,640
This one's so easy!

610
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,870
I'm all over the place, though.

611
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,630
My brain is a lint roller.

612
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,690
In...

613
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,070
In...

614
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,470
In...

615
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,230
In what way?

616
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,850
In what way?

617
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Before my membership expires, I want to say...

618
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,140
Thank you, Dr. Professor, for your...

619
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,320
Wise words.

620
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Thank you!

621
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,740
Thank you!

622
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,800
This one is complete!

623
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,660
That's right!

624
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,560
That's great!

625
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,260
Thank you!

626
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,120
Four, five, six, seven...

627
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,640
That's right!

628
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,980
Oh, we can complete...

629
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,820
That...

630
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,100
That's nice!

631
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,980
This one's very easy.

632
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,180
Do you guys see the vision yet?

633
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,560
You see the vision...

634
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:07,900
Yatta!

635
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,160
It's an apple.

636
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,220
Hmm?

637
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,960
That's right!

638
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,030
Is it an apple?

639
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,070
Place your bets?

640
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,590
I'm just double counting everything...

641
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,610
Yatta!

642
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,490
Okay.

643
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,240
Oh, boy!

644
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,300
In the sentence...

645
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,030
Ngunly...

646
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,530
THE WHO LOOK ABOUT IT.

647
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,200
Yeah, by that.

648
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,300
The Britishman!

649
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,680
Ngunly...

650
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,820
The Britishman!

651
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,140
Yes, Yatta!

652
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,680
That's right!

653
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,020
The Britishman...

654
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,240
Is it an apple?

655
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,560
Yes, man.

656
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:17,940
Yes, man!

657
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,440
Nintendo!

658
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,920
You see...

659
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,480
The Britishman.

660
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,770
Easy.

661
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,410
It's a person.

662
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,510
It's a guy.

663
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,530
It's that.

664
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,130
It's Rembrandt.

665
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,350
Rembrandt.

666
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,750
It's Rembrandt.

667
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,290
Ed Sheeran.

668
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,610
The Maestro.

669
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,550
Pro Tag Hair Stag.

670
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:16,730
Oh!

671
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,430
Oh!

672
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,630
He was just talking about his hair.

673
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:32,890
Interesting.

674
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:39,250
I did notice how the strokes of the hair looked so interesting.

675
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,530
He's kind of a child.

676
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,550
Especially here.

677
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,650
Oh!

678
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,630
I forgot what this means.

679
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,370
Oh, but I didn't finish.

680
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,430
Oh, that's what we did.

681
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,630
40 by 30.

682
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,690
That was my largest ever, ever, ever...

683
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,530
Painting that I've ever dot... or, uh, P-Cross...

684
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,630
Nonogram I've ever dot in.

685
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,310
Never done one bigger than 40 by 30.

686
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,030
It was really long.

687
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,350
Wait, I wonder if it says...

688
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,290
How long it took me...

689
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,970
Almost two hours!

690
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,890
Almost two whole hours of just that one.

691
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,910
Maybe we should do...

692
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,030
The room in the back?

693
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,350
She's trying to get me into the back rooms?

694
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,250
Wait, this one?

695
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,310
What?

696
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,550
This is the special one, eh?

697
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,970
You get the sense there's a story behind this one.

698
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,690
It's 25 by 30.

699
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,200
Let's try it.

700
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,980
This one will take me much longer because I...

701
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,640
You know...

702
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,060
Before I can be kind of used to the pa...

703
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,640
Okay, hold on.

704
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,480
We just started the stream.

705
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,740
Let me...

706
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
Have a little bit more...

707
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,620
15 by 15.

708
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,000
Give me...

709
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,640
Wait, special artworks room.

710
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,280
Maybe it's here.

711
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,580
Oh...

712
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,800
Nevermind, that is the one.

713
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,220
Oh wait...

714
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,820
Can I not?

715
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,920
F1...

716
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,320
Nevermind.

717
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,620
How do I get to another level?

718
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,040
Oh wait, I think here.

719
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,620
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.

720
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,840
Let's do 15 by 15.

721
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,020
Okay, easy.

722
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,420
I really like nonograms, you guys.

723
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,240
Ah!

724
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,840
There we go.

725
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,400
Oopsie.

726
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,140
I caught it.

727
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,480
I caught it, I caught it.

728
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,680
That was just me...

729
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,720
Going too fast.

730
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,830
The...

731
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,970
Meow Tower that I usually play...

732
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,850
Catches your mistakes...

733
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:04,950
Like immediately.

734
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,230
So if I mess up...

735
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,090
It...

736
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,290
Immediately will clock me.

737
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,870
So I'm so used to...

738
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,790
Immediately being...

739
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,130
Immediately...

740
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,910
Immediate...

741
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,390
Uh...

742
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,290
What's the word?

743
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,710
I'm used to the immediate...

744
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,150
Um...

745
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,910
Feedback.

746
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,350
I prefer when it doesn't do that.

747
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,530
Me too, honestly.

748
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,890
I wish you could turn it off.

749
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,730
Especially because it also kind of has like a grading system.

750
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,710
Um...

751
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,470
So...

752
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,830
If you mess up so many times...

753
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,650
And sometimes it's not even me messing up.

754
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,050
Sometimes it's me like...

755
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,490
Miss clicking, you know?

756
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,730
Like uh...

757
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,390
Like I know it's the wrong thing.

758
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,050
I just...

759
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,510
My hand slipped or something.

760
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,090
You know?

761
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,070
Yeah...

762
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,050
But...

763
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,950
It...

764
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,610
There's one?

765
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,390
Oh my gosh.

766
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,350
It was the...

767
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,990
Hatsune Miku one.

768
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,450
It's so unforgiving.

769
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,410
Because...

770
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,120
Um...

771
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,760
Two...

772
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,360
One...

773
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,140
Two...

774
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,860
Uh...

775
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,500
Because...

776
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,880
It also costs...

777
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,200
Like you have stamina to play and everything.

778
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,100
I hate that too.

779
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,480
No...

780
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,360
Have no idea how to play PCOS, but this stream has two cute girls.

781
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,860
So...

782
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Respect.

783
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,760
Maitake, Maitake, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu!

784
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,340
Thank you!

785
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
Miku PCOS 2 next week.

786
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,920
Maitake, Maitake, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu, Gulu!

787
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,900
There we go.

788
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,560
Really?

789
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,560
They're making another one?

790
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,900
Let's go.

791
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
This one's pretty easy too.

792
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,280
I say that if...

793
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,480
I don't know if I'm messing up.

794
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,580
Huh...

795
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,360
I don't know if I'm messing up.

796
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,320
Who knows?

797
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,200
Who knows?

798
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,360
Who knows?

799
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,460
Who knows?

800
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,780
Huh...

801
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,440
See ya!

802
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,230
Three or two!

803
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,310
Who knows?

804
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:20,870
Not me.

805
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:21,850
Huh...

806
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,210
I don't mean to do that one.

807
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:46,870
There we go.

808
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,370
Okay...

809
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:52,970
Three...

810
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,490
Two...

811
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,950
I'm literally on autopilot right now.

812
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,690
I can't tell if this is right at all.

813
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:08,690
Oh, okay.

814
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,950
Logite art grimoire by the same dev has grid nonograms and some cool...

815
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,670
Metal games.

816
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,170
King Charles Spaniel.

817
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,730
There's a dog!

818
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,510
See that Picross crime slash Ace Attorney like any...

819
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,230
I have seen that!

820
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:25,730
I wanna...

821
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,110
Oh my gosh, look at how stinking cute King Charles Spaniel is.

822
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,330
You knew it was a dog?

823
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,710
I can never... I'm so focused on the puzzle!

824
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,610
I can't never tell.

825
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,110
I can't even tell what it is until I'm done.

826
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:10,110
I can't even tell what it is until I'm done.

827
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,790
Oh my gosh, an artist that knows how to paint a dog!

828
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,450
Wow!

829
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,410
Wow.

830
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,570
An artist that knows that dogs look like dogs and not human.

831
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,070
I can see it.

832
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,420
Hold on.

833
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,160
There we go.

834
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,860
Sorry, I'm fixing something.

835
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,700
There we go.

836
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,300
Well, we did three 15x15s.

837
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,540
Have you seen Superman?

838
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,380
No.

839
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,740
I don't usually go to the movies.

840
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,020
I also don't watch...

841
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,540
Uh...

842
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,520
Superhero movies.

843
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,560
Shall we do the special one?

844
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,000
Corona is that breed of dog.

845
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,300
A spaniel?

846
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,400
I have no idea.

847
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,270
So tired of comic book films.

848
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,030
I think...

849
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,470
a lot of people are.

850
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,350
I think a lot of people are.

851
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:26,190
I think a lot of people are.

852
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,830
I usually...

853
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,430
If there's a movie I want to watch, I wait until it's on the plane.

854
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,670
And then I'm still waiting for the Minecraft movie to be on the plane.

855
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,190
So I can watch it.

856
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,490
It's like I spend so much money for a plane ticket.

857
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,290
And it's...

858
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,090
It's really instead a movie theater visit.

859
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,510
But there are so few superhero movies.

860
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,710
I bet you would catch up in no time.

861
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,110
The last superhero movie I watched...

862
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,670
Besides falling asleep to Deadpool Wolverine.

863
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,690
I tried watching that.

864
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,550
I fell asleep.

865
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,370
Literally at the beginning of the movie.

866
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:15,330
Um...

867
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,390
But the last movie I watched was...

868
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,110
Then probably...

869
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,430
When the first Iron Man came out.

870
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,470
Yeah.

871
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,260
Yeah, I think that's the last one I watched.

872
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,800
A long time ago.

873
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,700
I told you, I don't go watch superhero movies.

874
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,100
Well...

875
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,220
Wait.

876
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,960
When did Captain America come out?

877
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,460
Because I watched that first one too.

878
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,740
America.

879
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,160
No, movie...

880
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,860
Movie one.

881
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,940
2011.

882
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,120
And then...

883
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,040
Iron Man.

884
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,500
Movie one.

885
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,040
2008.

886
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,020
Okay, so then maybe Captain America was the last one I watched.

887
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,540
Wait.

888
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,920
I think?

889
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,980
I think I watched it.

890
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,940
I feel like I watched it.

891
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,780
I don't remember anything that happens in it though.

892
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,860
He gets frozen, right?

893
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,640
Yeah?

894
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,010
Yeah, at the end.

895
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:51,630
Okay.

896
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,010
Oh, that's a spoiler.

897
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,350
Wait, how is that spoilers?

898
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:55,970
Is that...

899
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,090
That are not...

900
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,750
Exactly what you know about...

901
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,530
Captain America?

902
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,010
Okay.

903
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,690
We're gonna do a 25 by 30, guys.

904
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,810
This might be the rest of the stream.

905
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,820
Okay.

906
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,780
Holy moly.

907
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,250
Five...

908
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,470
I'm already...

909
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,750
I'm already getting...

910
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,410
Jumbled.

911
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:26,690
Five...

912
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,150
One...

913
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,550
Two...

914
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:27,850
Three...

915
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,130
Four...

916
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,470
Five...

917
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,090
One...

918
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:33,490
One...

919
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:34,750
Two...

920
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:34,990
Three...

921
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,450
Wait, can I put a...

922
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,790
Okay, I can put this.

923
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,070
One...

924
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:40,690
Two...

925
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,190
Three...

926
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,570
Four...

927
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,030
Five...

928
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,410
Six...

929
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:42,870
Seven...

930
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,210
Eight...

931
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:43,670
Nine...

932
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,390
Ten...

933
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,590
Okay.

934
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,230
One...

935
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,670
Two...

936
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,030
Three...

937
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,510
Four...

938
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,110
Five...

939
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:48,950
Six...

940
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,290
Seven...

941
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:49,650
Eight...

942
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,090
Nine...

943
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,890
Ten...

944
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,310
20...

945
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:58,790
What was it?

946
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,430
25 by 30 or something?

947
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:01,830
Five...

948
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:02,230
Ten...

949
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,710
Fifteen...

950
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,030
Twenty...

951
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,370
Twenty...

952
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,630
Five...

953
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,990
Ten...

954
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,570
Fifteen...

955
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,070
Twenty...

956
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:06,630
Okay, yes.

957
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,310
Okay, so this is...

958
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,550
One...

959
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:13,350
One...

960
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,310
One...

961
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:14,550
Two...

962
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:14,930
Three...

963
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:15,330
Four...

964
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,750
Five...

965
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,430
Five...

966
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,110
One...

967
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:22,370
Two...

968
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:22,690
Three...

969
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,170
Four...

970
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,170
There we go.

971
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,090
Ahh...

972
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,110
Seventeen...

973
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,730
Maybe somewhere in the middle, no?

974
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,220
They had to Photoshop Chris Evans to be skinny in Captain America, what?

975
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,900
What do you mean?

976
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,600
What?

977
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,640
It's melting my brain.

978
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,100
Me too.

979
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,380
It's a little gun shooting.

980
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,710
Fifteen...

981
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,270
Sixteen...

982
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,830
Seventeen...

983
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,990
Five...

984
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,890
Ten...

985
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,310
Fi...

986
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,210
Fifteen...

987
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,010
Sixteen...

988
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:07,550
Seventeen...

989
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,230
Um...

990
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,810
Um...

991
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,390
Like that.

992
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,190
So then, would this be like this?

993
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,170
It seems to be the case.

994
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,110
Five...

995
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,150
Ten...

996
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,890
Fifteen...

997
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:19,150
Sixteen...

998
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,030
Yeah, yeah, okay.

999
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,170
And so...

1000
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,850
And so...

1001
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,290
Five...

1002
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,710
Five...

1003
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,450
Like that.

1004
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,520
Hum-hum...

1005
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,560
Hum-hum...

1006
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,630
Two...

1007
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,030
Three...

1008
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,370
Four...

1009
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,050
Five...

1010
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:35,450
Three...

1011
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,290
Now we're cooking.

1012
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,050
You sound tired?

1013
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,950
I am tired, but I'm also concentrated.

1014
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,890
Uh, I really didn't know what to do today.

1015
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,050
Okay.

1016
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:52,910
So I'm sorry that it's, you know, just me being like... Puzzle Cam.

1017
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,960
Mince more into Rich Evans than Chris Evans.

1018
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,460
Chris Evans is Captain America.

1019
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,740
Wait.

1020
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,700
There's another Evans, no?

1021
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,140
Oh, who's the other Evans?

1022
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,400
That's not Rich Evans.

1023
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,760
Who isn't into Rich Evans?

1024
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,360
So true.

1025
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,140
Chris Evans' real name.

1026
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,550
There's another Chris.

1027
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,770
Oh, maybe I'm thinking of Chris then.

1028
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,970
Because there's another Chris in the cinematic universes.

1029
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:50,430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

1030
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,450
Okay, that actually knocked out a ton.

1031
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,490
Oh, oh.

1032
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,210
I misread.

1033
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,090
I misread.

1034
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:01,790
Okay.

1035
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,220
Chris Hemsworth.

1036
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1037
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,440
He is...

1038
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,100
Thor.

1039
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,960
Loki is Chris, too?

1040
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,800
No, Loki is...

1041
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,660
Cumberbatch.

1042
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,080
1, 2, 3, 4...

1043
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,860
Chris...

1044
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,600
Chris...

1045
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,180
What's his name?

1046
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:33,900
Not Chris.

1047
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,280
No.

1048
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,540
Benedict Cumberbatch.

1049
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,660
No?

1050
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,520
I'm wrong?

1051
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,380
Oh, Tom.

1052
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,880
Thomas Hiddleston.

1053
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,840
Hiddleston.

1054
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,040
Hiddleston.

1055
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,660
I said it with such confidence, too.

1056
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,520
Cumberbatch is Dr. Strange.

1057
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,020
I'll never understand any of this.

1058
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,700
7, 8, 9.

1059
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,620
I swear...

1060
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,680
I'll never understand...

1061
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,920
2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1062
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,720
5, 6, 7, 8.

1063
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,920
It's not worth understanding.

1064
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,240
Chris Pratt is Star-Lord.

1065
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,560
That is...

1066
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,680
Guardians of the Galaxy.

1067
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,170
I know, I know.

1068
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,020
He's Mario, unfortunately.

1069
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,520
Yeah.

1070
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,080
I know that, too.

1071
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1072
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1073
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,710
I was like...

1074
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,290
I was about to say, did I mess up?

1075
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,070
Oh my gosh, I was so scared for a second.

1076
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,380
Okay, nice.

1077
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,240
We got a side.

1078
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,960
That's always...

1079
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,200
That's always a good thing to get.

1080
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,360
Yeah.

1081
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,090
I believed in you.

1082
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,490
Yeah!

1083
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,390
Just joined.

1084
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,490
Is this Minesweeper?

1085
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,210
Mm-hmm.

1086
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,410
And if I get it wrong, we all explode.

1087
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:17,430
I put a little bit of ectoplasm inside each and every one of your brains.

1088
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,730
And if I get it wrong...

1089
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,990
I will activate that ectoplasm.

1090
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,170
So that...

1091
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,070
Isn't every single person here...

1092
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:31,590
Goes...

1093
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,510
Keep nono grabbing, but it explodes.

1094
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:42,930
Luckily...

1095
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,390
I'm...

1096
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,150
I'm...

1097
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,350
I'm pretty good at this.

1098
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1099
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,410
Luckily, you have nothing to worry about.

1100
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,350
You would trust me.

1101
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,410
Or you would trust your life...

1102
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,030
In my hand.

1103
00:54:59,330 --> 00:54:59,890
Right?

1104
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,250
You would.

1105
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,790
You would.

1106
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,960
This is probably like that.

1107
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:13,860
And then...

1108
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,440
Like that.

1109
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1110
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,780
I hope that's right.

1111
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,240
Or else we're...

1112
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,000
Going out!

1113
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,320
We're going to hell, baby!

1114
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,500
Oh my gosh.

1115
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,200
Have you guys seen that ride at Disneyland?

1116
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,480
Okay.

1117
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,800
It's called...

1118
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,710
I always confuse it with the Mr. Bones Wild Ride.

1119
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,030
It's, uh...

1120
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,470
Mr. Toad's...

1121
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,490
Wacky Bizarre Adventure or something.

1122
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:48,450
Wait.

1123
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,830
Mr. Toad Ride.

1124
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,270
Mr....

1125
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,010
Oh, it is Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1126
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:55,830
Wait.

1127
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,910
What's Mr. Bones?

1128
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,490
Wacky Bizarre Adventure or something.

1129
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,570
See you guys at Respawn.

1130
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:03,990
Trust in Minto.

1131
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:05,210
Yeah.

1132
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,970
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1133
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,610
I've never seen the movie.

1134
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,290
Mr. Bones is the rollercoaster tycoon map.

1135
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:16,750
Yeah, yeah.

1136
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,790
Is it also called Mr. Bones Wild Ride?

1137
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:20,350
Okay.

1138
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,550
So basically, I'm going to describe to you...

1139
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,190
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1140
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:30,410
And Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is...

1141
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,270
Okay.

1142
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,930
So...

1143
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,490
I've never seen the movie, like I said.

1144
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,290
But you...

1145
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,050
I don't know.

1146
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,710
You are in a car.

1147
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,250
And you're like...

1148
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:43,850
Beep, beep.

1149
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:44,750
Broop, broop.

1150
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:45,910
I'm Mr. Toad.

1151
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,270
And I'm driving here.

1152
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,410
And you're driving, you're driving, you're driving.

1153
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:50,970
And then...

1154
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,670
This is the ride, okay?

1155
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:53,410
You're driving.

1156
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,450
And you're getting into all sorts of shenanigans.

1157
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,990
You're crashing into people.

1158
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,310
You almost get run over by a train.

1159
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,430
You are...

1160
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,350
You are on the wildest ride of your life.

1161
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,190
And then...

1162
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,230
And then...

1163
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,870
You have to pay for your crimes.

1164
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,850
And so you go to court...

1165
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,350
And you are sentenced...

1166
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:13,670
Guilty!

1167
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:14,790
And you are...

1168
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:15,930
Sentenced to death.

1169
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,010
And then at the end of the ride...

1170
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,310
You get sent to hell.

1171
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,190
And then it ends.

1172
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,640
And so...

1173
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,940
At the end of the ride...

1174
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,420
You are driving around in hell.

1175
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,380
And then it ends.

1176
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,060
The end.

1177
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,980
Sounds like a fever dream.

1178
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,440
No, it's a wild ride.

1179
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,240
It's so... It's such a funny ride, no?

1180
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,040
Oh, wait.

1181
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,300
Oh, one, two, I can't count.

1182
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,720
I was right the first time.

1183
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,540
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1184
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,220
But I've never seen the movie, so I really actually... I feel like it's a good advertisement for it, no?

1185
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,540
Because it makes you want to be like... What is this about?

1186
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,860
This one's so confusing.

1187
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,400
I should probably lock in, huh?

1188
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,640
Or else I'm gonna get...

1189
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:22,880
Stupid.

1190
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,260
One?

1191
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,840
Okay, five, ten.

1192
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,570
Five, ten, eleven, twelve.

1193
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:39,970
Wait.

1194
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,750
It has to be this.

1195
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,590
It has to be that, no?

1196
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,030
One, two, three, wait.

1197
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:53,630
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1198
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,170
Like that?

1199
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,070
Is that right?

1200
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,550
I can't count!

1201
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:03,950
I can't count.

1202
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,600
Makes you go, what the F is this?

1203
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,500
I must know more.

1204
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,080
Apparently he never dies in the movie.

1205
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,540
Then why are we in hell?

1206
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,720
In the ride!

1207
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,260
Why are we in hell in the ride?

1208
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,680
Press C?

1209
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,000
Ah, I forgot about this!

1210
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

1211
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,120
I completely forgot about this feature.

1212
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,840
Ah, thank you!

1213
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,880
Thank you!

1214
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,640
Thank you!

1215
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,080
Thank you!

1216
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,840
Okay, so here's an example of like a tricky part, right?

1217
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,320
So it's one, two, five.

1218
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,400
You could assume...

1219
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,140
You can't assume in this game because...

1220
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,360
Guys, this could be one, and then two here, and then five.

1221
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,660
Or, it could be five, where you connect this, and then two, and then one.

1222
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,390
It's, it's very...

1223
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,180
It's very, very tricky.

1224
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,460
Okay.

1225
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,520
And we just...

1226
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,000
Figured it out.

1227
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,600
And we just...

1228
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,260
We just...

1229
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,320
We just figured it out.

1230
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,780
The trick...

1231
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,120
Is in the possibilities.

1232
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:37,950
Two.

1233
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:39,590
Yes.

1234
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,970
I feel like one...

1235
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,830
Oh, okay.

1236
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,730
So this should be 11.

1237
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:49,330
Yeah.

1238
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,270
Okay, nice!

1239
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:51,910
Nice, nice, nice.

1240
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,630
One.

1241
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,390
How far is 10?

1242
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,930
If Doom has taught me anything, you just...

1243
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,750
You don't need to die to go to hell.

1244
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,150
You just need to be angry in that.

1245
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,570
I was looking at...

1246
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,330
I don't wanna...

1247
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,910
The new Nothing Phone.

1248
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,010
Have you guys seen it?

1249
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:12,730
The Nothing Phone 3?

1250
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:14,670
I even...

1251
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:14,730
I even...

1252
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,170
There was even an ad for it.

1253
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,110
In Japan.

1254
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,530
But, um...

1255
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,570
There's...

1256
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,270
There's like...

1257
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,450
I...

1258
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,290
I'm kind of a sucker for like...

1259
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,610
Phones with gimmicks, you know?

1260
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,430
The what?

1261
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:29,710
It's the Nothing Phone!

1262
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,110
It's the Nothing Phone!

1263
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,830
It's got like no stupid bloatware on it or anything.

1264
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,930
And, uh...

1265
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,450
Um...

1266
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:47,710
What's the gimmick?

1267
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,730
I'm about to tell you.

1268
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,610
So the...

1269
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,130
It has a little gimmick on it.

1270
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:52,670
Or on the back of the phone.

1271
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:53,910
Um...

1272
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,330
On the top right...

1273
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:56,950
Part of the screen.

1274
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,330
Or the...

1275
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:58,610
The...

1276
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,230
Not the screen.

1277
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,210
The back of the phone.

1278
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,110
There's a tiny little like...

1279
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:03,270
Pixel circle.

1280
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,050
And you can...

1281
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,550
Put apps on it.

1282
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,290
Like...

1283
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,970
You can put like a spin the bottle app on it.

1284
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,750
Or a timer on it.

1285
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:13,410
Or...

1286
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,470
Um...

1287
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,450
You can even use it as like...

1288
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,630
A tiny...

1289
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:18,890
Pixelated...

1290
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,290
Pixelated...

1291
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:21,950
Uh...

1292
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:22,470
Camera?

1293
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,790
If you're like using the back...

1294
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,910
Camera to try and take a selfie.

1295
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:31,150
And the reason I brought it up is because...

1296
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,810
I saw a comment...

1297
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,610
Of someone saying...

1298
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:36,050
How long is it going to take...

1299
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,590
Before they put Doom on this tiny...

1300
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,610
On the tiny screen!

1301
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,110
And you know what?

1302
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,110
Valid question.

1303
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,550
No time at all.

1304
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:51,310
I know, right?

1305
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,490
Flip phones had this feature in 2007.

1306
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,330
Yeah, but we've regressed with phones a lot.

1307
01:02:59,630 --> 01:02:59,970
You know?

1308
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,230
We truly have.

1309
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,670
See?

1310
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:07,870
This could be one, one.

1311
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,710
And then two.

1312
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:09,510
And then...

1313
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,110
Another two.

1314
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:10,770
And then five.

1315
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,770
So we cannot trust.

1316
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,230
Hmm...

1317
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,450
We used to have so many cool features on phones.

1318
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,810
And now every phone is the same.

1319
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,410
So that's why I think I get so excited over like...

1320
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,470
A little gimmick like that.

1321
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:27,630
Spin the bottle app.

1322
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,190
Feeling old.

1323
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,970
I remember when actual bottles were a thing.

1324
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,710
I was gonna say...

1325
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,250
You remember when actual spin the bottle was a thing?

1326
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,190
Because, uh...

1327
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,730
Wow, you did...

1328
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,010
You played spin the bottle?

1329
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,830
What are you, a Riaju or something?

1330
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,570
Hmm...

1331
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:44,830
Riaju.

1332
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,230
Playing spin the bottle.

1333
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:51,490
One...

1334
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,630
One...

1335
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,110
Two...

1336
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,310
Three...

1337
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:55,470
Four...

1338
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,310
Wait, hold on.

1339
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,110
It was here, right?

1340
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:57,870
Oh no, it was here.

1341
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:00,770
One...

1342
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,190
Two...

1343
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,870
Three...

1344
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:02,610
Four...

1345
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,070
Five...

1346
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:03,430
Six...

1347
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,910
Seven...

1348
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:04,270
Eight...

1349
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:04,730
Nine...

1350
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,630
Ten...

1351
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,410
Wait, what were bottles invented?

1352
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,430
No one actually played spin the bottle?

1353
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,010
It was a meme?

1354
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:17,150
You're gonna tell me next that...

1355
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,870
Seven minutes in heaven wasn't real either.

1356
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,980
You're gonna tell me that...

1357
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,800
Nobody ever did seven minutes in heaven either.

1358
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,120
We can make it real?

1359
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,580
We can make it real?

1360
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,520
Ooh, that lot!

1361
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,080
Sucker for gimmicks reminds me I have to...

1362
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,000
Still get myself a play date.

1363
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,240
Gameboy with a crank is the gimmick.

1364
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,680
Haha!

1365
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,360
Wait, I don't know that.

1366
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,560
Sorry Mint, they don't actually go to heaven.

1367
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,160
You know, from my experience, that might be for the best.

1368
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:56,240
Huh?

1369
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:01,350
Let's see...

1370
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,410
Two...

1371
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,470
One...

1372
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,990
Wait, two...

1373
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,850
One...

1374
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,270
Space...

1375
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,470
Eight...

1376
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,150
Nine...

1377
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:11,250
Okay.

1378
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,770
Play date actually has some good games on it too?

1379
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:18,330
Really?

1380
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,470
Wait, I've never heard of this thing.

1381
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:20,950
I don't know.

1382
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,870
How have I never heard?

1383
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:27,030
Yes...

1384
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,510
One...

1385
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:29,930
One...

1386
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:30,970
One...

1387
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:31,310
Two...

1388
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,270
Three...

1389
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:33,230
Four...

1390
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,070
Five...

1391
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:34,510
Oh my goodness.

1392
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,190
And now we have eight here.

1393
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,240
Wait...

1394
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,480
Like that?

1395
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,340
And we can get rid of that.

1396
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,160
So far, this one's not as...

1397
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,740
As evil as the one before.

1398
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,560
Better to be with Minto than be in heaven.

1399
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,820
No, don't say that.

1400
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,980
Unique indie handheld.

1401
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:09,660
Whoa!

1402
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,960
This looks like a hand.

1403
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,980
Maybe.

1404
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,300
One...

1405
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:20,440
Space.

1406
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:27,940
Nice.

1407
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,900
I'm gonna check if there's any mistakes.

1408
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:33,340
Just wait.

1409
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,360
I'm a genius.

1410
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,020
I'm a genius.

1411
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:38,540
I'm a genius.

1412
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:38,700
I'm a genius.

1413
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:42,640
Nice.

1414
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,100
Stars.

1415
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,240
Win with Minto.

1416
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,220
I'm in heaven.

1417
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,620
Stop!

1418
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,380
Stop!

1419
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,460
Stop!

1420
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:54,740
Stop!

1421
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,660
Stop!

1422
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,000
You're just making fun of me.

1423
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:23,180
Wait.

1424
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,300
I think I messed this up.

1425
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,740
Yeah, there we go.

1426
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,080
That should be right.

1427
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,800
I hope...

1428
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,280
I hope...

1429
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,820
She doesn't believe us.

1430
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,200
I...

1431
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,120
I...

1432
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,560
I...

1433
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,060
Don't believe many things.

1434
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,840
But I do believe in ghosts.

1435
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,580
And I should do.

1436
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,330
How am I supposed to know this?

1437
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,050
Twenty.

1438
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,170
Eleven.

1439
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:06,150
One...

1440
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:06,190
Ghost?

1441
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,470
You are watching a ghost right now.

1442
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,390
I'm afraid of no ghosts.

1443
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,370
One...

1444
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:22,570
Space.

1445
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:24,230
Okay.

1446
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,030
Yeah, I did that one.

1447
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:27,770
Space...

1448
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,970
Like that, okay.

1449
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,350
Hopefully that's right.

1450
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,470
I'm scared.

1451
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:37,430
What if it's not?

1452
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,510
This one's bizarre so far.

1453
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,510
Do you believe that we love and support you?

1454
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:04,650
I

1455
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:09,860
don't know.

1456
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,150
Rose means love at first sight.

1457
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,010
Okay, but I really... I don't like this...

1458
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,590
Taste of rose.

1459
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,510
I don't think I'm alone in that either.

1460
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,970
I don't like the... You know, like if something's a rose...

1461
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:44,650
Taste.

1462
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,150
You know, like a rose tea or rose drink.

1463
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,330
Oh wait, that's the same.

1464
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:50,350
Rose...

1465
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:51,270
Rose...

1466
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,670
I don't like it.

1467
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,930
I don't believe in ghosts.

1468
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,130
There's a mass hallucination caused by gasoline.

1469
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,930
Also blue, thank you.

1470
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,810
I believe in one ghost.

1471
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,110
Thanks for showcasing this game.

1472
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,510
I love Picross likes.

1473
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,750
Thank you.

1474
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,030
Me too.

1475
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:12,690
Space.

1476
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:16,730
Can't be that.

1477
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:17,730
Okay, okay, okay.

1478
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,510
You don't like rose, but what about Jack?

1479
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,470
Oh my gosh, Titanic watch along.

1480
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:40,810
Okay.

1481
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,270
Okay, so because this one is a one...

1482
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,570
This one has to be the one...

1483
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,030
Other one.

1484
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,190
Because...

1485
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,650
It's above...

1486
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:51,450
The two.

1487
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,350
So there's no way it would be the two, you know?

1488
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,930
So we finally figured that out.

1489
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,690
We finally figured that out.

1490
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:01,310
Good, good.

1491
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,020
Isn't Turkish delight...

1492
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,680
Oh my gosh, I had Turkish delight once.

1493
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,320
And I...

1494
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,740
Hated it.

1495
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:12,880
Maybe...

1496
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,260
I didn't wait.

1497
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,480
Is it actually rose flavored?

1498
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,660
Maybe that's why I hated it.

1499
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,020
Two.

1500
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,970
Ah, hate.

1501
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:29,790
Hate it.

1502
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,830
It's like the most disappointing sweet ever.

1503
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,070
It's not a delight at all.

1504
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,690
It's such false advertising.

1505
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,390
Oh, this scared me.

1506
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,330
I was like, oh no, there's not enough room for six.

1507
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,430
Okay, so then...

1508
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,690
We can do...

1509
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:50,190
That.

1510
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,090
And that.

1511
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,990
Good, good, good, good, good.

1512
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,290
How am I supposed to know this?

1513
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,630
Oh, that's why.

1514
01:11:59,870 --> 01:11:59,990
Hold on, hold on.

1515
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:00,930
I didn't realize.

1516
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,330
I didn't seal it up.

1517
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:07,350
We're like, running out of blue spots, you know?

1518
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:26,570
Yes.

1519
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,140
We'll be sure to gift you Turkish delight.

1520
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,300
You'll watch me spit it out.

1521
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,720
Never care for Turkish disappointment.

1522
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,160
At least you know what you're getting.

1523
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,240
You know?

1524
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,880
Imagine being advertised as a Turkish delight.

1525
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,620
And it just makes you feel dread and anger.

1526
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:56,940
Oh.

1527
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,320
Oh my gosh, I was looking...

1528
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:58,720
I was...

1529
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,600
I thought I was looking at this one and being like...

1530
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,460
Oh my gosh, no.

1531
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,060
Oh no, stop.

1532
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,180
Stop.

1533
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,460
I was scared for a second.

1534
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,260
So, did a cute girl make you waffles today?

1535
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,860
Or did you get something else for breakfast?

1536
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,740
In the end...

1537
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,120
My breakfast was so disappointing.

1538
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,540
In the end, I had to have leftover pizza.

1539
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,940
It was the last of my leftover pizza.

1540
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,080
Why are you eating roses, Minky?

1541
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,080
Taste of rose...

1542
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,000
There's a...

1543
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,720
Actually, rose flavored stuff is so common though, no?

1544
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,760
I feel...

1545
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,460
Yeah, I feel like I see rose flavored things all the time.

1546
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,100
Horrible.

1547
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:10,840
I don't know.

1548
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,860
Seven...

1549
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,280
Yeah, okay.

1550
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,090
What is this?

1551
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,770
It looks like a mangled hand.

1552
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,050
I can't tell.

1553
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,710
I had leftover pizza.

1554
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,250
Besties!

1555
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,090
How do you know I didn't possess you and eat your pizza?

1556
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,050
You know?

1557
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:52,730
I'm just saying, it's more likely than you think, possession.

1558
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,730
Position.

1559
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,100
More than once.

1560
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,650
That's it!

1561
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,660
Hmm, hmm.

1562
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,900
What toppings?

1563
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,200
Do you really wanna know?

1564
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,260
You won't judge me?

1565
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,120
People get so defensive over their pizza choices.

1566
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,680
Their pizza toppings?

1567
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,580
They say, if you don't have the same topping as me...

1568
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,400
You are...

1569
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,560
Considered...

1570
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,120
The devil.

1571
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,620
No judgment, Minto?

1572
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,840
I'll judge you a little.

1573
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:35,460
Okay!

1574
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,700
I had...

1575
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,020
It was a...

1576
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,140
It was a pineapple and spinach.

1577
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:40,340
Spinach.

1578
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,200
I've been trying to eat more spinach lately.

1579
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,230
I like making spinach...

1580
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,180
And...

1581
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,200
Sesame oil.

1582
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:55,920
You know, you can...

1583
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,200
Wait.

1584
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,000
You can what?

1585
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,200
Oh, sorry.

1586
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,290
You can just ask me when someone's talking...

1587
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,880
Sulkababa's homemade pizza.

1588
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,520
That sounds yummy.

1589
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,800
Homemade pizza?

1590
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,560
Fancy.

1591
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:10,660
Fancy, fancy.

1592
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,580
I didn't...

1593
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:15,940
That's right.

1594
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,340
We did it!

1595
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,680
Oh my gosh!

1596
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,460
We actually finished a row!

1597
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,350
A row.

1598
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:29,850
Wait.

1599
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,490
Just kidding.

1600
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:31,010
Oh shoot.

1601
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:32,470
Uh...

1602
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,910
Actual undue moment.

1603
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:35,690
GULULU GULU GULU!

1604
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,010
GULU GULU GULU!

1605
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,790
Actual rewind moment.

1606
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,530
I don't know if this is a 2.

1607
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,350
Wait, actually, what is this?

1608
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,110
Yeah, see, see, see?

1609
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,350
You can never be so sure.

1610
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,910
You can never be so sure.

1611
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,670
I have no clue what's going on, but this is fire.

1612
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,530
I'm glad you like it.

1613
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,750
Glad when we can just kind of chill.

1614
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,590
Sorry, I'm very low energy today.

1615
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:13,550
I'm... oh.

1616
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,450
I'm just so scared.

1617
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,690
Oh, I'm scared.

1618
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,590
I was like, I won't cry on stream.

1619
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:26,470
I won't do it, but I'm scared.

1620
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:36,330
Ah, wait.

1621
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,930
Oh, no!

1622
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,410
Mistake!

1623
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,930
Wait, wait, grudu grudu.

1624
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:48,930
Uh-oh.

1625
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,990
Just wait a minute.

1626
01:17:59,090 --> 01:17:59,610
Here.

1627
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,670
Okay, I felt like this had to be... wait.

1628
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,250
And here.

1629
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:08,710
Oh, yeah.

1630
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:09,770
Wait, this is... wait.

1631
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,010
Eh?

1632
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:10,510
Oh?

1633
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:11,010
Eh?

1634
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:11,450
Oh?

1635
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:11,970
Eh?

1636
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:14,450
Wait.

1637
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:17,820
Oh?

1638
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:18,380
Eh?

1639
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,120
Ah.

1640
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,800
Why did I put that?

1641
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,700
Why did I put that there?

1642
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,340
Because... yeah, obviously that doesn't even equal to 8.

1643
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,120
Maybe I meant to put...

1644
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,240
This... that... and I accidentally put...

1645
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,520
The X.

1646
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,560
I do that sometimes.

1647
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,020
Then this part is also wrong, right?

1648
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:40,500
It said?

1649
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,180
Oh.

1650
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,580
Oh, I think that's why I got it wrong.

1651
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,280
Maybe I just miscounted.

1652
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,840
Oh, I think that's why I got it.

1653
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,460
That's why I got it.

1654
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,380
Oh, I think that's why I got it.

1655
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:04,520
This is a lot of Q-L... Q-O-L features that I like from a PCross.

1656
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,140
Right!

1657
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,820
It's actually so...

1658
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,040
It's so easy to get into.

1659
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,200
It's so nice.

1660
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,720
Your appointment is going to be fine.

1661
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,100
But head pats and hugs make you feel better.

1662
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:20,960
Thank you.

1663
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:21,940
I'm so scared.

1664
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,300
I've never had the tube.

1665
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,560
For those who don't know, I have a doctor's appointment for my throat tomorrow.

1666
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,780
No, it's not hot dog at all.

1667
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:33,980
Huh.

1668
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,760
It's going to be nervous.

1669
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,700
Wisps only wish Minto the best at their appointment.

1670
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,620
And that you'll come out stronger and healthier than ever.

1671
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,400
Gamba, Minto.

1672
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,700
Thank you.

1673
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,080
Ghost doctor.

1674
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,000
Yes, at the Boospital.

1675
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,360
Yes, yes.

1676
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,380
You would think.

1677
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,440
After death, things would be easier, huh?

1678
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,860
What's the point of dying if I still get sick?

1679
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,220
What's the point?

1680
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:16,190
I see.

1681
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,410
This also feels wrong.

1682
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:28,950
I'm going to get sick!

1683
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,810
I'm going to

1684
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:37,060
get sick!

1685
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,200
I'm going to get sick!

1686
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:39,920
I'm going to get sick!

1687
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,340
Huh?

1688
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,000
Maybe I just counted wrong.

1689
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:44,200
Oh?

1690
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,940
Maybe I counted...

1691
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,280
No, right?

1692
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,320
Life or death, existence is suffering...

1693
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,140
Exactly!

1694
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:54,420
Exactly!

1695
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,200
But this is impossible.

1696
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,180
I can't fit three...

1697
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,420
Oh, the two is over here!

1698
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,860
I'm a silly Willy.

1699
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,720
That's why I was so confused.

1700
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,920
The developer Jupiter Core made a lot of PCOS games, especially my Nintendo.

1701
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1702
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,220
I didn't remember that.

1703
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,460
That's what you're making.

1704
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,500
That should be that.

1705
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:40,980
What?

1706
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,620
Wait, where did the 11 go?

1707
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,440
Yes.

1708
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:49,740
I think so.

1709
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,100
I think so.

1710
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,480
I think so.

1711
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:55,920
Oh...

1712
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:02,590
That's right.

1713
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,650
There we go.

1714
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:06,970
Sure.

1715
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,430
See, it's so easy for me to accidentally click the wrong thing.

1716
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:12,230
That's great!

1717
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,890
I had camera down my throat last week.

1718
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,850
Took only 15 minutes and I slept through it.

1719
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,610
I don't think...

1720
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:19,990
I don't think I'm sleeping.

1721
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,490
I don't think so.

1722
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:23,950
Support me!

1723
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,070
Thank you!

1724
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:27,110
I think I'm gonna be...

1725
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:29,090
Awake though!

1726
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,150
Cause wouldn't they tell me?

1727
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:37,010
That...

1728
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:37,730
Um...

1729
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:38,870
I need someone to...

1730
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,870
Drive me there.

1731
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:40,330
Sorry.

1732
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,880
I'm scared!

1733
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,460
The down the mouth is too scary.

1734
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,240
I could...

1735
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,080
Reach the throat from the butt.

1736
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:06,560
So true.

1737
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,640
I think someone else had to do that too.

1738
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,760
Kind of like a two-in-one deal.

1739
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,060
I'm too scared.

1740
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,260
I don't wanna think about it.

1741
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,540
They did genius.

1742
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,810
You can do it, Bryce.

1743
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,190
I have to.

1744
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,210
That's the only thing.

1745
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,890
It's not that I can do it.

1746
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,850
It's not that I have to...

1747
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,710
Have to do it.

1748
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:53,730
No matter if I want to or not.

1749
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,010
Maybe I should...

1750
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:01,810
I don't know.

1751
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,050
I'll expose myself to more pains.

1752
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,710
It's what being a ghost is all about.

1753
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:12,650
Being in pain.

1754
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,690
I got it.

1755
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,100
Still no idea what this picture is.

1756
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,280
I believe it has to be a corner of a painting.

1757
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,260
Because what the hell?

1758
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,380
What the hell?

1759
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,800
I don't know either.

1760
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,180
I like it.

1761
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,420
Yes, yes.

1762
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,720
Amazing!

1763
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,480
Very...

1764
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,120
Very...

1765
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:50,740
Wait,

1766
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,560
this is correct, right?

1767
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,480
Nope.

1768
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,040
It's so easy...

1769
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:01,820
To be wrong.

1770
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,140
Be so confidently wrong.

1771
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:09,900
If you walk in and see the tube looks suspiciously wisp-shaped, please pay me no mind.

1772
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,220
I mean pay it, don't worry.

1773
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,240
Yeah, I wish you guys could join me.

1774
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,460
Keep me company there.

1775
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,040
Wait,

1776
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,640
it kind of looks like a person...

1777
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,140
With...

1778
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,460
Killing another person.

1779
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,860
You guys see it?

1780
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:39,100
It kind of looks like this person's dead on the ground and this person's stabbing them.

1781
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:41,920
I think.

1782
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:47,170
There's so few blues here.

1783
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,270
Wait, how can I figure...

1784
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,570
Oh wait, this is 2...

1785
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:50,410
1-1.

1786
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:51,190
Oh, here we go.

1787
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:53,610
Wait.

1788
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:54,590
I messed up.

1789
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,090
Uh-oh.

1790
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,690
Uh-oh.

1791
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:00,740
Uh-oh.

1792
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:02,450
Uh-oh.

1793
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,090
Uh-oh.

1794
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:03,570
Wait, wait.

1795
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:05,890
Wait, wait.

1796
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,830
Oh, I... I mixed up the one.

1797
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:09,570
That's right.

1798
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:10,710
There we go.

1799
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,170
Okay.

1800
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:12,870
Just click.

1801
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,150
Awesome!

1802
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,170
Someone who has been awake for a camera in this...

1803
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:19,790
In this...

1804
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,450
In this...

1805
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,510
In the...

1806
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,310
Huh?

1807
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,000
It makes me flinch.

1808
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,820
It makes me...

1809
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:40,920
It makes me...

1810
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,040
Spiritually cringe.

1811
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:44,920
Oh.

1812
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,900
Oh, I don't like that.

1813
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,000
I don't like that one bit.

1814
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,500
I'm sure you didn't either.

1815
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,980
I'm sure you also didn't like that one bit.

1816
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:12,940
I'm sure you're ready.

1817
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,860
And just like that, you're ready.

1818
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:15,560
I'm...

1819
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,260
That doesn't make me feel any better.

1820
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,240
That doesn't make...

1821
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,300
I don't think so.

1822
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,120
I feel like I might pass out actually.

1823
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:29,820
Okay...

1824
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,420
Two...

1825
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,160
One... Oh, wait, no.

1826
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,400
There we go, okay.

1827
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,780
I'm mixed.

1828
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,600
Uh, so this is four.

1829
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,140
There we go, okay.

1830
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,720
And then two and one, okay.

1831
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,140
Two...

1832
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,870
One...

1833
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,350
Two.

1834
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:10,330
Okay.

1835
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:12,470
Two.

1836
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,920
I can't... I think it's someone getting stabbed.

1837
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,360
I think it's someone getting stabbed.

1838
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,920
I believe.

1839
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,480
Get stabbed, get stabbed.

1840
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,200
I'll say.

1841
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,040
Who's that?

1842
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,080
Oh.

1843
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:45,360
... Wolfen.

1844
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:47,500
ok.

1845
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:07,050
...etsu ni it we Yeah ...

1846
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:32,810
A serious paper cut.

1847
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:34,990
Vermeer?

1848
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,750
Yeah, that's what I was thinking!

1849
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:36,450
Yeah, Vermeer!

1850
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:41,890
Oh my gosh, we do!

1851
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,570
Oh my gosh, we do!

1852
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,210
We do!

1853
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:03,790
Oh my gosh, this is the first sentence.

1854
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:09,610
So, the use of the技術 is wonderful, but this is the story of the story.

1855
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:16,550
At the time, the letter is a very small number of words.

1856
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:25,950
That's why, the letter is a far away from the相手 and a直接 to meet the相手 and the relationship between the two and the relationship.

1857
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,630
What was the letter?

1858
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:30,830
How was the letter?

1859
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:33,750
Do you think it's related to the story behind the world's map?

1860
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:45,610
See, I didn't even notice the map on the wall, but Vermeer has a very specific way of...

1861
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:49,770
of painting clothing and also, like...

1862
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:54,410
the... the... the brightness of the color, so I could tell.

1863
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,290
Letter from a lover?

1864
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:01,510
Ooh la la!

1865
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:03,170
You think it's steamy?

1866
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:04,950
Thanks for this chill stream.

1867
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:05,590
Had a long day.

1868
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:06,590
Not bad, just long.

1869
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:08,510
That was good that it wasn't bad.

1870
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:11,850
And this is just the speed for me.

1871
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:12,730
I love this game, too.

1872
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,190
Love all the stuff you've been up to lately.

1873
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:14,870
Take care of yourself.

1874
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,830
Thank you, Lunar!

1875
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:16,690
Thank you!

1876
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:19,110
You take it easy, too.

1877
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:24,530
I know my art.

1878
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,710
I know just a few artists.

1879
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:27,550
Yeah.

1880
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:30,810
Privet from Russia!

1881
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:36,210
Speaking of museums, be sure to visit St. Petersburg... St. Petersburg someday!

1882
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:38,070
It's one of the most beautiful cities.

1883
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:43,190
Full of museums, theaters, and other cultural attractions related to our thousand-year history!

1884
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,130
Oh!

1885
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:46,050
Spasiba!

1886
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:50,090
Thank you!

1887
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:50,950
I want to go.

1888
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:52,350
You sound so nice, right?

1889
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,410
Okay, okay, okay!

1890
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,870
Okay, okay, okay.

1891
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,210
Thank you so much!

1892
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:09,670
Yeah, what is...

1893
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,890
I actually... there was a book I read...

1894
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,670
...a long time ago.

1895
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,150
I can't remember.

1896
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,170
I can't remember...

1897
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:20,530
I can't remember...

1898
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:21,690
...what it was called.

1899
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:23,450
But it was very...

1900
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:24,530
...about...

1901
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,330
...like, uh...

1902
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,750
Vermeer's paintings, and...

1903
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,470
...um...

1904
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:29,790
It was... it was like a mystery...

1905
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:31,310
...one of those mystery-type thing...

1906
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:33,090
...like, books, where it's like...

1907
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,990
...there's a hidden meaning in the painting!

1908
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:38,210
Like, a national treasure-type thing.

1909
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,870
Oh, it might have been Chasing Vermeer!

1910
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:41,330
Hold on.

1911
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,350
Maybe?

1912
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:48,460
Maybe?

1913
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:48,560
Maybe?

1914
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,460
2004 Children's Mystery Novel.

1915
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,900
Might have been.

1916
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,580
Is that me in the painting?

1917
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,740
Might be.

1918
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:07,740
If I...

1919
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:08,980
What if I...

1920
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,380
Well, I don't look like her.

1921
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,360
Maybe I was her, and then I...

1922
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,580
...died, and then I reincarnated, and then I died again.

1923
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,780
Was Vermeer a good runner?

1924
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,080
Bust in his class!

1925
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,640
Well, you can call someone up, and you'd be like...

1926
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,020
Was your Vermeer running?

1927
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,180
Because you better go chase it!

1928
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:38,290
I live!

1929
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:38,790
I die!

1930
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,030
I live again!

1931
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:41,370
And I died.

1932
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:52,110
That one didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would.

1933
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:56,990
I guess a 25 by 30 is pretty doable for us, huh?

1934
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,710
We're that good.

1935
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,470
We're that good.

1936
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:02,610
Let's see.

1937
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,870
We could do the 25 by 15.

1938
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:08,670
Let's do that one.

1939
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:13,470
It's such a strange shape.

1940
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,290
I make it look easy.

1941
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,910
No way.

1942
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:27,010
Like I said, I feel like I'm actually quite slow at these.

1943
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,830
Because I have to do so much counting.

1944
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:33,310
Six.

1945
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,330
Five.

1946
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:37,890
Four.

1947
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,050
Four.

1948
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:40,870
Two.

1949
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:41,790
Wait, okay.

1950
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,350
One.

1951
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:43,690
Two.

1952
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,430
I should've...

1953
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:46,870
Whatever.

1954
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:47,670
Wait.

1955
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:48,730
Six.

1956
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:49,730
Ah!

1957
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,970
No, no, no!

1958
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,270
My finger slipped.

1959
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:58,950
Wait, yeah, space.

1960
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:02,430
Actually, I like to use these as the spaces.

1961
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:03,850
Space.

1962
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:06,650
Space.

1963
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,570
Space.

1964
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:11,070
Okay, so one.

1965
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:12,070
Two.

1966
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:15,370
One, two, three, four.

1967
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:19,650
Maybe?

1968
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:22,370
One, two, three, four.

1969
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:24,170
Oh, wait.

1970
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,230
Five.

1971
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:27,190
Maybe?

1972
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,200
I can't tell if that's right or not.

1973
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,540
I can't tell.

1974
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,100
You're pretty good.

1975
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,280
At these.

1976
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,520
Your pace is steady.

1977
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:46,700
Quite good, to be honest.

1978
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,140
Well, thank you.

1979
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,950
I don't have the patience for these games, but you do.

1980
01:35:58,290 --> 01:35:59,630
Oh my gosh, James Cameron.

1981
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,590
Oh my gosh.

1982
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,050
I was thinking about you earlier.

1983
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,310
Because I was...

1984
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:06,470
I was...

1985
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:07,510
I don't remember why.

1986
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:11,050
I think I was talking to a friend about my VOD for Deal or No Deal.

1987
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:12,730
And then I was watching it.

1988
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:15,810
And part of the part that I was watching...

1989
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,050
You told me to...

1990
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:19,490
To...

1991
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:21,270
Pick one of the boxes.

1992
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,070
And I did.

1993
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:23,690
And I think it was the million.

1994
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,680
And I was just like...

1995
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:32,190
I was like, oh my gosh, James Cameron!

1996
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:38,730
Yeah!

1997
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:46,570
I think about you guys sometimes.

1998
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:47,630
You know?

1999
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:51,330
If I'm like out and about and I see something...

2000
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,390
If I'm like haunting...

2001
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:57,290
Doing my little, you know, ghostly paranormal activities...

2002
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:00,290
I see something that reminds you of you guys.

2003
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,930
I'll be like...

2004
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:02,030
Oh my gosh!

2005
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,130
Oh my gosh, that's like so and so.

2006
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:19,170
I guess the parasocialism runs deep.

2007
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:26,250
But it's just kind of like, I wonder how they're doing.

2008
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,270
I hope they're okay.

2009
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,990
I hope they're doing well.

2010
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:33,390
You know?

2011
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:39,050
Meow.

2012
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:44,110
But, you know, because of my name, I bet you guys are thinking about me all the time, huh?

2013
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:49,590
You guys, you brush your teeth and you're just like, mint flavored toothpaste.

2014
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:53,670
Or you go to the store and you're just like, mint ice cream.

2015
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,850
I'm everywhere.

2016
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,770
I'm actually haunting.

2017
01:37:59,130 --> 01:37:59,610
For real.

2018
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:08,170
Good branding.

2019
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:12,030
Did the parasocial relationship just become social?

2020
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,370
If you rainbow... Wait, what?

2021
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,310
Don't rainbow.

2022
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,150
If I rainbow super mint, she'll come through my monitor and call me stinky.

2023
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:25,510
No, no, no.

2024
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:29,330
You're thinking of Binto, my original character.

2025
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,170
Do not steal.

2026
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:36,290
I can safely say, eating mint ice cream has never been quite the same.

2027
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:38,430
Hahaha.

2028
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:38,910
Freak.

2029
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:39,590
Hahaha.

2030
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,510
Yeah, because of the name.

2031
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:43,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2032
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,310
Hmm.

2033
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:48,890
Hmm.

2034
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:54,010
I think about you every time I look at my arm.

2035
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,230
Oh my gosh.

2036
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:56,550
Sulk in your arm.

2037
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:57,350
You're crazy.

2038
01:38:59,090 --> 01:38:59,570
Crazy.

2039
01:38:59,730 --> 01:38:59,730
Crazy.

2040
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,390
One, two, three, four, five.

2041
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,060
One, one.

2042
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:09,480
One, two, three.

2043
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,380
I think.

2044
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,320
One, one, two, three, space.

2045
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:17,000
One, two, three, four, five.

2046
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:17,480
Oh.

2047
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,160
I think?

2048
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,540
But it still says there's more.

2049
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:28,680
Actually, Bob in chocolate ice cream the other day and was thinking of you.

2050
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:29,980
How are you spying on us?

2051
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:30,700
I'm a ghost.

2052
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:31,760
It's like my duty.

2053
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,380
It's my job.

2054
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,600
I had to cancel my food delivery because the store closed before they kick up a driver.

2055
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,660
I ordered it at the start of stream.

2056
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,240
What?

2057
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,880
So I'm going to cook something instead so you can have the...

2058
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,160
No!

2059
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:49,080
Phil!

2060
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:50,880
What?

2061
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,780
That sucks so much though.

2062
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,460
They're forcing you to be... to be responsible.

2063
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,280
Wait, hold on.

2064
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,040
Mint flavor stuff burns hotter than sriracha.

2065
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:09,960
Is that like the same gene that makes it so that you hate?

2066
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:14,510
What's that?

2067
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:15,810
What's that one plant?

2068
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:15,910
What's that one plant?

2069
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:18,270
It's not...

2070
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,130
It's, uh...

2071
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:22,970
Cilantro!

2072
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:24,730
I was like, parsley?

2073
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:27,190
Yes, the cilantro!

2074
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:30,830
Raise your hand if you have that.

2075
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:32,290
If you can't eat cilantro.

2076
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,950
Nadine's technically wrong about the chair.

2077
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:44,510
Upholstery often use a polished brass capable of bright reflection.

2078
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,110
So wait, hold on.

2079
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:46,770
That's so interesting.

2080
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:48,150
So as long...

2081
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:51,470
Sorry, every time I click out of the window, it stops the music.

2082
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:55,810
So as long as the sun shone directly on it through a window...

2083
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:58,930
I've seen it with my own eye.

2084
01:40:59,230 --> 01:40:59,630
Really?

2085
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:03,610
Upholstery often used a polished brass.

2086
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:05,930
You're just...

2087
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:08,830
You get flash banged by your chair.

2088
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:09,810
It would suck.

2089
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:15,090
I feel like I'm not doing this one quite right.

2090
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,230
But this would be one.

2091
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:20,050
One, two, three, four, five.

2092
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,730
Okay, maybe...

2093
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:23,370
Maybe...

2094
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:25,630
Um...

2095
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:26,590
Two, space.

2096
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,230
Two, space.

2097
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:30,350
One, two, three, space.

2098
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:32,470
One...

2099
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,170
Space.

2100
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,530
One, two, space.

2101
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:35,630
One, two, space.

2102
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:38,470
One, two, space.

2103
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:38,710
One, two, space.

2104
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:39,590
One, two, space.

2105
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,870
I don't understand this one.

2106
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:41,930
This one's def...

2107
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:42,490
Tricky.

2108
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:43,650
Because of the...

2109
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:45,530
I don't like when they're not as square.

2110
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:49,270
I wish I could enjoy cilantro.

2111
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,010
No!

2112
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,530
It's wideness is overwhelming.

2113
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:54,990
I know!

2114
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:57,810
Why'd I get flash banged by Minto?

2115
01:41:58,170 --> 01:41:58,530
Stop.

2116
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:01,110
Stop!

2117
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,940
This one confuses me.

2118
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,360
What am I missing?

2119
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,260
What am I doing wrong?

2120
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:11,980
Six.

2121
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,500
One, two, three, four, five.

2122
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,640
One, two, three, four.

2123
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,480
One, two, one.

2124
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,800
One, one, two.

2125
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:23,540
One, two, three, four.

2126
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,280
One, two, three, four, five.

2127
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,960
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2128
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,040
I suppose.

2129
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:42,360
Would you rather play Sudoku for all eternity or eat a bowl of cilantro?

2130
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,100
I can eat cilantro.

2131
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,880
So give me that cilantro, baby.

2132
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:47,920
Oh my gosh.

2133
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:48,840
I've heard of people.

2134
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,360
So there, you know, people will...

2135
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,100
Oh!

2136
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,280
Midcuts from Ayami's booth!

2137
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,180
Yay!

2138
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,160
Oh my gosh.

2139
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,300
Thank you for ordering, Barely.

2140
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:07,780
I love that thing where you say or do something IRL and you can instantly picture the chat's reactions.

2141
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,880
No, I don't want to think about that.

2142
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,940
I don't want to think about you guys perceiving me at all like that.

2143
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,420
That's way too embarrassing.

2144
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,700
But, um, going back to the eat a bowl of cilantro.

2145
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,920
There are some people that are like, that are like, I'm not good at eating my veggies.

2146
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,220
Not just veggies.

2147
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,500
I'm not good at eating my leafy greens.

2148
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,900
And so what they've done is they...

2149
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:31,520
Just look how...

2150
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:31,920
Oh my gosh.

2151
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:34,900
I'm blocking her, but she's so cute when she stares at the puzzle.

2152
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,220
Um, what they've done is they...

2153
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,010
To make it so that they...

2154
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,320
Will eat their leafy greens.

2155
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,180
They call it Dinosaur Time.

2156
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,920
And they pretend that they are a dinosaur.

2157
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,080
And they eat their...

2158
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,400
And apparently it really helps.

2159
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,890
It's kind of awesome.

2160
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:11,990
Just like tree stars.

2161
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:15,570
I mean, they made the tree stars look so delicious.

2162
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:18,430
They made them seem so delicious in the Land Before Time.

2163
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:20,590
I feel like it has to work.

2164
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,060
Dinosaur Time.

2165
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:27,920
Dino Time.

2166
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,040
Dinosaur Time.

2167
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:29,100
That's...

2168
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,060
That's my...

2169
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,720
Life and afterlife hack.

2170
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,420
Let's see.

2171
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:34,900
One.

2172
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:35,840
One.

2173
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:37,580
One, two, three, four.

2174
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:37,880
Okay.

2175
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,440
So it has to be...

2176
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:39,640
One.

2177
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,320
One, two, three, four.

2178
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,080
But is it one, one?

2179
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,040
Or...

2180
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:51,630
Tricky.

2181
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:53,150
Okay.

2182
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:54,110
So if I did...

2183
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:56,870
I think like...

2184
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:57,790
One, space.

2185
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,490
One, two, three, four.

2186
01:44:59,490 --> 01:44:59,570
Dinosaur.

2187
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:00,350
Yeah.

2188
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,130
Yeah.

2189
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:01,970
Yeah.

2190
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:02,950
Yeah.

2191
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,470
This one is so long.

2192
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:06,970
Confuses me.

2193
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:10,410
I'd eat a dinosaur.

2194
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,730
Don't do that.

2195
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,730
It's probably really...

2196
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:15,410
Tough.

2197
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,170
What do you mean pretend?

2198
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,930
Nah.

2199
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:25,170
You can put an X there.

2200
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:25,810
Wait, where?

2201
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:44,110
Under there?

2202
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:45,370
Under there?

2203
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:45,470
Under where?

2204
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:51,790
We eat T-Rex's ancestors all the time.

2205
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:52,270
True.

2206
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:57,010
The hard ones are because of all the small numbers.

2207
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,410
Yeah, that can be the case.

2208
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:08,250
She said underwear.

2209
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:13,150
I tricked the streamer into saying a silly word.

2210
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:18,390
Oh, this one confuses me.

2211
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,170
Two.

2212
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:20,830
Ah.

2213
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:21,730
Ah.

2214
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:23,170
Ah.

2215
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:25,170
Ah.

2216
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,050
Ah.

2217
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,620
What is this?

2218
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,120
Nothing.

2219
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:38,680
Click on it.

2220
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:39,240
It does nothing.

2221
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,860
Blue row.

2222
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,840
You can mark the second tile as an X.

2223
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:48,280
Second.

2224
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:48,900
What?

2225
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:49,460
This one.

2226
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:49,740
Why?

2227
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:49,900
Why?

2228
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,960
But how?

2229
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,180
Hmm.

2230
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:12,520
Would missing a stream because of an ecchi convention be considered excused apps?

2231
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:14,620
Wait.

2232
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,060
What?

2233
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,140
What's an ecchi convention?

2234
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,700
Will you take Minto along?

2235
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:28,180
Wait.

2236
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,160
Second from the right.

2237
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,340
Wait.

2238
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,000
Did I get it wrong?

2239
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:40,660
This?

2240
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:41,440
That's right.

2241
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:50,810
I believe you.

2242
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:52,410
I just don't know how you got it at all.

2243
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:59,320
It's an 18 plus anime convention.

2244
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:02,180
They have those?

2245
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:06,300
I was lurking whilst exercising.

2246
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:07,420
Can I go make dinner now?

2247
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:08,240
Have a good dinner!

2248
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:14,060
It's either two or one at the end.

2249
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:14,280
Yeah.

2250
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,700
So we can't mark anything else.

2251
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,680
But we can do that.

2252
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,360
Oh my gosh.

2253
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,080
We only have one row that's blue.

2254
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:21,700
Hold on.

2255
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,080
Okay.

2256
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,720
Only one row that's blue.

2257
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,040
I hate this.

2258
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:30,820
Two.

2259
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:45,010
So let's just assume this is...

2260
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,150
One.

2261
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:51,910
I think we have to assume.

2262
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:53,810
In that case.

2263
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:55,170
One.

2264
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,770
One, two, three.

2265
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:01,670
One, two, three.

2266
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:01,810
One, one, one.

2267
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:04,890
Like so.

2268
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:12,330
That's right.

2269
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:14,490
Yeah, because I don't think four...

2270
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:16,930
Two, two...

2271
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:17,490
Oh, what?

2272
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,110
Oh yeah, because there's a one too.

2273
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:19,790
Okay, so never mind.

2274
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:20,450
So...

2275
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:20,770
Oh wait.

2276
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:22,010
Wow...

2277
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:22,350
Wow...

2278
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:23,170
Gura gura gura gura gura.

2279
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,230
Maitake maitake.

2280
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:25,510
Gura gura gura gura.

2281
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:26,370
Yes.

2282
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:27,630
I messed up.

2283
01:49:27,630 --> 01:49:28,210
Oh, there we go.

2284
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,570
I did too many.

2285
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:34,170
Maitake maitake.

2286
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:35,550
Gura gura gura gura.

2287
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,250
Um...

2288
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:41,850
Two here.

2289
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:46,670
Gura gura gura.

2290
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:47,050
Yes.

2291
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,370
One, space.

2292
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:54,930
One, two, three, four.

2293
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:59,430
Uh oh.

2294
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:00,450
My chat froze.

2295
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:02,270
Give me one moment, please.

2296
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:08,110
Distracted by ecchi convention.

2297
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:10,890
I mean...

2298
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:12,830
You aren't...

2299
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:15,030
Incorrect.

2300
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:16,810
But also...

2301
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,590
Guys...

2302
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:25,890
I...

2303
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:29,050
What should we do for 400,000 subscribers?

2304
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,430
We're gonna get there eventually.

2305
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:33,490
I think?

2306
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:36,870
What should we do?

2307
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,170
Party!

2308
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,950
E400,000 leaves of cilantro.

2309
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,870
It's also spooky.

2310
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,300
It's quite a spooky...

2311
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:54,230
Achievement.

2312
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:57,270
Pizza party.

2313
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,350
New outfit reveal.

2314
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:10,190
Oh, I might actually be able to do that.

2315
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,910
Eat 400,000 hot dogs.

2316
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:19,070
I'll sing a song 400,000 times.

2317
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:28,270
Okay, so here is tricky because it could be two, one, four, or...

2318
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:32,890
Two, one, and then four somewhere.

2319
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:37,570
I'll sing there.

2320
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,610
Count four...

2321
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,590
Four, four, four, K pennies.

2322
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:43,370
Yeah, but that would be four, four, four, four, K, no?

2323
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:43,930
Oh...

2324
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:50,850
I sang...

2325
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:51,530
I've sung...

2326
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:52,610
I've sung...

2327
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:53,270
Uh...

2328
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,230
Ikenai Borderline 50 times.

2329
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:59,710
I feel like I could have the endurance to sing a song 100 times.

2330
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:01,430
Even 101 times.

2331
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:02,710
I think.

2332
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:10,840
Ban 400,000 wisps.

2333
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:11,200
True.

2334
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:32,250
How are we supposed to...

2335
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:32,510
No!

2336
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:37,150
I'm sorry I'm yawning now.

2337
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:42,060
I don't know.

2338
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,280
Because this could be...

2339
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:46,760
Wait.

2340
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:49,640
This could be...

2341
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,160
Wait.

2342
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,220
No, wait, no.

2343
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:52,420
Just wait.

2344
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,080
One, two, three, four, one.

2345
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:56,500
See?

2346
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:57,540
I don't know.

2347
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:00,140
I don't know.

2348
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:07,960
This one's tricking me out.

2349
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,860
I know you guys are trying to help, but...

2350
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:17,160
I...

2351
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,140
I get confused.

2352
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,020
I get confused.

2353
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,980
Yeah, maybe 400K will do outfit reveal.

2354
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,500
I still have some stuff I need to prepare though.

2355
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,120
The weird dimensions throwing you off.

2356
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,220
Yeah, I think so.

2357
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,100
I think so.

2358
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,000
See?

2359
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:39,740
Because...

2360
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,920
This could be four.

2361
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:41,760
Wait.

2362
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:43,640
Can it?

2363
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:44,840
Yeah, it can.

2364
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:44,920
Hmm.

2365
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:46,600
Or it could be two...

2366
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,380
Four, one.

2367
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,900
Conventions have been censored nowadays.

2368
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:01,100
I remember someone talking about their whole booth getting removed just for regular Higurashi merch.

2369
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:11,700
I know some conventions have rules based on how much fan art you can have.

2370
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:16,360
Versus, like, original goods.

2371
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:20,540
Mint, I need to take care of my voice.

2372
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,040
Also, Mint.

2373
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:22,820
I didn't say I was going to sing.

2374
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,960
I just said I could.

2375
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,720
If I wanted to.

2376
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,100
No!

2377
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,560
It's already been 20 minutes with this one.

2378
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,000
Help!

2379
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:36,820
Wait.

2380
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,400
Is there a hint system in this?

2381
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,120
Jump to Matsu Takeo!

2382
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:43,620
Hint!

2383
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,400
I'm not trying to help Mint.

2384
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:51,800
Don't worry.

2385
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,320
No!

2386
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:52,860
Please!

2387
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:58,800
Please!

2388
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,160
Column 7 put an X between the two boxes.

2389
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:06,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2390
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,400
How do you know?

2391
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,000
How do you know?

2392
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,960
What if you did four activities simultaneously for 100 minutes to show your ultimate power?

2393
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,100
Four.

2394
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,140
Ha ha ha ha!

2395
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,500
Easy mode.

2396
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,480
Because it can't be your four.

2397
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:34,280
Oh!

2398
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:35,460
Oh!

2399
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:35,860
Oh!

2400
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:36,760
I see it now!

2401
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,800
I see it!

2402
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,000
I see it!

2403
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,200
I see it!

2404
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:40,640
You're right!

2405
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,960
I see it!

2406
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,000
Yes.

2407
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,220
Yes.

2408
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:52,620
Yes.

2409
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:55,140
Twinkle dogs reunion.

2410
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,270
Let's see.

2411
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:08,820
This has to be... R3.

2412
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,020
Yeah.

2413
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:13,000
Wait.

2414
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:18,340
Wait.

2415
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,560
Now I remember why I didn't... Hold on.

2416
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:24,360
Because it could be 1, 3, 1, 1.

2417
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:24,960
You know?

2418
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,920
It could be connected to the 5.

2419
01:56:38,690 --> 01:56:40,450
What do the blue numbers mean?

2420
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:45,730
The blue numbers mean that there's a part that is solvable on the row.

2421
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,830
So... But I don't know.

2422
01:56:55,110 --> 01:57:00,390
We only have two quote-unquote columns that have things that are able to be placed.

2423
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:02,710
Yeah.

2424
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:04,170
Enough info to solve a square.

2425
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:04,550
Yeah.

2426
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:04,730
Yeah.

2427
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:04,950
Yeah.

2428
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,130
Yeah.

2429
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,190
I'm like, what info?

2430
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:08,950
Huh?

2431
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:11,330
Are we looking at the same thing?

2432
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:16,070
None of this feels solvable right now.

2433
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,560
We have no errors.

2434
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:30,840
Yeah?

2435
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,560
Let me double-check.

2436
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,800
Just wait a minute.

2437
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:34,420
Nope.

2438
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,960
We are all good.

2439
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,860
We keep our brains today.

2440
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,140
Think if it could be 3 or 1, what would be the same?

2441
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:56,570
That this is...

2442
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:57,370
Naruhono.

2443
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:57,850
Next.

2444
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:15,960
What do you mean, though?

2445
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:17,700
Huh?

2446
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,620
What do you mean, why?

2447
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:22,180
Because if it's 3, it's like this.

2448
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,940
And then that would have to be 1.

2449
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,360
Wait.

2450
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:28,680
I'll mix it myself up.

2451
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,120
Or...

2452
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:37,620
Or if it's 1 and this is 3, then it's like that.

2453
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:43,430
Like that.

2454
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:50,640
So either way, that is an X.

2455
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:10,790
Maetake, maetake, gulu, gulu, gulu, gulu.

2456
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:11,930
Oh.

2457
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:13,770
Oh, yeah.

2458
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:19,850
But it can be a 1.

2459
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:22,170
It can't.

2460
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:26,230
It can't be a 1.

2461
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:29,010
Oh, wait.

2462
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:29,770
You're right.

2463
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:31,270
It can be a 1.

2464
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:42,350
I saw it immediately, as soon as you said it.

2465
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:47,410
Oh, golly.

2466
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:50,470
My brain is very slow today.

2467
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,080
Why did I think that?

2468
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:04,440
Why did I think that?

2469
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,540
Curious.

2470
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:11,670
I don't like this one.

2471
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:13,390
It's making me angry.

2472
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:34,750
I don't like this one.

2473
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:37,250
I don't like this.

2474
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:44,110
The one below it is an X, though.

2475
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:45,350
No.

2476
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,390
Because what if it's 3?

2477
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,030
Or I should do the middle clicks.

2478
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,070
What if it's like 3?

2479
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:53,990
I like that.

2480
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:55,690
One, three.

2481
02:00:58,610 --> 02:01:04,710
Wait, I messed up all... I don't like doing the middle clicks.

2482
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:19,570
Oh, wait.

2483
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:21,850
Maybe I just got the position wrong.

2484
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:24,350
This is the X.

2485
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:29,350
Maybe that's what I was visualizing and I did it wrong.

2486
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:33,670
You want to like it when Mint gets angry.

2487
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:36,490
Yeah, okay.

2488
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,290
I was like, wait a second.

2489
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:41,690
I know I was seeing a vision somewhere there.

2490
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:51,470
That didn't open up anything else for... It closed that row, but it didn't open up... Or that column, but it didn't open up anything else.

2491
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:51,770
Hold on.

2492
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:55,910
I'm gonna get... Uh, uh, throat Mint.

2493
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,430
There it is.

2494
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:07,720
Thank you guys for your help.

2495
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:09,660
Let's see.

2496
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,400
Now this one.

2497
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,900
This is the one that's gonna...

2498
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,280
Help a lot.

2499
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:17,160
Hopefully.

2500
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,000
With opening new doors.

2501
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:22,460
So currently, it could be one, two.

2502
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:25,240
One, two, three, four, one.

2503
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:27,820
Like so.

2504
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:29,140
Like so.

2505
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:30,260
Or it could be...

2506
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,380
One, two, three, four somewhere.

2507
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,100
And one up here somewhere.

2508
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,580
And two down here somewhere.

2509
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:43,540
You're like Coke Zero Sugar.

2510
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:44,900
If you know, you know.

2511
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,400
I don't know.

2512
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:05,300
If I know, I know.

2513
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,360
Don't worry about it then.

2514
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:12,360
I never had a Coke before.

2515
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,720
I don't know what it tastes like.

2516
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,640
So what's...

2517
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,680
Is it like a...

2518
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,360
Is it...

2519
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:17,960
Are you saying that I taste...

2520
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:18,620
I...

2521
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:20,620
I have less sweetness than...

2522
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,380
The original...

2523
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:23,960
Zero calorie?

2524
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,540
Worse than normal Coke?

2525
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:33,040
It's gross.

2526
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:33,660
Is it?

2527
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:35,700
Oh yeah.

2528
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:36,820
The aspartame.

2529
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,260
Is that the sugar that they use?

2530
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:41,460
You haven't?

2531
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:41,660
No.

2532
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:42,700
I can't drink soda.

2533
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,260
So I've never had it before.

2534
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,140
Hmm.

2535
02:03:53,170 --> 02:03:53,910
What does it mean?

2536
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:57,450
Let's see here.

2537
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:13,810
There.

2538
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:14,470
There's one.

2539
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:20,990
I think...

2540
02:04:27,350 --> 02:04:28,390
I think...

2541
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:29,730
Oh wait.

2542
02:04:29,950 --> 02:04:30,090
Yeah.

2543
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:31,250
This is an X.

2544
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:32,150
I don't wanna...

2545
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:33,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2546
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,590
Okay.

2547
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:37,270
It shouldn't be so hard.

2548
02:04:38,890 --> 02:04:40,330
It shouldn't be so difficult.

2549
02:04:40,330 --> 02:04:40,590
There we go.

2550
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,910
My goodness gracious.

2551
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:48,430
Like that, right?

2552
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:08,370
There we go.

2553
02:05:21,150 --> 02:05:23,090
It really just takes one thing...

2554
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,450
To kind of set things into motion.

2555
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:27,410
Okay, let's see.

2556
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:28,910
Three...

2557
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:29,810
Space...

2558
02:05:29,810 --> 02:05:30,650
Two...

2559
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:31,170
Space...

2560
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:31,850
One...

2561
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:33,590
Space...

2562
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,480
Like so.

2563
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:53,740
Do be like that.

2564
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,100
Do be.

2565
02:06:00,790 --> 02:06:02,530
Do be.

2566
02:06:02,650 --> 02:06:03,370
Four.

2567
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:04,990
Cool.

2568
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:08,530
Like so.

2569
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:09,750
I love...

2570
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,370
That is nice, they are...

2571
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:11,550
Cool.

2572
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:15,450
Guys also,

2573
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:24,530
I forget...

2574
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:37,230
Tikes...

2575
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:37,870
Three...

2576
02:06:37,870 --> 02:06:37,910
Why, yes...

2577
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:38,110
Too good.

2578
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:41,350
It's a silly, cute name.

2579
02:06:41,630 --> 02:06:42,670
Yeah, it's so fun.

2580
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:47,070
Love saying her name.

2581
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:53,130
Okay, so this is four.

2582
02:06:53,870 --> 02:06:54,350
Space.

2583
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,790
It would be like that.

2584
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:57,790
Yeah, yeah.

2585
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:00,610
Okay.

2586
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:03,670
This one, I don't know if it's two...

2587
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:05,250
or if it's part of... like, two up here...

2588
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,110
and part of the four.

2589
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:15,100
To one...

2590
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:16,000
Oh, whoops.

2591
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:16,420
My bad.

2592
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:16,920
I'm stupid.

2593
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:20,500
Um...

2594
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,520
Two here.

2595
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,840
One space.

2596
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:35,910
One space.

2597
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:45,990
Like that.

2598
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,040
Three.

2599
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:56,420
I see.

2600
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,940
I see.

2601
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:02,030
Good night, Minuto.

2602
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:02,810
Good night.

2603
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,370
Good night, good night.

2604
02:08:06,590 --> 02:08:07,490
Let's see...

2605
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:08,410
Hmm, hmm.

2606
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:11,670
Hmm, hmm.

2607
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:26,010
Hmm...

2608
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:26,510
Wait, okay.

2609
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:27,670
Two...

2610
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:31,950
Two...

2611
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:33,590
This has to be...

2612
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:33,690
Ouch!

2613
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:34,790
I just open my tongue.

2614
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:37,570
Has to be like that, right?

2615
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:39,750
I believe.

2616
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:42,630
I believe.

2617
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:44,010
I believe...

2618
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,480
Still no idea what it's supposed...

2619
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:49,860
It just...

2620
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:50,600
It looks...

2621
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:52,300
It looks like a worm.

2622
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,240
Everything looks like a worm to me.

2623
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:03,260
I can't stop seeing worms everywhere.

2624
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:05,260
It's all worms.

2625
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,900
Do you see the curly tail?

2626
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:08,520
And this is the head?

2627
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:11,680
It looks like a little lima bean or something.

2628
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:19,080
I can't stop seeing worm.

2629
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:20,700
Oh.

2630
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:21,960
Oh.

2631
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:22,840
Oh.

2632
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:23,240
Hmm, hmm.

2633
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:23,780
There we go.

2634
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:33,310
Oh my gosh.

2635
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:36,670
It took so long for us to get here, but finally...

2636
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:40,570
We're making progress, finally.

2637
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:40,710
We're making progress, finally.

2638
02:09:47,410 --> 02:09:48,990
It took us so long.

2639
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:51,450
We'll helm the worm.

2640
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:54,370
I would love Minto if she were a worm.

2641
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:56,470
I don't believe that.

2642
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:01,350
Are you guys worm savers?

2643
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:06,750
If you see a worm on the sidewalk on a hot dry day, do you send him back to the...

2644
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:09,070
To the pits of dirt?

2645
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:09,990
Hmm, hmm.

2646
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:12,950
Yeah, yeah.

2647
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,110
Me too, me too.

2648
02:10:17,450 --> 02:10:19,610
I try to at least...

2649
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,190
Wait, okay.

2650
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:22,250
One, two, one...

2651
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:25,650
Three...

2652
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:27,010
Two, two.

2653
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:28,010
That should be it.

2654
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:39,850
I say back to your dirty ways, dirty worm.

2655
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:42,810
I don't go outside.

2656
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,670
That's so...

2657
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:45,250
That's...

2658
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:46,410
That's fair.

2659
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,950
That's fair, but would you be the type?

2660
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:01,220
Do you think...

2661
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:04,160
If you saw a worm, would you stop and help?

2662
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:10,690
Have no sympathy for black widows, though.

2663
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:11,210
I don't...

2664
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:12,070
That's a complete...

2665
02:11:12,070 --> 02:11:12,930
That's not a...

2666
02:11:12,930 --> 02:11:14,090
That's not a worm.

2667
02:11:15,790 --> 02:11:19,650
I don't think anybody is telling you to have sympathy for black widows.

2668
02:11:21,510 --> 02:11:22,110
Yatta!

2669
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:22,330
Yatta!

2670
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:25,930
Sugooi!

2671
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:29,650
I think that's a little...

2672
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:30,750
That's not even the same.

2673
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:35,170
Ah, let's see...

2674
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:36,530
Two...

2675
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:39,950
One...

2676
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:40,810
Hum, hum.

2677
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:41,790
Hum, hum.

2678
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,710
Yes...

2679
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:04,900
We're almost there!

2680
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:07,800
We almost got it!

2681
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:13,280
Are worms bugs?

2682
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:16,540
They're...

2683
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:17,060
They're...

2684
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:23,970
They're...

2685
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:24,830
They're...

2686
02:12:24,830 --> 02:12:25,210
They're gummy.

2687
02:12:26,450 --> 02:12:28,010
It's a kiwi bird?

2688
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:30,330
Sugooi!

2689
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:31,830
Where do you see this?

2690
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:34,030
With your eyes.

2691
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:37,410
Yatta!

2692
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:37,910
Ah!

2693
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:38,970
Nehihi...

2694
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:44,870
Not...

2695
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:45,570
Uh-oh!

2696
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:48,310
Uh-oh!

2697
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:49,750
Uh-oh!

2698
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:51,290
Uh...

2699
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:56,090
I made a lot of mistakes.

2700
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:56,690
Huh?

2701
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:59,130
Oh!

2702
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:00,590
Yeah, I see.

2703
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:01,090
Okay.

2704
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:05,970
Oh, I...

2705
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:07,590
I don't goofed!

2706
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:10,090
Was that right?

2707
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:10,490
Okay.

2708
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:13,230
More!

2709
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:19,170
This one.

2710
02:13:19,690 --> 02:13:20,070
Okay.

2711
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:20,930
Ah!

2712
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:28,170
No sympathy for...

2713
02:13:29,070 --> 02:13:32,470
Uber eats robots that fell over the street, though.

2714
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:35,950
I don't know, I feel like I see those dogs.

2715
02:13:36,710 --> 02:13:37,590
Hum, hum.

2716
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:39,670
Sugoi!

2717
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:41,650
The dogs that, like, do...

2718
02:13:42,230 --> 02:13:42,810
Ii ne!

2719
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:43,790
That...

2720
02:13:43,790 --> 02:13:47,570
They're not Uber, but you know, like, people will keep pushing them over and stuff.

2721
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:50,790
Sorry, I cheated so much.

2722
02:13:53,630 --> 02:13:55,430
It's because my brain is slow today.

2723
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,130
Yatta!

2724
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:00,630
Yatta!

2725
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:00,830
Oh!

2726
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:09,300
You know, the robot dogs?

2727
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,500
They're pretty cute, though.

2728
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:15,920
I've raised butterflies and found my first eggs of the season!

2729
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:17,060
You see, worms?

2730
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,440
You might be excited to hear this.

2731
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:21,720
I've got monarchs and swallowtails!

2732
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:23,740
That's so sweet!

2733
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,480
Wait, that's actually so sweet!

2734
02:14:34,670 --> 02:14:36,370
I used to grow butterflies.

2735
02:14:41,450 --> 02:14:43,090
Worms or caterpillars?

2736
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:46,390
They're a little different, huh?

2737
02:14:48,710 --> 02:14:49,370
They...

2738
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:50,790
They are a little different.

2739
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:52,370
Just don't worry about it.

2740
02:14:52,670 --> 02:14:53,390
Hum, hum.

2741
02:14:59,390 --> 02:15:00,050
Sugoi!

2742
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:04,850
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2743
02:15:07,370 --> 02:15:08,410
Yes, yes.

2744
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:09,010
Yes, yes.

2745
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:11,470
Yes.

2746
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:12,150
Yatta!

2747
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:14,150
Yes, yes, yes.

2748
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:19,790
My eyes are so heavy right now.

2749
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:21,050
You guys don't even understand.

2750
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:24,530
I don't want to end stream early, but...

2751
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,930
I'm like...

2752
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:29,910
I'm so...

2753
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:31,190
I think it's...

2754
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:35,290
But I don't want to go to sleep because when I wake up, I have to go!

2755
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:36,770
No!

2756
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:37,370
Yatta!

2757
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:37,470
No!

2758
02:15:40,410 --> 02:15:42,170
I don't want to go tomorrow.

2759
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:44,970
You can't make me!

2760
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:46,850
Sugoi!

2761
02:15:49,970 --> 02:15:51,310
I was catching up to you.

2762
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:53,310
I thought I was over the jet lag.

2763
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:56,070
I thought I was over it.

2764
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:57,190
Yes, yes, yes.

2765
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:59,390
It's good.

2766
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:00,470
Yatta!

2767
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,890
Sugoi!

2768
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:05,450
One, one...

2769
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:06,210
I'll hear...

2770
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:09,150
Wait, it's a swan!

2771
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:10,890
It's a...

2772
02:16:10,890 --> 02:16:11,730
It's a bird!

2773
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:11,890
Good!

2774
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:14,210
What is that?

2775
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:17,470
I was right!

2776
02:16:23,230 --> 02:16:24,610
What the hell?

2777
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:30,610
I decided to race against you.

2778
02:16:30,710 --> 02:16:31,190
Just finished.

2779
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:32,290
Yeah, me too.

2780
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,810
No, I think.acăあせりんの作品で、たまごを犬から守るコブハクチョウが大体実寸大サイズで描されています。

2781
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:44,890
That's true, this lag.

2782
02:16:44,890 --> 02:16:45,210
This figures lag.

2783
02:16:45,790 --> 02:16:57,890
You can see the文字 on the floor, and that they're in the foot of the heart of football.

2784
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:17,890
No, I think...

2785
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:35,690
I think someone knows how...um...wait...oh wait, the enemy of the state was a bo...I didn't even notice this was a dog.

2786
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:46,690
I think someone knows that...that geese are evil...even though it's a swan.

2787
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:49,830
But swans...I guess swans are mean too.

2788
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:50,450
Look at that.

2789
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:52,410
There's no way that's a nice swan.

2790
02:17:54,170 --> 02:17:55,430
I like geese though.

2791
02:17:55,590 --> 02:17:56,690
I love geese.

2792
02:17:58,350 --> 02:18:04,090
But...you cannot deny...that they are pretty evil.

2793
02:18:05,850 --> 02:18:07,670
Swans are extremely mean.

2794
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,570
Swan geese by association.

2795
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2796
02:18:22,170 --> 02:18:25,830
So...I think that this person had a...tricky run-in.

2797
02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:29,050
With a swan and said they are the enemy of the state.

2798
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:32,290
That's my artistic...analysis.

2799
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:38,550
That is my...grand artistic analysis.

2800
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:44,750
What I want to do is not do...a 25 by 20...oh maybe 20 by 20.

2801
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:49,720
Maybe that's okay.

2802
02:18:57,430 --> 02:18:59,930
Maybe that'll be okay then, 15 by 15.

2803
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:01,270
Okay, let's try it.

2804
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:06,210
Attempt.

2805
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:09,770
Oh...uh...

2806
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:10,370
Not attempt.

2807
02:19:10,770 --> 02:19:13,330
Let's do a 15 by 15 and I'll call it there.

2808
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,730
Oh, whoops.

2809
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,570
Went the wrong way.

2810
02:19:20,950 --> 02:19:23,250
Where are all the 15 by 15s?

2811
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:26,870
Where are they?

2812
02:19:28,470 --> 02:19:30,110
Oh, Japanese painting.

2813
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:30,970
Okay, we'll try it.

2814
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:37,390
15 by 15 is extremely cozy.

2815
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:39,030
I can do these fast.

2816
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:42,610
Most of the time.

2817
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:47,770
Most of the time, at least.

2818
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:52,770
Yatta!

2819
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:10,410
Wait, did I go too far?

2820
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:12,570
Yes.

2821
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,540
Keys don't even feel the need to run away...

2822
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:31,520
when you walk through a swarm of them.

2823
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:33,300
Should tell you all you need to know.

2824
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:37,300
I once saw a video of a...goose that landed in a tiger pin.

2825
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:37,860
Sugoi!

2826
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,260
Wait, yeah.

2827
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:41,340
And a tiger pin.

2828
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:42,600
And...

2829
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,640
The tiger was like...

2830
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:45,480
Yatta!

2831
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:47,480
That's a little snacky for me.

2832
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:51,180
And the goose literally attacked him and was just like...

2833
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:52,340
Back the hell off.

2834
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:54,200
Back the hell off.

2835
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,100
And then the tiger was like...

2836
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:56,820
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2837
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:57,760
I'm sorry.

2838
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:58,460
I'm sorry.

2839
02:20:59,380 --> 02:20:59,900
Sugoi!

2840
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:05,290
Okay.

2841
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:05,510
Gese.

2842
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:06,150
The geese are crazy.

2843
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:10,410
I'm sorry.

2844
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:11,570
Yatta!

2845
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:31,350
Yatta!

2846
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:34,890
Oh, so this is just so easy.

2847
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:37,830
Maybe we can do another one.

2848
02:21:38,610 --> 02:21:39,490
I don't know.

2849
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:53,290
Wait, what did I get wrong?

2850
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:55,690
Wait, uh, why... there we go.

2851
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,010
There we go.

2852
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:07,030
It's a puppy?

2853
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:12,170
This is where I asked if you've played an untitled goose game.

2854
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:16,970
This is where I asked if you've played an untitled goose game.

2855
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:17,150
Oh, for Anna!

2856
02:22:17,150 --> 02:22:18,310
I'm sorry, Anna.

2857
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:23,010
It's too much fun to describe the appearance of the nature of the nature.

2858
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:25,570
Oh, okay.

2859
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:32,010
In this movie, it's a lovely little girl, which is a beautiful feeling.

2860
02:22:33,190 --> 02:22:34,890
The face is painted on the face.

2861
02:22:55,470 --> 02:22:56,510
So cute!

2862
02:22:57,410 --> 02:23:00,670
Okay, I saw one last, 15 by 15.

2863
02:23:01,150 --> 02:23:04,010
We can get this done out of the way.

2864
02:23:04,130 --> 02:23:04,710
Easy too!

2865
02:23:06,730 --> 02:23:09,070
Sorry, I'm obsessed, Hajime!

2866
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:13,090
I'm obsessed with... game.

2867
02:23:15,230 --> 02:23:16,750
I'm obsessed.

2868
02:23:18,790 --> 02:23:20,130
I'm obsessed.

2869
02:23:20,130 --> 02:23:26,790
I'm obsessed with this.

2870
02:23:37,210 --> 02:23:37,930
That's it!

2871
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,790
Amazing!

2872
02:23:49,730 --> 02:23:58,070
Wait, I'll do the one too... Yes... Just

2873
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:05,890
one more famous last words.

2874
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:22,360
I don't think... as much as I would... I don't think I even have... the strength... I don't have the strength to go...

2875
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:22,940
Go on!

2876
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:48,280
Not the yawning virus... I've got it... I've got this... the tired... The tired... Oh gosh, okay... Okay... I'm okay... A hundred more fifteen by fifteens later... Oh no though... I'm getting real sleepy...

2877
02:24:48,280 --> 02:25:02,400
Come on, come on... Oh... I'm awake... Have

2878
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:11,350
time...

2879
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:29,890
Okay, yes... One... Space two... Space two... Space one... Okay... Yes... Yes... Yes...

2880
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:30,590
Yes, maybe.

2881
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:40,250
Oh, that one was... I should have gotten that one from the beginning.

2882
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:43,090
Whoopsie.

2883
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:46,150
It's fine, I'm sleepy as well.

2884
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:49,390
It's just one of those days, you know?

2885
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:55,090
What's today, Monday?

2886
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:55,870
Yeah.

2887
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:58,750
Lazy Monday.

2888
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,750
Well, not lazy, but you know when you...

2889
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:06,750
Mondays make you feel a certain way.

2890
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:08,950
Thank you, Garfield.

2891
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:26,920
The angry...

2892
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:29,360
The angry of Buzhi is so funny.

2893
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:31,060
Okay.

2894
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:31,760
Hold on.

2895
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,340
Good.

2896
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,680
Morale is dead on Mondays.

2897
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:42,300
Yeah, but you just gotta look forward to next...

2898
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:43,400
To the Friday again.

2899
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:46,320
And that'll get you motivated.

2900
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:49,060
To be like, yeah, Friday will come...

2901
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:50,300
Once again.

2902
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:51,520
Eventually.

2903
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:53,260
Eventually.

2904
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:53,600
Eventually.

2905
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:02,820
The peak collab.

2906
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:04,000
Yeah, that's on Friday.

2907
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:04,820
That's right.

2908
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:06,020
Oh.

2909
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:06,820
I did it!

2910
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:07,780
Don't do that.

2911
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,600
Don't do that.

2912
02:27:25,630 --> 02:27:26,430
That's right.

2913
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:45,190
I just called them Minto Monday.

2914
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:49,150
I guess we'll have to see what...

2915
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:50,850
The doctor says tomorrow, though.

2916
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,430
Oh, whoops.

2917
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:53,770
Because, uh...

2918
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:57,930
That could change my schedule if they're just like...

2919
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:58,290
Missy!

2920
02:27:58,770 --> 02:27:59,790
No talking!

2921
02:28:00,890 --> 02:28:01,490
Forever.

2922
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:04,330
Hopefully, they don't say that.

2923
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:09,120
That's right.

2924
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:11,520
But you know...

2925
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:16,980
Good news, we all hope.

2926
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:17,460
Yeah!

2927
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:19,220
Minto of the sleepless.

2928
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,740
What is your wisdom?

2929
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:29,640
Don't become sleepless!

2930
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:34,240
Don't do it!

2931
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:37,740
Don't...

2932
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:38,920
Don't become sleepless!

2933
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:39,440
Don't become sleepless!

2934
02:28:43,650 --> 02:28:46,450
This one's taken me just a little bit longer...

2935
02:28:46,450 --> 02:28:47,410
Because my brain...

2936
02:28:47,410 --> 02:28:48,670
Well, my brain's been shut down.

2937
02:28:49,430 --> 02:28:51,330
My brain has been shut down.

2938
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:56,610
Wait, two...

2939
02:28:56,610 --> 02:28:57,630
One...

2940
02:28:57,630 --> 02:28:58,230
One...

2941
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:04,510
Very good.

2942
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:06,710
Very good.

2943
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:10,630
One...

2944
02:29:11,410 --> 02:29:12,130
Two...

2945
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:13,610
One...

2946
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:14,710
Two...

2947
02:29:17,470 --> 02:29:17,990
Wait...

2948
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,510
One...

2949
02:29:26,190 --> 02:29:26,710
Huh?

2950
02:29:27,450 --> 02:29:27,970
Wait...

2951
02:29:27,970 --> 02:29:28,270
Okay...

2952
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:28,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2953
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:31,230
Oh, golly.

2954
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:34,430
If they went that far...

2955
02:29:34,430 --> 02:29:35,430
Saying never talk again...

2956
02:29:35,430 --> 02:29:36,790
Probably would want to give a second opinion.

2957
02:29:37,090 --> 02:29:37,350
It's true!

2958
02:29:38,390 --> 02:29:39,790
Well, if you need to stay awake...

2959
02:29:39,790 --> 02:29:41,090
Remember to use code BOOBER...

2960
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:41,870
For that extra energy...

2961
02:29:42,230 --> 02:29:43,030
With giver subs!

2962
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:45,250
What if the doctor prescribes...

2963
02:29:45,250 --> 02:29:46,270
Turkish delight?

2964
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:47,670
Huh...

2965
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:49,130
Second opinion...

2966
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:50,090
Second opinion!

2967
02:29:54,410 --> 02:29:56,470
You can't force me...

2968
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:00,670
To enjoy Turkish delight...

2969
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:03,530
It's not a delight for me...

2970
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,630
Everybody has a different opinion...

2971
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:12,590
I like the way she says that part...

2972
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:22,680
I like the way she says...

2973
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:23,120
I like it!

2974
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,480
I like it!

2975
02:30:25,180 --> 02:30:25,260
That's it!

2976
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:26,220
Mm, mm!

2977
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,320
Almost there?

2978
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:28,200
I like it!

2979
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:29,800
Almost there?

2980
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:32,380
Yuffie!

2981
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:33,580
A

2982
02:30:38,310 --> 02:30:41,430
little pause... Wait!

2983
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:44,270
We just have this with the puppies?鈴木キーツはリンパの画家

2984
02:30:56,550 --> 02:31:02,930
坂井邦逸に指示して絵の研鑽を積みました。師匠が亡くなった後はリンパの伝統を踏襲しつつも 自分ならではの表現を追求したそうです。

2985
02:31:11,230 --> 02:31:14,030
鈴木キーツは染物職人の家に生まれた という話もあって、染物で培った色彩感覚が本作の刺激的ともいえる色使いに

2986
02:31:18,950 --> 02:31:26,510
影響したかもしれませんね。背景の金色と朝顔とのコントラストが 目に焼き付いて思わず引き込まれてしまいます。わー!

2987
02:31:30,490 --> 02:31:42,470
っそいい!いや、 if I have to do some no-talking streams...I might do that.so that I...um...can still stream and rest my voice.ん...

2988
02:31:42,470 --> 02:31:42,470
allegiance

2989
02:31:48,470 --> 02:31:54,270
?なんだけど...えー...and...cause I was making my schedule .Today .I'm not gonna lie, I felt so depressed.

2990
02:31:55,270 --> 02:32:00,110
Because I was just like, I don't want to take this many days off.

2991
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:02,270
I know I have to, but...

2992
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:04,250
I have your med song.

2993
02:32:04,570 --> 02:32:05,570
My med song?

2994
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:12,210
What's my alarm for taking my nighttime medication and you jump scare me nightly?

2995
02:32:12,830 --> 02:32:13,850
What's my med song?

2996
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:17,270
But thanks!

2997
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:21,850
Just a few months.

2998
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:26,550
I think until September, you know, obviously we'll have to see.

2999
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:28,970
Especially after tomorrow.

3000
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:31,150
What the diagnosis is.

3001
02:32:32,030 --> 02:32:34,990
I think resting mostly until September would be good.

3002
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:36,310
But we'll see, we'll see.

3003
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:38,390
Hoping for good news tomorrow.

3004
02:32:38,570 --> 02:32:39,410
Try not to stress too much.

3005
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:40,750
I'm sure it'll be over before you know it.

3006
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:42,010
Thank you!

3007
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,230
ASMR typing strings.

3008
02:32:47,690 --> 02:32:50,610
We're up for whatever type of stream we need while recovering.

3009
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:51,450
Thank you!

3010
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:55,210
I don't think I could do text-to-speech stream.

3011
02:32:56,890 --> 02:32:57,970
I don't think I could.

3012
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:03,910
Yeah, I'll definitely let you guys know how things go.

3013
02:33:04,070 --> 02:33:04,850
Of course, of course.

3014
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:07,270
No talking charade stream.

3015
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:09,790
Oh my gosh, I'm forced to use 3D.

3016
02:33:10,130 --> 02:33:11,690
Because it's the only way I can communicate.

3017
02:33:11,690 --> 02:33:14,070
I know a little bit of ASL.

3018
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:16,530
American Sign Language.

3019
02:33:19,310 --> 02:33:20,350
My WPM?

3020
02:33:20,710 --> 02:33:22,110
It's like 90 something.

3021
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,530
But still, I feel like it's...

3022
02:33:26,530 --> 02:33:27,330
I don't know.

3023
02:33:28,390 --> 02:33:29,710
I talk too much.

3024
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:31,110
I have too much that I want to say.

3025
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:36,730
And...

3026
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:40,250
Typing would not be...

3027
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:42,150
Efficient.

3028
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:47,610
Sending all my energy for tomorrow.

3029
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:49,290
Thank you guys.

3030
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:50,470
Thank you.

3031
02:33:58,920 --> 02:33:59,840
Puppy.

3032
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:03,460
I guess Japan likes morning glories.

3033
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:06,040
Wait, is it the same...

3034
02:34:06,040 --> 02:34:08,120
No, it's not even the same...

3035
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,680
The same person.

3036
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:14,540
Hello guys!

3037
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,740
Thank you.

3038
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:19,380
Uh...

3039
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:21,600
I'll let you guys know how my doctor's appointment goes.

3040
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:23,100
And if you're watching the VOD...

3041
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:24,380
Then you might already know!

3042
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:27,400
Talking using the 15...

3043
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:30,120
By 15 seconds...

3044
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:30,260
Huh?

3045
02:34:39,210 --> 02:34:40,410
Good luck, have a good night.

3046
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:41,050
Thank you!

3047
02:34:41,810 --> 02:34:42,830
It'll be okay tomorrow.

3048
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,610
Thank you!

3049
02:34:49,740 --> 02:34:51,360
Oh gosh, you scared me.

3050
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:53,920
Welcome!

3051
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:54,060
You're welcome!

3052
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:59,420
Guifu-tei-la-renga-gu-an-nai!

3053
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:00,800
Pixel Museum!

3054
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,080
I don't know that tomorrow.

3055
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:03,720
You'll be in and out before you know it.

3056
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:05,360
Hopefully...

3057
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:06,460
Margo, thank you!

3058
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:08,120
Pain, thank you!

3059
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,140
Thank you guys.

3060
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:11,400
Otsumi-ta!

3061
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,100
I'll see you guys...

3062
02:35:13,100 --> 02:35:14,220
When I see you next.

3063
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:15,980
Thank you so much for...

3064
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:16,800
for...

3065
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:17,020
uh...

3066
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:19,020
indulging me in my Nonogram obsession.

3067
02:35:19,940 --> 02:35:20,440
And...

3068
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:20,820
um...

3069
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:21,040
Yeah.

3070
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:22,620
Otsumi-ta, otumi-ta!

3071
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:24,280
Hello, oh my gosh.

3072
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,660
Toziko, your icon is so cute.

3073
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:29,780
Have a good sleep.

3074
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:30,560
You as well.

3075
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:34,700
I'm gonna have a good night.

3076
02:35:34,860 --> 02:35:35,760
I'll see you guys later.

3077
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:36,980
Bye-bye.

3078
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,540
I'll do my best tomorrow.

3079
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:39,580
I'll be brave.

3080
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:41,560
Hi, dog.

3081
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:44,740
Thank you, Joy Princess.

3082
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:46,200
Bye-bye.

3083
02:35:48,980 --> 02:35:49,840
Bye-bye.
