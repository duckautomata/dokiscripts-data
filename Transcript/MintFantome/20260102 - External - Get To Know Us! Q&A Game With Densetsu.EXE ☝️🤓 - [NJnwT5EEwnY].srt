13
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,470
Everyone doesn't know actually what we're doing yet.

14
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,670
We're definitely gonna play games like after the stream,
right?

15
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,150
We're gonna play all the cabinets.

16
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,950
Oh yeah, absolutely.

17
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,210

20
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:40,970
Oh, don't mind us.

21
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,590
We're just gonna take some of these snacks.

22
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,330
I'm rummaging through your kitchen.

23
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,050
Now, guys, talking of stream, we have got things to do
today, haven't we, everyone?

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,690
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

25
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,250
Yeah.

26
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,230
I'd like to move over to the board game.

27
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,390
table in the arcade.

28
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,170
Should we go have a look?

29
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,410
Let's play some board games.

30
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,310
This amazing board was put together by Mint Phantom Games.

31
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,910
Would you like to explain the board mint?

32
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,350
Oh yes indeed.

33
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,130
So we have this wonderful board set in our lovely virtual
Akihabara.

34
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,750
And so...

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,010
What did I make the colors?

36
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,350
I couldn't remember even.

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,350
Oh wait, we have it.

38
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,290
Hold on.

39
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:43,930
Yeah, we're just, we're good to get to know us a little bit
more through all these questions and whoever finishes first.

40
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,270
No, I don't think we came up with something.

41
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,870
Whoever finishes first could make like a batzu for the other
two people.

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,750
Yeah, oh yeah.

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,370
Batzu?

44
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,250
Batzu?

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,110
Really?

46
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:54,970
Batzu?

47
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,270
I don't want to leave batzu up to chat.

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,550
I don't know what they're going to say.

49
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,410
All right.

50
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,250
I'm going to roll guys.

51
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,810
I'ma roll.

52
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,590
Are you ready?

53
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,210
Haki-daki.

54
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,430
Oh, I got a one, guys, so...

55
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:07,750
A one.

56
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,250
Cool.

57
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,390
That's great.

58
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,830
That's really great.

59
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,210
Question from the members.

60
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,930
Okay.

61
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,210
What's your question, guys?

62
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,970
Victoria Roman.

63
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,250
Yes.

64
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,330
Do you remove your socks with your toes or with your hands?

65
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,230
Who removes it with their toes?

66
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,210
Is this a thing?

67
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,350
Wait, you don't remove it with your toes?

68
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,210
No?

69
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,150
I like, I step on the other sock and then I pull my foot
out.

70
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,410
Oh, yeah, that would do that.

71
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,950
That's another one too.

73
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,870
I will admit, I think one time where I, for some reason I
was like, I don't know, I was like type and sewing.

74
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,130
I think I did remove one with my mouth once.

75
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:53,850
One time!

76
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,990
You're judging for toes?

77
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,470
You removed it with your mouth?

78
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,830
It was one time!

79
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,490
Let's do a group one so we can all answer something.

80
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,150
What are your favorite ice cream flavors?

81
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,930
Shall we do it in the tune of the song?

82
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,810

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,260
Could we get a new one?

128
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
I don't even...

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,280
I think I've...

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,540
I feel so empowered on my...

131
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:42,280
own stream to say these things but then when i am when i am
faced with my own with my own actions i get so embarrassed

132
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:53,480
like all of the all of the staff are listening meant they're
all look look any literature is literature anyone we will

133
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:01,620
not judge you for what literature you consume because at
least you read what are your favorite and least favorite

134
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,460

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,280
We're sounding so American.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,100
That's how I don't want them Japanese umeboshi and I want my
steak medium rare.

00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,260
It doesn't have to be a regular or have a five star runtime.

146
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,140
But three good girls.

147
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,040

Do you think Phoebe and Vicky amplify your freakiness?

175
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,940
Or do you try to keep it low key around them?

176
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,660
Well...

No!

179
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,360
No, don't be embarrassed about the things you love.

180
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,840
I don't love them.

181
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
Well, it's like a love game.

182
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,400
Huh?

183
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,500
What?

184
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,360
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

185
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,800
I don't know.

186
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,120
I think, you know, eventually we'll all just be super freaks
altogether.

187
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,100
Anyways.

188
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Oh gosh.

189
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,560
What could it be?

190
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,280
Phoebe!

191
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,620
Phoebe!

192
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,480
Two.

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,500
Two for Phoebe.

194
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,580
Okay, it's something.

195
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,380
It's something.

196
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,940
What do you like more?

197
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,600
A manicure or a pedicure?

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,260
Oh.

199
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
Three, two, one.

200
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:50,800
Pedicure!

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,520
Manicure!

202
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,440
Uncertain.

203
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,100
Oh.

204
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,800
Why, why, why manicure, Minto?

205
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,340
Um, I, I crave the touch of someone holding my hair.

206
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,620
Aw.

207
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,540
Lude hand holding.

208
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,480
This is so unbranded for you.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,160
And final roll.

210
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,660
Will Phoebe get, like, 25?

211
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,560
25.

212
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,220
Roll all three and then add them together.

213
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,420
Really?

214
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,020
Really?

215
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,540
Yeah, but some extra drama.

216
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,280
Okay, here we go.

217
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,060
What?

218
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,590
Done or high?

219
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,270
You guys want the same spot.

220
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,170
Oh, that's so...

221
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,970
I don't feel like crying for real right now.

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,820
It was fake.

223
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,360
And with that, we have the winner announcement.

224
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,040
Your Batsu game, guys.

225
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,560
Next time, you were both on holiday in Japan.

226
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,300
I have some very nice omiyage that I bought recently at the
wasabi farm.

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,920
It's a wasabi long-dashab biscuits.

228
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,900
I thought, oh, they might be nice.

229
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:29,360
chocolate combined together they taste like some kind of
funky wait white chocolate they're like no no no no you

230
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,720
don't understand they're like they're really really bad guys
so you're gonna have to eat one of those each
