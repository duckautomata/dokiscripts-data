1
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,410
Oh, hold on.

2
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,690
I think the audio is all weird.

3
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,610
Give me a second.

4
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,780
Let me try this.

5
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,800
Wait.

6
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,740
No.

7
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,940
Maybe I'm wrong.

8
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,880
Hello?

9
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
Can you hear me?

10
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,780
Hello?

11
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,080
Hold on.

12
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,900
Give me a second.

13
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
Can you hear it twice?

14
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,710
Is it okay?

15
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,190
Give us a sign.

16
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,710
Only once?

17
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,990
Okay.

18
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,830
Every little thing has a different sound.

19
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,310
Start game has a sound.

20
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,170
Load game has a sound.

21
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,950
Options has a sound.

22
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,340
Yeah!

23
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,360
Scourge, it's your birthday!

24
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,940
I got some pizza.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,100
Can you cast a spell on it to make it taste super delicious?

26
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
Of course!

27
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Happy birthday!

28
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,020
Happy birthday, Scourge!

29
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Three months already?

30
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,080
What?

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,720
Three months?

32
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,300
Holy cow.

33
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,360
Also, let me know if it's too loud.

34
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,980
Wait, is it?

35
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,020
I can't tell which one you're hearing.

36
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,060
So I'm gonna put it here.

37
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,060
I can't tell.

38
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,780
It's a bit loud.

39
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay if it can be lower.

40
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Is it loud or not?

41
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,040
Is it okay now?

42
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,500
Three months, gang!

43
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,360
So we are.

44
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,920
Yippee!

45
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,480
Yippee!

46
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Three months!

47
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,160
Oh my goodness.

48
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,640
Okay.

49
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,220
Okay.

50
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,240
Okay.

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,460
Welcome back, Master!

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,100
Lady!

53
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,220
Welcome to...

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,340
Eternal Darkness.

55
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,400
Sanity's Requiem.

56
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,920
Spooky game for spooky ghosts.

57
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,340
This is a game I have always wanted to play.

58
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,900
I feel like I've always seen it like, you know, back in the day.

59
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,780
I always used to see it at the store.

60
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,820
Like, the game store.

61
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,300
And be like, oh my god.

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,180
Did someone recommend this?

63
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
Because you like Metal Gear Solid?

64
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,420
It's the same company that did Twin Snakes, right?

65
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,100
But yeah, I would always see it at the store.

66
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,020
And I've always been a fan of horror.

67
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,260
So I was like, I'm gonna play it.

68
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,380
But I never had a GameCube until Metal Gear.

69
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,780
Yeah, Silicon Knights!

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,500
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

72
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,660
Thank you for all the memberships, you guys!

74
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,560
Thank you!

75
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,420
Thanks for three months!

76
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,020
Actually, tomorrow will be a membership stream.

77
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,900
So...

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,000
Yippee!

79
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,960
It all comes back to Metal Gear.

80
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,020
Pretty much.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,060
So I know, like, nothing about this game.

82
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,760
I know a little bit about, like...

83
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,820
There's a sanity meter.

84
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,980
And that's all I know.

85
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,680
Oh, and I also know...

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,760
Apparently you need to play the game three times.

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,200
Which, I don't know what's up with that.

88
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,840
We'll see...

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
What's going on.

90
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,860
Before we get to that point.

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,020
Love this game.

92
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,820
It's great to watch you play.

93
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,260
I can't wait to lose my sanity.

94
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,300
Yes!

95
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,600
My second favorite GameCube game behind Fire Emblem.

96
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:01,940
Wow!

97
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,280
Yeah, I really just wanted to...

98
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,420
I really just wanted to play something that I hadn't seen people really playing.

99
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,400
So I was just like, well, this has been on my list.

100
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,620
No better time than...

101
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,460
The present!

102
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,800
If I don't play it now, I'll just keep putting it off.

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,160
You know?

104
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,900
So...

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
Wait, you have sanity?

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
No, I have no sanity left.

107
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,040
Supra!

108
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,120
Supra!

109
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,540
Let me know!

110
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,480
Thanks for the 10 gift!

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,200
And thank you!

112
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,180
Check off MGS.

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,600
Bench it on your bingo card.

114
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,240
Shut up!

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,060
TV table trade!

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,860
Thank you for the 10 gift!

117
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,540
And thank you!

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,860
Yeah, I have no sanity.

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
I hope you guys don't either.

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,340
We're all in this together.

121
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,640
Right?

122
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,980
Start the game!

123
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,820
Oh, shoot.

124
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,960
Wait.

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,140
That device?

126
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
What do?

127
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,700
Oh, wait.

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,080
Uh-oh.

129
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,880
But I need that.

130
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,460
But I need that it...

131
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,420
Um...

132
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,700
Just play in one sitting!

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,560
Obviously.

134
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,260
Uh...

135
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,560
Well, I'm looking at my...

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,200
Okay.

137
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,020
Um...

138
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,920
Speed run, baby.

139
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,640
We're just gonna go without saving.

140
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,980
Santo Pichi!

141
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,660
Santo Pichi!

142
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,480
Wait.

143
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:37,840
You know what?

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,180
Okay.

145
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,920
I will figure this out later.

146
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,020
Yeah.

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,360
I will...

148
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,780
I will...

149
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,020
I will figure this out later.

150
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
No way.

151
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,640
Okay.

152
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,450
Okay.

153
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:51,630
Flesh?

154
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,110
Hordy Hoar?

155
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,130
Flesh?

156
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:53,810
Bone.

157
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,110
Bound together with the oddest magical incantation.

158
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,470
This wretched book is where it all began so long ago.

159
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,310
Before time.

160
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,110
Before humanity.

161
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,530
I am Dr. Edward Royvus.

162
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,750
I am a clinical psychologist.

163
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,230
Oh.

164
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,030
I am also dead.

165
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,090
What!?

166
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,790
This is not my story.

167
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,170
Okay.

168
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,150
Nor even the story of the Royvus family.

169
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,890
Then why are you here?

170
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,010
It is the story of humanity.

171
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,610
Nintendo.

172
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,710
Believe it or not, as you will.

173
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,350
Your perceptions will not change reality.

174
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,590
But simply color it.

175
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,410
Humanity has been on the edge of extinction for two millennia.

176
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:36,670
What?

177
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,750
For that long?

178
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,750
And dependent on so few.

179
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,150
The guardians grow restless.

180
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,830
I have another thing why I've decided to play this.

181
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,290
Once again, near.

182
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,030
Again.

183
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,710
That's on the flesh!

184
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,970
Whether by fate or misfortune.

185
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,690
My family has crossed their path.

186
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,810
And they didn't take kindly to it.

187
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,690
Their attention turns to my granddaughter.

188
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,990
For she is the last of my line.

189
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,030
And the last hope for humanity.

190
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh yeah!

191
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,790
She looks like...

192
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,070
She looks like Tomb Raider.

193
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,590
She's better now.

194
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,390
Oh my god.

195
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,730
She's got a gun?

196
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,130
Oh, there's a skeleton?

197
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,050
There's a skele- Man, all in my room!

198
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,470
Ah!

199
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,630
Oh my god.

200
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:25,890
Please!

201
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,750
Shoot the gun!

202
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,270
Shoot the gun!

203
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,010
Shoot the gun!

204
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,510
Oh my god.

205
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,070
Oh my god.

206
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:31,950
Ouch!

207
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,110
Is this what happens when your sanity is low?

208
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,850
Shoot the gun!

209
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,230
Oh!

210
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:39,830
Nice!

211
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,410
Nice!

212
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,650
Nice!

213
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,470
Oh my god.

214
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,370
They're immortal.

215
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,230
Because they're skeleton.

216
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,630
May the rats eat your eyes!

217
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,890
May the rats eat your eyes!

218
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,550
Who is...

219
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,210
What is happening?

220
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,230
Grandpa!

221
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,370
Oh, it's all just a dream.

222
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,630
Oh, 3.33 a.m.

223
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,030
Let's go.

224
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,190
The witching hour.

225
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:14,910
Hello?

226
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,230
Hello?

227
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,190
Hello?

228
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,330
Miss Alexandre Roivas?

229
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,590
Um, yeah?

230
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,230
Who's this?

231
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,370
This is Inspector Legrasse of the Rhode Island police.

232
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,990
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's been an accident.

233
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:29,950
What?

234
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,430
It was Grandpa!

235
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,910
I'll be on the next flight out.

236
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,270
Oh, okay.

237
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,370
The Roivas Family Estates, Rhode Island.

238
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,790
Oh my god.

239
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,270
Gumshoe.

240
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:43,610
Gumshoe.

241
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,110
Gumshoe.

242
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,130
Gumshoe.

243
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,250
Gumshoe.

244
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,510
Gumshoe.

245
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,760
Ah, Miss Roivas.

246
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm pleased to meet you.

247
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,920
Her eyes.

248
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,840
I mean...

249
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh my god.

250
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,560
Yes, I suppose so, considering.

251
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,480
Her eyes.

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,460
My condolences.

253
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,040
This is most unpleasant.

254
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,680
It's a shame we couldn't meet under brighter circumstances.

255
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
Yes, it is.

256
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,260
Can we get this over with, please?

257
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:05,960
Of course.

258
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,460
Yeah, straight to the point.

259
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,980
But I must warn you.

260
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,980
It's not a pleasant sight.

261
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Okay.

262
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm ready.

263
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm prepared.

264
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm prepared for anything.

265
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,220
I'm afraid there's not much to say.

266
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,900
What do you mean?

267
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,420
Is he dust?

268
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,040
What happened?

269
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,360
Is he like atomized?

270
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,960
What happened to his body?

271
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Oh.

272
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,260
What do you mean there's not much to see?

273
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,500
What do you mean?

274
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,280
Miss Roivas.

275
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,800
Is that your grandfather, Edward?

276
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,720
Oh my god.

277
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,280
Yes, it's him.

278
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,920
He just slipped into jelly.

279
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,760
He's wearing a family ring.

280
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,540
Oh.

281
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,460
Not much to see.

282
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,280
That was like the whole body, man.

283
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,220
I don't know.

284
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,460
I don't understand.

285
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,780
Why are you showing me this?

286
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,000
Did he just smirk?

287
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,080
Can't you check dental records or something?

288
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,280
What is wrong with you?

289
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,220
I'm...

290
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,260
You're the one...

291
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,880
You're the one...

293
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,020
It's my job, lady.

294
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,420
You're the only living relative.

295
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,560
And no, we can't check dental records.

296
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
You were the one who said...

297
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,840
There's no head.

298
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,700
There's no head!

299
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,500
There's no sign of intrusion.

300
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
And there was certainly a lot of force used here.

301
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,600
I have never seen anything like this in my 20 years on the force.

302
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,200
We have no head.

303
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,460
There's no evidence except for the body.

304
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,940
And what's left doesn't say much.

305
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,920
We don't have a single clue.

306
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,020
Well, you better find out who did this.

307
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,480
Yeah.

308
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,020
I'm not leaving Rhode Island until you do.

309
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,120
There must be some clue in this old mansion revealing what happened.

310
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,020
I want answers.

311
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,500
So do I.

312
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,480
How could she tell if there's no head?

313
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:37,880
I wish I had some.

314
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,260
He wore the...

315
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,540
He had the ring on, apparently.

316
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,680
Two weeks later!

317
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,620
Oh!

318
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,280
Sh...

319
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,680
Oh!

320
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:58,360
Shocked by her grandfather's mysterious death and frustrated at the incompetence of the local police, Alex vows to uncover the truth.

321
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,640
She decides to search the mansion, the place where Edward conducted his research.

322
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,080
If there was a tie to his past and possibly a tie to his murderer, it would be here.

323
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,210
What was I going to say?

324
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,490
Oh!

325
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:29,970
Another reason I decided to play this was because, like, the day I was trying to decide what to play, um, Nintendo put out, like, a, oh, a video.

326
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:39,130
Did you guys see, like, the Emeo thing, which is a, it was, like, hinting at, at, like, a horror game that looks like they're working on?

327
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:45,550
And I was like, I was like, you know, I think, I think Nintendo, like, has...

328
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,310
I'm talking here!

329
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,430
Excuse me!

330
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:59,050
Um, I think they have, like, the copyright to the sanity system in this, so I was like, what if they kind of, like, incorporate it, but now I think it's Bloober Team and I'm really disappointed.

331
00:14:59,410 --> 00:14:59,990
Oh my god.

332
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,490
What is going on?

333
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,610
I don't have a flashlight.

334
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,410
Okay, this is combat.

335
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,390
I'm combat ready.

336
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,150
I have the, I have the slowest punch in the West.

337
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:13,910
What's this one?

338
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,470
Nothing?

339
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,250
Okay.

340
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,510
Um, how do I?

341
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,290
Oh, I can do this.

342
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,110
I can just punch normal.

343
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:19,510
Okay.

344
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,530
This is block then.

345
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:20,970
All right.

346
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,850
Nice clock.

347
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,110
I'm examining it.

348
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,410
Okay.

349
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,690
Is that Grandpa?

350
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,370
Grandpa!

351
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,530
Oh!

352
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,390
Portraits of the ancestral rooivus line, the foyer wall...

353
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,550
Line the foyer walls.

354
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,290
Wait.

355
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,850
So it's not...

356
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,270
It's not the rooivus line.

357
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,190
It's the...

358
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,650
The...

359
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,270
The...

360
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,270
Portraits of the incest...

361
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,470
Ancestral...

362
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,270
Sorry.

363
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,110
I have to really emphasize the...

364
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,110
Ancestral rooivus line the foyer walls.

365
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,950
Their faces reveal a dark brooding edge.

366
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,130
There is something about each one that gives the viewer an unsettling feeling.

367
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,950
I feel very unsettled right now.

368
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,350
Wait.

369
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,690
Can I check the clock again then?

370
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,050
Oh, here we go.

371
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,870
A beautiful carriage clock.

372
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,530
The hands appear to be...

373
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:17,990
The hands appear to be...

374
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,990
Nintendo sits on cool horror games like Fatal Frame.

375
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,770
Fatal Frame!

376
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,650
But, you know.

377
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,330
We still have these classics at least.

378
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,950
Just a membership.

379
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,970
The hands appear to be stuck, yet the clock continues to tick, with the time permanently set to 333.

380
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,470
There is a key in the back of the clock, presumably for winding it.

381
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:43,850
Oh!

382
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,790
Should Alex...

383
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,430
Look at the key.

384
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:45,950
Yes!

385
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,010
Oh!

386
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,270
Alex picks up the desk.

387
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,030
He picks up the desk clock and pulls the key from it.

388
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,590
However, there is something odd about the key.

389
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,990
It isn't for winding it at all.

390
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,430
It looks like a dresser key!

391
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,330
Ghosts are so rude.

392
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,850
Stop the voices.

393
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,350
I wish I could run.

394
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,250
Oh, here is another rooivus line.

395
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,130
I hear birds.

396
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,410
Ew.

397
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,180
Okay.

398
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,360
Bum bum.

399
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,260
Bum bum.

400
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,220
Examine.

401
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,540
Oh.

402
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm...

403
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,260
I'm trapped.

404
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,700
The last weak rays of sunlight fight the shroud of darkness.

405
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,640
It lends an eerie feel to the last few weeks' events.

406
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,820
As the sun sets, Alex will be alone in this house, with nothing but the spirits of old for company.

407
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,480
This is the original Luigi's Mansion.

408
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,600
Wait!

409
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,000
Where?

410
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,560
They didn't solve anything though!

411
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,360
The call of the mansion beckons to Alex, drawing her back to uncover the fact that family secrets it hides.

412
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,400
Alex will not leave till she has learned what happened to her grandfather.

413
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,680
I did not expect like a visual novel going on here.

414
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,400
It's beautiful though.

415
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,600
Okay.

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,740
What's this way?

417
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,340
Open door.

418
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,560
Oh my god.

419
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,180
God.

420
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,840
Scary.

421
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,740
What is this?

422
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,120
Grandpa?

423
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,780
A wooden plaque is fastened to the door, taking the place of the lock.

424
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,000
A colored sigil is carved into the wood above a wide slot.

425
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,560
The slot is just wide enough to insert a narrow blade?

426
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,180
What is going on in this place?

427
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,860
Whoa.

428
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,140
They even have like the lens flare.

429
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,200
Is this the kitchen?

430
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,660
What?

431
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,220
Grandpa, can I get a snack?

432
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,200
No?

433
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Okay.

434
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
Nothing around here.

435
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,840
Okay.

436
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,360
Interesting.

437
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,620
Hold left trigger?

438
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,940
Oh!

439
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,600
Thank you.

440
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,080
Thank you so much.

441
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,040
Grandpa.

442
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,100
Oh.

443
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,280
Grandpa, can you play?

444
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,580
A grand piano stands here, awaiting the hands of a decent musician.

445
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,420
Unfortunately, Edward never really lived up to that description.

446
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,060
And as such, the piano fell into disuse.

447
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,140
Skye!

448
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,240
Thanks for the tech gift.

449
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Thank you.

450
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,320
Come on.

451
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,220
Oh, what's this?

452
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,940
Nothing?

453
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,600
Nothing?

454
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,700
Oh, she's got them Barbie heels.

455
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,260
They sound so good.

456
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,480
What is this?

457
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,820
Fascinating.

458
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,820
What is that up there, though?

459
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,520
Yeah, these.

460
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,680
The illustration features a collection of strange line designs related to each other in a cyclical manner.

461
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,080
There appears to be some significance to it, but it isn't particularly evident.

462
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:48,960
Okay.

463
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,540
Meow.

464
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,460
Meow.

465
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,820
Which was over here.

466
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,940
I didn't go through this door.

467
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,080
Where did Grandpa die at?

468
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,500
In here?

469
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,900
This looks like where he died.

470
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,400
Oh, my God.

471
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,820
I'm scared.

472
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,040
Don't do that to me, game!

473
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Oh.

474
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,100
What?

475
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,580
Nothing here?

476
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:13,880
Okay.

477
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,080
Grandpa?

478
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Grandpa?

479
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,040
Grandpa?

480
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,380
Oh, my God.

481
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,090
Another person.

482
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,150
Another clock.

483
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,310
Oh, my God.

484
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,170
Hickory dickory dock.

485
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,090
This looming grandfather clock seems to stand ominously...

486
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,410
Katsu!

487
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,270
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

488
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,710
Thank you!

489
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,990
...Ominously in the corner, gazing on this empty room with an almost patriarchal air.

490
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:41,970
Huh?

491
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,310
Use the left and right to adjust the clock hands.

492
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,290
Arigato.

493
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:47,730
Arigato.

494
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,330
Chuu!

495
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,170
I'm not going to adjust them right now.

496
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,850
Thank you!

497
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,330
I've been waiting for a Vtuber to play Eternal Darkness.

498
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,650
Thanks.

499
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:54,870
Thanks.

500
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,170
Irish...

501
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,490
wristwatch.

502
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,430
Okay.

503
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,330
So far, only a little scary.

504
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,090
Where did...

505
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,850
Why does Grandpa have such a huge house?

506
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,430
Wait.

507
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,510
Which way did we come through?

508
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,170
What's in here?

509
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,530
Oh.

510
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,930
Then what was the other one?

511
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,370
Here.

512
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:20,610
Here.

513
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:20,750
Here.

514
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,710
What?

515
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,350
Oh.

516
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,090
Oh.

517
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,750
What is this?

518
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,350
A brass-framed mirror is set onto the wall.

519
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,830
The mirror's direction can be adjusted by the means of two crankshafts set below it.

520
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,410
Banger after banger after banger games.

521
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,290
Thanks, Zachary!

522
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,810
A curious device.

523
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,970
Is it related to the telescope in some way?

524
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,930
Should I...

525
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,690
No, it's not adjusted just yet.

526
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,610
Why is there a globe in the ground?

527
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,230
A globe cradled in a wooden frame.

528
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,050
There's so much...

529
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,950
There's so much stuff!

530
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,290
Yeah, this house has some fun stuff in it.

531
00:21:59,370 --> 00:21:59,690
I know, right?

532
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,410
Its glossy surface is...

533
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,670
This is probably how Grandpa died.

534
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,170
He tripped over this globe in the ground.

535
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,230
Its glossy surface is painted in the likeness of an ancient map.

536
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:17,450
A lens is situated in the northern hemisphere above a label that reads, There be dragons here.

537
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,330
Dragons!

538
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,880
I feel like a dragon.

539
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,340
A dragon would be a pain in my side.

540
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,320
Okay, this is the same thing.

541
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,940
That adjusts...

542
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,900
Wait, so there's two of them.

543
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Okay.

544
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,580
How do I look through it?

545
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,160
I don't think it would let me, but...

546
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,520
Oh, wait.

547
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,240
Maybe...

548
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,100
Here?

549
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,040
What is that?

550
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,740
Oh!

551
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,320
Okay.

552
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,040
Cool.

553
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,680
So there's three of...

554
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,140
Wait, huh?

555
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,440
I guess we're gonna see...

556
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,100
We're gonna start cranking it.

557
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,820
Never mind.

558
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,920
We'll come back.

559
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,600
Crank that soldier boy.

560
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,200
Superman now...

561
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,300
Whoa!

562
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,120
Watch me, you!

563
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,760
Watch me, you!

564
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,940
Oh, it's locked.

565
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,720
We have a...

566
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,740
We have a dresser key.

567
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,660
Oh my god!

568
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,080
Sorry.

569
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,260
The voices sometimes I just don't expect them.

570
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,000
They spook me really bad.

571
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,720
Lady.

572
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,160
Santa Claus.

573
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,020
I don't know if Santa was in our lineage?

574
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,900
Oh, do I have a...

575
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,260
It's locked.

576
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,680
I think I have a...

577
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,540
What's the word?

578
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,860
A...

579
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,580
What's the word?

580
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,840
I don't hear any voices.

581
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,100
Wait.

582
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,520
You guys have a weird smell, huh?

583
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,200
You guys don't hear the voices?

584
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,460
You guys are hearing the music though, right?

585
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,230
Right?

586
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,320
You don't hear the whispers?

587
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,580
The...

588
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,080
They only happen sometimes.

589
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,520
I guess we will start cranking it.

590
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,540
Anything you say, boss.

591
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,120
What does that mean?

592
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,640
What did I say weird?

593
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,880
Take your meds.

594
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,140
You haven't heard the...

595
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,800
All I hear is boom boom.

596
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,640
They happen sometimes.

597
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,460
I'll tell you.

598
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,560
I'll tell you when it happens.

599
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,060
But yeah, we need to find the dresser.

600
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,220
I think.

601
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
I guess.

602
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,580
I also don't know how to use my inventory.

603
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,620
I hear the whispers.

604
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,340
You do?

605
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,560
We also need a sword.

606
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,200
There!

607
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,420
There!

608
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,600
There!

609
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,400
You heard that?

610
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,840
You heard it?

611
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,440
Care to demonstrate?

612
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,140
Just like that.

613
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,520
Okay, you guys are...

614
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,960
You guys are just gaslighting me.

615
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,140
You guys scare me.

616
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,860
Like that!

617
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,340
Like that!

618
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,740
Right there!

619
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,100
Right there!

620
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,060
Dresser key.

621
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,820
We need to find the dresser.

622
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,250
It's a euphemism for self-love.

623
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,230
Oh.

624
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,250
Of course.

625
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,730
It's not a day until I say something...

626
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,070
That I don't know what it means.

627
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,710
Okay, let's go back to the...

628
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,290
Alright, so there was the grandfather clock.

629
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,250
Down this way.

630
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,510
I don't think you know what gaslighting is.

631
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,810
What?

632
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,490
What are you talking about?

633
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,430
I basically invented the...

634
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,370
I coined the phrase.

635
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,650
Am I supposed to be seeing something here?

636
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,630
Hmm.

637
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,990
Over here?

638
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,050
Anything?

639
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,650
What I was trying to say earlier is I think I have a stamina meter.

640
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,590
Because she was like...

641
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,730
She was like heavy breathing after I was running a lot.

642
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,490
So here.

643
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,250
Oh.

644
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,490
Yes.

645
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,430
What if we move it to 3?

646
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,250
33.

647
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:57,970
Okay.

648
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,350
Okay.

649
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,650
1.

650
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,290
2.

651
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:01,330
1.

652
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,750
2.

653
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,150
Oh, my God.

654
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,320
I'm gonna do something else.

655
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,380
Oh, my God.

656
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,260
Okay.

657
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,300
2.

658
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,840
1.

659
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,620
1.

660
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,020
1.

661
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,580
Candles...

662
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,840
There's a spooky ghost in the bottom left corner!

663
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,000
In the left corner?

664
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,060
I don't think there should be a ghost in the left corner.

665
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
We got the dagger.

666
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,780
An ancient Roman weapon, a gladius, is on display above the fireplace mantle.

667
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,340
Another token of eclectic junk.

668
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,480
Pick it up.

669
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,850
Cool.

670
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,010
Cool.

671
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,750
Skin?

672
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,830
A diabolic drawing of a stack of human bodies.

673
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,670
Oh my gosh, I was close!

674
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,730
Each one cemented into place.

675
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,470
What twisted psyche could have executed this drawing?

676
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,970
Though disturbing, it is meticulously rendered down to the subtlest detail.

677
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:36,510
The precise anatomy of fractured bones and the convolutions of spines and ribs entwined into a mesmerizing sight.

678
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,390
English is my second language.

679
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,750
I first speak ghost.

680
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,310
A painting of a jungle-shrouded building.

681
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,390
It seems to be a temple in Asia, perhaps from Thailand or Cambodia.

682
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,570
This is a bizarre drawing of a cyclopean city.

683
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,790
Say something in ghost.

684
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,650
I don't know.

685
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,350
I don't know.

686
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,030
I don't know.

687
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,550
I don't know.

688
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:04,590
I don't know.

689
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,170
I don't know.

690
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,350
They're insulting me, but you guys wouldn't understand, you know?

691
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,220
If you guys ever get a spirit box, ask, what are you eating?

692
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,300
And I'll be like, hungry for spaghetti.

693
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,420
Its immense architecture bathed in an unnatural fog.

694
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,620
The detail is incredible.

695
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,080
As Alex studies it, she can almost imagine the city's inhabitants.

696
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,180
Okay.

697
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,400
I think we have more things to worry about, Alex.

698
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,740
I think we've got more things to worry about.

699
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,360
Oh.

700
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,280
This looks like some kind of mask.

701
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,720
The face is serene and compo- That's what you call serene?

702
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,160
We don't speak zoinks.

703
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:03,320
The serene and composure with a faint hint of a smile tugging at the corners of the mouth and eyes closed in deep meditation.

704
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,660
The- This is serene?

705
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,280
I don't know.

706
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,300
Maybe I've never felt peace.

707
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,240
This gothic cathedral is silhouetted against a stark light.

708
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,140
The image is vicious and devoid of subtlety.

709
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:30,600
Every brush stroke echoes the spikes of the architecture, imbuing a violent feeling as though the building itself is a harsh imposition on reality.

710
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,380
A grim picture indeed.

711
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,820
It's a house!

712
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,660
Yo, it ain't that deep.

713
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,960
It ain't just a house.

714
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,560
Can't really see the cathedral.

715
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,000
Me neither.

716
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,740
It was so dark.

717
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,040
Serene bro looks like he's pogging.

718
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,700
I know, right?

719
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,680
What's this?

720
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,780
An aged page set inside a glass frame hangs on the wall.

721
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,920
An insane scribbling covers the page.

722
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Incomprehensible to Alex.

723
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,280
Perhaps if Alex had some kind of tome, it could be deciphered.

724
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,660
Is that what this is for?

725
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,600
A large leather-bound antique book rests upon the cluttered desk.

726
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,280
We shall read it.

727
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
Done, done.

728
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,680
Oh, now it's bright in here?

729
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,360
What?

730
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,570
The dune?

731
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,050
The popcorn?

732
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,620
I had no knowledge of what was to come.

733
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,640
The popcorn bucket?

734
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,460
Nor did I care.

735
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,780
How the knowledge changed me, it will also change you.

736
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,940
As you read this, you will come to learn.

737
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,220
Learn fear, as I have.

738
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,920
Oh.

739
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,840
You, too, will come to understand.

740
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,200
Or you will perish.

741
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:49,780
Ooh.

742
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,960
Grandpa, maybe you should have locked this up.

743
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,320
To think that once I could not see beyond the veil of our reality.

744
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,360
A chosen one.

745
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,080
To see those who dwell behind.

746
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,620
My life now has purpose.

747
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,640
For I have learned the frailty of flesh and bone.

748
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,340
Flesh and bone!

749
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,860
Flesh and bone!

750
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,200
Come on!

751
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,560
Yo!

752
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,520
Why are we in Rome?

753
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,220
What's happening?

754
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,880
What?

755
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:35,940
Augustus.

756
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,220
Wait, what just happened?

757
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,740
Our enemies did not have a chance.

758
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,800
Why did they switch?

759
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,160
Do you believe that it really exists, Centurion?

760
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,640
I do not doubt our Emperor's beliefs.

761
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,360
Or his orders.

762
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,700
But if we are to retrieve the artifact, then we must be strong.

763
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,320
Latin budget right now.

764
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,800
I suddenly know Latin.

765
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,800
Yeah, we all have become wiser today.

766
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,020
Come.

767
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,630
Pius Augustus.

768
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,630
Wait!

769
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,250
He folded so quickly.

770
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:16,850
No!

771
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,810
Augustus!

772
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:18,830
No!

773
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,130
Don't listen to the voices!

774
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,750
Wait, why is he walking like that?

775
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,990
My guy is struggling.

776
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,220
Pius Augustus.

777
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,140
Oh my gosh!

778
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,620
Sake!

779
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,520
Thank you, Brother Silver-chan!

780
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,260
Thank you so much!

781
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,260
Come to us, Pius Augustus!

782
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,160
Paisagastas...

783
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,140
Such a fun name to say.

784
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,000
What is going on?

785
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,720
Oh my god, Stonehenge!

786
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,400
What is happening?

787
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,330
Oh my god, he went to the nether.

788
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,530
I'm Paisagastas!

789
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,270
Oh no!

790
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,690
Oh my god.

791
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,490
The dice on the floor is finally crafted.

792
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,970
Inlaid with golden gems that Pais can't identify.

793
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,970
A strong linear design is situated in the middle and is equally unknown to the Roman soldier.

794
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,950
Okay.

795
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,010
I'm Paisagastas.

796
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,070
What is that super chat?

797
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,690
One of my favorite games on the GameCube.

798
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,110
Oh, I got the thing.

799
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,830
Spooky game!

800
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,050
Thank you!

801
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,350
Thanks for the super chat!

802
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,250
Okay, I don't think there's anything here.

803
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,030
Nothing here.

804
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,050
We just have to scoop spooky skulls?

805
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,610
Look at all the skulls!

806
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,550
Oh yeah!

807
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,830
The shaft descends towards the next lower level.

808
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,370
A ladder is situated on one side of the shaft.

809
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,670
Okay.

810
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,450
Well, take it.

811
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,650
The ladder leads into the dank heart of the labyrinth.

812
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,990
Danger lurks beneath.

813
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,990
Yet Pais' courageous resolve does not buckle.

814
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,810
Should Pais climb down the ladder?

815
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,430
Yeah!

816
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,950
Uh oh.

817
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,190
Climb up?

818
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,310
Oh my god.

819
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,870
Wait, can I see in first person?

820
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,740
Okay.

821
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,480
I think that guy is gonna stand up.

822
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,520
Plus my lottery luck?

823
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,540
Are you sure you want me to do that?

824
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,740
Moe!

825
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,180
Moe!

826
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,160
Jackpot!

827
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,860
Are you pressing triangle?

828
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,720
I'm pressing everything.

829
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,320
Oh, see?

830
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm afraid of booby traps, but let's just walk.

831
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,460
I mean run.

832
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,440
He's got a blinky thing.

833
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,480
I knew they were gonna get out!

834
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,140
Oh my god.

835
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,740
Are they all gonna get out?

836
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,840
Oh my god.

837
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,420
Oh my god.

838
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,020
Oh my god.

839
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,300
Don't hurt me!

840
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,180
Oh my gosh.

841
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,720
Health meter.

842
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,440
Thank you.

843
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,220
Sudden tutorial.

844
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,380
Oh my gosh.

845
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,980
Mini scooter, welcome to the membership.

846
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,360
Thank you!

847
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,680
This meter represents life energy.

848
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,340
Every time a character takes damage, the level will get lower.

849
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,980
When it reaches zero, the character will die.

850
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,820
Okay.

851
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,220
This function allows the manipulation of inventory items within the current room.

852
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,480
Okay.

853
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,320
Allow the current character to ready a weapon.

854
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:03,860
Okay.

855
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,340
This function allows the examination of objects within the inventory.

856
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,200
Press L or R allows switching back and forth between sections within the interface.

857
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,540
How do I get out?

858
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,060
B?

859
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,580
Maybe?

860
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,140
Oh my god.

861
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,900
Oh my god.

862
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,440
Oh my god.

863
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,700
Oh my god.

864
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,260
Turn around!

865
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,160
Turn around, Pius!

866
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,660
Augustus!

867
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,440
Pius!

868
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:26,860
Pius!

869
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,120
We...

870
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:27,980
Pius!

871
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,580
We need to run.

872
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:29,980
We're...

873
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,340
We're...

874
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,260
Oh my god.

875
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,400
Pius!

876
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,640
Did I know there were three of you?

877
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,360
Oh my god.

878
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:36,740
Ouch!

879
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,400
There we go.

880
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,100
Nice.

881
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,620
Nice one.

882
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,260
Chop him up!

883
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,000
Chop him up!

884
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,400
Don't let him walk again!

885
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,980
Oh, they're struggling.

886
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,720
Oh!

887
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:51,780
Oh!

888
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,260
Nice!

889
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,260
Can I step out?

890
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,760
Oh, finish him!

891
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,380
Yeah!

892
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,960
What about these guys over here?

893
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,700
I'm walking so sad.

894
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,120
You guys not a problem?

895
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,980
Alright.

896
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,220
I'm gonna take this cube!

897
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,680
A strange granite block lies on the floor.

898
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,760
Alright.

899
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,120
It's mine now!

900
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,920
Baby Core, thanks for the gift!

901
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,600
Happy birthday?

902
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,220
Wait, who...

903
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,040
Whose birthday?

904
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:41,900
Oh!

905
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,400
Lily!

906
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,400
Can I get a happy birthday?

907
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,380
I just turned 30!

908
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,740
I can feel myself turning to dust!

909
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,020
You're just like the skeletons!

910
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,980
Happy birthday to you!

911
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,100
Happy birthday to you!

912
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,240
Happy birthday dear Lily!

913
00:38:59,340 --> 00:38:59,900
Please!

914
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,380
Happy birthday to you...

915
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,820
Skeleton!

916
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,420
Nice.

917
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,400
There better not be anymore guys in the air!

918
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,640
Oh!

919
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:22,960
No one forgot us!

920
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,320
Slice and dice!

921
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:26,980
Slice and dice!

922
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,920
Oh my god, run away!

923
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,420
Finish him!

924
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,120
Finish him!

925
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,680
Finish him!

926
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:42,900
Nice.

927
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,340
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

928
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, I can finish this guy too.

929
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,720
I'm taking all your blocks!

930
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,740
You can't stop me!

931
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,220
This is how I learned how to read!

932
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,880
Strange granite block.

933
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,940
Pick it up.

934
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,340
Is this the same game?

935
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,320
I know, right?

936
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,760
Oh god.

937
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,280
Uh oh.

938
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,780
You guys.

939
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,360
Uh oh.

940
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,080
Oh god!

941
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,980
Oh god!

942
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,260
There's a lot of guys!

943
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,040
Pick up the block!

944
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,720
Pick up the block!

945
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,830
I think it's time to leave.

946
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,790
Did he just look at that too?

947
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,070
Did we just react to the same thing?

948
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,130
Coward!

949
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,810
What are you talking about?

950
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,190
There's a skele-man right here.

951
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,030
Can I sneak?

952
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,670
Why can't I walk?

953
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,010
Oh.

954
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:52,690
Okay.

955
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,370
Oh gosh.

956
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,710
I can't see where I'm going.

957
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,290
This is kinda bad.

958
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,010
Ouch!

959
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,830
Take his arm!

960
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,390
Take his arm!

961
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:04,890
Take his arm!

962
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,790
Take his body!

963
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,370
Take him!

964
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,830
Finish him!

965
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,810
I'm gonna go where he was going.

966
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,990
Oh, nevermind.

967
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,330
Did they say Pius?

968
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,190
They're obsessed with me!

969
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,790
The bars across the door block Pius's exit from the room!

970
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,990
Is there another skele over here?

971
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,150
Oh.

972
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:28,630
Okay.

973
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,550
I think I hear a skele.

974
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,430
Oh my god.

975
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,030
The angles.

976
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,210
The camera angles are seriously killing me right now.

977
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,810
Pius, I'm scared!

978
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,210
Pius!

979
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,110
Pius, I'm scared!

980
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:43,810
Pius!

981
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,030
Run!

982
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,320
Run, Pius!

983
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,520
Run!

984
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,140
Run, Pius!

985
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,280
Run!

986
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,860
Run, Pius!

987
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,160
Pius!

988
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,440
Pius!

989
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,120
I think they're gone.

990
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,020
Oh, he's not gone.

991
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,180
Ha!

992
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:04,900
Ha!

993
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,360
Ha!

994
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,400
Fist attack!

995
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,800
Attack!

996
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,100
Attack!

997
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,600
Don't die, Pius!

998
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,520
Don't die, Pius!

999
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,980
Pius, you gotta live!

1000
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,860
You gotta live, Pius!

1001
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,700
You gotta live!

1002
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,900
Pius, you have to live!

1003
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,700
Don't hit the wall, Pius!

1004
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,020
Pius!

1005
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,240
Get one hit in, please.

1006
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,680
Pius.

1007
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,500
Just one hit.

1008
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,260
Pius.

1009
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,740
Pius.

1010
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,540
No, finish him.

1011
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,760
Finish him.

1012
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,160
Kill off that guy.

1013
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,240
Kill off that guy.

1014
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,900
Kill off that guy.

1015
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,400
Okay.

1016
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,060
Pius is a changed man.

1017
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,440
He fears nothing now.

1018
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,880
I don't have a purple one.

1019
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,880
Wait, the purple one is my blade!

1020
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,660
Oh, just kidding.

1021
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,760
Who am I hearing?

1022
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,500
Oh, I think I'm hearing the flames.

1023
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,400
If I grab that, am I gonna...

1024
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,620
Something's gonna happen.

1025
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,620
The wall is predominantly decorated with a strange symbol carved into the granite.

1026
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,960
Cut into the wall is a square hole lined with the scratches as though something has been removed from it.

1027
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,980
Face your cube fear.

1028
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,360
I put all of them in though, right?

1029
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,800
Probably?

1030
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,680
Only two kids.

1031
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,480
My parents wouldn't let me play this one in Dead and Alive Beach Volleyball.

1032
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,440
I was told they were both just scared.

1033
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,200
I think maybe Dead or Alive would cause a scarier awakening than anything.

1034
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,820
Okay, I think I just put them all in.

1035
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,120
Alright, let's grab the cube.

1036
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,480
Women are pretty scary, I'm not gonna lie.

1037
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,840
Especially when they're sexy.

1038
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,490
Okay.

1039
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,870
Time to put it in.

1040
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,930
Wait, it won't let me.

1041
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,290
How do I get to the menu again?

1042
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,530
How do I... Oh, here.

1043
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,590
Oh, okay.

1044
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:16,650
Use.

1045
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:17,510
Ah!

1046
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,390
Just like that.

1047
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:18,730
Okay.

1048
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,130
Poor men scared of pretty girls.

1049
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,110
You're not.

1050
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,870
What if I put it in the wrong hole?

1051
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,990
What if I... What if I... What if I put blue into red?

1052
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,130
Wait, that was red, right?

1053
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,210
Oh, thank goodness.

1054
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:44,690
Whew!

1055
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,130
This is really cute.

1056
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,530
A dorkable ghost in the bottom right of the screen.

1057
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,210
Can you tell her that?

1058
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,810
I don't know.

1059
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,370
I don't know.

1060
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,330
Here we go!

1061
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,070
Avatar, the last airbender!

1062
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,310
Yippee!

1063
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,770
Just run for it, Pius.

1064
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,890
Pius Augustus.

1065
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,370
Just run for it.

1066
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,910
Don't let any scaly men tell you otherwise.

1067
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,430
Run!

1068
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,360
That's me!

1069
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,120
They really are obsessive.

1070
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,280
Wait, am I gonna have to fight myself?

1071
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,120
What is going on?

1072
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,700
Pius, you must prove your worth by destroying this statue.

1073
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,940
Pressing R will enable Pius to select which target to attack.

1074
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,000
Releasing R slightly and then pressing it again will cycle between multiple targets.

1075
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:48,660
Pius can attack specific body parts while locked onto an enemy by moving the... the... the... the... the... stick?

1076
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,960
And pressing A.

1077
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,000
Use up to attack the head.

1078
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,220
Left and right to attack the arms.

1079
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,340
Okay.

1080
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,510
Oh!

1081
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,990
Oh!

1082
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,170
Yippee!

1083
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:16,730
Okay.

1084
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,910
I had to destroy myself.

1085
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,990
I'm going... I'm not leaving.

1086
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,070
I'm going deeper in.

1087
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:23,910
It's a ghost.

1088
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,530
Can't you tell skeletons to leave?

1089
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,150
Probably.

1090
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:27,910
Oh my gosh.

1091
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:30,950
Oh my gosh.

1092
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:31,590
Oh my god.

1093
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,050
Oh my god.

1094
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,570
I feel that I attack faster if I'm not... if I'm not locked in though.

1095
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,190
Oh my god.

1096
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:42,310
Get them all!

1097
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,810
Take them out!

1098
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:43,310
Take them out!

1099
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:43,730
Take them out!

1100
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,040
Ouch.

1101
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,820
Oh my god.

1102
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,180
Pius, don't die on us.

1103
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,600
Pius!

1104
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,820
Pius Augustus!

1105
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,380
Pius Augustus, please!

1106
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,100
Oh my gosh.

1107
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,560
Oh.

1108
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,380
Finish him!

1109
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,380
Oh.

1110
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,160
I think he's... I think he's... finish him.

1111
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,660
There we go.

1112
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,960
Pius!

1113
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,660
Oh no!

1114
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,940
He's bleeding my bed!

1115
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,260
What is this?

1116
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,500
A button attached to a small pylon softly illuminates the room.

1117
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,640
A bizarre energy seems to radiate from it.

1118
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,200
Push the button.

1119
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,640
Hold on.

1120
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,400
Oh my god.

1121
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,260
I can barely even run.

1122
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,640
Pius, you're not gonna make it.

1123
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,820
Why is there no way to defend myself?

1124
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,890
He just needs to...

1125
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,390
He just needs to radiate.

1126
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,070
Press for a second.

1127
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,450
It's just a...

1128
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,290
It is a flesh wound.

1129
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,810
Pius Augustus about to be Pius Adustus.

1130
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,450
What is this thing anyway?

1131
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:01,970
Health?

1132
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:02,410
No?

1133
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:02,730
Okay.

1134
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,770
Push the button.

1135
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:12,850
Oh.

1136
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:13,250
Oh.

1137
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,810
Is this gonna send me home?

1138
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,570
Wait, this might send me home.

1139
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,130
It looks kind of similar to the thing that we came here with.

1140
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,310
There we go.

1141
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,030
Um...

1142
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,190
Pius ain't looking so hot, you guys.

1143
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,970
Pius looks like he's about to throw up.

1144
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,070
Pius is...

1145
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,870
Pius said, but it was beer o'clock.

1146
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,100
Do I pick one?

1147
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,540
What's this?

1148
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,640
Shaped like a delicate dome, a pale blue statuette floats gracefully above the pedestal.

1149
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,680
No, no, no.

1150
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,740
Oh my gosh.

1151
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,660
It's choose your starter Pokemon.

1152
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:18,460
An effigy resembling a warped angel shaped from dark green emerald hovers effortlessly above the pedestal.

1153
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,700
A strange sculpture resembling a red-clawed worm.

1154
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,740
Does it?

1155
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,300
Mysteriously float above the pedestal.

1156
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,300
Hmm...

1157
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,720
I think because I'm green.

1158
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,420
I should pick green.

1159
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,480
Also, I like the warped angel.

1160
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,330
Pius Augustus, what powers do we grant upon you?

1161
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,310
Oh.

1162
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:57,970
You're okay.

1163
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,550
He's seeing...

1164
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,030
He's seeing green.

1165
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,820
No, Pius!

1166
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,290
Pius Augustus, no!

1167
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:32,930
Eons have passed since then, and I have learned much.

1168
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,110
I haven't learned anything.

1169
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:39,190
I was once as naive as a child, but now my mind is sharp.

1170
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:46,530
With the power of Xelatoth, I can now read the thoughts of others and make them raving mad with a mere sight.

1171
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:46,770
I have a suggestion.

1172
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,890
Face me, and you shall surely perish.

1173
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,230
What?

1174
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,790
Guess it ain't easy being green.

1175
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,050
Tome of Eternal Darkness!

1176
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,390
Yippee!

1177
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:06,860
Um...

1178
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,980
Can we read it now?

1179
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,120
Strangely, with the Tome of Eternal Darkness in her possession, Alex can read the page!

1180
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,220
It is a chapter page from the Tome itself.

1181
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,820
Yes.

1182
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,580
The Binding of the Corpse God!

1183
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,360
Xelatoth turned Pius into an influencer.

1184
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,420
What do you mean an influencer?

1185
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,880
Yo!

1186
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,400
Corpse God!

1187
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,080
Oh, wait, I didn't read this before.

1188
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,140
A small shrine of candles.

1189
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,680
Their placement appears to be very deliberate, matching the etchings on the table and the wall's illustrations.

1190
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,440
The candles are unlit.

1191
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:51,980
Okay...

1192
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,240
None of this has changed, so...

1193
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,300
I guess we can leave?

1194
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,520
It's so dark.

1195
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,980
Even for me, it's hard to see.

1196
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,200
Okay.

1197
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,520
Oh, gosh.

1198
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,120
What am I going to have to fight?

1199
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,040
I have the slowest ever!

1200
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,640
If you suffer from VTuber syndrome, ask your doctor if Xelatoth is right for you.

1201
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,300
Okay, so now that we solved the grandfather clock, and we have the Tome...

1202
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,180
Oh, wait!

1203
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,840
We have the dagger!

1204
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,160
Let's go do...

1205
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,900
I think it was...

1206
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,400
It was this way.

1207
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,920
Let's go do the dagger that will let us into the other room.

1208
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,300
In here, I believe.

1209
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,380
I believe.

1210
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,170
Oh, yeah.

1211
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,930
I thought it was purple before.

1212
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,550
Oh, do I need to use it?

1213
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,390
Oh, so now I have to address your key...

1214
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,030
Second floor key?

1215
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,930
When did I get that?

1216
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:07,390
Under scale.

1217
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,130
Thanks for three months!

1218
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,570
It was purple before.

1219
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,630
Ah...

1220
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:12,890
Shoo...

1221
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,670
Alex places the blade in the slot, but feels it push back.

1222
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,230
It is as if the magic of the blade does not fit the lock.

1223
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:30,290
Let's go to the second floor since I apparently got a second floor key...

1224
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,410
and I don't know when I got that.

1225
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,500
The key comes apart in the lock.

1226
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,000
The key to the second floor is broken.

1227
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,580
Perhaps there is a way of repairing it.

1228
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,020
Yippee!

1229
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,440
Uh...

1230
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,480
It's saying that there is...

1231
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,060
TV table tray gifted to memberships.

1232
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,460
Thank you!

1233
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,740
I think it's a little delayed, but thank you guys!

1234
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,560
Yay, we got the broken key!

1235
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,280
Yay!

1236
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,340
Wait, how did they investigate this mansion?

1237
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,020
How did they investigate the mansion if they didn't have access to the second floor?

1238
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,740
No wonder they didn't solve anything.

1239
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,120
What if the murderer is in the second...

1240
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,360
It's right up there!

1241
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,080
And we don't know about it!

1242
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,700
Okay, maybe here.

1243
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,000
I like this room.

1244
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,200
It's nice and bright.

1245
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,900
It's pretty.

1246
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,480
It's so cool.

1247
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:41,820
Wait!

1248
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,400
Is this the dresser?

1249
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,900
No way.

1250
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,040
Oh, never mind.

1251
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:52,720
Tizana!

1252
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,620
Welcome to membership!

1253
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,260
Bye, bubboy!

1254
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,320
Thanks for the five gifted!

1255
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,860
Thank you, guys.

1256
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,100
I don't know why I'm shifting here.

1257
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,600
Hmm...

1258
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,580
Like it doesn't... I don't see anything moving.

1259
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,640
Hmm...

1260
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,060
What's up with that?

1261
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,220
What's up with that?

1262
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,420
Maybe I need to still wait on this one.

1263
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,720
Hmm... Oh, what was that?

1264
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,300
Examine?

1265
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,860
Oh!

1266
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,860
In the warm glow of candlelight, the Roivis family tree hangs from the wall.

1267
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,880
Shadows flitter across its surface, obscuring the detail.

1268
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,220
If one looks closely, the family's secrets are revealed.

1269
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,730
Oh my god!

1270
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,330
There's a dead man!

1271
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,190
I saw the secret!

1272
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,210
Is there anything on these shelves?

1273
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,070
I didn't see anything.

1274
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,870
Also, I noticed that she, like, does that thing in old games where they, like, look at what you need to observe.

1275
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,100
Tax fraud.

1276
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,930
What am I examining?

1277
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:23,410
Oh!

1278
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,430
The books in this corner seem to focus on the supernatural.

1279
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:33,370
The writings of Poe, Lovecraft, the poetry of Blake, the art of Bosch...

1280
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,830
Everything with a tie to ethereal horror or fantasy.

1281
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,230
It is all here.

1282
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,550
A reference library to the arcane.

1283
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,910
Was this Alex's grandfather's secret hobby?

1284
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,330
My grandpa was a freak!

1285
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:49,850
Let's go!

1286
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,660
Was there anything that I couldn't read before?

1287
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,940
Now I have my special tome.

1288
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,320
My special book.

1289
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,080
Wait, what is this?

1290
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:04,960
Oh!

1291
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,780
I cannot say what was the true beginning, nor am I sure of its end.

1292
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,080
Oh!

1293
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,280
So perhaps here is the best place to start.

1294
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:14,840
Okay!

1295
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:21,160
I am reminded of ideas I first encountered in Sir James George Frazer's book, The Golden Bough.

1296
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,600
A study in magic and religion.

1297
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,000
The Golden Bough.

1298
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,960
We are overwhelmed by a very human need to weave a web of meaning where there may be none.

1299
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:37,660
Since time immemorial, ancient peoples have dressed up their lack of knowledge as gods and demons.

1300
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,480
You calling them stupid?

1301
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,460
I have discovered that sometimes...

1302
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,760
the fates of gods and mortals intertwine...

1303
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,740
and legends are born.

1304
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,900
The Golden Bough.

1305
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,880
Oh!

1306
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,500
Thy time is done, great ancient.

1307
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,520
Thy time.

1308
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,780
Forever in shadow will you be master of chaos.

1309
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,760
And to fade to nothing in obscurity will be thy fate.

1310
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,000
My master has planned no millennia for this day.

1311
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,520
It is the true chaos of all things that you now must be entombed amongst the beings of flesh and bone.

1312
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:18,940
Oh!

1313
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,880
You have a great monument here, Mount Turok.

1314
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:26,520
It is a pity that no one will ever recognize it.

1315
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,940
That's... that's our guy!

1316
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,340
May the darkness claim thee, quarreling chaos and damned beast.

1317
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,480
No longer will thy reign be kept over the ancients.

1318
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,080
You have kept imprisoned.

1319
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,440
The voice of the Fury.

1320
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:48,560
Thou hast seen the last of this world.

1321
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,040
He's voiced by the Fury?

1322
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,640
This guy, Pius Augustus?

1323
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,160
No way!

1324
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,280
And Big Boss.

1325
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,580
What is going on?

1326
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,340
No!

1327
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,860
Don't hurt him!

1328
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:16,350
Not even these mythical fables can keep me amused.

1329
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,370
There has to be something to do around here.

1330
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:25,630
I only wish something that fantastic and of higher purpose could happen to me.

1331
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,110
Oh, let's have it.

1332
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,010
Let's let it happen.

1333
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,050
Oh!

1334
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:30,730
Uh-oh.

1335
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,410
Um, the door just shut on its own.

1336
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,530
The door is firmly closed, sealing the temple.

1337
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,330
Perhaps there is another exit somewhere inside?

1338
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,510
Uh-oh.

1339
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:44,450
I have my weapon.

1340
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,130
Uh-oh.

1341
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,270
My short sword.

1342
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,370
Wish granted.

1343
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,250
Good job, girl.

1344
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,150
You manifested it.

1345
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:54,470
This is...

1346
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,810
Also, her cheek.

1347
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,690
Her singular cheek is out.

1348
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,370
Um...

1349
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:05,530
The statue of a goddess delicately sculpted from sandstone.

1350
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,390
It casts an alert eye over...

1351
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,730
Oh, sorry.

1352
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,590
Everyone who enters the temple.

1353
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,610
There is a strange necklace around its neck.

1354
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,010
Should Elia take the necklace from the statue?

1355
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:21,810
Um...

1356
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,360
Hmm...

1357
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,480
Hmm...

1358
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,060
I don't...

1359
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,540
This game has tons of Metal Gear voice actors?

1360
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,800
The girl you are now is Mei Ling?

1361
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,940
Wait, I can hear it, though.

1362
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,160
No, but yes.

1363
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,100
Probably not, but sure.

1364
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:41,640
Okay.

1365
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,320
Strange necklace!

1366
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,640
We're stealing from...

1367
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,960
Uh-oh.

1368
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,500
This necklace can be used to heal Elia.

1369
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,880
Make sure that Elia does not move when the spell is being cast.

1370
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:57,780
Oh.

1371
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,220
We have health!

1372
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,600
Ten times!

1373
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:04,740
Okay.

1374
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,980
I can't see anything.

1375
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,100
It's so dark.

1376
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,680
I'm just casually walking around this temple.

1377
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,400
Whatever.

1378
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:18,960
Oh no.

1379
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,620
I see them on the ground, you guys.

1380
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,980
Look at all of them!

1381
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,140
They're all going to come to life!

1382
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:26,600
Oh!

1383
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,840
I hit the cutscene.

1384
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,460
What were you doing chilling in here that you didn't know that they could...

1385
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,820
That there were bodies in here too?

1386
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,300
I'm just saying.

1387
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,080
These guys are so...

1388
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:41,960
So, we're gonna come to life.

1389
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,120
Okay.

1390
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,500
And then this.

1391
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,460
Okay.

1392
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,760
Yeah, the sun is over there.

1393
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,860
So that's where the sun is.

1394
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,360
I get it.

1395
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,440
I don't do anything here though, right?

1396
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,500
Oh gosh, don't come to life.

1397
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,240
Don't raise.

1398
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,560
Don't lift.

1399
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,940
What are you doing?

1400
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,600
No way.

1401
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,160
Why were you chilling in here again?

1402
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,160
I don't understand.

1403
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,560
It's kind of a sick beat.

1404
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,640
Oh my god.

1405
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,540
What did I just press?

1406
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,140
What did I just press?

1407
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:46,960
Don't press that.

1408
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,340
No!

1409
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,900
Why are you pressing all the buttons?

1410
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:49,720
You idiot.

1411
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,120
Don't press anything.

1412
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:56,840
Elia, please.

1413
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,040
You're making me nervous.

1414
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,780
Look how many dead...

1415
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,700
Oh gosh, I have to walk over this one though, don't I?

1416
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,640
Okay.

1417
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,020
What just happened?

1418
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,580
Okay.

1419
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,840
I'm out of here.

1420
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,660
Oh my gosh.

1421
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:20,820
Oh my god.

1422
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,100
Ew.

1423
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,500
Oh, he's...

1424
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:22,900
Oh.

1425
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,920
When located by creatures, a sanity loss occurs, causing a decrease in the levels of the sanity meter and the character's supposed green.

1426
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,780
Beware!

1427
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,400
Sanity loss affects perception and eventually health.

1428
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,560
Um...

1429
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,600
Wait, so...

1430
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,220
I...

1431
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,420
Being located by creatures...

1432
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,960
Oh my god.

1433
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,320
I'm just jumping into the thing.

1434
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,080
Oh gosh, Elfrid, thank you!

1435
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,180
That's why you're Ace Detective Minto, because you asked the obvious questions the other cops didn't know.

1436
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,280
I'm suddenly thrown into a thing!

1437
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,560
Tutorial jump scare.

1438
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,220
Oh my gosh.

1439
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,060
He doesn't know where I am.

1440
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,370
He doesn't know where I am.

1441
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:12,350
Oh my god.

1442
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:12,710
I'm trapped.

1443
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,910
Oh.

1444
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:14,310
Uh.

1445
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:15,610
Oh, please.

1446
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,030
Ouch.

1447
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,830
Performing a finishing move on a creature recovers sanity.

1448
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,050
Oh yeah!

1449
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,250
Oh, I had to kill him.

1450
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:27,730
Finish him!

1451
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,270
Oh.

1452
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,010
Finish him?

1453
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:31,950
Ah!

1454
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:35,790
That was low.

1455
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,350
That was a low blow game.

1456
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,630
It wouldn't let me finish him!

1457
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,690
There was no thing to finish.

1458
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,650
There was no, like, little thing.

1459
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:49,510
Engraved on the floor is striking design featuring a brightly burning sun.

1460
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,150
Why?

1461
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:53,470
Oh.

1462
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:55,690
Oh.

1463
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,410
Another bronze.

1464
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:57,710
Nice.

1465
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:57,910
A bronze necklace.

1466
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:58,190
Hold on.

1467
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:58,990
Let me turn on my...

1468
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:02,510
My fan.

1469
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:03,390
It's getting hot in here.

1470
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,710
Bronze necklace sitting atop an ancient clay urn.

1471
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,590
Um.

1472
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,270
I'll take that.

1473
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:10,650
I'm just gonna...

1474
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,810
Just gonna take every...

1475
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:12,210
You know what?

1476
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,190
This...

1477
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,610
This...

1478
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,310
This temple has done no service for me.

1479
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,150
I'm gonna take everything.

1480
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:17,530
Awesome.

1481
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,770
We can see her, like, up close now.

1482
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,710
She is so cute.

1483
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,770
Look at them cheeks!

1484
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,130
Oh!

1485
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:27,710
Oh!

1486
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:27,970
Yeah!

1487
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:29,890
She is so cute!

1488
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:34,310
The sun is in the middle.

1489
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,610
Oh, the design on the wall appears to depict the time of the day.

1490
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,730
Perhaps the candles do too.

1491
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,830
Press Y, A, X to light or extinguish the candles.

1492
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:45,150
Okay.

1493
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:46,730
So...

1494
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:48,730
Oh.

1495
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:49,190
My bad.

1496
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:49,930
Um.

1497
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:54,450
Oh, okay.

1498
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:55,050
So, I...

1499
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,170
I'm extinguishing this one.

1500
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:57,490
There we go.

1501
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:57,690
Okay.

1502
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,360
So, I just wanna put something on the ground.

1503
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:02,560
A...

1504
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,280
Oh!

1505
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:09,680
How...

1506
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,240
Uh...

1507
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,980
Do I need to do more?

1508
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:15,580
No?

1509
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,280
Nothing else?

1510
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,720
Let me in, please!

1511
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,580
Door is open slightly but not enough for Elia to go over it.

1512
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:23,960
Just...

1513
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,640
Just use your arms.

1514
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,660
It's jammed.

1515
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,880
There were two that were jammed, though.

1516
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,060
What was the other one?

1517
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,180
Oh, gosh.

1518
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:34,540
Alright.

1519
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,340
Hey skellies.

1520
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,860
Don't come waking up.

1521
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,500
Okay.

1522
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,880
Now ain't the time.

1523
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:44,920
Oh my god.

1524
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,380
I think the thing just popped again.

1525
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:48,800
Okay.

1526
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,500
Oh gosh.

1527
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,800
Alright, careful.

1528
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:52,780
You know what, Elia?

1529
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,120
Wait.

1530
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,700
Which would be...

1531
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,480
You know what, let's only hit one and not two.

1532
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,120
You know what I'm saying?

1533
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:57,820
Okay.

1534
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,280
Nice.

1535
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,160
I'm kind of a genius.

1536
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,380
Nice.

1537
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,180
Finish him!

1538
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:16,980
Oh gosh.

1539
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:17,320
Run.

1540
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,360
Finish him!

1541
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,220
Oh shoot.

1542
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,820
I got his arm!

1543
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,400
I got his other arm!

1544
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,740
I got his head!

1545
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,280
Finish him!

1546
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:30,820
Finish him!

1547
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,080
Finish him!

1548
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:31,480
Finish him!

1549
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,300
Finish him!

1550
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:32,700
Yeah!

1551
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,540
That's right.

1552
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,940
Oh my god.

1553
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,440
Oh my god.

1554
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,720
Take his arm out.

1555
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,800
Take his other arm out.

1556
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,320
Or finish him.

1557
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,240
Yeah!

1558
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:45,800
Yeah!

1559
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,500
We did it, baby!

1560
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,040
Well this is... how it's supposed to look.

1561
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,260
She's gaming.

1562
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,260
I was first intimidated by the system.

1563
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,740
But actually it's not so bad.

1564
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,840
Is there anything else over here?

1565
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,840
I know that this...

1566
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,740
Is this door closed or something?

1567
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,320
The door is now closed, preventing Elia's passage to the other side.

1568
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,940
What did I miss over here?

1569
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,340
I should have explored before I grabbed...

1570
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,460
Before I stole!

1571
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,260
I can't see anything.

1572
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:33,520
Oh!

1573
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,880
The triangular design is carved into the floor.

1574
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,060
The etched grooves are filled with colored sand.

1575
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:46,140
The symbols appear to be related to each other with having one precedence over another.

1576
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,560
You got all that information from... that?

1577
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,350
Where am I supposed to go though?

1578
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,450
Eat the sand.

1579
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,190
Was there anything in here?

1580
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,850
Oh my gosh.

1581
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,090
I almost stepped on this one.

1582
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,230
I didn't step on it though, right?

1583
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,350
Look at this guy.

1584
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,550
He looks like he's just...

1585
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,490
He looks like he's...

1586
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,090
He's just like...

1587
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,710
Is she gonna notice?

1588
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,050
Is she gonna notice?

1589
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,080
Relation of the three gods is akin to rock, paper, scissors.

1590
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,990
We did this one.

1591
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,830
And we got the other necklace.

1592
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:55,510
Hold on.

1593
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,830
Oh, let me see what this does.

1594
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,790
Can't use it.

1595
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:01,350
There's also a map.

1596
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:03,930
Okay.

1597
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,370
Cinema.

1598
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,170
Okay.

1599
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:17,610
Kinda...

1600
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,150
Do I use it here?

1601
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:22,510
No.

1602
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:24,430
Maybe...

1603
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,850
Down here?

1604
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:26,630
Oh gosh.

1605
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,070
I have to go all the way through here again.

1606
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,390
Oh my god.

1607
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:32,870
Why is it pop?

1608
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:36,730
Shimmy.

1609
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,150
Shimmy passed.

1610
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,830
Don't press the button.

1611
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,250
Don't press the button.

1612
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,750
There's a check option.

1613
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,790
Oh, that's right.

1614
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:47,590
What was it?

1615
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:49,930
That's right.

1616
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,070
A well-crafted bronze necklace.

1617
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,830
Resplendent with glowing gems.

1618
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:54,590
Oh.

1619
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:55,590
What are we?

1620
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,550
That didn't really tell me anything though.

1621
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,020
Anything in here?

1622
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,900
Blue, red, red, red, green.

1623
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,320
Hmm.

1624
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,840
Da, da, da.

1625
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,180
Candles do too.

1626
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,340
Candles do too.

1627
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,660
Oh mama.

1628
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,620
Where did you get a necklace before?

1629
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,660
You guys are so smart.

1630
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,700
You want this one?

1631
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,300
It's prettier.

1632
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,190
Thank you.

1633
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,260
Okay.

1634
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:12,840
I'm ready.

1635
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,000
To fight.

1636
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,680
Maybe.

1637
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,360
I'm scared.

1638
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,820
These guys scare me.

1639
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,840
It's a sunset.

1640
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,580
Engraved on the floor is a striking design featuring the sun...

1641
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:28,980
Oh, sorry.

1642
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:29,480
Sunrise.

1643
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,930
This one is correct.

1644
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,600
The save?

1645
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:43,600
Well, okay.

1646
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,460
So I had a bit of an issue with my...

1647
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,780
I gotta go find a proper...

1648
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,580
A proper...

1649
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,920
A proper...

1650
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,260
What's the word?

1651
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:53,940
Memory card.

1652
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,520
Because I don't have one.

1653
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,240
So I can't really save right now.

1654
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,200
So I just said we'll...

1655
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,880
We'll deal with that later.

1656
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,120
Probably.

1657
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:20,480
Why?

1658
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:20,800
Am I coming back?

1659
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Am I coming up to a boss or something?

1660
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,660
Or is that what you're hinting at?

1661
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,260
Is that what you're hinting at?

1662
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,320
I'm coming up to a boss?

1663
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,580
Don't scare me.

1664
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:36,700
Oh.

1665
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,380
Rogue-like.

1666
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,700
I'll just...

1667
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,280
I'll just fix it later.

1668
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:47,600
Again.

1669
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,900
I don't...

1670
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,100
Oh.

1671
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:53,820
Oh.

1672
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,160
Oh.

1673
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,540
He is gross.

1674
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:57,740
Oh.

1675
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:57,880
atives.

1676
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,200
Oh my gosh.

1677
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:58,820
Oh my god.

1678
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,160
Oh my god.

1679
01:13:59,220 --> 01:13:59,380
Oh my god.

1680
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,400
Oh.

1681
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:06,570
My gosh.

1682
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,290
He hits hard.

1683
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,830
He hits hard.

1684
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,110
Oh.

1685
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:08,650
I got his hand.

1686
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,070
I got his hand.

1687
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:17,510
Uhh.

1688
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,930
He hits really hard.

1689
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:20,570
Nice.

1690
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,090
Got him.

1691
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:25,990
Oh, what?

1692
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:26,750
He grows his hand back.

1693
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,970
That's fucked up.

1694
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,490
That's messed up.

1695
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:28,930
That's messed up.

1696
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:29,350
That's messed up.

1697
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:34,470
Finish him!

1698
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:36,910
Oh

1699
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,140
my god.

1700
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:43,820
Yikes.

1701
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:44,520
Yikes.

1702
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,000
Striking design featuring a starry sky filling the heavens.

1703
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,920
Yeah, I can heal, that's right.

1704
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:01,590
I think I just sold my soul.

1705
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,930
Oh, we gotta extinguish everything.

1706
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,150
This one... and this one.

1707
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,890
It's so dark.

1708
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:17,790
Yeah!

1709
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,870
Good job selling your soul, thank you.

1710
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,220
I see them.

1711
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,540
I see the traps on the ground.

1712
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,280
Oh my gosh, this one is tight though.

1713
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,760
What is this?

1714
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:59,200
A small pedestal covered with decorative etching stands before the wall.

1715
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,300
The blowgun upon it must have some sort of...

1716
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,080
special significance for it to be the focal point of this display.

1717
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,080
Spooky stick, yeah.

1718
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,000
Alright, what's on this side?

1719
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:12,580
Nothing.

1720
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,420
Everybody only cares about the blowhole, I guess.

1721
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,820
Should I take the blowhole?

1722
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,900
My first M&M postcard arrives in Germany.

1723
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:22,720
Yippee!

1724
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,180
Blue enemies die, they explode.

1725
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,320
The more of them together, the more damage the explosion...

1726
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:31,440
Oh!

1727
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,400
So the enemies have like different...

1728
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,240
Different...

1729
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,100
What's the word?

1730
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,680
Uh, powers, I suppose?

1731
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,840
Oh, it said blowgun!

1732
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,600
I kept saying blowhole, I'm so sorry.

1733
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,160
It's a blowgun.

1734
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:58,210
No!

1735
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,430
Oh my gosh, be careful, don't die by your own weapon!

1736
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,950
I should not have taken the blowgun.

1737
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,970
I hear Mei Ling so much now.

1738
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:09,810
Oh my god.

1739
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:12,270
What's happening?

1740
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:14,110
Who are you?

1741
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:16,490
Oh, shoot.

1742
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:17,690
I think they noticed me.

1743
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:20,050
I think they noticed me.

1744
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,890
I think I need to get out of here.

1745
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:23,550
I think I need to leave.

1746
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:24,910
I think it's time for me to go.

1747
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,650
I think it's time to skedaddle.

1748
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,850
Uh-oh.

1749
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:29,790
Oh my god, skedaddle!

1750
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,870
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

1751
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,250
I think it's time for me to leave.

1752
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,510
I think it's time for me to leave.

1753
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:36,990
I think it's time for me to...

1754
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,710
That was me, right?

1755
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,530
Oh, rip the guy!

1756
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:46,730
There was a guy, you're right.

1757
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:47,930
I should go help him, right?

1758
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,060
How do I attack?

1759
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,340
He's fine, right?

1760
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,160
Oh, shoot!

1761
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:12,840
Oh my god.

1762
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:13,720
Whoa, what's going on?

1763
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,980
Oh, I have a certain number.

1764
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,440
I think this game is hard.

1765
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,540
Might be time to leave.

1766
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,070
I'm chilling.

1767
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,350
Yeah, I'm just going to chill.

1768
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,190
Until the other guy leaves.

1769
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,410
I don't have a good weapon anymore.

1770
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,030
I shouldn't...

1771
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:52,170
I should have never taken this stupid...

1772
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:54,530
Oh my god.

1773
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:55,550
Oh my god.

1774
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:57,150
Punch him!

1775
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:57,530
Oh!

1776
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,850
Uh oh.

1777
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,470
Uh oh.

1778
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:01,630
Oh!

1779
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:02,370
This is bad.

1780
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:02,890
This is bad.

1781
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:03,270
This is bad.

1782
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:05,450
Oh shoot.

1783
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,850
Oh shoot.

1784
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:06,150
Oh shoot.

1785
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:06,430
Oh shoot.

1786
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:12,830
Yeah!

1787
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,560
Oh my god.

1788
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,020
Run, run, run.

1789
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,460
Oh, he died.

1790
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:20,920
He died.

1791
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,200
Oh...

1792
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:24,820
I did it.

1793
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:26,460
My sanity...

1794
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:28,560
I think I did it.

1795
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,620
Let me actually finish him so that I can get the sanity back.

1796
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:37,540
Okay.

1797
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,220
We're good.

1798
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,020
Everything's fine.

1799
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,320
You're making decent progress if you're here by the time I got home from work?

1800
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,300
Oh, really?

1801
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,580
I think I'm just a genius.

1802
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:49,600
Wait.

1803
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,060
Description.

1804
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,200
I saw it.

1805
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:55,280
There was a... details, but it disappeared.

1806
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,100
Oh, examine.

1807
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:07,380
This mural depicts a skeletal demon befriending the ancient Khmer people by denouncing one of their fertility gods.

1808
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,560
Yeah!

1809
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,380
Down with babies!

1810
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,220
Up with demons!

1811
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,020
Yeah!

1812
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:22,610
I see it.

1813
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,110
They say, yeah, we hate babies.

1814
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:25,650
Yeah!

1815
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,290
Celibacy!

1816
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:27,850
Yeah!

1817
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,030
Demons!

1818
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:31,550
Demons are like, yeah, screw those babies.

1819
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,890
Understandable.

1820
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:44,690
Yeah, we hate babies!

1821
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,870
I love abstinence!

1822
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:59,710
Whatever happened to the guy that... I'll be honest, I thought the guy was me.

1823
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,530
The guy that was crying in that other room?

1824
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:04,610
Did I really get him killed?

1825
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,190
Aw, my bad man.

1826
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:09,630
Oh, what's this here?

1827
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,150
Is there anything here?

1828
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:13,130
Oh.

1829
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:13,970
What is this?

1830
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,110
There is a hole in the device as though something can be inserted.

1831
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:18,750
Perhaps a key or a lever.

1832
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:22,110
My blowgun!

1833
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:22,970
Obviously.

1834
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:31,930
Bad end result?

1835
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:32,530
No!

1836
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,550
Bad end result?

1837
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:33,550
No!

1838
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:36,830
It's fine, probably.

1839
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:41,750
Wait, this is a different room, right?

1840
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,730
Yeah, this is a different room.

1841
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:47,870
How am I supposed to get around this trap?

1842
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,090
I don't think I'm supposed to.

1843
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,710
I'm supposed to heal Maeve.

1844
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:01,650
My health is still at half, but she's acting like a little baby about it.

1845
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,570
You're all set.

1846
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:10,650
Just selling my soul.

1847
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:11,950
Just selling my soul.

1848
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:19,030
Okay, now it's the only... Now it's just the one that I have to walk through.

1849
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:23,550
Oh shoot.

1850
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:24,070
Oh shoot.

1851
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:24,610
Oh shoot.

1852
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,030
Oh shoot.

1853
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:25,550
Oh shoot.

1854
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:27,550
Where did they... Ouch!

1855
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,890
Ouch!

1856
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:28,050
Ouch!

1857
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:28,170
Ouch!

1858
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,090
Where did they come through?

1859
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:29,850
Where did they come through?

1860
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,110
I can't tell at all.

1861
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:33,030
Okay, I think I'm alright.

1862
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:36,130
Oh my gosh.

1863
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:36,730
I was not alright.

1864
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,690
Oh my god.

1865
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,010
I have to walk through these!

1866
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:41,930
This is so messed up.

1867
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:47,950
Okay.

1868
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:48,350
Okay.

1869
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,710
Alrighty.

1870
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,910
I have to walk through this one too.

1871
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,260
Oh, the girls are fighting.

1872
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,160
I think they're dumb.

1873
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,680
I'm just not gonna examine that.

1874
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,620
Can I let them fight?

1875
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,040
They won't notice me, right?

1876
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:27,670
Nice.

1877
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:29,230
Oh, I think he's noticed me.

1878
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,630
Oh my god.

1879
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:32,010
Run, run, run.

1880
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:37,250
Run, run, run, run.

1881
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:39,810
He changed colors.

1882
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:47,930
Oh, I didn't do that.

1883
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,130
Wait, why is he dying?

1884
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,790
Oh, did I poison them?

1885
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:52,930
Oh, interesting.

1886
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,010
Patooy!

1887
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:02,930
Interesting.

1888
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:06,270
Okay, I was wondering why they were taking damage sometimes.

1889
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:07,990
What is going on here?

1890
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:08,990
Oh, my bad.

1891
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:14,450
The mural depicts one of the ancient Khmer deities being tortured and killed by a skeletal demon.

1892
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,990
Wait, is this Pius?

1893
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,290
Is that Pius right there?

1894
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,370
Was he in the one before?

1895
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,590
And that's the thing that he...

1896
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:38,410
Oh, it's like the thing that he... well, it kind of looks like it.

1897
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:42,970
Pius my Oshi.

1898
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,170
Okay, she keeps looking up.

1899
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:49,890
Makes me wanna...

1900
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,350
Okay, so we came from this door.

1901
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:53,830
I remember, so we gotta go this way.

1902
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:55,990
It's Pius!

1903
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:56,470
Thank you, thank you.

1904
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:57,190
Choo!

1905
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:58,150
Choo!

1906
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,330
Mei Ling!

1907
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:04,630
Oh, my god.

1908
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,290
My screen is like... do you see this?

1909
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:12,210
If you die without saving, you'll need to start the game all over again.

1910
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,550
Mint, try to think ahead and consider what might go wrong.

1911
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,470
Oh, my god, my screen.

1912
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:26,390
Oh!

1913
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:28,130
Oh!

1914
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,740
This is...

1915
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,120
Wowie!

1916
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,400
This is the room!

1917
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,280
Oh, my god.

1918
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:44,820
Oh, my god.

1919
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,220
Hello?

1920
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,100
He's asleep.

1921
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,240
He's snoring.

1922
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,100
Don't mind every eyeball being open.

1923
01:25:59,340 --> 01:25:59,480
Stop.

1924
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,160
Don't go near it.

1925
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,200
Oh, oh, oh.

1926
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,020
Why

1927
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:08,920
is she chilling in here?

1928
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,580
I'm so...

1929
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:13,820
So, you are reduced to feeding on flesh and bone.

1930
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,580
How the mighty have fallen.

1931
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,620
Ooh, get called out.

1932
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,760
Surely fester for millennia to come.

1933
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,580
A slow...

1934
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,740
Don't go near it.

1935
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,920
And torturous hate for thee.

1936
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,620
You had best leave, young fool.

1937
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,940
Okay, I will.

1938
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,980
Or you'll find yourself as food for the dead god.

1939
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,560
I'm out of here.

1940
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,120
Oh.

1941
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,940
How do I get out?

1942
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,540
Can you help me?

1943
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,000
Ah!

1944
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:47,670
Um...

1945
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,630
I'm taking...

1946
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:52,110
You are one of the chosen many.

1947
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,590
Flesh and blood.

1948
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:55,150
Huh?

1949
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:01,390
It is now your destiny to fight the eternal darkness.

1950
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:01,870
Oh!

1951
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:05,490
She's just passing out.

1952
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:08,430
I give you a gift in return for an obligation.

1953
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,270
Uh-huh.

1954
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:12,350
The gift is your life, sweet dinosaur.

1955
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:14,370
The obligation...

1956
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:15,290
This other thing?

1957
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:15,870
Is this.

1958
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,850
You hold one of Mantarok's hearts.

1959
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:19,370
Oh.

1960
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,230
The essence of a corpse god.

1961
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:21,930
Ew.

1962
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,310
The sum that is a source of great power.

1963
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,870
From those people, you must invent it.

1964
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:28,810
I didn't ask for this.

1965
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:30,950
You must use it to destroy it with little brightness.

1966
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:32,630
I promise your world has left anything.

1967
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:33,270
It looks gross.

1968
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,150
It looks...

1969
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:35,990
Guard it well.

1970
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:37,970
Oh, God!

1971
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,330
This is gonna humble off!

1972
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:44,910
Wait!

1973
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:45,130
Help!

1974
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,200
Excuse me, sir!

1975
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,060
Where did you go?

1976
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:03,420
The metal staff is held in the arms of the statue.

1977
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,200
So, can we switch weapons?

1978
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,360
Is that what's going on?

1979
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:07,920
Or...

1980
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,380
Or rather like...

1981
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,380
If I wanted to keep one...

1982
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:11,880
Oh, my God.

1983
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,400
If I wanted to keep one weapon, could I or do I have to switch?

1984
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:16,880
Wow!

1985
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,040
We can look at him!

1986
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,680
Metal staff...

1987
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,280
Stop!

1988
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,040
You guys are more brain-rotted than me!

1989
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:29,720
Ew...

1990
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,420
The inside is like...

1991
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,180
Hot breath.

1992
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:35,560
What is this?

1993
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:37,900
What is this?

1994
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,400
We gotta add a new emote before we get gross.

1995
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,920
Maybe we do need a disgust emote, do we?

1996
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:48,820
Okay.

1997
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:49,220
Okay.

1998
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:49,580
Okay.

1999
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:49,980
Okay.

2000
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:50,640
Okay.

2001
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:50,960
I'm going.

2002
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,340
I'm going.

2003
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:53,700
Okay.

2004
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,000
Okay.

2005
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:54,840
I'm going.

2006
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,200
I'm going.

2007
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:55,500
I'm going.

2008
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:56,660
What's over here?

2009
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:58,660
Oh, I can look at him.

2010
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:01,120
I'm frozen.

2011
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,560
I look like...

2012
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,400
They just took a picture of...

2013
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,220
Like...

2014
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,020
Bigfoot?

2015
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,120
What?

2016
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,380
I like orange as much as I like this game.

2017
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,860
Thanks, Rude.

2018
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,080
I hope you like it too.

2019
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,680
It was one of my favorites to get through all the endings.

2020
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,200
Yeah, I am curious about that.

2021
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,980
Not quite sure how I want to approach that yet.

2022
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,280
A statue of a human female bears witness to the monstrosity that fills the room.

2023
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:36,000
The porous stone of its body is covered with the effluvio grime that messes with it.

2024
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,980
The manta rock has secreted over the years.

2025
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:38,980
Oh.

2026
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,580
I know there's probably going to be someone that's like, It should have been me.

2027
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,360
Oh, yeah.

2028
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,300
I want your...

2029
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,380
nasty stone.

2030
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,700
Or nasty...

2031
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,800
whatever all over me.

2032
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,640
It should have been me.

2033
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,500
What's over here?

2034
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:01,760
Same thing?

2035
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,340
Oh, yeah.

2036
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,080
Give me your effluvio grime.

2037
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,940
We should bring that kind of language back.

2038
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,580
I don't even know what effluvio means.

2039
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:16,660
But I just know some sicko out there is just like, It should have been me.

2040
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,540
It should have been me.

2041
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:24,260
Sakuna!

2042
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,070
Effluvio grime, baby.

2043
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:34,690
A door of formidable size seals the vault.

2044
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:39,090
A stylized design resembling the creature that dwells within the room.

2045
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:42,350
What do you mean the creature that dwells within the room?

2046
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,510
It's carved into the stone.

2047
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,850
What do you mean by that?

2048
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:46,830
Like, oh, this room?

2049
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,230
Can I use the staff?

2050
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:52,310
No.

2051
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,790
What do I do here now?

2052
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,010
Means this guy.

2053
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:57,410
Okay.

2054
01:30:58,450 --> 01:30:59,570
Wasn't sure if it meant...

2055
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:01,030
Oh, that just looks like the sun up there.

2056
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,350
Okay.

2057
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,950
Am I going back?

2058
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,170
Okay.

2059
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:16,350
Time to leave.

2060
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:17,770
With my staff.

2061
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,090
Does the staff...

2062
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:20,590
Oh, shoot!

2063
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,170
No, no, no!

2064
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:24,050
Wait, I...

2065
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,710
Oh, I can't equip it.

2066
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:28,450
It's not a weapon.

2067
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:30,990
Basically means stinky.

2068
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:34,710
Effluvio.

2069
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:35,650
Effluvio.

2070
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:40,830
Let's have no booby traps.

2071
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:46,700
Oh, shoot!

2072
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:47,300
Oh, my God!

2073
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:47,720
Where am I?

2074
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:48,260
Oh, my God!

2075
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:48,600
Oh, my God!

2076
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,860
Oh, my God!

2077
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,200
Oh, my God!

2078
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:49,640
Oh, my God!

2079
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:49,920
Oh, my God!

2080
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,580
Just run.

2081
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,260
Just getting out of here.

2082
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,020
Bye!

2083
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,480
What's with the music?

2084
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:06,980
What's with the music?

2085
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,260
Are there guys in here?

2086
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,240
Please, say no.

2087
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,420
They are going to step on something.

2088
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,060
They are going to really mess something up for me.

2089
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,860
I can't tell.

2090
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,180
Oh boy, the Dutch angle.

2091
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:32,460
Wait!

2092
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,340
Oh dang it.

2093
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,760
I thought I could walk through it.

2094
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,220
Oh my god.

2095
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:40,800
Oh shoot, they noticed me.

2096
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,860
Do you think they are getting attacked?

2097
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,900
Or do you think they are getting sliced and diced by this thing?

2098
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,520
Oh god, they are starting... Oh my god.

2099
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:00,000
What's going on?

2100
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,140
What's happening?

2101
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:11,220
I think I hear them still walking around.

2102
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,980
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2103
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,660
Everything is happening.

2104
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,980
I think I just have to go through it.

2105
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:39,920
Oh my god.

2106
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2107
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,900
Oh my god.

2108
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,360
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2109
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,100
Oh my god, oh my god.

2110
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,180
My feet.

2111
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,460
My everything.

2112
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,440
Okay, I guess the guys died.

2113
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,040
Which is great for us.

2114
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:00,620
I think.

2115
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:00,880
Oh.

2116
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,600
Well, it would be great.

2117
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,680
This looks like you could go around it, doesn't it?

2118
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,920
Doesn't this look like you could avoid it somehow like this?

2119
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:16,080
Who's talking?

2120
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:17,860
Hello?

2121
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:18,660
Me?

2122
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:20,640
I'm looking pretty.

2123
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,220
I don't care about you guys.

2124
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,980
Okay, I'm just going to run for it then.

2125
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,520
I'm scared though.

2126
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,520
Accidentally.

2127
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,160
Okay.

2128
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:33,140
Setting off a trap is what I was going to say.

2129
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,340
Oh shoot, oh shoot.

2130
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,500
Oh my gosh.

2131
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:45,210
Did I get hurt?

2132
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:46,710
Where am I supposed to go?

2133
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,410
Am I just backtracking all the way?

2134
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:50,090
There's no way.

2135
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,130
I have to backtrack so far.

2136
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,970
I'm just running through things though.

2137
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:54,750
Ah.

2138
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,690
Oh my sanity.

2139
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:57,750
Oh my god.

2140
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,390
Oh my god.

2141
01:34:59,430 --> 01:34:59,790
Oh my god.

2142
01:34:59,810 --> 01:34:59,950
No.

2143
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:01,230
Oh my sanity is so low.

2144
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:01,650
That's why.

2145
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:03,170
Oh shoot.

2146
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,740
Step over the pressure plates.

2147
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,800
Yeah, you know.

2148
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:13,960
That would be great.

2149
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,540
Oh shoot.

2150
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,100
Oh shoot.

2151
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:18,440
Oh.

2152
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:18,880
Okay.

2153
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,120
Yeah, we have to kill to regain sanity.

2154
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:21,560
You're right.

2155
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,180
Oh my gosh.

2156
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,020
If I could find a guy to kill.

2157
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:28,220
What's going on?

2158
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,260
What am I looking at?

2159
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:30,600
Hello?

2160
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:31,080
Oh.

2161
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:32,560
Oh, this is my...

2162
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:33,960
My sword.

2163
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:37,480
What's going on?

2164
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,740
This is where the guy was.

2165
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,000
Maybe he was part of my low sanity.

2166
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,280
She looked right at...

2167
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,260
She's looking at me.

2168
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,520
It's kind of freaky.

2169
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,580
I wish I could get my sword.

2170
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,640
Oh, I can pick it up.

2171
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,180
Can I fix it somewhere?

2172
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,100
Shut up.

2173
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:58,200
Shut up.

2174
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,800
It is completely useless.

2175
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,360
You could have fixed it if you save the guy.

2176
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,520
No way!

2177
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:14,360
Oh man.

2178
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,100
Okay.

2179
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:16,720
All right.

2180
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,640
If anybody wants to backseat on where I need to go, that'd be great.

2181
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,440
I think we're going to have to go kill some guys in here.

2182
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,180
Oh shoot.

2183
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:41,700
Run, run, run.

2184
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,880
Oh, shoot.

2185
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,140
Just poison them.

2186
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,600
Poison each guy.

2187
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,300
Poison each guy.

2188
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:54,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2189
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,540
Poison them.

2190
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:55,940
Poison them.

2191
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,200
Oh, he's down.

2192
01:36:59,260 --> 01:36:59,600
He's down.

2193
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:00,820
Finish him!

2194
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,180
Finish him!

2195
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,660
Get him!

2196
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:06,950
Hey, hey!

2197
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:08,750
I was trying to do a move here, okay?

2198
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:09,910
God!

2199
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:11,130
No!

2200
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,570
You're ruining my show!

2201
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:19,970
You're ruining my... You're ruining it for me!

2202
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:22,110
Oh my God.

2203
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:22,870
Please leave.

2204
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:23,410
Please.

2205
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:24,030
Oh, please.

2206
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:25,050
Oh, stop hugging me.

2207
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:26,550
Please stop hugging me.

2208
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:28,630
It's icky and gross.

2209
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:32,690
Finish him!

2210
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:34,550
There we go.

2211
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:35,070
There's one.

2212
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:36,930
There's two.

2213
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,130
And let's get this guy.

2214
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:43,550
Oh my God.

2215
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:46,490
We're gonna have to heal though.

2216
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:54,170
Maybe I should heal again.

2217
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:55,450
Just in case.

2218
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:00,970
It doesn't give you so much health.

2219
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:01,510
That's okay.

2220
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:02,370
Alrighty.

2221
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,350
Okay.

2222
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:06,490
Sanity up.

2223
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:07,590
Oh, here we go.

2224
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:08,130
That's right.

2225
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:09,630
I forgot about this.

2226
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:10,770
What the... Okay, perfect.

2227
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:14,030
The metal staff!

2228
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,250
We did it!

2229
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:17,930
I forgot about here!

2230
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:23,050
He probably wasn't real anyway.

2231
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,110
Oh, I have to go all the way back.

2232
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:27,030
Okay, this is fine.

2233
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,330
This is fine.

2234
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,630
It was this way, right?

2235
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:38,610
Yeah.

2236
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:46,470
Girl has... girl does not care.

2237
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:50,250
Girl has zero cares ever.

2238
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:54,330
I love chanting.

2239
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,490
Oh my gosh.

2240
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,830
Oh, shoot.

2241
01:38:58,090 --> 01:38:58,970
My toes.

2242
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:01,850
I can't see.

2243
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,350
Ouch!

2244
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:03,630
Ouch!

2245
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:03,910
Ouch!

2246
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:04,130
Ouch!

2247
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:04,350
Ouch!

2248
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:04,510
Ouch!

2249
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:04,690
Ouch!

2250
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,430
Please.

2251
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:06,470
Oh my gosh.

2252
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:12,670
Oh my gosh.

2253
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:12,690
Oh my gosh.

2254
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:18,130
This is so bad.

2255
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:21,870
This is so bad.

2256
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:22,790
Alright.

2257
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:23,450
Here we go.

2258
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:23,750
Here we go.

2259
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:26,610
Run!

2260
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:27,390
Just run!

2261
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:28,730
Ouchie ouch!

2262
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:29,570
Just run!

2263
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:32,850
Oh, shoot.

2264
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,190
I forgot about these guys over here.

2265
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:35,850
Bye!

2266
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:35,970
Bye!

2267
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:44,230
What?

2268
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:44,890
What are you saying?

2269
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:46,630
Was that me?

2270
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,530
Who did that?

2271
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:49,670
Just go.

2272
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,190
Just get out of here.

2273
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:54,490
Everything's shaking.

2274
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:54,810
Yeah.

2275
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:03,160
Okay.

2276
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,380
That's okay.

2277
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,340
Catch your breath in here.

2278
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,980
I think it's safe.

2279
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,040
It's probably safe.

2280
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,840
It's fine.

2281
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:15,760
She's going to Lulu?

2282
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,300
Me too!

2283
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,340
Oh!

2284
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:18,200
Oh!

2285
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,540
Yeah, I agree.

2286
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:21,520
Instead you will die.

2287
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,220
Where is the essence of Mantarok?

2288
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,800
Um, in my tummy.

2289
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,840
Uh-oh.

2290
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:31,300
Uh-oh.

2291
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,200
They're coming at me slowly.

2292
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,060
Oh, they're being really gentle with me actually.

2293
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,440
Where is it?

2294
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:41,260
I will not ask again, child.

2295
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,160
It's in my tummy.

2296
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,100
Very well then.

2297
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,480
You will succumb to the horrors of oblivion.

2298
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,000
No!

2299
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:51,640
No!

2300
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,540
Chapter Cup.

2301
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:18,820
Whoa!

2302
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:23,660
Freaky!

2303
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:27,680
Oh.

2304
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,360
How did they...

2305
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,260
A small shrine of candles.

2306
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:38,720
Their placement appears to be very deliberate, corresponding to the etchings on the table and an illustration upon the wall.

2307
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,380
Some of the candles have been lit!

2308
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,500
Oh, now which ones do I extinguish?

2309
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,020
That was the end of her chapter, alright.

2310
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:58,060
What the hell is going on in this game?

2311
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,820
What is going on in this game?

2312
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,520
I still have the broken key.

2313
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:06,700
Thank you!

2314
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:06,960
Thank you!

2315
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:07,560
Chu!

2316
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:08,640
Chu!

2317
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:13,320
What if Alex's grandpa just did that and he died of natural causes?

2318
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:14,640
Yeah.

2319
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:15,760
The beheading?

2320
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:16,660
Totally natural.

2321
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:22,290
Is there... Hold on.

2322
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:23,830
Oh, I see it!

2323
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,070
I see the sun up top.

2324
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:28,750
So maybe just... those... Oh, I see it.

2325
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:29,050
I see it.

2326
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:29,690
Okay, I see it.

2327
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:30,990
I was like looking for it.

2328
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,630
Okay, so this one and this one.

2329
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,550
There we go.

2330
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:44,170
With the correct sequence of candles being lit, a hidden panel opens.

2331
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:46,370
There is a message tube inside.

2332
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:49,130
His head just did that.

2333
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:53,470
We got the message tube!

2334
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:56,770
Okay, interesting.

2335
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,510
This game is originally for the N64.

2336
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:04,190
The game was so unplayable that Nintendo needed to save it.

2337
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:07,470
There used to be a knight and military soldier section that got cut.

2338
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:08,970
There's footage of... Oh my god, seriously?

2339
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,900
An antique leather-bound message tube.

2340
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,680
The kind used to transport sealed message squares.

2341
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,380
It appears to be unopened.

2342
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:21,640
There might be something inside.

2343
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:23,440
Yes, open it!

2344
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:26,360
Suspicions of conspiracy!

2345
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:29,900
Let's go!

2346
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:33,720
Oh.

2347
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,000
What?

2348
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:47,170
Pius Augustus!

2349
01:43:58,110 --> 01:44:00,270
Let's go.

2350
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:01,830
Let's go!

2351
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,130
Come on!

2352
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:02,190
Oh, no.

2353
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:02,950
Why is he so cute?

2354
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:09,190
I was just thinking that, I was thinking that, he would be...

2355
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:09,730
Look at his face!

2356
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:10,470
He's so beautiful.

2357
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:10,570
He has a beautiful mouth.

2358
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:11,030
Oh, he's so cute.

2359
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,730
Oh, my God.

2360
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:34,650
Average day for Rhoda Mellon.

2361
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:49,870
Oh, Charlemagne the Frank!

2362
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:51,850
Oh, Charlemagne the Frank!

2363
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:11,730
I like how, like, she just keeps breaking apart.

2364
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:20,470
You're insane.

2365
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:24,610
Or perhaps one and the other?

2366
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:27,870
Just make sure he is removed from power.

2367
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:28,650
Of course.

2368
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:31,470
He is as good as dead.

2369
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:32,630
Okay.

2370
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:33,810
Why?

2371
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:34,470
Why?

2372
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:36,550
Why is it going on?

2373
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:39,810
Why is it going on?

2374
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:43,650
After the chapter page is removed, the message tube is no longer needed.

2375
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:44,870
Alex discards it.

2376
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:48,710
So... Oh, here's our chapter page.

2377
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,190
Suspicions of conspiracy.

2378
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,030
But...

2379
01:45:54,030 --> 01:46:00,710
Before we do that, I've noticed also our sanity meter is going down, it seems a little bit.

2380
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:06,730
We still have some stuff in here.

2381
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,310
I guess we still can't do it though.

2382
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:11,370
Like the...

2383
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,450
Where's the meter?

2384
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:15,830
Is that not it right there?

2385
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:17,880
The little... bubble?

2386
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:18,780
Bubbly?

2387
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,560
The bubbly?

2388
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:23,260
It was here, right?

2389
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:28,540
Equip the Gladius?

2390
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:28,980
Can I?

2391
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:30,920
Oh, I can!

2392
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:32,860
Let's go.

2393
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,540
Wait, why did you tell me to do that?

2394
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,520
There's not gonna be dead guys in here, are there?

2395
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,500
I sure hope not.

2396
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,140
What's this thing?

2397
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,140
Hmm... Hmm... This looks like it's suspiciously...

2398
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:49,600
Interesting area.

2399
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,020
That door sound...

2400
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,320
Sounds...

2401
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,700
So... old.

2402
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:00,220
Yeah, we have to fix the key.

2403
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,540
And we need to use the dresser key.

2404
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:09,020
Hey, why is the book blinking at us over there?

2405
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,420
Why is there an eyeball?

2406
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,700
I just noticed it.

2407
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:13,960
Um, hello?

2408
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:14,940
Excuse me?

2409
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:18,560
Why are we opening our eyes?

2410
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:21,240
Why is everybody asleep and you are...

2411
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:22,620
You're wired?

2412
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:23,540
You're like...

2413
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:24,040
You're like...

2414
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,480
Blink back at it?

2415
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,360
Goodness, I'm sleepy.

2416
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:40,680
Oh, let's do the suspicions of conspiracy, I suppose.

2417
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,940
From my research, it is apparent that the endeavors of mankind...

2418
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:50,280
are mere puppetry at the hands of the ancients.

2419
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,400
Hmm...

2420
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:57,100
Whenever a king vows reform, the ancients move quickly to stifle it.

2421
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:03,420
Under the auspices of Emperor Charlemagne the Frank, the new Holy Roman Empire...

2422
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:03,680
814.

2423
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:05,620
...was at the height of its power.

2424
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:08,720
France.

2425
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,240
Assassin's Creed.

2426
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:12,360
...

2427
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:15,920
What is this?

2428
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,760
Conchmit Ademinum et imperatorum nostrum.

2429
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:20,700
Caralume magnum franquem.

2430
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,900
Deliver this to our lord and emperor Charlemagne the Frank...

2431
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,380
Ohoho, we're smarter!

2432
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,480
No one but him must see it.

2433
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,500
There are words for his eyes only.

2434
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,620
Okay, what is this lighting?

2435
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:37,930
Why does that background look like a...

2436
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:40,850
like a Looney Tunes painted background?

2437
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:43,590
This guy is just...

2438
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:44,570
That guy's looking real smart.

2439
01:48:44,570 --> 01:48:44,790
Oh!

2440
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:45,550
You're reading it!

2441
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:46,090
You're reading it!

2442
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:46,630
You're reading it!

2443
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,010
Uh-oh.

2444
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:56,990
I am bewitched!

2445
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,490
Uh-oh.

2446
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:03,490
Uh -oh!

2447
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,270
Into the Looney Tunes!

2448
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:14,670
A little hunchback of Notre Dame hours here.

2449
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:20,910
They have come from Looney Tune Land!

2450
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,910
I must speak!

2451
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:31,990
After Anthony briefly describes his mission, the monk informs him that Charlemagne was last seen in audience with the bishop in the visiting chamber.

2452
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,190
What about you?

2453
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:38,510
Anthony's presence is questioned by the monks, feeling that he has trespassed upon sacred ground.

2454
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:44,250
The monk seems rather subdued, perhaps out of respect, or perhaps out of fear.

2455
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:45,610
Um, is this not a church?

2456
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,170
Can't everybody come here?

2457
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,490
I'm here to pray.

2458
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:49,510
I am a holy man.

2459
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:56,250
Visibly disturbed with grief and despair, the monk sobs...

2460
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:56,290
Oh.

2461
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:57,390
It's a funeral.

2462
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:04,270
You're just a guy.

2463
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:20,390
He recounts that this is not the only death to have occurred recently, and wonders if perhaps the order is being punished for a wavering in faith.

2464
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,180
The monk cordially greets Anthony.

2465
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,980
However, he brings grave news of the loss of one of his order, who fell from the tower to...

2466
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:33,680
Wait, wait, wait.

2467
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:35,460
Sorry.

2468
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,760
He just fell?

2469
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:43,900
Oh, man.

2470
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:47,620
Sorry.

2471
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,320
Sorry, mister.

2472
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:51,320
I thought... I don't know.

2473
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:55,320
I didn't... I just expected something else, not like...

2474
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:56,500
Ah, he tripped.

2475
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:57,220
And he fell.

2476
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:01,520
His tone is guarded, leaving Anthony wondering if indeed this is the truth.

2477
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:01,820
Oh.

2478
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,380
I can't open the casket!

2479
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,660
A funeral casket made from unfinished wood.

2480
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,280
It is not properly sealed and could probably be open.

2481
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,620
Should Anthony open the casket?

2482
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,020
No, but yes.

2483
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,640
Oh, my God!

2484
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:21,700
Oh, my God.

2485
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,320
What is he up to?

2486
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,140
This is devil's work.

2487
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:25,740
We should get out of here.

2488
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,860
Why is everybody saying that about...

2489
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,840
We have proven what we have feared the most.

2490
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:30,120
Wait.

2491
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,820
This poor man has been the victim of...

2492
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:33,780
...great evil.

2493
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:34,520
Uh-oh.

2494
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:37,020
Look how his body has been defiled.

2495
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,660
As if something has...

2496
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:40,840
...burst out from inside him.

2497
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:41,860
Here.

2498
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,700
Take this for your protection.

2499
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,880
Did they not even look at him?

2500
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:45,640
And find the bishop.

2501
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,760
He must be informed of this horrible discovery.

2502
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,480
Did they not even...

2503
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,720
I got this...

2504
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:55,040
...scrum-a-sacks.

2505
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,660
Scrum-a-sacks?

2506
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,060
Scrum-a-sacks?

2507
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,360
Scrum-a-sacks?

2508
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,140
Scrum -a-sacks?

2509
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:02,680
Scrum-a-sacks?

2510
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,260
It has like a xenomorph.

2511
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:12,050
What do you expect me to do?

2512
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:12,730
I'm just a guy.

2513
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:15,850
Oh, no.

2514
01:52:15,930 --> 01:52:17,330
I didn't get to finish talking to them.

2515
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:21,810
Oh, buddy.

2516
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:23,270
That a rough.

2517
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,170
Peering inside the casket...

2518
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:26,910
...Anthony sees the body of a monk.

2519
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,510
His raiment...

2520
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:31,110
Raiment is that of his order.

2521
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:32,490
Stained with blood...

2522
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:33,490
...that has seeped...

2523
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:34,670
...from many grievous wounds.

2524
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:36,730
It is a truly disturbing sight.

2525
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:41,450
Anthony is voiced by Liquid Sna- Cam Clark!

2526
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:44,810
And you're in a monastery...

2527
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:45,610
...surrounded by monks.

2528
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:46,990
Which means you have an excuse...

2529
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:47,770
...to call them all brother.

2530
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:51,390
Not a great track record...

2531
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,690
...for these playable characters so far.

2532
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:53,550
Do your best, Tony.

2533
01:52:55,610 --> 01:52:56,130
Raiment.

2534
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,830
Raiment.

2535
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:02,250
Raiden.

2536
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:06,190
I should have quit my...

2537
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:06,790
...my...

2538
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:07,610
...scra...

2539
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:09,450
What is this?

2540
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:10,030
Message...

2541
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:10,130
Oh.

2542
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:13,050
Message scrolls like this...

2543
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:14,950
...were often used to transfer messages securely.

2544
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:17,210
This one has a strange diagram on it...

2545
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,910
...consisting of a pentagonal shape...

2546
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:20,730
...with strange letters at each corner.

2547
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:22,430
Oh.

2548
01:53:25,150 --> 01:53:25,670
When...

2549
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,410
...Anthony had opened the scroll...

2550
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:28,350
...something strange happened.

2551
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:29,690
Something had been intended...

2552
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:30,770
...for the Emperor Charlemagne.

2553
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:32,550
Suspecting a plot against the Emperor...

2554
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:34,830
...Anthony pledged that he...

2555
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:36,830
...would warn Charlemagne at all costs.

2556
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:38,530
Also natural causes.

2557
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:39,230
Yeah, yeah.

2558
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:40,510
Okay.

2559
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:40,850
Oh.

2560
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:42,110
This is all connected.

2561
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:44,030
I thought I was going down a hallway.

2562
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:48,050
He's not gonna get out of that...

2563
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:48,590
...thing, right?

2564
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:49,330
Oh.

2565
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:49,850
What's over here?

2566
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:55,930
Muffled voices emanate...

2567
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:56,830
...from inside the Bishop's...

2568
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:57,390
...visiting chamber.

2569
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:58,950
However, the door is locked...

2570
01:53:58,950 --> 01:53:59,650
...and Anthony will need...

2571
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:00,770
...the Bishop's key to enter...

2572
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,910
...and gain an audience with...

2573
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:02,250
...the Emperor Charlemagne.

2574
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:02,590
Oh, you could...

2575
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:03,650
...the monks could not...

2576
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:04,190
...give this to me?

2577
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:05,630
They knew that...

2578
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,550
...they were like...

2579
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:07,750
...oh, yeah, yeah...

2580
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:08,650
...you really need to talk...

2581
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:09,070
...to that guy.

2582
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:10,150
Good luck.

2583
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:11,870
By the way, good luck.

2584
01:54:13,850 --> 01:54:14,770
Yeah, just knock.

2585
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:18,110
Come on, Anthony.

2586
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:18,890
Use your hands.

2587
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,390
Three minty months.

2588
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:24,070
Thank you!

2589
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:27,110
Charlemagne, do you like...

2590
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,010
...my sunglasses?

2591
01:54:30,090 --> 01:54:30,830
Anthony cannot...

2592
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:31,170
...leave yet.

2593
01:54:31,210 --> 01:54:31,870
Charlemagne must be...

2594
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:31,890
Charlemagne must be...

2595
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:32,970
...warned of the conspiracy...

2596
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:33,730
...against him.

2597
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:35,750
And also, like...

2598
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:37,090
...everything that's going on...

2599
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:37,710
...is kind of crazy.

2600
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:39,230
What are you looking at, Anthony?

2601
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:41,550
He's just really...

2602
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:42,290
...powering through...

2603
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:42,710
...these stairs.

2604
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:45,510
Oh!

2605
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:49,830
Anthony, how did you get here?

2606
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:52,830
Anthony!

2607
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:54,730
What did you do?

2608
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:58,190
Anthony!

2609
01:54:58,450 --> 01:54:59,490
Where are we?

2610
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:00,970
Anthony!

2611
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:01,390
Anthony!

2612
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:01,870
Anthony!

2613
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:09,710
Oh, my God!

2614
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:10,870
They're screaming on the ground!

2615
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:12,750
Wow!

2616
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:15,030
Oh, my gosh!

2617
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:15,890
That's so cool!

2618
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:18,750
Step, stepy, step, step, step.

2619
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:20,510
Step, stepy, step, step, step.

2620
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:21,930
It's the tome.

2621
01:55:23,470 --> 01:55:26,970
Cradled in what appears to be a leathery hand lies a mysterious book.

2622
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:31,150
It is bound in human skin and intricately decorated with shrunken bones.

2623
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:32,550
It beckons...

2624
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:33,090
Shut up!

2625
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:34,230
Shut up!

2626
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:34,670
Oh, my God!

2627
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:36,370
It beckons and yearns to be possessed.

2628
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:40,810
Should Anthony claim the Tome of Eternal Darkness?

2629
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:42,490
Uh, sure.

2630
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:46,150
Anthony has acquired the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

2631
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:54,230
Anthony is not the same as before.

2632
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,590
Can Anthony keep going up here?

2633
01:55:58,490 --> 01:55:59,150
Uh-oh.

2634
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:00,450
Oh!

2635
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:01,050
Oof!

2636
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:01,250
Ouch!

2637
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:01,530
Ouch!

2638
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:05,030
What?

2639
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:06,310
What?

2640
01:56:06,590 --> 01:56:07,170
What?

2641
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:08,650
Oh, my God!

2642
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:10,050
I'm not Anthony anymore.

2643
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:11,730
Liquid Anthony!

2644
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:15,930
The sound of chat was meant to do this...

2645
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:17,330
Stop!

2646
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:20,990
What's this?

2647
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:24,750
A blue urn.

2648
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:26,050
I'll take that.

2649
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:27,610
I'm taking everything.

2650
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:28,710
Honestly.

2651
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,210
Anthony, you don't look so good.

2652
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:32,530
I'm gonna be honest, buddy.

2653
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:37,170
Oh, a mysterious gold medallion rests on the ground.

2654
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:37,850
It rests upon the desk.

2655
01:56:38,330 --> 01:56:39,550
I'm gonna take that, too.

2656
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:40,410
Oh.

2657
01:56:42,190 --> 01:56:42,890
Maybe not.

2658
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,200
Oh!

2659
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:48,920
He acquired a circle of power!

2660
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,000
Anthony, are you okay?

2661
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:51,300
Oh!

2662
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:52,780
No way.

2663
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,700
Describe the amount of power that a spell will have.

2664
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,600
The more points within that circle, the stronger the spell will be.

2665
01:56:58,920 --> 01:56:59,880
Do we have spells now?

2666
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,700
Spells are magical?

2667
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,540
Why is it spelled with a K?

2668
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,640
Magical incantations that enhance a character's natural ability.

2669
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:14,400
The spell list is an inventory of all the spell information that has been acquired.

2670
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:21,040
It will allow the player to select which spells to cast, examine, or assign to convenient quick spell buttons.

2671
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,600
New spell...

2672
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,160
Oh my gosh.

2673
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:29,960
Selecting this will allow the player to experiment with rune combinations and discover new spells.

2674
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,340
Paragon.

2675
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,100
Is that a spell you learn?

2676
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:38,460
It's not real magic.

2677
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:38,620
It's magic.

2678
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:38,900
It's magical.

2679
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:46,580
This section is an inventory of all the components of magical spells you have acquired.

2680
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:53,600
With this function, the player can review their current assignment of spells to the quick spell buttons.

2681
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,560
Okay.

2682
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:56,500
I can...

2683
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:56,960
I'm a...

2684
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,660
I'm a wizard.

2685
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:00,320
Anthony, you're a wizard!

2686
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:03,540
You're a wizard, Anthony.

2687
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:05,620
What's in here?

2688
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,440
Oh my god, Anthony.

2689
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,160
You are...

2690
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,200
You are a real jump scare.

2691
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,280
Oh my god.

2692
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:14,320
Amongst the tomes and manuscripts, a book brings attention to itself.

2693
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,660
Oddly pristine on the dusty shelf, it doesn't quite belong.

2694
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,040
Yeah, take the book, Anthony.

2695
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:25,600
Amongst us?

2696
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,700
A bewildering array of books and tomes sorted neatly on a set of shelves.

2697
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,720
Mostly books of a religious nature.

2698
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,360
They sit beneath a...

2699
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,560
A skein?

2700
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,360
A skein of dust.

2701
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,780
As if no one has touched them.

2702
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,020
Oh, sorry.

2703
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:46,960
There we go.

2704
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,100
Yo, Charlemagne.

2705
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:54,420
I'm...

2706
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:55,220
I can do...

2707
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:57,220
I can cast spells now.

2708
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:57,860
Somehow.

2709
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,000
I'm actually not quite sure how.

2710
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,200
Excuse me!

2711
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,800
Is that...

2712
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,840
Is this that Moe...

2713
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:08,420
Moe magic?

2714
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:08,620
Is that...

2715
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:10,640
Moe magic to make Eternal Screams taste better?

2716
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,040
Yes.

2717
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,780
Wait, where'd my spell go?

2718
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:14,560
New spell.

2719
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:17,660
Anthony does not have enough components to attempt to research spells.

2720
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:19,820
He can't even attempt to re...

2721
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:21,740
Anthony is not smart.

2722
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,680
Anthony can't even attempt to do anything.

2723
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,180
Anthony, you need to take a...

2724
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:26,660
Anthony.

2725
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,880
You need to know your place, Anthony.

2726
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,100
My god.

2727
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:32,780
I only have circle runes.

2728
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:33,460
I know nothing.

2729
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:37,160
Level zero, mage.

2730
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:39,460
Alrighty.

2731
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,220
Climb down.

2732
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,540
You guys, I'm gonna be honest.

2733
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:58,520
I'm kind of nervous about continuing on without saving.

2734
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,560
So I might actually cut today a little short.

2735
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:05,740
Because...

2736
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:09,540
If something happens and I have to play all the way back to this part...

2737
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:11,540
Before stream...

2738
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:16,260
I don't want to have to go through so much.

2739
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:16,940
You know what I mean?

2740
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,160
Honest.

2741
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:19,120
Please be honest.

2742
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,480
So I might actually cut today kind of short.

2743
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:25,160
And then next time...

2744
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:27,920
Go pretty long.

2745
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,620
This game is so wacky but I'm having so much fun with it.

2746
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:34,800
Already.

2747
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:35,240
I know.

2748
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:35,820
It's so...

2749
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:37,360
It's such a short stream today.

2750
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,440
But I'm gonna...

2751
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,160
Find out what I can do.

2752
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:48,780
I think I have a memory card somewhere.

2753
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:49,800
I just have to...

2754
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:51,140
Get it.

2755
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:52,340
I just have to...

2756
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:54,100
Find it.

2757
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:54,560
Wherever.

2758
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:55,400
Wherever.

2759
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:56,540
But...

2760
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:57,620
Yeah.

2761
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,300
So next week we will continue it.

2762
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:02,180
And...

2763
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:03,260
Yeah.

2764
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:04,720
But it was good to...

2765
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:04,780
To...

2766
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:05,220
Kind of...

2767
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:08,020
I don't even know if I can say get a feel of this game.

2768
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:09,200
Because I don't even know...

2769
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:10,940
What the hell is going on.

2770
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,320
I don't even know...

2771
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:16,680
What is happening.

2772
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:17,920
But it's...

2773
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:19,140
Fascinating.

2774
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:19,780
I will...

2775
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:20,480
I will...

2776
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:21,080
It's still...

2777
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,040
You're still pretty early on.

2778
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:22,380
Oh yeah.

2779
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,480
We're barely...

2780
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,820
We're barely in.

2781
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:26,520
So...

2782
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:27,940
Just a taste.

2783
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,760
You've just entered the game proper IMO.

2784
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:31,920
Mmm...

2785
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:34,640
It's definitely interesting.

2786
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:35,860
Thanks for the stream.

2787
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:36,380
I can't wait.

2788
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:36,740
Yeah.

2789
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,640
I'm really sorry.

2790
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:38,340
I will...

2791
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:39,720
I will do this.

2792
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:41,340
I will like Zatsu a little bit.

2793
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:43,200
I know.

2794
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,000
It's so short.

2795
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:45,240
Because I don't want to just...

2796
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,160
End the stream.

2797
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:48,140
Give me a second to...

2798
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:51,560
Change over...

2799
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:53,140
There

2800
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:01,380
we go.

2801
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:02,080
Okay.

2802
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,900
I think that'll stop the...

2803
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:04,800
Oh no.

2804
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,540
I can still hear it.

2805
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:08,600
Oh.

2806
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:09,080
There we go.

2807
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:09,760
Oh yeah.

2808
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:09,880
Oh my god.

2809
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:10,100
Wait.

2810
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,360
You guys can still even see it.

2811
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:12,220
That's crazy.

2812
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,420
I'm not gonna have it run for too long.

2813
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:16,980
We'll chat...

2814
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:17,480
We'll chat...

2815
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:19,140
Chat for a bit though.

2816
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:22,860
For a...

2817
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,440
Minto.

2818
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,340
Give me one second.

2819
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,220
I feel bad.

2820
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:39,800
I feel bad that I'm like playing the game for such a short amount of time but again, I'm just really nervous.

2821
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:51,760
If something happens and then I have to play back up to this point and then I'd be like I have to take all this time to play up to this point.

2822
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:53,440
Let's see.

2823
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:54,560
Let's put on some music.

2824
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:55,840
Let's put on...

2825
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:12,610
I hope you guys are liking it too even though it's like what the hell is going on.

2826
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:16,470
I've seen let's players lose the hours of progress.

2827
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:17,010
I know.

2828
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:19,790
And I'm just nervous about it.

2829
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:25,110
So it is an older game too so it's whack in a good way.

2830
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:25,610
Yeah.

2831
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:29,250
I was really exhausted from work this week but this stream really helped me to unwind.

2832
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:30,290
Oh, Hermakity.

2833
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:30,990
Thank you.

2834
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:33,230
Sorry I had such a bad week.

2835
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:33,990
Thank you.

2836
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:34,370
Thank you.

2837
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:34,970
Kiss.

2838
02:03:37,170 --> 02:03:37,650
So...

2839
02:03:37,650 --> 02:03:38,150
Bloop?

2840
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:40,790
No.

2841
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:41,290
No.

2842
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,710
No.

2843
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:43,350
We can do shorter days someday.

2844
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:43,870
Sometimes.

2845
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:48,670
But not maybe the best day to choose a shorter day.

2846
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:49,790
I just didn't realize that I was gonna choose a shorter day.

2847
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:54,510
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize the memory card.

2848
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:57,970
I can't believe we just got a demo of Mint's gameplay of Eternal Darkness.

2849
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:02,530
Oh my gosh, that reminds me of like when I would play...

2850
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:03,710
Oh my gosh.

2851
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:04,630
What was that game?

2852
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:07,910
There was one demo of a game I would play all the time.

2853
02:04:08,370 --> 02:04:09,990
Cause I didn't own the actual thing.

2854
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:11,370
It was a guy.

2855
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:15,150
It was a guy that was a Skull Man from the PlayStation 1.

2856
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:18,970
I can't have anything in Eternal Darkness world.

2857
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:20,750
What are you talking about, Anthony?

2858
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:25,590
Yes!

2859
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:26,150
MedEvil!

2860
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:31,970
Oh my gosh, I played the demo of MedEvil like a bajillion times.

2861
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:34,210
Never played the actual game.

2862
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:38,430
MedEvil!

2863
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:46,490
Wait, did I spell it wrong?

2864
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:48,030
Evil...

2865
02:04:49,670 --> 02:04:50,750
There it is.

2866
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:52,910
Oh, MedEvil.

2867
02:04:53,590 --> 02:04:54,850
Why is it spelled like that?

2868
02:04:55,230 --> 02:04:58,070
Have you ever thought about streaming TTRPGs?

2869
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:03,550
I don't know, I've never been like a TTRPG kind of ghost, so...

2870
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:07,470
I can't really say.

2871
02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:10,710
I've never played them so much before.

2872
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:11,910
Did I miss the gameplay?

2873
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,190
Yes, I'm sorry.

2874
02:05:13,190 --> 02:05:13,270
Sorry.

2875
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:16,670
Take care, Minto.

2876
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:17,210
Thank you!

2877
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:19,470
Thank you, thank you.

2878
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,830
Yeah, we're just hanging out for...

2879
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:23,390
a little bit before...

2880
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:24,750
I head out.

2881
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,630
Because I don't want to also keep my GameCube running.

2882
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:27,470
If I can help...

2883
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:28,890
For as long as I can help it, you know?

2884
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,610
This is the gameplay.

2885
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:37,110
Yeah, a bit of a shorter stream today.

2886
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:41,530
But yeah, I played MedEvil a ton.

2887
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:42,770
I think...

2888
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:45,330
I feel like if I name the...

2889
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:47,910
I only ever had one PlayStation...

2890
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:49,270
demo disc.

2891
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:52,470
I feel like if I name it, people will be able to find it so easily.

2892
02:05:52,610 --> 02:05:53,410
Because it was MedEvil.

2893
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:55,410
I don't remember if it was one or two.

2894
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:56,150
It might have been two.

2895
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:57,850
But it was MedEvil...

2896
02:05:58,730 --> 02:05:59,090
and...

2897
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:01,550
Emperor's New Groove.

2898
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:04,590
I played that one all the time too.

2899
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:06,590
Which it had like three levels.

2900
02:06:07,730 --> 02:06:08,450
It had...

2901
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:09,610
What did it have?

2902
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:10,230
It had...

2903
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:12,010
Like the village level.

2904
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:13,250
And then it had...

2905
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:15,030
The spider level.

2906
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:17,450
And then it had this roller coaster level.

2907
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:21,810
That's how often I played it.

2908
02:06:21,850 --> 02:06:22,710
That's how much I played it.

2909
02:06:22,750 --> 02:06:24,990
Because I can still remember everything.

2910
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,440
My favorite demo disc was the one with Spyro the Dragon on it.

2911
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:32,840
See, I never had Spyro 1.

2912
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,020
But I played Spyro 2.

2913
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:37,400
My first experience with MGS1 was a PS1 demo disc.

2914
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:39,340
I remember it had JP voices.

2915
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,080
No way!

2916
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:43,000
I never...

2917
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,460
You know, despite having a PlayStation 1.

2918
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:48,480
I never had played Metal Gear.

2919
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,300
Thanks for the stream, Mint!

2920
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:50,580
Yippee!

2921
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:50,960
Three months!

2922
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:51,980
Yippee!

2923
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:57,320
I had one with Tony Hawk.

2924
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:00,300
I think mine also had Tony Hawk.

2925
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:02,740
I had some sort of skateboarding game, I think.

2926
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,680
Do you have Fortnite Raiden skin?

2927
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:08,800
No!

2928
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,920
I have...

2929
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:11,300
Snake skin.

2930
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:13,540
I never got Raiden skin.

2931
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:17,360
I actually couldn't figure out how to get Raiden skin on Fortnite.

2932
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:20,320
I have Snake and I tried to get Old Snake.

2933
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:21,400
But it was too difficult.

2934
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:24,100
I wasn't...

2935
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:25,300
I wasn't gamer enough.

2936
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:28,020
Nah.

2937
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:30,180
Raiden was just one you buy.

2938
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:31,740
But it wasn't showing up in my store.

2939
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,560
Emulators of the older games.

2940
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:35,160
Yeah, yeah.

2941
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,000
True.

2942
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:40,620
I used to swap in and out of demo discs in my PS1.

2943
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:41,840
While the motor was still spinning.

2944
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:44,920
In order to import games.

2945
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:45,580
What?

2946
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:49,120
One day it shattered in my hand and forced me to find a better way.

2947
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:51,700
Was your hand okay?

2948
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,240
Was your PlayStation okay?

2949
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:56,380
What shattered?

2950
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:57,280
What are you talking about?

2951
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,240
I didn't even know you could do that.

2952
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,300
Wait, we're back in the day where games region locked?

2953
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:12,980
Like that?

2954
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:17,400
Cause...

2955
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:19,700
They were?

2956
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:20,940
No way!

2957
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:25,600
PS1 and PS2 were region locked.

2958
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:26,700
Seriously?

2959
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:29,760
What?

2960
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:33,380
Let's see.

2961
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,720
Nowadays, it's like...

2962
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:36,800
Getting...

2963
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,140
I think the last thing that I can think of that was region locked was like the 3DS.

2964
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:44,020
I can't...

2965
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:44,880
Think of...

2966
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:47,000
Unless I'm...

2967
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:47,980
Unless I'm just dumb.

2968
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:52,240
Could be PlayStation Magazine Demo Disc 44.

2969
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:53,620
Which also had MGS1.

2970
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:55,280
No way.

2971
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:55,900
Don't tell me that.

2972
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:56,120
Hold on.

2973
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:56,780
I'm gonna go look it up.

2974
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:01,760
PS Magazine Demo Disc 44.

2975
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:11,870
Wait.

2976
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:14,630
But the magazine looks familiar.

2977
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:15,730
Wait.

2978
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:16,150
Hold on.

2979
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,870
Don't tell me that I had Metal Gear this whole time.

2980
02:09:19,950 --> 02:09:20,290
No.

2981
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:22,910
No.

2982
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:25,010
Hold on.

2983
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:30,020
No.

2984
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,020
Hold on.

2985
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:32,280
No.

2986
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:32,740
No no no.

2987
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:34,160
No.

2988
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:34,660
No no no.

2989
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,280
This didn't...

2990
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:35,400
No!

2991
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:35,880
No no no.

2992
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:37,220
This isn't...

2993
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:39,460
No cause this doesn't even have Media Ball.

2994
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:50,060
Watch the Let's Play of Eternal Darkness over 11 years ago according to YouTube and forgot about it ever since.

2995
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:51,860
The weirdness is all coming back to me.

2996
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:52,340
So...

2997
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:52,600
Where is it?

2998
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:55,200
That's definitely... weird.

2999
02:09:55,900 --> 02:10:01,020
When I was like 10, my brother had my mom drive us an hour to buy Eternal Darkness from a GameStop that had it.

3000
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:02,500
It's really amazing to see you play.

3001
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:04,220
I've always wanted to see more of the game when I was a kid.

3002
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:05,280
Oh, awesome!

3003
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,280
Glad that we can be fulfilling these...

3004
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:12,480
childhood... these childhood dreams, right?

3005
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:15,400
It has medieval?

3006
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,740
Thank you, thank you.

3007
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,200
Wait, the magazine is showing... oh, wait.

3008
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:27,900
Wait, no, but it's showing me on the magazine.

3009
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:31,500
It's showing like Baldur's Gate and Ace Combat 4.

3010
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:36,900
I can't see what's on the disc.

3011
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:38,420
I can't tell.

3012
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:39,600
The disc is too small.

3013
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:40,620
The pictures are too small.

3014
02:10:41,980 --> 02:10:42,920
Wait a second, hold on.

3015
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:43,280
Oh, wait.

3016
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:45,240
Disney's Emperor New Groove?

3017
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,320
Ape Escape?

3018
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:49,960
Medieval 2?

3019
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,580
Metal Gear Solid?

3020
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,020
No, no, no.

3021
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,200
PlayStation?

3022
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:20,980
PlayStation demo disc.

3023
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:24,020
Emperor's New Groove.

3024
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,430
No, I found it!

3025
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,650
I found the one that I had!

3026
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:36,250
I found the one that I had!

3027
02:11:36,450 --> 02:11:36,870
Wait, hold on.

3028
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:39,110
It has...

3029
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:43,310
It wasn't... okay, I found it.

3030
02:11:43,370 --> 02:11:43,810
I found it.

3031
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:47,290
Because I... it was... hold on, I'll save the image.

3032
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:49,690
I found it.

3033
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:50,730
It doesn't have Metal Gear.

3034
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:53,950
I was like this... the... what's it called?

3035
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:55,130
The thing itself?

3036
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:58,570
Like the disc itself looked familiar, but I think because this was the disc.

3037
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:01,530
And it had...

3038
02:12:02,650 --> 02:12:03,810
Oh my gosh, it's so hard to read.

3039
02:12:05,230 --> 02:12:08,630
Yeah, it had Medieval 2 also on it, and the Emperor's New Groove.

3040
02:12:09,050 --> 02:12:11,870
Oh, I was pro BMX that I was thinking of.

3041
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:14,990
It was not... it was pro BMX.

3042
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:18,890
I knew it was like some sort of sports game... not sports, but you know, like...

3043
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:22,590
I was like, it's either... it's either...

3044
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:25,270
Skateboarding... Oh, it did have skateboarding!

3045
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:25,790
Grind Session!

3046
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:30,970
Yeah, this is the... this is the exact one I had.

3047
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:32,470
Because I recognized the...

3048
02:12:34,570 --> 02:12:35,050
The...

3049
02:12:35,050 --> 02:12:37,330
The sleeve.

3050
02:12:40,370 --> 02:12:40,850
Dang.

3051
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:42,130
Oh my gosh, though.

3052
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:42,630
Can you imagine?

3053
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:44,750
I was one step away from glory.

3054
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:49,150
I was... if I had just got the magazine one...

3055
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:50,650
I don't even know how I got this one.

3056
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:53,470
But if I had just gotten the magazine one...

3057
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:55,830
I would have...

3058
02:12:57,030 --> 02:12:58,790
I would have had Metal Gear!

3059
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:00,690
And Ape Escape!

3060
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:04,350
Have you ever checked the Snake Sam Fisher Death Battle?

3061
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:05,130
What?

3062
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:12,840
Dad Mint got it, maybe?

3063
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:13,600
Maybe, yeah.

3064
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:15,460
Did you get it from Pizza Hut?

3065
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:16,380
Oh, maybe.

3066
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:18,400
I don't know.

3067
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:19,680
I have no idea.

3068
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:21,760
I just... it's just in my memory.

3069
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,740
I do not have a way of how I acquired it.

3070
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:27,140
I used to even play MLB.

3071
02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:37,370
I just realized that the...

3072
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:41,550
That the dates of the games really kind of exposed me.

3073
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:42,710
Oh,

3074
02:13:46,570 --> 02:13:47,370
what should it be?

3075
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:49,410
Forgetty Spaghetti.

3076
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:50,650
Everybody.

3077
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:52,150
It's a... it's fine.

3078
02:13:52,210 --> 02:13:52,690
I'm a ghost.

3079
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:53,750
I've been around for a while.

3080
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:55,490
It's fine.

3081
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:56,110
I'm a ghost.

3082
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:01,070
Here in similar company.

3083
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:03,570
Yippee!

3084
02:14:08,150 --> 02:14:10,810
Do we all have our bad PS1 era sports?

3085
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:13,210
Sports games?

3086
02:14:14,530 --> 02:14:16,830
I would play... yeah, I would play the MLB one.

3087
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:19,430
I played Grind Session.

3088
02:14:20,650 --> 02:14:22,830
I played Medieval a lot.

3089
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:25,210
I loved Medieval.

3090
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:27,370
And I loved the Emperor's New Groove game.

3091
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,850
Played that one a lot too.

3092
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,870
But... oh my gosh.

3093
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:35,330
Even on the back of the box, it shows the spider level that I talked about.

3094
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:38,110
Oh...

3095
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:40,030
Yeah.

3096
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:43,290
I can't believe that I almost had Metal Gear.

3097
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:46,290
But I don't remember ever buying like the...

3098
02:14:48,370 --> 02:14:49,490
The magazines.

3099
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:52,330
Not even my dad got them, so...

3100
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:58,910
Not even my dad got them, but now I want to find it.

3101
02:14:59,810 --> 02:15:02,390
PlayStation Magazine Demo Disc 44.

3102
02:15:02,990 --> 02:15:03,850
4-4!

3103
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:05,990
It's even lucky for me!

3104
02:15:06,410 --> 02:15:08,030
4 is such a spooky number!

3105
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:14,510
To think there are PS1 demo discs floating around with the Titan AE game demo.

3106
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:17,310
It's the only way to play that game since the full game was cancelled.

3107
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:17,650
Really?

3108
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:25,100
Did you try games by renting them at Blockbuster?

3109
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:26,400
Sometimes.

3110
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:31,680
I'm trying to think of what games I...

3111
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:34,100
You know, I'll be honest, like completely...

3112
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:38,700
I think because I didn't play so many games when I was a kid...

3113
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:41,320
Is because I was obsessed with Pokemon.

3114
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:43,760
And that was all I wanted to play.

3115
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:47,300
All I wanted to play was Pokemon!

3116
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:50,240
And so I really didn't branch out so much more.

3117
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,420
I had other games.

3118
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:55,460
But I just always just...

3119
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:56,320
I would...

3120
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:00,920
I would go to the bathroom with my Game Boy and pretend that like...

3121
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:02,540
I was pooping for hours.

3122
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:05,400
My mom would be like, Are you okay in there, Mint?

3123
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:07,780
I'd be like, Yeah, my tummy hurts!

3124
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:08,900
I'm just...

3125
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:09,560
I'm like...

3126
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:10,560
Aunt Sabrina.

3127
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:18,400
Death Battle is a YouTube channel.

3128
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:19,760
They animate fights between characters.

3129
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:19,980
Ah!

3130
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,080
Check it out!

3131
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:24,060
Sasuga.

3132
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:26,460
Yeah.

3133
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:27,980
And then...

3134
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:31,000
You know, I would watch my dad play games.

3135
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:32,500
He'd like to play a lot of stuff.

3136
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:34,520
And...

3137
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:35,140
Uh...

3138
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:37,680
Uh...

3139
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:38,940
I had an N64.

3140
02:16:39,060 --> 02:16:40,520
I only saw demo discs through friends.

3141
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,180
I didn't have...

3142
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:42,080
I only had the PlayStation.

3143
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,740
Well, I had PlayStation and Game Boy.

3144
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:45,260
That's what...

3145
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:45,920
That might...

3146
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:46,600
I actually...

3147
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:49,980
Well, all my stuff was like hand-me-downs from my sisters.

3148
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,600
And so...

3149
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:53,360
My sister, she had a...

3150
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:56,100
Sega Nomad.

3151
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:01,000
So I got to play games from that because of her.

3152
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:03,320
So...

3153
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:04,760
Um...

3154
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:07,300
But...

3155
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:08,200
That's...

3156
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:10,420
You had a Sega Nomad?

3157
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,340
I know, right?

3158
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:14,960
I almost got...

3159
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:16,020
I almost said the Sega Genesis.

3160
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:16,840
I was like, no, no.

3161
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:17,440
What was it called?

3162
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:18,820
The Nomad.

3163
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:20,760
The Nomad was the portable one.

3164
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,340
I think I might still have it somewhere.

3165
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,520
And I had...

3166
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:27,300
I basically...

3167
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:28,740
I only had the Sonic games.

3168
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:30,640
The Lion King game.

3169
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:32,940
I thought about playing that recently.

3170
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:33,960
I was like, I should...

3171
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,640
Oh, I had Echo the Dolphin.

3172
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:37,920
That is my trauma.

3173
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:42,280
It's my actual trauma.

3174
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:45,180
It is a Genesis, but portable.

3175
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:46,120
Right, right, right.

3176
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,620
It's like huge.

3177
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,300
I had even a battery pack for the back.

3178
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:53,360
And...

3179
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:55,840
It like...

3180
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:59,580
It took like seven batteries or something.

3181
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,280
It was crazy.

3182
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,520
Return to the ocean.

3183
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:14,100
Well, I just...

3184
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:16,620
I don't like...

3185
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,620
I don't like stealth.

3186
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,700
I don't like stealth games.

3187
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:26,900
Metal Gear is my...

3188
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:28,840
Is my exception.

3189
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:34,050
Baby Koi.

3190
02:18:34,050 --> 02:18:34,810
Thanks for the gift.

3191
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:40,370
I really don't like stealth, though.

3192
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:42,870
I really kind of took a gamble.

3193
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:46,250
Like truly, I don't know why I played Metal Gear.

3194
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:48,270
But rather...

3195
02:18:48,270 --> 02:18:51,670
When I started with Revengeance, I was like...

3196
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:53,790
This seems like a silly game.

3197
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:57,650
And it was before like the big hype and everything happened.

3198
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:04,120
And even then, I was so like...

3199
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:05,420
You know, that was fun.

3200
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,340
I don't actually know why I started Metal Gear.

3201
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:16,860
And...

3202
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,940
Have you considered playing Devil May Cry games?

3203
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:20,260
Yes!

3204
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,080
That's on my list for sure.

3205
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:26,320
Playing MGS1 demo in the 90s was so mind-blowing.

3206
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:31,320
I truly don't know why, because like I said, I hate stealth.

3207
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:33,660
I think I just kind of was like...

3208
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:35,420
At the time, thinking...

3209
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:38,980
This is a game series that is so influential and...

3210
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:42,580
You know, everybody knows about Snake and his...

3211
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:44,180
Clapping cheeks.

3212
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:46,920
And I was like, I kind of want to know more about that.

3213
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:49,400
And then...

3214
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:51,920
It all...

3215
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:54,560
Snowballed and went downhill.

3216
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:57,540
And now...

3217
02:19:58,120 --> 02:19:59,920
I'm where I am.

3218
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,240
And my brain...

3219
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:03,900
My brain chemistry has been...

3220
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:05,600
Forever altered.

3221
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:06,120
Moira!

3222
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:07,460
Welcome to membership!

3223
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,340
The memes got her.

3224
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:17,300
I don't even think it was me being like...

3225
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:19,340
Oh, I want to know more about...

3226
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:21,200
What they were talking about in Revengeance.

3227
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,340
Because I'll be honest...

3228
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:24,960
I mean, I was so confused.

3229
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:27,440
But...

3230
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,860
Even thinking about it now, I don't think that's so much connected.

3231
02:20:31,140 --> 02:20:32,080
They talk about the Patriots.

3232
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:34,100
The Patriots a little bit, but...

3233
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:36,020
I think it's true.

3234
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:37,320
What about some PS1 action games?

3235
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:38,160
Chase the Express.

3236
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:39,960
It's like a Tom Cruise game...

3237
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:40,600
Film as a game.

3238
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:43,400
Parasite Eve!

3239
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:44,000
Oh my gosh.

3240
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:46,000
I always wanted to play Parasite Eve...

3241
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,300
Forever ago.

3242
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:49,920
So glad you're here!

3243
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:51,120
Kazami, thank you!

3244
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,300
Mintpie, thank you!

3245
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:56,120
MG...

3246
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:56,960
Fan...

3247
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,780
Stom...

3248
02:20:59,020 --> 02:20:59,540
True.

3249
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:01,460
Truest words...

3250
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:02,040
Ever spoken.

3251
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:07,980
A little pause... and we are back.

3252
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:09,880
A little pause... and we are back.

3253
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:25,700
A little pause... and we are back.

3254
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:41,700
I'm going to play some other games that you don't see so many people streaming very often because at the time, like nobody was streaming Metal Gear.

3255
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:44,720
You had Pekora who streamed it before.

3256
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:50,560
And I didn't even get to watch her VODs because they all got removed.

3257
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,920
But now she's replayed them.

3258
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:54,800
But I'm just kind of like...

3259
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,000
It's kind of just like...

3260
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:06,150
I think my chat's delayed.

3261
02:22:06,290 --> 02:22:07,830
Wait, I think my everything is delayed.

3262
02:22:08,650 --> 02:22:09,530
Uh-oh, hold on.

3263
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:10,030
One second.

3264
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:12,070
I'm refreshing.

3265
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:21,290
There we go.

3266
02:22:21,490 --> 02:22:35,290
But yeah, so I've just been trying to, you know, like with this game as well, just trying to get through some things that maybe people don't touch as much in terms of VTuber playthroughs.

3267
02:22:38,570 --> 02:22:41,050
Her site Eve is actually based on a JP novel.

3268
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:41,670
Oh, is it really?

3269
02:22:43,990 --> 02:22:46,150
Oh my gosh, my chat is all messed up.

3270
02:22:48,590 --> 02:22:49,510
Everything's all messed up.

3271
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:56,450
After the release of Ace Combat 7 for the Switch Bandai already announced merch for the games.

3272
02:22:56,530 --> 02:22:56,990
I'm so excited.

3273
02:22:56,990 --> 02:22:58,270
They got a JPEG dog sticker.

3274
02:22:58,710 --> 02:22:59,490
No way!

3275
02:23:01,470 --> 02:23:02,970
MGS, Mintos, great streams.

3276
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:05,190
Oh my gosh, that reminds me.

3277
02:23:05,230 --> 02:23:06,770
I was on AmiAmi last night.

3278
02:23:07,070 --> 02:23:09,050
And guys, hold on.

3279
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:11,550
I have to... I have to... I already have it up.

3280
02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:12,630
I already have it pulled up.

3281
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:13,290
Look!

3282
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:15,410
Look at this!

3283
02:23:15,710 --> 02:23:18,410
I saw this last night and I nearly screamed.

3284
02:23:21,770 --> 02:23:23,050
Outer Wilds!

3285
02:23:23,890 --> 02:23:25,010
Archaeologist Edition!

3286
02:23:25,690 --> 02:23:27,630
Oh my gosh, look!

3287
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:28,570
Oh my god.

3288
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:33,390
And then also the AmiAmi Gente item.

3289
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:38,550
If you pre-order from AmiAmi, you can also get an acrylic key holder.

3290
02:23:38,970 --> 02:23:41,450
But also the ones that are... Look how cute!

3291
02:23:41,450 --> 02:23:46,230
And the middle thing is like a... It says it's a fabric poster.

3292
02:23:48,350 --> 02:23:50,750
Rather than like a wall scroll.

3293
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:53,450
But it's probably... You know, you can make it into a wall scroll.

3294
02:23:54,650 --> 02:23:55,050
So...

3295
02:23:57,550 --> 02:23:59,310
Your game choices are really interesting and fun.

3296
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:00,050
I look forward to them.

3297
02:24:00,350 --> 02:24:00,970
Thank you!

3298
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:03,350
YouTube, why?

3299
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:04,230
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3300
02:24:04,430 --> 02:24:07,730
It's all like kind of... Chat is all kind of delayed and stuff.

3301
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:08,590
I thought it was just me.

3302
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:10,670
I think my stream is all messed up.

3303
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:11,490
Like it's all delayed.

3304
02:24:16,210 --> 02:24:18,050
But yeah, isn't it so cute?

3305
02:24:19,330 --> 02:24:21,250
It comes with the little key chains.

3306
02:24:22,010 --> 02:24:22,930
And then the...

3307
02:24:23,570 --> 02:24:25,250
And it also comes with the DLC.

3308
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:30,430
I love Outer Wilds.

3309
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:32,190
I was like, oh no, I guess I'll have to buy it.

3310
02:24:34,450 --> 02:24:37,190
I ordered the limited edition from IM8Bit.

3311
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:39,030
Of Outer Wilds?

3312
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:40,590
It has the fabric bag.

3313
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:40,990
Wait.

3314
02:24:44,530 --> 02:24:45,170
IM8Bit.

3315
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:49,780
I'm going.

3316
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,440
I'm viewing.

3317
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:53,920
What?

3318
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,840
The bag is so cool!

3319
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,560
Oh my gosh!

3320
02:24:59,060 --> 02:24:59,480
Wow!

3321
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:01,440
Hold on, I'll show you guys a picture.

3322
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:04,120
Property of Outer Wilds Ventures!

3323
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,680
No way!

3324
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:12,040
This is the one you were talking about?

3325
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:15,740
I don't understand the scar... like the ascot though.

3326
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:18,920
Art, not vinyl.

3327
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:22,180
I don't really understand that.

3328
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:24,280
But the book looks really cool.

3329
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:28,400
All the little badges and stuff of the different planets are really cute.

3330
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,820
So this is the archaeologist edition but in...

3331
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:34,640
In... Western.

3332
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:36,020
I suppose.

3333
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:37,940
Try Ninja Turtles games.

3334
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,500
Bet nobody does that.

3335
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:43,360
Ninja Turtles.

3336
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:47,040
Oh yeah, there's a kazoo down there too.

3337
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:47,760
It's so cute.

3338
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:51,280
Wow.

3339
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,720
Oh wait, it says...

3340
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:55,800
Canvas Traveler's Adventure Bag.

3341
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:58,080
Explorer's Journal plus Game Sleeve.

3342
02:25:58,140 --> 02:25:59,600
Oh, so it's not like an art book.

3343
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:01,260
It's a journal.

3344
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:03,680
Oh, it's Church's Bandana!

3345
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:06,260
Set of seven planetary patches.

3346
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:09,680
Bonus item from a doomed timeline.

3347
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:21,570
Eye of the Universe Clasp.

3348
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:23,770
Base game plus Echoes of the Eye expansion.

3349
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:25,870
Region free.

3350
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:26,930
Worldwide capability.

3351
02:26:28,850 --> 02:26:29,750
So the...

3352
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:31,970
The kazoo is the bonus item?

3353
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:33,270
It's not even like...

3354
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:35,670
It's like all blacked out.

3355
02:26:37,210 --> 02:26:39,830
Ace Combat Seven Seekers is going to be on Rakuten JP website.

3356
02:26:39,830 --> 02:26:43,830
And then there's F16 model kit.

3357
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:46,330
Wait I wonder...

3358
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:51,090
I wonder if AmiAmi will have a special pre-order item too.

3359
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:54,910
Not the Doom kazoo!

3360
02:26:57,050 --> 02:26:58,970
Can't wait for you to play Xenoblade eventually.

3361
02:26:59,230 --> 02:26:59,570
Eventually!

3362
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:01,750
It is on the list.

3363
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:04,850
It is on the list!

3364
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:05,810
Of stuff.

3365
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:07,470
We'll get there, we'll get there.

3366
02:27:08,950 --> 02:27:09,550
Eventually.

3367
02:27:16,430 --> 02:27:20,610
Oh my gosh, shut up, they have... Oh no!

3368
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:23,170
No!

3369
02:27:23,950 --> 02:27:27,810
This I Am 8-Bit Place had vinyl soundtracks!

3370
02:27:29,170 --> 02:27:36,330
Oh my gosh, I bought one Metal Gear vinyl and now I got the Steins Gate vinyl and...

3371
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:37,630
Oh, but they're sold out!

3372
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:41,550
Oh my gosh, I would cry though, I would put it on and I would cry.

3373
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:43,090
No!

3374
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:51,690
I think Outer Wilds is like, to me even more so a super special series because...

3375
02:27:52,970 --> 02:27:56,910
It was one of the last things I played back in heaven and so...

3376
02:27:57,530 --> 02:28:00,150
You know, and the ending is just so like...

3377
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:05,310
And so to me it just means, it just like has such a special meaning.

3378
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:08,330
That I...

3379
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:12,290
Like...

3380
02:28:12,290 --> 02:28:13,450
What was the word?

3381
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:14,430
I...

3382
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:15,750
Um...

3383
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:18,050
Have good memories with it, you know?

3384
02:28:18,130 --> 02:28:19,470
Did you buy a turntable yet?

3385
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:20,370
No, not yet!

3386
02:28:21,310 --> 02:28:25,370
I honestly, I wasn't gonna get one until the Metal Gear ones shipped but...

3387
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:26,270
Um...

3388
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:27,450
They...

3389
02:28:28,530 --> 02:28:29,050
Sold...

3390
02:28:29,050 --> 02:28:29,610
Uh...

3391
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:35,450
They sold the Steins Gate ones at the Jast booth at AX and so I got that.

3392
02:28:35,730 --> 02:28:36,050
And...

3393
02:28:37,390 --> 02:28:39,070
So now I actually have something like that.

3394
02:28:39,070 --> 02:28:39,490
And that's worth...

3395
02:28:39,490 --> 02:28:41,110
That will need a turntable.

3396
02:28:42,510 --> 02:28:44,430
It's an ending and a new beginning.

3397
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:45,590
Yeah.

3398
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:54,190
Outer Wilds music still makes me tear up and it's been years.

3399
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:55,010
It's so...

3400
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:57,170
It's so weird.

3401
02:29:00,190 --> 02:29:02,590
Acceptance of an end that brings a new beginning.

3402
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:03,290
Fitting, huh?

3403
02:29:03,810 --> 02:29:04,690
Yeah, somehow.

3404
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:07,670
Somehow it ended up that way.

3405
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:16,570
Oh, and they also had a vinyl soundtrack that was a pre-order of Echoes of the Eye music.

3406
02:29:16,830 --> 02:29:18,290
But isn't that, like, kind of creepy?

3407
02:29:20,470 --> 02:29:23,310
It says, Secrets from the Outer Wilds.

3408
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:24,690
Read at your own risk.

3409
02:29:24,810 --> 02:29:25,530
It's so cool!

3410
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:28,150
Wow, the art is...

3411
02:29:28,150 --> 02:29:28,890
The art goes hard.

3412
02:29:29,150 --> 02:29:29,530
Look at this.

3413
02:29:29,610 --> 02:29:30,790
Actually, this is, like, so genius.

3414
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:31,510
Okay, hold on.

3415
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:32,710
Wait.

3416
02:29:32,910 --> 02:29:34,390
I have to save it like this.

3417
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:35,690
Oh, hold on.

3418
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:36,450
Actually, let me do this.

3419
02:29:39,130 --> 02:29:39,530
Um...

3420
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:39,890
Whoop.

3421
02:29:44,350 --> 02:29:44,750
Uh...

3422
02:29:46,010 --> 02:29:46,690
One second.

3423
02:29:46,850 --> 02:29:47,170
One second.

3424
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:47,970
I'm getting your pictures.

3425
02:29:48,070 --> 02:29:48,710
I'm getting your pictures.

3426
02:29:49,210 --> 02:29:50,330
Okay, so this is the...

3427
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:52,610
This one's so sweet!

3428
02:29:52,930 --> 02:29:53,850
Oh, my gosh.

3429
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:55,690
I'm getting your pictures.

3430
02:29:55,770 --> 02:29:56,430
So you could say...

3431
02:29:59,610 --> 02:30:00,410
Oh, sorry.

3432
02:30:00,510 --> 02:30:01,150
They're different sizes.

3433
02:30:05,410 --> 02:30:05,810
Save.

3434
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:06,790
Okay, here we go.

3435
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:08,490
Um...

3436
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:11,970
Okay.

3437
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:13,890
I'm so sad that they're sold out, though.

3438
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:16,290
But the one on the right is from, like, you know, obviously it's...

3439
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:18,110
It's the Outer Wilds proper.

3440
02:30:18,390 --> 02:30:20,510
And then the one on the left is from the...

3441
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:23,410
Is from the, um...

3442
02:30:23,410 --> 02:30:24,010
DLC.

3443
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:26,150
But it's so cool because, like...

3444
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:29,070
They have, like, the part that's...

3445
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:32,590
Like, it looks like the vinyl is ripped and then it shows the secret planet.

3446
02:30:33,370 --> 02:30:34,550
It looks so cool!

3447
02:30:36,030 --> 02:30:37,450
Oh, the covers are so nice.

3448
02:30:38,910 --> 02:30:40,050
The left one looks so cool.

3449
02:30:40,090 --> 02:30:40,430
I know!

3450
02:30:40,850 --> 02:30:41,770
Such a cool sleeve.

3451
02:30:41,830 --> 02:30:41,970
I know!

3452
02:30:41,970 --> 02:30:45,630
I'm so glad and understandable that Outer Wilds means that much to you as well.

3453
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:47,370
It's been one of my favorite series to watch you play.

3454
02:30:47,470 --> 02:30:48,230
Thank you, Nexi!

3455
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:51,830
Ghostbusters, the video game.

3456
02:30:52,270 --> 02:30:52,630
2009.

3457
02:30:53,130 --> 02:30:53,490
Busted.

3458
02:30:53,550 --> 02:30:53,910
Busted.

3459
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:54,870
I...

3460
02:30:54,870 --> 02:30:55,630
Oh, my gosh.

3461
02:30:55,690 --> 02:30:59,770
Every time I'm on the plane, I always see Ghostbusters and I'm like, I should watch it.

3462
02:30:59,830 --> 02:31:00,310
It's been, like...

3463
02:31:00,310 --> 02:31:02,330
I think I've only watched it ever once.

3464
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:04,330
And it was, you know, probably when I was a kid.

3465
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:08,930
But I don't think I can watch it without, like...

3466
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:11,930
Without Busted.

3467
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:15,190
Like, the song is just ruined for me.

3468
02:31:16,150 --> 02:31:18,070
I can't do the original anymore.

3469
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:20,790
The original song.

3470
02:31:24,910 --> 02:31:25,790
Watch-a-long?

3471
02:31:26,030 --> 02:31:27,290
October watch-a-long?

3472
02:31:30,470 --> 02:31:31,030
Maybe.

3473
02:31:36,490 --> 02:31:39,110
It got the Ghostbusters brain rot.

3474
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:40,390
I don't think it goes that hard.

3475
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:41,570
Okay.

3476
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:46,270
Oh, Neil Ciciarga Remix is a straight up improvement.

3477
02:31:46,670 --> 02:31:47,530
It's just so funny.

3478
02:31:49,630 --> 02:31:51,870
Such a good... such a good.

3479
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:59,410
Speaking of, thank you guys for hanging out with me today, as always.

3480
02:31:59,890 --> 02:32:04,650
Thank you for... again, I know I keep apologizing, but I feel so bad.

3481
02:32:04,910 --> 02:32:07,910
I wanted to keep playing for real, but I was just nervous.

3482
02:32:08,390 --> 02:32:12,170
That if I have to start over... I don't want to start over.

3483
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:17,770
I don't wanna go through the two hours again.

3484
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:20,370
Even though I know what to do now, I could've...

3485
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:22,630
But if I have to, I can.

3486
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:25,870
And then I could just... I'm gonna try and figure it out.

3487
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:29,650
And again, if I have to...

3488
02:32:30,130 --> 02:32:32,450
If I can't figure out a way to save it...

3489
02:32:32,450 --> 02:32:36,350
I will make the next stream an endurance stream.

3490
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:39,610
So I can at least beat it.

3491
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:40,910
And then maybe...

3492
02:32:41,650 --> 02:32:43,350
We'll do like a...

3493
02:32:44,650 --> 02:32:45,910
You could find new things.

3494
02:32:46,010 --> 02:32:47,150
Oh my gosh, we could save that guy!

3495
02:32:48,310 --> 02:32:49,290
Came in kind of late.

3496
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:50,210
I don't know what's going on.

3497
02:32:50,390 --> 02:32:50,970
It's fine.

3498
02:32:54,510 --> 02:32:55,090
But yeah.

3499
02:32:56,910 --> 02:32:59,270
You cut it close at the temple, so it was a good decision.

3500
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:00,030
I know.

3501
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:01,790
It's just gonna get harder too, right?

3502
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:05,130
But I gamed a little bit.

3503
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:08,190
I gamed a little bit.

3504
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:10,570
Endurance, woo!

3505
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:13,270
I don't think I'll do all three endings.

3506
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:16,970
Maybe I'll do one of them and then we watch the other two.

3507
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:17,550
Or...

3508
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:19,550
It's not three endings.

3509
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:22,010
I play it three times and then I...

3510
02:33:25,370 --> 02:33:26,170
Watch it.

3511
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:26,470
I don't know.

3512
02:33:28,090 --> 02:33:28,970
I'll figure it out.

3513
02:33:29,970 --> 02:33:30,950
We'll figure it out.

3514
02:33:31,210 --> 02:33:32,210
We'll figure it out.

3515
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:33,290
We'll figure it out.

3516
02:33:33,290 --> 02:33:33,950
As we do.

3517
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:36,370
Anyway.

3518
02:33:36,570 --> 02:33:38,630
Better safe than sorry.

3519
02:33:38,930 --> 02:33:40,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3520
02:33:40,370 --> 02:33:41,470
So, next stream.

3521
02:33:42,930 --> 02:33:44,190
Next couple of days.

3522
02:33:44,970 --> 02:33:45,890
I'll get it.

3523
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:47,630
Well, hopefully next couple of days.

3524
02:33:48,970 --> 02:33:49,970
I'll get it figured out.

3525
02:33:50,030 --> 02:33:50,390

3526
02:33:50,510 --> 02:33:50,790
I promise!

3527
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:53,130
It's my brain.

3528
02:33:53,230 --> 02:33:54,410
I didn't even think about it.

3529
02:33:54,910 --> 02:33:55,910
I'm so sorry.

3530
02:33:56,570 --> 02:33:57,070
Okay.

3531
02:33:58,270 --> 02:33:58,770
Everybody.

3532
02:34:00,010 --> 02:34:00,610
Thank you.

3533
02:34:01,610 --> 02:34:02,590
It is time.

3534
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:04,130
To do.

3535
02:34:05,130 --> 02:34:05,930

3536
02:34:06,130 --> 02:34:07,230
Goodbye ritual.

It's loud.

3542
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:26,390
Otsu Bustin'.

3543
02:34:27,130 --> 02:34:28,170
Otsu Mito.

3544
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:34,250
There's

3545
02:34:37,730 --> 02:34:38,590
something strange.

3546
02:34:39,290 --> 02:34:40,630
Sleeping in your bed.

3547
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:43,230
Dun dun dun laddub.

3548
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:44,570
Let me tell you something.

3549
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:49,010
If there's something we're sleeping in your bed.

3550

02:34:50,210 --> 02:34:51,250

Freaky man, baby!

3579
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:29,510
If you're all alone, let me sleep in your bed.

3580
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:36,150
Let me tell you something.

3581
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:38,990
Sleeping makes me feel good!

3582
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:44,810
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

3583
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:46,890
I ain't afraid of no bed.

3584
02:36:47,970 --> 02:36:49,990
I like the freaky music here.

3585
02:36:51,070 --> 02:36:52,610
An invisible bed.

3586
02:36:54,030 --> 02:36:55,770
Freaky ghost man!

Karaoke.

3590
02:37:13,130 --> 02:37:18,290
If you are a member, you will get a membership karaoke stream.

3591
02:37:26,470 --> 02:37:29,130
I'll make the waiting room right after this.
