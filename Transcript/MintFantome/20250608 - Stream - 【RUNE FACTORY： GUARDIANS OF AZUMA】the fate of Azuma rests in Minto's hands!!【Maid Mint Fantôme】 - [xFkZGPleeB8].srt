1
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,450
Hello, hello, hello.

2
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,590
Hello, hello everybody.

3
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,510
Welcome.

4
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,390
Hello.

5
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,750
I've just been vibing to the opening.

6
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,030
It's so relaxing.

7
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,350
Yeah.

8
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,480
And it's over.

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,160
Anyway, welcome you guys to Rude Factory.

10
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,120
Guardians of Azuma.

11
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,400
This one seems kind of... dramatic.

12
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,440
I think.

13
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,440
I was watching the trailer.

14
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,760
And... actually, I also have to confess.

15
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,000
This is my first ever Rune Factory game.

16
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,260
So... I don't know.

17
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,380
I want to farm and I want to romance.

18
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,660
But... if I romance... do I have to pick a guy character?

19
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,920
Is that how it works?

20
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
Rune Factory.

21
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,520
Give us the ladies.

22
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,720
I don't have to?

23
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,840
I don't... I don't need to?

24
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,520
Oh man.

25
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,240
Well... what did you do?

26
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,140
What did you...

27
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,180
Like you're a little vote for the...

28
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,820
Super, what are... what are you... what are you apologizing for?

29
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,320
What do you...

30
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,320
what are you apologizing for?

31
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
You can romance any gender.

32
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Yeah.

33
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,980
Let's go.

34
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,600
I really wanted to be the girl.

35
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,400
She's so cute.

36
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,740
Oh my gosh.

37
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
We're gonna be the girl and we're gonna get with Iroha.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,440
Iroha.

39
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,020
I was like... wait a second.

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,740
I was... So, this is a sponsored stream.

41
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,760
Thank you so much MarvelousUSA for sponsoring me for this stream.

42
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,680
If you're interested in the game, I have a pinned link.

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,100
And I also have a link in the description.

44
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,640
But, um... I'm excited.

45
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Uh... Uh... I'm still also very jet-lagged.

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,040
So... I'm still very jet-lagged.

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,140
So... I will do my best.

49
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,840
Um... The game is for... PC.

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,220
And Switch.

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,400
And also... Switch 2.

52
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,140
So, if you've got your new old... New... I almost said new old Switch.

53
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,800
That's like an oxymoron.

54
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,440
If you've got... If you've got... A new... New Switch 2.

55
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,240
You can play it there.

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,680
Whoa... And, um... Yeah... PC 2?

57
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,850
No... No... Only PC 1.

58
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,110
Switch to what?

59
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,670
Switch to what?

60
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,990
But yeah... If you... Don't have a new Switch... You can... Play on a regular... Original Switch.

61
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:54,330
And... Also... The game... Is in... Nihongo... Or... Eigo.

62
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,950
That's... English... Translators... No...

63
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,750
And... But we'll be playing in English today.

64
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,850
So that I don't have to... Narrate.

65
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,690
So that I can rest my voice a little bit.

66
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,730
Eigo... Leggo... Leggo... My Eigo.

67
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,290
Wow... You're so cultured.

68
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,990
Arigato.

69
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:33,450
But also... I noticed that... With the other Rune Factory games... They're very... How do I say... Uh... Oh my gosh...

70
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,730
Thank you guys for the Super Chats... Ah...

71
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,310
Uh...

72
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:51,110
I can't really do... Uh... Birthday... Messages... Today... Because it is like... A... You know... A sponsored stream... But... Uh... Happy Birthday...

73
00:06:51,110 --> 00:07:22,470
Uh... Uh... Adam... Skunk... It's a great name... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Thank you... Thank you so much for the... Uh... Um... But... What was I saying... Oh gosh... I lost my train of thought... Uh... Uh... Oh... Um... The other... Rune Factory games... I noticed were very like... Like... Western Fantasy... You know... It's like... Knights and... Ladies... But this one is very...

74
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:50,530
Uh... Uh... Japan... Inspired... So... You can... Unleash your... Weeabu Soul... Hahaha... Yeah... We're... We're... Japanese... Inspired this time... And... I think there's dragons... Not... I think... I know there's dragons... Hmm... Hmm... So let's just get started... New game... They gave me the... The DLC too... Hahaha...

75
00:07:50,530 --> 00:08:18,680
And one of them... Was just... Swimsuit DLC... So I hope I get to see that... Hahaha... I hope... Okay... Show me what you look like... Wait... See... Isn't there... I mean... They're both cute... But like... She's so pretty...

76
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:29,420
I like how... They have very similar bangs... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... She's very cute... Wait... Can I like... Spin her around?

77
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,540
No... Haha... Show me... Show me what you got in the back... Pretty lady... They look nice... Right?

78
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:46,540
Well... We'll go with the girl... She said... Hmm... Good choice... Oh my gosh... Wait... I can put my own name...

79
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:57,820
Vito... I like both to be aged... Yeah... They're both great... Confirm... A fine name... When were you born?

80
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,880
Spring?

81
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,460
Wait... Oh... 7th... Like... 7th... Uh... Wait... Autumn 7th?

82
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Wait... What?

83
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,260
Winter 7th?

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,580
Huh?

85
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,400
Hahaha... Oh... It's because...

86
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:45,820
I'm on the 7th... Hahaha... Hahaha... Hahaha... I was like... Oh... That must be... July... Hahaha... Hahaha... There are only 4 months... Well... October... October is technically autumn... Even though it's early... October... So October 1st... Autumn 1st... Baby... Hahaha... Hahaha... So I see... Then how much of a challenge...

87
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,540
What do you desire?

88
00:09:47,500 --> 00:10:13,840
Story... Focus on the plot... While fighting... Easier battles... Balance... The intended experience... Hard... Test your mettle... Against... Stronger enemies... We'll go with balance... It's my first time playing... Minto... It's a holiday... Interesting... No... No hard... No hard... No hard... No... Hahaha... Holiday is just short for weekend... Oh... I guess that makes sense... Huh?

89
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,800
Yes...

90
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:32,370
She's like... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Oooh... She's so pretty... Oh my god... She's got lippy... Cute... Oh!

91
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,090
Our dragon... Hahaha...

92
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,720
The two dragons... Why do you stand in my way?

93
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,540
Me?

94
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,420
I could ask you the very same... She sounds familiar... Enough talk!

95
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Why are we fighting?

96
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,400
I don't think these dragons have arms.

97
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,340
Oh, this they do.

98
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,860
I just saw it.

99
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,800
I thought they were just like snakes.

100
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,490
Worm dragons.

101
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,110
Yeah, they're just little worms.

102
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,950
Oh, sorry.

103
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,630
My cursor is like right in the center.

104
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,790
Yeah, kick his butt.

105
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,590
He's got big teeth and she's got little tiny teeth.

106
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,890
I always notice teeth first.

107
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,750
Am I the only one like that?

108
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,450
Do you guys notice teeth?

109
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,730
Oh, good morning, princess.

110
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,470
Oh, princess.

111
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,510
Minto!

112
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,250
It's me!

113
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,050
Just a dream.

114
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,870
Oh, wow.

115
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,670
It's really fully voiced.

116
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,070
Oh, thank goodness for me.

117
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,750
It's me!

118
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,790
Good morning!

119
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,550
Finally awake in there?

120
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,450
Who is it?

121
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,970
I hear a cute girl.

122
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,210
Oh, the adventure log.

123
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,010
Oh, look.

124
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,090
They're actually Nakayoshi.

125
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,050
They're actually friends.

126
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,970
If you feel lost, use escape to open the cam menu and check the tutorials in your adventure log.

127
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,010
Which may offer some helpful hints.

128
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,970
Took you long enough, sleepyhead.

129
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,290
Do you have any idea what time it is?

130
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,210
Nope.

131
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,430
Oh, did I do there?

132
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,270
Oopsie.

133
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,310
I'll move with the waster.

134
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,470
Oh, I completed the tutorial.

135
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,490
I can attack.

136
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,250
Pretty.

137
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,450
When she swipes the petals.

138
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,430
Oh, what's in here?

139
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,330
My wardrobe.

140
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,610
You can change it to any...

141
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,530
Wait, do I have the swimsuit?

142
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,910
Ooh!

143
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,690
Thank you, Marvelous staff, for providing me with the DLC.

144
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,000
Wait, I can rotate.

145
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,740
Ooh!

146
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,120
It's actually quite modest.

147
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,520
It's so cute.

148
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,520
It's so cute!

149
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,900
Here, I was thinking we're gonna get, like, some Senran Kagura...

150
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,020
Anyway.

151
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,720
Anyway.

152
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,580
Confirm.

153
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,700
Oh, yeah.

154
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,720
Yeah, we're good.

155
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,560
So, yeah.

156
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,820
I just started the game.

157
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,100
I just start...

158
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,580
Wait, that's my girl!

159
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,020
You see her out the door?

160
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,880
I'm gonna romance you!

161
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
You...

162
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,730
You know how...

163
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,230
She a pain...

164
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,670
She...

165
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,210
She...

166
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,410
She...

167
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,370
Appeals to all my...

168
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,070
Particulars.

169
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,610
She's really cute.

170
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,050
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,490
Oh, God!

172
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,390
Look at her face!

173
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,310
She's so cute!

174
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,910
She's so cute!

175
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,910
Now, hurry and wash up.

176
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,450
We'll have breakfast after we tidy the shrine.

177
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,130
Yeah.

178
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,670
More cleaning today?

179
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,030
I didn't realize you were such a neat freak.

180
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,670
Not Minto calling someone else a freak.

181
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,430
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.

182
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,730
Cleanliness is a daily routine.

183
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,050
Besides, those who don't work, don't eat.

184
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:49,910
Oh, wow.

185
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,410
I guess that's true.

186
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,870
I suppose.

187
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,010
Not her being in the bikini.

188
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,410
Oh...

189
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,250
I don't know if I can take her seriously.

190
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,470
Can I ask you to take care of the sweeping again?

191
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,850
Oh, I have to...

192
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,250
Okay.

193
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,630
I guess the...

194
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,010
That's not the maid's duties.

195
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:08,930
It's...

196
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,990
Green maid, sign me up!

197
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,270
Okay.

198
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,390
Okay.

199
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,850
Oh my gosh!

200
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,610
Wait, minigame?

201
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,530
Oh, she's also sweeping.

202
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,930
You got this, honey!

203
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,130
Yep.

204
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,110
Keep...

205
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,890
Keep sweeping them circles.

206
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,130
Oh no.

207
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,990
Do I have hiccups?

208
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,650
You're saying...

209
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:34,950
Wait.

210
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,790
You're saying her name is pronounced Iroha, not Iroha.

211
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,950
Oh?

212
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,570
Sweep.

213
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,190
Oh...

214
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,130
Oh, we got some grass.

215
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,090
Sweep.

216
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,850
Got some weeds.

217
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:51,970
Sweep.

218
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,710
We got a rock!

219
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,750
Sweep.

220
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,110
We got some more grass.

221
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,050
Sweep.

222
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,630
You never know what you're gonna find in there.

223
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,110
I've had to believe you've been in this for half a year now.

224
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,590
You never know what you're gonna find in the pile of leaves.

225
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,010
Has it really been that long?

226
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,790
She still doesn't know how to put on clothes.

227
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,370
And boy, did we start off with a bang.

228
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,940
I'll never forget walking into the shrine...

229
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,200
Wait, it's been half a year?

230
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,300
And you just left the roof?

231
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,040
You just left the roof like that?

232
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,140
What?

233
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,920
Wait...

234
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,980
You mean you haven't fixed the roof in half a year?

235
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,910
Rain!

236
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:44,770
And...

237
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,820
Oh my god, it's probably...

238
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,400
She's too short.

239
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,700
She can't reach the ceiling.

240
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
So true.

241
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,600
It's fine, yeah.

242
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't help but think you must be someone really special.

243
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,020
Say my name, Iroha.

244
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:05,740
Minto.

245
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,720
That roof repair is expensive.

246
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,340
We gotta go to the shrine more and donate more, you guys.

247
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,720
Like a messenger from the Dragon God or something.

248
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,740
Oh, well...

249
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,660
They like having an indoor pond.

250
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,820
Oh please, I doubt that.

251
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,340
Divine Envoy or No, I'm happy to have you.

252
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,360
Since so many villagers have moved out, it feels good welcoming a new neighbor for a change.

253
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,820
Why is she so smug?

254
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,060
Oh, she's so cute though.

255
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,840
Oh, I like Iroha.

256
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,200
Thank you.

257
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,540
I'm glad to hear it.

258
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,860
Alright, we did our chores.

259
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,200
Let's walk around a little bit before we talk to Iroha some more.

260
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,400
Ooh.

261
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,840
Come on, be serious.

262
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,640
Oh, sorry.

263
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,920
I got scolded for exploring.

264
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,480
I got...

265
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,580
I got...

266
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,540
I got scolded for exploring.

267
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm ready to go on adventures.

268
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:14,760
Oh!

269
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,860
Oh yeah.

270
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,020
We climbing.

271
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,860
Do you think we share the bed or...

272
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,020
Wait, so we really did just leave it like this.

273
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,880
Oh wait, inspect.

274
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,100
It's awfully drafty in here.

275
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,840
Most likely because of that enormous hole in the roof.

276
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,240
So

277
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,340
not even they like it.

278
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,080
Welcome back.

279
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,820
Thank you.

280
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,620
There.

281
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,520
Perfect.

282
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,500
And I'm sure the god residing here would agree.

283
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,460
Mm-hmm.

284
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,500
So, who is the god of the shrine anyway?

285
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,400
Uh, good question.

286
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
All I know is that they're a dragon.

287
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,520
Oh.

288
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,000
What was their name again?

289
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,940
You don't even know?

290
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,980
I think it's...

291
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,820
Moko something?

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
Moko something.

293
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,200
Oh, that's kind of cute.

294
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,180
Yeah.

295
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,920
Anyway, they're a protector god.

296
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,700
So we should pay our respects.

297
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm gonna turn auto on.

298
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,840
Oh.

299
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,940
There we go.

300
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,600
Could you use this to perform the ritual prayer and dance?

301
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,700
Mokoku?

302
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,260
Oh.

303
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,680
Use dance of bonds at the save statue.

304
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,820
Oh.

305
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,260
Oh.

306
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,160
We equip it.

307
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,260
Oh.

308
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,040
Okay.

309
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,420
I got it.

310
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,380
I do it at a statue or I just...

311
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,040
Prosper.

312
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,260
Oh.

313
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,580
Oh, neat.

314
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720
What did that do?

315
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,180
Prosper.

316
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,000
Prosper.

317
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,260
Oh.

318
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,980
Oh.

319
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,080
Oh.

320
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,100
Oh.

321
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,800
Oh.

322
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,740
I offer these humble words.

323
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,680
I think you should have gotten dressed.

324
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,940
Great god of the dragon shrine.

325
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,080
Moko something.

326
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,180
May your divine glory shine forth and bless us all forevermore.

327
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,340
She's got moves.

328
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,540
She was so impressed.

329
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:25,820
Oh.

330
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,180
Everybody bowed.

331
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,720
Bonding with save statues.

332
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,580
Perform the dance of bonds at a save statue to establish a link with a divine dragon within.

333
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,980
Saving all your progress.

334
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,380
Okay.

335
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,180
So did it save or...

336
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,460
What should I do?

337
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,260
Save.

338
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,940
I'll save anyway.

339
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,220
Cool.

340
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,760
Hiroha, I did it.

341
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,920
Are you so impressed?

342
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,600
Do nothing.

343
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,720
Why a plum branch, I wonder?

344
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,080
I wonder if we had chosen the guy what his bathing suit looked like.

345
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,760
Can it really do that?

346
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,740
Fancy.

347
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,540
Oh.

348
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,050
Suzu.

349
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,370
Suzu cute.

350
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,510
Pull.

351
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,630
I brought you lunch.

352
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,090
The cutest family ever.

353
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,770
Aw, you sweetie.

354
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,690
You're so cute.

355
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,250
And here you go.

356
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:35,970
Enjoy.

357
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,270
Oh, what did I get?

358
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,390
Thank you so much.

359
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,050
I got leaves.

360
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,230
They gathered...

361
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,850
They gave me all the leaves that I swept up.

362
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,030
Is she hungry too?

363
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,710
They gave to me for...

364
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,250
All the leaves I swept up, they wrapped it up and gave it to me.

365
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,310
Wait, I can give her half or I can eat it?

366
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,870
I'll just eat it when she's not watching.

367
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,970
That's so mean.

368
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,250
I feel like our relationship will go up if I give half to her sister, but...

369
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,470
I kind of want to see the reaction for the second one.

370
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,110
Okay.

371
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,230
Have you eaten already, Iroha?

372
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,010
Yep.

373
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,510
She looks hungry.

374
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,670
She looks so...

375
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,430
Whoa, deep voice.

376
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,130
Grandpa.

377
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,370
Grandpa.

378
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,810
Good morning.

379
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,910
Suzu.

380
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,190
I see you're a bright little ball of energy as always.

381
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,190
There's a good girl.

382
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,790
I'm the best girl.

383
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,370
Heck yeah.

384
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,690
She's the best girl.

385
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,010
Would you two come with me?

386
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,070
The IA will be leaving shortly.

387
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,230
And I thought you might like to see her off.

388
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,850
Yeah.

389
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,470
Oh.

390
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,330
Um.

391
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,130
Okay.

392
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,670
My thanks.

393
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:58,850
You're well.

394
00:22:59,390 --> 00:22:59,910
You're...

395
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,170
My welx.

396
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,110
Right this way then.

397
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,790
Okay.

398
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,690
The swimsuit sticks out so much.

399
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,490
I think we need to change.

400
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,110
I should have said that we had chores to do and get dressed.

401
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,070
Spring Village.

402
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,930
Oh, but it's like so dry.

403
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,430
It looks so dead.

404
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,070
Have you managed to settle in?

405
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,890
Yes.

406
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,810
Everyone's been so helpful.

407
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,750
Good.

408
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:29,690
Good.

409
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,850
Nearly 50 years have passed since the Celestial Collapse.

410
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,530
Oh.

411
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,130
Our village once bustled with travelers from all over Azuma.

412
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,010
Now...

413
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,270
Oh, so they know.

414
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,590
Oh, they did mention that people were like...

415
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,270
...leaving...

416
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,270
...the village.

417
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,710
Ever since that disaster...

418
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,550
...plants and animals alike...

419
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,010
...have lost their figure.

420
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,990
You can make everyone wear a swimsuit soon.

421
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,230
The land itself is starved of runes.

422
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,970
Runes?

423
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,070
Runes?

424
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,570
Simply put...

425
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,570
...the source of all life.

426
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,810
Hmm...

427
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,950
You're so dead.

428
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,790
Looks like it won't bloom this year either.

429
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,330
No!

430
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,470
How tragic.

431
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,350
This is the sacred tree.

432
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,390
Guardian of our village.

433
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:26,810
Oh.

434
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,190
Before the collapse, it gave us gorgeous flowers every year.

435
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,470
I think it's ominous now.

436
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,110
Oh.

437
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,710
That captivating sight earned us another moniker.

438
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,930
Village of ever-blooming flowers.

439
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,510
Unfortunately.

440
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,450
Oh.

441
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,910
Do you really plan to cut it down?

442
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,830
Indeed.

443
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,330
Takumi's inspection revealed that the roots have already begun to rot.

444
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,370
I was gonna say.

445
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,690
It's probably rotting.

446
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,990
Best to remove it before it falls.

447
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,270
And possibly injures someone.

448
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,450
Oh.

449
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,850
How realistic.

450
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:00,970
That's so sad.

451
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,670
This is so...

452
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,710
This is too real.

453
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,430
I'm afraid so.

454
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,250
Like that house.

455
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:14,150
Legend says that a very beautiful buxom deity once called this tree her home.

456
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,730
What a buxom deity.

457
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,990
Not that any of us have laid eyes on her.

458
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,470
Thank you guys for the gifted.

459
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,950
I was barely older than Suzu when this tree last bloomed.

460
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,910
Hey, hey.

461
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,130
A boing boing deity?

462
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,550
So...

463
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:31,870
Wait.

464
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,150
Suzu's just like me for real.

465
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,410
What's a buxom?

466
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,550
Good question.

467
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,850
Some kind of fruit, I think.

468
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,190
It means she got big ol' biddies.

469
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,630
Why you just so casually describe the goddess like that?

470
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,690
What?

471
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,490
I'll say good question.

472
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,350
Aww.

473
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,390
There's Yae.

474
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,210
Yae.

475
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,450
Hello.

476
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,950
Oh.

477
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,070
Goodbye.

478
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,880
And so our population drops again.

479
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,360
Aww, they look so sad.

480
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,420
From what I hear, the rest of Azuma fares little better than our village.

481
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,820
Oh.

482
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,540
I wish her well out there.

483
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,820
Who all is left?

484
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,140
Great guardian.

485
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,880
If you're listening, I hope you recover soon.

486
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,240
And when you do, please bless us with your beautiful flowers again.

487
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,960
Aww, they're so cute.

488
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,160
That does it.

489
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,820
I'll be the one to revitalize our village.

490
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,460
Yeah.

491
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,400
Yeah, you.

492
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,180
I'll convince plenty of customers to visit my tea shop and try the best Dongo in us.

493
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,420
Dango!

494
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,760
That's the spirit.

495
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,800
Let me help.

496
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,440
Oh, yeah.

497
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,140
We got...

498
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,220
She's our booth babe.

499
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,060
Yeah.

500
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,360
Oh, yeah.

501
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,800
Something's bothering Suzu.

502
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,100
I should ask her about it.

503
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,800
Main quest.

504
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,780
Talk to Suzu.

505
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,480
But what if I want to explore just a little bit?

506
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:21,780
Okay.

507
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,000
Just a little.

508
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,520
Let's...

509
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,020
Let's look around the village a bit.

510
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,980
Can I break this?

511
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,740
I got some more weeds.

512
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,980
Why are they keeping that in the box?

513
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,520
Wait.

514
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,220
Wait.

515
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm collecting medicinal herbs.

516
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,220
Oh, gosh.

517
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,220
I love just hoarding plants.

518
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,680
You know?

519
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,420
Where did these come from?

520
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,180
I just took...

521
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,340
I just swept this morning.

522
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,980
Give me plants.

523
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,880
Give me...

524
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,340
Oh, yeah.

525
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,300
Oh, yeah.

526
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,140
Give me the collectibles.

527
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,430
Green grass.

528
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,660
She's just...

529
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,440
Literally on her hands and knees.

530
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,920
Just picking little blades of grass.

531
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,480
You got this, Minto.

532
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,880
Touch grass.

533
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,020
Oh, wow.

534
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,460
Our turnips.

535
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,820
Days until harvested.

536
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,220
Okay, we'll get them tomorrow.

537
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,140
Ah.

538
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,400
Sorry.

539
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,200
I yawn.

540
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,300
Not because I'm bored.

541
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,480
But because...

542
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm jet lagged.

543
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,620
How long has that sacred tree watched?

544
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:37,860
Oh.

545
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,580
Oh, sorry.

546
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,300
I can't speak up.

547
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
Oh, I'm on auto still.

548
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,820
The cherry blossoms tend to steal the spotlight.

549
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,620
But the true charm of our little village is that we have a wide variety of beautiful flowers that are always in bloom.

550
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:52,700
Oh.

551
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,580
Yeah.

552
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,080
Well, they were.

553
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,660
This one's in bloom right here.

554
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,020
Like I can hide in...

555
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,720
Oh my gosh.

556
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,420
Wait, can I crouch?

557
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,360
No.

558
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,620
I was gonna say...

559
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,780
I can trick people into saying that I'm like the...

560
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,520
The goddess.

561
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,680
What is this?

562
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,980
Hope you're well.

563
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,760
Thank you.

564
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,860
Yeah.

565
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,580
Yeah.

566
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,100
What a pleasant place.

567
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,380
I always enjoy it here.

568
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,400
With...

569
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,680
What?

570
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,960
With the sunshine and all?

571
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
What do I want for dinner?

572
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,900
That's a good question.

573
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,760
Can I go inside?

574
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,440
Wait, what's this?

575
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,020
Inspect.

576
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,560
You know how it's...

577
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, it's her tea house!

578
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,380
Plus...

579
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,300
6 AM?

580
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,260
The times are the same.

581
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,880
It doesn't matter.

582
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,400
Weekday?

583
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:42,840
Holiday?

584
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,400
Doesn't matter.

585
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,040
I don't think we can go inside yet though.

586
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,700
Oh.

587
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,720
I think sitting here though and...

588
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,420
Drinking the tea Iroha made for me...

589
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,400
Oh, little Jizo.

590
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,160
Inspect.

591
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,420
A Jizo statue.

592
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,880
It is watching over the children perhaps.

593
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,320
Cute.

594
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
What's in here?

595
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,700
I'm going inside.

596
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,120
Oh.

597
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,800
It seems like someone must have been living here until just recently.

598
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Could this have been Yai's house?

599
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:16,760
Oh.

600
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,360
What about you?

601
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,480
No one.

602
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,960
Empty.

603
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,760
What's in here?

604
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,400
Take it.

605
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,600
Come on.

606
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,460
Come on.

607
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,660
Minto slash.

608
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,360
Minto hit.

609
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,060
Minto attack.

610
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,120
I'm going to rock climb.

611
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,420
I can't rock climb.

612
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,140
Wait.

613
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,560
Oh.

614
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,320
Wait, can I...

615
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,800
What's out of here?

616
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,380
Don't...

617
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,560
I do it so that you guys don't do it.

618
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,160
MAN Um hi- Don't...

619
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,660
Don't...

620
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,740
Don't be like me, in theces.

621
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,240
Don't...

622
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,720
implemented.....

623
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,320
Yeah but there's like, a little ledge down there.

624
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,320
It's like, begging to be...

625
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,000
You know?

626
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,740
It's begging to be explored.

627
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,260
I swear it.

628
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,620
I swear it.

629
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
Poor Suzu will always have something on her mind.

630
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,360
Sorry, Suzu, you can't give me...

631
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,200
You can't give me a place to explore, then...

632
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,160
Oh, did we do this too?

633
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,860
Maybe that's why people are leaving the village.

634
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,520
Because we destroy their homes.

635
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,660
Minto the beta tester.

636
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,160
Can you look up at the birds?

637
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,440
Are there birds?

638
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,260
I see no birds.

639
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,780
Wait, I can destroy this.

640
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,920
More weeds!

641
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,920
Thank you for your sacrifice.

642
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,880
Yes, yes.

643
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,500
Wow, this is a fancy house.

644
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,080
What place is this?

645
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,740
This is Sakaki's house.

646
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,100
It's pretty nice.

647
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,780
That's exactly what I said.

648
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,640
And Sakaki's plants.

649
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,440
Surprisingly, he takes rather meticulous care of it.

650
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,560
Thank you for the gift, dude.

651
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,540
Thank you, guys.

652
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,720
Thank you.

653
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,040
Okay, you think I'll die here too?

654
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,140
Wait, can I?

655
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,160
Oh, I can't cut the bamboo.

656
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Do it.

657
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm not chicken.

658
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm no chicken.

659
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,060
Speaking of chicken.

660
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,600
You know what I watched for the first time?

661
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,360
Ever on the plane?

662
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,400
On my way back from Japan?

663
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,240
Hmm?

664
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,640
Is this the carpenter?

665
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,080
Oh, is the carpenter closed?

666
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,680
I suppose they must have left the village.

667
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,520
Dang, we don't even have a carpenter.

668
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,180
John Wick?

669
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,520
Yeah, I watched John Wick.

670
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,520
I already talked about that.

671
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,500
I watched Back to the Future for the first time.

672
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,420
Can you believe it?

673
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,840
I've never watched that movie before.

674
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,060
And Back to the Future 2.

675
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,050
Nah, for the first time.

676
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,760
So, thinking of the chicken.

677
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
No one calls me chicken.

678
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,540
Doesn't seem like anyone's inside.

679
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,500
Could it be abandoned?

680
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,920
Wow.

681
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,380
Sounds like free real estate to me.

682
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,940
Sounds like...

683
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,060
Look at all these open houses.

684
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,340
Alright.

685
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,500
Suzu!

686
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,620
What's on your mind?

687
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,880
What you thinking about, little girl?

688
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:48,900
Quick.

689
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,920
Quick.

690
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,020
Oh.

691
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,060
Uh, it was a...

692
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,080
Cool.

693
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,080
Wait.

694
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,300
Hold on, Suzu.

695
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,240
I gotta get the weeds from the box.

696
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,580
She looks so troubled.

697
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,960
What's wrong?

698
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,300
What's wrong, Suzu?

699
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,040
I think...

700
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,340
I think this is really me.

701
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,400
I think this is really me.

702
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,500
Can I ask a favor?

703
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,720
Go ahead.

704
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
I'll turn auto back on.

705
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,640
So, Lily.

706
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,320
Whenever I play outside the village, I keep seeing this really weird animal.

707
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,200
Weird.

708
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,260
How?

709
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,860
It's round, and white, and fuzzy, and just...

710
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,100
Really weird.

711
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,780
Will you help me look for it?

712
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,100
Pretty please?

713
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,800
Hmm.

714
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,980
Of course.

715
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,960
We must make sure it's not a monster.

716
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,160
Really?

717
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,960
She's so cute.

718
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,880
Let me show you where I usually see it.

719
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,480
Okay.

720
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,860
She's taken off.

721
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,600
Bond strengthened with Suzu.

722
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,200
Oh, I can sprint.

723
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
Wait, that's not...

724
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,680
Oh.

725
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,560
Oh.

726
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,660
Oh.

727
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,560
I saw it around here yesterday.

728
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,680
Bright white, and covered in fluff.

729
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,640
Bright white, and covered in fluff.

730
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,160
Fluff.

731
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,140
A wooly, maybe?

732
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,200
Wooly.

733
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,460
Come this way.

734
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,960
Yeah, sheep, maybe?

735
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,980
Destination marker.

736
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,080
An orange destination marker.

737
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,520
Shows your current goals.

738
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,560
Open the map from the camp menu for a wider overview.

740
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,000
Okay.

741
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,600
Cool.

742
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,060
Um...

743
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,600
Why is the MC scantily clad?

744
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,660
Um...

745
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,980
Because they gave me bathing suit DLC.

746
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:53,220
And it would just be so rude of me not to use it.

747
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,240
Withered grass.

748
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,160
What are you guys doing?

749
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,440
Sorry about Suzu.

750
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,980
She's got a short attention span, so just humor her for a bit, okay?

751
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,660
Okay.

752
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,300
A weird animal in the village.

753
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,120
Can't say I've seen anything of the sort.

754
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,980
Perhaps it hides from all but the innocent eyes of a child.

755
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:19,960
Oh, wow.

756
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,020
It could be you, Grandpa.

757
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,240
Your hair is white.

758
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,140
What if it's him?

759
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,940
Who are you?

760
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,080
My stomach's gnawing on my spine?

761
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,280
I should probably get some dinner.

762
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,120
I've never heard that expression ever once in my afterlife ever.

763
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:39,780
What?

764
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,820
My stomach's gnawing on my spine.

765
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,460
That's so metal.

766
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,360
Oh.

767
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,120
We got a lumber.

768
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,180
I saw it here two days ago.

769
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,680
He's all real Greek.

770
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,260
I think.

771
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,100
It had super big horns.

772
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,300
Curvy ones.

773
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,160
Orange.

774
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,820
She's cute, so it's fine.

775
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,160
True.

776
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,660
Horns?

777
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,700
That it can't be a wooly.

778
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,840
Maybe a buffamoo?

779
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,140
Buffamoo.

780
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,940
Not here, either.

781
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,260
Let's go this way next.

782
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,540
Is this a gacha game?

783
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:17,900
No.

784
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,040
Hmm.

785
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,120
Hmm.

786
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,280
Just anime.

787
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,700
Just this way.

788
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,780
Delicious spine.

789
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,240
Okay, there's no fall damage, maybe.

790
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,140
I saw it around here three days ago.

791
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,820
I gasped real loud.

792
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,340
Which must have scared it, because then it flew away.

793
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:42,720
Flew?

794
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,620
It can fly?

795
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,220
Okay.

796
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,420
Flying rules out buffamoo.

797
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,800
Thank you so much for the fight.

798
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,780
Good to take you.

799
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,840
This is a monster I've never seen before.

800
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh.

801
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,620
Look at, look at Suzu's face.

802
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,140
I can't find it anywhere.

803
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,180
Hey, he's so cute.

804
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,720
But I know I saw it, I swear.

805
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,160
Thank you.

806
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,240
I believe you.

807
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
Do you want to keep looking?

808
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,060
Suzu?

809
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,660
Time to come inside.

810
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,480
Iroha's calling me.

811
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,840
I better go home, even if I don't want to give up yet.

812
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,920
It's okay, because we still have tomorrow.

813
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,600
Can we play with me again tomorrow?

814
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,900
Of course.

815
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,140
Meantow.

816
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,680
Yay!

817
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,100
See you then!

818
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,220
See you then.

819
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,480
Say it, I better get some rest back at the dragon shrine.

820
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,140
Okay.

821
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,640
They say all kinds of beasties.

822
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,820
Indeed.

823
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,280
Wait, hold on.

824
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,500
The beasties.

825
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,780
Oh, beasties, get up to mischief at this hour.

826
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,840
So keep an eye out.

827
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,440
Wait a second.

828
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,820
I kind of want to see if I can go outside the gate.

829
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,740
Wait.

830
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,620
What?

831
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,900
It was not this way.

832
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,020
Over here?

833
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:56,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

834
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,920
We're running, we're running, we're running, we're running.

835
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,770
It seems unwise to venture outside right now.

836
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,050
Aw, man.

837
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,690
Nobody ever lets me have fun.

838
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,110
Nobody ever lets me do what I want to do.

839
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:18,990
Wait, where am I?

840
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:19,830
Well, here.

841
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,510
All right.

842
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,550
Time to eepy sleepy.

843
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,190
Ending the day.

844
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,370
Sleeping restores your HP and rune points.

845
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,190
RP.

846
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,020
Staying up too late makes you sleepy.

847
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,860
Gradually draining your HP before you fall unconscious.

848
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,620
Yeah.

849
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,500
It's too real.

850
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,540
Sleep in your bed before this happens.

851
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,820
Wait.

852
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,260
How late can we stay?

853
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,900
I kind of want to...

854
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,420
I want to...

855
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,200
I want to fall unconscious.

856
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,520
We're getting that good sleep then, you know?

857
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,040
I mean, this cute today is...

858
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,500
I mean, this cute today is...

859
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,180
Well?

860
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,300
He...

861
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,960
Heed me.

862
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,500
Turn on auto again.

863
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,160
Heed me.

864
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,500
Please.

865
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,560
If you can hear my voice.

866
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,460
Sounds like...

867
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:36,960
Meantode.

868
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,960
Oh.

869
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,720
Jay Blossom.

870
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,060
Oh.

871
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,520
Wait.

872
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,920
The tree is talking to us.

873
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,720
Where's...

874
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,060
What am I doing outside?

875
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,900
And what am I doing in a bikini?

876
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,220
Why she's pretty.

877
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,820
I'm an earthling.

878
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,900
A great shadow looms over this village.

879
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,300
My life force is all but spent.

880
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,940
It's the Buxom Lady.

881
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,220
I bid you act in my stead.

882
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:13,940
Oh?

883
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,700
Me?

884
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,320
She's the Buxom Lady.

885
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,880
I offer you my stead.

886
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,520
A sacred treasure.

887
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,160
Oh, I see it.

888
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,920
I see it.

889
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,280
Wield its Kamiwaza with your dance.

890
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,260
Not the Kamiwaza.

891
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,980
I'm doing salvation to this village.

892
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,400
I beg of you.

893
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,800
Oh, yeah.

894
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,040
Ooh.

895
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,960
It's a little...

896
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,700
It's a little drum.

897
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,620
The creature.

898
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,460
Hey!

899
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,540
Up and at him, partner.

900
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,160
Come on.

901
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,640
Let's go.

902
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,380
Oh, boy.

903
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,280
Guys.

904
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,520
I kind of...

905
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,820
I kind of hate animal mascots.

906
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,280
Oh.

907
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,780
Oh, but he's really cute, actually.

908
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,520
No.

909
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,980
What are you?

910
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,960
A creature.

911
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,800
Was that called for?

912
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,720
Don't tell me you forgot your own partner.

913
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,200
Wait.

914
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,380
Is that the dragon?

915
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:04,780
Partner?

916
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,840
The dragon turned into...

917
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,180
You're kidding me.

918
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,680
You seriously don't remember?

919
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,800
Oh, well.

920
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,280
Guess it's no surprise you wouldn't recognize me looking like this.

921
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Looking like this.

922
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,140
White.

923
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,500
White.

924
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,200
White.

925
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,640
Fluffy.

926
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,620
Looking like this.

927
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,520
Flying.

928
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,240
You're the weird animal.

929
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,320
Uh-oh.

930
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,080
Excuse me?

931
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,500
Chopper energy.

932
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,060
I'm a dragon.

933
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,360
A descendant of the Mihoshihabaki.

934
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,380
Oh.

935
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,420
I am the ivory one who soars the heavens.

936
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,620
Mokoshiro.

937
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,780
Moko.

938
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,320
Um.

939
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,980
Could you repeat that?

940
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,880
It's the god.

941
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,720
Come on.

942
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm not saying all that again.

943
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,320
Ugh.

944
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,940
Just call me whatever you want.

945
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,740
Dragon's got a weird swimsuit skin.

946
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,600
I don't like Wolby.

947
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,980
Wolby.

948
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,900
Wolby.

949
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,600
That's your best name for the descendants of a dragon god?

950
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,960
You don't like it?

951
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,760
I don't think so.

952
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,260
Fine.

953
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,060
Whatever.

954
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:09,880
Listen.

955
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,180
Whatever.

956
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,280
You and I have a much bigger fish to fry at the moment.

957
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,460
The way he talks.

958
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,780
We've got to track down the black dragon before it drains all the runes from Azuma.

959
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,500
What black dragon?

960
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,740
Ugh.

961
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,380
Let's shave him.

962
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,800
Please tell me you're pulling my leg.

963
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,860
Why else did I make you an earth dancer?

964
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,620
An...

965
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,340
Earth dancer.

966
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,120
Dramatic bars.

967
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,400
An...

968
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,820
Right.

969
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,560
Earth dancer.

970
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,340
And this is that divine instrument from my dream.

971
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,560
Oh.

972
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,740
I'm supposed to use it in some sort of dance.

973
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,820
Oh, yeah.

974
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,900
You remember now.

975
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,520
Great.

976
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,840
There you are.

977
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,980
It's me.

978
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,920
We've got trouble.

979
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,460
Uh-oh.

980
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,060
Some kind of shadowy monster is attacking the village.

981
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:00,580
Uh-oh.

982
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:01,680
No.

983
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm not done talking yet.

984
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:07,540
No.

985
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,740
Dramatic pause.

986
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,880
It's funny with the auto on.

987
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,400
Uh-oh.

988
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:31,320
Well, good thing we don't have to search so far for the black dragon.

989
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,860
It came to us.

990
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,180
Easy peasy.

991
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,060
Game over.

992
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,200
He planted...

993
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,280
Wait.

994
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,640
He just planted his own tree.

995
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,200
It's the one from my dream.

996
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,020
Stop!

997
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,520
That's my turnip!

998
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,120
Oh my god.

999
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,840
A blimp?

1000
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,820
Suddenly.

1001
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,760
Suddenly.

1002
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:02,820
There you are.

1003
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,540
Melo.

1004
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,780
Black dragon spotted.

1005
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,040
Roger.

1006
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,040
Hard port.

1007
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:07,880
Huh?

1008
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,180
Ready and...

1009
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,800
Fire!

1010
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,940
She's cute, yeah!

1011
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,230
The horns!

1012
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,470
Aim for the horns!

1013
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,070
Well, you're gonna tell them their weakness, but you don't even remember what it is.

1014
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:36,970
Oh!

1015
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,070
That's what I said!

1016
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,240
Oh, she's cute!

1017
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:53,820
Oh!

1018
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,600
Look out below!

1019
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,590
Dramatic face.

1020
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,870
She's so pretty.

1021
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,810
She's so, so pretty.

1022
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,790
They're from Room Factory 5!

1023
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:13,810
No kidding?

1024
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,570
Oh my god, she's got...

1025
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,750
She's got horns!

1026
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:21,990
Not exactly.

1027
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,290
She cute.

1028
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,690
She was a baby in the N5 and now...

1029
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,690
Grazie!

1030
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,290
Grazie!

1031
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,830
Oh!

1032
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,670
I see!

1033
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,810
Mamma mia!

1034
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:54,870
Oh!

1035
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:55,690
He's gonna...

1036
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,070
He has his own little intro!

1037
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,210
Mauro!

1038
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:00,930
Mauro!

1039
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,970
Adventurer who sails the skies!

1040
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,010
And this young lady is my traveling companion!

1041
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,930
The esteemed archaeologist...

1042
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,050
Hina!

1043
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,170
Oh!

1044
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,510
You keep saying it wrong!

1045
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,810
It's Hina!

1046
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,110
Hina!

1047
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,100
Hina!

1048
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:19,210
Hina!

1049
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,110
You always insist on calling me Mallow, no?

1050
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,150
Hello?

1051
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,850
That's a nickname!

1052
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,010
Doesn't count!

1053
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,010
Oh!

1054
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,710
Oh my god!

1055
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:33,890
Oh!

1056
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:34,710
She's so cute!

1057
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,110
Mysterious archaeologist...

1058
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,610
Hina!

1059
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,310
She's so stickin' cute!

1060
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,550
When they get so close to the screen, I get doki doki!

1061
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,110
At any rate, that black dragon gave us quite the runaround!

1062
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,110
How did you know it's weakness?

1063
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,390
Uh, lucky guess!

1064
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:51,930
Well, um...

1065
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,970
Well, um...

1066
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,490
Well, um...

1067
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:53,830
Hey!

1068
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,030
Iroha!

1069
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,070
Are you alright?

1070
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:01,830
Yeah!

1071
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,430
Suzu and I are fine!

1072
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,270
But...

1073
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,330
The sacred tree?

1074
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:05,950
Oh no!

1075
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,930
Uh oh!

1076
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,200
Sakaki!

1077
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,820
Ah!

1078
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,800
Thank the gods you're safe!

1079
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,540
What was that black dragon?

1080
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,560
To think it would descend upon our poor little village.

1081
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,180
Uh...

1082
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,000
That dreadful creature has sown calamity across all of Azaman.

1083
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,120
Oh...

1084
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,900
That's...

1085
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,420
They say...

1086
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,600
It spreads blight bloom spores.

1087
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,020
Blight bloom spores.

1088
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,020
Plants that absorb the land's ruins.

1089
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,700
Ew!

1090
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,940
Time to sweep it up!

1091
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,820
The land has been weakened enough already.

1092
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,360
At this rate...

1093
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,100
Oh no!

1094
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,420
I know how to do chores.

1095
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,500
We're still...

1096
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,240
Our sacred tree was caught in the crossfire.

1097
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,240
The damage is too great.

1098
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,080
Our village will never recover.

1099
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,860
We'll never financially recover from this.

1100
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,040
You're cutting it down?

1101
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,120
But...

1102
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,360
If we lose the tree...

1103
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,320
Then...

1104
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,760
We have no choice, child.

1105
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,820
Best to remove it before it harms someone.

1106
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,340
Think of the Taurus.

1107
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,960
Where's the...

1108
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,360
Hm?

1109
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,140
Hm?

1110
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,680
How do I explain this?

1111
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,220
Uh...

1112
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,760
The tree's god spoke to me in my dreams.

1113
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,580
Do we sound like a crazy person?

1114
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,660
Or...

1115
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,000
Let me try something.

1116
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,340
I'll save it, I promise.

1117
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,040
I think we can go full Delulu.

1118
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,800
Let's try going Delulu.

1119
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,800
Huh?

1120
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,740
Well...

1121
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,720
Considering we discussed her...

1122
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,480
I can't say I'm surprised.

1123
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,220
If only I were so lucky.

1124
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,540
I like how his name is actually Wolby.

1125
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,500
Like they just assigned that to him.

1126
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,600
You just...

1127
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:15,940
You just...

1128
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,060
Ditched me.

1129
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,000
Not a thought behind those eyes.

1130
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,040
Just...

1131
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,180
Very well.

1132
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,060
I, the great Wolby...

1133
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,900
Descendant of Mihoshi Habaki...

1134
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,760
Shall impart my wisdom unto you.

1135
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,300
Okay.

1136
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,020
First things first.

1137
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,740
We've gotta heal the land.

1138
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,680
Follow me!

1139
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,080
Easy peasy.

1140
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,740
He looks so excited.

1141
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh!

1142
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,720
Nobody else is coming.

1143
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,440
Come to think of it...

1144
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,280
You said the god gave you an instrument in your dream, right?

1145
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:00,860
Uh huh.

1146
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:01,920
Right.

1147
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,660
She asked me to save this village in her place.

1148
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,260
Then it's time to put that thing to good use.

1149
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,780
The god of spring oversees this village.

1150
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,820
Her domain includes healing and mirth.

1151
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,140
Ooh.

1152
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,880
Let's start by giving these blighted trees a healthy dose of cheer.

1153
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,160
Oh, yeah.

1154
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,920
Okay.

1155
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,320
Receiving a sacred treasure from a god lets you use your rune points.

1156
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:27,660
Oh!

1157
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,820
To perform their unique ability known as a kamiwaza.

1158
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,960
Use the drum dance to heal or spur growth and plant life.

1159
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,940
As well as restore blighted land to its former glory.

1160
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,140
Oh.

1161
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,060
Okay.

1162
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,020
Seemed easy.

1163
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,820
I think.

1164
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,640
Maybe.

1165
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,840
So I go to a tree.

1166
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,500
Prosper.

1167
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,440
Not that.

1168
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,140
We eat.

1169
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,420
And then we equip.

1170
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,640
And then I...

1171
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,260
On to the next.

1172
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:56,700
Oh!

1173
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:57,980
Wow.

1174
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,140
That was really effective.

1175
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,020
What about this one?

1176
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:00,760
No?

1177
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,640
We don't care about that tree?

1178
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,360
We don't care about that one?

1179
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,420
Okay.

1180
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,540
What a mess that black dragon made.

1181
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,120
Uh...

1182
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,620
Oh!

1183
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,220
Wait!

1184
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,900
Did I use all my rune points?

1185
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,500
Snack on this if you run low.

1186
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:18,800
Oh.

1187
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,380
Just let time go by and your rune points will recover on their own.

1188
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:23,880
Okay.

1189
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,360
Oh, I can move during these too.

1190
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,000
I didn't realize.

1191
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,000
I got some pickled turnips.

1192
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:34,980
Delish.

1193
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,680
Open the camp menu and go to inventory.

1194
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,140
Use items.

1195
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:38,580
Okay.

1196
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,120
Or they'll naturally regenerate.

1197
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,220
But it was only like three!

1198
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,380
Why did he get mad at me?

1199
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,380
It worked!

1200
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,920
It was only like three points.

1201
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,360
So dramatic.

1202
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,640
Alright.

1203
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,160
Oof!

1204
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,360
This place was hit pretty hard.

1205
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,380
Get dancing!

1206
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,340
Okay!

1207
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,160
Oh!

1208
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,480
Oh!

1209
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,540
I couldn't see it.

1210
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:02,380
Ooh!

1211
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,390
Um...

1212
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,770
Hmm.

1213
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,170
Nobody has anything to say.

1214
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:12,750
Aww!

1215
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:14,910
Me!

1216
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,420
This...

1217
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,620
PRC!

1218
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,200
You're fine!

1219
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:41,920
Oh!

1220
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:42,720
Let's talk to her.

1221
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,980
Look at all the damage it's done this time.

1222
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,060
We couldn't do enough to stop it.

1223
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,080
Oh!

1224
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,600
Can I take it?

1225
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,240
Take their boat?

1226
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,960
Oh, wait.

1227
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,560
I can.

1228
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,440
I can inspect it.

1229
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,080
Mauro's airship.

1230
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,380
Attempted to sneak a ride.

1231
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:08,740
See how?

1232
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,420
That's what I'm saying.

1233
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,760
We should.

1234
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,680
We can.

1235
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,260
With stopping us.

1236
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:13,640
Truly.

1237
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,480
And...

1238
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,640
Looting and plundering.

1239
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,080
Hmm.

1240
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,880
Gosh, the weed's here.

1241
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,880
No.

1242
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,680
Sticking away.

1243
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,840
I swept.

1244
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,660
Literally.

1245
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,840
Just yesterday.

1246
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:38,330
I can see Sakaki turning into Master Roshi.

1247
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:39,930
Right.

1248
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,790
Okay, let's get this tree.

1249
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:47,830
And collect this plant.

1250
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,830
Orange grass.

1251
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:51,990
Oh, interesting.

1252
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,810
The sacred tree's roots probably reach every corner of this village.

1253
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,530
We've gotta help it out by reviving the earth first.

1254
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,030
Okay.

1255
00:54:59,610 --> 00:54:59,970
There.

1256
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,690
That oughta perk things right up.

1257
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,550
Let's head back to the sacred tree.

1258
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,690
It already looks so much better.

1259
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:07,930
Like, it already...

1260
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,430
It's looking way better.

1261
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,610
What was gonna be built here, I wonder?

1262
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,330
Okay, back to the sacred tree.

1263
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,790
Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.

1264
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:19,650
What?

1265
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,590
What's this?

1266
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:23,330
Oh.

1267
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,510
More grass.

1268
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:25,930
Okay.

1269
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,130
Now for the finishing touch.

1270
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,890
Use the dance of bonds to restore power to the god.

1271
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:32,910
Hold on.

1272
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,450
Do you see?

1273
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,930
How much grass is around here?

1274
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:39,630
Ugh.

1275
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:40,870
Chores.

1276
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,910
Okay, I was gonna say, it's not this.

1277
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:46,670
This is the dance.

1278
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:47,190
Or...

1279
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,070
This is the bonds.

1280
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,130
Yeah, dance of bonds.

1281
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:50,450
Eka!

1282
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,710
So quiet.

1283
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:08,490
Just watchin'.

1284
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,330
I offer these humble words.

1285
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,290
Great entity which dwells within this tree.

1286
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,490
May your divine glory shine forth and bless us all forevermore!

1287
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,680
May your divine glory and your divine buxom.

1288
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:22,450
What?

1289
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,250
Amazing!

1290
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:23,350
Amazing!

1291
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,410
Ooh!

1292
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,890
Seeing so many!

1293
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,270
Oh, she's so cute.

1294
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,350
So pretty!

1295
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,270
It's so pretty!

1296
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:36,930
Spud.

1297
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,010
Diferous.

1298
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,270
Is that...

1299
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,850
What I think it is?

1300
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:43,570
I knew it.

1301
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,810
The gods must have sent you to us for a reason.

1302
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:48,210
I...

1303
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,750
I barely did anything.

1304
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,430
Like, you've just bloomed the tree that hasn't bloomed in 50 years!

1305
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,830
No?

1306
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,750
Yours truly!

1307
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,730
And you are...

1308
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:58,950
Ah!

1309
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,930
And the ivory one who soars the heavens!

1310
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,170
Mokoshiro!

1311
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:04,850
Descendant...

1312
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:05,450
Of...

1313
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,670
Bihoshi Havati!

1314
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:08,910
Nickname...

1315
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:09,490
Woolby!

1316
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,930
Lord Woolby!

1317
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:13,210
Lord Woolby!

1318
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:13,530
Lord Woolby!

1319
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:17,690
You both have my deepest gratitude for your tireless efforts.

1320
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,070
Oh!

1321
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:18,090
Oh!

1322
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:18,410
Oh!

1323
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:18,930
There she is!

1324
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,130
She's gracing us!

1325
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,370
With her presence!

1326
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:25,910
Wow!

1327
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,710
He was a...

1328
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:30,230
Peaceful god of spring and mirth...

1329
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:31,530
Ulalaka!

1330
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:33,690
Wait...

1331
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:34,730
Is she...

1332
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,190
Can...

1333
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,650
Can we also...

1334
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:37,030
Wait...

1335
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,550
The bull...

1336
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:38,950
Wow!

1337
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:41,870
Um...

1338
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,630
I'm a fan.

1339
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:46,530
Yes?

1340
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,970
Oh no...

1341
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,010
How glad I am to meet you in person.

1342
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:58,210
From within this tree, I preside over Azuma's springtime and merriment.

1343
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,650
My followers call me the joyful elegance of spring.

1344
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,550
You may address me as Ulalaka.

1345
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:05,760
Ulalaka!

1346
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:07,370
Ulalaka!

1347
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,430
Divine Ulalaka!

1348
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:09,950
Forgive my influence!

1349
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,610
I had no idea you truly resided within this tree.

1350
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,090
Ulalaka!

1351
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:21,110
I have seen and felt how dearly you care for this village.

1352
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:21,330
Wow!

1353
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,250
How did he know?

1354
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,410
Were I in your position, I surely would have done the same.

1355
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,150
You honor me too greatly.

1356
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,570
How did he know?

1357
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,250
Ulalaka!

1358
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:32,630
Ulalaka!

1359
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,530
Earth dancer.

1360
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,010
Allow me to thank you once again.

1361
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,490
You're welcome.

1362
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,790
In fact, might I borrow the drum I bestowed upon you?

1363
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:46,570
Oh.

1364
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:47,310
Yeah.

1365
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,330
There you go.

1366
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:48,690
Oh.

1367
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,990
It's the exact same.

1368
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,710
I have released the sacred treasure's inner power.

1369
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,250
Oh.

1370
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,430
Your drum dance should be more effective now.

1371
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:00,810
Ooh.

1372
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,190
Her JP Seiyu is one of my favorite.

1373
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,430
I'm very curious what she sounds like in Japanese.

1374
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:06,910
I lost much of my divine strength along with my runes.

1375
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,730
Please, Earth dancer.

1376
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,410
I ask that you save Azuma in my stead.

1377
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,590
Restore spring to this village.

1378
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,350
And to the land itself.

1379
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:20,270
Hmm.

1380
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,310
That's above my pain grade.

1381
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:24,790
Wait.

1382
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,630
Will we get paid?

1383
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,490
That's a God-given request.

1384
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,670
You're not really going to turn her down, are you?

1385
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,150
I'm asking too.

1386
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,290
Please, save our village.

1387
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,110
Please.

1388
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:44,890
Oh.

1389
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:48,650
I'm not sure how much I can do.

1390
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,490
But I'll give it my best effort.

1391
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:54,150
I'm gonna look up what her Japanese voice actress is.

1392
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:56,410
Oh.

1393
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:56,970
Wait.

1394
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:57,750
Great going.

1395
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,590
You've unlocked the power of...

1396
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,110
Ooh la- Ooh la la...

1397
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:01,190
Ooh la la...

1398
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:02,210
...goes sacred treasure.

1399
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,970
Still, you can't use everything it's capable of right away.

1400
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,310
Ha ha ha.

1401
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:09,930
So pretty.

1402
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,010
The more you use it, the better you'll handle it.

1403
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,230
Keep that up and you can eventually draw out all its latent power.

1404
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:15,950
Wow.

1405
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:17,710
Wow.

1406
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:19,650
That might be...

1407
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:19,870
Sorry.

1408
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,850
I didn't mean for that angle.

1409
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:21,890
I was looking at him.

1410
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:22,770
Ha ha ha.

1411
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:26,840
Sorry.

1412
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,520
Sorry.

1413
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,060
That might be a little hard to wrap our head around.

1414
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,820
Which is why we have the handy dandy skill tree.

1415
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:34,920
Ooh.

1416
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,320
There's a skill tree.

1417
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:36,580
All right.

1418
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,900
They just called it what it is.

1419
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,340
Since we're all...

1420
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,660
Since we're here and all, why don't we try drawing out some of its power right now?

1421
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,760
Go to the drum dance skill tree and unlock the shock wave skill.

1422
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,500
Ha ha.

1423
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:56,720
Unlocking nodes in a skill tree lets you learn new techniques and increase your stats.

1424
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,300
Unlocking nodes with XP.

1425
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,680
Which you can earn by performing a variety of different actions.

1426
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:15,930
Nice.

1427
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,150
Use the shock wave from the drum dance to stop enemies on their tracks.

1428
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:20,790
Press...

1429
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:24,050
Press right click repeatedly to increase its impact.

1430
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,590
Ha ha ha.

1431
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,610
Ha ha.

1432
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,070
Okay, hold on.

1433
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:31,790
I was gonna look up.

1434
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:32,930
Hey.

1435
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:33,810
Maybe we should go talk.

1436
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,950
And ask the village chief Sakaki.

1437
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:36,930
Wait a second.

1438
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,470
Oh my gosh.

1439
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,310
He's already...

1440
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,230
On my butt.

1441
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,790
Okay.

1442
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:43,710
Ooh.

1443
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:44,850
Wait.

1444
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:45,750
Rune Factory.

1445
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:50,810
Wait.

1446
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,950
I'll try and avoid spoilers, obviously.

1447
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,090
I won't read anything.

1448
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,290
I just want to see what are...

1449
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,150
Who are voice actresses in Japanese?

1450
01:01:59,010 --> 01:01:59,150
Oh.

1451
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,840
Reina Ueda.

1452
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,410
Yes, yes, yes.

1453
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,890
Yes, yes, yes.

1454
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,100
Yes, yes, yes.

1455
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,220
Yes, yes, yes.

1456
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,600
I looked it up.

1457
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,540
Okay.

1458
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,040
Anyway.

1459
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,580
Now I kind of want to look up everybody.

1460
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,620
Could that power be?

1461
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,300
No.

1462
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,640
I'll have to research this further.

1463
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:42,860
Wait.

1464
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,160
Now everybody can move back.

1465
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,280
Yae chose the wrong day to move, huh?

1466
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,840
What a bozo.

1467
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,120
Wait.

1468
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,260
It's sparkling even.

1469
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:53,500
Cute.

1470
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,320
What a dummy.

1471
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,160
All he had to do was wait one more day.

1472
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,840
And it would have been all good.

1473
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,580
This guy wasted no time to read his book.

1474
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,120
Good morning.

1475
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:13,260
He comes over and laughs at me and reads his book.

1476
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,620
The older I get, the earlier my mornings become.

1477
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,440
Ah, well.

1478
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,580
The early bird gets the worm, after all.

1479
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,160
What is with old people and waking up early, huh?

1480
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,820
What is that?

1481
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,460
Good morning.

1482
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,400
Oh my gosh.

1483
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,800
You guys, I'm so sorry.

1484
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,240
I already slept so much last night.

1485
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,880
I went to bed at 10pm.

1486
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,320
The sun going through the leaves is so pretty.

1487
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,800
I went to bed at 10pm.

1488
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,960
And then...

1489
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,320
And then I woke up at 11pm.

1490
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,340
And I was like, what time is it?

1491
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,580
Thinking it was like the next day.

1492
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,120
And then I was like, oh, I only slept for one hour.

1493
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,080
Uh oh, I hope I can go back to sleep.

1494
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,440
Then I went back to sleep.

1495
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,260
Then I woke up at 4am.

1496
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,640
And then I was like, oh, I can't sleep.

1497
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,960
I think this is it for me.

1498
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:18,060
And then I stayed up until 6am.

1499
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,260
Then I fell asleep at 6am.

1500
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,560
Then I woke up again at 10am.

1501
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,810
I was like...

1502
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,080
I would wake up every time.

1503
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,460
I'd be like, what...

1504
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,900
What year is it?

1505
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,460
What year is it?

1506
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,880
Oh, golly.

1507
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,340
I'm so jet lagged.

1508
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,420
This is bad.

1509
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,320
Maybe I should have been drinking...

1510
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,630
Maybe I should be drinking tea that has...

1511
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,460
Caffeine.

1512
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,600
Why is she crying?

1513
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,660
Restore spring to this village.

1514
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,080
And to the land itself.

1515
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:03,520
Splendiferous.

1516
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:05,740
Mauro.

1517
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:07,660
Oh, what a beautiful sight.

1518
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,800
My trip to Azuma was worth it for that alone.

1519
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,000
Thanks.

1520
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,500
I'm going to see if there's anything I can do for the village too.

1521
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:17,580
Wow.

1522
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,360
The flowers bloomed.

1523
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,420
The god of spring is so cool.

1524
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,000
My living a long life has its perks.

1525
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,620
The legends about the buxom beauty certainly didn't exaggerate.

1526
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,440
He's blushing.

1527
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,540
He's blushing.

1528
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:35,320
He's blushing.

1529
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,020
Mr. Having witnessed your powers of restoration.

1530
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,680
I'd like to ask you a favor.

1531
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,260
Minto.

1532
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:42,300
I don't know.

1533
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:48,080
Would you consider taking my place as chief and revitalizing our village?

1534
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,460
That's a huge ask.

1535
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,260
Everyone here knows you.

1536
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,520
You're still on the plane.

1537
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:53,260
If you need any help.

1538
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,940
Everyone here knows you, yeah like all three people.

1539
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,520
You're acting like this is a... this is a real village.

1540
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:10,580
This is... Of course, I would hope all three people know who I am.

1541
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,040
What do you say?

1542
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:19,480
Do I have a choice or... I'd love to.

1543
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,180
What are your calling in life?

1544
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,560
I... I wouldn't go that far.

1545
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:29,660
Wonderful.

1546
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,980
My sincerest thanks.

1547
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,700
You've taken a load off my shoulder.

1548
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,320
Gramps is gonna go retire.

1549
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:36,860
Now then.

1550
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,280
I shall entrust our village's future.

1551
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,440
He's like finally a way out.

1552
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,240
We'll take good care of it.

1553
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,340
And Woobie is just... Wait, where is he going?

1554
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:49,920
Wait.

1555
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:50,840
Guess what?

1556
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,820
I've got a little present for you.

1557
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,140
Oh?

1558
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:54,740
Do you tell?

1559
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,120
What's this?

1560
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,760
It's like now you can form!

1561
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,620
Proof that you're a true earth dancer.

1562
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,260
A terra-tiller.

1563
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,920
A terra-tiller.

1564
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:15,280
With this, you can till new fields, grow crops, and develop the village as you please.

1565
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,020
The terra-tiller is my sacred treasure.

1566
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:25,760
So just like with Ulalaka's drum, you'll choose it from the list of sacred treasures in your inventory.

1567
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,220
Okay.

1568
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:27,520
Got it?

1569
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,060
Good.

1570
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,760
Now let's farm!

1571
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,020
Let's farm!

1572
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,440
Oh my gosh.

1573
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,380
It's a reward.

1574
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,000
Head to the development zone.

1575
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:41,580
Wow.

1576
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:44,780
Whoa!

1577
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:45,440
Whoa!

1578
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,840
Did she see that?

1579
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:50,000
Ulalaka-sama?

1580
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,020
Huh?

1581
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,340
She says these turnips suck.

1582
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,340
Woobie's like, first is village, then the world.

1583
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,360
She's so pretty.

1584
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,900
Sounds like a job for the new head honcho.

1585
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:18,580
Yes.

1586
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,900
She's right there.

1587
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,400
I think she could hear her get a whisper.

1588
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,920
And I hate seeing Ulalaka so sad.

1589
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,200
Spoken like a true earth dancer.

1590
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,580
I've already prepared everything you need.

1591
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,020
So let's hop to it.

1592
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:32,500
Okay.

1593
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,560
Uh...

1594
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,320
First things first, we've got to do something about the mess.

1595
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:38,620
Okay.

1596
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,120
Let's clear out everything that's in the way and make some farmland.

1597
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,120
That'll give us a place to grow some great eats.

1598
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,560
Two birds with one stone.

1599
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,240
Oh yeah.

1600
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:50,380
So...

1601
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,960
Equipping the Terra Tiller.

1602
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,260
We'll switch you to village builder mode.

1603
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:55,760
Wait.

1604
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,600
Can I build anywhere?

1605
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,400
With the Terra Tiller equipped, you can hold...

1606
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,740
Is that shift?

1607
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,680
To remove any unneeded objects.

1608
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:06,420
Let's try it.

1609
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,960
Fields are...

1610
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,780
But one type of terrain tile.

1611
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,940
If you want to grow crops, you'll need to place field tiles first.

1612
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,700
Remember that.

1613
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,460
Our Terra Tiller.

1614
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,160
First, we've got to clean up the place.

1615
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:23,900
So like this.

1616
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,800
And the rocks.

1617
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:29,880
Wait.

1618
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,700
Oh my god.

1619
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,160
Much better.

1620
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,880
If one fell swoop.

1621
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,340
Yes.

1622
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:41,700
Let's place some fields.

1623
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:42,400
Okay.

1624
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:44,880
Press...

1625
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,690
What do you think that...

1626
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:52,290
That is?

1627
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,890
What is that button?

1628
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,460
Tab?

1629
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,720
Okay.

1630
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,000
Press tab.

1631
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:03,800
Maybe.

1632
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,080
To bring up the building menu here, select what you want to place.

1633
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,640
Then press F in the spot.

1634
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,460
You want to place it.

1635
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:09,700
Okay.

1636
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,220
Okay.

1637
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:11,640
Tab.

1638
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,620
Trusting you guys.

1639
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,480
Oh, it is.

1640
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,750
And we buy three...

1641
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,250
Oops.

1642
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,330
I missed a spot.

1643
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,390
You've done this before, haven't you?

1644
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,690
I guess you wouldn't remember.

1645
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:34,490
All right.

1646
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,850
We'll plant some seeds next.

1647
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,330
Here.

1648
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,310
Take these turnip seeds.

1649
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,230
It's best to start with the basics.

1650
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,250
Let's plant those suckers.

1651
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,470
No, they're turnips.

1652
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,870
Use F to plant seeds while facing a field.

1653
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:53,370
Sorry.

1654
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,250
Some people are probably...

1655
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,130
Screaming at me like...

1656
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:57,490
Minto!

1657
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,030
Uh...

1658
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,610
So then do I E again?

1659
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,410
No.

1660
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:04,770
Oh, tab.

1661
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,130
Turnip.

1662
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:07,670
F.

1663
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,150
That's all I need to do.

1664
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,610
I don't need to water them or anything.

1665
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:13,990
Okay.

1666
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,530
The first step to a green thumb.

1667
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:15,770
Oh.

1668
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,550
I spoke too soon.

1669
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,150
We're gonna be rich, baby.

1670
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:22,530
Yeah!

1671
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,550
We're gonna be rich!

1672
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:25,430
Water your fields daily.

1673
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,770
Your seeds and crops won't grow without water.

1674
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,970
Neglect them for too long or they just might wither away.

1675
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:32,770
Press F.

1676
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:36,900
Okay.

1677
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:37,580
Not bad!

1678
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,580
You can switch other characters to swimsuit too if you want to.

1679
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,260
It unlocks at the start of the game.

1680
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,340
It might be unlocked right now.

1681
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,620
Wait, ow!

1682
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,260
We'll go...

1683
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:48,420
We'll go...

1684
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,000
After this, we'll go to the temple and see.

1685
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,300
To the...

1686
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,040
Wardrobe.

1687
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:52,660
Alright!

1688
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,480
Oh, it's time for the harvest.

1689
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,500
Just great.

1690
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,180
Maybe not now, seeing as we only just planted them.

1691
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,340
Eventually.

1692
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,100
Oh!

1693
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,680
Look at those turnips!

1694
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,120
See the shriveled up ones?

1695
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,780
And the others that are nearly ready to harvest?

1696
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:10,240
Hey!

1697
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,980
Why don't you plant the turnips, Vituper?

1698
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,780
Maybe the drum dance of yours could revive the former and help the latter finish growing.

1699
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:20,480
Oh...

1700
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,360
Use the drum dance.

1701
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,280
I was thinking that too.

1702
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,040
I was like, what if we use the drum to...

1703
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,540
To...

1704
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,560
Help them grow.

1705
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,380
The dance will only work on one...

1706
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,860
On each target once per day.

1707
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,220
Also used to revive withered crops.

1708
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:36,560
Okay.

1709
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,580
Use F...

1710
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,340
F to...

1711
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,200
Harvest fully grown crops.

1712
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,380
They'll even produce...

1713
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:43,940
Saints.

1714
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:45,360
Okay.

1715
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,400
My drum.

1716
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,300
Alright.

1717
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:51,660
Huh!

1718
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,700
Oh!

1719
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,660
Wow, that was extremely effective.

1720
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,580
Wait, I thought it was only just...

1721
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:01,940
Cute!

1722
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:02,760
Okay.

1723
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:03,600
Wow!

1724
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,560
That's so nice that you don't have to let...

1725
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,380
It has a range, obviously, but...

1726
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:11,080
It's so nice that you don't have to do it one at a time.

1727
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,360
Oh my goodness.

1728
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:13,740
Oh...

1729
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,120
That's a nice haul.

1730
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:15,660
Hmm?

1731
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,120
And you got some seeds.

1732
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:17,800
Uh...

1733
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,900
You'll get seeds when...

1734
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,100
When harvesting crops.

1735
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,980
That's important info right there, so make sure to remember.

1736
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:23,340
Yes!

1737
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,580
Now we gotta...

1738
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,100
Ship them?

1739
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,940
What do you mean, ship them?

1740
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,280
Ship till you drop.

1741
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,660
Wait, what do you mean we're shipping them?

1742
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,140
Oops.

1743
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,760
At least water's free.

1744
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,420
Wait, uh...

1745
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,060
So then...

1746
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,000
If I...

1747
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,520
Tab...

1748
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:47,620
No.

1749
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:49,400
E...

1750
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:50,920
Tiller...

1751
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,780
Tab...

1752
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,360
Seed.

1753
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,200
Let's replant.

1754
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,220
Let's replant.

1755
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,220
Oh, this is so cozy.

1756
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,280
It's making me sleepy.

1757
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:05,120
I mean, I was already sleepy, but...

1758
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,040
Like, water...

1759
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,900
Water...

1760
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,120
Water...

1761
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,280
Water...

1762
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:09,460
Water...

1763
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,200
Water...

1764
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,320
Water...

1765
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,240
And...

1766
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,680
Water the middle.

1767
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,060
Okay.

1768
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,580
That's what we're talking about.

1769
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,980
Let's go to...

1770
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,340
The shrine up here?

1771
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,580
Hey!

1772
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,860
Enough messing around!

1773
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,680
Wait!

1774
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,740
They won't let me.

1775
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:35,400
I just wanna see if I can put everybody in swimsuits!

1776
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:36,860
Um...

1777
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,500
Put the turnips in the shipping shed.

1778
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,320
Over here.

1779
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,060
Oh, I was...

1780
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:41,700
I was...

1781
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,920
They're right next to it!

1782
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,760
All of them?

1783
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,120
Split quantity.

1784
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:51,700
There we go.

1785
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,830
Hehe.

1786
01:14:59,190 --> 01:14:59,410
Oh.

1787
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,070
There we go.

1788
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:08,250
Okay.

1789
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,670
Yeah!

1790
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:11,830
We'll keep some turnips for ourselves.

1791
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:12,210
Alright.

1792
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,950
Okay.

1793
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:17,570
Um...

1794
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:17,750
Good.

1795
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,970
Any items placed in your shipping shed will...

1796
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:22,350
Be...

1797
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:25,870
Sold off automatically by the next morning, Netting you a profit.

1798
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,910
This includes harvested crops.

1799
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,730
So, any item!

1800
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,290
Whatever I want.

1801
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,050
What about all this grass I've got?

1802
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,710
Nice.

1803
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:39,210
Remember, toss anything you want to sell in here.

1804
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:41,030
Once it ships, you'll earn a nice little profit.

1805
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:41,390
Alright!

1806
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,910
Put Woolby in there.

1807
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:44,830
I wish.

1808
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,710
Let's ship him away.

1809
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,970
At least his design is very cute.

1810
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:55,710
We're in the swing of things, so let's keep this ball rolling.

1811
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:56,190
Oh!

1812
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,330
We're out of field tiles already?

1813
01:15:59,530 --> 01:15:59,730
Yes!

1814
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,130
Eh, no sweat.

1815
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,050
We'll make some ourselves.

1816
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:05,610
Uh...

1817
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,910
First, we need the necessary materials.

1818
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:11,770
Since I'm feeling extra generous, I'll provide them just this once.

1819
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:12,710
Leave it to me!

1820
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:15,590
All you gotta do is call me whenever you want to make tiles.

1821
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:16,250
Okay.

1822
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,830
Call Woolby.

1823
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:22,310
To create the various terrain tiles you can use in village builder mode.

1824
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:23,350
Okay?

1825
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,710
I only have to call him.

1826
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,510
Path recipe!

1827
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,690
Oh no.

1828
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,150
Rich soil.

1829
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:35,030
Red soil.

1830
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,150
Red

1831
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,380
soil.

1832
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:41,960
Oh.

1833
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,800
Maybe I don't want to be up this early.

1834
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:45,240
Alright!

1835
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,060
Um...

1836
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,200
No, I think we're good.

1837
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:49,640
Yeah.

1838
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,380
Since he gave me...

1839
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:51,660
What?

1840
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,180
Wait.

1841
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,140
How do I get to it again?

1842
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,840
Terrain tiles?

1843
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,300
Wait, I thought I was gifted them.

1844
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:00,760
Why is...

1845
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,000
Why don't I have anything?

1846
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,080
I don't want the path.

1847
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,660
He gave me...

1848
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,440
Do I have to make it from him first?

1849
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,220
Call Woolby.

1850
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,980
Oh, it's X.

1851
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,240
Yes!

1852
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:19,740
Alright!

1853
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,980
Create terrain tiles.

1854
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,000
So, which do you want to make?

1855
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:24,940
Oh!

1856
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,120
I see, I see.

1857
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,380
Farmland.

1858
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:40,370
Okay.

1859
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:43,290
Um...

1860
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:43,830
Six?

1861
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:44,610
Okay.

1862
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,530
Leave the next bit to me.

1863
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:47,390
Great!

1864
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:50,130
Let's keep working the fields at a steady pace.

1865
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,170
Yes.

1866
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:54,810
A true masterpiece, if I do say so myself.

1867
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:55,290
Alright!

1868
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,870
I'll just do everything I've taught you thus far.

1869
01:17:58,170 --> 01:17:59,450
First, throw down a field.

1870
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,270
Plant some seeds.

1871
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:01,170
All good.

1872
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:02,350
You don't have to harvest them this time.

1873
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:02,970
Here.

1874
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:04,610
More turnip.

1875
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:08,650
I just got turnip seeds.

1876
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:09,070
Okay.

1877
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,930
Let's do this.

1878
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:11,810
Uh...

1879
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:12,890
How...

1880
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:14,870
Oh, here we go.

1881
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:15,670
Building type.

1882
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:17,350
Here we go.

1883
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,030
Terrain tiles.

1884
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,590
Okay.

1885
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,230
Place.

1886
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:22,670
Okay.

1887
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,050
Place.

1888
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:25,690
Okay, okay.

1889
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:26,410
Place.

1890
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,690
Oh no, I'm gonna be uneven again.

1891
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:33,850
Um...

1892
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,470
No!

1893
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,040
And seed.

1894
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,680
How do you guys usually do this?

1895
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,380
Are you like a water first then plant?

1896
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,400
Or a plant first then water?

1897
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,220
That's what I'm talking about.

1898
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,280
Oh.

1899
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:55,980
Oh my goodness.

1900
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,660
Thank you so much, Earth Dancer.

1901
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,100
Excellent.

1902
01:18:59,220 --> 01:18:59,580
I skipped it.

1903
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:01,960
Plant first.

1904
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:02,520
Yes.

1905
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:03,600
Then water.

1906
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,860
This might just be enough.

1907
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:10,190
Ah.

1908
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:11,150
Cute.

1909
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:14,710
What happened?

1910
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,200
Our village leveled up!

1911
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:20,680
Oh.

1912
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,820
I feel like I just got a huge boost of energy.

1913
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,940
Ulalaka's granted you her blessing.

1914
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:27,680
Proof?

1915
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:29,700
Positive that her divinity's back.

1916
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,240
Wow.

1917
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:31,340
Wow.

1918
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,240
Thank you, Ulalaka.

1919
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,360
Ulalaka.

1920
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,860
I have another request, Earth Dancer.

1921
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,460
If you could spare the time...

1922
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,560
Would you help me revitalize the village?

1923
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,840
Everybody's asking me to revitalize the village.

1924
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,580
Allowing me to assist you even further.

1925
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,920
I think I already said yes, no?

1926
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:53,340
Has the new village chief?

1927
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,740
It would be my pleasure.

1928
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm gonna eat a...

1929
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,920
A...

1930
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,820
Voicemint.

1931
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,560
I can't express how relieved I am to have an Earth Dancer like you.

1932
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:01,760
Sorry, I have to hear me.

1933
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,120
Eating it.

1934
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:04,820
Hmm.

1935
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,800
Creating fields and growing crops will revitalize the village, raising its village level.

1936
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:12,740
Hmm.

1937
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,680
As the village level increases, the god that watches over the village will regain their divinity...

1938
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,700
And reward you with new blessings.

1939
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,240
Speak to the god when the village is ready to level up.

1940
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:21,960
Hmm.

1941
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,440
Time to rest is now available.

1942
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,800
Um, stop backseating me, Woobie.

1943
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,360
I gotta water the plants.

1944
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,240
Is that not so important?

1945
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,060
And then also...

1946
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,740
Uh, we can use this.

1947
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,380
And...

1948
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:39,660
Drum dance.

1949
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:45,640
Wait.

1950
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:48,240
I can't use it on these because...

1951
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,920
Technically, I already use it on this plot today.

1952
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,520
Even though it's new seeds.

1953
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,600
I'll try it.

1954
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,580
Oh!

1955
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:56,700
Oh!

1956
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:58,700
Just...

1957
01:20:59,400 --> 01:20:59,740
Kidding!

1958
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,540
Mm-hmm.

1959
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,580
Mm-hmm.

1960
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:08,810
Then we can use this...

1961
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,310
To...

1962
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,610
Remove more stuff.

1963
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:13,410
And we'll get...

1964
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,930
We get soil for this.

1965
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:16,190
And soil...

1966
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:19,070
Allows us to do more fields, I believe.

1967
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:21,410
Oops.

1968
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,280
I messed up.

1969
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:27,900
Uh...

1970
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,580
Uh...

1971
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,120
What will the people do?

1972
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:38,940
Um...

1973
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:42,990
Uh...

1974
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:47,960
How much money do I have?

1975
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,680
Okay.

1976
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:51,700
Ugh!

1977
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,280
Chad's broken.

1978
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,330
Oh, I think it is.

1979
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:02,730
Hold on.

1980
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:04,430
One moment.

1981
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:06,210
I'll rescue you guys.

1982
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,800
Maybe I can't rescue you guys.

1983
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,660
And redo.

1984
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,380
Uh...

1985
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:23,920
There you go.

1986
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:24,280
Okay.

1987
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,480
What was this?

1988
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,720
Ooh, secrets.

1989
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:33,540
Profiles.

1990
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,440
View a character's profile to check their likes and dislikes.

1991
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,200
Okay.

1992
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,920
What do you like, Iroha?

1993
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:43,940
Ooh, nothing.

1994
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,740
What?

1995
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,720
Mm-hmm.

1996
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,660
I see.

1997
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,560
Ah-ha-ha!

1998
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,660
You've grown closer to Iroha.

1999
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,600
Your bod boosts Iroha's taunt skill?

2000
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,500
Interesting.

2001
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:10,070
Meh.

2002
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:13,290
So I guess these guys are romance-able.

2003
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,170
Because they're in red.

2004
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:17,190
And then, they're like...

2005
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,570
You can't even eat with the grandpa!

2006
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:20,250
Sad.

2007
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,790
Iroha has a tank.

2008
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,630
Is that what it said?

2009
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,350
Did I miss that?

2010
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,740
Where do you see that?

2011
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,120
Where do you see that?

2012
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,860
Oh, because of taunt.

2013
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh, yeah.

2014
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,040
I guess that makes sense, huh?

2015
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,460
Mm-hmm.

2016
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:49,060
Oh, wait.

2017
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,620
We can see his skill.

2018
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,780
He doesn't have any.

2019
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,680
I don't think Kino does either.

2020
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:54,940
Nope.

2021
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,330
Okie dokie.

2022
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:02,950
We...

2023
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,670
We have...

2024
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:05,710
Farmed.

2025
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:07,950
We've danced.

2026
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:10,470
We've...

2027
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,710
Romanced.

2028
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,540
Grandpa?

2029
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:18,360
Oh.

2030
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,280
You...

2031
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,700
You've taken to a ravaged lands with such haste.

2032
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,760
I will gladly join you, but with my back the way it is...

2033
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,600
Well, I'm sure you understand.

2034
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,440
Hmm...

2035
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,360
Did all of this happen in one day?

2036
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,940
It's a crazy day.

2037
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,240
I would be exhausted.

2038
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,080
You think I can...

2039
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,300
Revitalize this tree?

2040
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:54,780
Nope.

2041
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,600
It was born this way.

2042
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,720
It was born sad and...

2043
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,720
Stickly.

2044
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,640
Quick send support.

2045
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,600
It's not broken!

2046
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,180
Anymore.

2047
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,820
When are we gonna fix that hole in the roof?

2048
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,620
Are there no carpenters in this village or what?

2049
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,200
Um...

2050
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,600
Well, you know...

2051
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,620
That's a good point.

2052
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,730
Inventory management.

2053
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:31,210
Okay.

2054
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,190
Let's see if this works.

2055
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:38,900
No way.

2056
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:51,540
The...

2057
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,000
The books of...

2058
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,780
Deity.

2059
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:00,300
Wowee.

2060
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,060
Wowee.

2061
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:02,820
Wowee.

2062
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:05,420
Wait.

2063
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,740
I don't know if I can look at this.

2064
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,600
Isn't it so cute?

2065
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,280
What is that on her arm?

2066
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:14,720
What is that?

2067
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,700
It's like a little mochi.

2068
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,420
With her swimsuit.

2069
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:18,380
So cute!

2070
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:24,410
Wowee!

2071
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,310
Fluffy tail.

2072
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:28,510
Like a floatie.

2073
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:29,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2074
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:31,770
Like a mochi floatie or something.

2075
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:32,570
It's so cute.

2076
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,620
He's got one too, but...

2077
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,500
Oh, it's a bird.

2078
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,740
Pirate King over here.

2079
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,000
Yay!

2080
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,220
Now we can all feel normal because...

2081
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,040
Everybody's in a swimsuit!

2082
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,980
You just imagine the audience...

2083
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:55,740
In a swimsuit.

2084
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,180
And you don't feel so nervous anymore.

2085
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,160
Exactly!

2086
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:14,940
Yeah!

2087
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,260
Everybody's naked!

2088
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:17,940
Okay.

2089
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,200
Oh, and then this shows us what our...

2090
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,980
What our quests are.

2091
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,320
Hold on, let's get rid of this.

2092
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,680
I'm one of those types of people that...

2093
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,940
That, like, has to...

2094
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,520
Not check off, but if there's like a...

2095
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,800
If there's like a little...

2096
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,060
Notification, I gotta get rid of it.

2097
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:38,760
You know what I mean?

2098
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:40,580
Okay.

2099
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,420
Time to rest.

2100
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,380
What else was there?

2101
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,020
What's in here?

2102
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,280
Oh, here's the skill tree.

2103
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:46,260
Oh.

2104
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,220
What is this?

2105
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,100
We'll never know.

2106
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,240
Oh, here we go.

2107
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,340
Kagura Dance Flower Blessings.

2108
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,260
Surround the user with an aura that gradually heals all allies.

2109
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:03,040
Okay.

2110
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,360
Also brings wither trees back to life, which...

2111
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,700
We do that anyway.

2112
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,400
Bottom right still not in swimsuit.

2113
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,080
Yeah.

2114
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,820
It's not...

2115
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,140
Summer, maybe.

2116
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:18,880
I don't know.

2117
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:23,480
Deals earth damage to all surrounding enemies while healing all allies.

2118
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:24,420
Wait.

2119
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,180
I can't tell which one would be better.

2120
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,670
They both heal.

2121
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:36,630
This one does damage and heals.

2122
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,990
It's June already.

2123
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:42,810
Oh.

2124
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,450
You're so right.

2125
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,030
When is summer?

2126
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:49,650
I'm gonna Google.

2127
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:52,070
When is the first day of summer?

2128
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:04,720
First day of summer.

2129
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,020
June 20th.

2130
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,920
Soon.

2131
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,200
See?

2132
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,000
But it's not summer.

2133
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,740
It's not summer yet.

2134
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,840
It's still spring.

2135
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,120
Silly.

2136
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,840
Silly.

2137
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:29,900
Okay.

2138
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,540
Which one do you guys think?

2139
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:36,460
It...

2140
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:39,960
Mendo.

2141
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,460
Mendo.

2142
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:48,490
I think this one.

2143
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,150
I think we'll do flower storm.

2144
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:53,850
Yes.

2145
01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:59,190
What do I...how do I do this?

2146
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:05,170
Or...left click.

2147
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:05,590
Okay.

2148
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:07,530
Alright.

2149
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:08,230
Cool, cool, cool.

2150
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:12,670
Alright.

2151
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:13,290
Cool, cool, cool.

2152
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,670
Let's sleep.

2153
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,030
Hmm.

2154
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:15,190
Sleep.

2155
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,790
I wish that were... Good night.

2156
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:19,030
I want to sleep so bad right now.

2157
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:22,290
I'm actually...I'm actually fading pretty fast.

2158
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:23,910
Oh!

2159
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,710
Wait, we got 10 points for walking.

2160
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:30,690
When you go to sleep, you'll receive a breakdown of your actions that day.

2161
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:36,450
Each category will be tallied up and you'll earn a cumulative amount of all-purpose experience points.

2162
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:38,590
Oh!

2163
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:40,830
And then we can unlock more stuff.

2164
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,030
Wait, so we have 28 now.

2165
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,390
I didn't faint.

2166
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,210
I didn't faint and I didn't stay up late at all.

2167
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:47,630
Are you so proud of me?

2168
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:52,710
I don't think you should get a penalty for fainting.

2169
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:54,570
I think you should get a doctor's appointment.

2170
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:57,970
Because I don't think that's normal.

2171
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,310
I think you...

2172
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:03,150
Need to go see someone.

2173
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:04,710
Get that checked out.

2174
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:07,710
Very proud.

2175
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:08,650
Yay!

2176
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:09,830
I'm always proud.

2177
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,550
Mmm.

2178
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:11,310
Have a cookie.

2179
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:13,190
Oh, thank you, thank you.

2180
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:17,910
Actually, I have some ice cream I'm gonna eat after stream.

2181
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,230
Harvesting and collecting.

2182
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:22,410
I did a ton of that.

2183
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:23,590
Oh, yeah.

2184
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,230
I did, baby.

2185
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:25,670
Morning!

2186
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:26,510
What should we do?

2187
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:27,970
Wait, today's weather.

2188
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:28,710
Do you see that?

2189
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:33,930
First set of ideas, why don't we go ask Sakaki if we can get help with anything.

2190
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:34,330
Okay.

2191
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,110
Or if we can help with anything.

2192
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:36,450
Okay.

2193
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:40,310
Yeah, my islands are so heavy right now.

2194
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:42,730
Like if I could, I could just sleep right here.

2195
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,930
I could.

2196
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:44,850
But I won't.

2197
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:45,230
Because.

2198
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:47,170
Um.

2199
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,790
That's unprofessional.

2200
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,370
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

2201
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:53,750
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

2202
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:55,250
Gather, gather, gather.

2203
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:56,990
Gather, gather, gather.

2204
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,440
Oh.

2205
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,400
I like the music change.

2206
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,300
No, no, no.

2207
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:07,540
Nothing.

2208
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:11,950
Nothing?

2209
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:12,470
Okay.

2210
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,900
Looking for any...

2211
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,180
Crates to shatter.

2212
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:27,840
Any...

2213
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:28,340
Um.

2214
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,720
Any crates to shatter.

2215
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,080
Any plants to pick up.

2216
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:38,920
Oh, these look...

2217
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,200
Okay, these are definitely gonna be done in like...

2218
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:41,580
Here we go.

2219
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,600
Three, two, one.

2220
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:44,820
Cool!

2221
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,330
Oh, and then we change to this.

2222
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:55,910
That's right.

2223
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,390
Where do we have to?

2224
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:00,830
Actually, now I can't tell.

2225
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:05,910
What if I just turn the whole...

2226
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,690
What if I flatten the whole village...

2227
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,270
And turn it all into turnip fields?

2228
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:11,310
The turnip stonks...

2229
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:12,950
Are going up.

2230
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:16,250
The turnip stonks...

2231
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,170
Are high.

2232
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,570
They're the highest they've ever been.

2233
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,930
Oh, here I am.

2234
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,730
Actually, let me try if it'll work.

2235
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,950
Oh, I know how to equip it.

2236
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,690
Okay, good to know.

2237
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:37,030
Bye, bye, bye!

2238
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:39,870
Absolutely.

2239
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:43,790
With this...

2240
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,130
Remove.

2241
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,920
Remove.

2242
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,460
Remove this giant rock.

2243
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,220
That's all we get is just rock times three.

2244
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,560
Baby needs a new roof.

2245
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:11,820
Look, it's...

2246
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,580
Oh my gosh, there's even so many...

2247
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,000
Who built this...

2248
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,760
Okay, I know this rock was not here...

2249
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,500
After they built the pathway.

2250
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:21,780
This...

2251
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,120
This...

2252
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,280
More weed.

2253
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:26,860
Hi, ghost.

2254
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:27,600
Hello.

2255
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,460
Hello.

2256
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:30,320
Hello.

2257
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:34,300
If you click R3, you can use an overhead view.

2258
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,740
Like this.

2259
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,180
All right.

2260
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,340
We're almost done with...

2261
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,640
Nice.

2262
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:49,260
Okay.

2263
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,580
I'll get these rocks out of the way.

2264
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,120
And then our...

2265
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,900
Little area will be complete.

2266
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:00,630
Oh, it's tea.

2267
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:06,410
Wait, where'd I go?

2268
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:07,730
Minto.

2269
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:09,850
Minto, don't go.

2270
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,060
That is handy.

2271
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,240
That's very handy.

2272
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:23,520
All right.

2273
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,340
Let's replant all of our...

2274
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:27,340
All of our seeds.

2275
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,940
A level two turnip.

2276
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,360
Why do we have that?

2277
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:35,100
Why do we have a level two turnip?

2278
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,500
How curious.

2279
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,080
What makes a turnip level two?

2280
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,320
What makes a turnip...

2281
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,300
Is it a...

2282
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,720
Certain deliciousness you don't get with a...

2283
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,100
Level one turnip?

2284
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:54,340
Like...

2285
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:54,760
Hi, guys.

2286
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:55,840
What is up?

2287
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:57,680
Today, I'm gonna show you...

2288
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,600
This level two turnip.

2289
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,120
And how delicious it is.

2290
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,640
I just did all this stuff in my backyard today.

2291
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,880
I didn't look cute doing it though.

2292
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,060
You have to put on a bikini.

2293
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,220
That's the ultimate...

2294
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,480
That's the reason it would...

2295
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,340
You know, look better.

2296
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:20,800
It's the ultimate weapon.

2297
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:23,740
Trust me.

2298
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,460
Trust me, bro.

2299
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:28,960
Okay.

2300
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:30,560
Oops, oops, oops.

2301
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:39,390
Eh, you are in it.

2302
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:40,610
Okay.

2303
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,290
And then, we can use our drum again.

2304
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,050
Guru!

2305
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,350
Very good.

2306
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:51,670
Guru!

2307
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,650
Wait, we have another bar...

2308
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,830
Underneath our blue bar.

2309
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:56,790
The RP bar.

2310
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:59,030
Is that our X?

2311
01:36:59,230 --> 01:36:59,510
No.

2312
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:00,830
Not XP, maybe.

2313
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:01,330
I don't know.

2314
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:05,310
Smashing like and subscribe for more turnip tips.

2315
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:08,830
Yeah, welcome to turnip town.

2316
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:09,790
Goodbye.

2317
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:10,830
Bye.

2318
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:11,730
Your...

2319
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:12,020
Your...

2320
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:12,930
Favorite...

2321
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:13,570
VTuber.

2322
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:15,870
Mean turnip.

2323
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:18,850
Yeah.

2324
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,110
Wow, we have a...

2325
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:20,870
Oh my god.

2326
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:21,850
We have 110.

2327
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:23,790
Okay, we'll keep...

2328
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:25,730
We'll keep like...

2329
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:26,610
20 of them.

2330
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:28,990
And the rest...

2331
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:33,030
Off it to...

2332
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:36,930
Money land.

2333
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:43,110
Is there a spell for growing turnips?

2334
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,630
Like a Moe Moe Kune style?

2335
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,460
Maybe like a...

2336
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:54,640
Maybe like a...

2337
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,220
Well, I feel like Moe Moe grow.

2338
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:00,500
Hmm.

2339
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,540
I don't think that'd work.

2340
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:09,140
The RP bar is your radish prospects bar.

2341
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,160
Those are my radish points.

2342
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,620
Oh, wait.

2343
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:15,240
These are level two.

2344
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,980
How much do they yield?

2345
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:22,960
It's fine.

2346
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:23,840
That's good.

2347
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:29,890
Is she here?

2348
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,920
She always wanted to open up this place...

2349
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,720
But it's never open.

2350
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:38,960
She's like...

2351
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,120
Oh.

2352
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,700
I love being a cafe owner...

2353
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,400
Who doesn't...

2354
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,200
Run their cafe.

2355
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:43,540
Oh.

2356
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,300
Oh.

2357
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,280
I forgot to turn off on.

2358
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:47,900
Or turn on.

2359
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,480
Or turn on auto again.

2360
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,740
I forgot to have more turnips.

2361
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,100
Oh, you've got to stop pushing yourself.

2362
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:55,080
Can't you ask someone else to handle it for you?

2363
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,000
Let me go, Iroha.

2364
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,920
I may be old now.

2365
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,480
But I was once known as the Demon Warden.

2366
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,320
This is nothing for a...

2367
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,560
Uh-oh.

2368
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:11,020
My aching back.

2369
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:12,600
My heart.

2370
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:12,960
See?

2371
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,560
My achy, breaky heart.

2372
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,040
Is something wrong?

2373
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,800
Let me know how I can help.

2374
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,760
Demon Warden.

2375
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:20,300
Dang.

2376
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:21,860
Such a kind soul.

2377
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,100
Our carpenter Takumi left a few days ago...

2378
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,100
And hasn't come back.

2379
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,320
Sakaki wants to go look for him.

2380
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,300
I thought I'd ask him to repair the dragon shrine...

2381
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,520
Since you're staying there.

2382
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,340
He only left a couple days ago.

2383
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,800
What stopped you from asking him months ago?

2384
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,380
The curse of old age.

2385
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:41,780
Oh.

2386
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,520
Don't blame this on old age.

2387
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,740
You're just lazy.

2388
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:45,960
The chief could look for Takumi.

2389
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:47,160
What do you say?

2390
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:48,880
Oh.

2391
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,200
Uh.

2392
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:50,720
Yeah.

2393
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,880
We'll look for him.

2394
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:52,640
Great.

2395
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:54,520
I'm glad you're so reliable.

2396
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,940
Don't bully the grabb.

2397
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,560
I'm reassuring to have you on the side.

2398
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:00,380
Sorry.

2399
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:01,840
Takumi went looking for materials...

2400
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,020
...in the abandoned shrine to the north.

2401
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,680
I'll ask the gatekeeper to open the way for you.

2402
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,940
Yes, we get to leave.

2403
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:09,840
Oh.

2404
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:12,500
Before I go, take these with you.

2405
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,000
Weapons?

2406
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,780
They should prove useful for gathering materials.

2407
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:16,200
Oh.

2408
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,300
A cheap hammer.

2409
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,700
Come on, Gramps.

2410
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,380
That's all you got?

2411
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,520
Is a cheap hammer?

2412
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:27,200
You can mine ore deposits.

2413
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:28,200
Oh.

2414
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,780
And a common hatchet.

2415
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,730
Chop wood.

2416
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:35,350
Oh.

2417
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:38,290
Preparing the dragon shrine could restore my power.

2418
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:41,050
I might even regain my true form.

2419
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:43,210
It sounds like he's about to cry.

2420
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,210
Let's find this Takumi guy right away.

2421
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:45,790
Okay.

2422
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:47,350
Let's go outside.

2423
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:49,550
I'm so excited to go outside.

2424
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:51,210
Hoi.

2425
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:52,230
Hoi.

2426
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:53,770
Wait, so like...

2427
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:56,030
I'm curious if this is the kind...

2428
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:56,190
Oh.

2429
01:40:57,870 --> 01:40:59,650
Wait, they're not here yet.

2430
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:03,790
Huh.

2431
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,370
I was wondering if like...

2432
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:08,230
Hmm.

2433
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:09,150
Okay.

2434
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:13,210
Iroha?

2435
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,230
What's up, Iroha?

2436
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,250
Something to matter?

2437
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:18,990
Yeah.

2438
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:21,310
Oh yeah, maybe we can only use them outside.

2439
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:23,850
Iroha also starts searching for Takumi without a single onigiri for the road.

2440
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:25,310
Onigiri?

2441
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:26,330
You brought us some?

2442
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,710
Tsunamayo?

2443
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:28,690
Nope.

2444
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:29,330
Oh.

2445
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:30,710
I thought you should prepare them.

2446
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:32,290
Hey!

2447
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:34,350
How are you making us do the hard work?

2448
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:36,630
Okay, we'll be a talking sense for once.

2449
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:39,110
I mean, I'm just screaming to bring some when it suddenly hit me.

2450
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:42,570
Do you even know how to make onigiri?

2451
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,810
Oh, I'm not the one who owns the tea shop.

2452
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:45,530
Now that you mention it...

2453
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:46,370
That's not my job.

2454
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:46,690
No.

2455
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:49,590
Why is everyone in bikinis?

2456
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,110
It's...

2457
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:54,010
It's important.

2458
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:54,930
DLC.

2459
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,730
It's important, DLC.

2460
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:59,750
You can't fight on an empty stomach.

2461
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:05,410
Why do they look so sad?

2462
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:09,890
With the right ingredients, you can cook at places like the Tea House or Izakaya.

2463
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:13,690
Collect recipes to expand your cooking repertoire.

2464
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:19,990
The cooking can restore HP and RP or grant temporary stat increases.

2465
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:22,510
Cooking buffs expire the following day.

2466
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:25,370
Onigiri.

2467
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:30,170
Don't forget my portion, okay?

2468
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:34,090
My stomach's rumbling like crazy.

2469
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:35,230
Let's dig in.

2470
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:36,350
Okay.

2471
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:39,050
I thought it was going to be a mini game or something.

2472
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,510
Thank you.

2473
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,190
No kidding.

2474
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:46,330
No, I'd argue that you had a great teacher.

2475
01:42:47,490 --> 01:42:49,070
The question is, why not?

2476
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:49,670
So true.

2477
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:53,090
As a reward for mastering the way of the onigiri, I'll give you extra ingredients to make more.

2478
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,450
So generous.

2479
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:55,150
Iroha!

2480
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:55,430
It's so simple.

2481
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:57,570
You only need a bonfire to prepare them.

2482
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:59,410
Give it a try if you find one.

2483
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:00,430
A bonfire?

2484
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,310
Thank you for all the help, Iroha.

2485
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:04,770
Good luck out there.

2486
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:06,950
Bring back Takumi in one piece.

2487
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:07,930
Okay.

2488
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:11,610
I got some more steamed rice.

2489
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:13,070
And salt.

2490
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:16,510
Oh, the gate opened up.

2491
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:17,830
That's exciting.

2492
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,750
Oh my gosh.

2493
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:19,530
We're going outside.

2494
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:29,810
Spring Highlands.

2495
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:32,170
Oh, there's that purple stuff.

2496
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:33,850
Short swords are...

2497
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:36,530
Short swords are well-balanced and easy to wield.

2498
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:42,950
While their range isn't very impressive, they hit fast enough to keep enemies on the back foot, making it harder for them to strike back.

2499
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:47,010
Press, press, press, press.

2500
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:48,670
I know that combo.

2501
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:51,550
Press, press...

2502
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:52,750
Who am I going to attack right now?

2503
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:54,310
Oh, wait.

2504
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:55,150
So now...

2505
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:57,150
Oh, I still don't have my...

2506
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,350
I'm looking at the Jizo.

2507
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:05,930
Let's go, partner!

2508
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:07,750
He had...

2509
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,410
Wait, I just stole his offering.

2510
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:11,010
I think that's...

2511
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:11,930
Bad luck, no?

2512
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:15,470
Yikes.

2513
01:44:18,570 --> 01:44:19,850
Is that the combo?

2514
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:21,970
What's this?

2515
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:23,850
Drum dance.

2516
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:24,630
Oh!

2517
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:27,710
I can do it here.

2518
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:37,550
Thief.

2519
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:39,150
I didn't know!

2520
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:40,810
I didn't know!

2521
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:41,610
What's this?

2522
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,790
The music is so dramatic.

2523
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:46,930
A treasure chest.

2524
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:50,070
It looks like a picnic basket, actually.

2525
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:54,490
Why not?

2526
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:56,810
It's practically begging for us to take a peek.

2527
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,430
Oh, I thought I was going to be a mimic.

2528
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:01,850
A Ronin hat?

2529
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,010
Wow.

2530
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:04,190
Neat.

2531
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:05,150
A hat.

2532
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:06,870
Want to try it on?

2533
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:08,430
Equip it on in the gear menu.

2534
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:09,630
Oh, we can.

2535
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:14,550
Wait, we can change our appearance at any time?

2536
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,210
Okay, we don't have to wait for the wardrobe.

2537
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:19,930
Let's see.

2538
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:24,410
Okay.

2539
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,550
Wait, is it...

2540
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,380
Where's our hat?

2541
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,100
What'd you find, huh?

2542
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,720
Oh, she doesn't have it on.

2543
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:36,660
Aw, man.

2544
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:39,680
What's this say?

2545
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,080
Beware of Oni.

2546
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:42,560
Oh.

2547
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:45,340
Oh.

2548
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:50,000
Oh, I hear him.

2549
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:50,720
Do you hear him laughing?

2550
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:51,860
Hee hee hee.

2551
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:52,640
Wee!

2552
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,880
You can do this, partner.

2553
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,540
There.

2554
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:56,800
Tap, tap.

2555
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:58,900
We...

2556
01:45:58,900 --> 01:45:59,560
We...

2557
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,080
We...

2558
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:00,340
Oh.

2559
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:01,660
We own that guy.

2560
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2561
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:06,700
Criminal charges.

2562
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:07,760
Stop.

2563
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,740
You violated the law.

2564
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:13,100
You can swap it in the appearance section.

2565
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,360
We're styling right now, everybody.

2566
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:29,240
Oh, yeah.

2567
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:29,920
Oh, yeah.

2568
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:30,280
Oh, yeah.

2569
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,580
Is that a giant chicken?

2570
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,360
Look at these oars.

2571
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:34,700
Wait.

2572
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:36,660
I want a mine.

2573
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,400
I yearn for the mine.

2574
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,440
Oh, interesting.

2575
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,300
Oh, interesting.

2576
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:45,740
Okay.

2577
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,860
That's dodge, yeah.

2578
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:53,020
Excuse me.

2579
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,400
I'm trying to keep this place nice and tidy.

2580
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:55,700
Wait.

2581
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,880
He's got a...

2582
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,540
He's got an Oni-Niri.

2583
01:46:58,840 --> 01:46:59,020
Wait.

2584
01:46:59,040 --> 01:46:59,540
What's in here?

2585
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:01,600
It's more salt?

2586
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,080
This feels really disrespectful.

2587
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:07,480
This feels like we're just stealing from them.

2588
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:08,840
Come here.

2589
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:09,240
Oh, gosh.

2590
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:09,900
They're all coming here.

2591
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,140
Yeah.

2592
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:19,440
Wait.

2593
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,220
I'm too strong.

2594
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,460
I'm too good at this game.

2595
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:23,980
Ha ha ha.

2596
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:25,120
Chicken.

2597
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:28,540
Oops.

2598
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:28,600
Oops.

2599
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:29,340
Oh.

2600
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:29,860
Oh.

2601
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,240
Oh.

2602
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,120
Oh, that's all we can get.

2603
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:44,000
I like how it brightens the area when you...

2604
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:46,920
Oh, so we don't...

2605
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:47,940
Oh, that's actually so nice.

2606
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,360
We don't have to switch, like, material.

2607
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,660
We can just...

2608
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,400
Or, like, the...

2609
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:51,940
The tool.

2610
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:53,420
It just does it automatically.

2611
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:54,280
Oh, my gosh.

2612
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,920
That's so nice, actually.

2613
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:59,060
Because I feel like it would be a lot of switching.

2614
01:47:59,540 --> 01:47:59,940
Otherwise.

2615
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,540
But you don't have to.

2616
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,080
It's easy peasy.

2617
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:13,630
Restored them just to chop them down.

2618
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:16,850
Ah, Earth Dancer.

2619
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:17,810
Oh.

2620
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:19,190
Ooh.

2621
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:20,510
Pickled turnips.

2622
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:20,850
Wait.

2623
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:22,110
He said something to me.

2624
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,030
He's a frog.

2625
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:24,610
Ribbit.

2626
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:25,270
Hmm?

2627
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:27,370
What was that?

2628
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:31,530
Huh?

2629
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:34,170
What's a kid doing outside the village?

2630
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:34,750
Oh.

2631
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:36,690
Hey, you there.

2632
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:38,630
I saw you doing a weird dance.

2633
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:39,130
Hey.

2634
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:41,970
Anyway, you ever heard of frog statues?

2635
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:45,130
Just, just who even are you?

2636
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:47,390
I'm Kroki.

2637
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:51,130
People call me the frog statue fanatic.

2638
01:48:58,190 --> 01:48:58,990
Wow.

2639
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:01,030
Kroki.

2640
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:06,690
It's like you were destined to be a frog statue otaku.

2641
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,250
Hey.

2642
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:09,950
But more importantly.

2643
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:12,190
Do you like frog statues?

2644
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:13,530
Do you?

2645
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:16,210
I suppose so?

2646
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:17,310
He's angry.

2647
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,330
We like the recipes they give us.

2648
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:20,570
Yay!

2649
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:22,090
Ribbit.

2650
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:29,140
After many long years of struggle and solitude...

2651
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:32,600
I finally met another soul who shares my hobby.

2652
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:37,360
Aww.

2653
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,200
You're way too young to be that...

2654
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:42,720
To be true.

2655
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:43,740
For that to be true.

2656
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:45,220
Frog Bert.

2657
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:47,800
No, it's Kroki.

2658
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,460
That's like...

2659
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,220
Frog Bert and...

2660
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:54,780
Doki.

2661
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,000
Doki as a crow.

2662
01:49:58,780 --> 01:49:59,680
Ship name.

2663
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,480
Kroki.

2664
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,540
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge frog statue fan.

2665
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:06,840
The kid doesn't like frogs.

2666
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,360
He just likes the statues.

2667
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:13,440
Well, the fanatic part of your name says it all.

2668
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:13,900
What?

2669
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,240
Ribbit?

2670
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,960
How do you know my name?

2671
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,240
I love him.

2672
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,420
You mentioned it like 10 seconds ago.

2673
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:24,460
Still, how could I not like them?

2674
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,200
Those bulging eyes.

2675
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:30,120
The cool, damp feel as you run your fingers over them.

2676
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:31,080
Kroki Bert.

2677
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:35,880
Everything about them fascinates me.

2678
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,360
You okay?

2679
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:41,880
Oh.

2680
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,880
By the way, I have a favor to ask.

2681
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:45,120
From one fan to another.

2682
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:45,880
What is it?

2683
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:54,080
As a true frog statue fanatic, my duty is, naturally, to learn about every frog statue in Azuma.

2684
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:54,680
Hmm.

2685
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:01,340
But I can't do it all by myself, no matter how much I wish I could.

2686
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:04,640
I am bound by the bane of my existence.

2687
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:05,920
Curfew!

2688
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,540
I mean, you are still a kid.

2689
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:17,280
My parents don't let me out here because they say it's way too dangerous.

2690
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,900
So I sneak out instead.

2691
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,040
We can't have that.

2692
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:21,340
Please don't.

2693
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:22,360
Your parents have a point.

2694
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:23,220
Yeah.

2695
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,320
Kroki the frog here with Kroki the crow.

2696
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,540
I know, I know.

2697
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:32,180
I'll go straight home after this.

2698
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,780
But could you let me know if you find any more frog statues?

2699
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:39,000
Tell me about their location and shape.

2700
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:44,760
Size, feel, smell, taste, everything.

2701
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:45,280
Hmm?

2702
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,060
What was that last one?

2703
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,160
Well...

2704
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:48,600
Please.

2705
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,680
I'm begging you.

2706
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,320
Understood.

2707
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,280
Oh, okay.

2708
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:53,920
We're gonna taste the frog?

2709
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:54,220
Yay!

2710
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:56,800
Ribbit, I knew I could count on you.

2711
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,960
You can usually find me in Spring Village.

2712
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:02,000
Let me know whenever you find a frog statue.

2713
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,000
Um...

2714
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,340
Find enough and I'll give you some treasure I discovered.

2715
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:06,920
Huh?

2716
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:07,920
Really?

2717
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:08,440
Yeah.

2718
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:09,340
Yeah.

2719
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,140
Yeah.

2720
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:13,640
Yeah.

2721
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,480
Only makes sense to reward you for your work.

2722
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:20,680
After all, more frog statues means more happiness.

2723
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:26,180
Okay.

2724
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,580
You can do it!

2725
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:28,360
Great.

2726
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:29,080
Thanks a bunch.

2727
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:31,780
Okay.

2728
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:33,100
We'll get some recipes.

2729
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,040
And I saw this baby.

2730
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:37,740
Cheap cloth.

2731
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:38,420
Let's go.

2732
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:39,800
Wait, what's here?

2733
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:41,860
Oh, we can chop the wood here.

2734
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,880
Ooh, what'd you find, huh?

2735
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,840
Some cherry blossoms.

2736
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:46,980
Some cherry blossoms.

2737
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,400
Oh!

2738
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:53,560
The entrance to the abandoned truck.

2739
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:57,300
Oh, yeah.

2740
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:58,520
Good stuff, partner.

2741
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,160
Thank you.

2742
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,900
I am pretty good, huh?

2743
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:03,940
That's not what he said.

2744
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:16,050
That was some heavy-duty stuff.

2745
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,490
Another picnic basket.

2746
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:25,050
Rich soil.

2747
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:27,090
More red soil.

2748
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:28,090
All right, let's go.

2749
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:30,630
Wait, I missed this.

2750
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:33,170
Vinegar?

2751
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:36,250
What's that doing here?

2752
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,090
Uh-oh.

2753
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:38,630
Wait.

2754
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:40,790
Don't I need three?

2755
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:41,370
Three?

2756
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:41,990
Okay.

2757
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,550
We gotta wait for our RP to...

2758
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:45,690
to...

2759
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:47,130
come back.

2760
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,470
What's over here for now?

2761
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:50,190
What is that?

2762
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:53,410
Yeah, we're...

2763
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:54,590
we're out of...

2764
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:55,630
radish point.

2765
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:02,820
Oh?

2766
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:03,840
Secret.

2767
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:05,600
Oh my god.

2768
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:12,660
Earth Dancer.

2769
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:13,560
Recipe.

2770
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:17,900
Rolled egg recipe.

2771
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:21,320
I want some rolled egg right now.

2772
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:23,380
Sweet rolled egg.

2773
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,960
Sweet mama.

2774
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:27,080
That's all I want right now.

2775
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:29,440
Yummy.

2776
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:35,520
See, it pays to explore, everybody.

2777
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,520
Sometimes we get recipes for yummy eggy.

2778
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,100
Box full of dirt?

2779
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:41,760
Not questioned.

2780
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:43,040
Pot full of vinegar?

2781
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:43,840
Questionable.

2782
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:44,520
And suspicious.

2783
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,220
Yes, very.

2784
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:47,780
Oh, what's there?

2785
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:49,640
Oh.

2786
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:50,100
Uh-oh.

2787
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:52,060
I think I'm falling.

2788
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,840
Oh, wonderful.

2789
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:54,700
The bridge is out.

2790
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:57,920
I suppose I won't be getting across here until it's fixed.

2791
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,780
Way to go, Minto.

2792
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:06,340
Oh.

2793
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,960
She's so...

2794
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:12,160
She's so talented in every way.

2795
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:13,960
In every way possible.

2796
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,840
Forget leg day.

2797
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:18,440
We all...

2798
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:18,980
We all...

2799
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:21,400
We all care about ankle day.

2800
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,400
Oh.

2801
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:23,960
Dragon.

2802
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:27,540
Warping to save statues.

2803
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:28,980
Nice.

2804
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:34,520
It's been a minute since I've saved.

2805
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:40,620
I think there's auto-saving in this game, but, you know, always good to also make manual saves.

2806
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,060
Very nice.

2807
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,440
Abandoned shrine.

2808
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:49,040
Sounds kind of spooky.

2809
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:52,380
Whoa.

2810
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:55,220
Whoa.

2811
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,880
Oh, man.

2812
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,560
Talk about creepy.

2813
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:04,940
Awesome.

2814
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:07,960
Look at her just looking at him like...

2815
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:08,060
What?

2816
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,340
Wobi.

2817
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:10,720
Are you scared?

2818
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:11,700
Stop being such a baby.

2819
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:12,640
No?

2820
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:13,880
Come on.

2821
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:14,520
Be serious.

2822
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:19,900
You think a dinky place like this could scare a great and powerful dragon?

2823
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:24,640
I just don't want to have to clean up after you wet yourself.

2824
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:25,760
Dang!

2825
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,040
Oh.

2826
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:31,560
Good thing that guy is hidden in plain sight.

2827
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:36,160
Minto, did you use your eyes?

2828
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:41,820
What'd you find, huh?

2829
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,160
Nothing for you, Wobi.

2830
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:44,080
Back.

2831
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:45,720
Back, you foul beast.

2832
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:47,400
Ooh.

2833
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:51,780
Hide.

2834
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,500
Pauldron.

2835
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:55,500
Okay.

2836
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:57,600
It's armor, I guess.

2837
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:04,320
Can we not pass until we...

2838
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,620
Oh, monster barriers.

2839
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,480
I was gonna say, can we not pass until we...

2840
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:09,160
Until we...

2841
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:10,880
Um...

2842
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:11,860
Defeat the monsters.

2843
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,260
Just like another game.

2844
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:18,560
We're trapped.

2845
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:21,200
Indigo grass.

2846
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:23,520
That guy looks straight at me.

2847
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:24,000
Can I...

2848
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,300
I wish I could sneak up on...

2849
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:26,400
Do a sneak attack, you know?

2850
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:27,480
It's fine.

2851
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:28,460
We can handle these guys.

2852
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:32,100
Oop.

2853
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:32,520
Oop.

2854
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:33,060
Oop.

2855
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,460
Okay, come here.

2856
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:43,100
Oop, oop, oop.

2857
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:44,000
Oop, oop, oop.

2858
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:45,840
Ouchie, ouch.

2859
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2860
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,420
I was trying to dodge.

2861
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,680
Okay, now I can loot in plunder from their little camp.

2862
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,500
Lost by a treasure.

2863
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:57,460
Energy potion.

2864
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:58,180
Ooh.

2865
01:57:59,300 --> 01:57:59,860
Sounds good.

2866
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:02,220
Take all their vinegar.

2867
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,500
Nothing else that they got?

2868
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:06,840
That's it?

2869
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,260
Oh, I saw another one in the distance.

2870
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:14,440
Finally getting hang of your weapon, eh?

2871
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,020
I forget that I have...

2872
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,840
My drum, too, that I can use.

2873
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,820
What are the short sword...

2874
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:21,680
Skill tree?

2875
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:22,900
Oh, I have it on auto still.

2876
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:25,460
Let's see.

2877
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,780
Um...

2878
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:28,860
Charge attack.

2879
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:30,480
Ooh.

2880
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,140
What if I don't want that?

2881
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:32,660
What if I...

2882
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:32,960
Oh, wait.

2883
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,060
That's all I got.

2884
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,800
Yeah, we should equip the armor, huh?

2885
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:40,520
Okay, we hold it.

2886
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:43,380
We should be in a bit better shape now.

2887
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,000
Oh.

2888
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,220
Did you know that your drum dance can also help?

2889
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2890
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,280
I did that.

2891
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:48,800
I did that.

2892
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,600
We'll restore HP to you and anybody.

2893
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:52,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2894
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,140
It was R...

2895
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,580
Right click, I think.

2896
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,160
Drum, dance.

2897
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:00,520
Drum, drum, drum.

2898
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:01,780
Easy.

2899
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:04,220
I think so.

2900
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:05,760
Oh.

2901
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:07,240
Left click.

2902
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:08,040
Okay.

2903
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:10,740
So it's R left click.

2904
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:11,520
That's what it was.

2905
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:14,460
Um...

2906
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:15,060
What was I going to do?

2907
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:15,360
Oh.

2908
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:17,080
I was going to see our new gear.

2909
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:19,340
Oh, yeah, I can put it on.

2910
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:20,060
Equipment.

2911
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:26,640
There we go.

2912
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,200
We're styling.

2913
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:35,130
That guy is just chilling.

2914
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:37,330
I'm going to ruin his day.

2915
01:59:42,110 --> 01:59:42,710
Oh.

2916
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:46,330
Oh, but I have no...

2917
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:47,910
I have no more RP.

2918
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:49,550
I forget about it.

2919
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:53,610
Miso.

2920
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:54,790
Mommy.

2921
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:00,090
Well dressed now.

2922
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:00,930
We're getting there.

2923
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:02,790
We're building an outfit.

2924
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:03,990
Obviously.

2925
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,610
What's this?

2926
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:07,910
More Miso.

2927
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:09,310
Okay.

2928
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,600
I guess I could eat the onigiri, huh?

2929
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:20,920
We could eat the onigiri for...

2930
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:23,720
For energy and stuff.

2931
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:24,900
That guy coming after me.

2932
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:29,560
Wait.

2933
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,100
Easy.

2934
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:34,900
Easy.

2935
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:38,040
Oh.

2936
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:42,490
Okay.

2937
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:42,950
Okay.

2938
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:43,290
Okay.

2939
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:45,730
Okay.

2940
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:46,390
Okay.

2941
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:46,870
Okay.

2942
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:47,410
Can I climb?

2943
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:50,690
No monkeying around, I suppose.

2944
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,650
There was another guy up here, wasn't there?

2945
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:54,710
My eyes deceive me?

2946
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:56,270
I suppose so.

2947
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:57,450
And a frog.

2948
02:00:57,870 --> 02:00:59,270
So very...

2949
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,990
Inconspicuous.

2950
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:04,710
What...

2951
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:05,270
What recipe?

2952
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:07,970
Grilled onigiri.

2953
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:11,610
Sounds yummy.

2954
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:14,650
Okay.

2955
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:15,950
So, if I...

2956
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:16,290
Let's see.

2957
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:17,790
I want to restore my...

2958
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,610
RP.

2959
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:19,470
So let's...

2960
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:20,450
Chomp.

2961
02:01:20,610 --> 02:01:20,990
Chomp.

2962
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:21,290
Chomp.

2963
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:22,970
Oh, this only heals...

2964
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:23,450
Okay.

2965
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:24,030
This is...

2966
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:25,750
So, the pickled turnips...

2967
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:29,210
Restores our RP.

2968
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,940
Oh, wait.

2969
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:33,900
Eat it.

2970
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,500
There you go.

2971
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:38,700
The rice heals.

2972
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:40,000
So anything...

2973
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,620
So...

2974
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:41,540
Some things heal.

2975
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,600
We got an eggy.

2976
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,520
Gonna use that for our sweet eggy.

2977
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:49,940
Okay.

2978
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:53,660
Okay-do-key.

2979
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:57,280
Oh, ambush!

2980
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,980
And then...

2981
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:11,660
Let's try this.

2982
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:21,690
We even got like a little...

2983
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:23,490
Animation for it.

2984
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:24,110
Nice.

2985
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:27,750
That was sick.

2986
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,110
Nope.

2987
02:02:33,570 --> 02:02:33,810
Ouch.

2988
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,290
I tried.

2989
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:40,570
Sometimes I wish I could...

2990
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:42,490
I guess you have to like dodge backwards like...

2991
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,820
Like that, I guess.

2992
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:50,300
Did we just take an offering from Jesus at you?

2993
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:51,420
Yeah, don't...

2994
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:54,780
Don't take...

2995
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:56,060
Yeah.

2996
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:57,740
What'd you find, huh?

2997
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,700
Nothing for you, woobie.

2998
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:03,000
Red grass.

2999
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,000
Oop!

3000
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,600
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

3001
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:08,580
Boop, boop, boop!

3002
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:08,680
Ow!

3003
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,720
Wait.

3004
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,120
Oh.

3005
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,020
Hold on.

3006
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:16,860
This would be...

3007
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,000
Uh...

3008
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:19,520
R...

3009
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:21,600
Oh, I don't have enough!

3010
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:23,500
Oh.

3011
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:24,260
Dang.

3012
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,720
Bird came after me.

3013
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,000
Time to finish them off!

3014
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:30,680
I did.

3015
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:31,680
I did that.

3016
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:32,260
I did.

3017
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:33,180
I finished them off.

3018
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,880
This has a real threatening aura.

3019
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:38,300
But I also sense a human presence.

3020
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,720
Someone's...

3021
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:41,000
Someone's...

3022
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,920
I sure hope Takumi didn't end up as some monster's lunch.

3023
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:44,660
Wait.

3024
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,480
We got cabbage.

3025
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:50,480
Maybe these fresh fruits and vegetables grow big and ripe...

3026
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:53,440
One day bring someone joy.

3027
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:55,260
Azuma Horticulture Club!

3028
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:56,760
Okay.

3029
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:57,440
That's kind of cute.

3030
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,480
The cabbages.

3031
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:01,300
They're free!

3032
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:01,960
They're free!

3033
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,640
What do we get?

3034
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:07,080
Stone sculpture recipe.

3035
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,520
Delicious.

3036
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:14,880
Yeah.

3037
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,740
For our minerals, obviously.

3038
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:20,940
Obviously.

3039
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:22,740
For...

3040
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:24,030
For our...

3041
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:26,680
Uh...

3042
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,080
Yeah.

3043
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:33,170
Look at that chicken.

3044
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:34,310
He's climbing.

3045
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:37,210
Hmm.

3046
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:40,150
You think they'll notice me if I start mining?

3047
02:04:40,430 --> 02:04:40,690
Oh.

3048
02:04:41,530 --> 02:04:42,410
Yes, they will.

3049
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:43,230
Ow!

3050
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:43,770
Woo!

3051
02:04:43,870 --> 02:04:44,450
We parried!

3052
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:46,810
Oh!

3053
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:47,170
No.

3054
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:52,050
Oh, yeah, baby!

3055
02:04:52,670 --> 02:04:53,770
We're too strong!

3056
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:53,870
Dog!

3057
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:55,130
Okay, back to mining.

3058
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:57,910
Are you beefier than usual or is it just me?

3059
02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:59,070
Back to mining?

3060
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:03,430
You can't just call a girl beefy!

3061
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:04,670
Holy!

3062
02:05:06,950 --> 02:05:07,990
Preserved bonito.

3063
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:11,550
He's like, yeah, you're so beefy, Minto.

3064
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:15,570
Thanks for...

3065
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,390
Now I have a complex.

3066
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,680
Cheap bracelet.

3067
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:27,300
I wish I had a girl to call beefy.

3068
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:32,380
Wait, is he coming back up or...

3069
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:33,160
What's he doing?

3070
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:34,860
Can he come back up?

3071
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,240
Where is he?

3072
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,480
Where's the chicken?

3073
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,800
Oh, we can actually hear the...

3074
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:45,280
Like...

3075
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:46,920
The music now.

3076
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:55,030
What the recipe?

3077
02:05:55,250 --> 02:05:55,850
A bench.

3078
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:57,790
And that's our fiber.

3079
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:14,020
I like it.

3080
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,320
Where'd the bird go?

3081
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:17,920
Bird.

3082
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:18,980
Wait, now...

3083
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:19,460
Oh, there he is.

3084
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,300
He was saving that up.

3085
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,340
He was saving...

3086
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:27,820
Thank you, Al.

3087
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,580
We could sit by the fire.

3088
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:31,040
Oh!

3089
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,820
This is how we cook?

3090
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,040
Let her cook.

3091
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:36,780
I'm gonna cook some eggy.

3092
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:38,040
I'm starving.

3093
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:42,640
Heal 70 HP and...

3094
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:43,940
Might.

3095
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:46,220
Pickled turnips.

3096
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:48,640
Let's cook that.

3097
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:53,630
Wait, we can do five?

3098
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,830
And make it extra delicious.

3099
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:58,530
Aw, I was hoping there would be an animation.

3100
02:06:58,650 --> 02:06:59,250
But that's okay.

3101
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:01,170
Me too, actually.

3102
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:04,170
I'm actually kinda hungry too.

3103
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:05,670
Don't forget my portion, okay?

3104
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:07,250
Come on.

3105
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:09,570
Don't just wave that under my nose.

3106
02:07:09,950 --> 02:07:11,010
Let me have some too.

3107
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:11,430
Hmm.

3108
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:14,790
You're so desperate.

3109
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:16,130
Will be there.

3110
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:19,650
Inspect.

3111
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:22,990
Touching a lantern, charge the runes with...

3112
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:23,630
Wait.

3113
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:28,330
Touching a lantern, charge with runes will restore some of your rune points.

3114
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:29,970
No kidding?

3115
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:31,190
Oh, I need that.

3116
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,050
Nice.

3117
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:32,890
Nice, nice, nice.

3118
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:33,910
Okay, cool.

3119
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:35,310
Did I look in here?

3120
02:07:35,970 --> 02:07:36,810
Here's a good spot.

3121
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:38,370
Wanna take a quick breather?

3122
02:07:38,550 --> 02:07:39,030
Nope.

3123
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:43,350
Okay, this is just screaming boss, huh?

3124
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:45,790
Huh.

3125
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:46,910
Let's, um...

3126
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:48,130
Maybe we should take a breather.

3127
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:49,150
Okay, let's, uh...

3128
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:50,290
Let's eat some snack.

3129
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:53,610
Let's eat some snack.

3130
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:55,270
And, uh...

3131
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:59,390
I don't think we need to restore 70.

3132
02:07:59,390 --> 02:08:00,930
That feels like a little...

3133
02:08:00,930 --> 02:08:02,070
Much, no?

3134
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:05,050
No?

3135
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,280
Nah, we're fine.

3136
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:13,980
Take who's out.

3137
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:25,160
Oh, I forgot to turn back on, Otto.

3138
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,300
Oh.

3139
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:28,620
Ruby, stay back.

3140
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:30,860
Haunt.

3141
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,360
Peter.

3142
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:36,240
Peter.

3143
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:37,500
The horse.

3144
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:41,600
Bosses have high defense, which makes it difficult to damage them through normal means.

3145
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:44,620
So one strategy is to fill up their stun gauge.

3146
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:47,800
Once the gauge is full, you'll immobilize them and deal much more damage.

3147
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:50,300
Each boss has a unique weakness.

3148
02:08:50,580 --> 02:08:54,320
Attacking them with their elemental weakness or striking their weak point will stun the gauge faster.

3149
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:57,640
You can do this, partner.

3150
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:58,100
Woo!

3151
02:08:59,020 --> 02:08:59,360
Woo!

3152
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:00,620
Woo!

3153
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:00,840
Woo!

3154
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:01,480
Woo!

3155
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:02,120
Okay.

3156
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:02,780
Hey!

3157
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,080
This...

3158
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:07,300
Oh my god!

3159
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:08,460
Go, go, go, go!

3160
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:15,040
What's his weak point?

3161
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:16,880
Ah!

3162
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:17,560
Nice spawned.

3163
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,560
You got him good!

3164
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:21,460
Oh my goodness.

3165
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,020
Okay.

3166
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:23,400
Oh.

3167
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:25,140
I'm just getting...

3168
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:25,900
getting him in the butt.

3169
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:26,740
Boop, boop, boop.

3170
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:27,360
Ouchy.

3171
02:09:32,570 --> 02:09:33,650
Oh, dang it.

3172
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:34,770
That would've been a perfect...

3173
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:35,530
Ah!

3174
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:36,870
Oh!

3175
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:37,690
Oh!

3176
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:38,030
Okay.

3177
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:39,090
My charge attack.

3178
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:39,390
That's right.

3179
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:40,030
I forgot I had that.

3180
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:42,450
And then, uh...

3181
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:43,390
R and this.

3182
02:09:43,610 --> 02:09:44,410
Divine Death.

3183
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:48,640
It's OP!

3184
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:50,320
Holy cow!

3185
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:50,480
Wow!

3186
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:52,220
It's OP!

3187
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:53,820
Well done!

3188
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:55,040
Dang!

3189
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,660
Now to find Takumi.

3190
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:01,160
He might've hidden somewhere to escape that thing.

3191
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,680
Dang!

3192
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:03,760
What?

3193
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,560
Freaking nuked him.

3194
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:04,840
Yeah!

3195
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:07,280
Oh.

3196
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:08,300
Round two?

3197
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:09,820
Huh?

3198
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,400
This guy again?

3199
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,460
No kidding?

3200
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,620
Moonen Musou style.

3201
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:21,300
Cyclone Blade!

3202
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:28,560
Oh, he could've taken care of it.

3203
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:34,480
I'm here in my bikini.

3204
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:37,980
Um, I did that too.

3205
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:40,560
It just took a couple hits before the one hit.

3206
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:48,840
He was a monster?

3207
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,480
Blame the blight.

3208
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,580
I've seen it happen many a time.

3209
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:54,200
That was more than one hit.

3210
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:54,580
No!

3211
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:57,200
People fall more easily to possession.

3212
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:00,820
When you're possessed, you become a horse monster?

3213
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:01,440
Thank you for helping us.

3214
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:03,780
No thanks needed.

3215
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:05,860
You'd already done most of the work.

3216
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:06,540
Yeah, I did.

3217
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,000
Thank you.

3218
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:08,500
Actually, for recognizing that.

3219
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:09,620
However, you must remain ever vigilant.

3220
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:12,880
A moment's carelessness may cost you your life.

3221
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:14,340
Right.

3222
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:18,260
I am Muda-Sami.

3223
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:21,420
I wander the land of Azuma on a quest to master the art of the sword.

3224
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:22,840
They're making him so mysterious.

3225
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:32,000
He's so...

3226
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:34,580
Swordsman seeking greatness.

3227
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,700
Wait, he's so cool!

3228
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,760
Oh no, he's hot.

3229
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:44,900
Put him in a sweat and suit.

3230
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:46,160
You know it.

3231
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:47,640
I have many questions for you.

3232
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:49,560
Like, why are you in a bikini?

3233
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:50,880
You must take this man to safety.

3234
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:55,720
Oh!

3235
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:58,240
Evil.

3236
02:11:58,980 --> 02:11:59,500
Mmm.

3237
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:00,780
Mmm.

3238
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:02,260
Mmm.

3239
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:07,060
I come back and everybody's in bathing suits.

3240
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:10,240
Now don't that just beat all.

3241
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:13,400
Never thought a monster would target little ol' me.

3242
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:13,960
Aw.

3243
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:17,020
All that matters is that you made it home safely.

3244
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:20,080
We're all indebted to our new chief in Muda-Sami.

3245
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:23,040
You can say that again.

3246
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:24,500
My thanks, y'all.

3247
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:25,340
Y'all.

3248
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:28,020
I will pay you a hundred fold.

3249
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,300
Just say the word.

3250
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:30,800
My thanks, y'all.

3251
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:32,680
Mina-san.

3252
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:33,780
Arigato.

3253
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,620
Who's this fuzzball?

3254
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:39,400
I am not a fuzzball!

3255
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:43,320
For sure information, I am a divine descendant.

3256
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:59,120
For sure information, I am a divine descendant.

3257
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,980
Well, aren't you a lovely young lady?

3258
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:02,240
You a traveler?

3259
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:07,440
Actually, I've dwelled in this village since time immemorial.

3260
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:09,020
That's weird.

3261
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:10,520
Come on now.

3262
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:14,240
I've lived here all my life, and I've never seen a girl half as pretty as you.

3263
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,940
I would remember that belly button.

3264
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:19,380
Whatever.

3265
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,400
Hello?

3266
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:24,960
Not even half as pretty?

3267
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,280
Okay.

3268
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:28,760
Dang.

3269
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:36,050
Now ain't that something.

3270
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:38,590
A lot happened while I was gone, eh?

3271
02:13:39,890 --> 02:13:40,150
Hey.

3272
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:42,410
Hey.

3273
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:45,030
Dramatic, dramatic bias.

3274
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:48,030
You meant what you said earlier, right?

3275
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:50,070
That you've never seen anyone half as pretty?

3276
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:50,830
Uh, what did I say?

3277
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:54,490
That you'd repay us a hundredfold?

3278
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:54,750
Oh.

3279
02:13:55,590 --> 02:13:56,370
Oh, yeah.

3280
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:57,390
You bet.

3281
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:59,190
Only fair for saving my life.

3282
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:01,530
You just say the word, and I'll come running.

3283
02:14:02,690 --> 02:14:04,250
That better apply to me, too.

3284
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:07,030
Saving you was a team effort, okay?

3285
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:08,630
Sorry, Suzu.

3286
02:14:08,630 --> 02:14:09,090
She's...

3287
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:10,510
She's still growing.

3288
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:13,030
Can't you humor me a little?

3289
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:14,810
Not the inner dialogue.

3290
02:14:14,810 --> 02:14:16,990
My partner and I are gonna need your help later.

3291
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:19,350
So, don't forget you owe us.

3292
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:26,430
Chief, would you come with me a moment?

3293
02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:28,510
I'd like to give you something.

3294
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:29,130
Oh, yeah?

3295
02:14:30,430 --> 02:14:31,030
Go on.

3296
02:14:31,870 --> 02:14:32,870
Take this.

3297
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:36,310
Consider it a thank you gift.

3298
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:37,470
What is it?

3299
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:38,530
Isn't this...

3300
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:39,010
Eggies?

3301
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:41,630
Isn't this Eggie?

3302
02:14:41,690 --> 02:14:43,610
It was my trusty partner as a young man.

3303
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:44,130
Ah.

3304
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:47,390
I'm sure you'll make better use of it now.

3305
02:14:50,270 --> 02:14:50,870
Oh.

3306
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:53,190
A bow.

3307
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:54,170
Let's go.

3308
02:14:54,430 --> 02:14:54,530
Oh.

3309
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:59,430
I got an achievement for defeating Mezuki, which was the horse.

3310
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:00,790
Yeah.

3311
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:02,690
A secondary weapon.

3312
02:15:03,050 --> 02:15:05,070
One you can switch to on the fly.

3313
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:07,950
Let's say you're wielding a sword, then you suddenly feel like using a bow instead.

3314
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:09,050
It's kinda like that.

3315
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:09,770
Hmm.

3316
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:10,990
Okay.

3317
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:11,790
Alright.

3318
02:15:12,110 --> 02:15:13,610
Try it out yourself and you'll see.

3319
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:17,550
Equip secondary weapon.

3320
02:15:17,810 --> 02:15:18,010
Oh, here.

3321
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:19,010
Equipment.

3322
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:21,330
Secondary weapon.

3323
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:22,410
My bow.

3324
02:15:23,050 --> 02:15:23,570
Okay.

3325
02:15:24,970 --> 02:15:25,490
Yep.

3326
02:15:27,890 --> 02:15:28,530
Hey.

3327
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:30,890
Put those skills to the test.

3328
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:31,990
How do I...

3329
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:32,630
Switch.

3330
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:35,290
Hitting the target should be a piece of cake, right?

3331
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:35,610
Oh.

3332
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:37,270
Okay, Q.

3333
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:37,810
Okay.

3334
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:40,070
Alright.

3335
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:42,350
Combo attack.

3336
02:15:42,670 --> 02:15:43,750
With the bow.

3337
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:46,310
Use control to ready your bow.

3338
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:49,890
Mouse to aim, then left click or V to fire.

3339
02:15:50,230 --> 02:15:50,350
Okay.

3340
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:52,330
Cool.

3341
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:53,070
Oh!

3342
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:53,210
Cool.

3343
02:15:54,710 --> 02:15:56,030
Is there...

3344
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:57,210
Drop?

3345
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:59,870
Oh, doesn't he like it?

3346
02:16:01,290 --> 02:16:01,630
Not bad.

3347
02:16:01,770 --> 02:16:02,490
Nice shot.

3348
02:16:02,830 --> 02:16:03,430
I see.

3349
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:04,170
I see.

3350
02:16:04,630 --> 02:16:07,270
I was right to put my faith in you.

3351
02:16:07,890 --> 02:16:08,430
Thank you.

3352
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:10,610
Are you absolutely sure?

3353
02:16:11,530 --> 02:16:12,670
I think it's time.

3354
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:15,550
You see...

3355
02:16:16,070 --> 02:16:21,450
This recent incident with Takumi has forced me to seriously consider retirement.

3356
02:16:21,450 --> 02:16:22,430
Archer.

3357
02:16:22,830 --> 02:16:23,390
Oh.

3358
02:16:25,530 --> 02:16:28,760
I hate to ask for anything in return, but...

3359
02:16:29,190 --> 02:16:32,290
I'd like you to check the request board every so often.

3360
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:33,370
Quest board.

3361
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:37,990
The villagers will sometimes hang wooden emma plaques bearing their wishes.

3362
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:38,670
Oh.

3363
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:41,730
I'm sure they'd appreciate your aid.

3364
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:42,530
Nice.

3365
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:46,330
Um, I guess I'll consider a repayment for the bow.

3366
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:49,090
Good.

3367
02:16:49,890 --> 02:16:52,250
Thank you for all of your help.

3368
02:16:53,210 --> 02:16:58,030
Well then, I'll leave this village in your capable hands.

3369
02:16:58,430 --> 02:16:59,110
Thanks, mister.

3370
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:02,210
Go take a quick look at the request board.

3371
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:06,670
It's your duty as both chief and earth dancer to help people out.

3372
02:17:06,670 --> 02:17:10,590
I don't even know what an earth dancer is quite exactly.

3373
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:12,550
This...

3374
02:17:12,550 --> 02:17:14,770
This status has been thrown upon me.

3375
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:15,850
Actually.

3376
02:17:19,170 --> 02:17:20,350
Ethan, happy birthday!

3377
02:17:22,430 --> 02:17:24,090
Minto yearns for the factories.

3378
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:28,710
Villagers write down requests on wooden emma plaques and hang them on the request board.

3379
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:31,790
Make their wish come true and they will reward you.

3380
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:36,370
After you complete a quest, report back to the board to finish the job.

3381
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:39,150
Finish the job.

3382
02:17:39,650 --> 02:17:40,390
Okay, hold on.

3383
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:40,890
Wait!

3384
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:41,270
Yes!

3385
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:42,790
That kid is here!

3386
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:43,590
Wow!

3387
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:46,030
Hey there, fellow fanatic.

3388
02:17:46,130 --> 02:17:48,090
Did you find any other frog statues?

3389
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:54,270
Okay, we'll reconsider our life decisions of telling this kid anything.

3390
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,450
Yay!

3391
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:00,390
Neat!

3392
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:01,690
That sounds so cool!

3393
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:02,270
Thanks!

3394
02:18:02,270 --> 02:18:04,110
You found five frog statues.

3395
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:04,530
Here!

3396
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:06,150
Oh!

3397
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:06,930
What do we get?

3398
02:18:08,470 --> 02:18:10,230
Rice cracker recipe!

3399
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:10,910
Nice!

3400
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:13,090
Egg bowl recipe!

3401
02:18:13,930 --> 02:18:16,430
Come tell me when you found at least ten statues.

3402
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:17,370
You can do it!

3403
02:18:17,710 --> 02:18:18,130
Okay!

3404
02:18:18,390 --> 02:18:18,790
Thank you!

3405
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:19,470
Alright.

3406
02:18:20,510 --> 02:18:22,670
We must go to...

3407
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,050
The shrine.

3408
02:18:24,590 --> 02:18:25,250
Up there.

3409
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:27,670
Yummy.

3410
02:18:28,470 --> 02:18:29,550
Yeah, yummy.

3411
02:18:30,190 --> 02:18:31,070
Up here.

3412
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:32,710
Up here.

3413
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:34,810
Okay, I was gonna say it better not be dirty.

3414
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:46,400
Wait!

3415
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:47,700
He...

3416
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:50,420
He gets a little...

3417
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:55,480
It's so cute!

3418
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:58,400
So cute!

3419
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:02,120
His shorts look a little tight.

3420
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,120
You okay there, buddy?

3421
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:05,880
Everybody...

3422
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:07,680
Everybody is in swimsuits, you guys!

3423
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:10,420
Equal opportunity.

3424
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,430
Equal opportunity.

3425
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:12,880
Equal opportunity.

3426
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,360
He hasn't been here five minutes.

3427
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:18,420
I don't think we've spoken even five words to the guy.

3428
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,240
Ha ha ha!

3429
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:20,400
Ha ha ha ha!

3430
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:21,600
Ha ha ha!

3431
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:22,980
Ha ha ha!

3432
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:25,160
Well, guys!

3433
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:28,440
I think this might be a good place to end...

3434
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:29,960
Ha ha ha!

3435
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:30,460
I think.

3436
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:32,020
Let's see what they're talking about.

3437
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:32,340
Always a pleasure.

3438
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:32,740
Ha ha ha!

3439
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:33,380
Hi there!

3440
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:35,000
Oh my god, everybody's yelling at me at once.

3441
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:35,720
Ha ha ha ha!

3442
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:37,340
Ha ha ha!

3443
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:37,820
Ha ha ha!

3444
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,760
Ha ha ha!

3445
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:50,520
Spring Village is the second one.

3446
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:52,000
What?

3447
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:54,120
What just happened?

3448
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:55,400
Nevermind.

3449
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,900
My bond is strengthened.

3450
02:19:58,940 --> 02:19:59,460
Ciao!

3451
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,440
Hello.

3452
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:03,560
Hi.

3453
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:06,180
Don't come up to me.

3454
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,120
You freak me out a little bit.

3455
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:10,140
Okay, let's talk to Itoha and then we'll end it.

3456
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:11,900
Getting a feel for the village yet?

3457
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:14,320
In case you forgot, my name's Itoha.

3458
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:16,480
Oh, I've been here for six months!

3459
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:19,080
It's kind of awkward introducing myself again.

3460
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:23,480
Anyway, come visit Suzu and me at the tea shop whenever you like.

3461
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:25,380
And bond up.

3462
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:26,480
Hey.

3463
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:30,420
Um... something else?

3464
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:31,200
What is it?

3465
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:31,840
Let's chat.

3466
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:33,320
Well...

3467
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:34,060
You hungry at all?

3468
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:36,260
My shop has all sorts of yummy stuff on the menu.

3469
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:36,920
What is it?

3470
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:38,600
Bond up.

3471
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:39,440
Good day.

3472
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:41,620
Oh my gosh, they're all eating dongle.

3473
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:42,700
They're so cute.

3474
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:44,440
What are you eating?

3475
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:46,460
Onigiri maybe?

3476
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:49,220
The village is so lively!

3477
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:55,560
Me and my bathing suit buddies.

3478
02:20:57,820 --> 02:20:58,900
Yay!

3479
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:03,700
So guys...

3480
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:04,640
Um... yeah!

3481
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:07,360
This has been Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma!

3482
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:10,400
Um... it's been a lot of fun playing.

3483
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:14,680
And I hope you guys, uh... enjoyed it as well.

3484
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:17,400
Um...

3485
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:17,740
Um...

3486
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:20,620
If you are interested in the game, again, it's on PC...

3487
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:21,100
Oh...

3488
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:21,740
Yes, Hina?

3489
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:23,800
Oh...

3490
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:28,610
Like I'm not even there.

3491
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:29,710
Um...

3492
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:30,770
It's on...

3493
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:32,910
PC, which I'm playing on as well...

3494
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:35,470
As well as the Switch and the Switch 2!

3495
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:38,430
But, um...

3496
02:21:38,430 --> 02:21:40,570
Yeah, thank you again to Marvelous for...

3497
02:21:40,570 --> 02:21:41,290
Uh...

3498
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:42,410
Sponsoring me today!

3499
02:21:42,930 --> 02:21:46,390
And if you're interested in the game, I got a link in the...

3500
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:48,490
Pinned message in chat!

3501
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:49,470
And...

3502
02:21:49,470 --> 02:21:51,270
Link in the description!

3503
02:21:52,190 --> 02:21:52,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3504
02:21:53,470 --> 02:21:54,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3505
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:54,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3506
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:55,970
So...

3507
02:21:58,250 --> 02:21:59,270
I had a lot of fun!

3508
02:22:00,690 --> 02:22:02,030
Sorry I'm so sleepy!

3509
02:22:02,350 --> 02:22:03,550
Because I'm still jet lagged!

3510
02:22:03,630 --> 02:22:06,030
But hopefully in the next couple days, I'll be a-okay!

3511
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:07,650
Thank you to our goal!

3512
02:22:07,970 --> 02:22:08,670
Thank you for the break!

3513
02:22:09,070 --> 02:22:09,630
Thank you, thank you!

3514
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:11,570
Thank you guys!

3515
02:22:13,450 --> 02:22:13,890
And...

3516
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:14,310
Yeah!

3517
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,890
Uh, maybe we'll play some more of it!

3518
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:18,790
I am- I am having a lot of fun!

3519
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,110
Um...

3520
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:23,310
Especially for it being my first Rune Factory game, so...

3521
02:22:23,310 --> 02:22:25,050
I- I am curious, is this...

3522
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:25,870
Similar?

3523
02:22:26,210 --> 02:22:26,770
Or different?

3524
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:28,950
To how the other Rune Factory games...

3525
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:30,490
Have been in the past?

3526
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:32,350
If...

3527
02:22:32,350 --> 02:22:34,210
If you guys have...

3528
02:22:34,210 --> 02:22:35,210
Played before?

3529
02:22:36,310 --> 02:22:36,750
Hmm...

3530
02:22:39,070 --> 02:22:39,510
Hmm...

3531
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:40,170
Pretty similar?

3532
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:42,970
Combat is similar, but the village building is new.

3533
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:44,290
Oh...

3534
02:22:45,610 --> 02:22:46,810
I see, I see, I see!

3535
02:22:46,910 --> 02:22:47,750
It's a bit different!

3536
02:22:48,510 --> 02:22:48,950
Hmm...

3537
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:49,170
Hmm...

3538
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:49,210
Hmm...

3539
02:22:49,210 --> 02:22:49,330
Hmm...

3540
02:22:51,050 --> 02:22:51,490
Hmm...

3541
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:52,310
Why'd they...

3542
02:22:52,310 --> 02:22:52,970
They're all...

3543
02:22:52,970 --> 02:22:54,490
They all got up at once!

3544
02:22:59,330 --> 02:22:59,930
Oh...

3545
02:22:59,930 --> 02:23:00,730
Oh...

3546
02:23:00,730 --> 02:23:01,430
Look at f...

3547
02:23:01,430 --> 02:23:03,130
They're like, streams over!

3548
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:09,490
I guess it was lunch time, because look, it was 2 PM!

3549
02:23:10,690 --> 02:23:11,290
Maybe...

3550
02:23:14,110 --> 02:23:15,050
Stream's over!

3551
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:16,310
Everybody get out!

3552
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:20,070
Anyway, thank you guys!

3553
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:21,310
Thank you, thank you!

3554
02:23:21,730 --> 02:23:25,070
Have a good day, have a good night, and I will see you guys when I see you...

3555
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:26,570
NEXT!

3556
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:27,870
I'll see you guys!

3557
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:30,210
Bye-bye!

3558
02:23:30,710 --> 02:23:30,830
Bye-bye!

3559
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:32,110
Bye-bye!

3560
02:23:32,110 --> 02:23:32,350
Bye-bye!

3561
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:34,050
Bye-bye!

3562
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:39,890
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

3563
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:42,010
I am Ulalaka.

3564
02:23:42,610 --> 02:23:44,770
The joyful elegance of spring.

3565
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:46,910
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.

3566
02:23:48,010 --> 02:23:48,750
What?

3567
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:49,610
By the way...

3568
02:23:49,610 --> 02:23:51,350
Are you fond of music?

3569
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:55,750
I would love to perform with an accomplished dancer such as yourself sometime.

3570
02:23:58,490 --> 02:23:59,450
Let's chat.

3571
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:00,470
Yes!

3572
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:04,010
We couldn't possibly restore this village without Takumi.

3573
02:24:04,270 --> 02:24:06,310
I hope he enjoys many years of good health.

3574
02:24:06,310 --> 02:24:06,810
Yes?

3575
02:24:09,130 --> 02:24:12,470
Don't talk about another man in front of me, and then increase our bond!

3576
02:24:16,450 --> 02:24:17,830
Is it your birthday?

3577
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:18,890
Is that what you said, Karlamon?

3578
02:24:20,470 --> 02:24:21,230
Happy Birthday!

3579
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:24,910
Glad I caught it before I left.

3580
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:25,390
Okay!

3581
02:24:25,770 --> 02:24:27,210
Bye-bye!
