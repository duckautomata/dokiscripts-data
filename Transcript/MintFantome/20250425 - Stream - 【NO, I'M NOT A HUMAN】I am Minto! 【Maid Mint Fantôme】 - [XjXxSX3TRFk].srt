00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,990
Hello,

2
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,010
everyone.

3
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm kind of just vibing to this music right now.

4
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,400
How am I feeling?

5
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
I'm feeling like...

6
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,620
4 out of 10.

7
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,060
Today I'm feeling a little...

8
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
That's so great.

9
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,040
But it's okay.

10
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,420
It's alright.

11
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,040
I've already turned down the music so much, but maybe a little bit more.

12
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,180
Yeah, I also didn't get a lot of sleep last night because...

13
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, partially... Sorry, I read a comment and I usually read the comments out loud so that people know what I'm talking about.

14
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,860
I am... I... Yeah, I started some new medicine recently and it's been messing with me a bit.

15
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,200
And... Also, last night I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

16
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
I woke up really early and I was like...

17
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,420
My brain was like...

18
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,640
Because I was thinking about so many things.

19
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,420
Um, so...

20
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,120
Yeah, but...

21
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
I got some stuff done today.

22
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,100
So, you know.

23
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,620
Too busy reading about hot liches in the area.

24
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,860
I'll tell you, that book was...

25
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,220
Well, I fell asleep.

26
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,520
I don't even think I made it to chapter 2.

27
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
But, um...

28
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
I woke up in the middle of the night...

29
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,280
To a steamy, spicy scene.

30
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
A spicy meatball.

31
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
I don't even think I want to talk about this book, you guys.

32
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:54,780
I...

33
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,740
I don't even think I want to talk about this book.

34
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,140
It's so...

35
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,340
Oh...

36
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,220
It's...

37
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,040
Too freaky?

38
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,180
No...

39
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,320
Did they bone?

40
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,300
Haha, get it?

41
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,800
Cause he's a skelly man.

42
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,580
So...

43
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,120
For those who want some context...

44
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,540
I sometimes listen to...

45
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,100
Romance novels because...

46
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,740
Usually they're very silly.

47
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,740
Right?

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,980
They're very...

49
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,820
They're very...

50
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,420
Um...

51
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,920
Yes, please.

52
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,960
I lack context.

53
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,280
So...

54
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,060
I sometimes listen to these...

55
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,120
To these romance novels...

56
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,240
Before like bed or...

57
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,980
If I'm in the shower or something.

58
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,900
Just because I'm like...

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,500
These are...

60
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,460
So silly.

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,440
And, um...

62
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,580
So, my...

63
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,300
My app has now...

64
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,280
It recommends me like every...

65
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay, here.

66
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,940
Let me just go through it a little bit.

67
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,300
Let me just go through my app a little bit.

68
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,340
To give you a...

69
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,580
Shed some light...

70
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,660
On...

71
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,520
Um...

72
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,940
Where I'm at here.

73
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,620
I almost listened to...

74
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,960
Stranded with the Kraken.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,560
Hahaha.

76
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,870
Donating funds for me to a healthcare plant.

77
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,370
Thank you.

78
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,990
Thank you for the pink.

79
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,550
Please.

80
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,490
Don't go broke.

81
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,830
Please.

82
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,410
Please.

83
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,650
Um...

84
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,970
Let's see.

85
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,310
We've got matched to the Minotaur.

86
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,470
And I'll be okay.

87
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,230
I promise.

88
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,630
Just...

89
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,050
Uh...

90
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,710
I was mostly okay today.

91
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,770
And then...

92
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,450
I don't know.

93
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,990
Maybe because it's getting late.

94
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,450
I don't know.

95
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,330
But, um...

96
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,650
Uh...

97
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,110
The Orc from The Office.

98
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,450
Wintan for the Wolven King.

99
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,370
Gifted to the Gargoyles.

100
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,870
Um...

101
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,250
Snowed in with the Gargoyles.

102
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,110
There's a lot of books about Orcs.

103
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,790
I don't understand why.

104
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,590
Maybe because they're like so humanoid.

105
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,970
Like her Orc mate.

106
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,150
Or her Orc king.

107
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,230
Sworn to the Orc.

108
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,790
Hahaha.

109
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,470
I don't understand.

110
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,570
It's the Tusks.

111
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,450
Maybe.

112
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,410
Hahaha.

113
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,540
Um...

114
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,360
But last night, I listened to one.

115
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
That was called...

116
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
Love.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,560
Laugh.

118
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,500
Lich.

119
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,360
Which someone made a great point.

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,880
They were like...

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
They couldn't name it.

122
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,480
Lich.

123
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,060
Laugh.

124
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,460
Love.

125
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,520
What?

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,660
What an absolute...

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,280
Fumble on their part.

128
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,680
Hahaha.

129
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,460
Love.

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:40,860
Laugh.

131
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,060
Lich.

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,740
Hahaha.

133
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,950
And, um...

134
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,010
Here, I'll read you the...

135
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,070
I'll read you the synopsis.

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,730
Actually, hold on.

137
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,730
Can I read you the synopsis of the Kraken one?

138
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,330
Because it was...

139
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,350
It was cracking me up.

140
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,010
And get it?

141
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,490
It was cracking me up.

142
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,250
Hahaha.

143
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,350
Uh...

144
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,630
Let's see.

145
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,010
Oh, gosh.

146
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,910
The thought of you dating another man makes me want to punch through a wall.

147
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,370
You're magnetic.

148
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,610
That's quote.

149
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,190
End quote.

150
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,750
I signed up for the new...

151
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,170
Bone...

152
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,590
Dash...

153
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,590
R...

154
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,210
App...

155
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,770
For monster dating.

156
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,310
Thinking I'd get a fun one night stand out of the deal.

157
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,970
Instead, I'm now stranded at the hot Kraken's house.

158
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,570
Hahaha.

159
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,090
Oh, at Christmas.

160
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,410
Because of a massive snowstorm.

161
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,110
And what started as a very hot hookup.

162
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,030
Who knew...

163
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,690
And the...

164
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,450
Parentheses.

165
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,830
Who knew tentacles were so...

166
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,610
Dot, dot, dot.

167
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,750
Flexible.

168
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,350
End parentheses.

169
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,570
Now feels like so much more.

170
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,710
But surely it's too early to be talking about serious things like family and forever, isn't it?

171
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,810
Stranded with the Kraken is a long novella with a human heroine and a kraken.

172
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,710
Here's another thing that you'll...

173
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,710
Another pattern you'll hear about in these stories.

174
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,850
They're not just monsters.

175
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,330
They're shifters.

176
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,110
So...

177
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,210
Hahaha.

178
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,310
Hahaha.

179
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,850
So...

180
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,530
It's not...

181
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,050
I...

182
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,190
Hahaha.

183
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,010
So...

184
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,530
Hahaha.

185
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,730
Hahaha.

186
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,490
So they're...

187
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:31,830
They...

188
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,910
They are able to change into...

189
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,590
Into...

190
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,790
This other...

191
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,050
Because they gotta be human at some point.

192
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,350
I...

193
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,770
I guess.

194
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,250
You can't just love the Kraken.

195
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,530
Um...

196
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,410
A Kraken shifter hero who falls for each other hard and fast.

197
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,530
You'll love it if you enjoy monster romance series with low angst, happy endings, and tentacles...

198
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,190
But yeah, I've listened to Love Laugh Lich.

199
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,990
Um...

200
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,690
Which...

201
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,990
The Lich is...

202
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,730
His name is like...

203
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,730
Solven or something.

204
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,190
This is why reading and liking the...

205
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,930
Lussy Argonian maid is not weird.

206
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,230
Uh huh.

207
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,070
Yeah.

208
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,410
Also, thank you, Barb!

209
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,790
Thank you so much!

210
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,710
My friend told me about a flamingo one.

211
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,450
Flamingo?

212
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,330
Huh?

213
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,950
But, um...

214
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,550
Do you think at any point someone yells, release the Kraken?

215
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,990
Huh?

216
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,270
I sure hope so.

217
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,030
Oh my gosh!

218
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,930
I sure hope so!

219
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,690
Wait, how long was this one?

220
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,290
Cause I definitely woke up and it was like, we hope you enjoyed the book.

221
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,450
It's...

222
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,290
I can't tell.

223
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,470
It doesn't say.

224
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,730
I think each chapter is like 5 minutes.

225
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,870
Nope.

226
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,830
This one's 14.

227
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,130
This one's 5.

228
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,610
This one's 10.

229
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,830
So it's not a very long book at all.

230
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,090
His name is Phil McRae.

231
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,090
My favorite monster is the vampire from Sesame Street.

232
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,230
Some people think he doesn't count.

233
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,130
But I assure you he does.

234
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,090
This just sounds like dying at Monster Girls.

235
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,790
Monster Girls should be monstrous.

236
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,910
I...

237
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,010
But it's so strange that there are people that are like so into monster men.

238
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,590
I never knew it was a thing.

239
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,910
For like, normies and all.

240
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,370
Also on the cover of this book, it says...

241
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,510
Of the Love Laugh Lich.

242
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,370
It says...

243
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,930
These sex magic rituals aren't OSHA compliant.

244
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,590
And so I felt like I had to read it.

245
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,370
I was like, this is...

246
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,890
Um...

247
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:58,790
Yeah...

248
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,370
Thank you for the 10 gifted swamp!

249
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,610
Thank you so much.

250
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,340
But uh...

251
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,700
If you wanna see the cover of it, you can go to my Twitter.

252
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,960
I posted a screenshot.

253
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,320
Um...

254
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,120
But basically...

255
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
This guy is like...

256
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,960
The boss.

257
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,140
The way the narrator...

258
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,560
She does his voice is so...

259
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,620
I thought I was about to rip my hair out.

260
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,060
The men should be monstrous too.

261
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,860
Oh yeah, no.

262
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,940
These are monster men.

263
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,660
And...

264
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,940
When you said silly, I didn't expect this.

265
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,000
This is silly, no?

266
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,740
And so...

267
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:44,990
Um...

268
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,540
She works at the office.

269
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,900
And he needs a...

270
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,620
Uh...

271
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,680
Something for his spell.

272
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,140
But what he needs is a shiver?

273
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,240
I don't...

274
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,760
Really understand.

275
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,480
I don't understand it.

276
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,160
I guess...

277
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,780
Just put her in a cold room.

278
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,980
I don't really know.

279
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,980
What do you...

280
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:07,980
What...

281
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,740
What...

282
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,080
What it...

283
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,340
Yeah, like...

284
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,140
Like a shiver.

285
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,140
Like a...

286
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,660
Of...

287
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,340
Of...

288
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,840
Osha approved...

289
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,300
S...

290
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,560
No!

291
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,100
And so, I guess that starts their little romance.

292
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,320
But he's kind of a jerk.

293
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,620
He's actually kind of really bad.

294
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,620
Like, just...

295
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,180
Just not nice to her.

296
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,800
And, um, he is shown on the cover as a skeleton man.

297
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,560
But actually, underneath his billowing cloak, which she loves to describe.

298
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,780
Oh, she's like, oh, it's a billowing cloak.

299
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,440
It's so shadowy.

300
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,560
It's... she loves describing it.

301
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,580
And, um, underneath, he's actually, um, a furry.

302
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:11,130
He's actually a furry with... three peepees stacked on top of each other.

303
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:41,890
So, um, I'll pick up where I last left off before I fell asleep.

304
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,890
Last night, and, uh...

305
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,330
Lich should not have any flesh.

306
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,110
But, I'm just... I don't know.

307
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,650
Thank you, DreadDot.

308
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,270
Thank you.

309
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,930
Three peepees and a trench coat.

310
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,510
What's the third one for?

311
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,310
I don't want to say on stream.

312
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,950
You know?

313
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,040
But...

314
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,440
They can't be side by side with the way they describe...

315
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,920
With the way she...

316
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,240
What?

317
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,420
How she said...

318
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,800
That was happening.

319
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
Here's some money for when this gets...

320
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,480
It won't get demonetized.

321
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
I said peepee.

322
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,510
So...

323
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,770
No, I think they're, like, one on top of each other.

324
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,710
Like...

325
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,710
I think...

326
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,590
Anyway, um...

327
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,710
Yes...

328
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,030
Welcome, everybody.

329
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,590
No, I'm not a human.

330
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,070
I'm a...

331
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,810
You can go back...

332
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,330
I'm a war!

333
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,030
I'm a...

334
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,710
I'm a...

335
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,390
I'm a...

336
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,710
I'm a...

337
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,230
Franklin!

338
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:24,970
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a fish... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... Wow.

339
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,270
Wow, there's so many... so many species.

340
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,310
Isn't the... Isn't the world just so fascinating?

341
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,910
Isn't it just so fascinating?

342
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,570
What if it did spell Minto at one point?

343
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,830
Wouldn't that be crazy?

344
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:49,790
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I wish I had three peepees.

345
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,130
Honestly, I'm jelly.

346
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,710
I don't think... I think it would be way more... trouble than it's worth.

347
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,130
You are John Cena!

348
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,570
Um... Yeah.

349
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,270
I'm a crib!

350
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,990
I'm a... Weirdo...

351
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,230
But yeah.

352
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,750
Um... Some people were wondering if this... If the full game is out or not.

353
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,930
Uh... It's not.

354
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,190
But I still wanted to play it.

355
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,410
Um... I was just kind of like in the mood for...

356
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,850
I was in the mood for like a papers please type game.

357
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,670
You know what I mean?

358
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:27,930
So...

359
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,630
What is this emoji anchor?

360
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,490
What is that?

361
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,850
Thank you so much for the thank you.

362
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,630
Thank you.

363
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,240
So I guess this is like a papers please, but a little spooky.

364
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,920
Let's start it.

365
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,340
Not really papers please.

366
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
No, it's not.

367
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,960
Oh, never mind.

368
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm just kidding.

369
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,120
I lied.

370
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,470
This is my tiny house.

371
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,670
It's very quaint.

372
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,310
We've got one hallway.

373
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,250
Maybe?

374
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,290
What's in here?

375
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,490
Everything is so green.

376
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,710
Oh, this is my bedroom.

377
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,410
Okay, very nice.

378
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,990
This is... nothing.

379
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,010
I blocked myself out.

380
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,190
So someone's at the door.

381
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,030
Who could it be?

382
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,850
Can I peep?

383
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,580
People from the cities have already started coming to the neighbors.

384
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,000
People have changed.

385
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,000
A lot.

386
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,640
Does PP stand for pickle peanut?

387
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,800
That doesn't sound very good.

388
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:56,660
Oh my gosh, I once got... I remember I once got pickle flavored cashews at the airport.

389
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,460
I was like, these might be fine.

390
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
I like cashews.

391
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,900
I like pickles.

392
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,880
It was so... much pickle.

393
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,560
Taste.

394
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,100
Oh my gosh.

395
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,460
There's nothing to be scared, right?

396
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,720
Yeah.

397
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm not an elf.

398
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,380
I'm just a ghost.

399
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,820
Yeah, it was so much dew.

400
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,060
It was so much pickle.

401
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,020
I was like...

402
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
It was so much pickle.

403
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,320
If they come to your place, you let them in.

404
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,620
Oh, just be careful, okay?

405
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,180
Oh, I've heard of people being killed by other people.

406
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,300
Now I hear these stories more and more often.

407
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,080
Who are you?

408
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,800
Or do you want in?

409
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
An acquaintance said that creatures that look like humans are coming.

410
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,720
In a few days, they will tell me what signs can be used to distinguish them from humans.

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,260
Humans!

412
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,200
You can't stay alone.

413
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,720
Something very evil will come and...

414
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,280
Who knows what's next?

415
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,580
Are they skinwalkers?

416
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,160
Creepy.

417
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,060
Uh, what's going on out there?

418
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,860
It's safe to look out the windows at night.

419
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,100
And I even recommend it.

420
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,560
That way, you at least realize what surrounds your house.

421
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,720
It's hard to look out during the day.

422
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,620
It gets very hot.

423
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
The light hurts my eyes.

424
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,060
Uh, is it better not to leave the house now?

425
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,040
What do we do now?

426
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,940
That's why I brush my teeth with pickle-flavored toothpaste.

427
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,780
I'm immune to any pickly surprises.

428
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,380
People must love talking to you.

429
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,880
Um, what?

430
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,720
What?

431
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,060
What?

432
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,900
Uh, is it...

433
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,840
Uh, what do I do?

434
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,500
Let's summarize.

435
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,260
There's gonna be people coming in at night.

436
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,600
You decide who to let in, who not.

437
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
It's hard to decide visually.

438
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
We'll be told later by the authorities what to do.

439
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,680
Look at the windows.

440
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
Don't know...

441
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,460
You don't know what's going on.

442
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,100
And keep your head down.

443
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,980
It's dangerous everywhere now.

444
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,940
I'll sleep in your cabinet.

445
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,200
Tonight.

446
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,120
And tomorrow you can do it yourself.

447
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,860
Well, I have a bed.

448
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,840
I don't...

449
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,140
I don't think I need to sleep in a cabinet.

450
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,180
My little...

451
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,580
He's my little possum pal.

452
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,880
Come and see me in the afternoon and we'll talk.

453
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,380
Okay.

454
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,380
Well, it's nighttime now.

455
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,340
No one else will come tonight.

456
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:28,800
Okay.

457
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,020
Wait, so I can look outside?

458
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,880
No, I cannot.

459
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,660
What cabinet are you in, mister?

460
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,160
The game with the peep-o-roop.

461
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,800
Peep-o-peep-o.

462
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,120
I can only sleep.

463
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,120
Hank Shuo.

464
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,740
Wow.

465
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,560
Creepers, creepers.

466
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,280
Where'd you get them peepers?

467
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,140
Good morning, dear viewer.

468
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,340
Ah, good morning, Meantau.

469
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,880
Good morning, Meantau.

470
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,780
It's the morning weather forecast.

471
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,040
The sun keeps shining and the summer heat persists in our town.

472
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,080
The duration of this heat has already broken a Guinness record.

473
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,980
And it seems that the good weather isn't going anywhere.

474
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,640
Don't you have to, like, pay for Guinness records?

475
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
So what?

476
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,460
The weather's rich, huh?

477
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,080
Huh?

478
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,080
The weather's like, hey, buddy.

479
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,700
Slips them a little...

480
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,300
A little...

481
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,360
A little ten.

482
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Not always.

483
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,500
Oh, I see.

484
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,360
Can we trust this guy?

485
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,840
I don't know.

486
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,460
Can we trust anybody?

487
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,080
Seems that the good weather isn't going anywhere.

488
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,080
Scientists are closely monitoring solar activity and predict its intensification.

489
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,800
But they assure us there's no need to worry.

490
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,420
I think that's gonna change.

491
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,480
So grab your sunglasses, take your best swimsuits, and don't forget your hats.

492
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,260
And most importantly, make sure you don't get sunstroke.

493
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,040
Lately, there's been more weird behavior in the town.

494
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,280
And experts think it's because of too much sun.

495
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,020
We were right!

496
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,000
We were right!

497
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,420
We were right!

498
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,780
Too much sun!

499
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,960
Mm-hmm.

500
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,100
Too much sun!

501
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,160
Don't go outside.

502
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,020
Good morning, Minto.

503
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,880
Oh.

504
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, I have energy up here.

505
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,580
And this will waste one.

506
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,340
We gotta go talk to our cabinet.

507
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,860
Dweller.

508
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,720
Are you in here?

509
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,900
So this is our living room.

510
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,000
Is there some...

511
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,620
You just sit on the couch and don't do anything?

512
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,120
What's in here?

513
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,940
Oh, god!

514
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,280
Oh, wow!

515
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,140
This is not the cabinet.

516
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,480
Wow!

517
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,940
Kitchen?

518
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,780
We got ourselves a kitchen.

519
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,920
This is zero.

520
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,260
Wait.

521
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,500
My head's kind of blocking it.

522
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
But it says energy equals zero.

523
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,940
So maybe...

524
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,040
Oh, maybe that will waste all of my energy.

525
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Pantry?

526
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Oh, it skips the day!

527
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,380
I see, I see, I see.

528
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,980
And then our bathroom.

529
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,280
Look at that!

530
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,020
We got everything that we need here.

531
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,040
In our quaint little home.

532
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,280
Can I see outside?

533
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,770
I think the hallway would scare me at night.

534
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,730
But let's talk to...

535
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,030
To Joe Cabinet.

536
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,910
Did you see the newscast?

537
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,890
It's a nightmare!

538
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,970
Okay, in this heat, every dialogue is going to waste your energy.

539
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,470
So think hard about who you want to talk to.

540
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,150
And one more thing.

541
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,830
Checking people for signs of guests should be in the dialogue, too.

542
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,630
There's an actual solar storm passing next week.

543
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,400
How?

544
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,420
So be careful how you spend your energies.

545
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,660
If you decide you've talked to everyone and don't want to sleep, have a beer.

546
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,320
Go to the kitchen, have a cold one from the fridge.

547
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,440
It'll use up all your energy and you'll want to sleep right away.

548
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,460
So I'm just supposed to sit around and survive?

549
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,620
Yeah, beer o'clock, baby.

550
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,220
That's kind of weird, don't you think?

551
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,200
Let me preface this with a word, just in case.

552
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,380
During the day, you can talk to your house guests about all sorts of things.

553
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,060
Human things.

554
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,920
In dialogue with them, you can check for signs of fake people.

555
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,310
Toasty.

556
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:04,010
Next, you can decide what to do with those who are not human, in your opinion.

557
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,530
If you don't...

558
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,370
Sorry.

559
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,430
If you don't want to communicate with anyone else, but still have the strength, drink beer in the kitchen.

560
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,690
There's one in the fridge I brought you to chill.

561
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,350
It'll make you so sleepy.

562
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,610
I'm already sleepy.

563
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,370
And wait for help.

564
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,310
If they call an evacuation, stay close to my family.

565
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,810
Now have a beer and get some rest.

566
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,530
You look tired.

567
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,410
By the way, I heard that at night.

568
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,990
Someone walks around asking if you're home alone.

569
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,230
If you open the door, don't say that you're alone.

570
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,270
Well, you're in my cabinet, so I'm not going to say that.

571
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,870
Oh wait, my bad.

572
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,210
Oh no!

573
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,370
I used one!

574
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,070
I'm just supposed to sit around?

575
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:47,810
Okay.

576
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,030
Okay, I wasted one.

577
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,350
But it's fine, because I think we didn't have anything else to do.

578
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,790
Oops.

579
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,110
I can't look outside yet.

580
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,370
I think I have to just, uh...

581
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,510
Wait, let's go watch the TV.

582
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,810
This guy is speaking my language.

583
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,130
You watch graceful ballerinas gliding across the stage.

584
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,490
Performance beautiful...

585
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,310
Oh, performing beautiful pirouettes.

586
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,870
Wow.

587
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,250
My favorite channel.

588
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,710
Classical dance brings back warm childhood memories and makes you think of beautiful things.

589
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,830
At least most of these rooms don't have windows.

590
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,990
You know, so...

591
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,250
Nothing's going to crawl in, maybe.

592
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,030
Do you think that was like a ballerina blotch test?

593
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,970
Like...

594
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,810
Like, what do you see from the lines?

595
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,530
Oh my god.

596
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,510
A visitor?

597
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,630
You see several teenagers spending time in a field outside the window.

598
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,190
Wow.

599
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,790
They're sitting around chatting excitedly, not paying attention to you.

600
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,910
Kids, it's...

601
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,690
It's laid out!

602
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,430
Where are your parents?

603
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,430
Get home.

604
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,070
I guess they can't play in the...

605
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,730
Well...

606
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,050
The weather said...

607
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,950
The newsman said it wasn't so bad yet.

608
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,050
In the distance is the neighbor's house.

609
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,750
The neighbor is visiting, you know.

610
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,370
The lights are on in the windows and the family seems to be waiting for him to leave...

611
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,370
Uh...

612
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,690
To leave you back home for dinner.

613
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:34,610
Yeah.

614
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,750
Is this, like, this guy?

615
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,670
Oh.

616
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,170
I can't open the door, okay.

617
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,140
It's dead quiet outside.

618
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,660
Spooky!

619
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,620
Nobody's there.

620
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,180
Even the alcoholics, for some unknown reason, decided not to show up on the street.

621
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,200
Are they afraid of someone?

622
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,600
Who's here?

623
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,300
Vanilla, happy birthday!

624
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,420
Happy birthday to you.

625
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,320
Happy birthday to you.

626
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,700
Happy birthday, dear Vanilla.

627
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,320
Happy birthday to you.

628
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,820
Happy birthday!

629
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
Let's see who our first person is.

630
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,460
Oh, is my dad here?

631
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,260
Can you call him?

632
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,480
It wasn't scary during the day, but now it is.

633
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,120
A lot of people went out at night.

634
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,380
Uh... Tell me something about your dad.

635
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,780
I can tell you a lot.

636
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,980
Before he goes out, he likes to have a little beer.

637
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,820
He leaves me lunch, dinner, and... Oh.

638
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,160
I almost read beer!

639
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,600
Today I tried the beer!

640
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,960
Uh-oh.

641
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,800
You need some parental supervision.

642
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,820
Today I tried the beer he drinks.

643
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,400
Ugh.

644
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,280
It was awful.

645
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,520
I drink that when there's juice.

646
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,560
She's so... she's so real.

647
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,720
She's so real for that.

648
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,360
Oh, please don't tell him.

649
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,620
Um...

650
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,360
Did you get here safely?

651
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,240
You know...

652
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,580
It's like everything is turned upside down.

653
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,500
People now stay indoors or sleep during the day.

654
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
At night, they go out and do things.

655
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,780
I'm still not used to being afraid of the dark.

656
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,840
But it seems like there's nothing to fear.

657
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,200
Wait.

658
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,500
What do you mean you're not used to being afraid of the dark?

659
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,840
Would you ever be you?

660
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,880
Or is there?

661
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,040
Uh...

662
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,480
I'm calling Dad for you.

663
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,960
Good luck.

664
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,020
Have a good time!

665
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,260
We just send her on her way.

666
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,530
I think the translation of this game was a little rough.

667
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,470
Ah...

668
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,210
I see, I see, I see.

669
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,190
Um...

670
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,250
How do we know...

671
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,190
I mean, he did like beer.

672
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,310
But that's like...

673
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,810
It's also my B-Day.

674
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,530
I actually completely forgot until my sister texted me.

675
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,170
Happy birthday, Kamori!

676
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,730
Happy birthday to you.

677
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,790
Happy birthday to you.

678
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,290
Happy birthday, Kamori Asani.

679
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,690
Happy birthday to you.

680
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,890
Happy birthday, Kamori Asani.

681
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,470
Happy birthday, Kamori Asani.

682
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,190
Oh, she's probably fine.

683
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,250
I'll call for your dad.

684
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:38,970
Thanks.

685
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,970
Good luck to you, too.

686
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:41,650
We go now.

687
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm scared to be outside alone at night.

688
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,650
We're going to play a game.

689
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,350
He made some kind of game where you have to roll a dice.

690
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,630
And then walk on objects.

691
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,050
I mean, like a chair or a couch.

692
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,110
And then you have to build a road.

693
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,170
Anyway, I'll show you later.

694
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,290
What?

695
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,490
Oh!

696
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,470
Goodbye!

697
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,590
Bye!

698
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,010
Bye!

699
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,070
Oh!

700
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,670
I'll miss you, Possum!

701
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,690
I don't know.

702
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,550
Why would we even...

703
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,950
I don't think I know his name, though.

704
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,830
I just call him Possum.

705
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:12,650
So...

706
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,690
I don't...

707
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,670
I don't know...

708
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,250
Uh...

709
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,670
What...

710
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,810
If I had asked her what his name was, I don't think I would have gotten anything.

711
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,090
It's the creep family.

712
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,510
Do you think she gets it more from him or her mom?

713
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,190
I was hiding in the pub, but...

714
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,770
I was kicked out.

715
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:31,890
Why?

716
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,870
Not everyone can handle my temper.

717
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,290
It's not my birthday.

718
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,490
Well, happy un-birthday.

719
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,470
Not birthday.

720
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,950
Long man, look at those arms!

721
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,750
Wait, why are you telling me this?

722
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,310
You went inside my house, but you have a temper?

723
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,550
But look at them cheekbones!

724
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,810
Scarlett Johansson.

725
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,510
But I don't mean to offend anyone.

726
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,630
Don't get me wrong.

727
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,670
It's just...

728
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,230
Sometimes it gets sickening.

729
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,590
You know how it is.

730
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,730
What do you think?

731
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,750
Will you let me in?

732
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:06,970
Uh...

733
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,650
You're not a visitor, aren't you?

734
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,510
Are you sure there won't be any trouble with you?

735
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,130
Conjoined for the stream you did on my birthday.

736
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,050
Hope you feel better.

737
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,830
Annick!

738
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,230
Happy Evelyn birthday!

739
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,020
This guy's kind of long, but we have nothing to go off of.

740
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,580
He looks like the caveman from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.

741
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,640
Oh, let me sing happy...

742
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,080
Happy birthday to you!

743
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,500
Happy Happy Birthday to you!

744
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,060
Happy Birthday dear Annick!

745
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,060
Happy Birthday to you!

746
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,440
Sorry!

747
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,600
My brain is slow!

748
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,040
It's having a bad day!

749
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,740
I hope it's better!

750
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,340
I hope it gets better!

751
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,000
I might have to stop doing birthday songs again, you guys.

752
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,440
I'm not gonna lie because...

753
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,520
My throat has been so bad again recently.

754
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,520
I don't know why!

755
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,700
Ugh!

756
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,960
Ever since last week!

757
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,740
So I might have to stop doing birthday songs for the next...

758
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,540
Maybe even the next month or so.

759
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,660
Because I have so many things that I have to get done.

760
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,500
I have so many things I need to record!

761
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,760
So...

762
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,760
Yeah...

763
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,040
I was screaming during Doki's stream.

764
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,580
Yeah, but my throat hurted...

765
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,220
Hurted?

766
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,360
But...

767
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,960
I...

768
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,740
It was even before then though, so...

769
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,900
I feel like I'm falling apart recently.

770
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm so sorry, you guys.

771
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,760
Oh, let's just...

772
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,840
You're not a visitor!

773
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,200
You think I'm one of those monsters?

774
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,860
No, I'm no visitor.

775
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,540
But asking everyone to keep their face about it is just crazy.

776
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,940
Thank you for that day gift!

777
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,560
Thank you!

778
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,680
Thank you!

779
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,120
Anyway, it will be like that from now on.

780
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,080
Oh...

781
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,060
Why did they kick you out of your last shelter?

782
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,260
I love that you take a few moments to sing happy birthday.

783
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,440
Thank you!

784
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,920
I try!

785
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,220
Oh...

786
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,100
No answer?

787
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:25,860
Oh...

788
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,040
I was thinking of...

789
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,140
Thinking to tell you something offensive, but I changed my mind.

790
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,080
I told you, people just felt uncomfortable with me there.

791
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,960
There were all sorts of weirdos.

792
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,800
When I think about it, maybe it was for the best that they kicked me out.

793
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,700
Those would've...

794
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,760
Those would've...

795
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,320
Those would've eaten me alive and not even noticed.

796
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,960
Wow, he is...

797
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,500
Nobody else is the weirdo...

798
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,000
Or wait...

799
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,660
Wait...

800
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,120
I'm not the weirdo!

801
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,320
Everyone else is weird!

802
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,560
I kind of understand.

803
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,740
Come on in!

804
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,020
Oh!

805
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,660
He's got a nice little smile!

806
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,660
Thanks.

807
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,680
Trusting people nowadays is worth no more than a coin.

808
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,800
Maybe that's why I appreciate your trust.

809
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,720
Maybe.

810
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,960
Alright, I can't promise anything.

811
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,440
Okay.

812
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,040
Anyone else?

813
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,300
Oh!

814
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,600
Gosh!

815
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,460
Busy house!

816
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Where is he?

817
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,100
Pre-record...

818
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,880
No, I feel like that's so disingenuous.

819
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,000
Ha ha ha ha!

820
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,040
Ha ha ha ha!

821
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:35,900
Uh...

822
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,040
Oh!

823
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,560
Sorry for disturbing you so late.

824
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,320
It's just too hot during the day.

825
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,920
The TV said it's better not to go out in the sun.

826
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,020
Is there any corner for me?

827
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,240
Uh...

828
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,600
Uh...

829
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,540
Who are you?

830
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,660
I used to live closer to the town.

831
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,560
The asphalt heats up pretty intensely out there.

832
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,000
Ha ha!

833
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,200
I used to work as a cashier.

834
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
Not anymore though.

835
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,140
I got fired.

836
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,140
Just didn't have any luck with work.

837
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,300
You got fired from being a cashier?

838
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,100
Uh...

839
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,980
What do you think will happen in the future?

840
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,000
Such a...

841
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Such a...

842
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,020
Wow.

843
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,660
Such a deep question.

844
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,520
I don't know.

845
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,780
Will I survive?

846
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,020
Who will help me?

847
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,040
How long will I have to search for help?

848
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,140
Wait, so then all the stores, are they just open at night now?

849
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,240
I won't request a birthday song next week.

850
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,160
Of course you can still say it's your birthday and I'll wish you a happy birthday.

851
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,710
I don't know what will happen next.

852
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,650
I can't even guess.

853
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,890
Aren't you scared by this?

854
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,830
I am.

855
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,930
Very much so.

856
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,530
You need to go to a doctor.

857
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,790
What if this...

858
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,310
I...

859
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,430
Okay, I'm not convinced that this isn't just two people in a t-shirt.

860
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:10,230
I'm not convinced that there's not someone hiding underneath that t-shirt.

861
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,050
You were...

862
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,170
You were a cashier?

863
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,310
No.

864
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,410
You would have...

865
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,070
You would have been more believable if you said you were a gamer.

866
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,670
I had this haircut when I was 13.

867
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,010
Who do you think works as cashiers, Minto?

868
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,810
So...

869
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,470
What?

870
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,150
No.

871
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,350
She smuggled the cash register in her shirt.

872
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,470
She got a little scoliosis.

873
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,170
She's scared, but...

874
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,330
Lord Farquaad looking rough.

875
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,090
Ah, Greg.

876
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,350
Welcome to Bubbleship.

877
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,910
Thank you.

878
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,730
Okay, we'll be nice for now.

879
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,570
Thank you.

880
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,650
Oh, thank you, really.

881
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,250
Oh, God, I'll live one more day.

882
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:11,810
Oh.

883
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,290
No one else will come tonight.

884
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,610
Okay, I guess, uh...

885
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,750
I guess nothing else happens in...

886
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,310
In the windows.

887
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,910
Oh, the children are still there.

888
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,450
Why do people need to stay at my house?

889
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,190
Don't they have their own houses?

890
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,690
Like those children, are they gonna ask to stay at my house?

891
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:37,880
Oh.

892
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,220
We interrupt our morning show for an urgent message.

893
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,340
Tell my brother Mason happy birthday.

894
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,880
Oh!

895
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,980
Happy birthday, Mason!

896
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,960
Come on!

897
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,020
Yeah.

898
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,300
Today at 628 AM, there was a powerful solar energy eruption.

899
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,600
This flare was larger than scientists predicted.

900
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,340
The air temperature has reached a critical level.

901
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,540
Authorities have declared a state of emergency.

902
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,120
Oh, Nyaru!

903
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Thank you so much for the rain!

904
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:11,960
Thank you!

905
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,240
Thank you!

906
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,340
Welcome, welcome, Raiders.

907
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,980
We urge all citizens to avoid going outside during daylight hours.

908
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,800
Marilyn!

909
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,300
Nookie!

910
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,280
Thank you so much for the gifted!

911
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:25,940
Thank you!

912
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,440
Now on to the news.

913
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,420
Aliens?

914
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,060
People emerging from underground?

915
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,760
No, this isn't a sci-fi story or a tabloid headline!

916
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,920
And Draco, thank you so much for the gifted.

917
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,280
Eyewitnesses report contact with visitors around the city.

918
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,900
One witness encountered a middle-aged man who had perfectly white teeth.

919
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,280
It turns out he was one of these visitors.

920
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,640
Pay attention to their teeth.

921
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,840
Oh, gosh.

922
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,980
Sorry if you had a good dental routine.

923
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,220
Hello?

924
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,720
Um, I think there's more to be concerned about here, though, no?

925
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,880
This person had a whole...

926
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,980
Whole surgery done.

927
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,740
Brow lift.

928
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,460
Rhinoplasty.

929
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,480
Chin...

930
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,380
Injection?

931
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,940
What is this?

932
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,540
Similar incidents with visitors sporting perfect teeth have been observed.

933
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,180
They're jealous of how big his chin is.

934
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,700
He's his...

935
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,600
Mewing king.

936
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,940
Should not view...

937
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,320
Should have not viewed that hard.

938
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,680
Yeah.

939
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,420
So if you want to identify them, check their teeth.

940
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,300
Please stay alert and calm.

941
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,260
Let's move on to other news.

942
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,320
Alright.

943
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,040
Guess we gotta go check her.

944
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,900
Long man's teeth.

945
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,360
Hello, long man.

946
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,680
Yeah, did you want something?

947
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,800
Uh...

948
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,540
What do you know about the cataclysm?

949
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,200
I need to check on you.

950
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,720
How do you recognize a visitor?

951
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,680
Uh...

952
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,260
What is the cataclysm?

953
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,760
The sun is exploding.

954
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,660
There's a real hell on Earth.

955
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,380
Without metaphors and purgatory.

956
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,240
No one trusts anyone.

957
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,920
People are literally being burned alive during the day.

958
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,580
And people are ready to sell their own mothers for shelter.

959
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,080
I want to believe in people.

960
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,800
But it's so hard to do so.

961
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,780
Can I check your teeth?

962
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,520
Teeth.

963
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,300
Do you want to see my teeth?

964
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,560
Well, look at them.

965
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,680
They still have the taste of unhappiness and smoke on them.

966
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh!

967
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,480
Those aren't perfect.

968
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:52,860
Those...

969
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,000
Are not perfect.

970
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:56,860
The...

971
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,700
The visitors all have veneers.

972
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,300
Thank you.

973
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,780
I'm glad my streams make you happy.

974
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
The nonogram stream got me addicted to the tower.

975
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,060
I think he's good.

976
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,080
Yellowish, huh?

977
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,160
Well, don't F with me with your tests.

978
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm not a visitor.

979
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,600
Okay...

980
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,400
Lady?

981
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,080
Where you at, lady?

982
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,080
I like how I have, like, these...

983
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,800
Like...

984
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,940
Is that supposed to be Marilyn Monroe over there?

985
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,700
This is why I stay out of San Francisco.

986
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,360
What's in San Francisco?

987
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,040
Wow!

988
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,100
We have, like, a water...

989
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,800
A water heater, even.

990
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,200
Wow.

991
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,320
Oh!

992
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:45,490
Uh-huh.

993
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,350
Hopefully this will all be over soon.

994
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,770
I need to check on you.

995
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,770
What do you want to check?

996
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,330
Your teeth.

997
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:54,690
Huh?

998
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,850
Are you going to make decisions based on teeth?

999
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:57,890
Uh-oh.

1000
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,250
I've had my teeth fixed recently.

1001
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,390
Although, to be honest...

1002
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,590
I can't remember when I've been to the dentist.

1003
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,350
Have I even been to one?

1004
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,430
Wait, how'd you get your teeth fixed, then?

1005
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:14,170
What?

1006
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,370
Oh, golly.

1007
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,810
We shouldn't have let this lady in.

1008
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:19,710
Uh...

1009
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,290
What?

1010
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,530
Where did you get your teeth fixed?

1011
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,630
How did you get them fixed if you went...

1012
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,250
Uh...

1013
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,150
Some...

1014
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,970
Back alley...

1015
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,890
Sussy...

1016
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,330
Operation.

1017
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,890
How do you know that you got your fixed...

1018
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,450
Or your teeth fixed recently, but you don't know?

1019
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,530
Uh...

1020
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,050
God, I can't even remember what I ate yesterday because of fear.

1021
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,090
Oh!

1022
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,390
Everyone in Hollywood would be like...

1023
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,550
So in trouble if this were...

1024
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,450
If this were an actual indicator.

1025
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,910
Everybody with their stinking veneers...

1026
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,470
They would all be like...

1027
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,670
Oh!

1028
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:03,410
Oh!

1029
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,170
Let me just pop my tooth out!

1030
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,710
Let all get those lit.

1031
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,210
Um...

1032
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,850
Does that...

1033
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,190
Do I fit the description?

1034
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,250
Oh!

1035
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,930
That can't be...

1036
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,670
That can't be a visitor, yes?

1037
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,070
Uh...

1038
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,890
I'll hear...

1039
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,990
I'll hear her out!

1040
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:28,990
Blammo!

1041
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,810
Take her out!

1042
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,730
What if she eats me?

1043
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,790
What if she eats me?

1044
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:38,550
Um...

1045
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,510
I don't even know where I'm pointing this thing.

1046
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,030
Hahaha!

1047
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,890
Shoot!

1048
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,850
I feel like I'm being peer pressured into murder.

1049
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:46,610
Hahaha!

1050
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,270
Is this hazing?

1051
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,210
Is this a hazing ritual?

1052
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:52,950
Um...

1053
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,130
She doesn't look human?

1054
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,470
She looks like the girl from...

1055
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,710
Uh...

1056
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,370
What's that movie?

1057
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,290
The Fifth Element.

1058
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,490
You never trusted that shoulder.

1059
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,310
I still think there's...

1060
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:05,730
You know what?

1061
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,190
No!

1062
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:09,430
No!

1063
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:09,570
Please!

1064
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,030
Don't!

1065
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,160
Maybe we should've heard her out.

1066
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,260
Uh...

1067
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:22,560
Ooh!

1068
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,900
I'm just gonna clean that up.

1069
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,240
We have no visitors in our...

1070
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,640
They don't come through the tubs, do they?

1071
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,840
I guess we'll watch TV since I have one more, uh...

1072
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,440
One more energy.

1073
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,920
Every time chat is going to tell you to do the most horrific thing possible.

1074
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm not listening to chat.

1075
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm listening to my own instincts.

1076
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,140
Heat outside?

1077
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,020
No problem.

1078
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,020
When you have...

1079
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,230
Energica in hand...

1080
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,580
This refreshing energy drink quenches thirst even in the hottest heat.

1081
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
A unique blend of lime and...

1082
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,560
Gives extraordinary energy!

1083
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,920
You put the lime in the mint...

1084
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,070
And shake it all...

1085
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,980
Meets back on the many boys!

1086
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,120
Energica!

1087
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,200
Look for it in nearby stores!

1088
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,640
Dynamic energy drink advertisement.

1089
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,440
Subtly satisfying your thirst.

1090
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,080
What do you mean, subtly?

1091
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,300
Okay.

1092
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:27,840
Time for sleepy.

1093
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,720
Oh wait, let's look out the window.

1094
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,780
Outside the window stands a neighbor and his daughter.

1095
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,180
Oh, that's the guy from before, no?

1096
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,160
They play happily together, forgetting the horror that is happening.

1097
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,600
Just for a moment.

1098
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,260
Watching this makes you remember your childhood.

1099
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,380
It gives you a warm feeling of nostalgia.

1100
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,080
Aww...

1101
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,540
Aww...

1102
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,260
The bodies of teenagers are...

1103
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,220
On the ground!

1104
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
They're... napping?

1105
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,940
Someone killed them!

1106
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,380
They're not napping?

1107
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,700
Lime and mint, mojito?

1108
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,440
It seems to be recent, because the blood hasn't dried yet.

1109
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,720
The picture gives you goosebumps and makes you feel a little uneasy.

1110
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,800
Oh...

1111
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,800
This is...

1112
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,920
Oh gosh, this reminds...

1113
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,660
This looks like a picture...

1114
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,940
Like a scene from that...

1115
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,000
Storybook.

1116
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,840
The scariest stories...

1117
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,660
Tell in the...

1118
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,860
The dark...

1119
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,300
Sorry, my brain isn't...

1120
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,860
Blub...

1121
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,340
Blub...

1122
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,080
He looks friendly...

1123
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,760
I wish he'd put on a shirt!

1124
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,740
On the path stands a man as pale as death itself.

1125
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,440
There are strange folds in his skin.

1126
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,500
This skin seems to be too big...

1127
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,620
Wait, they really are skinwalkers!

1128
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,400
Seems to be too big for him!

1129
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,460
You can't see his eyes from here, but you can feel him...

1130
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,080
Drilling you with his gaze.

1131
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,640
He's just gotta fill in...

1132
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,660
He's just...

1133
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,840
He's a growing boy!

1134
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,060
You feel fear and pray to God that the creepy visitor will avoid the house.

1135
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,800
Is that one of the alcoholics they were talking about?

1136
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,700
I expected more like...

1137
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,040
Matarakan...

1138
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,060
Image, but...

1139
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,800
Oh, hello!

1140
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,000
Let me tell you right away...

1141
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,380
I'm not afraid of the heat...

1142
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,340
But I'm still looking for a quiet place.

1143
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,780
Can I find peace at your place?

1144
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,820
Who are you?

1145
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,340
How long have you been looking for a peaceful place?

1146
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,340
Hmmm...

1147
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,720
Peace!

1148
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,120
Welcome to membership!

1149
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,660
I like how she didn't even...

1150
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,180
None of these people even say hello!

1151
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,920
She's like...

1152
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,820
I'm not afraid of the heat!

1153
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,200
I'm not afraid of the heat!

1154
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,360
How long have you been looking for a peaceful place?

1155
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,140
There's never been any peace for me.

1156
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,000
So yeah...

1157
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,180
A long time.

1158
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,940
Matara is too grotesque to put in a game!

1159
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,220
So true!

1160
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,200
Take off your jacket!

1161
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,240
I think I'm a freak!

1162
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,900
Are you okay with the heat?

1163
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,920
Wait, why is she wearing a jacket anyway?

1164
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,320
Isn't it supposed to be mega hot?

1165
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,280
Kevin!

1166
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,280
Welcome to membership!

1167
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,020
Thank you!

1168
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,740
Alright, take off your jacket!

1169
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,040
No.

1170
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,200
It's okay if you won't let me in.

1171
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,400
I'll just keep moving.

1172
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,220
I'm not gonna beg or bother you.

1173
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,300
Okay, come on in!

1174
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,120
The ceiling is a little low here.

1175
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,240
Never mind, we're gonna kill her.

1176
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,620
Don't complain about my...

1177
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,780
My cute little cottage house!

1178
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,400
It's cottagecore!

1179
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,160
Where are you?

1180
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,080
Where are you?

1181
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,760
Is that guy still there?

1182
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,940
Wait...

1183
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,820
I thought he was closer for a second.

1184
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,700
He looks spooky.

1185
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,280
Oh, whoa!

1186
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Jack Black!

1187
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,580
How fortunate we are!

1188
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,200
We've witnessed first-hand the consequences of human passions!

1189
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,140
I am Steve.

1190
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,920
The earth will be cleansed, the sun will do its work.

1191
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,520
And we will go to a new clean world!

1192
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,480
Yeah!

1193
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,800
Oh, wow.

1194
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,500
I'm sorry.

1195
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,940
I'm really sorry for that.

1196
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,840
I'm really sorry about that.

1197
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,400
That's the effing good news!

1198
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,580
What?

1199
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,750
What are you doing, human?

1200
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,230
Listen to me.

1201
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,910
I'll give you a brief rundown.

1202
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,950
The sun burns and burns us for a reason.

1203
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,090
It bakes seeds out of us.

1204
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,410
Okay, I definitely think this guy is human.

1205
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,650
We've all done all sorts of things, and now the sun is angry!

1206
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,590
Give his head to us!

1207
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,530
What does that mean?

1208
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,270
Yeah, I think that he's part of some sort of sun cult.

1209
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,120
He's weird but harmless.

1210
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,420
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

1211
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,960
You-you-you-you-you-you-been!

1212
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,300
The sun's so hot, it feels like lava outside!

1213
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,560
Hey, Ben Robez!

1214
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,280
Thank you so much, Mr. Thank you, Mr. Thank you!

1215
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,760
Mr.

1216
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,300
Thank you!

1217
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,480
That's a good thing.

1218
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,760
All our sins will be over.

1219
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,860
We'll live our lives properly.

1220
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,360
Uh... What's... Wait.

1221
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,060
You mean we all have to die?

1222
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,800
Nah.

1223
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,580
Sins will fade away.

1224
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,580
The sun may die, but we will live.

1225
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,240
There will be no more deaths.

1226
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,600
No more stealing.

1227
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,420
No more greedy bastards who can't sell me what I want for a fair price.

1228
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,760
Can you imagine such a thing?

1229
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,920
Do you realize what this is all about?

1230
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,160
Wait, we're gonna let him in after that?

1231
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,660
Um... Hmm...

1232
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,700
Jack, welcome to membership.

1233
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,320
Thank you!

1234
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,960
I think he's... I think he's human.

1235
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,040
I can tell you a lot more about all this.

1236
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,420
Do you have any beer?

1237
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,440
I forgot to ask.

1238
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,970
So now we have...

1239
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,490
Three people.

1240
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,810
We have room for...

1241
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,250
Two more, I guess, I hope.

1242
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,330
As long as they don't mind the body in the pantry, you know.

1243
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,070
We just invited Steve.

1244
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:34,410
Oh!

1245
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:34,590
Oh!

1246
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,890
Too bad we are the witnesses.

1247
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,710
Maybe we are... participants too.

1248
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:43,730
Uh, what do you need anything?

1249
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,270
No thanks.

1250
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,170
Everything I need is already there.

1251
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,870
And what I don't have, you can't help me with.

1252
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,350
Well, you read my fortune.

1253
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,290
Choose where I should open the book and read a lot.

1254
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,890
Uh...

1255
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,890
What are you talking about?

1256
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,010
You're weird.

1257
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:06,170
If you don't need anything, then leave?

1258
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,290
What are you talking about?

1259
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,030
That's how you look at it.

1260
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,710
What do my words mean to you?

1261
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,830
Will you read my fortune from a book?

1262
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,470
Howie Mandel?

1263
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:22,930
Deal or no deal?

1264
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,230
Human or not human?

1265
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,670
Uh...

1266
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,790
Open at the beginning, top paragraph.

1267
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,590
Open near the middle, last paragraph.

1268
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,250
Let's do the middle.

1269
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,650
The dead will come and tell.

1270
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,890
And he will not be believed.

1271
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,830
What does that mean?

1272
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,670
I need to think now.

1273
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,090
Maybe I'll see you later.

1274
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:43,670
Oh!

1275
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:44,990
I didn't have to let him in.

1276
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,650
He left himself.

1277
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,210
Why are you bothering me?

1278
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,590
Why are you...

1279
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,610
Why did you come to my house then?

1280
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,490
Oh, no one else will come tonight.

1281
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:58,890
Okay.

1282
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:04,470
We are a house full of completely only humans.

1283
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,570
I hope I don't die in the middle of the night.

1284
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,150
Oh!

1285
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,130
Good morning, Minto.

1286
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,770
This is the morning news.

1287
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,870
Solar activity remains abnormal.

1288
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,750
And experts predict that it will continue to intensify.

1289
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,950
There are continuing reports from eyewitnesses about encounters with visitors.

1290
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:25,770
You know...

1291
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,690
What this makes me think of is...

1292
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,510
What makes...

1293
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,770
What makes...

1294
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,010
What...

1295
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,830
This makes me think of is...

1296
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,370
Basically, what's going on...

1297
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,710
On, like, planet Earth...

1298
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,450
When Outer Wilds is happening.

1299
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,830
Robot Kitchen, happy birthday!

1300
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,150
Unfortunately...

1301
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,710
I'm sorry.

1302
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,410
I'm so sorry.

1303
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:48,670
I can't do a birthday song.

1304
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,170
But I will wish you a happy, happy, happy birthday!

1305
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,170
Yeah.

1306
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:53,270
Yeah.

1307
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,150
True.

1308
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,510
In response to the situation, authorities urgently ramped up FEMA operations.

1309
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,370
Actually, I am gonna grab a cough drop, too.

1310
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:11,830
Let me grab one.

1311
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,080
I accidentally grabbed two.

1312
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,200
That's fine.

1313
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,140
FEMA is an acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

1314
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,640
FEMA...

1315
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,380
Stuff?

1316
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,480
Members?

1317
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,560
What?

1318
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,180
Staff?

1319
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,560
FEMA staff members wear yellow hazmat suit.

1320
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,820
The FEMA special committee started functioning recently.

1321
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,860
But they have discovered a new indicator of visitors.

1322
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,320
Oh.

1323
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,240
The Stuff members.

1324
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,120
Oh my gosh, Briar.

1325
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,540
I was literally thinking that.

1326
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,620
Stuff member has died.

1327
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,360
I was literally thinking...

1328
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,040
I was about to say it and then I saw your comment.

1329
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,540
That's crazy.

1330
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,140
Doing stuff.

1331
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:22,680
Stuff.

1332
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,380
Of course you were.

1333
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:33,660
The FEMA special committee experts believe that besides teeth, visitors can be identified by dirt under their nails.

1334
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,880
Oh, because they crawl out from the...

1335
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,180
Yeah, as reported by FEMA, this was discovered during an inspection of one of the houses.

1336
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,000
FEMA...

1337
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,740
NUTS!

1338
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,200
...

1339
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,270
Employees encountered a woman who had worked as a nurse.

1340
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,650
For some unknown reason, she had dirt under her nails.

1341
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,350
God forbid a lady has hobbies.

1342
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:06,170
Given that visitors emerged from the ground, the woman was taken in for testing.

1343
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,090
Her dangerous status was confirmed.

1344
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,450
If you notice anyone resembling a visitor...

1345
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,030
Promptly contact FEMA.

1346
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,370
Members are called the hotline at 0451.

1347
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:22,850
Please stay alert and calm and avoid leaving your home during daylight hours.

1348
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,450
Now let's move on to the...

1349
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,990
What other news could there be?

1350
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,650
What else could be going on?

1351
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:31,810
Tall man!

1352
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:32,650
Oh!

1353
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,380
Yeah, did you want something?

1354
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,440
I don't like how close they're sitting next to them.

1355
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,860
Uh, I need to check on you.

1356
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,180
Long-haired bitch with a dream!

1357
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,860
Thank you, Rodrigo!

1358
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,280
I'm embarrassed about the article, but thank you!

1359
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,480
How many people did we let in?

1360
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,540
Let in her?

1361
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,740
Let in Jack Black?

1362
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,380
So we should be able...

1363
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,060
I wanna ask...

1364
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,700
This guy seems pretty reasonable, you know?

1365
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,860
How many victims are there?

1366
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:08,980
Hundreds?

1367
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,080
Oh, thousands?

1368
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,480
Hundreds of thousands?

1369
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,920
Millions?

1370
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,060
Honestly, I have absolutely no idea.

1371
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,780
No one will tell you.

1372
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,120
So you don't piss your pants in fear.

1373
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,300
No matter what number you come up with...

1374
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,000
Triple it.

1375
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,700
One...

1376
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,600
Billion...

1377
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,620
Quadrillion...

1378
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,440
Million...

1379
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:28,240
Ultra...

1380
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:29,980
Zillion...

1381
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,200
Bangdillion?

1382
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,100
Triple that!

1383
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,860
It's probably closer to the actual number of victims.

1384
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,200
I wish there was some warmth!

1385
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,620
This lady is freaking...

1386
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,780
I don't think we should've let her in.

1387
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,920
Oh, I need to check on you.

1388
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,080
What do you wanna check?

1389
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,520
Let me see them hands.

1390
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,200
Nails?

1391
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:57,980
I'll show you.

1392
01:00:59,380 --> 01:00:59,840
Hmm...

1393
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,840
Looks like I chipped them...

1394
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,880
All or something.

1395
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,740
Chipped them all?

1396
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,420
Let's take a look anyway.

1397
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:04,920
Oh!

1398
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,100
Oh!

1399
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:06,960
Oh!

1400
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:07,640
Oh!

1401
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,580
Oh!

1402
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,460
Oh!

1403
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,380
Oh!

1404
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,960
Chipped them, you say?

1405
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,820
Do you think my fingernails fit the sign of a visitor?

1406
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,440
Oh!

1407
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,540
Got it.

1408
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,680
There's like nothing...

1409
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,960
Nothing behind those eyes.

1410
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,000
Except...

1411
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,780
The craving of human flesh.

1412
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:41,860
Probably.

1413
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:45,840
Umm...

1414
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,160
Fire in the hole!

1415
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,320
You know what?

1416
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:49,920
Oh!

1417
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,860
I didn't even get to re...

1418
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:51,980
Oh!

1419
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,000
Mister, you can move!

1420
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,080
You can change rooms!

1421
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,880
Do you think we can fix her with a manicure?

1422
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:58,740
Get her some...

1423
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,240
Some press-ons.

1424
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,640
And she'll be looking dandy.

1425
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,620
I need to check on your nails.

1426
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,200
Where did they even come from?

1427
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,860
Dirt under the fingernails?

1428
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,240
Is that supposed to be a sign?

1429
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,740
They can just wash their hands!

1430
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,980
That's all it takes!

1431
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,400
Well, clearly they...

1432
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,080
Don't!

1433
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,460
How do you know she was a human?

1434
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,700
So what, every gardener is a visitor now?

1435
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,420
That's ridiculous!

1436
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,900
Look at the nails!

1437
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,100
My man's clean!

1438
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,200
What do you mean?

1439
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,980
A pat his head.

1440
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,960
Well, am I a visitor?

1441
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,240
Of course not.

1442
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,220
I think we did the right thing!

1443
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,240
Why would all of her nails be off?

1444
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,860
Why is she cold, but literally the sun is melting the planet?

1445
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,130
I think we...

1446
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,350
I think...

1447
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:57,370
I think we're fine!

1448
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,650
I don't think we're fine!

1449
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,350
Hello?

1450
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:05,990
Are you hungry?

1451
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,130
What was that?

1452
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,850
Hello?

1453
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,090
Oh no, wait!

1454
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,530
Who are the visitors?

1455
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,830
Oh gosh, I just wasted up the energy.

1456
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,890
There's something humanity has never faced before.

1457
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:29,610
They just slap a label on something unknown and hate it.

1458
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,410
As if this has never happened before.

1459
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:33,150
I don't think it has.

1460
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,230
People are fundamentally flawed.

1461
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,330
What can you do?

1462
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,810
Okay, we're gonna...

1463
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,680
Uh-oh!

1464
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:02,740
She's a cat!

1465
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,640
Big kitty!

1466
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,200
Oh, look!

1467
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,040
We cleaned her up!

1468
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:06,580
Perfect!

1469
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,040
Um...

1470
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:10,900
Is he in the bathroom?

1471
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:11,720
Oh, hello!

1472
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,460
I listen to your words, human!

1473
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,200
Speak!

1474
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,660
I need to check on you.

1475
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,140
Me...

1476
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,480
When there's no minto...

1477
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,800
Show me your...

1478
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:30,940
Hands!

1479
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,540
No taboo, my friend!

1480
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,020
Watch my nails as long as you like!

1481
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,960
I've trained myself to get useful sunlight with them!

1482
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,680
And open beer caps!

1483
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:42,400
Oh!

1484
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,600
I look clean to me!

1485
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,260
Okay...

1486
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,520
Clean as a whistle, yeah.

1487
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,540
Did you...

1488
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:02,840
Uh...

1489
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,660
Just wanna check it out?

1490
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,360
I thought...

1491
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:05,560
Ugh!

1492
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,420
You're just an evil man!

1493
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,040
What the...

1494
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,220
I let you into my hole!

1495
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,720
You're sitting on my washing machine!

1496
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,400
But I'm evil?

1497
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,780
You think this guy's still growling over here?

1498
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:21,680
You guys, I can't check his teeth because I don't have any more energies!

1499
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,180
I accidentally wasted one.

1500
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,320
It's okay.

1501
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,620
We probably...

1502
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,240
Won't die.

1503
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,560
Oh, sorry.

1504
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,040
I forgot to check the window over here.

1505
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:49,940
Oh!

1506
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,320
Oh!

1507
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,220
Gosh!

1508
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,080
I thought they were zombies!

1509
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,400
They're a small group of FEMA staff standing outside a neighbor's house.

1510
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,480
Wait, our neighbor!

1511
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,520
I wonder what they're talking about.

1512
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:02,800
Maybe they're taking soil samples.

1513
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,400
Or they are looking for a place to set up base.

1514
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,000
Makes you feel a little better to think that someone is trying to make sense of this nightmare.

1515
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,080
Yeah, I'm right outside our house.

1516
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:11,580
We are...

1517
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,920
We are so good to go.

1518
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,720
We are so safe.

1519
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,620
Corporate zombies!

1520
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,460
Oh, look!

1521
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,040
The bodies of teenagers burned to death on the ground!

1522
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,820
The sun burned them!

1523
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,260
They seem to have been lying here all day.

1524
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,540
Two emergency workers are standing next to the bodies and writing something down.

1525
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,620
It's good that there are those who can remove the bodies.

1526
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,300
It's scary to imagine what kind of contagion could appear.

1527
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,580
The rotting bodies are not removed from the streets.

1528
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,680
I mean, if they're burnt to a crisp...

1529
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,300
It doesn't seem like they'll have any contagion.

1530
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,560
It sounds like jerky to me!

1531
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:50,900
Nice!

1532
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,400
There's a group of armed soldiers outside the window.

1533
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,200
Oh my gosh!

1534
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,680
They're all...

1535
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,860
They're all...

1536
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,460
Grouping around our house!

1537
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,500
We're gonna be so safe.

1538
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,780
Chicken jerky!

1539
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,860
Apparently there are small units sent here from the city to provide security for the EC.

1540
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,960
Human jerky finds!

1541
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,700
Thank you!

1542
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,680
Whenever I work at the office, I have your VODs livestreams on my second monitor.

1543
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,320
Now if any of my colleagues ask about you, I can show them your business insider interview!

1544
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,320
I'm so...

1545
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,440
I'm so legit now, no?

1546
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:32,920
Thank you!

1547
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,140
Thank you!

1548
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:42,320
You can only hear bits and pieces of phrases from about a pale man with a bare torso!

1549
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,280
No, it was a pale torso.

1550
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,620
He was shirtless.

1551
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,020
He wasn't a bear at all.

1552
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,340
In fact, I don't think he had hair.

1553
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,760
Maybe they want to track down that creepy stranger.

1554
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,920
You feel relieved that there are people ready to deal with a dangerous guest on the streets.

1555
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,090
Who is it?

1556
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:06,830
Oh!

1557
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,460
Is that our guy?

1558
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,620
No way.

1559
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,220
It's the man from the thumbnail!

1560
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,740
Um...

1561
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,520
Who are you?

1562
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,120
How's it going there?

1563
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,460
Is everything...

1564
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,300
Okay?

1565
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,880
Well...

1566
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,800
He couldn't even grow nipples.

1567
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,120
He's so wide, but his arms are so skinny.

1568
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,700
He's got them perfect teeth!

1569
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:48,900
Um...

1570
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,300
What do you want?

1571
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,440
Listen...

1572
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,780
Are you alone in the house?

1573
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,260
Just curious.

1574
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,860
You're just reading someone's fortune.

1575
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,700
Promising salvation to some.

1576
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,820
Driving some away.

1577
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,080
Uh...

1578
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,200
What if I say I'm alone?

1579
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,310
They said not to tell the creepy...

1580
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,880
Creepy guy that you're alone.

1581
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,060
And what if he knows I'm lying?

1582
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,280
One Piece character.

1583
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,700
I wouldn't.

1584
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,660
Intrusive thoughts, Pinky.

1585
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,340
Don't do it.

1586
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,700
I'm just so curious!

1587
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,300
He'll kill me!

1588
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:31,600
Really?

1589
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,400
I don't want to start the game over, though.

1590
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,640
Is the game over, actually?

1591
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,600
Oh, I don't want to start the game over.

1592
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,980
I have other people taking shelter here.

1593
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,780
I gotta go...

1594
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,280
Bye, nun!

1595
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,940
Have a good day.

1596
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,620
You're lucky tonight.

1597
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,740
Yeah, I am getting lucky tonight.

1598
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:55,100
Uh...

1599
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,900
I can hear someone whispering in your rooms.

1600
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,960
But who knows what will happen tomorrow.

1601
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:03,500
Okay.

1602
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,700
Hey, you guys!

1603
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,820
He was right there!

1604
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:09,820
You guys!

1605
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,840
He was at my door!

1606
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,020
You guys are blind!

1607
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:15,880
Did it...

1608
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,560
Did anyone knock?

1609
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,300
Oh!

1610
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,060
Oh my god!

1611
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,600
Can I rest at your place?

1612
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:22,920
Your...

1613
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:24,180
Your...

1614
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,780
Your friend is drunk?

1615
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:31,960
Wait...

1616
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,480
I've gotten some bruises.

1617
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,440
Wait...

1618
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:35,480
I've gotten some bruises.

1619
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:35,540
What?

1620
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,240
Melty!

1621
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,400
Happy birthday!

1622
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:38,680
Happy birthday!

1623
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,780
I think it's your birthday?

1624
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,060
I'm kinda confused.

1625
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:44,860
Have...

1626
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,940
Don't hurt yourself.

1627
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,320
Can I rest at your place?

1628
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,860
Uh...

1629
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,800
Where did you come from?

1630
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,160
I don't remember anymore.

1631
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,020
I don't care about it.

1632
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,680
I'm very tired.

1633
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,640
If I don't get some rest, I'll just collapse from exhaustion.

1634
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,180
Uh...

1635
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,060
Does your friend need help?

1636
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:10,860
Um...

1637
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:11,460
Not anymore.

1638
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,780
When he needed it, no one helped.

1639
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,580
Oh!

1640
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,680
He's not asleep?

1641
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,020
Oh...

1642
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,280
Now he's dead.

1643
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,780
He might be alive if...

1644
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,660
Anyone gave a hoot.

1645
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,420
I...

1646
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,780
That's like two mouths to fit.

1647
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:37,950
Um...

1648
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:41,450
I don't want a stinky corpse in my home.

1649
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,580
What if he...

1650
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,160
What if he turns into a zombie?

1651
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,880
And then he starts feasting on all of our brains.

1652
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,960
That's the second mouth, you guys.

1653
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:56,680
We don't know anything...

1654
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,720
What if that's the next symptom that happens?

1655
01:11:59,280 --> 01:11:59,760
Zombification.

1656
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,980
I have a gun.

1657
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,520
What if he eats me in my sleeve?

1658
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,820
You gotta trust people more?

1659
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:14,800
There...

1660
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,100
Hmm...

1661
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,600
What if one of the...

1662
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,100
One of the cool zombies that runs really fast?

1663
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,520
And I can't even shoot him in time.

1664
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:34,740
Hmm...

1665
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,540
Kinda sus.

1666
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:48,870
I don't mind still killing people, but... What if it's a friendly zombie?

1667
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:52,290
That's like so rare.

1668
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:56,370
I don't want a stinky body.

1669
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:58,310
Where are we gonna put the body?

1670
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:02,250
I don't want a stinky body in my home.

1671
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:04,870
It's decomposing, you guys.

1672
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,910
We're gonna get maggots and worms.

1673
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,470
and flies and everything.

1674
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,070
In the closet?

1675
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:13,390
Next to our food?

1676
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,820
Where'd you put the last two?

1677
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,960
I made them into jerky.

1678
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,260
Chicken jerky.

1679
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,660
Made of human.

1680
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,220
Why do you guys want me to let them in?

1681
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,700
already two corpses.

1682
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,740
No, they're gone.

1683
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,000
This nice person needs a place to stay.

1684
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,980
Well, as long as she leaves in the morning.

1685
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,340
Well, I guess in the morning evening.

1686
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:52,940
Okay, come on in.

1687
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,500
I don't think I'll stay long.

1688
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,980
I just need a break.

1689
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Oh, Muggas?

1690
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,020
Who's?

1691
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,060
You see what's going on?

1692
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,340
Freaking heck.

1693
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,300
How's it going down here?

1694
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,320
Uh, what's going on?

1695
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,040
New opportunities?

1696
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,800
Can't ya freaking see?

1697
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,980
Everybody's whining, running around, fussing...

1698
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,980
Well, you can't just do things from the heart.

1699
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,560
That's all.

1700
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,960
We should be happy, and sure.

1701
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,040
Is that perfect teeth or no?

1702
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,740
I can't tell.

1703
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:36,620
Omogus.

1704
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,260
What are you offering?

1705
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,220
Why did you come to me?

1706
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,980
Oh, he is missing a tooth, yeah.

1707
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,100
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1708
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,020
What are you offering?

1709
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,420
Survive.

1710
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,720
What else is there?

1711
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,700
ViviCore, thanks for the gifted.

1712
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,620
Kister, welcome to membership, thank you.

1713
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,840
And Elpen's welcome back, thank you.

1714
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,160
We gotta make plans while we can.

1715
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,940
To hell with the sun.

1716
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,540
Keep moving, you know?

1717
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,840
Let's go, shall we?

1718
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,980
Um... I guess he seems fine too.

1719
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,560
Funny Among Us shirt.

1720
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,680
I've literally let everyone in at this point then.

1721
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,320
I can't turn them away!

1722
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,240
I can't... I have to let everybody in!

1723
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,520
I can't...

1724
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:29,520
I am not letting everybody in!

1725
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:40,060
He's... when... when... when... when... when... when the shirt is... gosh...

1726
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,580
Everybody but the box art guy.

1727
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,440
Wait, who was that?

1728
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,360
Oh, he wouldn't let me.

1729
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,300
Wait, the box art.

1730
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,500
Like, the thumbnail?

1731
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,640
He's sus.

1732
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,400
What if it's a warning?

1733
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,760
What if he's actually sus?

1734
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,080
The shirt is bait?

1735
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,760
What if the Among Us is a red herring?

1736
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,040
What if it's a red herring?

1737
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,540
What if it's... What if it's a hint?

1738
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,400
I don't know.

1739
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:12,620
Alright.

1740
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:13,960
Oh, oh, oh.

1741
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,140
Now we're talking.

1742
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,140
Finally.

1743
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,300
Someone with some sense.

1744
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,360
Bitch!

1745
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,820
What the hell?

1746
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,560
You guys, I don't want him in here!

1747
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,180
He's rude!

1748
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,690
He's rude!

1749
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:40,090
I dislike his fouling.

1750
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:40,670
Me too!

1751
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:41,630
He has teeth.

1752
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,290
He curses too much.

1753
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,110
Doctor...

1754
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,870
It's so quiet at night.

1755
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:51,270
Hi.

1756
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:52,610
Can I come in?

1757
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,560
Have you been watching the house?

1758
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,660
Are you looking for something?

1759
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,380
Why would you think that?

1760
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,720
No.

1761
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,500
I'm actually looking for something.

1762
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,080
But the same thing everyone else is.

1763
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,260
Safety.

1764
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,980
And a way to...

1765
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,660
Kill.

1766
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:15,460
Boredom.

1767
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:16,020
Tch.

1768
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:16,860
Hahahaha.

1769
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,080
And you guys are so quiet at night.

1770
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,380
I honestly didn't think anyone slept here.

1771
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,280
So I thought I'd check if...

1772
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,400
It's okay to come in.

1773
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,480
But it was locked.

1774
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:27,820
What?

1775
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,300
You...

1776
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:32,040
You just tried to let yourself in?!

1777
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,480
I was about to knock before I tried breaking the door down.

1778
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,660
I mean you did knock.

1779
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,800
That's how I knew you were here.

1780
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:41,780
Um...

1781
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,620
Who are you?

1782
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:49,910
I'm a traveling doctor now.

1783
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:51,490
Hospitals are chaotic.

1784
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,890
I highly advise against going there.

1785
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,130
This guy looks like he has no teeth.

1786
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:57,230
So I don't think he's...

1787
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,610
I've operated on people.

1788
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,030
I'm a surgeon.

1789
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,830
There wasn't enough funding at our hospital.

1790
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:07,150
So I've done a lot of other jobs that aren't typically mine.

1791
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,230
Now I just go around helping whoever I can.

1792
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,210
Okay.

1793
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,630
Oh, he's a nice old man.

1794
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,330
I hope I can help someone.

1795
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,270
Even though he tried to break into my home.

1796
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,110
I think he's fine.

1797
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,710
Oh, wow that was fast.

1798
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,370
No, I definitely heard a knock.

1799
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:31,490
Oh, no one else will come tonight.

1800
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,470
Oh, that was creepy.

1801
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:33,730
Wait, are we sure?

1802
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:39,750
G-g-g-g-ghost?

1803
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,230
I might die in the middle of the night.

1804
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,370
Is this guy still hungry?

1805
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:44,770
No?

1806
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,220
But we're safe.

1807
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,360
We have the whole...

1808
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,880
We have the whole crew outside.

1809
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,180
I think we're fine.

1810
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:00,600
The window?

1811
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,680
Yeah, we can check the window.

1812
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,400
You guys heard that though too, right?

1813
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,520
A knock at the window.

1814
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,860
Oh gosh, sorry.

1815
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:07,680
That scared me.

1816
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,120
Uh...

1817
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,500
Yeah, how are you doing?

1818
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:17,980
No?

1819
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:20,600
Hmm...

1820
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,120
Okay, I'm asleep.

1821
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,780
Someone's ding-dong ditching.

1822
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,060
Good morning, Minto.

1823
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,680
This is the morning news.

1824
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,880
The valiant FEMA staff members have organized quarantine zones.

1825
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,920
Anyone showing signs of visitors is directed there.

1826
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,260
Some people express concern that the identity of visitors remains unknown.

1827
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,920
Sounds like they're zombies, no?

1828
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,960
If they're coming from the ground.

1829
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,500
However, FEMA assures that they are merely ill individuals in need of assistance.

1830
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,220
Additionally, FEMA has identified a new indicator of visitors.

1831
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,300
Intensely irritated blood red eyes.

1832
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,520
Lizard people.

1833
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,060
Mole people.

1834
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,380
They seem more like body snatchers.

1835
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:03,760
Yeah!

1836
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,440
I think so.

1837
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,740
This information was discovered through experiments with detained guests.

1838
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:16,460
According to FEMA experts, the irritation is caused by exposure to bright sunlight.

1839
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:17,960
So anybody outside?

1840
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:19,960
Mint people.

1841
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,320
Crab people.

1842
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,100
Please stay alert and calm and avoid leaving your home during daylight hours.

1843
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,920
We'll move on to other news.

1844
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,060
Alright.

1845
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,240
Good morning!

1846
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,020
Oh!

1847
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,700
You guys saw that, right?

1848
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,830
You guys saw that, right?

1849
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,580
I was kind of blocking it.

1850
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,320
I'm so sorry.

1851
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,580
But there was definitely someone in that chair.

1852
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:16,440
It was there for a second.

1853
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,740
A literal second.

1854
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,270
Might be in a different room now.

1855
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,350
Huh?

1856
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:33,510
Who are you?

1857
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,860
The doctor is in the closet?

1858
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,280
Oh, it's Among Us guy.

1859
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:44,940
Ah!

1860
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:46,980
Uh-oh.

1861
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:49,900
I told you, this looks so wrong.

1862
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,740
You are.

1863
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:58,220
I was so sorry.

1864
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,880
I SådO aoster.

1865
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:02,800
You are.

1866
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,020
Guys!

1867
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:05,000
There's something wrong in there.

1868
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,100
Um...

1869
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,860
My sister's share her birthday.

1870
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:15,060
She's five years older than me, so did I steal her birthday or am I just fashionably belayed twin?

1871
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,660
Probably your parents have really great timing.

1872
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,740
Thank you for the super chat!

1873
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:32,430
Oh gosh, I think this guy is fine, so I don't think we need to check him anymore.

1874
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,430
But we have this guy here.

1875
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:38,430
What's up, B?

1876
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:39,270
This guy!

1877
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:40,750
I don't know you like that!

1878
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,010
Somebody is fighting demons in the bathroom.

1879
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:46,630
Um...

1880
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,590
I need to check on you.

1881
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,090
What do you want to check?

1882
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,770
Show me your eyes!

1883
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,790
My eyes have been itchy these days.

1884
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,630
Do you think it's from the sun or what?

1885
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:03,310
Freak!

1886
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:04,290
Oh!

1887
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:06,750
It's just some kind of disease!

1888
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:10,290
Disease?

1889
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:11,490
What do you mean disease?

1890
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,040
Hold on, hold on.

1891
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,240
I want to check his nails too.

1892
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,820
Listen, I just came up with a scheme.

1893
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,700
Let's take money from others so we don't have to shoot them in the face.

1894
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,060
Oh.

1895
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:27,540
Imagine...

1896
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,920
How much we'll make!

1897
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:29,740
Bitch!

1898
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,040
Stop calling me that!

1899
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:38,190
Oh, his nails are fine.

1900
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,320
I...

1901
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:43,480
I...

1902
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,920
You know, I get dry eye.

1903
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,400
I don't feel like you can just say that their eye is being irritated or...

1904
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,520
You know...

1905
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,110
Well, you don't think so?

1906
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,130
I wash.

1907
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:59,350
I just didn't have time to rinse my hands today.

1908
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,210
Usually my nails are clean.

1909
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:02,610
Bitch.

1910
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,510
I hate this guy!

1911
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,370
Hahaha!

1912
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,550
Hold on.

1913
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,370
We have other people we need to check, you guys.

1914
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,990
I need to check on you.

1915
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:17,970
What do you want to check?

1916
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,510
Give me your...

1917
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:23,610
If he is a doctor, he would have clean hands.

1918
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,330
Guess I've operated on so many people with his hands.

1919
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:30,430
I could tell you so many stories, but maybe another time.

1920
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:31,670
Now please look.

1921
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:32,870
Oh!

1922
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:34,750
Yeah, that's grandpa's hands.

1923
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:40,030
I try to keep these arms toned so I don't slack off.

1924
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,270
Okay, who knows what tomorrow might bring.

1925
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:47,990
Love the blood on his shirt.

1926
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,910
He's a surgeon!

1927
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,260
Let's check his teeth.

1928
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,740
Because he hasn't smiled.

1929
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,320
Thank you, my teeth are fine.

1930
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,800
Ah, it's the visitor signs you're asking about.

1931
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,980
Sure, look.

1932
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,120
But he's a doctor!

1933
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,790
He has the money!

1934
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:14,450
Perfect, eh?

1935
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:16,930
I had a friend of mine put them on for free.

1936
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,270
And I operated on him a while ago.

1937
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:21,890
I wonder how he is now.

1938
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,290
We just get the gun out.

1939
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:26,710
Um...

1940
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,050
I think he's fine.

1941
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:32,760
He's fine.

1942
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,580
I think he's fine.

1943
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,780
He's fine.

1944
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,120
He's fine.

1945
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:35,500
He's a doctor.

1946
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,940
If you want, we can fix your teeth too.

1947
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,880
Thank you so much for the braid!

1948
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,440
For cheap, of course, and to help me out.

1949
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,000
Once all this sun madness is over, that is.

1950
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:48,660
Yeah.

1951
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,680
Okay, so we have a monster in our bathroom.

1952
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:54,040
Wait...

1953
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,800
Oh my god, it's so loud!

1954
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,200
Hello!

1955
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,220
Which one of you?

1956
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,260
Which one of you is it?

1957
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:12,880
I can only check three more things, so...

1958
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,020
I'm listening to you.

1959
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:17,480
Uh...

1960
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,480
Let's check his eyes.

1961
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,180
Look into my dark eyes.

1962
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,040
I absorb all the blessings of light with them, transforming energy from them.

1963
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,880
I get all my strength from my eyes.

1964
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,220
Oh.

1965
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,600
Oh boy.

1966
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:35,900
Oh no!

1967
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:37,840
Oh no!

1968
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,640
I think he needs to go to a doctor!

1969
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,760
We have a doctor!

1970
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,620
Yeah, he's fine, he just has liver damage.

1971
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:53,620
Do you see the true power of the sun in my eyes?

1972
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,820
If not, you're just blind.

1973
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,700
Try looking at the sun for a longer time as I do.

1974
01:26:59,320 --> 01:26:59,400
Oh!

1975
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,110
Where'd your zombie friend go?

1976
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:09,110
I need to get some rest.

1977
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,010
What do you want to check?

1978
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:13,510
Do I go?

1979
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,550
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

1980
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:15,210
Thank you!

1981
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:21,490
We can only check two things.

1982
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,210
I'm gonna do...

1983
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:27,110
I feel like since she's tired, the eyes might be...

1984
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:29,630
I feel like hands and teeth would be better to check.

1985
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:33,530
Because I feel like someone could get red eyes if they're tired, you know?

1986
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:34,430
So let's do the teeth.

1987
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:35,110
What?

1988
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:35,550
Okay.

1989
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,050
That's not perfect.

1990
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:39,170
She's got a gap.

1991
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:42,070
That's it?

1992
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,230
Can I have some quiet time here alone?

1993
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:47,450
Okay.

1994
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,310
Then who's growling in here?

1995
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:53,690
What?

1996
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:54,310
What?

1997
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,680
I guess it doesn't bother her.

1998
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,260
Check her again.

1999
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,060
Her hands.

2000
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,400
Hands.

2001
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,000
Wait a second.

2002
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,880
My hands are tired from carrying the one they refused to save.

2003
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,040
Oh!

2004
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,120
No, she's fine.

2005
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,040
Must I even be asked to do this freaking thing?

2006
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,100
If you want to shoot, just shoot.

2007
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,980
I don't have the strength anymore.

2008
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,260
This poor...

2009
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,080
This prison's going through it.

2010
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,640
I'm sorry.

2011
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,580
No, I'm sorry.

2012
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:33,700
I'm just really exhausted.

2013
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,100
You know, we have like another room that has a couch that you could lay on.

2014
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,260
You know?

2015
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,020
Are we sure he's dead?

2016
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:43,940
I don't know.

2017
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:46,000
What is she soaking him in?

2018
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,640
Other people need to shower and you got your dead body in there.

2019
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:53,000
What is that?

2020
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:55,060
Like, did you break formaldehyde too?

2021
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,100
I don't understand.

2022
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:59,920
Human soup.

2023
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,660
Just like the mummy.

2024
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,280
Oh my gosh.

2025
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,900
You guys remember when they found that mummy?

2026
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,400
And he was just a bunch of soup and everyone was just like, We're gonna eat the soup.

2027
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,660
Was that pre-COVID?

2028
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,060
That was a long time ago.

2029
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,740
It was...

2030
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:30,910
The coffin juice.

2031
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2032
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:34,250
First time I'm hearing that...

2033
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:34,650
Oh my gosh!

2034
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,510
It was like a meme.

2035
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:35,970
Hold on.

2036
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,030
I'm gonna look it up.

2037
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,870
If I look up coffin juice, I wonder.

2038
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:51,170
Oh yeah, people want to drink the skeleton soup.

2039
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:57,010
It was like a dark red liquid inside of a sarcophagus.

2040
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,210
People were like...

2041
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:00,670
I wanna...

2042
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,650
I wanna slurp that up.

2043
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,450
Where was this from?

2044
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,530
Mysterious sarcophagus opened.

2045
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,450
Maybe we shouldn't have opened that.

2046
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:21,290
Egyptian archaeologists have unsealed and opened a mysterious granite sarcophagus discovered on a construction site in Alexandria.

2047
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:26,290
Only to find the remains of three mummies in a pool of leaked...

2048
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,010
Oh, it says sewage water.

2049
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:30,650
No, I don't believe that.

2050
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:31,510
That's not fun.

2051
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,290
It's the mummy juice.

2052
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:41,050
January 2019 is the article I found.

2053
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:41,690
Mine...

2054
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:42,910
I saw one that said 2018.

2055
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:45,990
Uh...

2056
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:47,950
This one is from July 2018.

2057
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:52,470
I don't know, guys!

2058
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:54,830
I don't know!

2059
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,690
I hope nobody gets eaten!

2060
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,850
I hope everything's fine!

2061
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:15,470
Gamer Girl bath water.

2062
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:16,150
Oh, yeah!

2063
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:23,910
The neighbor's house which was recently painted white burned to the ground!

2064
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:26,530
And is now completely black.

2065
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:29,070
They burned their house down!

2066
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:32,490
The fire seems to have died down recently.

2067
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:34,470
Did someone set it on fire on purpose?

2068
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,170
What happened to the neighbor's family?

2069
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,330
Did anyone survive?

2070
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:39,110
Why did they burn the house down?

2071
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:40,850
Your head is filled with anxious thoughts.

2072
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:43,310
And a feeling of incomprehension and helplessness!

2073
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:48,550
What was that?

2074
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:50,070
I just heard something.

2075
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:59,890
A pale, creepy man stands on the road and smiles.

2076
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:02,610
I trust Long Guy and Jack Black.

2077
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:04,550
I'll be sad if they let us down.

2078
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:05,770
Yeah, I trust those two also.

2079
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,070
So...

2080
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,570
British archaeology...

2081
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:08,310
Archaeologist?

2082
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:09,890
Wait...

2083
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,590
Can eat mummy jerky but I can't sip mummy juice.

2084
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:13,310
What a cruel world.

2085
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,310
I know, right?

2086
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:15,870
Oh...

2087
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:17,950
He has someone's severed head in his hand.

2088
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,570
Wearing a helmet?

2089
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:20,730
Oh no!

2090
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:24,250
I saw a white house and they wanted it painted black.

2091
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:25,350
No colors anymore?

2092
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,010
Yeah!

2093
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,070
They just...

2094
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,650
You know...

2095
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,570
What if...

2096
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:32,590
What if a lightning came from the sun?

2097
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:33,610
Could've been.

2098
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:39,190
It's a soldier's head with a grimace of horror frozen on his face.

2099
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:41,510
You're very uncomfortable with what you see.

2100
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,550
Yeah, because this guy's obsessed with me and once in my home.

2101
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:46,610
Shirtless freak.

2102
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:54,750
The entire squad of soldiers who are here were here...

2103
01:32:56,650 --> 01:33:00,650
The entire squad of soldiers who were here yesterday are dead.

2104
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,470
Average Mito viewer?

2105
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,990
No!

2106
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:09,850
The bodies are strewn all over the street, and one of the bodies is missing a head!

2107
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,490
No head?

2108
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,530
Did that pale, creepy stranger kill them all?

2109
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:20,390
You are horrified by this picture of carnage, and you feel in danger.

2110
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:22,290
I'm in danger!

2111
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:25,370
All right, who's here?

2112
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:26,670
Oh!

2113
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:28,110
I'm from the FEMA crew!

2114
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,530
We're here to help you!

2115
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:30,330
Oh!

2116
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,610
You came alone?

2117
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,310
How can I trust you?

2118
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:36,590
You must have seen the news.

2119
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,110
We were there.

2120
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:40,470
I can also show you my ID.

2121
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:44,630
Why are you wearing a hazmat suit?

2122
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:46,270
Are we getting one of those?

2123
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,810
How will you help us?

2124
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:49,430
Yeah, how will you help us?

2125
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,550
First, we have to do some investigation.

2126
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:57,750
Based on the results, I will be able to take further action by notifying the management.

2127
01:33:58,650 --> 01:33:59,990
You will need to wait a little.

2128
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,390
Uh, do you have an action plan?

2129
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:07,610
Of course!

2130
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:09,610
It's not like we can act spontaneously.

2131
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:13,110
We'll take any one person with us for examining...

2132
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:17,790
Since you may have been exposed to solar radiation, we'll check the health of one.

2133
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:19,390
Wait, we can get rid of the girl!

2134
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:21,310
She...

2135
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:24,890
She'll be so happy to be able to lay on a...

2136
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:27,550
On a table and get experimented on.

2137
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:31,450
Based on that, we'll decide if you all need help.

2138
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:32,870
It can be anyone.

2139
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:36,070
Do I have to pack two?

2140
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:37,850
What's next?

2141
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:40,070
What's next?

2142
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:40,810
Wait.

2143
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:47,110
Either we will evaluate you from the dangerous area, or we will bring the man back to...

2144
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,110
No, don't bring the bag!

2145
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,910
The rude guy!

2146
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,730
We will issue instructions either way.

2147
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:56,950
Oh!

2148
01:34:57,690 --> 01:34:58,290
No!

2149
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:00,570
I didn't get the juice!

2150
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:06,310
Now I'm taking the man from you!

2151
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:06,730
No!

2152
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,550
Jack Black!

2153
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:16,190
We'll go...

2154
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:16,450
No!

2155
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,570
Goodbye!

2156
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:20,690
I'm never seeing him again at our...

2157
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:26,730
No!

2158
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:34,090
What a mess.

2159
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:35,030
Did you see that?

2160
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,410
This guy is bugging.

2161
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:40,010
Door growling is apparently a sound bug, and meant to be whispering.

2162
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:42,330
Oh!

2163
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:44,910
So if there's like two people in there...

2164
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:47,930
Oh!

2165
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,450
Jack Black, honorable sacrifice.

2166
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:52,570
He will be remembered.

2167
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:55,970
Oh, so it's like if there's two people in a room...

2168
01:35:55,970 --> 01:35:56,190
Boom!

2169
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,790
Did I kill that lady for no reason?

2170
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:00,030
Oopsie.

2171
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,170
What kind of society is this?

2172
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:07,490
The...

2173
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:08,990
I definitely read...

2174
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:09,890
Not beasts.

2175
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:13,190
The beasts around here are revealed.

2176
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:14,090
Oh!

2177
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:15,970
He took off his...

2178
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,410
He took off his...

2179
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:18,350
His high heels!

2180
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:24,990
Finally, nobody's pretending.

2181
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:27,930
He's like, I can finally reveal my real height.

2182
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:29,230
Six foot two.

2183
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:32,410
Are you one of the beasts?

2184
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:35,890
The music...

2185
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:36,290
What do you mean?

2186
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:36,850
Oh!

2187
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:37,730
Hey, Gru again.

2188
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:39,630
Haven't you been to the other houses?

2189
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:40,970
Outside on the street?

2190
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:44,870
All those social norms and other crap don't work anymore.

2191
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:48,510
Might makes right now.

2192
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:52,330
And if you can outfight others, you've won an established order.

2193
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:58,650
How many houses have you switched?

2194
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,810
How have you survived all this time?

2195
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,790
How many houses have you switched?

2196
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,070
I haven't been anywhere for a long time.

2197
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:12,190
But everywhere I see chaos.

2198
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:15,330
Fear blinds people to so many things.

2199
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,910
You still have some order.

2200
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:20,330
That's interesting.

2201
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,350
I'd like to see you keep it.

2202
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:24,450
This guy is definitely the cause of the chaos.

2203
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:28,490
Um...

2204
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,090
Uh...

2205
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:31,550
Uh...

2206
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,990
He looks like a businessman.

2207
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,110
This guy is so sus.

2208
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:41,190
Let him in.

2209
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:42,810
This guy is pretty sus.

2210
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,610
He's our muscle.

2211
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:48,330
Come on in.

2212
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:51,210
An intelligent decision.

2213
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:58,010
The force now rules your life and you either accept it or get in trouble.

2214
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:02,150
The heck does that mean?

2215
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:04,250
Oh!

2216
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:05,930
Let me in!

2217
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,010
Are you hysterical?

2218
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:10,490
Somebody don't say that to her.

2219
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:13,790
Establish order by taking on and off at your heels.

2220
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:16,630
Something happened?

2221
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:17,750
Uh...

2222
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:18,140
Uh...

2223
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:18,920
Uh...

2224
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:19,480
Uh...

2225
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:19,910
Uh...

2226
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:20,310
Uh...

2227
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:20,850
Uh...

2228
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:21,150
Uh...

2229
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:21,770
My daddy...

2230
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:23,050
Uh...

2231
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:23,440
Uh...

2232
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:24,600
Uh...

2233
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:25,070
Uh...

2234
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:25,170
Uh...

2235
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:25,430
Uh...

2236
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:26,810
Killed my dad.

2237
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:27,850
You did?

2238
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,080
You killed your dad?

2239
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:35,660
Who killed your dad?

2240
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,720
Who did this?

2241
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,540
We had visitors.

2242
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,020
They sat in our room.

2243
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,320
Daddy was...

2244
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,160
Talking to them about something.

2245
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,740
And then they killed him.

2246
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,140
Uh...

2247
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,940
Our house is...

2248
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,300
Now on...

2249
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,440
Fire.

2250
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:17,680
How did she survive?

2251
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,600
That's what I'm thinking.

2252
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:20,780
How did she get out?

2253
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,320
She doesn't look burnt at all.

2254
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,420
She's just a baby.

2255
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,340
You can check her later.

2256
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:35,760
Okay.

2257
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,700
Can you help me?

2258
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,060
I'm scared.

2259
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,480
I'm not from around here.

2260
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,120
I don't like staying in one place too long.

2261
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:56,180
Can't roam around as much anymore.

2262
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,900
I'm getting too old for that.

2263
01:39:59,020 --> 01:39:59,580
Uh...

2264
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,440
What are you looking for here?

2265
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,700
In town?

2266
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,780
I just want to rest.

2267
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:07,240
After this damn sun, the visitors start popping up more.

2268
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,040
Crawling everywhere.

2269
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:09,560
What do you mean after the sun?

2270
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,640
Were the visitors around before the sun?

2271
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,100
Evil Jack Black.

2272
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:20,180
Not everybody with a beard can be Jack Black, you guys.

2273
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:26,420
Not everybody that comes to the door with a beard is Jack Black.

2274
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,940
We did lose...

2275
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:36,940
What if he's just like, I'm looking for my brother.

2276
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,940
He looks exactly like me.

2277
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,020
I'm telling you, we need to snuff them out.

2278
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,800
They're trying to pull something on us.

2279
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:48,100
Uh...

2280
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,440
Do you want to kill the visitors?

2281
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,160
Aren't you doing the same thing?

2282
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:53,500
Ooh!

2283
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:58,950
Or do you just tell them to shoot?

2284
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,710
You're not stupid, right?

2285
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:05,650
You kick them out, but tomorrow they'll tear you apart and won't even remember your name.

2286
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:06,250
Get it?

2287
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,350
You gotta be careful with them.

2288
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:09,010
That's the thing.

2289
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:10,850
I'm gonna have too many people in my home.

2290
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:12,990
Eh, come on in.

2291
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:16,090
I knew you weren't a pus- pushover.

2292
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:17,450
A real man.

2293
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:20,270
We'll mix it up with these visitors.

2294
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,510
They won't come near us by a mile.

2295
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,210
Oh my gosh.

2296
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:28,690
Whoa!

2297
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:29,890
Anybody?

2298
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:30,270
How?

2299
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:32,110
Uh...

2300
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:32,750
Looking for someone?

2301
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,970
I'm not looking for anyone.

2302
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:36,770
I just need a place to hide.

2303
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,350
The whole neighborhood has been kicked out.

2304
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:40,650
No one knows where to go.

2305
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:44,730
So this entire complex behind you, everybody's gone.

2306
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:46,270
Everybody's been kicked out?

2307
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:47,650
Why does everybody keep coming to my house?

2308
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:50,750
Yeah, she's got the flattest head I've ever seen.

2309
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:54,070
Now I'm running around in shock, looking for a place to live.

2310
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:58,190
Yeah, why did they- How many of you left?

2311
01:41:58,670 --> 01:41:59,910
How- Why did they kick you out?

2312
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:03,610
They said there was a big sunstroke or something on our house.

2313
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:06,990
Those in yellow suits kicked us out.

2314
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:09,130
Somebody was grabbed, taken for tests.

2315
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:10,890
Oh, someone released.

2316
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,840
She's not lying.

2317
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,560
Well, that sounds like what the hazmat people have done.

2318
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,080
Where's her legs?

2319
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:23,600
Oh!

2320
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:29,770
Is she a VTuber?

2321
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:34,870
Tell her to shoot.

2322
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:35,290
Why?

2323
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:36,450
What'd she do wrong?

2324
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:39,770
I don't think she did any- She didn't act any different.

2325
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:41,030
She didn't act weird.

2326
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,170
She can fly.

2327
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:50,130
She can fly.

2328
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:51,010
She can fly.

2329
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:51,870
She can fly.

2330
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:56,810
She'll take your legs.

2331
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:59,570
How much room do I have left?

2332
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:06,200
I feel like I've killed all the baddies.

2333
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:13,220
Ah, thanks.

2334
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,140
Don't open the door to those yellow ones, okay?

2335
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,800
They're gonna take us somewhere.

2336
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,200
Okay.

2337
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:20,180
Okay.

2338
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:21,060
Yeah, we'll be fine.

2339
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:21,680
Probably.

2340
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,580
We'll probably be fine.

2341
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:27,140
I think.

2342
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:32,040
I think the little girl's gonna kill somebody, if anybody.

2343
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,080
Hopefully not us.

2344
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:36,760
Oh.

2345
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:44,350
Good morning, dear viewers.

2346
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:46,190
This is the- Uh-oh.

2347
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:46,950
Uh-oh.

2348
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:48,690
This is the morning news.

2349
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:52,690
FEMA conti- If you didn't see what that said, it said someone was killed.

2350
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:57,010
FEMA continues to identify new signs of visitors.

2351
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:03,730
According to their data, attempts to photograph visitors result in severe blurring- Oh, that's a easy- Okay, severe blurring.

2352
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:05,530
Oh my gosh, it's just like the ring.

2353
01:44:07,110 --> 01:44:08,510
Are these the devs?

2354
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:11,890
This effect can only be observed with film cameras.

2355
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:16,670
Unfortunately, the reasons for this phenomenon has not been determined yet.

2356
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:21,570
However, FEMA urges citizens to use this new information to identify visitors.

2357
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:25,710
Please stay alert and calm and avoid leaving your home during daylight hours.

2358
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:29,530
Who died?

2359
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:34,650
What's that?

2360
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:54,250
Did he eat the- Did you eat the tall man?

2361
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:56,750
Oh my god!

2362
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:58,090
Do you have a question for me?

2363
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:02,050
I need to check on you.

2364
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:04,050
What do you want to check?

2365
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:07,310
I don't like having my picture taken.

2366
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:10,910
If those pictures don't end up in the trash later, I'll have to take action.

2367
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:12,290
Do you understand that?

2368
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:14,770
You're taking a picture of the person you're talking to.

2369
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:17,850
You have- You wave the photo around to make it show up faster.

2370
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:21,590
You notice that the picture seems fine, but it's being snatched out of your hands.

2371
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:22,470
Give it to me.

2372
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,470
I'll throw them out myself.

2373
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,360
Let me check your...

2374
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:35,340
Teeth.

2375
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,420
If you attack me, I'll bite your neck with these teeth.

2376
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,200
They're not perfect, though.

2377
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,240
I take care of my teeth.

2378
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,720
And those that are missing- Oh!

2379
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:49,580
They are perfect?

2380
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:49,660
They are perfect?

2381
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:51,760
Oh.

2382
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:58,450
Let those- Those masters clench them tighter in the grave.

2383
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:03,310
He's- He's a visitor.

2384
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:09,890
I've been out of one of these before.

2385
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:12,010
Let's see who's faster?

2386
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:17,190
Wait, what are you- Where did he go?

2387
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:38,100
I'm so confused!

2388
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,060
I'm so confused!

2389
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,980
Oh, she's purple.

2390
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,460
I want my mama!

2391
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:48,840
I need to check you, though.

2392
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,400
Let me take your picture, little girl.

2393
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,200
Photo?

2394
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,400
I'm not really into pho- Photo?

2395
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:55,560
Photography?

2396
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:56,700
Photography?

2397
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,500
Will you show me a photo later?

2398
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,900
We take a picture that came out blurry.

2399
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,400
The girl ran up to you without waiting for the end of the photo shoot.

2400
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:05,940
Thank you.

2401
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:06,960
I didn't like it.

2402
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,080
Don't ask me to take any more pictures.

2403
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:16,010
We have so many- I forgot this guy was here in my home.

2404
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,100
Yeah, why would she run- Oh, I didn't mean that.

2405
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,240
Hold on.

2406
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:39,050
Why would she run unless she knew that taking a photo was, like, you know, gonna make her blurry?

2407
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:39,750
You know what I mean?

2408
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:43,370
Yeah, let's check her hands.

2409
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:45,850
And I already know how to cut my own nails already.

2410
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:47,170
I'm not very good at it yet.

2411
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:48,690
I- Look.

2412
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:50,470
Oh, they're clean.

2413
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:56,810
Look at those nails.

2414
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:57,590
I cut them myself.

2415
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:58,070
I did it.

2416
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,650
But I did it.

2417
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,130
I'm going to go sit alone.

2418
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:07,870
She's a child.

2419
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:10,070
You guys will not survive the zombie apocalypse.

2420
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:13,830
Anybody who's just like, Mint, she's just a kid.

2421
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,550
You guys will not survive the zombie apocalypse.

2422
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:17,490
Okay?

2423
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:23,410
She's just a kid, Minto.

2424
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:25,130
Um, yeah.

2425
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:26,790
Did you ever see that movie Orphan?

2426
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:32,470
What if, where, it was actually a grown lady, and it's based on a true story?

2427
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,480
Yeah!

2428
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:40,460
Whoa!

2429
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,120
Capable!

2430
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,180
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

2431
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,480
First super chat from a perpetual lurker.

2432
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,060
Sorry, the music stops because I have to tab out, or else I can't read it because it goes too fast.

2433
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:54,780
If I want to get into Metal Gear, do I have to play the first two, or can I start at Metal Gear Solid?

2434
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,800
No, you didn't start at Metal Gear Solid.

2435
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,460
Thank you so much for the Alcozoo, but thank you!

2436
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,180
Keep your eyes open.

2437
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,060
The visitor could be any one of us.

2438
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:12,800
Let me check on you.

2439
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,760
I don't really like taking pictures.

2440
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,740
The flash reminds me of a thunderstorm.

2441
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,620
Makes me panic.

2442
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:20,700
Wait.

2443
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,280
No, you didn't get it.

2444
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,320
I'm not taking pictures.

2445
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:23,600
Wait.

2446
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:27,280
Wait, what?

2447
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:29,260
Because he refused the photo?

2448
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:29,880
No, we're...

2449
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,400
We're...

2450
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:32,340
We're gonna shoot him?

2451
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,020
Blast him?

2452
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:49,200
Famous Mito Bramito Heights children.

2453
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,120
Um...

2454
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:53,880
Ah...

2455
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,360
Hear him out.

2456
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,020
Thanks for understanding.

2457
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,840
You know, I don't like that stuff.

2458
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,060
The pictures, the sudden flashes, the sounds.

2459
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,340
I'm not interested.

2460
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:05,500
I...

2461
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:09,480
Okay, see, that sounds like whispering.

2462
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,760
The guy sitting at the table is green.

2463
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,920
Those are symptoms of steamed broccoli!

2464
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:19,380
Hello, Doc.

2465
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,320
Jack Black.

2466
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,020
Is it this...

2467
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:30,240
Wait.

2468
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:31,420
Okay, I have a question.

2469
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:32,260
If anybody knows.

2470
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:35,340
Is the person that...

2471
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,360
gets killed in a room...

2472
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,920
Is it the person that's in the room...

2473
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:41,840
that does the killing...

2474
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:42,700
or does it not matter?

2475
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:44,680
Check the lady.

2476
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,800
Yeah, that's what I was about to do.

2477
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:51,620
Oh, son.

2478
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:52,880
Please don't let anyone in.

2479
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,860
I need to check on you.

2480
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:55,900
What do you want to check?

2481
01:50:57,020 --> 01:50:58,140
I want to take your photo.

2482
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,520
It's been a long time since I was last photographed.

2483
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:01,520
It doesn't matter.

2484
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:01,780
Okay.

2485
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:02,300
Go ahead.

2486
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:02,700
Why not?

2487
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:03,700
Taking a picture.

2488
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,220
I'm going to purposely hold still...

2489
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:05,940
and wait for the moment.

2490
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:07,700
It's blurry.

2491
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,380
completely.

2492
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,480
Why can't you see me well?

2493
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,380
Try it.

2494
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,840
They'll smear you too.

2495
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:22,990
Sayonara!

2496
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:24,750
You ate tall, man!

2497
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,970
You ate tall, man!

2498
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:39,030
Yeah, we really blasted her, huh?

2499
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:40,430
Sayonara!

2500
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:43,390
Yeah, we really...

2501
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:44,410
We really got her good.

2502
01:51:46,230 --> 01:51:47,910
She was so normal, yeah.

2503
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:51,050
There's just...

2504
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:52,010
There's nobody in here.

2505
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,270
My room is haunted.

2506
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,710
My room is haunted!

2507
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:57,670
I mean, I did...

2508
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:58,070
Oh my goodness.

2509
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:59,590
I did see a ghost there earlier.

2510
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,480
I think she's fine.

2511
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:09,760
I think everybody else is fine.

2512
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:13,140
This is just talking to the doctor.

2513
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:13,620
Oh.

2514
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:15,820
Hmm?

2515
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:18,080
Is the end near?

2516
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,300
I'd like to think not.

2517
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,380
Humanity has faced numerous disasters, always teetering on the edge.

2518
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,040
And each time, people have summoned the strength to keep fighting.

2519
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,140
Even when all hope seemed lost and the end appeared imminent.

2520
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:37,780
I'd like to believe that this time, too, humanity will overcome the calamity that has struck us.

2521
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:41,520
What if you are the visitor and are doing the longest con ever?

2522
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:43,560
Yeah.

2523
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:45,720
Everyone that I kill, I do turn into jerky.

2524
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:46,940
Hold on.

2525
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:47,300
You know what?

2526
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,620
I'm going to test the little girl again.

2527
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,600
We got her hands.

2528
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,180
We got her photo.

2529
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,280
We can do her eyes.

2530
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,840
You will see everything I'm thinking there?

2531
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,080
I'll be careful what I think then.

2532
01:52:59,240 --> 01:52:59,720
Don't worry.

2533
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:00,600
Oh.

2534
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:01,680
Her eyes are fine.

2535
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:04,560
Why did you look like that?

2536
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:05,860
You saw...

2537
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:05,980
Ooh.

2538
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:06,700
Ooh.

2539
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:06,880
There.

2540
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:07,560
You.

2541
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:08,180
Wah.

2542
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,700
I want a drink.

2543
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:11,260
Oh, no.

2544
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,240
She's an alcoholic.

2545
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:14,780
No!

2546
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:19,760
Check Jack Black.

2547
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:20,100
Oh, yeah.

2548
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:20,800
Let's check him, too.

2549
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:22,340
I need to check you.

2550
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,420
Let's check.

2551
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,340
He didn't want the photo.

2552
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:29,300
Let's check his eyes.

2553
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,820
I took a screenshot of you and showed up completely blurry.

2554
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,740
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

2555
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:37,640
Oh, Jess.

2556
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,680
That's obvious.

2557
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,040
It's because I'm a ghost.

2558
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,260
Spirit photography.

2559
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:42,200
No!

2560
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,160
It's not because I'm a visitor.

2561
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:46,660
It's because I'm an actual ghost.

2562
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,980
Hands or teeth?

2563
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:53,560
I guess we can check his hands.

2564
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:56,300
Let's do it.

2565
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:58,180
Is that dirty?

2566
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:00,720
Of course my hands will be dirty.

2567
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:03,680
I go out at night and dig up these devils.

2568
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,600
It's even easier to kill them.

2569
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:07,380
Wait, what?

2570
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,580
How do you know where to dig?

2571
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:11,880
Oh.

2572
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:19,780
Oh.

2573
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:22,660
How do you know?

2574
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,700
He smells them.

2575
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:27,040
That sounds really size.

2576
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:30,060
If you're going to throw me out, put me close to these.

2577
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,280
I'm scared.

2578
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,080
This guy's still just cheesing.

2579
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,280
This guy's just cheesing.

2580
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:50,620
He's like, well...

2581
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:52,020
Anyway.

2582
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:53,220
Okay.

2583
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:55,740
Little girl's going to need therapy.

2584
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,560
I mean, that's like...

2585
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,420
That's like every...

2586
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,300
Yeah, that's...

2587
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:01,260
That's...

2588
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:02,660
Everybody is going to need therapy.

2589
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,720
You're looking at your neighbor's house.

2590
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:07,780
Only a ghostly silhouette remains.

2591
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,620
You're devastated by what you've seen.

2592
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:19,380
It seems to disturb you even more to realize that it's not the evil guests who are to blame, but the people with paranoia.

2593
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,560
It brings you anxiety.

2594
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:23,760
There's...

2595
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,920
People are going to set fire to my house, too.

2596
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,520
Oh my god.

2597
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,940
What is this Mad Max out here?

2598
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:40,540
You see a stake with a helmet and skull on it.

2599
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,880
There's some black, burnt skin left on the skull.

2600
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,680
And the teeth look like someone pulled them out.

2601
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,100
The head has been here all day.

2602
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,040
The whole grim display looks like a threat.

2603
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:54,820
Surely left by that creepy, pale visitor.

2604
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:58,160
Dead man...

2605
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:58,400
Dead man...

2606
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:02,580
I don't think we need to turn into Doomguy for...

2607
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:03,820
For the rest of this.

2608
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,500
Oh my gosh!

2609
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:10,920
There is a dead man hanging suspended from a lamppost with a sign around his neck.

2610
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:11,500
Oh!

2611
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,440
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2612
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,420
I'm so sorry.

2613
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,220
My finger slipped.

2614
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,700
I don't know what it said.

2615
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:28,520
I'm so sorry.

2616
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:33,020
Looks like the poor guy was mistaken for a guest and killed in a lynching.

2617
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:39,400
The thought of violence engulfing a once peaceful and quiet town breaks your heart.

2618
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:41,260
Makes you long for quieter times.

2619
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,380
You can look again, you can.

2620
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:44,100
I tried before, but...

2621
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,280
No, you can't.

2622
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:48,080
I'm sorry.

2623
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:49,620
It was something...

2624
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:50,400
Yeah, it said...

2625
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:50,800
Something that...

2626
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,820
Whatever his sign said.

2627
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,720
I think it says, Visitors are not welcome.

2628
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,640
Ah, I see, I see.

2629
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,640
Thank you, guys.

2630
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,040
We're with the FEMA team.

2631
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,580
We need to do a survey of your neighborhood.

2632
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:05,980
Uh...

2633
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:07,220
The man you took isn't enough?

2634
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,480
Last one.

2635
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:09,780
Oh, that.

2636
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:12,140
The examination procedure is quite exhausting.

2637
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:14,400
Right now, your man is in the rehabilitation.

2638
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,840
After he rests, we'll bring him back right away.

2639
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,300
Why was one not enough?

2640
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,240
The sample is too small.

2641
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:27,180
He was a pretty hefty man.

2642
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,020
The boss first said to take one at a time.

2643
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:32,400
But now we need to see...

2644
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,360
But now we see that we need more.

2645
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:40,280
So we went out again.

2646
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,740
I think if I say no...

2647
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,680
Oh, they're gonna...

2648
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:46,620
They're gonna force.

2649
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,040
Oh yeah, who's the boss?

2650
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,430
Alright, if there's no other way.

2651
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:03,450
Yeah, he's got a gun.

2652
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:04,250
Yeah.

2653
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:05,810
There's no other way.

2654
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:09,710
Goodbye, Amogus!

2655
01:58:12,650 --> 01:58:13,770
Goodbye, Amogus!

2656
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:15,350
You know what?

2657
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:16,010
That's fine.

2658
01:58:18,110 --> 01:58:19,630
Yeah, see you later, bitch.

2659
01:58:20,290 --> 01:58:21,670
Yeah, who's the bitch now?

2660
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:22,430
It's you!

2661
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:24,630
Calling me a bitch.

2662
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:26,430
I don't even know you like that.

2663
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:29,390
It's all for your own safety.

2664
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:30,770
Cool.

2665
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:35,010
Calling me a bitch.

2666
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:36,050
Oh!

2667
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:39,870
What do you think of that one in the suit?

2668
01:58:42,770 --> 01:58:44,030
I don't know how to feel.

2669
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:44,910
I'm not gonna...

2670
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:45,830
I'm not gonna tell you.

2671
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:47,790
I don't trust you.

2672
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:49,510
You have...

2673
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:50,490
You were nipple-less.

2674
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,520
Skinny arms, big shoulders.

2675
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,800
He's got huge shoulders.

2676
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,000
He's doing his job.

2677
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:01,600
Alright.

2678
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:04,340
These are the times, aren't they?

2679
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,060
You've got to be careful.

2680
01:59:06,580 --> 01:59:07,440
Is that okay?

2681
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:09,560
I'm kinda busy.

2682
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,480
Actually, don't come back later.

2683
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:12,080
Can you leave?

2684
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:13,200
Yeah, sure.

2685
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,760
I didn't think you had any trouble talking to me.

2686
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:17,020
Just first.

2687
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,500
Are you alone in the house right now?

2688
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,780
I have other people...

2689
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:24,120
Getting ready.

2690
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:27,280
Do you know what you're getting ready for?

2691
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,460
It's the last days.

2692
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:31,820
Didn't they tell you?

2693
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,820
Dogs rule the world.

2694
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:34,600
Ow!

2695
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:34,940
Ow!

2696
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:38,000
And only dogs will be here.

2697
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,760
Have a good day.

2698
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:40,480
Oh, stay.

2699
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:40,920
Sorry.

2700
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:43,400
Why is he so...

2701
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,140
Can I make my mouth that straight?

2702
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:11,650
It's this guy!

2703
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:14,710
But what comes next is a terrible secret.

2704
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:16,170
They're back.

2705
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:18,310
How have you survived all this time?

2706
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:21,130
That's not the problem you should be worrying about.

2707
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:21,830
But thanks.

2708
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:26,730
And I don't yet feel that the glaciers are going to melt anytime soon.

2709
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:30,290
Looks like we're in for birds raining from the sky.

2710
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:34,110
You think things will get worse?

2711
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:36,550
Is there any point in thinking?

2712
02:00:37,070 --> 02:00:39,670
I don't think we should bother our heads with it now.

2713
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:40,930
Whether...

2714
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:44,490
I don't know why I've given him like this sad Mickey Mouse voice.

2715
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:55,850
Whether you keep talking or hide people, it's all the same.

2716
02:00:57,230 --> 02:00:59,110
I have no thoughts on what to do.

2717
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,970
Well, what should we do?

2718
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:03,930
What about other people?

2719
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:06,850
Why do you need this knowledge?

2720
02:01:07,290 --> 02:01:11,510
No matter how we've looked at others, we've got nothing but caricatures.

2721
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:15,610
Oh, okay.

2722
02:01:16,490 --> 02:01:18,430
There's so many characters here.

2723
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:19,510
Caricatures.

2724
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,990
Characters.

2725
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:24,890
Mickey's changed after Kingdom Hearts.

2726
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:28,530
But I thought I heard a knock again.

2727
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:29,650
I...

2728
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:30,990
I heard that.

2729
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:45,590
I'm not hearing things.

2730
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:49,030
I'm not hearing things.

2731
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:50,850
You heard right?

2732
02:01:51,090 --> 02:01:51,550
The windows.

2733
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:54,310
It's time to open the...

2734
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:56,230
It's time to open the door to doctors.

2735
02:01:57,030 --> 02:01:57,330
Mickey.

2736
02:01:59,330 --> 02:02:00,870
I'm not hearing things.

2737
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:02,110
This is the second time.

2738
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:04,490
This guy.

2739
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:05,870
It was this guy right here.

2740
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:07,790
This guy's freaky.

2741
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:17,050
You think somebody is going to die tonight?

2742
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:18,690
Will it be me?

2743
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:20,030
I'm going to die tonight.

2744
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:20,590
No, I'm not.

2745
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:21,330
I'm going to be safe.

2746
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:22,330
Everybody is fine.

2747
02:02:24,230 --> 02:02:24,750
Oh.

2748
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:26,250
It's...

2749
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:26,390
Wait.

2750
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:28,790
It is no longer safe to live on the surface of the earth.

2751
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:32,530
You board up all the windows and barricade the doors.

2752
02:02:33,010 --> 02:02:38,590
After conferring with your tenants, you decide not to go out into the outside world anymore.

2753
02:02:39,010 --> 02:02:40,770
You pray helplessly that somebody...

2754
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:42,350
Someday, this will all be over.

2755
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:44,610
If this nightmare ever ends.

2756
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:49,510
At the very least, you have peace of mind knowing that there are only humans under your roof.

2757
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:52,730
Yippee!

2758
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:53,750
Oh, wait.

2759
02:02:53,850 --> 02:02:54,770
Then I did it.

2760
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:55,690
Right?

2761
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:59,170
So quiet.

2762
02:02:59,170 --> 02:02:59,230
So quiet.

2763
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:02,790
Yeah!

2764
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:03,970
Woohoo!

2765
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:06,570
You win.

2766
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:08,610
Nice.

2767
02:03:09,430 --> 02:03:10,030
Um.

2768
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:12,130
Cool.

2769
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:13,870
Cool!

2770
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:16,090
Uh.

2771
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:17,990
Uh.

2772
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:20,310
Cool!

2773
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:25,230
Come on.

2774
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:25,610
Wait.

2775
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:33,670
I kinda wanna let some... some bad guys into my house, though.

2776
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:39,550
What if we... what if we only kill the humans and we let all the creepy people stay?

2777
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:41,650
Should we do like a speedrun where we do that?

2778
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:47,870
We can do a really... really fast run, you know?

2779
02:03:48,070 --> 02:03:50,990
I won't listen to like any of the texts, like all this we read.

2780
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:53,690
Um... What's going on out there?

2781
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:54,870
Better not to leave the house.

2782
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:55,850
Okay.

2783
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:58,450
And no one else will come tonight.

2784
02:03:58,610 --> 02:03:58,770
Alright.

2785
02:03:59,670 --> 02:04:01,950
We're just gonna... I just wanna see what's gonna happen.

2786
02:04:03,790 --> 02:04:05,570
Do you wanna know who are the freaks?

2787
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:07,730
Oh, yeah, that would be so helpful.

2788
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:10,190
Actually... yes.

2789
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:11,810
Okay.

2790
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:16,870
Alright.

2791
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:19,430
Um... Oh, yeah, we talked to this guy in the cabinet.

2792
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:23,610
Okay.

2793
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:27,190
Freaks spotted in the bottom right.

2794
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:31,830
They have a PO box for fan mail.

2795
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:34,110
Liam, thank you for asking, but I don't.

2796
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:37,370
Oh, no.

2797
02:04:37,430 --> 02:04:38,150
I missed a restart.

2798
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:39,670
Oh, we didn't restart.

2799
02:04:39,670 --> 02:04:42,170
I finished... actually... I finished it.

2800
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:43,250
So...

2801
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:45,430
You are a freak with those pearly whites.

2802
02:04:46,410 --> 02:04:47,470
My teeth are...

2803
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,830
Wait, my teeth are not perfect.

2804
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:49,810
I have a fang.

2805
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:52,030
My teeth are not perfect.

2806
02:04:53,530 --> 02:04:55,150
Let's see your hands, me too.

2807
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:08,280
What's your dad's name?

2808
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,340
Did you forget his name?

2809
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:10,960
Oh, you're checking to see if I'm a visitor.

2810
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:12,280
You're smart.

2811
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:13,820
I'll start checking people now, too.

2812
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:17,220
Yeah, I'm just gonna skip all this.

2813
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:17,640
Goodbye.

2814
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:18,200
Okay.

2815
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,040
So this guy is safe.

2816
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,460
Should we still let him in, though?

2817
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:30,000
Do you think...

2818
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,240
What if we just let in everybody?

2819
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,180
Long boy is human.

2820
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:37,120
Yeah.

2821
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:45,390
I can't decide if I want to let...

2822
02:05:46,690 --> 02:05:48,430
Let in everyone and kill no one.

2823
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:49,510
Yeah, that's what I would have to do.

2824
02:05:49,590 --> 02:05:50,850
Or I only let in the freaks.

2825
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:57,830
I kind of want to see what happens if you only let in the freaks, you know?

2826
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:02,510
I think visitors will clear out guests and then get to you last.

2827
02:06:02,590 --> 02:06:04,190
That's what I'm thinking will happen, too.

2828
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:06,530
Let's...

2829
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:06,830
Goodbye.

2830
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:08,030
I understand.

2831
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:10,230
Aw, I understand you.

2832
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:11,290
But I'm angry.

2833
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,810
You're just as much as a coward as everyone else here.

2834
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:16,410
Sleep well at night, homeowner.

2835
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,590
And freak you.

2836
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:19,970
Dang, okay.

2837
02:06:20,450 --> 02:06:21,590
He did say he has a temper.

2838
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:25,850
So this is a visitor.

2839
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:29,430
Who are you?

2840
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,390
What are you gonna do now?

2841
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:32,930
Come on in.

2842
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,670
You freaky...

2843
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:35,370
Freak...

2844
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:36,810
Freak...

2845
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:36,850
Freak...

2846
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:37,350
Quad.

2847
02:06:37,870 --> 02:06:39,690
Lord Freak Quad over here.

2848
02:06:40,230 --> 02:06:40,990
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2849
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:42,630
Yeah.

2850
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:46,580
Okay.

2851
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:48,640
Okay.

2852
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:57,700
We know where they are, this freakazoid freak-o.

2853
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:00,880
Okay.

2854
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,720
How do you recognize a visitor?

2855
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:03,960
I wish I knew how.

2856
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:06,040
I'm so scared that a visitor could be anyone.

2857
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:09,820
The only thing I heard on the radio was that their teeth are perfect, but...

2858
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:11,500
Do regular people not have good teeth?

2859
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,040
Heh heh.

2860
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:12,580
Heh heh.

2861
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:13,760
Oh my god.

2862
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:14,840
They're such a freak!

2863
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:15,960
Why are you laughing?

2864
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,680
What do you know about the cataclysm?

2865
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:22,280
I don't even know what to say.

2866
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:24,160
I've decided to look out the window and...

2867
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,780
I wish I hadn't looked out there.

2868
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:27,900
The sun just burned some kids.

2869
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:30,240
I don't want to die from the burning sun so badly.

2870
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:34,320
I'd rather die a quick and painless death than die from the sun in agony.

2871
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,060
I don't want to be burned to death.

2872
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:36,800
I don't know!

2873
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:38,980
It's only going to get worse.

2874
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:39,520
I know it.

2875
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:40,480
We're all going to die.

2876
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:41,920
I'm so...

2877
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,400
I'm sorry.

2878
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:43,600
I'm very worried.

2879
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,320
Show me your teeth.

2880
02:07:50,660 --> 02:07:52,220
And then we're going to hear you out.

2881
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:53,520
Yeah.

2882
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:54,340
Okay.

2883
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:56,460
Alright.

2884
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,180
Uh.

2885
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:58,260
Let's go to sleep.

2886
02:07:58,420 --> 02:07:59,040
Let's drink some beer.

2887
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:01,140
Go to sleep.

2888
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:04,280
She's a visitor.

2889
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:05,220
I know.

2890
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:06,600
Wait.

2891
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:07,960
Are we going to die then in the night?

2892
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,520
Let's see.

2893
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:09,660
Do we die immediately?

2894
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:27,570
This one was a freak too, no?

2895
02:08:28,890 --> 02:08:30,450
Oh, thank you so much for the rain.

2896
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:31,210
Thank you.

2897
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:34,310
You don't mind the heat?

2898
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:35,750
I always feel cold.

2899
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:39,310
While some are burning up outside, I wrap myself in jackets and still feel cold.

2900
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:40,870
I'm scared to take off my clothes.

2901
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:43,030
What if it only brings more suffering?

2902
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:44,510
And what if I can't die from it?

2903
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:47,550
Come on in.

2904
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:49,190
Ceiling.

2905
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:50,750
Yeah, you insulted my ceiling.

2906
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:52,390
You hate my little...

2907
02:08:53,910 --> 02:08:55,170
My adorable home.

2908
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:06,040
Oh, I have to turn him away.

2909
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:10,220
Jack is back, baby.

2910
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,240
You're scaring me.

2911
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:12,800
Are you out of your mind?

2912
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:13,540
Listen to me.

2913
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:14,600
I'll give...

2914
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:19,020
Keep him?

2915
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:19,940
But he'll die.

2916
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:21,060
He's going to get eaten.

2917
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:24,140
He's going to get eaten.

2918
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:34,120
It's his destiny.

2919
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:40,460
I can't...

2920
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:41,500
I can't turn him away.

2921
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,420
I can't turn him...

2922
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:46,360
I can't turn him away.

2923
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:48,300
Oh, do you need anything?

2924
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:48,700
Okay.

2925
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:49,860
Goodbye.

2926
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:51,020
Goodbye.

2927
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:51,600
Okay.

2928
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:54,260
No one else will come tonight.

2929
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:54,800
Alright.

2930
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:58,060
So we have...

2931
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:00,740
Two freaks...

2932
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:01,660
In our home.

2933
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:07,580
Someone was killed so fast!

2934
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:08,700
Do I go?

2935
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,940
Thank you so much for the five gifted...

2936
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:11,600
No way!

2937
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,540
Did they eat him immediately?

2938
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:14,740
No.

2939
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:21,120
No way!

2940
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:25,620
We didn't...

2941
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:28,420
We didn't even get to talk to him!

2942
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:37,980
Oh my god!

2943
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:43,060
I wish there was some warmth.

2944
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:44,200
I need to check on you.

2945
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,160
It wasn't her hands all messed up?

2946
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:49,160
Oh yeah, that's right.

2947
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:50,380
Here, out.

2948
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:51,600
I'm so tired of...

2949
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:51,860
You know what?

2950
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:53,060
I'm so tired of living...

2951
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:55,060
Wait.

2952
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:57,460
In the other house, someone I...

2953
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:59,160
Someone must have killed someone, I guess.

2954
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:00,420
Wait, what just happened?

2955
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:01,660
I...

2956
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:02,040
Huh?

2957
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:03,520
It was a bug?

2958
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:04,120
Oh.

2959
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:05,580
Why is it...

2960
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:05,960
What the?

2961
02:11:09,790 --> 02:11:10,390
Wait!

2962
02:11:13,090 --> 02:11:15,110
But I clicked hear her out!

2963
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:19,390
Nobody is safe.

2964
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:21,890
Nobody is safe!

2965
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:27,970
It's fine.

2966
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:29,490
We still have another freak in here.

2967
02:11:32,110 --> 02:11:33,530
I'm not a monster!

2968
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:34,650
I didn't do it!

2969
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:38,030
I tried not to!

2970
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:39,510
My finger slipped!

2971
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:41,790
My finger slipped!

2972
02:11:43,150 --> 02:11:44,890
It's Jack Black Spirit.

2973
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:48,110
Okay, let's see.

2974
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:50,470
I'm the visitor, truly.

2975
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:50,930
Oh!

2976
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:52,950
Who are you?

2977
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:54,070
How's it going?

2978
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:54,730
Everything okay?

2979
02:11:55,690 --> 02:11:57,270
Why are you ignoring my question?

2980
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:58,110
The voices!

2981
02:11:58,770 --> 02:11:59,250
Listen!

2982
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:04,910
What if I say that I'm alone?

2983
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:07,250
I wouldn't test everything!

2984
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:13,630
Say you are alone?

2985
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:14,310
I'm alone.

2986
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,150
How come?

2987
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:17,610
It's hard to be alone.

2988
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:18,370
What's wrong with you?

2989
02:12:18,850 --> 02:12:20,070
Come with me, young man.

2990
02:12:20,410 --> 02:12:20,670
Oh!

2991
02:12:22,930 --> 02:12:25,890
No one will know what happened when the last guest arrived.

2992
02:12:26,290 --> 02:12:28,690
The house is left unoccupied for a long time.

2993
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:32,010
After your terrible disappearance, everyone avoids the abandoned house.

2994
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:32,650
Super.

2995
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:33,930
Super!

2996
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:36,150
Oh, okay.

2997
02:12:40,270 --> 02:12:41,890
Yeah, what if you were actually alone?

2998
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:43,270
Super.

2999
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:46,430
Super, I think.

3000
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:49,050
Should we try again?

3001
02:12:49,330 --> 02:12:50,670
I guess we lost our two...

3002
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:51,750
Our freak.

3003
02:12:51,990 --> 02:12:53,250
I just won't even...

3004
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:53,750
Okay, hold on.

3005
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:56,390
I'm just not even gonna...

3006
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:01,410
I'm not even gonna...

3007
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:02,250
Oh, what's the word?

3008
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:03,510
Super.

3009
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,510
Can I get a spooky happy birthday?

3010
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:06,670
Oh, the username!

3011
02:13:08,050 --> 02:13:09,010
Happy birthday!

3012
02:13:10,190 --> 02:13:11,110
Happy birthday!

3013
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:14,370
We're not even gonna check the...

3014
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:15,430
People that we think are freaks.

3015
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:16,050
Because...

3016
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:17,290
We don't want the bug to happen.

3017
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:18,570
Oh, wait.

3018
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:19,450
Uh, you...

3019
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,670
We will get eaten.

3020
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:37,070
I want to be eaten.

3021
02:13:37,870 --> 02:13:39,570
I want to experience...

3022
02:13:40,930 --> 02:13:41,830
Being eaten.

3023
02:13:54,940 --> 02:13:55,500
Okay.

3024
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:55,620
Okay.

3025
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:56,780
Oh.

3026
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:01,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

3027
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:02,410
I must turn you away.

3028
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:03,710
I'm sorry.

3029
02:14:04,070 --> 02:14:04,990
You better leave.

3030
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:06,830
And then he says, F you.

3031
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:10,330
Okay.

3032
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:11,310
You!

3033
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:12,590
Come on in!

3034
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:14,450
Alright.

3035
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:15,790
Alright.

3036
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:17,530
Time to go to sleep.

3037
02:14:20,570 --> 02:14:21,930
Time to go to sleep.

3038
02:14:25,530 --> 02:14:27,050
Honk shoo, honk shoo.

3039
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:30,270
Alright.

3040
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:32,470
Drink some beer.

3041
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:35,010
Go to sleep.

3042
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:37,950
Alright.

3043
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:38,710
Where is this?

3044
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:39,890
4%?

3045
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:40,590
No!

3046
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:43,490
No!

3047
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:46,230
This is a real speed run though, you guys.

3048
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:49,130
Will we let Jack Black in again?

3049
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:50,690
He gets eaten immediately.

3050
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:56,690
He gets eaten immediately.

3051
02:15:05,630 --> 02:15:06,110
Don't?

3052
02:15:06,290 --> 02:15:06,550
Okay.

3053
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:07,770
We'll let him be free.

3054
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:11,010
Did you pretend you didn't know anything about the sun?

3055
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:12,550
Well, F you then.

3056
02:15:12,690 --> 02:15:13,630
I'll save someone else.

3057
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:14,170
Alright.

3058
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:14,630
Bye-bye.

3059
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:15,030
Bye-bye.

3060
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:17,310
He's so cute.

3061
02:15:22,830 --> 02:15:23,730
This guy.

3062
02:15:27,790 --> 02:15:28,390
Okay.

3063
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:29,570
No one else will come tonight.

3064
02:15:30,050 --> 02:15:33,190
Maybe because they were satiated by him.

3065
02:15:34,570 --> 02:15:36,230
That's why I didn't get eaten.

3066
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:39,590
Oh.

3067
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:40,690
I'm alive.

3068
02:15:42,810 --> 02:15:43,830
That's how...

3069
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:46,750
I think that's how you know that they're both freakazoids.

3070
02:15:48,830 --> 02:15:49,650
Oh, wait.

3071
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:50,650
Okay.

3072
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:53,210
I think that's how you know.

3073
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:55,370
Alright.

3074
02:15:58,050 --> 02:15:58,870
Let's see.

3075
02:15:59,090 --> 02:15:59,270
Alright.

3076
02:15:59,510 --> 02:15:59,910
Bed!

3077
02:16:01,030 --> 02:16:01,590
Bed!

3078
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:11,350
Let's invite some more freaks inside.

3079
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:13,390
Maybe we aren't tasting it, right?

3080
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:15,410
Oh, this guy.

3081
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:16,470
Oh, yeah.

3082
02:16:16,850 --> 02:16:17,830
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

3083
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:21,710
I'm sorry.

3084
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:23,950
Wait.

3085
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:25,270
I'm not alone.

3086
02:16:33,110 --> 02:16:33,690
I...

3087
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:34,710
I

3088
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:45,650
thought the left option was the safe one.

3089
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:46,370
I thought so, too.

3090
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:48,630
I thought it was, too.

3091
02:16:51,610 --> 02:16:53,010
I'm technically alone.

3092
02:16:53,470 --> 02:16:53,870
Maybe.

3093
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:56,370
Because none of them were human.

3094
02:16:56,830 --> 02:16:57,450
Oh, maybe.

3095
02:16:58,110 --> 02:16:59,590
You definitely picked the good one.

3096
02:16:59,790 --> 02:17:00,090
Yeah.

3097
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:03,430
But I didn't get to see what he said because I clicked so fast.

3098
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:07,050
Maybe he's like, No, you think you're not alone, but you are.

3099
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:07,790
Ha, ha, ha.

3100
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:08,350
Ha, ha, ha.

3101
02:17:08,370 --> 02:17:12,330
I will, I will, I will, I will suck your blood.

3102
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:13,610
Blah, blah.

3103
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:17,010
It's because he only had visitors.

3104
02:17:18,570 --> 02:17:19,950
Ah, I see.

3105
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:25,360
That's what happened.

3106
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:26,120
Well.

3107
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:31,280
Yeah, that's probably what he said.

3108
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:35,000
I don't think we can get past that, then.

3109
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,780
Because if we say...

3110
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:41,840
That we're not alone, he still takes us.

3111
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:44,780
You need to have at least one normie to progress.

3112
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:48,840
I could do one more!

3113
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:50,980
Where I just let in everybody.

3114
02:18:00,090 --> 02:18:01,570
We need to take Jug Black.

3115
02:18:01,970 --> 02:18:02,710
Alright, last try.

3116
02:18:02,890 --> 02:18:03,230
Last try.

3117
02:18:05,470 --> 02:18:06,230
Last try.

3118
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:08,370
I don't know why I'm so obsessed.

3119
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:10,910
This is probably not going to be satisfying at all.

3120
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:13,630
I'm so obsessed with...

3121
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:14,530
I wish I could run.

3122
02:18:15,090 --> 02:18:17,550
I'm so obsessed with trying to get this ending.

3123
02:18:17,770 --> 02:18:18,470
I don't know why.

3124
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:19,150
It's like...

3125
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:21,610
It's like something that I must do.

3126
02:18:21,770 --> 02:18:22,430
I'm just...

3127
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:24,110
I'm like a ghost traversing...

3128
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:26,190
The same...

3129
02:18:27,470 --> 02:18:29,190
The same steps every day.

3130
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:35,950
I don't know why I'm so obsessed.

3131
02:18:36,430 --> 02:18:37,410
I don't know.

3132
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:39,270
Okay.

3133
02:18:40,110 --> 02:18:40,930
Drink our beer.

3134
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:42,850
I guess I could have gone through that, but that's okay.

3135
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:43,570
Alright.

3136
02:18:46,550 --> 02:18:47,630
Like a ghost.

3137
02:18:47,850 --> 02:18:48,350
I know.

3138
02:18:48,810 --> 02:18:50,010
That's what I'm saying.

3139
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:53,110
Honestly, I'm curious too.

3140
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:55,990
I'm glad that we can share in our curiosity.

3141
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:57,470
So we'll just let everybody in though.

3142
02:18:58,630 --> 02:19:00,390
It's going to be a full house.

3143
02:19:18,140 --> 02:19:19,040
Next person.

3144
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:20,380
You.

3145
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:21,980
Come on in.

3146
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:22,840
Alright.

3147
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,300
Alright.

3148
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:26,100
Alright.

3149
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:28,680
Party, party, party.

3150
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:30,140
Party, party, party.

3151
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:32,740
Party, party, party.

3152
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:34,520
Party, party, party.

3153
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:38,400
Party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party.

3154
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:44,700
Do you have to back up from the door each time?

3155
02:19:44,980 --> 02:19:45,980
I don't know actually.

3156
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:46,980
Oh wait.

3157
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:49,820
I don't think we need to talk to anybody.

3158
02:19:49,980 --> 02:19:51,640
I think we can just drink our beer and sleep.

3159
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:56,760
I'm feeling drowsy from the beer.

3160
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:14,600
Come on in.

3161
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:19,790
Let's see.

3162
02:20:20,310 --> 02:20:21,330
Oh, there we go.

3163
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:23,550
Come on in.

3164
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:36,760
I actually want to see it.

3165
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:37,480
You're weird.

3166
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,200
It's even safer that way.

3167
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:40,240
For me, mostly.

3168
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:40,740
But still.

3169
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:43,720
It's easier to preserve something from floods, fires, and time.

3170
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,460
Not every seed becomes a tree.

3171
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:45,760
Aha.

3172
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:48,020
Will you read my fortune?

3173
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,880
Oh, but I think I did the middle paragraph.

3174
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:50,880
So let's do the beginning now.

3175
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:52,820
The dead will come and tell.

3176
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:54,460
Oh, it's the same thing?

3177
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:56,080
What is your book just...

3178
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:59,240
The illusion of choice, I guess.

3179
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:04,040
It was the same thing.

3180
02:21:04,500 --> 02:21:05,980
Thanks for the gifted kitties.

3181
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:07,600
Thank you.

3182
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:10,640
Who dies?

3183
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:11,660
Oh.

3184
02:21:13,420 --> 02:21:14,300
Someone died.

3185
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:16,060
Place your bets, everybody.

3186
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:17,400
I think it's Tall Man.

3187
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:28,200
Do you think Jack also died?

3188
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:31,120
We got him.

3189
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:31,700
Okay.

3190
02:21:33,880 --> 02:21:35,060
Let's see what he says.

3191
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,060
Let's just talk to him.

3192
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,560
How do you recognize a visitor?

3193
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:41,900
I don't think I know the plain truth.

3194
02:21:42,220 --> 02:21:42,980
You ask me.

3195
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,180
Who are the visitors?

3196
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:45,680
So here I'll answer you.

3197
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:49,000
They are, my hearty friend, visitors from other planets.

3198
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:54,800
They are the descendants of aliens who came to Earth when the Earth Sun was younger and the grass was greener.

3199
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:59,680
They planted them in the soil like sprouts of evil and they have been growing for eight years.

3200
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,620
So specific.

3201
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:04,580
Now they have crawled out and want to take our Earth.

3202
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:07,060
But the Sun has decided to protect us.

3203
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:09,680
For the Sun is unmilitary to visitors.

3204
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,940
What if he's right?

3205
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:15,640
I'm afraid it's been eight years.

3206
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:16,900
Beep.

3207
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:17,520
Beep.

3208
02:22:17,580 --> 02:22:17,840
Beep.

3209
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:18,300
Beep.

3210
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:18,700
Beep.

3211
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:18,780
Beep.

3212
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,000
Beep.

3213
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:19,120
Beep.

3214
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:19,140
Beep.

3215
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:19,420
Beep.

3216
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:24,060
Otherwise, why have they been hiding underground all this time?

3217
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:27,600
Freak, I wish I had a cold beer.

3218
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:28,400
I got you.

3219
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:29,160
I got you, buddy.

3220
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:33,240
Actually, you have liver problems for real.

3221
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:34,820
What do you know about the cataclysm?

3222
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:36,420
A lot!

3223
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:39,040
And believe me, my friend, this is far from over.

3224
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:40,220
This is just the beginning.

3225
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:43,960
The scale has not yet been filled enough to balance the universal powers.

3226
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,760
It takes more to be burned in the righteous flames of the Sun.

3227
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:52,100
But know, my friend, these sacrifices will not be in vain.

3228
02:22:52,820 --> 02:22:56,260
Someday we will all understand the true intentions of the Sun-faced One.

3229
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:01,040
Freak, sometimes at night I really miss my wife.

3230
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:04,380
Steve!

3231
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:10,320
She was a saintly woman.

3232
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:12,400
But a real piece of work.

3233
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:20,580
Didn't know Chicken Jockey Guy was in this game.

3234
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:21,220
Oh, yeah.

3235
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,040
We got everything.

3236
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:29,420
He misses his wife.

3237
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,000
Peaches!

3238
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,100
Peaches!

3239
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:31,560
Peaches!

3240
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:31,700
Peaches!

3241
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,320
Oh my gosh!

3242
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:35,060
I was talking to a friend the other day.

3243
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:35,980
And I was like, how...

3244
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:40,180
Like, listening to the Lava Chicken song...

3245
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:43,880
It sounds almost exactly like the Peaches song.

3246
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:45,400
And how much do you want to bet?

3247
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:49,360
They were like, we need another song to go viral.

3248
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:50,760
Like the Peaches song.

3249
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:52,680
So...

3250
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:58,600
Because it's like, la-la-la-la-la-ba and Peaches, Peaches, Peaches...

3251
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:58,800
You know?

3252
02:23:59,000 --> 02:23:59,540
It's like the...

3253
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:01,300
It's the same song.

3254
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:05,000
How much do you want to bet?

3255
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:05,820
They were like...

3256
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:06,400
Is there...

3257
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,900
Has anyone seen a Minecraft movie?

3258
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:09,180
Is there anyone else?

3259
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:12,180
Any other songs in that movie?

3260
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:13,860
Except the Lava Chicken song.

3261
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:15,980
Why are you here?

3262
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:18,420
What do you want?

3263
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:19,340
Listen.

3264
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:22,740
I still...

3265
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:23,760
Yeah, I like Peaches better.

3266
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:26,220
Peach.

3267
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:28,140
You're so cool.

3268
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:30,100
It's so crazy also...

3269
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:31,480
How like...

3270
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:34,140
Everybody loved Jack Black for...

3271
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:35,460
For Bowser.

3272
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:37,540
But as soon as he turned...

3273
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:39,500
Everybody turned on him when he became Steve.

3274
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:45,780
They sang four times in the Minecraft movie.

3275
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:46,520
Wait, actually?

3276
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:56,380
It's just not the same.

3277
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:00,540
If only it was animated.

3278
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:02,000
I think that would have helped a ton.

3279
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,380
Honestly, if it was just animated...

3280
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:07,560
It would have helped so much.

3281
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:09,860
It would have helped so much.

3282
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,240
Okay.

3283
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:15,760
I have other people taking shelter.

3284
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:16,740
You're lucky tonight.

3285
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,200
Okay, bye.

3286
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:19,860
Okay, cool.

3287
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:21,660
Back to our...

3288
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:24,760
Regularly scheduled programming.

3289
02:25:25,100 --> 02:25:26,400
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3290
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,680
I'm not gonna let this person in, you guys.

3291
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:34,230
You.

3292
02:25:35,190 --> 02:25:35,590
Scary.

3293
02:25:36,030 --> 02:25:36,110
Oh.

3294
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:40,570
Should we let in Amogus?

3295
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:42,810
Let them all in.

3296
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:43,250
You said...

3297
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:43,730
Okay, fine.

3298
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:44,130
Fine.

3299
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:44,490
Fine.

3300
02:25:44,710 --> 02:25:45,030
Never mind.

3301
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:45,890
Fine, never mind.

3302
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:46,350
Come on in.

3303
02:25:46,490 --> 02:25:46,730
Fine.

3304
02:25:46,930 --> 02:25:47,070
Fine.

3305
02:25:47,210 --> 02:25:47,810
Everybody comes in.

3306
02:25:53,930 --> 02:25:54,330
Fine.

3307
02:25:54,490 --> 02:25:55,270
Everybody comes in.

3308
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:09,410
We're already at the military, guys.

3309
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:12,290
It's a party.

3310
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:21,990
Who's gonna die?

3311
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:26,770
I wonder who died.

3312
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:32,930
At least they have the decency to clean up the bodies, you know?

3313
02:26:36,390 --> 02:26:37,830
Okay, you're still alive.

3314
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:38,210
No.

3315
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:40,330
Wait.

3316
02:26:41,690 --> 02:26:43,430
The doctor's still alive?

3317
02:26:44,390 --> 02:26:45,870
Oh my god, it's so loud.

3318
02:26:50,110 --> 02:26:52,190
I just put them in little baggies.

3319
02:26:55,090 --> 02:26:55,890
Peaches.

3320
02:26:56,090 --> 02:26:56,390
Peaches.

3321
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:06,950
He didn't use creative mode.

3322
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:08,030
So sad.

3323
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:12,950
So sad.

3324
02:27:16,950 --> 02:27:17,310
Oh.

3325
02:27:17,930 --> 02:27:19,090
Uh, you came alone?

3326
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:20,070
No, of course not.

3327
02:27:20,170 --> 02:27:21,630
Our crew is going door to door in the neighborhood.

3328
02:27:21,810 --> 02:27:23,330
We're splitting up to get the job done faster.

3329
02:27:23,610 --> 02:27:24,690
I won't be staying long.

3330
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:26,610
Are we getting a hazmat?

3331
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:27,930
There's no reason to be afraid.

3332
02:27:28,130 --> 02:27:29,710
The suit is in case we catch the sunrise.

3333
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:31,650
Civilians don't need it now.

3334
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:32,290
Just stay home.

3335
02:27:32,490 --> 02:27:33,390
We'll take care of you.

3336
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:34,830
What's next?

3337
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:37,070
Okay, take a man.

3338
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:39,150
Do I have to pack two?

3339
02:27:39,650 --> 02:27:39,950
No.

3340
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:42,010
You are, as I understand it, the owner of the house.

3341
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:42,910
You stay here for now.

3342
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:45,670
We'll take a man away for a while, then decide what to do next.

3343
02:27:45,950 --> 02:27:47,330
We'll issue instructions afterwards.

3344
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:48,330
Oh, there he goes!

3345
02:27:49,230 --> 02:27:50,030
Goodbye, muggles!

3346
02:27:57,420 --> 02:27:58,840
This guy was a freak.

3347
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:01,320
This guy was a freak.

3348
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:02,200
Come on in.

3349
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,420
Come on in, freaky.

3350
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:13,930
He was normal?

3351
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:14,670
He was normal?

3352
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:15,610
No, I thought he was a freak.

3353
02:28:19,090 --> 02:28:19,910
Oh wait, no.

3354
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:20,650
It was the lady.

3355
02:28:21,870 --> 02:28:22,970
It was the...

3356
02:28:22,970 --> 02:28:23,610
It was the...

3357
02:28:23,610 --> 02:28:24,390
The couch lady.

3358
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:25,450
The couch potato lady.

3359
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:29,350
Um...

3360
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:33,090
We need meat shields still.

3361
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:33,770
Do we?

3362
02:28:36,630 --> 02:28:37,970
Bags is normal people.

3363
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:42,790
Oh, when I shot him, he became a bag.

3364
02:28:45,090 --> 02:28:45,590
Uh...

3365
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:50,780
Among Us guy is actually one of the freaks.

3366
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:51,480
Is he really?

3367
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,620
What do I do, you guys?

3368
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:58,200
Are you hysterical?

3369
02:28:58,360 --> 02:28:59,120
I don't know what to do.

3370
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:02,720
Why did they do that?

3371
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:03,260
I don't know.

3372
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,660
They were silently sitting in the kitchen.

3373
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:05,840
They set fire.

3374
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,300
While I was running, they were laughing.

3375
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:13,560
The bald guy is human, but kills others.

3376
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:15,700
The Among Us guy?

3377
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:16,820
No way.

3378
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:19,200
Guys, I don't want to take her in.

3379
02:29:29,530 --> 02:29:30,550
You need to.

3380
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:35,390
Oh, no, the suit guy.

3381
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:37,030
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

3382
02:29:39,490 --> 02:29:40,390
You need her.

3383
02:29:40,770 --> 02:29:40,850
Okay.

3384
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:50,470
How do you travel?

3385
02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:53,110
You want to kill the...

3386
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:53,990
Oh, where's your weapon?

3387
02:29:54,190 --> 02:29:54,930
I had a gun.

3388
02:29:55,150 --> 02:29:56,350
I almost got myself killed.

3389
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:59,730
They waited until I was asleep in the tent and stole my gun.

3390
02:29:59,970 --> 02:30:00,750
I was running.

3391
02:30:00,890 --> 02:30:01,430
They were shooting.

3392
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:03,070
That's the kind of fun they have.

3393
02:30:03,510 --> 02:30:05,610
There's nothing human, but a shell.

3394
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:06,870
Okay, come in.

3395
02:30:13,890 --> 02:30:14,250
Uh...

3396
02:30:14,890 --> 02:30:15,790
Uh, who are you?

3397
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:17,250
I used to live a couple...

3398
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:18,790
How many of you left?

3399
02:30:18,890 --> 02:30:20,030
I'm telling you, the whole house.

3400
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:22,110
Somebody didn't leave on their own.

3401
02:30:22,250 --> 02:30:23,090
The yellows...

3402
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:24,890
He grabs it like...

3403
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:25,310
Oh, wait.

3404
02:30:25,970 --> 02:30:26,130
Okay.

3405
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:26,610
Come on in.

3406
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:27,950
I know you're evil.

3407
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:29,150
Okay.

3408
02:30:30,030 --> 02:30:30,370
Wait.

3409
02:30:34,210 --> 02:30:34,730
Uh...

3410
02:30:34,730 --> 02:30:35,370
Guys, I'm stuck.

3411
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:37,690
Wait.

3412
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:39,310
Guys?

3413
02:30:41,690 --> 02:30:42,510
Guys, am I...

3414
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:42,970
I'm stuck.

3415
02:30:51,580 --> 02:30:53,100
I'm one with the wall!

3416
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:54,840
Wait, what?

3417
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:56,880
Oh!

3418
02:30:57,100 --> 02:30:57,220
Oh!

3419
02:30:57,480 --> 02:30:57,660
Oh!

3420
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:57,820
Wait.

3421
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:01,660
I can only...

3422
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:03,080
Hold on.

3423
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,340
Let me make sure that it's not my keyboard.

3424
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:10,340
Okay.

3425
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:11,840
It's not my keyboard.

3426
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:14,680
Okay.

3427
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:15,200
Oh.

3428
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,160
Minto timeout.

3429
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:17,600
No!

3430
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:18,800
Okay.

3431
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,800
We can make this.

3432
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,480
We can do this.

3433
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:25,080
I can only walk backwards.

3434
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:33,210
Somebody was killed!

3435
02:31:34,810 --> 02:31:35,390
Okay.

3436
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:36,190
We're fine now.

3437
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:40,210
Everything's fine.

3438
02:31:41,610 --> 02:31:42,550
Everything's fine.

3439
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:43,310
Who was killed?

3440
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:46,490
The doctor?

3441
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:51,290
Oh.

3442
02:31:52,630 --> 02:31:53,790
Wait, who was killed?

3443
02:31:58,370 --> 02:31:59,590
There was no bodies!

3444
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:06,810
The girl?

3445
02:32:07,470 --> 02:32:08,670
No, she's right there!

3446
02:32:13,310 --> 02:32:14,910
Twerks to the door.

3447
02:32:19,330 --> 02:32:20,250
I'm...

3448
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:21,190
So confused!

3449
02:32:25,550 --> 02:32:26,010
Weird.

3450
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:32,680
I think the girl glitched.

3451
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:33,740
Maybe we can talk to her?

3452
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:35,060
Oh!

3453
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:35,780
Oh!

3454
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:38,220
I cannot talk to her.

3455
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:40,840
Oh no!

3456
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:47,770
Oh my god!

3457
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:51,910
She's not meant to be killed, but can still be killed anyway.

3458
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:52,310
But...

3459
02:32:52,310 --> 02:32:53,330
She's a ghost!

3460
02:32:53,570 --> 02:32:54,030
Just like me!

3461
02:32:54,350 --> 02:32:54,930
Is the end near?

3462
02:32:55,390 --> 02:32:57,390
I believe the end will come for us if we don't stop the visitors.

3463
02:32:57,650 --> 02:33:00,830
These damn beasts want to deceive us and sneak in behind our backs.

3464
02:33:01,010 --> 02:33:04,710
And slaughter us one by one, under cover in the night, while we sleep.

3465
02:33:04,990 --> 02:33:07,430
I think they might get to you sooner or later.

3466
02:33:07,630 --> 02:33:10,570
But that won't happen if you kill the visitors before he kills you.

3467
02:33:12,290 --> 02:33:12,730
Yeah.

3468
02:33:18,410 --> 02:33:19,130
She's dead.

3469
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:28,580
You've done a lot for those who let...

3470
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:29,400
Who you let in.

3471
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:31,540
But too much blood has been spilled.

3472
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:33,700
You are too dangerous to stay in this house!

3473
02:33:33,860 --> 02:33:34,520
You must leave!

3474
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:36,660
You are being driven out by your own...

3475
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:39,800
Driven out of your own home by people fearing for their safety.

3476
02:33:40,180 --> 02:33:41,480
You didn't live one day.

3477
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:43,780
And burned by the scorching sun.

3478
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:46,640
I didn't live a single day!

3479
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:47,560
I didn't live a single day!

3480
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:51,430
What?

3481
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:56,090
What?

3482
02:33:56,630 --> 02:33:58,090
It's my house!

3483
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:03,460
Welp.

3484
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:05,020
Um...

3485
02:34:05,860 --> 02:34:06,940
That's kinda funny.

3486
02:34:08,380 --> 02:34:09,820
It was a mutiny!

3487
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:10,040
It was a mutiny!

3488
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:11,100
They took over my home!

3489
02:34:20,670 --> 02:34:21,650
Wait, what was that?

3490
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:26,490
If I were to draw a fan art, am I allowed to draw mint as floating or translucent?

3491
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:27,910
Yeah!

3492
02:34:28,190 --> 02:34:28,910
I'm a ghost!

3493
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:31,970
Where else can I post mint fan art?

3494
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:32,630
Ugh!

3495
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:34,190
I guess...

3496
02:34:34,190 --> 02:34:36,510
I guess wherever you want to.

3497
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:37,910
I, um...

3498
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:39,710
I...

3499
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:44,870
Might not see it if it's other places, but you can, you know, post wherever you want.

3500
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:47,110
Difficult to catch streams, but I love you.

3501
02:34:47,170 --> 02:34:47,950
Thank you, soul!

3502
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:48,830
Thank you!

3503
02:34:50,350 --> 02:34:52,110
Well, that was Sillyhand.

3504
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:56,210
Yeah, there's Pixiv, there's Boosguy.

3505
02:35:00,430 --> 02:35:02,070
How about not letting anyone in?

3506
02:35:02,150 --> 02:35:04,870
I don't think we can do that because we'll just get stuck at the, uh...

3507
02:35:05,750 --> 02:35:06,630
The guy again.

3508
02:35:07,070 --> 02:35:08,830
The shirtless man.

3509
02:35:11,430 --> 02:35:11,830
So...

3510
02:35:15,050 --> 02:35:16,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3511
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:18,410
The nippleless man.

3512
02:35:20,610 --> 02:35:21,910
This was fun, though.

3513
02:35:22,270 --> 02:35:23,250
This was silly, no?

3514
02:35:24,510 --> 02:35:26,070
Tall man, you were a real one.

3515
02:35:26,190 --> 02:35:26,530
I...

3516
02:35:26,530 --> 02:35:28,850
That's my biggest regret, was letting him die.

3517
02:35:30,350 --> 02:35:32,590
Letting tall man die was my biggest regret.

3518
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:36,430
It was by that...

3519
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:37,650
The girl in the jacket, no?

3520
02:35:46,650 --> 02:35:48,550
He was a real homie.

3521
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:50,950
Jack Black was my favorite character.

3522
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:56,310
This was, uh...

3523
02:35:56,310 --> 02:35:58,510
So there is gonna be a full version of this game.

3524
02:35:58,950 --> 02:36:02,950
I think it said Fall 2025, so...

3525
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:04,090
Wyoming Conquest!

3526
02:36:04,670 --> 02:36:05,930
The name changes.

3527
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:11,930
So I'm really curious where they go with the story.

3528
02:36:16,190 --> 02:36:18,930
If you let three people die, you get kicked out.

3529
02:36:19,350 --> 02:36:19,830
Aw...

3530
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:21,270
I wanted to get eaten.

3531
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:25,510
What's a girl gotta do to get eaten around here?

3532
02:36:26,670 --> 02:36:29,630
I told you we shouldn't have let the little girl in.

3533
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:33,310
Jesus Christ!

3534
02:36:33,610 --> 02:36:34,450
Thanks for the gifted.

3535
02:36:35,450 --> 02:36:37,610
We showed them who the real freaks were.

3536
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:38,710
Now we're homeless.

3537
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:48,800
Continuing the cycle.

3538
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,820
Why is it so hard to get eaten?

3539
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:56,480
Devs will have a field day fixing bugs in this game by watching the beat of mine.

3540
02:36:57,180 --> 02:36:59,360
I can't believe we got stuck on the wall.

3541
02:36:59,960 --> 02:37:01,500
And then there was the ghost.

3542
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,420
I need to see what the ghost was.

3543
02:37:03,580 --> 02:37:04,460
Wait, I'm gonna look it up.

3544
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:08,500
Hold on.

3545
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:13,420
No.

3546
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:14,980
I'm...

3547
02:37:14,980 --> 02:37:15,380
Wait.

3548
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:19,000
I'm not a human.

3549
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:21,160
Ghost...

3550
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:22,560
Oh wait, a ghost!

3551
02:37:29,470 --> 02:37:30,730
Ghost in the living room!

3552
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:41,990
On the second day, after letting in the conspiracy guy and turning away the cold woman, I'd noticed a ghostly woman sitting on the right side armchair in the living room, who disappeared after I opened the door!

3553
02:37:42,670 --> 02:37:48,250
I only had the tall man in there, and I had killed the homeless woman on the same day before going in.

3554
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:49,730
What...

3555
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:50,610
What woman?

3556
02:37:51,210 --> 02:37:53,590
I haven't been able to find anything written about this anywhere.

3557
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:55,530
Has anyone noticed anything like it?

3558
02:38:07,410 --> 02:38:08,970
Oh, there's like a...

3559
02:38:08,970 --> 02:38:10,370
There's like a secret...

3560
02:38:10,370 --> 02:38:12,790
Oh, there's secrets and easter eggs in the...

3561
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:13,390
In the game.

3562
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:14,170
Already?

3563
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:15,150
That's crazy!

3564
02:38:16,550 --> 02:38:17,970
I am Steve!

3565
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:21,250
Always fun to watch him in the after work!

3566
02:38:21,390 --> 02:38:22,030
Thank you!

3567
02:38:23,570 --> 02:38:25,490
Watch the trailer for a little bit of lore!

3568
02:38:25,670 --> 02:38:26,010
Oh, okay!

3569
02:38:26,230 --> 02:38:27,670
I actually did watch it...

3570
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:28,230
Or...

3571
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:29,650
I watched...

3572
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:30,490
Kind of...

3573
02:38:30,490 --> 02:38:32,670
It earlier, because I was just like, These are coming out!

3574
02:38:33,650 --> 02:38:34,090
So...

3575
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:37,810
But yeah, this is fun!

3576
02:38:39,210 --> 02:38:39,650
And...

3577
02:38:39,650 --> 02:38:42,930
I hope you guys enjoyed hanging out with me!

3578
02:38:42,930 --> 02:38:43,090
Eh?

3579
02:38:43,550 --> 02:38:44,510
Good to meet you!

3580
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:44,950
Meet us!

3581
02:38:45,630 --> 02:38:46,070
Escort!

3582
02:38:46,210 --> 02:38:46,990
Is that Sakura gone?

3583
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:49,910
I felt bad getting a free check-in.

3584
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:51,090
So here you go!

3585
02:38:51,310 --> 02:38:51,690
No!

3586
02:38:53,490 --> 02:38:54,590
What are you talking about?

3587
02:38:54,690 --> 02:38:55,570
They were meant to be free!

3588
02:38:57,430 --> 02:38:58,430
But thank you!

3589
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:00,130
Thanks for the fun stream!

3590
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:01,670
Glad you could escape the wall...

3591
02:39:03,130 --> 02:39:03,570
Without...

3592
02:39:03,570 --> 02:39:04,090
I...

3593
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:07,510
Have a good rest!

3594
02:39:07,650 --> 02:39:08,130
Thank you!

3595
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:10,710
Thank you!

3596
02:39:10,790 --> 02:39:11,690
Thank you to our goal!

3597
02:39:14,090 --> 02:39:14,610
Um...

3598
02:39:14,610 --> 02:39:16,550
It's a bit of a shorter stream today...

3599
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:17,930
But tomorrow I think will be longer...

3600
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:19,570
And...

3601
02:39:19,570 --> 02:39:22,230
Sunday will be very long of a stream...

3602
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,510
So...

3603
02:39:22,510 --> 02:39:23,530
Fake Nathaku!

3604
02:39:23,970 --> 02:39:25,670
What a weird but interesting game!

3605
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:26,350
Yeah!

3606
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:27,490
I am a nightmare!

3607
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:30,110
Non-stop!

3608
02:39:30,350 --> 02:39:31,270
Mimmy nightmare!

3609
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:36,760
Doom no clip codes!

3610
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:37,000
Oh!

3611
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:38,580
Thank you!

3612
02:39:41,800 --> 02:39:42,600
Thank you!

3613
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:45,200
Thank you!

3614
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:46,940
But um...

3615
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:47,120
Yeah!

3616
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:48,400
Thank you guys!

3617
02:39:48,760 --> 02:39:49,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3618
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:51,200
I hope you guys had fun!

3619
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:53,160
And I will see you when I see you next!

3620
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:55,080
Sorry again for the shorter stream!

3621
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:56,180
But um...

3622
02:39:56,180 --> 02:39:56,840
I had fun!

3623
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:58,840
Sorry that we couldn't get eaten!

3624
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:01,580
Maybe...

3625
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:31,540
Alright!

3626
02:40:31,540 --> 02:40:32,160
The Super Chat!

3627
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:33,300
It's okay!

3628
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:35,500
It's okay!

3629
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:36,660
I...

3630
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:38,500
I can read your messages in chat!

3631
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:40,300
But thank you so much!

3632
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:41,340
Thank you!

3633
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:42,400
Okie dokie!

3634
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:44,380
Hit end!

3635
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:45,540
Oh god!

3636
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:46,220
Alright!

3637
02:40:46,420 --> 02:40:47,300
You want me gone, right?

3638
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:48,080
You want me to leave?

3639
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:48,800
Fine!

3640
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:49,540
I understand!

3641
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:50,880
I understand!

3642
02:40:51,240 --> 02:40:51,760
You're like...

3643
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:52,520
Get out of here, Minto!

3644
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:53,680
Get out of here!

3645
02:40:53,960 --> 02:40:54,800
We don't want you...

3646
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:55,160
We don't...

3647
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:56,580
Earthquake!

3648
02:40:56,580 --> 02:40:57,580
Woooowooowwww!

3649
02:40:58,820 --> 02:40:59,700
Woooow!

3650
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:01,760
OOOOOAAAHHH!
