1
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,980
I kept you waiting, huh?

2
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,480
Welcome back, Master and Lady!

3
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Oh my god, I don't know what it is.

4
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,560
This, like, title menu music is making me so emotional.

5
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,980
Thank you so much!

6
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,200
Thank you to the five gifted!

7
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,100
And... oh no, am I gonna say your name wrong?

8
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,880
Joao!

9
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,140
Thank you to the five gifted!

10
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,940
Welcome home, boss!

11
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,560
Welcome home!

12
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,040
Welcome home!

13
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,460
Oh my god, can we watch the one-hour briefing too?

14
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,400
Uh, I...

15
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,260
Oh, yes, first of all, yes!

16
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,920
Still afraid!

17
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,100
Thanks for the ten gifted!

18
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,600
Thank you!

19
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,880
Thank you for the ten gifted!

20
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,640
Thank you guys!

21
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,960
I want to... Before we start, I wanna kind of...

22
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,460
I guess, go over some stuff.

23
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,640
Because I think maybe some people are like...

24
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,400
Maybe some people are like, I think Mint has played Metal Gear before, so...

25
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,080
What's the deal, yo?

26
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,400
Is she just replaying Metal Gear?

27
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,760
Essentially, the short answer is yes.

28
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,700
The short answer is just yes.

29
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm replaying Metal Gear series.

30
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:57,240
So... But probably for the games, when I played Metal Gear Solid originally, I played the original PlayStation version.

31
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,680
This time I will be playing...

32
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,940
...Integral.

33
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,820
So probably for games like...

34
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,380
For the games, I'll probably be playing Metal Gear Solid.

35
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,700
Maybe like a different version of them.

36
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,020
Thank you guys for all the gifted!

37
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,080
Thank you guys so much!

38
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,860
Thank you!

39
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

40
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,400
I really appreciate it!

41
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,000
Integral has Japanese text only for the menus.

42
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,580
Everything else is in English.

43
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,500
So don't worry if you're just like, wait, but it's in Japanese!

44
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,600
Only like the stuff about the weapons and...

45
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
You know, the information about like...

46
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,100
The rations...

47
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,800
Stuff like that.

48
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,540
That's only...

49
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,460
But we know what the guns do!

50
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
We know what the Nikita missiles do, and the Stinger missiles do!

51
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,220
Yeah, so...

52
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,520
It will be in Japanese, but...

53
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,160
But all the voices are in English.

54
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,600
And everything like that, so...

55
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,460
Gun goes pew-pew.

56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,840
Oh my gosh!

57
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,340
Thank you!

58
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,040
Send tweet!

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,100
Thank you so much for the...

60
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,680
Akasofa, thank you!

61
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,060
Thank you, thank you!

62
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,000
Is it EN dub?

63
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,640
Yes!

64
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
It is still EN dub.

65
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,860
Yes, yes, yes.

66
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,960
My most annoyingly Huey voice.

67
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,760
Um, excuse me, boss!

68
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,700
The sneaking suit is in the thumbnail!

69
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Oh gosh!

70
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,840
The sneaking suit is in the thumbnail!

71
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,020
But...

72
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,820
Essentially...

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,180
I really love Metal Gear.

74
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
And I just really...

75
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,800
Want to stream it.

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,280
Um...

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,200
I think I've...

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,540
Oh my gosh!

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,300
Thank you for the 15 gifted!

80
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,140
Thank you guys for all the gifted!

81
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,440
Thank you so much, Bloodless!

82
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,220
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

83
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,000
Did you know that you can put fake data on the virtual memory card for these versions?

84
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,040
I didn't know that!

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,760
I did, I did, I did.

86
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,100
But thank you for the reminder.

87
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,200
Um...

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,060
I really just wanted to play Metal Gear.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,660
That's why...

90
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,120
Well, I played Twin Snakes.

91
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,200
Um...

92
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,260
There's actually one Metal Gear game I still haven't played, which is Acid.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,600
So...

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,640
But also...

95
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,320
I need to get through the other games to get to Acid.

96
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,900
Um...

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Oh, and Ghost Babble.

98
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,380
You're so right.

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,540
And Ghost Babble.

100
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,340
But um...

101
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,260
But anyway...

102
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,780
Um...

103
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,660
Uh...

104
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,420
So...

105
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,840
When I...

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,020
Think of like my channel...

107
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,280
And like the games that I've played...

108
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,820
Like...

109
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,320
I think of it kind of as like a resume.

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,900
Where I'm just like...

111
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,360
This is...

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,780
This is my work, right?

113
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,240
It's kind of like...

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
You know...

115
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,060
How do I say it?

116
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,880
Like if someone were to be like...

117
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,480
What...

118
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,940
What has Mint played?

119
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,020
What does Mint like?

120
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,400
It's kind of...

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,780
In that way, I'm like...

122
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,340
Oh yeah...

123
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,100
I can't claim to say that I love Metal Gear so much...

124
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,620
And not have it on my channel.

125
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,720
You know what I mean?

126
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,040
Yeah, like a portfolio!

127
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,740
Yeah, that's a better way to say it.

128
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,100
That's the word I was thinking of.

129
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,760
A portfolio!

130
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,700
And so...

131
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,120
If you're just like...

132
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,300
You know...

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,920
I think Mint has already played Metal Gear.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,260
I think she really likes it.

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,020
But I also need people who don't know me...

136
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,480
Who come to my channel for the first time...

137
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,660
To also see how much I love Metal Gear.

138
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,560
A.K.A Konami.

139
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,900
Konami, if you're watching...

140
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,200
Hi!

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,020
I love Metal Gear!

142
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,100
Please sponsor me!

143
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,640
Thank you!

144
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Thank you!

145
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,840
Thank you!

146
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,940
Thank you!

147
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,240
Thank you!

148
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm waiting for Delta!

149
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm very patient!

150
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,440
But also, Snake is running out of air in his little Eggie.

151
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,280
Thank you, Ducky.

152
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Thank you for the donut.

153
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,080
But also...

154
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,380
Even though my brain rot for Metal Gear is very great...

155
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,680
I am not a gamer.

156
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,100
So please...

157
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,420
Be patient with me.

158
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,480
There may be times that...

159
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,360
You say...

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,860
Mint!

161
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,260
Do this thing instead!

162
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,360
What's wrong with you?

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
And my brain...

164
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,520
Says no.

165
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,940
So...

166
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,400
Please be patient with me.

167
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,960
Because I'm...

168
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,860
Not a gamer.

169
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
And I...

170
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,900
Will mess up and be slow.

171
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,840
Please be patient.

172
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,860
I'm a Vtuber.

173
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,100
You may say things such as...

174
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,580
VTuber!

175
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,280
Get the thermal goggles!

176
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,960
And I say...

177
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,140
No!

178
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
Because I am also stubborn.

179
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,540
But we're just here to have a good time.

180
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,040
I'm not doing any sort of challenges or anything like that.

181
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm not here to be like...

182
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,780
European extreme.

183
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,200
No kill.

184
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,840
No alerts.

185
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,260
Whatever, whatever.

186
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm just here to have a good time.

187
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,620
And relish in my brain rot.

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Will you play VR Mission someday?

189
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,420
I would love to!

190
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,160
Because I've actually played...

191
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,440
Um...

192
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,500
Like...

193
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,800
Not VR Missions the game the game.

194
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,760
But like some of the VR Missions.

195
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,000
But...

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,600
I do know about like...

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,540
The fun...

198
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,860
The fun...

199
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,140
Um...

200
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,460
Oh my gosh.

201
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:25,880
Hi, it's me!

202
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,700
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

203
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,960
You guys are going so crazy.

204
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,220
Thank you so much!

205
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,940
Thank you!

206
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,140
Um...

207
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:34,940
Um...

208
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,780
What was I saying?

209
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,340
Oh!

210
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,940
Like the fun missions like...

211
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,660
The one with like the giant...

212
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,180
Um...

213
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,140
Genome soldier.

214
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,000
And the one...

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,300
My favorite is the...

216
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,720
Um...

217
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,880
Is the...

218
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,380
Uh...

219
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,160
Locked room murder mystery.

220
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,060
Love it.

221
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
I love it, love it, love it.

222
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,520
Genola!

223
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,340
Yeah!

224
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,060
The return of Genola.

225
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,100
But yes.

226
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,660
So...

227
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,020
Um...

228
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,340
Yeah, we're just here to have a good time.

229
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,040
I really love Metal Gear.

230
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,960
I really love...

231
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,940
You know...

232
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,400
I love the gameplay of Metal Gear.

233
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,740
But I mostly love the story.

234
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,680
So if you're just like...

235
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:11,940
God!

236
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,140
She loves Metal Gear so much!

237
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,200
But she's so bad!

238
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
It's because...

239
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,980
I'm a sucker for the lore.

240
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,820
But that's okay.

241
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,860
I endure the gaming and the stealth.

242
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,440
So that I can see the characters that I love so much.

243
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,080
But anyway.

244
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,300
So if you're just like...

245
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,620
Man!

246
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,020
What games will Mint be playing of Metal Gear?

247
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,340
Um...

248
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
Probably all of them.

249
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,760
Because I want them on my channel.

250
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,400
And also...

251
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,920
I like them.

252
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,060
And yes, I think that includes Five.

253
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,780
Because I'm insane.

254
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,380
Oh God...

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,580
So...

256
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,960
I think this will be...

257
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,780
A pretty long journey.

258
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,500
Um...

259
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,800
Of Metal Gear Madness.

260
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,820
But I think we will have...

261
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,860
A fun time.

262
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,260
So...

263
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,300
Let's start!

264
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,120
First on Metal Gear Solid Integral.

265
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,480
And yes!

266
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm gonna be playing them as if they are...

267
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,540
As if like...

268
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,120
Not that I'm playing for the first time.

269
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,760
But if someone has never seen Metal Gear before.

270
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,980
I'm not gonna be like...

271
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,580
I'm going to try to avoid spoilers when talking.

272
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,520
And also I'm going to...

273
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,880
Uh...

274
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,520
Watch like all the cutscenes and things like that.

275
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,380
As if we're playing it for the first time.

276
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,440
Um...

277
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,640
So if anybody...

278
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,600
Also...

279
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,500
Has never experienced Metal Gear.

280
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,060
And it's your first time watching.

281
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,020
You can feel like this is a safe place.

282
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,120
Well, hopefully.

283
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,460
Gosh!

284
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,540
Oh my gosh.

285
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,260
Thank you for the...

286
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,660
Thank you guys for the super chats.

287
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,420
And all the gifteds.

288
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,420
I really, really appreciate it.

289
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,880
Thank you!

290
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,860
Thank you, thank you.

291
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,500
Should we do smiley faces in the chat?

292
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,440
You can do it if you see a spoiler.

293
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,160
But don't do it for my sake.

294
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Because, you know, for me it's whatever.

295
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,160
But you can do it if you're just like...

296
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:22,900
Hey!

297
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,620
Get that spoiler off the screen.

298
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,900
For the new people!

299
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,020
Yeah.

300
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,960
So hopefully we can all respect that.

301
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
And remember that for future games as well.

302
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,140
Yeah.

303
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,920
And you know, it's not gonna be...

304
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,280
If you forget, that's okay too.

305
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,080
Don't worry about it.

306
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:44,920
I'm new.

307
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,960
Are you?

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,320
Oh yeah.

309
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,200
You're totally new.

310
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,860
I've never seen your name before.

311
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,440
Sorry.

312
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,740
The dog...

313
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,060
The dog's in.

314
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,200
The dog's in.

315
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,960
The dog's in!

316
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,420
Oh.

317
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Okie dokie.

318
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,560
Thanks guys!

319
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,100
Let's do the edit save data first.

320
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:05,960
Okay.

321
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,900
It did save.

322
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,060
I did test it out earlier.

323
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,540
So...

324
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
I guess spoilers, I guess.

325
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,680
Oh wait.

326
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,180
Back.

327
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:15,820
Cool.

328
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,740
Start the main...

329
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,140
Oh my gosh.

330
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,460
You guys...

331
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,740
You guys want to know what I love so much about...

332
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,120
Look at this.

333
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,520
So...

334
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,340
Wait, how do I go through it?

335
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,660
No.

336
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,440
How do I move through it?

337
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,540
How do I...

338
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,300
Jump the page?

339
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,620
No.

340
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,520
Oh, there we go.

341
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,320
I was like, what the hell?

342
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,780
Guys, look at this.

343
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:43,940
Guys, look at this.

344
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,960
Guys, look at this.

345
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:44,820
When I...

346
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,920
Okay, so someone's making a mod that puts my...

347
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,360
Me.

348
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,460
That puts me, Mint Phantom, into the game.

349
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,780
You can play.

350
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,480
It's a mod...

351
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,400
It's a mod swap.

352
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,940
And I was just like, oh my gosh, what if I like, dub over Snake's lines so that, you know...

353
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,080
So you like Tokimeki Memorials.

354
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,260
Oh my gosh, yes.

355
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
And like...

356
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,620
Um...

357
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,060
I was like, what if I dub over this...

358
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,680
All the lines.

359
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,060
And I was like, totally serious.

360
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,440
Because I was like, um, the Master Collection has the entire script.

361
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,420
Of the game.

362
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,980
And also...

363
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,260
Of the Codex.

364
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,180
So I was like, it'll be easy.

365
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,420
So, um, I hope you guys are excited for membership dubbing streams for the next couple of months.

366
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,880
I'll probably do it in membership.

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
So, um...

368
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah.

369
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,140
And then I will just, uh, be recording for days.

370
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,700
Who the hell is Kenneth?

371
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,190
Kenneth!

372
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,700
Kenneth Baker.

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,120
I forgot this is...

374
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Just seeing Kenneth not Baker by itself.

375
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,460
Like, Kenneth by itself is just so funny.

376
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,100
Oh, spoilers.

377
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh my gosh, there's spoilers here.

378
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,460
You guys, open the menu.

379
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,880
How do I get out of here?

380
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,920
Oh, yes.

381
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,580
Yes.

382
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,880
Kenneth Baker.

383
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Kenneth is just such a funny, like...

384
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,340
Oh, it's Kenneth.

385
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,960
Anyway, okay.

386
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,620
You guys.

387
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,520
We'll see him later.

388
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,180
Um, actually the MGS2 Sneaking Suit is just the suit from MGS1 with the vest and pants swapped out for Tactical Harness.

389
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,080
So close enough to be...

390
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,820
Oh, thank you.

391
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,760
Yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm, uh, in the thumbnail, I'm, um, just a little more naked.

392
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,360
But not Naked Snake.

393
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,760
Unless...

394
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,540
Oh my gosh.

395
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,520
You guys, I think I manifested...

396
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:22,140
I think I manifested the, um, the MGS2 Figma redo, like, or update.

397
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,100
Because, like, literally the day before...

398
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:36,700
I was on my PS3 getting ready for Tokyo Jungle, and I was like, oh, I wonder if they still have, like, the icons, and I can buy a Metal Gear icon.

399
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,620
And you know which one I bought?

400
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,920
I bought Metal Gear Solid 2 Snake icon!

401
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,280
Like, I almost bought Paz.

402
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,660
I almost bought Peace Walker Paz, but I was like, no, you know what?

403
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,640
I really like the blue.

404
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,860
I really like the Metal Gear Solid 2 blue.

405
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,120
Now I'm gonna get Snake.

406
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,540
I think I manifested it.

407
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,360
I think I did that.

408
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
You're welcome, everybody.

409
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,000
That must be why they released it.

410
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,540
I think so!

411
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
I think so!

412
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,540
Will your MGS mod have the cake?

413
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,060
Of course.

414
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,600
Actually, I think you should ask the...

415
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,100
the boss.

416
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,180
The people, the modelers.

417
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
If it isn't Saucy Vito.

418
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,100
I'm late.

419
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,720
No, you're not.

420
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,780
We're just getting started.

421
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,180
Don't worry about it.

422
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,560
Oh my gosh.

423
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,420
Here we go, everybody.

424
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,850
Choo, choo, choo.

425
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,890
Choo, choo, choo.

426
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,650
Choo, choo, choo.

427
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,450
Choo, choo, choo.

428
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:54,750
Choo, choo, choo.

429
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,930
Choo, choo, choo.

430
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,230
Choo, choo, choo.

431
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,630
Choo,

432
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:13,880
choo, choo.

433
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,600
Have you ever played Policenauts?

434
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,940
Not yet.

435
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,780
I do know what that little tune is from Policenauts, though, right?

436
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
Or was it Snatcher?

437
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,720
Or was it Snatcher?

438
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,400
It's from one of them.

439
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:27,620
It's from one of them.

440
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:27,900
I can't remember.

441
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,240
Hi, Menzo!

442
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,500
Hello!

443
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,980
Oh!

444
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Hold on.

445
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,580
Wait.

446
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,840
Was it in... No.

447
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,480
Hold on.

448
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,340
Hold on.

449
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,500
Wait.

450
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,200
No, not off.

451
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,940
Hold on.

452
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,240
Return to the menu.

453
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,660
Wait.

454
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,380
How do I do it again?

455
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:58,900
Oh, shoot.

456
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,180
I forgot to change it to the...

457
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,040
Oh, it's under... Okay.

458
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,020
We have to go to the main menu.

459
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,540
Go to the main menu in the game.

460
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,780
And change it there.

461
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,320
My bad.

462
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:08,680
Sorry.

463
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,160
I forgot to change it to the subtitles.

464
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,920
I forgot to change the subtitles.

465
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,160
It's because we just went straight into the video.

466
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,820
There we go.

467
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,080
There we go.

468
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,500
There we go.

469
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,900
There we go.

470
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,280
There we go.

471
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,620
There we go.

472
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,600
It's just because we went straight into the game, right?

473
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,980
So I was like...

474
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,240
I was like, wait.

475
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,740
I didn't change it.

476
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,200
Okay.

477
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
We'll just watch the briefing.

478
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,500
Okay.

479
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,880
Now.

480
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,900
Now we got it.

481
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,120
Okay.

482
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,580
Now we got it.

483
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,320
It's been a long time, Snake.

484
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,980
I should have known you were behind this, Colonel.

485
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,960
That's no way to greet an old war buddy, Snake.

486
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,100
What do you want from me?

487
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,100
I just invited you here so we could have a talk.

488
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,820
Invited?

489
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,960
That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me?

490
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,000
Who's taking care of the dogs?

491
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,320
We're rough with you.

492
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,260
But we've got a serious situation here.

493
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,440
Only you can get us out of it.

494
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,060
I'm retired from Foxhound.

495
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,800
You're not my commander anymore.

496
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,580
And I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else.

497
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,160
You will take these orders.

498
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,400
Without the filter and everything of this picture.

499
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,880
Excuse me.

500
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,300
Who's this?

501
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
Dr. Naomi Hunter.

502
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,080
She's chief of Foxhound's medical staff.

503
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,700
Dr. Naomi Hunter!

504
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,480
Are you military?

505
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,640
How's the audio, by the way?

506
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,920
I've been sent here from ATGC.

507
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,180
He looks blonde here.

508
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,580
I know.

509
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,660
That's why a lot of people think he was blonde.

510
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
This injection won't hurt a bit.

511
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,140
What's the shot for?

512
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,080
What's wrong?

513
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,500
You don't like shots?

514
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
No, I don't!

515
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,940
Snake, listen up.

516
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,940
It all went down five hours ago.

517
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,540
Heavily armed soldiers occupied Shadow Moses Island.

518
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,420
Shadow Moses Island?

519
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,340
Alaska.

520
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,980
What soldiers?

521
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,540
Next generation special forces led by members of unit Foxhound.

522
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,300
They've presented Washington with a single demand.

523
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,960
And they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.

524
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,460
A nuclear weapon?

525
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,060
I'm afraid so.

526
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,720
You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility.

527
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,460
Foxhound hijacking a nuclear weapon?

528
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,060
Foxhound hijacking a nuclear weapon?

529
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,520
Now you understand how serious the situation is.

530
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,720
Foxhound.

531
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,740
You'll have two mission objectives.

532
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,980
First, you're to rescue the DARPA chief, Donald Anderson.

533
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,400
The diaper chief!

534
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,180
And the president of Arms Tech, Kenneth Baker.

535
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,580
Kenneth!

536
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,420
They're both being held as hostages.

537
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,080
Kenneth!

538
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,740
Those are some heavy duty hostages.

539
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:02,340
Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike.

540
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,320
And stop them if they do.

541
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,500
I think they're bluffing.

542
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:05,980
Questions.

543
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,560
I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission.

544
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,420
Well, you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation.

545
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,000
He's like, gosh darn it, president, this isn't what you promised.

546
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,100
Yippee!

547
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,020
Oh, wow.

548
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,540
Well, we can't read it, but that's okay.

549
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,120
We'll just pretend.

550
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,900
Think about the nuclear weapon disposal facility.

551
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,220
The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base.

552
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,800
Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside.

553
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,000
So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back.

554
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,600
Sounds like a spy movie.

555
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,340
What's the insertion method?

556
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,580
Well, an air insertion is impossible.

557
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,680
Not with a storm going on.

558
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,740
We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.

559
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,960
Approach?

560
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,920
Yes, within a few miles of it.

561
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:02,960
Approach?

562
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:02,960
What?

563
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,820
Why is he so surprised?

564
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,080
How else are you going to get there?

565
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
You have to approach the place to get there, Snake.

566
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,460
And then?

567
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,040
We'll launch a one-man SDV.

568
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,880
Launch?

569
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,040
Woo!

570
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,820
Only this has no propulsion device of its own.

571
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,840
After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.

572
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,500
From there on, you'll have to swim.

573
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,100
You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?

574
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,560
I thought in the one...

575
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,140
That suit represents the latest advances in polythermal technology.

576
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,860
You could, like, move the camera in this angle.

577
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,660
I thought you could move it around, but it's not happening.

578
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,400
I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.

579
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,840
As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.

580
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,740
Weapons and equipment OSP?

581
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,240
OSP!

582
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,680
This is a top-secret black op.

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,700
Don't expect any official support.

584
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,820
There's so much...

585
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,440
technical speak.

586
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,680
Don't expect any support.

587
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,360
This is madness!

588
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,660
I can read that.

589
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,580
Wait!

590
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,000
We have a Taimurimito!

591
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,940
No way!

592
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,160
Uh-oh.

593
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,400
What's the time limit?

594
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,660
24 hours.

595
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,120
They say they'll launch after 24 hours.

596
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,520
It's too soon!

597
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,420
Do they say what the target will be?

598
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,880
So far, they haven't mentioned the target.

599
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,820
When did the countdown start?

600
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,660
Five hours ago.

601
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,000
So I have 19 hours!

602
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Oh my god.

603
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,640
Oh my god.

604
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,180
Now we're on two.

605
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,160
Roy Campbell.

606
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,720
Dr. Naomi.

607
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,520
Oh gosh.

608
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,940
I give up.

609
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,360
I can read them individually.

610
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,980
Almost not all of them.

611
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,920
But together, I don't know what the pronunciation...

612
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,940
the reading is at all.

613
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,500
Oh, I can read!

614
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,120
Camera free!

615
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,660
Here we go!

616
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,560
Colonel, who are you speaking for?

617
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,980
Naturally, I'm representing the U.S.

618
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,340
government.

619
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,160
Too low?

620
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,420
So who's in supervisory control of this operation?

621
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,560
The President of the United States.

622
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,940
Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?

623
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,860
No, at this point they're still videoconferencing with each other.

624
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,140
If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG?

625
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,000
Not yet.

626
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,620
The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation.

627
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,820
After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities, a COG will be issued.

628
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,340
Well, if they haven't relocated to the nuclear shelter under Mount Washington...

629
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,360
For free?

630
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360
Camera free?

631
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,720
Feet free?

632
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,480
I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet.

633
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,100
Why don't they give him any clothes?

634
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,100
Why is Snake not wearing clothes?

635
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,860
I don't know!

636
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,980
Did they capture him?

637
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,400
Did they, like, kidnap him while he was taking a bath?

638
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,520
I just don't understand.

639
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,740
We need desk jockeys.

640
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,820
We need a nuclear weapons specialist.

641
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,880
Of course.

642
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,420
A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us.

643
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,120
What is that?

644
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,220
What's conament?

645
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,860
No, he lives like that.

646
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,720
We need backup from a specialist.

647
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,380
Camera free!

648
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,780
I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons.

649
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,120
I know.

650
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,120
That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko.

651
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,060
Nastasha!

652
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,900
She'll be providing you backup by Kodak.

653
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,340
What?

654
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,980
A female analyst?

655
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,520
She's built up an impressive record as an advisor for the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

656
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,880
After losing her parents who participated in the cleanup at Chernobyl, she moved to the US.

657
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,140
I've been watching a lot of stuff about Chernobyl recently.

658
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
Where is she working from?

659
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,080
It's like one of those morbid curiosity sort of things.

660
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,220
California.

661
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,880
Seems like a million miles away.

662
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,860
Snake taking a bath.

663
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,000
FBI, open up!

664
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,640
Why?

665
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,520
About Chernobyl?

666
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,360
I don't know.

667
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,760
Just like I said, morbid curiosity.

668
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,260
Those things are sort of fascinating, right?

669
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,820
I don't know.

670
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,900
I don't know.

671
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,280
The HBO show is really good.

672
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,620
I think I watched like a little bit of it.

673
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,060
Minto, I know.

674
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,480
Little about MGS lore.

675
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:32,060
Never finished watching but I can assume that AI summary of the chat is an accurate source of the lore.

676
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,600
Honestly, I can never see what the AI is saying.

677
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,500
So I have no idea.

678
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,140
Oh my gosh, I can't wait for the AI summary and MGS2.

679
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,900
I'm just saying.

680
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,780
Thank you so much for the 50 gift.

681
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,320
Thank you.

682
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,860
But yeah, the AI summaries don't show up for me.

683
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,000
But they're always so funny.

684
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,060
I love it so much.

685
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,560
Roy Canberra.

686
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,280
Says you're zooming in on snakes' toes.

687
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:00,860
Colonel, you're retired.

688
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,920
Why are you involved in this?

689
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,260
Because there aren't many people who know Foxhound as well as I do.

690
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,940
Is that really the only reason?

691
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,920
I've been soldiering for a long time.

692
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,420
I don't know anything else.

693
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,840
I don't know anything else.

694
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,440
Even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field.

695
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,380
Colonel sounds so like...

696
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,880
Tell me the real reason.

697
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,080
Sometimes he sounds normal and then sometimes he sounds so like...

698
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,620
I'll be Frank.

699
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,000
Frank?

700
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,660
A person very dear to me is being held hostage.

701
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,740
Who is it?

702
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,900
My niece, Meryl.

703
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,120
Meryl.

704
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,580
You know I almost named my cat Meryl.

705
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
I was deciding between Meryl and pies.

706
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,080
Señor.

707
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
Thank you for the 10.

708
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,580
Gracias.

709
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:51,920
Meryl.

710
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
What was your niece doing here?

711
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,440
Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt.

712
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,380
Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt.

713
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:00,700
Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt.

714
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,380
And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement.

715
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,460
And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement.

716
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,020
Oh my gosh, she read you.

717
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,860
Go have fun.

718
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,380
She looks like you.

719
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,980
She's my little brother's girl.

720
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,100
He died in the Gulf War.

721
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,540
Since then I've been watching after her.

722
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,080
No real combat experience.

723
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,880
The psychotherapy!

724
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,460
I'm retired.

725
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm just an old man now.

726
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,660
And I'm your friend.

727
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,080
Since when are we friends?

728
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,360
I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar.

729
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,740
With my personality, I don't have too many friends.

730
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,760
That's what I trust about you.

731
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,600
It's what makes you human.

732
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,540
Please, Snake.

733
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,040
Save my niece, Meryl.

734
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,640
Dramatic zoom in.

735
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,720
Who's the cameraman here?

736
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,040
How's your cat doing?

737
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,540
No more secrets between us.

738
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,740
I want complete disclosure at all times.

739
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,860
And two, I'll only accept orders directly from you, Colonel.

740
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,560
No cut-offs involved, okay?

741
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,300
Yeah, I only trust you, Colonel.

742
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,780
Agreed.

743
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,560
That's why I was called.

744
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,580
But one thing.

745
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,400
What?

746
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,440
I'm not a Colonel anymore.

747
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,700
Just a retired old warhorse.

748
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,860
I understand.

749
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,320
Colonel.

750
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,300
What?

751
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,000
What?

752
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,400
It's so sweet.

753
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,820
It's so cute.

754
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,500
It's a good line.

755
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,380
It really is.

756
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,240
All right.

757
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,180
Dr. Naomi.

758
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,290
That doctor, is she part of this Operation 2?

759
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,010
She was in charge of Foxhound's gene therapy.

760
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,670
She knows more about those men than anyone else.

761
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,750
You mean you've seen them naked?

762
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,050
Make no mistake.

763
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,270
I'm not a nurse.

764
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,410
I'm a scientist.

765
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,310
Why is that the first thing you think though?

766
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,430
So you've seen them naked?

767
00:31:53,050 --> 00:32:00,750
It's a combination of nanomachines and anti-freezing peptides so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze even at sub-octic temperatures.

768
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,530
Nanomachines?

769
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,130
Not just one kind, either.

770
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:09,570
There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition, and sugar in your bloodstream.

771
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,910
Now I don't have to worry about food.

772
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,070
I wish I could get nanomachines for streaming.

773
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,970
Say what?

774
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,130
Say what?

775
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,910
A class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning.

776
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,130
Gosh, I really need these.

777
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,890
I need these for stream.

778
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:25,570
Benzedrine.

779
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,910
It's a type of stimulant.

780
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,910
It'll keep you alert and responsive for 12 straight hours.

781
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,650
Yippee!

782
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,970
I need these for stream!

783
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,470
Anything else in there?

784
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,330
Those nanomachines will also keep your codex batteries charged up.

785
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:37,690
Top of chat?

786
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,230
I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.

787
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,830
You're welcome.

788
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,410
Click it again and refresh chat.

789
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,570
We'll refresh the chat.

790
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,730
But I don't know if it works on the backend, is what I mean.

791
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,370
Yeah, it doesn't work in the backend.

792
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,530
Since I look at chat from, like, outside of the front spacing.

793
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,970
But thanks for trying.

794
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,570
Okay.

795
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,250
File 3!

796
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,810
Oh boy!

797
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,550
We got all the stuff about the terrorists!

798
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,470
Their demands...

799
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,810
The people...

800
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,350
The chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company.

801
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,590
What business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?

802
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,170
Oh, this one's about the hostages.

803
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,270
Oh my god, I remember that kanji now!

804
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,350
The secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked.

805
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,990
Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved.

806
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,550
Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?

807
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,490
I'm not privy to that information.

808
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,510
Do we know exactly where they're being held?

809
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,090
I need to find this.

810
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,830
Oh, Goh is not Jozu.

811
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,590
As you get closer, you should be able to pick up his location on your radar.

812
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:48,950
Oh yeah.

813
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,370
On our...

814
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,870
On our little radar.

815
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,370
Why do you know that?

816
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:03,070
It's so funny because when I studied in Japan recently, that was like one of the kanji that they... that was one of the words that we learned.

817
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:03,690
Like...

818
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,550
I was like, wow.

819
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,690
Cool.

820
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,430
Hostage!

821
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,130
You would think that I would already know that because of like...

822
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,430
Detective Conan or something.

823
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,070
Why have nanomachines when you can have gamersubs?

824
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,150
That was a 10% discount if you put in the code BOOMER!

825
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:24,930
Thank you.

826
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,330
Oh my gosh.

827
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,470
Shameless plug got though.

828
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,680
Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?

829
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,920
They say they do.

830
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,760
They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use.

831
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,460
Was the number confirmed?

832
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,360
I'm afraid so.

833
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,680
At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead.

834
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,220
Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this type of terrorism?

835
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,760
Camera change.

836
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Yes.

837
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,400
Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL which uses a discrete detonation code.

838
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,200
PAL.

839
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
Permissive action link.

840
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,400
The safety control system built into all nuclear weapon systems.

841
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,040
But even so, we can't rest easy.

842
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,380
Why not?

843
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,060
Because the DARPA chief knows the detonation code.

844
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,820
But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must have been removed from its missile.

845
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,480
All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled.

846
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,700
I can't imagine Snake always dying his hair.

847
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,720
That used to be true.

848
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,080
But since the end of the Cold War, you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections.

849
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,920
It looks blonde, but it can't be.

850
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,080
I think it's just the lighting and the safety.

851
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,840
Oh my gosh, wait.

852
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,040
I just noticed in the background.

853
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,860
You have Kenneth.

854
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,420
You have the diaper chief.

855
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,880
You have Big Boss down here.

856
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,120
Right next to right there.

857
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,900
But what is that next to him?

858
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,820
Who is that?

859
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,960
And then you have Foxhound and you have Liquid right there on the right.

860
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
Who is that next to Big Boss?

861
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,220
Hello, Boss.

862
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,700
Hello, Boss.

863
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,080
Why are you transparent now?

864
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,710
Transparent?

865
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,190
I am a ghost.

866
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,510
Maybe I'm running out of energy.

867
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,890
Like how Mint repeats back some of the lines as a half question.

868
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,370
Is it the genome soldiers next to him?

869
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,110
No, I don't...

870
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,750
I can't tell.

871
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,290
I can't tell.

872
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,140
He doesn't dye his hair.

873
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,640
It's just always full of mud.

874
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,100
Ew!

875
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,460
Ew!

876
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,840
No, Foxhound is right here.

877
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,080
On the right.

878
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,240
But I mean to the left of the Big Boss portrait.

879
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,020
I can't tell.

880
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,660
There's like two little people standing.

881
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,040
I can't tell what that is though.

882
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,200
Hmm.

883
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,500
Oh well.

884
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,400
It's just Foxhound members.

885
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,140
It's not anyone specific.

886
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,270
How well armed are these terrorists?

887
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,610
I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted.

888
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,310
They're heavily armed I'm afraid.

889
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,590
And they're heavily stupid.

890
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,090
The six members of Foxhound in charge are all hardened veterans.

891
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,310
They're tough enough to eat nails than ask for seconds.

892
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,170
I wouldn't expect anything less from Foxhound.

893
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,810
The others are next generation special forces.

894
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,170
They're not your average grunts either.

895
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:32,830
Oh my god.

896
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,150
They're special guys?

897
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,130
They have a really... Wait, don't tell me.

898
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,070
If he tells me that they have a really high IQ, I think...

899
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,890
we're in trouble.

900
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,550
I think we're in trouble if he tells us that they have a really high IQ.

901
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,030
So what exactly are they demanding?

902
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,410
A person's remains.

903
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,230
What?

904
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:53,810
Remains?

905
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,850
That's right.

906
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:01,110
To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information.

907
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,610
Cell specimens?

908
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,250
Why would they want that?

909
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,970
The terrorists need them.

910
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,210
You see these next generation special forces have been strengthened through gene therapy.

911
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,830
Strengthened?

912
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,050
You've heard of the human genome project.

913
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:15,970
Oh my god.

914
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,090
They've been mapping the human genome and they're nearly finished.

915
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,210
They're gonna create a whole person.

916
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:29,130
Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers.

917
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,690
There are genes that do that?

918
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,390
Yes.

919
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,950
And using gene therapy, they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers.

920
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,530
Gene therapy?

921
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,730
I'll explain this part.

922
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,250
With gene therapy we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease.

923
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:53,590
And at the same time splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example.

924
00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:01,410
In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired.

925
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,350
Okay.

926
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:08,450
And so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?

927
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,010
No, I love Naomi.

928
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:10,750
Yes, we could.

929
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,770
But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those soldier genes.

930
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,510
And in order to do that, it's helpful if you can study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever.

931
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,610
Ever!

932
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm so glad we get British Naomi back.

933
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:34,490
For people who don't know, in the Twin Snakes, which is kind of like a remake of this game, they took away her accent.

934
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,690
Levi or Wrangler?

935
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,470
Like jeans?

936
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,070
Oh!

937
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,750
It took me saying jeans?

938
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,730
Also, ViviCore, why did you change your profile picture?

939
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,000
Casual Naomi hater.

940
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,040
I can't recognize when you guys change your profile pictures, okay?

941
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,480
Jeans.

942
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,920
What kind?

943
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,280
Levi?

944
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,720
Tommy?

945
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,800
Oh, we got the Tommy jeans in here too.

946
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,800
Oh my gosh.

947
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,920
I got like the cutest...

948
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,680
Before I couldn't go outside in Japan, I got the cutest jeans set in Japan.

949
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
I'm so happy.

950
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,440
I like love wearing it out.

951
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,600
But I feel like...

952
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,940
I feel like a little too flashy when I wear it.

953
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,680
I don't know.

954
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,240
Jeans are like so popular.

955
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,880
They're the hit thing.

956
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,820
The in thing now.

957
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,340
I used to never own a pair of jeans.

958
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,540
Now I own jeans.

959
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,020
Oh my god.

960
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,920
The man they call the greatest warrior of the 20th century.

961
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,960
You don't mean Big Boss?

962
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,860
That's right.

963
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:47,320
We've been working feverishly to identify the jeans responsible for his incredible combat skill.

964
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,200
So far we've discovered about 60 of the so-called soldier jeans.

965
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,860
So his body was recovered after all.

966
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,600
Yes.

967
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,620
We set that guy on fire.

968
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,760
His cells have remained frozen in a cryo chamber.

969
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,280
Just like Disney.

970
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,560
His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind.

971
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,900
Priceless to the military perhaps.

972
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,400
His body was burned severely but it was possible to restore his DNA profile from just a single strand of his hair.

973
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,400
Do you think Big Boss's head would be in like one of those um...

974
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,340
Those little head containers like in Futurama?

975
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,440
The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience.

976
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,440
We now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers.

977
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,540
Snake.

978
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,920
We can't give them his body.

979
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,980
It's potentially more dangerous than all the nuclear warheads on that island put together.

980
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,440
I'm gonna get his body back.

981
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm gonna get his body back.

982
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,380
The sons of Big Boss.

983
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,180
Oh my god.

984
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,300
I just made a reference that nobody here will know at all.

985
00:41:50,460 --> 00:42:01,720
Okay so a lo- Okay so a long time ago I found this movie that was like a knock off of the Beverly Hills Chihuahua which I've never seen that movie before.

986
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:13,340
But the only reason I bought this movie was because the Chihuahua PNG that they used was the same on the front as the- like it was the same on the back as it was on the front just flipped.

987
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,420
For some reason that was so funny to me.

988
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,560
And in the trailer of the movie the girl- the lady is just like as a Chihuahua she's like I'm gonna get my body back.

989
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,000
And then she says it again but she's like I'm gonna get my body back.

990
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,780
So I would I would quote it a lot.

991
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,220
And when they were like they have to retrieve the body I'm like I'm gonna get my body back.

992
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:45,260
I'm gonna- I'm so sorry I made a reference that like literally only me and my like me and like a handful of friends would quote.

993
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm so sorry.

994
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,300
Thanks for the mint-splaining big boss.

995
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,020
Name of the movie please?

996
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,420
I can't remember it.

997
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,400
I can't remember it.

998
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,440
There was some Chihuahua movie though.

999
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,600
Not Fuwawa.

1000
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,680
Chihuahua.

1001
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,380
Obscure mint reference.

1002
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,220
Oh my gosh thank you for sharing your meme.

1003
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,760
Yes it is my meme.

1004
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,520
It wasn't Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

1005
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:33,040
It was one of- you know how like movies will make like a like a like a knock off version of like you know they'll make like a knock off animated version of Finding Nemo but it's not Finding Nemo.

1006
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,100
You know things like that.

1007
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,220
It was just a...

1008
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,740
Oh my gosh.

1009
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,880
If I find it.

1010
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,640
Beverly Hills Fuwawa.

1011
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,760
Chihuahua the movie.

1012
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,640
I think that's what it was.

1013
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,240
Chihuahua the movie.

1014
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,580
Yes.

1015
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,140
And the dog is so ugly.

1016
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,040
That they use on the cover.

1017
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,600
She's like I'm gonna get my body back.

1018
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm gonna get my body back.

1019
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,940
It's Chihuahua the movie.

1020
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,740
That's what it's called.

1021
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,220
Show us the PNG.

1022
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,040
Oh I can show you guys.

1023
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,440
You're right.

1024
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,820
Chihuahua the movie.

1025
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,240
Okay.

1026
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,860
Hold on.

1027
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,420
Sorry everybody.

1028
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,220
It has 3.9 out of 10 stars on IMDB.

1029
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,960
So this dog is- I'm sorry to this little- This Chihuahua has done nothing.

1030
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:22,860
Oh my bad.

1031
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,720
This Chihuahua has done nothing.

1032
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,580
But I think he just looks AI generated to me for some reason.

1033
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,060
But this is an older movie.

1034
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,500
It's not AI generated at all.

1035
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,900
It's back when Chihuahua movies were so popular so they made it.

1036
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,700
Okay so here's the cover.

1037
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,440
And then here's the- Oh it's so tiny.

1038
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,680
Here's the back.

1039
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,000
It's the same dog.

1040
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,180
Just flipped.

1041
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,600
But he just looks a little uncanny right?

1042
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,320
There's just something about him that just doesn't look right.

1043
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,620
I don't know what it is.

1044
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,140
But yeah.

1045
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,800
Hold on.

1046
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,940
Give me one second.

1047
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,600
Okay.

1048
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,580
Ugh.

1049
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,040
Anyway.

1050
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,820
Okay.

1051
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,600
Next thing.

1052
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,780
This dog's laying in eunuchs rigs.

1053
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,820
I found the refugee.

1054
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,720
Haha.

1055
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:37,620
Did I remember it correctly or did I just gaslight myself?

1056
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,220
It's a thinking she says it.

1057
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,300
Until they were added that is.

1058
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,040
They?

1059
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,080
Who's they?

1060
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,280
These guys didn't start out as regular army.

1061
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,760
Looks like a pretty international group.

1062
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,460
Mercenaries?

1063
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,240
Yeah.

1064
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,580
And it gets worse.

1065
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,920
Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with.

1066
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,540
Oh?

1067
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,240
They were part of Big Boss' private guard.

1068
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,940
Running Man!

1069
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,160
The military just bought out all their contracts.

1070
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,880
Running Man's back!

1071
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,060
After that they were merged with our own VR unit Force 21 and retrained.

1072
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:22,520
If you ask me these so-called next generation special forces should be called simulated soldiers.

1073
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,060
Oh.

1074
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,540
They have no real battle experience.

1075
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,760
Video game players, huh?

1076
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,140
Uh oh.

1077
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,580
Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy.

1078
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,800
They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers.

1079
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,060
They don't have a high IQ, right?

1080
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,840
Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience.

1081
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:37,900
Yeah.

1082
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,920
I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law.

1083
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:43,520
You would think.

1084
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,760
Yes, but those are just declarations, not actual treaties.

1085
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,480
Ooh.

1086
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,120
The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack.

1087
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,520
I will not make genetically modified soldiers.

1088
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,240
OK.

1089
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,240
Will you sign this treaty about it?

1090
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,260
No.

1091
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,500
I promise.

1092
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,020
That seems like a Maddie comic.

1093
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,000
Where it's just like you see the president.

1094
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,260
What's the president in this game?

1095
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,960
I can't remember.

1096
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,520
Oh my gosh.

1097
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,360
No.

1098
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,480
Of course I know what the president is in this game.

1099
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,180
I'm so silly.

1100
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,300
Will you see George Sears?

1101
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,520
No.

1102
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,920
And he's at a little convention.

1103
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,900
And they're just like, Will you make genetically modified soldiers?

1104
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,700
And he's like, no.

1105
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,560
But his fingers are crossed behind his back.

1106
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,440
And he's just like...

1107
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,540
I imagine the face...

1108
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,220
What's the face?

1109
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,620
What's that comic where the guy is standing outside the window?

1110
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,340
And he's like...

1111
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,940
Disgusting.

1112
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,680
I can see this in Maddie's style so clearly.

1113
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,300
I know, right?

1114
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,940
Yeah, the sickos.

1115
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,780
The sickos.

1116
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,980
I imagine like that kind of face he makes when he's just like...

1117
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,240
I've got my fingers crossed.

1118
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,940
Something, something, something.

1119
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,700
No to you.

1120
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,980
Zen means something, something, something.

1121
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,300
How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?

1122
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,500
They're calling it a revolution.

1123
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,280
Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers.

1124
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,900
They see the unit as their only family.

1125
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,320
The sons of big boss.

1126
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,820
Genetically engineered idol girls.

1127
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,860
But if they were regular army, they must have been interviewed periodically by army counselors.

1128
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,100
According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests.

1129
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,760
They all seemed like fine, upstanding, patriotic soldiers.

1130
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,780
But they all took part in the uprising?

1131
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:44,600
No.

1132
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,700
Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise.

1133
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,420
That's why there was a resupply of troops.

1134
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,580
Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?

1135
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,140
There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely.

1136
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,140
Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments.

1137
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,380
They can do that even without you?

1138
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,300
Well, our gene therapy process is almost complete.

1139
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,540
You're not needed here, Naomi.

1140
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,140
Get out.

1141
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,040
180?

1142
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,280
Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order.

1143
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,340
I think we're in trouble.

1144
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,000
We need to investigate this thing quietly and deal with it behind closed doors.

1145
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,020
I think we're in trouble.

1146
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,340
180 IQ!

1147
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,940
Alright, Foxhound.

1148
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,080
And I think we have just a few more after this.

1149
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,360
Sorry, I know these take so long, but there's...

1150
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,520
High tech special forces unit, Foxhound.

1151
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,240
Foxhound!

1152
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
Your former unit.

1153
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,500
And one that I was a commander of.

1154
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,920
What's your IQ, man?

1155
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,280
I have no idea.

1156
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,240
I don't think ghosts have an IQ.

1157
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,600
They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them.

1158
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,840
So they're still around.

1159
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,040
There are six members of Foxhound involved in this terrorist activity.

1160
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,140
Psycho Mantis.

1161
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,240
With his powerful psychic abilities.

1162
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,000
Sniper Wolf.

1163
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,800
A beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

1164
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,440
She is beautiful.

1165
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,840
Decoy Octopus.

1166
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,340
Master of disguise.

1167
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,400
Vulcan Raven.

1168
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,380
Giant and Shaman.

1169
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,660
And Revolver Ocelot.

1170
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,440
Yes!

1171
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,360
Specialist in interrogation.

1172
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,240
And a formidable gun fighter.

1173
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,280
Looks like a lovely bunch of folks.

1174
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,120
That's the team!

1175
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,720
Giant and Shaman.

1176
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,400
Liquid Snake.

1177
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,840
Liquid Snake?

1178
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,160
Yes.

1179
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,760
And you're the only person who can stand against him.

1180
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,560
Because I'm Solid Snake.

1181
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,560
Liquid Snake.

1182
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,140
Liquid Snake!

1183
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,580
Snake got nothing but questions.

1184
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,180
Liquid Snake.

1185
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,620
Liquid Snake.

1186
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,760
Liquid Snake.

1187
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,660
We should all say Liquid Snake.

1188
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,340
Liquid Snake.

1189
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:06,460
Look at that smug mug.

1190
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,420
Fresh!

1191
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:09,440
USA.

1192
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,300
When the USA moved to England upon birth.

1193
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,160
You were there too, I believe.

1194
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,060
He's part of the Special Force?

1195
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,080
Sacks!

1196
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,900
Because that guy sacks indeed.

1197
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:27,700
The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS.

1198
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,900
The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS.

1199
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,420
Seven languages!

1200
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,780
He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service.

1201
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,340
But he never once showed his face in Century House.

1202
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,320
But he never once showed his face in Century House.

1203
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,000
He was taken prisoner in Iraq.

1204
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,100
And after that, there was no trace of him.

1205
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,060
Ooooooh.

1206
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,780
A little bit.

1207
00:51:46,320 --> 00:52:01,560
I wonder what his name could be.

1208
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,040
Don't say it guys, don't say it.

1209
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,340
The White Mamba.

1210
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,220
I have a twin?

1211
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,060
I don't know the details.

1212
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,580
But it seems so.

1213
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,900
That's why we really need you for this mission.

1214
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,200
I have a twin?

1215
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,840
You're the only one who can beat him.

1216
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,860
Now that I've met you, I know.

1217
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,440
You've got something that he doesn't.

1218
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,260
I can see it in your eyes.

1219
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,980
Why don't I find that thought more comforting?

1220
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,820
What do I have?

1221
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,200
She speaks in riddles.

1222
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,200
A nice butt, yeah.

1223
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,200
She speaks in riddles.

1224
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,500
What do I have, Naomi?

1225
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,340
What do I have?

1226
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,520
He's got them crazy eyes.

1227
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,380
He's so talented.

1228
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,840
He can give himself a haircut and everything.

1229
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,060
I only cut my bangs.

1230
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,120
That's why they're a little crooked.

1231
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,420
I only cut my bangs.

1232
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,900
I only cut my bangs.

1233
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,360
But they always end up crooked.

1234
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,700
I just can't get it right.

1235
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,380
I just can't get it right.

1236
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,860
I'm gonna wait it out so we can see the opening.

1237
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,160
I'm gonna wait it out so we can see the opening.

1238
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,680
Wait, the opening scene is the same...

1239
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,580
Is it the same?

1240
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,500
I can't remember actually.

1241
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:56,990
Is it the same?

1242
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:57,270
Is it the same?

1243
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,210
Okay, we'll just do the game then.

1244
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,190
And yes, I will be playing on normal difficulty.

1245
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,830
And yes, I will be playing on normal difficulty.

1246
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:05,930
Radar off.

1247
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:09,990
Nihongo.

1248
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:11,970
Why does it say Nihongo?

1249
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:12,890
I can't read the...

1250
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:17,450
It's also so hard to read kanji, I think.

1251
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:24,170
I would never recommend someone to learn kanji from an old video game.

1252
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,570
Because it's just all blurry.

1253
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,970
It looks like I'm looking at kanji when I need glasses.

1254
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,870
It's so crunchy.

1255
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:32,810
Not crunchy.

1256
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,050
It's the opposite of crunchy.

1257
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:37,290
But yeah, we're gonna just be playing on normal.

1258
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,170
So...

1259
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:39,870
I can't...

1260
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,030
I can't...

1261
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,630
Something...

1262
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,610
Nihongo not Jojo, okay?

1263
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:50,750
Nihongo not Jojo, okay?

1264
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,270
MP5?

1265
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:52,890
No!

1266
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,550
We're not gonna play on so easy though!

1267
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,230
Come on!

1268
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,170
David Hayter!

1269
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,050
If he didn't cut his hair, he would have easily fooled everyone that he was Liquid Snake and reversed everything.

1270
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:05,930
The Terrorist died.

1271
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:06,970
I know, right?

1272
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:17,700
But...

1273
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:34,940
But...

1274
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,540
Some flies!

1275
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,480
But

1276
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:46,930
I do know some of the names.

1277
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,190
I do recognize some of them sometimes.

1278
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,090
Like, Doug Stone is the voice of, uh...

1279
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:53,930
Psycho Mantis.

1280
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,220
Thanks for the super chat, you guys!

1281
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,820
Thank you!

1282
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:18,680
Okay!

1283
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,380
If you need to, contact me by codec.

1284
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,980
The frequency is 140.85.

1285
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,520
When you want to use the codec, push the select button.

1286
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,920
When we need to contact you, the codec will beep.

1287
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,220
When you hear that noise, press the select button.

1288
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,760
The codec's receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear.

1289
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,480
It tickles!

1290
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,300
No one but you will be able to hear it.

1291
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,120
Got it.

1292
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay.

1293
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,120
I'm ready to go.

1294
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,500
Hold on, I'll have to remember which one to press.

1295
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,380
Okay, so it's this one.

1296
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,320
And then this one is the pause.

1297
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:56,860
Okay, good.

1298
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,080
Okay.

1299
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:11,970
Punch!

1300
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,070
Punch, punch!

1301
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:13,590
Punch, punch, punch!

1302
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,950
I mean, punch, punch!

1303
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:16,550
Grab, grab!

1304
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:17,170
Grab, grab, grab!

1305
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,850
Grab, grab, grab!

1306
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:18,970
Punch, punch!

1307
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:19,570
Punch, punch, punch!

1308
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,330
Punch, punch, punch!

1309
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:21,910
First person!

1310
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,120
I'm going to...

1311
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,520
What's that sound anyway?

1312
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,340
No one will see me.

1313
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,880
Not even the rats.

1314
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,420
Where's the guy?

1315
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,140
Where is everybody?

1316
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,240
Hello?

1317
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,000
Where is everybody?

1318
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,540
Oh, there they are.

1319
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,220
I'm like, hello?

1320
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,760
Oh.

1321
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,740
They're coming.

1322
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,120
They're converging.

1323
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,780
Like, he can't see me from here, right?

1324
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,340
I can't remember.

1325
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,220
No.

1326
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,120
I think we're safe.

1327
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:07,600
Okay.

1328
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,860
And does he turn around here?

1329
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,060
I can't remember.

1330
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,280
Don't turn around.

1331
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:13,540
Oh.

1332
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,680
Don't see me!

1333
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,600
Okay.

1334
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,180
We're good.

1335
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,360
Enjoy all the killing!

1336
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,260
I...

1337
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,020
I enjoy it!

1338
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,480
I enjoy it!

1339
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:35,900
I enjoy it!

1340
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,140
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!

1341
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,820
Delicious killing!

1342
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,000
Murder, murder, mur...

1343
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,640
I don't want him to hear me.

1344
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:46,980
Which way does he go?

1345
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,440
Go up, right?

1346
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,140
I want the other ration over here.

1347
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,400
We're just going to collect all these rations real quick.

1348
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:54,600
Oh.

1349
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,120
Just kidding.

1350
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:55,860
Oh.

1351
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,420
There we go.

1352
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,140
I enjoy all the killing!

1353
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,000
Murder me thanks for the 50 gift...

1354
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,200
Oh.

1355
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,800
A little... 50 gifted things.

1356
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,100
Yeah.

1357
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,020
Maybe I'll kill this guy too.

1358
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,800
Oh shit!

1359
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,460
Oh.

1360
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:13,700
Oh!

1361
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,500
So

1362
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,780
much for my no alerts run.

1363
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,600
Which I never was going to do anyway, so it's fine!

1364
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,440
Return your possessions, everybody.

1365
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,420
There's nothing wrong here.

1366
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,100
There's...

1367
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,120
nothing wrong here.

1368
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:42,740
Please.

1369
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,880
Time to restart.

1370
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:46,660
No.

1371
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:47,240
God.

1372
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,620
Please.

1373
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,380
Where does a guy go from?

1374
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:50,920
I can't...

1375
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,200
Oh.

1376
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:52,560
There he is.

1377
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,220
We'll just go from the other side then.

1378
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:00,950
Oh.

1379
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,350
It's so good hearing the original soundtrack.

1380
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:04,470
It's so good.

1381
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:10,790
Yeah.

1382
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,470
That's right.

1383
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:12,810
Go away.

1384
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,730
Oh.

1385
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:14,290
Just...

1386
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,490
What was that?

1387
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,490
Nothing.

1388
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:17,050
No one.

1389
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:18,990
Actually good.

1390
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,510
We'll distract him a little bit and then we'll...

1391
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:24,530
Oh.

1392
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,410
Come on!

1393
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:26,610
Go away!

1394
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,090
Go away.

1395
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,090
Go away mister.

1396
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,330
Please.

1397
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:30,890
Hold on.

1398
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,230
Okay.

1399
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,590
There we go.

1400
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:31,950
There we go.

1401
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:32,750
Oh.

1402
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:34,910
Come on.

1403
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:35,810
You bitch!

1404
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:36,950
You bitch!

1405
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:37,910
Hold on.

1406
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,210
Let me...

1407
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,630
How do I knock again?

1408
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,990
Which way does he come?

1409
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:47,650
Okay.

1410
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,870
This way.

1411
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:53,820
Yippee!

1412
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,320
Showing off that 180 IQ.

1413
01:00:59,400 --> 01:00:59,820
Huh?

1414
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,720
What was that noise?

1415
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,820
Huh?

1416
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,560
What was that noise?

1417
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:04,960
Huh?

1418
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,900
Oh my gosh.

1419
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:09,460
Oh my gosh.

1420
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,120
Yoshi Shikawa!

1421
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,300
Oh my gosh.

1422
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:12,780
Oh my gosh.

1423
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,660
Oh my gosh.

1424
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,280
Here he comes.

1425
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,870
I love this...

1426
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:24,950
sequence.

1427
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,360
It's him!

1428
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,220
That's my guy!

1429
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,720
And the controller like vibrates in that part.

1430
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,580
It's so awesome.

1431
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,880
Yeah!

1432
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,760
Oh my gosh.

1433
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,240
Oh my gosh.

1434
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,140
So cool.

1435
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,440
Shadow Moses!

1436
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,340
It's me doll!

1437
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,350
It's me doll!

1438
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:24,830
So crunchy.

1439
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,270
So crunchy.

1440
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:32,330
It's Snake.

1441
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,170
I'm in front of the disposal facility.

1442
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,970
Excellent Snake.

1443
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,590
Snake, age hasn't slowed you down one bit.

1444
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,030
How's that sneaking suit working out?

1445
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:41,570
That's great.

1446
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,370
I'm nice and dry, but it's a little hard to move.

1447
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,330
Bear with it.

1448
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,430
It's designed to prevent hypothermia.

1449
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,490
This is Alaska, you know.

1450
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,330
Take it easy.

1451
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:49,610
I'm grateful.

1452
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,590
I think snakes belong in Alaska.

1453
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:53,730
If it weren't for your suit and your shot, I would have turned into a popsicle out there.

1454
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,090
An anti-freezing peptide snake.

1455
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:56,690
Ooh.

1456
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,330
Oh my gosh.

1457
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,310
I shouldn't have had coffee.

1458
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,330
I'm starting to shake a lot.

1459
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,150
I'm relieved to hear that.

1460
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,370
Already tested, huh?

1461
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:02,990
Um, no.

1462
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,030
By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?

1463
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:09,070
Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

1464
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,150
Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

1465
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:10,730
Should be getting my eyes fixed soon though.

1466
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:11,650
Should be getting my eyes fixed soon though.

1467
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,430
That's so awesome for you!

1468
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:17,130
Though, I will miss the eyepatch even though I've never seen your face before.

1469
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:20,450
Though, I will miss the eyepatch even though I've never seen your face before.

1470
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,830
What's a Russian gunship doing here?

1471
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,290
What's a Russian gunship doing here?

1472
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,430
I have no idea.

1473
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,010
Oh my god, Snake!

1474
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,310
I can't believe we had the same thought!

1475
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,310
That's so crazy!

1476
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,320
Twinsies!

1477
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:55,900
It's so funny because I was in VR chat like, I think, not yesterday, the day before yesterday, and there's a recreation of this area too.

1478
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:05,380
Because I was testing out some stuff and there's a recreation of this area and I was like, weeeeee!

1479
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,420
I think...

1480
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,800
I'll wait until it works.

1481
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:11,400
Done with the codex.

1482
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,380
You must be crazy to fly behind in this kind of weather.

1483
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:14,900
Oh my god.

1484
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,700
What a cute voice.

1485
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,160
I haven't introduced you two yet.

1486
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,640
This is Mei Ling.

1487
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,240
She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.

1488
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:24,540
That's good!

1489
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,320
She designed your codec as well as your soliton radar system.

1490
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,520
Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.

1491
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,000
Nice to meet you, Snake.

1492
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,520
It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.

1493
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,040
Silence.

1494
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:40,680
What's wrong?

1495
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:41,780
Nothing.

1496
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:47,060
I just didn't expect a world class designer of military technology to be so cute.

1497
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,600
You're just flattering me.

1498
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,740
No, I'm serious.

1499
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,640
Here comes one of my favorite lines.

1500
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,080
I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.

1501
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,040
Come on.

1502
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,800
I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake.

1503
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,320
This one!

1504
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,480
You're very frank for a trained killer.

1505
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,440
Frank!

1506
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,660
Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.

1507
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,420
He's so smooth.

1508
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,160
Oh my god.

1509
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,140
Oh my god, he's so smooth.

1510
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,480
W Riz.

1511
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,820
The bright dot in the middle is you, Snake.

1512
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,160
Me!

1513
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,840
The red dots are your enemies.

1514
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,880
And the blue corn shirt represents their field of vision.

1515
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:24,680
They can't see me.

1516
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,680
Be careful, Snake.

1517
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,980
The genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.

1518
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,780
Frank's the colonel, though.

1519
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:31,920
I'll be frank.

1520
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,420
Be sure you don't let them see you.

1521
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:38,180
First, I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA chief.

1522
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:38,760
Okay.

1523
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:43,020
The DARPA chief was injected with the same GPS-transmitting nanomachines as you.

1524
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,980
He should appear on your radar as a green dot.

1525
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,200
Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.

1526
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,980
If he's alive, that is.

1527
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:52,960
Nah, he's fine.

1528
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,900
I believe, I believe, I believe.

1529
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,020
Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather.

1530
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,240
But if you're discovered by an enemy, you won't be able to use it.

1531
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,260
I think that's a flawed design.

1532
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,140
Yes, it gets jammed easily, I'm afraid.

1533
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,400
Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.

1534
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,600
You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.

1535
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,800
So be careful.

1536
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,360
We'll be monitoring your movements by radar.

1537
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,980
So contact us by codec anytime you want.

1538
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,220
Got it.

1539
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,780
I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.

1540
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,320
Technology in Phantophane is so advanced.

1541
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,960
We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice.

1542
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,240
Okay.

1543
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,600
I'm also in charge of your mission data.

1544
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,620
Contact me if you want me to record your current status.

1545
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:35,600
My frequency is 140.96.

1546
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:36,300
Okay.

1547
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,360
It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.

1548
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:39,880
Don't forget it.

1549
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,960
Oh, I won't forget it, but...

1550
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,120
Remember, except for your binoculars, you're naked.

1551
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:44,760
I'm naked!

1552
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,300
You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.

1553
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:47,700
Okay.

1554
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,320
I remember.

1555
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,920
First I'm strip searched by Dr. Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.

1556
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,880
Imagine yourself put in that position.

1557
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:58,580
Well, if you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do it.

1558
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,660
And then you can strip search on me.

1559
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,600
I'll hold you to that, doctor.

1560
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,440
By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.

1561
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,300
Oh my god, this is my favorite part.

1562
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,280
How did you do that?

1563
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,480
In my stomach.

1564
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:11,620
Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids.

1565
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:12,980
Cigarettes?

1566
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,900
How are those going to help you?

1567
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,220
You never know.

1568
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,980
This guy just ate his cigarettes.

1569
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:24,540
This guy is insane.

1570
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,440
If you want to get in.

1571
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,100
Yeah?

1572
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:29,900
Let's go.

1573
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,740
There is the front door.

1574
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,260
It's the fastest way.

1575
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,840
But there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy.

1576
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,700
We're just going to open it up.

1577
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,940
I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.

1578
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:38,320
Why not?

1579
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,500
There's one sentry on the left, no one on the right.

1580
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,560
Why don't we steal their uniforms?

1581
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,100
They're armed with five five sixers and pineapples.

1582
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,760
I love pineapple.

1583
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,220
One, two.

1584
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,760
One, two, three.

1585
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:52,720
No.

1586
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,420
What about the air duct near the door?

1587
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,120
That's my favorite way to get in.

1588
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,060
There should also be a duct on the second floor.

1589
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:03,780
Yes.

1590
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,740
But that requires like going up stairs and...

1591
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,180
I can't see it from here.

1592
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,060
Look at him go.

1593
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,220
He's got that nerd walk.

1594
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,320
I'll let you decide the best COA.

1595
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,880
Pushes out cigarettes like a pez candy dispenser.

1596
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,480
I'm counting on you snake.

1597
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:23,960
Okay.

1598
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:24,520
I'm going to get in.

1599
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,120
Alrighty.

1600
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,220
We're in the game.

1601
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:27,940
We're in the game.

1602
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,920
So yeah, like as you can see.

1603
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:33,720
Everything.

1604
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,700
The descriptions are in Japanese.

1605
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,980
But like I said.

1606
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,940
We know what things do.

1607
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,500
So I think we'll be okay for the most part.

1608
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,520
And uh.

1609
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:45,740
Yeah.

1610
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,400
So let's see.

1611
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,300
There's a guy that like walks around down here.

1612
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,260
How do I zoom in?

1613
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:52,920
Oh.

1614
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:54,760
Oh.

1615
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:55,840
Wait.

1616
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,560
Why isn't it...

1617
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,560
Oh okay.

1618
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,200
There we go.

1619
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,180
This is the quick equip and unequip.

1620
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,020
I remember now.

1621
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,260
Why are they JP?

1622
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,540
Because this is integral.

1623
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,160
Which was only released in Japan.

1624
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:11,800
But.

1625
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,080
Um.

1626
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,580
Where is this guy?

1627
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,540
But um.

1628
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,820
For some reason they kept all the dub voices.

1629
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,320
So.

1630
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:24,600
It works.

1631
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,420
Don't look this way.

1632
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,580
That looks like a trap.

1633
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:33,300
Actually.

1634
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,660
That's a trap.

1635
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,620
I know it's possible.

1636
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,640
To get it.

1637
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,660
But it still scares me.

1638
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,320
I think I can kill this guy.

1639
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:44,840
Come on.

1640
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,500
I'm sleepy.

1641
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,780
Turn around you son of a bitch.

1642
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:56,920
Oh my god.

1643
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,220
Not yet.

1644
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:02,560
Gosh.

1645
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,600
Don't scream like that.

1646
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,200
You scare me.

1647
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,240
We're okay.

1648
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,550
What was the super chat?

1649
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,450
Turn around.

1650
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,710
Normie take on how the sigs were smuggled in and out.

1651
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:24,870
Put them in a ziplock bag.

1652
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:25,670
Swallow them.

1653
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,190
Punch his own stomach.

1654
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:30,390
Or run stomach into some blunt corner of a hard surface to puke them back up.

1655
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,970
How do you know he puked them?

1656
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:36,730
That's all I'm gonna say.

1657
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:38,650
Return to your positions.

1658
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:40,070
Dummies.

1659
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:40,610
Wait.

1660
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,170
It didn't summon a new guy, right?

1661
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,470
He's still gone?

1662
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,130
There's also the security camera though.

1663
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,030
That we have to be careful of.

1664
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:52,570
Did I get hit?

1665
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,670
My life!

1666
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,990
Well, might as well use it.

1667
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,790
Wait, how do I use it?

1668
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:03,650
B.

1669
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:05,710
I pressed B.

1670
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,570
Maybe here?

1671
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:07,230
Oh, there we go.

1672
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:11,500
Nice.

1673
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:13,860
Nice.

1674
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,400
Maybe looking through here is easier then.

1675
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,420
Let's go get our...

1676
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,080
Let's go get the weapon.

1677
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,920
I like how we're just chilling up here.

1678
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:31,600
Oh my god.

1679
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,700
Run, run, run, run, run.

1680
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:33,740
Don't be seen.

1681
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,320
Don't be seen.

1682
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,180
Hello?

1683
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,400
Oh, he's coming?

1684
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:43,960
He doesn't see me.

1685
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,980
Sometimes their vision is like so good.

1686
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,780
And sometimes so bad.

1687
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,760
I don't understand.

1688
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,680
He turns to the left, right?

1689
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:53,740
Yup.

1690
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,450
Yay!

1691
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,450
The Shokan!

1692
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:03,190
Yay!

1693
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:03,190
The Shokan!

1694
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,350
So far you're two for two on being seen.

1695
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,070
Hi, hi, hi!

1696
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:11,990
Hi, hi, hi!

1697
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:15,590
Also, isn't he supposed to be asleep in front of that camera?

1698
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:16,870
What are you doing walking around?

1699
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:19,110
You busy guy?

1700
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,490
You're so busy or something?

1701
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,290
Oh my goodness.

1702
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,150
Aren't you supposed to be asleep?

1703
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:30,710
Over there!

1704
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:32,690
Am I crazy?

1705
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,030
Go to bed!

1706
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:38,890
Different guy.

1707
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,650
I wonder if I can grab him.

1708
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,160
He's gonna turn around though, right?

1709
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,160
He's gonna turn this way?

1710
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,160
No he doesn't.

1711
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:53,940
Interesting.

1712
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,600
But then he turns around.

1713
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,240
When does he turn around?

1714
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,060
When does he turn around?

1715
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,760
I wanna get the little cutscene where he goes to surveillance camera.

1716
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,740
You know?

1717
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,240
Oh my god.

1718
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,000
Oh my god.

1719
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,340
Oh my god.

1720
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,180
So close.

1721
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:12,760
Wee!

1722
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,160
Wee!

1723
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,060
Not playing on the mint mod?

1724
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,220
It's not quite ready yet.

1725
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,700
Oh yeah, I meant to say that before.

1726
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,420
I was told it's not quite ready yet.

1727
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,120
But once it is, we will play on it.

1728
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,560
No worries.

1729
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,300
It's over here, right?

1730
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,560
Surveillance camera.

1731
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,560
Oh my god.

1732
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,600
I don't wanna get caught though.

1733
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,240
Surveillance camera?

1734
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,020
Surveillance camera?

1735
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,660
Surveillance camera?

1736
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,880
Why would they need that?

1737
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,840
What are they trying to be sneaky or something?

1738
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,140
Oh my god.

1739
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:51,840
Oh my god.

1740
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,480
Go away.

1741
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,480
Go away.

1742
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:04,980
Turn around.

1743
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:06,680
Yeah, that's right.

1744
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:07,900
Oh my god.

1745
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,240
Why can't you be asleep?

1746
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,370
I'm not gonna get caught, am I?

1747
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:34,480
We're fine.

1748
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,140
Does this way have anything?

1749
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:47,360
How are you supposed to not get caught there?

1750
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,360
I truly do wonder.

1751
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,020
Yeah, we'll follow the rats.

1752
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,120
I wanted to get this first though.

1753
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,860
Oh, that's right.

1754
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,460
We're full.

1755
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,440
Okay, never mind.

1756
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:00,960
We're gonna go full.

1757
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,280
With a chaff grenade?

1758
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,040
But I don't have that.

1759
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:11,400
Like, I know you can't shoot out the cameras in this game, right?

1760
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,820
For a ghost, you're bad at being invisible?

1761
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:14,560
What?

1762
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,720
It's because I'm so comfortable.

1763
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,900
I'm so used to being invisible as a ghost.

1764
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,300
I'm not so used to being invisible as a human.

1765
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:22,960
You know what I mean?

1766
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:29,020
Master Miller!

1767
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,060
What are you doing here?

1768
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,000
I quit being a drill instructor.

1769
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,700
So I moved out here for some peace and quiet.

1770
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,180
I'm in retirement just like you.

1771
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,280
Once in a while, I still help train the Alaskan scouts.

1772
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,840
Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?

1773
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:45,960
I love Master Miller!

1774
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,420
Campbell told me about the situation here.

1775
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,920
This guy makes a mean hamburger.

1776
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:50,440
I thought I might be of some use.

1777
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,460
There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.

1778
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:54,220
There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.

1779
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,680
Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.

1780
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,140
I've lived in Alaska longer than you.

1781
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:00,380
I've lived in Alaska longer than you.

1782
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,980
So call me if you have any questions about the Alaskans.

1783
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,640
I'm gonna call you all the time.

1784
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,480
My frequency is 141.80.

1785
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,660
I should probably like...

1786
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,220
Okay, hold on.

1787
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,260
Those mice are Alaskan field mice.

1788
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,220
Don't worry.

1789
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,600
They can't hurt you.

1790
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,200
Wild field mice don't have a thick layer of fat.

1791
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,020
But they can still survive the bitter winters here without hibernating.

1792
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:21,380
That's crazy.

1793
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,160
They dig tunnels under the snow.

1794
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,920
That's where they stay warm.

1795
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,580
Survival specialists, huh?

1796
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,160
How do they taste?

1797
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,260
I should learn from them.

1798
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,160
But there's a dark side too.

1799
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,860
They eat the soil and eat offspring that's not their own.

1800
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,460
To ensure the survival of their own genes, right?

1801
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,180
Yeah.

1802
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,280
Pretty brilliant program, huh?

1803
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,000
If there are mice, that means there must be an exit somewhere.

1804
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,640
Follow the mice.

1805
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Follow the mice.

1806
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,800
Befriend the mice.

1807
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,280
Okay.

1808
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,080
There we go.

1809
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,000
Sorry.

1810
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,820
The Soliton radar won't work in a narrow space.

1811
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:58,400
That's okay.

1812
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,200
Too much harmonic resonance.

1813
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,140
The radio waves produce interference.

1814
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,880
And we can't analyze the topographic data.

1815
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,860
You're doing amazing, Mary.

1816
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,420
Try to hang on until you get to a more open space, okay?

1817
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:08,960
Okay.

1818
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,020
Love you.

1819
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:15,540
Yay.

1820
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,600
Don't give up, Snake.

1821
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:23,390
Sorry.

1822
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:24,710
The Soliton radar...

1823
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:25,750
Oh, she's just gonna keep saying this.

1824
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:33,630
We'll do the save thing once we're out of the hole.

1825
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,330
Those mice are Alaskan field mice.

1826
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:40,350
Don't worry.

1827
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,650
They can't hurt you.

1828
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:46,050
I just needed reassurance, okay?

1829
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,690
I just needed the reassurance.

1830
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,440
We're fine.

1831
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,680
We're still...

1832
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,920
This feels like Tokyo Jungle.

1833
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,800
Why does the vent have so much water in it?

1834
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,400
This place is...

1835
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,180
I honestly couldn't tell you.

1836
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,340
He's right here.

1837
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:38,970
Stop being so shocked by me.

1838
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,090
I'm trying to befriend you.

1839
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,110
I have snacks.

1840
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:42,570
Don't you want a ration?

1841
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:44,710
They're like, don't feed us that nastiness.

1842
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,530
Look at them go.

1843
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:54,310
We'll wait for him to circle around again.

1844
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,710
We gotta go find a diaper chief.

1845
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:00,550
Gross ration.

1846
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,870
Is ration basically like an MRE?

1847
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:06,990
There he is.

1848
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:13,900
Yeah?

1849
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:14,420
Okay.

1850
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,400
Thanks for the super chat.

1851
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,520
Hold on one second.

1852
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,440
I'm gonna do this real quick.

1853
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:29,760
I'm gonna actually pin a message that says, Please no spoilers in chat Not for me but for anyone who's new to the series.

1854
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:39,860
We want to have this be safe place for all watchers.

1855
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:40,900
Thank you!

1856
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,260
There we go.

1857
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,480
And I'll just pin that.

1858
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:45,720
Instead.

1859
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,880
Snake dies... with me playing it?

1860
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,160
Probably.

1861
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,860
If I'm the one in control?

1862
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,000
Most likely.

1863
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,780
MRE is a specific type of ration.

1864
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,680
Here he comes.

1865
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,880
I forgot there's two of them here.

1866
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,520
And then he stops.

1867
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,740
When he stops there, does he look this way?

1868
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,220
I can't remember.

1869
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,680
Or bring back the smiley?

1870
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,440
Oh yeah!

1871
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,120
Meals ready to eat.

1872
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,460
Oh!

1873
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,460
I wish I could see him.

1874
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,520
There he is.

1875
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:31,660
Okay.

1876
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,120
Oh my gosh, that was close, I think.

1877
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,160
Oh my god.

1878
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,500
The tank area music is just so good.

1879
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,740
Dun dun.

1880
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,930
Oh, hello?

1881
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:54,230
Thanks,

1882
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:00,190
Colonel!

1883
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:04,050
There's a maid that kills... a snake... a few times.

1884
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:17,950
Uh, wait, what's the button?

1885
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:19,970
Oh, there we go.

1886
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:20,330
Ooh!

1887
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,890
I think I see him.

1888
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,950
That little squiggly.

1889
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:37,970
Oh my gosh.

1890
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,770
He's really freaking out in there.

1891
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:40,610
He's like...

1892
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:44,910
It's Missingno!

1893
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,330
The DARPA chief has turned into Missingno!

1894
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:50,750
Look at the radar.

1895
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:52,510
It's picking up the DARPA chief.

1896
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:53,910
He's the green dot.

1897
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,450
Hurry and rescue him!

1898
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:56,070
Oh my god!

1899
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:57,770
We gotta hurry!

1900
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,230
We gotta get that guy.

1901
01:21:59,230 --> 01:21:59,990
Boop boop.

1902
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:01,990
Boop boop.

1903
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:02,770
Boop boop.

1904
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,430
Dun dun.

1905
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:07,590
Nothing here.

1906
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:15,950
I hate how much this game has literally changed my... it has rewired my brain.

1907
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,590
Press the action button.

1908
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,950
Like, I can't say nothing here normally anymore.

1909
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:24,570
I have to go...

1910
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:25,790
Nothing here.

1911
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,910
Just because of Metal Gear Solid 2.

1912
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,130
It's so insane.

1913
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:30,490
I just can't.

1914
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,930
I can't live normally anymore, you guys.

1915
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,730
It's a problem.

1916
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:37,950
Wait, do I... do I need the rations?

1917
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:42,050
I'm so used to hoarding rations because I always need them.

1918
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,170
But I think we're fine for now.

1919
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,590
I thought the action button was always triangle.

1920
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:47,450
Am I crazy?

1921
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,710
That's why I was like... wait.

1922
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:53,310
Because that's how I got into the car, right?

1923
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,530
I don't know.

1924
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:58,810
You're crazy.

1925
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,270
No, it's... I'm pressing circle.

1926
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:06,670
I thought it was triangle.

1927
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,550
Japanese... oh, the Japanese one is different.

1928
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:10,050
That's why.

1929
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,570
Wait, how do I look down?

1930
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,610
Is it action?

1931
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:14,650
Circle?

1932
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:16,150
Square?

1933
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:16,970
X?

1934
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:24,250
I should just have that equipped, shouldn't I?

1935
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:25,070
Triangle?

1936
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:25,550
No.

1937
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:26,630
Circle?

1938
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:27,830
No.

1939
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:28,830
Tilt your head down.

1940
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,910
Just use your neck, dummy.

1941
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,270
Triangle plus down?

1942
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,170
Or triangle plus down?

1943
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:45,190
Ah, thank you!

1944
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,450
I hate Alaska.

1945
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:52,270
Boy, oh boy, that woman is built around here.

1946
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,550
That woman is... holy... that shit kind of sucks in.

1947
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:57,630
God, I was thinking about women on the toilet.

1948
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:58,990
That's my favorite activity.

1949
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,810
Gosh, I'm going to think about every woman on the toilet.

1950
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,740
Oh, here we go.

1951
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,000
We can see around in there.

1952
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,040
Thank you.

1953
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:24,120
Hi, that guy.

1954
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,420
What a silly guy on the toilet.

1955
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,440
Catching colds in Alaska.

1956
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:40,040
You would think that being in, like, being, you know, a super soldier, shouldn't you have a better immune system?

1957
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,760
This guy just kind of sucks.

1958
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,000
He's IQ 179.

1959
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,180
Everyone else is 180.

1960
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,340
He's just 179.

1961
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,940
Not him.

1962
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,420
Not him.

1963
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,460
Not him.

1964
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,980
Not him.

1965
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:59,480
This scary music is so funny.

1966
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,120
A woman!

1967
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:05,780
Snake, the DARPA chief signal is coming from somewhere in that area.

1968
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,480
Isn't there someplace to drop down?

1969
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,000
Take a look around in first person view mode.

1970
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:10,680
I'm looking.

1971
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,100
Actually...

1972
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:17,560
Master!

1973
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,100
Snake, you've got to think.

1974
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,860
Your mind is your most dangerous weapon.

1975
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:24,460
Got to think?

1976
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,960
If things are getting too complicated, try to simplify them.

1977
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:28,480
Try your thoughts.

1978
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,440
You can also try calling Campbell for advice.

1979
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:34,020
Or you, because I'm your master.

1980
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:35,800
Instructor.

1981
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,500
Okay.

1982
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,440
He has a point.

1983
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,180
Don't agree with him.

1984
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,360
Oh, here we go.

1985
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,420
Nice angle.

1986
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,180
Who's that?

1987
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:56,600
Who's that?

1988
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,060
I'm here to save you.

1989
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,000
You're the DARPA chief, Donald Anderson, right?

1990
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,080
You're here to save me, huh?

1991
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,700
What's your outfit?

1992
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,140
I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt.

1993
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,020
A Gucci Prada.

1994
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:16,780
Really?

1995
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:20,500
It's true.

1996
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,520
You don't look like one of them.

1997
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,120
George Butt!

1998
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,680
In that case, hurry up and get me out of here.

1999
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,680
Slow down.

2000
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:31,980
Don't worry.

2001
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,860
First, I want some information.

2002
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,480
About the terrorists.

2003
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:35,940
Yeah.

2004
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:36,680
The terrorists?

2005
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:37,660
What do you mean the...

2006
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,660
Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?

2007
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,420
What are you talking about?

2008
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:40,920
Why are you so shocked?

2009
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,000
The terrorists are threatening the White House.

2010
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,760
They say if they don't exceed to their demands, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.

2011
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,300
Sweet Jesus.

2012
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,180
Is it possible?

2013
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:49,300
What?

2014
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,360
How does this guy not know?

2015
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:50,800
It's possible.

2016
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,180
They...

2017
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,560
Phantom Snake welcomed the membership.

2018
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:53,920
Thank you.

2019
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:54,960
...could launch a nuclear weapon.

2020
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,060
What?

2021
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,560
How did they plan to launch?

2022
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,000
What?

2023
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,220
I thought this place was just for keeping the dismantled warheads.

2024
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:02,660
What?

2025
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,800
They shouldn't have access to a missile.

2026
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,520
What I'm about to tell you is classified information.

2027
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:07,980
Okay?

2028
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,280
Okay.

2029
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,280
I'm ready.

2030
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,220
We're conducting exercises with a new type of experimental weapon.

2031
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,560
A weapon that will change the world.

2032
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:16,760
What?

2033
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,240
What?

2034
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:22,660
A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the Gucci snaking suit 2024.

2035
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,780
A nuclear-equipped walking battle tank.

2036
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:25,480
What?

2037
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:26,720
Uh-oh.

2038
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,520
Wait, I thought that was just a rumor.

2039
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,160
Uh-oh.

2040
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,520
Ah.

2041
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,280
Metal gear.

2042
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:32,600
Metal gear.

2043
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:32,620
Metal gear.

2044
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,180
Metal gear!

2045
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,200
It can't be.

2046
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,440
You knew?

2047
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:36,740
God.

2048
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,720
Oh my God.

2049
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,180
Oh my God.

2050
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,320
Metal gear is one of the most secret black projects.

2051
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,140
How did you know that?

2052
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:43,820
Oh my gosh.

2053
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,200
Rex is so cute.

2054
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,980
We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.

2055
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,100
So that's the reason you were here at this disposal site?

2056
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:52,680
Metal gear.

2057
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,540
Why else would I come to a god-forsaken place like this?

2058
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,260
I had heard the metal gear project was scrapped.

2059
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:00,820
Yeah.

2060
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:02,640
On the day of the launch, I heard that the project was scrapped.

2061
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:02,980
It's actually the contrary.

2062
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:04,020
Oh my God.

2063
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,300
It's grown into a huge joint project between Arms Tech and ourselves.

2064
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,180
They made it even better!

2065
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:12,460
We were going to use this exercise as raw data, and then proceed to mass production.

2066
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,340
They made him crazy.

2067
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:17,160
They made him roar like a dinosaur.

2068
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,860
If it hadn't been for the revolution...

2069
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:23,760
The revolution.

2070
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,660
Rex has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

2071
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:31,640
Rex?

2072
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:32,620
I'm sorry.

2073
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:33,060
Rex!

2074
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,320
Metal Gear Rex!

2075
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:42,620
This guy is like, uh, why are you talking?

2076
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,060
Wave him away.

2077
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,200
Get outta here!

2078
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:01,140
Hey, shut up in there, will ya?

2079
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:07,160
I'm thinking back to the Twin Snakes where he literally Spider-Manned on the ceiling.

2080
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,340
Pal!

2081
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,720
My little buddy, my pal, my friend.

2082
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:36,080
Each of us needs to input our password or there can be no launch.

2083
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:37,420
But...

2084
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,560
But?

2085
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,960
They found out my password.

2086
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:41,840
You're so weak.

2087
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,260
You talked.

2088
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,500
You're so weak.

2089
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,580
Psycho Mantis can read people's minds.

2090
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,040
You can't resist.

2091
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,680
Psycho Mantis?

2092
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,060
One of the members of Foxhound.

2093
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,700
He has psychic powers.

2094
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:55,820
Psychic powers?

2095
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,880
This is bad.

2096
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:57,820
Hahahaha.

2097
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:01,700
It's just a matter of time before they get Baker's 2.

2098
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,720
Can they marry you, little creep?

2099
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,360
If they find out Baker's password...

2100
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,040
Stop eavesdropping.

2101
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,120
Yes.

2102
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,600
They'll be able to launch a nuke any time.

2103
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:13,200
Uh-oh.

2104
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,720
But there is a way to stop the launch.

2105
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:16,740
What?

2106
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,420
The card keys.

2107
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,360
Card keys?

2108
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:23,340
They were designed by ArmsTech, the system developers, as an emergency override.

2109
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:24,040
Oh, good.

2110
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:28,540
Even without the passwords, you can just insert the card keys and engage the safety lock.

2111
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,560
And if I do that?

2112
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,420
Yes.

2113
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:32,100
Yes.

2114
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,980
You can stop the launch.

2115
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,420
I'm zooming on the toilet paper.

2116
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:36,460
Hahahaha.

2117
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:37,860
That card key.

2118
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:39,740
So where are the keys?

2119
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:40,900
Mmm.

2120
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,020
Baker should have them.

2121
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,500
The card keys.

2122
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,160
You need three card keys.

2123
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:46,740
Okay.

2124
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,640
There are three different slots to put them in.

2125
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,040
Okay.

2126
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,340
You need to insert a card into each one of them.

2127
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:52,420
Okay.

2128
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:53,980
Three card keys.

2129
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:54,820
Got it.

2130
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,460
Do you know where they might be keeping Baker?

2131
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,800
We are talking so loudly.

2132
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,400
Somewhere in the second floor bedroom.

2133
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,340
Okay.

2134
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,300
Second floor basement.

2135
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,280
Second floor basement?

2136
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,060
I heard the guards say they moved him to an area that has a lot of electronic jamming.

2137
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:08,780
Ah.

2138
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,980
Any other clues?

2139
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:11,040
Yes.

2140
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,840
They cemented over the entrances, but didn't have enough time to paint them.

2141
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,580
Why don't you look for the areas where the walls are a different color?

2142
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:19,120
Different color.

2143
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,020
Mmm.

2144
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:22,780
Here.

2145
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:23,740
Take this.

2146
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,060
It's my ID card.

2147
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:25,460
Yippee!

2148
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,500
It'll open any level one security door.

2149
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,780
It's called a pad card.

2150
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,320
Pad.

2151
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:31,380
It works together with your bank account.

2152
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,280
I just noticed.

2153
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,500
Are there like bugs on the floor?

2154
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,420
Personal area network, huh?

2155
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:36,800
Are there bugies on the floor?

2156
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,380
It transmits data using the salts in your body as the transmission medium.

2157
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,800
As you approach the door's security devices, they'll read the data stored in the card.

2158
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,080
And the doors will open automatically.

2159
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,060
Gotcha.

2160
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,720
Yippee!

2161
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:53,300
Okay.

2162
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,120
I'm gonna get you out of here.

2163
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:55,660
Yeah.

2164
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:56,140
Wait a minute.

2165
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:56,760
I mean...

2166
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,080
What is it?

2167
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,360
You haven't heard any other way to disarm the pad?

2168
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:01,880
Have you?

2169
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,080
From your bosses or anyone?

2170
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:04,000
No.

2171
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,460
Are you sure you haven't heard anything?

2172
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:08,280
No.

2173
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,240
I just said no.

2174
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,760
So does the White House plan to give in to the terrorist demands?

2175
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,180
That's their problem.

2176
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,100
It has nothing to do with my orders.

2177
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,340
But what about the Pentagon?

2178
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:19,400
Pentagon?

2179
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,060
Uh-oh.

2180
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,040
What is it?

2181
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:22,660
Oh my God.

2182
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:23,560
Are you...

2183
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:24,940
Oh!

2184
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,020
The toilet's right there.

2185
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,660
You can make it.

2186
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:27,180
What's that?

2187
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:27,920
Diaper chief.

2188
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,180
Oh!

2189
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:30,660
Oh!

2190
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,340
Oh!

2191
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,100
Hey, what happened?

2192
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,060
Oh my God.

2193
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,560
His stomach was really growling.

2194
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,360
I think he has IBS, you guys.

2195
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,620
I think he has IBS for real.

2196
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:40,840
Oh!

2197
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:41,360
Oh!

2198
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:42,560
Oh!

2199
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,440
Oh!

2200
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,220
Oh!

2201
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:53,440
Oh!

2202
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,160
Oh!

2203
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,300
Oh!

2204
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,380
Oh!

2205
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,000
Oh!

2206
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,080
Oh!

2207
01:32:59,400 --> 01:32:59,620
Oh!

2208
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,520
Oh!

2209
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:00,800
Oh!

2210
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,020
Oh!

2211
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:01,360
Oh!

2212
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:01,480
Oh!

2213
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:01,820
Oh!

2214
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:02,220
Oh!

2215
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,280
Oh!

2216
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:05,920
Oh!

2217
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,500
It's a heart attack, but...

2218
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,220
A heart attack?

2219
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,300
No.

2220
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:10,020
No.

2221
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,240
Colonel, are you hiding something from me?

2222
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,600
Absolutely not.

2223
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,400
Snake, you've got to understand.

2224
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,640
This op is security level red.

2225
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:21,600
You need the highest security clearance to get access to the complete file.

2226
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:26,460
You want me to believe that you're in charge of this op, but you don't have complete access to the file?

2227
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:26,920
Oh.

2228
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,660
I told you.

2229
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:30,340
The Secretary of Defense is in operational control.

2230
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:32,360
I'm just here as your support.

2231
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:35,800
Snake, we don't have time to debate.

2232
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:35,940
Where's the fire wind to it?

2233
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:36,260
Snake?

2234
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:36,540
Oh!

2235
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,660
He's hiding in the ceiling of the prison.

2236
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:38,260
And out of there, find President Baker.

2237
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,380
Um...

2238
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,520
Oh!

2239
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,040
What's going on out there?

2240
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,260
What's going on out there?

2241
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,320
Yeah?

2242
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,260
Yeah?

2243
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,060
Yeah?

2244
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,360
Yeah?

2245
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:06,940
Oh!

2246
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:07,420
Oh!

2247
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:10,520
Yeah?

2248
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:12,940
Yeah?

2249
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:13,160
Yeah?

2250
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,400
You think it's safe?

2251
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,000
You think it's safe?

2252
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,240
What could it be?

2253
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,360
They're just little pixels on the ground.

2254
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:31,260
Ewww!

2255
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:35,960
Ewww!

2256
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,280
I died here.

2257
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,340
Besides this guy.

2258
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,680
Um...

2259
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,500
Oh!

2260
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,740
Don't move!

2261
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,500
So you can't get out of here.

2262
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,100
I killed the Chief.

2263
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,500
You bastard!

2264
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:00,420
It wasn't me!

2265
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,200
Liquid?

2266
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,700
No.

2267
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:06,940
You're not.

2268
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:07,480
Liquid.

2269
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:08,940
Don't move!

2270
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,920
The way he looks like he's in springing action.

2271
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,820
Is this the first time you ever pointed a gun at a person?

2272
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,240
Oh.

2273
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,780
Your hands are shaking.

2274
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:22,140
You got them, rookie eyes.

2275
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:23,040
Can you shoot me, rookie?

2276
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:23,260
Careful.

2277
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,660
I'm no rookie.

2278
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,640
Liar.

2279
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,100
That nervous glance.

2280
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:27,500
I'm not a rookie.

2281
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,020
That scared look in your eyes.

2282
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:29,980
Rookie, rookie, rookie.

2283
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,420
They're rookie's eyes if I ever saw them.

2284
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,180
Screams rookie.

2285
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:33,500
You've never shot a person, am I right?

2286
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:35,060
You talk too much.

2287
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,200
You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.

2288
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:38,960
I told you, I'm no rookie.

2289
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:39,900
Uh-oh.

2290
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,740
They've heard him.

2291
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,740
You're not one of them, are you?

2292
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:43,900
Ah!

2293
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,760
I never knew how they...

2294
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,060
Open that door.

2295
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:48,020
You've got a card, don't you?

2296
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:48,660
Why?

2297
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,560
How they, like...

2298
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,760
So we can get the hell out of here.

2299
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,700
Come in, you know?

2300
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:52,900
Looks like we'll be a little delayed.

2301
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,340
I never understood why they show up here.

2302
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:55,660
What are you doing?

2303
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,140
Don't think.

2304
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,580
Shoot.

2305
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:57,500
Don't think.

2306
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:57,760
Don't think.

2307
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,120
Shoot.

2308
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,040
That's so...

2309
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:00,260
Wait.

2310
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:00,900
How do I shoot?

2311
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,440
X button.

2312
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:05,660
I'm

2313
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:19,220
waiting for you.

2314
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:19,580
Shoot.

2315
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:20,080
Shoot.

2316
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,380
Don't talk to me like a rookie.

2317
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,520
I'm telling you.

2318
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:23,900
Shoot.

2319
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:26,900
Yeah!

2320
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,140
But him saying, like, don't think, shoot is so Top Gun.

2321
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:31,600
So funny.

2322
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:32,880
Ah!

2323
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:34,840
Nice.

2324
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,360
Good job, guys.

2325
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:48,580
Oh.

2326
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:48,600
Oh.

2327
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:48,960
Oh.

2328
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:54,960
Oh.

2329
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:55,500
I'm out of bullets.

2330
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:57,740
Ah!

2331
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,840
I just saw it as soon as I ran back over.

2332
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,440
Shoot.

2333
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:07,540
Shoot.

2334
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,240
Oh, wait.

2335
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,100
Why did I use that?

2336
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:13,600
When I...

2337
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,340
Shoot.

2338
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,140
Always gets me, too.

2339
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,020
Thanks for the help.

2340
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,120
Hey.

2341
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:25,260
Oh.

2342
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:25,640
Wait.

2343
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:26,560
Oh.

2344
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:27,200
Wait.

2345
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:30,280
That's a nice butt.

2346
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,620
Nice push.

2347
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:36,260
You fool.

2348
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,680
You've killed him.

2349
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,740
Killed who?

2350
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:40,480
I'm sorry, sir.

2351
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,200
His mental shielding was very strong.

2352
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,640
I could not dive into his mind.

2353
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,640
Now, we'll never get that detonation code.

2354
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:49,180
Huh?

2355
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:49,820
Boss.

2356
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,080
So happy that you're back.

2357
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,220
Thank you.

2358
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,520
I love you.

2359
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,000
I love you.

2360
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,060
I love you.

2361
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:56,700
Bye.

2362
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,000
Bye.

2363
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,040
Huh?

2364
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,960
Who did they kill?

2365
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:01,780
Oh.

2366
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,160
Ah!

2367
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:09,500
She's just emptying her entire thing.

2368
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:10,880
Yeah!

2369
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,320
Oh.

2370
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:17,860
Oh!

2371
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:19,760
Psychomantis.

2372
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,040
Oh!

2373
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,500
Good girl.

2374
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,460
Just like that.

2375
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:26,100
Hey.

2376
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:26,400
Hey.

2377
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:26,860
Hey.

2378
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:27,380
Hey.

2379
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,000
Hey.

2380
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,220
Hey.

2381
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:29,680
Hey.

2382
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,000
Hey.

2383
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,000
He called Snake a good girl.

2384
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:41,890
I'm going crazy.

2385
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,230
He called YOU a good girl.

2386
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:59,410
That guy's crazy.

2387
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:07,250
Wait, what is the... what is the... how do I get in here?

2388
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,180
This... his little pants.

2389
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,660
He's a boxers type of guy.

2390
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,420
Wait, is this boxers or is this briefs?

2391
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,880
Here, I'll give you a better angle.

2392
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,580
Boxers are briefs.

2393
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,340
Those are boxers.

2394
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,200
Briefs?

2395
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,520
Which one?

2396
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,480
Uh, which bed?

2397
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,100
The bed has the... so let's unequip that.

2398
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:57,430
This way.

2399
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:00,710
Uh, excuse me, sir.

2400
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,870
I'm just gonna steal the stuff under your butt.

2401
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:10,210
The fight sequence was one of the instances where you have to kill to progress the game even on big boss rank, which limits your kills.

2402
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:11,790
Yeah!

2403
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:12,650
That's so interesting.

2404
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,570
I did think about that, like...

2405
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:19,310
Anything in here?

2406
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:22,190
We're so calm.

2407
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:25,610
Isn't in Twin Snakes you get the magazine in here though, right?

2408
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:26,910
So nasty.

2409
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,190
You're a nasty fella.

2410
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:31,310
Mysterious man.

2411
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:33,110
We don't know your name yet.

2412
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:36,010
If you even have a name.

2413
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:37,790
Oh, I already... wait.

2414
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,430
I don't have full life, so...

2415
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:42,070
I guess we'll come back for this ration if we ever need it.

2416
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:49,780
And we can't.

2417
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,560
Boop-boop.

2418
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:53,540
Boop-boop.

2419
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,920
Boop-boop!

2420
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:57,540
Boop-boop.

2421
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:58,940
Second floor basement.

2422
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,360
Yeah.

2423
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:01,460
See, I'm pressing circle.

2424
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,100
It's so weird.

2425
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:06,940
But I thought I pressed triangle to get into the truck.

2426
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:08,980
Hmm.

2427
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:11,620
I'm not... I'm not sure.

2428
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,040
Second floor basement.

2429
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,460
Second floor basement!

2430
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,760
There's no one here yet, right?

2431
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,000
Pretty sure.

2432
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:29,580
Pretty sure we're safe.

2433
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,060
Besides the floors.

2434
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,680
The floors open up here, and they're quite evil.

2435
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:34,980
Ah!

2436
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,180
You killed me!

2437
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,480
Xanflex, thank you so much for the pink!

2438
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:41,740
Still remember playing this at my cousin's place.

2439
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,800
Never had the chance to finish it.

2440
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,320
Well, let's finish it together!

2441
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:49,100
Bye bye!

2442
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:52,540
It's this one here, right?

2443
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:58,580
Grenades!

2444
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,440
I don't remember any of them.

2445
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,320
Doesn't need a name.

2446
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,700
I'm sure we'll never see him again.

2447
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,820
This one also.

2448
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,280
I'm so paranoid.

2449
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,500
I'm so paranoid if any of them has lasers.

2450
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,640
This is level two.

2451
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,240
Oh, the FAMAS!

2452
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:18,840
Okay.

2453
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,320
Let's try and remember these.

2454
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,120
FAMAS is in here.

2455
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,860
Nikita missiles... in here.

2456
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:37,670
C4... in here.

2457
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:42,150
And this is... Stinger?

2458
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:43,210
Oh, yeah.

2459
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:44,390
Yes.

2460
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:46,890
PSG... no.

2461
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:48,490
This is... sorry.

2462
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,550
Sniper... here.

2463
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:51,190
Okay.

2464
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,630
And then what's... and then the...

2465
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:56,130
And then we got the grenades down here.

2466
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:58,570
Yes.

2467
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:03,190
This is a sniper, actually.

2468
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:04,210
In my brain!

2469
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:06,790
I knew it was a sniper.

2470
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:07,710
I promise you.

2471
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:08,490
I'm not lying.

2472
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:09,730
I'm not.

2473
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:10,910
Where's the trap doors?

2474
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:12,330
We literally walked over one.

2475
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:15,010
Chatters are discussing Solid Snake's nakedness.

2476
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:18,370
Or what looks like nakedness in the Metal Gear Solid game.

2477
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,690
The Boxer Briefs theory seems to be the most popular consensus.

2478
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:22,750
Wait!

2479
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:24,110
There's something... What is...

2480
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:25,930
What is a Boxer Briefs?

2481
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:32,490
Whoa.

2482
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:35,070
Whoa.

2483
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,040
Wait a second.

2484
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,600
Do I have to use the grenade?

2485
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:43,440
Oh, gosh.

2486
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,580
I thought I used C4 here.

2487
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,500
Where... which... where's the C4 room?

2488
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,280
It was this one.

2489
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:57,540
Aha!

2490
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:01,300
Let's just unequip these so I don't accidentally miss.

2491
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,400
Oh, these look like lockers for a second.

2492
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:10,960
What's it say?

2493
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,060
No smoking!

2494
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:15,980
There we go.

2495
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,260
X button.

2496
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,380
B button.

2497
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:27,920
I wish it...

2498
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,180
Okay.

2499
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:29,980
I think... Okay.

2500
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:31,780
There we go.

2501
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,800
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2502
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:38,800
Nice.

2503
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:42,470
Okay.

2504
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:44,790
They said it's in a place with jamming.

2505
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,910
Nothing here.

2506
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:55,030
Except a weirdly colored wall.

2507
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:05,610
He, he, he.

2508
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,730
Before we move on...

2509
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:11,390
I, I need to use the little ghosties room.

2510
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:13,810
Oh, so, um...

2511
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:15,850
Let's... we haven't called Master in a minute.

2512
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:16,890
Let's see what he has to say.

2513
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:23,630
Soldiers that have been forged in the fires of battle are used to catching naps whenever and wherever they can.

2514
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:23,850
Naps?

2515
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:30,010
There's a big difference between real soldiers and those kids who have only been trained in VR simulators.

2516
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:31,350
That's not... I'm a real soldier.

2517
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:34,230
After playing for a long time, you should get some rest too.

2518
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:34,770
Oh.

2519
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,790
It hasn't even been that long, Master.

2520
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:37,790
It hasn't even been two hours.

2521
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:39,690
Um, I was gonna say...

2522
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:42,590
You... please backseat me on the codex.

2523
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:44,850
I ask you to because...

2524
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:45,870
Um...

2525
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:49,690
Because I've played before, I'll forget to call them.

2526
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,210
So please, if you're just like...

2527
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:55,310
Hey, you haven't called Campbell in a while.

2528
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:57,230
Or you haven't called Master Miller.

2529
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:58,470
Or you haven't called someone.

2530
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:00,150
Oh, yeah, Nastasha!

2531
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:01,110
Let's get her.

2532
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:01,510
What is it?

2533
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:02,430
One...

2534
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:03,870
Four, one...

2535
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:04,710
Five, two...

2536
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:06,690
Wait.

2537
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:09,310
Wait, how do I...

2538
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:12,050
One, four, one, five, two.

2539
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:15,050
Oh!

2540
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:16,190
Oopsie, my bad.

2541
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:20,650
This is Nastasha Romanenko.

2542
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:23,150
A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.

2543
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:23,870
Thank you.

2544
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:25,970
You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned.

2545
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:26,710
That's me.

2546
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,910
You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.

2547
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:31,510
I am also a military analyst.

2548
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:32,370
You haven't called Chat in a while.

2549
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:36,470
So I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.

2550
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:37,250
Ooh la la.

2551
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:43,310
You can ask me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

2552
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:44,930
I was happy to accept.

2553
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:50,670
We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind.

2554
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:50,970
No.

2555
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:53,250
I hope I can help you to stop them.

2556
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:54,690
You're a tough lady.

2557
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:58,730
Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?

2558
01:46:58,910 --> 01:46:59,290
Thank you!

2559
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:02,270
The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen.

2560
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:03,330
And neither can I.

2561
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:04,190
I love idly.

2562
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:07,130
Unfortunately, all I can do from here...

2563
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,750
Is that a cigarette?

2564
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:09,710
I think so.

2565
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:11,030
Hopefully that'll be enough.

2566
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:13,470
Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway.

2567
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:15,330
It's good to work with you, Nastasha.

2568
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,330
Same here, Snake.

2569
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:19,970
Same here, Snake.

2570
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:25,610
So yeah, if I forget after some time, if you're just like, hey, save or whatever.

2571
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:26,650
I don't mind that kind of backfiring.

2572
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:28,110
Snake, you can't use your radar in that area.

2573
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:31,490
There's some kind of electronic damning coming from there.

2574
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:33,310
I wonder what it is.

2575
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:34,710
Anyway, be careful.

2576
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:36,890
Actually, what is it?

2577
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:37,110
That's weird.

2578
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:37,950
It's jamming this area.

2579
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,820
Have my babies, please, Nastasha.

2580
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,500
First of all, her name's Nastasha, not Natasha.

2581
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:53,980
I don't think she's gonna have your babies if you can't get her name right.

2582
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,200
You can at least do...

2583
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:00,700
You can at least have that common courtesy for her, you know?

2584
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,100
Elris.

2585
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,200
Be careful, Snake.

2586
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,240
No, I want... I want... Where's my proverb?

2587
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,080
Oh, whoops.

2588
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:18,800
I didn't mean to call again.

2589
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,140
Snake, you can't use your radar...

2590
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:20,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2591
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:21,120
Thank you.

2592
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:23,640
Hold on.

2593
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,080
Let's go into the other area and get our silly little Mei Ling face.

2594
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,040
What's up, Snake?

2595
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:37,940
What's up, Snake?

2596
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:39,740
Talk to you later, Snake.

2597
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:40,280
Bye.

2598
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,280
What can I do for you, Snake?

2599
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:46,100
Nothing.

2600
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,460
Be careful, Snake.

2601
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,360
Thank you.

2602
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,840
She's so cute.

2603
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,720
She's so sweet.

2604
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,060
She's so cute.

2605
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,140
You called, Snake?

2606
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:55,540
Come on, Snake.

2607
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,100
Don't call me for no reason.

2608
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:00,300
Do I need a reason to see her cute little face?

2609
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,100
Uh-oh.

2610
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:06,320
She's pouting her cheeks at...

2611
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:08,940
She's pouting her cheeks at me.

2612
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,740
She's pouting

2613
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:31,670
her cheeks at me.

2614
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:33,450
So close.

2615
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:36,190
Next one, maybe.

2616
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:43,630
Do not save.

2617
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:48,140
Beep.

2618
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:48,920
Beep.

2619
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:51,320
Beep.

2620
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:51,940
Beep.

2621
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:59,060
It's so good every time.

2622
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,360
It's so good!

2623
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:03,740
Okay, give me one second.

2624
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:04,580
I'm gonna go fishing.

2625
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,040
Gone fishes.

2626
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,720
BRB, I'm going to the little ghost's room.

2627
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,140
Sorry, I had too much coffee.

2628
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,080
And tea.

2629
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,340
I'll be right back.

2630
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:14,740
I'll be fast.

2631
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,680
I don't know where my phone is.

2632
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,360
I don't think I brought it.

2633
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:37,300
Oops.

2634
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,780
I don't know where I put my phone.

2635
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:40,340
Uh-oh.

2636
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:45,700
I like to check if I have any missed messages or anything while I'm peeing.

2637
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:28,750
I'm back.

2638
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,610
Oh, I should have gotten more tea.

2639
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:32,430
That's okay.

2640
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,550
I still have a little bit.

2641
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,340
I have a cut on my lip.

2642
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,040
And it hurts every time I smile.

2643
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,160
So I'm just gonna... I'm gonna frown the whole stream.

2644
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:48,640
Ouch.

2645
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:54,500
It's because when I had, um...

2646
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:56,380
When I had...

2647
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,400
I get really dry lips.

2648
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:08,540
And when I had COVID, I didn't want to use any of my lip balms because I was like, I'll have to get rid of them afterwards because...

2649
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:10,440
They'll be infected.

2650
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,560
Stick, remember what Confucius said.

2651
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:16,440
The man who runs in front of a car gets tired.

2652
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:19,120
But the man who runs behind a car gets exhausted.

2653
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,400
MGS Sneaky Music ASMR Channel.

2654
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:23,160
Uh-oh.

2655
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:28,960
Ah.

2656
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:29,900
Ah.

2657
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:30,720
Wait.

2658
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:32,240
Oh, okay, good, good, good.

2659
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:32,920
Sorry.

2660
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,140
I thought, uh...

2661
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,780
I thought my controller turned off.

2662
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:43,140
Why didn't you just use your finger?

2663
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,260
Because it's not like... it's not like the fingery type.

2664
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,840
It's like the ones that you...

2665
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,360
It's not like the one you squeeze.

2666
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:50,340
So...

2667
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,160
My lips can't...

2668
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,640
I can't cut them.

2669
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,080
Yeah.

2670
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:57,880
Anyway.

2671
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,040
Let's actually save.

2672
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:02,720
Oh, she's still mad at me.

2673
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,040
I'm gonna save this time.

2674
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,060
Mei-Ling, please believe me.

2675
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:07,940
I'm gonna save.

2676
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:08,420
I'm gonna save.

2677
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,200
Wait, didn't I just save?

2678
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:10,880
You know what?

2679
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:11,140
It's fine.

2680
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:12,880
Taco Mei-Ling.

2681
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:13,740
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

2682
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:14,640
Thank you so much.

2683
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:17,360
Thank you guys for all the donuts while I was gone too.

2684
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,360
Snake, listen to what Lochi said.

2685
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:23,580
He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.

2686
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,340
Just because you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.

2687
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:31,160
If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out.

2688
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,600
It might not be worth it.

2689
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,640
Don't tell me that.

2690
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:36,920
That's my least favorite one, Mei-Ling.

2691
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:40,340
Good.

2692
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:41,640
Looks like it worked.

2693
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:45,440
If what the DARPA chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead.

2694
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,340
Hurry up and get him out of there.

2695
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:47,860
Okay.

2696
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,720
We'll get him.

2697
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,200
Easy peasy.

2698
01:55:57,860 --> 01:55:59,060
Don't tell me what to do.

2699
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:00,140
Oh!

2700
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:01,100
I'm still gone fishing.

2701
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:01,660
My bad.

2702
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:02,500
Thank you.

2703
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:07,220
Let's...

2704
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:10,260
Let's go.

2705
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:13,720
Let's...

2706
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:14,100
Oh.

2707
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,080
Huh.

2708
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:23,160
I don't even think if they had painted over it, it would have...

2709
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,780
It would have made a difference.

2710
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,220
First of all, why are they so, like, haphazardly...

2711
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,840
Like, why aren't they just doors?

2712
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,680
Like, did this hallway just lead to nowhere?

2713
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,780
Like, what's...

2714
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,100
What's the deal, yo?

2715
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:38,940
What was the point?

2716
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,680
Why aren't they, like, square-shaped like a normal door?

2717
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:43,580
I'm just so...

2718
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:46,660
I'm so confused.

2719
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:55,280
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

2720
01:56:58,780 --> 01:56:59,760
I should go...

2721
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,680
I'm gonna go grab some more C4, actually.

2722
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,040
So that we have it...

2723
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:06,320
So that we have it before...

2724
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:07,460
Um...

2725
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,600
We continue onwards, you know?

2726
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:17,760
So I don't have to come back in here, is what I meant.

2727
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:18,820
Which...

2728
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:19,820
I might...

2729
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:22,100
I don't have to anyway, but you know.

2730
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:23,980
It's fine.

2731
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:29,070
Got a C4 cheese here.

2732
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:31,050
No, I think I'll do it normally.

2733
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:35,970
This wasn't a particularly difficult fight, so...

2734
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:38,330
I think it's okay.

2735
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:46,440
And...

2736
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:59,230
Some people had real trouble with this boss their first time.

2737
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:01,730
I guess we'll see.

2738
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:02,810
Maybe I got lucky.

2739
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:03,630
I don't know.

2740
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:09,010
I'm just remembering the Twin Snakes version of this fight and how ridiculously easy it was.

2741
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:13,110
I want to go back to the Twin Snakes for all the boss fights.

2742
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:16,210
Okay, here we go!

2743
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:21,570
What could be in here?

2744
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:22,610
Who's that?

2745
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:25,150
Oh my god.

2746
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:27,770
You got...

2747
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:30,670
Ooh, there's a little sexy going on here.

2748
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:39,150
You're the arms tech president, Kenneth Baker, right?

2749
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:43,130
Don't worry, I'm here to save you.

2750
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:46,370
No, no, don't touch it!

2751
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:49,190
C4.

2752
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:50,490
Don't touch it!

2753
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:51,070
I'm close!

2754
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:56,530
Right.

2755
01:58:57,290 --> 01:59:01,510
Touch that wire and the C4 will blow up along with the old man.

2756
01:59:02,650 --> 01:59:06,050
So you're the one that the boss keeps talking about.

2757
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:07,230
And you?

2758
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:09,830
Special operations, Foxhound.

2759
01:59:12,230 --> 01:59:13,430
Revolver Ocelot.

2760
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:22,130
I've been waiting for you, Solid Snake.

2761
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:28,090
Now we'll see if the man can live up to the legend.

2762
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:31,890
This is the greatest handgun ever made.

2763
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:32,950
Oh my god, I look really...

2764
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:34,370
The cult's single action arm.

2765
01:59:34,430 --> 01:59:34,610
No.

2766
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:37,770
Six bullets.

2767
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,550
More than enough to kill anything that moves.

2768
01:59:41,190 --> 01:59:42,590
Oh my god, he said the thing.

2769
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:43,630
I'm sorry.

2770
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:44,850
Now I'll show you why they call me...

2771
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:45,810
This is my favorite character.

2772
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:47,110
Revolver.

2773
01:59:47,330 --> 01:59:47,850
Revolver.

2774
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,950
Revolver.

2775
01:59:52,410 --> 01:59:53,610
He's so awesome.

2776
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:54,630
Traaa!

2777
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:59,190
I forgot to...

2778
01:59:59,190 --> 01:59:59,730
Ow.

2779
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:01,130
Oh my god...

2780
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:02,390
The lady won't help you.

2781
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:03,270
Ooh.

2782
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:05,490
Wait.

2783
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:05,910
Wait.

2784
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:08,070
Wait, I'm confused.

2785
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:10,110
Wait, why is my thing not equipping?

2786
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:10,750
That was weird.

2787
02:00:12,410 --> 02:00:13,650
Okay, um, ouch!

2788
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:14,410
Oh my gosh.

2789
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:27,470
I'm guessing, I'm guessing.

2790
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:31,870
I'm just guessing, I'm just guessing.

2791
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:35,130
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2792
02:00:35,570 --> 02:00:37,930
Oh my god, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2793
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:42,530
I forget the strat a little bit with this one, but...

2794
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:46,330
Oh my god!

2795
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:48,130
Oh.

2796
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:51,910
Oh my god, I can't, I can't do the same thing he does.

2797
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:53,130
Oh shoot, he's over there!

2798
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:56,230
I missed my shot!

2799
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:57,090
Oh, no I didn't.

2800
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:01,570
Oh my god.

2801
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:02,570
Ouch, ouch.

2802
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:04,950
Where's the rations?

2803
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:06,670
There are some here, right?

2804
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:07,590
Ugh.

2805
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:10,370
Where are you?

2806
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:11,290
Oh.

2807
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:13,030
Where are you?

2808
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:13,590
Come here.

2809
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:14,890
Come here, you little bitch.

2810
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:18,730
Where is he?

2811
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,630
Ouch!

2812
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:20,510
Oh my god.

2813
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:23,150
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2814
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:23,810
Please.

2815
02:01:24,850 --> 02:01:25,450
Oh my god.

2816
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:26,830
I just, I almost had him.

2817
02:01:28,510 --> 02:01:29,410
I almost had him.

2818
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:36,100
Where, where you at?

2819
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:57,580
Where is he at, actually?

2820
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,340
Oh, there he is.

2821
02:01:58,340 --> 02:01:58,760
Ugh.

2822
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,300
Ugh.

2823
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:17,740
Infinity frames.

2824
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:19,060
Where you at?

2825
02:02:28,770 --> 02:02:29,430
We're dancing.

2826
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:30,390
Oh my gosh, you guys, we're dancing.

2827
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:34,970
What you gonna do, Ocelot?

2828
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:36,610
What you, what you, are you gonna shoot me?

2829
02:02:36,730 --> 02:02:37,530
What are you gonna do?

2830
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:38,070
Come on.

2831
02:02:39,370 --> 02:02:39,950
Come on.

2832
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:40,990
Shoot me, Ocelot.

2833
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:41,850
What?

2834
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:43,290
What?

2835
02:02:48,590 --> 02:02:48,950
What?

2836
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:49,150
What?

2837
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:49,730
What?

2838
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:54,070
Oh, that was close.

2839
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:54,530
That was close.

2840
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:55,110
That was really close.

2841
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:58,230
Um, I know he runs here.

2842
02:02:58,870 --> 02:02:59,250
Ugh.

2843
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:19,900
Ugh.

2844
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:20,560
Oh, shoot.

2845
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,440
Where you at?

2846
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,160
Oh.

2847
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:26,840
You're pretty good.

2848
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:30,720
That's what I'd expect from the man with the same code as the boss.

2849
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:34,420
It's been a long time since I had such a good fight.

2850
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:37,240
But I'm just getting warmed up.

2851
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:37,980
Ooh, look at him go.

2852
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:38,720
You're so...

2853
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:38,880
What?

2854
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:41,000
My hand!

2855
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,120
My hand!

2856
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:45,760
He sounds so not Ocelot when he says that.

2857
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:47,220
Oh my god!

2858
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,040
Kenneth!

2859
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:53,860
Stealth camouflage.

2860
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,140
Can't you even die right?

2861
02:03:58,480 --> 02:03:59,640
You were lucky.

2862
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:01,040
We'll meet again.

2863
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:02,360
We'll meet again.

2864
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:03,980
Who are you?

2865
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:07,820
I like you.

2866
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:09,700
I have no name.

2867
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:10,760
I have a name.

2868
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,920
I have a name.

2869
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:13,900
Just like...

2870
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:16,260
That... that exoskeleton.

2871
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,080
He killed

2872
02:04:32,980 --> 02:04:33,360
Kenny!

2873
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:36,640
Not yet.

2874
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,020
Not yet.

2875
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,080
So funny.

2876
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:38,640
Oh my god.

2877
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:39,060
Who the hell?

2878
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:40,900
Who the hell?

2879
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,960
MGS1 Ocelot had the best strip IMO.

2880
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:45,840
Can you talk?

2881
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,920
Who are you?

2882
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:49,500
I'm not one of them.

2883
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:52,520
The DARPA chief told me he gave them his detonation code.

2884
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,480
What about yours?

2885
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:55,640
Oh, I get it.

2886
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,980
Jim sent you.

2887
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:57,720
Jim!

2888
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,020
Answer my question.

2889
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:01,780
What about your code?

2890
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:02,660
There's no time.

2891
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:04,960
I... talked.

2892
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,160
What?

2893
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:09,560
Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch any time.

2894
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,980
That was the guy who sent Jim.

2895
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:12,320
It's not like I didn't fight.

2896
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:13,600
Jim Pentagon.

2897
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,280
I managed to resist Psycho Mantis' mind probe.

2898
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,160
He couldn't read you?

2899
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:19,660
How'd you do it?

2900
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:21,720
Surgical implants in my brain.

2901
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,080
Surgical implants?

2902
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:23,840
Surgical implants?

2903
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:25,540
Kind of like a psychic insulation.

2904
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,600
Everyone who knows these top secret codes has it.

2905
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,800
Even the DARPA chief?

2906
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:30,480
Of course.

2907
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:34,180
But the DARPA chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind.

2908
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:35,420
Yeah, how did...

2909
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:36,320
Are you sure you heard him right?

2910
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:37,400
Yeah, that's what he said.

2911
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:37,740
Yeah, I'm sure.

2912
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,020
In that case, how did they get your code?

2913
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:43,940
I never had any training on how to resist torture.

2914
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:49,320
They gave you the psychic resistance, but torture is not as important, I guess?

2915
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:50,700
Oh, he's not human.

2916
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,780
I tell you, he loved every second of it.

2917
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:55,220
What happened to your arm?

2918
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:56,100
He broke it.

2919
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:56,640
He loves it.

2920
02:05:56,740 --> 02:05:57,040
This guy's a wimp.

2921
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,160
Looks like you're more than even now.

2922
02:05:58,300 --> 02:05:59,540
His was sliced off.

2923
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:01,960
You're a funny man.

2924
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,380
So the DARPA chief, is he okay?

2925
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:06,180
He's got jokes.

2926
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:06,200
Dead.

2927
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:06,860
What?

2928
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:08,560
I can't be.

2929
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,820
Get out of here.

2930
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:11,220
That's not what you promised him.

2931
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:12,000
That's not what you promised him.

2932
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,540
Now you want to shut me up?

2933
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:15,600
Calm down.

2934
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,080
What's wrong with you?

2935
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:19,100
I just told you I was here to save you.

2936
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:19,380
Now kiss.

2937
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,340
I didn't kill the DARPA chief.

2938
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,860
He had a heart attack or something.

2939
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:25,500
You think?

2940
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,040
A heart attack?

2941
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:26,520
No.

2942
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:27,960
Oh, don't be a fool.

2943
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:31,080
Anyway, the Terras have both codes now.

2944
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,300
It's a very convenient time to have a heart attack.

2945
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,700
Those boys are totally insane.

2946
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,080
They wouldn't hesitate to launch.

2947
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:37,840
I agree.

2948
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,620
But what do they really want?

2949
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:39,800
They want to kill me.

2950
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,720
Who knows?

2951
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:43,440
Maybe they're like us in the arms industry.

2952
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,220
Always looking forward to the next good war.

2953
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:49,360
Well, I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war today.

2954
02:06:49,780 --> 02:06:51,120
You still have the card keys.

2955
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:51,820
Card keys?

2956
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:52,580
Card keys?

2957
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:53,800
To override the detonation code.

2958
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:54,960
I heard you had them.

2959
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:55,540
Oh.

2960
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:56,160
No.

2961
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:57,160
Not anymore.

2962
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:57,980
What?

2963
02:06:58,020 --> 02:06:58,840
Who does then?

2964
02:06:58,940 --> 02:06:59,760
Not the Terras?

2965
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:00,160
No.

2966
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:01,400
That woman.

2967
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:02,440
Woman?

2968
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:03,060
Who?

2969
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,240
The one with the nice butt.

2970
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:06,400
The soldier that was thrown in prison along with me.

2971
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:07,820
A female soldier.

2972
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:08,600
It must be.

2973
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:09,780
She said she was a woman.

2974
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:11,340
She had just joined up as a new recruit.

2975
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,140
Oh my gosh.

2976
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:14,900
They threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion.

2977
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:16,000
There's no other women here.

2978
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:17,780
Could that be the Colonel's niece?

2979
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:19,900
What if he meant sniper woman?

2980
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:21,820
I gave her the key.

2981
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:24,420
Looks like she managed to break out of here though.

2982
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,580
I hope she's okay.

2983
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:26,920
I'm sure she is.

2984
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:27,960
She's green.

2985
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:29,360
But as tough as they come.

2986
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:30,880
But how did you know she escaped?

2987
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,560
I was in contact with her by codec.

2988
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,140
Oh.

2989
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,960
Until I was tied up here that is.

2990
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:37,420
Codec?

2991
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:38,200
Codec?

2992
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:38,480
Yes.

2993
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:39,760
She stole it from the guards.

2994
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:43,040
If she still has it, you should be able to contact her.

2995
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:43,540
Okay.

2996
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:44,040
What's your frequency?

2997
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:45,040
I'm sure she still has it.

2998
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,400
What frequency was she at?

2999
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,020
Oh yeah.

3000
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:48,640
Let me tell you this.

3001
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:49,140
It's...

3002
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:50,720
It's...

3003
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:51,080
Oh gosh.

3004
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:51,700
IBS?

3005
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:52,400
No?

3006
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,220
Sorry.

3007
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:54,140
I forgot.

3008
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:55,480
Damn.

3009
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:58,820
He forgot.

3010
02:07:58,820 --> 02:07:59,340
Oh that's right.

3011
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:01,420
It should be on the back of the CD case.

3012
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,780
Try to contact her.

3013
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:03,060
Oh.

3014
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:04,040
I'll contact her right away.

3015
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:04,440
Okay.

3016
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,100
But tell me.

3017
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:08,480
If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?

3018
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,000
Hmm.

3019
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:15,400
You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees.

3020
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:16,680
Who's that?

3021
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:19,580
The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.

3022
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:20,160
He sounds like a...

3023
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:21,180
He sounds like a nerd!

3024
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:21,460
A genius in engineering.

3025
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:23,140
But a little bit of an oddball.

3026
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:27,440
If there's anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him.

3027
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:29,120
What if he can't come up with anything?

3028
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:30,680
You'll have to destroy it.

3029
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:32,940
Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear.

3030
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:34,440
Where is this Emmerich?

3031
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:39,140
Well, he's probably being held somewhere in the nuclear warhead storage building.

3032
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:39,560
Okay.

3033
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,700
It's north from here.

3034
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:41,820
That's where he worked.

3035
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:42,620
I know where that is.

3036
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:42,940
I understand.

3037
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,560
But why Metal Gear?

3038
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:45,200
Why Metal Gear?

3039
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:47,280
The nuclear age ended with the turn of the millennium.

3040
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:48,640
Oh, you're wrong.

3041
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:51,260
The threat of nuclear war isn't gone.

3042
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,680
In fact, it's greater than it's ever been.

3043
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:55,600
Uh-oh.

3044
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:59,160
The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium...

3045
02:08:59,160 --> 02:08:59,760
Real footage!

3046
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,900
...is increasing even today.

3047
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,160
Listen.

3048
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:05,900
Have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?

3049
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:06,820
No.

3050
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:07,420
No.

3051
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,500
Drums and drums of nuclear waste.

3052
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:09,740
No.

3053
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:10,460
They're stacked this high.

3054
02:09:10,860 --> 02:09:12,220
As far as you can see.

3055
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:15,660
Because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff.

3056
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:19,040
So they just close the lid and try to pretend like it'll go away?

3057
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:20,480
Essentially, yes.

3058
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:21,120
Oh my god.

3059
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:23,200
And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.

3060
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:25,200
Many of the drums are corroded...

3061
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:25,540
Oh god!

3062
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:27,340
...with nuclear waste seeping out of them.

3063
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:28,020
Unbelievable.

3064
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:30,260
That's getting into my food!

3065
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:31,640
And only that, and several pounds of muff are reported every year.

3066
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:34,520
So you mean to have nuclear waste and microplastics to worry about?

3067
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:39,740
It proves that there's a large and well-organized black market for nuclear waste.

3068
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:47,920
And since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers in particular are out of work with no way to turn.

3069
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:55,460
In other words, there's plenty of available nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.

3070
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:55,540
What?

3071
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,120
Never heard that before.

3072
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:00,560
We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program.

3073
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,580
What about the other superpowers?

3074
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:06,320
Russia and China still maintain a significant nuclear presence.

3075
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:09,500
Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.

3076
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:15,380
To maintain our own policy of deterrence, we need a weapon of overwhelming power.

3077
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,780
You mean Metal Gear.

3078
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:23,640
Yes.

3079
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:24,500
Not the deterrence.

3080
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:30,080
You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cuts in military budgets due to this so-called peace.

3081
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:34,440
I remember hearing a lot about mergers and takeovers among the big weapons makers.

3082
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:35,340
Yes.

3083
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:41,900
And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next line of fighter jet, the Metal Gear system was off.

3084
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,980
This is our last ace in the hole.

3085
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:47,040
That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project.

3086
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:48,420
Black project?

3087
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:49,400
Black project?

3088
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:52,180
Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.

3089
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:56,380
You can avoid a lot of red tape and get a great lead time on your weapons production.

3090
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,340
And no one can bother you.

3091
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:03,000
Not even those bleeding-heart liberals on the military oversight committee.

3092
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:06,640
Love the turns.

3093
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:09,420
Lost in the sword, they give you the tech gift.

3094
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:10,120
Brimes.

3095
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:10,700
Brimes.

3096
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:11,880
I prefer to think of it as grime.

3097
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,420
Good business.

3098
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:17,740
Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed.

3099
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:18,340
Oh my gosh.

3100
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:18,860
That's not that super-jack.

3101
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:19,880
The timing is...

3102
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:20,360
I don't give a crap about your company.

3103
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:22,140
So perfectly.

3104
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:22,420
Yes.

3105
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:24,200
That's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you.

3106
02:11:24,700 --> 02:11:25,180
Here.

3107
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,480
This is what you came for, right?

3108
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:28,620
What's that?

3109
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:29,220
Thanks, Jamie.

3110
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,060
An optical disc.

3111
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:31,080
It's all here.

3112
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:34,420
The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.

3113
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:37,420
This is the only remaining copy of the data.

3114
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:38,760
What kind of data?

3115
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:39,220
Bribes.

3116
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:41,520
All the data collected from this exercise...

3117
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:41,800
Bribes!

3118
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:42,780
Don't play dumb.

3119
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:43,460
It's the way.

3120
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,420
I know you were sent to get this.

3121
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:46,180
I'm sorry to hear you.

3122
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:49,240
I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.

3123
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,340
They don't know this disc exists.

3124
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:54,040
Make sure you report this to Jim.

3125
02:11:54,820 --> 02:11:55,700
To your boss.

3126
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:56,880
I don't report to Jim.

3127
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:58,000
I'll give you my card, too.

3128
02:11:58,320 --> 02:11:58,700
Oh, thanks.

3129
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:00,900
It'll open up all security level two doors.

3130
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:02,520
Can you walk?

3131
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:03,540
No.

3132
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,520
No, you go on without me.

3133
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:07,080
They got my password.

3134
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:08,780
They don't want anything else from me.

3135
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:10,380
I have one more question.

3136
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:11,860
Who or what?

3137
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:12,940
What was that ninja thing?

3138
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:13,460
Yeah, who was that?

3139
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:14,460
It looked like you knew something.

3140
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:15,540
That ninja?

3141
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:16,440
Who's that ninja?

3142
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:18,280
It's Foxhound's dark little secret.

3143
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:19,680
Dark little secret?

3144
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:22,880
An experimental genome soldier.

3145
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:24,440
Ew.

3146
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:27,180
Cover your mouth.

3147
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,040
You know him?

3148
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:32,600
You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from Foxhound.

3149
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:34,720
She knows better than I.

3150
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:36,760
Naomi.

3151
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,020
Naomi Sass?

3152
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:39,000
Naomi Sass?

3153
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:39,880
Naomi Sass?

3154
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:40,460
Naomi Sass?

3155
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:40,860
Naomi Sass?

3156
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:40,960
Naomi Sass?

3157
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:41,860
Naomi Sass?

3158
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:42,880
And I'm finished!

3159
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,120
It's time to play more Metal Gear.

3160
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:44,680
Metal Gear?

3161
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:45,220
Yes!

3162
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:45,820
What?

3163
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:47,980
Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?

3164
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:48,600
Thanks for...

3165
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:48,720
Thanks for...

3166
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:50,300
Metal Gear itself does, but...

3167
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:50,820
Oh!

3168
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:53,220
I heard his tummy.

3169
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:54,100
He was gurgling!

3170
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,740
What did you do to me?

3171
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:57,500
Oh, no.

3172
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:58,000
No!

3173
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:58,120
Jim!

3174
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:58,760
Oh!

3175
02:12:59,120 --> 02:12:59,780
Oh no!

3176
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:00,740
It can't be!

3177
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,220
Those pentagon bastards!

3178
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:04,620
So...

3179
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:06,520
They actually went and...

3180
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,920
What are you talking about?

3181
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:12,380
They are just using you for...

3182
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:23,760
His tummy hurt.

3183
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:27,380
IBS, IBS, IBS, IBS.

3184
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:28,060
Kenny!

3185
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:30,220
Those bastards!

3186
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:31,840
They killed Kenny!

3187
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:36,880
Are you listening?

3188
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:38,360
Now he's dead too.

3189
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:40,420
I have no idea.

3190
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:41,940
Don't lie to me.

3191
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:45,500
It looked like another heart attack, but some kind of poison.

3192
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,260
What do you know, Miss Naomi?

3193
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:49,180
There are lots of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.

3194
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:54,780
For example, potassium chloride or dioxides, but we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.

3195
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:58,220
Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together.

3196
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,580
Can I trust her?

3197
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:01,360
More than you can trust me.

3198
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,780
Get in contact with her.

3199
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:06,500
Snake, there's a lot of electrical interference.

3200
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:12,740
It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us, but normal transmission is probably impossible.

3201
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:15,260
Try moving away from that area.

3202
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:16,140
I love that line so much.

3203
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:17,660
Snake, get a hold of yourself.

3204
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:20,440
Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing?

3205
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:22,240
Yeah, you have some explaining to do.

3206
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:22,400
Remember Foxhound?

3207
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:23,360
No.

3208
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:24,720
Are you sure?

3209
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:27,080
Yes, we have no one like that in our unit.

3210
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:28,520
Is that right?

3211
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,380
She had a look on her face.

3212
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:31,300
Snake, I'm counting on you.

3213
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:34,120
She looked concerned for a moment.

3214
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:36,440
Oh, thank goodness.

3215
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,920
Oh, I got an achievement.

3216
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:39,840
Versus Revolver Ocelot.

3217
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:41,200
Defeat Revolver Ocelot.

3218
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:41,980
Nice.

3219
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:44,280
Aww, he's dead.

3220
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:46,740
IBS.

3221
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:49,100
Was there blood on him?

3222
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:51,380
Is that like... see that red there?

3223
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,200
Hmm.

3224
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:54,840
Is there any other ration in here or...

3225
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:56,340
No

3226
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:04,670
other ration.

3227
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:06,110
Oh.

3228
02:15:06,450 --> 02:15:07,170
Beep, beep.

3229
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:08,670
Four.

3230
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:11,890
I don't think I've ever gone through this door before.

3231
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:14,710
I don't remember ever going through this door.

3232
02:15:14,830 --> 02:15:15,550
It's so funny.

3233
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:22,190
And then here, there's... that.

3234
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:26,450
You can't see me now, though, right?

3235
02:15:29,110 --> 02:15:30,610
I can probably get that ration.

3236
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:32,330
Raaaaa...

3237
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:44,540
Nice.

3238
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:50,080
I think there's other security cameras down the way, right?

3239
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:51,640
I can't go in through here, though, right?

3240
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:52,360
No.

3241
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:57,100
Or, like, rather, there's no reason for me to go down there right now, because I don't think I can go through any of the doors.

3242
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,520
I've not even noticed that.

3243
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:00,960
Nice one.

3244
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:01,920
Oh, not once?

3245
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:03,200
I thought you said, nice one.

3246
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,400
I just complimented myself.

3247
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:10,020
I just completely complimented myself by misreading your own comment.

3248
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:11,560
Thanks.

3249
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:12,480
Nice one, Mint.

3250
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:13,360
Thanks, Mint.

3251
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:17,280
Thanks.

3252
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:21,140
We go into the void.

3253
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:22,340
But now...

3254
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:23,600
Now we go back in here.

3255
02:16:23,940 --> 02:16:26,080
I forgot to mention this yesterday, but I got the postcard.

3256
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:27,000
I don't...

3257
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:27,940
Wait, hold on.

3258
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:29,440
Oh, shoot.

3259
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:30,920
Can I go in here?

3260
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:33,160
Oh, uh, I wouldn't know.

3261
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,060
I can!

3262
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:38,240
Okay.

3263
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:41,980
I don't remember what places have the...

3264
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:47,160
We're just gonna be safe on all accounts.

3265
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,340
Grenade.

3266
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:49,720
Oh, wait.

3267
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:50,780
This is the grenade room.

3268
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:51,260
Hahaha.

3269
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:52,320
What's this?

3270
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:55,060
It's safe.

3271
02:16:58,660 --> 02:17:00,860
I forgot to mention this yesterday, but I got the postcard.

3272
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:02,420
I don't care that it has a tire mark on it.

3273
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:03,020
It gives character.

3274
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:04,720
Well, we care.

3275
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:07,180
But I'm...

3276
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:07,660
Thank you.

3277
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:08,620
Thanks for signing up.

3278
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:09,480
I'm glad you got it.

3279
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:14,680
But yeah, we really do care that it has the tire mark on it.

3280
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:20,620
In the podcast, we recorded yesterday, actually, and I called it...

3281
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:22,320
I called it a skid mark.

3282
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:23,660
And...

3283
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:27,260
And Matara was just like, what?

3284
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:28,240
What did you say?

3285
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:29,540
Why did you call it that?

3286
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:30,460
Do you know what that means?

3287
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,760
I was like, what are you talking about?

3288
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:33,280
Like a...

3289
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:35,440
Like a skid mark on the road.

3290
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:37,180
Like a tire skid mark.

3291
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:39,740
She was like, that's not what that means.

3292
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,900
And I had to, like, look it up mid-recording.

3293
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,520
I was like, yes, that is what that means.

3294
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:45,760
It literally...

3295
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:47,580
The first definition of it was a...

3296
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:49,320
Like a tire skid mark.

3297
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:50,680
I can't...

3298
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:51,100
I can't...

3299
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:51,480
I can't...

3300
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:52,120
I can't...

3301
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:52,300
I can't...

3302
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:53,360
I can't live like this anymore, you guys.

3303
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:54,120
I can't keep...

3304
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:56,420
I can't keep not really like this.

3305
02:17:56,540 --> 02:17:57,560
I swear to God.

3306
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:58,540
I swear.

3307
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:06,240
This is happening everyday in my afterlife.

3308
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,600
I can't do this anymore.

3309
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,060
I can't.

3310
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:11,640
I can't keep living in paranoia.

3311
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,720
Of everything.

3312
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,560
What else are you supposed to say?

3313
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,620
Tire marks, like guys?

3314
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:21,500
I don't know...

3315
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:22,280
I guess?

3316
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:23,780
I don't know!

3317
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:27,780
I can't...

3318
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,480
I just...

3319
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,820
I didn't know.

3320
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:34,600
I didn't know.

3321
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:37,580
I can't believe you raw-talked that skinmark line.

3322
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:38,640
Shut up!

3323
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:41,860
Raw-talking lines without her prediction.

3324
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,120
What is a skinmark then?

3325
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:48,140
It's apparently like... I don't want to say it.

3326
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:48,600
It's gross.

3327
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:54,560
If you google skinmarks, the first definition was like a tire mark on the road.

3328
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:58,540
And then the second was the definition that she was thinking of.

3329
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:01,500
I just...

3330
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:03,460
I never think of that!

3331
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:05,920
Doo-doo residue.

3332
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:08,060
Doo-doo resi-doo-doo.

3333
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:10,080
Resi-doo-doo.

3334
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:10,920
That's what it...

3335
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:16,500
Just don't turn on google image search.

3336
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:17,420
Okay, so...

3337
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:19,940
Funny that you mentioned that because

3338
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:27,700
for some reason when I look stuff up, I like instinctually go to google images.

3339
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:28,620
I don't know why.

3340
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:38,840
But I was like laughing because there was like a board game or something.

3341
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:41,920
Like a children's game that was called skinmarks or something.

3342
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:45,300
And you play as a dog that were like...

3343
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:48,920
You put like a brown pencil in it.

3344
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:50,300
And it's like a drawing game.

3345
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,380
And I'm just scared.

3346
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:51,940
I can't.

3347
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:54,780
I can't!

3348
02:19:57,660 --> 02:20:01,060
And like the dog like scoots around on its butt.

3349
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:04,580
But doesn't that mean like it has worms and stuff?

3350
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:06,540
It's just so...

3351
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:08,260
Oh god.

3352
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:09,220
Hold on, I'll take a sippy.

3353
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:18,100
The things they make for children are truly abhorrent sometimes, I swear.

3354
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,480
Okay, I'm gonna go choke this guy.

3355
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:24,040
Oh!

3356
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:24,600
We're fine!

3357
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:25,580
We're fine!

3358
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:26,260
He's dead.

3359
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:27,600
Just run away.

3360
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:29,480
There we go.

3361
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,460
We're fine!

3362
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:34,340
Everything's fine.

3363
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:35,300
Don't worry about it.

3364
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:38,780
I always run into them when I'm trying to choke them out, I swear.

3365
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:42,840
Spend your afterlife frog-dogging urban dictionary... Stop it!

3366
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,020
I'm not gonna... What, do I need like an urban dictionary stream?

3367
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:48,500
I swear.

3368
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:51,400
Okay.

3369
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:54,460
I always run into them when I'm choking them.

3370
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:56,040
But it's okay.

3371
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:56,600
We got him.

3372
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:57,040
We got him.

3373
02:20:58,120 --> 02:20:59,280
Tried Gakuenmash yet?

3374
02:20:59,460 --> 02:20:59,900
Gakuenmash?

3375
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:00,140
No!

3376
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:01,940
I haven't tried it yet.

3377
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,720
This one was safe, right?

3378
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:10,780
Oh good, good, good.

3379
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:11,960
Wait, is this...

3380
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:13,380
Oh, no.

3381
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:17,640
And then this guy comes down this way, right?

3382
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,040
Yeah.

3383
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:23,670
And he looks up.

3384
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:24,030
Oh!

3385
02:21:24,330 --> 02:21:24,670
Okay.

3386
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:29,090
So we're gonna go to... Oh, wait.

3387
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:30,470
Was anything level 2?

3388
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:31,330
I don't think so.

3389
02:21:31,710 --> 02:21:33,870
Speaking of the board game, the Metal Gear Solid board game ships...

3390
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:34,410
Oh, yes!

3391
02:21:35,110 --> 02:21:36,270
Yes, I know, I know!

3392
02:21:36,370 --> 02:21:37,390
I'm so excited for it.

3393
02:21:38,650 --> 02:21:40,090
Just waiting for him to leave.

3394
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:41,490
Waiting for this guy to leave.

3395
02:21:44,110 --> 02:21:46,150
Go away, so I can take the elevator, please.

3396
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:55,400
Snake!

3397
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:09,330
Snake!

3398
02:22:10,970 --> 02:22:12,150
I took a one step!

3399
02:22:13,470 --> 02:22:14,790
I took one step!

3400
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:16,950
That's insanity.

3401
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:23,620
Oh my god.

3402
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:26,980
Oh my god.

3403
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:30,360
I cannot believe that actually happened.

3404
02:22:30,700 --> 02:22:32,580
Can I get the... Wait, what else can I get here?

3405
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:33,140
I can't remember.

3406
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:34,160
Ha.

3407
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:35,220
Ha.

3408
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:36,600
Ha, ha.

3409
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,580
Ha, indeed.

3410
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:38,060
Ha.

3411
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:41,260
Normal people are like the dictionary.

3412
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:54,540
La, la, la.

3413
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:04,960
Back it up, back it up, back it up, baby.

3414
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,960
Yeah, these ones are... these ones don't move.

3415
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:13,100
Okay.

3416
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:14,220
Alright, Snake.

3417
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:15,920
There you go, there you go.

3418
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,740
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

3419
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:19,760
Okay, now he comes down.

3420
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:22,480
Okay.

3421
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:22,760
Okay.

3422
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:24,660
Woo, woo, woo.

3423
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,200
We can probably take this guy out then.

3424
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,680
Oh, shoot!

3425
02:23:58,730 --> 02:23:59,910
Oh, thank you.

3426
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:01,730
We're fine.

3427
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:29,430
Oh, thank you.

3428
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:31,470
Don't, don't come in here.

3429
02:24:31,630 --> 02:24:32,150
I swear.

3430
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:35,130
Yeah, return to your position!

3431
02:24:35,350 --> 02:24:35,910
Oh, man.

3432
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:36,470
They reset.

3433
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:36,570
They reset.

3434
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:39,610
I should've just shot him, shouldn't I?

3435
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:40,790
Oh.

3436
02:24:41,930 --> 02:24:43,090
Okay, now I have to wait.

3437
02:24:44,410 --> 02:24:46,970
Actually, which way does this... does he go down or does he go up?

3438
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:48,150
He goes up, right?

3439
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:54,560
Ugh.

3440
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:57,040
Stealth, you guys, I swear.

3441
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:58,320
Ha, ha, ha.

3442
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:17,260
Why do I even engage?

3443
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:18,220
You know?

3444
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:20,200
Ha, ha, ha.

3445
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:21,460
Why do I even engage?

3446
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:24,880
Ha, ha, ha.

3447
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:25,300
For fun.

3448
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,160
Ha, ha, ha.

3449
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:34,940
When do I get a box, man?

3450
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:35,800
I feel so naked.

3451
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:39,180
Okay, um...

3452
02:25:58,880 --> 02:25:59,400
Oh, my God.

3453
02:25:59,460 --> 02:25:59,760
Oh, my God.

3454
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:11,060
Is it in here?

3455
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:15,210
Ah, okay.

3456
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:17,230
I was like, wait a second.

3457
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:18,570
I think it actually is around here.

3458
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:19,450
Yippee!

3459
02:26:20,150 --> 02:26:20,630
Oh.

3460
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:30,220
I need more ration, though.

3461
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:30,920
Yikes.

3462
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:33,320
When will it let me hoard more?

3463
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:34,320
I swear.

3464
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:39,920
Ha, ha, ha.

3465
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:41,220
Oh, gosh.

3466
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,920
It's always this guy that really messes me up.

3467
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:44,960
Ha, ha, ha.

3468
02:26:46,100 --> 02:26:47,100
He's always like, huh?

3469
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,060
What was that noise?

3470
02:26:50,820 --> 02:26:52,140
There's someone else over here, right?

3471
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:52,960
Huh?

3472
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:54,280
What was that noise?

3473
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:57,060
I see you.

3474
02:26:57,060 --> 02:26:57,700
I see you.

3475
02:26:59,200 --> 02:26:59,640
In

3476
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:05,160
fact, we'll just box it.

3477
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:05,820
For now.

3478
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:08,380
Sneaky.

3479
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:08,880
Sneaky.

3480
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:09,480
Sneaky.

3481
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:09,580
Sneaky.

3482
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:09,640
Sneaky.

3483
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:13,680
Call people in the box, right?

3484
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,160
Call people in the box, right?

3485
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:17,340
Campbell, look!

3486
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:19,480
Don't make too much noise or you'll be spotted.

3487
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:21,680
Be careful when you're walking on that floor.

3488
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,040
Oh, yeah.

3489
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:22,560
I know.

3490
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:23,840
Oh, I know.

3491
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:26,880
Look, look, look!

3492
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:28,660
Don't make too much noise or you'll be spotted.

3493
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,960
Be careful when you're walking on that floor.

3494
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:32,180
Colonel, Colonel!

3495
02:27:32,420 --> 02:27:33,020
Colonel, Colonel!

3496
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:37,910
Colonel, Colonel!

3497
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:39,230
I'm like a worm.

3498
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:43,650
What have you got there?

3499
02:27:43,850 --> 02:27:44,970
A cardboard box?

3500
02:27:45,210 --> 02:27:45,510
Yeah!

3501
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:46,830
Remember that trick?

3502
02:27:47,070 --> 02:27:48,670
That's the snake I remember.

3503
02:27:48,970 --> 02:27:51,150
Those poor fools won't know what hit them.

3504
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:51,970
I know.

3505
02:27:52,870 --> 02:27:55,250
Actually, probably Nastasha has a ton of info.

3506
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:57,330
Let's let her info dump for a second.

3507
02:27:57,510 --> 02:27:59,330
A cardboard box.

3508
02:27:59,810 --> 02:28:03,890
A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard...

3509
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:04,690
I don't care.

3510
02:28:05,890 --> 02:28:06,270
...and a paper center.

3511
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:09,070
They are usually made of recycled paper.

3512
02:28:09,470 --> 02:28:09,870
Paper?

3513
02:28:09,870 --> 02:28:13,250
It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago.

3514
02:28:13,410 --> 02:28:13,910
A cardboard box?

3515
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:17,910
It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.

3516
02:28:18,130 --> 02:28:18,630
Wait, really?

3517
02:28:18,650 --> 02:28:24,090
With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.

3518
02:28:24,310 --> 02:28:27,870
And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical.

3519
02:28:28,350 --> 02:28:31,110
In addition, it's strong and easy to throw.

3520
02:28:31,530 --> 02:28:33,730
That's why it's widely used for packing.

3521
02:28:33,730 --> 02:28:43,090
But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes Stronger boxes?

3522
02:28:43,570 --> 02:28:48,110
Also, the crevices should be filled with styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.

3523
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:48,870
Her accents are great.

3524
02:28:49,050 --> 02:28:51,470
Anyway, what's with the box?

3525
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:52,230
I just like it.

3526
02:28:52,470 --> 02:28:53,270
Oh, nothing.

3527
02:28:53,470 --> 02:28:54,470
No big deal.

3528
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:06,420
She mansplains the cardboard box to me and then she's like, so, why are you in it?

3529
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:07,140
And he's like...

3530
02:29:08,020 --> 02:29:11,160
He gets embarrassed about it.

3531
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:12,320
Master!

3532
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:14,380
A cardboard box, huh?

3533
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:17,000
Just like Sandsiborg.

3534
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,160
Just like Sandsiborg.

3535
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:20,680
It can save my skin more than a few times in Outer Heaven 2.

3536
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:26,280
Getting the maximum use out of ordinary on-hand objects is the first principle of survival.

3537
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:29,440
It's especially important in covert operations.

3538
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:31,780
I haven't forgotten what you taught me.

3539
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:34,740
Master, you've taught me so much.

3540
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:36,340
You've taught me so much, Master!

3541
02:29:36,580 --> 02:29:38,140
First, the DARPA chief.

3542
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:41,660
And then President Baker die of a heart attack?

3543
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:42,680
Yeah, it's really sus, man.

3544
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,040
Smells pretty rotten to me.

3545
02:29:44,620 --> 02:29:46,900
Master, do you know anything?

3546
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:48,220
No.

3547
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:51,460
But there's definitely something going on.

3548
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,400
Keep your eyes open out there.

3549
02:29:53,620 --> 02:29:53,760
Okay.

3550
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:55,460
My eyes are peeled.

3551
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:57,700
Gamble.

3552
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:01,420
The DARPA chief and President Baker.

3553
02:30:01,960 --> 02:30:04,820
So now the terror know both detonation codes.

3554
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:06,140
So they can launch at any time.

3555
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:08,800
And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.

3556
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:19,700
Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...

3557
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:23,660
find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned.

3558
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:25,000
Hal Emmerich!

3559
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:28,460
In any case, you should contact Meryl by codec.

3560
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:31,640
Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?

3561
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:32,660
Yes, we're out of there now.

3562
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:33,400
I totally forgot!

3563
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,260
Let's contact Meryl.

3564
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:37,800
The back of the CD case.

3565
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:47,320
140.15 Who

3566
02:30:58,190 --> 02:30:58,970
are you?

3567
02:30:59,250 --> 02:31:02,190
I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there.

3568
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:03,990
The one from the prison?

3569
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:05,630
You're the Colonel's niece.

3570
02:31:06,010 --> 02:31:06,770
Meryl, right?

3571
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:09,450
No, it's not him.

3572
02:31:09,770 --> 02:31:11,690
Then just exactly who are you?

3573
02:31:11,690 --> 02:31:15,410
I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess.

3574
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:17,110
You came by yourself?

3575
02:31:17,390 --> 02:31:19,350
You think you're some kind of one-man army?

3576
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:21,390
I don't need lectures.

3577
02:31:21,730 --> 02:31:23,110
You're just like your uncle, you know?

3578
02:31:23,330 --> 02:31:24,690
How do you know my uncle?

3579
02:31:25,290 --> 02:31:26,230
We go way back.

3580
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:27,730
What's your name?

3581
02:31:28,010 --> 02:31:29,550
My name's not important.

3582
02:31:31,130 --> 02:31:32,690
Could you be Snake?

3583
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:34,390
Are you Solid Snake?

3584
02:31:34,930 --> 02:31:36,570
That's what some people call me.

3585
02:31:36,670 --> 02:31:38,550
The legendary Solid Snake?

3586
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:39,210
You?

3587
02:31:39,530 --> 02:31:42,690
Sorry about before.

3588
02:31:42,830 --> 02:31:44,830
I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys.

3589
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:46,150
But I knew you were.

3590
02:31:46,690 --> 02:31:47,170
How?

3591
02:31:48,210 --> 02:31:49,210
It's your eyes.

3592
02:31:49,470 --> 02:31:50,530
My eyes?

3593
02:31:50,890 --> 02:31:52,410
They're not soldiers' eyes.

3594
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:54,210
They're rookies' eyes, right?

3595
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:56,870
No, they're beautiful, compassionate eyes.

3596
02:31:58,110 --> 02:32:01,510
Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.

3597
02:32:01,650 --> 02:32:02,330
Stop that, Snake.

3598
02:32:02,330 --> 02:32:03,230
She's had psychotherapy.

3599
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:04,370
Don't worry.

3600
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:06,390
You'll land back on them once you meet me.

3601
02:32:06,530 --> 02:32:08,390
The reality is no match for the legend.

3602
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:08,970
I'm afraid.

3603
02:32:09,230 --> 02:32:10,910
Oh, I don't believe that.

3604
02:32:11,570 --> 02:32:14,230
Why did you look so surprised when you saw my face?

3605
02:32:14,930 --> 02:32:17,070
Because you look just like him.

3606
02:32:17,330 --> 02:32:19,610
You mean the terrorist leader, Liquid Snake?

3607
02:32:20,190 --> 02:32:20,550
Yeah.

3608
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:21,630
You know him?

3609
02:32:21,730 --> 02:32:23,130
You're not brothers, are you?

3610
02:32:23,290 --> 02:32:24,570
I have no family.

3611
02:32:24,890 --> 02:32:26,310
So what's the deal then?

3612
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:29,430
Why would he look just like me then?

3613
02:32:29,590 --> 02:32:30,930
But first I want some information.

3614
02:32:31,210 --> 02:32:33,450
You were involved in this exercise from the beginning.

3615
02:32:33,550 --> 02:32:34,990
What exactly happened here?

3616
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:36,250
I'm sorry.

3617
02:32:38,550 --> 02:32:40,450
President Baker, right after the terrorist attack.

3618
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:41,490
That's okay.

3619
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:43,190
But what is this place?

3620
02:32:43,370 --> 02:32:46,310
I don't think it's just a nuclear weapons disposal facility.

3621
02:32:46,930 --> 02:32:47,950
Boy oh boy.

3622
02:32:48,130 --> 02:32:49,450
It's just like them.

3623
02:32:49,570 --> 02:32:51,630
Nobody told you anything, did they?

3624
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:52,130
Nope.

3625
02:32:52,270 --> 02:32:56,010
You see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.

3626
02:32:56,110 --> 02:32:56,470
What?

3627
02:32:56,470 --> 02:32:59,810
This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of arms.

3628
02:33:00,050 --> 02:33:01,810
This is a civilian base?

3629
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:02,610
Right.

3630
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:04,570
For the development of Metal Gear.

3631
02:33:04,690 --> 02:33:05,210
Metal Gear?

3632
02:33:05,210 --> 02:33:05,570
Colonel.

3633
02:33:07,030 --> 02:33:08,750
Colonel, why didn't you say anything?

3634
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:12,230
We're called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead.

3635
02:33:12,430 --> 02:33:12,970
Oh my god.

3636
02:33:13,290 --> 02:33:14,130
Why Foxhound?

3637
02:33:14,850 --> 02:33:18,350
Because they're a special ops group used to handling top secret missions.

3638
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:21,590
They figured they could help keep it all hush hush.

3639
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:22,170
They figured they could help keep it all hush hush.

3640
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:24,250
But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.

3641
02:33:24,550 --> 02:33:24,830
But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.

3642
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:26,050
Why just this time?

3643
02:33:26,890 --> 02:33:27,750
Title drop?

3644
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:29,050
There's gonna be a lot of those.

3645
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:31,390
There's gonna be a lot of those.

3646
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:33,350
There's gonna be a whole lot of those.

3647
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:33,650
There's gonna be a whole lot of those.

3648
02:33:35,970 --> 02:33:37,550
This whole thing is fishy, huh?

3649
02:33:39,230 --> 02:33:40,970
This whole thing is fishy.

3650
02:33:41,110 --> 02:33:43,630
Well, we know what they want.

3651
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:46,470
They want Big Boss' DN-A.

3652
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:48,450
They want Big Boss' DN-A.

3653
02:33:51,090 --> 02:33:52,830
They want his body.

3654
02:33:53,330 --> 02:33:54,770
They're gonna get his body back.

3655
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:56,650
They're gonna get his body back.

3656
02:33:56,890 --> 02:34:00,430
XD He's dead...

3657
02:34:00,430 --> 02:34:01,210
What?

3658
02:34:02,310 --> 02:34:02,830
sometimes.

3659
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:09,810
Yeah, it's really... it's really suspicious!

3660
02:34:20,030 --> 02:34:20,590
Hal!

3661
02:34:26,610 --> 02:34:27,170
Yeah!

3662
02:34:27,530 --> 02:34:29,550
I'm sorry, I'm on a first-name basis with him.

3663
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:34,410
I'm like, oh, you know, Hal, we'll be right back.

3664
02:34:35,210 --> 02:34:35,550
No.

3665
02:34:36,330 --> 02:34:39,230
I've watched Second Floor Basement.

3666
02:34:39,290 --> 02:34:43,890
Taking a shot every time they mention Metal Gear.

3667
02:34:44,030 --> 02:34:45,310
Oh gosh, Loda, please!

3668
02:34:47,210 --> 02:34:48,670
A shirt attack.

3669
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:09,030
Oh no, I just realized we're gonna have to fight the tank.

3670
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:10,070
I forgot about that.

3671
02:35:11,790 --> 02:35:12,270
Uh...

3672
02:35:12,270 --> 02:35:13,170
Five!

3673
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:16,650
Can you give it to me?

3674
02:35:20,790 --> 02:35:21,750
No way!

3675
02:35:23,870 --> 02:35:24,350
Jose?

3676
02:35:32,230 --> 02:35:32,850
That's true.

3677
02:35:35,350 --> 02:35:38,710
I don't know what happened, I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.

3678
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:41,230
I never had any problems in training.

3679
02:35:41,490 --> 02:35:45,470
But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated.

3680
02:35:45,990 --> 02:35:49,350
Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different.

3681
02:35:50,310 --> 02:35:54,830
Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed about being a soldier.

3682
02:35:55,270 --> 02:36:02,550
Every day of my life, I've trained my mind and body for the one day when I could finally see some real action.

3683
02:36:02,730 --> 02:36:03,510
And now...

3684
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:04,370
So what now?

3685
02:36:04,690 --> 02:36:05,650
You wanna quit?

3686
02:36:06,310 --> 02:36:07,470
I can't quit.

3687
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:09,810
I can't allow myself to quit now.

3688
02:36:10,770 --> 02:36:11,730
Listen, Meryl.

3689
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:14,750
Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.

3690
02:36:15,050 --> 02:36:15,530
Yikes.

3691
02:36:15,790 --> 02:36:19,550
Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.

3692
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:24,190
In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out.

3693
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:27,330
It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield.

3694
02:36:27,930 --> 02:36:29,410
But this isn't a war.

3695
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:31,150
It's a terrorist action.

3696
02:36:31,790 --> 02:36:33,490
You're just a little jumpy from the cutscene.

3697
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:34,670
It's still combat high.

3698
02:36:34,670 --> 02:36:35,870
Yeah, it's still combat, though.

3699
02:36:35,890 --> 02:36:36,890
The adrenaline in your bloodstream is starting to thin out.

3700
02:36:37,210 --> 02:36:38,310
Just take it easy.

3701
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:41,950
But I learned all about combat high at the academy.

3702
02:36:42,450 --> 02:36:43,710
We'll talk about it later.

3703
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:46,610
For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.

3704
02:36:48,230 --> 02:36:51,470
If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff.

3705
02:36:51,550 --> 02:36:53,630
Because they don't have it in the Twin Snakes?

3706
02:36:53,630 --> 02:36:54,830
Let me try to say this another way.

3707
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:55,590
It's like so...

3708
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:57,190
Stay the hell out of my way.

3709
02:36:57,470 --> 02:36:57,830
Ugh.

3710
02:36:59,550 --> 02:37:01,010
You're a real bastard.

3711
02:37:01,490 --> 02:37:03,010
Just like my uncle said.

3712
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:04,850
I told you.

3713
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:06,890
The real me is no match for the legend.

3714
02:37:08,190 --> 02:37:09,970
It looks like you were right.

3715
02:37:12,110 --> 02:37:12,910
Okay, Snake.

3716
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:14,610
I'll be a good girl.

3717
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:16,870
We'll link up after I grab the doctor.

3718
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:19,150
Then we'll take care of the detonation code override.

3719
02:37:19,690 --> 02:37:20,130
Gotcha.

3720
02:37:20,330 --> 02:37:20,930
But listen.

3721
02:37:21,050 --> 02:37:22,570
I know this area better than you.

3722
02:37:22,770 --> 02:37:24,350
Call me if you have any questions.

3723
02:37:24,690 --> 02:37:26,330
Be careful, okay?

3724
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:28,210
You said you'd be a good girl.

3725
02:37:28,210 --> 02:37:28,890
Open the cargo door.

3726
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:29,850
I'll contact you.

3727
02:37:30,050 --> 02:37:30,410
Okay.

3728
02:37:31,410 --> 02:37:32,830
Open the car- uh...

3729
02:37:32,830 --> 02:37:33,870
Open the door for me.

3730
02:37:33,930 --> 02:37:35,630
The cargo door for me.

3731
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:38,670
Open the door for me.

3732
02:37:38,670 --> 02:37:40,370
The cargo door for me.

3733
02:37:41,850 --> 02:37:43,170
That guy's right there.

3734
02:37:45,110 --> 02:37:47,910
I know I gotta go get some thermal goggles.

3735
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:49,910
They're in that one right there, right?

3736
02:37:50,030 --> 02:37:50,530
Up there?

3737
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:53,010
Or is it the night vision?

3738
02:37:55,330 --> 02:37:57,590
If I walk, the guy below will hear me.

3739
02:37:57,670 --> 02:37:58,330
So, hold on.

3740
02:37:59,510 --> 02:38:00,690
Actually, I'll just crawl.

3741
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,740
You can't get them now?

3742
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:15,720
You can only get them after the tank.

3743
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:17,420
Oh, so I have to use the cigarettes?

3744
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:19,080
Okay, we'll just chill then.

3745
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:20,380
We'll just wait for her to open the door.

3746
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:29,960
What's the one in that room?

3747
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:31,340
Oh, downstairs.

3748
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,360
I can go in there though, right?

3749
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:35,740
Oh, already?

3750
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:39,620
Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you.

3751
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:39,940
Yippee!

3752
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:40,340
Thanks.

3753
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:41,200
Where are you?

3754
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:42,920
Where I can see ya.

3755
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:44,860
Don't move around too much.

3756
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:45,800
Don't worry.

3757
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,640
I'm disguised in this enemy uniform.

3758
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:51,620
You won't be for long with the way you walk.

3759
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:53,200
What does that mean?

3760
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:54,700
Nothing.

3761
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:56,620
Listen, Snake.

3762
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:58,360
The cargo door is like an airlock.

3763
02:38:58,660 --> 02:38:59,120
Don't worry about it.

3764
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:00,760
It's equipped with infrared sensors.

3765
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:01,520
Be careful.

3766
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:02,440
Too late for the goggles?

3767
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:02,700
How is it too late?

3768
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:04,520
If an intruder ascends, gas is released.

3769
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:05,520
Gas?

3770
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:06,040
Gas.

3771
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:08,660
Okay, so we'll meet at the nuclear warhead storage building.

3772
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,760
Hey, you said you'd be a good girl.

3773
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:11,660
You said you'd stay put and be a good girl.

3774
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,440
I changed my mind.

3775
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:14,140
That was fast.

3776
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:14,740
Don't get careless.

3777
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:16,720
That's when things always turn sour.

3778
02:39:17,300 --> 02:39:21,780
Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure out whether or not I'm cut out to be a soldier.

3779
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:23,560
Wait, but it's not too late.

3780
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:25,460
These guys are professionals.

3781
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:27,060
You're going to get yourself killed.

3782
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:28,200
See you there.

3783
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:31,340
Oh, it's a glitch to get it?

3784
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:34,920
That's not fair.

3785
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:35,900
That's not real.

3786
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:37,360
Oh, my God.

3787
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:39,380
One time, I was playing this game.

3788
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:44,200
And I was down there in that room, in the one below.

3789
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:46,500
That one.

3790
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:50,760
And I got killed.

3791
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:53,380
Or no, I didn't get killed.

3792
02:39:53,480 --> 02:39:57,520
I triggered an alert as the cargo door was opening.

3793
02:39:57,860 --> 02:40:02,580
And so it, like, mid-cutscene, closed the cargo door.

3794
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:04,900
As I was like...

3795
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:08,320
As I was trying to, um...

3796
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:11,140
As I was trying to, like...

3797
02:40:11,140 --> 02:40:14,120
I was in cutscene, but the guy was, like, shooting at me.

3798
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,040
It was so funny.

3799
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:16,820
Oh, gosh.

3800
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:17,780
I need more ration.

3801
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,740
I think I will try and get the suppressor, though.

3802
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:20,820
It would probably be good to have.

3803
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:24,180
Oh, I think it might be good to have.

3804
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:29,450
Probably.

3805
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:33,730
Wait, does that guy walk over this way?

3806
02:40:33,810 --> 02:40:33,950
Yes.

3807
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:35,450
We're just going to hold out.

3808
02:40:36,350 --> 02:40:37,430
We're going to hold out.

3809
02:40:37,430 --> 02:40:38,550
That guy is right there.

3810
02:40:38,630 --> 02:40:39,670
He might hear my footsteps.

3811
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:40,810
We're going to let for him...

3812
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:42,050
Wait for him to go away.

3813
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:44,110
A little bit.

3814
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,290
Oh, my God.

3815
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:50,030
He's right there.

3816
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:57,380
He was right there.

3817
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:58,340
I thought he left.

3818
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:00,820
Oh, my gosh.

3819
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:05,140
Is he gone?

3820
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:09,960
Clearly, he's blind.

3821
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:20,220
And...

3822
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:20,840
Oh.

3823
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,400
Why did you turn?

3824
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:44,280
I forgot that it...

3825
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:44,820
That it...

3826
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:45,500
That it, like...

3827
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:45,780
Wait.

3828
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:52,160
My box.

3829
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:55,660
My box.

3830
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:58,640
I forgot that it, like, shows up.

3831
02:41:58,680 --> 02:41:59,100
You know?

3832
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:01,220
Wait, do I have to call her again?

3833
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:01,920
Shoot.

3834
02:42:02,320 --> 02:42:03,000
Yes, I do.

3835
02:42:03,860 --> 02:42:04,440
Hold on.

3836
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:05,640
I have to look at the back of the box.

3837
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:11,850
140.15.

3838
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:13,770
It's already there.

3839
02:42:15,550 --> 02:42:16,110
Oh, wait.

3840
02:42:16,170 --> 02:42:16,570
Oh, no.

3841
02:42:16,730 --> 02:42:17,390
It's at...

3842
02:42:17,390 --> 02:42:18,530
I can't even read.

3843
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:22,310
So, now the terrorists know both detonation codes.

3844
02:42:22,490 --> 02:42:22,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3845
02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:23,530
I think we...

3846
02:42:23,530 --> 02:42:24,530
I think we did this one.

3847
02:42:24,830 --> 02:42:25,270
Okay.

3848
02:42:25,930 --> 02:42:26,370
Mooned.

3849
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:27,170
Mooned.

3850
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:28,190
Mooned.

3851
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:28,410
Oh.

3852
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:29,070
Uh.

3853
02:42:29,710 --> 02:42:30,150
Uh.

3854
02:42:31,150 --> 02:42:31,830
No, no.

3855
02:42:31,910 --> 02:42:32,530
Oh, it's fine.

3856
02:42:33,130 --> 02:42:35,950
In any case, you should contact Meryl by codec.

3857
02:42:36,270 --> 02:42:37,750
Wasn't her frequency rated?

3858
02:42:37,770 --> 02:42:37,910
No.

3859
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:41,450
Okay.

3860
02:42:41,590 --> 02:42:42,130
Here we go.

3861
02:42:42,510 --> 02:42:42,870
15.

3862
02:42:44,810 --> 02:42:46,570
I have to look at it every time, you guys.

3863
02:42:46,770 --> 02:42:48,850
Also, I'm not good at remembering codec numbers.

3864
02:42:49,950 --> 02:42:53,610
I'm going to skip all this because we went through it.

3865
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:55,970
So, don't worry about it.

3866
02:42:57,950 --> 02:42:59,510
Do we got to go upstairs for an item again?

3867
02:42:59,670 --> 02:42:59,930
Yeah.

3868
02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:01,650
But it's okay because we have to wait for the...

3869
02:43:01,650 --> 02:43:02,790
For her to open the door anyway.

3870
02:43:04,190 --> 02:43:04,550
So...

3871
02:43:05,090 --> 02:43:05,450
Okay.

3872
02:43:06,450 --> 02:43:06,890
Let's see.

3873
02:43:06,890 --> 02:43:09,450
What we were talking

3874
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:18,800
about?

3875
02:43:18,820 --> 02:43:19,920
Second floor basement.

3876
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:21,940
Be a good girl.

3877
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:27,800
Okay.

3878
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:30,140
Be a good girl.

3879
02:43:30,360 --> 02:43:30,800
Okay.

3880
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:40,160
Where is that guy, anyway?

3881
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:00,980
Can't believe that guy saw my box.

3882
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:03,460
Kind of annoyed about that.

3883
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:05,240
Okay.

3884
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:06,400
That's kind of annoying, he saw my box.

3885
02:44:11,930 --> 02:44:13,090
I'm kind of annoyed by that.

3886
02:44:37,750 --> 02:44:38,930
Slow and steady.

3887
02:44:39,350 --> 02:44:40,030
Don't move.

3888
02:44:41,690 --> 02:44:43,270
Gosh, you scare me.

3889
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:49,830
Right where I can see ya.

3890
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:54,050
They're gonna find you out with that pretty touch of yours.

3891
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:55,250
What do you mean by that?

3892
02:45:01,390 --> 02:45:03,610
I showed you my box, please respond.

3893
02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:05,450
Oh, there he is.

3894
02:45:17,740 --> 02:45:19,280
I think we can avoid this guy.

3895
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:21,040
Yeah, nice.

3896
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:25,240
Oh, he's gonna see me now though, isn't he?

3897
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:27,320
No, he went the other way.

3898
02:45:27,720 --> 02:45:28,560
Yeah, we're all good.

3899
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:30,840
But there's another guy around here.

3900
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:31,400
Where is he?

3901
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:36,200
There's a guy up there.

3902
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:37,180
There's another guy.

3903
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,880
Oh, the one tank is gone.

3904
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:41,900
It's only just the one guy, right?

3905
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:42,580
Okay, never mind.

3906
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:46,140
And then we go in here and there's a guy.

3907
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:47,900
I have to be careful though.

3908
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:49,380
He's asleep.

3909
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:52,780
Okay.

3910
02:45:54,120 --> 02:45:55,500
Guys, I always die here.

3911
02:45:55,660 --> 02:45:56,140
I'm scared.

3912
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:00,900
I always die here.

3913
02:46:04,140 --> 02:46:05,820
But I want the suppressor.

3914
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:06,020
But I want the suppressor.

3915
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:08,380
Stealthy choke.

3916
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:17,270
Stealthy.

3917
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:19,910
I'm assuming you didn't mean to let them see your box.

3918
02:46:20,210 --> 02:46:20,250
I'm assuming you didn't mean to let them see your box.

3919
02:46:20,250 --> 02:46:21,890
She really didn't know I'm sorry, society.

3920
02:46:21,990 --> 02:46:23,450
What are you talking about?

3921
02:46:24,350 --> 02:46:25,370
You got this, boss?

3922
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:25,790
Okay.

3923
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:31,670
I'm preparing myself.

3924
02:46:32,470 --> 02:46:33,610
I'm going in for the hug.

3925
02:46:33,750 --> 02:46:34,770
I'm going in for the hug.

3926
02:46:37,410 --> 02:46:37,950
Okay.

3927
02:46:45,820 --> 02:46:47,020
I'm being a little creep.

3928
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:48,300
I'm being a little creep.

3929
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:01,860
Yeah!

3930
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:16,820
Okay.

3931
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:20,880
Time to go fight...

3932
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,500
some other stuff.

3933
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:25,860
Meow!

3934
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:40,140
Poison gas?

3935
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:43,860
Okay.

3936
02:47:43,980 --> 02:47:45,180
Why'd she take off the mask?

3937
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:45,780
I don't know.

3938
02:47:46,440 --> 02:47:47,840
Maybe so we can hear her better.

3939
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:48,440
Who knows?

3940
02:47:50,580 --> 02:47:50,980
Okay.

3941
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:53,280
Oh, nope.

3942
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:57,020
Do I have to...

3943
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:58,500
Do I have to equip it?

3944
02:47:58,600 --> 02:47:59,120
I can't remember.

3945
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,340
Do I have to like...

3946
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:03,080
There we go.

3947
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:03,780
Nice.

3948
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:04,200
Okay.

3949
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:06,720
Just so I don't forget that.

3950
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:07,600
Okay.

3951
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:08,600
Cigarettes.

3952
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:11,460
Oh my god.

3953
02:48:13,700 --> 02:48:15,280
Maybe I should use a ration.

3954
02:48:15,580 --> 02:48:16,300
I'm scared.

3955
02:48:18,880 --> 02:48:20,180
Oh, it's not going down.

3956
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:20,900
So bad.

3957
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:22,840
Oh my god.

3958
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:23,000
Please.

3959
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:23,460
Please.

3960
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:23,940
Please, Snake.

3961
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:25,880
I can't see...

3962
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,020
I can't see the one in front of me.

3963
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:27,720
Oh, there it is.

3964
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:28,020
Okay.

3965
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:29,780
Alright.

3966
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:30,140
Down.

3967
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:32,620
Up.

3968
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:35,100
Okay.

3969
02:48:37,220 --> 02:48:37,580
And...

3970
02:48:38,320 --> 02:48:38,680
Down.

3971
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:43,440
Yeah!

3972
02:48:48,090 --> 02:48:48,710
Try calling.

3973
02:48:51,870 --> 02:48:52,530
Hey, Meryl.

3974
02:48:52,570 --> 02:48:53,010
I got through.

3975
02:48:55,930 --> 02:48:56,950
Be careful, Snake.

3976
02:48:56,950 --> 02:48:58,850
That airlock is set with infrared sensors.

3977
02:48:58,850 --> 02:49:00,330
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

3978
02:49:03,690 --> 02:49:04,850
I did it!

3979
02:49:04,890 --> 02:49:05,190
Colonel!

3980
02:49:06,030 --> 02:49:07,930
It looks like the place is protected by infrared sensors.

3981
02:49:07,930 --> 02:49:09,250
You probably didn't know, but box is a euphemism.

3982
02:49:09,250 --> 02:49:10,890
Somehow you'll have to make it past the beams.

3983
02:49:11,990 --> 02:49:12,670
For who?

3984
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:17,190
People who have been through war...

3985
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,750
Then what do you mean...

3986
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:19,690
It's a box!

3987
02:49:20,130 --> 02:49:20,750
Chill out!

3988
02:49:22,150 --> 02:49:24,310
Trust your instincts as a soldier.

3989
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:25,410
As a gamer.

3990
02:49:25,510 --> 02:49:26,130
As a gamer!

3991
02:49:26,950 --> 02:49:27,170
Hahaha!

3992
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:29,170
Yeah!

3993
02:49:31,970 --> 02:49:35,050
Snake, that room is set with infrared sensors.

3994
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:38,190
You should be able to see them if you had some smoke.

3995
02:49:39,010 --> 02:49:40,550
Cigarette smoke or something.

3996
02:49:40,610 --> 02:49:42,410
You would suggest that, wouldn't you, Nastasha?

3997
02:49:42,610 --> 02:49:43,770
Sorry, but these are smokeless cigarettes.

3998
02:49:44,310 --> 02:49:48,150
You mean those cigarettes that are designed to cut down on secondary smoke?

3999
02:49:48,150 --> 02:49:48,890
Is that a real thing?

4000
02:49:49,250 --> 02:49:50,150
Oh, well.

4001
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:56,390
If you blow the smoke in the direction of the infrared sensors, you should be able to see them.

4002
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:59,390
That was a good idea, bringing the cigarettes.

4003
02:49:59,690 --> 02:50:01,870
But don't smoke too much.

4004
02:50:02,090 --> 02:50:04,970
Cigarettes make you weak in mind and body.

4005
02:50:05,130 --> 02:50:06,790
They are bad for you.

4006
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:08,010
She doesn't have a cigarette.

4007
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:09,490
She has a lollipop.

4008
02:50:09,890 --> 02:50:10,450
Obviously.

4009
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:13,530
I don't know why I'm saving.

4010
02:50:14,490 --> 02:50:16,270
I just want to hear her voice.

4011
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:26,060
Oh, complete!

4012
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:33,340
Snake, like Shakespeare said, knots had all spent, for our desire is got without content.

4013
02:50:33,700 --> 02:50:37,640
Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.

4014
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:38,640
I'm always careful.

4015
02:50:39,820 --> 02:50:42,020
Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry.

4016
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:43,380
Be careful, Snake.

4017
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,300
See, she's telling me not to go for the goggles, you guys.

4018
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:48,940
I don't need it.

4019
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:54,020
Hong Mei Ling.

4020
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:57,740
No, no, no.

4021
02:50:58,120 --> 02:50:58,900
No, no.

4022
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:07,490
I didn't get a mind detector.

4023
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:11,470
Wait, where do you get the mind detector at?

4024
02:51:12,030 --> 02:51:12,570
Uh-oh.

4025
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:18,280
Or is it not yet?

4026
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:24,160
No, it is now, right?

4027
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:28,000
Yeah, we'll just crawl.

4028
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:29,100
We're fine, guys.

4029
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:29,520
We're fine.

4030
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:33,340
There's like, what, six of them here or something?

4031
02:51:34,420 --> 02:51:35,340
Who could that be?

4032
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,860
I don't have that!

4033
02:51:42,080 --> 02:51:42,540
Who are you?

4034
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:45,240
Deep Throat.

4035
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:46,600
Deep Throat?

4036
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:48,920
The informant from the Watergate scandal?

4037
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:50,660
Never mind about that.

4038
02:51:51,060 --> 02:51:52,660
You're not using burst transmission.

4039
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:53,740
Are you nearby?

4040
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:58,140
Listen, there's a tank in front of your position waiting to ambush you.

4041
02:51:58,180 --> 02:51:59,420
Who are you anyway?

4042
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:00,420
Don't worry about it.

4043
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:02,880
He's one of my fans!

4044
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:06,200
He's one of my fans!

4045
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:06,600
He's one of my fans!

4046
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:07,820
I'm gonna collect them right now.

4047
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:10,480
They're around here.

4048
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:11,220
I got them.

4049
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:11,560
Hold on.

4050
02:52:11,740 --> 02:52:12,140
One.

4051
02:52:13,080 --> 02:52:15,900
Look how little life I have left, you guys.

4052
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:16,420
It's so bad.

4053
02:52:17,940 --> 02:52:18,760
It's so bad.

4054
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:22,420
Maybe I should go back and get the mind detector, shouldn't I?

4055
02:52:22,840 --> 02:52:23,240
Maybe I should go back and get the mind detector, shouldn't I?

4056
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:23,900
Where is it at?

4057
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:24,280
I got it!

4058
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:36,760
The goggles floor?

4059
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:37,440
Second floor?

4060
02:52:37,620 --> 02:52:37,820
Okay.

4061
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:40,140
Is there another ration over here?

4062
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:44,920
I crawl because I don't remember.

4063
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:52,740
Okay, let's go back.

4064
02:52:53,740 --> 02:52:55,840
The sensors are turned off now though, right?

4065
02:52:58,500 --> 02:52:59,880
The sensors are turned off now though, right?

4066
02:52:59,880 --> 02:53:01,680
And the claymores are right next to each other, so...

4067
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:04,280
Okay, but here I can save.

4068
02:53:07,900 --> 02:53:08,600
Mei Ling.

4069
02:53:08,880 --> 02:53:12,340
How can someone outside of this operation cut into my codec?

4070
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:12,460
Oh yeah, that's right.

4071
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:12,640
I should ask them.

4072
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:14,820
You're talking about that guy calling himself Deep Throat.

4073
02:53:14,900 --> 02:53:16,460
We were monitoring from here.

4074
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:17,940
What about it?

4075
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:21,060
Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you.

4076
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:23,300
But the question is, how did he learn it?

4077
02:53:23,400 --> 02:53:24,720
It's top secret information.

4078
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:27,320
Can you tell me where he called from?

4079
02:53:27,320 --> 02:53:28,180
I'm sorry.

4080
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:30,420
The signal was too weak to locate a source.

4081
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:31,200
We have a leak.

4082
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:32,220
But I'm sure he's near you.

4083
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:32,400
We have a rat!

4084
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:33,880
Somewhere on the base.

4085
02:53:35,220 --> 02:53:35,780
Save.

4086
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:38,520
We've got a rat here!

4087
02:53:38,980 --> 02:53:40,780
You know what, I will do a new file.

4088
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:41,560
It's fine though.

4089
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,140
Be careful, Snake.

4090
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:46,420
Deep Throat being a wisp.

4091
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:53,100
14066 for an integral bonus?

4092
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:53,640
Really?

4093
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:55,720
1466?

4094
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:03,820
Press cancel button to exit.

4095
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:24,720
Music frequencies?

4096
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:25,340
No way!

4097
02:54:44,820 --> 02:54:45,760
Oh my god!

4098
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:46,940
So cool!

4099
02:54:48,260 --> 02:54:49,200
I'll be honest.

4100
02:54:49,480 --> 02:54:51,680
Though, I don't remember the Metal Gear 2 theme.

4101
02:54:53,400 --> 02:54:56,120
I don't think I would have recognized it if you guys hadn't told me.

4102
02:54:56,580 --> 02:54:57,180
Because I...

4103
02:54:57,180 --> 02:54:59,220
Really, the only song I remember...

4104
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:00,360
Unless I heard it again.

4105
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:02,100
I think because it's not...

4106
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:03,660
What's it called?

4107
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:07,340
I think because it's like a...

4108
02:55:08,700 --> 02:55:09,300
Not...

4109
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:10,060
From the game.

4110
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:13,500
But I mostly remember just...

4111
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:14,000
Theme of Tara.

4112
02:55:16,340 --> 02:55:17,540
But yeah.

4113
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:26,960
Cool!

4114
02:55:28,140 --> 02:55:30,640
Thanks for the little Easter egg!

4115
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:31,240
Thank you!

4116
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,040
Okay, let's go back and get the...

4117
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:34,580
Mind detector.

4118
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:37,480
Oh, I should also call everybody.

4119
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:37,920
Hold on.

4120
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:39,320
Canyon!

4121
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:43,920
That was really cool though!

4122
02:55:44,020 --> 02:55:46,420
Snake, you'll have to go through the minefield to advance.

4123
02:55:47,560 --> 02:55:48,440
Oh, thanks.

4124
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:49,320
Okay.

4125
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:50,900
Thanks for your wisdom.

4126
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:52,040
Master!

4127
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:56,360
Master, does the name Deep Throat mean anything to you?

4128
02:55:56,480 --> 02:55:57,020
Oh boy.

4129
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:57,740
Deep Throat?

4130
02:55:57,820 --> 02:55:59,080
That's what they call me at the club.

4131
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,740
You mean the guy from Watergate?

4132
02:56:01,660 --> 02:56:03,080
No, but he uses the same name.

4133
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:04,220
Snatcher or Policenauts.

4134
02:56:04,220 --> 02:56:06,060
Whoever he is, he's not part of our operation.

4135
02:56:06,320 --> 02:56:08,240
But he's been giving me advice by Kodak.

4136
02:56:08,300 --> 02:56:08,540
I know them.

4137
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:08,880
I have not played them.

4138
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:11,320
I have not spoiled myself on them either.

4139
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:12,260
On top of that, he wasn't using burst transmission.

4140
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:15,260
It seems he was transmitting from somewhere on this base.

4141
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:16,620
Because I intend on playing them.

4142
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:17,620
Somewhere on the base?

4143
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:18,380
Yes.

4144
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:20,360
I have no idea who that could be.

4145
02:56:20,580 --> 02:56:21,320
I see.

4146
02:56:22,460 --> 02:56:23,420
No idea!

4147
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:26,480
Hey Meryl, do you know Deep Throat or...

4148
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:28,660
Is that harassment if I ask her that?

4149
02:56:33,480 --> 02:56:34,440
No.

4150
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:36,640
Oh!

4151
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:39,620
She even tells me.

4152
02:56:42,880 --> 02:56:43,840
NISTASHA!

4153
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:57,280
NISTASHA INFAMOUSLY OFF TOPIC.

4154
02:56:57,280 --> 02:56:57,600
NISTASHA INFAMOUSLY OFF TOPIC.

4155
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:00,080
NISTASHA INFAMOUSLY OFF TOPIC.

4156
02:57:00,920 --> 02:57:03,740
We call her and she's just like...

4157
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:05,280
Something's going on.

4158
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:07,040
Everyone's talking about Sniper Wolf.

4159
02:57:07,180 --> 02:57:08,300
And she'll be like...

4160
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:13,020
Nuclear materials are harming everything.

4161
02:57:14,020 --> 02:57:14,660
Nuclear materials are harming everything.

4162
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:19,560
Shit.

4163
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,700
Sorry, I breathed wrong.

4164
02:57:29,020 --> 02:57:29,040
Sorry, I breathed wrong.

4165
02:57:31,740 --> 02:57:32,580
What was I saying?

4166
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:33,260
I don't remember.

4167
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:34,260
Anyway, sorry.

4168
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:38,640
It's a really, really good lollipop.

4169
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:40,780
Sorry, I breathed wrong.

4170
02:57:40,860 --> 02:57:42,480
You know when you like breathe wrong and you like...

4171
02:57:42,480 --> 02:57:44,480
Half swallow your spit wrong?

4172
02:57:45,020 --> 02:57:46,260
That's what just happened to me.

4173
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:48,340
I don't need...

4174
02:57:48,340 --> 02:57:49,740
I don't need the things though anymore, right?

4175
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:50,560
I don't need the cigarettes.

4176
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:53,200
Oh no, I do, I do, I do.

4177
02:57:53,500 --> 02:57:54,460
Oh goodness gracious.

4178
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:56,440
Good thing I did it.

4179
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:57,140
Oh my god.

4180
02:57:58,640 --> 02:57:59,720
Oh my god.

4181
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:00,480
Oh my god.

4182
02:58:01,820 --> 02:58:03,640
Oh my god, oh my god...

4183
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:07,880
Nice nice.

4184
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:21,200
Dang it I really should've gone all the way over there then.

4185
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:24,300
I feel silly not having gone.

4186
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:28,360
Do you think we can take this guy out?

4187
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:31,680
Let's attempt.

4188
02:58:35,480 --> 02:58:35,920
Clean.

4189
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4190
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4191
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4192
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4193
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4194
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4195
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4196
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4197
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4198
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4199
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4200
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4201
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4202
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4203
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4204
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4205
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
CLEAN.

4206
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,260
revelation CLOCK.

4207
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:40,400
Oh, never mind.

4208
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:42,040
Is there a... wait.

4209
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:43,640
Is there anything under here?

4210
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:46,640
Nope.

4211
02:58:46,640 --> 02:58:47,040
Okay.

4212
02:58:50,970 --> 02:58:51,370
Okay.

4213
02:58:51,950 --> 02:58:54,690
It's truly the other side that I have to worry about though.

4214
02:59:00,990 --> 02:59:02,370
Oh, go, go, go, go, snake!

4215
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:02,870
Go, go, go!

4216
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:09,160
It's the other side that always freaks me out more.

4217
02:59:09,160 --> 02:59:12,440
But at least we don't have some guy downstairs being like...

4218
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:15,740
Being like, what was that noise?

4219
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:17,640
When they hear me walking across.

4220
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:22,600
You can shoot the other guy with your...

4221
02:59:22,600 --> 02:59:24,800
Oh my gosh, I think you're right.

4222
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:26,840
Wait, can I shoot him from here?

4223
02:59:36,740 --> 02:59:38,040
Can I shoot him from here?

4224
02:59:47,620 --> 02:59:48,540
This may be far.

4225
02:59:48,840 --> 02:59:49,540
What about now?

4226
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:51,140
What about now?

4227
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,580
What about now?

4228
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:54,040
What about now?

4229
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:55,300
What about now?

4230
02:59:55,940 --> 02:59:56,620
What about now?

4231
03:00:21,240 --> 03:00:22,280
He's gonna see me though.

4232
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:27,100
Where is he?

4233
03:00:27,760 --> 03:00:28,920
Oh, he's all the way over there.

4234
03:00:32,580 --> 03:00:34,380
I think you can from that range.

4235
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:34,820
Okay.

4236
03:00:40,100 --> 03:00:41,080
Is he gonna see me?

4237
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:43,200
Okay, we'll see if he can see my box first.

4238
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:46,380
Just a box!

4239
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:48,020
Just a box.

4240
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:50,500
He doesn't come over here though, right?

4241
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:51,760
Oh, he does.

4242
03:00:51,820 --> 03:00:52,060
He does.

4243
03:00:52,100 --> 03:00:52,300
He does.

4244
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:55,500
Does he continue over here?

4245
03:00:58,840 --> 03:00:59,840
I think I'm gonna try.

4246
03:01:01,720 --> 03:01:02,260
Oh, no.

4247
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:02,740
Oh.

4248
03:01:02,820 --> 03:01:03,460
Oh my goodness.

4249
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:03,940
Okay.

4250
03:01:08,470 --> 03:01:09,410
I didn't get him.

4251
03:01:45,340 --> 03:01:46,240
Got him.

4252
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:08,110
Got him.

4253
03:02:08,110 --> 03:02:08,570
There we go.

4254
03:02:10,350 --> 03:02:10,950
Oh.

4255
03:02:11,090 --> 03:02:11,610
Oh.

4256
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:12,030
Perfect.

4257
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:12,370
Perfect.

4258
03:02:13,830 --> 03:02:14,430
Yes.

4259
03:02:15,030 --> 03:02:15,630
Yippee!

4260
03:02:19,290 --> 03:02:20,950
I love killing!

4261
03:02:22,150 --> 03:02:23,490
Is there anything over there?

4262
03:02:23,670 --> 03:02:24,250
I can't remember.

4263
03:02:24,950 --> 03:02:27,790
It's probably not worth the risk.

4264
03:02:28,470 --> 03:02:29,290
Run away!

4265
03:02:30,290 --> 03:02:33,530
And we're free to run as freely as we want.

4266
03:02:34,090 --> 03:02:35,550
I enjoy the killing!

4267
03:02:36,330 --> 03:02:37,650
I love killing!

4268
03:02:38,810 --> 03:02:39,390
Kill!

4269
03:02:39,470 --> 03:02:39,710
Kill!

4270
03:02:39,730 --> 03:02:40,030
Kill!

4271
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:40,330
Kill!

4272
03:02:40,370 --> 03:02:41,010
Kill!

4273
03:02:42,070 --> 03:02:43,830
All you need is kill.

4274
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:45,350
Kill!

4275
03:02:45,350 --> 03:02:45,710
Kill!

4276
03:02:45,710 --> 03:02:46,070
Kill!

4277
03:02:46,090 --> 03:02:46,490
Kill!

4278
03:02:46,490 --> 03:02:46,870
Kill!

4279
03:02:48,270 --> 03:02:49,870
Worst cameras in the world.

4280
03:02:49,930 --> 03:02:53,910
They can't see even two feet in front of them.

4281
03:02:53,910 --> 03:02:57,350
I'm adding more ghosts.

4282
03:03:00,250 --> 03:03:00,770
Run!

4283
03:03:01,430 --> 03:03:02,810
Is there anything else in here?

4284
03:03:02,990 --> 03:03:05,550
Now that I have free reign, I'm just gonna like...

4285
03:03:05,550 --> 03:03:07,390
We can go anywhere we want, baby.

4286
03:03:11,530 --> 03:03:13,050
Do I have enough grenades?

4287
03:03:14,750 --> 03:03:15,810
I got 12.

4288
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:20,680
Okay.

4289
03:03:21,900 --> 03:03:23,900
I killed that guy in there even.

4290
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:24,920
Okay.

4291
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:25,140
Okay.

4292
03:03:25,960 --> 03:03:26,840
Continue onwards.

4293
03:03:43,230 --> 03:03:44,490
Okay, this one's fast.

4294
03:03:46,090 --> 03:03:46,530
Okay.

4295
03:03:47,010 --> 03:03:47,690
There we go.

4296
03:03:48,030 --> 03:03:48,870
Good, good, good.

4297
03:03:48,970 --> 03:03:49,730
This one's slow.

4298
03:03:50,370 --> 03:03:52,410
Sometimes it's hard to tell which is when...

4299
03:03:52,410 --> 03:03:54,230
Okay, this one is in front of me.

4300
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:55,370
Okay.

4301
03:03:58,010 --> 03:03:58,450
Yippee!

4302
03:03:59,110 --> 03:04:00,310
Where's your thermal goggles?

4303
03:04:00,750 --> 03:04:02,410
I'll get them when I get them!

4304
03:04:07,390 --> 03:04:09,330
Good thing there are no radios in this game.

4305
03:04:09,330 --> 03:04:10,990
Oh my gosh, it's such a blessing.

4306
03:04:11,210 --> 03:04:12,470
That's why I'm afraid for...

4307
03:04:14,370 --> 03:04:14,910
for...

4308
03:04:16,470 --> 03:04:17,010
MGS2.

4309
03:04:20,610 --> 03:04:21,150
Yoink!

4310
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:23,070
I can't remember.

4311
03:04:23,190 --> 03:04:24,030
Do I have to be...

4312
03:04:24,670 --> 03:04:25,570
behind it?

4313
03:04:26,550 --> 03:04:27,510
I'm just paranoid.

4314
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:28,590
Yoink!

4315
03:04:29,430 --> 03:04:29,970
And...

4316
03:04:31,090 --> 03:04:31,630
Yoink!

4317
03:04:33,950 --> 03:04:35,590
Hold on, I'm gonna check this side too.

4318
03:04:37,170 --> 03:04:38,210
Nothing here.

4319
03:04:38,410 --> 03:04:38,950
Okay.

4320
03:04:39,810 --> 03:04:40,350
And...

4321
03:04:41,550 --> 03:04:43,010
Now you can be in front if you're crawling?

4322
03:04:43,130 --> 03:04:43,470
Okay, cool.

4323
03:04:43,910 --> 03:04:44,850
I can never remember.

4324
03:04:45,050 --> 03:04:47,030
There is one that you can't be in front of it, right?

4325
03:04:47,170 --> 03:04:48,130
Or am I going crazy?

4326
03:04:48,830 --> 03:04:49,190
Yoink!

4327
03:04:49,890 --> 03:04:50,250
Yay!

4328
03:04:50,390 --> 03:04:51,230
More claymores!

4329
03:04:52,870 --> 03:04:54,470
And that should be all of them.

4330
03:04:56,510 --> 03:04:56,870
Okay.

4331
03:05:05,230 --> 03:05:06,570
Wait, there's nothing here, right?

4332
03:05:07,810 --> 03:05:08,170
Okay.

4333
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:10,670
Whoa!

4334
03:05:12,030 --> 03:05:14,130
I have such a bad habit of like...

4335
03:05:14,130 --> 03:05:16,610
stopping two steps before...

4336
03:05:16,610 --> 03:05:19,330
before the thing is supposed to occur.

4337
03:05:20,470 --> 03:05:21,290
I'm just fine.

4338
03:05:21,850 --> 03:05:22,690
Okay, that's it.

4339
03:05:22,870 --> 03:05:23,170
That's it.

4340
03:05:28,450 --> 03:05:29,390
He's gonna say it.

4341
03:05:29,450 --> 03:05:30,110
He's gonna say it.

4342
03:05:32,290 --> 03:05:34,270
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

4343
03:05:34,770 --> 03:05:35,170
Yeah!

4344
03:05:36,610 --> 03:05:37,370
Yeah!

4345
03:05:40,690 --> 03:05:43,050
Send him a message.

4346
03:05:43,490 --> 03:05:43,950
Yeah!

4347
03:05:46,610 --> 03:05:47,270
Watch out, snake!

4348
03:05:47,890 --> 03:05:48,890
He's so cool.

4349
03:05:53,890 --> 03:05:55,310
I love that line.

4350
03:05:55,410 --> 03:05:55,890
That's right.

4351
03:05:56,050 --> 03:05:57,670
You belong on the ground.

4352
03:05:57,810 --> 03:05:58,750
Vulcan raven!

4353
03:05:58,970 --> 03:06:01,950
You should crawl on the ground like the snake you are.

4354
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:08,170
Come, let's fight!

4355
03:06:11,260 --> 03:06:12,380
I gotta get close.

4356
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:13,040
I gotta get close.

4357
03:06:13,640 --> 03:06:14,680
Oh, shit!

4358
03:06:18,580 --> 03:06:19,820
Don't laugh at me!

4359
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:23,120
Don't laugh at me, Vulcan raven.

4360
03:06:23,240 --> 03:06:23,600
Come on.

4361
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:25,360
Don't laugh at me.

4362
03:06:25,540 --> 03:06:26,680
I'm doing my best, okay?

4363
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:28,100
I'm just a little snake.

4364
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:29,220
Oh, my God!

4365
03:06:29,300 --> 03:06:30,840
How am I supposed to get close to him?

4366
03:06:31,220 --> 03:06:32,280
Oh, the chaps!

4367
03:06:39,150 --> 03:06:40,110
I think I'm okay.

4368
03:06:41,350 --> 03:06:41,790
Yeah!

4369
03:06:42,190 --> 03:06:42,910
Invincibility firm!

4370
03:06:44,610 --> 03:06:45,710
Oh, my God!

4371
03:06:45,770 --> 03:06:46,630
It wasn't soon enough!

4372
03:06:46,810 --> 03:06:47,050
No!

4373
03:06:48,390 --> 03:06:49,150
Oh, my gosh!

4374
03:06:49,170 --> 03:06:49,410
No!

4375
03:06:49,410 --> 03:06:49,550
No!

4376
03:06:57,920 --> 03:06:58,660
Did I get it?

4377
03:06:59,620 --> 03:06:59,980
Guys!

4378
03:07:11,230 --> 03:07:11,590
Ouch!

4379
03:07:18,200 --> 03:07:18,480
Ouch!

4380
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:18,720
Ouch!

4381
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:20,480
Oh, come on.

4382
03:07:20,500 --> 03:07:21,060
That should have worked.

4383
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:22,240
Don't run over me, please.

4384
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:23,220
Yoink!

4385
03:07:27,460 --> 03:07:29,880
I said don't run over me, but like...

4386
03:07:29,880 --> 03:07:30,060
If

4387
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:55,540
I die to this, it'll be pretty funny.

4388
03:07:55,680 --> 03:07:56,260
I'm not gonna lie.

4389
03:07:56,500 --> 03:07:57,240
I'm not gonna lie.

4390
03:07:59,340 --> 03:07:59,700
I'm not gonna lie.

4391
03:07:59,700 --> 03:08:00,140
This is so dumb.

4392
03:08:02,500 --> 03:08:02,920
Oh!

4393
03:08:03,160 --> 03:08:04,120
I literally...

4394
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:15,940
Oh, I love this part.

4395
03:08:18,860 --> 03:08:19,460
Oh, wait.

4396
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:20,800
No, I think I'm thinking of...

4397
03:08:21,340 --> 03:08:22,100
Twin Snakes.

4398
03:08:22,140 --> 03:08:22,460
Just kidding.

4399
03:08:25,380 --> 03:08:26,440
Wasn't it three waves?

4400
03:08:27,100 --> 03:08:27,740
Guess not.

4401
03:08:29,700 --> 03:08:30,880
Maybe in Twin Snakes it was.

4402
03:08:31,380 --> 03:08:32,020
Well, boss.

4403
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:33,660
I hope you are happy.

4404
03:08:33,820 --> 03:08:34,700
There he goes.

4405
03:08:35,380 --> 03:08:35,860
You got the car.

4406
03:08:35,860 --> 03:08:36,700
You got the car.

4407
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:38,160
We played with him a little longer.

4408
03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:39,640
He sounds so disappointed.

4409
03:08:39,640 --> 03:08:39,740
I'm warning.

4410
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:42,120
It would be wise not to underestimate him.

4411
03:08:42,180 --> 03:08:43,280
He got the car.

4412
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:44,340
What did you think of him?

4413
03:08:44,540 --> 03:08:46,360
He is just as you said.

4414
03:08:46,820 --> 03:08:51,060
In battle, he is as if possessed by a demon.

4415
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:51,480
Ghost.

4416
03:08:51,720 --> 03:08:52,740
Much like you.

4417
03:08:52,860 --> 03:08:54,780
I would expect no less.

4418
03:08:55,240 --> 03:08:55,820
You see?

4419
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:57,360
I told you so.

4420
03:08:57,620 --> 03:08:59,260
But I will kill him.

4421
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:00,880
So, General Ivan.

4422
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:03,280
I hear he took your hand as well as you.

4423
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:04,920
I hope you are happy.

4424
03:09:05,220 --> 03:09:06,820
Watch your tongue, Shaman.

4425
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:07,640
Shaman!

4426
03:09:07,640 --> 03:09:11,100
In the language of the Sioux people, Sioux means snake.

4427
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:11,700
Sioux.

4428
03:09:11,860 --> 03:09:14,040
It is known as an animal to be feared.

4429
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:17,480
Well, snake is mine now.

4430
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:21,040
When I meet him next, I'll take special care of him.

4431
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:22,960
Not yet.

4432
03:09:23,960 --> 03:09:24,600
My.

4433
03:09:26,380 --> 03:09:29,440
He and I will meet again in battle.

4434
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:30,280
Oh, yes, we will.

4435
03:09:30,660 --> 03:09:31,580
Addiction as always.

4436
03:09:32,220 --> 03:09:32,860
Yes.

4437
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:35,000
The raven on my head.

4438
03:09:35,380 --> 03:09:37,060
It thirsts for blood.

4439
03:09:37,060 --> 03:09:37,660
It thirsts for blood.

4440
03:09:46,880 --> 03:09:48,680
Wait, I wanna go...

4441
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:49,920
Yimmy.

4442
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:52,300
Defeat the M1 tank.

4443
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:54,020
Yeah.

4444
03:09:54,780 --> 03:09:56,440
Let's get this ration over here.

4445
03:09:56,840 --> 03:09:59,620
In this building, we cannot use weapons.

4446
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:08,040
I wanna go back out there and get some stuff.

4447
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:12,040
They don't install the cameras and stuff immediately, right?

4448
03:10:13,660 --> 03:10:15,360
Level 3 car, let's go!

4449
03:10:17,900 --> 03:10:18,600
Call people.

4450
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:19,620
I will, thank you.

4451
03:10:20,440 --> 03:10:23,080
But I will after we do this.

4452
03:10:26,520 --> 03:10:27,140
Okay, good.

4453
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:30,780
I'm just going to have the mine detector equipped just in case.

4454
03:10:34,550 --> 03:10:38,570
I don't remember if there actually were any rations around here.

4455
03:10:38,570 --> 03:10:39,250
But...

4456
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:42,430
Oh, is that one?

4457
03:10:43,650 --> 03:10:44,170
Yes.

4458
03:10:45,150 --> 03:10:46,550
Oh, thank goodness.

4459
03:10:46,810 --> 03:10:47,750
Wait, I want to see that view.

4460
03:10:50,950 --> 03:10:52,290
Wow, so cool!

4461
03:10:54,050 --> 03:10:55,430
So cool, so cool.

4462
03:10:56,810 --> 03:10:57,970
It's so cinematic.

4463
03:10:59,930 --> 03:11:01,850
Can you finish off the raven guy now?

4464
03:11:01,930 --> 03:11:02,730
I think he flew away.

4465
03:11:03,550 --> 03:11:06,430
I think he's like... gone, gone.

4466
03:11:08,570 --> 03:11:09,970
Can I take over the tank?

4467
03:11:10,090 --> 03:11:10,490
I wonder.

4468
03:11:11,690 --> 03:11:13,950
That'd be pretty... pretty nifty.

4469
03:11:14,370 --> 03:11:18,790
I just charge into the nuclear warhead building in my tank.

4470
03:11:18,990 --> 03:11:19,970
Newly acquired tank.

4471
03:11:22,470 --> 03:11:23,490
No worries.

4472
03:11:23,530 --> 03:11:24,270
Album cover?

4473
03:11:24,410 --> 03:11:24,750
Truly!

4474
03:11:25,090 --> 03:11:26,830
It is really like an album cover, right?

4475
03:11:28,730 --> 03:11:30,130
You're pretty good at this game?

4476
03:11:30,290 --> 03:11:31,150
You think so?

4477
03:11:32,290 --> 03:11:33,530
No, stop it.

4478
03:11:33,590 --> 03:11:34,990
Don't get my hopes up.

4479
03:11:38,830 --> 03:11:41,330
Just wait until MGS2, I promise.

4480
03:11:41,810 --> 03:11:42,630
Actually, no.

4481
03:11:42,730 --> 03:11:43,570
Wait until...

4482
03:11:46,030 --> 03:11:46,870
Psycho Mantis.

4483
03:11:50,510 --> 03:11:54,770
Wait until Psycho Mantis and then see if I'm good at this game anymore.

4484
03:11:59,320 --> 03:12:01,080
Now I can hold three rations!

4485
03:12:01,800 --> 03:12:02,280
Yippee!

4486
03:12:02,740 --> 03:12:04,540
Wait, we had one the whole time?

4487
03:12:05,060 --> 03:12:06,760
Did I accidentally unequip it?

4488
03:12:06,840 --> 03:12:07,500
Is that what happened?

4489
03:12:08,340 --> 03:12:09,980
Am I a silly goose?

4490
03:12:11,260 --> 03:12:13,700
Am I a silly... willy?

4491
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:16,540
Did I accidentally... oh my god.

4492
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:19,480
Can I, like, hide first?

4493
03:12:22,220 --> 03:12:23,660
A silly ghost?

4494
03:12:27,560 --> 03:12:28,860
Oh, I just got two.

4495
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:29,680
Okay, good.

4496
03:12:30,620 --> 03:12:31,180
Gravy!

4497
03:12:32,560 --> 03:12:33,120
Gravy!

4498
03:12:35,440 --> 03:12:37,640
We're all warheads?

4499
03:12:40,800 --> 03:12:41,960
They just leave them here?

4500
03:12:42,300 --> 03:12:43,760
It's like President Baker said.

4501
03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:45,200
Totally careless.

4502
03:12:45,560 --> 03:12:47,400
They're working on a limited budget.

4503
03:12:47,600 --> 03:12:52,200
They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.

4504
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:52,580
But...

4505
03:12:52,580 --> 03:12:54,600
Nastasha knows lots more about it than I do.

4506
03:12:54,600 --> 03:12:55,960
I have no, like, protective anything.

4507
03:12:56,240 --> 03:13:00,720
All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation mechanisms removed, so there's no fear of them exploding.

4508
03:13:00,720 --> 03:13:01,120
But, like...

4509
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:05,640
But if the warheads are broken, they might leak plutonium, and that would be a serious problem.

4510
03:13:05,740 --> 03:13:07,600
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna grow a second arm.

4511
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:09,280
Never use your weapon on that floor.

4512
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:10,560
Maybe even a third arm.

4513
03:13:11,420 --> 03:13:12,140
Who knows?

4514
03:13:13,300 --> 03:13:14,000
Okay, hold on.

4515
03:13:14,020 --> 03:13:16,260
Let me get in my box and go over here for a second.

4516
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:20,520
Okay, there he is.

4517
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:23,080
You see, they get protective stuff, but not me.

4518
03:13:24,240 --> 03:13:24,900
Don't move.

4519
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:29,880
Just a box.

4520
03:13:33,480 --> 03:13:34,200
Thanks, Faralette.

4521
03:13:45,130 --> 03:13:46,150
You sent the thing.

4522
03:13:48,030 --> 03:13:49,070
What have you got there?

4523
03:13:49,250 --> 03:13:50,250
A cardboard box?

4524
03:13:50,250 --> 03:13:51,710
Oh, I forgot to do this codec.

4525
03:13:51,710 --> 03:13:51,930
Yeah, remember that.

4526
03:13:52,090 --> 03:13:53,090
Hold on, we'll skip through it.

4527
03:13:53,090 --> 03:13:55,510
We did it earlier, in case you were like, why'd you skip it?

4528
03:13:55,990 --> 03:13:56,850
We already did it.

4529
03:13:57,230 --> 03:14:01,250
Snake, you've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich, the Metal Gear Engineer.

4530
03:14:01,350 --> 03:14:02,110
The Metal Gear Engineer.

4531
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:06,210
He's probably being held prisoner in the second-floor basement of the warhead storage building.

4532
03:14:06,830 --> 03:14:07,230
He's got a fun ring to it.

4533
03:14:07,230 --> 03:14:09,750
Snake, never use your weapon on that floor.

4534
03:14:10,690 --> 03:14:12,110
I'm not gonna listen to you.

4535
03:14:16,090 --> 03:14:17,370
What can I do for you, Snake?

4536
03:14:17,610 --> 03:14:18,510
What can I do for you, Snake?

4537
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:28,700
Second-floor basement?

4538
03:14:28,980 --> 03:14:30,680
Why is everybody in the second-floor basement?

4539
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:36,660
Snake, in China they say you must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath.

4540
03:14:36,880 --> 03:14:37,900
Do you know what that means?

4541
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:41,400
It means that the wise man avoids danger first.

4542
03:14:41,860 --> 03:14:45,100
Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.

4543
03:14:56,330 --> 03:14:58,270
A cardboard box.

4544
03:14:58,510 --> 03:14:59,390
Oh, we heard this one too.

4545
03:14:59,450 --> 03:14:59,670
Sorry.

4546
03:15:01,030 --> 03:15:02,050
What's with the box?

4547
03:15:03,250 --> 03:15:03,770
NBD.

4548
03:15:04,590 --> 03:15:05,110
NBD!

4549
03:15:05,890 --> 03:15:09,010
Snake, that is a nuclear warhead storage area.

4550
03:15:09,010 --> 03:15:09,090
I know.

4551
03:15:09,410 --> 03:15:11,630
I must never use a weapon there.

4552
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:15,190
Yes, but their detonation mechanisms have been removed.

4553
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:19,090
So I don't have to worry about this island turning into a pile of smoking rubble.

4554
03:15:19,250 --> 03:15:24,190
No, but if the casing is damaged, they may be leaking nuclear materials.

4555
03:15:24,370 --> 03:15:27,410
Please, make sure you do not use your gun around there.

4556
03:15:27,410 --> 03:15:29,550
Um, I'm more concerned about my body.

4557
03:15:29,670 --> 03:15:34,250
Like, if it's leaking nuclear materials, am I going to be okay?

4558
03:15:34,270 --> 03:15:35,290
I am exposed!

4559
03:15:36,570 --> 03:15:37,550
Excuse me!

4560
03:15:38,130 --> 03:15:40,030
A cardboard box, huh?

4561
03:15:40,330 --> 03:15:41,010
Oh, we did this one.

4562
03:15:41,070 --> 03:15:44,550
Sorry, I forgot that we're gonna get the cardboard box a bajillion times.

4563
03:15:44,970 --> 03:15:50,050
In war, a split second can mean the difference between victory and defeat.

4564
03:15:50,630 --> 03:15:52,030
Don't ever hesitate.

4565
03:15:52,350 --> 03:15:52,550
Okay.

4566
03:15:52,610 --> 03:15:56,370
The slower you react, the greater the chance that you'll be beaten.

4567
03:15:56,370 --> 03:15:57,110
Thank you, Master.

4568
03:15:57,410 --> 03:15:58,190
Thank you, Master.

4569
03:15:58,190 --> 03:15:58,690
Thank you.

4570
03:16:03,010 --> 03:16:04,310
A cardboard box?

4571
03:16:04,770 --> 03:16:08,470
I heard stories from my uncle, but I always thought he was pulling my leg.

4572
03:16:08,890 --> 03:16:10,050
I've got no comment.

4573
03:16:11,270 --> 03:16:11,670
Okay.

4574
03:16:12,590 --> 03:16:12,990
Wow.

4575
03:16:14,330 --> 03:16:15,130
Thanks, I guess.

4576
03:16:15,490 --> 03:16:16,370
Very insightful.

4577
03:16:17,390 --> 03:16:19,750
Deep Throat, do you have anything to say about my cardboard box?

4578
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:21,310
I thought you were one of my fans.

4579
03:16:22,190 --> 03:16:23,690
I thought you would like my box.

4580
03:16:23,790 --> 03:16:25,050
I thought you said you were one of my fans.

4581
03:16:26,810 --> 03:16:31,010
Should I put a... I'm stuck on the wall?

4582
03:16:33,610 --> 03:16:34,090
Wait.

4583
03:16:35,270 --> 03:16:36,330
Oh, there he is!

4584
03:16:39,810 --> 03:16:42,150
He comes down and around.

4585
03:16:43,370 --> 03:16:44,650
I'll wait for him to go around.

4586
03:16:46,610 --> 03:16:48,270
Show you my box, please respond.

4587
03:16:50,610 --> 03:16:51,650
No, don't respond.

4588
03:16:51,970 --> 03:16:53,510
Don't look... don't look in my direction.

4589
03:16:53,750 --> 03:16:54,890
Don't even notice...

4590
03:16:54,890 --> 03:16:55,410
Oh.

4591
03:16:57,410 --> 03:16:58,410
Just a box.

4592
03:16:58,510 --> 03:16:59,050
Just a box.

4593
03:17:03,190 --> 03:17:07,170
Continue on your merry way.

4594
03:17:12,870 --> 03:17:13,990
Where's the guy upstairs?

4595
03:17:14,470 --> 03:17:16,070
Oh gosh, this is difficult.

4596
03:17:16,410 --> 03:17:18,430
Oh god, I can't see at all.

4597
03:17:20,850 --> 03:17:21,490
There we go.

4598
03:17:22,390 --> 03:17:23,530
I think I just gotta go.

4599
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:34,180
This guy doesn't come down the stairs, alright?

4600
03:17:36,380 --> 03:17:36,820
Okay.

4601
03:17:40,770 --> 03:17:41,210
Turn around.

4602
03:17:45,310 --> 03:17:46,370
Say there, you're good?

4603
03:17:46,510 --> 03:17:46,730
Okay.

4604
03:17:47,630 --> 03:17:48,150
Thank you.

4605
03:17:49,290 --> 03:17:52,130
Like I said, I couldn't remember if he came downstairs or not.

4606
03:17:52,630 --> 03:17:55,110
And he stops... somewhere.

4607
03:17:58,440 --> 03:17:59,800
And then he goes to the left.

4608
03:18:01,560 --> 03:18:01,940
Yes.

4609
03:18:03,980 --> 03:18:04,360
Books!

4610
03:18:17,510 --> 03:18:17,890
Oh!

4611
03:18:17,970 --> 03:18:20,190
Wait, I've gotta go to... oh wait, I've gotta go to B2.

4612
03:18:20,190 --> 03:18:22,170
Two, so then I can be like, oh my god!

4613
03:18:23,690 --> 03:18:24,090
Two!

4614
03:18:25,070 --> 03:18:25,830
Thank you!

4615
03:18:27,210 --> 03:18:30,810
I started saying, me dominto, like, side-o-chest-o, and I can't stop.

4616
03:18:33,910 --> 03:18:37,090
Yeah, we gotta go here so we can be like, oh my god, it's gas!

4617
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:39,010
We gotta get the Nikita missile!

4618
03:18:40,410 --> 03:18:41,350
Nikita missile time!

4619
03:18:46,030 --> 03:18:49,330
Gosh, the music in here is so... awesome.

4620
03:18:55,490 --> 03:18:58,910
Danger, danger.

4621
03:19:04,740 --> 03:19:06,460
Leaning on Otacon's wall is fine.

4622
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:07,600
Oh yes, we should do that.

4623
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:09,320
And I'm gonna knock on it.

4624
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:15,060
Oh my gosh, we're gonna get that seed!

4625
03:19:16,400 --> 03:19:17,080
Ah, hold on!

4626
03:19:17,260 --> 03:19:17,960
I can't breathe!

4627
03:19:18,320 --> 03:19:18,700
Cardo!

4628
03:19:19,580 --> 03:19:19,960
Deep throat!

4629
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:26,820
You destroyed the high-voltage switch.

4630
03:19:26,960 --> 03:19:28,900
It's the switchboard on the northwest wall.

4631
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:30,500
It really didn't want Otacon getting out.

4632
03:19:30,520 --> 03:19:31,120
For now, I can't reach it.

4633
03:19:31,200 --> 03:19:32,920
Use a remote-controlled missile.

4634
03:19:33,960 --> 03:19:34,400
Okay!

4635
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:36,300
I gotta let me out so I can breathe!

4636
03:19:36,760 --> 03:19:37,200
Okay.

4637
03:19:37,860 --> 03:19:38,300
Okay.

4638
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:40,880
So we have to go...

4639
03:19:41,580 --> 03:19:42,940
First, we gotta talk to him.

4640
03:19:46,040 --> 03:19:46,940
Do-do-do-do!

4641
03:19:49,080 --> 03:19:49,520
Hey!

4642
03:19:49,520 --> 03:19:49,960
Hey!

4643
03:19:51,420 --> 03:19:51,860
Hey!

4644
03:19:52,140 --> 03:19:52,800
Hey-hey-hey!

4645
03:19:53,640 --> 03:19:54,580
Hey-hey-hey!

4646
03:19:55,820 --> 03:19:57,140
Hey-hey-hey!

4647
03:19:57,640 --> 03:19:58,300
Hey-hey-hey!

4648
03:19:58,300 --> 03:19:58,980
Do-do-do-do!

4649
03:19:59,080 --> 03:20:00,860
I can't wait for that scene with Liquid.

4650
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:02,540
When he goes do-do-do-do!

4651
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:09,580
Okay, uh, let's call everybody and they are gonna tell me to go back all the way to the, uh...

4652
03:20:10,170 --> 03:20:12,840
To the... that other... basement.

4653
03:20:13,260 --> 03:20:14,240
B2 basement.

4654
03:20:15,050 --> 03:20:18,180
For the time being, let's trust what Deep Throat told us.

4655
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:26,300
Use a remote-controlled missile to destroy the switchboard in the northwest section of the Warhead Storage Building's second floor basement.

4656
03:20:26,880 --> 03:20:31,040
Make sure your remote-controlled missile doesn't get shot down by those gun cameras.

4657
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:33,140
Okay...

4658
03:20:34,140 --> 03:20:35,920
Master... at the back trap...

4659
03:20:40,400 --> 03:20:41,920
I have a question.

4660
03:20:45,460 --> 03:20:47,460
Could I have just gone in?

4661
03:20:47,740 --> 03:20:50,600
Wait, should I... could I have just gone and got it?

4662
03:20:50,600 --> 03:20:54,100
And then... done the... cutscene?

4663
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:56,020
And already had the Nikita missile?

4664
03:21:01,180 --> 03:21:01,720
Yes.

4665
03:21:02,360 --> 03:21:04,680
Yeah, once you have the level 3 card...

4666
03:21:05,460 --> 03:21:06,180
It's okay.

4667
03:21:07,360 --> 03:21:10,360
We're... we're doing it like we've never played the game before.

4668
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:11,280
Oh wait, yeah.

4669
03:21:11,580 --> 03:21:12,600
We're... we're...

4670
03:21:15,320 --> 03:21:17,300
I did that on my playthrough.

4671
03:21:17,880 --> 03:21:21,460
We're... we're being accurate as if we have never played the game before.

4672
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:23,740
First playthrough roleplay.

4673
03:21:23,900 --> 03:21:25,040
Yeah, exactly.

4674
03:21:25,400 --> 03:21:26,540
The intended path.

4675
03:21:31,670 --> 03:21:32,290
Turn around?

4676
03:21:33,970 --> 03:21:35,490
Turn around...

4677
03:21:35,490 --> 03:21:36,050
Oh, nope.

4678
03:21:45,400 --> 03:21:48,480
This is... it's for the authentic first-timer experience.

4679
03:21:48,920 --> 03:21:49,560
Experience.

4680
03:21:49,780 --> 03:21:50,540
Satsugaminto.

4681
03:21:50,800 --> 03:21:51,560
Yeah!

4682
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:53,860
Now

4683
03:21:58,110 --> 03:22:23,750
and then I get a little bit lonely And you're never coming round Turn around Every now and then I get a little bit tired Of listening to the sound of my toes Turn around Every now and then I get a little bit something That the best of all our years have gone by Turn around Every now and then I get a little...

4684
03:22:25,310 --> 03:23:03,390
And then I see the look in your eye Turn around For right eyes Every now and then I fall apart Turn around For right eyes Every now and then I fall apart And I need you now, tonight And I need you more than ever And if you only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever And you'll only be making it right Cause you'll never be brought to...

4685
03:23:06,530 --> 03:23:07,570
U.S.

4686
03:23:07,570 --> 03:23:11,610
nuclear warheads and wastes have never been left neglected, with very few exceptions.

4687
03:23:12,110 --> 03:23:12,630
Oh.

4688
03:23:14,110 --> 03:23:14,630
Cool.

4689
03:23:14,790 --> 03:23:15,350
Anyway, enjoy.

4690
03:23:15,650 --> 03:23:17,610
Thanks for the... thanks for the tip.

4691
03:23:18,190 --> 03:23:19,050
You're pretty good.

4692
03:23:19,770 --> 03:23:20,290
Huey.

4693
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:23,110
Hi Huey.

4694
03:23:24,190 --> 03:23:26,390
Wait, so now it's turned off though, right?

4695
03:23:27,290 --> 03:23:29,310
And the other tank is gone, right?

4696
03:23:31,190 --> 03:23:31,930
Unless, wait.

4697
03:23:33,010 --> 03:23:36,050
The tank that I just shot down was the one that they used.

4698
03:23:36,310 --> 03:23:36,670
Never mind.

4699
03:23:38,570 --> 03:23:39,670
Thanks for the super chat.

4700
03:23:40,190 --> 03:23:40,630
Huey.

4701
03:23:42,910 --> 03:23:44,430
It's turned off now though, right?

4702
03:23:45,530 --> 03:23:46,450
Please say yes.

4703
03:23:46,590 --> 03:23:46,990
No!

4704
03:23:47,970 --> 03:23:48,410
Why?

4705
03:23:50,490 --> 03:23:51,670
This is so cruel.

4706
03:23:52,970 --> 03:23:55,730
At least it's like kind of easy to get to the...

4707
03:23:58,030 --> 03:24:00,550
To the elevator from here.

4708
03:24:01,210 --> 03:24:03,110
But I gotta get the thermal goggles.

4709
03:24:04,010 --> 03:24:06,210
I know, I gotta get the thermal goggles.

4710
03:24:07,230 --> 03:24:08,710
Someone's gotta go get the thermal goggles.

4711
03:24:16,740 --> 03:24:17,700
Where is that guy?

4712
03:24:17,960 --> 03:24:18,660
Oh, there he is.

4713
03:24:18,940 --> 03:24:20,560
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4714
03:24:22,280 --> 03:24:23,560
He can't see me though, right?

4715
03:24:34,530 --> 03:24:35,530
I'm kinda pretty good at that.

4716
03:24:35,950 --> 03:24:37,410
Thanks for the super chat!

4717
03:24:38,590 --> 03:24:39,430
There's a super...

4718
03:24:39,430 --> 03:24:40,790
Sorry, I didn't mean to pause it like that.

4719
03:24:40,790 --> 03:24:42,530
There's a super neat show called Over the Garden.

4720
03:24:42,570 --> 03:24:43,710
Wow, I think you'd really like it.

4721
03:24:43,770 --> 03:24:44,930
We should all watch it later this fall.

4722
03:24:45,050 --> 03:24:46,230
I love that!

4723
03:24:46,690 --> 03:24:47,810
I love that show.

4724
03:24:50,170 --> 03:24:51,210
Thanks for the super chat.

4725
03:24:51,370 --> 03:24:52,130
We should watch it.

4726
03:24:54,710 --> 03:24:57,390
That singing got me melting like Tuskaku.

4727
03:25:00,190 --> 03:25:01,670
I think you need level 4.

4728
03:25:01,850 --> 03:25:02,390
Okay, never mind.

4729
03:25:03,890 --> 03:25:05,790
Can anybody attest to that?

4730
03:25:05,950 --> 03:25:06,270
Oh wait.

4731
03:25:06,770 --> 03:25:08,670
I always press that instead of...

4732
03:25:08,670 --> 03:25:09,490
Can I see it from here?

4733
03:25:09,490 --> 03:25:10,670
It is 4!

4734
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:11,450
It is 4!

4735
03:25:11,550 --> 03:25:11,930
It is 4!

4736
03:25:12,310 --> 03:25:13,610
You can see it from down here.

4737
03:25:14,950 --> 03:25:15,930
It says 4.

4738
03:25:16,430 --> 03:25:17,110
I think.

4739
03:25:19,310 --> 03:25:20,270
It says...

4740
03:25:21,850 --> 03:25:22,330
4.

4741
03:25:22,910 --> 03:25:23,910
It says 4.

4742
03:25:24,410 --> 03:25:25,250
It says 4.

4743
03:25:25,410 --> 03:25:26,270
You saved me.

4744
03:25:26,350 --> 03:25:27,010
You really saved me.

4745
03:25:27,210 --> 03:25:27,510
Thank you, thank you.

4746
03:25:28,250 --> 03:25:29,490
Whoever said that.

4747
03:25:37,830 --> 03:25:38,310
Okay.

4748
03:25:38,730 --> 03:25:40,330
Second floor basement.

4749
03:25:42,350 --> 03:25:43,970
And don't get caught in here.

4750
03:25:44,290 --> 03:25:44,770
Okay.

4751
03:25:45,070 --> 03:25:45,450
Okay.

4752
03:25:52,880 --> 03:25:56,140
Wait, unless you get it at the beginning of the game before the DARPA Chief.

4753
03:25:56,400 --> 03:25:57,320
How do you get it?

4754
03:25:57,340 --> 03:26:01,220
Is it actually a glitch or is it just like something...

4755
03:26:01,600 --> 03:26:02,380
Way to get it.

4756
03:26:05,140 --> 03:26:07,560
Guys, I don't remember at all which one have the .

4757
03:26:08,860 --> 03:26:12,980
Remember, earlier, I was like we should look at these and memorize which one is what.

4758
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:15,660
No, it's the front middle one.

4759
03:26:17,480 --> 03:26:21,080
Because the top left one was the PSG.

4760
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:23,640
Top middle was the Nikita.

4761
03:26:23,900 --> 03:26:29,100
Which means we're going to have to come all the way back here.

4762
03:26:30,020 --> 03:26:32,260
The door is four but open before the...

4763
03:26:32,260 --> 03:26:33,360
Okay, okay, okay.

4764
03:26:33,600 --> 03:26:37,040
The thermal goggles door is open if you enter the hangar from the top vent.

4765
03:26:37,740 --> 03:26:39,840
Oh, I never go through the top vent.

4766
03:26:39,980 --> 03:26:40,800
That's why I don't know.

4767
03:26:42,940 --> 03:26:44,040
That's why I don't know.

4768
03:26:44,060 --> 03:26:45,580
I never go through the top vent.

4769
03:26:47,240 --> 03:26:51,200
I'm just going to wait for these guys to leave.

4770
03:27:02,380 --> 03:27:03,660
Can they hear me?

4771
03:27:03,820 --> 03:27:05,560
Can they hear me footsteps?

4772
03:27:07,300 --> 03:27:08,120
Wait a second.

4773
03:27:09,520 --> 03:27:10,760
Okay, we're going to go this way instead.

4774
03:27:12,500 --> 03:27:13,840
Don't drop and die.

4775
03:27:15,880 --> 03:27:16,700
That was close.

4776
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:19,340
That was really close.

4777
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:21,580
It's this one.

4778
03:27:29,240 --> 03:27:30,220
I don't trust it.

4779
03:27:33,620 --> 03:27:34,820
Wait, this is the C4!

4780
03:27:36,320 --> 03:27:37,620
Where is the Nikita missile then?

4781
03:27:48,750 --> 03:27:50,730
Wait, it's B1 of the nuclear storage.

4782
03:27:50,810 --> 03:27:51,590
I thought it was in here.

4783
03:27:55,350 --> 03:27:56,430
Wait, I thought it was in here.

4784
03:27:56,870 --> 03:27:58,110
Why did I come all the way back then?

4785
03:27:58,930 --> 03:28:00,110
I thought it was in the other building.

4786
03:28:00,110 --> 03:28:00,730
What?

4787
03:28:03,350 --> 03:28:04,270
It's in both.

4788
03:28:10,260 --> 03:28:11,440
Oh my god.

4789
03:28:12,980 --> 03:28:15,380
I knew I... Oh, I misremembered.

4790
03:28:15,900 --> 03:28:19,040
It's always the dang card levels that get me.

4791
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,120
Are you kidding me?

4792
03:28:21,320 --> 03:28:23,060
You did the same in the third season?

4793
03:28:26,280 --> 03:28:28,300
It's always the card levels that get me.

4794
03:28:28,660 --> 03:28:30,860
No, so it's a level 4 card here.

4795
03:28:31,300 --> 03:28:32,500
Oh my god, hold on.

4796
03:28:33,800 --> 03:28:34,600
No way.

4797
03:28:34,780 --> 03:28:35,920
That's so funny.

4798
03:28:36,200 --> 03:28:37,800
It gets me every time.

4799
03:28:38,180 --> 03:28:39,200
First time playing!

4800
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:42,880
Why didn't you guys stop me from leaving the building then?

4801
03:28:46,760 --> 03:28:48,020
Oh my gosh.

4802
03:28:48,340 --> 03:28:49,440
I'm a silly goose.

4803
03:28:54,390 --> 03:28:54,870
Wait!

4804
03:29:04,370 --> 03:29:05,210
Is it this one?

4805
03:29:07,990 --> 03:29:08,910
I can't remember.

4806
03:29:09,690 --> 03:29:11,050
La la la la la.

4807
03:29:13,350 --> 03:29:15,850
You guys, we can do either one.

4808
03:29:16,630 --> 03:29:17,630
Gosh.

4809
03:29:19,870 --> 03:29:21,010
Don't scare me like that.

4810
03:29:27,940 --> 03:29:29,440
You guys.

4811
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:37,280
Oh my gosh.

4812
03:29:37,520 --> 03:29:38,760
I thought so.

4813
03:29:39,280 --> 03:29:40,420
I thought so.

4814
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:43,500
I'm not crazy.

4815
03:29:44,240 --> 03:29:44,640
Sometimes.

4816
03:29:45,460 --> 03:29:46,180
All the time.

4817
03:29:58,270 --> 03:29:58,930
Come on, elevator.

4818
03:29:59,470 --> 03:30:00,390
You were just here.

4819
03:30:00,510 --> 03:30:01,330
You were just here.

4820
03:30:01,490 --> 03:30:02,310
No one used it.

4821
03:30:02,410 --> 03:30:03,070
No one used it.

4822
03:30:08,670 --> 03:30:11,830
But we'll have to come back here again anyway because we have to get the PSG.

4823
03:30:15,410 --> 03:30:16,210
Do do do.

4824
03:30:17,730 --> 03:30:18,390
Do do.

4825
03:30:19,090 --> 03:30:19,490
Saving.

4826
03:30:22,320 --> 03:30:23,100
La la la la.

4827
03:30:23,780 --> 03:30:24,220
Come

4828
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:30,360
on, everybody.

4829
03:30:30,620 --> 03:30:31,680
I'm just a simple...

4830
03:30:31,680 --> 03:30:33,260
Oh, I almost went.

4831
03:30:33,780 --> 03:30:35,060
Thinking that it was...

4832
03:30:36,440 --> 03:30:37,100
Done-zo.

4833
03:30:38,220 --> 03:30:39,340
Wait, I can't see it.

4834
03:30:39,440 --> 03:30:39,880
Oh, there it is.

4835
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:40,040
Okay.

4836
03:30:40,920 --> 03:30:42,040
Nice and slow.

4837
03:30:46,310 --> 03:30:46,750
Fast.

4838
03:30:49,730 --> 03:30:50,170
Thinking

4839
03:30:59,890 --> 03:31:01,430
you kept those cigarettes in your stomach.

4840
03:31:03,830 --> 03:31:04,690
Stummy-ciggies.

4841
03:31:09,010 --> 03:31:12,590
Your stamina, physique must be in top condition to actually walk around a car by bike.

4842
03:31:12,590 --> 03:31:13,610
Or a cardboard box like that.

4843
03:31:13,670 --> 03:31:14,070
Right?

4844
03:31:14,530 --> 03:31:17,250
You were crouched the whole time.

4845
03:31:18,350 --> 03:31:22,870
It's actually quite impressive the way that...

4846
03:31:22,870 --> 03:31:25,110
Gosh, I wish these would respawn.

4847
03:31:26,630 --> 03:31:32,510
It's really impressive the way Snake can actually run with it.

4848
03:31:32,670 --> 03:31:34,630
I mean, that's why he's...

4849
03:31:35,450 --> 03:31:36,670
Oh, I just real...

4850
03:31:36,670 --> 03:31:38,070
Sorry, I just noticed my cursor.

4851
03:31:38,410 --> 03:31:40,530
That's why he's like the greatest...

4852
03:31:40,530 --> 03:31:41,030
He's the legend.

4853
03:31:41,030 --> 03:31:41,930
He's a legend!

4854
03:31:41,930 --> 03:31:41,930
He's a legend!

4855
03:31:44,570 --> 03:31:46,350
That's why his butt's so big.

4856
03:31:52,550 --> 03:31:59,030
The cardboard box is like bopping up and down against his fat ass as he runs.

4857
03:32:00,270 --> 03:32:02,210
My fat ass.

4858
03:32:02,250 --> 03:32:02,710
Mei Ling.

4859
03:32:04,070 --> 03:32:06,550
My cake is just too thick.

4860
03:32:06,870 --> 03:32:07,650
It's clapping.

4861
03:32:08,630 --> 03:32:09,530
How's it going, Snake?

4862
03:32:09,770 --> 03:32:11,570
Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?

4863
03:32:11,710 --> 03:32:12,030
I think so.

4864
03:32:12,270 --> 03:32:13,330
Yeah, it's a great system.

4865
03:32:13,590 --> 03:32:17,710
Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys, too.

4866
03:32:17,890 --> 03:32:18,330
So awesome.

4867
03:32:18,350 --> 03:32:19,150
Pretty convenient, huh?

4868
03:32:19,510 --> 03:32:22,090
It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.

4869
03:32:22,410 --> 03:32:23,570
You're watching everything?

4870
03:32:24,030 --> 03:32:24,550
Of course.

4871
03:32:25,030 --> 03:32:27,990
If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.

4872
03:32:28,290 --> 03:32:31,390
Being monitored 24 hours a day, that'd be like hell.

4873
03:32:31,670 --> 03:32:32,570
Don't think of it like that.

4874
03:32:32,570 --> 03:32:33,650
What are you trying to do, huh, Snake?

4875
03:32:33,750 --> 03:32:34,570
At least you'd never get lost.

4876
03:32:34,870 --> 03:32:36,830
You don't want people to monitor you for, huh?

4877
03:32:37,650 --> 03:32:37,930
What are you doing?

4878
03:32:40,710 --> 03:32:44,090
For the time being, let's trust what Deepthroat told us.

4879
03:32:44,190 --> 03:32:44,610
I am.

4880
03:32:44,710 --> 03:32:46,230
Use a remote-controlled missile.

4881
03:32:46,570 --> 03:32:48,250
Yeah, Warhead stor- oh.

4882
03:32:50,390 --> 03:32:51,030
Oh no!

4883
03:32:51,190 --> 03:32:54,590
It says to destroy the switchboard in the northwest section of the Warhead.

4884
03:32:54,670 --> 03:32:55,130
Okay, okay.

4885
03:32:55,250 --> 03:32:55,990
I was like, wait a second.

4886
03:32:56,110 --> 03:32:57,270
The Warhead storage building.

4887
03:32:57,450 --> 03:32:58,170
Second floor basement.

4888
03:32:58,430 --> 03:33:00,250
No, that's where we were!

4889
03:33:00,570 --> 03:33:02,110
That's where it's at, you guys!

4890
03:33:03,190 --> 03:33:03,670
Gosh.

4891
03:33:03,670 --> 03:33:03,790
Oh my gosh.

4892
03:33:06,930 --> 03:33:13,830
I lived near a nuclear facility as a kid and recently found out they kept all the enriched uranium in a six-year-old wooden warehouse!

4893
03:33:16,830 --> 03:33:18,170
You're Spider-Man.

4894
03:33:19,010 --> 03:33:19,890
I think.

4895
03:33:20,090 --> 03:33:20,590
Probably.

4896
03:33:21,250 --> 03:33:25,070
They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.

4897
03:33:25,070 --> 03:33:27,310
How can you watch Golden Girls if someone's watching?

4898
03:33:27,310 --> 03:33:31,910
After the end of the Cold War, the demands for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.

4899
03:33:31,910 --> 03:33:36,850
In the Eastern Bloc countries in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.

4900
03:33:36,950 --> 03:33:37,270
That's me.

4901
03:33:37,430 --> 03:33:38,330
Every day.

4902
03:33:38,510 --> 03:33:39,790
I have a brain drain.

4903
03:33:40,110 --> 03:33:41,890
And each year, more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.

4904
03:33:41,890 --> 03:33:44,210
That was me last night in the collab with Doki.

4905
03:33:44,870 --> 03:33:46,090
True brain drain.

4906
03:33:49,750 --> 03:33:54,030
When you're trying to hide, avoid places that look like the enemy might search.

4907
03:33:54,330 --> 03:33:58,490
Think about how your enemy is going to move and then sneak in there.

4908
03:33:58,930 --> 03:34:00,870
Doesn't matter how smart you are.

4909
03:34:01,010 --> 03:34:01,890
Just use your brain.

4910
03:34:01,910 --> 03:34:02,790
Use your head out there.

4911
03:34:02,990 --> 03:34:04,450
Are you telling me I'm dumb, Master?

4912
03:34:06,070 --> 03:34:07,170
What do you mean by that?

4913
03:34:10,350 --> 03:34:11,210
Deep throat?

4914
03:34:11,730 --> 03:34:14,330
No, I don't know anyone who calls himself that.

4915
03:34:14,610 --> 03:34:15,250
I see.

4916
03:34:15,750 --> 03:34:17,810
I wonder why he's trying to help you.

4917
03:34:18,290 --> 03:34:19,390
I have no idea.

4918
03:34:19,810 --> 03:34:20,510
A trap?

4919
03:34:20,950 --> 03:34:21,630
Could be.

4920
03:34:21,810 --> 03:34:23,890
But for the time being, I'll have to trust him.

4921
03:34:25,050 --> 03:34:25,670
Okay, bye.

4922
03:34:28,370 --> 03:34:29,010
Here we go.

4923
03:34:40,430 --> 03:34:42,310
I've got to get the other box in there too.

4924
03:34:42,690 --> 03:34:43,610
It's in there, right?

4925
03:34:44,730 --> 03:34:47,030
But most crucially for stealth...

4926
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:47,630
Box.

4927
03:34:48,970 --> 03:34:49,790
Where's the other guy?

4928
03:34:50,610 --> 03:34:51,590
There's a guy up there.

4929
03:34:52,170 --> 03:34:53,290
Where's the guy that loops around?

4930
03:34:53,350 --> 03:34:53,710
Oh, there he is.

4931
03:34:56,190 --> 03:34:56,610
Hello.

4932
03:34:58,110 --> 03:34:58,530
Hello.

4933
03:35:03,180 --> 03:35:06,680
Oh gosh, the sound of their footsteps is just true ASMR.

4934
03:35:28,120 --> 03:35:30,160
Oh gosh, the sound of their footsteps is just true ASMR.

4935
03:35:30,160 --> 03:35:30,260
Oh gosh, the sound of their footsteps is just true ASMR.

4936
03:35:30,260 --> 03:35:31,740
Is that like feet ASMR confirmed?

4937
03:35:32,140 --> 03:35:33,480
Oh no, I love feet ASMR.

4938
03:35:34,720 --> 03:35:35,600
Like, uh...

4939
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:38,120
Have you guys ever listened to the...

4940
03:35:38,120 --> 03:35:38,860
The...

4941
03:35:38,860 --> 03:35:41,480
The way they walk in Barbie movies?

4942
03:35:41,820 --> 03:35:43,160
It's so crisp.

4943
03:35:43,620 --> 03:35:45,640
It's so like...

4944
03:35:46,380 --> 03:35:47,420
It's just...

4945
03:35:47,420 --> 03:35:49,800
It just really hits the spot.

4946
03:35:50,140 --> 03:35:52,340
Like I said, it's just so like...

4947
03:35:53,800 --> 03:35:54,400
Oh,

4948
03:36:04,440 --> 03:36:05,280
wrong button.

4949
03:36:05,620 --> 03:36:06,000
There we go.

4950
03:36:15,390 --> 03:36:18,010
I swear if you look up like...

4951
03:36:19,030 --> 03:36:20,770
If you look up like Barbie movie...

4952
03:36:21,990 --> 03:36:23,350
Footstep sounds...

4953
03:36:23,350 --> 03:36:25,190
I'm sure there's a video of it.

4954
03:36:25,290 --> 03:36:25,890
It's like...

4955
03:36:25,890 --> 03:36:29,190
It's a popular thing that people talk about.

4956
03:36:29,450 --> 03:36:30,090
I promise.

4957
03:36:30,590 --> 03:36:32,090
The Barbie...

4958
03:36:33,230 --> 03:36:34,590
The Barbie...

4959
03:36:34,590 --> 03:36:37,210
Feet are what everybody is on about.

4960
03:36:37,690 --> 03:36:38,550
I swear.

4961
03:36:38,930 --> 03:36:40,990
Took huge psychic damage yesterday...

4962
03:36:40,990 --> 03:36:42,170
When someone pointed out...

4963
03:36:42,170 --> 03:36:44,350
That after you make a joke...

4964
03:36:44,350 --> 03:36:45,810
Doki often repeats the joke.

4965
03:36:45,910 --> 03:36:46,850
And compared it to...

4966
03:36:49,030 --> 03:36:49,710
No way, really?

4967
03:36:51,210 --> 03:36:51,970
Nah.

4968
03:36:53,410 --> 03:36:54,470
Also, Nano.

4969
03:36:54,570 --> 03:36:56,530
I saw that you started clipping the...

4970
03:36:56,530 --> 03:36:57,570
Twin snakes.

4971
03:37:00,950 --> 03:37:03,330
Do you plan on doing...

4972
03:37:03,330 --> 03:37:05,070
All the Metal Gear games?

4973
03:37:07,450 --> 03:37:08,830
If so...

4974
03:37:09,590 --> 03:37:10,770
I'm really sorry.

4975
03:37:13,470 --> 03:37:14,890
I'm really really...

4976
03:37:14,890 --> 03:37:16,810
Solid bird.

4977
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:20,790
What a terrible name.

4978
03:37:20,890 --> 03:37:21,610
Solid bird.

4979
03:37:21,910 --> 03:37:23,950
Alright, hold on.

4980
03:37:24,050 --> 03:37:25,210
Before we...

4981
03:37:25,210 --> 03:37:27,230
Oh shoot, I only have eight.

4982
03:37:27,730 --> 03:37:29,050
Press the X button.

4983
03:37:30,390 --> 03:37:32,150
And then I just let her rip.

4984
03:37:33,270 --> 03:37:33,790
Okay.

4985
03:37:43,200 --> 03:37:43,900
Oh gosh.

4986
03:37:44,020 --> 03:37:45,320
I forgot there's no first person.

4987
03:37:45,480 --> 03:37:46,880
Oh my god.

4988
03:37:48,180 --> 03:37:49,420
Now I remember.

4989
03:37:49,420 --> 03:37:49,680
Okay.

4990
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:54,320
Go!

4991
03:37:54,520 --> 03:37:54,660
Go!

4992
03:37:54,700 --> 03:37:54,820
Go!

4993
03:37:54,820 --> 03:37:54,940
Go!

4994
03:37:54,960 --> 03:37:55,580
Don't get caught!

4995
03:37:55,660 --> 03:37:56,000
Don't get caught!

4996
03:38:06,420 --> 03:38:06,820
Yippee!

4997
03:38:13,980 --> 03:38:14,380
Run!

4998
03:38:14,460 --> 03:38:14,540
Run!

4999
03:38:14,620 --> 03:38:14,760
Run!

5000
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:14,960
Run!

5001
03:38:15,100 --> 03:38:15,100
Run!

5002
03:38:15,140 --> 03:38:15,280
Run!

5003
03:38:15,480 --> 03:38:15,880
Run!

5004
03:38:17,040 --> 03:38:17,440
Okay.

5005
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:22,000
Easy.

5006
03:38:22,300 --> 03:38:23,040
Easy peasy.

5007
03:38:23,480 --> 03:38:26,040
I remember when I couldn't ever even find that.

5008
03:38:26,220 --> 03:38:28,020
I'd be like... Where the hell is it?

5009
03:38:28,840 --> 03:38:30,200
Can I go in here?

5010
03:38:31,180 --> 03:38:31,740
Yes.

5011
03:38:33,700 --> 03:38:34,260
Yippee!

5012
03:38:35,860 --> 03:38:38,260
And the gas mask is in this one?

5013
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:39,400
Nope.

5014
03:38:39,400 --> 03:38:41,160
The gas mask is in...

5015
03:38:42,120 --> 03:38:43,000
This one.

5016
03:38:43,660 --> 03:38:44,760
Should I chaff?

5017
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:47,180
Okay, hold on.

5018
03:38:48,680 --> 03:38:50,460
I think I should chaff though, right?

5019
03:38:53,240 --> 03:38:53,800
Probably.

5020
03:38:58,040 --> 03:38:58,900
Let's chaff it up, bro.

5021
03:38:59,180 --> 03:39:00,520
Let's chaff it up!

5022
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:04,500
Yippee!

5023
03:39:04,620 --> 03:39:04,760
Yippee!

5024
03:39:04,880 --> 03:39:05,060
Yippee!

5025
03:39:05,060 --> 03:39:05,300
Yippee!

5026
03:39:05,300 --> 03:39:05,540
Yippee!

5027
03:39:16,240 --> 03:39:17,740
Let's chaff it up!

5028
03:39:17,820 --> 03:39:22,760
I don't even know if I can go into the other ones.

5029
03:39:29,310 --> 03:39:30,370
The gas mask.

5030
03:39:31,890 --> 03:39:32,750
Oh come on!

5031
03:39:32,850 --> 03:39:33,610
Oh come on!

5032
03:39:35,590 --> 03:39:37,830
I don't want to waste all my chaffs, bro.

5033
03:39:39,450 --> 03:39:41,290
I don't want to waste all my chaffs, bro.

5034
03:39:41,290 --> 03:39:42,490
Beep boop boop with the trap, you're so right.

5035
03:39:46,430 --> 03:39:47,070
I'm going

5036
03:39:50,260 --> 03:39:51,780
to kill myself.

5037
03:39:51,980 --> 03:39:53,140
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

5038
03:39:53,580 --> 03:39:54,080
You know what?

5039
03:39:54,160 --> 03:39:55,460
Let's just... let's just call it here.

5040
03:39:57,780 --> 03:39:58,420
Oh god.

5041
03:39:58,480 --> 03:39:58,960
Run, run, run!

5042
03:39:59,060 --> 03:39:59,340
Oh!

5043
03:39:59,360 --> 03:39:59,820
My gas mask!

5044
03:40:17,630 --> 03:40:19,430
I didn't get the other ration, though.

5045
03:40:19,430 --> 03:40:19,570
Oh...

5046
03:40:21,070 --> 03:40:22,990
You can blow up the cameras with Nikita.

5047
03:40:23,210 --> 03:40:23,710
You can?

5048
03:40:24,270 --> 03:40:25,430
Can you go upwards?

5049
03:40:27,390 --> 03:40:28,150
Excited for Delta?

5050
03:40:28,330 --> 03:40:29,010
I am...

5051
03:40:30,010 --> 03:40:31,250
super duper excited!

5052
03:40:32,790 --> 03:40:34,750
So, so, so excited!

5053
03:40:39,470 --> 03:40:40,410
Oh, come on.

5054
03:40:40,550 --> 03:40:41,130
That's cheap.

5055
03:40:45,670 --> 03:40:46,550
Oh, Stinger!

5056
03:40:46,870 --> 03:40:49,410
I was going to say, I don't think you can do it with the Nikita, right?

5057
03:40:49,430 --> 03:40:50,790
Oh, wait.

5058
03:40:53,150 --> 03:40:54,190
What does that say?

5059
03:40:54,690 --> 03:40:55,690
How's lab?

5060
03:40:56,130 --> 03:40:57,110
Keep out?

5061
03:40:57,210 --> 03:40:58,810
Wait, I've never noticed that before!

5062
03:41:00,770 --> 03:41:01,870
That's so funny.

5063
03:41:05,220 --> 03:41:05,810
How's lab?

5064
03:41:05,930 --> 03:41:06,530
Keep out!

5065
03:41:11,810 --> 03:41:14,450
And now for one of my favorite scenes...

5066
03:41:14,450 --> 03:41:16,250
in the whole...

5067
03:41:16,250 --> 03:41:17,050
game.

5068
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:21,230
One of my favorite scenes...

5069
03:41:21,230 --> 03:41:22,790
in the whole, whole...

5070
03:41:22,790 --> 03:41:23,190
game.

5071
03:41:23,750 --> 03:41:25,280
Oh wait, I need a...

5072
03:41:26,190 --> 03:41:28,370
I love this part so much.

5073
03:41:28,970 --> 03:41:31,290
Oh, I love this part so...

5074
03:41:31,290 --> 03:41:32,330
much!

5075
03:41:33,770 --> 03:41:34,850
Okay, sorry.

5076
03:41:35,470 --> 03:41:36,790
I'm getting excited.

5077
03:41:37,270 --> 03:41:37,670
Hahaha!

5078
03:41:51,380 --> 03:41:52,700
It looks like...

5079
03:41:52,700 --> 03:41:54,800
they were cut by some type of blade.

5080
03:41:56,960 --> 03:41:58,100
What's this BL?

5081
03:42:03,640 --> 03:42:04,200
What's this?

5082
03:42:11,280 --> 03:42:11,840
...

5083
03:42:11,840 --> 03:42:11,920
...

5084
03:42:11,920 --> 03:42:12,120
...

5085
03:42:12,120 --> 03:42:12,600
Me!

5086
03:42:15,400 --> 03:42:16,480
It is me!

5087
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:18,160
No!

5088
03:42:18,420 --> 03:42:18,580
No!

5089
03:42:27,760 --> 03:42:28,900
Oh, so cool!

5090
03:42:29,660 --> 03:42:31,560
Oh my god, it's so freaky!

5091
03:42:32,420 --> 03:42:33,160
It's a ghost!

5092
03:42:36,740 --> 03:42:38,780
A brief moment when it turns into a horror game.

5093
03:42:38,960 --> 03:42:40,160
I know, it's so awesome!

5094
03:42:41,820 --> 03:42:42,640
It's that ninja!

5095
03:42:50,590 --> 03:42:54,210
Don't each of these bodies have a unique camera angle if you crouch next to them?

5096
03:42:54,210 --> 03:42:55,090
Oh, I'm not sure.

5097
03:42:58,230 --> 03:43:00,090
Oh my god, you're right!

5098
03:43:03,550 --> 03:43:04,150
What?

5099
03:43:06,970 --> 03:43:08,170
No way!

5100
03:43:09,730 --> 03:43:11,670
That's so cool!

5101
03:43:12,090 --> 03:43:12,910
No way!

5102
03:43:13,410 --> 03:43:14,490
Oh my god!

5103
03:43:14,710 --> 03:43:15,670
Oh my god!

5104
03:43:15,790 --> 03:43:16,190
Oh my god!

5105
03:43:19,990 --> 03:43:20,290
What?

5106
03:43:24,690 --> 03:43:26,130
Oh, is he still alive?

5107
03:43:26,370 --> 03:43:27,190
Are you okay, man?

5108
03:43:28,530 --> 03:43:29,910
I think I can save you.

5109
03:43:30,270 --> 03:43:31,510
Wait, one of them is still alive.

5110
03:43:32,530 --> 03:43:32,970
Him?

5111
03:43:33,150 --> 03:43:34,010
This guy is still alive.

5112
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:35,630
You good?

5113
03:43:35,990 --> 03:43:36,810
You good, man?

5114
03:43:38,010 --> 03:43:38,750
I'm crawling.

5115
03:43:38,970 --> 03:43:39,910
I'll give you CPR!

5116
03:43:40,830 --> 03:43:41,410
Come here!

5117
03:43:45,940 --> 03:43:47,660
Oh yeah, he's even a little red dot.

5118
03:43:49,300 --> 03:43:49,900
Oh, sorry.

5119
03:43:50,860 --> 03:43:53,660
Don't use tongue when doing... Don't use tongue when...

5120
03:44:01,870 --> 03:44:05,330
Don't use tongue when applying CPR, everybody.

5121
03:44:12,170 --> 03:44:13,990
Oh my gosh, it's so cool.

5122
03:44:14,090 --> 03:44:14,350
Wow!

5123
03:44:14,950 --> 03:44:16,430
This is so awesome.

5124
03:44:17,730 --> 03:44:20,070
Oh my gosh, it's so freaky.

5125
03:44:21,610 --> 03:44:23,070
This is so cool.

5126
03:44:23,190 --> 03:44:25,550
Wow, thank you for teaching me about this.

5127
03:44:25,610 --> 03:44:26,310
I had no idea.

5128
03:44:27,570 --> 03:44:30,670
Oh my god, the way he died.

5129
03:44:30,810 --> 03:44:31,370
So sad.

5130
03:44:32,830 --> 03:44:33,790
It's so cool.

5131
03:44:33,910 --> 03:44:34,630
Oh, not that guy though.

5132
03:44:34,690 --> 03:44:35,150
He's not special.

5133
03:44:35,450 --> 03:44:36,250
He doesn't get his own.

5134
03:44:36,770 --> 03:44:37,630
Oh, there it is.

5135
03:44:37,670 --> 03:44:37,950
There it is.

5136
03:44:38,070 --> 03:44:38,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5137
03:44:43,950 --> 03:44:47,690
I think a specific character bloodstained later in the game does this as well.

5138
03:44:47,910 --> 03:44:49,650
Same with Johnny's naked body after...

5139
03:44:49,650 --> 03:44:49,870
Oh,

5140
03:44:54,520 --> 03:44:56,540
black void.

5141
03:44:59,660 --> 03:45:03,740
Okay, time for another fight that I struggle with sometimes.

5142
03:45:04,720 --> 03:45:05,700
But hopefully,

5143
03:45:09,620 --> 03:45:12,000
we've been doing okay on the boss fight so far.

5144
03:45:15,220 --> 03:45:16,720
In fact, I think the way...

5145
03:45:16,720 --> 03:45:17,180
Stealth camouflage?

5146
03:45:17,660 --> 03:45:18,580
Who are you?

5147
03:45:18,620 --> 03:45:20,700
Each time I've died, it's been by something stupid.

5148
03:45:21,140 --> 03:45:23,400
What are you talking about?

5149
03:45:23,620 --> 03:45:24,260
Oh, Otacon.

5150
03:45:25,640 --> 03:45:27,680
Little pee-pee pants man.

5151
03:45:30,200 --> 03:45:31,800
They're pee-pee their pants.

5152
03:45:33,100 --> 03:45:33,700
Ninja.

5153
03:45:33,760 --> 03:45:34,600
You're that ninja.

5154
03:45:34,920 --> 03:45:35,860
You're that ninja.

5155
03:45:35,960 --> 03:45:37,680
I've been waiting for you, Snake.

5156
03:45:38,140 --> 03:45:39,340
Who are you?

5157
03:45:39,520 --> 03:45:40,400
Pee-pee boy.

5158
03:45:40,640 --> 03:45:42,360
Neither enemy nor friend.

5159
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:46,460
I am back from a world where such words are meaningless.

5160
03:45:47,060 --> 03:45:48,120
Ignore the voice actor.

5161
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:50,820
I've removed all obstacles.

5162
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:54,200
Now, you and I will battle to the death.

5163
03:45:54,940 --> 03:45:55,780
What do you want?

5164
03:45:55,960 --> 03:45:56,440
What do you want?

5165
03:45:56,440 --> 03:45:59,400
I've waited a long time for this day.

5166
03:45:59,860 --> 03:46:02,360
Now, I want to enjoy the moment.

5167
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:06,000
What's with these guys?

5168
03:46:06,220 --> 03:46:06,580
Here it is.

5169
03:46:06,660 --> 03:46:06,960
Here it is.

5170
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:08,960
It's like one of my Japanese animes.

5171
03:46:09,940 --> 03:46:13,440
I've come from another world to battle with you.

5172
03:46:13,940 --> 03:46:14,840
What is it?

5173
03:46:14,840 --> 03:46:15,280
Revenge?

5174
03:46:15,560 --> 03:46:15,700
Oh my god.

5175
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:16,260
Revenge?

5176
03:46:16,260 --> 03:46:18,560
Is nothing so trivial as revenge?

5177
03:46:19,140 --> 03:46:19,900
Please not.

5178
03:46:20,020 --> 03:46:21,740
A fight to the death with you.

5179
03:46:22,280 --> 03:46:25,500
Only in that can my soul find its might.

5180
03:46:25,500 --> 03:46:27,240
Isn't it respite?

5181
03:46:27,260 --> 03:46:29,880
I will kill you, or you will kill me.

5182
03:46:30,260 --> 03:46:30,880
Respite?

5183
03:46:31,260 --> 03:46:33,500
It makes no difference.

5184
03:46:33,880 --> 03:46:34,460
I don't know, actually.

5185
03:46:35,700 --> 03:46:36,320
Fine.

5186
03:46:40,080 --> 03:46:42,520
You can watch from inside there.

5187
03:46:42,760 --> 03:46:44,220
I need that man.

5188
03:46:44,460 --> 03:46:45,960
Keep your hands off him.

5189
03:46:46,220 --> 03:46:46,840
God, sorry.

5190
03:46:49,420 --> 03:46:51,940
Now, make me feel it.

5191
03:46:51,940 --> 03:46:53,320
Hurt me more, Snake.

5192
03:46:53,480 --> 03:46:54,780
Make me feel alive again.

5193
03:46:55,820 --> 03:46:57,280
Hurt me more, Snake.

5194
03:47:01,100 --> 03:47:02,580
That's good, Snake.

5195
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:07,480
Good.

5196
03:47:08,260 --> 03:47:10,360
Now we can fight as warriors.

5197
03:47:11,240 --> 03:47:12,240
Hand to hand.

5198
03:47:12,440 --> 03:47:14,680
It is the basis of all combat.

5199
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:16,220
It is the basis of all combat.

5200
03:47:16,320 --> 03:47:18,200
Only a fool trusts his life to a weapon.

5201
03:47:18,340 --> 03:47:19,060
I got you.

5202
03:47:19,320 --> 03:47:20,460
Hand to hand combat.

5203
03:47:20,660 --> 03:47:21,100
Where are you?

5204
03:47:21,100 --> 03:47:21,440
Come here.

5205
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:22,960
Oh my god.

5206
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:23,280
Ouch.

5207
03:47:23,520 --> 03:47:23,920
Ouch.

5208
03:47:24,580 --> 03:47:25,380
I'm going to die.

5209
03:47:25,460 --> 03:47:25,480
I'm going to die.

5210
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:27,700
Oh, my god...

5211
03:47:27,700 --> 03:47:28,120
Run, run, run, run.

5212
03:47:29,700 --> 03:47:30,560
Oh my god.

5213
03:47:30,560 --> 03:47:31,520
He's got invincibility.

5214
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:32,540
Oh, my god.

5215
03:47:32,600 --> 03:47:33,440
He's going crazy.

5216
03:47:33,540 --> 03:47:35,100
He's doing Cirque du Soleil flips over here.

5217
03:47:37,740 --> 03:47:38,100
Ouch!

5218
03:47:39,180 --> 03:47:39,780
Oh, my god.

5219
03:47:40,020 --> 03:47:40,700
He hits.

5220
03:47:40,880 --> 03:47:41,520
He packs a punch.

5221
03:47:45,220 --> 03:47:46,620
This fight is way...

5222
03:47:46,620 --> 03:47:52,440
I mean, all the fights are way easier in Twin Snakes, but this fight is way...

5223
03:47:52,440 --> 03:47:53,160
Oh my gosh.

5224
03:47:53,320 --> 03:47:53,780
Oh, my gosh.

5225
03:47:53,860 --> 03:47:54,120
Oh, my gosh.

5226
03:47:54,500 --> 03:47:55,460
He really hits hard.

5227
03:47:59,140 --> 03:48:00,380
She's really hard.

5228
03:48:29,670 --> 03:48:31,170
She's really hard.

5229
03:48:31,170 --> 03:48:31,170
I

5230
03:48:35,800 --> 03:48:40,580
thought I wasn't going to make that one.

5231
03:48:41,560 --> 03:48:41,980
Come here.

5232
03:48:42,020 --> 03:48:42,220
Come here.

5233
03:48:45,970 --> 03:48:46,710
There it is.

5234
03:48:46,810 --> 03:48:46,930
Okay.

5235
03:48:49,610 --> 03:48:50,450
Hurt me more.

5236
03:48:52,050 --> 03:48:52,970
I'm not good at this part.

5237
03:48:54,810 --> 03:48:56,350
Okay, never mind.

5238
03:48:56,470 --> 03:48:57,590
We know where he is.

5239
03:48:58,250 --> 03:48:59,810
Oh gosh, I'm on the other side of the room.

5240
03:49:00,150 --> 03:49:01,050
Don't come after me.

5241
03:49:01,750 --> 03:49:02,310
I'm coming.

5242
03:49:02,390 --> 03:49:02,650
I'm coming.

5243
03:49:02,690 --> 03:49:02,930
I'm coming.

5244
03:49:03,230 --> 03:49:04,770
I got you.

5245
03:49:04,790 --> 03:49:05,310
I got you first.

5246
03:49:05,510 --> 03:49:06,330
I got him first.

5247
03:49:06,430 --> 03:49:06,850
I got him first.

5248
03:49:09,010 --> 03:49:10,390
Do you think I hear him?

5249
03:49:10,590 --> 03:49:11,250
No, I don't.

5250
03:49:14,450 --> 03:49:14,790
Nice.

5251
03:49:14,790 --> 03:49:15,610
Nice and nice and nice.

5252
03:49:18,870 --> 03:49:20,510
I don't know where you are.

5253
03:49:21,710 --> 03:49:22,390
Where are you?

5254
03:49:37,050 --> 03:49:38,850
Can I keep punching him?

5255
03:49:38,850 --> 03:49:40,430
I think I keep punching him the whole time.

5256
03:49:40,690 --> 03:49:41,470
Where is he?

5257
03:49:41,530 --> 03:49:42,450
Oh, he's still walking.

5258
03:49:43,710 --> 03:49:44,650
Oh shit.

5259
03:49:44,690 --> 03:49:45,290
Oh shit.

5260
03:49:45,370 --> 03:49:46,030
I forgot he did this.

5261
03:49:46,350 --> 03:49:46,750
Okay.

5262
03:49:48,970 --> 03:49:50,290
Hurt me more.

5263
03:49:50,790 --> 03:49:52,030
Hurt me more.

5264
03:49:52,610 --> 03:49:54,070
Oh, I forgot he teleported.

5265
03:49:54,350 --> 03:49:54,830
Okay.

5266
03:49:55,810 --> 03:49:56,390
Come here.

5267
03:49:56,490 --> 03:49:56,930
Come here.

5268
03:50:02,230 --> 03:50:03,510
I couldn't predict.

5269
03:50:04,030 --> 03:50:04,790
Oh gosh.

5270
03:50:05,030 --> 03:50:06,550
Wait, did I already lose a...

5271
03:50:07,230 --> 03:50:08,230
Oh, yikes.

5272
03:50:15,330 --> 03:50:16,810
Hurt me more.

5273
03:50:22,100 --> 03:50:22,880
Hurt me more.

5274
03:50:22,880 --> 03:50:22,880
Nice.

5275
03:50:22,900 --> 03:50:23,180
Nice.

5276
03:50:23,320 --> 03:50:23,400
Nice.

5277
03:50:23,640 --> 03:50:24,120
That's it.

5278
03:50:24,160 --> 03:50:26,580
I remember that punch.

5279
03:50:28,020 --> 03:50:28,800
Remember,

5280
03:50:34,430 --> 03:50:35,010
Snake?

5281
03:50:35,390 --> 03:50:37,270
The feel of battle.

5282
03:50:37,370 --> 03:50:40,110
The clashing of bone and video.

5283
03:50:40,110 --> 03:50:40,710
Oh, yes.

5284
03:50:40,710 --> 03:50:41,570
I knew.

5285
03:50:57,750 --> 03:50:59,000
Hurt me more.

5286
03:51:02,320 --> 03:51:03,110
Do your thing.

5287
03:51:03,270 --> 03:51:03,790
Punch.

5288
03:51:03,790 --> 03:51:03,970
Punch.

5289
03:51:04,070 --> 03:51:04,310
Kick.

5290
03:51:04,310 --> 03:51:06,590
Oh, that's good, Snake.

5291
03:51:20,720 --> 03:51:21,600
Oh, shoot.

5292
03:51:22,940 --> 03:51:24,520
I can shoot him now, right?

5293
03:51:28,120 --> 03:51:32,100
Where did he go?

5294
03:51:33,700 --> 03:51:34,140
One.

5295
03:51:34,140 --> 03:51:34,520
One.

5296
03:51:34,520 --> 03:51:34,940
One.

5297
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:35,140
One.

5298
03:51:35,140 --> 03:51:35,340
Dad.

5299
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:35,720
Dad.

5300
03:51:35,880 --> 03:51:36,320
One.

5301
03:51:36,420 --> 03:51:36,640
One.

5302
03:51:36,660 --> 03:51:36,980
Dad.

5303
03:51:37,060 --> 03:51:37,340
Dad.

5304
03:51:37,720 --> 03:51:38,160
One.

5305
03:51:38,240 --> 03:51:38,460
One.

5306
03:51:38,480 --> 03:51:38,740
Dad.

5307
03:51:38,820 --> 03:51:39,080
Dad.

5308
03:51:39,280 --> 03:51:39,980
Where did he go?

5309
03:51:41,360 --> 03:51:41,800
One.

5310
03:51:41,820 --> 03:51:42,060
One.

5311
03:51:42,080 --> 03:51:42,300
Dad.

5312
03:51:42,440 --> 03:51:42,660
Dad.

5313
03:51:43,360 --> 03:51:45,320
Oh, he's over here destroying all the chairs.

5314
03:51:45,320 --> 03:51:46,140
One.

5315
03:51:46,340 --> 03:51:46,540
One.

5316
03:51:46,580 --> 03:51:46,860
Dad.

5317
03:51:47,020 --> 03:51:47,280
Dad.

5318
03:51:48,680 --> 03:51:49,240
Yay!

5319
03:51:51,900 --> 03:51:53,820
I felt that, Snake.

5320
03:51:55,080 --> 03:51:57,360
Do you remember me now?

5321
03:51:58,580 --> 03:51:59,320
Can't be.

5322
03:51:59,880 --> 03:52:00,780
First try.

5323
03:52:00,940 --> 03:52:01,060
Yeah.

5324
03:52:01,060 --> 03:52:02,380
To have killed a Zanzibar.

5325
03:52:02,620 --> 03:52:04,700
I've gotten a little bit better at this game.

5326
03:52:07,720 --> 03:52:08,280
What?

5327
03:52:12,340 --> 03:52:13,140
Not again.

5328
03:52:14,240 --> 03:52:14,800
The

5329
03:52:17,990 --> 03:52:18,550
medicine.

5330
03:52:22,970 --> 03:52:23,490
What's happening?

5331
03:52:24,230 --> 03:52:26,170
Dropped plot line is what's happening, Snake.

5332
03:52:27,830 --> 03:52:31,950
I am losing myself.

5333
03:52:37,900 --> 03:52:40,160
So, essentially, for people, if you don't know...

5334
03:52:40,160 --> 03:52:40,780
Is it over?

5335
03:52:41,180 --> 03:52:43,240
There was going to be, like, a thing with...

5336
03:52:43,240 --> 03:52:49,780
I can't exactly remember what it was about, but, like, his whole freakouts were going to be a whole subplot.

5337
03:52:50,540 --> 03:52:53,280
And they had to drop it, so...

5338
03:52:55,440 --> 03:52:58,680
Um, but I guess the scenes stayed in.

5339
03:52:59,680 --> 03:53:01,000
Yeah, they had to cut it out.

5340
03:53:01,700 --> 03:53:02,520
Gray Fox.

5341
03:53:03,080 --> 03:53:04,080
Gray Fox.

5342
03:53:04,080 --> 03:53:05,400
Colonel, that ninja is Gray Fox.

5343
03:53:05,620 --> 03:53:06,840
No doubt about it.

5344
03:53:07,260 --> 03:53:07,780
Ridiculous.

5345
03:53:08,020 --> 03:53:08,440
The hurt?

5346
03:53:08,460 --> 03:53:10,800
You of all people should know he died in Zanzibar.

5347
03:53:10,800 --> 03:53:11,980
And Snake's voice there?

5348
03:53:12,220 --> 03:53:14,300
He should have died, but he didn't.

5349
03:53:14,380 --> 03:53:14,900
What?

5350
03:53:15,260 --> 03:53:16,280
Makes me so...

5351
03:53:16,280 --> 03:53:18,460
It happened before I joined Foxhound's medical staff.

5352
03:53:19,160 --> 03:53:21,960
They were using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.

5353
03:53:22,520 --> 03:53:23,500
I never heard that.

5354
03:53:23,500 --> 03:53:24,380
Good actor.

5355
03:53:24,400 --> 03:53:25,620
It happened right after you retired.

5356
03:53:25,780 --> 03:53:26,480
David Hayter's amazing.

5357
03:53:26,540 --> 03:53:28,620
And predecessor, Dr. Clark, was in charge.

5358
03:53:28,920 --> 03:53:29,840
Dr. Clark?

5359
03:53:30,180 --> 03:53:30,620
Yes.

5360
03:53:30,960 --> 03:53:32,720
He started the gene therapy project.

5361
03:53:32,720 --> 03:53:33,300
Dr. Clark!

5362
03:53:33,440 --> 03:53:34,300
And where is he now?

5363
03:53:34,700 --> 03:53:35,100
Dead.

5364
03:53:35,260 --> 03:53:37,920
He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.

5365
03:53:38,260 --> 03:53:39,660
So what about this soldier?

5366
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:46,760
Apparently, for their test subject, they decided to use the body of a soldier who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar.

5367
03:53:47,080 --> 03:53:47,520
Let's...

5368
03:53:47,520 --> 03:53:48,680
And that was Gray Fox.

5369
03:53:48,680 --> 03:53:49,360
Avoid a little bit.

5370
03:53:49,360 --> 03:53:50,500
But he was already dead.

5371
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:51,920
Yes.

5372
03:53:52,520 --> 03:53:53,480
But they revived him.

5373
03:53:53,480 --> 03:54:00,280
They fitted him with a prototype exoskeleton and kept him drugged for four years while they experimented on him like a plaything.

5374
03:54:00,500 --> 03:54:00,620
Aww.

5375
03:54:01,900 --> 03:54:04,040
Today's genome soldiers were born from those experiments.

5376
03:54:04,800 --> 03:54:05,240
Gray Fox.

5377
03:54:05,240 --> 03:54:07,140
That's the sickest thing I ever heard.

5378
03:54:07,760 --> 03:54:10,740
They used him to test all sorts of gene therapy techniques.

5379
03:54:10,860 --> 03:54:12,460
I feel like this is an underrated soundtrack.

5380
03:54:12,460 --> 03:54:13,920
Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner?

5381
03:54:14,100 --> 03:54:15,400
You know, track from the O.S.T.

5382
03:54:15,420 --> 03:54:16,300
Because it's confidential information.

5383
03:54:16,860 --> 03:54:17,480
That's really good.

5384
03:54:17,560 --> 03:54:18,640
Is that the only reason?

5385
03:54:21,640 --> 03:54:22,460
So sick.

5386
03:54:22,500 --> 03:54:22,580
Naomi.

5387
03:54:22,580 --> 03:54:23,360
What happened to Gray Fox?

5388
03:54:23,360 --> 03:54:23,980
It's sick.

5389
03:54:25,200 --> 03:54:27,100
The record says he died in the explosion.

5390
03:54:27,800 --> 03:54:28,180
I see.

5391
03:54:29,160 --> 03:54:33,000
But even if that ninja is Gray Fox, the question is, why?

5392
03:54:33,440 --> 03:54:33,840
Why?

5393
03:54:33,940 --> 03:54:36,700
From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was.

5394
03:54:37,000 --> 03:54:39,220
Are you saying that he's just a mindless robot?

5395
03:54:39,580 --> 03:54:39,840
No.

5396
03:54:40,300 --> 03:54:40,960
I'm not sure.

5397
03:54:41,340 --> 03:54:43,580
But he seems intent on fighting me to the death.

5398
03:54:43,580 --> 03:54:43,760
He remembered.

5399
03:54:43,900 --> 03:54:44,380
He remembered.

5400
03:54:44,640 --> 03:54:44,700
We'll meet again.

5401
03:54:45,000 --> 03:54:45,600
You snake?

5402
03:54:45,600 --> 03:54:45,980
I know it.

5403
03:54:46,900 --> 03:54:48,080
So you'll fight again?

5404
03:54:48,960 --> 03:54:49,520
Until you kill him?

5405
03:54:49,520 --> 03:54:50,500
I stopped at this point a while ago.

5406
03:54:50,520 --> 03:54:51,340
I don't want to spoil myself.

5407
03:54:51,840 --> 03:54:52,640
I'd rather not.

5408
03:54:52,740 --> 03:54:52,860
I gotta finish.

5409
03:54:53,020 --> 03:54:53,340
You snake?

5410
03:54:53,340 --> 03:54:55,140
But maybe that's what he wants.

5411
03:54:55,240 --> 03:54:57,820
But if you don't have time, you can always come back and watch me finish for you.

5412
03:54:58,180 --> 03:54:59,580
Thanks for hanging around.

5413
03:54:59,840 --> 03:55:00,500
Thank you.

5414
03:55:01,700 --> 03:55:02,380
Oh my God.

5415
03:55:02,400 --> 03:55:02,780
Here he comes.

5416
03:55:02,820 --> 03:55:04,180
How long are you going to stay in there?

5417
03:55:06,320 --> 03:55:07,820
Are you one of them?

5418
03:55:08,700 --> 03:55:09,820
Get out of there, you baby.

5419
03:55:10,240 --> 03:55:10,500
No, I'm not.

5420
03:55:10,500 --> 03:55:11,280
I always work alone.

5421
03:55:12,720 --> 03:55:14,240
Starting to get a...

5422
03:55:14,240 --> 03:55:15,480
Are you an otaku too?

5423
03:55:16,320 --> 03:55:17,020
Come on.

5424
03:55:17,020 --> 03:55:17,560
Get out.

5425
03:55:17,700 --> 03:55:19,340
He doesn't even entertain it.

5426
03:55:19,400 --> 03:55:20,060
You can't stay here forever.

5427
03:55:20,340 --> 03:55:20,900
Get out.

5428
03:55:22,060 --> 03:55:23,320
I'm starting to get a catapult.

5429
03:55:23,340 --> 03:55:24,860
I'm starting to get a caffeine headache, I think, from the coffee.

5430
03:55:26,060 --> 03:55:28,380
I didn't sleep much last night, which is why I got a coffee.

5431
03:55:28,620 --> 03:55:29,040
Your uniform is different than theirs.

5432
03:55:29,840 --> 03:55:31,400
I fell asleep at 5 AM, you guys.

5433
03:55:31,400 --> 03:55:33,120
You're the Metal Gear Chief Engineer, Hal Emmerich, right?

5434
03:55:33,300 --> 03:55:33,680
Yeah.

5435
03:55:36,120 --> 03:55:37,120
You know me?

5436
03:55:37,500 --> 03:55:39,020
I heard about you from Meryl.

5437
03:55:39,560 --> 03:55:40,000
Oh.

5438
03:55:40,440 --> 03:55:41,960
So you're here to rescue me.

5439
03:55:42,100 --> 03:55:43,080
Christopher Fritz.

5440
03:55:43,420 --> 03:55:43,640
Sorry, but no.

5441
03:55:44,020 --> 03:55:45,820
There's something that I've got to do first.

5442
03:55:46,480 --> 03:55:47,520
They changed his name.

5443
03:55:48,060 --> 03:55:49,760
Well, at least you're not one of them.

5444
03:55:51,040 --> 03:55:51,480
Oh.

5445
03:55:52,160 --> 03:55:53,320
You sad pathetic...

5446
03:55:56,420 --> 03:55:57,220
I'm okay.

5447
03:55:57,620 --> 03:56:00,260
I just twisted my ankle a little bit trying to get away.

5448
03:56:00,440 --> 03:56:02,540
Well, if that's all, it's nothing to worry about.

5449
03:56:02,900 --> 03:56:04,080
There was always Fritz in this.

5450
03:56:04,140 --> 03:56:04,960
I guess I never...

5451
03:56:04,960 --> 03:56:05,420
I want to ask you something.

5452
03:56:05,440 --> 03:56:06,220
I never noticed.

5453
03:56:06,220 --> 03:56:07,840
I need information about Metal Gear.

5454
03:56:07,840 --> 03:56:08,120
It's Jerma.

5455
03:56:08,380 --> 03:56:08,900
Oh my God.

5456
03:56:09,440 --> 03:56:10,220
Metal Gear?

5457
03:56:10,380 --> 03:56:11,240
That clip of him, Jerma.

5458
03:56:11,240 --> 03:56:11,480
Yeah.

5459
03:56:12,180 --> 03:56:14,440
What's Metal Gear really designed for?

5460
03:56:14,720 --> 03:56:16,300
Some of the VAs use aliens and stuff.

5461
03:56:16,400 --> 03:56:17,560
It's a mobile TMD.

5462
03:56:17,600 --> 03:56:22,100
It's designed to shoot down nuclear missiles, only for defensive purposes, of course.

5463
03:56:22,260 --> 03:56:22,660
Of course.

5464
03:56:22,660 --> 03:56:22,820
Fire!

5465
03:56:22,820 --> 03:56:23,180
Oh.

5466
03:56:23,320 --> 03:56:27,580
I already know that Metal Gear is nothing but a nuclear-equipped, walking death mafia.

5467
03:56:27,920 --> 03:56:27,960
Don't bully the nerd!

5468
03:56:28,100 --> 03:56:28,840
Don't bully the nerd!

5469
03:56:29,320 --> 03:56:29,720
Nuclear?

5470
03:56:29,980 --> 03:56:31,320
What are you talking about?

5471
03:56:32,100 --> 03:56:35,440
The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a nuclear missile.

5472
03:56:35,560 --> 03:56:36,060
Oh my God.

5473
03:56:36,460 --> 03:56:37,080
You're telling me you didn't know?

5474
03:56:38,600 --> 03:56:42,880
They're going to put a dismantled warhead into Metal Gear's TMD missile module?

5475
03:56:43,400 --> 03:56:43,740
Wrong.

5476
03:56:43,880 --> 03:56:44,380
Wrong.

5477
03:56:44,400 --> 03:56:51,180
From the beginning, the purpose of this exercise was to test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear warhead.

5478
03:56:51,320 --> 03:56:53,300
The terrorists are just continuing to work on it.

5479
03:56:53,320 --> 03:56:54,120
You started it!

5480
03:56:54,220 --> 03:56:54,640
No.

5481
03:56:54,840 --> 03:56:55,640
You're wrong.

5482
03:56:55,900 --> 03:56:56,420
He had no idea.

5483
03:56:56,420 --> 03:56:58,000
I heard it directly from your boss, Baker.

5484
03:56:58,360 --> 03:56:58,900
Little baby.

5485
03:56:59,340 --> 03:56:59,780
No.

5486
03:57:00,660 --> 03:57:02,600
A nuclear missile on Rex?

5487
03:57:03,500 --> 03:57:05,320
So you really didn't know.

5488
03:57:06,320 --> 03:57:06,920
No.

5489
03:57:07,560 --> 03:57:10,180
All the armament was built by a separate department.

5490
03:57:10,420 --> 03:57:14,200
And the president personally supervised the final assembly of the main unit.

5491
03:57:15,480 --> 03:57:16,520
President Baker?

5492
03:57:17,240 --> 03:57:17,840
Yeah.

5493
03:57:18,680 --> 03:57:21,480
I was never told exactly what they armed Rex with.

5494
03:57:21,480 --> 03:57:25,860
I only know it's equipped with a Vulcan cannon, a laser, and a railgun.

5495
03:57:26,040 --> 03:57:27,200
A railgun.

5496
03:57:30,220 --> 03:57:31,080
Kenneth, no.

5497
03:57:31,720 --> 03:57:32,460
Kenneth, yes.

5498
03:57:32,580 --> 03:57:33,520
A railgun, you said.

5499
03:57:33,780 --> 03:57:34,120
Yeah.

5500
03:57:34,440 --> 03:57:38,120
It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high velocities.

5501
03:57:38,220 --> 03:57:41,100
The technology was originally developed for the SDI system and later scrapped.

5502
03:57:41,100 --> 03:57:43,600
He even installed a PP gun on it.

5503
03:57:44,020 --> 03:57:45,300
Are you an otaku?

5504
03:57:45,660 --> 03:57:46,800
Yes, I am.

5505
03:57:48,420 --> 03:57:50,560
The railgun is on Rex's right arm.

5506
03:57:50,640 --> 03:57:50,740
Oh.

5507
03:57:50,740 --> 03:57:53,980
Metal Gear's main function is to launch nuclear missiles.

5508
03:57:54,240 --> 03:57:55,820
You sure you're not forgetting something?

5509
03:57:56,380 --> 03:57:56,520
Rex is so cute.

5510
03:57:56,520 --> 03:58:03,860
It's true that Metal Gear has a missile module on his back that can carry up to eight missiles, but are you saying it was originally meant to carry nuclear missiles?

5511
03:58:03,960 --> 03:58:06,440
They turned the Cephia filter up to 80 on this.

5512
03:58:07,480 --> 03:58:07,920
Cute?

5513
03:58:08,200 --> 03:58:08,480
Yes.

5514
03:58:09,680 --> 03:58:10,620
Rex is so cute.

5515
03:58:10,680 --> 03:58:11,300
Ray is cuter.

5516
03:58:11,420 --> 03:58:11,660
Yeah.

5517
03:58:11,660 --> 03:58:12,520
But that's not all I think.

5518
03:58:12,520 --> 03:58:13,280
I stand by that fact.

5519
03:58:13,280 --> 03:58:16,020
If Metal Gear fired only standard nuclear missiles, Call my opinion on base.

5520
03:58:16,040 --> 03:58:18,140
then they should already have all the practical data they need.

5521
03:58:18,140 --> 03:58:20,120
Oh my god, sassy snakes sitting there.

5522
03:58:20,120 --> 03:58:20,700
No.

5523
03:58:21,120 --> 03:58:21,660
Look at that.

5524
03:58:22,100 --> 03:58:23,000
Could it be?

5525
03:58:23,500 --> 03:58:24,440
Could it be?

5526
03:58:27,420 --> 03:58:32,820
Metal Gear's co-developer, Rivermore National Labs, was working on a new type of nuclear weapon.

5527
03:58:33,920 --> 03:58:39,240
They were using Nova and NIF laser nuclear fusion testing equipment and supercomputers.

5528
03:58:40,180 --> 03:58:44,280
So they developed a new type of nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab, huh?

5529
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:48,700
Yes, but you can't use virtual data on a battlefield.

5530
03:58:48,700 --> 03:58:50,100
They would need actual launch.

5531
03:58:50,100 --> 03:58:50,460
Launch data.

5532
03:58:52,380 --> 03:58:54,720
These are some of the supercomputers.

5533
03:58:54,800 --> 03:58:58,060
If you link these, you can test everything in a virtual environment.

5534
03:58:58,480 --> 03:58:59,960
But it's all just theoretical.

5535
03:59:00,480 --> 03:59:03,540
So this exercise was designed to test the real thing.

5536
03:59:05,640 --> 03:59:07,240
Ray is a bit cooler than Rex.

5537
03:59:07,300 --> 03:59:07,920
What did our president do?

5538
03:59:08,740 --> 03:59:11,900
If the terrorists launched that thing...

5539
03:59:11,900 --> 03:59:12,840
Sassy.

5540
03:59:12,860 --> 03:59:14,480
The fifth snake is sassy snake.

5541
03:59:15,040 --> 03:59:15,540
Damn.

5542
03:59:16,440 --> 03:59:18,220
He's standing like a JoJo stand.

5543
03:59:18,600 --> 03:59:19,940
I'm such a fool.

5544
03:59:19,940 --> 03:59:20,080
He's standing like a JoJo stand.

5545
03:59:20,080 --> 03:59:22,020
It's all my fault.

5546
03:59:22,140 --> 03:59:23,500
Otacon, it's not your faaault.

5547
03:59:23,700 --> 03:59:24,440
Little baby.

5548
03:59:24,580 --> 03:59:25,760
You're just a little baby.

5549
03:59:27,680 --> 03:59:32,940
The truth is my grandfather was part of the Manhattan Project.

5550
03:59:33,240 --> 03:59:38,120
He suffered with a guilt for the rest of his life.

5551
03:59:40,540 --> 03:59:45,760
And my father is born on August 6th, 1945.

5552
03:59:47,300 --> 03:59:49,180
The day of the Hiroshima bomb.

5553
03:59:49,180 --> 03:59:53,700
I'm sorry, it's not funny, but it's just- it's just so goofy.

5554
03:59:54,080 --> 03:59:55,360
Oh my god.

5555
03:59:55,960 --> 03:59:56,600
Huey.

5556
03:59:57,100 --> 04:00:00,360
He was born... stupid.

5557
04:00:11,490 --> 04:00:14,290
This guy just wanted to make anime robots.

5558
04:00:14,670 --> 04:00:16,690
This guy wanted to make Gundams.

5559
04:00:18,150 --> 04:00:20,350
Gotta feel sorry about how he got played.

5560
04:00:20,350 --> 04:00:21,010
I know.

5561
04:00:25,710 --> 04:00:26,910
Every game...

5562
04:00:27,670 --> 04:00:32,410
Every game, Snake is having to tell Otacon to stop crying and pull himself together.

5563
04:00:33,550 --> 04:00:35,390
Play the I'm Nuclear song from MGS5.

5564
04:00:50,350 --> 04:00:52,870
If I don't start then their ballistic program is probably finished.

5565
04:00:53,190 --> 04:00:56,330
And since they haven't called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.

5566
04:00:56,550 --> 04:00:58,610
In other words, they must be ready to launch.

5567
04:00:59,250 --> 04:01:01,310
Merrill's got the detonation code override keys.

5568
04:01:01,590 --> 04:01:02,690
We'll link up with her.

5569
04:01:02,810 --> 04:01:05,650
If we can't override the launch, we'll have to destroy Rex.

5570
04:01:06,030 --> 04:01:08,970
He fell when he didn't go towards genetics to create Catgirls.

5571
04:01:11,630 --> 04:01:12,430
I mean...

5572
04:01:13,090 --> 04:01:14,050
I'll show you the way.

5573
04:01:14,710 --> 04:01:15,690
Look at this poor, sad guy.

5574
04:01:15,690 --> 04:01:17,770
On that leg of yours, you'll just slow me down.

5575
04:01:19,070 --> 04:01:21,170
You'll need me if you're gonna destroy Rex.

5576
04:01:21,390 --> 04:01:22,270
Otacon, you smell like piss.

5577
04:01:22,370 --> 04:01:24,330
Everyone will smell you from a mile away.

5578
04:01:24,490 --> 04:01:25,650
Please, use your brain.

5579
04:01:25,970 --> 04:01:26,270
I created Rex.

5580
04:01:26,590 --> 04:01:29,310
It's my right, my duty to destroy him.

5581
04:01:29,990 --> 04:01:30,470
No.

5582
04:01:33,390 --> 04:01:35,310
If you get a chance, try to escape.

5583
04:01:35,590 --> 04:01:38,430
When the coast is clear, I'll contact you by codec.

5584
04:01:38,570 --> 04:01:40,970
How am I supposed to escape from an island?

5585
04:01:41,210 --> 04:01:41,650
Swim!

5586
04:01:42,310 --> 04:01:42,790
Okay.

5587
04:01:43,670 --> 04:01:44,610
So what then?

5588
04:01:44,710 --> 04:01:46,910
I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.

5589
04:01:47,110 --> 04:01:47,750
You know this might be a good idea.

5590
04:01:47,750 --> 04:01:48,610
This place plays well, don't you?

5591
04:01:48,730 --> 04:01:49,570
Of course I do.

5592
04:01:50,050 --> 04:01:50,850
And don't worry.

5593
04:01:51,130 --> 04:01:51,930
I've got this.

5594
04:01:52,470 --> 04:01:53,470
Can I have this?

5595
04:01:54,410 --> 04:01:55,430
Can I have that?

5596
04:01:56,190 --> 04:01:56,950
Can I have that?

5597
04:01:57,010 --> 04:01:58,690
It's the same stealth technology as the ninja.

5598
04:01:58,730 --> 04:01:59,330
Can I have that?

5599
04:01:59,450 --> 04:02:00,810
Foxhound was gonna use them, but...

5600
04:02:00,810 --> 04:02:01,310
Can I have that?

5601
04:02:01,310 --> 04:02:02,190
With this, I'll be fine.

5602
04:02:02,570 --> 04:02:03,470
Bad leg and all.

5603
04:02:03,650 --> 04:02:03,750
Can I have that?

5604
04:02:03,750 --> 04:02:04,190
Can I have that?

5605
04:02:04,330 --> 04:02:04,690
Good.

5606
04:02:04,910 --> 04:02:05,470
Can I have that?

5607
04:02:05,490 --> 04:02:07,150
I want Meryl to watch after you, too.

5608
04:02:07,430 --> 04:02:08,970
Can I have that?

5609
04:02:13,650 --> 04:02:15,030
Meryl, the engineer's okay.

5610
04:02:15,690 --> 04:02:16,330
That's a relief.

5611
04:02:16,630 --> 04:02:18,030
I want you to look after him.

5612
04:02:18,050 --> 04:02:18,450
Do you hear it?

5613
04:02:18,450 --> 04:02:19,050
Where are you now?

5614
04:02:19,330 --> 04:02:20,150
Very close.

5615
04:02:20,650 --> 04:02:21,310
There she is!

5616
04:02:21,490 --> 04:02:22,170
Over there!

5617
04:02:22,370 --> 04:02:23,130
Oh no!

5618
04:02:23,330 --> 04:02:24,510
Damn, they've spotted me!

5619
04:02:25,910 --> 04:02:27,110
Meryl, what happened?

5620
04:02:29,610 --> 04:02:30,330
Something's wrong.

5621
04:02:30,730 --> 04:02:31,570
Did you hear something?

5622
04:02:32,170 --> 04:02:33,750
Wasn't that some kind of music?

5623
04:02:34,010 --> 04:02:34,570
Yeah, it was.

5624
04:02:34,950 --> 04:02:35,970
What did she look like?

5625
04:02:36,370 --> 04:02:36,590
Oh?

5626
04:02:36,650 --> 04:02:40,130
She... she was wearing the same green uniform as the terrorists.

5627
04:02:41,690 --> 04:02:42,450
Here we go.

5628
04:02:42,730 --> 04:02:44,350
Otacon being a little perv.

5629
04:02:45,690 --> 04:02:46,510
Yeah, what else?

5630
04:02:46,590 --> 04:02:47,050
A disguise?

5631
04:02:47,050 --> 04:02:49,190
She had such a cute way of walking.

5632
04:02:49,330 --> 04:02:50,810
She kind of wiggles her behind.

5633
04:02:51,110 --> 04:02:52,330
You were really looking.

5634
04:02:52,410 --> 04:02:54,290
Well, she's got a very cute behind.

5635
04:02:54,750 --> 04:02:56,170
Way of walking, huh?

5636
04:02:56,450 --> 04:02:56,970
Oh yeah.

5637
04:02:58,810 --> 04:03:00,110
Dude, thank you.

5638
04:03:01,170 --> 04:03:05,030
If she's disguised as the enemy, you'll have to contact her when she's alone, huh?

5639
04:03:05,210 --> 04:03:05,790
Ah, I see, I see.

5640
04:03:06,190 --> 04:03:08,890
There's only one place where we can be sure she's by herself.

5641
04:03:10,250 --> 04:03:10,890
Where's that?

5642
04:03:11,010 --> 04:03:11,930
Codec during after bosses.

5643
04:03:11,930 --> 04:03:12,330
Don't be so dense.

5644
04:03:12,730 --> 04:03:13,390
Yes, thank you.

5645
04:03:13,450 --> 04:03:14,010
Don't forget...

5646
04:03:14,010 --> 04:03:15,470
Don't feel like...

5647
04:03:15,470 --> 04:03:16,430
Um, don't...

5648
04:03:16,990 --> 04:03:17,870
Don't feel...

5649
04:03:17,870 --> 04:03:18,150
Here, use this security card.

5650
04:03:18,150 --> 04:03:22,090
Don't hesitate to remind me because I will forget because I just kind of like go through the game.

5651
04:03:22,170 --> 04:03:22,190
It's security level four.

5652
04:03:22,330 --> 04:03:24,470
Since I've played it, so...

5653
04:03:25,070 --> 04:03:25,390
Oh.

5654
04:03:26,090 --> 04:03:27,490
IBS, IBS, IBS, IBS!

5655
04:03:27,690 --> 04:03:28,710
You're not in pain, are you?

5656
04:03:28,710 --> 04:03:30,150
Oh my god, that made my controller fall.

5657
04:03:30,230 --> 04:03:30,670
You feel okay?

5658
04:03:30,850 --> 04:03:31,990
Nothing bothering you?

5659
04:03:32,190 --> 04:03:32,890
Why are you so...

5660
04:03:33,030 --> 04:03:34,710
Getting all friendly all of a sudden.

5661
04:03:34,710 --> 04:03:35,450
Why are you so close?

5662
04:03:35,590 --> 04:03:36,030
Nothing.

5663
04:03:36,070 --> 04:03:36,970
I'm glad you're okay.

5664
04:03:37,250 --> 04:03:38,130
You're strange.

5665
04:03:38,750 --> 04:03:39,750
I'm a little nervous.

5666
04:03:39,870 --> 04:03:41,630
Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies.

5667
04:03:41,970 --> 04:03:42,770
You're bad luck.

5668
04:03:42,870 --> 04:03:43,790
Forget it, doctor.

5669
04:03:43,830 --> 04:03:44,270
You're bad luck.

5670
04:03:44,270 --> 04:03:45,490
I love this interaction.

5671
04:03:45,590 --> 04:03:45,950
Call me Otacon.

5672
04:03:46,250 --> 04:03:46,770
Otacon?

5673
04:03:47,070 --> 04:03:48,690
It stands for Otaku Convention.

5674
04:03:49,070 --> 04:03:51,770
An otaku's a guy like me who likes Japanimation.

5675
04:03:53,990 --> 04:03:56,650
Japan was the first country to successfully make bipedal robots.

5676
04:03:56,650 --> 04:03:57,450
Call me Mintocon.

5677
04:03:59,090 --> 04:04:00,130
I also...

5678
04:04:00,130 --> 04:04:01,650
They're still the best in the field of robotics.

5679
04:04:01,650 --> 04:04:02,330
...like Japanimation.

5680
04:04:03,050 --> 04:04:05,790
And Japanese cartoons played some part in that?

5681
04:04:05,990 --> 04:04:06,830
They did.

5682
04:04:07,850 --> 04:04:08,370
Yeah!

5683
04:04:08,670 --> 04:04:11,470
I didn't get into science to make nuclear weapons, you know.

5684
04:04:12,170 --> 04:04:13,670
This is Policenauts, right?

5685
04:04:13,670 --> 04:04:13,930
This is Policenauts, right?

5686
04:04:13,930 --> 04:04:14,050
This is Policenauts, right?

5687
04:04:14,050 --> 04:04:14,250
This is Policenauts, right?

5688
04:04:14,250 --> 04:04:19,270
I became a scientist because I wanted to make robots like the ones in the Japanese animes.

5689
04:04:19,350 --> 04:04:19,870
Yeah!

5690
04:04:20,270 --> 04:04:22,210
I like how they capitalize anime.

5691
04:04:22,750 --> 04:04:25,370
That just sounds like a childish excuse to me.

5692
04:04:27,690 --> 04:04:28,210
Yeah!

5693
04:04:28,770 --> 04:04:30,410
It's short for Mint Convention.

5694
04:04:30,810 --> 04:04:30,950
You're right.

5695
04:04:30,950 --> 04:04:32,030
We have to take responsibility.

5696
04:04:32,770 --> 04:04:34,570
Science has always thrived on war.

5697
04:04:35,030 --> 04:04:39,230
Greatest weapons of mass destruction were created by scientists who wanted to be famous.

5698
04:04:39,650 --> 04:04:41,030
But that's all over now.

5699
04:04:41,030 --> 04:04:41,370
They're not cartoons.

5700
04:04:41,510 --> 04:04:41,850
Snack.

5701
04:04:41,910 --> 04:04:43,630
I won't take part in murder anymore.

5702
04:04:43,830 --> 04:04:44,230
You're right.

5703
04:04:44,250 --> 04:04:44,790
Whatever.

5704
04:04:45,030 --> 04:04:46,610
All I want from you is information.

5705
04:04:47,130 --> 04:04:47,490
Sure.

5706
04:04:47,710 --> 04:04:49,110
I know everything about this whole thing.

5707
04:04:49,110 --> 04:04:51,150
Snack's like, I don't care about your ideals and your morals.

5708
04:04:51,170 --> 04:04:52,050
Ask me anything about Rex or about this place.

5709
04:04:53,070 --> 04:04:56,950
Also, with this stealth camouflage, I can sneak in and out of the armory and mess hall.

5710
04:04:56,950 --> 04:04:58,830
If this game was made today, he would be talking about me too, right?

5711
04:04:58,890 --> 04:05:00,690
If you need ammo or rations, just tell me and I'll bring them to you.

5712
04:05:01,790 --> 04:05:02,150
Yeah.

5713
04:05:03,830 --> 04:05:05,110
I'm on frequency 141.12.

5714
04:05:05,110 --> 04:05:06,510
Otacon would be a fan of Pekora.

5715
04:05:06,730 --> 04:05:07,350
See you later.

5716
04:05:10,870 --> 04:05:12,330
That's why he didn't create cat girls.

5717
04:05:12,430 --> 04:05:14,010
He wants bunny girls, you guys.

5718
04:05:14,010 --> 04:05:14,230
I'm on frequency 141.12.

5719
04:05:16,190 --> 04:05:18,430
Please not stream windmint, sometime.

5720
04:05:19,470 --> 04:05:20,930
Whenever I get around to it.

5721
04:05:22,210 --> 04:05:22,870
Yay!

5722
04:05:23,510 --> 04:05:24,570
Defeat ninja!

5723
04:05:25,450 --> 04:05:26,790
Yippie, yippie, yippie!

5724
04:05:27,590 --> 04:05:29,230
He wanted mech girls?

5725
04:05:29,570 --> 04:05:31,390
Based, based, based, based.

5726
04:05:34,350 --> 04:05:36,170
Take all the things we can get.

5727
04:05:39,710 --> 04:05:40,370
Ha.

5728
04:05:41,110 --> 04:05:43,170
I wish there was more ration.

5729
04:05:43,550 --> 04:05:44,210
All right.

5730
04:05:55,170 --> 04:05:56,830
It's not a phase, it's a lifestyle.

5731
04:05:58,270 --> 04:05:58,910
So true.

5732
04:06:00,570 --> 04:06:00,930
PlayStation!

5733
04:06:03,870 --> 04:06:06,330
But I actually, I don't know if you guys noticed, I'm playing...

5734
04:06:07,130 --> 04:06:10,590
Well, you guys saw that I'm playing the Master Collection, but I'm playing it on PC.

5735
04:06:13,770 --> 04:06:18,450
NiF was first announced in 95 and planned to finish building in 05, but budgeting issues pushed it back to 09.

5736
04:06:19,210 --> 04:06:21,030
NiF was ready by 05, like at MGS.

5737
04:06:21,910 --> 04:06:23,810
Ignition still wouldn't happen until 2017.

5738
04:06:24,130 --> 04:06:24,270
Wow.

5739
04:06:32,200 --> 04:06:32,640
Okay.

5740
04:06:32,640 --> 04:06:34,500
Now, we go.

5741
04:06:35,640 --> 04:06:36,800
Kind of looks like a Saturn.

5742
04:06:38,180 --> 04:06:39,840
It is a PlayStation though, right?

5743
04:06:40,420 --> 04:06:43,920
I mean, that would make sense, because this was for the PlayStation 1.

5744
04:06:44,360 --> 04:06:47,200
But it does... I can see the Saturn.

5745
04:06:47,800 --> 04:06:48,240
Right?

5746
04:06:48,380 --> 04:06:49,180
I can see it.

5747
04:06:51,100 --> 04:06:52,100
It does kind of look like a Saturn.

5748
04:06:52,120 --> 04:06:52,500
It does look like one.

5749
04:06:54,740 --> 04:06:56,060
It's so thick.

5750
04:06:57,020 --> 04:06:59,680
I had a PlayStation 1, but it was the thin one.

5751
04:07:04,260 --> 04:07:05,520
The Saturn was black.

5752
04:07:07,000 --> 04:07:08,480
Well, that looks darker, right?

5753
04:07:08,640 --> 04:07:09,900
Looks like a darker color.

5754
04:07:10,020 --> 04:07:12,000
So I can see how you would mistake it.

5755
04:07:14,880 --> 04:07:15,320
Oh.

5756
04:07:16,320 --> 04:07:17,100
Wait, hold on.

5757
04:07:20,740 --> 04:07:22,160
Oh, my gosh.

5758
04:07:22,260 --> 04:07:25,280
Bless you, Kojima, for your awesome camera angles.

5759
04:07:25,340 --> 04:07:26,540
Your cinematic...

5760
04:07:27,080 --> 04:07:28,460
God, it looks so...

5761
04:07:28,460 --> 04:07:30,680
It looks so... Oh, it's so scary.

5762
04:07:31,440 --> 04:07:32,380
Oh, my gosh.

5763
04:07:32,760 --> 04:07:33,740
Like, you come in.

5764
04:07:33,820 --> 04:07:36,580
Imagine you haven't walked into this room yet.

5765
04:07:36,660 --> 04:07:38,600
You walk in for the first time.

5766
04:07:39,540 --> 04:07:40,060
And...

5767
04:07:40,060 --> 04:07:41,940
And you, like, instead of...

5768
04:07:41,940 --> 04:07:46,480
Instead of, like, seeing what's going on, you, like, press against the door.

5769
04:07:46,480 --> 04:07:47,980
Oh, it's so good.

5770
04:07:50,000 --> 04:07:50,960
So awesome.

5771
04:07:56,920 --> 04:07:58,260
Cashmere is good.

5772
04:08:02,340 --> 04:08:03,500
He really likes movies.

5773
04:08:03,760 --> 04:08:04,240
He does.

5774
04:08:07,360 --> 04:08:08,140
Yes, he does.

5775
04:08:08,300 --> 04:08:09,100
He really likes movies.

5776
04:08:09,640 --> 04:08:10,540
You think I can...

5777
04:08:10,540 --> 04:08:12,480
Well, I don't want to use all my trap grenades right now.

5778
04:08:16,500 --> 04:08:18,160
I want the ration, though.

5779
04:08:20,660 --> 04:08:22,300
I want the ration, though.

5780
04:08:23,480 --> 04:08:24,740
This one right there.

5781
04:08:25,700 --> 04:08:27,100
I want it.

5782
04:08:27,160 --> 04:08:28,280
What is in that box?

5783
04:08:28,860 --> 04:08:30,120
More Nikita missiles, maybe?

5784
04:08:31,240 --> 04:08:32,120
More ammo?

5785
04:08:33,520 --> 04:08:35,900
To the first floor.

5786
04:08:37,220 --> 04:08:40,440
And we gotta go see a cute little behind.

5787
04:08:43,480 --> 04:08:45,760
I'm wondering if I have time to...

5788
04:08:45,760 --> 04:08:46,220
Well...

5789
04:08:48,500 --> 04:08:51,220
I don't know if I have time to beat Psycho Mantis.

5790
04:08:51,520 --> 04:08:53,140
It really depends on how much I game.

5791
04:08:54,660 --> 04:08:56,020
And I don't trust myself.

5792
04:08:58,620 --> 04:09:01,200
I didn't make it so far, but...

5793
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:05,060
I didn't make it very far, but...

5794
04:09:06,660 --> 04:09:07,140
I...

5795
04:09:09,820 --> 04:09:12,120
Did take an hour to watch some cutscenes.

5796
04:09:12,720 --> 04:09:14,000
To watch the briefings.

5797
04:09:28,050 --> 04:09:30,750
I think I'll save Psycho Mantis for...

5798
04:09:32,670 --> 04:09:33,650
Next week.

5799
04:09:36,660 --> 04:09:37,880
I think, maybe.

5800
04:09:40,480 --> 04:09:42,600
Oh, here comes the guy from the party.

5801
04:09:46,400 --> 04:09:47,000
Hello.

5802
04:09:47,300 --> 04:09:48,060
Good boy.

5803
04:09:49,720 --> 04:09:51,180
I'm going to the party room.

5804
04:09:53,880 --> 04:09:54,920
Psycho Mantis.

5805
04:09:55,660 --> 04:09:56,880
Yeah, that was me.

5806
04:10:05,590 --> 04:10:06,790
Oh my god.

5807
04:10:06,870 --> 04:10:07,750
That's so funny.

5808
04:10:08,030 --> 04:10:08,990
He's coming back.

5809
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:09,690
He's got to pee.

5810
04:10:25,860 --> 04:10:26,420
Sorry.

5811
04:10:26,680 --> 04:10:27,120
I

5812
04:10:30,980 --> 04:10:31,560
got a reaction.

5813
04:10:32,800 --> 04:10:33,600
Lucky day.

5814
04:10:47,160 --> 04:10:48,280
Oh shit.

5815
04:10:58,120 --> 04:11:00,540
I've never heard her do the...

5816
04:11:01,280 --> 04:11:02,940
I've never heard her do that.

5817
04:11:03,400 --> 04:11:04,400
Oh my gosh.

5818
04:11:05,160 --> 04:11:06,740
We found her immediately.

5819
04:11:06,860 --> 04:11:07,640
That's crazy.

5820
04:11:12,240 --> 04:11:13,900
Hello, lady's room.

5821
04:11:16,320 --> 04:11:17,680
That was so easy.

5822
04:11:20,360 --> 04:11:21,500
Nothing here.

5823
04:11:24,460 --> 04:11:25,980
Nothing here.

5824
04:11:32,970 --> 04:11:34,050
She's like...

5825
04:11:34,990 --> 04:11:36,390
She bested me.

5826
04:11:36,930 --> 04:11:37,370
Again.

5827
04:11:41,710 --> 04:11:45,530
That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the legendary Solid Snake.

5828
04:11:47,750 --> 04:11:48,630
You're Meryl?

5829
04:11:48,770 --> 04:11:51,010
There's no way you could pass for a man for long.

5830
04:11:51,330 --> 04:11:51,990
What do you mean?

5831
04:11:52,310 --> 04:11:54,090
Hey, men aren't allowed in here.

5832
04:11:54,310 --> 04:11:56,330
I had no idea you were so feminine.

5833
04:11:56,510 --> 04:11:58,810
This is no time to try and hit on these snakes.

5834
04:11:58,810 --> 04:11:59,450
You horn dog.

5835
04:12:00,630 --> 04:12:01,770
I love it.

5836
04:12:02,870 --> 04:12:04,610
Just flirts with anything that moves.

5837
04:12:04,630 --> 04:12:05,910
Besides, it's a waste of time.

5838
04:12:05,910 --> 04:12:09,810
When I joined up, they gave me psychotherapy to destroy my interest in men.

5839
04:12:09,870 --> 04:12:10,950
Oh yeah, and that totally worked.

5840
04:12:11,250 --> 04:12:11,270
Same smart mouth.

5841
04:12:11,670 --> 04:12:12,770
You're Meryl, all right.

5842
04:12:12,790 --> 04:12:15,050
Yeah, it totally works against Solid Snake.

5843
04:12:15,210 --> 04:12:17,210
After all, I was disguised as a Genome Soldier.

5844
04:12:17,550 --> 04:12:18,510
So why'd you change?

5845
04:12:18,770 --> 04:12:20,730
You'd be a lot better off dressed like one of them.

5846
04:12:21,070 --> 04:12:23,030
I got tired of disguising myself.

5847
04:12:23,310 --> 04:12:24,150
This girl look pleased.

5848
04:12:24,610 --> 04:12:27,290
The truth is, the uniform smelled like blood.

5849
04:12:27,670 --> 04:12:28,830
The Foxhound tattoo.

5850
04:12:28,830 --> 04:12:29,410
What's that mark?

5851
04:12:29,990 --> 04:12:30,470
Huh?

5852
04:12:30,670 --> 04:12:31,570
Oh, this?

5853
04:12:31,950 --> 04:12:33,110
It's a paint tattoo.

5854
04:12:33,230 --> 04:12:33,950
It's not real.

5855
04:12:34,110 --> 04:12:35,770
I was a fan of Foxhound way back.

5856
04:12:35,770 --> 04:12:37,930
When guys like you and my uncle were in it.

5857
04:12:37,990 --> 04:12:38,590
Snake is different.

5858
04:12:38,770 --> 04:12:40,230
None of that gym therapy like there is today.

5859
04:12:40,370 --> 04:12:42,050
You guys were real heroes.

5860
04:12:42,550 --> 04:12:44,130
There are no heroes in war.

5861
04:12:44,430 --> 04:12:47,590
All the heroes I know are either dead or in prison.

5862
04:12:47,790 --> 04:12:48,770
One or the other.

5863
04:12:49,090 --> 04:12:51,430
But Snake, you're a hero, aren't you?

5864
04:12:51,770 --> 04:12:53,610
I'm just a man who's good at what he does.

5865
04:12:53,970 --> 04:12:54,410
Killing.

5866
04:12:54,830 --> 04:12:56,810
There's no winning or losing for a mercenary.

5867
04:12:57,070 --> 04:12:58,990
The only winners in war are the people.

5868
04:12:59,470 --> 04:13:01,710
That's right, and you fight for the people.

5869
04:13:01,950 --> 04:13:03,650
I've never fought for anyone but myself.

5870
04:13:04,070 --> 04:13:05,530
I've got no purpose in life.

5871
04:13:05,530 --> 04:13:06,670
No ultimate goal.

5872
04:13:06,910 --> 04:13:07,770
Come on.

5873
04:13:07,990 --> 04:13:09,770
It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.

5874
04:13:10,150 --> 04:13:11,970
The only time I feel truly alive.

5875
04:13:12,430 --> 04:13:14,850
Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh?

5876
04:13:14,970 --> 04:13:16,890
You love war and don't want it to stop?

5877
04:13:17,050 --> 04:13:19,490
Is it the same with all great soldiers throughout history?

5878
04:13:20,610 --> 04:13:21,870
Why didn't you contact me?

5879
04:13:22,090 --> 04:13:22,690
My coat was broken.

5880
04:13:22,690 --> 04:13:23,210
Hand on the hip.

5881
04:13:23,450 --> 04:13:24,510
He's so sassy.

5882
04:13:24,570 --> 04:13:26,450
Shouldn't you just be happy we met up like this?

5883
04:13:26,610 --> 04:13:28,150
How did you recognize me in disguise?

5884
04:13:28,610 --> 04:13:29,910
I never forget a lady.

5885
04:13:30,230 --> 04:13:32,370
So there's something you like about me, huh?

5886
04:13:32,790 --> 04:13:33,270
Yeah.

5887
04:13:33,550 --> 04:13:34,930
You've got a great butt.

5888
04:13:34,930 --> 04:13:36,110
God, he's so honest.

5889
04:13:36,270 --> 04:13:36,350
Oh, I see.

5890
04:13:36,410 --> 04:13:37,590
First, it's my eyes.

5891
04:13:37,670 --> 04:13:38,570
Now, it's my butt.

5892
04:13:38,750 --> 04:13:39,630
And what's next?

5893
04:13:39,990 --> 04:13:42,710
On the battlefield, you never think about what's next.

5894
04:13:42,990 --> 04:13:44,130
Oh, my God.

5895
04:13:46,570 --> 04:13:47,610
Snake, you...

5896
04:13:47,610 --> 04:13:47,930
You!

5897
04:13:48,490 --> 04:13:50,570
So, Snake, how are the negotiations going?

5898
04:13:51,590 --> 04:13:52,530
No progress.

5899
04:13:52,630 --> 04:13:52,950
I don't know.

5900
04:13:54,350 --> 04:13:56,090
So it's all up to you, huh?

5901
04:13:56,430 --> 04:13:57,410
Living in the moment.

5902
04:13:57,430 --> 04:13:59,450
Somebody's got to stop them from launching a nuclear missile.

5903
04:13:59,990 --> 04:14:01,090
There are two ways.

5904
04:14:01,310 --> 04:14:03,530
Either we destroy Metal Gear or...

5905
04:14:03,530 --> 04:14:04,850
We override the detonation.

5906
04:14:05,830 --> 04:14:06,930
The music's so awesome.

5907
04:14:06,930 --> 04:14:07,650
You got the card keys from Baker?

5908
04:14:08,570 --> 04:14:09,230
Card keys?

5909
04:14:10,450 --> 04:14:11,790
Girl, you have pockets!

5910
04:14:11,990 --> 04:14:12,830
Where are the others?

5911
04:14:13,010 --> 04:14:14,190
There should be three keys.

5912
04:14:14,270 --> 04:14:15,130
You have pockets!

5913
04:14:15,130 --> 04:14:15,790
This is all I've got.

5914
04:14:16,110 --> 04:14:17,270
Where could the other two be?

5915
04:14:17,690 --> 04:14:19,870
I have no idea, but they must be somewhere.

5916
04:14:20,150 --> 04:14:23,310
If we can't find them, we'll have no choice but to destroy Metal Gear.

5917
04:14:23,490 --> 04:14:23,590
Uh-oh.

5918
04:14:23,590 --> 04:14:24,250
Okay, she's only got one.

5919
04:14:24,430 --> 04:14:24,550
That's fine.

5920
04:14:24,550 --> 04:14:26,310
Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north.

5921
04:14:26,490 --> 04:14:27,170
Take me, too.

5922
04:14:27,490 --> 04:14:29,250
I know this place better than you do.

5923
04:14:29,370 --> 04:14:30,530
You'll just slow me down.

5924
04:14:30,610 --> 04:14:32,230
You don't have enough battle experience.

5925
04:14:32,750 --> 04:14:34,210
I won't slow you down.

5926
04:14:34,330 --> 04:14:34,830
I promise.

5927
04:14:34,830 --> 04:14:36,510
And what if you do?

5928
04:14:36,570 --> 04:14:36,810
Then you can shoot me.

5929
04:14:36,810 --> 04:14:38,790
She says until we have to backtrack for...

5930
04:14:38,790 --> 04:14:40,350
I don't like to waste bullets.

5931
04:14:41,370 --> 04:14:46,490
She's like, I won't slow you down until we have to backtrack all the way back to the...

5932
04:14:47,250 --> 04:14:47,690
I'll be careful.

5933
04:14:47,690 --> 04:14:48,290
What in the building?

5934
04:14:48,330 --> 04:14:50,170
You know, I don't use makeup the way other women do.

5935
04:14:50,170 --> 04:14:50,950
Oh, it's her pick me moment.

5936
04:14:51,790 --> 04:14:52,410
Pick me, Meryl.

5937
04:14:52,410 --> 04:14:54,130
I hardly ever look at myself in the mirror.

5938
04:14:54,790 --> 04:14:55,550
You hate makeup.

5939
04:14:55,550 --> 04:14:57,290
I've always despised that kind of woman.

5940
04:14:59,370 --> 04:15:01,650
I always dreamed of becoming a soldier.

5941
04:15:02,730 --> 04:15:03,950
But I was wrong.

5942
04:15:04,070 --> 04:15:04,810
I'm not like other women.

5943
04:15:04,810 --> 04:15:05,210
Girls.

5944
04:15:05,410 --> 04:15:06,790
It wasn't really my dream.

5945
04:15:08,330 --> 04:15:09,210
My father.

5946
04:15:10,050 --> 04:15:12,090
He was killed in action when I was younger.

5947
04:15:12,630 --> 04:15:14,310
You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps?

5948
04:15:14,710 --> 04:15:14,950
Dead.

5949
04:15:15,070 --> 04:15:15,510
Not really.

5950
04:15:15,850 --> 04:15:18,990
I thought that if I became a soldier, I could understand him better.

5951
04:15:19,450 --> 04:15:20,710
So are you a soldier yet?

5952
04:15:20,950 --> 04:15:21,410
Wow.

5953
04:15:21,670 --> 04:15:22,970
I thought I was until today.

5954
04:15:23,190 --> 04:15:24,590
But now I understand.

5955
04:15:25,050 --> 04:15:25,330
She...

5956
04:15:25,330 --> 04:15:27,470
Truth is, I was just afraid of looking at myself.

5957
04:15:27,470 --> 04:15:28,430
She folded so quickly.

5958
04:15:28,490 --> 04:15:30,190
Afraid of having to make my own decisions in life.

5959
04:15:30,230 --> 04:15:31,330
She had one day.

5960
04:15:31,570 --> 04:15:32,410
I'm not going to lie to myself anymore.

5961
04:15:32,810 --> 04:15:33,570
It's time I...

5962
04:15:33,570 --> 04:15:34,790
One day here and she was like...

5963
04:15:34,810 --> 04:15:36,910
I want to know who I am.

5964
04:15:37,030 --> 04:15:38,150
What I'm capable of.

5965
04:15:38,230 --> 04:15:40,970
I want to know why I've lived the way I've lived until now.

5966
04:15:41,110 --> 04:15:42,310
I want to know.

5967
04:15:42,630 --> 04:15:43,670
Take a good look.

5968
04:15:43,870 --> 04:15:45,470
You won't get another chance for a while.

5969
04:15:45,730 --> 04:15:47,670
You should wash your face, too, while you're at it.

5970
04:15:47,870 --> 04:15:48,310
Yeah.

5971
04:15:48,890 --> 04:15:50,390
This isn't a training exercise.

5972
04:15:50,630 --> 04:15:52,330
Our lives are riding on this.

5973
04:15:52,530 --> 04:15:54,450
There are no heroes or heroines.

5974
04:15:54,510 --> 04:15:56,490
If you lose, you're worm food.

5975
04:15:57,690 --> 04:15:58,170
Yeah.

5976
04:15:58,470 --> 04:15:58,950
Worm.

5977
04:15:59,170 --> 04:16:00,370
Is that FAMAS functional?

5978
04:16:02,750 --> 04:16:04,010
Unfortunately, it's out of ammo.

5979
04:16:04,310 --> 04:16:04,790
Oh.

5980
04:16:04,810 --> 04:16:05,870
Where'd you get that Desert Eagle?

5981
04:16:06,190 --> 04:16:07,430
I found it in the armory.

5982
04:16:07,890 --> 04:16:09,730
It's a .50 caliber Action Express.

5983
04:16:10,350 --> 04:16:12,690
There was a SOCOM pistol, too, but I chose this.

5984
04:16:12,850 --> 04:16:13,430
We got the leftovers.

5985
04:16:13,570 --> 04:16:14,570
So I got a leftover, huh?

5986
04:16:15,710 --> 04:16:17,310
Isn't that gun a little big for a girl?

5987
04:16:17,550 --> 04:16:17,870
Hey.

5988
04:16:17,870 --> 04:16:18,150
Don't worry.

5989
04:16:18,370 --> 04:16:19,170
I can handle it.

5990
04:16:19,270 --> 04:16:20,770
She's more comfortable with it than a bra.

5991
04:16:20,950 --> 04:16:21,710
Mom, use my .45.

5992
04:16:22,450 --> 04:16:22,770
Listen.

5993
04:16:22,890 --> 04:16:25,410
I've used a gun like this since I was eight years old.

5994
04:16:25,610 --> 04:16:27,490
I'm more comfortable with it than I am with a bra.

5995
04:16:27,810 --> 04:16:28,110
Yeah.

5996
04:16:32,590 --> 04:16:34,790
If we're going to go to the north, we'll have to go through the countryside.

5997
04:16:34,790 --> 04:16:35,970
We can go to the commander's room on this floor.

5998
04:16:36,170 --> 04:16:37,510
The overland route is blocked by glaciers.

5999
04:16:37,510 --> 04:16:38,470
She and I just think the same way.

6000
04:16:38,510 --> 04:16:39,770
We're both girly pops, okay?

6001
04:16:40,150 --> 04:16:40,550
That's how I knew she was going to say that.

6002
04:16:40,550 --> 04:16:42,530
The door to the commander's room is security level 5.

6003
04:16:42,890 --> 04:16:44,110
This card will open it.

6004
04:16:44,510 --> 04:16:46,790
It was inside the pocket of the uniform I was wearing.

6005
04:16:46,910 --> 04:16:46,930
Oh my god!

6006
04:16:47,310 --> 04:16:49,250
Looks like he must have been guarding some place important.

6007
04:16:49,310 --> 04:16:50,670
You have pockets!

6008
04:16:54,330 --> 04:16:54,730
Okay.

6009
04:16:56,810 --> 04:16:57,370
Let's go.

6010
04:16:57,430 --> 04:16:58,950
She's just flaunting her perky boobs.

6011
04:16:58,950 --> 04:16:59,350
I know this place better than you.

6012
04:17:00,050 --> 04:17:00,810
She's just like...

6013
04:17:00,810 --> 04:17:01,350
I'll be point man.

6014
04:17:01,990 --> 04:17:02,650
Follow me.

6015
04:17:02,870 --> 04:17:03,530
Follow me.

6016
04:17:03,930 --> 04:17:04,570
She's just...

6017
04:17:04,570 --> 04:17:04,770
Oh.

6018
04:17:04,790 --> 04:17:08,810
She's just showing off how perky her chest is, you know?

6019
04:17:11,350 --> 04:17:12,570
And the music stopped.

6020
04:17:14,970 --> 04:17:17,410
I can keep up the music.

6021
04:17:31,880 --> 04:17:32,660
Stun grenade!

6022
04:17:35,140 --> 04:17:38,340
Good thing we didn't go in here earlier, right?

6023
04:17:40,120 --> 04:17:42,980
I didn't attempt to even get anything out of here.

6024
04:17:42,980 --> 04:17:46,940
Because I was like, oh, the guys are just going to disappear before we...

6025
04:17:49,200 --> 04:17:52,360
Before we move on, anyway.

6026
04:17:53,120 --> 04:17:53,920
What's under here?

6027
04:17:57,100 --> 04:18:00,000
I think I... I'm just looking for rations at this point.

6028
04:18:01,540 --> 04:18:03,020
Are you going to make Meryl blush?

6029
04:18:03,100 --> 04:18:05,020
Of course I'm going to make Meryl blush!

6030
04:18:05,180 --> 04:18:06,000
Of course!

6031
04:18:08,840 --> 04:18:10,260
That is Isabelle!

6032
04:18:12,980 --> 04:18:13,900
Night vision goggles!

6033
04:18:14,040 --> 04:18:15,000
You all can shut up.

6034
04:18:15,080 --> 04:18:16,580
You all can shut the hell up.

6035
04:18:16,760 --> 04:18:18,140
We got the night vision goggles.

6036
04:18:18,500 --> 04:18:20,780
You can all shut up.

6037
04:18:20,840 --> 04:18:23,680
We can all be quiet about the night vision goggles.

6038
04:18:23,840 --> 04:18:26,120
We do not need anything further.

6039
04:18:27,780 --> 04:18:28,800
Cardboard box B!

6040
04:18:30,720 --> 04:18:31,240
Oh.

6041
04:18:31,720 --> 04:18:32,840
It says...

6042
04:18:33,980 --> 04:18:35,820
This one is written...

6043
04:18:35,820 --> 04:18:36,640
Heliport.

6044
04:18:37,700 --> 04:18:38,220
Heliport.

6045
04:18:39,300 --> 04:18:40,460
Go to Heliport.

6046
04:18:41,240 --> 04:18:42,660
Would you rather be... Actually...

6047
04:18:42,980 --> 04:18:44,140
How do you pronounce that?

6048
04:18:45,720 --> 04:18:46,740
It's like Yuki.

6049
04:18:48,240 --> 04:18:50,120
Would you rather be friends with...

6050
04:18:50,120 --> 04:18:52,460
Paz, Quiet, Meryl, the boss, or Eva?

6051
04:18:58,460 --> 04:18:58,980
Probably...

6052
04:18:59,640 --> 04:18:59,900
Sunny.

6053
04:19:02,860 --> 04:19:06,300
And then this is probably to the nuclear warhead building.

6054
04:19:06,700 --> 04:19:07,860
As if I had to guess.

6055
04:19:10,660 --> 04:19:12,300
But, but, but... Thermal goggles!

6056
04:19:12,720 --> 04:19:13,420
But, but, but, but...

6057
04:19:13,420 --> 04:19:14,260
But, but, but...

6058
04:19:14,260 --> 04:19:15,320
Thermal goggles!

6059
04:19:16,420 --> 04:19:17,780
Thermal goggles, my beloved!

6060
04:19:18,080 --> 04:19:19,180
T-t-t-Thermal goggles.

6061
04:19:19,940 --> 04:19:20,880
What are they playing?

6062
04:19:20,960 --> 04:19:21,400
Video games?

6063
04:19:22,420 --> 04:19:24,000
Alright, let's go stare at her.

6064
04:19:24,200 --> 04:19:25,800
Let's go stare at a pretty lady.

6065
04:19:26,720 --> 04:19:28,980
I love staring at a pretty face.

6066
04:19:37,800 --> 04:19:38,240
What?

6067
04:19:38,660 --> 04:19:39,500
What is it?

6068
04:19:39,600 --> 04:19:41,380
Oh my god, she started to get red immediately.

6069
04:19:41,600 --> 04:19:42,140
Did you see that?

6070
04:19:45,540 --> 04:19:46,980
What are you staring at?

6071
04:19:47,200 --> 04:19:48,500
I can see it so clearly.

6072
04:19:48,500 --> 04:19:48,600
Clearly.

6073
04:19:48,760 --> 04:19:55,040
I never used to be able to see it that well, but now I can see it, like, happening.

6074
04:19:56,200 --> 04:19:57,240
Come on, Snake.

6075
04:20:00,440 --> 04:20:00,920
She's kidding.

6076
04:20:08,780 --> 04:20:10,020
What are you doing?

6077
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:14,760
Silly boy.

6078
04:20:18,320 --> 04:20:18,820
What?

6079
04:20:18,820 --> 04:20:19,740
What is it?

6080
04:20:19,840 --> 04:20:21,480
Is this as red as it goes, or...

6081
04:20:22,320 --> 04:20:24,220
I think I remember her getting quite red.

6082
04:20:25,760 --> 04:20:27,240
What are you staring at?

6083
04:20:29,660 --> 04:20:30,560
Stop it.

6084
04:20:30,960 --> 04:20:31,900
Shy girl.

6085
04:20:32,340 --> 04:20:32,920
Shy girl.

6086
04:20:33,340 --> 04:20:34,280
Come on, Snake.

6087
04:20:35,480 --> 04:20:36,480
She's so red.

6088
04:20:37,080 --> 04:20:38,000
She's folding.

6089
04:20:38,080 --> 04:20:38,640
I know.

6090
04:20:38,740 --> 04:20:40,940
All it takes is for Snake to, like, look at her...

6091
04:20:40,940 --> 04:20:42,340
Don't stare at me like that.

6092
04:20:42,560 --> 04:20:44,600
...saying nothing, and she just folds.

6093
04:20:44,760 --> 04:20:46,420
Man, he is so powerful.

6094
04:20:48,760 --> 04:20:49,940
What are you doing?

6095
04:20:50,360 --> 04:20:51,800
We've got to get a move on.

6096
04:20:51,960 --> 04:20:53,980
I had no idea Meryl was this much of a baddie.

6097
04:20:54,020 --> 04:20:55,760
No wonder I've seen so much fan art of her.

6098
04:20:55,900 --> 04:20:56,000
Oh!

6099
04:20:56,500 --> 04:20:57,780
I know, right?

6100
04:20:57,920 --> 04:20:58,280
She's...

6101
04:20:58,280 --> 04:20:58,480
What?

6102
04:20:58,900 --> 04:20:59,660
What is it?

6103
04:20:59,780 --> 04:20:59,960
Okay.

6104
04:21:01,160 --> 04:21:01,840
Look at her!

6105
04:21:01,880 --> 04:21:02,620
She's so red!

6106
04:21:04,840 --> 04:21:05,560
You're cute.

6107
04:21:05,800 --> 04:21:06,280
You're cute.

6108
04:21:08,320 --> 04:21:11,000
Why can't I go into the... I need a card to go to the bathroom?

6109
04:21:12,220 --> 04:21:13,460
Snake, what are you doing?

6110
04:21:13,460 --> 04:21:15,260
Let's go to the commander's room.

6111
04:21:17,360 --> 04:21:20,220
The commander will see you now, Mr. Foxhound.

6112
04:21:21,600 --> 04:21:23,580
You would also fold if Snake stared at you.

6113
04:21:23,700 --> 04:21:24,580
You're 100% correct.

6114
04:21:26,580 --> 04:21:27,480
I love this guy.

6115
04:21:28,820 --> 04:21:29,980
Oh my god!

6116
04:21:30,060 --> 04:21:30,560
Look at her!

6117
04:21:32,880 --> 04:21:34,320
What are you staring at?

6118
04:21:34,400 --> 04:21:36,280
She is a tomato over there!

6119
04:21:36,860 --> 04:21:37,640
My goodness.

6120
04:21:38,040 --> 04:21:38,900
Damn, Doki.

6121
04:21:41,980 --> 04:21:42,400
Okay.

6122
04:21:42,400 --> 04:21:44,040
If I save...

6123
04:21:45,760 --> 04:21:47,880
Will I have to like find her again?

6124
04:21:48,140 --> 04:21:49,180
Or where will it...

6125
04:21:49,180 --> 04:21:49,520
You know what?

6126
04:21:49,560 --> 04:21:51,600
Let's go to another... Can I go to another floor?

6127
04:21:52,560 --> 04:21:53,680
No, I can't.

6128
04:21:54,520 --> 04:21:54,940
Hmm...

6129
04:21:56,040 --> 04:21:58,240
If I save... It won't let me switch floors.

6130
04:22:01,460 --> 04:22:04,040
Snake, let's hurry up and go to the commander's room.

6131
04:22:04,300 --> 04:22:04,580
Okay.

6132
04:22:04,580 --> 04:22:04,840
Okay...

6133
04:22:06,740 --> 04:22:10,660
Do I have to do... Can I do Psycho Mantis in 30 minutes?

6134
04:22:11,320 --> 04:22:12,200
It also...

6135
04:22:12,200 --> 04:22:14,380
It is said that you are cute bot...

6136
04:22:14,380 --> 04:22:14,580
What?

6137
04:22:14,580 --> 04:22:14,840
What?

6138
04:22:14,840 --> 04:22:15,080
What?

6139
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:15,500
What?

6140
04:22:15,500 --> 04:22:15,760
What?

6141
04:22:15,760 --> 04:22:16,000
What?

6142
04:22:16,000 --> 04:22:16,340
What?

6143
04:22:16,440 --> 04:22:16,500
What?

6144
04:22:16,500 --> 04:22:16,700
What?

6145
04:22:16,700 --> 04:22:16,800
What?

6146
04:22:16,880 --> 04:22:16,880
What?

6147
04:22:16,940 --> 04:22:17,040
What?

6148
04:22:17,060 --> 04:22:17,060
What?

6149
04:22:17,060 --> 04:22:17,100
What?

6150
04:22:17,220 --> 04:22:17,880
We're not talking about me.

6151
04:22:17,980 --> 04:22:18,820
We're not talking about me.

6152
04:22:19,240 --> 04:22:20,800
It will load up after meeting her.

6153
04:22:20,880 --> 04:22:21,520
Oh, okay great.

6154
04:22:22,020 --> 04:22:24,240
Then I'm gonna... Let's do some codex first.

6155
04:22:24,840 --> 04:22:26,280
And then I'll...

6156
04:22:26,840 --> 04:22:28,600
Colonel, your niece is fine.

6157
04:22:29,080 --> 04:22:29,840
Thank goodness.

6158
04:22:30,000 --> 04:22:30,160
For now.

6159
04:22:30,360 --> 04:22:30,960
You can't relax.

6160
04:22:31,180 --> 04:22:31,760
Not yet.

6161
04:22:31,920 --> 04:22:32,400
I know.

6162
04:22:32,500 --> 04:22:32,740
Yeah.

6163
04:22:38,500 --> 04:22:39,900
Talk about life.

6164
04:22:39,920 --> 04:22:41,620
Don't talk about his family like that.

6165
04:22:44,560 --> 04:22:45,120
Stop.

6166
04:22:47,260 --> 04:22:49,600
What are you planning to do to her?

6167
04:22:49,960 --> 04:22:50,620
Save her.

6168
04:22:58,700 --> 04:23:00,180
I'll explain afterwards.

6169
04:23:00,180 --> 04:23:00,520
I get it.

6170
04:23:00,760 --> 04:23:03,440
All the world's a stage and we're merely players, right?

6171
04:23:03,780 --> 04:23:04,220
Yes.

6172
04:23:04,460 --> 04:23:06,600
But even players can influence the play.

6173
04:23:07,080 --> 04:23:09,300
I just hope we can prevent it from having a bad ending.

6174
04:23:09,500 --> 04:23:09,940
Stop!

6175
04:23:10,300 --> 04:23:11,520
Stop pointing at me!

6176
04:23:13,380 --> 04:23:19,500
So, for those who don't know, there is an option to save the animals or kill the animals.

6177
04:23:19,820 --> 04:23:22,140
You can save Meryl or you can kill Meryl.

6178
04:23:22,200 --> 04:23:27,760
It's in a scene coming up-ish.

6179
04:23:27,920 --> 04:23:29,520
A little ways away.

6180
04:23:31,120 --> 04:23:34,580
Coming up after the next two bosses.

6181
04:23:37,320 --> 04:23:42,320
But if you save her and if you kill her, it's two different endings.

6182
04:23:43,180 --> 04:23:54,880
I will be saving her because it's the canon ending and since I'll be playing through all the games, I want to do the canon ending so that it matches with the timeline of what I'll be playing.

6183
04:23:56,180 --> 04:23:58,760
So that's my thought process with it.

6184
04:23:58,820 --> 04:24:00,020
Just like Super Metroid.

6185
04:24:00,180 --> 04:24:00,900
Exactly.

6186
04:24:02,960 --> 04:24:04,460
What do you mean canon in quotes?

6187
04:24:06,460 --> 04:24:12,000
But if you're interested in the other ending, we totally did it in Twin Snakes so you can go watch it there.

6188
04:24:14,060 --> 04:24:14,500
Master!

6189
04:24:14,880 --> 04:24:16,900
You managed to link up with Meryl.

6190
04:24:17,000 --> 04:24:17,440
Good.

6191
04:24:17,780 --> 04:24:18,240
Stop calling me cute.

6192
04:24:18,240 --> 04:24:22,100
So now you must have the card keys that will override the detonation code.

6193
04:24:22,400 --> 04:24:23,200
You should hurry.

6194
04:24:23,440 --> 04:24:25,080
The time limit is running out.

6195
04:24:25,160 --> 04:24:25,620
Okay, Master.

6196
04:24:25,720 --> 04:24:26,360
I'll do it for you.

6197
04:24:26,900 --> 04:24:28,040
I'll do it for you, Master.

6198
04:24:30,220 --> 04:24:31,620
What do I call Meryl?

6199
04:24:32,720 --> 04:24:33,340
No response.

6200
04:24:33,680 --> 04:24:34,260
Come on, pick up.

6201
04:24:34,880 --> 04:24:35,720
Pick up, Meryl.

6202
04:24:36,620 --> 04:24:39,480
She's like looking at me like, hey, let's get a move on, buddy.

6203
04:24:45,210 --> 04:24:46,570
You found Meryl.

6204
04:24:49,770 --> 04:24:53,270
I forgot how to say hello.

6205
04:24:53,570 --> 04:24:57,670
Matara taught me how to say hello in Russian.

6206
04:25:00,630 --> 04:25:03,590
If I heard it, I would know it, I think.

6207
04:25:03,770 --> 04:25:04,090
Oh!

6208
04:25:04,490 --> 04:25:04,970
Privyet!

6209
04:25:05,150 --> 04:25:05,610
Yes!

6210
04:25:05,870 --> 04:25:06,350
Privyet!

6211
04:25:07,030 --> 04:25:07,510
Yeah!

6212
04:25:09,450 --> 04:25:10,350
I remember.

6213
04:25:10,650 --> 04:25:10,990
I remember.

6214
04:25:11,410 --> 04:25:12,630
Well, because you guys typed it.

6215
04:25:15,530 --> 04:25:19,750
Thank you for running this event and working towards solving hyper-cancer.

6216
04:25:20,450 --> 04:25:22,630
Please put this towards saving the animal.

6217
04:25:24,010 --> 04:25:25,150
Can I get a hype?

6218
04:25:26,290 --> 04:25:27,450
You mean to stop?

6219
04:25:27,670 --> 04:25:28,410
Stop it!

6220
04:25:28,590 --> 04:25:29,390
Stop it!

6221
04:25:29,830 --> 04:25:31,550
Okay, let's talk to Mayling.

6222
04:25:33,350 --> 04:25:35,110
It's a good thing you hooked up with Meryl.

6223
04:25:35,530 --> 04:25:36,710
You should have seen the Colonel.

6224
04:25:36,910 --> 04:25:41,690
He doesn't like to let it show because he's the boss, but he was so happy he could barely contain himself.

6225
04:25:42,090 --> 04:25:43,250
I'm glad to hear that.

6226
04:25:44,630 --> 04:25:45,110
Save.

6227
04:25:49,610 --> 04:25:50,550
Okay, guys.

6228
04:25:51,270 --> 04:25:55,710
Next week we're starting with Psycho Mantis.

6229
04:25:55,710 --> 04:25:57,290
Oh my goodness gracious.

6230
04:25:57,750 --> 04:26:01,130
I don't know if I will Endurance to the end.

6231
04:26:01,510 --> 04:26:03,150
I still have quite a ways away.

6232
04:26:03,650 --> 04:26:05,270
I'm not even halfway through the game.

6233
04:26:05,730 --> 04:26:07,350
What would be halfway through the game?

6234
04:26:08,930 --> 04:26:09,530
Hmm...

6235
04:26:11,290 --> 04:26:12,250
Kindy, maybe?

6236
04:26:15,170 --> 04:26:16,390
Greetings from Germany.

6237
04:26:16,950 --> 04:26:17,550
Greetings from Germany.

6238
04:26:21,470 --> 04:26:22,930
Psycho Mantis is halfway, maybe?

6239
04:26:26,370 --> 04:26:28,270
When it tells you to insert disc 2?

6240
04:26:28,410 --> 04:26:29,130
No, no.

6241
04:26:29,190 --> 04:26:30,010
That's further...

6242
04:26:30,010 --> 04:26:31,970
That's further down, I believe.

6243
04:26:32,930 --> 04:26:33,410
Yeah.

6244
04:26:35,270 --> 04:26:36,410
Raven is near the end.

6245
04:26:36,530 --> 04:26:38,250
Yeah, Raven is the last boss fight.

6246
04:26:40,190 --> 04:26:40,670
Before...

6247
04:26:41,710 --> 04:26:42,190
Rex.

6248
04:26:42,950 --> 04:26:43,850
Sorry, spoilers.

6249
04:26:44,230 --> 04:26:44,930
For people.

6250
04:26:45,110 --> 04:26:46,050
I'm just trying to think.

6251
04:26:46,310 --> 04:26:47,190
I'm just trying to think.

6252
04:26:48,030 --> 04:26:50,190
God see you back in good form.

6253
04:26:50,250 --> 04:26:51,490
Good luck on Mantis next week.

6254
04:26:52,930 --> 04:26:53,190
Thank you!

6255
04:26:54,470 --> 04:26:56,170
I just... I have...

6256
04:26:57,630 --> 04:26:58,730
Like I said, I didn't...

6257
04:26:58,730 --> 04:27:00,270
I didn't sleep...

6258
04:27:00,270 --> 04:27:01,630
I went to bed at like 5 am.

6259
04:27:01,770 --> 04:27:04,470
I get a delayed jet lag.

6260
04:27:04,630 --> 04:27:08,270
So when I first come back from Japan, I'm usually fine for the first couple of days.

6261
04:27:08,390 --> 04:27:12,150
And then after a couple of days, I can't go to sleep until 4 or 5 am.

6262
04:27:12,370 --> 04:27:14,110
But I still wake up at 10 am.

6263
04:27:14,410 --> 04:27:17,530
I mean, it's still 5 hours of sleep, which isn't bad.

6264
04:27:17,710 --> 04:27:21,070
But if I'm recovering from sick, I don't want to push it too much.

6265
04:27:25,310 --> 04:27:25,810
But...

6266
04:27:27,070 --> 04:27:27,570
But...

6267
04:27:27,570 --> 04:27:28,110
But...

6268
04:27:28,110 --> 04:27:30,050
Yeah, I guess maybe...

6269
04:27:30,050 --> 04:27:32,370
the hind D would be halfway.

6270
04:27:32,710 --> 04:27:33,210
Probably.

6271
04:27:33,470 --> 04:27:33,830
Thank you.

6272
04:27:33,890 --> 04:27:35,170
I wish this could go all night.

6273
04:27:35,410 --> 04:27:37,750
Well, maybe next time we will go all night.

6274
04:27:38,830 --> 04:27:40,930
I might just get so into it.

6275
04:27:41,010 --> 04:27:42,690
I might just be like...

6276
04:27:42,690 --> 04:27:44,770
I'm gonna go forever!

6277
04:27:46,670 --> 04:27:47,670
So, yeah.

6278
04:27:48,170 --> 04:27:49,750
But yeah, have fun watching.

6279
04:27:49,750 --> 04:27:52,910
If anybody's watching Doki, have fun watching her tonight.

6280
04:27:53,230 --> 04:27:59,110
And also the debuts, the next Hololive debuts, the Justice debuts, I wanted to be watching.

6281
04:27:59,310 --> 04:28:01,390
I didn't realize... I thought they were Saturday, Sunday.

6282
04:28:01,710 --> 04:28:03,090
I didn't realize it was yesterday.

6283
04:28:03,290 --> 04:28:03,610
But...

6284
04:28:05,490 --> 04:28:08,990
But we had already made our schedule before it was announced.

6285
04:28:09,090 --> 04:28:11,790
So I was just like...

6286
04:28:11,790 --> 04:28:12,650
Afterwards, I was like...

6287
04:28:12,650 --> 04:28:13,950
I didn't realize.

6288
04:28:16,610 --> 04:28:17,650
So, whoopsie.

6289
04:28:18,950 --> 04:28:19,530
But...

6290
04:28:19,530 --> 04:28:20,370
Yeah.

6291
04:28:21,690 --> 04:28:22,530
Exciting weekend.

6292
04:28:22,970 --> 04:28:27,750
Thanks for kicking off Metal Gear with me.

6293
04:28:28,130 --> 04:28:31,130
Hopefully I didn't do so poorly.

6294
04:28:32,450 --> 04:28:35,390
Putting my incentive to school 666 right.

6295
04:28:37,570 --> 04:28:38,150
Okay.

6296
04:28:38,870 --> 04:28:39,590
We'll see.

6297
04:28:40,850 --> 04:28:42,510
I might have to...

6298
04:28:42,510 --> 04:28:45,810
I mean, I don't think the game is out yet.

6299
04:28:45,870 --> 04:28:49,770
But we also might need some time to grow additional brain cells anyway.

6300
04:28:50,570 --> 04:28:53,050
Spank, thanks for the 10 gift and thank you!

6301
04:28:53,210 --> 04:28:53,690
Thank you!

6302
04:28:54,850 --> 04:28:56,810
But yeah, so...

6303
04:28:57,830 --> 04:29:00,150
Always fun watching people play games they love.

6304
04:29:00,430 --> 04:29:02,830
Yeah, maybe next week we might endurance it.

6305
04:29:02,910 --> 04:29:03,390
Who knows?

6306
04:29:03,610 --> 04:29:04,050
Who knows?

6307
04:29:04,770 --> 04:29:09,170
I might be tired because I have a pretty busy week next week.

6308
04:29:10,190 --> 04:29:12,530
But I'll talk about that later.

6309
04:29:13,770 --> 04:29:14,890
And yeah!

6310
04:29:15,250 --> 04:29:16,130
Metal Gear!

6311
04:29:17,650 --> 04:29:18,570
I'm nervous about Psycho Mantis.

6312
04:29:18,910 --> 04:29:21,770
But I handled the other bosses pretty well, so...

6313
04:29:22,650 --> 04:29:23,670
Maybe I'll...

6314
04:29:23,670 --> 04:29:25,510
Maybe my gamer skills have improved.

6315
04:29:25,930 --> 04:29:27,210
Thanks to Master Miller.

6316
04:29:27,710 --> 04:29:29,790
Use your instincts as a gamer!

6317
04:29:31,010 --> 04:29:31,610
So...

6318
04:29:31,610 --> 04:29:33,250
You know, maybe... I don't know.

6319
04:29:33,310 --> 04:29:37,850
Maybe Metal Gear Rex won't take me so long.

6320
04:29:39,250 --> 04:29:46,890
I seem to have like a brief recollection of taking the longest time with Rex, but we'll see.

6321
04:29:47,650 --> 04:29:49,890
I think I've improved as a gamer a little bit.

6322
04:29:52,670 --> 04:29:53,910
Your skills have improved?

6323
04:29:54,330 --> 04:30:01,750
You were quite fast though.

6324
04:30:01,990 --> 04:30:03,170
Yeah, I think so.

6325
04:30:05,450 --> 04:30:06,290
Thank you everybody!

6326
04:30:07,310 --> 04:30:08,170
Thank you!

6327
04:30:08,290 --> 04:30:09,210
I'm gonna go eat.

6328
04:30:09,350 --> 04:30:10,510
I'm hungry, hungry, hungry.

6329
04:30:10,870 --> 04:30:11,950
I'm a hungry ghost.

6330
04:30:12,230 --> 04:30:13,490
And you guys should as well.

6331
04:30:13,670 --> 04:30:16,390
And enjoy the rest of your Saturday!

6332
04:30:16,990 --> 04:30:19,510
Or if it's Sunday for you, get some rest.

6333
04:30:19,610 --> 04:30:20,050
What are you doing?

6334
04:30:20,090 --> 04:30:20,430
Still awake?

6335
04:30:21,050 --> 04:30:21,690
Good night!

6336
04:30:23,590 --> 04:30:24,030
Master!

6337
04:30:24,570 --> 04:30:24,890
Master!

6338
04:30:25,830 --> 04:30:26,550
Bye bye!

6339
04:30:27,130 --> 04:30:27,770
Bye bye!

6340
04:30:27,790 --> 04:30:28,130
Bye bye!

6341
04:30:28,190 --> 04:30:28,430
Bye bye!

6342
04:30:28,590 --> 04:30:32,370
See you guys tomorrow for more Doom!

6343
04:30:34,390 --> 04:30:35,050
Bye bye!

6344
04:30:35,210 --> 04:30:35,910
Thank you guys!

6345
04:30:35,990 --> 04:30:36,590
Thank you so much!

6346
04:30:36,670 --> 04:30:39,810
Thanks for letting me indulge in my brain rot a little bit more.

6347
04:30:41,090 --> 04:30:41,750
Bye bye!

6348
04:30:56,780 --> 04:31:00,760
I just realized I didn't let Mei Ling finish like speaking.

6349
04:31:00,900 --> 04:31:02,700
But all she said was talk to you later, Snake.

6350
04:31:02,800 --> 04:31:04,400
She didn't give me a proverb or anything.

6351
04:31:04,780 --> 04:31:05,920
I think she hates me.

6352
04:31:06,640 --> 04:31:08,100
Mei Ling hates me!

6353
04:31:08,280 --> 04:31:09,660
She hates me!

6354
04:31:10,720 --> 04:31:12,900
Mei Ling hates me, you guys!

6355
04:31:14,280 --> 04:31:15,780
She hates me!

6356
04:31:16,800 --> 04:31:18,340
Mei Ling hates me!

6357
04:31:19,700 --> 04:31:21,800
Oh my god, she hates me!

6358
04:31:23,260 --> 04:31:25,240
Mei Ling hates me!

6359
04:31:26,020 --> 04:31:26,600
No!
