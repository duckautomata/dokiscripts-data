00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,830
I've been broadcasting the whole time.

2
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,890
There's no privacy here, man.

3
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,270
Magic wand.

4
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,570
Look at the quick one.

5
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,070
Twitch viewers out here like, it's not a stream unless we
have 20 minutes of tech support.

6
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,870
We did have 20 minutes of tech support.

7
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,670
Yes.

8
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,230
Yeah, but if we were on YouTube, nobody would have seen it.

9
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,670
They get to listen to 20 minutes of the loading screen.

10
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,650
Look at him.

11
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,530

25
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,990
That doesn't sound very magical.

26
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,530
Well, if it's magical piss it is.

27
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,610
Magical piss.

28
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,050

We'll get you one.

Tempest.

41
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,310
Yes, the power of the four wins.

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,330

Did it grow?

109
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,570

We're teleporting!

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,670
Are you going!

119
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,050
Wait you...

120
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,030
Did anyone look at the contract?

121
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,270
What happened?

122
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:32,750
What happened to me?

123
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,150
Oh,

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,380

125
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,700
We're okay.

126
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,040
We just saw your friends.

127
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you teleport хотя?

128
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,980
Oh, that's me.

129
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,540
Wait, my frog came with me!

130
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,640
Oh, shit.

131
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,580
Well, our wards came with us, too.

132
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,660
I'll put everybody up.

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,380
Oh, nice.

134
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,600
Kind of magic playing.

135
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Uh, song on your mom.

136
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,420
Oh, that's my favorite wand.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,180
How did you know?

138
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,340
I want to see you.

139
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,760
What are we doing in this game?

140
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,660
What do we do, actually?

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,280
You now.

142
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,740
Oculus!

143
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,140
Oculus.

144
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,120
You have to get quota.

145
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,020
It's like lethal.

146
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,620
Yeah, yeah, but like...

147
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,680
I didn't read our job description.

148
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,980
Did anyone read what our contract wanted us to do?

149
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,400
We have to explode swine with piss and steal at least two
gold.

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,760
I forget what the third one was.

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,790
Who did that, Tempest?

152
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,590
No, not me!

153
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:32,990
That me!

154
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,270
I don't even have a wand!

155
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,150
Oops.

156
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,030
Wait, plus five.

157
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,850
Oh, you get money by breaking things.

158
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,410
You get money by breaking things.

159
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,970
I have.

160
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,150
That is.

161
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,390
All right, so where's Zelda?

162
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,190
Yeah, if you assault those boxes, it seems to do things.

163
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,510
I feel like a freaking muggle here.

164
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,790
I can't do anything.

165
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,150
Who did that?

166
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,910
Who did that?

167
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,310
Who did that?

168
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,390
Powdered crystal.

169
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,030
That's Tempest.

170
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,250
Does that stash me?

171
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,770
Oh.

172
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:11,750
Oh.

173
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,970
Arrow.

174
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,870
Oh.

175
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,310
But how do we break things with pitch?

176
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,010
This is beautiful.

177
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,910
Thank you.

178
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:32,930
Yellow Tempest.

179
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,150
I don't know where.

180
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,330
Yeah, we need a different genre movie to break things with
kids.

181
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,840
Wait, it's kind of dark in here.

182
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,140
I have a lantern.

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,420
This is my brilliant show.

184
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,660
You do?

185
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah.

186
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,160
You're so smart!

187
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,860
I'm so intelligent!

He's at the bottom of the stairs.

256
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,340
He's at the bottom of the stairs.

257
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,820
There's no fall damage, so we can jump down if we have to.

258
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,580
Oh, there's no one?

259
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,060

267

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,580

I count four of us.

285
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,880
We're missing one person in this group.

286
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,020
Limu's probably working and doing a job.

287
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,280
See, Limu is on the ground.

288
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,020

We don't have enough.

291
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,640
We put that one person in the group project that does all
our work and we're just chilling.

292
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,300
We were doing research.

Peppist!

298
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,320

Oh, he is?

300
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,880
Yeah, he's pretty chill.

301
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,120
He simply doesn't seem to like us.

302
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:44,600
Whoa

303
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,470

Arrow.

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:08,950
Arrow.

323
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,370
Arrow is such a shitty spell.

324
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,770
I'm not pulling my weight, you guys.

325
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,870
This is like a weight.

326
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:14,690

Is this guy evil?

330
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:24,810
Oh!

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,610

332
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,230
He's not dead!

333
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:27,790
He's not dead!

334
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,190
He's not dead!

335
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:28,770
He's not dead!

336
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:28,870
He's not dead!

337
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,310
There's a bomb!

338
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,770
He's dropping money!

339
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,450
Oh, Q is how you drop stuff.

340
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,420
I'll take a torch.

341
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
Can I light things on fire now?

342
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh, I can!

343
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,260
Wait, where'd that guy go?

344
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,220
I'll light him on fire.

345
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,260
Wait, let me test on you.

346
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,320
Oh, sorry.

347
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,280
Sorry to me.

348
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,380
I thought you were Doki.

349
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,500
No.

350
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,420
I'm setting everything on fire.

351
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,220
Okay, it was really bright, okay?

352
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,000
Don't talk.

353
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,420
Wow, you can't, you miss every time.

354
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:20,880
You miss.

355
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,900
You can't even cast a spell I think the goblin dude just
threw a bomb at me.

356
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,400
Yeah, he does that.

357
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,550
Yeah, he's quite rude.

358
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
What's this way?

359
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,690
Well, we're about to die, so I'm gonna go explore.

360
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,560
What's that?

361
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,100
Oh, I got jump scared by the candle holder.

362
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,360
I don't know what this is.

363
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,080
What's down there?

364
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,340
A new place?

365
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,220
Yeah.

366
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,400
Okay, I'll go down.

367
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh.

368
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,380
There's no fall damage, so you'll be fine.

369
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,340
Nibi?

370
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:02,980
Nibi?

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,480
Nibi?

372
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,160
What happened?

373
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
What happened to her?

374
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,160
I don't know.

375
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,380
She just said I'll go down and then...

376
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,600
What did you...

377
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,060
You committed a crime.

378
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,780
I didn't do it.

379
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,540
I didn't do it.

380
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,540
We got...

381
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,760
You were the last person next to her.

382
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,320
Don't put her down there.

383
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,120
Don't put her down.

384
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,280
Don't worry.

385
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,260
Don't worry.

386
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,000
Ahaydi, don't worry.

387
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,660
Oh, she, oh, that's why she jumped down and it reappeared
there.

388
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,560
I think that pit was a bottomless pit.

389
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,720
I think so.

390
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
Oh, no.

391
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,920
Well, Nimi, we're about to die anyway.

392
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,540
It's okay.

393
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,660
No, no, no, no.

394
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,280
We got this.

395
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,080
We have one minute to get $90.

396
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,380
Extract.

397
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,440
How do I extract?

398
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,580
We still need $90, man.

399
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,360
Are you extracting?

400
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,320
acting right now?

401
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,780
I don't know what that means.

402
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,040
It means going back home.

403
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,620
Oh!

404
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,680
Oh, I didn't realize that's what that was.

405
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,360
My bad.

406
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,500
Okay, so what are we going to do with the body?

407
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,320
Can we burn it?

408
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,080
We might.

409
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,720
What's this?

410
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,360
Oh, I'm watching people.

411
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,340
Oh, I'm pondering.

412
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,380
Whoa, I'm...

413
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,100
Is that limo?

414
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,320
When we leave?

415
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,420
When we leave.

416
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,900
Wait, wait, wait, extract, extract.

417
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,500
For real.

418
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah?

419
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay, not all.

420
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,140
We have to wait for everybody.

421
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,200
Come, come, come, come, come.

422
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
They don't know we're here.

423
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,880
Oh, we're screwed.

424
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,760
Goodbye.

425
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,180
Goodbye.

426
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, what a problem.

427
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,560
Wait, what does the ghost approaches mean?

428
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:39,760
It's okay.

429
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,340
We're fine.

430
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
We're about to go land, though.

431
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,820
It's okay.

432
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,140
We'll be alive.

433
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,780
What does the ghost...

434
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,060
Wait.

435
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,160
Oh, okay.

436
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,860
I made it.

437
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,520
Oh.

438
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:50,880
No.

439
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,820
We made it.

440
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,380
We made it.

441
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:03,980
wait did we oh three players missed extraction oh i got
eaten by a ghost i don't think we made it we lost we lost

442
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:14,740
200 gold yeah we didn't make it we did we did we'll be fine
we'll be fine wait what what do the ghost look like now oh

443
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:24,820
we only have 22 personal gold well that's beans wait what
wait do i get it wait that means like the company takes 90

444
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:34,860
we only earn like 5% in the company takes 95 I think they
might have docked our earnings yeah but 22 of each we had

445
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:41,640
it's at 760 how do you cast a spell oh here but yeah I think
I think it's it might be that anything we get over is

446
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,020
spendable it's like I think it's like lethal company where
we have three nights we have the quota yeah and I think if

447
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:55,500
you don't get extracted am I dead no you're alive oh am I
alive what happened when you died I just died.

448
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,020
I fell down the hole.

449
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,460
Yeah.

450
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,960
Oh, yeah, no, that's fair.

451
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,420
Maybe we earned gold based on our chaos.

452
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,920
You're here, though.

453
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,040
It died instantly.

454
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,520
There wasn't even anything down there.

455
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:04,960
I know.

456
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,960
You just, I turned around and you were dead on the ground.

457
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,100
Yeah.

458
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,380
Yeah, maybe we should have stashed the gonads.

459
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,180
Oh, I stashed some stuff.

460
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,020
How do I get it out?

461
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,420
Yeah, how do I access to stash items?

462
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,600
Maybe you can give that man your balls?

463
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,080
Uh, excuse me?

464
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,060
I don't know how to open a shop.

465
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,880
You heard what a shop.

466
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,740
It's a jar complete.

467
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh.

468
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,980
I don't know.

469
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,340
I don't know if you can sell things.

470
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,840
I don't know either.

471
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,200
I don't know either.

472
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,880
Yeah, I have a fairy.

473
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,340
What's a dragon bone?

474
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,980
I mean, you could actually buy a dragon bone or an amber.

475
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,240
Wait, you can actually purchase the golem gonads.

476
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,760
He's got them here unless you just sell them.

477
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,940
Wait, I thought you were joking.

478
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,400
No, they are.

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,920
It looks like dates.

482
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,740
It was kind of hard to see in the game.

483
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,420
Dates.

484
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,920
Yeah, they look like little dates.

485
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:01,440

because i have the gonads and and if you didn't if you

Anti-repo.

555
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,160
You destroy everything instead of collect it.

Oh, blow his bombs on him.

573
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,960
It's okay, he can't hurt us until it's 10 minutes.

574
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,720
Arrow.

575
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,120
He's gone.

576
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,800
He's trying to hurt us, though.

577
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,340
Yeah, but apparently Lama said by a 10 minute.

578
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,980
They bring out the swords.

579
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,480
Oh, they bring out swords!

580
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,980
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,540
I took damage though.

582
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,540
Arrow!

583
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,000
Sorry, you said in front of my epic magic.

584
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,660
Arrow!

585
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Arrow!

586
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,540
Arrow!

587
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,220
Oh, she's dead!

588
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,540
Oh!

589
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,120
She's dead!

590
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,720
Oh!

591
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,460
Me?

592
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:12,840
Oh!

593
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,700
I wasn't me!

594
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,000
Mitt, that's...

595
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,540
That's two deaths, Mitt.

596
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:17,580
No!

597
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,080
Ah!

598
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,760
It's...

599
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,960
It's very weird that every time I...

600
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,740
No, she's alive!

601
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,240
Look at her!

602
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,780
Look at her go!

603
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,540
She's alive!

604
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,700
Every time I walk over here...

605
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,340
She's alive!

606
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,060
She's alive!

607
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,000
She's alive!

608
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,360
No, she's alive!

609
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,140
She's alive!

610
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,960
Snuffy, if you are alive, stay arrow.

611
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,580
Do you see what she's doing right now?

612
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,300
Yeah, yeah, what is she doing?

613
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,240
What is she doing?

614
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,740
Breaking it down, obviously.

615
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,940
Are we going to weekend at Bernie's list?

616
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,660
I'm not even holding her, are you?

617
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

618
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,780
Oh, you are holding her.

619
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,060
All right.

620
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,660
Oh, yeah.

621
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,300
I'll be the...

622
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,080
You'll be the voice.

623
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,060
I'll be the...

624
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,680
Oh, I'm getting injured by her.

625
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,120
Stop!

626
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,540
It's like, it's karma.

627
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,880
We're going to weekend at Snuffy's list.

628
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,240
I didn't do anything.

629
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,600
Wait.

630
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,840
Um, guys, I'm Stuffy, and, um, I'm a raccoon.

631
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,060
Guys...

632
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
She's just a raccoon.

633
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,320
That's all she is.

634
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm a sexy raccoon.

635
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,640
Oh, what just happened?

636
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,180
Oh.

637
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,420
What does that mean?

638
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,400
I don't know.

639
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,700
We stepped into some little...

640
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,260
There's orbs.

641
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,860
There's orbs.

642
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,760
Grab the orbs.

643
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,580
Oh, Arrow!

644
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,320
Arrow!

645
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,140
Wait, I'm stuck.

646
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,540
Oh my god.

647
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,300
I've stuck you with the life.

648
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,160
You don't know what to do.

649
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,600
No, she wouldn't!

650
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,860
Wait, I got one of them.

651
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,340
Wait, I've dug this.

652
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,640
I've dug this.

653
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,580
I've dug what?

654
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,340
No, this, this.

655
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,160
Do you see the orb?

656
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,920
Grab the orb.

657
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,900
I don't see an orb.

658
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,760
Oh my god.

659
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,440
I think that's what I, we can't get out.

660
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,100
Oh my god.

661
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,240
Oh my god, we're gonna die.

662
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,000
There's literally no orb.

663
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,660
It is.

664
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,900
I see it's right here.

665
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,200
Then you get it.

666
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,700
Oh.

667
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,120
Oh.

668
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,740
I think we're fine.

669
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, okay, he's scared.

670
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,380

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

She's killing me, for real.

701
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,370
The ghost.

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,090

I think we should find the extraction.

717
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,050

Okay.

727
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,270
I just can't stop watching Snuffy.

728
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,410
What is she doing on your screen?

729
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,270
She's currently under the ground.

730
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,950
Like, she's just...

731
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,970
She's really glitching out, like, crazy for me.

732
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,090
But, and to get close to her, she, like, hurts me because
she's, like, a weapon.

733
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:44,710
What?

734
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,110
Get away from me!

735
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,150
Get away!

736
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,350

mimic, and we don't know where he went.

I got mint.

775
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,120

Oh my god.

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm like a hairy girl.

780
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,380
I'm like a wild dog.

781
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,480
Oh my god.

782
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,740
No!

783
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,160
I didn't marry her before!

784
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,180
Put me down!

785
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,100

00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,280
No, they're cheating!

788
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,540
Don't worry, I'm the only one she does in here because she
knows I didn't commit a crime.

789
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,180
It's an unexpected twist of fate.

790
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,080
My body's gonna get revenge on everyone.

791
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,480
How did you die?

792
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,640
I flew off.

793
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,840
Like, I'm just blooming off this tower.

794
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,880
Oh, I think that was my fault.

795
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,180
I am blessed.

796
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,880
Break out.

797
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,640
I think so.

798
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,440
Oh He's a guy.

799
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,780
Oh, he's got a bomb Oh, oh

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:36,880

Hey, Doki, how did you?

802
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,370
Did you get killed by him?

803
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:53,150
Oh my god, no, no, no, no Oh, you got a god by a bomb Oh!

804
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,150
Arrows!

805
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,350
This is not an extraction!

806
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,610
I'm gonna die!

807
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,390
It's not an extraction?

808
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,150
Run!

809
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,790
No, it's not an extraction?

810
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,050
It's time for the moment they get here.

811
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,890
We thought it was safety.

812
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,950
It was not safety.

813
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:07,570
Oh.

814
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,750
What do we do?

815
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:09,910
What do we do?

816
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,170
I thought it was a warped extraction then.

817
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,070
Oh, wait.

818
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,970
I wasn't where you did that war.

819
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,250
Wait, this is the wrong way, I think.

820
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,370
Yeah.

821
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,990
Oh, yeah, that's it.

822
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,190
The ghost!

823
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,350
The ghost is here!

824
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,550
I want to see the ghost.

825
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,530
The ghost approaches.

826
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,250
I think...

827
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,070
I think I saw the ghost.

828
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,530
Ow.

829
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:37,510

830
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,570
Oh, hey!

831
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,370
Oh, the ghost is pretty!

832
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,270
Oh!

833
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:44,790

00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,450

00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,390
No way!

842
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,670

843
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,990
Yeah, wizards, we have to lock in.

844
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,270

It's where we have to go, where it takes us back to the main
base.

887
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,460
There's nothing here.

888
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,040
It's a dead end.

889
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,780
I don't believe you.

890
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,500

You just gotta park Oh, I didn't even see that part.

897

Yeah, I come down.

916
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,340
Alright, I'm gonna take the stairs.

917
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,040
Oh!

918
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,300
Tempest.

919
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,740
I know I don't have to do this.

920
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,540
I just don't remember.

921
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,860
I mean, it's easier.

922
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,300
Yeah.

923
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:44,940
For sure.

924
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,340
Yes.

925
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,500
Oh, it's the demon room.

926
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,280
Oh, it's...

927
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,040
Oh, wait.

928
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,580
It was the extraction room, but...

929
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,740
This is the extraction room?

930
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,440
It was.

931
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,160
This is where we extracted first, remember?

932
00:41:59,580 --> 00:41:59,840
Oh.

933
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,840
No, I don't remember, actually.

934
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,660
I actually don't know.

935
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I just made that up.

936
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,940
Why are you telling lies on the internet?

937
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,420
Tempest.

938
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,740
Tempest.

939
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,600
Wait, it didn't do it.

940
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,200
Tempest.

941
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,120
Oh, there it is.

942
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,880
Nice.

943
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,020
Wait, I got... I got back... What?

944
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,180
You got what?

945
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,680
What?

946
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,920
I got a bachelor's heart, look.

947
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,240
Look at this.

948
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,160
What is that?

949
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,760
Yeah, it's like...

950
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,300
We did it!

951
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,280
Yeah!

952
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:31,520
Yeah!

953
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,540
There's someone...

954
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,920
I think it must have been Lymo, I'm pretty sure.

955
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,840
She's the most competent player on our team.

956
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,380
I think we all sing.

957
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,960
No, I'm just kidding.

958
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,840
It definitely was Lymo.

959
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,380
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

960
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,860
What's this?

961
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,920
Wait, no, this is the extraction room.

962
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:51,640
Arrow.

963
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,900
No, it's not.

964
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,260
There's nothing to extract.

965
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,100
I thought this was the one we extracted from.

966
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,780
Maybe not.

967
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,100
Look at this.

968
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,960
You can open these.

969
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,640
Oh!

970
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,280
Yeah.

971
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,960
Oh, there's a blood rose in there.

972
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,740
There's money.

973
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,320
Oh, money.

974
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm sorry after you.

975
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,220
No, no, you can have it.

976
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,700
Try it.

977
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,660
I tried this.

978
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,920
I grabbed it.

979
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,020
I grabbed it.

980
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,780
Hold.

981
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,280

988
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,800
goal is We should figure out where the extraction is,
because there's an entire chest that she'll live and we

989
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,140
won't.

990
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,920
She's over here.

991
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,120
Arrow.

992
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,680

Oh.

997
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,240
Arrow.

Where is it?

1005
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,400
Oh, and a chest.

1006
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,160
Oh.

1007
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,060
How do you...

1008
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,180
Oh.

1009
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,260
Are we okay?

1010
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,160
That does not sound like a scream of victory.

1011
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,900
Wait, what was that?

1012
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,120
Lymo?

1013
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,760
Wait, Lymo's dead!

1014
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,380
Oh, no!

1015
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,000
Wait, how did she die?

1016
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,460
She just fell on me.

1017
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,060
Wait, where's the gold?

1018
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,900
It's so scary.

1019
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,380
She said there was a gold thing up there.

1020
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,060
She broke it.

1021
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,680
It was like sick.

1022
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,160
She said it in the chest and then she screamed.

1023
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah.

1024
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,360
Wait, look out, look out, look out!

1025
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,900
What's that?

1026
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,060
Shit, it's okay, it's okay.

1027
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,140
It's still...

1028
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,000
Five minutes left.

1029
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,060
He doesn't...

1030
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,940
It's a ceasefire.

1031
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,120
I think it might have been a mimic.

1032
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,220
Or something.

1033
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:29,760
Oh my gosh.

1034
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,460

00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,400
Oh, here!

1036
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,640
It says warp to extraction.

1037
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,240
This is the thing that...

1038
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,020
That Lime would try before, though.

1039
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:38,880
Will it work?

1040
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:39,680
Yeah.

1041
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,260
Oh, I don't know.

1042
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,260

Hold on, let me look.

00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,550
Oh, blessed one.

1228
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,070
Swap.

1229
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:10,470
Oh, what's that?

1230
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:11,530
Swap.

1231
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,470
Oh, it sounds cool down.

1232
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:13,750

00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,710
Where'd she go?

1237
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,770
Oh, she didn't even teleport behind you.

1238
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:20,330
Oh, no, she teleported.

1239
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,530
Okay.

1240
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,350
I just disappeared.

1241
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:22,310
Don't worry.

1242
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,030
This one is like teleporting and stuff, I guess.

1243
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,050
Oh, hello, everybody.

1244
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,130
I am fish.

1245
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,110
Wait, yours doesn't get the voice for some reason.

1246
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,450
She does.

1247
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,250
She has the voice.

1248
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,750
Are you saying don't you?

1249
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,350
Oh, no, the voice might make you.

1250
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,730
This is like Beyblade.

1251
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,690
Yeah, let it rip.

1252
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,990
I'm ripping it or I'm ripping it.

1253
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,770
I'm the noble steed.

1254
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,150
You are a beautiful noble, slightly stinky steed.

1255
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,490
Yeah, we'll save up for the last wand.

1256
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we gotta get that one.

1257
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,370
The blessed wand.

1258
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,230
That's gonna be a heal wand, right?

1259
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:00,690
I'll take the piss wand.

1260
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,310
Yeah, okay, is anyone's... is Lymo sounding weird?

1261
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,730
Weird or is that just my document?

1262
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:11,730
Why did you automatically pee on me?

1263
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,770
I didn't do it.

1264
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,330
I didn't even know it was going.

1265
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:15,110
Sorry.

1266
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,310
I couldn't hold it in.

1267
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,250
I couldn't hold it in.

1268
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:18,730
You didn't know this.

1269
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,170
I just know you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go.

1270
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,690
Do I sound weird, Doki?

1271
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,930
Yeah, you sound like you're like doubled up.

1272
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,030
Yeah, you sound normal to me.

1273
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,330
I think there's some glitches with the fish.

1274
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:32,730
Oh, yeah.

1275
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,310
Earlier, Doki kind of sounded like that.

1276
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:41,710
like she was in a box for me so i assume it like it's just a

1281
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:07,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1282
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,370
We see the slime.

1283
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:08,850
Yeah.

1284
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,770
That will be my duty.

1285
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:10,490
Piss on it.

1286
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:11,150
Yeah.

1287
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,130
Make sure to drink enough water, mate.

1288
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,510
Make sure you drink enough water.

1289
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,510
Oh, yeah, I will.

1290
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:17,550
Yeah.

1291
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,150
Yeah.

1292
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,210
Tempest.

1293
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,090
Yeah, reload.

1294
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,630
Oh, Tempest.

1295
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,230
Is there a one that lets me ponder lots of fire?

1296
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,670
Because I do like lots of fire.

1297
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,510
Oh, yeah, we need the fire.

1298
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,490
Oh, fuck, I hit my head.

1299
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,050
I'm looking for a slime.

1300
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,970
It's like when you get stung by jellyfish, you guys.

1301
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:38,930
I see a problem now.

1302
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,950
Oh, what's that?

1303
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,710
I don't have anything to, like, knock stuff down.

1304
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,230
You didn't keep your other ones?

1305
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,710
Throw it with your hands.

1306
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,170
Oh, no.

1307
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,350
I have something called astral eyes.

1308
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,030
It just lets me see things.

1309
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:54,590
Whoa.

1310
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:55,850
Oh.

1311
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:57,950
What does that do?

1312
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:58,510
Arrow.

1313
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,910
I think all the ones are overrated.

1314
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,230
I can see you all.

1315
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,490
It's like I have wizard vision.

1316
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:03,970
Wizard.

1317
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,730
We don't want to go in there.

1318
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,470
We don't want to go.

1319
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:07,990
Why?

1320
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,050
Turn him into a fish.

1321
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,430
He's kind of cool with it, though.

1322
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,430
Or piss on him.

1323
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:13,170
Wait, turn him in.

1324
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,050
Wait, see if he can turn him into a fish.

1325
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,370
Turn him into a fish.

1326
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,030
Fish, yuck.

1327
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:17,490
Oh,

1328
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,410
I don't think that worked.

1329
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,070
I don't think that worked.

1330
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:22,150
Wait, wait.

1331
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:22,670
Piss on him.

1332
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:23,310
Piss, on him.

1333
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:24,810
Piss, yuck.

1334
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,710
Do you think he likes it?

1335
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:29,230
Oh, he's mad.

1336
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,310
I don't think he likes it.

1337
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,810
He's mad.

1338
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:34,990
I'm too busy.

1339
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,970
Wait, don't, guys.

1340
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:36,970
Oh, with my eyes.

1341
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,670
It works!

1342
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:38,730
It works!

1343
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,270
It's the worst!

1344
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,270
Kill him!

1345
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,210
Kill him!

1346
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:42,670
Kill him!

1347
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:43,450
Arrow!

1348
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:45,750
Arrow!

1349
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:49,730
Fishyuck!

1350
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,570
That was the worst possible thing.

1351
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:52,330
Tempest!

1352
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:52,950
Tempest!

1353
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,870
Cried toward them.

1354
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:55,390
Tempest!

1355
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,110
Oh, it's like a big...

1356
00:56:59,110 --> 00:56:59,170
Tempest!

1357
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,150
Oh my God.

1358
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:01,650
Oh my God.

1359
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:02,750
Tempest is not working.

1360
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,010
Oh, there you go.

1361
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:05,150
Oh my God.

1362
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,550
Oh my God.

1363
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,590
Why does it go towards me?

1364
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,030
There's an eyeball!

1365
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,090
There's an eyeball that shoots...

1366
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,150
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1367
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,230
It's not okay!

1368
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:19,670
It's not okay!

1369
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:22,770
It doesn't...

1370
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:23,910
Achoo!

1371
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:25,370
Oh!

1372
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:25,830
Oh!

1373
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:28,270
Tempest!

1374
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,970
Oh, shoot.

1375
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:30,750
Why did I do that?

1376
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,530
I meant to do it in here.

1377
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,990
Arrow.

1378
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,470
Arrow.

1379
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:39,930
Arrow.

1380
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:42,170
Oh.

1381
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:50,020
Are we even damaging him?

1382
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,440
I don't think so.

1383
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,740
That room is too scary.

1384
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,560
I'll get out of there.

1385
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,940
What the heck is this?

1386
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,240
Oh.

1387
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,420
Nice.

1388
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,620
Kind of sick though.

1389
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,100
Oh.

1390
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,430
Piss yuck.

1391
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,150
What if I fill them up?

1392
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,150
I thought those were holes.

1393
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,050
Oh, I'm getting them yellow.

1394
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:26,130
Oh I'm actually getting them.

1395
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,110
I'm actually...

1396
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,330
They're actually turning yellow.

1397
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,710
Oh.

1398
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:34,350
I didn't mean to.

1399
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:35,970
Wait.

1400
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,330
Is anybody alive?

1401
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,310
It's a thing tap piss.

1402
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,630
Is anyone...

1403
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,950
Is anyone alive?

1404
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:45,770
Oh.

1405
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,430
Where's Lymo?

1406
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,510
I think Lymo is doing her job.

1407
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:53,950
Okay.

1408
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,150
But we're getting harassed by a man in armor.

1409
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,830
Oh hey!

1410
00:58:59,650 --> 00:58:59,950
Arrow!

1411
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:01,990
Arrow!

1412
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:02,910
Arrow!

1413
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:06,850
Wait, what's happening in here?

1414
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,230
Everything okay, okay?

1415
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,550
I've been burning things!

1416
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,130
Oh!

1417
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,310
Good job!

1418
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,670
Hello!

1419
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:12,070
Hello!

1420
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,270
Thank you.

1421
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,340
Look, I got this for you.

1422
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,250
Oh, thank you!

1423
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,290
I will.

1424
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,610
I'll drink it right now.

1425
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:21,330
What the hell?

1426
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:21,990
Tempest!

1427
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,790
Wait, we gotta go.

1428
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,930
Am I a frog?

1429
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,010
Oh, there's the door!

1430
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,310
Not yet!

1431
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,650
Oh, there's a door!

1432
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:31,490
Oh!

1433
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:35,750
Wait, did I die?

1434
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,150
Who's just trying to kill my human?

1435
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,350
No!

1436
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:41,770
No!

1437
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,570
I tried to become a frog.

1438
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,030
Did she drop her wand?

1439
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,350
Oh, I probably did.

1440
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,250
I'm always a ghost in game.

1441
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,770
That guy is tough.

1442
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,870
There's a frog down there.

1443
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,430
Oh no, no, no, no.

1444
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,390
Lumen.

1445
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,210
Oculus.

1446
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:09,470
Animal.

1447
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,370
Vita.

1448
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:13,610
Corpus!

1449
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:14,430
Is this me?

1450
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:15,930
Atlas!

1451
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:16,810
What is happening?

1452
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:17,510
Blumen!

1453
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,410
Oculus!

1454
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,790
What is going on?

1455
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:21,450
Anima!

1456
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,650
What is happening?

1457
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:23,130
Bit?

1458
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,590
Oh my god!

1459
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,940
I'll go get my stuff!

1460
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,240
Wait, I don't have my stuff though.

1461
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,340
Astral eyes.

1462
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:45,400
No!

1463
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,400

How do you get- Hello?

1474
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:47,370
Why is everything in this congregated into this room?

01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,890

1484
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,280

1485
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,260
What's up, me?

1486
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,780
You can revive people in this room.

1487
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,660
You can revive them.

1488
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,920
Yeah, I noticed that.

1489
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,480
You came back to life.

1490
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:15,860
Yeah.

1491
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:16,460
Oh.

1492
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,780
It's okay, we stay here.

1493
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:19,580
Wait!

1494
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,200
Oh yeah, he can't come in here.

1495
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,020
He can't come in here.

1496
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:22,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1497
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,600
He's our savior.

1498
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:23,820
Oh!

1499
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,460
What the fuck?

1500
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,120
I do live!

1501
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:27,700
You live!

1502
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,820
I didn't know!

1503
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,640
I don't know!

1504
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,500
Oh, don't look back.

1505
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,660
Gluck, gluck, gluck.

1506
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,680
Oh my god, the health potion only gives you 10 HP.

1507
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,420
What is the point?

1508
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,520
All right, I think we've got five in extraction.

1509
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,400
Oh, there's a frog.

1510
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,180
What's that?

1511
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh, yeah, the same frog I saw.

1512
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,980
Oh, you came down here and you chose to go back up?

1513
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,860
Like, why would you do that?

1514
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,720
No, there was a mimic.

1515
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,780
There was literally a mimic down here.

1516
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,360
Oh.

1517
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,300
Someone grab that.

1518
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:14,240
Open.

1519
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,340
Tempest.

1520
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:17,860
Tempest.

1521
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:18,580
Oh, see you got- Oh!

1522
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,120
Five.

1523
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,080
So, we might- I think someone's dead.

1524
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:24,980
No!

1525
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:25,860
May have- me perhaps.

1526
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,680
I don't think so.

1527
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:27,800
Tempest.

1528
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:28,540
Arrow.

1529
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:29,600
Shoot.

1530
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,320
I don't think everyone survived.

1531
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,280
Why is this area so hard?

1532
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,160
We did too good of- Fish, yuck!

1533
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,500
Good job!

1534
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,720
Run past it.

1535
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,800
Run past it.

1536
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,240
Run past him.

1537
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,640
Wait, but where do we run to?

1538
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,120
Arrow.

1539
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,620
Guys, this is a dead end.

1540
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,080
Arrow.

1541
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,340
Oh, shit.

1542
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,860
No, no, no, there's a stairs.

1543
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,540
There's stairs here.

1544
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,160
There's stairs here.

1545
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,080
Go, go, go, go, go.

1546
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,060
We gotta move.

1547
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,460
We gotta move.

1548
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,420
Where are we now?

1549
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,780
Um, we just gotta look for the extraction room.

1550
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,380
I found it!

1551
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:04,960
I found it!

1552
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:05,360
I found it!

1553
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:05,620
I found it!

1554
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,420
Oh, I found the porcelain throne!

1555
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,440
Guys, guys, come on!

1556
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,080
Tempest.

1557
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:11,800
Oh, oops.

1558
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,590
Warp East?

1559
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,370
Uh-oh, that's not the...

1560
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:30,630
Hello?

1561
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:33,690
Arrow.

1562
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:37,410
Wait, where's my...

1563
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:37,790
Arrow.

1564
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:39,530
Oh!

1565
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:40,510
Doki!

1566
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,350
I can't hear you.

1567
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,410
Wait, are you really Doki?

1568
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:46,870
Arrow.

1569
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,210
Are you really Doki?

1570
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,190
Jump if you're Doki.

1571
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,170
Okay.

1572
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:54,050
What happened?

1573
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,050
I can't hear you!

1574
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,290
I think Nimmy died.

1575
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,190
Are you telling me to follow?

1576
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:05,990
Come on, boy.

1577
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,070
Are you telling me to follow you?

1578
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,390
Is that what you're telling me?

1579
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,630
There's so much to destroy, though.

1580
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:20,680
Uh.

1581
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,900
Are you telling me to follow you?

1582
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,180
Are you... are you... Come on, boy, jump if you're telling
me to follow you.

1583
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,960
That wasn't a jump.

1584
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,140
Little Timmy fell down the well?

1585
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,320
What's this?

1586
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:40,620
Oh.

1587
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:42,880
Why are they doing?

1588
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,480
Why are you clapping?

1589
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,500
This is to warp east.

1590
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:55,710
Ew!

1591
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:58,250
What do you want me to use your words?

1592
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:02,370
Okay.

1593
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,530
Maybe it'll fix itself.

1594
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:12,810
Oh, 75.

1595
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:13,570
Nice.

1596
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,430
Little Timmy fell down the well?

1597
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:21,490
Azul?

1598
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,190
What the game thinks I'm saying.

1599
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:26,150
Ouch.

1600
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,470
This way?

1601
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,110
Oh, we're so...

1602
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:30,790
Wait, this way.

1603
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:32,130
We haven't gone this way.

1604
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:33,310
Oh, shit.

1605
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:34,890
Ziggy potion.

1606
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:48,490
I heard something kind of nasty.

1607
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,210
Oh, it must be up here.

1608
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,990
Just go!

1609
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,230
Go!

1610
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:00,600
Activate it!

1611
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,700
Most approaches.

1612
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:10,820
Woo-woo!

1613
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,100
He's not gonna catch me.

1614
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,680
Oh my god.

1615
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,280
Good!

1616
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,800
It's like, where is little Timmy?

1617
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,320
I couldn't hear you.

1618
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,140
That was pretty good though.

1619
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,820
All things considered, except I think we lost our wands.

1620
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,600
We gotta keep our money.

1621
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,000
We didn't lose all our money.

1622
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:36,480
We did it.

1623
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,680
I got your wand, but I couldn't get to the extraction.

1624
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,220
I'm sorry.

1625
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,580
I couldn't get your wand.

1626
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,360
Wait, there's new wands now.

1627
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,680

I thought I heard Snuffy downstairs, but she was not, that's
weird.

1660
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,440
Oh, no, Snuffy is over here.

Whoa.

1700
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,500
What is this bad?

1701
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,060
I'm happy with my standard wand and just some source of
fire.

1702
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,360
I sold mine.

1703
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,320
Thank you for nothing.

1704
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,980
I want to try the zippy.

1705
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,540

01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,300
Disaster passive income.

1709
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,800
What's the point?

1710
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:49,940
We'll get another one.

1711
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,000
I also did that.

1712
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,720
Look for fire.

1713
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,960
Looking for fire.

1714
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,400
Hymn is done.

1715
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,020
Come on, you got that.

1716
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,540

1717
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:06,740
Arrow.

1718
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,120
What is this?

1719
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,520
A goblin tooth.

1720
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,320
Tempest.

1721
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,600
What do we do with this orb?

1722
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,040
What is whistling?

1723
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,620
What was that?

1724
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,480
Oh.

1725
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,220
Not doing anything.

1726
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,720
Wait, Nimi, are you talking?

1727
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:27,640

1734
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:45,630
What's that?

1735
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:47,610
What's that?

1736
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:48,410
What's that?

1737
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,750
What's that?

1738
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:50,970

1740
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:53,790

Arrow.

1742
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:54,710
Sona.

1743
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,930
Oh, that spell doesn't do damage on items.

1744
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:00,490
Oh, it doesn't.

1745
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:00,970
Aerial.

1746
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,130
Yeah, the kind one doesn't.

1747
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,250
Oh, oh, yeah, it's there.

1748
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,650
I'm just breaking some dice.

1749
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:07,110

01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:20,030
Arrow.

1755
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,050
Tempest.

1756
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:21,690
Oh.

1757
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:23,330
Tempest.

1758
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,130
Just grab it.

1759
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:25,850
Oh.

1760
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,430
Kill him!

01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:45,470
Ouch!

1769
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,590
I'm trying to get the gold, hold on!

1770
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:49,150
We need to get fired.

1771
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:51,310
I thought where's the gold?

1772
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:52,390
I can see it!

1773
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:52,930
Oh, there it is!

1774
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,090
Okay, I got it.

1775
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:55,250
Shit.

1776
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,030

01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:57,490
Run.

1778
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:58,630
He's coming.

1779
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,290
Oh, wait.

1780
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:03,510
I want to drop that.

1781
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,280
I hear another.

1782
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,870
He's aggroed on me.

1783
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:15,410
Oh, no!

1784
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:18,190
Era.

1785
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,870
I'm a wizard and wizard that I've been withed.

1786
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:28,790
I'm hiding.

1787
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:33,980
Why is he gone?

1788
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,300
I don't think I'm actually playing here.

1789
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:48,810
Can he hear me?

1790
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,360
Can he hear me?

1791
01:15:58,660 --> 01:15:58,880
Hello?

1792
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,500
I don't think anything's happening.

1793
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:02,320
Hello?

01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,320
Big guy in the house.

1798
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,320
Big guy pants okay.

1799
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,840
Yeah, he's like aggroed on me.

1800
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:18,900
I can't leave.

1801
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,740
Uh, he aggroed to me for a little bit.

1802
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,840
I don't know where he went after that.

1803
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:24,760
Yeah, he's downstairs.

1804
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,780
There's at the bottom.

1805
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:33,880
Where is Doki to use her spells on this guy?

1806
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,700
Good job.

1807
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,700
Oh my god.

1808
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:44,360
Okay, wait.

1809
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,500
I'm leaving.

1810
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,100
Behind you, Doki.

1811
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:49,640
Run!

1812
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,280

Oh wait, I still can't find a fucking torch.

01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,440
Oh, yeah.

1817
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,280
I just want to set things on fire.

1818
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,160
She wants to set the world.

1819
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,340
Oh, what is that?

1820
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:07,740
What is that?

1821
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,040
Ah!

1822
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,360
What the fuck?

1823
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:13,960
I don't know.

1824
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,160
Run, run, run, run.

1825
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,040
Just run, just run.

comment.

1828
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,340
Oh, Christ.

1829
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,540
There's too many things.

1830
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,700
Everything is here.

1831
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,240
Everything is here.

1832
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,060
I just want to break stuff.

1833
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,640
Holy crap, what was that?

1834
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,800
Did you see that other thing?

1835
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,520
The guy that jumps?

1836
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,120
Yeah.

1837
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,880
What the hell?

1838
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,720
Oh god, I hate the big guy.

1839
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,060
Oh my god, there's two things in here.

1840
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:44,800
Holy shit.

1841
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:45,540
Arrow.

1842
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,800
I feel very defenseless.

1843

Me too.

1844
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,120
Sorry.

1845
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:49,740
That's okay.

1846
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,600
There are places to hide, but it's tough.

1847
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,640
It is.

1848
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:04,960

hit in the back by the big guy and i don't know if she

Nobody is lit.

What?

1856
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,840
What happened to the fire?

1857
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:40,420
Look!

1858
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,360
These guys are invincible.

1859
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,120
Why was I supposed to know he was gonna be behind me?

1860
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,160
I was supposed to know that.

1861
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,780
Oh my god.

1862
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,880
I can only use fire magic in front of me, not behind me.

1863
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,700
Someone didn't cover my back.

1864
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,660
Someone didn't have my back there.

1865
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,780
I didn't have the fire weapon.

1866
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:03,300
Oh my god.

1867
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,580
There's two of them for real.

1868
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:05,900
Oh my god.

01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,140
I didn't even care about it.

1872
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,500
There's a third guy.

1873
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,380
There's a third guy.

1874
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,900
Yeah, upstairs where Snuffy is.

1875
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh my god.

1876
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,540
Lymo has a hundred HP and Snuffy has 13.

1877
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,500
I did not look too good for her.

1878
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:28,720

No!

1889
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,860
Give me one level, please give me one level.

1890
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,520
I don't deserve to be a wizard.

1891
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:34,400
No!

1892
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,500
We're gonna lose so much of money because none of us are in
the extraction.

1893
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,480
Oh my god.

1894
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,620
We have a lot of money.

1895
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,020
We do have a lot of money.

1896
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,020
That's so true.

1897
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,400
Yeah, yeah, we do have one more night.

1898
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,040
One more night.

1899
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,380
We can just make it up for it.

1900
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1901
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,060
Stop peek at your ass off these fucking stairs.

1902
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,220
There's no point in...

1903
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,480
Why do we bring her body?

1904
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:06,560
It's not like...

1905
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,920
Maybe I keep my items.

1906
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:17,420

1910
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,340
I was like...

1911
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,700
Oh, he's still here!

1912
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:46,780
He's still alive!

1913
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:48,340
I don't know why he's here.

1914
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,960
I don't have the wand anymore, but...

1915
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:50,500
Oh, no!

1916
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,040
Take it, take it, take it!

1917
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,820
There's a telekinesis.

1918
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:55,800
Why did you keep...

1919
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,440
Why did you keep the wind wands?

1920
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,800
You know we get free wands here, right?

1921
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,820
I just picked it up because there was something on the
floor.

1922
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,660
Oh, there was nothing else.

1923
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,560
She was really on survivalist.

1924
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,580
Doki, I got you this.

1925
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,560
I got you this because Snuffy killed yours.

1926
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,040
My new frog!

1927
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,780
Oh!

1928
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:20,220
Yeah, I want to try the wand of illusions.

1929
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1930
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,160
Maybe you could turn into a frog.

1931
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,340
Alright, here we go.

1932
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,080
Float Oculus.

1933
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:33,800
Whoa!

1934
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,960
Oh my god, I'm all the way over here!

1935
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:39,460
Whoa!

1936
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,480
Oh, is it like a...

1937
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,960
I'm like, I'm like, I'm having an out-of-body experience.

1938
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,920
It's like your drone.

1939
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,920
Yeah, I'm a drone.

1940
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:48,520
I'm a drone.

1941
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,240
Wait, how do I go?

1942
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,160
How do I stop this?

1943
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:51,980
Go back in.

1944
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,320
Go back in my body.

1945
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,780
Go back in my body.

1946
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,180
Go back in my body.

1947
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,320
Go back in my body.

1948
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,200
Oh, I'm back.

1949
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:02,920
Oh, it's time.

1950
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:03,460
It's time.

1951
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,620
Okay, okay.

1952
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:05,500
Let's see.

1953
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,360
We got...

1954
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,980
Poof me.

1955
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:09,740
Oh!

1956
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,500
Don't break me!

1957
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,020
Do you think one of these will aggro you if you disguise
yourself as a chair?

1958
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,840
Don't sit on me.

1959
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,480
Arrow.

1960
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,760
We have...

1961
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,320
I'm still planning to play musical chairs.

1962
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:28,620
Hello?

1963
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,440
Wait, what happened?

1964
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,020
Oh, there's so many of me!

1965
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,780
What am I doing?

1966
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,580
He's dancing.

1967
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,140
You're the deceptive one now.

1968
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,780
And then there's Shrink Ana.

1969
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,060
Why you get out from under my cloak?

1970
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,940
It changes everyone's voices.

1971
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:10,660
Those are all of them.

1972
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,200
Oh, sorry.

1973
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,800
It changes all of them for me, the voices.

1974
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,940
But that's very cool.

1975
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:16,720
All right.

1976
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,220
Wait, where's Limeo?

1977
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,560
Right here.

1978
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,060
Hey, are we all ready?

1979
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:21,960
Yeah.

1980
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:22,420
I'm ready.

1981
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:23,960
All right.

1982
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:25,780
Let's go.

1983
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,360
I'm extracting.

1984
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:27,900
Oh, wait.

1985
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:28,420
We're shuffie.

1986
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,420
I swear to God.

1987
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,580
She sells our frog again.

1988
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:31,680
I swear to God.

1989
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,580
I swear to God, Stuffy, you sell our passive income again.

1990
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,540
I'm gonna earn some income with my new music career.

1991
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,820
Final night.

1992
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,640
Guys, let's lock in.

1993
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,220
Wizards.

1994
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,620
Let's lock in.

1995
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:49,440
Okay.

1996
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,480
I just lost 5 XP.

1997
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:52,040
Okay.

1998
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:52,880
Who did that?

1999
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,760
Was that me?

2000
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,060
Who did that?

2001
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,340
What's that mean?

2002
01:24:59,600 --> 01:24:59,800
Arrow.

2003
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:01,380
Arrow.

2004
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:02,540
Arrow.

2005
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:03,120
Arrow.

2006
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,760
I'm heading.

2007
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,360
I'm serious.

2008
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,060
Might as well suck, man.

2009
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,320
We have fun.

2010
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,940
Looking for a torch.

2011
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,900
Looking for a torch.

2012
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,760
Surely the game wouldn't cook me again.

2013
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:16,960
Here we go.

2014
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:17,900
Up the stairs.

2015
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:18,580
Here we- Oh.

2016
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,740
Eyeball, guys.

2017
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,280
Shrinkana.

2018
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,900
A little smaller.

2019
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,580
Oh, wait, he's gone.

2020
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:35,700
Oh, okay, cool.

2021
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,280
He was so embarrassed by his small size.

2022
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,040
He left.

2023
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,980
It was above average.

2024
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:42,660
I

2025
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:49,870
messed up size shaming that poor eye.

2026
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:50,470
Oh.

2027
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,030
Oh, he's back.

2028
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:51,390
He's back.

2029
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:52,570
Keep size shaming him.

2030
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,430
No, I don't think I will.

2031
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,190
Wait, who's down here?

2032
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:02,130
Yeah.

2033
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:06,630
Tempest.

2034
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:08,790
Go down.

2035
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:13,030
Wait, where am I?

2036
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:13,330
Wait, where am I?

2037
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:14,310
I gotta figure out where to go.

2038
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,250
Yeah, I can't find like a door.

2039
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,150
Are you freaking drunk?

2040
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:18,870
Hello?

2041
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:20,870
I can like bomb the windows.

2042
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:22,430
Hi.

2043
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:24,590
I go down.

2044
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:25,750
I don't know.

2045
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,550
Where the heck am I?

2046
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,890
Where are the doors?

2047
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:30,470
I can't tell where to go.

2048
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:32,150
Oh no, it's so dark.

2049
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,610
I have no light source.

2050
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:35,290
Yeah, there's like nothing here.

2051
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,770
Oh my god.

2052
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:40,530
I tried to go down, but I can't see shit.

2053
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,150
Are there stairs here?

2054
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:42,950
Or am I crazy?

2055
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:43,810
There's no stairs.

2056
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,190
It's just over here.

2057
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:46,690
No.

2058
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:48,950
There's stuff over here.

2059
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:52,310
The stairs here just goes back to the upstairs.

2060
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:55,750
Oh, we have this area.

2061
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:00,170
I didn't even say anything!

2062
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:02,110
Oh.

2063
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:05,550
Arrow.

2064
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:07,650
Oh, okay.

2065
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:10,430
Wait, that frog looks expensive.

2066
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,270
Oh, shit!

2067
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:15,890
Uh, uh, uh...

2068
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:16,630
Flow talking...

2069
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:16,810
No.

2070
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,450
Dang it!

2071
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,900
Well, he went the other way.

2072
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,440
I can go up these stairs, maybe.

2073
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:01,390
Shrink Ana.

2074
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,520
Shrink Ana.

2075
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:15,480
Oh!

2076
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:16,440
You don't see your ping either.

2077
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,280
There's no ping.

2078
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,400
No, no, no.

2079
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,200
I haven't experienced a program that.

2080
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:20,540
Hello.

2081
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:21,940
What happened?

2082
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
There's a guy downstairs.

2083
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:23,860
Oh!

2084
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,000
Wait, there's a frog!

2085
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:30,380
Don't you dare.

2086
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:36,500
It's a disco.

2087
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,100
Guys, I'm desperate.

2088
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:38,520
Arrow.

2089
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:38,920
I'm scared.

2090
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:39,420
I'm scared.

2091
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:40,880
Arrow.

2092
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:49,560
Arrow.

2093
01:28:58,810 --> 01:28:59,970
Okay, downstairs safe.

2094
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:02,870
Uh, he's going back downstairs!

2095
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,050
There's two downstairs!

2096
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:07,730
Maybe?

2097
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,090
Shrinkana.

2098
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:15,270
And then if I can grab it...

2099
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,570
Yes!

2100
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:20,990
I think we have to go upstairs, I'm pretty sure.

2101
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,970
There's like nothing up here.

2102
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,430
The second?

2103
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:27,130
The third?

2104
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:34,170
Trincona!

2105
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:36,090
Trincona!

2106
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:40,570
Poof me.

2107
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:44,770
Okay, a chair's not gonna help you.

2108
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:47,470
I thought that was the one that makes multiple of me.

2109
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:53,250
I don't think the chair...

2110
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:57,470
Uh, oh, it's on- Alright, I juke them.

2111
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,190
I juke them again.

2112
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:02,530
I can't keep jukeing this!

2113
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,490
I gotta get this though, I gotta get this!

2114
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:05,390
It's so expensive!

2115
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:11,820
Drink Ana.

2116
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:14,960
Oh shit.

2117
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,420
Echo me!

2118
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:17,580
Ow!

2119
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,620
Did I make it?

2120
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:20,520
I don't know.

2121
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:22,700
Jukeed?

2122
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:23,660
But not really.

2123
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:27,500
me.

2124
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,720
I don't know where I am.

2125
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,240
Hello?

2126
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,240
Is there anybody?

2127
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:48,900
Is this a door?

2128
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:53,910
Do I go down?

2129
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:57,840
Hello?

2130
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,900
It's definitely been taken care of.

2131
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,060
Wait, is this where we started?

2132
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,720
Wait, did I go back?

2133
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:07,680
Hola.

2134
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:10,220
The cave?

2135
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,100
The cave?

2136
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,500
I think that's where we started.

2137
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,320
Oh, shoot.

2138
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:29,780
I'm so lost.

2139
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:33,680
Everybody's gone.

2140
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:41,860
Okay.

2141
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:43,240
Oh, hi.

2142
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,680
Oh, there you are.

2143
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,260
Okay, have we gone up yet?

2144
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,220
I don't know.

2145
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:49,860
I'm so- Oh, do not go up!

2146
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,360
Shrink it!

2147
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:50,780
Shrink it!

2148
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:51,580
Shrink it!

2149
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,040
Where is it?

2150
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:53,400
It's gone.

2151
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:54,300
It's gone.

2152
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,260
No, no, it's right here.

2153
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:55,780
It's right here.

2154
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,160
Where?

2155
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:59,380
I think up is extraction.

2156
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,780
You have to shrink it.

2157
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,520
Okay, okay, okay.

2158
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,200
Shrinkana!

2159
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,240
Oh, it didn't work.

2160
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:09,720
It didn't work.

2161
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:10,160
It didn't work.

2162
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:10,760
It didn't work.

2163
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,100
It didn't work.

2164
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:11,620
It didn't work.

2165
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:12,220
I don't think that worked.

2166
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,040
I don't think it didn't work.

2167
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,360
It didn't work.

2168
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:16,740
Watch this.

2169
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,060
Oh my god.

2170
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:19,660
Yeah?

2171
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,980
Oh, we're coming.

2172
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:23,400
We're coming.

2173
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:23,760
We're coming.

2174
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:24,180
We're coming.

2175
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,200
Okay, please come.

2176
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:25,680
Please come.

2177
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,760
I really got...

2178
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,440
I died.

2179
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,000
No!

2180
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:35,060
Wait!

2181
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:35,480
Perfect!

2182
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,360
Okay, wait, perfect.

2183
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,180
Wait, no!

2184
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,540
Snuffy, grab my wand, please!

2185
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,780
It's right there!

2186
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:41,520
That's not true.

2187
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,360
I wouldn't...

2188
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:43,820
No!

2189
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,100
Snuffy!

2190
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:50,960
Wait.

2191
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,300
She can bring me back.

2192
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:55,780
I can't.

2193
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,580
her though.

2194
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,090
I can watch it this time.

2195
01:33:06,570 --> 01:33:07,710
I wish I could hear her though.

2196
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:11,290
Look at my body is floating.

2197
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:15,330
She's playing the drums while she does it.

2198
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:15,850
So funny.

2199
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:24,090
Thank you!

2200
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:26,070
But I can't hear you though, Snuffy.

2201
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:26,970
I can't hear you.

2202
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:29,930
Yeah.

2203
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:35,410
My wand is over here!

2204
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,090
Unless someone grabbed it.

2205
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,310
No.

2206
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:39,010
Okay, good.

2207
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:40,450
Wait, is the other one?

2208
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,710
My basic wand?

2209
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:43,010
My basic wand is...

2210
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:43,790
Oh, here.

2211
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:44,150
Nice.

2212
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:44,470
Okay.

2213
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,330
I'll follow you.

2214
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:54,110
Oops.

2215
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:56,250
I don't know why it does that.

2216
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,590
Sorry.

2217
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:59,130
It's like a...

2218
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,000
What's this one do?

2219
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:11,460
Warp East.

2220
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,100
I think... Let's try it, yeah.

2221
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,620
Unless we're by the spider.

2222
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:22,620
Wait.

2223
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:23,560
No.

2224
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:25,380
I'm coming.

2225
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,080
I think that was a mimic.

2226
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:28,520
Oh!

2227
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:29,980
Oh, we made it!

2228
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,240
What is this?

2229
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,260
Mimi's doing...

2230
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,300
She's doing a...

2231
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,760
She's doing a vocal quiz right now.

2232
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,180
I don't hear anything.

2233
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,140
She's just locked in.

2234
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,360
Oh, I hear...

2235
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:44,720
Oh.

2236
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,080
Oh, okay.

2237
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,440
Where are you?

2238
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,000
Oh, dang.

2239
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,380
I'm below you.

2240
01:34:58,940 --> 01:34:59,800
Oh, you were so close.

2241
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,400
Oh, eyeball.

2242
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:03,660
Trigata.

2243
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:05,840
Oh, shit.

2244
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:06,220
Nice.

2245
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:06,980
Run.

2246
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:07,940
Oh.

2247
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,000
She still attacks.

2248
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,260
I just like to make him small.

2249
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,680
Oh, hi.

2250
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:13,460
Hello.

2251
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:14,520
Oh, shit.

2252
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,180
Um, there's so...

2253
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,200
I thought it was Nimi up there.

2254
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:18,820
What happened to Nimi?

2255
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:19,800
Nimi is there.

2256
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,680
She's doing the time.

2257
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:21,640
Yeah, she was there.

2258
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,280
Yeah, yeah.

2259
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,780
Oh, she's still stuck in the fucking place.

2260
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,680
She's still doing it.

2261
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,260
It's okay.

2262
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,500
We still have a minute.

2263
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:29,880
We have to wait on the exit, I think.

2264
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,700
Otherwise, we're all getting out or getting lost.

2265
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2266
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,040
If she doesn't show up in a minute, we peace out.

2267
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,260
Right, right, right.

2268
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,860
Stuffy is helping her right now.

2269
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:37,820
Is there anything else around?

2270
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,120
I mean, we can watch it here.

2271
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:40,840
Oh, yeah.

2272
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,100
We can watch them, yeah.

2273
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,640
Ooh, ponder the hole.

2274
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,680
Look at her going.

2275
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:49,680
Stuffy is watching.

2276
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,280
Yeah, Sophie is watching.

2277
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,520
She's just standing there.

2278
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,940
If she's watching, and then...

2279
01:35:59,940 --> 01:35:59,960
Ooh.

2280
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:01,560
Oh.

2281
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,620
I don't think they...

2282
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,280
Did she get out?

2283
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,780
That seems like it.

2284
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:10,620
I think that's what happens.

2285
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,060
I think she can at least leave between attempts maybe.

2286
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:13,520
No?

2287
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:14,140
Yes?

2288
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:14,760
Oh.

2289
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:15,920
Oh.

2290
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:16,600
Oh yeah, she's going.

2291
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:16,940
She's coming.

2292
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:17,200
They're coming.

2293
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,460
They're booking it.

2294
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:19,200
They're booking it.

2295
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,200
All right, the moment we see the...

2296
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:21,720
Come here!

2297
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,280
Come here!

2298
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:24,240
Hurry!

2299
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,000
Up here!

2300
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:28,400
Up here!

2301
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,760
We're up here!

2302
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:31,800
Uh-oh.

2303
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,840
I think I have to press it.

2304
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,780
I think I have to press it.

2305
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:34,630
Shrink on a...

2306
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,020
Did I shrink you on accident?

2307
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,780
Two, one!

2308
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,440
Oops, I think I shrunk you guys.

2309
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:40,900
We're here!

2310
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:41,440
We're here!

2311
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:42,560
Wee!

2312
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:42,980
Run!

2313
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:44,720
Run!

2314
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,640
Wait, wait, one, two, three, four!

2315
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:47,480
Wait, there's four of us!

2316
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,060
Where's the fifth?

2317
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,380
Oh, oh, there she is!

2318
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:49,620
Oh!

2319
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,700
Yeah, we...

2320
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,640
I think I accidentally shrunk them.

2321
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:59,680
Yeah, I was like, wait, there's four of us, and I see a tie,
so he's just jumping across.

2322
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,240
Oh, my God!

2323
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,140
We actually made it!

2324
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,100
Big money!

2325
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,200
Yeah, big money.

2326
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,180
Are you so happy?

2327
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:11,480
We are happy.

2328
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,840
Papa Moon, we did it!

2329
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,240
We brought you so much!

2330
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:16,720
We brought you so much money!

2331
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,740
Have we pleased you?

I think so.

2336
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,430
I'm afraid if we...

2337
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:58,750
Have you tried moving forward?

2338
01:37:58,890 --> 01:37:59,690
Are we gonna fall to our death?

2339
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:00,350
No, I'm so scared!

2340
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:02,710
I can see the light.

2341
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:04,730
I can see the light from below us.

2342
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,890
Oh my god.

2343
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:09,950
I see the moon.

2344
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:10,910
It's so beautiful.

2345
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:13,330
Wow.

2346
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:13,590
Wow.

2347
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:13,950
Oh my god.

2348
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:14,030
I see the moon.

2349
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,770
It's so beautiful.

2350
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:16,030
Wow.

2351
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:16,490
Wow.

2352
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:17,470
Well, let me...

2353
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:18,510
I'm gonna do it.

2354
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:19,510
I'm gonna jump.

2355
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:20,050
Oh no.

2356
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:20,670
Ah!

2357
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:22,310
Ah!

2358
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,310
Oh my god, wait, where is everybody?

2359
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:27,570
Oh, they're over here.

2360
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:29,250
Oh, okay, okay, okay, good.

2361
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:32,030
Guys, you won't understand what we just went through.

2362
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:33,770
I couldn't even explain it to you.

2363
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:35,470
No, I watched.

2364
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:40,490
I was there, and I watched, no, like, did you figure out
eventually how to make it move?

2365
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:41,670
Make what?

2366
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:42,790
Or the thing.

2367
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:45,070
Did you figure out how to make the thing move?

2368
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:45,950
What's the thing?

2369
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,090
It was pitch?

2370
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:48,870
It's pitch, but it's confusing, I think.

2371
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:49,650
Oh, no.

2372
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:52,810
It was, yeah, it was like putting the ball in the middle of
the hole.

2373
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:54,510
but it looked really contrived.

2374
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:58,730
We didn't sell some more stuff, and we should be able to

2466
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:41,160
Your sticks and stones may break my bones, but Lyamu's words
will hurt me.

2467
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,140
No, I always do the earth fall down.

2468
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,240
Whoa, look at this.

2469
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:47,020
I'm on the ceiling.

2470
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:48,560
It's the rooftop.

2471
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,260
Is there anything here?

2472
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,240
Ignis Tongue.

2473
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,480
No, there usually isn't.

2474
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,020
Oh, I see the extraction room.

2475
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,300
Ariel.

2476
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:00,700
What's wrong with you?

2477
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,800
Shrink Anna.

2478
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:11,560
I can't understand what you're saying.

2479
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:14,920
That way they were me, right?

2480
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,220
That way they made me speak.

2481
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:18,100
That's what she sounds like.

2482
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:30,940
You know, like those little monkeys had to be cranked in the
little music box.

2483
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:31,900
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2484
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2485
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:38,340
You're the monkey, Dutch.

2486
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,900
I think this is where we came from.

2487
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,920
I think so, too.

2488
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:43,340
Yeah, I think so.

2489
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:44,640
Wait, actually, I'm lost.

2490
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:46,780
We don't, we haven't went through this door.

2491
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,540
Yes, that's where we came from.

2492
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:49,840
That's where we started.

2493
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,140
Yeah, that's where we started.

2494
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:56,980
This way is a new way.

2495
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,380
This over here is new.

2496
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,540
Okay, thank you.

2497
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,940

2498
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:03,400
Yeah.

2499
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,240

01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,800

01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:17,840

It's really tasty!

2567
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:25,400
Oh, the ice here!

What are you guys doing in here?

2575
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:43,100
What is this?

2576
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,260
It's a test of smogs.

2577
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,320
The fuck?

2578
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,560
I don't think it liked whatever you guys did.

2579
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:06,070
Hello?

2580
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,640
Are they okay?

2581
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:11,600
Okay, no, you're good.

2582
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,320
Spawning in and it's staring.

2583
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,360
Are they okay?

2584
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,260
Yeah, they're all good.

2585
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,200
Oh, okay.

2586
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:19,840
I can't hear anybody.

2587
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:24,210
Errol.

2588
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:26,370
I have an eyeball from the melee on my street.

2589
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:27,970
And then we're like, get it out.

2590
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:28,490
Two eyeballs.

2591
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:30,090
I have two eyeballs.

2592
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:31,490
Two eyeballs just chilling.

2593
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:32,450
No, okay, those are dead.

2594
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:33,770
Oh, yeah, there's two eyeballs.

2595
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:36,330
They only hurt when...

2596
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:36,970
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2597
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:38,090
I think it's almost there.

2598
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,270
If you're stamina, is that...

2599
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:43,390
Oh,

2600
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:48,100
we did it.

2601
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,420
We did it!

2602
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:50,500
Yeah!

2603
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:51,600
Go in.

2604
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:52,860
Whoa!

2605
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:54,520
A bunch of wands!

2606
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:58,380
Oh, they were won!

2607
01:48:58,820 --> 01:48:58,820
Yay!

2608
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,060
I don't want me.

2609
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,920
The mimic of you is just on the stairs here.

2610
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:03,200
Ah!

2611
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:03,800
Ah!

2612
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,140
Ah!

2613
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:09,740
You guys all good over here?

2614
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:10,460
Nope.

2615
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:13,540
We did, we did, it really gave us bronze.

2616
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:14,400
Dude, I'm so happy.

2617
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:15,000
Look, Sana.

2618
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,100
Oh, oh!

2619
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:18,960
Ignite Tongue!

2620
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,340
Ignite Tongue!

2621
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:20,800
Ah!

2622
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:22,160
Please, please, I learned it!

2623
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,000
Ignite Tongue!

2624
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:25,480
Ah!

2625
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,560
Get out!

2626
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:28,560
What is that?

2627
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,160
It's a mimic!

2628
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:31,620
It's pretending to be snuffy.

2629
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,760
Oh, it is?

2630
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:33,900
I don't appreciate that.

2631
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:34,840
Yeah.

2632
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:37,060
Oh, I didn't know it could mimic people.

2633
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,820
I have a revive potion if anybody dies.

2634
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,740
And it just screams when it pulses damage.

2635
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:44,560
Is there no way on the other side of that room?

2636
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:47,620
Up there, that's the extraction point over there.

2637
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:48,860
You gotta go over there.

2638
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:49,260
Oh.

2639
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:49,800
That big tower.

2640
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,100
Oh, we get to it, I think.

2641
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:52,900
Up here, up here.

2642
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,360
Where did Doki go?

2643
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:55,740
I don't know.

2644
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:57,080
I think she ran the other way.

2645
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:57,520
Oh, God.

2646
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:00,880
Oh.

2647
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:02,680
Oh, here it is.

2648
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:03,440
It's just right here.

2649
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:04,800
Oh, yeah, we're good.

2650
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:05,080
We're good.

2651
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:05,580
Oh, cool.

2652
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,560
We should, uh, the mimic's still here.

2653
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:07,840
Oh, no.

2654
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:08,840
It's, it's evil me.

2655
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:09,740
It's evil me.

2656
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:10,780
Oh my God.

2657
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,060
Stay away.

2658
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:13,600
Stay away.

2659
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:14,820
Fish.

2660
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,400
Fish.

2661
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,160
Ignis Boom.

2662
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,460
I've got a mine down.

2663
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:18,960
Miss.

2664
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:19,380
Ah!

2665
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,800
Oh, I've been silenced.

2666
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,680
Ignis, boom.

2667
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:27,910
Snuffy talk.

2668
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,330
Okay, we'll hit the mine and we'll be okay.

2669
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,670
Okay.

2670
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:37,070
We still have time.

2671
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:38,030
Should we wait for them?

2672
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,770
We could see.

2673
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:40,030
Let's see if they're alive.

2674
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,590
Let's see.

2675
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:41,210
Let's see where they are.

2676
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:42,030
Let's ponder them.

2677
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:43,030
They're Stokie.

2678
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:44,790
Oh, and they're Nimi.

2679
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:47,330
They're alive, yeah.

2680
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:48,110
We wait, we wait.

2681
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:51,010
Real snuffy?

2682
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:52,230
Real snuffy.

2683
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:53,370
I'm real.

2684
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:56,550
I don't know how to prove myself other than my talking is
bad.

2685
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:57,830
Talking is being an easy way.

2686
01:50:59,110 --> 01:50:59,990
We're pondering.

2687
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:02,490
It's so funny when you look around once you're pondering.

2688
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:11,030
your arms are all up i like what's channeling our ether so
we can manifest the visions of all that i always had i'll go

2689
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:21,190
see it i wonder if we should like go they're like at the
beginning yeah i think doki might have got lost two minutes

2690
01:51:21,190 --> 01:51:29,050
to get all the way over here no problem yeah does anybody
want to be heroic and lead them here i don't think when i

2691
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:35,190
said two minutes a little bit over here no problem i mean it
is impossible for them to get to here in time yeah are they

2692
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:43,530
i'm sorry let me clarify are they really at the beginning or
i saw the third floor which i think was at the beginning oh

2693
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:50,450
no i do have two fancy ones so you definitely i think we all
have a fancy one we can't we can't i was gonna drop it i was

2694
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:59,350
gonna drop them and leave yeah it's the mimic that worries
me true because my health is at 19 i don't think i'll make

2695
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:01,870
it Here, wait, here, here, mint.

2696
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:04,370
There's a health, I have a health potion.

2697
01:52:04,710 --> 01:52:08,030
No, it's okay because- We should probably save it and
extract.

2698
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:08,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2699
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:13,970
But what if something, like, shows up right here and starts
killing us all and she takes one blow and dies?

2700
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:15,190
I think it's a safe room.

2701
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:16,390
I don't feel like they can't get into this room.

2702
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:17,350
Yeah, I think it's a safe room.

2703
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:18,470
Yeah, I've never seen anything in here.

2704
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:21,530
Didn't we run away from a sword guy at the last hour?

2705
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:23,290
Not up here, right?

2706
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,610
I trust you, I trust you.

2707
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:26,210
Luxana.

2708
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,710
Yeah, we are not getting back to them in 55 seconds.

2709
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:31,330
Oh my god, did they find another trap room?

2710
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:32,090
No, they're teleporting.

2711
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:33,750
They're teleport- Oh, they're so far away.

2712
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:35,070
Ooh, I see a teleporter.

2713
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:37,090
Yeah, I don't even know where they are.

2714
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:41,410
No, we teleported, but it was quite long time ago, I'm
pretty sure.

2715
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:42,230
And then...

2716
01:52:44,770 --> 01:52:46,230
If they find the...

2717
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:48,310
What's it called, room?

2718
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:49,270
The...

2719
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:51,510
This puzzle room, then they can get here.

2720
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:54,670
30 seconds.

2721
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:57,190
They definitely got this, man.

2722
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:58,910
Wait.

2723
01:52:58,990 --> 01:52:59,710
Where the fuck are they?

2724
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:01,650
Flow to Oculus.

2725
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:05,830
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

2726
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:09,690
I don't think the other girls have boundaries.

2727
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:11,030

Wait, I don't think I do.

2791
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,220

Wait, that's new.

2813

It's because I'm so used to being dead, you know what I
mean?

2909
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,140
There's a gigantic slime cube.

2910
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:32,100
Oh, what the fuck is that?

2911
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:33,320
There's a gigantic slime cube.

2912
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,220
There's a gigantic slime cube.

2913
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:36,220
There's a gigantic slime cube.

2914
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:37,220
What the fuck is that?

2915
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:38,420
Yeah, the slime cube.

2916
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:39,580
Oh, you found the guy in the basement?

2917
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,640
Yeah, we found the guy in the basement.

2918
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:42,340
The guy in the basement.

2919
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:42,800
Oh my gosh.

2920
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,400
The Jester's here.

2921
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:45,840
Hey.

2922
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,100
Oh, right behind you or right in front of us?

2923
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,520
Oh, I gave him my potion.

2924
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,140
And there's also a giant slime cube.

2925
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,520
They shut the door on him.

2926
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:54,020
Oh, I'm not sure what was going on with that.

2927
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:54,660
Yeah.

2928
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:57,000
He, you could trade with him.

2929
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:57,540
Oh, thanks.

2930
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
You eat your potion?

2931
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,300
He gave me amber.

2932
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:02,500
Amber?

2933
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:04,620
I thought forward was where we came from.

2934
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:05,820
Whoa, cool.

2935
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:07,500
I'm lost.

2936
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:09,580
I already, I'm already messed up.

2937
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:10,800
Guys, I got like a smoothie.

2938
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:11,820
This is the new area.

2939
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,260
With ginger in it.

2940
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:28,440
Trying to, I'm trying to, to adjust more to ginger i don't
like it oh teleport time and i know ginger is so you know oh

2941
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:36,400

try to take care of myself okay okay okay buddy okay wait

2942
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:53,060

What if I, like, work onto this, like...

2943
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:53,380
Oh!

2944
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:54,380
What happened?

2945
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,000
Air.

2946
02:02:55,540 --> 02:03:00,400
I said Gravana, and then I said didn't grab him, and then I
got grabbed.

2947
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:07,500
Yeah, sometimes the spells don't work in our favor.

2948
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:08,740
Did Doki die?

2949
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:11,480
Oh, Doki fucking died the clown got her.

2950
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:13,120
Oh!

2951
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,400
Was it Snuffy Mimic?

2952
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,840
Limeo, are you alive?

2953
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:25,860
I thought you got abducted.

2954
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:33,240
Oh, he knew you thought you got abducted!

2955
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,220
Because things just don't...

2956
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:48,200
Okay, the fact that the gesture is a one shot is pretty
fucked up.

2957
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:48,680
I know!

2958
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,540
I've been messed up.

2959
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,560
You were like our test subject, too.

2960
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:57,140
You were like, we're like, oh, wonder what happens if you
can't grab.

2961
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:58,500
I got grabbed.

2962
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,400
That's what happened.

2963
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:03,440
It was fun.

2964
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:04,200
It was a good time.

2965
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:09,440
I think maybe I wasted money on that shitty-ass grab-bana
one.

2966
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:14,740
You were only grabbing us and grabbing nothing else.

2967
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:15,840
Oh.

2968
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,300
Snuffy.

2969
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:20,520
Snuffy.

2970
02:04:21,260 --> 02:04:21,620
Snuffy.

2971
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,280
Oh, she gamed.

2972
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,400
Where did Snuffy go?

2973
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:26,740
Was she by herself?

2974
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:28,360
Yeah, she's by herself.

2975
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:29,360
She's getting...

2976
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:30,820
You're moving all the furniture and stuff.

2977
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,900
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2978
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,080
Oh my god, the jukes of the century.

2979
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:39,140
Oh, she's gaming.

2980
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,160
She doesn't know they can open doors.

2981
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,660
Oh, she made it back with them.

2982
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:45,220
Oh, that's...

2983
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:46,800
Wait, that's not Nimi, is it?

2984
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:48,800
That's... that's not...

2985
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:49,280
That's Nimi.

2986
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:50,260
That's not Nimi.

2987
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:51,100
That's not Nimi.

2988
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:54,680
She's like, Nimi!

2989
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:59,420
Why are you looking at it?

2990
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,520

Also, if we don't make it, we can see what the death
animation is like.

3028
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:07,180
Everybody grab your new wand.

3029
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:09,060
It must be interesting.

3030
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:10,140
LG, LG.

3031
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,380

This level is crazy.

3042
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:29,740
It's tough.

3043
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,860
I'm selling stuff.

3044
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:32,460
The bard.

3045
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,680
I'm not a grotesque one.

3046
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:39,440

3054
02:08:59,530 --> 02:08:59,690
Oh!

3055
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:02,050
He gave us an extra...

3056
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:03,270
Grab the frogs.

3057
02:09:03,410 --> 02:09:04,130
They'll give you more money.

3058
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:06,350
Oh, they like it.

3072
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,880
Little lamb.

3075
02:09:55,550 --> 02:09:58,290
Storm tower beneath the mountain.

3076
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:00,190
I almost forgot to bring my wand.

3077
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:00,850
Arrow.

3078
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:03,730
Does anybody have an extra wand?

3079
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:05,010
I forgot mine.

3080
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:06,690
You forgot a door!

3081
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:08,630
We're leaving that mine.

3082
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:11,270
Oh, I have a wind wand here.

3083
02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:12,350
Oh, I got one.

3084
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:13,250
I got a wind wand.

3085
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:14,350
Somebody gave it to me.

3086
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:14,810
I took one.

3087
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:15,410
Wait, wait.

3088
02:10:15,690 --> 02:10:16,350

3090
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:18,490
Oh, thank you.

3091
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:20,030
Oh, good, good, good.

3094
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:24,250
Arrow.

3095
02:10:26,190 --> 02:10:26,590
Arrow.

3096
02:10:28,250 --> 02:10:30,410
Wait, what do the containers look like, guys?

3097
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:31,370

3109
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:44,990
Do we break it?

3110
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:45,710
Do we get gold?

3111
02:10:46,530 --> 02:10:47,330
Wait, hold on.

3112
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:48,770

3113
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:48,790

3115
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:51,930
Oh, I increased the value of my piss!

3116
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:53,450
What is this?

3117
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:54,470
I was going!

3118
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:55,470
Will you get more money?

3119
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:57,630
Okay, I'll try to remember not to break those then.

3120
02:10:57,910 --> 02:10:58,850
Oh my god.

3121
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:01,090
I didn't think it...

3122
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:01,470
Oh my...

3123
02:11:01,470 --> 02:11:02,210
It turned gold.

3124
02:11:02,350 --> 02:11:04,090
Just like getting over it.

3125
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:06,890
Is that what's happening to the pot?

3126
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:07,910
Piss, yeah.

3127
02:11:11,310 --> 02:11:12,910

Oh, well, it's just not.

3130
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:16,550
Oh, okay, and it doesn't work.

3131
02:11:17,010 --> 02:11:17,270
Wait.

3132
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:19,170
There was a gold there.

3133
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:19,550
Arrow.

3134
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:21,970

3135
02:11:21,970 --> 02:11:22,570
Oh, there it is.

3136
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:24,170

3138
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:31,340
I don't trust myself.

3139
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:35,700
I don't trust myself alone.

02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:36,940

She's still healthy.

3199
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:39,550
Yeah.

3200
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:40,630
There's an eyeball?

3201
02:13:40,630 --> 02:13:40,910
There's an eyeball?

3202
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:43,610
Stay underneath them.

3203
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:44,090
Stay underneath them.

3204
02:13:44,690 --> 02:13:46,690
Ah, never mind, don't say underneath him.

3205
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:48,190
It's a fish, it's a fish, it's a fish now.

3206
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:53,380
Yeah, yeah, she is.

3207
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:54,360
Oh, there's a guy behind us.

3208
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:55,540
Oh, I can't hear her.

3209
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,220
Oh, no!

3210
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:59,160
Okay, I can turn her into a fish and then it'll reset it.

3211
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:00,500
Does that work?

3212
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,020
Fish me.

3213
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:01,520

Hi.

3217
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:06,800
I sneeze at her too.

3218
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:08,760
Wait, this is really expensive.

3219
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,760
This thing...

3220
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:11,420
Wait, which one?

3221
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:11,680
Oh.

02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:12,640
This big statue.

3223
02:14:13,060 --> 02:14:16,380
I would shrink it before and I would break it.

3224
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:18,020
Piss, yuck.

3225
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,840
What if I pee on it?

3226
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,500
Oh, if I pee on it, I desecrate it.

3227
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:23,000
Either.

3228
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:24,280
Okay, let's just keep going.

3233
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:31,440
It's okay.

3234
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:33,120

Up.

3395
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:17,270

Don't be under the instruction.

02:21:39,870 --> 02:21:41,310
Wait, this is kind of fun.

3409
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:44,030
On our last game, we get to see what happens.

3410
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:44,790
Yay!

3411
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:48,170
We sandbagged on purpose.

3412
02:21:48,210 --> 02:21:49,150
Yeah, we did it on purpose.

3413
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:51,010
Yeah, obviously.

3414
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:53,670
You can't tell us how to live our lives.

3415
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:55,390
Up dog!

3416
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:57,230

3417
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:58,310
Dog!

3418
02:21:59,090 --> 02:21:59,330
Dog!

3419
02:21:59,670 --> 02:21:59,690
Dog!

3420
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:02,350
Oh no!

3421
02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:04,570
I think he squashed us.

3422
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:06,430
You know that's a book.

3423
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:07,670
Precious you.

3424
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:08,270
Yeah.

3425
02:22:14,370 --> 02:22:17,310
I heard something wailing in the woods.

3426
02:22:17,350 --> 02:22:18,710
Oh, I can't hear you.

3427
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:21,470
Oh, I can hear you.

3428
02:22:21,490 --> 02:22:21,730
I can hear you.

3429
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:23,210
Hello?

3430
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:26,190
Well, I'm blue.

3431
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:26,950
Hi!

3432
02:22:29,170 --> 02:22:30,750
We lost all our frogs!

3433
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,010
No!

3434
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:33,750
I have one right here.

3435
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:35,310
Oh, yay!

3436
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:35,830
Good!

3437
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:38,730
Yeah, I think this is like we're set to Zira basically.

3438
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:39,990
Yeah, we did a good job.

3439
02:22:40,910 --> 02:22:42,130
That was fun though!

3440
02:22:42,350 --> 02:22:43,050
That was pretty fun.

3441
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:46,490
It's crazy though that he didn't have Fire Spit!

3442
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:50,490
That's kind of cool though.

3443
02:22:50,730 --> 02:22:53,930
He has a Fire Spit but it ain't the same as Fire Ball, you

Mr. Beast!

3454
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:16,810
Live is not having any of this.

3455
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:17,870
Wow!

3456
02:23:18,370 --> 02:23:19,850

Oh, my God.

3497
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:18,130
Dance lessons are paying off, guys.

3498
02:25:18,190 --> 02:25:19,810
That's my finale move, my finishing.

3499
02:25:20,050 --> 02:25:21,830
Oh, I just got stuck in the ground.

3500

Oh.

3511
02:25:38,470 --> 02:25:41,190
Wow, that was so silly.

3512
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:45,630
It's really fun when the game doesn't recognize your boys.

3513
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:50,910
But it was very silly, very silly time.

3514
02:25:53,150 --> 02:26:01,630
Thank you guys for yapping with us tonight, and yeah, I like
my hat.

3515
02:26:05,310 --> 02:26:06,970
Actually underneath it.

3516
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:11,510
You would have never known.

3517
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:14,330
You would have never known.

3518
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:20,710
Is it my triangle?

3519
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:24,090
No way!

3520
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:28,350
She was a ghost the whole time.

3521
02:26:29,470 --> 02:26:36,110
These games I never feel like i'm good at them but they're

3525
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:06,990
My favorite part is when you say a spell and it's not
midway, but it still activates.

3526
02:27:07,530 --> 02:27:07,970
I know.

3527

for me to see mid stream or acknowledge mid stream, but I
