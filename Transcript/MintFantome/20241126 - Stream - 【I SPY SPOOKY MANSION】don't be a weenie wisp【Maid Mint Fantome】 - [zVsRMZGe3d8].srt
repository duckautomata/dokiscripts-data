1
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,510
Click on the spider to enter the game.

2
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,680
Enter the game.

3
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,900
Oh my gosh.

4
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,680
Yes,

5
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,920
we are in glasses mode today.

6
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
Because we are having to see with our...

7
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,160
Eyes!

8
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,380
I didn't mean the dramatic pause there, sorry.

9
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,280
I was...

10
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,120
I was checking something on my mic.

11
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,920
Hello!

12
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,340
Hello, hello, welcome in.

13
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm quiet?

14
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm quiet?

15
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,360
Am I actually?

16
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,500
Audio is good?

17
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,180
One guide?

18
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,120
Oh, ok.

19
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,720
What the heck?

20
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
Why did you say that?

21
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,100
This game might be too spooky for me.

22
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,200
Look at the freaky ghost at the bottom right.

23
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,280
Is my interface ok?

24
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,100
I don't know.

25
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,680
I think so.

26
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
I was worried because...

27
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Actually, I thought I sounded quiet because I was like...

28
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,940
Earlier, but...

29
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah.

30
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,640
I got good news from my doctors at Duke University.

31
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,400
Wait, really?

32
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,380
Is that real?

33
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,980
Nerve blockers will help the chronic pain.

34
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,560
Let's go!

35
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
Oh my gosh, let's go Brandon!

36
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,120
I hope it all works out.

37
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,380
Good luck, good luck.

38
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,380
One thing I want to say before I begin begin...

39
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,280
So,

40
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,880
I had a lot of trouble getting this game to work in OBS.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,840
It scared me.

42
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,620
Ok, hold on.

43
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,400
Gosh.

44
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,280
And enter your name.

45
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,560
I had a lot of trouble getting this to work.

46
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,180
It's so funny because...

47
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,820
Basically, the one place you can play this is this service called Big Fish Games or whatever.

48
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,420
So I bought it from there.

49
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,840
I tested it earlier and I was like, oh, cool.

50
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,400
It works.

51
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,900
We're all good.

52
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,280
And then, an hour before stream, I tried to set everything up in OBS and everything.

53
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,840
And the game would not capture for whatever reason.

54
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,740
I was like, oh no, what's happening?

55
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,180
So I troubleshooted for like an hour.

56
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,600
I looked even online and there's like an old Reddit post from like three years ago.

57
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,300
That's like, hi, I'm trying to stream I Spy Spooky Mansion from Big Fish Games, but it's not window capturing.

58
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
What do I do?

59
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,060
So they were literally me.

60
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,540
Window capture did not work for everybody curious.

61
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,020
It was not window capture.

62
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:42,740
So that's why I am telling you guys I am doing the thing you are not supposed to do as a VTuber.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,020
And I am desktop capturing.

64
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:57,100
If I accidentally click onto... And if I click out of the game, it goes black screen.

65
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,260
So sorry if I miss like something.

66
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,060
I can't click out of the game.

67
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,380
And if I accidentally click out or accidentally show my desktop, I already checked.

68
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,600
There's nothing bad.

69
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,680
I exited out of anything that would be spoilers.

70
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,240
So yeah, nothing.

71
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,220
We're all good.

72
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,440
Hide the bookmark bar.

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,820
I don't even have anything bad in my bookmarks.

74
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,620
I feel it's just like here's backgrounds that VTubers can use.

75
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:53,940
I feel that if my desktop were to be leaked, it would be so disappointed by how boring it truly is.

76
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,200
So don't worry about it.

77
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,580
Mint can't see this.

78
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,180
Yes I can.

79
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,640
I am just saying if I have to like scroll.

80
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,580
You know, say someone said something in chat.

81
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,120
I missed it.

82
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,180
It might be difficult.

83
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Or if I have to adjust something.

84
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,920
Hopefully I am not too big.

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
You know what, I am going to put my arms down.

86
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,120
Just so we can have more of the screen for you guys to see as well.

87
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,080
My wallpaper is not snake right now.

88
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,500
Oh my gosh you guys.

89
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,300
Actually my wallpapers...

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
I have one blue archive wallpaper and one like Mt.

91
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,860
Fuji wallpaper.

92
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,260
Okay?

93
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,400
Gosh.

94
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,940
It's like... I told you.

95
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,660
It's like so normal.

96
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,120
Okay?

97
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,560
It's like so normal.

98
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,240
It's because my whole desktop area is very aesthetic.

99
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Okay?

100
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,160
And Metal Gear does not fit in my aesthetics.

101
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,240
Thanks for the 5k third.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,340
A spy and Minty ghost made.

103
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,060
But yeah, I have this earlier.

104
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,240
Oh no, no, no.

105
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,240
Minto.

106
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,680
Oh you can see my cat.

107
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,480
Oh gosh.

108
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:09,920
Desktop.

109
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,020
I feel so exposed right now with the desktop audio.

110
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Or audio.

111
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,820
Desktop capture.

112
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,240
I feel really scared right now.

113
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,700
This is... Every time I turn caps lock on, it does this.

114
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,760
And you can only turn it off.

115
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,580
You can't lower the opacity.

116
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,400
You see this?

117
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,560
Like, it's completely opaque.

118
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,780
Like, this is so annoying.

119
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,500
I hate this.

120
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,940
It comes with the Logitech... Whatever, whatever.

121
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,100
Minto looks extra cute today.

122
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah, it's a Logitech thing.

123
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,640
I wish you could at least, like, make it.

124
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,960
Because sometimes I'll be typing something and I accidentally...

125
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,160
Or like, I'll be doing something and I accidentally hit caps lock.

126
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:59,280
And you can turn it off, but I can't see the caps lock light on.

127
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm too short, so...

128
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,160
I have to... This helps me know if it's on or off or not.

129
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,980
I can't see it on my keyboard.

130
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,740
The little light.

131
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,960
It's hidden by the keys.

132
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,960
I have to, like...

133
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,380
I have to, like, extend myself.

134
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,260
So...

135
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,540
I stopped using Logitech and mine still shows that?

136
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
Oh, that's the worst.

137
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,940
My chair is as high as it goes, so...

138
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,460
Anyway...

139
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,400
Anyway, I wonder if maybe I could lower my desk.

140
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,710
No, I still can't see it.

141
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,330
OK.

142
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,090
Are you guys ready to go into the game?

143
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,150
Let me turn down the audio just a little.

144
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,790
Hold on, I didn't have time to adjust it.

145
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,050
That should be good.

146
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,370
Let's go!

147
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,230
Minto!

148
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,350
No!

149
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,190
No!

150
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,290
Let me restart!

151
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,820
No, you guys have to see the beginning!

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,480
Hold on.

153
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,740
Oh, shoot!

154
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,580
OK.

155
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,220
I turned off... Oh, I only clicked out of the game.

156
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,780
OK, I'm gonna exit out of the game real quick.

157
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,640
Yes.

158
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,340
We have to start over again.

159
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,560
We have to make a new save.

160
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,560
It's fine.

161
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,400
OK, once it starts up...

162
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,060
Display...

163
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,800
Here.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,200
OK.

165
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,640
Oh, wait.

166
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,520
Hold on.

167
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,980
Display...

168
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,860
This...

169
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,240
No!

170
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,080
Oh, shoot!

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,180
Hold on.

172
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,260
No!

173
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,320
Oh, no!

174
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,660
Oh, no!

175
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,600
Oh, no!

176
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,040
Give me a second!

177
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,840
I have to restart!

178
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,930
Click on the spider to enter the game.

179
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,130
If you saw...

180
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,410
No!

181
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,970
I can't see the YouTube now!

182
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,410
Oh my gosh, this is a disaster.

183
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,350
No!

184
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,630
I hate this!

185
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,550
No!

186
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,770
I can't get it so that I can see...

187
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,870
OK, I'm gonna have to put it like...

188
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,550
No!

189
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,840
OK.

190
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
I fixed it, I think.

191
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,180
Oh my god.

192
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,380
Sorry, it's all happening behind the scenes.

193
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,380
So basically...

194
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,520
Essentially...

195
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,120
If I click...

196
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,640
If I click on YouTube...

197
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,380
To be able to read the chat...

198
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,380
You guys would see...

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,700
My...

200
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,480
My...

201
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,280
My screen.

202
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,560
You would see my window.

203
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,120
Not that there's anything bad.

204
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,800
But I don't wanna be exposed!

205
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,230
And so I couldn't read it.

206
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,530
Because OBS was covering it.

207
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,890
Because I usually have the chat overlapping on top of OBS.

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:57,630
But I couldn't switch screens because I had to turn on the desktop capture.

209
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,190
Anyway, we're fine.

210
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,170
We need to commission Minto a technical difficulty screen.

211
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,510
No!

212
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,430
That's not even...

213
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,030
That wouldn't even have helped!

214
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,470
That wouldn't even have helped.

215
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,210
Because I had to have done everything before stream.

216
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,850
Ok, whatever.

217
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,470
Minto...

218
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,470
Binto...

219
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,790
No.

220
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,710
What should we do?

221
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,310
What name should we do?

222
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,650
Minky!

223
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,430
Minky...

224
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,670
So true.

225
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,570
See?

226
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,250
Minky...

227
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,860
This is the part that you had to see.

228
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,760
It's very important.

229
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,200
That's him talking I think.

230
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,080
Yay!

231
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,300
We made it inside.

232
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,780
The way you came in.

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,480
There's a puzzle for you.

234
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,840
Wait one second.

235
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,080
Hold on.

236
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,100
Ok.

237
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,620
So here...

238
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,740
We have to go find the puzzle pieces.

239
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,540
This puzzle is a secret message which tells you how to get out of the house.

240
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,300
But the pieces aren't here yet.

241
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:05,320
To earn puzzle pieces you have to go solve the I Spy riddles and play the games that I've hidden in this house.

242
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,620
Then come back here and put your pieces in place.

243
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,900
Pieces in place.

244
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,540
Wait.

245
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,840
Come back here and put your pieces in place.

246
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm stupid.

247
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Why did you say that?

248
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,500
Wait.

249
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,460
Why did you say that?

250
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
And she's like...

251
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,080
Dummy, dumb, dum-dum.

252
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,400
That's exactly what I told you.

253
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,020
Let's go do some puzzles!

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,040
Where do we want to go?

255
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,980
We can go in here.

256
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,760
It's a little blocked.

257
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,840
Hopefully I'm not blocking too much of it.

258
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,100
Check the umbrella rack.

259
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,400
I don't think there is anything in there.

260
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,040
There is nothing there.

261
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,920
I grew up with these games.

262
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,360
Look at the rat!

263
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,160
And the cat!

264
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
And the bat!

265
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,800
Let's...

266
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,600
Let's go to this room first.

267
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,080
Moose.

268
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,580
Four!

269
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,940
There is a number four here.

270
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,420
Let's do the fireplace.

271
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh my god guys.

272
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,580
Four!

273
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,220
Spooky.

274
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,000
F

275
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,160
A dangling spider and an old clipper ship.

276
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,160
That's not a riddle.

277
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,540
F Ok, wait.

278
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,820
So...

279
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,260
I wonder how fast we can speedrun this you guys.

280
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,980
F I An F in a frame.

281
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,680
Oh yeah.

282
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,620
An I.

283
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,430
I forgot they all do this.

284
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,850
Ok, speedrun.

285
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,470
A match.

286
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,750
One match.

287
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,950
One match.

288
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,050
Two matches.

289
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,050
Two!

290
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,030
Just looked it.

291
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,610
The VA did a bunch of Pokemon voices.

292
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,430
No way.

293
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,630
A candle flame.

294
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,250
I remember this being like...

295
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,050
Ok, this must be the first...

296
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,770
A dangling spider.

297
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,130
I remember this being so much more difficult when I was a kid.

298
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,010
I was like, oh guys, we're going to be going for like some crazy I Spy adventures.

299
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,430
You know, like we're going to be...

300
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,430
Look at this paperclip.

301
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,730
It's ginormous.

302
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,590
These get more difficult, right?

303
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,670
A paperclip.

304
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,490
What's a clipper ship?

305
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:10,890
This?

306
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,050
An old clipper ship.

307
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,030
Oh my gosh.

308
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,150
What does it mean by trunk?

309
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,570
Like this?

310
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,830
A trunk.

311
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,350
Ok.

312
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,470
Let's see.

313
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,830
We need a one duck.

314
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,050
One duck.

315
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,130
These sound effects are killing me.

316
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,790
Where is the second duck?

317
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,110
Where are the other ducks?

318
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,970
Why are they hidden?

319
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,750
Did the number mean anything?

320
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,090
Nothing?

321
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,130
Not at all?

322
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:44,990
Realistic duck.

323
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,850
Oh you're so right.

324
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,650
We need a bone.

325
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,310
Oh I see the bone.

326
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,750
A bone.

327
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,650
I got a bone to pick with you.

328
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,470
Oh I see the duck.

329
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,840
Three ducks.

330
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,430
Oh my God!

331
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,850
Thank you.

332
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,490
I was going to take it but sure, whatever.

333
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,390
We did it guys.

334
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,430
We're so good at this one.

335
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:35,750
Wait.

336
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,030
We were so good at this one.

337
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,750
Good job everybody.

338
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,290
We're going to speed run this for real.

339
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,490
Mystery bins.

340
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,890
Watch for the hint and figure out how these objects match.

341
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,170
Then empty the bins by clicking on the matching pairs.

342
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,530
Be careful.

343
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,230
Here's your hint.

344
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,910
Oh.

345
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:16,250
I love being smarter than a first or fifth grader.

346
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,690
Oh my gosh!

347
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,730
It's the best time!

348
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,490
Oh shoot.

349
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,950
Oh my gosh!

350
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,190
It's timed you guys.

351
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,310
It's timed.

352
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,410
What the hell?

353
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:51,570
Oh my God!

354
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,330
New record!

355
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,250
I'm so good at this.

356
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,630
You guys, we might be speed running this game.

357
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,590
Stop!

358
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,710
Wait, what?

359
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,350
What do these have in common?

360
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,610
What do these have in common?

361
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,350
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,570
Why are you sorry Barry?

363
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,770
What did you do?

364
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,450
What did you do?

365
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,170
Oh it's color.

366
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,330
I see it.

367
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,730
Oh my God.

368
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,110
No!

369
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,330
The game is throwing me!

370
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,650
Hey, we had this one before.

371
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,730
That's like totally cheating.

372
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,870
My brain worked too fast!

373
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,770
No!

374
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:52,570
OK.

375
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,490
Redemption.

376
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,290
Redemption.

377
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,410
Two seconds!

378
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,230
A new record.

379
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,610
I don't think anybody can get faster than that.

380
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,570
I don't think anybody can get faster than that.

381
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,290
Right?

382
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,050
OK.

383
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:07,850
Oh my gosh.

384
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,150
This one is so difficult.

385
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,050
They are so far away.

386
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,350
They are too far.

387
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,970
I don't think I can do it.

388
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,490
I don't think I can do it.

389
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,250
What if we had a touch screen?

390
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,030
If only.

391
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,830
Oh shoot!

392
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,190
This one wasn't meant to be.

393
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,010
This one wasn't meant to be.

394
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,450
Oh!

395
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,830
This one is so good!

396
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,270
OK.

397
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,070
I think one of Featman69's ancestors possessed me.

398
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,830
It will happen again.

399
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,690
No!

400
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,310
That one was so good though!

401
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:53,330
Almost!

402
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,330
You guys, I don't know if you can get any faster.

403
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,390
I don't know if you can get any faster than two seconds.

404
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,150
It's tough to get a one second record.

405
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,750
I want to put myself on the board.

406
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,950
The game is kind of loud.

407
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,170
What else do you guys think?

408
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,790
A little loud?

409
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,230
I think the music might be a little loud.

410
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,410
Like when it goes boop, boop, boop.

411
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,390
This house is bizarre.

412
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,610
Hi Minky!

413
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,990
K!

414
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,170
Happy birthday!

415
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,970
Happy birthday to you.

416
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,750
Happy birthday to you.

417
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,750
Happy birthday dear KV.

418
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,570
Happy birthday to you.

419
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,470
Happy birthday!

420
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,530
Alright, let's do more finder seeds.

421
00:24:42,530 --> 00:25:00,330
I spy a wishbone, a pinecone, howl, a space for a tooth, a moon, an owl, a face in the sky, a duck safety pin, a fly, a frog, and a face with a grin.

422
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,970
Wait, can I press him?

423
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,050
Pressing skeleman doesn't do anything.

424
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,570
So sad.

425
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,930
OK.

426
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,950
Wait, there is hints even.

427
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,370
We don't need hints.

428
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,850
We are too good for this game.

429
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,790
Look there is another 4 here.

430
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,830
What is this 4?

431
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,310
Duck safety pin.

432
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,430
Wishbone.

433
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,630
Is this a wishbone?

434
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,270
No, this is a horseshoe.

435
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,230
This is a wishbone.

436
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,590
A wishbone.

437
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,390
I see it!

438
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,150
Howl!

439
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,230
Howl!

440
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,770
Why did he say it like that?

441
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,190
OK, that one was way loud.

442
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,710
A pinecone.

443
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,450
Pinecone.

444
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:51,930
Pinecone!

445
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,550
A pinecone.

446
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,810
A pinecone on the window.

447
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,470
I see it.

448
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,350
I got it!

449
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,270
I got it!

450
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,330
A space for a tooth.

451
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,770
I'm blocking this one a little bit.

452
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,890
A space for a tooth.

453
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,990
A half moon.

454
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,350
This one?

455
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,630
It's more like a... That's not a half moon.

456
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,010
That's like a crescent moon.

457
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,610
Why are there so many ducks?

458
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,050
I don't know.

459
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,490
They are obsessed with you, ducky.

460
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,590
That's definitely a crescent moon.

461
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,010
This game is not good for the children.

462
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,350
An owl.

463
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,130
Look at the heart on the little frog.

464
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,230
That's so cute.

465
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,630
A frog.

466
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,730
A frog.

467
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:35,630
A fly.

468
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,110
This is the biggest fly ever.

469
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,930
If this thing were in my room...

470
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,630
Oh my god!

471
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,610
This bat is out to kill.

472
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,270
Holy moly!

473
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:43,890
Oh there's the owl.

474
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,830
An owl.

475
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,010
Why do all the other animals get their...

476
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,550
All the other animals get their own sounds, but the owl is doing a little jig.

477
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,220
Why?

478
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,700
Ew!

479
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,800
The face in the sky is disturbing!

480
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,160
The name Spooky Mansion is living up to its name.

481
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,140
You guys, I didn't own any other iSpy games.

482
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,760
I only cared about this one because it's a spooky mansion when I was a kid.

483
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,180
Just like I mentioned it in Prey Chat when I was trying to solve the OBS issues.

484
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,420
But my other idea for tonight was Freddy Fish 2 The Haunted Schoolhouse.

485
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,940
Because that also was the only Freddy Fish game that I had when I was a kid.

486
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,060
Because it was a haunted schoolhouse.

487
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,600
So I never cared about anything that wasn't having to do with spooky and scary, even as a kid.

488
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,640
Kinoko!

489
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,040
Welcome to membership!

490
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,640
Arigato!

491
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,960
Thank you, thank you.

492
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,120
I have always been obsessed with the spooky and the scary.

493
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,420
Oh!

494
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,380
We just killed that thing.

495
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,500
A face with a grin?

496
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,560
A face with a grin?

497
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,640
A face with a grin?

498
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,140
This guy?

499
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,500
We got him!

500
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,640
I've always been a ghost, you guys.

501
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,020
Well, I mean...

502
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,120
Sorry, you can't see him, but little skelly man is on the right.

503
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,520
I am good at this game.

504
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,020
Thank you!

505
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
Yeah, I've been dead since I've been dead.

506
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,760
So ever since I was... Ever since I died I've always loved spooky, you know?

507
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,760
Let's go into this creepy...

508
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,380
Ghost!

509
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,520
It's like a ghost.

510
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,120
What a warning sign.

511
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,240
Look at him.

512
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,640
He's so official.

513
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,380
He's ready for official I spy scientific business.

514
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,740
Ghost in bottom right.

515
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,180
Two hooks.

516
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,900
Two hooks.

517
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,720
Two hooks.

518
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,360
What do they classify it with?

519
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,400
Two hooks.

520
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,180
Is this a hook?

521
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,680
No.

522
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,600
Two hooks.

523
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,620
You see them?

524
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,260
The hooks.

525
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,260
Oh there is one.

526
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,760
Oh there is two.

527
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,340
I see them.

528
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,280
Two hooks.

529
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,500
A ghost.

530
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,140
I'm trying to click on me, but it's not working.

531
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm too fast.

532
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,280
You can't.

533
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,160
You can't click on me.

534
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm too fast.

535
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,520
You can't click on me.

536
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,620
You can't click on me.

537
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,460
I'm too fast.

538
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm too fast.

539
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,180
Yeah baby!

540
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,580
You can't click on me!

541
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,380
I'm dizzy now.

542
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,100
OK, let's pick a ghost.

543
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,820
Number...we can't pick the spookiest number.

544
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,500
They don't allow...

545
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,330
Six numbers in line.

546
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,710
Oh we have to do that.

547
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,410
OK number four.

548
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,830
Six numbers in line.

549
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,310
No, no.

550
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,450
I'm picking the ghost.

551
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,030
Six numbers in line.

552
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,730
I hate this game.

553
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,330
I don't even know that was a thing.

554
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,250
Look there is a foot in the wall.

555
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,010
A bug in a jar.

556
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,470
A bug in a jar.

557
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,010
What is the bug made out of?

558
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,690
What the hell?

559
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,500
Why did it make such a horrible sound?

560
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,740
One goggle.

561
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,860
One pair of goggles.

562
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,220
Two pairs of goggles.

563
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,920
Two pairs of goggles.

564
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,300
Never again please.

565
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,780
I hope not.

566
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,500
This is hot.

567
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,760
I'm blocking it with my head.

568
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,240
A warning sign.

569
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,860
A warning sign.

570
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,280
I'm a first time viewer.

571
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,360
First time chatter.

572
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,400
Sorry to intrude but can you please tell my son Cory to get back to his studies.

573
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,920
Cory!

574
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
Cory, Cory, Cory.

575
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,480
What the heck are you doing?

576
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,860
Stop watching Vtubers and get back to your studies Cory!

577
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,500
You've been busted.

578
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,460
Busted by the ghost which I usually am getting busted instead.

579
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,120
Cory get back to your studies.

580
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,280
Get out of here Cory.

581
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,760
Cory leave.

582
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,360
Leave this place.

583
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,460
A bone that's stone.

584
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,960
I love all these sound effects.

585
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,260
Why can't I pick the ghost?

586
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,360
So sad.

587
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,580
Wooden handle...

588
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,540
Oh this one.

589
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,940
A star.

590
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,900
A star.

591
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,560
A star.

592
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,960
Oh here.

593
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
It's behind chat.

594
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,980
A star.

595
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,480
How do I pick the ghost?

596
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:36,860
Is this?

597
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,160
Ghost.

598
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,700
Ghost.

599
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,180
What's going on?

600
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,760
Hey...

601
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,600
Sorry to intrude but can you tell my dad Albert to mind his own business.

602
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,840
Albert!

603
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,340
Albert, Albert, Albert.

604
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,620
Mr. Albert, mind your own beeswax.

605
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,280
Your son, he's doing his best.

606
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,020
You know what?

607
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,320
He needs time to relax and watch VTubers in between his studies.

608
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,860
He needs time to be a kid.

609
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Okay?

610
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,900
But out Albert.

611
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Leave Cory to his business.

612
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,800
Thank you.

613
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,580
We're causing a family rift here.

614
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,520
On stream.

615
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,240
Let's do this one.

616
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,920
We'll just like conquer the fold.

617
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,300
I spy your name.

618
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,520
A thumb.

619
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,400
A four.

620
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,180
Two keys with three holes.

621
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,100
A closed door.

622
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,720
A ladybug.

623
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,680
The number nine twice.

624
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,860
A peanut.

625
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,840
A penny.

626
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,080
And a pair of dice.

627
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,300
Albert, I saw you respond.

628
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
Like a dog?

629
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,340
I spy your name.

630
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,720
That's me!

631
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,060
A thumb.

632
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,820
A four.

633
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,960
It's just like the end of MGS2.

634
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,040
Two Minky.

635
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,120
That's me you guys!

636
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,440
Oh my gosh.

637
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,400
Two keys with three holes.

638
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,240
Sorry, I should have finished reading it.

639
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,220
One hole?

640
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,840
How does it know my name?

641
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,160
Two keys with three holes.

642
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,880
Two keys with three holes baby.

643
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

644
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,840
I really appreciate it.

645
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,580
Thank you.

646
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,120
At this point we need either a Minky emote or something.

647
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,880
At least a matching kit.

648
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,360
I don't have any more emote slots.

649
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,660
But I was thinking maybe...

650
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,780
So Gringus, yes, I love this game too.

651
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,800
I was thinking of maybe updating events.

652
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,060
I don't want to update some of my 1.0 ones though.

653
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,880
Because like, they're so nostalgic to me.

654
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,960
But I was like maybe I should update my emotes to be...

655
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
To update...

656
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,580
Like, you know, I don't know.

657
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,760
I don't know.

658
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,440
Raymac, thanks for the 10 gifted!

659
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,960
But I have no more emote slots, so...

660
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,880
I don't know yet.

661
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,420
I know, I don't know yet what I want to do.

662
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,660
Please never get rid of the one I drew all those years ago.

663
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,800
A closed door.

664
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,380
Oh.

665
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,680
A closed door.

666
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,540
A ladybug.

667
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,860
That's Barry!

668
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,460
Is that what you were apologizing for?

669
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
You're going to get eaten if you go close to that spider.

670
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,280
The number 9 twice.

671
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,560
OK, I'm blocking this one but it's a pencil.

672
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,760
Can you kind of see it?

673
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,480
The number 9 once.

674
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,160
The number 9 once.

675
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,160
And number 9...

676
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,540
Number 9... Oh here.

677
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,060
Boba isn't on brand anymore.

678
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,080
As on brand anymore.

679
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,780
That's true.

680
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,220
That is true.

681
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,100
It is kind of...

682
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,680
And I have a sippy, don't I?

683
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,040
Like, don't I have a sippy emote?

684
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,580
So maybe we don't need the boba.

685
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,620
True, true, true, true.

686
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,520
That's a 6.

687
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:56,800
No!

688
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,340
You could see!

689
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,160
It's sideways.

690
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,000
Never change this emote.

691
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,840
I love it so much.

692
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,640
A peanut.

693
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,400
Here.

694
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,780
A peanut.

695
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,380
A peanut.

696
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,120
I'm laughing.

697
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,800
Journal reference?

698
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,660
Yeah.

699
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,180
And a pair of dice.

700
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,720
I see one.

701
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,340
I'm blocking it.

702
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,580
You can see it popping behind me.

703
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,440
And two dice.

704
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,340
A pair of dice.

705
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,440
A pair of dice.

706
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,500
A pair of dice.

707
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,150
We are so good at this game!

708
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,270
Oh my god.

709
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,950
My games are tricky.

710
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,690
I'm sure you can tell.

711
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,690
Here's puzzle piece 5.

712
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,570
You're doing quite well.

713
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,230
Thank you.

714
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,470
My games are... Oh his legs were here the whole time.

715
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,550
Nice.

716
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,910
Alright, let's go into this room now.

717
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,770
Oh there's more.

718
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,370
Ok, ok.

719
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,990
We'll start from the left side.

720
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,390
The clock.

721
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,630
Praise the sun!

722
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,970
Upside down 1.

723
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,370
A hand on the wall.

724
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,470
The rhyme for a 3.

725
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,650
A backwards number.

726
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,070
This was the scariest game for me in second grade.

727
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,190
I was so scared of the skeleton and thought the goal was to kill it.

728
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,950
I would shake and force it to turn off my computer.

729
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,280
That's so silly.

730
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,340
Oh my gosh.

731
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,340
I love that though.

732
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,400
I spy Minky.

733
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,380
Me?

734
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,600
Let's see.

735
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
I spy a rhyme.

736
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,680
I see a rhyme up here.

737
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,700
Rhyme.

738
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,100
Time talks.

739
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,100
Tick tock!

740
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,560
Oh my gosh.

741
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,800
A hand to the sun.

742
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,580
This guy is actually demonic.

743
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,480
A hand to the sun.

744
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,320
Like this one?

745
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,200
A hand to the sun.

746
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,380
Praise the sun!

747
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,720
Oh it's a clock hand.

748
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,380
Three horns?

749
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,980
One horn.

750
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,320
What?

751
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,560
That's so cheating.

752
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,840
Two horns.

753
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,160
That feels like it's cheating.

754
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,520
They are right on the same guy.

755
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,180
Three horns.

756
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,440
Minky!

757
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,100
Oh there's the third horn.

758
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Three horns.

759
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:43,980
Minky!

760
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,520
Minky!

761
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,480
The spider!

762
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,220
Oh my gosh.

763
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,600
They were gonna put me down.

764
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,440
They were

765
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,610
gonna...

766
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,310
That's some pig.

767
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,970
That's some Minky.

768
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,630
A skate.

769
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,310
I see it.

770
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,210
A skate.

771
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,890
This game is like... sometimes that one was nice, but sometimes it's like anti-ASMR.

772
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,830
You know if they remade this nowadays, all the sounds would be like super...

773
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,110
super satisfying.

774
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:39,890
You know what I mean?

775
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,990
An upside down one.

776
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,750
Oh I see it!

777
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,310
An upside down one.

778
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,030
A hand on the wall.

779
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,710
I see it.

780
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,230
Eww!

781
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,990
Who is tickling that guy?

782
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,230
A rhyme for a three?

783
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,250
Rhyme for a three?

784
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:03,850
What does that mean?

785
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,130
A backwards number?

786
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,070
Rhyme for a three.

787
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,390
Oh!

788
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:15,890
B?

789
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,070
B!

790
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,310
The rhyme for a three.

791
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,630
A crack.

792
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,090
Is it this thing?

793
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,350
A crack.

794
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm glad... I'm glad there's no Magic the Gathering players here.

795
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,320
And a key.

796
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,240
A key.

797
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,560
Oh

798
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,340
with his foot even!

799
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,480
Skelly is kind of freaky.

800
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,600
I should re-dub this game.

801
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,540
Dinner is served everybody!

802
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,800
Oh my god!

803
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,220
Look at how many lizards there are!

804
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,640
A fork face.

805
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,200
Eww this thing.

806
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,700
Oh my gosh Skelly really just jump scared me there.

807
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,340
A tongue?

808
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,160
Where would a tongue be?

809
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,140
Oh here it is!

810
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:50,900
Oh my gosh!

811
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,180
We're going to touch the snake's tongue.

812
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,610
A tongue.

813
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,990
Two nails.

814
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,110
I'm blocking the second nail.

815
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,630
Sorry guys.

816
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,040
Two nails.

817
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,920
A face on a coin.

818
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,320
Mr. Lincoln.

819
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,640
I convinced myself and another girl at my daycare that the iSpy books had some kind of cryptic ARG in the meanings.

820
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,220
Sounds like something I would have done.

821
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,740
Three lizard tails.

822
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,560
Oh my gosh.

823
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,840
Wait, but this guy.

824
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,420
Can we tickle him out?

825
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,160
Oh here's the third lizard!

826
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,740
I'm literally sorting magic cards right now.

827
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,540
What are you going to do Eternity?

828
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,430
Two lizard tails.

829
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,850
Three lizard tails.

830
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:09,550
A spitter.

831
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,970
A spider.

832
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,390
A screw.

833
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:15,810
A screw.

834
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,390
A screw.

835
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,730
Oh that's a nail.

836
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,650
Is this a screw?

837
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:20,770
No that's a bolt.

838
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,170
A screw.

839
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,250
A screw.

840
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,010
A screw?

841
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,710
A screw.

842
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,510
You saw it?

843
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,770
A screw.

844
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:34,790
A screw.

845
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,530
It's a screw.

846
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,210
Screw.

847
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,370
Screw.

848
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,350
Screw.

849
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,290
Screw.

850
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:46,990
A screw.

851
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:47,110
A screw.

852
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,130
A screw.

853
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,250
A screw.

854
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,570
A screw.

855
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,770
I'm blocking it but there is an eyeball on the table.

856
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:00,410
Freaky.

857
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:02,590
Two sticks for a drum.

858
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,210
Bless you.

859
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,210
A spoonful of bugs.

860
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,570
Eww.

861
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,390
Eww Matara-Kan go away.

862
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,670
A yum.

863
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,070
There is one yum here.

864
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,290
I'm kind of blocking it.

865
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:22,530
Sorry.

866
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,990
I can't believe Matara is going to be in my house.

867
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,390
Yum.

868
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,000
Where is a screw?

869
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,280
Screw.

870
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,520
A screw.

871
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,120
Screw.

872
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:50,920
A screw.

873
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,640
Is this a screw?

874
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,200
A screw.

875
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,380
A screw.

876
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,560
The fork yum is clever.

877
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,220
It's cute right?

878
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,340
You saw that.

879
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,840
I got confused.

880
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,100
I was thinking of the screwdriver instead of the screw screw.

881
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,120
And go.

882
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,660
Thanks for the super chat.

883
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,180
Thank you.

884
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,680
Thank you.

885
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,940
The fork does not look like a face to me.

886
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,500
This one?

887
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,000
Ok here.

888
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,440
It's the eyes here.

889
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,460
And then this is a big old nose.

890
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,520
And then he's got a big creepy smile.

891
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,560
He looks like an uncle.

892
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,240
He looks like a big water drop.

893
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,280
But his eyes, eye, eye, nose, smile.

894
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,820
Yeah, you see it now?

895
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,260
You see it now?

896
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,680
Like a reflection.

897
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,840
Is that me?

898
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,380
Is that me?

899
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,260
Are you saying I got a big nose?

900
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,920
Are you saying I have a big nose now?

901
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,020
Look at that dog.

902
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,540
I think this is the last one in here.

903
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh what is this?

904
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,520
The kitchen?

905
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,180
Oh my god that cat is so cute.

906
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,460
Ew!

907
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,240
See you.

908
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,780
I see you.

909
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,480
I didn't know that there were Metal Gear references in this game.

910
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,500
Wow!

911
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,260
Ice Spice?

912
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,440
I heard it too.

913
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,140
Ice Spice.

914
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,900
I heard that too.

915
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,680
I was like...

916
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,900
I have you.

917
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,600
Spice.

918
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,200
A knife.

919
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,300
What do you have?

920
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,580
A knife.

921
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,120
Where is the knife?

922
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,560
Knife.

923
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,640
Knife.

924
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,400
Oh there it is.

925
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,220
No!

926
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,120
A four.

927
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,240
A four, four, four, four, four.

928
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,960
Oh this is the handrail, right?

929
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,340
What's a rebus door?

930
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:35,720
This?

931
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,800
Oh god.

932
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,580
Stop!

933
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,640
Can I see you pee?

934
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,080
No!

935
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,660
I come!

936
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,120
No!

937
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,260
A rebus door.

938
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,220
What the hell is that?

939
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,700
A bug?

940
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,940
A spoon in a bowl?

941
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,680
Oh I forgot the four.

942
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,100
Where is the four at?

943
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,620
There is the bug in the spoon.

944
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,360
Oh my god!

945
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,180
They added it to the recipe.

946
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,600
Shape of a moon.

947
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,240
Oh I see the four.

948
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,120
I see it.

949
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,040
Guys, dinner is almost ready.

950
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,920
A scale.

951
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,160
Oh down here?

952
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,180
This game is like missing music, but like...

953
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,180
It has the music when you find stuff, but like...

954
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
It's missing actual music.

955
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,220
Like just some BGM, you know?

956
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,200
A shell.

957
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,860
Do you guys see the shell anywhere?

958
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,600
I wish the cat was a thing.

959
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,720
Oh I'm blocking it, but there is a hotdog in it.

960
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,380
Ok, hold on.

961
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,560
Oh wait, I can't click out.

962
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,640
No!

963
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,860
Oh eggshell, you guys are so smart.

964
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,960
I wish I could show you the hotdog.

965
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Here, I'll print screen it.

966
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,620
And I'll send it to you guys later.

967
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,690
Who decided on that sound?

968
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,290
Oh it was terrible.

969
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,670
They need to oil the skilly man.

970
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,530
It sounds so bad.

971
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,870
Wiener pick.

972
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:30,450
No!

973
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,490
Corey has escaped.

974
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,350
What is going on?

975
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,410
Who haunts this mansion anyway?

976
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,390
Let's do this one.

977
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,250
It sounds insane.

978
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,810
Oh no, it's this again.

979
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,750
Ready, set, go!

980
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,770
I was taking a drink.

981
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,470
Oh no, I missed the butterfly.

982
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,010
Oh my god it's timed also.

983
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,450
This is timed also.

984
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:21,950
How am I supposed to get the world record if you are not giving me anything that I need?

985
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,830
No, that's a duck.

986
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,150
Yes!

987
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,390
Not the world record though.

988
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,490
Alright, this is RNG run.

989
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,390
I hate this!

990
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,310
Bug.

991
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,050
Bug.

992
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,370
That's a fish.

993
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:48,810
Bug.

994
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,910
Bug.

995
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:51,130
That's a duck.

996
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:51,650
Bug.

997
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:52,370
Bug.

998
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:53,830
Bug.

999
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:54,970
Hi Barry.

1000
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,970
Oh they are going fast.

1001
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,730
I did it!

1002
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:05,190
Oh my god.

1003
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,010
Shadows

1004
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,040
Please give me what I need.

1005
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,620
My world record please!

1006
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,680
Hot dog!

1007
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,980
My world record!

1008
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,040
Please!

1009
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,520
Please!

1010
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,180
Thank

1011
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,400
you.

1012
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,000
Thank you Skelly-Man.

1013
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,240
I spy the cutest baby sister that Shimiko could ever ask for.

1014
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,660
My PB though.

1015
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,700
My PB.

1016
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:53,720
Musical.

1017
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,180
Oh wait.

1018
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,020
It's not giving me anything.

1019
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,120
That counts.

1020
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,140
You guys, I don't know if I can get faster than 16.

1021
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,780
Come on!

1022
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,700
I don't think I can get faster than 16.

1023
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,280
PB.

1024
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,620
Personal best.

1025
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,080
Fish.

1026
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,960
Fish.

1027
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:27,780
Fish!

1028
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,780
Gone fishing boys.

1029
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,300
We are going fishing.

1030
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,610
Fish!

1031
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:37,370
Fish!

1032
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,570
Duck doesn't count right?

1033
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,910
Fish!

1034
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,350
Fish!

1035
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,760
Which ones are still in the...

1036
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,750
That's a dog!

1037
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,070
Fish!

1038
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:57,590
Fish!

1039
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,210
I give up.

1040
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,430
I think...oh hand.

1041
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:08,970
I think 16 might be the best I can get in this game.

1042
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,850
They don't give me anything.

1043
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:16,590
Oh.

1044
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,070
Oh baby.

1045
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:19,270
Baby hand.

1046
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,850
Oh severed hand.

1047
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,810
That's a little morbid.

1048
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,130
It's a little scary.

1049
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,830
How did they get that reference image?

1050
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,750
Come on!

1051
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,490
I think 16 is our best.

1052
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:32,350
Alright.

1053
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,430
OK last try.

1054
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:38,890
Oh my god it's so cute.

1055
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:41,790
Anything counts.

1056
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,640
As long as it's an animal.

1057
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,380
Come on!

1058
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,500
Come on!

1059
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,780
Yes!

1060
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,220
Yes!

1061
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,340
15 seconds baby!

1062
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,060
OK we beat it.

1063
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,780
Your Karaokes are great for long road trip car rides.

1064
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,200
I got pulled over listening to what?

1065
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,900
Cop and I vibe to Heaven's Divide and he let me go?

1066
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,080
What?

1067
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,680
Did that really happen?

1068
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,500
No way!

1069
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,110
This room is so spoo...what's this?

1070
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,230
Oh my god this is so fun!

1071
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,350
Oh my god this one is so cool!

1072
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,230
I spy a spitter.

1073
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:42,970
Spitter, spitter, spitter.

1074
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:43,830
That's a fly.

1075
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,350
I'm so sorry guys.

1076
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:46,730
I wish I could make myself smaller.

1077
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,310
Any minkies around?

1078
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,650
Look there is a fish.

1079
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,430
Wow these are so cool!

1080
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,430
And then this guy over here.

1081
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,270
I was the burglary hiding in the car.

1082
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,030
Look at this ghost!

1083
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,530
Looks just like me.

1084
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,810
Oh gosh you can see the skelly face.

1085
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,170
A spider.

1086
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:16,370
A spider.

1087
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:17,990
Oh I see the feather.

1088
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,670
Oh I see the lightning bolt.

1089
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,870
These ones are not so direct you know.

1090
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,290
A face made of spots.

1091
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:29,410
I got it.

1092
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:32,610
A face made of spots.

1093
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,690
An old graveyard.

1094
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,790
An old gravestone.

1095
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:39,830
Oh I see the spider.

1096
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,050
It's just an actual spider.

1097
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:43,790
A spider.

1098
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,390
A bone.

1099
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,910
Oh that was easy.

1100
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,410
A bone.

1101
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,410
Ok but this one actually kind of looks like me.

1102
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,550
Ok this is my eye.

1103
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,190
And then this is me winking.

1104
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,630
And then this is my tooth.

1105
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,710
Do you guys see it?

1106
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,250
Do you guys see this one?

1107
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,990
It actually looks like me.

1108
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,030
And I'm smiling and then this is my fang.

1109
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,560
Yeah?

1110
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,080
A water drop.

1111
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,540
Is this it?

1112
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,360
A water drop.

1113
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,780
Swamp.

1114
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,720
Swamp.

1115
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,360
Swamp.

1116
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,140
Swamp.

1117
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,260
Swamp.

1118
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,280
Swamp.

1119
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,620
Stay out of my... Swamp.

1120
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,460
Don't care.

1121
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,220
Hey don't care.

1122
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,120
Swamp.

1123
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,700
Three nails.

1124
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,200
Here's one.

1125
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,120
One nail.

1126
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,540
Two nails.

1127
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,340
Two nails.

1128
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,480
Two yellow tails.

1129
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:58,940
There's one.

1130
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,480
I don't know if that's a tail.

1131
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,240
One yellow tail.

1132
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,220
It's like a yellow...

1133
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,460
butt.

1134
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,320
What would the other yellow tail be?

1135
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,220
A swamp.

1136
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,820
Do you guys see a swamp?

1137
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,660
Scream.

1138
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,080
Swamp.

1139
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,860
This is freaky.

1140
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,600
You see it?

1141
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:25,820
Swamp.

1142
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:27,980
What am I missing?

1143
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,020
Swamp.

1144
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,840
Swamp.

1145
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,060
Swamp.

1146
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,280
I need one more nail.

1147
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,040
Oh I see it.

1148
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,280
That one was tricky.

1149
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,260
That one was really well hidden.

1150
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,260
Now one more yellow tail.

1151
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,220
This one maybe.

1152
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,700
Two yellow tails.

1153
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,480
Thank you.

1154
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,480
Thank you.

1155
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,120
That one was fun.

1156
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,380
What else is in here?

1157
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,800
Oh just these two?

1158
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,540
I know that if this game was remade too.

1159
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,180
Like for now times.

1160
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,460
It would be like you would click on something.

1161
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,000
Like his head would spin and she would like sneeze.

1162
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,480
This guy would crawl.

1163
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,180
You know what I mean?

1164
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,220
A backwards book.

1165
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,480
A rat eye that's red.

1166
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,600
A T back in place.

1167
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,300
My head is covering the rat's eye.

1168
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:48,680
Sorry.

1169
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,460
He's pointing at me!

1170
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,520
That guy is pointing at me!

1171
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,680
What do you want?

1172
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,100
I'm scared.

1173
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:03,900
Let's get the rat.

1174
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,140
A rat eye that's red.

1175
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:09,680
You can kinda see it when I do.

1176
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,180
You know?

1177
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,840
He sees me!

1178
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,340
I don't want this kind of attraction.

1179
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,940
I mean attention.

1180
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:42,880
I'm so excited.

1181
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:43,940
I can finally ask for this.

1182
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,060
My birthday is this Thursday.

1183
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:45,880
Can I get a happy birthday?

1184
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,400
Really busy this week preparing for my idol debut and graduation.

1185
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,060
Oh my god, Ashes.

1186
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,480
Good thing you asked today because Thursday I won't be streaming.

1187
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,880
So yeah, of course!

1188
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,080
Happy birthday to you.

1189
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,520
Happy birthday to you.

1190
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,880
Happy birthday dear Ashes.

1191
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,940
Happy birthday to you.

1192
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:27,270
Good luck with your idol debut graduation!

1193
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,450
Alrighty, a ladder.

1194
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:34,890
A ladder.

1195
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,850
This is so sad, the little waxy mouse head.

1196
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,690
A waxy mouse head.

1197
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,810
Do you ever have trouble finding a trustworthy babysitter for Butaro and Paz when you travel?

1198
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,230
No, because I have my roommate.

1199
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,990
My roommate doesn't mind, so it's all good.

1200
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,490
Rockero, welcome back for 4 months!

1201
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:58,790
Why are you pointing at me?

1202
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,950
Do the glasses give you a buff to your intelligence or to your...

1203
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,630
What's C-H-R?

1204
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:07,970
C-H-R.

1205
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,790
C-H-R.

1206
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:11,730
C-H-R.

1207
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,830
Oh, charisma!

1208
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,190
Definitely my intelligence.

1209
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,230
A backwards book.

1210
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:19,850
This one?

1211
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,450
A backwards book.

1212
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:22,790
Oh, that's fun.

1213
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,890
A T back in place.

1214
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,730
The seventh ghost.

1215
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,270
The wiener's cup.

1216
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,750
What the hell?

1217
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,730
A wiener's cup.

1218
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,190
A wiener's cup.

1219
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:44,690
A gyroscope.

1220
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:48,810
A gyroscope.

1221
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:52,090
I see this T, but a T back in place.

1222
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,810
Is this a T?

1223
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:53,210
No.

1224
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:53,770
Oh, T!

1225
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,690
Where does it go?

1226
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:56,030
Here!

1227
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,090
A T back in place.

1228
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,530
And a bug crawling up.

1229
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,490
A bug crawling up.

1230
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,070
That's Doki's cup.

1231
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,210
Thank you!

1232
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:19,990
Piece 11 is what you have won.

1233
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:20,570
11?

1234
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,570
You'll get out of the house when the message is done.

1235
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,450
When the message is done.

1236
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:28,950
Skeet?

1237
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,140
S-K-E-E-T

1238
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,460
I like this other second Metal Gear reference.

1239
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,000
Skeet on study.

1240
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,200
I think we did everything in this room.

1241
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,860
This looks like it would be one, but I guess not.

1242
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,740
So now we get out of the study and we go into the bedroom.

1243
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,060
Wait, no, the attic.

1244
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,660
We'll save the attic for last.

1245
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,160
It's probably the spookiest.

1246
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,660
Oh, there's three in here.

1247
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,680
I wish I could move over some more.

1248
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,660
I'm so sorry guys.

1249
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,380
Let's go to the bathroom.

1250
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,780
I'm assuming this is the bathroom.

1251
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,040
Oh my god, we're intruding!

1252
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,380
Get a grip!

1253
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,720
And a candle flame.

1254
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,740
A bar of soap.

1255
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,660
A bar of soap.

1256
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,280
A toothbrush.

1257
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,940
This one is pretty well hidden.

1258
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,720
That one is pretty well hidden.

1259
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,520
Toothbrush.

1260
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,980
Look at... I actually... I want... This is the nicest... This is such a nice bathroom.

1261
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,520
The wallpaper is nice.

1262
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,620
The little piggy and polar bears are good.

1263
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,260
A trap.

1264
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,480
A trap.

1265
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,800
A trap.

1266
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,900
You got a little skelly man taking a bath.

1267
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,440
Look at the water is clean and everything.

1268
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,440
This place... This place has been used.

1269
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,380
A silver handle.

1270
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,040
Silver handle.

1271
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,080
One jack.

1272
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,460
Two jacks.

1273
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,880
Someone wrote my name in the smoke!

1274
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:51,920
In the steam!

1275
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:52,940
Oh my god.

1276
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,340
This is terrifying.

1277
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,660
This game is so scary you guys.

1278
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,720
A nine.

1279
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,520
It's a six now.

1280
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,160
A square picture frame.

1281
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,680
This is... Oh.

1282
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,760
Which one is square enough?

1283
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,620
This one is square?

1284
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,300
This one is... No, no.

1285
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,600
A toothbrush.

1286
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:13,560
This one?

1287
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,080
This one.

1288
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,640
Square picture frame.

1289
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,380
This one.

1290
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,240
A square picture frame.

1291
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,540
A square picture frame.

1292
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,120
A grip on a pole.

1293
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,540
What does that mean?

1294
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,680
A brown bottle cap.

1295
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,920
And a candle flame.

1296
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,980
A candle flame is easy.

1297
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,780
A candle flame.

1298
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,100
Minky in da house.

1299
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,820
I am haunting this place.

1300
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,740
Oh there is the bottle cap!

1301
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,920
Oh my gosh!

1302
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,620
A brown bottle cap.

1303
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,240
A silver handle and a grip on a pole.

1304
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,020
Is this the pole?

1305
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:58,820
No.

1306
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,960
Look at this guy's face in the wall.

1307
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:02,700
It's freaky.

1308
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,700
It's pretty freaky.

1309
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,240
A grip on a pole.

1310
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:07,800
Oh wait!

1311
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,540
There is the...

1312
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,440
Lampy!

1313
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,180
Thanks for the gifted!

1314
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:15,580
A pole.

1315
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,260
A grip on a pole.

1316
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:19,100
Oh like this.

1317
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,280
The grip... OK.

1318
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,540
I was thinking like gripping a pole.

1319
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,300
So I was thinking like a hand...

1320
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,680
Like a hand gripping the pole.

1321
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,320
You know what I mean?

1322
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,120
Yeah, yeah.

1323
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,100
How many pieces have you gotten from me?

1324
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:35,560
12!

1325
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,620
Here is a hint.

1326
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,240
It's 15 minus 3.

1327
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,680
I love the ducky has like super anime eyes.

1328
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,460
I don't know if you can tell but they are like very bright and full of life.

1329
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,360
Let's go into their closet.

1330
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:14,740
I spy a saddle, crossed legs, a rickety chair, a handshake, a handstand, four braids of hair, a boy in a frame, a girl in a hoop, a pair of blue jeans, and a yo-yo loop.

1331
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,440
Scratch that.

1332
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,680
Answered my own question.

1333
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,540
Huh?

1334
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,100
Like...

1335
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,000
Oh my god!

1336
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,280
Oh god!

1337
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,340
We finally got to...

1338
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,320
We got to the haunted part of the...

1339
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,760
We got to the spooky mansion part of the...

1340
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:37,700
Snake?

1341
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,520
Oh yeah.

1342
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,680
I mean...

1343
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,860
Oh my gosh this one is terrifying.

1344
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,180
I spy a saddle.

1345
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,320
A saddle.

1346
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,560
He is so polite though.

1347
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,900
Look at him.

1348
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,760
Crossed legs!

1349
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,400
Oh my god!

1350
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,880
A rickety chair?

1351
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,180
Oh my god!

1352
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,440
Help her!

1353
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,380
The chair is about to take off.

1354
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,700
It's too rickety.

1355
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,240
A boy in a frame?

1356
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,060
OK.

1357
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,480
I'm glad the boy didn't move.

1358
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,040
I do not understand.

1359
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,860
Please describe in detail a hand gripping a pole please.

1360
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,600
Stop!

1361
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,300
Stop it.

1362
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,120
I'm new to the VTuber scene but I love W3D.

1363
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,620
Doki and you will be supporting.

1364
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,620
Thank you!

1365
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,040
Thank you so much!

1366
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,320
I really appreciate it.

1367
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,320
And thanks for the super chat!

1368
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:39,900
A saddle.

1369
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,220
A saddle, saddle, saddle.

1370
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,320
Saddle, yaddle, yaddle, yaddle.

1371
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,260
Four braids of hair.

1372
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:44,680
Oh one?

1373
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:45,820
Or two?

1374
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,680
Two braids of hair.

1375
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,500
Four braids of hair.

1376
01:09:54,660 --> 01:10:00,500
Can you imagine this game but with...instead of like the things moving the way they do now, it's like live 2D.

1377
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,320
A handstand.

1378
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,440
A handshake.

1379
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,000
A handshake.

1380
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,280
A yo-yo.

1381
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,140
A yo-yo loop.

1382
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,740
A yo-yo loop.

1383
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:23,700
Did you guys know that I used to do like... I wouldn't say professional yo-yoing but like...

1384
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,300
I did like...

1385
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,080
Like real intense yo-yoing.

1386
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,930
Like I would do the walk the dog.

1387
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1388
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:35,930
Things like that.

1389
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:40,690
Like I bought... I actually had like professional grade yo-yos and stuff like that.

1390
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:45,750
I was super into yo-yoing for like a little bit of time.

1391
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:50,130
No, I didn't ever do it competitively.

1392
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:54,390
Like I had... Me and like one other friend, we got really into yo-yoing together.

1393
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:01,690
And so after school, we would do the yo-yo stuff together and I like had... I had like...

1394
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:03,530
What's it called?

1395
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,710
Like videos on yo-yoing and...

1396
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,870
I don't remember how... Why I got into it though.

1397
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,230
I don't remember why.

1398
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:15,810
But I remember I really loved my yo-yo because it was...

1399
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,130
It was a glow-in-the-dark yo-yo.

1400
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:21,470
So it was like kind of ectoplasm colored-ish.

1401
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,390
Like it was like a creamy green.

1402
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:27,410
Like a cream... Well, you know like how glow-in-the-dark stuff is.

1403
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:30,030
How it's like kind of not quite white.

1404
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,190
It looks like snot.

1405
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,410
I love that thing.

1406
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,830
Oh my gosh, I love that thing.

1407
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:39,650
A girl in a hoop?

1408
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:39,910
Oh.

1409
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,390
Look at her go!

1410
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,970
A pair of blue jeans!

1411
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,290
Oh my gosh.

1412
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,830
A saddle.

1413
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,450
It's the only thing I can't find.

1414
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,130
Yo-yo stream win?

1415
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,090
I don't know if I could still do it.

1416
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,050
Glasses and yo-yo skills bring out the geek sexy.

1417
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:04,730
Stop!

1418
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,430
I don't know what that means.

1419
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,470
All us millennials are really into yo-yoing.

1420
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,490
Did you ever do Devil Sticks or Fushigi Bomb?

1421
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:15,350
No.

1422
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,270
Only yo-yo.

1423
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:19,630
Fuzzy Snake?

1424
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:20,010
No.

1425
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,490
Only yo-yo.

1426
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:28,310
Okay, but there is a difference between being into yo-yoing and then like actually doing like...

1427
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,450
You know, like someone could yo-yo, but then someone...

1428
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,250
You know, it's different.

1429
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:33,610
It's a different thing.

1430
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,250
I didn't just have a normal yo-yo.

1431
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:39,410
I had a really expensive yo-yo.

1432
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:42,110
I had to save up so much for it.

1433
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:53,370
Minky!

1434
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,210
The advanced yo-yo.

1435
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:55,630
Yeah!

1436
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,330
A full moon!

1437
01:12:59,390 --> 01:12:59,870
Minky!

1438
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,830
Oh my gosh, this is my book!

1439
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:04,470
I'm a published author.

1440
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:08,070
What the moon brought.

1441
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,190
Is this Yuri?

1442
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:10,810
What is this?

1443
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,110
What?

1444
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:16,810
It's my book.

1445
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,530
I'm a published author.

1446
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,680
Footprints.

1447
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:24,660
Footprints.

1448
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,280
Footprints.

1449
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:25,940
Footprints.

1450
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:26,560
Footprints.

1451
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,380
It says footprints.

1452
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,040
Oh here.

1453
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:32,780
Footprints.

1454
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,720
Three bows.

1455
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,260
One...

1456
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:37,980
Two...

1457
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,960
Two bows.

1458
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,580
Oh my gosh, he's all tucked away.

1459
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,620
That's so cute.

1460
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,560
Little Skelly.

1461
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,780
You're truly the platonic ideal of an otaku.

1462
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:52,640
Shut up.

1463
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,780
You know, actually I take that as a compliment.

1464
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,420
Oh three.

1465
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,280
Wow, that one is hidden.

1466
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,340
That one is so good.

1467
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,280
It's the third bow.

1468
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,280
Oh my gosh.

1469
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,100
Yeah, the third bow is so sneaky.

1470
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,560
That's good.

1471
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,120
That's good.

1472
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,020
A face with no eyes.

1473
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:15,310
A face with no eyes.

1474
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,130
A clock face.

1475
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:21,350
A foot with no toes.

1476
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:25,810
Is this an old cow?

1477
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,470
I guess he kind of has toes.

1478
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,910
A foot with no toes.

1479
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,560
Nose of a mouse.

1480
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,140
Oh my gosh, it's so cute.

1481
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,540
A porcelain head.

1482
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,220
Sorry I'm blocking her, but it's for your own safety honestly.

1483
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,560
An eye back in place.

1484
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,540
An eye back in place.

1485
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,260
A needle.

1486
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,520
Does this count?

1487
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,240
No.

1488
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,360
A needle.

1489
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,600
Oh, a foot with no toes.

1490
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,780
Oh my gosh, a foot with no toes.

1491
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,920
American joke.

1492
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,000
Needle.

1493
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,480
A needle.

1494
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,980
And thread.

1495
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:15,980
Thread.

1496
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:17,820
Thread.

1497
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,340
Thread.

1498
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,540
Oh here.

1499
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:24,980
Thread.

1500
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:42,590
One Piece?

1501
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:44,910
The One Piece is real!

1502
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,430
Wait, no way.

1503
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,250
Oh my gosh, boobs.

1504
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:52,370
Wait, I want to go see.

1505
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,430
Oh, maybe we should have been doing this the whole time.

1506
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,670
This one?

1507
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,430
There are too many pieces.

1508
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:10,290
It's hard to see.

1509
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:11,190
Here?

1510
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:12,950
Here?

1511
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:15,630
Here?

1512
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,070
Here?

1513
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:20,970
Here?

1514
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:23,850
Here?

1515
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:26,670
I can't see it.

1516
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:27,050
Oh there?

1517
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,010
Let's do this one.

1518
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,530
Let's do this one.

1519
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,230
Oh my gosh, guys.

1520
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,030
You guys!

1521
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,650
And this one.

1522
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:41,050
Time to get out.

1523
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:42,470
Are you ready now?

1524
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:45,210
I wrote this message to show you how.

1525
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:56,790
Oh, go to the room with a spider on the ceiling to find a door I've been concealing.

1526
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,470
Find three books on a... shit?

1527
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,310
Shelf?

1528
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,630
Sorry, I went S-H-T.

1529
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,930
With a white man.

1530
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,470
Pull them in this order.

1531
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,710
Blue, green, then red.

1532
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:12,550
Skeleton.

1533
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,690
Elf on the Shelf.

1534
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:16,170
Real.

1535
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,800
I thought the same thing.

1536
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,640
Oh my gosh, this is so scary!

1537
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,300
Kazoo!

1538
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,980
I see the monster face.

1539
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,420
A monster face.

1540
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,420
Let's buy a skate.

1541
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:53,980
A skate.

1542
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,160
Skate.

1543
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:56,920
Oh there is a saw.

1544
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,940
A saw.

1545
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,600
Boo in the bottom right.

1546
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:02,760
Boo!

1547
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,660
We had a professional yo-yoer come to our school once.

1548
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:14,740
I think it was the same year we had an ex-wrestler tell us bullying was bad before he ripped a phone book in half and bent a metal back over his knee.

1549
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:15,380
What?

1550
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:16,980
No way.

1551
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,560
We had the people from... Oh my gosh, what was it called?

1552
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,240
That TV show.

1553
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,020
Fear Factor.

1554
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,800
They came to my school.

1555
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,260
The Fear Factor people.

1556
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,660
And I ate bugs.

1557
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,460
They were like cute ones to eat bugs.

1558
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,600
And I said...

1559
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,740
It was so awesome.

1560
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,240
I never had a wrestler though.

1561
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:43,520
Man!

1562
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,720
Black picture frame.

1563
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,160
Let's go.

1564
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:46,520
Oh here.

1565
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,260
A black picture frame.

1566
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,220
Yeah, I willingly did that.

1567
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:54,760
Oh kazoo!

1568
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,240
Oh a zoo.

1569
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,300
I see the skate also.

1570
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,300
A skate.

1571
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:10,610
Who?

1572
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,750
Who is... Joe?

1573
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,770
Is that a guy from Fear Factor?

1574
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,690
What if Minto was called Pinto?

1575
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,990
She was the first ever BeanTuber.

1576
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:25,450
Pinto Bean.

1577
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:26,570
Joe Mama!

1578
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:27,230
No!

1579
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:30,350
Oh my

1580
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,270
go...

1581
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:42,890
Boo.

1582
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,990
Boo.

1583
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:46,130
Got him.

1584
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,160
A ball for a game.

1585
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,440
It's a baseball.

1586
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,000
A ball for a game.

1587
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,520
A bat.

1588
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:01,120
Like a baseball bat or a bat bat?

1589
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,440
Oh!

1590
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,440
A bat bat.

1591
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,900
To be fair, the guy from Fear Factor is Joe Rogan.

1592
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,340
Oh, I don't know who came.

1593
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,300
I don't remember at all.

1594
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,520
I just remember them asking me to eat bugs.

1595
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,160
I don't know.

1596
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,520
Is he like a famous guy then that asked me to eat the bugs?

1597
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,100
I have no idea.

1598
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:31,420
Was he bald?

1599
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,180
I don't know.

1600
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,760
I remember one lady and one guy.

1601
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,720
So I don't really remember.

1602
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,020
I don't know.

1603
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,040
He's pretty famous.

1604
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,480
Yeah, but beware Matara.

1605
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,840
I'll eat your head off.

1606
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,820
I'll eat you just like... Isn't that what they do when they are mating?

1607
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,900
Oh a wooden chair.

1608
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,520
Oh my gosh.

1609
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:58,820
Snakey.

1610
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,180
A wooden chair.

1611
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,620
See the cage?

1612
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,040
A cage.

1613
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,020
Two snakes.

1614
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,520
Twin snakes.

1615
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,940
Oh my gosh that's a fish.

1616
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,680
Twin snakes.

1617
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:11,620
Twin snakes.

1618
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:12,860
Snakes.

1619
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:13,900
Twin snakes.

1620
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,120
Oh one snake!

1621
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,660
Corey has burned the house down.

1622
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,980
Is everything ok there Albert?

1623
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,840
Is everything ok there?

1624
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,700
I went and slept at the science museum for school.

1625
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,540
I loved things like that.

1626
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:29,100
Yes!

1627
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,440
I never did them for school.

1628
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,660
But I was in Girl Scouts.

1629
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,220
I did those for Girl Scouts.

1630
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,380
Does that count as a candle?

1631
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,500
No it's a candlestick.

1632
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,240
Oh candle is behind me.

1633
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,860
A candle.

1634
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,400
Alright one more snake.

1635
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,820
One more snake.

1636
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,880
One more snake.

1637
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,780
Do you guys see the second snake?

1638
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,640
Snake.

1639
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,460
One more snake.

1640
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,080
We got this guy.

1641
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,560
Look at that cat.

1642
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,520
So cute.

1643
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,180
Albert?

1644
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,160
Max camo index real.

1645
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,740
I don't see him.

1646
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,720
Two snakes.

1647
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:20,120
Sneaky!

1648
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,240
We

1649
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:31,960
get to leave the house.

1650
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,620
Here's your last piece.

1651
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,780
You're finished.

1652
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,200
You're done.

1653
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,660
Decode the secret message and this game will be won.

1654
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,080
I believe though.

1655
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:53,720
I think I remember from when I was a kid that you can play the game again and there is different puzzles.

1656
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,540
If I remember correctly.

1657
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,700
Pick up your piece.

1658
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,940
It's time to get out.

1659
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,820
Are you ready now?

1660
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,380
I wrote this message to show you how.

1661
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,380
No, you're spoiling it.

1662
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:21,860
I'm supposed to decode it myself.

1663
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,560
To find a door I've been concealing.

1664
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,600
Find three books on a shelf with a white head.

1665
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,860
Oh that's a head.

1666
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,800
I thought it was a white man.

1667
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:39,240
Reminds me of when we had a science man come to our school I went to.

1668
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,760
I got picked for a turn as a volunteer and we had to do is eat plastic.

1669
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:43,740
Wait, what?

1670
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:50,980
You had to eat... Wait, they made you eat plastic?

1671
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,560
D plus Ear Minky.

1672
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,100
The shit elf.

1673
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,140
They made you eat plastic?

1674
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,460
That's so messed up.

1675
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,180
Delicious microplastics.

1676
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,080
Minky!

1677
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,920
Why wouldn't you say this part game?

1678
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,360
Ok, wait.

1679
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,420
Actually we have to figure this out.

1680
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,520
Room with a spider on the ceiling.

1681
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:23,700
And then three books on a... I keep reading.

1682
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,300
I keep reading shit elf.

1683
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,280
I was that science man.

1684
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:31,500
I just wanted to watch cool kids eat plastic.

1685
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,980
Alright guys, remember blue, green, red.

1686
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:37,640
Ganker!

1687
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,540
We had a professional yo-yo... Oh wait.

1688
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,420
In high school my cousin got caught drinking and driving.

1689
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:53,400
He ended up in a colostomy bag.

1690
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:00,180
So they sent a guy to our school... Wait, what?

1691
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,340
They sent a guy to our school to tell us it was bad.

1692
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,800
During the climax of his speech it's dead silent.

1693
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,660
My cousin's bag goes...

1694
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,300
And it killed the speech.

1695
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,520
What happened in there?

1696
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,700
The bag is filled with poo.

1697
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:29,100
No!

1698
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:35,860
Why did your cousin have to do that because of drunk driving?

1699
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,850
Ok, room with a spider on the ceiling.

1700
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:46,750
Find three books on the shit elf.

1701
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:48,770
Ok, room with a spider on the ceiling.

1702
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:50,890
Does this room have a spider?

1703
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:51,290
No.

1704
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:53,310
This room?

1705
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:56,710
No.

1706
01:25:58,950 --> 01:25:59,470
Upstairs.

1707
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,510
This room.

1708
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,770
Three bookshelves.

1709
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:06,630
I mean three shelves.

1710
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,670
What was the order?

1711
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,470
There is a lot of red.

1712
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:19,430
Oh I see him!

1713
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,770
Blue, green, red?

1714
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:23,290
No way.

1715
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,650
I got lucky?

1716
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:25,530
Holy moly.

1717
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,330
I got lucky!

1718
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,530
Are you telling me to jump out the window?

1719
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:47,230
What the hell?

1720
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,130
Are you telling me to jump out the window?

1721
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:52,190
To do trick, scare, haunt.

1722
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,090
That's my to do list.

1723
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,690
Are you here?

1724
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,950
Also I love this.

1725
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,550
Oh my god I love the portrait of him with his mom.

1726
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:06,750
Boo!

1727
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:09,050
I guess I'll jump out the window now.

1728
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,630
Good thing I'm a ghost.

1729
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,640
Why is it so crackly?

1730
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:37,920
If you dare to come back in, a new adventure will begin.

1731
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,920
OK let's do it.

1732
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,080
Let's go back in baby!

1733
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:54,820
Look it's different!

1734
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:55,180
There's more.

1735
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,920
Could there be another door?

1736
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,540
New game plus time.

1737
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,000
Different rat.

1738
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,200
If you want to get out now, go to the kitchen.

1739
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,820
I'll show you how.

1740
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,560
The kitchen.

1741
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,860
OK the kitchen was in here.

1742
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:22,120
To get out this time, you'll have to make my favorite recipe.

1743
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:23,960
That's fun!

1744
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,220
Shrinking soup.

1745
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:31,900
First, fill my kitchen with ingredients by playing I Spy Riddles and games.

1746
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,420
OK.

1747
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,400
Shrinking soup makes one serving.

1748
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,860
Shrinking soup makes one serving.

1749
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,120
All clues completed.

1750
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,120
Skeleton meated.

1751
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,200
Window yeeted.

1752
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:51,960
I have a ghost question.

1753
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,620
Is it possible for the same person to have a ghost and a zombie of themselves at the same time?

1754
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:01,630
Yes.

1755
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:05,550
OK let's go do I Spy Puzzles baby!

1756
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:07,270
Back to the clock!

1757
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:12,990
Mickey!

1758
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,050
Off the clock.

1759
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:26,650
OK guys.

1760
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:28,650
All right we got this.

1761
01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:34,630
I wish that we could pick Mickey.

1762
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:36,170
OK tick.

1763
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:36,970
I saw it earlier.

1764
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:37,250
Oh here.

1765
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:45,910
We got this so easy now because...

1766
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:46,610
Oh my god!

1767
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,150
We've memorized.

1768
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,170
We've memorized these maps.

1769
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:54,470
We're geniuses now.

1770
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:55,710
A pen.

1771
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:56,370
A ten!

1772
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:00,790
An apple core.

1773
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:02,650
OK I don't know where that is.

1774
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:08,030
I've been vodging recently but glad I could catch the stream live.

1775
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:09,930
Selfos thank you!

1776
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,170
It's my birthday tomorrow.

1777
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:13,330
Let me sing you!

1778
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:17,790
Happy birthday to you!

1779
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:20,950
Happy birthday to you!

1780
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:25,090
Happy birthday dear Selfos!

1781
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:28,870
Happy birthday to you!

1782
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:31,950
Happy birthday!

1783
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,530
An apple core.

1784
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:37,470
An apple core.

1785
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:40,010
Tick tock.

1786
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,930
Tick tock.

1787
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:42,470
Tick tock.

1788
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,010
Sticks for six.

1789
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,210
I don't know what that means though.

1790
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,010
And a teapot.

1791
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,410
A teapot.

1792
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:48,730
A teapot.

1793
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:51,870
OK I said we were going to be really fast with this but I think I'm just...

1794
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:52,990
Oh there it is.

1795
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:55,990
A teapot.

1796
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:58,070
What does sticks for six mean?

1797
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,930
Oh!

1798
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:04,150
Sticks for six.

1799
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:05,630
Sticks for six.

1800
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,740
Very good everybody.

1801
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:15,360
Aha!

1802
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,880
The kitchen game has begun.

1803
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:21,120
I'm giving you ingredient number one.

1804
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:21,900
Oh my gosh!

1805
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,940
We got an apple!

1806
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,380
An apple-e-ple.

1807
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:27,640
OK awesome.

1808
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,300
Two... Do you think he's going to be there on the plate again?

1809
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,060
I spot two red bugs.

1810
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,200
A dime.

1811
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,700
Five flies.

1812
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:39,820
An ear.

1813
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:42,660
I don't have time for you to explain.

1814
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:43,740
A dime.

1815
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,200
Red bug one.

1816
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,820
One red bug.

1817
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:50,000
Two red bug.

1818
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,100
Two red bugs.

1819
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,660
Two red bugs.

1820
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,500
Five flies.

1821
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,580
OK that's way too many flies.

1822
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:01,860
One fly.

1823
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,080
Two flies.

1824
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,080
Three flies.

1825
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,700
Four flies.

1826
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,160
Five flies.

1827
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,700
Five flies at dinner.

1828
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:19,940
An ear.

1829
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,400
An ear.

1830
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:23,820
An ear.

1831
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,180
Saw teeth.

1832
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,380
Saw teeth.

1833
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,520
One brown eye.

1834
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,420
One dark brown eye.

1835
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:39,360
One dark brown... Two dark brown eyes?

1836
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,620
What's the other brown eye?

1837
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,140
It's not the snake?

1838
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:44,800
No it's green.

1839
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,360
What's that?

1840
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,900
Oh my gosh I'm covering it.

1841
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:48,260
I'm sorry.

1842
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,900
There is an eye on the table.

1843
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,520
Three aces.

1844
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,980
Two dark brown eyes.

1845
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,120
Hey there Minky.

1846
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,400
Have you ever heard of Minky Momo?

1847
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,960
The toy company that was funding the show pulled out.

1848
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:05,420
So the animators ended the show by having Minky get hit by a truck.

1849
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,060
The show literally ends with their funeral.

1850
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:08,560
What?

1851
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,180
Hold on.

1852
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,960
I'm looking at Minky Momo right now.

1853
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,840
Minky Momo.

1854
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:16,960
No way.

1855
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,220
I know this show.

1856
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,240
I never finish it.

1857
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:24,960
No way.

1858
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,320
That's how it ends?

1859
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,330
No way.

1860
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:35,890
Minky Momo.

1861
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:37,890
Spoilers.

1862
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:44,170
Spoilers to this show that's like... from the 80s.

1863
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:45,770
A pearl from above.

1864
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:48,430
I don't know what above means.

1865
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,630
A pearl from above.

1866
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:51,610
What do you mean by that?

1867
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:52,830
It's just a regular pearl.

1868
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,350
An empty plate.

1869
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:58,150
An empty plate.

1870
01:33:58,290 --> 01:33:58,750
A bone.

1871
01:33:59,370 --> 01:33:59,630
No.

1872
01:33:59,790 --> 01:33:59,930
No.

1873
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:01,470
No.

1874
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,470
An empty plate.

1875
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:07,450
A bone.

1876
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:09,570
A bee.

1877
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:13,910
Look at him wiggle.

1878
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,090
A bee.

1879
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,690
And an animal ate?

1880
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:20,610
That's fun.

1881
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:22,550
An animal ate.

1882
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,670
He ate.

1883
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,760
Thank you for that little lore about...

1884
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,880
About the Minky Momo though.

1885
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,140
What is that?

1886
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:40,100
Frog legs?

1887
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:47,100
I want to watch it now.

1888
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,260
Minky Momo is like famously cursed.

1889
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,820
The final episode where she gets hit by the truck aired right before a huge earthquake in Japan.

1890
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,860
Minky Momo.

1891
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:05,680
A cat.

1892
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:17,860
What if it said like some grippers.

1893
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:20,720
Wait.

1894
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,460
I thought it had five toes for a second.

1895
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:25,000
Two P's.

1896
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,540
There is one.

1897
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:26,940
Two.

1898
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,900
One P. No.

1899
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:32,160
No.

1900
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:33,160
Say what it is.

1901
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:36,900
It's a P. A second P. Two P's.

1902
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:40,520
No.

1903
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:40,740
No.

1904
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,420
Don't say a letter P. Just say P. Two P's.

1905
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,100
P. A pair of pink ears.

1906
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,160
I think it's this little guy.

1907
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,720
Oh my ears.

1908
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,020
For the domino I'm blocking it so I'm really sorry.

1909
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,200
A footprint.

1910
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,420
Oh the grippers.

1911
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,080
Oh my god look at those toes.

1912
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,560
A cat.

1913
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,240
That's not a footprint though.

1914
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,200
Oh there is a cat.

1915
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,980
So cute.

1916
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,400
A set of old gears.

1917
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,000
Oh here.

1918
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,840
Right behind chat.

1919
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:19,660
Nice guys.

1920
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,320
Nice going.

1921
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,980
A bottle and a trumpet.

1922
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,380
My ears!

1923
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:27,700
A hole.

1924
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,740
A hole where the 7th button will go.

1925
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,580
The audio in this is not very consistent.

1926
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,260
I'm sorry.

1927
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,760
We are guarding the metal gears.

1928
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,400
It's an egg!

1929
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,660
Yeah actually.

1930
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:53,980
What's wrong with it?

1931
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,240
It's just an egg.

1932
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,660
The other ones were like this one is bugs.

1933
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,100
This one is frog legs.

1934
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,860
But this one is an egg.

1935
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:06,880
Would you still eat it?

1936
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,880
The mysterious and spooky egg.

1937
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:15,360
Oh.

1938
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:27,260
Toopies!

1939
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:30,200
Thanks for the super chat.

1940
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,600
I spy my name!

1941
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,000
What sound effect do you think my name will give?

1942
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,960
I think it will give something kind of like bossa nova.

1943
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,420
Your name.

1944
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:07,400
I spy a star.

1945
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,520
I spy with my little eye.

1946
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,600
Oh no, that's a king.

1947
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:14,560
A jack.

1948
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,240
Jack.

1949
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,200
I don't see a jack.

1950
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,300
Oh wait, is this a jack?

1951
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:25,760
A jack.

1952
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:28,040
Oh, what are these things?

1953
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:29,780
This is a jack?

1954
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:31,600
I think I saw it.

1955
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:32,940
It said it earlier, right?

1956
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:37,220
I think because of the cards I was thinking like a jack card.

1957
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,600
Jacks like the game.

1958
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,580
I've never played it.

1959
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:41,100
A bent paper clip.

1960
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,020
Oh here.

1961
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,060
A bent paper clip.

1962
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,320
Toy for grand people.

1963
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,220
Konami should make a super prequel to MGS.

1964
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,780
Should be called Wooden Gear in future Action Snakes.

1965
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,360
Trying to thwart cavemen inventing the wheel.

1966
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,560
Truly, Metal Gear started...

1967
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:06,640
At the beginning.

1968
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,420
I'm blocking the star by the way, sorry.

1969
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:10,840
A star.

1970
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,880
Truly, Metal Gear started with the cave people.

1971
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,560
A lens with a crack.

1972
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,380
A lens with a crack.

1973
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:20,360
Oopsie.

1974
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,200
Skelly face.

1975
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:25,440
A skeleton face.

1976
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,160
A frog.

1977
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,420
A frog.

1978
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,680
A 2.

1979
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:33,780
A 2, 2, 2.

1980
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,140
I see a 3.

1981
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:36,820
I see a K.

1982
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,520
I see an Ace.

1983
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,660
I see a 4, 1, 5.

1984
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:41,840
I see a 9.

1985
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:42,820
I see a 6.

1986
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:43,760
Or a 9.

1987
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,000
2.

1988
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,720
Do you guys see a 2?

1989
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:49,680
A 2.

1990
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,140
A 2.

1991
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:52,740
A 2.

1992
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,300
A 2.

1993
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:57,400
Do you guys see it?

1994
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,600
The 2.

1995
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,400
Do you guys see a 2?

1996
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,000
A 2.

1997
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,940
Let's do a key and a lock.

1998
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,460
Where is that one?

1999
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:07,640
Here.

2000
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,560
A key and a lock.

2001
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,060
A paper shoe?

2002
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,220
What is a paper shoe?

2003
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:20,380
Oh!

2004
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:23,100
A shoe that is actually paper.

2005
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:24,760
Paper shoe.

2006
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,960
A 2?

2007
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,360
Do you guys see a 2?

2008
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,760
Is there a 2 on the pencil?

2009
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:31,880
No, it's a 9.

2010
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,540
A 2?

2011
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:35,340
A 2?

2012
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,400
You guys...

2013
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,920
A 2?

2014
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,960
I'm not blocking...Oh wait.

2015
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:48,640
It was on the dice.

2016
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:49,660
Oh my gosh.

2017
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,300
It was the 2 on the dice.

2018
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,720
I was blocking it.

2019
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,040
Sorry.

2020
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,520
Thank you.

2021
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,620
Oh what is that?

2022
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,040
Caterpillars.

2023
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:11,160
There is a character in Mobile Suit Gundam Z that has a character named Haman Karn.

2024
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:16,640
Who looks like an older Minky Momo, so me and my friends joke that Minky Momo got isekai in Gundam.

2025
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,720
There is a 10 in the bottom right corner.

2026
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,080
No, it's a 9.

2027
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,800
It's a 9 on the pencil.

2028
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:26,300
Alright, let's go into this room.

2029
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,260
We are speedrunning, but not really.

2030
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,340
We get to do this again.

2031
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:31,920
Holy moly!

2032
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:34,820
You got...Wait, what?

2033
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,080
Oh...

2034
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:43,020
What?

2035
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?

2036
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,460
8?

2037
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:49,820
6?

2038
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:51,780
1?

2039
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:56,460
Oh 10 because it's a dime?

2040
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:57,740
Oh my god.

2041
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:00,760
1...12

2042
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:13,580
But watch out, the objects match in a different way this time.

2043
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,120
A different way this time.

2044
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,500
What do they do?

2045
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,800
Okay, this is just similar things.

2046
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,100
Oh 6 seconds!

2047
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,760
Oh 6 seconds!

2048
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,080
A new record.

2049
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,100
Oh 6 seconds!

2050
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:36,180
Oh no, no, no, no!

2051
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:39,700
Why, what the hell is this one?

2052
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,020
2?

2053
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,320
Okay, 4...

2054
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,360
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11?

2055
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:46,840
3?

2056
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,400
2?

2057
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:49,560
Wait, 11?

2058
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,460
Wait, this is 11.

2059
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:56,380
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12!

2060
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:58,940
I can't count.

2061
01:42:59,320 --> 01:42:59,720
5?

2062
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:01,660
Okay, okay.

2063
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:05,360
Alright, the sun is 12.

2064
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,640
Yeah, 2 coins is 11.

2065
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,440
11...

2066
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:11,340
4...

2067
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,360
3...

2068
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,320
Oh 2, sorry.

2069
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:14,700
3...

2070
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:20,040
This one is too hard!

2071
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:22,720
A snake!

2072
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:27,040
Ingredient 5 sure is yummy.

2073
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:30,020
Can't wait to have soup in my tummy.

2074
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,340
Oh yeah, that snake is yummy.

2075
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,380
Look at the way he just cradled him away.

2076
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:39,580
You can keep playing Mystery Bins to find more matches.

2077
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,940
Okay, let's see.

2078
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,660
Is this...OK, Nickel?

2079
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:49,940
Hammer?

2080
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,040
Dog?

2081
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:52,500
Yo-Yo?

2082
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:53,580
Ant?

2083
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,040
What the hell is this one?

2084
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,440
Oh, Xylophone.

2085
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:59,900
Wait, Hammer?

2086
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,360
Lollipop?

2087
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,420
Wait, no!

2088
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:04,260
We are speedrunning!

2089
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,340
Get me out of here!

2090
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,500
It's fine, we don't care anymore.

2091
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,920
Wait, it's now a different thing.

2092
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:11,280
It's 7 instead of 4.

2093
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,540
Oh, it is a 4.

2094
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,360
Am I...?

2095
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,640
Guys, I sw...

2096
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,960
I don't know what...

2097
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,020
I think my eyes actually played...

2098
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:40,000
I saw it as a 7 and then I looked away and then I looked back and it's a 4!

2099
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:41,220
What the heck?

2100
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,120
I think my eyes are playing tricks on me.

2101
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,200
It's these glasses!

2102
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,460
They are not prescription!

2103
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,580
I spy Venus.

2104
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,480
A dog.

2105
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:49,800
Venus?

2106
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:50,500
A snake.

2107
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,900
A wi...

2108
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:54,880
A dog.

2109
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,200
Venus.

2110
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,520
Oh that's a raccoon.

2111
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,220
A dog.

2112
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,040
A snail.

2113
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,040
A snail.

2114
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:07,620
A wide open mouth.

2115
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,860
Sorry, I'm blocking it a little bit.

2116
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,340
A wide open mouth.

2117
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,120
A tree on a nail.

2118
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:17,260
I don't know.

2119
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,000
That was really weird though.

2120
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,200
That was actually so weird.

2121
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:20,680
1, 4?

2122
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:23,880
1, 4.

2123
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,180
2, 4.

2124
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,140
The glasses give you no tactical advantage.

2125
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:30,680
I know!

2126
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,680
2, 4s.

2127
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,100
That was actually so weird.

2128
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,260
1, bat.

2129
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:42,320
1, bat.

2130
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:43,980
2, bat.

2131
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,740
2, bats.

2132
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,420
3, bats.

2133
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:49,740
3,

2134
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,300
bats.

2135
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:55,220
4, 5 pointed stars.

2136
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:56,720
What?

2137
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:58,680
4 of them?

2138
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,980
1, 5 pointed star.

2139
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:00,620
Wait.

2140
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,440
4, 5.

2141
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:06,080
Oh, that's 6.

2142
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:06,620
Sorry.

2143
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,200
This one?

2144
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,020
2?

2145
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,140
2, 5 pointed stars.

2146
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:13,420
Oh here's one.

2147
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:14,220
Here's one.

2148
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:14,520
Here's one.

2149
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,120
3, 5 pointed stars.

2150
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,260
Where's the last one?

2151
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:22,080
You guys see it?

2152
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,780
Do you guys see the last one?

2153
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:27,900
Don't tell me.

2154
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:28,960
Let me find it.

2155
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,260
But do you see it?

2156
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:31,160
Tell me if you see it.

2157
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:31,800
You see it?

2158
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,260
You see it?

2159
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:34,320
Don't tell me where.

2160
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,000
Don't tell me where.

2161
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:37,660
Green Caterpillar.

2162
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,500
And then Bike Handlebars.

2163
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,580
OK we got that one.

2164
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:44,980
Bike Handlebars.

2165
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,700
Green Caterpillar.

2166
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,520
Green Caterpillar.

2167
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,200
What?

2168
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:19,110
What did the Foley artist have to use to create that sound?

2169
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,470
I truly wonder.

2170
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:26,070
Also the Skelly's hand, I wish I could show you it right now because it looks mega fucked.

2171
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:27,930
Hunter, thanks for the super chat!

2172
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:30,230
I see the star.

2173
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,850
I found it.

2174
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:34,390
I found it.

2175
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:34,870
I found it.

2176
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:37,110
4, 5 pointed stars.

2177
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,400
Ask Doobie.

2178
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,320
Yeah, I know right?

2179
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,500
Since you did Foley stuff.

2180
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,340
He just gave me some milk.

2181
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,360
Alright,

2182
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,520
now we have the fireplace.

2183
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,660
Two arrows.

2184
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:03,980
One!

2185
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:06,100
One arrow.

2186
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:07,180
One arrow.

2187
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:07,320
One arrow.

2188
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:12,780
Two arrows.

2189
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,380
The number 4 and definitely not a 7.

2190
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,720
The number 4.

2191
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:19,980
The number 4.

2192
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,120
Fresh wood on a fire.

2193
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,820
Oh fresh wood.

2194
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,600
Fresh wood.

2195
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:27,320
Fresh?

2196
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:28,580
A bat.

2197
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:29,700
I saw it.

2198
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:30,320
I just...oh here.

2199
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,240
I'm enjoying your stream so far on my days off.

2200
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:33,560
A bat.

2201
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,000
And they are ad free which is a plus.

2202
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:35,800
Oh, sorry.

2203
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:36,900
Do I need to insert an ad?

2204
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,080
GamerSupps Code Boomer.

2205
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,640
10% off your order.

2206
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:48,420
Right now I'm drinking GamerSupps Black Cherry.

2207
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:55,600
All proceeds, well not all, 10%, wait.

2208
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:58,360
Some proceeds go to Minto.

2209
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:00,640
Code Boomer.

2210
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:06,790
Birthday!

2211
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:11,490
Sorry, it's tomorrow.

2212
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:12,370
OK.

2213
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:15,490
Happy birthday to you.

2214
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:18,510
Happy birthday to you.

2215
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,370
Happy birthday Rudabrand...

2216
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:23,350
Rudabrand...

2217
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:29,050
Happy birthday to you.

2218
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:32,490
Birthday!

2219
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:34,910
Oh yeah, also another ad.

2220
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:36,170
In between ads.

2221
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:38,510
Sorry, since you requested more ads.

2222
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:40,570
Phantom Thief concert.

2223
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:42,970
December 14th.

2224
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:47,230
At the Tabernacle in Atlanta, Georgia.

2225
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:51,570
Tickets are still on sale.

2226
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:55,630
Doobie's a guest.

2227
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:58,890
Oh, it's me and Doki in 3D.

2228
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:01,130
Our first ever 3D concert.

2229
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:01,870
Yeah!

2230
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:05,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2231
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:06,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2232
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:12,810
So, it's during the same time as a convention.

2233
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:14,310
That's happening there.

2234
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:16,930
But we're not associated with the convention.

2235
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:19,170
It's just a coinkidinkle.

2236
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:21,610
And it is not during the Hololive concert.

2237
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:28,490
We made sure of that while we were planning the dates.

2238
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:30,590
Yes.

2239
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,350
A nail that might fall.

2240
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:38,810
A nail that might fall.

2241
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:39,810
No, it fell.

2242
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:41,230
Letter E.

2243
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:43,270
And E.

2244
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:45,610
A nail in the wall.

2245
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:51,170
A nail in the wall.

2246
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:52,250
Halo has a concert too?

2247
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:52,630
Yeah.

2248
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:57,650
So, it's a very packed weekend, I'd say.

2249
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:58,910
Yes, yes, yes.

2250
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,770
A cracked door.

2251
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:03,310
A cracked open door.

2252
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:06,570
Guys, this king has no eyes.

2253
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:07,130
Freaky.

2254
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:08,690
Also, a car.

2255
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:10,590
Okay, we gotta lock in, guys.

2256
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:11,610
We gotta get through these.

2257
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:13,890
A car, a car, a car, a car.

2258
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:16,070
Oh my gosh, a moose.

2259
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,570
Also, fresh wood on the fire.

2260
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:19,490
But this isn't...

2261
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:20,350
Oh, there's the car!

2262
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:21,730
Oh my gosh, this is cute!

2263
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:23,310
A car.

2264
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,790
A car.

2265
01:51:24,930 --> 01:51:25,850
And an R.

2266
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:27,970
R.

2267
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:30,250
Oh my gosh, there's another snake.

2268
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:33,350
Fresh wood on the fire.

2269
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:35,710
And an R.

2270
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:39,230
Oh, these ones are tripping me up, you guys.

2271
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:41,410
And a cracked open door.

2272
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:43,870
Wait, is this the door?

2273
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:47,570
A cracked open door.

2274
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:50,430
Oh my gosh, I didn't even realize that was a door!

2275
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:51,890
That's crazy.

2276
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:52,690
Oh, here's the wood.

2277
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:54,450
That's cute!

2278
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,430
Fresh wood on the fire.

2279
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:01,490
And an R.

2280
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:03,710
Is it the pirate saying R?

2281
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:04,790
No.

2282
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:06,210
There's the R!

2283
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:09,490
These ones were pretty tricky.

2284
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,690
My cursor stopped working.

2285
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:17,410
Oh my gosh, Nikki.

2286
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:19,550
Reset your computer.

2287
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:25,330
What is that?

2288
01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:26,390
Hot sauce or ketchup?

2289
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:28,330
The cat is so cute.

2290
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:30,390
Beer?

2291
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:32,330
No, skeletons can't.

2292
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:39,030
Streamly reminder that you can buy used offshore oil rigs.

2293
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:40,230
They auction them off.

2294
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:41,170
Stop.

2295
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:42,430
Stop tempting me.

2296
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:43,970
Stop tempting me.

2297
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:46,550
OK, I think we finished downstairs, so...

2298
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:50,850
Hold on, let's go check out the kitchen and see how much ingredients we've got.

2299
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:53,470
Milk?

2300
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:53,630
Milk?

2301
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:57,870
Hot sauce?

2302
01:52:58,390 --> 01:52:59,590
Snake in a jar?

2303
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:03,900
Apple?

2304
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:05,300
Fly?

2305
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:06,640
Froggy legs?

2306
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,720
Shrinking soup.

2307
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:12,440
Makes one serving.

2308
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,980
Upstairs we go.

2309
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:19,800
That is not milk.

2310
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:20,320
I agree.

2311
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:21,680
Let's do this one first.

2312
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:25,940
Wait.

2313
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:26,780
Oh my god.

2314
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,380
They don't even explain.

2315
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,300
They are like, you know the rules.

2316
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,300
Oh my god.

2317
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:32,320
They are just like, start.

2318
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,300
Oh my god.

2319
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,480
Oh my god.

2320
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:38,060
Please give me what I need.

2321
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,320
Give me what I need.

2322
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:39,980
Yes!

2323
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:40,600
Yes!

2324
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,240
Oh that's a sexy hand there.

2325
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:44,600
Come on!

2326
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,080
Yeah!

2327
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,300
Baby hand!

2328
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:52,180
I bet Mint also passed Snake in a jar.

2329
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:57,360
And I'll have a reward for you.

2330
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:00,560
Ok.

2331
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:02,220
I'm ready.

2332
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,020
I'm ready.

2333
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:04,740
I'm ready.

2334
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:05,720
I'm ready.

2335
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,700
Come on!

2336
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,580
Give me what I need.

2337
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,740
Give me what I need.

2338
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,120
Yeah!

2339
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,120
Give me what I need.

2340
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:15,020
Oh that was one!

2341
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:15,520
Oh my gosh.

2342
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:18,500
I thought that one was already done.

2343
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,060
Like already clicked on.

2344
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:22,020
Yeah!

2345
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,380
20 seconds!

2346
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,620
Deny it?

2347
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:28,880
Oh.

2348
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:32,240
No, but I do have Snake in a jar.

2349
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:39,770
Game?

2350
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:43,760
Game?

2351
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:54,200
Game?

2352
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,980
I think my game crashed.

2353
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,080
No!

2354
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:05,520
No!

2355
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:06,160
No!

2356
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:21,290
It was like... It said... It said your best is too fast.

2357
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:23,490
There is no way you are a child.

2358
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:26,030
This game is only for children.

2359
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:29,210
No way.

2360
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:29,650
No!

2361
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:33,950
Hold on.

2362
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:34,950
Let me click out of it.

2363
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:36,250
Oh here maybe.

2364
01:55:37,570 --> 01:55:37,870
Ok.

2365
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:38,610
Hold on.

2366
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:39,990
Ok.

2367
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:58,350
Ok, I'm leaving.

2368
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:58,890
Hold on.

2369
01:55:59,470 --> 01:56:00,110
Let's try this.

2370
01:56:03,650 --> 01:56:04,590
I'm gonna leave.

2371
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:06,410
We'll come back to that later.

2372
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:19,910
Oh no!

2373
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:21,930
As soon as I do anything...

2374
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,240
Ok, let me try restarting the game.

2375
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:34,220
Do you want to stop playing?

2376
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:34,580
Yes.

2377
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:37,900
Ok, let's try again.

2378
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:38,960
Hopefully it's saved.

2379
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:43,380
Oh no!

2380
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,740
Anti-cheat maybe.

2381
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:55,850
Alright Big Fish.

2382
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:59,370
I might demand a refund if this doesn't work for me please.

2383
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:03,690
I'm Mickey!

2384
01:57:07,390 --> 01:57:08,570
You've come back again.

2385
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:14,130
There is really no doubt that you want to keep going and find your way out.

2386
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:14,890
It's true!

2387
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:19,250
Ok, let's see if it kept all our stuff.

2388
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:22,610
Ok!

2389
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:23,430
Ok.

2390
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:25,350
Maybe we are fine.

2391
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:26,370
Maybe we are ok.

2392
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:28,190
Maybe we are ok.

2393
01:57:28,990 --> 01:57:30,610
Let's go to this room first.

2394
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:33,930
Look!

2395
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:35,190
We can go to his room.

2396
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:38,650
I spy a stamp.

2397
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:40,270
The second floor.

2398
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:41,990
An open window.

2399
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:42,650
Second floor.

2400
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:46,230
The second floor.

2401
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:46,970
A stamp.

2402
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:49,970
A stamp.

2403
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:51,170
An open window.

2404
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:53,510
An open window.

2405
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:54,310
Not anymore.

2406
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:55,210
A desk drawer.

2407
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:57,230
A desk drawer.

2408
01:57:57,370 --> 01:57:58,330
A broken clock.

2409
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:02,590
A broken clock.

2410
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:03,510
My ears!

2411
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:05,170
Three birds.

2412
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:07,050
Three birds.

2413
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,450
Three...

2414
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:10,630
Don't tell me...

2415
01:58:12,110 --> 01:58:13,230
That's a penguin.

2416
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:14,830
I mean I guess it's...

2417
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:17,970
I guess?

2418
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:18,930
Does that count?

2419
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,640
It's a bird?

2420
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:24,900
Does that really count though?

2421
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:27,000
A penguin is a bird.

2422
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,080
It doesn't count.

2423
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,000
A feather pen.

2424
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,820
Get out!

2425
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:39,820
A feather pen.

2426
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:40,320
Oh my god!

2427
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,420
He's cursing us!

2428
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,280
Cheese in a trap.

2429
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,540
Cheese in a trap.

2430
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:47,500
Oh my gosh!

2431
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:49,260
Do you see this ghost right here?

2432
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:52,400
That's such a good one!

2433
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:55,500
Guys, a ten.

2434
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:59,300
We need a ten and we need...

2435
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,840
Two more birds.

2436
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:02,740
Oh here's a bird.

2437
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,960
Oh I see the ten!

2438
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:11,760
One more bird.

2439
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:13,820
What if it was a middle finger?

2440
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:15,300
Oh here!

2441
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,040
Is the ten at the bottom right?

2442
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:19,880
No it's not.

2443
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:22,900
Three birds.

2444
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,220
That one was tricky.

2445
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:38,070
Easy.

2446
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:39,690
Game.

2447
01:59:40,650 --> 01:59:41,950
Oh wait, they didn't...

2448
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:46,850
Ok, for some reason I thought they rhymed great or eight with eight.

2449
01:59:47,390 --> 01:59:47,670
No.

2450
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:50,570
Ok, great with eight.

2451
01:59:50,670 --> 01:59:51,310
Ok, I get it.

2452
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:51,950
Yeah, ok.

2453
01:59:55,570 --> 01:59:56,690
A bell!

2454
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:58,730
Bing bong.

2455
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:00,510
He's pointing at me again.

2456
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:01,910
He's pointing at me again.

2457
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:03,210
Two nails.

2458
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:04,070
Two nails.

2459
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:04,970
Two nails.

2460
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:05,710
Two nails.

2461
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:07,430
One nail.

2462
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:11,790
Single nail.

2463
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:12,470
A Y.

2464
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,090
Y, Y, Y, Y, Y.

2465
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,790
Skeet on study.

2466
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,950
What does that mean though?

2467
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:19,490
Skeet on study.

2468
02:00:21,210 --> 02:00:22,850
What does that mean?

2469
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:25,270
A spider.

2470
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:27,390
A spider.

2471
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:30,990
A fly, a fly, a fly, a fly.

2472
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,250
Fly.

2473
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:36,150
A fly.

2474
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,060
It's a skeleton?

2475
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:44,560
No it's not.

2476
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:47,240
Ske...

2477
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:48,540
Arrow

2478
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:07,440
that points to the skeleton's study.

2479
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:15,960
A green boot that's muddy.

2480
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:23,410
How to haunt.

2481
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:24,650
An open book.

2482
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:27,370
I probably wrote that one just like that other book.

2483
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:29,950
I'm a published author after all.

2484
02:01:30,850 --> 02:01:32,570
A dinosaur tail?

2485
02:01:33,130 --> 02:01:33,730
Oh here.

2486
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:35,410
How cute!

2487
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:38,670
A dinosaur tail.

2488
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:39,690
I see the second nail.

2489
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:45,830
Skeet on study.

2490
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:46,870
Two nails.

2491
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:48,850
Skeet on study everybody!

2492
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:49,110
Everybody!

2493
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:56,360
What is that?

2494
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,580
What is that?

2495
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,200
Skeet on study.

2496
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,240
Okay we gotta do this one now.

2497
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:09,940
This one's fun.

2498
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:12,660
Scream!

2499
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:17,180
Scream!

2500
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:18,240
Scream!

2501
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,240
A skull.

2502
02:02:26,730 --> 02:02:27,590
A skull.

2503
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:31,050
Skeet on study.

2504
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,230
That's what Corey would have done.

2505
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:33,490
I hope Corey is okay.

2506
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:36,610
A three.

2507
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:41,590
A three.

2508
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:42,930
A fly.

2509
02:02:43,730 --> 02:02:44,510
He's behind my head.

2510
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:46,810
Nasty fella.

2511
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:48,090
A fly.

2512
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:49,550
A frown.

2513
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,690
Does this count as a frown?

2514
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:56,150
A frown.

2515
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:57,230
Looks like my uncle.

2516
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:59,350
A leafless tree.

2517
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:02,470
A leafless tree.

2518
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:06,050
A broken wing.

2519
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:07,170
That's so sad.

2520
02:03:09,930 --> 02:03:11,690
A broken wing.

2521
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:13,210
They make it sound so happy though.

2522
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:16,610
Let's see.

2523
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:17,610
A yellow beak.

2524
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:19,050
That's not yellow.

2525
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:20,470
Oh here!

2526
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:24,610
A yellow beak.

2527
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:27,930
And a butterfly eek.

2528
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:30,030
I saw the eek before.

2529
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:30,410
Oh here.

2530
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:34,070
A butterfly eek.

2531
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:38,670
Now we just need an iron gate.

2532
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:41,110
Iron gate.

2533
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:44,010
Oh wait!

2534
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:45,470
Oh it's in all caps.

2535
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:46,890
So it's this place.

2536
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:50,350
Iron gate.

2537
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:01,520
Yay!

2538
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:02,140
Eyeballs!

2539
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,980
Okay, finish this room.

2540
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:22,840
Nice We'll save that one for last.

2541
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:24,080
Possibly.

2542
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:25,680
I'm terrified.

2543
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:28,260
Go in here now.

2544
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,680
One pencil is behind me.

2545
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:40,680
Another pencil is...

2546
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:43,440
here.

2547
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:46,320
Are you sure you didn't voice this game?

2548
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:49,500
Does it really sound like pencils?

2549
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:50,920
Two pencils.

2550
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:51,980
A hand!

2551
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:54,520
A hand.

2552
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,760
Let me give you a hand.

2553
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:01,760
A little bit.

2554
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,980
If you try...

2555
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,680
Three doors.

2556
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:11,060
One?

2557
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,360
Oh my god.

2558
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,980
One door.

2559
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,140
One door?

2560
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:19,900
Two doors?

2561
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:21,780
Oh my gosh!

2562
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:23,280
That's so good!

2563
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:27,960
Because the mirror spun around last time and then it contributes to...

2564
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:28,620
The third door.

2565
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:30,900
And it contributes to the puzzle this time.

2566
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:32,080
That's so fun.

2567
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,900
A bug on the wall.

2568
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:39,940
A bug on the wall.

2569
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:41,500
A name that is yours!

2570
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:43,700
What's it going to sound like?

2571
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,260
What's it going to sound like?

2572
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:49,920
A name that is yours.

2573
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:53,780
A comb.

2574
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,860
A comb.

2575
02:05:59,320 --> 02:05:59,720
A six.

2576
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:01,360
And this one was a nine before.

2577
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,740
Now it's a six.

2578
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:05,240
A six?

2579
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:06,060
Ouch.

2580
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:06,740
A rose.

2581
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:11,540
A single red rose.

2582
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:13,160
A little bathtub.

2583
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,540
Does this count as little?

2584
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,980
Oh my god.

2585
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:18,160
A little bathtub.

2586
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:19,240
I guess so.

2587
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:20,840
And a wallpaper nose.

2588
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:21,520
This is so cute.

2589
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:22,920
Like there is a snail here.

2590
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:26,340
A wallpaper nose.

2591
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,960
What is that?

2592
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:43,400
Eleventh.

2593
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,040
Guys are killing it.

2594
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:46,960
We are definitely speedrunning here.

2595
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:49,660
Alright, let's go into the closet.

2596
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:51,120
Oh the creepy dolls.

2597
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:57,380
Everything is staring at me.

2598
02:06:58,960 --> 02:06:59,600
Cool.

2599
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:03,580
You guys got lucky because it was hidden by chat.

2600
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:05,100
I mean it was my birthday today.

2601
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:05,760
Castillo!

2602
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:06,780
Happy birthday!

2603
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:11,840
Happy birthday to you.

2604
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:14,740
Happy birthday to you.

2605
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:17,600
Happy birthday dear Castillo.

2606
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:23,260
Happy birthday to you.

2607
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,660
Happy birthday!

2608
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:28,900
A jack.

2609
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:30,540
Oh this thing.

2610
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,680
A jack.

2611
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,240
Two horns.

2612
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:39,700
One horn?

2613
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:42,700
I see the second one.

2614
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,260
It's pretty tricky.

2615
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,360
Dark seed.

2616
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:51,460
Two horns.

2617
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:52,980
Voice acting.

2618
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:53,620
What does that mean?

2619
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:54,620
Voice acting.

2620
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:55,840
Eyeglasses.

2621
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:58,720
Oh sorry.

2622
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,160
Actually I had to click.

2623
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,420
There is a bear behind me.

2624
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:05,760
You guys can't really see but it's funny because I'm also wearing glasses today.

2625
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:07,880
I'm awesome.

2626
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,400
A nose that is blue.

2627
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:13,540
A nose that is blue.

2628
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:15,120
Three cats in a row.

2629
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,400
So cute!

2630
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:22,820
Three cats in a row.

2631
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:26,400
I remember playing the pirate version of I Spy.

2632
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:29,160
I prefer that over the...

2633
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:31,440
Ok, well nobody asked you.

2634
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:37,200
Ok, I like this one better.

2635
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:39,580
That's your opinion.

2636
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:44,560
If you like the pirate one, go play that one then.

2637
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:47,440
This is the only one I played.

2638
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:49,180
What is that?

2639
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:55,120
That sounds like a weenie whisper right there you guys.

2640
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,760
They are like this game is too scary.

2641
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,680
Other versions of Dark Seed don't have voice acting.

2642
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:07,300
I see, I see.

2643
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,480
I'll look into it.

2644
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,380
Everyone is a critic.

2645
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:15,640
So true.

2646
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:16,500
A top hat.

2647
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,780
Everyone is a critic man.

2648
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:20,640
A top hat.

2649
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:22,580
A top.

2650
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:26,740
A top.

2651
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:28,220
And a fly on a head.

2652
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:29,480
That's more like a face.

2653
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:31,680
I mean it's technically the head but...

2654
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:35,700
Oh no!

2655
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:36,840
Get off the cat!

2656
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:38,300
Awful!

2657
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,380
When you ask for a hint, I wonder how big of a hint it gives you, you know?

2658
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,320
Like does it tell you exactly?

2659
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:49,800
Let's try it next time.

2660
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:54,640
Soup!

2661
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,380
Wait, if we are making shrinking soup...

2662
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:06,400
There is one... Do I have to play this a third time?

2663
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:10,500
Because there is one ending I remember distinctly.

2664
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,880
And you don't... Wait, maybe you don't.

2665
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:13,280
I don't know.

2666
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:20,520
I see the crow.

2667
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:22,440
And me.

2668
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,780
This is my...

2669
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:27,540
Guys, this is my author debut.

2670
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:28,900
A tail.

2671
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:30,880
A tail.

2672
02:10:35,610 --> 02:10:36,130
Croaky.

2673
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:37,910
Three stars in a row.

2674
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:44,190
Wait, we already did the moon.

2675
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:45,310
Oh it's in all caps.

2676
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:45,610
Moon.

2677
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:49,750
A light switch.

2678
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:52,090
We are speedrunning this for real.

2679
02:10:52,410 --> 02:10:52,910
Kind of.

2680
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:53,690
Well, sometimes.

2681
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:54,070
Oh here.

2682
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:55,510
Oh no!

2683
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:57,110
Turn it off!

2684
02:10:57,770 --> 02:10:58,210
No!

2685
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:01,050
This poor guy, he's trying to sleep.

2686
02:11:01,170 --> 02:11:01,970
My name!

2687
02:11:08,490 --> 02:11:09,370
One bell?

2688
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:14,070
Welcome to membership Omni!

2689
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:15,250
Thank you!

2690
02:11:15,890 --> 02:11:16,850
An open pin.

2691
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:20,830
An open pin.

2692
02:11:20,850 --> 02:11:21,850
This is so rude.

2693
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:24,490
Why did we do this to poor little mouse?

2694
02:11:25,590 --> 02:11:26,610
So sad.

2695
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:32,550
Two nines.

2696
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:35,270
According to the AI you are playing Weenie Wisp Jr.

2697
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:44,530
Three nines.

2698
02:11:44,530 --> 02:11:45,250
Nice.

2699
02:11:45,450 --> 02:11:46,010
A nail.

2700
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:47,570
A nail, nail, nail.

2701
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,790
A nail.

2702
02:11:50,990 --> 02:11:52,590
And a bunny tucked in.

2703
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:54,790
There it is!

2704
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:56,050
Welcome to membership.

2705
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:56,690
Thank you!

2706
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:06,470
Cheese!

2707
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:11,830
Two!

2708
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:14,190
Two!

2709
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:19,110
Boobs!

2710
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:21,630
Alright.

2711
02:12:23,650 --> 02:12:25,170
Do we attempt this again?

2712
02:12:26,770 --> 02:12:27,510
Do you think it's fine?

2713
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:30,470
OK, it saved us.

2714
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:33,750
I think we are OK now guys.

2715
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:39,410
Oopsie.

2716
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,350
My bad.

2717
02:12:41,670 --> 02:12:41,950
What?

2718
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:42,370
What happened?

2719
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:43,070
Oh my God!

2720
02:12:43,230 --> 02:12:44,730
Why do I keep clicking on the butterflies?

2721
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:49,450
I'm thinking of butterflies this time.

2722
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:50,990
For some reason.

2723
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:52,450
I'm scared of this one though.

2724
02:12:52,530 --> 02:12:53,470
I just want to get out of it.

2725
02:12:54,010 --> 02:12:55,070
I don't want to do it anymore.

2726
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:56,170
So bye.

2727
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:02,150
Me throwing glasses is dangerously cute.

2728
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:06,270
Bug juice.

2729
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:09,830
Yippee!

2730
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:12,750
Yay!

2731
02:13:13,930 --> 02:13:14,790
OK, get me out of this.

2732
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:15,950
No.

2733
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:17,250
No, no, no, no.

2734
02:13:17,550 --> 02:13:18,350
No, no, no, no.

2735
02:13:18,610 --> 02:13:19,370
I don't want to.

2736
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:20,270
Get me out of here.

2737
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:21,030
Get me out of here.

2738
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:21,470
I'm scared.

2739
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:22,170
No.

2740
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:22,970
No.

2741
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:23,710
Let me out.

2742
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:25,170
My game is going to freeze.

2743
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:27,610
OK.

2744
02:13:29,130 --> 02:13:29,770
Two hangers.

2745
02:13:29,890 --> 02:13:30,350
One hanger.

2746
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:33,350
One hanger.

2747
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:34,470
One hanger.

2748
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:38,310
Tails of a cat.

2749
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:43,690
The tail of a cat.

2750
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:45,170
A face in a frame.

2751
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:46,370
Is this count?

2752
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:48,690
Is that the face in a frame?

2753
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:49,970
A face in a frame.

2754
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:51,870
A dusty top hat.

2755
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:53,750
We got to find the other hanger.

2756
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:53,990
Oh!

2757
02:13:57,170 --> 02:13:57,970
Two hangers.

2758
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:00,230
Dusty top hat.

2759
02:14:01,070 --> 02:14:01,990
Dusty top hat.

2760
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:02,690
Here!

2761
02:14:05,650 --> 02:14:07,130
A dusty top hat.

2762
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:07,950
I see the necklace.

2763
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:10,450
So good.

2764
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:11,590
You guys, we got this.

2765
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:12,290
We got this.

2766
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:12,850
We are speed running.

2767
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:13,290
Speed run.

2768
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:13,650
Speed run.

2769
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:16,190
You can't see the cat over there though.

2770
02:14:16,410 --> 02:14:17,010
Tip of a ski.

2771
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:20,410
I don't think you should be doing that.

2772
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:22,850
I don't think you should be doing that.

2773
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:26,330
Single earring.

2774
02:14:26,470 --> 02:14:27,250
Oh I saw it.

2775
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:27,970
There.

2776
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:32,370
A single earring.

2777
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:33,410
Do you guys see the sock?

2778
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,290
Sniff it out.

2779
02:14:34,790 --> 02:14:37,890
A loop in a string.

2780
02:14:39,350 --> 02:14:39,850
And a sock.

2781
02:14:40,130 --> 02:14:41,450
Sniff the sock out everybody.

2782
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:42,810
Sniff it out.

2783
02:14:43,450 --> 02:14:44,790
Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff.

2784
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:45,870
Smell the sock.

2785
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:47,230
Smell for it.

2786
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:49,170
I found it.

2787
02:14:50,650 --> 02:14:51,530
A sock.

2788
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:02,060
Please Minky, I'm not that freaky.

2789
02:15:02,620 --> 02:15:04,900
You will become that freaky though.

2790
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:06,700
Here's the last ingredient.

2791
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,400
Take a good look.

2792
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:10,120
Then go to the kitchen.

2793
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:11,860
You are ready to cook.

2794
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:13,100
We are ready to cook baby.

2795
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:14,160
Oh my gosh.

2796
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:14,640
We are cooking.

2797
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:15,100
We are cooking.

2798
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,780
I wonder if there is one more exit.

2799
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:22,280
Or one more time you have to play the game to get all the endings.

2800
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:23,420
Oh, to the kitchen.

2801
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:23,880
That's right.

2802
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:26,600
Let's cook.

2803
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:31,620
You found everything you need to make Shrinking Soup.

2804
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:32,660
Look at all the bug spices.

2805
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:37,520
Into the pot, six ingredients will go.

2806
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:41,660
First pour in four eyes, stacked in a row.

2807
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:42,580
Ok, I got it.

2808
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:44,660
Wait, only six?

2809
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:46,560
Then why did I get all this stuff?

2810
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:50,140
Mr. Carrier, thanks for two months.

2811
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,340
I'm rude and old.

2812
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:52,960
Welcome to Mavish.

2813
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:53,460
Thank you.

2814
02:15:57,620 --> 02:15:58,040
Spicy.

2815
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,660
Look to the left of the pickled snake.

2816
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:06,200
Take that red bottle and give it a shake.

2817
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:16,780
What the hell?

2818
02:16:16,940 --> 02:16:19,380
Now you must measure precisely.

2819
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:22,440
A one pound egg will do nicely.

2820
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:25,040
One pound egg?

2821
02:16:25,780 --> 02:16:26,580
What?

2822
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,160
How huge is this egg?

2823
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,360
I'm sorry, what?

2824
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:35,020
It's one pound?

2825
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:39,580
Oh, it's green.

2826
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:41,600
Did they just throw the...

2827
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:46,580
To give this soup shrinking power, sprinkle in a bit of flour.

2828
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:47,760
Flour.

2829
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:49,540
Oh, is this flour?

2830
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:53,180
Ew.

2831
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:54,620
Green eggs and ham?

2832
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:56,240
I do not like them Sam-I-Am.

2833
02:16:56,240 --> 02:17:01,660
Before the soup gets too cold, add a pinch of something old.

2834
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:06,520
Ok guys, I'll make the sacrifice.

2835
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:08,960
Put me in coach.

2836
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:10,440
Put me in.

2837
02:17:19,170 --> 02:17:20,750
I think it's this.

2838
02:17:22,050 --> 02:17:23,730
Oh it's actually mold.

2839
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:27,610
Ew, it was so gross.

2840
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:31,110
Why did we get the cheese and stuff?

2841
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:33,750
A bit of bug spice and the soup is complete.

2842
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:37,910
Add some caterpillar, nice and sweet.

2843
02:17:39,850 --> 02:17:40,530
Caterpillar.

2844
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:44,870
But Matara isn't here yet.

2845
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:49,510
Get the largest spoon to stir the soup.

2846
02:17:49,790 --> 02:17:52,950
Let it boil, then take a full scoop.

2847
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:54,490
We have to eat this?

2848
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:58,590
What was the point of the frog legs and everything then?

2849
02:17:59,750 --> 02:18:00,890
Here we go.

2850
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:01,730
Oh my gosh.

2851
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:05,130
Time to eat everybody.

2852
02:18:10,670 --> 02:18:14,250
Now go find a door that's fit for a mouse.

2853
02:18:14,730 --> 02:18:18,270
Then eat this shrinking soup to get out of the house.

2854
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,880
There's no door fit for a mouse here.

2855
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:31,000
I made the soup delicious for you now everybody.

2856
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:35,920
So it was right here, right?

2857
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:36,620
At the very beginning.

2858
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:39,140
Here we go!

2859
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:49,740
You've escaped my house again.

2860
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:52,560
Do you dare to come back in?

2861
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:55,660
There's still something you've never seen.

2862
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:59,030
The plans to fix my ghost machine.

2863
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,440
Ghost machine?

2864
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:11,620
There's so much replayability in this.

2865
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:13,640
You know this door is tightly sealed.

2866
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:16,540
A new way out must be revealed.

2867
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:24,040
The plans you need you'll find downstairs by my ghost machine that needs repairs.

2868
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:27,360
So this one?

2869
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:33,500
Here are the plans to fix my ghost machine.

2870
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:41,940
Solve I-Spy riddles and play games to earn the missing parts.

2871
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:44,680
One more time!

2872
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:46,140
Oh my God.

2873
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:47,920
We have to assemble.

2874
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:51,420
Alright guys, I think this is the last one though.

2875
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:54,380
Alright, let's do this.

2876
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:04,540
What is this one?

2877
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:05,120
Oh chalk.

2878
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:09,600
What is this?

2879
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:10,320
A nut cracker.

2880
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:11,840
Lock.

2881
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:13,700
Tennis.

2882
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:15,060
Baseball.

2883
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:15,820
Golf.

2884
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,440
What is that?

2885
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:20,060
Oh it's tooth.

2886
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:25,740
We got it.

2887
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:28,220
Finally finished watching all your ghost babble.

2888
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:28,940
It's 2AM.

2889
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:30,140
Oh, goodnight Chad!

2890
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,160
Thanks for watching!

2891
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,940
Alright, alright.

2892
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:41,740
How do they match?

2893
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:43,180
Oh no.

2894
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:43,940
No.

2895
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:44,780
Wait, what?

2896
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:48,300
Oh they rhyme!

2897
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:50,740
So tie with I...

2898
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:55,340
Wait.

2899
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:58,300
Hole?

2900
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:00,540
Dice?

2901
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:02,740
Die with...

2902
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:06,220
Hole.

2903
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,360
Hole.

2904
02:21:11,620 --> 02:21:12,840
Skate with eight.

2905
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:13,720
Oh yeah, yeah.

2906
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,360
Star with...

2907
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:17,740
Is there a jar?

2908
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:18,680
No.

2909
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,360
Star with...

2910
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:26,640
What?

2911
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,200
Dice with mice.

2912
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:30,660
Oh!

2913
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:31,880
I was thinking rat.

2914
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:32,480
Oh my gosh.

2915
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:32,680
OK.

2916
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:33,720
Dice, mice.

2917
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:34,720
We are just going to go for it.

2918
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:36,540
Eight, skate.

2919
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:38,280
Four door.

2920
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:39,960
Snail, nail.

2921
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:41,440
What was this one?

2922
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:45,540
Spoon, moon.

2923
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:48,460
Sun, one.

2924
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:53,420
Star, car.

2925
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:56,000
Book, hook.

2926
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:01,140
Chair, bear.

2927
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:03,000
Bat, cat.

2928
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:04,920
Key, tree.

2929
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:14,280
One more.

2930
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,880
Oh no, this was...

2931
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:23,320
Four.

2932
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:25,260
Where is it?

2933
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,780
What the hell?

2934
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:30,080
Oh my god, it's not even just numbers sometimes.

2935
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:31,460
Oh my gosh.

2936
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,320
Wait, this is so tricky.

2937
02:22:33,580 --> 02:22:33,980
What?

2938
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:35,200
No way!

2939
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:37,260
What?

2940
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,180
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

2941
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:41,800
Wait, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2942
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:44,040
Oh my gosh.

2943
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:47,980
6, but it's also...

2944
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:49,940
6, oh my gosh.

2945
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:51,700
4, there it is.

2946
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:53,640
6, wait.

2947
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:57,460
2, 2.

2948
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:59,900
5, 5.

2949
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:01,020
3, 3.

2950
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:02,500
1.

2951
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,580
Oh my gosh, how many are here?

2952
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:05,740
Probably 12, yeah.

2953
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:07,020
10.

2954
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:14,340
We are so good at this.

2955
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,420
It's 47.

2956
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:17,040
My best was 18.

2957
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:17,940
You know what, not bad.

2958
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:28,440
You are the cutest ghost girl alive.

2959
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:29,680
Fight me bro.

2960
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:32,680
Randevis, I'm dead.

2961
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:34,700
I'm not alive.

2962
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:37,680
I'm not... I'm dead.

2963
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:38,580
I'm a ghost.

2964
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:41,900
I'm a ghost.

2965
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:46,500
I spy three pins, a loose thread, a striped...

2966
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:47,580
Three pins.

2967
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:48,240
A pumpkin.

2968
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:48,780
A horseshoe.

2969
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,620
OK guys, speed run.

2970
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:52,660
Shovel.

2971
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:54,320
Shovel 1.

2972
02:23:55,340 --> 02:23:56,420
Shovel 2.

2973
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:57,320
One shovel.

2974
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,120
Shovel 2.

2975
02:23:58,980 --> 02:23:59,620
We are speed running.

2976
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:00,240
We are speed running.

2977
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:04,580
Two shovels.

2978
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:05,520
A ball.

2979
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:06,940
A ball?

2980
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:07,260
Oh.

2981
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:11,840
Your ghost form is alive.

2982
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,400
Your human form is long...well I guess that's true.

2983
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:15,020
B!

2984
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:19,140
Pin in the top left.

2985
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:20,740
Thank you!

2986
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:23,300
One pin.

2987
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:25,240
Two pins.

2988
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,980
Is this a...Oh this is a closed pin so it counts.

2989
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:30,840
Two pins.

2990
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:31,720
Also loose thread.

2991
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:33,560
A loose thread.

2992
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:35,740
We just...Raccoon!

2993
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:38,920
Oh my god!

2994
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:39,440
Snuffy!

2995
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:42,020
A striped raccoon.

2996
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,140
What's a pumpkin head?

2997
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:43,960
That's me!

2998
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:45,720
Oh my god!

2999
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:47,880
A pumpkin head.

3000
02:24:48,460 --> 02:24:49,000
A heart.

3001
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,780
A heart.

3002
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:52,140
A heart.

3003
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:53,960
The tree is pin.

3004
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:56,560
No, it doesn't count.

3005
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,000
Good thinking though.

3006
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:01,340
I think that's a nail.

3007
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:02,760
They don't really count it as a pin.

3008
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:04,700
And a fish.

3009
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:06,040
A fish.

3010
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,240
Fish.

3011
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:06,660
Fish.

3012
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:07,340
Fish.

3013
02:25:07,460 --> 02:25:07,460
Fish.

3014
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:07,740
Fish.

3015
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:07,820
Fish.

3016
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:10,120
Heart?

3017
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:10,780
That's right!

3018
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:12,200
I even pointed it out before.

3019
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,480
I was like oh look at the heart.

3020
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:15,940
A bird in a tree.

3021
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,340
A bird in a tree.

3022
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:22,260
A fish.

3023
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:26,740
We need one more pin and a fish.

3024
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:28,540
How are you a pumpkin?

3025
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:29,180
You are green.

3026
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,300
What are you talking about?

3027
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:31,900
Fish on top of the tree?

3028
02:25:31,900 --> 02:25:33,960
Oh, you're right!

3029
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:35,460
A fish.

3030
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:36,460
A fish.

3031
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:38,940
And three pins.

3032
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:39,960
One more pin.

3033
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:43,400
The bowling pin!

3034
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,640
Three pins.

3035
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:49,300
Yeah!

3036
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:50,680
Good job guys!

3037
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:51,900
Strike!

3038
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:59,580
We got a metal gear.

3039
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:00,740
Here's machine part two.

3040
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:03,400
I'll put it down in the workshop for you.

3041
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:07,080
One more.

3042
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:08,240
In here.

3043
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:11,680
I spy three snakes.

3044
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:13,680
A nail on the ground.

3045
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:14,760
A dime.

3046
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:15,380
Nail on the ground.

3047
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:16,040
Oh my gosh!

3048
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:17,820
That's the nail we made fall earlier.

3049
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:19,140
A nail on the ground.

3050
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:19,520
Oh my gosh.

3051
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:20,100
Three snakes.

3052
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:20,860
Solid.

3053
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:24,380
One snake.

3054
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:25,060
Liquid.

3055
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:27,700
Two snakes.

3056
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,400
Solidus.

3057
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:29,120
It's behind me.

3058
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:29,420
Sorry.

3059
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:30,720
Right of us.

3060
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:31,400
Welcome to my workshop.

3061
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:32,100
Thank you.

3062
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:32,920
In here.

3063
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:34,220
Thank you for the five gifts.

3064
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:36,760
Three snakes.

3065
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:37,480
A dime.

3066
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:41,100
A dime.

3067
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:42,640
A diamond.

3068
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:45,180
Diamond.

3069
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:47,540
Oh like a diamond shape.

3070
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:48,300
Probably.

3071
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:49,780
That's a heart shape.

3072
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,460
Diamond shape.

3073
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:53,820
A frame that's round.

3074
02:26:56,620 --> 02:26:58,480
A frame that's round.

3075
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,400
A lantern.

3076
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,360
Do you guys see a diamond?

3077
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:06,720
Oh!

3078
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:07,680
Oh my gosh!

3079
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:09,500
The picture frame diamond.

3080
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:09,720
Yeah!

3081
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:10,680
I just saw it.

3082
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,120
Oh my gosh.

3083
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:11,600
A cat.

3084
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:14,400
A cat.

3085
02:27:15,220 --> 02:27:15,700
A queen.

3086
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:17,960
A queen.

3087
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:19,200
Four letters.

3088
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:23,420
One letter.

3089
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:25,800
Two letters.

3090
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:28,880
Two letters.

3091
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:29,700
Three letters.

3092
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:32,320
They don't...wait, they do spell something.

3093
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:33,500
Three letters.

3094
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:33,980
Fire.

3095
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:39,200
Nice.

3096
02:27:39,260 --> 02:27:39,780
Good job guys.

3097
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:40,060
Good job.

3098
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:40,700
Four letters.

3099
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,900
Who needs observation duty when we have this game, right?

3100
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:45,200
Tamanaki!

3101
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:46,180
Welcome to membership.

3102
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:46,920
Thank you.

3103
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:49,060
Two holes for eyes.

3104
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:55,880
Two holes for eyes.

3105
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:57,740
And the number 13.

3106
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,080
Spooky.

3107
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:02,940
The number 13.

3108
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:10,960
Thank you.

3109
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:17,760
Check my plans and you'll see where to put machine part three.

3110
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:19,040
The rhymes are too long.

3111
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:19,740
They are too cute.

3112
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:21,740
Alright, we are done with this room.

3113
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:24,320
On to this.

3114
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:27,720
Minky!

3115
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:30,760
One spider.

3116
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:33,360
Stop talking!

3117
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:34,260
Stop making that noise!

3118
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:36,520
So loud.

3119
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,200
A red K.

3120
02:28:44,140 --> 02:28:44,660
Minky!

3121
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:44,960
Minky!

3122
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:46,480
I thought that said number four.

3123
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:51,460
Oh yeah, sorry that I'm covering...I wish I could move, but unfortunately I can't.

3124
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,180
With how today is set up.

3125
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:54,100
So I'm really sorry.

3126
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:55,540
A shadowy X.

3127
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:58,040
Minky!

3128
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,660
A shadowy X.

3129
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:06,440
I will say that you think that my mama's art is cute.

3130
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:09,180
Which of course, Ayami mama's art is the cutest!

3131
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:11,920
An upside down key.

3132
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:12,880
Three hearts.

3133
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:13,580
One here.

3134
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:17,460
One heart.

3135
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:19,620
Two hearts.

3136
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:24,660
Two hearts.

3137
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:26,100
One more heart.

3138
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:34,820
Two keys on a chain.

3139
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:38,820
Two keys on a chain.

3140
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:40,160
A key back in place.

3141
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:44,000
A key back in place.

3142
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:45,020
An ace.

3143
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:48,360
An ace.

3144
02:29:48,380 --> 02:29:49,300
A three.

3145
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,040
I only got the one spider.

3146
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:54,500
I can't find the other spider.

3147
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:56,080
Spitter, spitter!

3148
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:57,160
I see a bee.

3149
02:29:57,900 --> 02:29:58,720
I see a frog.

3150
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:02,060
Spitter...oh here I see him!

3151
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:04,400
Guys!

3152
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:05,260
Oh my God!

3153
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:06,100
Horrible!

3154
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:07,760
Horrible, horrible sounds.

3155
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:09,640
Two spiders.

3156
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,980
Don't laugh at that.

3157
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,100
Oh I see another heart.

3158
02:30:14,140 --> 02:30:14,700
Nice.

3159
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:17,360
That one hurt bad.

3160
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,100
Three hearts.

3161
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:20,540
An acorn?

3162
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:22,580
I saw it earlier.

3163
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,600
Oh my gosh where did it go?

3164
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,520
And then a plane.

3165
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:27,160
A plane and an acorn guys.

3166
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:28,340
Acorn!

3167
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:31,500
An acorn.

3168
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:33,340
Now a plane.

3169
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:35,140
Did you guys see a plane?

3170
02:30:36,340 --> 02:30:37,320
Astro cat!

3171
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,040
Welcome to membership!

3172
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:38,840
Thank you!

3173
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:40,280
Below the king.

3174
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:41,280
Oh no that's an acorn.

3175
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,780
On the postcard.

3176
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,780
Oh good find!

3177
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,200
Good find!

3178
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:50,180
Good find!

3179
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:50,320
A plane.

3180
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:51,540
Good job guys.

3181
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:57,380
Puntor!

3182
02:30:57,480 --> 02:30:59,020
Thanks for 5 months!

3183
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:02,760
That one was really small.

3184
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,180
Good find guys.

3185
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:08,800
That's a lot.

3186
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:10,760
11 more is a whole ton.

3187
02:31:15,740 --> 02:31:18,120
I guess we can do stuff in the kitchen again, huh?

3188
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:21,120
Three cups.

3189
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:24,780
Oh wow now we have all the ingredients and stuff.

3190
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,340
A cat that's gold.

3191
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:27,640
Yeah I found them!

3192
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:31,800
Mold.

3193
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:37,320
This is a chill stream game.

3194
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:38,420
It is, right?

3195
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:39,620
Having fun.

3196
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:40,480
I hope you guys are chill.

3197
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:43,860
Oh my god.

3198
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:55,110
Sometimes I can't.

3199
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:56,830
I think that's a cup.

3200
02:31:56,930 --> 02:31:57,690
That's one cup.

3201
02:31:57,850 --> 02:31:59,510
The first bug in the line is a snail.

3202
02:32:00,430 --> 02:32:00,870
Oh here!

3203
02:32:03,490 --> 02:32:03,990
Ewww.

3204
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:06,730
Blue snail spice.

3205
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:10,830
That was a real chill.

3206
02:32:12,110 --> 02:32:13,810
Blue snail spice.

3207
02:32:14,210 --> 02:32:16,110
Does this count as a cup or is this a jar?

3208
02:32:17,370 --> 02:32:18,590
Wow look at him go!

3209
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:19,310
A snake.

3210
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:19,950
Nevermind.

3211
02:32:20,270 --> 02:32:21,030
Bug twice.

3212
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:25,290
Bug once.

3213
02:32:25,450 --> 02:32:26,630
And now bug remover.

3214
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:31,610
What's the other cup?

3215
02:32:31,630 --> 02:32:33,130
Oh there are two more cups right here.

3216
02:32:33,230 --> 02:32:33,810
I'm so silly.

3217
02:32:34,430 --> 02:32:34,910
Nice.

3218
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:35,610
Okay.

3219
02:32:37,370 --> 02:32:38,330
Two cups.

3220
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,250
One cup.

3221
02:32:39,710 --> 02:32:40,350
One more cup.

3222
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:45,630
Three cups.

3223
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:48,610
Alright we got an empty bottle right up here behind you guys.

3224
02:32:49,230 --> 02:32:52,030
And then a candle.

3225
02:32:53,210 --> 02:32:54,970
Candle, candle, candle.

3226
02:32:55,970 --> 02:32:56,910
A candle?

3227
02:32:57,990 --> 02:32:58,710
A candle?

3228
02:32:59,710 --> 02:33:01,170
Do you guys see a candle?

3229
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:05,070
Say I if you see a say.

3230
02:33:05,530 --> 02:33:09,090
Say, say, say, say.

3231
02:33:09,910 --> 02:33:11,750
Say say if you see a candle.

3232
02:33:12,190 --> 02:33:12,990
Oh I see it!

3233
02:33:13,370 --> 02:33:15,050
You don't see it because it's behind me.

3234
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:19,470
You guys said say but you couldn't see it.

3235
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:20,930
It was literally behind my head.

3236
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,530
You guys are liars all of you.

3237
02:33:26,530 --> 02:33:37,290
Rob, Otamegin, King, Resting Glitch Face, Nyko, David...oh my god terrible sound.

3238
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:41,730
Brian, you all said say and I'm calling you out.

3239
02:33:42,010 --> 02:33:43,350
You guys are lying.

3240
02:33:45,670 --> 02:33:47,610
You guys lied.

3241
02:33:49,130 --> 02:33:50,310
Not Brian.

3242
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:51,290
I know right?

3243
02:33:52,530 --> 02:33:53,370
One coin.

3244
02:33:56,530 --> 02:33:57,510
Two coins.

3245
02:33:59,790 --> 02:34:00,830
Two coins.

3246
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:04,250
I mistook you for a candle because of how you light up my life.

3247
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:11,890
Negative two!

3248
02:34:12,170 --> 02:34:12,990
Negative two!

3249
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:14,050
Negative two!

3250
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:23,330
I like how it split.

3251
02:34:23,530 --> 02:34:24,690
Plus two, negative two.

3252
02:34:25,730 --> 02:34:26,970
That was pretty smooth though.

3253
02:34:27,370 --> 02:34:28,110
That was a good one.

3254
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:31,370
A sailing ship.

3255
02:34:32,670 --> 02:34:33,590
Sailing ship.

3256
02:34:36,430 --> 02:34:39,950
Sailing, sailing on the ocean blue.

3257
02:34:40,310 --> 02:34:40,870
Oh here it is.

3258
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:42,410
Sorry it was behind my head.

3259
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:44,750
Oh my god the ship just went down!

3260
02:34:44,910 --> 02:34:45,690
Nevermind it's fine.

3261
02:34:47,090 --> 02:34:47,950
A heart.

3262
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:50,710
Heart, heart, heart, heart, hearty heart, heart.

3263
02:34:50,990 --> 02:34:52,550
Hearty heart, heart, hearty heart.

3264
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:54,870
Does Nero-sama still do that?

3265
02:34:54,970 --> 02:34:55,670
Hearty heart, heart?

3266
02:34:58,150 --> 02:35:00,090
That was one of my favorite things she would do.

3267
02:35:00,210 --> 02:35:01,530
Hearty heart, heart, hearty heart.

3268
02:35:02,030 --> 02:35:03,030
The horse!

3269
02:35:04,430 --> 02:35:05,210
She does?

3270
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:07,390
Sometimes.

3271
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:09,390
A paperclip.

3272
02:35:11,470 --> 02:35:13,110
Not much anymore.

3273
02:35:13,450 --> 02:35:16,390
An open mouth.

3274
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:28,140
Open mouth.

3275
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:29,160
Open mouth?

3276
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:31,560
I don't even see... no his mouth is closed.

3277
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:33,740
Open mouth?

3278
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:35,680
I don't see one at all.

3279
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:39,640
The mouth is hard.

3280
02:35:39,720 --> 02:35:40,320
Do you see it?

3281
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:42,680
Open mouth.

3282
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:43,860
Up, up, up, up.

3283
02:35:43,980 --> 02:35:44,500
What's the other ones?

3284
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:45,180
An S?

3285
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:47,060
S, S, S.

3286
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:47,740
Oh here.

3287
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:51,600
An S.

3288
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,380
A fly in a cup?

3289
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:57,380
I see a couple of flies, but not one in a cup.

3290
02:35:58,220 --> 02:35:59,340
There is not even a cup.

3291
02:35:59,400 --> 02:35:59,720
Oh here.

3292
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:01,200
That's a cup.

3293
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:02,780
A fly in a cup.

3294
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:03,800
Maybe the saw?

3295
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:04,200
This one?

3296
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:06,000
An open mouth.

3297
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:07,560
Oh my god!

3298
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:08,480
What?

3299
02:36:08,740 --> 02:36:09,200
That's...

3300
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:09,460
What?

3301
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:12,940
That's... OK.

3302
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:13,960
OK game.

3303
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:14,740
I see the needle.

3304
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:19,320
And a spotted beetle.

3305
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:30,320
It does kind of look like a troll face.

3306
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:35,940
I am.

3307
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:38,280
That's why I'm wearing glasses today.

3308
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,220
I'm so smart.

3309
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:42,260
Yes.

3310
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,180
That's why I have my glasses on you guys.

3311
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:46,480
So we are so smart.

3312
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:51,920
Oh sorry I accidentally clicked out of it.

3313
02:36:52,180 --> 02:36:52,700
A hammer!

3314
02:36:55,700 --> 02:36:56,720
Two nuts?

3315
02:37:01,310 --> 02:37:02,310
Is this a nut?

3316
02:37:04,670 --> 02:37:05,790
One nut.

3317
02:37:10,050 --> 02:37:10,050
Sorry.

3318
02:37:10,590 --> 02:37:12,490
I shouldn't laugh at...

3319
02:37:13,810 --> 02:37:15,970
Oh this one I think is behind me.

3320
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:19,330
It's metal...well it's gears, but I think it counts.

3321
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:20,470
Nope, nevermind.

3322
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:21,070
It doesn't count.

3323
02:37:21,270 --> 02:37:23,230
I thought it was like nuts and...oh is this a nut?

3324
02:37:27,410 --> 02:37:28,450
Two nuts.

3325
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:32,830
I was thinking of like nuts and bolts.

3326
02:37:33,150 --> 02:37:35,110
That's what the gears...OK a shell.

3327
02:37:35,710 --> 02:37:37,610
A shell, a shell, a shell, a shell.

3328
02:37:37,830 --> 02:37:40,310
Also, a cobwebby name!

3329
02:37:44,730 --> 02:37:46,050
Give me my Zen Zen Zen.

3330
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:48,770
Oh here is the shell.

3331
02:37:50,390 --> 02:37:51,350
Big shell?

3332
02:37:51,490 --> 02:37:52,070
A shell.

3333
02:37:53,850 --> 02:37:54,810
Metal gear.

3334
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:57,670
A flower.

3335
02:38:00,250 --> 02:38:01,910
A flower.

3336
02:38:03,390 --> 02:38:07,230
A flower.

3337
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:08,350
A flower.

3338
02:38:08,490 --> 02:38:12,210
Hold on let me check my...let me check something real quick.

3339
02:38:13,190 --> 02:38:14,610
OK I'm good.

3340
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:16,730
A bell.

3341
02:38:17,890 --> 02:38:25,030
A bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell, a bell.

3342
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:26,310
It's a bell.

3343
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:30,320
It was behind my head, sorry.

3344
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:31,740
I see the pin.

3345
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:32,860
You do?

3346
02:38:33,980 --> 02:38:34,960
Seven in place.

3347
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:35,920
We got to put this in place.

3348
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:38,160
Nice.

3349
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:41,300
We got to move this for midnight.

3350
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:45,800
Time.

3351
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:47,720
Bing bong bing bong.

3352
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:50,120
A carved violin.

3353
02:38:51,700 --> 02:38:52,140
Here.

3354
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:54,280
And a pin.

3355
02:38:54,740 --> 02:38:55,760
Oh I see it!

3356
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:56,660
I see it.

3357
02:38:58,240 --> 02:38:59,560
Good job guys, good job.

3358
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:06,600
Oh I forgot to try the hint.

3359
02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:09,080
I want to see what happens if it like gives you...

3360
02:39:09,660 --> 02:39:13,480
Like a straight up hint or if it's like...

3361
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:16,360
Or if it's like just tells you where it is you know.

3362
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,160
I'm curious.

3363
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:23,440
Alright.

3364
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:26,180
Did we complete downstairs then?

3365
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:27,920
I think so.

3366
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:28,640
We can go upstairs.

3367
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:31,960
I can tell.

3368
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:35,180
Let's do the secret room.

3369
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,200
Eyes by a chimney.

3370
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:38,860
A chimney.

3371
02:39:38,980 --> 02:39:40,180
Out a chimney.

3372
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,360
Chimney, chimney, chimney.

3373
02:39:42,580 --> 02:39:43,140
A chimney.

3374
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:44,280
Oh yeah, let's try the hint.

3375
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:49,380
Alright.

3376
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:53,260
Subsea.

3377
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:57,200
Did you notice the items around the clock all rhyme with the numbers they're next to?

3378
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:58,460
Love this game, so much nostalgia.

3379
02:39:58,600 --> 02:39:59,900
Oh yeah, I didn't notice that.

3380
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:00,460
What?

3381
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:01,560
That's so good.

3382
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:04,720
The ghost fart.

3383
02:40:04,860 --> 02:40:05,820
Don't call it that.

3384
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:07,260
Out.

3385
02:40:08,540 --> 02:40:09,420
Get out.

3386
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:11,060
A chain.

3387
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:13,180
A chain, a chain, a chain.

3388
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:16,660
This is the room we know the least since we've only been in here like one time.

3389
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:18,240
Oh that's a recorder.

3390
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:19,140
That's crazy.

3391
02:40:19,240 --> 02:40:20,300
A question mark.

3392
02:40:20,740 --> 02:40:21,560
A chain.

3393
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:22,480
A ghostly face?

3394
02:40:24,380 --> 02:40:25,820
A ghostly face.

3395
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:28,000
A snake and a plane.

3396
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:29,160
Oh my god, snakes on a plane?

3397
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:32,860
A snake and a plane.

3398
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:36,580
I see an arrow.

3399
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:37,840
Eyeglasses.

3400
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:40,260
Ghost fart glass.

3401
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:41,780
Don't call it that.

3402
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:43,860
Oh, on the ceiling fan.

3403
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,380
Thank you.

3404
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:47,100
A chain.

3405
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:48,400
Nice, good find.

3406
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:50,240
A plane.

3407
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:53,160
And a snake.

3408
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:54,260
An ink in a jar.

3409
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,520
Ink in a jar.

3410
02:40:57,700 --> 02:40:58,400
A star.

3411
02:41:02,440 --> 02:41:03,740
A star.

3412
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:05,980
Two moons.

3413
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:06,480
One moon?

3414
02:41:08,780 --> 02:41:09,960
One moon.

3415
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:14,300
This is not the snake.

3416
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:15,660
This is a lizard, right?

3417
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:21,300
Two moons.

3418
02:41:22,820 --> 02:41:24,060
We need a question mark.

3419
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:25,220
Oh yeah, are you here?

3420
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:25,960
Nice.

3421
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:28,940
A question mark.

3422
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:30,000
Is it a paper plane?

3423
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:38,060
Smarty pants on my ears.

3424
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,880
I see the snake.

3425
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:44,660
Snake on wallpaper.

3426
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:45,240
Yeah!

3427
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:47,240
And four arrows.

3428
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:48,000
We have one.

3429
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:52,400
Two arrows.

3430
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:57,800
Three arrows.

3431
02:42:00,830 --> 02:42:02,380
I believe this is our fourth.

3432
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:08,380
Good job guys!

3433
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,240
Oh my god!

3434
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:12,960
The hint is like...

3435
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,390
Yay!

3436
02:42:26,050 --> 02:42:28,070
I'm ready to make ghosts.

3437
02:42:28,670 --> 02:42:29,330
We can't wait.

3438
02:42:29,430 --> 02:42:30,170
Are we killing people?

3439
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:30,470
Wait.

3440
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:32,430
Wait a second.

3441
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:34,350
Skelly man, what do you mean by that?

3442
02:42:35,310 --> 02:42:36,790
Skelly man, what do you mean by that?

3443
02:42:38,590 --> 02:42:40,890
Eyes by five ears.

3444
02:42:41,290 --> 02:42:41,970
A yo-yo.

3445
02:42:42,010 --> 02:42:43,350
Five ears?

3446
02:42:43,750 --> 02:42:46,530
Open mouth.

3447
02:42:47,050 --> 02:42:48,710
An open mouth.

3448
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:49,450
A yo-yo.

3449
02:42:50,430 --> 02:42:51,970
We saw the yo-yo before.

3450
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:52,910
Where is the yo-yo now?

3451
02:42:54,170 --> 02:42:54,950
Yo-yo.

3452
02:42:56,150 --> 02:42:57,010
A yo-yo.

3453
02:42:57,570 --> 02:42:57,930
Oh here.

3454
02:43:00,390 --> 02:43:01,710
Time to be evil.

3455
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:05,190
We are making ghosts.

3456
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:05,930
A sun.

3457
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:10,470
Skeet on study.

3458
02:43:11,030 --> 02:43:12,650
Skeet on study.

3459
02:43:13,170 --> 02:43:14,810
Skeet on study.

3460
02:43:15,090 --> 02:43:15,790
And one ear.

3461
02:43:17,330 --> 02:43:18,810
Do you think these count as two ears?

3462
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:22,570
I think so.

3463
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:26,510
Three ears.

3464
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:30,010
This guy's ear.

3465
02:43:32,210 --> 02:43:33,730
Four ears.

3466
02:43:34,070 --> 02:43:35,450
And then this little rat's ear.

3467
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:39,810
Nice five ears.

3468
02:43:40,330 --> 02:43:41,490
Five ears.

3469
02:43:42,570 --> 02:43:44,290
Oh this way there is the apostrophe.

3470
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:45,850
A skeleton study.

3471
02:43:47,730 --> 02:43:48,490
No.

3472
02:43:49,070 --> 02:43:50,130
Skeeton study.

3473
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:51,730
Number one.

3474
02:43:52,050 --> 02:43:53,270
We got seven, four.

3475
02:43:54,150 --> 02:43:58,990
Bats, bugs, windows, doors, plumbing is behind me.

3476
02:44:00,890 --> 02:44:02,570
Six five letter words.

3477
02:44:02,970 --> 02:44:04,610
Ok, doors is one.

3478
02:44:08,330 --> 02:44:09,790
Ghost is a five letter word.

3479
02:44:10,470 --> 02:44:11,350
Man I love these.

3480
02:44:11,470 --> 02:44:12,350
Thanks for the nostalgia Minta.

3481
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:12,990
Of course!

3482
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:14,210
Three!

3483
02:44:18,970 --> 02:44:20,590
Haunt is a five letter word.

3484
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:26,350
Oh the trophy has one.

3485
02:44:26,410 --> 02:44:26,710
Good job.

3486
02:44:31,390 --> 02:44:31,990
Soups?

3487
02:44:33,050 --> 02:44:34,210
How many are we at?

3488
02:44:35,230 --> 02:44:35,230
Five.

3489
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:37,050
Five letter words.

3490
02:44:37,350 --> 02:44:38,630
Ok we need one more.

3491
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:39,450
Is it study?

3492
02:44:43,530 --> 02:44:45,990
Have you read How to Haunt Minto?

3493
02:44:46,210 --> 02:44:49,090
I wrote that.

3494
02:44:49,370 --> 02:44:51,250
I wrote the whole book on that.

3495
02:44:51,450 --> 02:44:52,050
On how to haunt.

3496
02:44:55,270 --> 02:44:56,650
Oh that's so cute.

3497
02:44:57,350 --> 02:44:58,130
A match.

3498
02:44:58,130 --> 02:45:00,250
I saw this before I think.

3499
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:01,390
Or was it a different one?

3500
02:45:01,570 --> 02:45:02,050
Oh no I did.

3501
02:45:02,130 --> 02:45:03,710
I saw this tiny little match there.

3502
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:07,650
Oh my god don't set the rat on fire!

3503
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:08,550
A match.

3504
02:45:09,150 --> 02:45:11,230
The longest green tail.

3505
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:13,210
That is a pretty long tail.

3506
02:45:16,450 --> 02:45:18,890
The longest green tail.

3507
02:45:19,170 --> 02:45:20,650
And three little birds.

3508
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:21,730
So we got one bird here.

3509
02:45:24,730 --> 02:45:26,270
We got a little bird here.

3510
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:31,910
Two little birds.

3511
02:45:32,510 --> 02:45:34,730
Two little birds.

3512
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:36,390
Oh and an owl.

3513
02:45:36,530 --> 02:45:37,210
An owl, an owl.

3514
02:45:43,230 --> 02:45:45,050
Three little birds.

3515
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,660
Such a lust for revenge.

3516
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:55,280
Seven!

3517
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:59,680
One of my favorite things to quote from Seinfeld.

3518
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:01,120
Seven.

3519
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:04,300
Did you guys ever watch Seinfeld?

3520
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:05,940
I watched it somewhat recently.

3521
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:07,880
So I quote mostly that.

3522
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:10,100
Basically...

3523
02:46:11,060 --> 02:46:14,800
George Costanza is trying to figure out the name.

3524
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:17,280
The perfect baby name.

3525
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:18,750
And he comes up with...

3526
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:19,820
Seven.

3527
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:24,120
Is it like Friends?

3528
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:25,380
I never watched Friends.

3529
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:25,640
Friends.

3530
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:29,740
I never watched Friends.

3531
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:37,240
Is Friends any good?

3532
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:38,120
Let's do this one.

3533
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:41,400
Red Rose.

3534
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:42,080
This one.

3535
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:44,620
A moon.

3536
02:46:45,940 --> 02:46:47,280
Oh my god the moon is tiny.

3537
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:53,280
It's like Friends but funny.

3538
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:55,440
No soup for you!

3539
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:56,860
I like that one too.

3540
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:58,080
Fright?

3541
02:46:59,040 --> 02:46:59,680
Fright.

3542
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:01,620
Where is fright written?

3543
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:03,080
Fright?

3544
02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:05,160
I don't see a fright.

3545
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:06,840
Oh, a fright.

3546
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:08,080
Why?

3547
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:11,520
It's an all cap so it should be written right?

3548
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:13,340
Like one of these words.

3549
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:16,800
I always consider Lucky Star to be a Seinfeld anime.

3550
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:18,880
Yeah?

3551
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,980
Maybe, yeah.

3552
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:24,120
A fingerprint.

3553
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:24,960
Oh my gosh.

3554
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:25,920
A fish?

3555
02:47:26,260 --> 02:47:28,200
Wait, I don't see any of these things.

3556
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:30,060
OK, we gotta lock in you guys.

3557
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:31,360
We gotta lock in.

3558
02:47:31,860 --> 02:47:32,780
Oh wait, there is a fish.

3559
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:34,980
A fish.

3560
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:37,320
My favorite was these pretzels are making me thirsty.

3561
02:47:37,480 --> 02:47:38,460
I don't remember that one.

3562
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:46,560
I feel like maybe Azumanga is more like Seinfeld.

3563
02:47:49,940 --> 02:47:50,860
No, maybe...

3564
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:52,260
I don't know.

3565
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:54,440
Serenity now!

3566
02:47:58,060 --> 02:48:01,080
Oh my gosh, there is so much good stuff to quote from Seinfeld.

3567
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:01,640
So good.

3568
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:04,220
The eye of a needle.

3569
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:06,000
The tongue of a snake.

3570
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:11,600
Where is a snake at?

3571
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:14,220
This looks like a car.

3572
02:48:16,480 --> 02:48:18,140
Are these things even...

3573
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:18,740
What?

3574
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:20,820
That's an owl.

3575
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:23,180
Three eights in a row?

3576
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:25,000
We can find this one.

3577
02:48:25,060 --> 02:48:25,600
Oh, here we go.

3578
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:30,040
Three eights in a row.

3579
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:32,100
Guys, this one is tricky.

3580
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:35,820
In the boot?

3581
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:37,720
What boot?

3582
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:40,440
Boot?

3583
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:42,880
A paper snowflake.

3584
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:43,660
Oh, I see this one.

3585
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:47,280
A paper snowflake.

3586
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:48,200
I saw that one earlier.

3587
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:50,180
OK, a fingerprint.

3588
02:48:50,540 --> 02:48:51,140
Fingerprint.

3589
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:53,020
Fingerprint.

3590
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:53,640
Fingerprint.

3591
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:55,680
Fingerprint.

3592
02:48:57,860 --> 02:48:59,620
Red moth, maybe tongue.

3593
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:03,400
I think that...

3594
02:49:03,400 --> 02:49:06,780
I don't see a snake here though.

3595
02:49:10,480 --> 02:49:13,360
I see fright, you do?

3596
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:14,920
I see scream.

3597
02:49:17,220 --> 02:49:19,520
I see eek.

3598
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:21,380
Whatever that says.

3599
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:29,520
This one is maybe the one that stumped me the most.

3600
02:49:29,620 --> 02:49:31,000
And the eye of a needle.

3601
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,100
Middle...Oh my gosh!

3602
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:37,340
Yeah, middle, bottom.

3603
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:38,480
Oh my god.

3604
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:40,640
The tongue of a snake.

3605
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,540
Would you ever play the other Eye Spy games?

3606
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,180
Maybe, if you guys want me to.

3607
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:45,920
I've never played those before though.

3608
02:49:54,480 --> 02:49:56,560
I don't even see a needle in here.

3609
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:58,360
I have a needle.

3610
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:00,720
I see nails.

3611
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:03,500
Oh here it is!

3612
02:50:03,580 --> 02:50:04,580
Oh my gosh!

3613
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:07,120
You guys see this?

3614
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:09,400
The needle was the second half.

3615
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:14,160
Oh my god!

3616
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:15,600
That's crazy!

3617
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:17,440
What?

3618
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:19,860
OK, a fingerprint.

3619
02:50:19,860 --> 02:50:20,220
A fingerprint.

3620
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:24,080
That one was super duper sneaky.

3621
02:50:24,280 --> 02:50:26,900
Especially without the magnifying glass.

3622
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:28,640
That was so good.

3623
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:34,160
A fright and a fingerprint.

3624
02:50:40,690 --> 02:50:43,170
Does this count as a fingerprint?

3625
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:43,950
No.

3626
02:50:45,890 --> 02:50:47,290
Fright is top left.

3627
02:50:51,530 --> 02:50:53,210
Oh but...

3628
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:54,790
What?

3629
02:50:55,930 --> 02:50:58,250
Oh my gosh!

3630
02:50:58,450 --> 02:50:58,950
Wow!

3631
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:01,210
OK, nice!

3632
02:51:01,330 --> 02:51:01,670
Nice!

3633
02:51:01,850 --> 02:51:02,510
Nice!

3634
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:06,150
You guys have good vision.

3635
02:51:06,990 --> 02:51:07,770
Wow!

3636
02:51:09,990 --> 02:51:11,830
Now a fingerprint.

3637
02:51:14,450 --> 02:51:15,650
Fingerprint.

3638
02:51:15,810 --> 02:51:17,790
I'm looking at the bodies.

3639
02:51:18,810 --> 02:51:20,370
I'm looking at...

3640
02:51:20,370 --> 02:51:23,190
All around fingerprint.

3641
02:51:25,650 --> 02:51:28,970
Bottom looks like a place to hide the fingerprint.

3642
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:32,090
I don't think it's like that.

3643
02:51:32,370 --> 02:51:33,670
No, I don't think that's a fingerprint.

3644
02:51:35,050 --> 02:51:36,710
Any fingerprints on here?

3645
02:51:36,870 --> 02:51:40,550
I can't believe it didn't say the owl face.

3646
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:44,150
Top right left wing.

3647
02:51:44,450 --> 02:51:45,690
Top right left wing?

3648
02:51:45,790 --> 02:51:46,830
No, that's a feather.

3649
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:53,750
Fingerprint.

3650
02:51:53,930 --> 02:51:55,390
I don't want to use the hint.

3651
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:57,790
I'm looking around.

3652
02:52:00,870 --> 02:52:03,090
It's not in the spider web.

3653
02:52:03,610 --> 02:52:04,770
Let's scram.

3654
02:52:09,780 --> 02:52:12,560
Bottom middle butterfly below the left wing.

3655
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:14,560
This?

3656
02:52:18,290 --> 02:52:20,660
You have to be...

3657
02:52:20,660 --> 02:52:23,560
Oh my gosh, you have to be hovered over it.

3658
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:24,560
Wow!

3659
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,640
A fingerprint.

3660
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:33,020
That's really clever.

3661
02:52:33,440 --> 02:52:33,880
Wow!

3662
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:37,720
That was super duper subtle.

3663
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:41,640
By now you know my little scheme.

3664
02:52:42,340 --> 02:52:44,980
Here's the tenth part of the ghost machine.

3665
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:45,960
Tenth part.

3666
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:46,460
Nice.

3667
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:47,860
Good job guys.

3668
02:52:47,960 --> 02:52:49,280
Thank you for the help on that one.

3669
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:51,580
That was super duper well hidden, right?

3670
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:56,060
This kid's game still can get us a little bit sometimes.

3671
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:57,400
Which I appreciate.

3672
02:52:58,200 --> 02:52:58,900
Mickey!

3673
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:00,500
A bear?

3674
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:05,760
Oh my god!

3675
02:53:05,820 --> 02:53:06,740
Oh my god!

3676
02:53:07,900 --> 02:53:09,300
Calm down!

3677
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:10,940
Holy shit!

3678
02:53:10,940 --> 02:53:12,440
Oh my god.

3679
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:18,840
If that didn't wake anybody up, I don't know.

3680
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:20,660
Good morning Minto!

3681
02:53:22,040 --> 02:53:22,800
Jeez!

3682
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:24,100
Chill guy!

3683
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:31,400
Two ducks.

3684
02:53:31,700 --> 02:53:32,180
A snail.

3685
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:34,140
Oh my gosh, I noticed the snail last time.

3686
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:36,540
A snail.

3687
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:37,740
Minky, Minky.

3688
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:41,740
A vase with three flowers.

3689
02:53:44,740 --> 02:53:46,360
A spotted tail, this one.

3690
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:49,980
A spotted tail?

3691
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:53,940
I was playing Stalker and that was a big mistake.

3692
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:54,960
I thought it was a blood sucker.

3693
02:53:56,780 --> 02:53:58,120
Sorry to scare you Donnie.

3694
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:00,320
A pair of scissors.

3695
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:03,100
Oh here.

3696
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:08,300
A pair of flies.

3697
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:15,820
A bottle half full, it's behind my head.

3698
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:20,500
A bottle half full.

3699
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:22,900
And yellow eyes.

3700
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:25,120
This one we sped through easy.

3701
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:27,300
Phoenix, thanks for seven months!

3702
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:31,760
I need scissor 61, I need scissor 61.

3703
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,120
Lightning fast.

3704
02:54:36,220 --> 02:54:37,600
That one was super duper easy.

3705
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:46,420
Not yet, but we'll get there.

3706
02:54:47,960 --> 02:54:49,820
Let's do this room.

3707
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:53,120
Three horses.

3708
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:54,740
One horse.

3709
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:01,580
There is a chess horse piece behind me.

3710
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:05,720
Stop it!

3711
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:08,760
Stop these sounds, they are terrible.

3712
02:55:09,340 --> 02:55:11,040
Please spare my ears.

3713
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:14,560
A third horse.

3714
02:55:15,160 --> 02:55:16,740
A third horse.

3715
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:19,240
A third horse.

3716
02:55:21,940 --> 02:55:23,560
Oh here, a tiny.

3717
02:55:25,660 --> 02:55:28,040
Sheepy, thanks for five months!

3718
02:55:29,320 --> 02:55:30,540
English, thanks for seven months.

3719
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:32,520
I spy one cute ghost.

3720
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:34,160
A button nose.

3721
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:39,000
A mirror.

3722
02:55:42,560 --> 02:55:44,360
A brush.

3723
02:55:45,210 --> 02:55:47,100
A brush, a brush.

3724
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:49,260
A brush with death.

3725
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:52,560
Actually, where is the brush?

3726
02:55:53,440 --> 02:55:54,420
Where is the brush?

3727
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:55,760
A brush.

3728
02:55:56,500 --> 02:55:57,340
Brush!

3729
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:02,280
And a bat.

3730
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:05,400
I see the bat.

3731
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:06,280
Oh my god.

3732
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:07,780
A bat.

3733
02:56:08,500 --> 02:56:10,240
Oh my gosh, I probably would have missed that.

3734
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:11,460
White toes?

3735
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:17,100
Oh like a paintbrush.

3736
02:56:17,820 --> 02:56:18,820
Is there a paintbrush?

3737
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:20,760
Paintbrush?

3738
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:22,480
I'm looking for a paintbrush.

3739
02:56:23,740 --> 02:56:24,900
Oh I see it!

3740
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:26,540
Nice!

3741
02:56:26,980 --> 02:56:28,140
I dream about cheese.

3742
02:56:28,980 --> 02:56:30,660
Me too sometimes.

3743
02:56:30,700 --> 02:56:31,800
Welcome to Mambo Shop!

3744
02:56:32,080 --> 02:56:32,920
A cat's tail.

3745
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:36,340
Yeah, get that...

3746
02:56:36,340 --> 02:56:41,320
I thought you were going to get that nasty fly off your face.

3747
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:42,840
Is this a vest?

3748
02:56:43,620 --> 02:56:45,280
No, it's a coat.

3749
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:48,900
A green vest.

3750
02:56:49,100 --> 02:56:52,140
Why does everything need to be oiled so badly?

3751
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:53,760
Four red shoes.

3752
02:56:55,820 --> 02:56:57,460
One red shoe.

3753
02:56:57,460 --> 02:56:58,740
Two red shoes.

3754
02:57:04,740 --> 02:57:05,980
Four red shoes.

3755
02:57:07,260 --> 02:57:08,200
I mean three red shoes.

3756
02:57:09,080 --> 02:57:10,780
Because it's spookier that way.

3757
02:57:11,320 --> 02:57:12,380
I guess it is an old mansion.

3758
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:12,920
You're right.

3759
02:57:13,400 --> 02:57:13,760
You're right.

3760
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:14,580
Except the bathroom.

3761
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:18,340
The bathroom is exceptionally clean, but they just never touch the closet.

3762
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:20,240
The biggest ears?

3763
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:24,100
Do you think it's the dogs or do you think it's the rabbits?

3764
02:57:25,640 --> 02:57:27,180
Who has bigger ears?

3765
02:57:27,260 --> 02:57:28,040
Peace of dog!

3766
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:29,220
Welcome to Mambo Shop!

3767
02:57:29,260 --> 02:57:30,600
And David, welcome to Mambo Shop!

3768
02:57:32,660 --> 02:57:33,260
The dog.

3769
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:40,180
And two twos.

3770
02:57:43,480 --> 02:57:44,280
That's a three.

3771
02:57:44,860 --> 02:57:45,380
Oh two?

3772
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:47,200
Oh my god, that one is kind of sneaky.

3773
02:57:48,900 --> 02:57:50,320
Oh my gosh and I found the other one.

3774
02:57:51,820 --> 02:57:52,220
Nice!

3775
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:54,020
Grimble!

3776
02:57:54,400 --> 02:57:55,340
Thanks for five months!

3777
02:57:56,240 --> 02:57:57,480
Two twos.

3778
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:59,460
We did it!

3779
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:05,840
I'm excited.

3780
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:07,640
I really can't wait to summon the ghost.

3781
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:11,940
One plus one plus one is three.

3782
02:58:12,380 --> 02:58:15,580
That's how many more parts you'll get from me.

3783
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,300
I can't wait to summon the ghost.

3784
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:20,440
Summoning a ghost.

3785
02:58:20,720 --> 02:58:21,440
Summoning a ghost.

3786
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:28,120
It's kind of sad that the thing, like the little paper, covers up so much of the screen.

3787
02:58:28,580 --> 02:58:30,440
You have all this stuff going on down here too.

3788
02:58:31,220 --> 02:58:32,080
You would never know it.

3789
02:58:33,700 --> 02:58:35,260
Last thing in this room baby.

3790
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:37,800
Eight stars!

3791
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:40,400
Holy shit!

3792
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:41,500
OK there is one.

3793
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:45,240
Two.

3794
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:49,960
Three.

3795
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:54,540
Three stars.

3796
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:55,240
Four.

3797
02:58:56,980 --> 02:58:59,180
Four stars.

3798
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:01,320
Five.

3799
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:03,700
Five stars.

3800
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:06,200
Six.

3801
02:59:06,540 --> 02:59:07,860
Six stars.

3802
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:09,280
Seven.

3803
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:12,780
Seven stars.

3804
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:14,080
And eight.

3805
02:59:17,870 --> 02:59:18,510
Yeah!

3806
02:59:19,310 --> 02:59:20,370
Eight stars.

3807
02:59:20,390 --> 02:59:21,930
That one is time consuming.

3808
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:24,370
Yeah guys, I'm a published author, Minky.

3809
02:59:24,630 --> 02:59:25,090
That's me.

3810
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:30,690
Yeah, you might be wondering, you might be wondering like, wow.

3811
02:59:31,870 --> 02:59:39,050
What does she do with all that amazing royalties and things like that?

3812
02:59:40,430 --> 02:59:41,670
It's hard to say.

3813
02:59:42,110 --> 02:59:46,210
Everywhere I go people are like, are you the one that wrote that Yuri book?

3814
02:59:46,210 --> 02:59:49,290
And I'm like, stop it.

3815
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:52,470
Stop it.

3816
02:59:53,050 --> 02:59:58,410
I just say I bought an old haunted mansion and I only used the bathroom in there.

3817
03:00:00,250 --> 03:00:01,010
That's it.

3818
03:00:01,890 --> 03:00:02,890
A toy doll.

3819
03:00:05,150 --> 03:00:05,730
Where?

3820
03:00:07,110 --> 03:00:08,150
Also a closed eye.

3821
03:00:10,690 --> 03:00:12,570
One closed eye.

3822
03:00:17,050 --> 03:00:18,530
Two closed eyes.

3823
03:00:18,710 --> 03:00:20,110
And then this little mouse.

3824
03:00:22,350 --> 03:00:24,270
Go back to sleep little mouse.

3825
03:00:25,230 --> 03:00:26,330
Three closed eyes.

3826
03:00:26,890 --> 03:00:27,450
A crayon.

3827
03:00:29,170 --> 03:00:30,310
Thanks for one more month.

3828
03:00:30,430 --> 03:00:30,750
A crayon.

3829
03:00:30,770 --> 03:00:31,270
Thank you.

3830
03:00:32,570 --> 03:00:33,490
Thank you Nero.

3831
03:00:35,290 --> 03:00:37,170
How about a reading from your book?

3832
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:38,070
Just a page or so.

3833
03:00:39,910 --> 03:00:40,610
I'll read you.

3834
03:00:40,610 --> 03:00:47,010
What lovely eyes you have, she said flirtatiously.

3835
03:00:47,910 --> 03:00:52,730
Thank you, she said back, flirting her eyes at the girl.

3836
03:00:53,710 --> 03:00:54,690
Flirt, flirt, flirt.

3837
03:00:55,890 --> 03:01:01,650
I wish to partake in a kiss, said girl.

3838
03:01:02,430 --> 03:01:04,990
Oh my gosh, me too, said other girl.

3839
03:01:04,990 --> 03:01:07,990
Then they kissed.

3840
03:01:08,510 --> 03:01:14,330
And then the moon crashed from the sky and impacted earth.

3841
03:01:14,990 --> 03:01:16,390
And everything was destroyed.

3842
03:01:17,110 --> 03:01:19,590
And that is what the moon brought.

3843
03:01:20,070 --> 03:01:22,750
Destruction upon the world!

3844
03:01:24,130 --> 03:01:24,810
Tasukaru!

3845
03:01:25,970 --> 03:01:27,710
Thank you, welcome to membership.

3846
03:01:28,210 --> 03:01:29,370
ViviCore, thanks for the gift dude.

3847
03:01:32,350 --> 03:01:34,710
Let's see, a crown for you King.

3848
03:01:37,030 --> 03:01:37,930
A crown.

3849
03:01:38,250 --> 03:01:38,930
Where is a toy?

3850
03:01:39,070 --> 03:01:39,770
I didn't see one.

3851
03:01:39,970 --> 03:01:41,390
Sorry, it's behind me.

3852
03:01:42,870 --> 03:01:43,910
A train.

3853
03:01:46,830 --> 03:01:47,470
Cowabunga!

3854
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:49,550
A hand that's red.

3855
03:01:51,130 --> 03:01:52,770
A hand that's red.

3856
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:56,630
A hand that's red.

3857
03:01:57,390 --> 03:01:58,510
A moon on a chain.

3858
03:02:00,730 --> 03:02:05,790
I would never guess such a cute ghost could be the author behind such beloved literature.

3859
03:02:06,270 --> 03:02:08,170
I just had to give my first Super.

3860
03:02:08,430 --> 03:02:08,990
Buzz Buzz.

3861
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:10,430
Thank you buddy.

3862
03:02:12,450 --> 03:02:13,570
Thank you.

3863
03:02:14,010 --> 03:02:14,890
A heart.

3864
03:02:15,270 --> 03:02:15,870
Let's see this one.

3865
03:02:18,730 --> 03:02:19,350
A heart.

3866
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:21,150
A letter turned upside down.

3867
03:02:23,050 --> 03:02:25,850
A letter turned upside down.

3868
03:02:25,970 --> 03:02:27,950
And a hand that's red.

3869
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:31,090
The doll's...no, that's the bear, not the skelly.

3870
03:02:32,950 --> 03:02:33,990
Which...what is it?

3871
03:02:35,710 --> 03:02:37,130
The second hand on the clock.

3872
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:42,990
A hand that's red.

3873
03:02:44,210 --> 03:02:44,770
Nice!

3874
03:02:51,570 --> 03:02:54,250
Had to think outside of human hands.

3875
03:02:56,350 --> 03:02:56,730
I know.

3876
03:02:56,730 --> 03:03:01,010
Only two more missing from the ghost machine.

3877
03:03:01,270 --> 03:03:02,030
Ghost machine!

3878
03:03:03,790 --> 03:03:05,210
Ghost in the machine.

3879
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:05,970
Boobs.

3880
03:03:08,650 --> 03:03:09,170
Alright.

3881
03:03:10,010 --> 03:03:11,010
Oh my gosh, wait.

3882
03:03:11,990 --> 03:03:13,510
It's actually Doobie's hat.

3883
03:03:18,270 --> 03:03:18,790
Tascado!

3884
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:20,530
Oh, thanks for 7 months.

3885
03:03:20,750 --> 03:03:21,350
Thank you, thank you.

3886
03:03:22,210 --> 03:03:23,610
Let's do this one first.

3887
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:24,730
Let's just get it out of the way.

3888
03:03:25,710 --> 03:03:26,790
I'm scared.

3889
03:03:26,970 --> 03:03:27,510
Oh Aiba.

3890
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:43,480
It's going so fast.

3891
03:03:55,640 --> 03:04:00,680
Done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done.

3892
03:04:01,140 --> 03:04:02,840
You're so good at saying thanks.

3893
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:03,140
Thanks!

3894
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:06,380
30 seconds, exactly.

3895
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:10,380
Eyeball.

3896
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:11,040
Hand.

3897
03:04:13,320 --> 03:04:13,980
Hand.

3898
03:04:15,140 --> 03:04:15,800
Hand.

3899
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:18,020
Hand.

3900
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:18,840
Sexy hand.

3901
03:04:18,980 --> 03:04:19,360
Hand.

3902
03:04:23,280 --> 03:04:23,800
Hand.

3903
03:04:23,940 --> 03:04:24,620
Oh, sorry.

3904
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:26,620
I got excited over the one hand.

3905
03:04:26,620 --> 03:04:27,500
Baby hand.

3906
03:04:30,320 --> 03:04:30,840
Hands.

3907
03:04:32,300 --> 03:04:35,760
Come on!

3908
03:04:36,020 --> 03:04:36,900
Give me what I need.

3909
03:04:37,020 --> 03:04:37,420
Hand.

3910
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:39,140
Hand.

3911
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:41,460
Hands.

3912
03:04:43,460 --> 03:04:45,800
Give me what... Oh my gosh, there are still so many left.

3913
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:46,940
Hand.

3914
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:49,800
Give me what I need.

3915
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:50,460
Hand.

3916
03:04:50,460 --> 03:04:50,500
Hand.

3917
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,300
Hand.

3918
03:04:53,640 --> 03:04:54,120
Hand.

3919
03:04:54,360 --> 03:04:55,040
Oh I missed it.

3920
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:55,360
No!

3921
03:05:00,660 --> 03:05:01,440
OK guys.

3922
03:05:01,940 --> 03:05:02,300
Pray.

3923
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:03,580
Pray.

3924
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:07,260
You're pretty good.

3925
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:09,140
Thanks poverty Miko.

3926
03:05:09,340 --> 03:05:10,960
Thanks for 7 months.

3927
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:15,120
Lame.

3928
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:15,960
Lame.

3929
03:05:16,840 --> 03:05:17,360
Blink.

3930
03:05:17,640 --> 03:05:17,960
Blink.

3931
03:05:18,280 --> 03:05:18,540
Blink.

3932
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:24,800
I can't tell sometimes which ones I've already clicked and which ones I haven't.

3933
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:29,980
I know that it turns red, but sometimes it's hard for me to...

3934
03:05:29,980 --> 03:05:30,500
Oh no!

3935
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:35,320
You can't blame me for that one.

3936
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:40,780
I feel like that one, that was so tricky.

3937
03:05:41,380 --> 03:05:43,280
That one was put... Oh my goodness.

3938
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:49,180
Come on.

3939
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:49,800
Nice.

3940
03:05:50,040 --> 03:05:50,400
Nice.

3941
03:05:51,820 --> 03:05:52,840
Come on.

3942
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:56,300
Come on!

3943
03:05:57,700 --> 03:05:59,220
I can and I will.

3944
03:05:59,360 --> 03:05:59,640
No!

3945
03:06:05,900 --> 03:06:07,160
Yes we can.

3946
03:06:07,240 --> 03:06:07,540
No!

3947
03:06:10,060 --> 03:06:11,320
Minky gaming!

3948
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:11,680
Yeah!

3949
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:16,560
One more!

3950
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:18,200
Let's go!

3951
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:19,780
Oh.

3952
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:23,320
Creepy collection.

3953
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:25,880
Minky!

3954
03:06:27,460 --> 03:06:28,680
Minky out.

3955
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:29,660
Siege!

3956
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:31,080
Thanks for 7 months.

3957
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:32,580
Alright, last one guys.

3958
03:06:33,380 --> 03:06:38,100
I see the bow tie.

3959
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:41,440
Two letter B's.

3960
03:06:42,300 --> 03:06:42,720
Letter B.

3961
03:06:45,700 --> 03:06:46,740
Letter B.

3962
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:48,880
One red eye.

3963
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,600
Four wheels.

3964
03:06:55,920 --> 03:06:56,400
One wheel.

3965
03:06:58,400 --> 03:07:00,000
This level always scares me as it can.

3966
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:00,560
Me too!

3967
03:07:02,140 --> 03:07:03,220
It's so funny.

3968
03:07:03,460 --> 03:07:06,540
It's so funny what things scare us when now it's just like...

3969
03:07:06,540 --> 03:07:09,220
There is no jump scares in this game, you know?

3970
03:07:09,760 --> 03:07:10,840
So it's like...

3971
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:14,560
Like there is no reason to get scared.

3972
03:07:14,980 --> 03:07:15,460
Oh a belt.

3973
03:07:16,500 --> 03:07:17,920
Thanks for 5 months!

3974
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:20,700
A metal key.

3975
03:07:24,840 --> 03:07:25,520
Pencil.

3976
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:31,160
Wooden pin.

3977
03:07:31,640 --> 03:07:32,500
I think that counts, yeah.

3978
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:34,860
A wooden pin.

3979
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:43,060
One red eye.

3980
03:07:47,800 --> 03:07:49,840
Two letter...we got the one letter B.

3981
03:07:50,220 --> 03:07:51,840
I just need one more.

3982
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,360
Where are...

3983
03:07:54,360 --> 03:07:55,100
Four wheels.

3984
03:07:55,180 --> 03:07:55,840
We got two.

3985
03:07:59,480 --> 03:08:01,200
A metal key.

3986
03:08:04,480 --> 03:08:05,720
Mint pie!

3987
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:07,000
Thank you!

3988
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:10,760
Thank you very much.

3989
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:11,520
I appreciate it.

3990
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:12,660
A wheel!

3991
03:08:14,760 --> 03:08:15,200
Oh boo!

3992
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:18,520
Pencils on the...

3993
03:08:19,140 --> 03:08:20,080
Pencils on the right?

3994
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:21,700
Where you see it?

3995
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,060
Where you see it?

3996
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:25,660
Where?

3997
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:31,240
Oh there is the red eye!

3998
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:33,300
Nice.

3999
03:08:33,640 --> 03:08:35,100
One red eye.

4000
03:08:38,420 --> 03:08:39,260
Pencil.

4001
03:08:53,250 --> 03:08:54,590
Thank you guys!

4002
03:08:55,770 --> 03:08:56,330
A pencil.

4003
03:08:59,190 --> 03:09:00,310
Four wheels.

4004
03:09:00,470 --> 03:09:01,070
A wheel.

4005
03:09:01,710 --> 03:09:02,670
We got two wheels.

4006
03:09:04,670 --> 03:09:05,570
Another wheel.

4007
03:09:07,090 --> 03:09:08,210
Three wheels.

4008
03:09:08,430 --> 03:09:10,250
We need a three and a whale.

4009
03:09:10,710 --> 03:09:11,390
Oh there is a whale!

4010
03:09:12,310 --> 03:09:13,310
Where is Waldo's stream deck?

4011
03:09:13,490 --> 03:09:14,870
That would be so fun.

4012
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:18,010
I wanna do like the Nancy Drew games too.

4013
03:09:18,590 --> 03:09:21,350
Since they are also missing or hidden object games.

4014
03:09:21,770 --> 03:09:23,410
I love hidden object games.

4015
03:09:24,550 --> 03:09:26,990
But maybe they are not like the most interesting streams.

4016
03:09:29,090 --> 03:09:30,050
A three!

4017
03:09:30,430 --> 03:09:31,230
Oh my gosh.

4018
03:09:32,450 --> 03:09:33,010
A three.

4019
03:09:34,190 --> 03:09:35,890
Alright, one more wheel guys!

4020
03:09:36,010 --> 03:09:37,170
One more wheel!

4021
03:09:38,810 --> 03:09:40,290
Wheel, wheel, wheel.

4022
03:09:40,570 --> 03:09:42,170
Wheel, wheel, wheel.

4023
03:09:42,170 --> 03:09:44,070
We got those two.

4024
03:09:44,170 --> 03:09:44,870
Is this wheel?

4025
03:09:45,250 --> 03:09:45,570
No.

4026
03:09:50,810 --> 03:09:52,090
Try the suitcase.

4027
03:09:52,710 --> 03:09:55,730
For a wheel?

4028
03:09:56,470 --> 03:09:57,330
The cat?

4029
03:09:58,750 --> 03:09:59,390
Oh wait!

4030
03:09:59,890 --> 03:10:00,450
Oh my gosh.

4031
03:10:00,550 --> 03:10:02,590
The second wheel was down there!

4032
03:10:04,490 --> 03:10:06,230
I see what you mean.

4033
03:10:06,510 --> 03:10:07,010
Oh my gosh.

4034
03:10:12,170 --> 03:10:13,450
Good job guys!

4035
03:10:15,110 --> 03:10:16,950
And that's our final piece.

4036
03:10:22,670 --> 03:10:26,770
Time to start the ghost machine!

4037
03:10:29,530 --> 03:10:30,350
Let's go!

4038
03:10:32,430 --> 03:10:36,330
There is only one Nancy Drew game I've ever played and it's the one about the...

4039
03:10:36,330 --> 03:10:36,990
I'm sorry.

4040
03:10:37,150 --> 03:10:39,750
It's the one about the haunted Ryokan.

4041
03:10:42,590 --> 03:10:43,990
I'm such a loser!

4042
03:10:46,550 --> 03:10:48,290
It's really good though.

4043
03:10:50,370 --> 03:10:51,290
Yo, Mito!

4044
03:10:51,510 --> 03:10:52,530
Yo, Chaotic Snow!

4045
03:10:55,190 --> 03:10:59,010
Follow the plans to put the parts in place.

4046
03:11:00,030 --> 03:11:02,630
OK Oh!

4047
03:11:03,130 --> 03:11:03,790
Wait, my bad.

4048
03:11:04,070 --> 03:11:05,370
Sorry, I thought that would get rid of the...OK.

4049
03:11:05,650 --> 03:11:06,550
Follow the plans.

4050
03:11:06,710 --> 03:11:07,750
This one goes here.

4051
03:11:08,210 --> 03:11:09,350
This goes here.

4052
03:11:09,470 --> 03:11:10,190
What else we got?

4053
03:11:11,130 --> 03:11:12,650
We got our little S.

4054
03:11:14,130 --> 03:11:15,970
Our little S goes here.

4055
03:11:17,530 --> 03:11:21,910
A magnet and S goes there.

4056
03:11:23,290 --> 03:11:24,450
Magnet goes here.

4057
03:11:24,970 --> 03:11:25,970
S goes here.

4058
03:11:26,410 --> 03:11:27,610
Oh sorry, S goes here.

4059
03:11:28,590 --> 03:11:30,750
I wonder what kind of ghost we are making you guys.

4060
03:11:31,990 --> 03:11:33,590
Ever thought about playing Fear?

4061
03:11:33,810 --> 03:11:35,270
It could be a hidden object game.

4062
03:11:35,490 --> 03:11:36,970
I have played Fear before.

4063
03:11:37,410 --> 03:11:38,710
I really liked it.

4064
03:11:40,650 --> 03:11:44,530
That drippy thing and that drippy thing.

4065
03:11:45,070 --> 03:11:45,950
This.

4066
03:11:48,250 --> 03:11:50,630
A star and diamond.

4067
03:11:58,340 --> 03:12:00,320
Yeah, see this is a drippy thing.

4068
03:12:01,060 --> 03:12:01,380
Funnel.

4069
03:12:02,480 --> 03:12:02,720
Yeah.

4070
03:12:04,380 --> 03:12:05,700
Yeah, shut up.

4071
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:07,580
Shut up, you guys.

4072
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:09,520
A wind cork.

4073
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:12,100
Wind cork.

4074
03:12:17,940 --> 03:12:18,660
This.

4075
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:19,380
Tube.

4076
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:20,300
Ferris wheel.

4077
03:12:21,580 --> 03:12:22,560
Ferris wheel.

4078
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:24,360
Tube.

4079
03:12:25,180 --> 03:12:25,860
Dial.

4080
03:12:26,180 --> 03:12:27,320
Alright, here you go guys.

4081
03:12:27,940 --> 03:12:29,140
The final piece.

4082
03:12:33,400 --> 03:12:34,780
I'm going to get summoned.

4083
03:12:36,020 --> 03:12:38,740
Ah, the ghost machine is fixed.

4084
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:42,880
Now you can use it to make some very spooky ghosts.

4085
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:45,940
Start by clicking button number 1.

4086
03:12:46,600 --> 03:12:47,420
Wait, why can't I?

4087
03:12:47,480 --> 03:12:48,180
Oh, start?

4088
03:12:48,840 --> 03:12:50,120
What if I pick 4?

4089
03:12:52,020 --> 03:12:52,700
Rusty.

4090
03:12:53,640 --> 03:13:01,200
To make this ghost, you have to fill these jars by finding ingredients that I've hidden around the house.

4091
03:13:01,460 --> 03:13:02,040
No way.

4092
03:13:02,060 --> 03:13:05,880
Here's a clue for the first ingredient you have to find.

4093
03:13:06,380 --> 03:13:09,940
Go and find 2 crooked nails please.

4094
03:13:09,940 --> 03:13:13,600
They're in a cabinet filled with keys.

4095
03:13:16,900 --> 03:13:19,100
Cabinet filled with keys?

4096
03:13:28,760 --> 03:13:30,380
This one.

4097
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:31,740
Rusty nails.

4098
03:13:33,800 --> 03:13:34,580
These ones.

4099
03:13:36,240 --> 03:13:38,120
2 crooked nails.

4100
03:13:38,200 --> 03:13:38,600
Got them.

4101
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:41,720
A spring is next on your list.

4102
03:13:42,100 --> 03:13:42,860
So go look.

4103
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:44,960
It rests on the...

4104
03:13:44,960 --> 03:13:46,860
Floor and right next to a book.

4105
03:13:47,820 --> 03:13:49,120
Wait, on the floor?

4106
03:13:49,820 --> 03:13:51,160
Wait, in here?

4107
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:53,360
Oh no?

4108
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:56,120
Oh wait, I remember where it is.

4109
03:13:56,140 --> 03:13:56,680
It's in here.

4110
03:13:57,780 --> 03:13:58,140
Here.

4111
03:14:00,100 --> 03:14:00,920
I remember.

4112
03:14:01,380 --> 03:14:01,600
Alright.

4113
03:14:02,120 --> 03:14:04,460
How many things do I need for each ghost?

4114
03:14:09,020 --> 03:14:09,640
Fireplace.

4115
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:11,340
Nice!

4116
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:12,180
I got it.

4117
03:14:12,220 --> 03:14:13,100
It was behind my body.

4118
03:14:15,820 --> 03:14:17,740
How many are there?

4119
03:14:20,260 --> 03:14:22,020
This one also was behind me.

4120
03:14:22,760 --> 03:14:26,880
Remember the little wheels I said that were in the spiderweb?

4121
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:28,700
I got them.

4122
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:30,100
2 gears.

4123
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:38,620
Rusty!

4124
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:40,660
Rusty!

4125
03:14:41,220 --> 03:14:42,760
Rusty, Rusty, Rusty!

4126
03:14:43,060 --> 03:14:45,700
Oh my gosh, there is a little switch right behind my head.

4127
03:14:45,740 --> 03:14:46,780
I'm sorry, I can't show you.

4128
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:47,240
Go!

4129
03:14:56,050 --> 03:14:57,490
It's getting really pixelated.

4130
03:15:15,970 --> 03:15:18,610
I have to make all 7 of them?

4131
03:15:19,650 --> 03:15:20,170
Holy...

4132
03:15:20,170 --> 03:15:23,350
Ok, let's start with number 1 then.

4133
03:15:23,730 --> 03:15:24,450
Oh my god.

4134
03:15:25,270 --> 03:15:25,790
Shadow.

4135
03:15:29,910 --> 03:15:30,130
Me!

4136
03:15:32,250 --> 03:15:33,490
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

4137
03:15:33,790 --> 03:15:35,330
Ok, I remember seeing this one.

4138
03:15:36,230 --> 03:15:37,290
One bat.

4139
03:15:37,970 --> 03:15:39,930
Now find a flashlight.

4140
03:15:40,370 --> 03:15:42,050
It's in a stair post.

4141
03:15:42,390 --> 03:15:45,290
Then you'll be ready to take this...

4142
03:15:45,290 --> 03:15:46,550
Nice.

4143
03:15:46,990 --> 03:15:50,410
One flashlight to see the ghost.

4144
03:15:50,490 --> 03:15:51,390
Let's go back!

4145
03:15:52,470 --> 03:15:53,190
Go!

4146
03:15:54,390 --> 03:16:00,310
I want to see Shadow the Hedge...Shadow the Ghost...Shadow the Hedge Ghost.

4147
03:16:00,650 --> 03:16:03,310
Shadow the...Shadow the Ghost Dog.

4148
03:16:03,310 --> 03:16:03,890
No!

4149
03:16:04,570 --> 03:16:05,170
Shadow!

4150
03:16:08,330 --> 03:16:10,510
He has arms like me!

4151
03:16:13,470 --> 03:16:15,330
It gets so pixelated.

4152
03:16:18,490 --> 03:16:20,250
Next is...that's not a ghost.

4153
03:16:20,430 --> 03:16:20,890
That's a place.

4154
03:16:23,550 --> 03:16:25,630
Ok, behind...Curtains, curtains, curtains.

4155
03:16:26,030 --> 03:16:27,430
We are speedrunning this guys.

4156
03:16:27,990 --> 03:16:29,870
Curtains are where the broken bone is.

4157
03:16:29,870 --> 03:16:30,210
Right here.

4158
03:16:31,370 --> 03:16:31,990
I got it.

4159
03:16:33,310 --> 03:16:34,390
One broken bone.

4160
03:16:37,410 --> 03:16:39,970
Oh and right here, right here.

4161
03:16:40,630 --> 03:16:45,310
RIP R.I.P

4162
03:16:48,450 --> 03:16:50,110
Next to the fire.

4163
03:16:51,470 --> 03:16:52,390
Right here!

4164
03:16:53,170 --> 03:16:53,690
Nice!

4165
03:16:56,170 --> 03:16:57,890
We are releasing all the ghosts!

4166
03:16:58,270 --> 03:16:59,850
We are releasing the ghosts!

4167
03:16:59,850 --> 03:17:02,910
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

4168
03:17:03,010 --> 03:17:04,010
Graveyard ghost, go!

4169
03:17:05,130 --> 03:17:05,570
Snack!

4170
03:17:05,970 --> 03:17:06,670
Welcome to membership!

4171
03:17:07,010 --> 03:17:07,270
Thank you!

4172
03:17:12,130 --> 03:17:13,510
It gets real pixelated.

4173
03:17:14,230 --> 03:17:15,850
I don't know how it looks like on stream.

4174
03:17:18,230 --> 03:17:20,350
Oh my god, this guy is really creepy.

4175
03:17:21,590 --> 03:17:23,470
Oh no, his arms broke.

4176
03:17:23,990 --> 03:17:24,930
Oh, sorry guy.

4177
03:17:25,430 --> 03:17:26,650
That's so sad for him.

4178
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:30,290
I'm the final block.

4179
03:17:30,570 --> 03:17:31,290
Tick tock!

4180
03:17:31,630 --> 03:17:34,730
An hourglass teeters on the arm of a chair.

4181
03:17:35,530 --> 03:17:36,250
Go find it.

4182
03:17:36,330 --> 03:17:37,790
At the top of the stairs.

4183
03:17:38,290 --> 03:17:38,830
An hourglass.

4184
03:17:39,790 --> 03:17:40,410
This one!

4185
03:17:41,190 --> 03:17:42,010
We got it.

4186
03:17:42,650 --> 03:17:43,570
One hourglass.

4187
03:17:43,590 --> 03:17:45,250
His arms broke, it's so sad.

4188
03:17:45,310 --> 03:17:48,210
An alarm clock is the next thing you need.

4189
03:17:49,090 --> 03:17:50,190
Alarm clock.

4190
03:17:51,170 --> 03:17:52,030
Got it!

4191
03:17:53,010 --> 03:17:53,690
Nice!

4192
03:17:54,490 --> 03:17:54,910
Next!

4193
03:17:54,910 --> 03:17:56,490
Give me the next thing!

4194
03:17:56,750 --> 03:17:57,730
Come on Skelly!

4195
03:18:01,770 --> 03:18:03,870
Shelf with the 7th ghost book.

4196
03:18:04,770 --> 03:18:05,210
In here?

4197
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:08,650
They

4198
03:18:14,430 --> 03:18:15,670
are haunting the place now!

4199
03:18:19,850 --> 03:18:25,470
Has anyone mentioned how eerily similar this narrator and the truth from FMA Brotherhood might be the same person?

4200
03:18:26,070 --> 03:18:27,270
Rusty is here!

4201
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:29,330
He's skeeting in the study.

4202
03:18:32,330 --> 03:18:34,290
Where is the other ghost then?

4203
03:18:35,310 --> 03:18:36,690
I think he's up here.

4204
03:18:37,190 --> 03:18:37,690
I'm scared.

4205
03:18:43,750 --> 03:18:44,650
Tick tock time!

4206
03:18:46,270 --> 03:18:46,950
Go!

4207
03:18:51,650 --> 03:18:52,730
Here we go!

4208
03:18:52,910 --> 03:18:53,450
Here we go!

4209
03:18:57,590 --> 03:18:58,570
Tick tock!

4210
03:19:07,460 --> 03:19:08,500
Oh no, it's time!

4211
03:19:09,960 --> 03:19:10,160
Go!

4212
03:19:12,160 --> 03:19:13,860
What a dumb ghost.

4213
03:19:14,240 --> 03:19:15,240
Alright, number 5!

4214
03:19:18,460 --> 03:19:21,340
Wind up mouse?

4215
03:19:21,460 --> 03:19:23,040
It's near a tall clock.

4216
03:19:23,860 --> 03:19:25,100
Tall clock.

4217
03:19:25,240 --> 03:19:26,040
Was there one in here?

4218
03:19:27,220 --> 03:19:27,740
Oh wait!

4219
03:19:27,820 --> 03:19:28,120
Duh!

4220
03:19:28,660 --> 03:19:29,360
In here!

4221
03:19:30,400 --> 03:19:30,840
Meow!

4222
03:19:30,840 --> 03:19:31,180
Meow!

4223
03:19:38,240 --> 03:19:39,880
Piece of cheese!

4224
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:43,060
It's behind my head, sorry.

4225
03:19:44,580 --> 03:19:45,800
I wish it was the hot dog.

4226
03:19:49,460 --> 03:19:50,360
Cat eyes?

4227
03:19:50,380 --> 03:19:52,180
They are in a picture on the wall.

4228
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:55,560
I like how he peeks around the corner.

4229
03:19:55,680 --> 03:19:55,980
Oh!

4230
03:19:56,280 --> 03:19:57,880
We are stealing this cat's eyes!

4231
03:19:58,440 --> 03:19:59,560
Oh my god!

4232
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:03,020
That's so sad!

4233
03:20:08,540 --> 03:20:10,760
On a shelf full of dolls.

4234
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:13,780
We are too good at this game guys.

4235
03:20:14,660 --> 03:20:16,120
It was also behind me a little bit.

4236
03:20:16,560 --> 03:20:17,700
You might have seen it.

4237
03:20:19,660 --> 03:20:20,860
Meow, meow, meow!

4238
03:20:21,240 --> 03:20:22,440
I want to go make a meow!

4239
03:20:22,860 --> 03:20:23,820
Meow, meow, meow!

4240
03:20:25,680 --> 03:20:27,020
Let's make a meow!

4241
03:20:27,020 --> 03:20:27,100
Meow!

4242
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:33,840
I can't believe I've gotten 3 and a half hours of content out of this game.

4243
03:20:35,580 --> 03:20:37,640
I cannot believe it.

4244
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:40,280
Cute!

4245
03:20:41,840 --> 03:20:42,560
Cute!

4246
03:20:45,100 --> 03:20:46,340
Oh my gosh, paws!

4247
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:48,720
Looks just like her.

4248
03:20:51,360 --> 03:20:52,700
Alright, number 6.

4249
03:20:52,800 --> 03:20:54,060
Wait, but there is a 7th one.

4250
03:20:54,540 --> 03:20:55,780
I can't...

4251
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:56,260
Ew!

4252
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:03,780
I...

4253
03:21:04,520 --> 03:21:05,720
What about the 7th one?

4254
03:21:05,760 --> 03:21:07,160
I can't touch it.

4255
03:21:08,020 --> 03:21:09,460
It's somewhere in the library.

4256
03:21:11,360 --> 03:21:12,720
The eyeball on top of a book.

4257
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:17,020
Why is Rusty in here but we haven't seen anybody else?

4258
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:20,300
7th one is me.

4259
03:21:21,600 --> 03:21:22,920
Oh, I know this one.

4260
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:24,200
The snake under the bed.

4261
03:21:24,560 --> 03:21:25,480
I saw him earlier.

4262
03:21:26,180 --> 03:21:27,080
He is right here.

4263
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:29,220
The cat!

4264
03:21:30,620 --> 03:21:31,100
Cute!

4265
03:21:32,620 --> 03:21:34,120
Under a marble sink.

4266
03:21:34,200 --> 03:21:35,080
We know that one.

4267
03:21:36,300 --> 03:21:37,440
Any ghosts in here?

4268
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:38,260
Besides me?

4269
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:41,700
No?

4270
03:21:41,700 --> 03:21:45,900
Go to the trunk and open it.

4271
03:21:46,980 --> 03:21:47,600
Looked it up.

4272
03:21:47,640 --> 03:21:50,140
The narrator was Amy Birnbaum.

4273
03:21:50,420 --> 03:21:54,020
Who didn't do Brotherhood, but has a few anime voices.

4274
03:21:54,100 --> 03:21:55,560
Yeah, someone mentioned Pokemon earlier.

4275
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:56,620
Like Ash's brother.

4276
03:21:56,860 --> 03:21:57,240
Or, sorry.

4277
03:21:57,760 --> 03:21:59,040
Ouch, I just bit my tongue again.

4278
03:21:59,460 --> 03:22:00,120
Mei's brother.

4279
03:22:00,800 --> 03:22:01,240
Yu-Gi-Oh.

4280
03:22:01,480 --> 03:22:02,600
Wow, Yu-Gi-Oh even.

4281
03:22:06,900 --> 03:22:09,300
There is a big bug in hiding.

4282
03:22:09,480 --> 03:22:10,440
Wait, in the trunk, right?

4283
03:22:12,780 --> 03:22:14,100
This is the trunk, right?

4284
03:22:16,300 --> 03:22:17,220
Oh, sorry.

4285
03:22:17,340 --> 03:22:19,240
It looked like a beetle.

4286
03:22:19,740 --> 03:22:21,480
It looked like a beetle so I thought it was something.

4287
03:22:23,120 --> 03:22:24,120
Hop to a window.

4288
03:22:24,860 --> 03:22:24,860
OK.

4289
03:22:27,240 --> 03:22:27,700
Spoiler.

4290
03:22:28,640 --> 03:22:29,440
Spoiler, spoiler.

4291
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:30,860
Is there anybody in here?

4292
03:22:33,300 --> 03:22:33,760
Graveyard!

4293
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:36,300
Cute!

4294
03:22:37,980 --> 03:22:39,940
We are just stealing this whole ass frog.

4295
03:22:42,460 --> 03:22:43,940
I want to see...OK, wait.

4296
03:22:44,300 --> 03:22:46,160
So we made TickTock.

4297
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:49,260
Let's go look at the clock and see if TickTock is here.

4298
03:22:51,820 --> 03:22:52,220
Yeah!

4299
03:22:52,920 --> 03:22:54,700
Oh, you are kind of on top of him, but that's OK.

4300
03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:57,120
What other ones have we made?

4301
03:22:58,860 --> 03:22:59,260
Graveyard?

4302
03:23:03,540 --> 03:23:03,940
Rusty?

4303
03:23:05,080 --> 03:23:06,340
Yeah, Graveyard is in the Graveyard.

4304
03:23:06,580 --> 03:23:07,840
Shadow in the secret room.

4305
03:23:08,060 --> 03:23:08,620
Oh, OK.

4306
03:23:08,660 --> 03:23:09,340
Let's go check it out.

4307
03:23:11,880 --> 03:23:12,280
Shadow.

4308
03:23:20,630 --> 03:23:21,430
So cute!

4309
03:23:22,190 --> 03:23:26,010
I guess we might have seen him if we did the final ghost, but whatever.

4310
03:23:26,410 --> 03:23:27,570
I just wanted to see him anyway.

4311
03:23:28,090 --> 03:23:28,650
Alright, go!

4312
03:23:37,970 --> 03:23:38,370
Critter!

4313
03:23:38,470 --> 03:23:39,510
It's going to be an ugly bug!

4314
03:23:39,550 --> 03:23:40,390
It's going to be Matoricon!

4315
03:23:41,330 --> 03:23:42,110
Oh my God!

4316
03:23:45,170 --> 03:23:46,770
Is it going to eat it?

4317
03:23:46,930 --> 03:23:48,330
So gently!

4318
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:53,560
Number 7!

4319
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,440
That's so creepy!

4320
03:24:11,940 --> 03:24:12,380
Oh!

4321
03:24:12,860 --> 03:24:13,580
That's so funny.

4322
03:24:13,800 --> 03:24:19,860
Oh my gosh, I remember as a kid being so scared of the way he would say get out.

4323
03:24:20,080 --> 03:24:21,320
I would be so scared of that.

4324
03:24:22,960 --> 03:24:25,700
I would be like... Wait, do we have to find all the ghosts now?

4325
03:24:26,960 --> 03:24:27,860
All the ghosts we summoned.

4326
03:24:28,020 --> 03:24:32,260
We summoned these guys just to capture them again and use them for our own gain.

4327
03:24:35,940 --> 03:24:36,500
Shadow.

4328
03:24:36,500 --> 03:24:37,060
Shadow.

4329
03:24:37,320 --> 03:24:38,320
Look out the window.

4330
03:24:38,480 --> 03:24:39,060
Oh my God!

4331
03:24:39,100 --> 03:24:40,720
We really are just stealing them back.

4332
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:44,200
Wait, I know where all of them are though.

4333
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:46,400
Graveyard.

4334
03:24:49,020 --> 03:24:50,800
We are making the ultimate ghost.

4335
03:24:51,300 --> 03:24:52,480
Ghost Exodia!

4336
03:24:53,300 --> 03:24:54,040
Hurry up!

4337
03:24:54,560 --> 03:24:55,180
Tick Tock!

4338
03:24:56,620 --> 03:25:00,480
You'll face him on the biggest clock.

4339
03:25:07,280 --> 03:25:08,360
Tick Tock.

4340
03:25:09,180 --> 03:25:13,040
Find a bell on a book and you'll find Rusty too.

4341
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:16,680
Look upstairs.

4342
03:25:16,800 --> 03:25:17,720
He's waiting for you.

4343
03:25:17,800 --> 03:25:18,000
Sorry.

4344
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:19,940
I'm sorry that I'm skipping through all the rhymes.

4345
03:25:20,280 --> 03:25:22,220
I'm just so excited to get through everything.

4346
03:25:22,840 --> 03:25:24,480
I'm impatient in this part.

4347
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:27,200
I'm like... Let's just go.

4348
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:27,820
Let's grab him.

4349
03:25:29,500 --> 03:25:30,040
Rusty.

4350
03:25:30,040 --> 03:25:30,580
Rusty.

4351
03:25:30,600 --> 03:25:32,120
This searching is tough.

4352
03:25:32,620 --> 03:25:33,900
Are you tired now?

4353
03:25:34,500 --> 03:25:36,040
Oh yeah, let's go find the meow.

4354
03:25:39,460 --> 03:25:39,920
Rusty.

4355
03:25:41,320 --> 03:25:43,700
No, the cat should be saying meow meow.

4356
03:25:49,900 --> 03:25:51,760
I guess that's in the kitchen.

4357
03:25:51,900 --> 03:25:52,440
I imagine.

4358
03:25:52,720 --> 03:25:52,980
Right?

4359
03:25:54,640 --> 03:25:57,040
It's the last one we haven't seen where he stays at.

4360
03:25:57,100 --> 03:25:57,820
Oh my gosh!

4361
03:25:57,840 --> 03:25:58,600
So cute!

4362
03:25:59,780 --> 03:26:01,400
He's just kind of looking in there.

4363
03:26:01,400 --> 03:26:02,360
Oh my gosh!

4364
03:26:02,400 --> 03:26:02,980
We got them all!

4365
03:26:08,040 --> 03:26:08,600
Wait,

4366
03:26:12,520 --> 03:26:15,940
are we throwing skeleton into the... We're throwing skeleton into the pot.

4367
03:26:16,920 --> 03:26:18,780
Skeleton is our final ingredient.

4368
03:26:21,720 --> 03:26:22,580
No way.

4369
03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:23,800
Skeleton don't do it!

4370
03:26:24,040 --> 03:26:25,360
Don't sacrifice yourself!

4371
03:26:25,360 --> 03:26:27,040
Oh my god!

4372
03:26:28,640 --> 03:26:30,920
He's going to sacrifice himself.

4373
03:26:35,360 --> 03:26:36,600
No skeleton!

4374
03:26:37,940 --> 03:26:39,860
Oh my gosh, you see them all in the little thing.

4375
03:26:39,940 --> 03:26:40,560
That's so cute.

4376
03:26:41,720 --> 03:26:42,780
Alright, skeleton.

4377
03:26:43,580 --> 03:26:45,220
You guys, 07s.

4378
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:47,380
07s for skeleton.

4379
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:51,600
No, he's doing it for us.

4380
03:26:52,420 --> 03:26:53,000
Skeleton!

4381
03:26:57,180 --> 03:26:58,020
Skeleton!

4382
03:26:58,720 --> 03:27:00,000
Here we go.

4383
03:27:00,440 --> 03:27:03,320
Time to get out.

4384
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:07,800
Oh my god!

4385
03:27:08,220 --> 03:27:09,480
Oh my god!

4386
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:11,500
We're grinding him up.

4387
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:13,480
We're electrifying him.

4388
03:27:13,880 --> 03:27:14,560
Oh my god.

4389
03:27:19,070 --> 03:27:21,290
He's a skeleton ghost!

4390
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:35,640
This spooky night is ending.

4391
03:27:36,020 --> 03:27:37,340
It's almost dawn.

4392
03:27:37,920 --> 03:27:40,420
The time has come to say goodbye.

4393
03:27:41,300 --> 03:27:43,460
You've mastered this game of spooky.

4394
03:27:43,820 --> 03:27:44,340
I spy.

4395
03:27:45,540 --> 03:27:46,120
Yay!

4396
03:27:46,360 --> 03:27:47,060
Oh he waved.

4397
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:48,240
Sorry, I was covering it.

4398
03:27:48,600 --> 03:27:49,800
The end!

4399
03:27:51,460 --> 03:27:52,100
Yay!

4400
03:27:57,810 --> 03:28:00,170
To us, skeleton will always be a diamond dog.

4401
03:28:00,530 --> 03:28:01,010
I won't.

4402
03:28:01,130 --> 03:28:01,990
I won't.

4403
03:28:01,990 --> 03:28:05,550
I won't spread your ashes to the solar sea.

4404
03:28:06,990 --> 03:28:07,510
Skeleton!

4405
03:28:07,510 --> 03:28:08,030
Skeleton!

4406
03:28:11,310 --> 03:28:12,150
Great game.

4407
03:28:12,230 --> 03:28:13,350
That was so fun.

4408
03:28:13,770 --> 03:28:14,690
Oh we did it.

4409
03:28:14,750 --> 03:28:15,550
We 100%ed.

4410
03:28:16,350 --> 03:28:18,830
I spy spooky mansion.

4411
03:28:20,570 --> 03:28:22,110
Heaven's divide starts playing.

4412
03:28:24,910 --> 03:28:26,590
That was so fun.

4413
03:28:26,750 --> 03:28:29,550
I'm gonna... I don't know if the game is just gonna...

4414
03:28:30,570 --> 03:28:34,450
I don't know if it's just gonna quit out, so I'm going to do this.

4415
03:28:34,450 --> 03:28:38,010
And then I'll just see what happens if it quits or...

4416
03:28:38,010 --> 03:28:38,430
Oh yep!

4417
03:28:38,730 --> 03:28:38,990
Yep!

4418
03:28:39,230 --> 03:28:39,530
Yep!

4419
03:28:39,650 --> 03:28:42,590
It immediately exited and would've showed my screen.

4420
03:28:45,330 --> 03:28:46,650
Oh there we go.

4421
03:28:46,750 --> 03:28:47,030
Okay.

4422
03:28:48,970 --> 03:28:51,670
It immediately showed my desktop.

4423
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:52,750
That's so funny.

4424
03:28:54,410 --> 03:28:54,930
Woo!

4425
03:28:54,990 --> 03:28:55,630
I called it.

4426
03:28:55,710 --> 03:29:01,450
Like there's no... Because I knew there was no menu for this game or anything like that, so I figured it would...

4427
03:29:02,310 --> 03:29:05,470
Just kind of blip out of existence.

4428
03:29:06,330 --> 03:29:08,890
What is the desktop hiding?

4429
03:29:09,690 --> 03:29:11,550
Nothing much.

4430
03:29:11,610 --> 03:29:15,530
We got... I spy spooky mansion.

4431
03:29:18,050 --> 03:29:20,230
There was one thing that was really funny.

4432
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:24,350
I had a... I had a sticky note open.

4433
03:29:24,870 --> 03:29:29,150
That's been open of the whole set list for Phantom Thief Concert.

4434
03:29:31,470 --> 03:29:34,690
So that would've been really silly if that had been leaked.

4435
03:29:36,770 --> 03:29:38,650
Corey has waken up and stolen the car.

4436
03:29:38,670 --> 03:29:39,770
What do you mean woken up?

4437
03:29:44,490 --> 03:29:46,810
Can you imagine if that...

4438
03:29:47,970 --> 03:29:52,830
I just have it like... I had it like pinned to my desktop, so...

4439
03:29:52,830 --> 03:29:54,270
That's actually something.

4440
03:29:54,410 --> 03:29:55,830
Yeah, that would've been a wild leak.

4441
03:29:55,830 --> 03:30:00,250
I like saw it almost right before I started streaming.

4442
03:30:00,410 --> 03:30:01,110
I was like...

4443
03:30:01,110 --> 03:30:02,570
I need to get rid of that.

4444
03:30:06,450 --> 03:30:08,730
I would've probably actually cried.

4445
03:30:09,350 --> 03:30:14,310
No, I mean like... I think leaking a set list isn't... Well, not leaking, but like...

4446
03:30:14,310 --> 03:30:17,830
I think telling people part of a set list isn't always a bad thing because...

4447
03:30:18,630 --> 03:30:21,250
Especially for like...

4448
03:30:21,990 --> 03:30:24,530
For, you know, I guess...

4449
03:30:24,530 --> 03:30:28,730
For like in our case, neither of us have an original song.

4450
03:30:29,410 --> 03:30:35,450
So, for artists where it's like... Oh, it's all the artists' own original songs.

4451
03:30:35,470 --> 03:30:38,530
You know what songs that they might play and you know like...

4452
03:30:38,530 --> 03:30:43,610
Oh, I'm gonna do... I know how to do like mixes and stuff to these...

4453
03:30:43,610 --> 03:30:46,690
To the, you know, artists' original songs.

4454
03:30:46,930 --> 03:30:52,270
But like, for us, like... I mean, the set list is like absolutely wild.

4455
03:30:52,270 --> 03:30:56,190
You guys are not... You guys are not prepared at all, but...

4456
03:30:58,890 --> 03:30:59,290
But...

4457
03:31:00,310 --> 03:31:06,170
For this, I almost wanna tell some songs just so people can learn mixes for some of them, you know?

4458
03:31:09,390 --> 03:31:12,830
Can you show us your desktop now in a controlled environment, so to say?

4459
03:31:13,830 --> 03:31:17,810
I can show you... What am I gonna show you?

4460
03:31:17,990 --> 03:31:19,190
There's nothing on it.

4461
03:31:19,190 --> 03:31:23,150
I have like... I have really nothing on it.

4462
03:31:23,250 --> 03:31:25,470
It's nothing interesting, actually.

4463
03:31:30,530 --> 03:31:31,530
I'm looking.

4464
03:31:31,710 --> 03:31:33,590
I'm like seriously like there's nothing here.

4465
03:31:35,610 --> 03:31:36,570
There's seri... Oh!

4466
03:31:37,410 --> 03:31:38,750
There's seriously nothing here.

4467
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:42,350
Let's go to my cafe.

4468
03:31:43,970 --> 03:31:45,870
It's been a minute since we've been there.

4469
03:31:49,190 --> 03:31:50,410
La la la la la.

4470
03:31:50,970 --> 03:31:51,850
La la la.

4471
03:31:52,030 --> 03:31:53,050
La la la la la.

4472
03:31:58,170 --> 03:31:59,850
You went back inside.

4473
03:32:00,190 --> 03:32:01,630
You made him sacrifice, boss.

4474
03:32:01,750 --> 03:32:02,070
No!

4475
03:32:02,630 --> 03:32:03,010
No!

4476
03:32:03,550 --> 03:32:04,390
It's on me!

4477
03:32:07,730 --> 03:32:08,410
Hold on.

4478
03:32:09,150 --> 03:32:09,810
I want my arms.

4479
03:32:12,210 --> 03:32:12,690
Okay.

4480
03:32:12,690 --> 03:32:14,250
And... Music.

4481
03:32:14,530 --> 03:32:15,510
Music, music, music.

4482
03:32:18,470 --> 03:32:20,410
Oh my gosh, I can fix my desktop.

4483
03:32:20,730 --> 03:32:21,870
I can fix everything now.

4484
03:32:22,150 --> 03:32:22,790
Oh, my windows.

4485
03:32:25,530 --> 03:32:26,970
Music, music, music.

4486
03:32:27,090 --> 03:32:27,810
It's so quiet.

4487
03:32:27,970 --> 03:32:28,330
So quiet.

4488
03:32:28,510 --> 03:32:28,770
So quiet.

4489
03:32:41,940 --> 03:32:43,540
3D debut still on there?

4490
03:32:43,680 --> 03:32:44,140
Why not?

4491
03:32:45,340 --> 03:32:46,400
I did have that.

4492
03:32:48,060 --> 03:32:48,580
Murph!

4493
03:32:48,620 --> 03:32:49,860
Thanks for 7 months!

4494
03:32:51,440 --> 03:32:55,700
I did have a 3D... 3.0... Not 3D.

4495
03:32:56,060 --> 03:32:56,900
Not yet.

4496
03:32:58,340 --> 03:32:59,220
Not yet.

4497
03:32:59,800 --> 03:33:00,280
Soon.

4498
03:33:00,480 --> 03:33:00,740
Hopefully.

4499
03:33:00,940 --> 03:33:01,340
One day.

4500
03:33:03,700 --> 03:33:05,080
MGSCon mid-roll advertisement.

4501
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:06,860
Oh, maybe we should put that, right?

4502
03:33:08,720 --> 03:33:12,600
Oh my gosh, this game completely broke my... The UI on my computer.

4503
03:33:13,420 --> 03:33:15,660
Like... Everything's all messy.

4504
03:33:16,400 --> 03:33:22,160
I was going to play Space Marine 2, but this evening was... Watching you wiggle to these goofy sounds in glasses was too cute.

4505
03:33:23,080 --> 03:33:24,420
Thanks, Liquid Toast!

4506
03:33:24,740 --> 03:33:25,960
Okay, so thanks for the 5 gifted!

4507
03:33:28,020 --> 03:33:32,100
Guys, I'm still trying to finish my schedule for the week, but I'm not sure what to do on Saturday.

4508
03:33:33,860 --> 03:33:38,580
I can show you what I have right now, but I'm still not sure what to do for Saturday.

4509
03:33:38,720 --> 03:33:39,100
Hold on.

4510
03:33:42,560 --> 03:33:44,360
Uh... Hold on.

4511
03:33:49,810 --> 03:33:51,570
Let me export it.

4512
03:33:53,450 --> 03:33:55,630
How do I export it?

4513
03:33:55,750 --> 03:33:56,310
Oh, here we go.

4514
03:34:05,780 --> 03:34:07,320
What's... 11.25.

4515
03:34:08,460 --> 03:34:09,320
Let's see.

4516
03:34:14,790 --> 03:34:15,550
Schedules.

4517
03:34:15,930 --> 03:34:17,570
So this is what I have.

4518
03:34:18,630 --> 03:34:23,530
So it can't be something super duper long, because I'm doing a double stream that day.

4519
03:34:26,350 --> 03:34:31,030
Tomorrow... I was going to play Holocure tonight, because I've been really wanting to play, but I've been too busy.

4520
03:34:31,190 --> 03:34:34,330
So I'm like, the only way I can play Holocure is if it's on stream.

4521
03:34:35,290 --> 03:34:39,030
Wednesday, I'm not sure if I'm going to be streaming, because Matara will be coming in.

4522
03:34:41,510 --> 03:34:45,410
So, it's really depending on what we're doing.

4523
03:34:45,670 --> 03:34:48,510
Like, we might go out for dinner or something like that, you know.

4524
03:34:49,090 --> 03:34:51,550
Thursday, no stream.

4525
03:34:51,910 --> 03:34:52,170
Sorry.

4526
03:34:52,490 --> 03:34:52,870
Thanksgiving.

4527
03:34:53,650 --> 03:34:55,170
And Matara is coming for Thanksgiving.

4528
03:34:55,550 --> 03:34:57,710
And then Friday, off collab with Matawa.

4529
03:34:59,810 --> 03:35:04,270
And then Saturday, I have stream and then Patreon stream.

4530
03:35:05,190 --> 03:35:06,010
The evening.

4531
03:35:06,590 --> 03:35:07,930
But I'm not sure what to do on Saturday.

4532
03:35:09,510 --> 03:35:11,130
Why is there an apology on Friday?

4533
03:35:11,310 --> 03:35:14,870
Because I'm subjecting you to MataraCon on my channel.

4534
03:35:18,110 --> 03:35:18,550
Basically.

4535
03:35:20,410 --> 03:35:21,250
Dates are wrong?

4536
03:35:21,330 --> 03:35:23,150
Oh, that's because it's not finished.

4537
03:35:25,090 --> 03:35:26,670
That's because I haven't finished it.

4538
03:35:31,520 --> 03:35:31,960
Matara.

4539
03:35:34,240 --> 03:35:36,400
I usually change the dates at the very end.

4540
03:35:36,500 --> 03:35:38,560
Here, I'll do it now, just because you brought it up.

4541
03:35:42,140 --> 03:35:42,600
27.

4542
03:35:44,260 --> 03:35:44,720
28.

4543
03:35:46,820 --> 03:35:47,520
Oh, wait.

4544
03:35:47,840 --> 03:35:48,780
Oh, 27, 28.

4545
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:50,460
29.

4546
03:35:53,460 --> 03:35:54,260
Wait a second.

4547
03:35:58,940 --> 03:35:59,400
Wait.

4548
03:36:01,080 --> 03:36:02,980
Oh, 29 is here.

4549
03:36:03,200 --> 03:36:03,880
We're skipping 28.

4550
03:36:03,940 --> 03:36:05,840
I was like, wait a second, this goes to December 1st.

4551
03:36:06,180 --> 03:36:08,260
30 and then 01.

4552
03:36:08,500 --> 03:36:09,080
Okay, there we go.

4553
03:36:10,820 --> 03:36:12,720
Yeah, I'm not sure what to do.

4554
03:36:15,740 --> 03:36:17,360
My friendly neighborhood.

4555
03:36:18,700 --> 03:36:21,720
It's Sesame Street meets Resident Evil.

4556
03:36:22,140 --> 03:36:24,140
Oh, I've heard of that before.

4557
03:36:27,460 --> 03:36:30,520
I think I would want to do that in one go though.

4558
03:36:30,800 --> 03:36:33,260
That's from like last year or the year before, right?

4559
03:36:44,350 --> 03:36:46,030
Maybe we can start DMC3.

4560
03:36:46,810 --> 03:36:49,010
But I would want to stream that for longer, I think.

4561
03:36:49,950 --> 03:36:51,770
I think I would want to stream it for longer.

4562
03:36:51,890 --> 03:36:53,110
That's where my dilemma comes.

4563
03:36:53,710 --> 03:36:57,210
Because I'm like, hmm, something that I can stream for just a little bit.

4564
03:36:58,530 --> 03:36:58,970
You know?

4565
03:37:06,450 --> 03:37:07,590
I'll figure out something.

4566
03:37:11,370 --> 03:37:12,170
More Holocure.

4567
03:37:13,030 --> 03:37:13,490
Is it okay?

4568
03:37:13,990 --> 03:37:15,250
We can do the maid gun game.

4569
03:37:15,510 --> 03:37:17,430
I was gonna do that the week after this.

4570
03:37:17,770 --> 03:37:20,750
Since I had maid cafe on Electric Street this week.

4571
03:37:27,380 --> 03:37:28,300
Hot dog.

4572
03:37:28,460 --> 03:37:29,500
Hot dog!

4573
03:37:30,400 --> 03:37:32,040
I have a question about the concert.

4574
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:35,680
Will you and Doki be able to use your 3D models afterwards?

4575
03:37:36,580 --> 03:37:38,940
Will you both have 3D debut streams sometimes in the future?

4576
03:37:39,200 --> 03:37:40,380
Sorry if you can't say right now.

4577
03:37:41,780 --> 03:37:42,680
No, that's a good question.

4578
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:44,300
I can't say for Doki.

4579
03:37:47,900 --> 03:37:48,820
For me...

4580
03:37:49,400 --> 03:37:52,160
I would like to do a 3D debut stream.

4581
03:37:53,100 --> 03:37:55,040
For me, it's a little complicated.

4582
03:37:57,980 --> 03:38:01,300
I like the model that I'm getting now.

4583
03:38:02,220 --> 03:38:03,920
I think it looks very good.

4584
03:38:04,700 --> 03:38:07,220
But I think it might... Because it was kind of rushed...

4585
03:38:08,480 --> 03:38:11,560
I feel that it might look great on stage.

4586
03:38:12,120 --> 03:38:16,360
But for normal streaming, I'm not entirely sure.

4587
03:38:17,200 --> 03:38:22,660
So I actually am commissioning another 3D model.

4588
03:38:25,400 --> 03:38:27,440
It's actually in the works.

4589
03:38:28,680 --> 03:38:32,480
It's with a team that I originally wanted to go with.

4590
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:36,440
But...

4591
03:38:36,440 --> 03:38:39,820
They wouldn't have been able to finish in time for the concert.

4592
03:38:41,760 --> 03:38:43,040
Don't get me wrong.

4593
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:46,340
I think the modeler who is making the one for the concert...

4594
03:38:46,340 --> 03:38:47,500
It still looks very good.

4595
03:38:49,860 --> 03:38:57,580
And I think for it, I will release it so people can make silly videos if they'd like to or whatever.

4596
03:38:57,820 --> 03:39:01,700
If you want to put me in Left 4 Dead 2 or stuff like that.

4597
03:39:02,900 --> 03:39:04,000
Buy wallet.

4598
03:39:04,420 --> 03:39:08,340
It's because I really want you guys to have high quality.

4599
03:39:14,380 --> 03:39:15,860
New 3D model.

4600
03:39:16,060 --> 03:39:17,120
Thank you.

4601
03:39:19,300 --> 03:39:20,080
I...

4602
03:39:21,680 --> 03:39:23,420
Had a dream once.

4603
03:39:23,760 --> 03:39:26,500
Where I got a 3D model.

4604
03:39:27,520 --> 03:39:31,460
And I really didn't like it.

4605
03:39:32,180 --> 03:39:37,940
And I felt that compared to other 3D models, it was not good.

4606
03:39:37,940 --> 03:39:43,660
It had less detail compared to the other 3D models.

4607
03:39:43,820 --> 03:39:44,840
And it made me really sad.

4608
03:39:44,940 --> 03:39:47,720
And I wasn't able to use the 3D model for a very long time.

4609
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:50,140
And then I asked them to change it.

4610
03:39:50,280 --> 03:39:53,140
And all they did was change the hair color just a tiny bit.

4611
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:55,160
But I had to wait an entire year for that to happen.

4612
03:39:55,660 --> 03:39:58,160
And they didn't even make any of the changes that I asked about.

4613
03:39:58,400 --> 03:40:00,820
And then I only got to use it like two times.

4614
03:40:00,860 --> 03:40:01,980
And then I woke up from the dream.

4615
03:40:05,140 --> 03:40:07,160
So I was really frustrated about it.

4616
03:40:07,520 --> 03:40:08,060
In the dream.

4617
03:40:08,620 --> 03:40:09,440
And I thought...

4618
03:40:10,120 --> 03:40:14,240
I want to have a really good proper 3D that I can use.

4619
03:40:16,740 --> 03:40:17,620
Yes, yes.

4620
03:40:18,960 --> 03:40:20,180
Yes, yes, yes.

4621
03:40:21,220 --> 03:40:21,780
So...

4622
03:40:21,780 --> 03:40:22,540
Sorry.

4623
03:40:22,920 --> 03:40:27,240
But like I said, it's not impossible that I won't use it on stream.

4624
03:40:28,460 --> 03:40:29,020
But...

4625
03:40:29,020 --> 03:40:31,580
I would like to have a 3D debut.

4626
03:40:31,580 --> 03:40:33,020
With a proper one.

4627
03:40:33,420 --> 03:40:36,780
Or rather with the second one I'm getting commissioned.

4628
03:40:37,720 --> 03:40:38,600
Dreams are crazy.

4629
03:40:38,740 --> 03:40:39,640
I know, right?

4630
03:40:39,780 --> 03:40:41,060
Thank goodness it was just a dream.

4631
03:40:46,380 --> 03:40:47,820
Very specific dream.

4632
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:53,940
I was so angry after that dream.

4633
03:40:54,880 --> 03:40:57,040
I wish I could remember my dreams in that much detail.

4634
03:40:57,040 --> 03:41:04,380
If I may ask something.

4635
03:41:04,460 --> 03:41:06,640
Do you own any other media from Ace Combat franchise?

4636
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:08,740
Something like a game collection or music OST.

4637
03:41:09,140 --> 03:41:11,560
I own the soundtrack of Ace Combat 7.

4638
03:41:15,440 --> 03:41:16,640
Welcome to membership.

4639
03:41:16,780 --> 03:41:17,440
Thank you.

4640
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:19,940
Thank you, thank you.

4641
03:41:22,300 --> 03:41:24,080
Give your concert model to Kana Uru.

4642
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:25,900
Oh gosh, I'm afraid what he'll do.

4643
03:41:28,220 --> 03:41:30,980
Like I said, I'm probably gonna find a way to...

4644
03:41:30,980 --> 03:41:33,220
Make it so other people can use it in general.

4645
03:41:34,760 --> 03:41:35,900
For, like I said...

4646
03:41:36,680 --> 03:41:38,920
Silly videos if anybody would like to make.

4647
03:41:39,780 --> 03:41:42,420
As long as you don't fall and show up for anything.

4648
03:41:43,960 --> 03:41:44,400
Yeah.

4649
03:41:46,340 --> 03:41:48,200
That would be the most replayed part.

4650
03:41:48,400 --> 03:41:49,920
That would be so embarrassing.

4651
03:41:55,640 --> 03:41:57,460
Don't you own an Ace Combat...

4652
03:41:58,240 --> 03:41:58,960
Stick controller?

4653
03:41:59,060 --> 03:42:00,960
Oh, I saw one but I didn't buy it.

4654
03:42:02,100 --> 03:42:03,000
It might still be available.

4655
03:42:03,720 --> 03:42:05,200
He will hurl you into a river.

4656
03:42:05,400 --> 03:42:07,160
No, I will throw him into the river.

4657
03:42:08,940 --> 03:42:09,200
Me.

4658
03:42:13,760 --> 03:42:14,160
Me.

4659
03:42:20,100 --> 03:42:20,900
Made violence.

4660
03:42:25,400 --> 03:42:25,800
So...

4661
03:42:26,540 --> 03:42:27,880
But thanks for the question, Berlet.

4662
03:42:31,540 --> 03:42:33,180
Mito, have you tried any Sonic games?

4663
03:42:33,180 --> 03:42:36,400
Oh yeah, before I went to heaven...

4664
03:42:36,400 --> 03:42:37,560
I actually played Sonic.

4665
03:42:39,440 --> 03:42:42,180
It's a privated VOD now.

4666
03:42:43,020 --> 03:42:44,280
But yeah, I did play Sonic.

4667
03:42:49,190 --> 03:42:50,790
Wasn't it hard of them throwing you though?

4668
03:42:51,150 --> 03:42:52,970
Yeah, but like, I'm gonna throw him in.

4669
03:43:00,020 --> 03:43:01,960
I will not let him win.

4670
03:43:07,790 --> 03:43:09,610
I remember your Ace Attorney run too.

4671
03:43:09,810 --> 03:43:12,070
Apparently, Ace Attorney...

4672
03:43:12,070 --> 03:43:16,870
Before Ghost Babble was my longest stream on my channel.

4673
03:43:17,450 --> 03:43:19,350
It was 11 and a half hours.

4674
03:43:20,310 --> 03:43:23,470
Because I was finishing the last chapter of...

4675
03:43:23,470 --> 03:43:24,370
The last game.

4676
03:43:25,790 --> 03:43:28,070
Which Ace Attorney is so...

4677
03:43:28,930 --> 03:43:30,450
So much reading.

4678
03:43:32,630 --> 03:43:33,430
So...

4679
03:43:33,430 --> 03:43:34,870
So much reading.

4680
03:43:41,010 --> 03:43:42,610
So much reading.

4681
03:43:43,770 --> 03:43:44,070
Yeah.

4682
03:43:45,170 --> 03:43:48,690
That's a hell of a game to stream for that long considering it's mostly words.

4683
03:43:48,910 --> 03:43:49,170
Right?

4684
03:43:49,970 --> 03:43:51,290
It's only words.

4685
03:43:53,870 --> 03:43:57,870
Like, I narrated all of Ghost Babble, but...

4686
03:44:00,230 --> 03:44:01,950
I don't think I could do it now.

4687
03:44:01,950 --> 03:44:07,370
Before, I had a full time haunting, so I was able to...

4688
03:44:07,950 --> 03:44:08,730
Do both.

4689
03:44:09,550 --> 03:44:10,950
Are my glasses too small?

4690
03:44:12,090 --> 03:44:12,590
Hold on.

4691
03:44:18,580 --> 03:44:19,600
Or are they too big?

4692
03:44:29,570 --> 03:44:30,290
But yeah.

4693
03:44:30,550 --> 03:44:32,450
Now, since I...

4694
03:44:32,450 --> 03:44:35,470
You know, and at my full time haunting, I didn't really have to use...

4695
03:44:35,470 --> 03:44:36,630
I didn't have to talk much.

4696
03:44:36,850 --> 03:44:38,670
I just had to sometimes be like...

4697
03:44:40,530 --> 03:44:41,490
And sometimes...

4698
03:44:43,130 --> 03:44:45,430
Like the occasional moan.

4699
03:44:45,570 --> 03:44:47,670
Occasional, like, boo.

4700
03:44:48,510 --> 03:44:49,430
Everything like that.

4701
03:44:49,810 --> 03:44:54,470
But now I talk all the time on stream, so I don't think I could talk for that long.

4702
03:44:56,610 --> 03:45:00,010
You know, I don't think I could narrate for that long.

4703
03:45:00,670 --> 03:45:02,750
Like that much narration.

4704
03:45:04,330 --> 03:45:05,970
Yeah, occasional moan.

4705
03:45:06,790 --> 03:45:07,810
Just ghost things.

4706
03:45:11,750 --> 03:45:12,750
Yep, yep, yep.

4707
03:45:12,990 --> 03:45:13,890
Yep, yep, yep.

4708
03:45:14,270 --> 03:45:15,130
Yep, yep, yep.

4709
03:45:15,610 --> 03:45:16,270
Yep, yep, yep.

4710
03:45:17,270 --> 03:45:17,670
Yep, yep, yep.

4711
03:45:18,130 --> 03:45:21,730
I know Vtubers already have throat issues, right?

4712
03:45:25,050 --> 03:45:27,210
So many Vtubers already have throat problems.

4713
03:45:28,450 --> 03:45:28,930
So...

4714
03:45:30,010 --> 03:45:30,490
Probably...

4715
03:45:30,490 --> 03:45:32,130
Wouldn't be great for me.

4716
03:45:34,230 --> 03:45:36,650
Can you teach us how to moan and haunt?

4717
03:45:40,050 --> 03:45:40,930
It's like...

4718
03:45:40,930 --> 03:45:41,790
But you like...

4719
03:45:41,790 --> 03:45:43,210
Moaning is like an instinct.

4720
03:45:43,370 --> 03:45:44,710
A ghost instinct, you know?

4721
03:45:45,870 --> 03:45:46,230
Right?

4722
03:45:49,010 --> 03:45:51,050
Heard of the Luka song...

4723
03:45:51,050 --> 03:45:53,610
Wait, you asked this yesterday, didn't you?

4724
03:45:54,590 --> 03:45:56,290
Dancer in the Dark by Fatman P?

4725
03:45:57,090 --> 03:45:57,970
Yeah, I...

4726
03:45:57,970 --> 03:45:59,250
Wait, I answered your question.

4727
03:45:59,470 --> 03:46:00,690
Why'd you send another super chat?

4728
03:46:01,350 --> 03:46:04,470
I said that I hadn't heard of it, but I'll look into it.

4729
03:46:05,810 --> 03:46:06,630
I guess thanks for asking.

4730
03:46:06,630 --> 03:46:07,390
Thanks for reminding me.

4731
03:46:07,670 --> 03:46:10,790
But you didn't have to send another super chat about it.

4732
03:46:13,610 --> 03:46:16,110
It's like it wasn't designed for Ace Combat and mine.

4733
03:46:16,410 --> 03:46:17,910
The games are more controller focused.

4734
03:46:18,310 --> 03:46:19,070
Just for collection.

4735
03:46:21,150 --> 03:46:22,750
I like to collect things.

4736
03:46:25,510 --> 03:46:26,710
I like to collect.

4737
03:46:27,010 --> 03:46:27,610
Maybe they forgot.

4738
03:46:27,910 --> 03:46:28,210
Maybe.

4739
03:46:28,870 --> 03:46:29,210
Stop.

4740
03:46:29,590 --> 03:46:29,970
Don't.

4741
03:46:30,470 --> 03:46:31,830
Drink and super chat.

4742
03:46:36,840 --> 03:46:37,820
Hi, VTuber.

4743
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:39,340
As per my previous super chat.

4744
03:46:46,070 --> 03:46:50,170
I think, guys, I'm going to...

4745
03:46:50,170 --> 03:46:50,650
Head out.

4746
03:46:54,750 --> 03:46:55,490
One second.

4747
03:47:00,470 --> 03:47:01,670
Dopey just added me.

4748
03:47:02,010 --> 03:47:04,050
Or rather, she sent me a request on Discord.

4749
03:47:04,770 --> 03:47:05,330
Yippee.

4750
03:47:07,230 --> 03:47:11,150
I was previously communicating with her via Twitter DMs.

4751
03:47:11,250 --> 03:47:13,390
Which is not ideal.

4752
03:47:15,770 --> 03:47:17,170
Don't drink and super chat.

4753
03:47:17,470 --> 03:47:18,450
Super chat, then drink.

4754
03:47:21,390 --> 03:47:23,430
Have a good rest of your day, Mito.

4755
03:47:23,710 --> 03:47:25,190
You guys as well.

4756
03:47:25,890 --> 03:47:27,050
Tomorrow we will...

4757
03:47:29,150 --> 03:47:29,710
Holocure.

4758
03:47:30,210 --> 03:47:31,910
And tomorrow we'll beat stage 4.

4759
03:47:31,910 --> 03:47:35,170
I have not been able to beat stage 4 yet, so...

4760
03:47:35,170 --> 03:47:37,750
I want to play Holocure so bad, but I've just been too busy.

4761
03:47:39,250 --> 03:47:39,790
So...

4762
03:47:39,790 --> 03:47:40,510
Sober super.

4763
03:47:42,310 --> 03:47:43,390
Thanks, Ashes.

4764
03:47:45,410 --> 03:47:45,790
Tomorrow.

4765
03:47:47,270 --> 03:47:47,710
Tomorrow.

4766
03:47:52,540 --> 03:47:53,820
It is rough.

4767
03:47:53,900 --> 03:47:54,980
I got...

4768
03:47:54,980 --> 03:47:56,840
I got to...

4769
03:47:56,840 --> 03:47:58,720
The furthest I've gotten is like...

4770
03:48:09,430 --> 03:48:10,670
I think it was like...

4771
03:48:11,310 --> 03:48:12,290
16 minutes.

4772
03:48:13,190 --> 03:48:14,250
Then I died.

4773
03:48:14,690 --> 03:48:16,130
Thanks for the fun and silly stream.

4774
03:48:16,250 --> 03:48:16,850
Love the glasses.

4775
03:48:17,010 --> 03:48:17,850
Thank you!

4776
03:48:19,050 --> 03:48:20,470
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4777
03:48:24,730 --> 03:48:25,250
Yeah.

4778
03:48:25,550 --> 03:48:27,370
Have a good night, you guys.

4779
03:48:27,810 --> 03:48:28,990
Have a good day, have a good night.

4780
03:48:29,630 --> 03:48:31,810
And I'll catch you guys later.

4781
03:48:39,410 --> 03:48:40,870
You guys doing okay lately?

4782
03:48:45,940 --> 03:48:47,620
I wasn't sure if I went through yesterday.

4783
03:48:47,920 --> 03:48:48,600
Oh no!

4784
03:48:50,880 --> 03:48:51,700
Oh no!

4785
03:48:52,100 --> 03:48:52,860
I'm sorry!

4786
03:48:55,700 --> 03:48:56,760
Thanks for the stream, Mito.

4787
03:48:57,260 --> 03:48:58,220
Thank you!

4788
03:48:58,940 --> 03:49:00,160
Glad you like the glasses.

4789
03:49:05,900 --> 03:49:06,600
Nerd.

4790
03:49:07,380 --> 03:49:08,220
I'm a nerd.

4791
03:49:09,520 --> 03:49:10,340
So are you.

4792
03:49:11,400 --> 03:49:12,720
We're all nerds.

4793
03:49:12,740 --> 03:49:14,780
Nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds.

4794
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:18,360
Points at you, nerd.

4795
03:49:18,480 --> 03:49:19,540
Points at you, nerd!

4796
03:49:32,340 --> 03:49:35,940
See you later!

4797
03:49:37,080 --> 03:49:37,520
Bye bye!

4798
03:49:37,620 --> 03:49:39,400
Oh, actually...

4799
03:49:39,400 --> 03:49:40,940
We haven't done this in a minute.

4800
03:49:43,740 --> 03:49:45,200
It's been a minute.

4801
03:49:48,940 --> 03:49:49,900
It's been a minute.

4802
03:49:56,920 --> 03:49:59,320
I don't know...

4803
03:49:59,320 --> 03:50:00,560
Am I gonna get... Wait.

4804
03:50:01,160 --> 03:50:02,620
Let's turn it down a little bit.

4805
03:50:03,900 --> 03:50:04,960
Oh yeah!

4806
03:50:07,940 --> 03:50:09,440
Thanks for the feed!

4807
03:50:10,700 --> 03:50:11,920
Thanks for the fun stream.

4808
03:50:12,120 --> 03:50:13,660
I'm glad you guys liked it.

4809
03:50:13,900 --> 03:50:15,720
If there's something strange...

4810
03:50:15,720 --> 03:50:17,160
Sleeping in your bed.

4811
03:50:19,660 --> 03:50:20,960
Let me tell you something.

4812
03:50:22,040 --> 03:50:24,120
If there's something weird...

4813
03:50:24,120 --> 03:50:25,560
Sleeping in your bed.

4814
03:50:26,180 --> 03:50:28,340
Let me tell you something.

4815
03:50:44,260 --> 03:50:47,240
Maybe some people... It's been a while since I've done this.

4816
03:50:47,620 --> 03:50:49,560
So maybe some people don't know, but...

4817
03:50:50,380 --> 03:50:54,180
Before Heaven, I used to end all my streams with Bustin.

4818
03:50:55,560 --> 03:50:57,840
If you're seeing things...

4819
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:59,080
Sleeping in your bed.

4820
03:51:04,060 --> 03:51:05,500
Invisible man.

4821
03:51:06,180 --> 03:51:07,480
Sleeping in your bed.

4822
03:51:08,280 --> 03:51:09,920
Let me tell you something.

4823
03:51:12,580 --> 03:51:14,740
So happy I finally got a stream.

4824
03:51:15,100 --> 03:51:16,460
Thank you Doodling!

4825
03:51:18,040 --> 03:51:20,660
Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin...

4826
03:51:20,660 --> 03:51:25,380
Makes me feel good, feel good, feel good...

4827
03:51:30,740 --> 03:51:37,200
Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin...

4828
03:51:37,200 --> 03:51:41,660
Makes me feel good, feel good, feel good...

4829
03:51:48,370 --> 03:51:50,910
Freaky Ghost Maid!

4830
03:51:52,590 --> 03:51:55,010
Freaky Ghost Maid!

4831
03:51:56,790 --> 03:51:58,750
Freaky Maid, baby!

4832
03:52:02,330 --> 03:52:04,130
I hope you're all alone.

4833
03:52:04,890 --> 03:52:05,990
Let me sleep in your bed.

4834
03:52:10,680 --> 03:52:12,490
Let me tell you something.

4835
03:52:13,390 --> 03:52:15,490
Sleeping makes me feel good.

4836
03:52:21,690 --> 03:52:23,410
I'm afraid of no bed.

4837
03:52:23,410 --> 03:52:26,210
I try to fit these on my face.

4838
03:52:26,270 --> 03:52:27,010
There we go.

4839
03:52:27,930 --> 03:52:29,110
Invisible bed.

4840
03:52:30,610 --> 03:52:32,450
Freaky Ghost Maid.

4841
03:52:35,610 --> 03:52:36,990
They're a little awkward.

4842
03:52:37,310 --> 03:52:39,470
Oh gosh, I can't get them to work, you guys.

4843
03:52:40,050 --> 03:52:41,790
My face is too 2D.

4844
03:52:44,330 --> 03:52:45,590
Makes me feel good.

4845
03:52:47,030 --> 03:52:48,590
They're slipping off my head.

4846
03:52:48,970 --> 03:52:51,270
Feel good, feel good.

4847
03:52:51,270 --> 03:52:52,450
Okay, you know what?

4848
03:52:53,870 --> 03:52:54,990
Let's put these like this.

4849
03:52:55,070 --> 03:52:55,930
Bustin, Bustin.

4850
03:52:55,990 --> 03:52:57,670
Now I look like a sexy librarian.

4851
03:53:01,050 --> 03:53:04,930
Makes me feel good, feel good, feel good...

4852
03:53:08,710 --> 03:53:09,190
Yeah!

4853
03:53:09,570 --> 03:53:09,890
Yeah!

4854
03:53:10,090 --> 03:53:10,270
Yeah!

4855
03:53:10,830 --> 03:53:12,090
What if I put these here?

4856
03:53:12,270 --> 03:53:15,350
Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin...

4857
03:53:15,350 --> 03:53:17,650
Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin...

4858
03:53:17,650 --> 03:53:22,550
Makes me feel good, feel good, feel good...

4859
03:53:25,170 --> 03:53:26,010
Yeah!

4860
03:53:26,370 --> 03:53:26,610
Yeah!

4861
03:53:26,870 --> 03:53:27,130
Yeah!

4862
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:30,570
Four eyes!

4863
03:53:32,830 --> 03:53:34,750
Bustin, Bustin, Bustin.

4864
03:53:35,250 --> 03:53:40,770
Feel good, feel good...

4865
03:53:41,350 --> 03:53:43,570
Bustin makes me feel good!

4866
03:53:43,570 --> 03:53:44,390
Thank you everybody!

4867
03:53:44,990 --> 03:53:45,390
Otsumita!

4868
03:53:45,670 --> 03:53:45,730
Bye

4869
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:27,240
bye!

4870
03:54:27,960 --> 03:54:29,260
Thank you for the hunkatono.

4871
03:54:29,660 --> 03:54:30,900
You thought I wouldn't get it, huh?
