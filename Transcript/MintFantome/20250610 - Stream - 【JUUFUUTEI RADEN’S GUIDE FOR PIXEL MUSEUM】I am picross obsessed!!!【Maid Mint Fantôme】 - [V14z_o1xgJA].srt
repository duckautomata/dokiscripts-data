1
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,060
Hello, everybody.

2
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

3
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,840
Howdy.

4
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,880
Hey, y'all.

5
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,820
Wait.

6
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,280
There we go.

7
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,660
I was like, what's wrong with my sound?

8
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,960
I think.

9
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,740
I have phones.

10
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,600
We're weird.

11
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,920
Hello, hello.

12
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,420
Welcome.

13
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,260
In.

14
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,100
Time for some freaking P-Cross, baby.

15
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah!

16
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,260
Yeah!

17
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,640
I'm so excited.

18
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh my gosh.

19
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,220
This game was made for me, I think.

20
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,960
I think so.

21
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,140
I'm so happy.

22
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,900
I'll be honest, though.

23
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,680
I don't know so much about Raden.

24
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:31,960
I know her from, like, some of her memes, but I don't think I've ever watched her before, so...

25
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,320
My brother's been playing this game.

26
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,940
It's awesome.

27
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
I love... First of all, I love P-Cross.

28
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,920
She's like a normal amount.

29
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,380
She's cool.

30
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
She's a big art nerd.

31
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,800
I can tell from the topic of this game.

32
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,600
It's like you go through an art museum and she tells you about it.

33
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,680
I hope I get to know a little bit more about her from this game.

34
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,320
Maybe?

35
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,040
I really love her design, though.

36
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,740
She's so pretty.

37
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,640
And she's got... She's the one with the mask, right?

38
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Yeah.

39
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Right?

40
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,020
Welcome to the P-Cross Cult.

42
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,800
Oh, I've been in the P-Cross Cult.

43
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,680
I've been in the P-Cross Cult.

44
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,880
I literally play Nonograms every day.

45
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,700
I was playing a Nonogram right before stream.

46
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,680
And then I was like...

47
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,140
Wait a second.

48
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,780
I should... I shouldn't... I should stop so that I can play on stream.

49
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,760
Like, not this, obviously, but my own on my phone.

50
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,400
I was like, wait a second.

51
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,540
I... I... I... I should, like, not get burnt out of playing before I play on stream.

52
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,380
Hahaha.

53
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,660
But for those who don't know what the P-Cross is or a Nonogram is...

54
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,860
Um...

55
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,840
It's...

56
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,660
I...

57
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,000
Personally...

58
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,640
This is my opinion.

59
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,170
I personally think it's way more fun than...

60
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,240
Sudoku.

61
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,440
Bleh.

62
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,560
Sudoku.

63
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,280
I may also have been playing Nonograms a few minutes ago.

64
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,740
But what's so much fun about Nonograms is that it makes a picture.

65
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,740
So, it's way more fun to be like putting all your little points in and being like...

66
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,840
What could be this artwork?

67
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,160
It's work.

68
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,820
And then it's...

69
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,100
It's...

70
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,380
A leaf.

71
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,360
I don't know.

72
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,960
More like Sudoku.

73
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Get him!

74
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,640
Sudoku Bros.

75
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,160
Sorry.

76
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,420
Sorry.

77
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,900
Sorry.

78
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,120
But, uh...

79
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,260
Yeah.

80
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,660
Andrey goes, thank you so much for the 20th, Captain.

81
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,660
Thank you!

82
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,740
Thank you, thank you!

83
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,520
Ah...

84
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,460
It's really nice to be rewarded with a picture.

85
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,060
Ah!

86
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,440
It's so nice.

87
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,400
Maybe do the tutorial for the sake of chat.

88
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,820
Is there a tutorial?

89
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,300
I actually haven't started the game yet.

90
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,480
Um...

91
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,420
Also, though...

92
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,160
This is made by Jupiter.

93
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,540
I'm covering it currently, but down here.

94
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
It's made by Jupiter.

95
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,160
They make like the P-Cross series.

96
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,140
But, this is not called P-Cross.

97
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,520
I think P-Cross is like a brand name, technically.

98
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,860
So, the general puzzle is called Nonogram.

99
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,680
And then, P-Cross is like a specific kind of... specific Nonogram...

100
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Uh...

101
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,680
Uh...

102
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,360
Trademark!

103
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,800
And then, this is the same company that makes the really popular ones.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,200
But, since this is not labeled as a P-Cross, I've just been...

106
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,620
They call it like a pixel dot puzzle.

107
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,860
So, just... just to not get...

108
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,940
Raden in trouble or anything, I...

109
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,780
Made sure to refer to it as such.

110
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,600
Except, well...

111
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
I did say that I like P-Cross.

112
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,740
But, I'm not calling this P-Cross.

113
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,660
I don't know.

114
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,820
Japanese...

115
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,640
Japanese companies can be so scary sometimes.

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
Legally distinct.

117
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,060
Ugh.

118
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
I don't want them to come after me.

119
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,240
Or her.

120
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,340
Not that I would think that they would see.

121
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,140
You know what I mean, though?

122
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,220
So confusing.

123
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,440
It's definitely not P-Cross.

124
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,300
Yeah, it's not P-Cross.

125
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,280
Hey, Minky, this is very random.

126
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,340
But I was re-watching the Transformers Devastation 5 and we were talking about...

127
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,360
The...

128
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,100
The...

129
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,900
Rest Force.

130
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,620
I totally neglected to mention that one of the members is named...

131
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,520
Death Cobra.

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,440
And he turns into a high D!

133
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,520
What?!

134
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,620
That's crazy!

135
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,140
Made for me.

136
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,420
This PGM is so elegant, so posh.

137
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,500
Great for the Nonogram Goblin and Minky's brand.

138
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,620
I can't wait to Nonogram.

139
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,340
I am playing this game as I watch this stream.

140
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,460
I think a lot of people...

141
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,080
Have been playing this game.

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,460
But I feel like I've seen no...

143
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,020
VTubers playing this game.

144
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,660
Unless, like...

145
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,680
Hololive JP members have been playing.

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,780
I don't...

147
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,740
I don't know.

148
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm like...

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,820
Uh...

150
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,960
It's P-Cross time.

151
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,420
I mean...

152
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,520
Nope.

153
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,000
I mean...

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,260
Sorry.

155
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,800
It's...

156
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,600
It's...

157
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
PixelDot Puzzle Time.

158
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,160
Everybody!

159
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,760
Uh-oh.

160
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,800
I messed up.

161
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
I messed...

162
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,060
Bleep the wall!

163
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,920
I need...

164
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,420
I need a...

165
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,320
I need one of those...

166
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,120
Sensors.

167
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
The...

168
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,820
I need a delay.

169
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,100
So I can censor myself.

170
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,860
What do you do on rainy days?

171
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,300
I still plan on going to Kobe for the herb garden.

172
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,880
But the...

173
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,760
Forecast for this week is quite gloomy.

174
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,680
In Japan!

175
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,100
Rip on!

176
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,360
In Japan!

177
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,030
When it's rainy...

178
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,030
I go shopping.

179
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,770
It's probably different...

180
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,770
For you though.

181
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,850
I like go to LaForette and I just...

182
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,590
Or...

183
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,090
Window shop.

184
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,440
Okay.

185
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,400
Shall we start?

186
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,540
Let's see if there's a tutorial.

187
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,140
Cute!

188
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,400
I didn't know his voice!

189
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,560
Yes!

190
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,060
Uhhh...

191
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,080
Braden.

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,340
It's like she's really here.

193
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,340
I turned it off, by the way.

194
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,840
I can't wait to learn about art.

195
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,980
We'll become so cultured.

196
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,220
The works are divided into exhibition floors according to themes.

197
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,480
The works are completed by solving the pixel puzzles that then become viewable.

198
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,380
I'm surprised they don't call them nonogram.

199
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,960
Is that like not a popular term anymore?

200
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,420
Nonogram.

201
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,820
You'd think that it would be like...

202
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,500
It'd be so cute in Japanese too, right?

203
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Nonogram.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,940
You know, it'd be so cute to say.

205
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,940
Hmm.

206
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,620
Nonogram is how I've always heard it.

207
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:26,920
Right!

208
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,760
I feel like pixel puzzle is...

209
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,860
A little...

210
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,480
Vague.

211
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,620
Is your white outline new?

212
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,920
It's nice.

213
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,220
Oh!

214
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,640
Thank you for noticing.

215
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,420
I...

216
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,680
Actually...

217
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,740
Had it...

218
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,000
Because I had a different layout for...

219
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,060
My...

220
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,320
Where I was on the screen.

221
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,120
And then...

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,640
Oh, I changed it.

223
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,960
I did it to like kind of...

224
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,660
How do I say...

225
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,220
Hubba hubba hubba

226
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,210
hubba hubba...

227
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,230
Stick out.

228
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,900
Bad contrast.

229
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,380
I guess nonogram is a no-no.

230
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,060
Hahaha.

231
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,420
Is a no-no, graham.

232
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Hubba hubba hubba.

233
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,640
Straight off the sticker street.

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
Oh, it reminds me of Paper Mario!

235
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,260
Ew.

236
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,280
Yeah.

237
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,880
You're right.

238
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,000
Umineko-sounding VGM.

239
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,500
Once you complete the artwork, a photo or illustration accompanies by Curator Rodin's explanations will appear.

240
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,080
Fuji-san.

241
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,760
Do you know the rule of...oh.

242
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,040
Pixel puzzles?

243
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,040
Okay, yeah.

244
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,320
We'll do the tutorial for anybody watching.

245
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,460
That doesn't understand.

246
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,180
Because otherwise, I feel like maybe...

247
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,760
I might start going fast, depending on how easy the beginning puzzles are, you know?

248
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,500
And...and...

249
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,800
You'll be like, what?

250
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,160
Why?

251
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,320
How is she getting this?

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Mint doesn't need to hear all this.

253
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,940
She's a highly trained professional.

254
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,760
Heart Under Blade, happy birthday!

255
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,100
Happy, happy birthday!

256
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Yay!

257
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,120
Thank you so much for this, Super Chat!

258
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm sorry I can't sing!

259
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,940
High fructose...fruc...fruc...fruc...toce...porn syrup.

260
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,300
Welcome to the membership, thank you!

261
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,160
Minta, I love you!

262
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,300
Thank you!

263
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,700
Let's watch the tutorial!

264
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,940
Okay.

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,740
Which control method?

266
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,200
Would you like to...uh, assume mouse?

267
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,900
Okay.

268
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,560
Let's explain the basic rules and concepts of Pixel Puzzle.

269
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,420
Wow.

270
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,960
Five by five.

271
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm a new fan.

272
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,620
Do I need to watch every stream in order to be a real wisp?

273
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,740
Oh my gosh!

274
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,380
Mookie Pilled!

275
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:01,940
Oh my god!

276
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,380
Okay.

277
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,020
That's what's so fun about it.

278
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,240
Everything is out of order!

279
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,980
The timeline?

280
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,120
Okay, hold on.

281
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,740
Let me get my notes.

282
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,810
Okay, so...

283
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,490
Season three...

284
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,710
Is where it all begins.

285
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,490
But actually...

286
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,150
It's a fake-out.

287
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:23,930
Okay?

288
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,430
So...

289
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,790
So...

290
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,710
This stream actually happened in 2008.

291
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,830
Yeah.

292
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,030
Okay.

293
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,450
I'll have to explain it another time.

294
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,270
But you know, you could...

295
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,110
Just don't...

296
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,270
Just don't start...

297
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,590
With season 11.

298
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,830
But you can start anywhere else.

299
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,960
There we go.

300
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,960
Solo!

301
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,860
Happy birthday!

302
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
Well, I've been watching you for over a year now.

303
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,720
Thank you!

304
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,760
You need season eight before you watch season 11.

305
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,900
Season 11.

306
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,340
Season 11 is crazy.

307
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,620
Oh!

308
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,120
Okay.

309
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,780
It's already been a minute and a...

310
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,960
I suck at this game.

311
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,920
So much for the speed run.

312
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,780
Like the original run of Haruhi.

313
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,580
Okay.

314
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,460
We'll be using this puzzle as an example.

315
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,620
It's a bird!

316
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:33,620
Pixel puzzles are a puzzle game where you use the numbers written above and to the left as hints to fill in squares and complete an illustration.

317
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,080
These hints show you the number of connected squares for that row...

318
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,900
Orculum.

319
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
Instructions all clear starting from MGSB.

320
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,900
So, Ghost, thank you so much for the 515...

321
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,640
So, the two squares here...

322
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,560
Are connected to the four squares in this row.

323
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,100
End!

324
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,560
End!

325
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,240
End!

326
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,420
So...

327
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh, it's kinda...

328
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,440
Here, here, here.

329
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,460
See, there's two here.

330
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,220
Three...

331
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,060
And one.

332
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,760
They cannot touch.

333
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,580
See, so one is here and three is here.

334
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,880
When there are multiple, there will always be a gap...

335
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,080
Between the squares represented by each number.

336
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,380
To reveal the hidden picture, use the hints to fill in the correct squares.

337
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,140
Oh, I wanted to do it.

338
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,520
Okay.

339
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,980
Once all correct squares are filled in, the puzzle is solved and a hidden picture will appear.

340
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,550
Let's start here.

341
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,010
Oh, as it's a 5x5 puzzle, this hint means the whole column should be filled in.

342
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,850
Have a go!

343
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,690
I started with Minto, the shores of Tuscany.

344
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,090
I was like, who's Robert?

345
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,610
Well done.

346
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,690
Next, let's look at this row.

347
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,030
Yes, a 3...

348
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,870
So...

349
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,930
There's at least one empty square between them.

350
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,470
Yeah.

351
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,610
Ba-bam!

352
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,130
What if I got it wrong?

353
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,030
Let's try it.

354
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,890
We don't need to fill in this leftover square.

355
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,910
Put an X.

356
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,890
So, right click is X.

357
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,850
One more year in the history books.

358
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,290
J-Max, thank you!

359
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,790
Happy...

360
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,490
Happy birthday!

361
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,790
Happy, happy birthday!

362
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,130
You gotta watch all the made spaghetti films to truly appreciate made mint's character art.

363
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,750
So many birthdays.

364
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,710
Oh, X.

365
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,230
Okay.

366
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,490
Good.

367
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,750
Next, let's look at this row.

368
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,110
Since there's already a square filled in, there are only two ways the lines can be finished.

369
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:48,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

370
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,610
So, we don't...

371
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,330
We'll put in the...

372
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,890
Wait, I'm gonna mess it up on purpose.

373
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,810
And see what happens.

374
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,870
Don't fill in that square!

375
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,870
Oh, okay.

376
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,530
We got it.

377
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,230
Why am I getting Discord messages?

378
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:00,610
Sorry.

379
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:01,570
Hold on.

380
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,490
Discord usually goes into streamer mode.

381
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,310
When I open OBS.

382
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,490
And recently...

383
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,130
It hasn't been doing that.

384
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,910
Streamer mode.

385
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,250
Stop messaging me.

386
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,430
Okay.

387
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,550
Okay.

388
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,750
Okay.

389
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,810
Since we know that...

390
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,370
Okay.

391
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,470
So, if you don't know how PCross works...

392
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,390
Are you kind of...

393
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,970
Understanding?

394
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,550
Xx.

395
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,570
Sometimes it just stops going in the streamer mode.

396
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,750
Yeah, I don't know!

397
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,150
Oh!

398
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,530
It's OBS's fault!

399
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,710
Oh, maybe it's something with OBS that's not triggering it.

400
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,190
They made a change in Discord's backend that makes OBS show up as a game.

401
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,050
Oh, so it is Discord's fault.

402
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,790
It is!

403
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,090
It is Discord's fault then.

404
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,410
They had a fight.

405
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,750
The crows are fighting.

406
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,650
What you always want to do...

407
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,450
Or rather, what's really helpful...

408
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,110
With PCross is getting these...

409
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,950
Is getting the edges.

410
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,830
A.

411
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,570
B.

412
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,450
E.

413
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,350
Always be edging.

414
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,190
Two!

415
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,230
Oh, see?

416
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,450
See?

417
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,170
It can't be there.

418
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,090
So it won't fit.

419
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,790
So we X.

420
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,130
Like that.

421
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,590
Okay.

422
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,630
Watch it.

423
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,310
And then...

424
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,830
We can put them in here.

425
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,250
Sorry, I'm not reading it.

426
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,230
Now I'm going...

427
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,790
It's starting to get a little impatient.

428
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,910
Here, have a look at these examples.

429
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,490
If you think about it carefully...

430
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,870
It is always possible to find the correct pattern.

431
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,590
Yeah, see?

432
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:50,850
See?

433
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,750
So...

434
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,930
If there's...

435
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,130
This many...

436
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,550
And you have six...

437
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,290
Wait, how much is this?

438
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,410
Ten?

439
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,990
Yeah.

440
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,070
If you have ten...

441
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,270
You can fill in the middle two.

442
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,770
Because you know for sure they will always overlap.

443
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,070
And then if you have five...

444
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,030
You can always fill in the middle.

445
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,970
If it's three.

446
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,510
Because...

447
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,210
You'll know it'll always overlap.

448
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,310
Yeah.

449
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,590
Oh, I thought that said 34 for a second.

450
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,150
I was about to be like...

451
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,670
No way.

452
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,810
Okay.

453
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,170
Back to the puzzle.

454
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,350
Okay.

455
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,310
So these...

456
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,310
This we can fill in.

457
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:31,650
See?

458
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,050
This is on an edge we can fill...

459
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,450
Where...

460
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,870
This is already done.

461
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,050
Let me finish it.

462
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,470
Please.

463
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,970
Oh, put an X in the leftover squares.

464
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,490
Oh.

465
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,150
I'm not finishing the puzzle?

466
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,630
Okay.

467
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,790
They do a good job at explaining.

468
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,510
Yeah, they do.

469
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,390
You're almost there.

470
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,890
Go ahead and click...

471
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,130
Oh.

472
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,470
What am I getting...

473
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:04,810
Bird!

474
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,490
Blue bird.

475
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,170
Blue bird.

476
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,210
Seven minutes.

477
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,890
Seven minutes.

478
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,570
Seven minutes for a five by five.

479
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,070
Puzzle.

480
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,470
It's Twitter.

481
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:21,710
Oh.

482
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,510
Ripperoni.

483
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,150
Ittirasshan.

484
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,310
Oh.

485
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,110
She said something.

486
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,510
Sorry.

487
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,410
I was drinking my tea.

488
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,110
Select the input.

489
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,850
Let's do mouse.

490
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:36,850
Okay.

491
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,010
Input method for puzzles has been selected.

492
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,130
You can change it anytime.

493
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,650
Okay, cool.

494
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:41,890
Hajime.

495
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,030
Hajime.

496
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,870
Five.

497
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,490
Four.

498
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,590
Four.

499
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,410
Four.

500
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,310
Four.

501
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:48,990
Four.

502
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,070
See?

503
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,150
This is one.

504
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,190
So we put an X there.

505
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,590
Like that.

506
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,850
What is this?

507
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,990
It's a notebook?

508
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,010
A door?

509
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,770
A notebook?

510
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:02,450
A door.

511
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,330
Reading.

512
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,670
It's a book.

513
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,110
Vijai, thank you so much for the gift.

514
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,230
Sauce.

515
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:11,990
Oh.

516
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,490
You guys all saw something different.

517
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,370
It's a mug guys.

518
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,690
Would you like to listen to the commentary?

519
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,410
Yeah.

520
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,350
I'm covering it.

521
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:34,890
Wait.

522
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,670
I'm covering her.

523
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:39,990
Sorry, hold on.

524
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,090
Let me make myself a little...

525
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,870
Oh, she's just talking.

526
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,510
She's just yapping.

527
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,770
There we go.

528
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,350
I'll scoot over a little bit.

529
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,630
I'll go down a little bit.

530
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,970
Sorry, she's yapping.

531
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,390
I'll go down a little bit.

532
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,030
I'll go down a little bit.

533
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,510
I'll go down a little bit.

534
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,250
Would you like to listen to the commentary again?

535
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,430
Like I...

536
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,890
I heard any of it.

537
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,950
No, it's okay.

538
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,890
We're good, I think.

539
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,150
Um...

540
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,590
Mika.

541
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,290
I saw you.

542
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:07,910
Superta.

543
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,510
Happy birthday!

544
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,750
Okay.

545
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,390
After completing the five artworks on the floor, you can enter the special exhibit located in the back.

546
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,310
Special exhibit features Raiden's top favorites and you can try out the puzzles.

547
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,450
Explan...

548
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:23,810
Ooh!

549
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,630
Explanations for the works in the special exhibition room are delivered with greater depth and detail.

550
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:38,830
The special exhibition rooms are available on each exhibition floor, so make sure to visit each floor and challenge those works there as well.

551
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,650
Do I have to do the five by fives?

552
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,490
Can I just...

553
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,730
How many are there?

554
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,490
I think we have to...

555
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:52,830
Oh!

556
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,470
Oh wait!

557
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,030
It gets to ten by ten so fast.

558
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,010
Ten by fifteen.

559
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:58,850
Oh!

560
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,210
Okay, wait.

561
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,550
Actually...

562
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,410
Jumps...

563
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,510
So...

564
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:04,890
Quickly.

565
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,830
So we can do it.

566
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:07,830
Easy.

567
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,120
Pick different...

568
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,440
Oh no.

569
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,220
We can do it.

570
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,300
We'll do all of them.

571
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,600
They get tough, I believe it.

572
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
Why is Pinto glowing today?

573
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,820
I have a new skincare routine.

574
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,320
Okay, see?

575
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:23,980
Alright.

576
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,040
So...

577
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,700
Three.

578
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,300
Right?

579
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,680
Oh wait.

580
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,320
I messed up.

581
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,700
Wait.

582
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,040
Don't listen to me.

583
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,620
One!

584
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,120
One!

585
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,260
One!

586
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,620
So there has to be a gap, right?

587
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,640
Like that.

588
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:39,980
Like that.

589
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,340
One, one, one.

590
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,880
Gap, gap, gap.

591
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,080
Gap.

592
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,720
So...

593
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,660
See?

594
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,780
It wouldn't have been right.

595
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,260
It wouldn't have been right.

596
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,320
Then we get into the dice and go up and go up, like that.

597
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,000
Thank you!

598
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,200
Ciao!

599
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,620
Oh.

600
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,080
Cute!

601
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,220
I don't see...

602
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,440
This weird mundo.

603
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,740
Yeah.

604
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,220
This item is the glorious Japanese flavor.

605
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,980
The most type of white weapon is the classic Japanese特ė.

606
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,440
What kind of flavor is it?

607
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,540
What kind of flavor is it?

608
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,240
Sky and Oblivion was doing...

609
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,980
Alcohol flavor...

610
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,520
I had a sip of beer for the first time.

611
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,100
I tried it for the first time.

612
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,720
I was curious.

613
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,860
I was like, what's it taste like?

614
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,840
And... it was okay.

615
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,700
I was like... it was fine.

616
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,460
I...

617
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,030
It was okay.

618
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,630
I was told that I might not like it because it's bitter, but I drink like...

619
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,710
A lot of tea.

620
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,290
And coffee, when it's black, is bitter.

621
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,910
Tea is bitter.

622
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:48,770
Depending.

623
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,450
Oh!

624
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,590
It was carbonated though!

625
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,230
So I couldn't have... I was like, it's too carbonated.

626
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:55,710
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,950
I was like, I can't have this.

628
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,110
Uh...

629
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,690
I can't have carbonation.

630
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,540
The bubbles bother you?

631
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,100
Yeah, the...

632
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
I don't know what it was.

633
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,420
I don't know what it is.

634
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,640
Hmm...

635
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,400
Uh...

636
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,300
It was in Japan, so...

637
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,360
Uh...

638
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,120
Shiorin...

639
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,260
Wrong member!

640
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,300
This is rotten!

641
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,080
Ina...

642
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,300
This is not...

643
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,080
This is not even...

644
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,020
My VN.

645
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,690
Uh...

646
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,050
I think maybe it was like...

647
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,150
It was maybe like a Namabiru, but I don't know if...

648
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,590
That changes anything.

649
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,850
No, I was not sure.

650
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,150
Yeah.

651
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,370
They saw...

652
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,250
They saw white and black hair.

653
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,870
And said...

654
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,450
Yeah.

655
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,670
That's my girl.

656
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,530
See you like that.

657
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,050
Oh!

658
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,290
Oh, I finished that.

659
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,490
It's an umbrella!

660
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,430
That's a parasol problem.

661
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,470
Yoku dekimashita!

662
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:20,570
Nope!

663
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,170
It's a mushroom!

664
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,990
I feel like coffee...

665
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,430
I delivered a load this...

666
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,470
Morning, and the receiver left...

667
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,010
16 cases of iced coffee in my trailer.

668
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,250
Oh!

669
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,430
Omogoshi?

670
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,490
Oh!

671
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,010
Yes.

672
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,670
Oh...

673
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,370
Oh...

674
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,730
Oh...

675
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,010
Oh...

676
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,910
But, in the year 2024, I tasted the first time of my life.

677
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,870
It was so delicious.

678
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,230
Who translated this, I wonder?

679
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,830
The translation is so cute.

680
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,730
Okay.

681
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,850
We're on to the 10x10s.

682
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,630
Uh, view the tutorial?

683
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,350
No.

684
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,430
Um...

685
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,790
Oh, it automatically fills in.

686
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,530
That's kind of nice.

687
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,400
She skipped the song.

688
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,220
I pressed it.

689
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,260
It didn't play anything.

690
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,500
It didn't play it.

691
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,300
I promise.

692
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,620
What does C do?

693
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,260
I don't get it.

694
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,940
I don't get it.

695
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,930
I don't get it.

696
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,510
I don't care.

697
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,070
I don't care.

698
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,730
I don't care.

699
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,250
I don't care.

700
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,110
That's so...

701
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,990
Oh my god!

702
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,530
That's so handy!

703
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,050
Wait.

704
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,550
That's so handy!

705
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,150
Wait, that's actually so nice.

706
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,640
Why that's so nice?

707
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,120
I've never... I've never seen...

708
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm always like, one, two, three, uh.

709
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,480
One, two, three, uh.

710
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,400
Actually, I do... I do nonograms every day, but I'm actually quite slow.

711
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm a... I'm a my pace kind of gal, you know.

712
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,800
But it's also because I... I do them...

713
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,640
This, but... I do them, but...

714
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,980
You know how I have trouble with the numbers, so it makes me...

715
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,960
So I mostly do it because I'm like...

716
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,820
It'll help me with numbers.

717
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,500
Same?

718
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
It's really easy also...

719
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,920
To, like, make a mistake, no?

720
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
And then kind of get like...

721
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,260
And then you're like, uh-oh, wait.

722
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,200
You know what I mean?

723
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,640
You make one mistake and it can throw off the entire puzzle.

724
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,930
I have no idea what's happening, but it looks fine.

725
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,650
It's... I think it's...

726
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,690
One of the much easier games to pick...

727
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,330
Oh, like puzzle games to pick up.

728
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,330
Truly.

729
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,090
If I can do it...

730
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,150
Oh, it's an eyeball, I think.

731
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,930
If I can do it with my...

732
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,490
Oh!

733
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,310
Gosh, that scared me.

734
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,550
If I can do it, I think anybody can.

735
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,430
You're done!

736
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,090
You're done!

737
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,910
It's a...

738
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,630
It's a fan.

739
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,510
I work.

740
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,510
I'm completely off.

741
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,530
I'm completely off every time.

742
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,670
It's all right.

743
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,530
Rock語.

744
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,530
Uh-huh.

745
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,990
Wait, I'm fine.

746
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,230
How do I...

747
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,030
Oh, I wanted to press it!

748
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,450
If I press it, nothing happens, you guys.

749
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,290
Nothing happens.

750
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:00,990
See?

751
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,350
It's not me.

752
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,520
It just means there's a glossary entry.

753
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,960
How do I get to the glossary?

754
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,460
Aren't there, like, a hundred puzzles in this?

755
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,220
Wow.

756
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,940
Okay, maybe if I...

757
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,100
Glossary.

758
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,200
Eight.

759
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,640
Alt.

760
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,760
Eight?

761
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
Neither do anything.

762
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
I guess I have to wait for it to pop up.

763
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,840
I'm enjoying it.

764
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,760
Let's start.

765
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,700
Let's start.

766
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,880
That's right.

767
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,300
The music is so cute.

768
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,240
The music is so nice and relaxing.

769
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,280
Yeah, we're edging.

770
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,100
We're getting the edges.

771
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,220
Uh-huh.

772
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,220
Uh-huh.

773
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:29,760
Uh-huh.

774
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,660
Uh-huh.

775
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,640
See?

776
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,700
And then we just figured out that one.

777
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:35,780
Oh, man.

778
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:37,940
It's...

779
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,880
It's so easy once you get...

780
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,680
Once you understand.

781
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,360
What?

782
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,880
I promise.

783
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:42,980
See?

784
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,940
And then we just solved that whole row.

785
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
Easy peasy.

786
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,840
And we just solved that whole row.

787
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,860
Easy peasy.

788
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,560
Five.

789
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,980
Six.

790
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,500
Seven.

791
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,800
Easy peasy.

792
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,800
Wait.

793
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,020
The counting is so...

794
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,380
One, two, three, four...

795
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,480
Oh, my gosh.

796
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,160
That's huge.

797
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,460
So then you can be like...

798
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:04,880
I don't wanna...

799
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,000
These are the ones that overlap.

800
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,380
It's so easy to tell.

801
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,300
I'm obsessed with that feature.

802
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
I think...

803
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,620
I think...

804
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,700
There are some Picross that are really...

805
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,780
Like the, um...

806
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,120
Not Picross, but Nonogram.

807
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,500
The... I think it's...

808
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,200
There's a Miku one.

809
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,340
There's a Miku one that punishes you...

810
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,120
For...

811
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,720
And...

812
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,600
Meow Tower's a little bit like this, but it's way more forgiving.

813
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,060
But they punish you if you, like, make mistakes.

814
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,920
So you, like...

815
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,060
Won't, like, five star...

816
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,540
Or the puzzle, or whatever.

817
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,480
It drives me insane.

818
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,310
Anyways, you guys...

819
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,300
How have you been?

820
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,310
I feel like...

821
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,940
It's been forever since I've just been able to talk...

822
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,170
Oops, talk to you guys...

823
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,960
It's a... shell.

824
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,040
It's a shell.

825
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,720
It's a shell.

826
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:17,920
It's a shell.

827
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,160
It's a shell.

828
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,180
It's a shell.

829
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,760
Yakuogai.

830
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,020
Uuuu...

831
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,780
Pretty good.

832
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,190
That's just what she has to say.

833
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,670
Yakuogai.

834
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,670
Yakuogaiの真珠草はとても綺麗で、古くからラデン細工に使われるだけでなく、磨いた貝殻をさかずきとして使っていたそうです。さらに、Yakuogaiは貝殻だけでなく、その身も人気があって奄美書島や沖縄の人たちは、食材としても重宝しているそうですよ。

835
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,190
What is a horn turban?

836
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,650
Type of snail...

837
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,130
Oh, I've never had that...

838
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,470
Let me click the exclamation button and there's more, too.

839
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:29,670
Whoa!

840
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,250
Oh, interesting.

841
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,830
I'm not gonna read all of it, though.

842
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,310
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,400
We did it!

844
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,460
Wait.

845
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,900
We did it?

846
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,580
What's...

847
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,760
We got the seal.

848
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,460
We missed you too, Minto.

849
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,060
Mina!

850
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,600
Is the game loud?

851
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,880
This was kind of blasting in my ears.

852
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,240
I was like...

853
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,400
Audio is okay.

854
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,720
I'll turn it down just a little bit.

855
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,820
Cause it's...

856
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
It's blasting in my ears.

857
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,820
Maybe I'm just quiet.

858
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,540
Quiet.

859
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,520
I solved a 40 by 30.

860
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,260
On this over five hours.

861
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,540
It was hell and I had to resort to assist, but it was worth to see a pixel version of a painting.

862
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,600
I've seen IRL being explained by Rod and...

863
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,400
Wait.

864
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,260
30 by...

865
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,520
How insane does this game get?

866
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,260
Oh, I see it.

867
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,780
Oh, I see it.

868
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,700
40 by 30.

869
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,480
Why are there 50 by... 15 by 15 mixed with 40 by 30s in here?

870
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,780
This is...

871
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,840
What is this hell?

872
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,440
Why is it...

873
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,680
Five star difficulty?

874
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,720
Oh my god.

875
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,680
Long語.

876
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,780
Long語.

877
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,400
Long語.

878
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:16,940
Long語.

879
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,460
Long語.

880
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Wait, I'm so curious.

881
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,940
Can I start at any?

882
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,900
Oh, it looks like it.

883
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,520
Wait.

884
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,200
Wait, wait, wait.

885
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,360
I wanna go in order though.

886
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,000
But that's nice.

887
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,980
Ho ho.

888
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,520
I wish you...

889
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,240
Come learn a bit more about me.

890
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,560
This is my game.

891
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,500
I've never done a skinny one like this.

892
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,140
It's so funny looking.

893
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,580
Skinny legend.

894
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,040
Wow.

895
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,180
It's so skinny.

896
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,040
It's so skinny.

897
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,500
I've never done one.

898
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,120
So skinny.

899
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,880
I've only done the square ones.

900
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,880
Skinny legend.

901
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,920
Oh, I have the counter.

902
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,140
And then...

903
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,460
Oh wait.

904
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,780
Oh my gosh.

905
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,200
This is so stinking helpful.

906
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,300
Instead of me just being like...

907
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:20,880
Two.

908
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,480
Three.

909
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,140
Four.

910
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,820
One.

911
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,040
Oh my gosh.

912
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,160
It's so...

913
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,940
So helpful.

914
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,160
Wow.

915
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,580
Wait.

916
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,350
There we go.

917
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,830
They're 20 by 5?

918
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,250
20 by 5?

919
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:53,850
How?

920
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,510
Wait.

921
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:56,510
Seven.

922
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:56,650
What happened?

923
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,930
She's calling me Sugoi, you guys.

924
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,770
I'm just saying.

925
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,170
You might...

926
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,690
You could be called Sugoi too.

927
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,650
If you played...

928
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,570
If you played Nonograms.

929
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,790
I'm just saying.

930
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,890
You could get some real validation here.

931
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,090
You can feel...

932
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,530
You can feel real validated.

933
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,630
Nonograms are for cool kids.

934
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,610
I promise.

935
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,870
They're really fun.

936
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,350
Barely.

937
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,370
I gotta pay attention.

938
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,210
What is this?

939
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,150
Maybe sake.

940
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:37,450
Sure.

941
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,110
It's a horse.

942
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,250
Can Minto call it Sugoi?

943
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,500
Wait.

944
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,020
I'm gonna...

945
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,240
I'm gonna move over again.

946
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,100
I'm gonna...

947
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,880
Actually, I'm gonna do this.

948
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,480
I'm gonna...

949
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,400
Make my head a little bit bigger.

950
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,040
There we go.

951
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,080
There we go.

952
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,160
Wow.

953
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,080
I feel like if it's rice...

954
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,480
It would taste yummy.

955
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,180
Right.

956
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,640
But it's fermented.

957
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,480
Why are you guys crying?

958
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:35,660
Oh.

959
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,360
You wanted me to call you Sugoi?

960
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,000
It's sweet and good.

961
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,880
It's sweet and good.

962
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,320
Yummy.

963
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,620
It's smooth so you get drunk easily.

964
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,560
Oh, the taste is closer to water.

965
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,980
I want it to taste like rice.

966
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,560
Oh, yeah.

967
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,680
Rice is just a plain rice.

968
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,580
It's like the best flavor ever.

969
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,000
All my rice fans in the chat.

970
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,500
All my rice fans in the chat.

971
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,480
Yeah, rice!

972
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,800
Whoa, rice!

973
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,880
Oh...

974
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,320
Scoot

975
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:45,920
up.

976
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,720
Rice.

977
00:46:53,300 --> 00:47:01,330
Ugh, my brain.

978
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,770
I tried to take a nap earlier.

979
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:12,430
And I think I woke up mid-rem cycle.

980
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,650
But I was like, I'll just go back to sleep.

981
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,870
Then I was like, no!

982
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,910
I must stay awake.

983
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,210
So that I can sleep tonight.

984
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,130
I've been trying not to nap.

985
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,230
It's over the jet lag.

986
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,630
But it's so easy to just give in to the jet lag, you know?

987
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,590
To just say, you know what?

988
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,790
The sleep schedule was never normal to begin with.

989
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,370
Just give up.

990
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,690
Just give up.

991
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:50,470
Just give up.

992
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,220
Your sleep schedule is never getting fixed.

993
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,800
No!

994
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,440
Actually!

995
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,860
So I have on my schedule...

996
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,700
For this week...

997
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,440
The, um...

998
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,520
Oh, whoops.

999
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,020
That's wrong.

1000
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,440
The, uh...

1001
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,440
Konami...

1002
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,520
Has a thing for our...

1003
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,260
What's it called?

1004
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,400
For Silent Hill.

1005
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,560
For Silent Hill.

1006
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,390
And for, um...

1007
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,400
And Metal Gear.

1008
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,920
And, um...

1009
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,580
But I've...

1010
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,060
And it's really early for me.

1011
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,680
Well, it's not really early.

1012
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,380
It's like, starts at 9am for me.

1013
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,000
And...

1014
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,620
I've been waking up everyday at 7am.

1015
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,640
So, honestly...

1016
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,220
I'm watching...

1017
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,960
Tonight, I'll fix my schedule.

1018
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,620
Today will be the day I'll fix my schedule.

1019
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,740
And then I'll be like...

1020
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,940
I can't wake up!

1021
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,380
I'll be like...

1022
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,360
I can't do it!

1023
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,820
Can't wake up!

1024
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,600
Can't wake up!

1025
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,820
One, two, three...

1026
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,660
Oh, I have a counter.

1027
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,280
Yeah...

1028
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,360
I love the counter.

1029
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,840
I love having counter!

1030
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,260
I love having counter!

1031
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm all over the place, this puzzle.

1032
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,320
I'm like...

1033
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,760
I'm like all...

1034
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,160
Oh, oh.

1035
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,320
I'm all over the place.

1036
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,420
I can't say I want players.

1037
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,680
Save me!

1038
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,660
You guys...

1039
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,160
I've been...

1040
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,740
I'll be honest.

1041
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
I've been like wanting to do a karaoke.

1042
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,000
Obviously, I can't.

1043
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,140
But it just makes me so sad.

1044
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,600
I've been so...

1045
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,760
I've been so depressed about my voice.

1046
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,620
I've been so depressed.

1047
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,140
I think I probably won't be able...

1048
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,060
Probably won't do any karaoke...

1049
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,100
I think I probably won't be able...

1050
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,460
Probably won't do any karaoke...

1051
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,920
To like the end of the year.

1052
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,380
Honestly.

1053
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:10,640
Sweet.

1054
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,660
But I also just like singing.

1055
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,820
Okay.

1056
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,950
You're making me so sad.

1057
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,560
What am I missing?

1058
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,620
Okay, here.

1059
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,860
And this is done, I think, yeah.

1060
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,320
It's done, it's done.

1061
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,100
And this?

1062
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,040
Oh, wait.

1063
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,960
Where did I mess up?

1064
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,970
Wait, where did I mess up?

1065
00:50:59,310 --> 00:50:59,850
Hold on.

1066
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,890
I started talking and I lost track of where I am.

1067
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,950
Oh, wait, there's a... There's a one here.

1068
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,210
I didn't see it.

1069
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,750
Probably not this, right?

1070
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,850
Wait, but it's 3-1-1.

1071
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,850
Oh, no, I messed up!

1072
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,570
Wait, where did I mess up?

1073
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,800
That's what I'm talking about.

1074
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,460
It's so easy.

1075
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,200
The bottom row.

1076
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,740
Oh, wait.

1077
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,040
But not here.

1078
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,220
I messed up.

1079
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,500
I messed up.

1080
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,150
So many hours.

1081
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,490
I even put Mario Picross in there.

1082
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,090
Oh, yeah!

1083
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,590
There's a Mario Picross.

1084
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,610
This is important.

1085
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,350
Yeah, I know.

1086
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,050
I know.

1087
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,910
The 3-5 row moves the 3-over one.

1088
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,490
This way.

1089
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,650
But then, we have the one here.

1090
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,850
Where did I mess up?

1091
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:25,130
Oh.

1092
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,460
I got it.

1093
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,640
I got it.

1094
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,700
Oh, I was gonna say, is it a bento?

1095
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,540
Soba.

1096
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,640
Oh, my gosh.

1097
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,420
One thing I would have...

1098
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:40,580
Okay.

1099
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:47,720
One of my favorite meals to get at a konbini is soba noodles with inari sushi.

1100
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,900
And I had it so many times last trip.

1101
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,060
And... But it's not so good for you.

1102
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,200
But I don't care.

1103
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,700
Cold soba.

1104
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,240
High soba.

1105
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,440
Cold soba.

1106
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,140
Oh, but it's so yummy.

1107
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,880
It's so good.

1108
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,920
You guys!

1109
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,220
I told you about my hotel.

1110
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,360
And how...

1111
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,420
My hotel was...

1112
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,480
Doodoo garbage.

1113
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,420
But...

1114
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,420
Half of your healing voice is also health diet.

1115
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,420
Oh, pssh.

1116
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,040
Oh, inari sushi is so oily.

1117
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,060
Oil is good for your throat, maybe.

1118
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:38,680
I forgot to tell you about my flight home.

1119
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,100
You guys.

1120
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,360
I somehow had this flight from hell.

1121
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,000
Coming back home.

1122
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,040
Okay.

1123
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,400
So it started off...

1124
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,960
Like a little weird.

1125
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,840
I was a middle seat, okay?

1126
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,740
I was a middle seat in a row of three.

1127
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,220
And...

1128
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,680
I get to my seat.

1129
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,540
And I sit down.

1130
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,400
And I get comfy.

1131
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,600
And I'm like, okay, okay.

1132
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,120
Then the girl...

1133
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,640
There's a...

1134
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,820
Girl to my left.

1135
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,080
And a guy to my right.

1136
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,180
The girl comes first.

1137
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,360
The girl comes first.

1138
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,760
And...

1139
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:22,940
She...

1140
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,360
She...

1141
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,440
I think she was having a real bad time.

1142
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,860
She was huffing.

1143
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,020
And puffing.

1144
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:29,920
And she...

1145
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,180
If there was...

1146
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,480
A piggy pig house...

1147
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,840
She would have blown it down, I think.

1148
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:34,980
She would have...

1149
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,760
She...

1150
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,720
She was so...

1151
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,880
I was like...

1152
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,560
She...

1153
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,540
She would just kind of like...

1154
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,940
She sat down really fast.

1155
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,060
And she was like...

1156
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,700
And then she would like...

1157
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,140
She was typing really fast on her phone.

1158
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,860
She was like...

1159
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,440
And then...

1160
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:52,940
And then...

1161
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,880
And then she...

1162
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,080
She would like...

1163
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,700
Have...

1164
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,360
Like start playing with her fingers and stuff.

1165
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:58,940
Like she...

1166
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,600
She was having a really bad time.

1167
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,000
And...

1168
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:17,240
She's... Okay, I need your opinion on this, because I asked some other people, and it was like half and half... I was always taught... That... Have you guys ever heard of the middle row arm rest etiquette?

1169
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,500
This is how I was taught.

1170
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:30,680
That if you are... An aisle seat, or a window seat... That you... Like, you give...

1171
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:36,580
Or rather, the person in the middle has priority over the... The arm rest.

1172
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,720
Middle seat gets both arm rest.

1173
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,160
Yes!

1174
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,220
Yes!

1175
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,560
You let the middle row have the arm rest.

1176
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,140
Yes!

1177
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,800
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1178
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,820
I feel so validated right now.

1179
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,220
Oh my gosh!

1180
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,820
Okay, because I ha... I don't usually use them.

1181
00:55:52,820 --> 00:56:02,460
Um... Um... But this seat... I was like... I was feeling... I was feeling icky... Sticky... From the... From the humidity!

1182
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,480
And so, I was like... I don't want to smush my arms... And have my armpits get wet.

1183
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,020
So, I was like... Sorry, this is so TMI.

1184
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,340
But...

1185
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,940
I was like... Okay, well, I'm just gonna rest my arm on the arm rest.

1186
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,780
And be comfy.

1187
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,740
And... Um... And...

1188
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,540
She kind of also put her arm on the arm rest.

1189
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,960
But... That's fine.

1190
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,980
We both could share.

1191
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,500
I was... We were in two different spots.

1192
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,760
And then I was like... I... Was... I had to get something out of my bag.

1193
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,280
I had to get my headphones out of my bag.

1194
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,180
And I got them out.

1195
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,180
And I plugged them into the monitor.

1196
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,940
And I put them on to watch... Watch movie.

1197
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,700
And I put my arm back on the arm rest.

1198
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,000
And she... She shoved it off.

1199
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,420
She like... Aggressively went like...

1200
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,840
Un... At me.

1201
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,620
I was like... I was like... Oh my god.

1202
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,700
I was like... What are you taking your anger out on me for?

1203
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,980
I've never had that... I was like... Dang.

1204
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,420
This is... Wow.

1205
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:13,860
Okay.

1206
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,160
Wow.

1207
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,560
So then...

1208
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,100
Um... The guy on my right...

1209
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,880
Before we took off... He ended up...

1210
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,180
Leaving his seat.

1211
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,020
And I was... He didn't...

1212
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,280
Come back for a long time.

1213
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,500
But I was like... I don't know what he's doing.

1214
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,760
Maybe he's talking with family.

1215
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,640
Like, you know... Maybe his friends are sitting somewhere else.

1216
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,780
And he's just talking with them before we take off.

1217
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,940
Or... Um... Maybe he's in the bathroom.

1218
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,800
I have no idea.

1219
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:40,940
But, um...

1220
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,140
My flight gets delayed.

1221
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,480
And so we have to sit on the...

1222
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,940
Plane for... A little bit while.

1223
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,260
Because we had a...

1224
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,040
Check engine light.

1225
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,340
Which I've never...

1226
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,920
The guy on the plane was just like...

1227
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,500
Um...

1228
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,920
We have a...

1229
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,560
A light that came on.

1230
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,960
And we're getting it looked at.

1231
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,740
And then we can go.

1232
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,460
And I was like...

1233
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:03,820
Oh, okay.

1234
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,990
I hope I don't...

1235
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,080
Um...

1236
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,300
Crash and have to...

1237
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:08,740
You know...

1238
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,240
Float home.

1239
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,180
That would be so sad.

1240
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,500
And also sad for everybody that crashes and dies.

1241
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,600
But...

1242
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:17,720
Um...

1243
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,920
So the guy is gone.

1244
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,020
And...

1245
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,900
He doesn't come back.

1246
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:21,880
And I was like...

1247
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,280
Oh...

1248
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,720
I guess maybe he switched seats.

1249
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,080
And I didn't...

1250
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,400
And...

1251
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:25,780
But...

1252
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:25,920
Because...

1253
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,640
They kept saying...

1254
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,380
This is a full flight.

1255
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:27,880
Full flight.

1256
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,400
Full flight.

1257
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,260
And, um...

1258
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,100
So I was like...

1259
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,580
I don't know...

1260
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,400
I don't know where he is.

1261
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,700
And once we're in the air...

1262
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,780
If he doesn't come back...

1263
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,400
Obviously...

1264
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,480
That's when I will...

1265
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,220
Move over.

1266
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:40,920
Because...

1267
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,360
Free seat.

1268
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,180
Let's go, baby.

1269
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,360
And...

1270
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,980
She's still huffing and puffing.

1271
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:47,920
So...

1272
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,900
Eventually when he's just like...

1273
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,460
Yeah, we're getting this looked at.

1274
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,660
And then we'll...

1275
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,580
Um...

1276
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,200
Take off.

1277
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,440
That's when I was like...

1278
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,100
Okay, I think I have time to...

1279
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,700
Move seats.

1280
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,060
And when I do...

1281
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,100
The girl like...

1282
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:02,860
Glares at me.

1283
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,380
She goes like...

1284
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,280
And...

1285
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,020
Throws all of her stuff...

1286
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,120
Into my old seat.

1287
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,500
And like...

1288
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,520
Throws her shoes down where...

1289
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,600
I was sitting.

1290
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,380
Like...

1291
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,220
I guess she was like...

1292
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,800
Upset that I wasn't moving...

1293
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,660
Even though it was open.

1294
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,900
I don't know.

1295
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,520
I was like...

1296
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,340
This is still...

1297
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:27,880
I kind of...

1298
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,620
Kind of territorial.

1299
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,500
I was like...

1300
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,160
I was like...

1301
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,720
I know it's an open seat now...

1302
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,600
But technically...

1303
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,560
That was my seat.

1304
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,220
Like technically...

1305
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,860
I paid money for that seat.

1306
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:36,780
And...

1307
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,580
It's not my...

1308
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:37,960
Like...

1309
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,600
Now I feel like I own these...

1310
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,160
Two seats.

1311
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,060
So...

1312
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,080
I kind of got like...

1313
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,120
A little upset that she was...

1314
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,140
She was throwing her stuff...

1315
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,440
Without asking...

1316
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:50,740
Into...

1317
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,040
Into my seat.

1318
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,220
And...

1319
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,700
The girls are fighting.

1320
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,900
I was like...

1321
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,220
People on planes are ridiculous.

1322
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:02,760
I...

1323
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,780
I don't know why she was so rude.

1324
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,120
She was just...

1325
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,440
She was having a bad time...

1326
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,820
As soon as she got on...

1327
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,500
And she kept taking it out on me.

1328
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:11,740
But...

1329
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,500
Obviously...

1330
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,160
Once I switched seats...

1331
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,800
I didn't really have to interact with her anymore...

1332
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,240
Which was amazing and great.

1333
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,140
Did you talk?

1334
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:20,580
No.

1335
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,820
I didn't say anything to her.

1336
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,040
But...

1337
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,240
Um...

1338
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,020
Then...

1339
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,700
You know...

1340
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,100
Whatever.

1341
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,380
Ignore her.

1342
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:31,360
Um...

1343
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:31,640
The...

1344
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,440
Oh my gosh.

1345
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,960
Probably like...

1346
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,560
80% of...

1347
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,400
The trip...

1348
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,620
The flight home...

1349
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,100
Was...

1350
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,820
Turbulence.

1351
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,380
Like...

1352
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,480
And at some points...

1353
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:40,800
Like...

1354
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,900
Really, really, really bad turbulence.

1355
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:43,600
Like...

1356
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:43,960
Luckily...

1357
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,980
We didn't have any...

1358
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,720
Where we had to drop super duper far.

1359
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,520
Like...

1360
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,720
I've seen some videos...

1361
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,100
Where they have to drop so fast...

1362
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,860
That like...

1363
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,480
Food and everything goes flying.

1364
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,200
Luckily...

1365
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,140
We didn't have anything like that.

1366
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,000
But some were...

1367
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,360
Pretty darn close.

1368
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,780
And...

1369
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,140
So now I'm in aisle seat, right?

1370
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,760
Sorry, I know this flight...

1371
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,440
Or this, uh...

1372
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:04,940
This...

1373
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,980
This is so long of an explanation.

1374
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,800
I went from soba noodles to here.

1375
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,240
But anyway...

1376
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,100
Anyway...

1377
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:14,480
Um...

1378
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,560
I'm now in aisle seat.

1379
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:16,860
And...

1380
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,760
There is...

1381
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,180
Oh...

1382
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,020
There's...

1383
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,900
But I'm in like the middle, right?

1384
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,800
Like I'm in the...

1385
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,420
So there's more seats to the right of me.

1386
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,240
On the other side of the aisle.

1387
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:27,920
And...

1388
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,820
Some girl party.

1389
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,140
They were like...

1390
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,260
We're just gonna stand here.

1391
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,600
Wow.

1392
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,400
The plane is so turbulent.

1393
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,060
And we're just gonna chit chat.

1394
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,260
Right next to you.

1395
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,900
And so...

1396
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,980
It's so bumpy.

1397
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,840
And they keep falling on top of me.

1398
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,020
And their butts are in my face.

1399
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,100
Because they're standing there talking.

1400
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,280
Wow.

1401
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,700
It's so turbulent.

1402
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,140
I've never heard...

1403
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,260
I've never heard a flight attendant do this before.

1404
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,080
And even the captain got on the...

1405
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,240
On the...

1406
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,320
The intercom.

1407
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:05,780
It was...

1408
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,500
They were like...

1409
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,720
They were begging.

1410
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,060
They were begging these people to sit down in particular.

1411
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:20,300
They were like, they were like, if you are standing, we need you to sit down.

1412
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,140
This is not just for your safety, it is for the safety of everybody around you.

1413
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,120
We need you to sit down right now.

1414
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:36,280
And eventually they were like, oh, I guess we should go sit down now.

1415
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,760
While they're like toppling over because of the turbulence.

1416
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,380
Like, they could barely get back to their seat.

1417
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,580
They're like, I guess we should go sit down now.

1418
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,760
No shit.

1419
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,760
No shit, you should go sit down.

1420
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,480
I was like, if you fall on me one more time, I swear.

1421
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,080
I swear.

1422
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,080
And then they would like follow me and do like that laughing, like apology.

1423
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,580
They'd be like, oh, I'm so sorry.

1424
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,540
And then like turn around and keep talking.

1425
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,480
Oh, they thought it was a fairground ride.

1426
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,360
Oh, and then.

1427
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,880
So the turbulence is fine.

1428
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:28,120
I got, you know, it was a little, it was, it was a little hard to sleep, but it was okay.

1429
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,060
And once those girls sat down for good, it was better.

1430
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:40,540
Like they kept being like, they, on the intercom, they were like, we don't even have our flight attendants doing anything right now.

1431
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,580
They are all seated.

1432
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,760
We need you to sit down.

1433
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,980
It helps to have a smoke in the lavatory at times like this.

1434
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:57,900
And, um, yeah, they were like, they were, they were really calling them out.

1435
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:08,120
And, um, uh, oh, and then there's the icing on the cake.

1436
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,020
That little cherry on top.

1437
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,160
It was.

1438
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:16,740
Towards.

1439
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,820
Maybe like three-fourths of the flight.

1440
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,380
And there was a, there was a girl sitting out the window.

1441
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,740
Little girl.

1442
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,120
With her family.

1443
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,100
That, with the same ones that were chit-chatting.

1444
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,020
Three-fourths of.

1445
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,220
She decides it's a good idea to open the window.

1446
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:47,500
And for those who don't know, I've already, I, I, not too long ago.

1447
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:54,840
Not too long ago, I had a flight where there was a girl who left the window on almost the entire flight.

1448
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,040
And it was, there, it is, you are chasing the sun.

1449
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,000
There is no darkness to be had.

1450
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,240
And then, the kicker is on this other flight, is she would put on her, her eye mask.

1451
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:11,560
And, she would put on her eye mask and go to sleep with the window open.

1452
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:18,720
And this little girl, did the same, exact, thing.

1453
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,140
This time, I had an eye mask, too.

1454
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,880
And then, it fell on the floor when I didn't notice and I stepped on it.

1455
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,700
And then, I couldn't use it anymore.

1456
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,160
And that was my story of my flight.

1457
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,420
Still usable.

1458
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,060
Ew!

1459
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,620
Maybe if you want to get some eye, a sty or something.

1460
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,720
Or, you know, you want to get hep C in your eye.

1461
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,700
You know how disgusting airports and planes are.

1462
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,960
Pink eye.

1463
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,820
This time fell episode as adventure.

1464
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:18,320
It's true.

1465
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,000
So true.

1466
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,700
I prefer Pepsi.

1467
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:25,860
Pink eye.

1468
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,480
You'd get pink eye.

1469
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,680
Blue eye.

1470
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,540
Brown eye.

1471
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,380
Green eye.

1472
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,580
You'd get the whole rainbow eye.

1473
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,320
Blue eyes by dragon.

1474
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,340
Ma'am, this is the soba exhibit.

1475
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,100
She's waiting so patiently.

1476
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,940
To say the commentary.

1477
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,660
Okay.

1478
01:06:59,020 --> 01:06:59,920
That was my story.

1479
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,320
Let's listen to about soba noodles.

1480
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:29,900
Let's listen to about soba noodles.

1481
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,280
And this is the second one.

1482
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:37,060
The second one is the second one and the second one is the second one!

1483
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,200
Please try it with salt and salt.

1484
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:51,180
Obviously, I don't eat with... with a... with a... I almost called this guacamole.

1485
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,240
Japanese guacamole.

1486
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:10,910
The wasabi.

1487
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,790
But I love it with the little onions.

1488
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,870
That's the spicy guacamole.

1489
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,350
The danger guac.

1490
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:21,030
I live life on the edge.

1491
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,730
She's losing it.

1492
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,250
Recalling that plane story really just did me, huh?

1493
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:37,210
But yeah...

1494
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:39,230
Soba noodles with inari sushi.

1495
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:41,890
Perfect combi.

1496
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,170
So, so good.

1497
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,050
Okay, we're back.

1498
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:48,850
We're locked in.

1499
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:49,550
We're locked in.

1500
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,710
15 by 15, baby.

1501
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,550
Oh, so many numbers.

1502
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,870
So many numbers.

1503
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:00,850
Why are some of these blue?

1504
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,090
I just noticed.

1505
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:07,590
Why are some of them blue when you start?

1506
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:08,910
Huh?

1507
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:09,470
Huh?

1508
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,330
Huh?

1509
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,210
Hmm...

1510
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:17,030
Huh?

1511
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:17,910
Huh?

1512
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,090
One they can work on.

1513
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,290
Ah!

1514
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,870
I see.

1515
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:26,090
I see.

1516
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:26,650
I see.

1517
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:27,970
Okay.

1518
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:28,590
Wait.

1519
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,190
I'm counting?

1520
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,850
Huh?

1521
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:31,610
Huh?

1522
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,070
I don't know.

1523
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,490
Small hints.

1524
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,330
That's so fancy.

1525
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,590
It's nice.

1526
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:42,130
But yeah.

1527
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:44,030
You guys have any...

1528
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,950
Any horror story?

1529
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:49,950
Wait.

1530
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,170
Oh, yeah.

1531
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:55,170
Oh, I didn't even realize I could finish this.

1532
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:55,590
Hahaha.

1533
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:57,830
I'm shilly.

1534
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,730
Any plain horror stories?

1535
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,510
I guess when you fly...

1536
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:04,710
I've...

1537
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:05,610
You know, I've...

1538
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,290
Especially been flying so much.

1539
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,590
I'm obviously gonna have...

1540
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,010
A lot of...

1541
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:11,730
Hit and...

1542
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:13,810
Misses.

1543
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:14,810
I don't know.

1544
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,490
Minesweep with...

1545
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:18,270
But rotten.

1546
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:20,430
It's nonogram!

1547
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,410
Put some respect in it's name!

1548
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:23,330
Yattou!

1549
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:24,330
Yattou!

1550
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,910
I repress my airplane trauma.

1551
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:30,990
That's so true.

1552
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:32,670
It's like...

1553
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,890
You know...

1554
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:37,150
You know...

1555
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,130
It's...

1556
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,390
It's like...

1557
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:40,890
The flights are long.

1558
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:41,430
But ultimately...

1559
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:43,990
Unless I'm like...

1560
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,410
Actively in pain or something...

1561
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:47,650
It's...

1562
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:48,730
Forgettable.

1563
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,070
You know what I mean?

1564
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:50,550
Like...

1565
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:50,850
It's...

1566
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,550
It's like...

1567
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,690
Just an inconvenience.

1568
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,030
And I go about...

1569
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:54,730
Go...

1570
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,250
Continue my afterlife.

1571
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:59,590
One time I was flying with...

1572
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:00,310
Wait.

1573
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:01,550
Wait, what just happened?

1574
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,490
Oh, I think I actually...

1575
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:04,630
Lowered the volume.

1576
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:05,170
Or something.

1577
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,550
May takee, may takee...

1578
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:08,650
Guru, guru, guru, guru.

1579
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:10,870
Oh, she just did the song.

1580
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:11,910
Why?

1581
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,710
We once had kids...

1582
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,750
That would kick our seats...

1583
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,330
So my dad threatened to kick their asses.

1584
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,930
May takee, may takee...

1585
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:18,930
Guru, guru, guru, guru.

1586
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,170
Guru, guru, guru.

1587
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,050
May takee, may takee...

1588
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:23,890
Guru, guru, guru, guru.

1589
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,610
May takee, may takee...

1590
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:26,730
Guru, guru, guru, guru.

1591
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:27,010
May takee, may takee...

1592
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:29,730
She's on the tune!

1593
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,270
I love the feeling of takeoff and turbulence.

1594
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,450
Since, I always fall asleep.

1595
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:39,030
I flew for the first time to see the Phantom Thief concert.

1596
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,710
It went really well, thanks considered.

1597
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,630
Fly enough times and...

1598
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,650
That will definitely change.

1599
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,570
Nah.

1600
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,010
Wait, seven.

1601
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,460
But also, I guess it depends on some airlines as well.

1602
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,880
Like if you go with like...

1603
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,920
The US has some really like...

1604
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,780
Budget ones that are...

1605
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,340
I've never...

1606
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,280
I've never tried them.

1607
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,520
But I've only heard...

1608
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,100
Horror stories of them.

1609
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:18,420
Wait.

1610
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,780
How did I...

1611
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,880
How did I mess this up?

1612
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:26,600
Wait.

1613
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,800
I'm not locked in at all.

1614
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,220
Wait, wait, wait.

1615
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,460
Dull.

1616
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,420
Frontier and Spirit.

1617
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:37,780
Oh.

1618
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah, I've heard this.

1619
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,740
But I feel like Spirit Airlines would be perfect for me.

1620
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:47,050
Frontier lost my luggage for a while...

1621
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:47,790
And broke for the zippers.

1622
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:48,690
No.

1623
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:50,710
That's so bad.

1624
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,840
Flying to New Orleans tomorrow...

1625
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,900
To go work in the Pokemon International Championship.

1626
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,940
Giving me a lot of good ideas...

1627
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,040
For things to do...

1628
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,760
To give my fellow passengers stories for the hitter.

1629
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,240
Your evil skeleton dog.

1630
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,940
I'm gambling on Southwest.

1631
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,240
I feel like Southwest, I've heard, is not so bad.

1632
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,100
No?

1633
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,220
Okay, I have to figure out...

1634
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,140
Where did I mess up?

1635
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,880
Where did it all go wrong?

1636
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,020
I'm...

1637
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:26,080
I'm so early in the puzzle, I've already messed up.

1638
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:27,920
How?

1639
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,780
It has to be here.

1640
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,260
But then the seven...

1641
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,860
What did I do?

1642
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,360
What did I do?

1643
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,320
I feel like I'm...

1644
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:47,720
Oh, wait.

1645
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,180
Can I start over?

1646
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:50,980
Can I redo?

1647
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,040
I'm locked in.

1648
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,220
Just wait.

1649
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,160
Restart.

1650
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:55,700
Restart.

1651
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:56,940
Okay, we restart.

1652
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,080
First...

1653
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:00,640
PyroWog!

1654
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,780
Happy birthday!

1655
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,260
Happy, happy birthday!

1656
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,600
Happy, happy birthday!

1657
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,820
Japan Airlines.

1658
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,900
Tokyo to LAX.

1659
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,720
Yeah...

1660
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,500
Japan Airlines, I've heard, is really good.

1661
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:13,980
I gotta lock in.

1662
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,800
Making a phantom thief.

1663
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,140
Love the last cup of coffee.

1664
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,220
I'll be a house super rendered YouTuber.

1665
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,540
Oh...

1666
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,440
Yeah!

1667
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,760
I have to upload mine.

1668
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,880
I have to upload mine.

1669
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,640
Yeah...

1670
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,500
I don't wanna...

1671
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,440
I'll do that.

1672
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:34,060
Eventually.

1673
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,360
Wait, this one we can do the whole thing, no?

1674
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,440
Yes.

1675
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,000
You're...

1676
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,400
Oh, oops.

1677
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:45,380
You're...

1678
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:47,760
Oh...

1679
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,880
Oh, wait, that was right.

1680
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,520
Three...

1681
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:51,800
Three...

1682
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,320
Five...

1683
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,240
Maybe I misread these up here.

1684
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,040
Why does it seem different already?

1685
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,940
Something feels off.

1686
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,840
Did I misread?

1687
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,840
Maybe I misread.

1688
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,260
Count!

1689
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,360
Tokyo has to pay you her collab fee for...

1690
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,160
Somehow my flight to Baltimore ended up as...

1691
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,590
Eight hours next to a guy who constantly tried to put his arms...

1692
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,400
Over the armrests.

1693
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,680
Elbowed me when there was turbulence and...

1694
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,500
Religious texts out loud the whole flight!

1695
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,300
Maybe...

1696
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,080
I

1697
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,140
feel like...

1698
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:02,780
I...

1699
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,240
I feel like...

1700
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,280
Some...

1701
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,820
Point that...

1702
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,620
At what...

1703
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,880
At what point...

1704
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,720
Do you call...

1705
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,820
A flight attendant?

1706
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,240
Um...

1707
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,720
You know...

1708
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,160
At what point is it...

1709
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,740
Because I don't want to ever feel like I'm a Karen, you know?

1710
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,160
But at what point does it feel like it's appropriate to be like...

1711
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,380
Okay, this is not...

1712
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,380
This is not behavior that...

1713
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,780
That's...

1714
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,900
That's...

1715
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:33,820
That's my personal hell.

1716
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,860
Phoebe!

1717
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,580
Hello, hello, welcome here!

1718
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,320
I was watching you earlier with the comfy direct!

1719
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,740
I was watching...

1720
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,820
I didn't say anything...

1721
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,620
But I was watching...

1722
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,580
Thanks for the raid!

1723
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,820
Thank you, SF2!

1724
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,640
Thank you so much for the gifted!

1725
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,520
Thank you!

1726
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,800
Thank you, thank you!

1727
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:03,170
Phoebe!

1728
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:03,950
Hi for reading!

1729
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,010
Thank you, guys!

1730
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:06,310
Ducky!

1731
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:07,570
Thanks for the five gifted...

1732
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:08,250
Speck!

1733
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,490
Oh, thank you for the 20 gifted!

1734
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:10,030
Thank you!

1735
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,890
Fiverrack!

1736
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:11,850
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

1737
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:14,690
Twarko!

1738
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:15,730
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

1739
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,510
10 out of 10...

1740
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:21,050
10 out of 10 times I've asked someone on a plane to stop doing something...

1741
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:21,480
They've done it...

1742
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:23,370
Most people are somewhat reasonable...

1743
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,190
Yeah.

1744
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:26,790
Yeah.

1745
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:28,330
Bye.

1746
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:29,010
Bye.

1747
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:30,450
Bye.

1748
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,210
Bye.

1749
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:31,730
Bye.

1750
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:31,770
Bye.

1751
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,530
It's to avoid the conflict.

1752
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:34,930
Oh.

1753
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,570
Wait, I missed one.

1754
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:38,910
Wait.

1755
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:39,710
Wait.

1756
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,710
Did I say Duargo?

1757
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:41,070
Thank you.

1758
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,950
Thank you.

1759
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:44,910
Thank you.

1760
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:53,680
Sorry, I'm having to... Oh, it's rewinding.

1761
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,080
I was wondering what it was doing.

1762
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,200
That's crazy.

1763
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,140
Oh, sorry.

1764
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,400
It's one of those games where if I click out... Oh, my gosh.

1765
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,520
Yoshi, thank you.

1766
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,880
Flight was delayed five more hours.

1767
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,880
Oh, my gosh.

1768
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,060
Mario, thank you so much for the five gifted.

1769
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,200
Rami, thank you for the gifted.

1770
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,160
Thank you.

1771
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:10,820
Okay.

1772
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,580
Lady fell asleep on my shoulder for half a flight.

1773
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,140
When she woke up, she just carried on like nothing happened.

1774
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,920
She's probably embarrassed, no?

1775
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,460
There's rewinding in this game?

1776
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,500
Yes, there is.

1777
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,060
If you use the scroll wheel.

1778
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,340
You see down here?

1779
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,480
You can like... It's basically an undo button.

1780
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,180
Maybe I should have done that instead of... Okay, wait.

1781
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:35,940
I gotta lock in.

1782
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,200
Two... Wait.

1783
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,060
Now, let me continue the game.

1784
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,240
Two...

1785
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:49,070
One, two, three, four.

1786
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:50,210
Yeah.

1787
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,270
That has to be.

1788
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,370
Hum hum.

1789
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:58,970
That!

1790
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,070
That's what I had before.

1791
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,830
I like the little...

1792
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,330
Which it does.

1793
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:07,590
Mm-hmm.

1794
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,430
Now, the reason...

1795
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,990
You're probably like...

1796
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,070
You can do something here, Minto.

1797
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,350
With...

1798
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,790
What we don't know...

1799
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,510
As you can see...

1800
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:18,730
So...

1801
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:19,210
Okay, so...

1802
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:19,550
In...

1803
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:22,090
In P-Cross, you never want to assume...

1804
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,650
You never want to assume like...

1805
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:24,950
Oh, this is one...

1806
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:26,050
And then two...

1807
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:26,310
And two.

1808
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:27,110
You know?

1809
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:27,830
It could be...

1810
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:28,990
This is two...

1811
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:29,830
Two, two...

1812
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,030
And the one is in here.

1813
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:31,830
You know?

1814
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:33,230
So that's why...

1815
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:34,390
I'm kind of...

1816
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:36,750
Leaving it...

1817
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,210
Open.

1818
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:37,410
Open.

1819
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:43,910
So...

1820
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,570
It's one of those types of...

1821
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:49,390
You can't be so hasty sometimes.

1822
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,290
That's not how that works.

1823
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,650
It is?

1824
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,810
What do you mean?

1825
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,530
It's 100% how that works.

1826
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:02,570
It's...

1827
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,330
It's 100% how that works.

1828
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,910
Looking forward to Karen...

1829
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,830
Vinto...

1830
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:13,330
Helmet...

1831
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:13,870
Hair reveal.

1832
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,450
I don't get it.

1833
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:21,850
That's how it works.

1834
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:22,710
I don't know what I'm saying.

1835
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,630
Rami, thank you.

1836
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,870
Bob cut.

1837
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,350
Oh, the Karen!

1838
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:33,530
Oh, right.

1839
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,030
Because they always have like...

1840
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,370
Okay.

1841
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,630
You know...

1842
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:40,090
If Karen's dyed their hair black...

1843
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:41,870
It would just be...

1844
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,030
A scene...

1845
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,770
Emo kid cut.

1846
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,010
Think about it.

1847
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:50,030
If the hair...

1848
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,930
Was a little less swept...

1849
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,670
And a little more like...

1850
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:54,830
In their eyes...

1851
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:55,810
It would not.

1852
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:56,550
Yes, it would!

1853
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:00,850
It would!

1854
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,150
What is a Karen haircut?

1855
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:17,970
It's like...

1856
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,710
Okay, I'm gonna use Raden.

1857
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,150
I'm sorry.

1858
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:20,970
As an example.

1859
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,170
Just so I can show.

1860
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:24,450
The hair...

1861
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,570
Sweeps...

1862
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,630
And then it's like short here.

1863
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,410
Kind of like how she has her Hime cut.

1864
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,670
And then it's like...

1865
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:31,750
Spiky short on the back.

1866
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:31,970
Oh!

1867
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:32,490
She's...

1868
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:33,270
She's showing off.

1869
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,490
It's like...

1870
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:36,570
It's like...

1871
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:38,170
Or it can be flat.

1872
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:39,310
But sometimes they're poofy.

1873
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,430
Ba-Baaam.

1874
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,030
Okay.

1875
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:55,310
Let's see...

1876
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,860
And then...

1877
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:00,980
Oh!

1878
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,020
Here we have one...

1879
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,380
These light up.

1880
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,420
But they make me nervous.

1881
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,980
Why do they light up?

1882
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,240
Like they know something, I don't.

1883
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,740
What do you know?

1884
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,280
Oh, I just noticed the one up here.

1885
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:22,680
Oh, I'm so silly.

1886
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,480
I didn't even notice I had the one up there.

1887
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:25,780
Okay.

1888
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,400
Relaxing.

1889
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,500
That is pretty relaxing.

1890
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,660
I like the soundtrack for the puzzle time.

1891
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,540
It feels like...

1892
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,980
Like a... like a...

1893
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:52,860
RPG.

1894
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,300
You're on a farm.

1895
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,340
Like a...

1896
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,860
Story of Seasons type.

1897
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,380
Like a hometown.

1898
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1899
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,240
Like a town music.

1900
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,980
Yeah, Harvest Moon.

1901
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:09,960
Harvest Moon.

1902
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,760
That's what I was thinking.

1903
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,000
I said Story of Seasons, but Harvest Moon.

1904
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:14,800
That's what I was thinking.

1905
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,200
It's like you read my mind.

1906
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,560
I'm not locked in.

1907
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,800
Okay, hold on.

1908
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:28,720
No...

1909
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,200
What else can I do?

1910
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:34,940
Oh wait, I can get rid of that.

1911
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,050
What can I do?

1912
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:40,910
What can I do?

1913
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:41,650
What can I do?

1914
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:56,040
What can I do?

1915
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:06,780
You're right!

1916
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,890
Minto, did you ever get your yogurt?

1917
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,150
Oh my gosh, I did!

1918
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,350
But it was like...

1919
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,590
I'm not gonna lie.

1920
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:23,130
It was kind of mid.

1921
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,050
Oh, you see?

1922
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:25,950
We figured it out.

1923
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,170
It wasn't these two at all.

1924
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:27,890
It was this.

1925
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,790
And then we can solve for...

1926
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:31,530
You.

1927
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:35,830
We can solve.

1928
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:54,430
And I didn't mess up this time.

1929
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,570
Yeah, it was pretty mid.

1930
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,470
You can do the seven in the second row.

1931
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:04,490
Midori, I did it.

1932
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,050
Thank you.

1933
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,870
Oh, I did it.

1934
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,890
We did it.

1935
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:11,490
We did it, Reddit.

1936
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,370
We did it.

1937
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,240
What was the first ever we did it, Reddit?

1938
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,540
I only say it for the meme, but I actually don't think I know.

1939
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,080
When was the first time ever that they said we did it, Reddit?

1940
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,660
What's the story?

1941
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,560
Give me the internet history.

1942
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,440
Oh, it's not great.

1943
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,440
Oh.

1944
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,620
It's a dark story.

1945
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,000
It was a bummer.

1946
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,740
Okay, ignore it.

1947
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,580
I'm gonna undo.

1948
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,160
Forget that I ever asked.

1949
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,260
Forget I asked, actually.

1950
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:06,320
Okay, never mind.

1951
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:06,760
Anyway.

1952
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:19,010
I apologize.

1953
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,510
We did it, SpongeBob.

1954
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,430
We did it, SpongeBob.

1955
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:35,590
Okay.

1956
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:39,130
One.

1957
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,710
What do you mean we can...

1958
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:41,830
Okay.

1959
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:42,990
Oh, because we can fill in that.

1960
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,490
Wow, it really...

1961
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:44,970
Three, four.

1962
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,010
It really does give in the hint.

1963
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:52,190
Wait.

1964
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:53,230
That's wrong.

1965
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:53,770
There we go.

1966
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,880
Sometimes too many numbers.

1967
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,240
I wonder what the picture is.

1968
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,160
I'm trying... It kind of looks like Uboa to me.

1969
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,380
Kind of looks like Uboa.

1970
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,720
I don't think it is, but...

1971
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,340
Could be.

1972
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:22,520
Who knows?

1973
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,540
You never know with a Peacross.

1974
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,670
It's me, actually.

1975
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:37,930
The eyes?

1976
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,510
And the nose?

1977
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:40,610
And the mouth?

1978
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:46,010
It's another mushroom.

1979
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,530
Don't say that.

1980
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,650
I don't think it is.

1981
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:53,810
What is it?

1982
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,610
I can't tell.

1983
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:59,350
I can't tell at all.

1984
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:03,310
It's definitely a face though, no?

1985
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:05,270
The eyes?

1986
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:06,510
And the nose?

1987
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,430
And the mouth?

1988
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,510
The mouth?

1989
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,750
Well, it's not Henohe no mohezi.

1990
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:11,190
A mask?

1991
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,050
That's right.

1992
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:13,870
Huge of real.

1993
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,350
Oh, it's smiling.

1994
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:19,230
Definitely not Henohe no mohezi.

1995
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:21,910
Oh, it's her mask!

1996
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:24,070
No mean.

1997
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,290
It's the nose mask!

1998
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,870
It's the nose mask!

1999
01:28:58,230 --> 01:28:58,930
Oh...

2000
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:04,530
Oh...

2001
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,090
Oh...

2002
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:15,090
Wow...

2003
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:15,810
Cute!

2004
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,910
Oh, special artworks room soon.

2005
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,670
Wait, I feel like we could go now.

2006
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:28,730
No, we'll do this one.

2007
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:32,330
Challenge.

2008
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:37,470
Whoa, whoa.

2009
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:39,150
So many blue.

2010
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:40,650
So many blue.

2011
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:43,050
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

2012
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:49,370
That is a fun fact.

2013
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:51,370
That's a rock fact.

2014
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,400
Hold on, let's do this one first.

2015
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,340
Three...

2016
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,200
Seven, yep, okay.

2017
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:04,660
Two, three, four...

2018
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,460
There we go.

2019
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,520
And same on the other side.

2020
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,700
And here.

2021
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:12,780
I don't know.

2022
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2023
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:58,030
I like when a 15x15 peak cross has a 3-7-3-roll.

2024
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,220
I like when she reassures me.

2025
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,780
Actually, I don't even know if she knows I'm right.

2026
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,980
So when she does the humuhumuhum, I wonder if I'm wrong.

2027
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,440
Because I'm like...

2028
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:20,940
Are they supposed to be like...

2029
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,600
Thank you.

2030
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,660
Wait, um...

2031
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:30,780
Yeah.

2032
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,720
Wait, it's just like the other side.

2033
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2034
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,380
Maybe she has no idea either.

2035
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,260
Maybe that's why I'm solving these.

2036
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,080
Has she ever...

2037
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,380
Has she ever...

2038
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:49,900
For anybody...

2039
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,280
Any of Daiden fans...

2040
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,260
Has she ever expressed...

2041
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,720
Interest in...

2042
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,140
In...

2043
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:56,980
The...

2044
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:57,560
In the...

2045
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,080
Oh, wait!

2046
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:00,160
Smash!

2047
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,100
It's the Smash logo!

2048
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,980
Raden is Smash!

2049
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,820
She's good for Smash!

2050
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:18,820
She got her invitation!

2051
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:28,380
New challenger!

2052
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:41,460
Nice!

2053
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,040
And...

2054
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:44,460
Three...

2055
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,320
Two...

2056
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:47,740
Two...

2057
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,560
Wait, how...

2058
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,280
What do you mean...

2059
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,040
Oh, that...

2060
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,180
I was like, what do you mean I can do something else here?

2061
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,180
Oh, I didn't even notice the 373 here!

2062
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:00,960
Hehehehe...

2063
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,600
Hmm...

2064
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,440
What could it be?

2065
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,300
It's totally symmetrical mostly...

2066
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:21,780
Like, it's...

2067
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,200
Pretty symmetrical so far.

2068
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,720
It's pretty...

2069
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:29,400
Actually, I...

2070
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,460
I didn't even take a good look at this...

2071
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,820
To see if the whole thing is symmetrical or not.

2072
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,090
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2073
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,070
Not enta...

2074
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,030
ENA-E-E-ER...

2075
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:39,360
L-l-l-l-l-l-l...

2076
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,320
Taruhodo!

2077
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,820
Doesn't seem...

2078
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:44,820
Entirely symmetrical...

2079
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,560
Hmmmm...

2080
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,020
Hmmmm...

2081
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:58,520
Hmm...

2082
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,620
Close, but not quite...

2083
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,040
Yeah...

2084
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:00,500
Oh yeah...

2085
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:00,600
See?

2086
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,340
You can even see...

2087
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,260
Hmm...

2088
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:17,280
Hmm...

2089
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,240
I'll wait...

2090
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:25,960
Let's see...

2091
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:29,790
Yatta!

2092
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:30,950
Yatta!

2093
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:40,590
I like Peek.

2094
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:45,830
I like it normal, man.

2095
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:51,170
Wait.

2096
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,030
Oh, wait.

2097
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:52,690
Undo.

2098
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:56,970
Yeah.

2099
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,490
Wait, show puzzle after we won.

2100
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:00,890
Wait, what does that mean?

2101
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:02,090
Yes?

2102
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:05,650
Peek, thank you so much for the gifted!

2103
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:06,190
Yatagarozu!

2104
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,470
Wait, can I click yes?

2105
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:10,010
Oh, okay.

2106
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,290
Oh,

2107
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:18,760
oh!

2108
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:23,220
Wait, I think it's the...

2109
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,760
The bird logo?

2110
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,000
Oh, yeah, it's the logo.

2111
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,000
Yatagarozu.

2112
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:52,320
It only tells me the thing in the glossary, but it's here.

2113
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,640
That could be a really good name for the club.

2114
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,780
The three-legged crow.

2115
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,420
I'm a Tarasu!

2116
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:38,320
Oh, that's where...

2117
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,320
That's right, that's right.

2118
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:47,540
You can go to the shrine for Amaterasu.

2119
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,440
It's in Ise.

2120
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:52,620
Ise Jingu.

2121
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:58,020
It's really, really nice there.

2122
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:01,480
I suggest it very much.

2123
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,240
Yeah, it's kind of far.

2124
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,680
It's a little past Nagoya.

2125
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,700
But...

2126
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,260
I really...

2127
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,540
It's also like a big town.

2128
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:19,420
And it's all very traditional Japanese...

2129
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:21,760
Flinky.

2130
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,160
Feeling.

2131
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,340
So...

2132
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2133
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:27,760
Utsuho.

2134
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,340
Wait, is this what she is?

2135
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,180
Yatagarasu?

2136
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,640
Is she Yatagarasu?

2137
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:38,790
Utsuho is...

2138
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:39,330
She is?

2139
01:37:39,690 --> 01:37:40,430
I never knew.

2140
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:42,670
Wait, where's her third leg?

2141
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:51,750
The sun on her chest.

2142
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:53,710
The sun on her chest.

2143
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:55,310
I'm looking this up.

2144
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:03,520
Utsu...

2145
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:04,640
Toho.

2146
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,160
Toho.

2147
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:06,700
Toho.

2148
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:12,870
The thing on her chest is always, I thought, like an eyeball thingy.

2149
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,270
There's no bird there.

2150
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:19,470
Is it supposed to be a...

2151
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:22,850
I always thought her arm was like that just because...

2152
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,650
She's radioactive.

2153
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,630
Radioactive.

2154
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,390
Radioactive.

2155
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,050
Sorry.

2156
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,660
Toho is a normal crow who ate...

2157
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:40,680
Yatagarasu.

2158
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,360
I'm me learning Toho lore in this very moment.

2159
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,280
I didn't know that.

2160
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,640
You guys, never...

2161
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,640
Be ashamed of what you don't know.

2162
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,260
Because then you learn something new.

2163
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:07,550
You know?

2164
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:09,590
You can say I'm a fan of something.

2165
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:11,670
And still not know every single thing about it.

2166
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:16,330
It'll be my birthday on Wednesday since you won't be streaming.

2167
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:17,410
Can I trouble you with a happy birthday?

2168
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:18,570
Ruv!

2169
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:19,630
Happy birthday!

2170
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:20,110
Early!

2171
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:21,670
Happy birthday!

2172
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:30,070
My absolute favorite is displayed in the room at the...

2173
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:31,930
She's trying to get me into the back rooms.

2174
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:32,570
Let's go.

2175
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:37,950
I've still got a long way to go myself.

2176
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:38,590
What does that mean?

2177
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,670
Which square should we paint first?

2178
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:44,490
All of them.

2179
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:47,630
End.

2180
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:52,470
Sorry.

2181
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:53,930
I said that kind of loud.

2182
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:58,830
Wow.

2183
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:00,410
Easy.

2184
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:01,850
Easy.

2185
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,210
Easy, easy, easy.

2186
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:22,440
Unlock them.

2187
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,180
Not really.

2188
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,540
I'm actually quite slow with these, I feel.

2189
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:32,760
I'm actually quite slow.

2190
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,600
Because I did make mistakes.

2191
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,040
You know?

2192
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,540
So easy to make a mistake.

2193
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:49,370
I shouldn't be shamed of what I don't know.

2194
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:50,410
I'd like to learn...

2195
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:50,830
Oh.

2196
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:59,190
Well, I'd like to learn what mint stars...

2197
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:01,190
Fee.

2198
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:03,250
Fee.

2199
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:09,570
Fee.

2200
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:12,070
Fwer.

2201
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:14,010
Fwer.

2202
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:15,710
Fwer.

2203
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:28,470
Fwer.

2204
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:29,910
Free, fi, foll, foam.

2205
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:47,270
What game is that from again?

2206
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:52,710
What game is that happening again?

2207
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,070
Oh, oh gosh.

2208
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:57,310
Duh.

2209
01:41:58,370 --> 01:41:58,930
Duh.

2210
01:41:59,150 --> 01:41:59,730
What's it called?

2211
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:01,010
The Summer Games Fest.

2212
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,190
Call of Duty!

2213
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:03,190
That's right.

2214
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:12,230
The Summer Games Fest, when they announced the new Resident Evil, they played us.

2215
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:13,430
Did you guys watch that?

2216
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:19,730
When they did the announcement, I was just like, thanks for supporting Resident Evil.

2217
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:25,070
We'll have some things in the future.

2218
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:30,370
And I was like, I was so... I was like, that's it?

2219
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,210
Really?

2220
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:33,070
Everybody else was too, right?

2221
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:36,850
We got played so hard.

2222
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:43,110
They actually... They actually did such a good job of getting everybody.

2223
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:45,670
It's pretty funny.

2224
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:59,910
And then, but when they showed RE9, and I was like... I first saw it.

2225
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:01,890
I didn't think it was.

2226
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:06,410
...because it looked too good.

2227
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:11,190
But part of me wished it was a new David Cage game.

2228
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:15,890
I was like...

2229
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,600
I was like...

2230
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,940
I saw some people that were saying that they could recognize the engine.

2231
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,040
...uh, like the character's hairs...

2232
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:33,280
...uh...

2233
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,960
...with the engine and everything for it...

2234
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:39,060
...but of course, once I saw the statue and saw the police station...

2235
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:39,900
...I was like, oh, shoot.

2236
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,700
Guys, oh, Raccoon City.

2237
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:45,040
When it was still...

2238
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,140
...I was like...

2239
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:47,200
...I was like, come on!

2240
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:49,140
Give me...

2241
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,020
Give me the next David Cage.

2242
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,100
I'm ready for it.

2243
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:57,900
I'm ready for it.

2244
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:06,640
Do not.

2245
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:07,840
Oh, come on.

2246
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:08,980
I want...

2247
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:12,720
Can't...

2248
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,480
I just have, like, a guilty pleasure?

2249
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:20,080
They're so bad.

2250
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,340
They're so funny, you guys.

2251
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:21,760
Please.

2252
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,280
Please.

2253
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,400
Let me have this.

2254
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:27,720
Please.

2255
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,960
They're peak trash.

2256
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:32,680
I know.

2257
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,000
I love it.

2258
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,200
But...

2259
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:43,940
But alas...

2260
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,240
It was...

2261
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,480
...not that.

2262
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,140
I think people...

2263
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:51,280
I think people would have given up on the gaming industry.

2264
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,660
I think people would have been like, I'll never...

2265
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:56,860
I'll never trust again.

2266
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,480
If...

2267
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:04,820
It would have been great, though.

2268
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,720
Please do tell what cage games have you played.

2269
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,440
I played...

2270
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:12,860
I played...

2271
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:14,200
Detroit...

2272
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,200
Become a human.

2273
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,720
I played...

2274
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:19,600
Uh...

2275
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:20,840
Uh...

2276
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,180
Heavy Rain?

2277
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,540
Is that David Cage?

2278
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,780
Wait, hold on.

2279
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,020
Let me look up David Cage.

2280
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:34,890
Yes.

2281
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,660
Oh, yeah!

2282
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,260
Because it's the Origami Killer.

2283
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,000
Sure!

2284
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:49,900
Sure.

2285
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,160
Um...

2286
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:53,060
Um...

2287
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,650
And that's it.

2288
01:45:57,810 --> 01:45:58,230
I think.

2289
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:03,750
Wait!

2290
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:04,250
No, wait!

2291
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,610
Those are the only two I've done?

2292
01:46:07,690 --> 01:46:09,350
Well, he's only done one...

2293
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:12,090
One...

2294
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:13,470
One, two, three, four, five.

2295
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:15,570
I've played two of that.

2296
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:16,170
Two of them.

2297
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:18,790
Beyond Two Souls.

2298
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:21,550
Yeah, I haven't played that one.

2299
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,310
I have not played that one.

2300
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:30,890
Sounds like you have a backlog.

2301
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:33,650
I have to play through all of them to...

2302
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:36,870
To unlock the new game.

2303
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:38,030
The next...

2304
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:39,690
The next one.

2305
01:46:40,210 --> 01:46:43,010
He'll release a new one as soon as I play it.

2306
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:45,110
As soon as I play any more of them.

2307
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:52,630
When you guys were saying the Beyond Two Souls, I'll be honest.

2308
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,130
I thought you were talking about that.

2309
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:57,650
There's that new game that came out...

2310
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:58,270
Like, I think...

2311
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:00,610
This year or early last year?

2312
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:01,970
Or late last year?

2313
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,070
That was like the...

2314
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:05,330
Two-player game.

2315
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:06,450
That's kind of like...

2316
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:08,510
It takes two, but...

2317
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:10,270
No, I'm pretty sure it came out this year.

2318
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:13,950
And you like play as the ladies that...

2319
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:16,250
Lose their imagination or whatever.

2320
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,110
Split fiction.

2321
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:19,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2322
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:22,130
That's what I was thinking.

2323
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:23,070
You guys are talking.

2324
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:23,570
I was like...

2325
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:24,990
I was about to be like...

2326
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:25,250
He...

2327
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,470
He made that.

2328
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:31,270
Split fiction.

2329
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:40,050
Imagine a Picross game for Mint.

2330
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:41,270
Mintocross.

2331
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:42,650
It would be awesome.

2332
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:43,550
The Wumie.

2333
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:46,790
The Holy Wumie, not Wumie.

2334
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:48,310
Thank you for the peek.

2335
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:51,550
Yeah, it would be awesome, right?

2336
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:52,950
Maybe...

2337
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:54,310
Maybe next game I do...

2338
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:55,430
Will be a Picross.

2339
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:57,330
Picross style.

2340
01:47:58,270 --> 01:47:59,510
A dot puzzle.

2341
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:01,430
Dot puzzle game.

2342
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:10,490
Two.

2343
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:12,990
Four.

2344
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:14,930
Six.

2345
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:16,750
Hey, who do we appreciate?

2346
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:25,470
What would the pictures be, though?

2347
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:27,710
I don't know.

2348
01:48:29,950 --> 01:48:33,210
Oh, we got big, big Raden.

2349
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:33,450
No!

2350
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:57,810
I've been to a couple of落語...

2351
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:59,410
...performances.

2352
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:26,910
The lakugo anime... Is that the one that has that really catchy song?

2353
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:34,550
Why are you laughing?

2354
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:35,630
Why are you laughing?

2355
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:42,030
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2356
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:59,550
Oh, that's right.

2357
01:49:59,570 --> 01:49:59,830
Oh.

2358
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:07,830
Omicron.

2359
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:14,690
Well, do you like which ones you like?

2360
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:19,650
If you like which ones, you will be happy to see which ones you like.

2361
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:22,630
She's so cute.

2362
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:24,530
I'm a Cron.

2363
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:27,430
It's David Cage's first game and he possessed people to further the plot.

2364
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:28,850
It also has David Bowie.

2365
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:31,870
Why would you want her to suffer?

2366
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:36,250
Yeah, the Joshi Roku song is so...

2367
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:48,090
It's so catchy.

2368
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:50,710
Look how cute she is.

2369
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:53,350
So cute.

2370
01:50:55,710 --> 01:50:58,590
We got the special art.

2371
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,760
Shooting on her.

2372
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,820
Omicron will drive you insane.

2373
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,320
Look how cute she is looking at it.

2374
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:11,500
Oh.

2375
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:13,360
She looked at me.

2376
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:20,210
I guess we move on to the...

2377
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:21,090
Next area?

2378
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:22,550
How do I do that?

2379
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:23,690
I guess from here.

2380
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:27,030
Yeah.

2381
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:31,150
Oh, it's all like...

2382
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:31,810
It's all things...

2383
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:34,490
I didn't even notice that...

2384
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:36,950
The topic was her.

2385
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:42,090
Western paintings.

2386
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:44,010
10 by 20.

2387
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:46,030
40 by 30 already?

2388
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:47,570
At level 14?

2389
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,390
Am I ready?

2390
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,520
Oh my gosh.

2391
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:56,420
It's so ugly.

2392
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:59,060
I like how it's like...

2393
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:00,000
You can do these ones.

2394
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,020
It's so ugly.

2395
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:04,680
It's so ugly.

2396
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,940
Easy peasy.

2397
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:09,600
It's so ugly.

2398
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:10,920
It's so ugly.

2399
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:13,320
It's so ugly.

2400
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,200
Yeah.

2401
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:16,100
And then...

2402
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:19,080
Right?

2403
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,560
I have a counter.

2404
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,880
And these are all...

2405
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:25,800
These all should be six.

2406
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:26,100
Yeah.

2407
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,360
Six, six.

2408
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:29,760
Six, six, six.

2409
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:30,400
Stay open.

2410
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,760
Eight, eight.

2411
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,520
Yattou!

2412
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:33,500
Yattou!

2413
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,420
No music?

2414
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,780
The difficulty spikes pretty early in the game.

2415
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,260
I like that though.

2416
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:55,460
Because...

2417
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,000
Oh, wait.

2418
01:52:59,120 --> 01:52:59,580
Did I...

2419
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:01,300
Miss Kiao?

2420
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,280
No.

2421
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:03,880
Okay.

2422
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:04,940
We're good, we're good.

2423
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:05,740
I like...

2424
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:06,760
I like that...

2425
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:07,880
This is made...

2426
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,060
Kind of more for...

2427
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:10,240
P-Cross fans.

2428
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,080
Rather than...

2429
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,600
Because sometimes...

2430
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,940
You know, I love Meow Tower.

2431
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,200
That's an app...

2432
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,740
That I play every day.

2433
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:20,900
For...

2434
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,160
For nonograms.

2435
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:22,620
But it's...

2436
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,400
It's really, really easy.

2437
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:29,400
It's really, really, really easy.

2438
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,280
Oh, 13.

2439
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:31,080
Wow.

2440
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,240
Wait, is this 13?

2441
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:34,560
It is.

2442
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,800
Silly minto.

2443
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,960
What am I selling for?

2444
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:44,280
What?

2445
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:47,940
We messed up.

2446
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,600
Where did I mess up at?

2447
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:07,210
The first column.

2448
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:12,710
Let's restart.

2449
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,510
Wait.

2450
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:17,210
Actually, wait.

2451
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,630
Yeah, let's restart.

2452
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:20,230
All right, let me rewind.

2453
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:21,390
Let's see where I move.

2454
01:54:21,630 --> 01:54:22,550
Maitake, maitake.

2455
01:54:22,710 --> 01:54:23,770
Guru, guru, guru, guru.

2456
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:24,790
What's it a new bee?

2457
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:30,650
Why did I think that was a thing?

2458
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:31,510
Why did I do that?

2459
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:34,410
Okay.

2460
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:41,970
There we go.

2461
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:46,770
Wow, I really messed that one apart.

2462
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:50,050
That's why you called me silly.

2463
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:55,130
Surely not.

2464
01:54:57,890 --> 01:54:58,990
Where am I?

2465
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:01,210
You're at a phantom channel.

2466
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:10,570
You're at the museum.

2467
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:12,630
We're learning art today.

2468
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:18,880
We're becoming really educated and cultured and...

2469
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:22,590
We're becoming...

2470
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,430
We're becoming artists.

2471
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:29,130
I went to our museum not too long ago, actually.

2472
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:32,110
Um, I went to a Van Gogh exhibit.

2473
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:34,890
And you know what I learned about that guy?

2474
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:37,650
That guy is the original weeaboo.

2475
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:44,260
That guy is the original weeaboo.

2476
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:45,560
He used to draw...

2477
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:46,700
He used to...

2478
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,520
We wish that...

2479
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,560
Like, he were Japanese.

2480
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:50,200
And he would like...

2481
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,680
He would like...

2482
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,520
Draw...

2483
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:52,860
Like...

2484
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,200
Yeah, he was obsessed with Japan.

2485
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:05,090
He was kind of...

2486
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:05,930
Kind of crazy.

2487
01:56:09,310 --> 01:56:11,750
Japanese art was a big trend in Europe then.

2488
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:13,290
Yeah, it was crazy.

2489
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:17,810
When I saw that, I was like...

2490
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:18,010
Wow.

2491
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:19,790
He's just like me.

2492
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:20,710
For real, for real.

2493
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:26,150
I don't think I should cut off my ears.

2494
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:28,990
Ear?

2495
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:30,610
Ear.

2496
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:35,870
I can't...

2497
01:56:35,870 --> 01:56:38,410
Okay, so what I've done basically is...

2498
01:56:38,410 --> 01:56:40,090
Because I've completed down here...

2499
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:42,850
I've completely written off that part of the map.

2500
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,290
And I was just like...

2501
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:44,750
Wait a second.

2502
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:45,370
I messed up.

2503
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:46,750
I don't have enough for six.

2504
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:49,710
I've completely...

2505
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:51,370
Just written that off.

2506
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,130
Only one ear for art powers.

2507
01:56:58,590 --> 01:56:59,610
Oh my god.

2508
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:00,590
That sounds like...

2509
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:04,070
If Austin Powers wanted to be...

2510
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,490
Um...

2511
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:09,150
Wanted to be...

2512
01:57:09,150 --> 01:57:09,570
Van Gogh...

2513
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:12,430
He could be...

2514
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:13,410
He could be...

2515
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:14,030
He could be...

2516
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:15,530
Artin Powers.

2517
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:20,850
Mako, welcome to membership.

2518
01:57:21,110 --> 01:57:21,770
Thank you!

2519
01:57:22,610 --> 01:57:24,090
Don't minus two of me.

2520
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:29,090
You guys all know what to do.

2521
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:29,710
No, it was good.

2522
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,500
Why couldn't the artist drive his car?

2523
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,480
He didn't have the Monet to...

2524
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:41,900
De...

2525
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,700
Degas to make the van go.

2526
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:49,620
My...

2527
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:50,640
Minus two.

2528
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,860
You guys all know what to do.

2529
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,040
When...

2530
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:03,420
If you're new to this channel...

2531
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:04,640
Uh oh.

2532
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:05,560
Wait, I messed up.

2533
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:07,420
Oh, just kidding.

2534
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:08,260
I didn't mess up.

2535
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,480
I'm actually a genius.

2536
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:13,840
Um...

2537
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,360
When you...

2538
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:14,940
Yeah, boo!

2539
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:15,580
See?

2540
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:16,580
Boo!

2541
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:20,280
I knew you liked it.

2542
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,900
Stop being so tsundere.

2543
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,120
I knew you liked it.

2544
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,300
Wait.

2545
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,040
Wait.

2546
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:31,820
Oh.

2547
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:40,250
What is this?

2548
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:40,970
Oh wait, this...

2549
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:42,870
It's the Mona Lisa!

2550
01:58:44,210 --> 01:58:46,210
It's the Mona Lisa, it's the Mona Lisa.

2551
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:48,670
I was like, what's the topic?

2552
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:49,510
Western art.

2553
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:50,570
Mona Lisa.

2554
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:56,370
It looks like the Minecraft version of her.

2555
01:58:56,890 --> 01:58:58,070
Look at that nose.

2556
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:04,870
Jump scared by the real Mona Lisa.

2557
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:06,110
Wait, no, no.

2558
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:07,190
Oh, what?

2559
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,030
What are you saying to me?

2560
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:12,150
What does this mean?

2561
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:15,350
S-F-S-Fumato.

2562
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:21,930
This really looks like the Minecraft version, though, doesn't it?

2563
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:24,810
Because it's like the villager nose.

2564
01:59:26,730 --> 01:59:28,850
I thought she was telling me to S-TF you.

2565
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:44,550
You already know the monster Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa, right?

2566
01:59:44,550 --> 01:59:44,630
Oh, that's right.

2567
01:59:45,330 --> 01:59:47,590
DaVinci's Mona Lisa's character.

2568
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:49,030
S-Fumato.

2569
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:04,510
S-Fumato.

2570
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:07,090
And we can also add the other characters to the other characters.

2571
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:13,350
Wow, I feel like I'm actually learning so much...

2572
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,550
...from this note.

2573
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:19,150
I feel like I'm actually learning so much.

2574
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:32,180
This one, you guys, is three stars.

2575
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,780
Will we be okay?

2576
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,280
Will we be okay?

2577
02:00:41,540 --> 02:00:42,620
I did it!

2578
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,270
Oh wait, wrong one.

2579
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:03,410
There we go.

2580
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:25,630
We need to game in?

2581
02:01:26,330 --> 02:01:26,910
Where?

2582
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,060
That's great!

2583
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:53,440
That's right!

2584
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:08,800
What is this?

2585
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:10,600
Seven.

2586
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:12,660
Easy.

2587
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:20,070
Yeah.

2588
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:53,680
It's hard.

2589
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,160
It's

2590
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:25,510
good!

2591
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:27,410
It's cool!

2592
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:39,990
What is it?

2593
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:43,710
We're losing her.

2594
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:46,670
I'm already gone.

2595
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:50,210
I'm already gone.

2596
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:13,530
Here.

2597
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:16,850
Sometimes it's hard to count.

2598
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:21,010
Sometimes counting do be hard though.

2599
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:22,650
Oh, we can finish this one.

2600
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:27,950
Finish that one.

2601
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:28,970
That one.

2602
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:42,200
She's locked in.

2603
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,140
I'm locked in.

2604
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:48,860
Yeah.

2605
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:52,020
Sometimes I just go into the trance.

2606
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:56,420
It's the... it's the... nonogram trance.

2607
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,040
There we go.

2608
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,660
Yattou.

2609
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,460
Yep.

2610
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:05,840
Yep.

2611
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,020
I see.

2612
02:05:23,470 --> 02:05:25,530
We did it!

2613
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:31,430
What is that?

2614
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:35,430
Spooky time!

2615
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,200
I don't think I recognize this one.

2616
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:50,900
I don't think I recognize this one.

2617
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:52,720
Oh.

2618
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:56,000
She look... yeah, she look mad.

2619
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:00,100
One thing I do like watching is...

2620
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:01,780
Is like art...

2621
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:04,000
Not art commentary.

2622
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,420
Art dissection videos.

2623
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:08,500
And like when they're just like...

2624
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,860
As you can see, she's wearing a glove.

2625
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:12,960
That means she's...

2626
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,340
She's only wearing one glove.

2627
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:17,420
She's held back by society.

2628
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:19,640
And you can see that there's a...

2629
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:22,180
There's a pearl on the ground.

2630
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:23,240
Which...

2631
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,960
That indicates...

2632
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,240
That means that...

2633
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:28,260
It symbolizes...

2634
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:29,700
Symbolizes...

2635
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,340
Her want to escape.

2636
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,000
Symbolism analysis.

2637
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:35,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2638
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:37,660
FNAF lore, but with paintings.

2639
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,600
I like...

2640
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:42,580
I like watching those.

2641
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:48,680
They're pretty fascinating.

2642
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:50,460
Especially when they're like...

2643
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,180
Paintings that are...

2644
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:54,300
Kind of based off of real...

2645
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:54,840
Events.

2646
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:56,460
Like...

2647
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,440
Or like stories.

2648
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:58,620
So...

2649
02:06:58,620 --> 02:06:59,360
There's one...

2650
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:01,420
I can't remember what it's called right now.

2651
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:05,540
Maybe if I describe it...

2652
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:06,160
Somebody will know.

2653
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,540
But um...

2654
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,880
There's one where it's like...

2655
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,140
Family dinner.

2656
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:14,720
Or family...

2657
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:15,920
Food time.

2658
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:18,880
And...

2659
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,460
The story is that...

2660
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:27,630
The brothers are about to murder...

2661
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,380
Their sister's husband.

2662
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:30,900
They're about to behead him.

2663
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:32,840
Because...

2664
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:33,920
Some...

2665
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:34,100
Some...

2666
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:36,900
Some renaissance nonsense.

2667
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:37,460
You know?

2668
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:40,440
They're beheading everybody back then.

2669
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,840
But...

2670
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:44,650
The painting is them at...

2671
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:48,180
At the dinner table together.

2672
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:51,600
And um...

2673
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:52,540
Uh...

2674
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,800
The way that they're like...

2675
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,760
Looking at him...

2676
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,520
Oh gosh...

2677
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:56,020
Oh...

2678
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:57,380
Let me see if I can find it.

2679
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:58,960
Just a normal day.

2680
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,880
I wonder if I could put in context clues.

2681
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,500
Painting?

2682
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:16,410
If I see the painting...

2683
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:16,510
I'll...

2684
02:08:16,510 --> 02:08:17,090
Oh no...

2685
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:18,270
I'm just getting beheadings now.

2686
02:08:19,610 --> 02:08:20,230
Oh no.

2687
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:24,770
I'm just getting paintings and beheadings now.

2688
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:26,450
I think I messed up.

2689
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,720
Oh my gosh though.

2690
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:34,680
I also really love this painting.

2691
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:37,040
The one of Lady Jane Grey.

2692
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:37,840
Ugh!

2693
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:38,820
Oh my gosh.

2694
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:39,820
It's so...

2695
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:41,120
Hauntingly beautiful.

2696
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,600
If you've never seen it before.

2697
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:43,720
It's also...

2698
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:45,440
Based on a real person.

2699
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:46,960
Who...

2700
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:47,500
She...

2701
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,380
She...

2702
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,740
Kind of got used...

2703
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:50,340
Not kind of.

2704
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:51,780
She got used by her family.

2705
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,200
And she was like...

2706
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,340
She was like...

2707
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:55,140
What was it?

2708
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:55,680
Sorry.

2709
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,800
I'm gonna get the history wrong.

2710
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:57,520
Cause...

2711
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,260
Right now my brain.

2712
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,000
But she...

2713
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,060
She was like...

2714
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:02,460
Back in...

2715
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:02,960
Hold on.

2716
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:04,380
Let me just read it.

2717
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:05,140
So I don't get it wrong.

2718
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:07,900
Lady...

2719
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:08,040
Whoa.

2720
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:08,620
What is that?

2721
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:09,540
Whoa.

2722
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:10,340
That's crazy.

2723
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:11,080
Ooh!

2724
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:13,580
Lady...

2725
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:15,880
Jane Grey.

2726
02:09:18,980 --> 02:09:20,860
Yeah, she was the Queen of England for like three weeks.

2727
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,260
Yeah, for like a super short amount of time.

2728
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:24,660
And...

2729
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:25,160
Because like...

2730
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,400
Her family was...

2731
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:27,300
Like...

2732
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:28,300
Feuding and everything.

2733
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,280
About who was going to become...

2734
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:30,920
The...

2735
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:31,700
The rulers.

2736
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:33,560
And...

2737
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:34,720
Uh...

2738
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:36,160
She was like...

2739
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:37,280
Just a kid.

2740
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:38,560
And they...

2741
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,180
They...

2742
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:40,420
They executed her.

2743
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:42,040
Because she was...

2744
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,440
She was the Queen.

2745
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:44,920
But...

2746
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:46,340
It was like so messed up.

2747
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:47,080
They used her.

2748
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:48,640
So crazy.

2749
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:52,220
The nine days queen.

2750
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:52,840
Not...

2751
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:54,760
I remember it was like a couple days.

2752
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:55,760
Like it was ridiculous.

2753
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:58,640
Back in 15...

2754
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,280
54.

2755
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,680
She was a scapegoat.

2756
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:06,680
So sad.

2757
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:09,400
That's crazy.

2758
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:10,940
Gosh.

2759
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:14,240
They were just beheading everybody back then, huh?

2760
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:14,960
The good...

2761
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,020
The good old days.

2762
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,420
You know what?

2763
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,600
We should have...

2764
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,780
More black playing.

2765
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,880
Eliza and Jonathan, I said Isabella by...

2766
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:27,980
Let me see.

2767
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:30,220
Thank you.

2768
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:37,830
Oh.

2769
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:38,310
My.

2770
02:10:38,650 --> 02:10:38,850
God.

2771
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:39,690
That's...

2772
02:10:39,690 --> 02:10:41,010
The painting I was talking about.

2773
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:43,370
Isabella by...

2774
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:44,390
Melaius.

2775
02:10:45,190 --> 02:10:45,750
Melaius?

2776
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:47,750
Melaius?

2777
02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:49,950
Yeah.

2778
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:51,310
That's the one I was talking about.

2779
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:52,530
Where they're at the dinner table.

2780
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:54,210
And they're like glaring at the husband.

2781
02:10:54,690 --> 02:10:55,190
And...

2782
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:55,870
And...

2783
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:57,850
He's gonna die.

2784
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,750
And everybody at the table knows it.

2785
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:00,690
Oh my gosh.

2786
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:02,090
Yeah.

2787
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:03,250
That's the one.

2788
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:05,190
And they're like...

2789
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:07,570
He's like pointing at him with his toes.

2790
02:11:13,650 --> 02:11:14,250
Melaius.

2791
02:11:14,610 --> 02:11:15,190
Oh, maybe.

2792
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:18,970
Ah.

2793
02:11:19,890 --> 02:11:20,990
That's a good one.

2794
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:21,550
Yeah.

2795
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:25,750
The analysis on this painting is so fascinating.

2796
02:11:29,310 --> 02:11:29,870
Anyway.

2797
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:30,670
Sorry.

2798
02:11:30,990 --> 02:11:34,090
Let's listen to the commentary about this one that I have no idea about.

2799
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:37,430
Oh.

2800
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:41,370
Oh.

2801
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:44,490
It's Da Vinki.

2802
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:51,650
Oh.

2803
02:11:55,630 --> 02:11:56,570
Oh.

2804
02:11:56,570 --> 02:11:57,570
Oh.

2805
02:11:58,510 --> 02:11:59,210
Oh.

2806
02:12:01,410 --> 02:12:02,810
Oh.

2807
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:09,410
It's like a good angle.

2808
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,430
I feel.

2809
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:14,930
Oh.

2810
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,790
It's like a good angle.

2811
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:23,190
I feel.

2812
02:12:24,490 --> 02:12:24,930
Oh.

2813
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:41,260
Dovinki bros know Fuomoku, so maybe...

2814
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:42,820
That's so crazy.

2815
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:46,080
They're actually so funny.

2816
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:49,220
The... Dovinki bros...

2817
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:52,600
I don't remember what their names are, but they're actually so funny.

2818
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:54,040
I like their videos.

2819
02:12:57,220 --> 02:13:01,760
Does it ever occur to you, Vinto, that Dovinki bros have their own individual names?

2820
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:03,040
Yeah, it's...

2821
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,520
Patrick and...

2822
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:09,300
Uh...

2823
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,140
I don't remember the other guy's name.

2824
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:12,980
Boros twins!

2825
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:19,040
I know, because what their Riz names is Patriz and...

2826
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:21,500
Uh...

2827
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:23,720
The other guy...

2828
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,060
I can't remember his Riz name.

2829
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:33,660
Chris?

2830
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,360
I don't remember.

2831
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:37,580
Is it Chris?

2832
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:40,580
Chris?

2833
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,260
Oh yeah, because it was Chris and Patriz!

2834
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,180
What's your Riz name?

2835
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:47,260
Minto.

2836
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:03,120
Got an interview this week.

2837
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:03,700
Wow!

2838
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:06,360
And he made magic for something like that.

2839
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:15,220
Let me go consult the handbook in the bathroom.

2840
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:16,660
I'll be right back.

2841
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:18,360
Guys,

2842
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:14,310
I'm gonna be honest.

2843
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:15,740
My voice is...

2844
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:18,850
Starting to feel a little strained.

2845
02:17:20,130 --> 02:17:20,670
So...

2846
02:17:20,670 --> 02:17:24,050
I think I can do one more puzzle, and then I will...

2847
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:25,390
Um...

2848
02:17:25,390 --> 02:17:26,670
I will...

2849
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:27,450
Uh...

2850
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:28,630
Call it there, probably.

2851
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:31,690
I'm sorry.

2852
02:17:32,390 --> 02:17:32,770
Oh, whoops.

2853
02:17:33,490 --> 02:17:33,750
Not bad.

2854
02:17:35,090 --> 02:17:35,710
There we go.

2855
02:17:36,630 --> 02:17:38,230
So I think I can do one more puzzle.

2856
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:39,390
One more.

2857
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:40,530
Unless it's really easy.

2858
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:43,050
15 by 15.

2859
02:17:43,250 --> 02:17:43,810
Okay, let's try...

2860
02:17:44,930 --> 02:17:46,590
Let's try the 40 by 30.

2861
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:49,930
Let's try a 40 by 30.

2862
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:52,850
Um...

2863
02:17:52,850 --> 02:17:52,970
Oh!

2864
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:54,030
For your...

2865
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:54,350
Micmac.

2866
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:55,450
For your interview.

2867
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:56,630
Nei nei.

2868
02:18:00,470 --> 02:18:00,790
Just...

2869
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:04,640
Uh...

2870
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:06,000
You...

2871
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:08,080
Should...

2872
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:13,920
Mention the maid.

2873
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:15,900
This is my...

2874
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:20,400
This is my first ever full...

2875
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:22,360
Okay...

2876
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:23,000
Wait...

2877
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:23,640
Uh...

2878
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:25,160
When I played Nancy Drew...

2879
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:26,640
If anybody watched that...

2880
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:27,520
Here...

2881
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:29,920
I said that...

2882
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:30,960
One of the ones that I did...

2883
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:32,260
Was the largest that I have done.

2884
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,640
This is the one that took me 5 hours.

2885
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:40,440
I can't remember if it was 20 by 20...

2886
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:42,400
Or 25 by 25...

2887
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:47,420
Start...

2888
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,640
Let's see...

2889
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,720
We're gonna be relying on the counter here.

2890
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:52,280
A lot.

2891
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:01,100
22.

2892
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,900
It was 25 by 25.

2893
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:08,160
25 by 25.

2894
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:11,880
So this would be the biggest one that I'll ever challenge.

2895
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:15,080
I'm scared.

2896
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,680
I don't even know...

2897
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,240
Where...

2898
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,700
How are these possible?

2899
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:24,600
These ones...

2900
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:25,380
Okay...

2901
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:27,180
Three...

2902
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:31,700
Ten...

2903
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:35,120
One...

2904
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:43,300
Three...

2905
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:44,920
Like that...

2906
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:47,700
Like that...

2907
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:52,620
Middle click or holding V as a pencil.

2908
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:55,480
Oh...

2909
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:57,560
Interesting...

2910
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,060
I didn't realize that...

2911
02:19:59,060 --> 02:19:59,780
Thank you...

2912
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:02,160
I don't know...

2913
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,700
When I would use that though...

2914
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:04,580
Hmm...

2915
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:06,820
So this is 10...

2916
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:09,760
10...

2917
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:10,160
Wow...

2918
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,620
It really is 40...

2919
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:14,640
So 19 would be almost half...

2920
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:16,140
No...

2921
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:16,620
Oh yeah...

2922
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:17,920
So...

2923
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:18,320
Let's see...

2924
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:19,240
Hold on...

2925
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:22,560
19 would be almost...

2926
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:22,800
Half...

2927
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:25,020
So I feel like we can...

2928
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:26,760
Go to like here...

2929
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:27,320
Right...

2930
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:28,880
I'm just guessing...

2931
02:20:29,560 --> 02:20:31,120
Maybe I messed that up...

2932
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:31,540
Let's...

2933
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:32,120
Get rid of it...

2934
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:33,540
Get rid of it...

2935
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:34,880
Okay, hold on...

2936
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:35,540
2...

2937
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:38,780
1...

2938
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:39,880
1...

2939
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:40,200
2...

2940
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:41,680
3...

2941
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:44,840
13...

2942
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:45,340
14...

2943
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:45,680
15...

2944
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:46,200
16...

2945
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:48,120
19...

2946
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:49,960
Like that...

2947
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:58,920
Holy...

2948
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:00,520
Holy...

2949
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:01,480
This is...

2950
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,220
Intimidating Phil...

2951
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:04,020
Thank you so much for the fun...

2952
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:05,040
Good to thank you...

2953
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,480
For people who came in...

2954
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:15,660
A little later...

2955
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:16,920
And are kind of like...

2956
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:18,120
How do you play this game?

2957
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:19,580
I don't understand it at all...

2958
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:21,520
At the very beginning of the stream...

2959
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:21,940
Uh...

2960
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:22,640
We went through the tutorial...

2961
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:25,100
So if you're like...

2962
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:25,340
I...

2963
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:26,740
I don't understand the rules...

2964
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:27,280
But I...

2965
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:28,520
I'm curious...

2966
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,520
You can watch that...

2967
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:31,700
And uh...

2968
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:33,920
It'll probably help you a little bit...

2969
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,240
2...

2970
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:36,820
1...

2971
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:37,300
2...

2972
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:38,260
3... 4...

2973
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:40,160
1...

2974
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:40,500
2...

2975
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:40,760
3...

2976
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:41,300
4...

2977
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:41,680
5...

2978
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,180
6...

2979
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,000
Oh wait...

2980
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,180
Let's put that...

2981
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:45,540
That's where 6 is...

2982
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:46,040
Okay...

2983
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:47,560
So 3...

2984
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:49,240
1...

2985
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:52,040
10...

2986
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:54,700
10...

2987
02:21:55,980 --> 02:21:56,900
1...

2988
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:57,240
2...

2989
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:57,400
3...

2990
02:21:57,400 --> 02:21:57,880
4...

2991
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:58,160
5...

2992
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:58,360
6...

2993
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:58,900
Dang...

2994
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,240
Wow...

2995
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,240
It's cute...

2996
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:00,540
What?

2997
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:11,410
Okay...

2998
02:22:12,790 --> 02:22:13,510
1...

2999
02:22:14,970 --> 02:22:15,690
1...

3000
02:22:15,690 --> 02:22:15,910
2...

3001
02:22:15,910 --> 02:22:16,230
3...

3002
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:16,790
4...

3003
02:22:17,410 --> 02:22:17,770
1...

3004
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:18,130
2...

3005
02:22:18,130 --> 02:22:18,410
3...

3006
02:22:18,410 --> 02:22:19,090
4...

3007
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:19,430
5...

3008
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:21,110
6...

3009
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:22,150
1...

3010
02:22:22,150 --> 02:22:23,090
10...

3011
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:23,530
Wow...

3012
02:22:23,530 --> 02:22:25,170
I can only fill that one in...

3013
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,010
Wow...

3014
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:29,550
This is kind of crazy...

3015
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:31,330
This is kind of...

3016
02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:32,430
Cookie...

3017
02:22:33,710 --> 02:22:34,670
1...

3018
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:39,850
Now I'm understanding the point of this...

3019
02:22:39,850 --> 02:22:42,070
So 5...

3020
02:22:43,690 --> 02:22:45,090
Yeah...

3021
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:46,430
Missed you...

3022
02:22:47,290 --> 02:22:48,250
Oh...

3023
02:22:56,770 --> 02:23:01,500
There has to be...

3024
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:02,200
That...

3025
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:03,680
It is 11...

3026
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,680
Yo, yo, yo... To 10.

3027
02:23:08,260 --> 02:23:09,020
Right?

3028
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:09,860
Wait.

3029
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:11,500
Yeah, yeah.

3030
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:11,820
Okay.

3031
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:13,780
And... 9.

3032
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:15,720
I don't wanna... Wait.

3033
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:16,320
Wait.

3034
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,080
Yes.

3035
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,400
Yes.

3036
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:23,160
Yes.

3037
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:23,960
Okay, okay.

3038
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:27,940
Wait, how is this... 10?

3039
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:31,280
But this is not... Ah!

3040
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,540
Because it's not 10.

3041
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:33,560
It's not 11.

3042
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:33,840
Okay.

3043
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:34,860
We're fine.

3044
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:35,140
We're fine.

3045
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:35,400
We're fine.

3046
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:36,460
Okay.

3047
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:39,080
One down too.

3048
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:41,000
And keep going down.

3049
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:42,480
Keep going down.

3050
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:45,940
We can still do stuff there.

3051
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:52,000
Okay, we can still do stuff here.

3052
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:53,060
Interesting.

3053
02:24:02,050 --> 02:24:04,550
I know how to play this, and this one is pretty daunting.

3054
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:05,250
Yeah.

3055
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:08,230
Luckily, there's a lot of pretty big numbers.

3056
02:24:10,490 --> 02:24:11,690
I believe in us.

3057
02:24:11,950 --> 02:24:12,430
Team!

3058
02:24:12,970 --> 02:24:14,430
I believe in us.

3059
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:15,790
Okay, so this is...

3060
02:24:15,790 --> 02:24:16,850
Currently 9.

3061
02:24:23,010 --> 02:24:23,490
Right.

3062
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:27,730
It has to be like that.

3063
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:30,270
Wait, so...

3064
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:31,790
Let's say this is 10.

3065
02:24:32,250 --> 02:24:32,430
Skip.

3066
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:35,450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

3067
02:24:35,450 --> 02:24:35,630
Ah!

3068
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:36,270
Wait.

3069
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:38,250
So then...

3070
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:39,850
So then...

3071
02:24:40,570 --> 02:24:41,890
That one is not.

3072
02:24:44,590 --> 02:24:45,930
That one can't be.

3073
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:48,190
Because...

3074
02:24:48,190 --> 02:24:49,290
The 9 there.

3075
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:53,670
I think you can do that entire leftmost column that's blue.

3076
02:24:54,430 --> 02:24:55,030
This one?

3077
02:24:58,190 --> 02:24:59,790
Oh, I don't...

3078
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:00,870
Think so.

3079
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:01,670
Can't you?

3080
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:04,090
1...

3081
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:06,110
1...

3082
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:06,450
1...

3083
02:25:07,570 --> 02:25:08,170
1...

3084
02:25:08,170 --> 02:25:08,570
Wait...

3085
02:25:08,570 --> 02:25:09,230
1...

3086
02:25:09,230 --> 02:25:10,070
1...

3087
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:11,130
1...

3088
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:11,310
1...

3089
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:14,470
8...

3090
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:16,210
1, 2, 3...

3091
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:17,010
I don't think so.

3092
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:34,170
Hold on, wait a minute.

3093
02:25:36,090 --> 02:25:36,390
Wait...

3094
02:25:36,390 --> 02:25:37,490
I can't...

3095
02:25:37,490 --> 02:25:39,250
It's hard keeping track of...

3096
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:40,210
Okay, so that's 12.

3097
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:40,670
Yes.

3098
02:26:02,670 --> 02:26:06,290
What I'm so interested in is...

3099
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:07,670
How this is going to look.

3100
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:09,430
Because it's so huge.

3101
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:11,150
It's going to be so intricate.

3102
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:12,690
Oh gosh.

3103
02:26:12,690 --> 02:26:13,870
It's going to look so good.

3104
02:26:14,270 --> 02:26:15,270
I'm so excited.

3105
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:16,090
Oh my gosh.

3106
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:16,690
It's going to look...

3107
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:18,370
It's going to look exactly like the painting.

3108
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:19,730
It's going to be so detailed.

3109
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:24,570
Yeah.

3110
02:26:25,130 --> 02:26:25,210
Okay.

3111
02:26:25,370 --> 02:26:26,310
So, pretend this is 7.

3112
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:27,670
1...

3113
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:29,230
1...

3114
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:29,470
1...

3115
02:26:30,170 --> 02:26:30,610
1...

3116
02:26:39,410 --> 02:26:53,230
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

3117
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:00,340
8.

3118
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:04,940
How can I still do more here?

3119
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:05,840
Are you kidding me?

3120
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:07,420
Oh.

3121
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:08,600
Because I only went to 8.

3122
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:09,740
I did.

3123
02:27:17,470 --> 02:27:17,990
Oopsie.

3124
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:23,670
Calling it great wave of Kanagawa.

3125
02:27:25,050 --> 02:27:25,830
Good guess.

3126
02:27:29,470 --> 02:27:31,610
Throw in your bets, everybody.

3127
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:34,210
Throw in your bets.

3128
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:34,790
Throw in your...

3129
02:27:34,790 --> 02:27:35,850
Throw in your butts?

3130
02:27:36,310 --> 02:27:38,150
Throw in your butts.

3131
02:27:40,010 --> 02:27:44,270
1, 2, 1, space.

3132
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:45,690
2, space.

3133
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:46,790
3, space.

3134
02:27:47,370 --> 02:27:49,450
6, space.

3135
02:27:50,130 --> 02:27:51,690
1, space.

3136
02:27:52,090 --> 02:27:52,930
2, space.

3137
02:27:54,930 --> 02:27:56,470
3, space.

3138
02:27:56,910 --> 02:28:00,230
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3139
02:28:00,350 --> 02:28:01,030
Okay.

3140
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:03,990
Okay, okay.

3141
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:11,220
Wait, oh yes, so then this has to be here.

3142
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,020
Wait, no, this is, it can't be a great wave.

3143
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:26,820
It has to be a western painting.

3144
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,220
It's a western painting, that's what the theme is.

3145
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:37,040
What could it be?

3146
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:46,900
Starry night?

3147
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:50,060
The great western wave.

3148
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:52,480
Great wave with a cowboy hat.

3149
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:02,560
I lost it.

3150
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:03,980
Wait.

3151
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:12,200
Oh, that was satisfying.

3152
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:15,320
And then we can probably...

3153
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:16,780
19.

3154
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:20,020
Ah... We can do this.

3155
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:24,700
11.

3156
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:25,180
Yeah.

3157
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:27,120
We can do that.

3158
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:32,340
Hold on, hold on.

3159
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:33,540
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

3160
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,620
This one's tricky, you guys.

3161
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:46,860
This one's a lot.

3162
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:50,100
This one's so much.

3163
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:52,320
This one's so much.

3164
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:04,120
The scream?

3165
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:06,320
What's that guy's name?

3166
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:07,960
Munch Crunch?

3167
02:30:24,910 --> 02:30:26,150
Bad apple.

3168
02:30:26,830 --> 02:30:27,710
I see Remu?

3169
02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:29,690
Actually, no.

3170
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:32,470
This is the moon and Marisa is flying towards it.

3171
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:43,360
It says we can do this one too.

3172
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:44,140
Let's see.

3173
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:45,400
19.

3174
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:47,580
I can't do, like, the division math, you know?

3175
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,420
That's the part that gets me.

3176
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:51,880
Or, like, you know, like...

3177
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:52,020
Oh.

3178
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:52,940
Okay.

3179
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:56,940
I have to, like, be like, okay, can I do seven here?

3180
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:58,800
And then...

3181
02:30:58,800 --> 02:30:59,140
Five.

3182
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:01,440
No, you can't.

3183
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:03,720
Okay, so the six and seven have to be...

3184
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:04,620
Okay, so...

3185
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:06,000
Six goes to here.

3186
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:08,200
Seven goes to here.

3187
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:11,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3188
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:16,100
Eye fatigue.

3189
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:16,800
Yeah.

3190
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:19,320
And then...

3191
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:19,520
Space.

3192
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:22,200
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3193
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:22,880
I don't know.

3194
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:24,860
I think...

3195
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:27,020
I think, I think.

3196
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:27,920
And then five...

3197
02:31:30,220 --> 02:31:30,700
Purashur.

3198
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:32,580
Six.

3199
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:36,880
Okay, so then...

3200
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,000
One, two...

3201
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,880
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3202
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:41,160
Okay.

3203
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:45,400
Okay.

3204
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:45,540
Okay.

3205
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:53,620
Paying my rent to the smelly ghost maid.

3206
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:55,620
Thank you.

3207
02:31:57,920 --> 02:31:59,340
I don't understand how this works.

3208
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,180
Like, first instance, the 19 at the bottom.

3209
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:02,780
Why couldn't that have been at the far right?

3210
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:05,620
Good question, CS Dragon.

3211
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:08,420
So, it's always going to be...

3212
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:09,620
In this...

3213
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,720
Order that you see.

3214
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:12,620
So it's going to be 11...

3215
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:13,940
And then...

3216
02:32:13,940 --> 02:32:14,880
Followed by 1.

3217
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:15,820
Followed by 1.

3218
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:16,860
Followed by 2.

3219
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:17,800
Followed by 2.

3220
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:18,620
Followed by 1.

3221
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:19,160
Followed by 1.

3222
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:19,680
Followed by 1.

3223
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:21,600
So because the 19 is on the far left...

3224
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:23,800
It had to be somewhere...

3225
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:25,640
In the first...

3226
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:27,620
As the first part of the...

3227
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:29,780
Of the sequence.

3228
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,160
Hmm.

3229
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:32,660
Essentially.

3230
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3231
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,480
And there's always one...

3232
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:39,200
Minimum...

3233
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:40,440
One space between each number.

3234
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:40,900
Exactly.

3235
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:42,500
So that's why...

3236
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:43,620
For like...

3237
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:45,180
We have 19 here.

3238
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:47,740
That's why we can immediately put a little space...

3239
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:48,740
Next to it.

3240
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:49,840
Because...

3241
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,060
We know that there will...

3242
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:51,940
100%.

3243
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:53,160
Be a space.

3244
02:32:56,900 --> 02:32:57,960
Yes, yes, yes.

3245
02:32:58,300 --> 02:32:59,440
Yes, yes, yes.

3246
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:00,520
Yes, yes.

3247
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:00,620
Yes.

3248
02:33:17,110 --> 02:33:18,670
This one is so hard.

3249
02:33:19,730 --> 02:33:20,430
They're like...

3250
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:21,370
This one's lit up.

3251
02:33:21,470 --> 02:33:21,990
But I'm like...

3252
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:22,290
How?

3253
02:33:24,810 --> 02:33:25,410
Maybe...

3254
02:33:29,050 --> 02:33:29,650
Maybe...

3255
02:33:29,650 --> 02:33:29,690
Maybe...

3256
02:33:29,690 --> 02:33:31,190
Maybe because it has to be 10 here.

3257
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:31,550
Oh.

3258
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:33,210
That was exactly it.

3259
02:33:34,730 --> 02:33:36,990
That was exactly it.

3260
02:33:37,490 --> 02:33:37,770
Okay.

3261
02:33:37,770 --> 02:33:39,370
We're running out of blue...

3262
02:33:39,370 --> 02:33:41,550
We're running out of blue...

3263
02:33:42,370 --> 02:33:43,810
Rows and columns here.

3264
02:33:44,830 --> 02:33:44,990
Okay.

3265
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:47,770
Okay.

3266
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:50,950
I'm just gonna start doing...

3267
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:51,310
You know what?

3268
02:33:51,410 --> 02:33:51,910
I said...

3269
02:33:51,910 --> 02:33:54,030
I don't know when I'm ever gonna use the...

3270
02:33:55,610 --> 02:33:57,090
The little middle click.

3271
02:33:57,690 --> 02:33:58,470
Here I go.

3272
02:33:59,130 --> 02:33:59,430
Okay.

3273
02:33:59,470 --> 02:34:00,190
So now...

3274
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:01,150
We're doing it like this.

3275
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:02,870
Actually...

3276
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:03,790
No, I'm not even gonna put those.

3277
02:34:03,810 --> 02:34:04,430
I'm just gonna pretend.

3278
02:34:04,430 --> 02:34:04,910
All right.

3279
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:05,510
2.

3280
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:06,610
1.

3281
02:34:11,670 --> 02:34:12,790
Let's just...

3282
02:34:13,630 --> 02:34:14,550
That's temporary.

3283
02:34:15,870 --> 02:34:16,430
Oh, wait.

3284
02:34:16,590 --> 02:34:16,690
No.

3285
02:34:17,810 --> 02:34:20,870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3286
02:34:22,130 --> 02:34:22,690
2.

3287
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:25,750
Oh, wait.

3288
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:26,590
I just realized.

3289
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:42,220
I think it definitely has to do with something with the 7.

3290
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:43,080
So...

3291
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:43,760
Oh.

3292
02:34:47,630 --> 02:34:48,090
Oh.

3293
02:34:48,630 --> 02:34:49,090
So...

3294
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:49,190
1.

3295
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:50,570
Space.

3296
02:34:51,330 --> 02:34:51,690
I don't know.

3297
02:34:52,010 --> 02:34:52,170
Nope.

3298
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:53,610
2.

3299
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:54,290
Space.

3300
02:34:55,530 --> 02:34:58,230
I should have marked where the 7 was before, but that's okay.

3301
02:35:00,470 --> 02:35:03,290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3302
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:03,710
Okay.

3303
02:35:04,170 --> 02:35:06,330
We were pretending this was the 1.

3304
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:09,790
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3305
02:35:10,790 --> 02:35:12,210
I think it has to be like that.

3306
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:20,900
Pretty sure the blue means you can deduct where the squares go without needing to guess.

3307
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:21,360
Yes.

3308
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:22,980
It does.

3309
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:27,080
In theory, I guess.

3310
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:28,540
This one...

3311
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:29,460
I'm like, how?

3312
02:35:30,180 --> 02:35:30,700
Unless...

3313
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:31,260
Okay, let's see.

3314
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:32,880
1...

3315
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:33,880
1...

3316
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:34,120
Wait.

3317
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:34,580
Alright, here.

3318
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:34,920
We'll do it.

3319
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:35,160
Opposite.

3320
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:35,900
1...

3321
02:35:35,900 --> 02:35:36,240
Space.

3322
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:37,380
1...

3323
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:38,060
Space.

3324
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:38,940
1...

3325
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:38,980
Space.

3326
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:42,080
1...

3327
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:43,480
Space.

3328
02:35:57,920 --> 02:35:58,400
1...

3329
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:00,680
2...

3330
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:04,840
Holy cow.

3331
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:08,360
Worse.

3332
02:36:12,390 --> 02:36:13,330
Holy cow.

3333
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:22,490
Imagine this 40 by 30 is your first no-no-gram ever.

3334
02:36:22,730 --> 02:36:23,850
I think it'd be impossible, though.

3335
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:30,750
I think you would...

3336
02:36:30,750 --> 02:36:31,530
You would not.

3337
02:36:32,910 --> 02:36:34,270
I don't think you could.

3338
02:36:36,390 --> 02:36:38,350
But then again, never say never.

3339
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:39,310
Oh.

3340
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:39,770
Wait.

3341
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:40,810
That's not what I meant to do.

3342
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:41,050
See.

3343
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:44,790
Oh.

3344
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:47,510
Oh.

3345
02:36:48,350 --> 02:36:48,730
Gosh.

3346
02:36:48,950 --> 02:36:49,370
Oh, golly.

3347
02:36:49,570 --> 02:36:49,690
Okay.

3348
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:54,050
This...

3349
02:36:54,050 --> 02:36:55,610
This row confuses me.

3350
02:36:59,310 --> 02:37:01,610
What do you know that I don't know?

3351
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,740
What do you know that I don't know?

3352
02:37:21,950 --> 02:37:23,690
This one took me two hours.

3353
02:37:25,290 --> 02:37:26,810
It might take us a while.

3354
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:31,390
Me saying my throat is starting to feel strained.

3355
02:37:31,490 --> 02:37:33,830
But actually, I got more tea and it's starting to feel a lot better.

3356
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:39,030
How much more difficult did they get?

3357
02:37:39,590 --> 02:37:40,750
Ah, this is...

3358
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:43,130
This is...

3359
02:37:43,130 --> 02:37:46,130
A 5 out of 5 stars difficulty, so...

3360
02:37:47,490 --> 02:37:50,290
I think this is as difficult as it gets.

3361
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:52,590
Alright, let's see.

3362
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:54,050
If I do 3...

3363
02:37:55,430 --> 02:37:55,990
Space.

3364
02:37:56,570 --> 02:37:59,390
1, 2, 3, 4, space.

3365
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:02,050
1, 2, 3, 4...

3366
02:38:02,990 --> 02:38:04,190
No, I didn't...

3367
02:38:04,190 --> 02:38:04,670
I didn't...

3368
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:05,190
I didn't...

3369
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:05,510
I don't know.

3370
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:06,050
That was an accent.

3371
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:07,810
Space.

3372
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:09,770
1, 2, 3.

3373
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:11,090
Space.

3374
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:13,250
1, 2, 3.

3375
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:16,230
And then...

3376
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:16,990
Just one there.

3377
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:17,570
Right?

3378
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:18,550
Okay.

3379
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:19,910
So now we work backwards.

3380
02:38:21,390 --> 02:38:21,730
1.

3381
02:38:22,110 --> 02:38:22,730
Space.

3382
02:38:23,150 --> 02:38:24,290
1, 2, 3.

3383
02:38:24,570 --> 02:38:25,130
Space.

3384
02:38:25,530 --> 02:38:26,810
1, 2, 3.

3385
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,790
Space.

3386
02:38:28,290 --> 02:38:29,750
1, 2, 3.

3387
02:38:30,110 --> 02:38:31,090
1, 2, 3.

3388
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:33,910
Space.

3389
02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:34,830
Wai.

3390
02:38:35,830 --> 02:38:36,470
One.

3391
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:38,530
1, 2, 3, space.

3392
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:40,170
1, 2, 3, space.

3393
02:38:40,570 --> 02:38:42,670
1, 2, 3, 4.

3394
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:48,870
Oh, does that mean this one could be?

3395
02:38:59,470 --> 02:39:00,110
Space.

3396
02:39:00,110 --> 02:39:00,330
Space.

3397
02:39:00,410 --> 02:39:02,290
One, two, three, four.

3398
02:39:03,270 --> 02:39:03,830
Space.

3399
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:05,890
One, two, three.

3400
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:19,060
Sensei Makana.

3401
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:26,600
Makana.

3402
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:33,600
I've played Pokemon Picross.

3403
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:36,560
Oh yeah, I've played that one too, except...

3404
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:41,020
Oh, you can't technically play it in... or... you can't play it anymore, right?

3405
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:45,440
Nah.

3406
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:48,080
Sad.

3407
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:50,260
I

3408
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:57,890
have it on the 3DS, yeah, yeah.

3409
02:39:58,090 --> 02:39:58,770
You can't get it...

3410
02:39:58,770 --> 02:40:00,690
Yeah, you can't download it anymore, yeah.

3411
02:40:01,410 --> 02:40:01,930
Yeah.

3412
02:40:02,470 --> 02:40:03,910
Oh yeah, there's hints!

3413
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:05,550
Wait, what's the hints?

3414
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:06,230
What's this do?

3415
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:11,480
Wait, what did I just do?

3416
02:40:11,820 --> 02:40:12,740
What does this do?

3417
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:18,000
Oh, it turns off the... these.

3418
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:19,640
Oh, no, no, no.

3419
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:21,480
Wait, what if I do this?

3420
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:26,100
Will you tip?

3421
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:36,690
Go back to game.

3422
02:40:39,490 --> 02:40:42,910
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3423
02:40:42,910 --> 02:40:44,550
Check mistakes.

3424
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:51,430
We're too good, baby.

3425
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:52,270
We're too good.

3426
02:40:52,810 --> 02:40:53,950
Oh, no.

3427
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:54,550
Nope.

3428
02:40:54,550 --> 02:40:56,190
Now I'll make a mistake.

3429
02:41:14,350 --> 02:41:15,990
Okay, so it can't be that.

3430
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:19,850
So this has to be part of the four.

3431
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:24,930
This has to be part of four.

3432
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:25,470
Space.

3433
02:41:25,890 --> 02:41:27,190
One, two, three, four.

3434
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:27,910
Space.

3435
02:41:28,910 --> 02:41:30,390
One, two, three.

3436
02:41:30,610 --> 02:41:31,370
Like that.

3437
02:41:32,610 --> 02:41:33,890
It has to be like that.

3438
02:41:35,230 --> 02:41:36,910
So three... somehow.

3439
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:37,650
Space.

3440
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:39,090
One, two, three, four...

3441
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:40,490
Wait, so then, one, two, three, space.

3442
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:42,510
One, two, three, four.

3443
02:41:43,090 --> 02:41:44,910
I got it.

3444
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:51,820
And then we can get rid of all this area.

3445
02:41:52,180 --> 02:41:53,680
And we can get rid of all this area.

3446
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:58,580
Which clears up this, this, this, this, this, this.

3447
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:00,940
We can actually get rid of...

3448
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:03,760
All this area.

3449
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:06,200
Because then I want...

3450
02:42:06,200 --> 02:42:07,140
Oh wait, can we?

3451
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,120
We're... 14.

3452
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:09,260
14.

3453
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,360
Oh wait, I don't think so.

3454
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:13,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3455
02:42:14,380 --> 02:42:16,000
Yeah, this is exactly.

3456
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:17,700
Sit down.

3457
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:19,160
Three, four, five, six.

3458
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:20,840
No, no, no.

3459
02:42:21,060 --> 02:42:22,500
Okay, now we can do that.

3460
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:23,360
One, two, three.

3461
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:24,140
Four, five, six.

3462
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:26,280
Okay, very good, very good.

3463
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:26,900
Over there.

3464
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:27,560
Four, six.

3465
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:29,360
Seven.

3466
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:30,920
One, two, three.

3467
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:32,400
Four, five, six, seven.

3468
02:42:34,400 --> 02:42:34,720
Okay.

3469
02:42:36,520 --> 02:42:36,920
Okay.

3470
02:42:37,860 --> 02:42:38,260
Okay.

3471
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:41,740
Okay.

3472
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:44,760
Oh.

3473
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:45,500
No.

3474
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:46,120
There we go.

3475
02:42:48,830 --> 02:42:51,090
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

3476
02:43:02,360 --> 02:43:02,960
Oh.

3477
02:43:04,380 --> 02:43:04,660
Um.

3478
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:04,900
The...

3479
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:06,760
We are good.

3480
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:06,980
One, two,

3481
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:12,160
three.

3482
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:19,880
Um, um.

3483
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:22,360
Um.

3484
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:25,500
Um, um...

3485
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:25,960
Um...

3486
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:26,700
Um, um...

3487
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:27,000
Um, um.

3488
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:28,540
Oh.

3489
02:43:28,720 --> 02:43:29,720
Oh, oh!

3490
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:29,980
Um,

3491
02:43:36,750 --> 02:43:36,950
um, um...

3492
02:43:36,950 --> 02:43:37,130
Um.

3493
02:43:37,130 --> 02:43:39,370
Um, um, um.

3494
02:43:39,370 --> 02:43:39,870
Oops.

3495
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:01,150
Okay.

3496
02:44:06,710 --> 02:44:08,790
Craziness right now.

3497
02:44:09,970 --> 02:44:11,590
Absolute craziness.

3498
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:16,520
There we go.

3499
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:42,500
Well, we don't know exactly if this is connected or not, so...

3500
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:46,140
I don't want to put it because one space...

3501
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:50,260
This is eight, but this could also be the eight, you know?

3502
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:54,620
One... Let's see.

3503
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,120
We can do this area too.

3504
02:44:56,480 --> 02:44:57,700
Oh, I don't want to...

3505
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:58,640
That down there?

3506
02:44:58,980 --> 02:44:59,720
There's more?

3507
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:00,400
We could do it?

3508
02:45:00,660 --> 02:45:00,980
Really?

3509
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:02,280
I don't believe you.

3510
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:04,160
I don't believe you.

3511
02:45:04,660 --> 02:45:05,700
Don't lie to me.

3512
02:45:19,220 --> 02:45:20,200
No guarantee.

3513
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:23,800
I get it.

3514
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:24,660
I don't get it.

3515
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:26,980
If...

3516
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:30,760
If...

3517
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:32,160
I don't know.

3518
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:33,720
I already explained it.

3519
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:35,260
I would explain it again.

3520
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:38,260
I already explained it at the beginning of the stream.

3521
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:39,380
Sorry.

3522
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:43,600
I already... Oh.

3523
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:24,120
I'm allowed to help the column 18116.

3524
02:46:24,220 --> 02:46:24,820
You know the eight.

3525
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:28,980
Oh, you're right.

3526
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:31,440
It has to be this, right?

3527
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:32,780
Yeah, you're right.

3528
02:46:33,800 --> 02:46:34,820
Because this is two.

3529
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:36,040
Obviously, it can't be one-one.

3530
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:36,860
Thank you.

3531
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:39,360
Thank you, thank you.

3532
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:43,120
Appreciate it.

3533
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:49,960
Oh, well, I've...

3534
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:52,060
Let's see.

3535
02:46:55,820 --> 02:46:56,720
This one, too.

3536
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:58,400
What else can we do here?

3537
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:00,940
There's still so much room.

3538
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:03,920
This one makes sense because there's like a ten and eleven.

3539
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:04,860
Let's see.

3540
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:05,840
All right, one.

3541
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:07,440
One.

3542
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:08,360
Spice.

3543
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:14,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

3544
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:17,240
One.

3545
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:18,200
Space.

3546
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:22,520
Oh, my God.

3547
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:25,700
I have a gnat in my room.

3548
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:29,080
Get out of my face.

3549
02:47:33,370 --> 02:47:34,950
I think it's just one square.

3550
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:35,590
Yep.

3551
02:47:36,670 --> 02:47:37,870
It's just a one square.

3552
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:43,570
I don't think it's Starry Night.

3553
02:47:43,710 --> 02:47:44,950
Somehow you guys were saying that.

3554
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:45,810
I don't think so.

3555
02:47:46,770 --> 02:47:48,270
I really can't tell at all.

3556
02:47:51,690 --> 02:47:53,530
I can't tell at all what it would be.

3557
02:47:54,170 --> 02:47:58,490
I hope you're having a super peak cross day, me too.

3558
02:47:58,950 --> 02:48:00,270
Thank you when I can.

3559
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:02,910
Thank you.

3560
02:48:04,550 --> 02:48:04,910
How?

3561
02:48:06,690 --> 02:48:07,050
How?

3562
02:48:07,470 --> 02:48:09,030
Okay, we're gonna have to get rid of these for now.

3563
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:18,180
I don't know what they want me to do here.

3564
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:21,280
What do you see that I don't see?

3565
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:22,280
Okay, five.

3566
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:23,000
Space.

3567
02:48:23,560 --> 02:48:27,320
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

3568
02:48:28,340 --> 02:48:28,700
Space.

3569
02:48:30,420 --> 02:48:30,780
One.

3570
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:32,440
Wait, no, space.

3571
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:33,580
One, space.

3572
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:34,900
One, two, three.

3573
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:36,640
Okay, so now we do one, two, three.

3574
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:37,460
Space.

3575
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:38,740
One.

3576
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:39,440
Space.

3577
02:48:41,420 --> 02:48:45,680
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

3578
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:48,100
Space.

3579
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:50,840
Yeah, we can't do anything with the five.

3580
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:52,760
Oh.

3581
02:48:55,500 --> 02:48:55,940
Okay.

3582
02:49:07,400 --> 02:49:10,600
I like how I'm like, usually when you place a new thing.

3583
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:15,720
Like, you know, I got rid of the blue on here.

3584
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:17,920
It would usually light up the blue here, but no.

3585
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:22,420
It says, I'm...

3586
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:23,560
No help for you.

3587
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:29,360
But look at all the progress we've made in only 30 minutes.

3588
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:32,400
Oh my gosh.

3589
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:33,800
Oh.

3590
02:49:34,240 --> 02:49:36,200
We're really putting the brain to work today, huh?

3591
02:49:44,230 --> 02:49:44,590
Space.

3592
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:47,670
Space.

3593
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:52,740
Okay, so.

3594
02:49:58,280 --> 02:49:59,080
Two, three.

3595
02:50:00,220 --> 02:50:00,740
One.

3596
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:03,300
One, two, three.

3597
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:06,020
One, two, three, four.

3598
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:09,100
One, two, three, four.

3599
02:50:09,380 --> 02:50:10,460
Five, six, seven.

3600
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:16,020
Look, it's even...

3601
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:18,280
Okay, yeah.

3602
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:19,900
Oh, wait.

3603
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:20,580
That's wrong.

3604
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:21,720
There we go.

3605
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,360
Like that.

3606
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:36,680
Okay, let's try...

3607
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,120
Let's try this one.

3608
02:50:39,880 --> 02:50:40,860
Because it's a big number.

3609
02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:41,740
One.

3610
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:42,640
Oh, wait.

3611
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:42,920
Wait.

3612
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:44,000
Didn't I do this one already?

3613
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:45,780
One, two, three.

3614
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:51,480
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

3615
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:53,120
Oh, I didn't do that one.

3616
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:09,500
Come on.

3617
02:51:11,360 --> 02:51:12,760
So, I think...

3618
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:13,060
Let's see.

3619
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:15,100
If I do eight here...

3620
02:51:16,140 --> 02:51:18,040
We wouldn't be able to fill in the rest.

3621
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:21,040
So, the two, two, one, one...

3622
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:24,500
Are most likely...

3623
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:24,900
Yeah, okay.

3624
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:25,820
So...

3625
02:51:25,820 --> 02:51:26,940
What's eleven?

3626
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:29,080
Uh...

3627
02:51:33,490 --> 02:51:34,370
Four, five...

3628
02:51:35,710 --> 02:51:36,150
Yeah.

3629
02:51:36,370 --> 02:51:36,870
Okay, like that.

3630
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:39,970
Like that.

3631
02:51:40,310 --> 02:51:40,850
Like that.

3632
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:42,230
Like...

3633
02:51:42,230 --> 02:51:43,310
Like that.

3634
02:51:43,470 --> 02:51:44,470
Oh, I was right.

3635
02:51:45,110 --> 02:51:46,150
And like that.

3636
02:51:51,780 --> 02:51:52,220
Two.

3637
02:51:54,680 --> 02:51:55,340
Like that.

3638
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:00,160
Okay.

3639
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:02,220
My brain cells are dying.

3640
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:02,680
Don't worry.

3641
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,960
One, two, three, four, five, six...

3642
02:52:05,960 --> 02:52:06,300
Oh, okay.

3643
02:52:06,360 --> 02:52:06,620
Never mind.

3644
02:52:06,860 --> 02:52:07,240
Just kidding.

3645
02:52:17,550 --> 02:52:19,370
I don't know what else they want me to do here.

3646
02:52:24,290 --> 02:52:26,910
If it's Picasso, then there's no guessing it.

3647
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:27,630
Oh my gosh.

3648
02:52:27,730 --> 02:52:28,090
Wait.

3649
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:30,270
If this is like the nose...

3650
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:32,670
And this is like an awkward eyeball...

3651
02:52:32,670 --> 02:52:34,250
Or this is a nose...

3652
02:52:34,250 --> 02:52:34,750
Oh gosh.

3653
02:52:34,870 --> 02:52:35,670
It could be Picasso.

3654
02:52:36,230 --> 02:52:36,810
Oh my gosh.

3655
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:42,090
It could be...

3656
02:52:42,090 --> 02:52:43,750
It could be Picasso.

3657
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:47,610
Oh wait.

3658
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:48,350
One...

3659
02:52:48,350 --> 02:52:49,270
Two, three, four.

3660
02:52:49,470 --> 02:52:50,370
One, two, three, four.

3661
02:52:53,330 --> 02:52:53,850
Space.

3662
02:52:54,810 --> 02:52:56,230
One, two, three.

3663
02:52:57,090 --> 02:52:57,610
Space.

3664
02:52:58,570 --> 02:53:00,230
One, two, three, four.

3665
02:53:00,590 --> 02:53:00,690
Space.

3666
02:53:01,190 --> 02:53:01,290
Ah.

3667
02:53:01,910 --> 02:53:02,330
Okay.

3668
02:53:04,290 --> 02:53:06,170
I don't know what they want me to do in this one.

3669
02:53:06,790 --> 02:53:07,730
In this row.

3670
02:53:31,530 --> 02:53:32,030
Space.

3671
02:53:33,570 --> 02:53:34,110
Yep.

3672
02:53:36,550 --> 02:53:37,570
This one too.

3673
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:38,730
I'm so confused.

3674
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:40,070
Seven.

3675
02:53:41,350 --> 02:53:41,890
One.

3676
02:53:42,890 --> 02:53:43,430
One.

3677
02:53:43,950 --> 02:53:44,490
One.

3678
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:48,450
One, two, three, four, five.

3679
02:53:48,450 --> 02:53:48,750
Oh.

3680
02:53:49,570 --> 02:53:50,130
Wait.

3681
02:53:50,290 --> 02:53:50,950
There's still more?

3682
02:53:57,900 --> 02:53:58,740
Oh maybe.

3683
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:00,160
One, two.

3684
02:54:01,340 --> 02:54:01,860
No?

3685
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:04,260
Then like that.

3686
02:54:04,700 --> 02:54:04,820
Wait.

3687
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:06,160
Oh.

3688
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:06,980
Maybe like this.

3689
02:54:08,580 --> 02:54:13,940
I have no idea what they want me to do here.

3690
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:14,800
One.

3691
02:54:15,620 --> 02:54:16,180
Two.

3692
02:54:16,420 --> 02:54:16,680
Oh.

3693
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:17,560
Just like that.

3694
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:18,340
I'm silly.

3695
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:23,800
I'm silly.

3696
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:24,920
There we go.

3697
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:26,760
Oh yeah.

3698
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:27,740
Okay.

3699
02:54:28,180 --> 02:54:28,300
Woo.

3700
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:29,820
Okay.

3701
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:30,660
Let's, let's.

3702
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:33,280
Let's move away from this one for a bit.

3703
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:34,880
It's confusing, right?

3704
02:54:36,580 --> 02:54:38,080
It's confusing me.

3705
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:40,900
X here.

3706
02:54:46,670 --> 02:54:47,050
Okay.

3707
02:54:47,150 --> 02:54:47,530
So three.

3708
02:54:50,390 --> 02:54:50,930
Space.

3709
02:54:51,210 --> 02:54:52,170
One, two, three.

3710
02:54:52,270 --> 02:54:52,430
Wait.

3711
02:54:52,670 --> 02:54:53,430
I have a counter.

3712
02:54:54,390 --> 02:54:54,930
Eight.

3713
02:54:55,310 --> 02:54:55,430
Here.

3714
02:54:55,650 --> 02:54:55,930
Okay.

3715
02:54:55,930 --> 02:54:57,330
So now if we do one.

3716
02:54:57,770 --> 02:54:58,690
One, two, three.

3717
02:54:59,610 --> 02:54:59,950
One.

3718
02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:02,110
Five.

3719
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:02,970
Six.

3720
02:55:03,150 --> 02:55:03,370
Seven.

3721
02:55:03,670 --> 02:55:03,870
Eight.

3722
02:55:06,190 --> 02:55:09,820
What did it?

3723
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:10,640
Huge.

3724
02:55:11,220 --> 02:55:11,660
Huge.

3725
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:12,100
Oh wait.

3726
02:55:12,280 --> 02:55:12,800
I'm wrong.

3727
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:13,440
Sorry.

3728
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:15,280
I thought, I thought three was the last one.

3729
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:16,880
So I was like, oh, it can't be three.

3730
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:18,400
Okay.

3731
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:19,440
Huge.

3732
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:20,340
Huge.

3733
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:20,920
Cause real.

3734
02:55:28,060 --> 02:55:29,500
So let's just say three.

3735
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:30,640
Boom.

3736
02:55:31,240 --> 02:55:31,340
Space.

3737
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:33,920
Nine, ten.

3738
02:55:37,640 --> 02:55:38,860
That's what I just added, right?

3739
02:55:40,480 --> 02:55:41,520
Three, four, five.

3740
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,040
Six, seven, eight.

3741
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:46,080
Nine, ten.

3742
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:51,900
Come on.

3743
02:55:52,340 --> 02:55:55,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

3744
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:56,260
Nine.

3745
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:56,960
Okay.

3746
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:08,340
12th column.

3747
02:56:08,640 --> 02:56:09,000
Oh gosh.

3748
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:10,220
I can't count the columns.

3749
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:12,340
That's too many columns.

3750
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:16,420
There's too many.

3751
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:21,060
I can't keep track of those numbers too.

3752
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:26,920
One.

3753
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:28,120
Space.

3754
02:56:43,330 --> 02:56:46,950
I feel like a deflating balloon right now.

3755
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:56,060
I feel like a deflating balloon.

3756
02:57:06,750 --> 02:57:08,030
Oh wait, here.

3757
02:57:09,310 --> 02:57:10,190
And then here.

3758
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:11,010
Oh my gosh.

3759
02:57:11,470 --> 02:57:11,810
Big.

3760
02:57:11,950 --> 02:57:12,950
Big, big, big.

3761
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:13,430
Big development.

3762
02:57:15,270 --> 02:57:15,790
One.

3763
02:57:17,230 --> 02:57:17,750
Two.

3764
02:57:18,130 --> 02:57:18,650
Space.

3765
02:57:20,150 --> 02:57:21,710
One, two, three, space.

3766
02:57:22,410 --> 02:57:23,790
One, two, space.

3767
02:57:24,770 --> 02:57:27,310
One, two, three, four, five.

3768
02:57:27,530 --> 02:57:27,850
I don't know.

3769
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:36,580
One, one.

3770
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:38,700
Four.

3771
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:41,640
Okay.

3772
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:46,000
Big developments are happening.

3773
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:48,040
11.

3774
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:51,260
Yes.

3775
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:54,780
Three.

3776
02:57:55,980 --> 02:57:58,340
Nine, ten, eleven.

3777
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:01,360
Yes.

3778
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:03,440
Yes.

3779
02:58:03,800 --> 02:58:06,500
Okay, so here.

3780
02:58:07,260 --> 02:58:11,300
One space... Okay.

3781
02:58:13,180 --> 02:58:13,740
Yes.

3782
02:58:17,610 --> 02:58:19,550
Gosh, slowly but surely.

3783
02:58:23,770 --> 02:58:26,150
Slowly but surely.

3784
02:58:26,870 --> 02:58:28,250
We're making it out.

3785
02:58:28,430 --> 02:58:29,810
Let's see if... Okay.

3786
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:35,190
Let's say this is two... One...

3787
02:58:37,290 --> 02:58:45,230
I know that I have to just figure out... Where the two needs to go and figure out... Okay.

3788
02:58:45,610 --> 02:58:46,230
Hold on.

3789
02:58:47,450 --> 02:58:48,730
So two space.

3790
02:58:49,330 --> 02:58:49,890
One, two, three.

3791
02:58:49,970 --> 02:58:50,750
See, it can't be the hot.

3792
02:58:52,610 --> 02:58:54,870
Can I give a super vague hint about painting?

3793
02:58:55,550 --> 02:58:56,690
About this painting?

3794
02:58:57,490 --> 02:58:58,410
Or... Because no.

3795
02:58:58,650 --> 02:58:59,670
I don't want a hint about it.

3796
02:59:03,980 --> 02:59:04,600
Oh, wait.

3797
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:06,060
This is big.

3798
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:07,020
We can get rid of all this.

3799
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:07,580
Oh,

3800
02:59:27,910 --> 02:59:28,470
my...

3801
02:59:28,470 --> 02:59:28,790
Yeah.

3802
02:59:28,970 --> 02:59:29,710
Thanks for asking.

3803
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:32,470
If you... If you could send it or not.

3804
02:59:33,390 --> 02:59:33,830
Thank you.

3805
02:59:34,270 --> 02:59:35,870
Or... But thank you also for the super chat.

3806
02:59:35,990 --> 02:59:36,770
Thank you so much.

3807
02:59:48,500 --> 02:59:48,940
Yes.

3808
02:59:54,580 --> 02:59:55,020
Sorry.

3809
02:59:55,140 --> 02:59:56,420
My brain is so focused.

3810
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:58,360
I'm so focused right now.

3811
03:00:00,140 --> 03:00:03,060
11... 12... 13... 14... 15...

3812
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:32,080
15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 15... 16... 16... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 17... 18... 17... 17... 18... 17... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 18... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 19...

3813
03:00:39,980 --> 03:00:42,340
19 Well, maybe it could.

3814
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:45,520
Oh, yeah, because it could be two, one, two, two.

3815
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:53,620
Oh, wait, but there's this... Wait, wait.

3816
03:00:57,540 --> 03:00:59,460
Two, say that's the first two.

3817
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:00,860
Two.

3818
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:02,720
Ah, I don't know.

3819
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:06,440
Clicky sound is so nice.

3820
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:09,940
Can't keep my eyes on it for too long.

3821
03:01:10,040 --> 03:01:11,080
I gotta blink more.

3822
03:01:11,280 --> 03:01:12,380
My eyes are gonna dry.

3823
03:01:12,540 --> 03:01:14,940
Yeah, my ectoplasm is gonna be non-existent.

3824
03:01:18,570 --> 03:01:19,930
Oh, wait.

3825
03:01:20,210 --> 03:01:21,010
No, never mind.

3826
03:01:21,150 --> 03:01:21,530
I lied.

3827
03:01:23,330 --> 03:01:23,910
Ah...

3828
03:01:25,710 --> 03:01:28,110
Okay, the fatigue is starting to set in.

3829
03:01:30,670 --> 03:01:32,870
The fatigue is gonna... Wait.

3830
03:01:35,290 --> 03:01:35,870
Three.

3831
03:01:36,370 --> 03:01:36,850
Four.

3832
03:01:37,270 --> 03:01:37,790
Yes.

3833
03:01:56,780 --> 03:01:59,640
I won't reveal it's snake eating a...

3834
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:02,580
A snake burger.

3835
03:02:04,260 --> 03:02:05,320
Oh, man.

3836
03:02:05,540 --> 03:02:06,960
That's what I thought it was.

3837
03:02:08,100 --> 03:02:10,660
Dang it, why didn't you just let me...

3838
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:12,420
Get it.

3839
03:02:14,320 --> 03:02:17,140
I did choose a big one, and so I did... I wanna...

3840
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:17,980
But, like, okay.

3841
03:02:18,320 --> 03:02:19,960
I can't not end on...

3842
03:02:21,260 --> 03:02:24,800
One of size that I've never done before, you know?

3843
03:02:25,500 --> 03:02:27,640
Like, that's just so exciting, no?

3844
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:28,280
Oh...

3845
03:02:32,250 --> 03:02:33,850
Thirteen and fourteen of the time.

3846
03:02:37,870 --> 03:02:39,390
It's so exciting.

3847
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:41,670
That's right.

3848
03:02:48,030 --> 03:02:50,310
To try a new P-cross.

3849
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:57,110
Oh my gosh.

3850
03:02:57,350 --> 03:02:58,610
I can't tell at all what it is.

3851
03:03:00,350 --> 03:03:01,290
I don't know.

3852
03:03:01,450 --> 03:03:02,930
What if it's one that we don't know?

3853
03:03:03,250 --> 03:03:04,210
That would suck.

3854
03:03:06,550 --> 03:03:08,170
That would be no fun.

3855
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:17,520
Wait.

3856
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:18,220
Oh yeah.

3857
03:03:19,940 --> 03:03:21,280
It looks like a man.

3858
03:03:23,140 --> 03:03:24,320
With a hat on.

3859
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:26,460
It looks like someone with a hat.

3860
03:03:27,060 --> 03:03:27,980
I think.

3861
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:29,320
I think.

3862
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:32,600
I think, I think, I think.

3863
03:03:34,300 --> 03:03:35,740
VOD Watchers...

3864
03:03:36,140 --> 03:03:36,800
Don't skip.

3865
03:03:37,960 --> 03:03:39,320
VOD Watchers...

3866
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:40,500
Don't even blink.

3867
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:42,780
It'll be over before you know it.

3868
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:48,680
VOD Watchers...

3869
03:03:51,340 --> 03:03:53,360
Still feels like Starry Night?

3870
03:03:53,820 --> 03:03:54,420
Where?

3871
03:03:54,420 --> 03:03:56,260
I don't think so.

3872
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:20,960
Okay.

3873
03:04:25,060 --> 03:04:26,580
Watching at five times speed.

3874
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:30,980
Is what the VGM sounds like.

3875
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:36,120
I still don't also understand what they want me to do here.

3876
03:04:36,120 --> 03:04:37,140
It's crazy.

3877
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:40,060
What do you want me to do here?

3878
03:04:41,020 --> 03:04:43,500
I can't tell if it's a two or a one.

3879
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,140
Stop acting like you know everything game.

3880
03:04:52,670 --> 03:04:54,590
Stop acting like you know...

3881
03:04:55,170 --> 03:04:56,090
Wait, this is five.

3882
03:04:56,250 --> 03:04:56,310
Yeah.

3883
03:04:56,310 --> 03:04:57,570
I don't know.

3884
03:04:58,010 --> 03:04:58,990
I don't know.

3885
03:05:00,390 --> 03:05:01,630
I don't know.

3886
03:05:01,850 --> 03:05:02,610
I don't know.

3887
03:05:02,610 --> 03:05:04,110
Four, five, six, seven.

3888
03:05:08,370 --> 03:05:09,890
Hi, VOD Watchers.

3889
03:05:10,750 --> 03:05:11,330
VOD Watchers...

3890
03:05:11,890 --> 03:05:15,090
Back 45 minutes...

3891
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:16,290
To the start of the puzzle.

3892
03:05:17,790 --> 03:05:19,310
46 minutes...

3893
03:05:19,310 --> 03:05:19,790
Actually.

3894
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:22,170
This is definitely a guy standing.

3895
03:05:22,490 --> 03:05:24,130
This is a standing man emoji.

3896
03:05:25,390 --> 03:05:26,550
It's gotta be.

3897
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:34,040
Okay.

3898
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:35,300
Two.

3899
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:46,860
There we go.

3900
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,240
Three, three, one.

3901
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:51,420
One, space.

3902
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:52,280
One, two, three.

3903
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:53,580
One, two, three.

3904
03:05:53,580 --> 03:05:54,640
One, two, three.

3905
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:55,540
Space.

3906
03:05:55,780 --> 03:05:56,480
One, two, three.

3907
03:05:57,440 --> 03:05:58,300
One, two, three.

3908
03:05:58,440 --> 03:05:58,720
Space.

3909
03:05:58,960 --> 03:05:59,360
One, two, three.

3910
03:05:59,460 --> 03:05:59,580
Okay.

3911
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,760
I'm gonna check if I have any mistakes so far, you guys.

3912
03:06:06,600 --> 03:06:07,220
Uh-oh.

3913
03:06:13,630 --> 03:06:14,730
Oh, I see it.

3914
03:06:19,810 --> 03:06:20,250
Wait.

3915
03:06:22,430 --> 03:06:23,410
Not that many.

3916
03:06:24,790 --> 03:06:25,670
Easy fixes.

3917
03:06:26,030 --> 03:06:26,710
I'd say.

3918
03:06:28,130 --> 03:06:28,930
I don't know.

3919
03:06:29,630 --> 03:06:30,970
I feel like that was cheating.

3920
03:06:33,370 --> 03:06:35,090
I feel like...

3921
03:06:35,090 --> 03:06:35,810
That was kind of cheating.

3922
03:06:36,130 --> 03:06:37,370
But this thing is so busy...

3923
03:06:37,370 --> 03:06:37,890
Not busy.

3924
03:06:38,090 --> 03:06:38,990
It is pretty busy.

3925
03:06:39,170 --> 03:06:40,210
This thing is so big...

3926
03:06:40,210 --> 03:06:40,890
That...

3927
03:06:40,890 --> 03:06:41,190
It's fine.

3928
03:06:41,590 --> 03:06:42,070
Probably.

3929
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:43,210
It's fine.

3930
03:06:44,810 --> 03:06:45,290
Probably.

3931
03:06:47,350 --> 03:06:48,870
It's fine to check.

3932
03:06:49,450 --> 03:06:50,930
Hold on, let me do my throat spray.

3933
03:06:58,120 --> 03:06:58,600
Nasty.

3934
03:06:58,600 --> 03:06:59,280
Okay.

3935
03:07:13,530 --> 03:07:15,010
But this part...

3936
03:07:15,010 --> 03:07:15,750
We're really getting...

3937
03:07:15,750 --> 03:07:17,030
We're really starting to fill it out.

3938
03:07:17,930 --> 03:07:20,330
I think we'll get it sooner rather than later.

3939
03:07:21,610 --> 03:07:22,690
Trust everybody, trust.

3940
03:07:25,190 --> 03:07:27,250
We're going at a pretty good pace, I'd say.

3941
03:07:37,990 --> 03:07:39,190
Trust the process.

3942
03:07:40,050 --> 03:07:40,890
One, space.

3943
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:48,680
Unless this is the wine...

3944
03:07:48,680 --> 03:07:48,820
Space.

3945
03:07:51,780 --> 03:07:52,520
I don't...

3946
03:07:52,520 --> 03:07:53,460
I don't trust myself...

3947
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:54,400
To...

3948
03:07:54,400 --> 03:07:55,560
To touch it right now.

3949
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:06,120
Okay.

3950
03:08:06,120 --> 03:08:07,480
One, two, three, four, five.

3951
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:09,400
Okay.

3952
03:08:12,120 --> 03:08:12,860
Oh, wait.

3953
03:08:13,040 --> 03:08:13,300
Just kidding.

3954
03:08:13,620 --> 03:08:14,800
We're good, we're good, we're good.

3955
03:08:19,250 --> 03:08:19,930
Okay.

3956
03:08:20,770 --> 03:08:21,150
Okay.

3957
03:08:22,070 --> 03:08:22,750
Okay.

3958
03:08:25,490 --> 03:08:26,170
Five...

3959
03:08:26,170 --> 03:08:26,550
Six.

3960
03:08:27,350 --> 03:08:27,890
Okay.

3961
03:08:28,130 --> 03:08:28,770
Okay, okay, okay.

3962
03:08:29,910 --> 03:08:31,930
I'm being careful about my choices.

3963
03:08:40,700 --> 03:08:43,200
Feels like a fatigue check than anything else.

3964
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:43,600
True.

3965
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:43,720
True.

3966
03:08:44,780 --> 03:08:46,960
I want to leave, but I can't have to...

3967
03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:47,920
What do you mean...

3968
03:08:51,870 --> 03:08:53,590
What do you mean you want to leave?

3969
03:09:00,880 --> 03:09:01,780
You want to leave.

3970
03:09:02,160 --> 03:09:03,120
I need to pee.

3971
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:04,080
Okay.

3972
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:05,200
Go...

3973
03:09:13,500 --> 03:09:14,380
Go pee.

3974
03:09:14,860 --> 03:09:16,480
It's not good to hold it in.

3975
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:23,640
Don't worry, I won't solve it in the time that you go potty.

3976
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:25,960
One, two, three, four, five.

3977
03:09:26,460 --> 03:09:26,960
Unless...

3978
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:27,900
What if I like...

3979
03:09:28,490 --> 03:09:30,300
What if I super lock in...

3980
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:30,320
I don't know.

3981
03:09:31,440 --> 03:09:32,640
Within that time...

3982
03:09:33,200 --> 03:09:34,340
Wouldn't that be so crazy?

3983
03:09:35,080 --> 03:09:37,060
You come back and it's completely solved.

3984
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:51,640
Okay, now that...

3985
03:09:51,640 --> 03:09:54,620
Now that he's gone, I'm gonna look up a guide.

3986
03:09:54,620 --> 03:09:56,900
I'm just gonna look up what the picture looks like.

3987
03:09:57,760 --> 03:09:58,980
What if I...

3988
03:09:58,980 --> 03:10:00,480
Look at this guy's face!

3989
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:05,380
I look up a guide and I fill it in really...

3990
03:10:05,380 --> 03:10:06,340
really fast.

3991
03:10:10,230 --> 03:10:11,650
And then I'm like, sorry.

3992
03:10:12,630 --> 03:10:13,570
Sorry, man.

3993
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:14,870
I finished it.

3994
03:10:19,150 --> 03:10:20,370
That's so mean.

3995
03:10:24,330 --> 03:10:25,210
Okay, hold on.

3996
03:10:25,250 --> 03:10:25,970
I'm losing track.

3997
03:10:26,170 --> 03:10:26,950
I'm losing focus.

3998
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:29,810
I'm losing focus.

3999
03:10:31,270 --> 03:10:31,410
Okay.

4000
03:10:33,890 --> 03:10:35,450
Oh my god, we solved...

4001
03:10:36,570 --> 03:10:37,630
We solved that.

4002
03:10:37,790 --> 03:10:38,930
We solved this column.

4003
03:10:39,690 --> 03:10:40,890
And this column.

4004
03:10:41,430 --> 03:10:42,750
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4005
03:10:42,890 --> 03:10:43,630
We solved two columns.

4006
03:10:44,410 --> 03:10:45,770
Huge, huge, huge, huge.

4007
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:54,400
Actually huge.

4008
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:56,800
Wait, you could see this guy so clearly.

4009
03:10:57,900 --> 03:10:59,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

4010
03:11:03,950 --> 03:11:07,870
It's mostly difficult trying to remember like...

4011
03:11:09,410 --> 03:11:10,370
How do I say?

4012
03:11:17,810 --> 03:11:19,890
Like keeping track of making sure...

4013
03:11:23,810 --> 03:11:24,330
Each...

4014
03:11:25,610 --> 03:11:26,130
piece...

4015
03:11:26,790 --> 03:11:27,830
I don't know how to describe it.

4016
03:11:28,290 --> 03:11:29,230
Like it's like...

4017
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:30,230
Oh, I put a four here.

4018
03:11:30,330 --> 03:11:31,010
Put a four here.

4019
03:11:31,130 --> 03:11:32,970
And not accidentally putting a four here too.

4020
03:11:33,150 --> 03:11:33,630
You know what I mean?

4021
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:34,630
That's...

4022
03:11:34,630 --> 03:11:37,510
That's what's so confusing for me.

4023
03:11:38,230 --> 03:11:39,490
It can be at least.

4024
03:11:39,730 --> 03:11:39,810
Okay.

4025
03:11:39,990 --> 03:11:40,830
Four, space.

4026
03:11:41,130 --> 03:11:41,730
One, two, three.

4027
03:11:43,270 --> 03:11:43,950
Oh, wow.

4028
03:11:44,950 --> 03:11:46,090
So this is four.

4029
03:11:46,790 --> 03:11:47,330
One, two, three.

4030
03:11:47,690 --> 03:11:47,890
Space.

4031
03:11:48,350 --> 03:11:49,670
One, two, three, four.

4032
03:11:50,370 --> 03:11:50,770
Okay.

4033
03:11:51,710 --> 03:11:53,350
We're almost done with half of it.

4034
03:11:55,070 --> 03:11:56,530
We're almost done with half.

4035
03:11:56,910 --> 03:11:57,730
Oh, my gosh.

4036
03:11:59,150 --> 03:12:02,230
I think I'm leveling up my Picross skills...

4037
03:12:02,230 --> 03:12:03,510
tenfold today.

4038
03:12:10,340 --> 03:12:13,020
That sounds like something exactly I'd screw up.

4039
03:12:13,140 --> 03:12:13,340
Right?

4040
03:12:13,580 --> 03:12:14,680
It'd be so easy to.

4041
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:16,680
It would be...

4042
03:12:20,220 --> 03:12:20,660
Okay.

4043
03:12:20,860 --> 03:12:21,080
Nevermind.

4044
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:22,160
See, there's another one.

4045
03:12:22,360 --> 03:12:22,920
See, like...

4046
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:24,280
What if I marked all this off?

4047
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:25,480
Like that.

4048
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:27,380
But I didn't notice that there was another one.

4049
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:29,380
It would screw everything up.

4050
03:12:30,860 --> 03:12:32,620
It's so easy to screw stuff up here.

4051
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:37,260
So, so easy.

4052
03:12:37,480 --> 03:12:38,480
So, so easy.

4053
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:40,880
Okay, so there's a two in here.

4054
03:12:41,580 --> 03:12:42,540
And then eight.

4055
03:12:43,620 --> 03:12:46,900
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

4056
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:47,740
Yep.

4057
03:12:48,280 --> 03:12:49,060
Just like that.

4058
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:53,280
I don't think it's American Gothic.

4059
03:12:53,920 --> 03:12:57,260
That's the one with the guy holding the pitchfork and the wife next to him, right?

4060
03:12:57,580 --> 03:12:59,260
Because I totally thought the same thing.

4061
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:03,460
I 100% thought that it might be that one.

4062
03:13:03,600 --> 03:13:04,740
But then I was like...

4063
03:13:04,740 --> 03:13:07,300
But I'm pretty sure that guy is not wearing a hat.

4064
03:13:07,500 --> 03:13:09,660
And he has like the glasses on and stuff.

4065
03:13:11,460 --> 03:13:11,980
Yeah...

4066
03:13:11,980 --> 03:13:13,960
Actually, it's his daughter?!

4067
03:13:15,580 --> 03:13:16,620
Sorry, it...

4068
03:13:18,820 --> 03:13:19,340
Not...

4069
03:13:19,340 --> 03:13:21,020
That's his daughter?!

4070
03:13:23,580 --> 03:13:25,060
The wife is on the left.

4071
03:13:25,300 --> 03:13:26,380
He's on the right anyway.

4072
03:13:26,740 --> 03:13:26,860
Oh.

4073
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:30,640
I see.

4074
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:32,020
One, two...

4075
03:13:32,020 --> 03:13:32,740
One, two...

4076
03:13:33,980 --> 03:13:34,920
This one's tough.

4077
03:13:35,260 --> 03:13:36,100
This one's tough.

4078
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:37,520
Toughy, toughy, tough.

4079
03:13:42,710 --> 03:13:45,850
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

4080
03:13:46,070 --> 03:13:46,470
Oh, huh.

4081
03:13:47,230 --> 03:13:47,450
Okay.

4082
03:14:00,460 --> 03:14:02,200
I still can't tell if...

4083
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:07,200
This is a part of the ten?

4084
03:14:07,340 --> 03:14:08,360
Or if this is...

4085
03:14:08,360 --> 03:14:09,000
This is the...

4086
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:09,680
I don't know.

4087
03:14:10,220 --> 03:14:11,940
I have to do the math eventually.

4088
03:14:14,460 --> 03:14:16,500
One, two, three, four, five...

4089
03:14:16,500 --> 03:14:17,440
See, that's not possible.

4090
03:14:17,960 --> 03:14:18,400
So...

4091
03:14:18,400 --> 03:14:18,500
Wait.

4092
03:14:20,340 --> 03:14:20,780
Ten.

4093
03:14:23,140 --> 03:14:23,760
See, okay.

4094
03:14:25,620 --> 03:14:28,180
This is what confuses me so much about this one.

4095
03:14:28,560 --> 03:14:28,920
So, look.

4096
03:14:29,500 --> 03:14:31,040
We could have one...

4097
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:33,960
Ten...

4098
03:14:36,540 --> 03:14:37,020
Six...

4099
03:14:37,020 --> 03:14:37,840
Oh!

4100
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:39,420
I thought that was four.

4101
03:14:45,380 --> 03:14:47,640
I already solved it,還有...

4102
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:48,080
Why...

4103
03:14:48,080 --> 03:14:49,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

4104
03:14:52,020 --> 03:14:54,500
Ha ha ha ha...

4105
03:14:56,350 --> 03:14:57,330
Okay, wait.

4106
03:14:57,890 --> 03:14:58,410
Now...

4107
03:14:58,410 --> 03:14:59,010
Uh, shoot.

4108
03:14:59,550 --> 03:14:59,990
Okay, wait.

4109
03:15:07,510 --> 03:15:08,870
But then is this the ten?

4110
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:12,150
Okay, all I know is that I can connect these.

4111
03:15:12,330 --> 03:15:12,810
I'm pretty sure.

4112
03:15:19,460 --> 03:15:21,240
I'm pretty sure I can connect those.

4113
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:23,100
Why is this one...

4114
03:15:23,100 --> 03:15:24,300
This one is...

4115
03:15:24,300 --> 03:15:25,740
Scrumming up so bad.

4116
03:15:26,060 --> 03:15:27,040
This is the stick and rope.

4117
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:36,340
And then this one...

4118
03:15:36,340 --> 03:15:36,740
Okay, hold on.

4119
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:37,960
We can do this one too.

4120
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:39,900
Because...

4121
03:15:43,400 --> 03:15:43,800
There's...

4122
03:15:44,200 --> 03:15:44,900
Like that.

4123
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:47,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4124
03:15:47,740 --> 03:15:48,940
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

4125
03:15:49,420 --> 03:15:50,200
Hold on, I'm gonna double check.

4126
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:51,160
Just wait a minute.

4127
03:15:52,300 --> 03:15:53,340
Oh, never mind.

4128
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:54,140
I was so wrong.

4129
03:16:02,630 --> 03:16:03,670
Oh, I see.

4130
03:16:09,650 --> 03:16:10,450
I got...

4131
03:16:10,450 --> 03:16:11,410
I got...

4132
03:16:11,410 --> 03:16:13,070
I got him for the answer.

4133
03:16:14,510 --> 03:16:16,290
I got hand fed the answer.

4134
03:16:16,330 --> 03:16:17,070
I'm sorry.

4135
03:16:20,230 --> 03:16:22,770
I got spoon fed it.

4136
03:16:23,650 --> 03:16:24,750
Oh, I got spoon fed it.

4137
03:16:28,150 --> 03:16:28,830
No...

4138
03:16:28,830 --> 03:16:30,110
There.

4139
03:16:30,750 --> 03:16:30,910
There.

4140
03:16:36,650 --> 03:16:39,030
I got old.

4141
03:16:40,870 --> 03:16:41,390
I got my...

4142
03:16:41,390 --> 03:16:41,510
I got my morning.

4143
03:16:42,670 --> 03:16:42,770
I got my morning.

4144
03:16:42,770 --> 03:16:42,950
I got my...

4145
03:16:43,750 --> 03:16:44,190
We got that.

4146
03:16:45,150 --> 03:16:46,370
4, 2.

4147
03:16:55,490 --> 03:16:56,530
Right?

4148
03:16:57,370 --> 03:17:00,070
2, 1, 2, 2.

4149
03:17:00,850 --> 03:17:01,630
Like that.

4150
03:17:02,070 --> 03:17:02,510
Okay.

4151
03:17:05,250 --> 03:17:07,230
Wait, did I just solve this one?

4152
03:17:07,470 --> 03:17:08,210
One, two, three, four.

4153
03:17:11,230 --> 03:17:12,110
Yeah, we did.

4154
03:17:13,990 --> 03:17:15,210
I think you made a mistake.

4155
03:17:16,430 --> 03:17:16,770
I did.

4156
03:17:16,870 --> 03:17:17,430
I messed up?

4157
03:17:21,670 --> 03:17:22,670
Wait, what did I do?

4158
03:17:23,450 --> 03:17:24,090
Go back.

4159
03:17:30,650 --> 03:17:32,190
Wait, wait, I messed up.

4160
03:17:34,890 --> 03:17:40,680
One, two... I see.

4161
03:17:41,080 --> 03:17:45,420
I... I... I... I stuck the three and the one.

4162
03:17:45,640 --> 03:17:46,820
I switched them in my head.

4163
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:49,480
I'm a little... I can't do numbers well.

4164
03:17:52,820 --> 03:17:54,940
I messed up them in my head.

4165
03:18:01,720 --> 03:18:03,060
Just gotta connect the hat.

4166
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:03,400
Yep.

4167
03:18:04,220 --> 03:18:04,840
Oh, my gosh.

4168
03:18:07,480 --> 03:18:08,600
Oh, my gosh.

4169
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:09,040
Oh, my gosh.

4170
03:18:09,160 --> 03:18:09,760
Oh, my gosh.

4171
03:18:10,680 --> 03:18:12,380
Okay, but then we can still do this.

4172
03:18:15,160 --> 03:18:16,900
Getting the nonogram dyslexia.

4173
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:23,380
Okay, I'll tell you guys a secret.

4174
03:18:23,380 --> 03:18:31,800
Sometimes, I don't know the answer, but I can tell what it is in the picture, so I just connect the dots in the picture.

4175
03:18:36,860 --> 03:18:37,940
That's my...

4176
03:18:40,260 --> 03:18:40,800
...nodogram...

4177
03:18:43,240 --> 03:18:43,780
...tip.

4178
03:18:48,050 --> 03:18:49,610
That's my tip for you.

4179
03:18:55,490 --> 03:18:57,090
That's my tip for you.

4180
03:18:57,090 --> 03:18:57,950
That's amazing.

4181
03:18:58,830 --> 03:18:59,410
That's amazing.

4182
03:19:03,660 --> 03:19:04,620
That's amazing.

4183
03:19:04,880 --> 03:19:06,860
Vibes based nonograms.

4184
03:19:09,060 --> 03:19:10,820
Pretty much...

4185
03:19:13,100 --> 03:19:13,780
One.

4186
03:19:13,780 --> 03:19:14,460
One.

4187
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:15,420
One.

4188
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:22,060
Oh, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

4189
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:24,320
Oh, one.

4190
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:26,340
One.

4191
03:19:27,220 --> 03:19:27,360
One.

4192
03:19:27,580 --> 03:19:28,120
One.

4193
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:32,000
Oh, oh.

4194
03:19:32,440 --> 03:19:33,740
And then right here.

4195
03:19:36,120 --> 03:19:38,040
Okay, okay, okay.

4196
03:19:38,900 --> 03:19:40,340
One, one, one.

4197
03:19:41,340 --> 03:19:42,680
Feel the solution.

4198
03:19:45,700 --> 03:19:46,140
Yeah.

4199
03:19:46,140 --> 03:19:48,400
Entirely vibes based, but it works.

4200
03:19:48,900 --> 03:19:49,800
It works.

4201
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:51,400
Sometimes.

4202
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:55,640
And sometimes, you didn't get it right at all.

4203
03:19:57,460 --> 03:20:01,180
Uh, one, two, three, four, space, one, two, three, four.

4204
03:20:10,920 --> 03:20:15,420
Guys, we're... We're only... Okay, some people were saying this took them, like, so many hours.

4205
03:20:16,140 --> 03:20:16,580
But...

4206
03:20:17,880 --> 03:20:18,820
I'm getting it.

4207
03:20:19,460 --> 03:20:20,260
I'm getting it.

4208
03:20:20,360 --> 03:20:20,940
Not so bad.

4209
03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:23,980
How long have I been streaming, though?

4210
03:20:24,700 --> 03:20:25,340
Three hours.

4211
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:25,760
It's okay.

4212
03:20:25,860 --> 03:20:26,840
I have the next two days off.

4213
03:20:28,620 --> 03:20:29,400
It's all good.

4214
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:31,160
It's all good, baby.

4215
03:20:47,360 --> 03:20:47,780
Okay.

4216
03:20:51,860 --> 03:20:52,580
Like that.

4217
03:20:59,300 --> 03:21:01,700
I'm gonna hear this music in my dreams.

4218
03:21:08,420 --> 03:21:09,620
It's Toby Fox.

4219
03:21:13,180 --> 03:21:15,220
It looks like maybe he's holding something.

4220
03:21:16,400 --> 03:21:19,480
It looks like... This looks like a snake with a top hat.

4221
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:21,540
And this looks like Homestar Runner.

4222
03:21:21,780 --> 03:21:22,820
They're about to kiss.

4223
03:21:28,890 --> 03:21:31,650
Don't ever ask me what I see in the clouds.

4224
03:21:51,690 --> 03:21:53,130
Wait, what else can I do here?

4225
03:22:10,490 --> 03:22:12,950
I wonder what she sees in the clouds.

4226
03:22:16,190 --> 03:22:18,210
Which is worse to get stuck in your head, though?

4227
03:22:18,650 --> 03:22:19,710
This or Meow Tower?

4228
03:22:20,430 --> 03:22:22,890
Oh, actually, I never think about the Meow Tower track.

4229
03:22:23,970 --> 03:22:24,370
Because...

4230
03:22:25,390 --> 03:22:27,390
I don't play it with music on, usually.

4231
03:22:29,770 --> 03:22:30,990
So I never think about it.

4232
03:22:33,490 --> 03:22:35,610
Oh, this row is still a mystery to me.

4233
03:22:36,530 --> 03:22:37,170
Okay, hold on.

4234
03:22:37,370 --> 03:22:38,950
This row maybe is...

4235
03:23:11,300 --> 03:23:12,800
I don't want to touch it yet.

4236
03:23:14,260 --> 03:23:15,660
I don't want to take big risks.

4237
03:23:16,800 --> 03:23:17,600
I don't want to take big risks.

4238
03:23:21,100 --> 03:23:21,460
One.

4239
03:23:21,840 --> 03:23:23,060
I think we can do this one.

4240
03:23:23,860 --> 03:23:24,740
One, two, three.

4241
03:23:25,020 --> 03:23:25,180
Space.

4242
03:23:25,500 --> 03:23:27,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

4243
03:23:28,060 --> 03:23:28,520
I don't want to...

4244
03:23:28,520 --> 03:23:28,820
Eight.

4245
03:23:38,230 --> 03:23:38,950
This one too.

4246
03:23:39,350 --> 03:23:39,590
One.

4247
03:23:40,930 --> 03:23:41,690
One, two, three.

4248
03:23:48,780 --> 03:23:49,140
Space.

4249
03:23:54,120 --> 03:23:54,480
Maybe...

4250
03:23:57,560 --> 03:23:59,080
I think I just don't know this painting.

4251
03:23:59,620 --> 03:24:00,500
I don't know.

4252
03:24:01,520 --> 03:24:02,580
I love how...

4253
03:24:02,580 --> 03:24:04,680
This guy is staring at me.

4254
03:24:04,780 --> 03:24:05,440
Staring me down.

4255
03:24:05,620 --> 03:24:06,180
It's kind of freaky.

4256
03:24:06,720 --> 03:24:08,400
It's kind of freaking me out.

4257
03:24:09,240 --> 03:24:09,780
She's gonna...

4258
03:24:09,780 --> 03:24:10,520
I don't like it.

4259
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:11,680
Oh, wait.

4260
03:24:11,780 --> 03:24:12,440
I can solve this one.

4261
03:24:14,040 --> 03:24:14,520
Nice.

4262
03:24:15,080 --> 03:24:15,560
Nice.

4263
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:21,320
We solved this mystery.

4264
03:24:31,060 --> 03:24:31,720
Oh, wait.

4265
03:24:31,880 --> 03:24:32,380
Can I...

4266
03:24:34,940 --> 03:24:36,140
Two, one...

4267
03:24:36,140 --> 03:24:36,220
Oh.

4268
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:38,820
I could solve it this whole time.

4269
03:24:39,040 --> 03:24:40,380
I didn't notice.

4270
03:24:41,840 --> 03:24:43,080
I didn't even notice.

4271
03:24:45,620 --> 03:24:46,220
Okay.

4272
03:24:48,700 --> 03:24:50,740
He's watching the stream with us.

4273
03:24:53,240 --> 03:24:53,840
Stream...

4274
03:24:53,840 --> 03:24:54,800
Stream...

4275
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:55,100
Sniper.

4276
03:25:14,400 --> 03:25:16,140
The column was done for a while.

4277
03:25:16,140 --> 03:25:18,340
It's so hard to tell sometimes.

4278
03:25:20,160 --> 03:25:22,120
It's hard to tell sometimes.

4279
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:22,460
Okay.

4280
03:25:26,240 --> 03:25:26,720
Okay.

4281
03:25:41,830 --> 03:25:42,310
Yeah.

4282
03:25:42,890 --> 03:25:43,030
Oh.

4283
03:25:43,350 --> 03:25:43,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4284
03:25:43,950 --> 03:25:44,050
Okay.

4285
03:25:44,570 --> 03:25:44,850
Sorry.

4286
03:25:44,970 --> 03:25:46,210
I thought it was two twos.

4287
03:25:48,270 --> 03:25:49,230
Two twos.

4288
03:25:52,350 --> 03:25:52,830
Three.

4289
03:25:52,830 --> 03:25:52,930
Three.

4290
03:25:54,310 --> 03:25:54,710
Okay.

4291
03:25:55,470 --> 03:25:56,830
So, one somewhere.

4292
03:25:57,810 --> 03:25:58,730
And then one.

4293
03:26:01,390 --> 03:26:01,790
Okay.

4294
03:26:03,270 --> 03:26:04,350
Oh, yo, yo, yo.

4295
03:26:12,900 --> 03:26:13,300
Yeah.

4296
03:26:13,560 --> 03:26:13,720
Okay.

4297
03:26:13,960 --> 03:26:14,660
So, that's that.

4298
03:26:18,540 --> 03:26:18,940
Space.

4299
03:26:20,280 --> 03:26:20,680
Wait.

4300
03:26:20,880 --> 03:26:22,040
One, two, three, four, five.

4301
03:26:22,200 --> 03:26:22,360
Yeah.

4302
03:26:22,540 --> 03:26:22,700
Space.

4303
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:24,520
Oh, no, no, no, no.

4304
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:28,020
1, 2, 3, 4, space.

4305
03:26:28,420 --> 03:26:30,640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

4306
03:26:31,500 --> 03:26:32,480
1, 2, 3, 4, space.

4307
03:26:33,660 --> 03:26:35,160
Why am I not using the counter?

4308
03:26:37,140 --> 03:26:37,560
Okay.

4309
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:48,200
It's not very well known in the US popular culture.

4310
03:26:53,200 --> 03:26:55,540
It's a pride and joy of an insert museum here.

4311
03:26:56,360 --> 03:26:58,160
Oh, it gets its own wall and everything?

4312
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:00,600
Really?

4313
03:27:04,500 --> 03:27:06,080
Is he riding a horse?

4314
03:27:07,800 --> 03:27:10,940
I'm trying to

4315
03:27:17,580 --> 03:27:19,780
figure out which one I want to go for right now.

4316
03:27:20,460 --> 03:27:21,280
Maybe this?

4317
03:27:23,540 --> 03:27:24,040
Oh.

4318
03:27:40,490 --> 03:27:42,450
It looks like his hands are up.

4319
03:27:42,530 --> 03:27:42,930
Yeah, maybe.

4320
03:27:43,710 --> 03:27:45,030
It belongs in a museum.

4321
03:27:46,170 --> 03:27:46,670
Clearly.

4322
03:27:50,810 --> 03:27:51,310
Okay.

4323
03:27:54,910 --> 03:27:55,830
Oh my goodness.

4324
03:28:07,650 --> 03:28:09,230
I don't know why I didn't do that sooner.

4325
03:28:16,390 --> 03:28:18,290
Okay, so three...

4326
03:28:19,330 --> 03:28:20,750
We'll just do space like that.

4327
03:28:22,290 --> 03:28:22,730
Uh...

4328
03:28:22,730 --> 03:28:23,570
One...

4329
03:28:24,030 --> 03:28:24,470
Space...

4330
03:28:24,470 --> 03:28:25,310
One, two, three...

4331
03:28:26,710 --> 03:28:27,150
Space...

4332
03:28:27,150 --> 03:28:29,150
One, two, three, four...

4333
03:28:29,150 --> 03:28:29,710
Space...

4334
03:28:29,710 --> 03:28:31,070
One, two, three, four...

4335
03:28:31,070 --> 03:28:32,030
Five, six, seven...

4336
03:28:32,030 --> 03:28:32,950
Ah...

4337
03:28:33,850 --> 03:28:35,290
This is art.

4338
03:28:36,790 --> 03:28:38,250
It is art.

4339
03:28:39,010 --> 03:28:40,090
Raiden, are you enjoying...

4340
03:28:40,590 --> 03:28:41,930
Are you enjoying this?

4341
03:28:43,850 --> 03:28:44,490
One...

4342
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,310
Space...

4343
03:28:45,310 --> 03:28:47,070
One, two, three, four...

4344
03:28:48,550 --> 03:28:49,190
Hmm...

4345
03:28:49,190 --> 03:28:49,610
Hmm...

4346
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:50,010
Maybe?

4347
03:28:50,230 --> 03:28:51,470
I'm gonna check if that's right or not.

4348
03:28:51,470 --> 03:28:52,390
One, two, three, four...

4349
03:28:53,830 --> 03:28:54,270
One, two, three, four...

4350
03:28:55,490 --> 03:28:55,930
Holy...

4351
03:28:58,150 --> 03:28:59,070
We got it.

4352
03:29:02,950 --> 03:29:03,990
So far, so good.

4353
03:29:04,230 --> 03:29:05,730
If this is a horse...

4354
03:29:05,730 --> 03:29:07,150
Okay, all I see is it's...

4355
03:29:07,150 --> 03:29:08,830
Okay, I see ears like this.

4356
03:29:09,030 --> 03:29:11,210
I see a nose like Brian Griffin.

4357
03:29:11,210 --> 03:29:13,550
And I see a little dot pixel eye.

4358
03:29:13,750 --> 03:29:15,310
It looks so stupid.

4359
03:29:22,140 --> 03:29:23,160
Like it's all...

4360
03:29:23,160 --> 03:29:24,520
It's all I see...

4361
03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:26,760
At the moment.

4362
03:29:31,140 --> 03:29:32,060
I know I...

4363
03:29:32,060 --> 03:29:33,780
It says I can do this role, but...

4364
03:29:33,780 --> 03:29:34,220
I don't know.

4365
03:29:34,460 --> 03:29:35,040
I don't know.

4366
03:29:49,380 --> 03:29:50,960
Oh, wait.

4367
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:54,600
Okay, so this...

4368
03:29:58,580 --> 03:30:00,100
Like that...

4369
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:02,100
I think...

4370
03:30:15,060 --> 03:30:16,420
Okay...

4371
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:24,060
I'm so nervous.

4372
03:30:29,080 --> 03:30:32,500
You're done with the 4, 1, 1, 1, 8 column.

4373
03:30:35,640 --> 03:30:37,060
I don't even see that.

4374
03:30:38,520 --> 03:30:40,100
Oh, thank you.

4375
03:30:42,180 --> 03:30:43,740
Thank you, thank you.

4376
03:30:53,390 --> 03:30:54,630
One, two...

4377
03:30:54,630 --> 03:30:55,730
Space...

4378
03:30:55,730 --> 03:30:56,370
Wait, space.

4379
03:30:58,870 --> 03:30:59,830
Let's just say one.

4380
03:31:04,850 --> 03:31:06,070
I'm so tired.

4381
03:31:09,250 --> 03:31:11,530
I don't think I will play Miao Tower tonight.

4382
03:31:27,280 --> 03:31:29,140
I think I've had my fill.

4383
03:31:34,480 --> 03:31:36,560
She didn't say anything really exciting.

4384
03:31:36,840 --> 03:31:38,460
When I completed that one, it makes...

4385
03:31:38,460 --> 03:31:39,700
It feels bad, man.

4386
03:31:40,520 --> 03:31:41,920
It feels bad.

4387
03:31:43,660 --> 03:31:46,720
Please get excited once I complete a column.

4388
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:48,500
Every time, please.

4389
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:50,220
Oh.

4390
03:31:50,800 --> 03:31:52,520
I don't think I finished it.

4391
03:31:52,760 --> 03:31:53,520
That's why...

4392
03:31:56,250 --> 03:31:57,280
I think that's why.

4393
03:31:57,440 --> 03:31:59,180
Because I didn't technically finish it.

4394
03:31:59,560 --> 03:31:59,620
Oh.

4395
03:32:00,180 --> 03:32:01,140
Now I feel better.

4396
03:32:01,420 --> 03:32:02,320
Now I feel validated.

4397
03:32:02,520 --> 03:32:03,260
Okay, so...

4398
03:32:03,260 --> 03:32:04,040
4...

4399
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:05,380
1...

4400
03:32:05,380 --> 03:32:05,820
Wait.

4401
03:32:05,820 --> 03:32:06,840
What row am I at?

4402
03:32:06,920 --> 03:32:07,320
4...

4403
03:32:07,320 --> 03:32:07,800
1...

4404
03:32:07,800 --> 03:32:08,480
2...

4405
03:32:09,340 --> 03:32:09,740
1...

4406
03:32:10,220 --> 03:32:10,620
2...

4407
03:32:12,780 --> 03:32:14,220
Wait, I think we finished this one also.

4408
03:32:14,920 --> 03:32:15,120
Yeah.

4409
03:32:16,160 --> 03:32:17,320
Oh my god.

4410
03:32:17,700 --> 03:32:18,340
Oh my god.

4411
03:32:18,340 --> 03:32:19,400
The end is nigh.

4412
03:32:27,420 --> 03:32:28,900
The end is near.

4413
03:32:29,520 --> 03:32:30,960
For half the painting.

4414
03:32:32,180 --> 03:32:33,020
Oh

4415
03:32:58,670 --> 03:32:59,330
my gosh.

4416
03:33:00,930 --> 03:33:02,090
Oh my gosh.

4417
03:33:03,330 --> 03:33:05,050
We really completed like...

4418
03:33:05,050 --> 03:33:06,110
Exactly...

4419
03:33:06,110 --> 03:33:06,970
Like half of it.

4420
03:33:23,970 --> 03:33:25,610
Oh my god.

4421
03:33:25,610 --> 03:33:25,630
Oh my god.

4422
03:33:26,230 --> 03:33:28,350
All the pieces are falling into place now.

4423
03:33:28,790 --> 03:33:29,410
Hehehehe.

4424
03:33:29,410 --> 03:33:30,410
Oh my god.

4425
03:33:31,770 --> 03:33:31,830
Okay.

4426
03:33:32,810 --> 03:33:33,730
So this would be one.

4427
03:33:34,950 --> 03:33:35,950
Most likely.

4428
03:33:43,010 --> 03:33:43,650
One...

4429
03:33:45,110 --> 03:33:45,750
Yes.

4430
03:33:46,470 --> 03:33:47,670
Wait, and this one too.

4431
03:33:49,130 --> 03:33:49,490
That's great.

4432
03:33:51,930 --> 03:33:54,110
Does PCOS get easier the more you solve?

4433
03:33:54,390 --> 03:33:54,930
Oh yeah.

4434
03:33:55,490 --> 03:33:57,270
Because eventually...

4435
03:33:58,070 --> 03:33:58,710
You'll...

4436
03:33:58,710 --> 03:34:00,990
Especially like with...

4437
03:34:00,990 --> 03:34:01,810
Like...

4438
03:34:01,810 --> 03:34:02,470
How do I say?

4439
03:34:04,150 --> 03:34:05,770
You'll start to recognize patterns.

4440
03:34:07,010 --> 03:34:08,190
And you'll be able to like...

4441
03:34:08,190 --> 03:34:09,430
Be a lot faster.

4442
03:34:09,630 --> 03:34:10,410
Because you can be like...

4443
03:34:10,410 --> 03:34:11,470
Oh, if I see...

4444
03:34:11,470 --> 03:34:13,150
4, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2.

4445
03:34:13,330 --> 03:34:14,370
I know where to put...

4446
03:34:14,370 --> 03:34:15,550
This, this, this, this, this, this, this.

4447
03:34:15,890 --> 03:34:16,290
You know?

4448
03:34:20,410 --> 03:34:21,130
And then yeah.

4449
03:34:21,190 --> 03:34:22,510
You'll rule out possibilities.

4450
03:34:22,730 --> 03:34:25,750
And it gets smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller.

4451
03:34:28,990 --> 03:34:30,470
And eventually you complete it.

4452
03:34:31,070 --> 03:34:32,810
Yeah, assuming you haven't made any mistakes.

4453
03:34:32,810 --> 03:34:33,430
Yeah.

4454
03:34:36,550 --> 03:34:38,830
I'm kind of glad this has a little checker.

4455
03:34:39,030 --> 03:34:39,710
Not gonna lie.

4456
03:34:40,390 --> 03:34:41,630
Makes me feel at ease.

4457
03:34:46,260 --> 03:34:47,580
2, space.

4458
03:34:49,160 --> 03:34:50,000
Yeah, okay.

4459
03:34:52,300 --> 03:34:53,260
Wait, so then...

4460
03:34:53,260 --> 03:34:54,500
2, space.

4461
03:34:56,840 --> 03:34:57,920
6, space.

4462
03:34:59,740 --> 03:35:01,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

4463
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:02,100
There we go.

4464
03:35:10,430 --> 03:35:11,230
Like that.

4465
03:35:12,450 --> 03:35:13,330
Like this.

4466
03:35:15,170 --> 03:35:15,730
Like...

4467
03:35:15,730 --> 03:35:16,490
2...

4468
03:35:16,490 --> 03:35:17,270
Spares.

4469
03:35:19,470 --> 03:35:20,490
No, not yet.

4470
03:35:20,490 --> 03:35:20,570
What?

4471
03:35:20,610 --> 03:35:21,430
Oh, yeah.

4472
03:35:21,610 --> 03:35:21,890
That's...

4473
03:35:21,890 --> 03:35:22,610
It's grayed out.

4474
03:35:25,870 --> 03:35:27,710
I wonder what Nancy Drew would do.

4475
03:35:30,630 --> 03:35:31,750
She would...

4476
03:35:32,230 --> 03:35:33,490
She would probably...

4477
03:35:34,050 --> 03:35:35,570
Accept her fate and...

4478
03:35:36,750 --> 03:35:37,970
Drown in the...

4479
03:35:37,970 --> 03:35:38,790
In the onsen.

4480
03:35:39,010 --> 03:35:39,950
At the ryokan.

4481
03:35:48,790 --> 03:35:51,150
She would accept her fate.

4482
03:35:52,110 --> 03:35:52,830
Naruhodo.

4483
03:35:54,710 --> 03:35:55,070
Word.

4484
03:35:57,690 --> 03:35:58,630
Let's see.

4485
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:05,400
What do you mean I can do something here?

4486
03:36:05,660 --> 03:36:06,160
I don't know.

4487
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:07,920
Look at this one.

4488
03:36:08,080 --> 03:36:10,560
We haven't even put a single thing in some of these...

4489
03:36:10,560 --> 03:36:11,320
Rows or columns.

4490
03:36:11,520 --> 03:36:11,980
That's crazy.

4491
03:36:12,820 --> 03:36:13,140
Right?

4492
03:36:15,420 --> 03:36:17,340
The ones that we haven't even touched.

4493
03:36:17,960 --> 03:36:18,440
That's...

4494
03:36:18,440 --> 03:36:19,460
That's scary.

4495
03:36:24,100 --> 03:36:25,700
I think I'm done with the soundtrack.

4496
03:36:26,020 --> 03:36:27,220
I really liked it at first.

4497
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:30,860
Can I change the song?

4498
03:36:32,960 --> 03:36:34,040
How do I...

4499
03:36:34,600 --> 03:36:35,900
How do I change the music?

4500
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:37,680
How

4501
03:36:45,190 --> 03:36:45,310
do I change the music?

4502
03:36:46,010 --> 03:36:46,470
Oh...

4503
03:36:47,750 --> 03:36:48,890
Oh, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4504
03:36:48,970 --> 03:36:49,990
Uh, don't go...

4505
03:36:57,280 --> 03:36:57,740
Freedom.

4506
03:37:00,560 --> 03:37:01,020
Freedom.

4507
03:37:02,620 --> 03:37:03,080
Freedom.

4508
03:37:06,140 --> 03:37:07,640
Let's listen to...

4509
03:37:14,110 --> 03:37:15,450
This is what I always put on.

4510
03:37:25,340 --> 03:37:27,280
There is an option to change the song.

4511
03:37:27,680 --> 03:37:28,480
Oh, no kidding?

4512
03:37:28,880 --> 03:37:29,890
Oh, it probably changes...

4513
03:37:29,890 --> 03:37:38,950
It changes depending on... you know how it changes when you go to a different part of the museum?

4514
03:37:38,950 --> 03:37:42,010
It probably is like, if you want to change it to any of those songs.

4515
03:37:42,190 --> 03:37:45,310
But, I want to save those for when I hear them for the first time.

4516
03:37:47,450 --> 03:37:49,070
So, it's okay.

4517
03:37:58,780 --> 03:38:01,380
So, only two ones can fit in here.

4518
03:38:01,520 --> 03:38:06,180
So, let's just say one, space, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

4519
03:38:06,180 --> 03:38:07,660
Has to be like that.

4520
03:38:09,160 --> 03:38:09,840
Right?

4521
03:38:10,180 --> 03:38:10,620
Okay, hold on.

4522
03:38:13,540 --> 03:38:14,220
Exactly.

4523
03:38:14,980 --> 03:38:16,500
I was right!

4524
03:38:21,020 --> 03:38:22,180
I knew I was right.

4525
03:38:22,520 --> 03:38:24,080
I was just testing you guys.

4526
03:38:26,100 --> 03:38:27,860
Why is it still so difficult?

4527
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:51,760
If I do five, space...

4528
03:38:54,040 --> 03:38:55,600
So, it's not possible.

4529
03:38:55,600 --> 03:38:58,160
But, it could still be like space here.

4530
03:39:00,720 --> 03:39:01,680
Oh my gosh.

4531
03:39:02,660 --> 03:39:03,600
This area sucks.

4532
03:39:18,550 --> 03:39:20,350
So, let's just fill in these.

4533
03:39:20,930 --> 03:39:23,430
Because we know it's got to be that, at least.

4534
03:39:24,910 --> 03:39:25,810
I turn 11.

4535
03:39:27,810 --> 03:39:30,730
What if I start from down here, it goes to 11.

4536
03:39:31,430 --> 03:39:32,690
Then, how do you know?

4537
03:39:35,170 --> 03:39:37,070
Help the final artist, NSFW.

4538
03:39:38,950 --> 03:39:41,730
This kind of looks like a boob with a nipple.

4539
03:39:43,970 --> 03:39:45,570
It's nice and round.

4540
03:39:45,950 --> 03:39:46,870
In Minecraft.

4541
03:40:06,150 --> 03:40:07,510
Come on, come on.

4542
03:40:08,470 --> 03:40:09,450
Let's see.

4543
03:40:10,890 --> 03:40:11,890
6, 7, 8.

4544
03:40:11,890 --> 03:40:11,930
6, 7, 8.

4545
03:40:15,390 --> 03:40:17,130
1, 2, 3.

4546
03:40:17,290 --> 03:40:17,630
Space.

4547
03:40:18,070 --> 03:40:20,530
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

4548
03:40:23,630 --> 03:40:25,370
So, for the 2, 1, 2, 1.

4549
03:40:25,450 --> 03:40:27,670
If the field is in box...

4550
03:40:27,670 --> 03:40:27,810
Wait.

4551
03:40:29,730 --> 03:40:31,410
Must be X under.

4552
03:40:37,830 --> 03:40:38,350
What?

4553
03:40:39,850 --> 03:40:41,150
For 2, 1, 2, 1.

4554
03:40:41,210 --> 03:40:44,050
If the field in box is 1...

4555
03:40:44,930 --> 03:40:46,510
It's X on both sides.

4556
03:40:46,730 --> 03:40:47,650
If it's 2, there must be...

4557
03:40:49,770 --> 03:40:51,130
Separated from the...

4558
03:40:56,200 --> 03:40:56,720
Oh!

4559
03:40:59,080 --> 03:41:00,620
I get it.

4560
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:03,400
Therefore, it must be an X under.

4561
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:05,940
Like she said.

4562
03:41:05,940 --> 03:41:09,460
That was not helpful.

4563
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:10,840
Actually, it was quite helpful.

4564
03:41:11,060 --> 03:41:11,720
Once I...

4565
03:41:11,720 --> 03:41:13,680
Once I re-read it.

4566
03:41:17,020 --> 03:41:18,820
Only the bottom is guaranteed...

4567
03:41:18,820 --> 03:41:19,020
Yes!

4568
03:41:19,180 --> 03:41:21,720
So, the reason I left it alone is because I was like...

4569
03:41:21,720 --> 03:41:22,600
Oh, what if it's 2?

4570
03:41:22,860 --> 03:41:23,680
But you're so right.

4571
03:41:23,700 --> 03:41:25,060
I didn't even think about...

4572
03:41:25,060 --> 03:41:27,140
It would have to be like 2...

4573
03:41:27,960 --> 03:41:28,880
X, 1.

4574
03:41:29,240 --> 03:41:31,680
Or if it's 1, it's X here.

4575
03:41:32,980 --> 03:41:33,780
Thank you.

4576
03:41:36,560 --> 03:41:39,420
Art is just whatever you interpret it to be, after all.

4577
03:41:42,320 --> 03:41:44,100
I'm gonna become an artist...

4578
03:41:44,100 --> 03:41:45,900
That only does half paintings.

4579
03:41:46,760 --> 03:41:49,480
So that this P-Cross puzzle would be done by now.

4580
03:41:53,480 --> 03:41:54,780
It would be over.

4581
03:41:56,940 --> 03:41:59,320
Thank God, I'm not the streamer.

4582
03:42:00,180 --> 03:42:01,460
What do you mean by that?

4583
03:42:04,520 --> 03:42:06,120
What do you mean by that?

4584
03:42:14,910 --> 03:42:16,130
Does this go to...

4585
03:42:16,690 --> 03:42:17,090
No.

4586
03:42:17,530 --> 03:42:17,650
Okay.

4587
03:42:18,110 --> 03:42:18,990
So now we can do this.

4588
03:42:19,450 --> 03:42:20,250
Like that.

4589
03:42:22,730 --> 03:42:23,250
Okay.

4590
03:42:23,250 --> 03:42:24,910
How we feeling, y'all?

4591
03:42:27,290 --> 03:42:28,510
How we feeling?

4592
03:42:35,050 --> 03:42:35,450
Good.

4593
03:42:38,070 --> 03:42:39,490
Wow, thank you so much for both.

4594
03:42:39,710 --> 03:42:40,110
Thank you.

4595
03:42:42,250 --> 03:42:44,450
But those would still be full P-Cross puzzles.

4596
03:42:44,610 --> 03:42:44,870
Well, no.

4597
03:42:44,970 --> 03:42:46,090
I would leave it like this.

4598
03:42:48,970 --> 03:42:50,390
This is how it would look.

4599
03:42:51,190 --> 03:42:52,170
Brian Griffin.

4600
03:42:52,810 --> 03:42:53,710
Well, not so much anymore.

4601
03:42:55,270 --> 03:42:56,150
Minecraft boom.

4602
03:42:57,530 --> 03:43:00,190
Aren't there like not safe for work mods for Minecraft?

4603
03:43:09,410 --> 03:43:10,730
What does that entail?

4604
03:43:12,570 --> 03:43:13,330
Oh, yeah.

4605
03:43:14,750 --> 03:43:14,830
Oh.

4606
03:43:15,370 --> 03:43:16,550
You know all about them then.

4607
03:43:17,190 --> 03:43:17,610
Lots.

4608
03:43:18,130 --> 03:43:19,110
You guys are pros.

4609
03:43:24,600 --> 03:43:26,020
The internet exists.

4610
03:43:26,420 --> 03:43:26,680
Yeah.

4611
03:43:28,940 --> 03:43:30,000
I just like...

4612
03:43:30,000 --> 03:43:30,620
I just...

4613
03:43:30,620 --> 03:43:31,740
You know, I've only heard of it.

4614
03:43:31,880 --> 03:43:32,160
I don't...

4615
03:43:32,160 --> 03:43:32,640
I'm like, what?

4616
03:43:33,540 --> 03:43:35,360
What do you do in the...

4617
03:43:35,360 --> 03:43:36,980
Okay, so this can't be...

4618
03:43:39,400 --> 03:43:39,980
Wait.

4619
03:43:40,540 --> 03:43:41,400
I lied.

4620
03:43:45,260 --> 03:43:47,240
She's so cute when she does that.

4621
03:43:47,360 --> 03:43:47,780
Okay, yes.

4622
03:43:47,920 --> 03:43:48,260
Rewind.

4623
03:43:49,800 --> 03:43:51,680
I misread it as the two.

4624
03:43:51,980 --> 03:43:52,540
As this two.

4625
03:43:55,700 --> 03:43:56,280
Three.

4626
03:43:57,400 --> 03:43:57,980
One.

4627
03:43:58,380 --> 03:43:58,560
One.

4628
03:43:59,040 --> 03:43:59,240
Two.

4629
03:44:02,730 --> 03:44:03,550
Wait a second.

4630
03:44:06,550 --> 03:44:07,790
Would it not be that?

4631
03:44:07,790 --> 03:44:08,530
Yeah.

4632
03:44:09,290 --> 03:44:09,410
Yeah.

4633
03:44:09,410 --> 03:44:10,710
Three, one, one...

4634
03:44:10,710 --> 03:44:11,150
Two.

4635
03:44:11,390 --> 03:44:11,510
Okay.

4636
03:44:13,070 --> 03:44:13,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4637
03:44:17,160 --> 03:44:19,660
I only know the giant bunny Toki mod.

4638
03:44:20,600 --> 03:44:21,340
I need that.

4639
03:44:25,440 --> 03:44:26,860
How do we come to this subject?

4640
03:44:27,200 --> 03:44:27,420
Oh.

4641
03:44:27,700 --> 03:44:29,760
Because this kind of looked like a Minecraft boom.

4642
03:44:33,220 --> 03:44:37,340
I see a cowboy holding a baby.

4643
03:44:37,880 --> 03:44:47,300
And an alien creature with one eye kind of looks like a Pokemon unknown gazing upon their child.

4644
03:44:50,160 --> 03:44:51,240
Not seeing it.

4645
03:44:51,360 --> 03:44:52,160
Oh my gosh.

4646
03:44:52,260 --> 03:44:53,280
Have some whimsy.

4647
03:44:56,460 --> 03:44:57,220
Whimsy.

4648
03:44:57,220 --> 03:44:59,240
Have some whimsy in your life.

4649
03:44:59,940 --> 03:45:01,860
I'm dead and I'm whimsy.

4650
03:45:05,320 --> 03:45:06,880
Wow, you got it.

4651
03:45:06,880 --> 03:45:07,820
No.

4652
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:11,120
Don't lie to me.

4653
03:45:12,920 --> 03:45:15,580
Serious man in hat takes Etina on date.

4654
03:45:16,880 --> 03:45:17,560
No.

4655
03:45:17,860 --> 03:45:19,820
She's not allowed to date.

4656
03:45:25,310 --> 03:45:26,850
It'll break her parole.

4657
03:45:29,410 --> 03:45:32,170
I think we can do this.

4658
03:45:32,770 --> 03:45:33,250
Yes.

4659
03:45:43,010 --> 03:45:43,810
Oh my gosh.

4660
03:45:43,810 --> 03:45:45,290
We're running out of blue.

4661
03:45:47,610 --> 03:45:48,890
We're running out of blue.

4662
03:45:49,670 --> 03:45:51,470
How are we back to blue here?

4663
03:45:53,890 --> 03:45:55,350
What else can I do?

4664
03:46:03,810 --> 03:46:05,530
Okay, so this has to be four.

4665
03:46:07,210 --> 03:46:07,990
Yeah, yeah.

4666
03:46:07,990 --> 03:46:09,670
One, two, three, four.

4667
03:46:09,890 --> 03:46:10,950
Okay, this like that.

4668
03:46:13,450 --> 03:46:13,910
Five.

4669
03:46:16,990 --> 03:46:17,450
Okay.

4670
03:46:28,440 --> 03:46:29,550
And then this is...

4671
03:46:31,580 --> 03:46:32,040
Narn.

4672
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:38,780
Okay, we're back in business.

4673
03:46:39,020 --> 03:46:39,280
Maybe.

4674
03:46:39,820 --> 03:46:40,540
A little bit.

4675
03:46:41,960 --> 03:46:43,280
Okay, we made some progress.

4676
03:46:43,580 --> 03:46:43,640
Okay.

4677
03:46:44,340 --> 03:46:45,120
And I'm off topic.

4678
03:46:45,300 --> 03:46:47,680
I'm snacking on some hot mustard Doritos.

4679
03:46:47,680 --> 03:46:49,000
And they're surprisingly good.

4680
03:46:49,060 --> 03:46:50,700
You should try them if you find them in your area.

4681
03:46:51,860 --> 03:46:52,920
Are they spicy?

4682
03:46:53,320 --> 03:46:54,900
I also hate the taste of mustard.

4683
03:47:03,210 --> 03:47:06,510
The 2-1-2-1 needs the same X as the 2-1 column.

4684
03:47:08,850 --> 03:47:09,330
This?

4685
03:47:12,910 --> 03:47:13,390
Huh?

4686
03:47:21,720 --> 03:47:23,340
Nah, I don't like mustard.

4687
03:47:24,160 --> 03:47:26,220
I've always hated it ever since I was a kid.

4688
03:47:27,780 --> 03:47:28,140
Hold

4689
03:47:39,490 --> 03:47:39,710
on.

4690
03:47:39,990 --> 03:47:40,090
Hold on.

4691
03:47:40,090 --> 03:47:40,370
I'm gonna check.

4692
03:47:40,430 --> 03:47:40,710
I'm gonna check.

4693
03:47:41,410 --> 03:47:41,970
Okay, good.

4694
03:47:42,610 --> 03:47:43,690
I was scared for a second.

4695
03:47:46,270 --> 03:47:47,650
Okay, we can do this.

4696
03:47:48,410 --> 03:47:49,370
And we can do this.

4697
03:47:49,870 --> 03:47:50,090
Okay.

4698
03:47:51,130 --> 03:47:52,790
Got rid of that, at least.

4699
03:47:52,790 --> 03:47:52,930
Okay, let's go.

4700
03:47:52,930 --> 03:47:54,310
I just...

4701
03:47:56,570 --> 03:47:57,490
I'm waiting.

4702
03:48:06,740 --> 03:48:07,600
Wait a second.

4703
03:48:08,060 --> 03:48:08,520
What?

4704
03:48:09,280 --> 03:48:10,000
I guess so?

4705
03:48:10,660 --> 03:48:11,480
What...?

4706
03:48:29,260 --> 03:48:30,400
Oh, I see.

4707
03:48:30,620 --> 03:48:32,240
I think you...you mean like this, right?

4708
03:48:32,540 --> 03:48:33,040
Yeah, yeah.

4709
03:48:35,040 --> 03:48:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4710
03:48:36,220 --> 03:48:36,960
I got you.

4711
03:48:38,580 --> 03:48:40,580
I got you, I got you.

4712
03:48:50,970 --> 03:48:51,430
Okay.

4713
03:48:52,850 --> 03:48:55,830
Now, this is...gotta be...two.

4714
03:48:56,750 --> 03:48:58,130
And then this has got to be four.

4715
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:02,390
Raiden seems to agree with the move.

4716
03:49:03,330 --> 03:49:04,250
You can put an X.

4717
03:49:04,770 --> 03:49:05,630
Yeah, I did.

4718
03:49:08,190 --> 03:49:09,670
Same for the two, one, two, one.

4719
03:49:11,310 --> 03:49:11,990
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4720
03:49:12,610 --> 03:49:12,870
Oh, what?

4721
03:49:16,310 --> 03:49:16,670
Yes.

4722
03:49:18,110 --> 03:49:19,210
Two, one.

4723
03:49:20,170 --> 03:49:21,410
Two, three.

4724
03:49:22,750 --> 03:49:23,790
Okay, I like that.

4725
03:49:23,910 --> 03:49:25,990
And then two...these are the twos.

4726
03:49:26,950 --> 03:49:27,930
Okay, so two, one.

4727
03:49:28,130 --> 03:49:28,610
There we go.

4728
03:49:28,790 --> 03:49:29,210
I'll get in there.

4729
03:49:58,170 --> 03:50:01,870
I can't tell what this...what the right side is, though.

4730
03:50:02,710 --> 03:50:05,730
It's taking shape, but into...what?

4731
03:50:07,690 --> 03:50:08,650
Into what?

4732
03:50:10,610 --> 03:50:14,150
I don't know yet.

4733
03:50:14,410 --> 03:50:14,550
Here.

4734
03:50:15,390 --> 03:50:15,930
Maybe.

4735
03:50:16,290 --> 03:50:17,830
It says we know, but I don't know.

4736
03:50:18,370 --> 03:50:21,450
It says we know, but don't trust it.

4737
03:50:21,690 --> 03:50:22,230
Okay.

4738
03:50:26,010 --> 03:50:27,530
It says we don't know, but we don't know.

4739
03:50:27,730 --> 03:50:28,530
We don't know.

4740
03:50:33,890 --> 03:50:34,830
We don't know.

4741
03:50:35,130 --> 03:50:35,990
Don't trust it.

4742
03:50:36,910 --> 03:50:37,590
Just don't trust it.

4743
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:41,410
Oh!

4744
03:50:41,770 --> 03:50:45,310
Oh my gosh, I thought that was a...a...a cross...out.

4745
03:50:45,510 --> 03:50:47,650
And I was like, about to...I was about to crash out.

4746
03:50:47,790 --> 03:50:49,570
I was about to be like, where did I make a mistake?

4747
03:50:49,570 --> 03:50:51,830
I could not...no!

4748
03:50:52,910 --> 03:50:54,650
Okay, so this can be like that.

4749
03:50:57,210 --> 03:50:58,870
We are so close.

4750
03:50:58,870 --> 03:50:59,650
Holy cow.

4751
03:51:00,230 --> 03:51:01,770
Maybe it will take me two hours.

4752
03:51:04,650 --> 03:51:08,010
In the end, I was bragging about how fast I was going.

4753
03:51:09,050 --> 03:51:10,890
That's gonna take me two hours also.

4754
03:51:14,830 --> 03:51:16,350
I was like, oh, yeah.

4755
03:51:17,470 --> 03:51:18,130
Please, no.

4756
03:51:18,470 --> 03:51:18,810
I've what?

4757
03:51:18,930 --> 03:51:21,470
It's 30 more minutes until two hours.

4758
03:51:32,160 --> 03:51:36,860
What I feel like is funny is because I feel like...

4759
03:51:36,860 --> 03:51:38,540
I don't have so much left.

4760
03:51:39,220 --> 03:51:41,480
Because I don't have so many blue left.

4761
03:51:42,160 --> 03:51:44,220
But I actually do have a lot left.

4762
03:51:45,480 --> 03:51:45,960
Because...

4763
03:51:46,520 --> 03:51:47,140
Oh, wait.

4764
03:51:47,200 --> 03:51:48,140
We can't complete this one.

4765
03:51:54,540 --> 03:51:56,420
Because there's still so many white.

4766
03:51:56,780 --> 03:51:57,520
You know what I mean?

4767
03:51:58,180 --> 03:51:59,440
Something seems incorrect.

4768
03:52:03,980 --> 03:52:05,980
You are the one incorrect.

4769
03:52:09,450 --> 03:52:10,810
You are the one incorrect.

4770
03:52:29,610 --> 03:52:31,510
I think this is probably like this.

4771
03:52:34,090 --> 03:52:35,390
Because it can't be...

4772
03:52:37,230 --> 03:52:38,910
Yeah, because there's three ones left.

4773
03:52:38,910 --> 03:52:40,110
So it can't be...

4774
03:52:40,770 --> 03:52:41,290
Can't be.

4775
03:52:41,450 --> 03:52:41,950
It can't be.

4776
03:52:42,050 --> 03:52:42,350
Okay.

4777
03:52:44,770 --> 03:52:45,190
Sorry.

4778
03:52:47,090 --> 03:52:47,510
What?

4779
03:52:55,010 --> 03:52:56,370
The two, five...

4780
03:52:56,370 --> 03:52:57,510
Two, two columns does it add up?

4781
03:52:57,590 --> 03:52:58,510
I don't know what to tell you.

4782
03:52:58,710 --> 03:52:59,210
It doesn't...

4783
03:52:59,210 --> 03:53:01,050
It said I didn't make any mistakes.

4784
03:53:03,630 --> 03:53:05,050
But also, yes, it does.

4785
03:53:09,310 --> 03:53:09,730
Five.

4786
03:53:09,730 --> 03:53:09,890
Five.

4787
03:53:11,130 --> 03:53:12,570
And then two and two.

4788
03:53:13,350 --> 03:53:14,430
Or this could be two.

4789
03:53:15,170 --> 03:53:16,150
Or this could be two.

4790
03:53:16,610 --> 03:53:17,810
This could be the five.

4791
03:53:36,960 --> 03:53:37,420
Two.

4792
03:53:38,300 --> 03:53:38,760
Okay.

4793
03:53:38,900 --> 03:53:40,280
I still don't know quite that one.

4794
03:53:41,100 --> 03:53:42,060
And two, three.

4795
03:53:42,500 --> 03:53:42,580
Oh.

4796
03:53:43,240 --> 03:53:43,620
Okay.

4797
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:44,860
We can get that one.

4798
03:53:45,000 --> 03:53:45,980
And we can get that one.

4799
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:46,760
Very nice.

4800
03:53:46,840 --> 03:53:47,080
Very nice.

4801
03:53:47,180 --> 03:53:47,600
Very nice.

4802
03:53:48,640 --> 03:53:49,680
And three.

4803
03:53:50,760 --> 03:53:51,720
And two.

4804
03:53:54,980 --> 03:53:55,500
Three.

4805
03:53:55,860 --> 03:53:56,040
One.

4806
03:53:57,740 --> 03:53:58,780
And two.

4807
03:53:59,700 --> 03:54:00,100
Okay.

4808
03:54:00,620 --> 03:54:00,840
Okay.

4809
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:01,120
Okay.

4810
03:54:02,960 --> 03:54:04,340
I lost track of it.

4811
03:54:04,540 --> 03:54:05,120
Me eyes hurt.

4812
03:54:05,260 --> 03:54:05,880
We're almost there.

4813
03:54:06,680 --> 03:54:07,800
We just got...

4814
03:54:07,800 --> 03:54:09,460
We're so close to the finish line.

4815
03:54:10,140 --> 03:54:11,760
Don't give up on me now.

4816
03:54:13,440 --> 03:54:14,640
Okay, this is a two.

4817
03:54:17,440 --> 03:54:17,840
Somehow.

4818
03:54:18,440 --> 03:54:19,340
I'm not quite sure yet.

4819
03:54:32,730 --> 03:54:33,810
Rembrandt's Night Watch.

4820
03:54:35,550 --> 03:54:35,950
Oh.

4821
03:54:36,510 --> 03:54:38,030
I don't think that has been guessed.

4822
03:54:40,590 --> 03:54:42,010
I don't think that has been guessed.

4823
03:54:43,870 --> 03:54:45,950
Bottom blue line, you got a hint for the three.

4824
03:54:48,370 --> 03:54:48,950
Oh, yeah.

4825
03:54:49,230 --> 03:54:50,170
Well, no, I don't.

4826
03:54:50,170 --> 03:54:51,490
Because I can't...

4827
03:54:51,490 --> 03:54:52,030
Because it's...

4828
03:54:52,030 --> 03:54:52,750
It's six.

4829
03:54:53,110 --> 03:54:54,250
So it's like one, two, three.

4830
03:54:54,450 --> 03:54:55,130
Or one, two, three.

4831
03:54:55,290 --> 03:54:55,630
Like...

4832
03:54:55,630 --> 03:54:58,130
If it were five, I would be able to put something in the middle.

4833
03:54:59,030 --> 03:54:59,430
But...

4834
03:55:01,150 --> 03:55:01,830
I cannot.

4835
03:55:11,140 --> 03:55:11,440
Wait.

4836
03:55:11,620 --> 03:55:12,440
One, three...

4837
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:13,040
Oh, this one.

4838
03:55:17,680 --> 03:55:19,500
You can fill in the three and the ten.

4839
03:55:20,540 --> 03:55:20,880
Here?

4840
03:55:22,200 --> 03:55:22,760
Oh, yeah.

4841
03:55:22,820 --> 03:55:23,140
You're right.

4842
03:55:25,380 --> 03:55:26,200
Thank you, guys.

4843
03:55:26,740 --> 03:55:27,240
Thank you.

4844
03:55:27,320 --> 03:55:27,700
Thank you.

4845
03:55:28,440 --> 03:55:28,780
Okay.

4846
03:55:30,280 --> 03:55:31,800
Yes, yes, yes.

4847
03:55:33,540 --> 03:55:34,620
Let's see.

4848
03:55:35,120 --> 03:55:35,640
Two.

4849
03:55:36,080 --> 03:55:36,560
Two.

4850
03:55:38,840 --> 03:55:40,280
This could be two.

4851
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:50,360
Two,

4852
03:56:01,710 --> 03:56:03,030
two, two.

4853
03:56:04,730 --> 03:56:05,570
Come on, come on.

4854
03:56:08,670 --> 03:56:12,130
And then this... goes like that.

4855
03:56:12,530 --> 03:56:15,650
And then this... like that.

4856
03:56:18,190 --> 03:56:19,610
Ah, my eyes.

4857
03:56:21,690 --> 03:56:23,050
Holy cannoli.

4858
03:56:23,270 --> 03:56:23,830
Oh, and then like that.

4859
03:56:25,230 --> 03:56:25,710
Okay.

4860
03:56:26,010 --> 03:56:26,650
Okay, okay.

4861
03:56:35,200 --> 03:56:36,720
We can get this three.

4862
03:56:37,960 --> 03:56:39,980
Which means we can get this one.

4863
03:56:49,510 --> 03:56:50,830
Then we can get rid of this.

4864
03:56:51,530 --> 03:56:52,770
So we can put this down.

4865
03:56:53,950 --> 03:56:54,790
One, two, three, four.

4866
03:56:56,670 --> 03:56:57,410
Like that.

4867
03:56:58,970 --> 03:56:59,410
Five.

4868
03:57:00,730 --> 03:57:01,170
This.

4869
03:57:02,030 --> 03:57:02,330
One.

4870
03:57:04,970 --> 03:57:05,670
Like that.

4871
03:57:08,990 --> 03:57:11,210
I can't tell what the right side is at all.

4872
03:57:11,450 --> 03:57:12,830
I mean, we still have a lot to go.

4873
03:57:14,270 --> 03:57:15,710
I don't want to say that.

4874
03:57:15,990 --> 03:57:16,790
I'm in denial.

4875
03:57:18,490 --> 03:57:19,290
I'm in denial.

4876
03:57:28,680 --> 03:57:30,200
Okay, this is the two.

4877
03:57:31,020 --> 03:57:32,440
Which means we can do that.

4878
03:57:32,560 --> 03:57:34,220
Which means we can put in the three.

4879
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:35,960
Which means this is the two.

4880
03:57:36,320 --> 03:57:37,620
Which means two.

4881
03:57:39,340 --> 03:57:42,180
And another column or row down.

4882
03:57:42,880 --> 03:57:43,220
Okay.

4883
03:57:45,020 --> 03:57:46,660
It's a creature.

4884
03:57:46,660 --> 03:57:47,700
Whatever it is.

4885
03:57:49,400 --> 03:57:51,220
It's some sort of creature.

4886
03:57:54,080 --> 03:57:55,740
Okay, we just need the three there.

4887
03:57:57,700 --> 03:57:59,160
And we can get...

4888
03:58:02,140 --> 03:58:03,260
One of the twos.

4889
03:58:03,820 --> 03:58:04,860
Well, this might not...

4890
03:58:04,860 --> 03:58:05,680
This might be a two.

4891
03:58:05,780 --> 03:58:06,480
It might be a one.

4892
03:58:06,480 --> 03:58:07,940
Because we still have this open as well.

4893
03:58:09,240 --> 03:58:10,600
Which is why we don't touch it.

4894
03:58:11,200 --> 03:58:12,140
But this is a two.

4895
03:58:14,280 --> 03:58:14,640
Yes.

4896
03:58:17,140 --> 03:58:18,120
Yes, yes, yes.

4897
03:58:18,420 --> 03:58:19,820
And then there's...

4898
03:58:19,820 --> 03:58:20,440
Two.

4899
03:58:20,800 --> 03:58:21,080
Okay.

4900
03:58:23,460 --> 03:58:24,580
Famous painting.

4901
03:58:24,800 --> 03:58:26,180
Dude in hat with creature.

4902
03:58:26,840 --> 03:58:28,880
Oh, I saw that at the Louvre.

4903
03:58:31,380 --> 03:58:32,500
True story.

4904
03:58:38,140 --> 03:58:39,580
Real, real story.

4905
03:58:43,030 --> 03:58:44,810
This one is so evil.

4906
03:58:45,110 --> 03:58:47,550
Why does it have to be exactly four and exactly seven?

4907
03:58:47,710 --> 03:58:50,090
And then also exactly four right here.

4908
03:58:50,290 --> 03:58:51,630
How am I supposed to know?

4909
03:58:51,910 --> 03:58:53,550
How am I supposed to know?

4910
03:58:56,010 --> 03:58:56,530
Like...

4911
03:58:57,050 --> 03:58:57,570
Like...

4912
03:58:58,810 --> 03:59:00,110
It's so evil.

4913
03:59:07,400 --> 03:59:07,920
Absolutely...

4914
03:59:07,920 --> 03:59:08,340
Diverse.

4915
03:59:09,480 --> 03:59:09,900
Huh.

4916
03:59:26,120 --> 03:59:28,420
Just let me know when this BGM gets annoying too.

4917
03:59:28,540 --> 03:59:29,200
But it should be okay.

4918
03:59:29,660 --> 03:59:30,480
I don't think we have...

4919
03:59:30,480 --> 03:59:31,880
We don't have so much longer.

4920
03:59:35,000 --> 03:59:36,900
Honestly, this is just my normal...

4921
03:59:36,900 --> 03:59:38,640
Like, after stream routine.

4922
03:59:39,040 --> 03:59:39,460
So...

4923
03:59:39,460 --> 03:59:41,000
I would just be playing...

4924
03:59:42,020 --> 03:59:42,580
MeowTower...

4925
03:59:42,580 --> 03:59:43,420
Uh...

4926
03:59:44,160 --> 03:59:44,720
Nonograms...

4927
03:59:44,720 --> 03:59:45,980
After this anyway.

4928
03:59:46,300 --> 03:59:49,120
So it doesn't even feel like I'm streaming right now.

4929
03:59:54,480 --> 03:59:56,180
To me, I'm just...

4930
03:59:56,180 --> 03:59:57,860
I'm just so chill.

4931
04:00:02,400 --> 04:00:04,880
I'm so chill right now.

4932
04:00:05,060 --> 04:00:06,060
So chill.

4933
04:00:08,940 --> 04:00:10,680
I'm not even here.

4934
04:00:11,340 --> 04:00:12,300
Glad you're comfy.

4935
04:00:12,500 --> 04:00:12,780
Oh, yeah.

4936
04:00:12,780 --> 04:00:14,060
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4937
04:00:14,240 --> 04:00:15,140
I kind of got...

4938
04:00:15,140 --> 04:00:16,320
I kind of got...

4939
04:00:16,320 --> 04:00:18,260
TikTok shop influence.

4940
04:00:18,420 --> 04:00:21,040
But I didn't buy it off the TikTok shop.

4941
04:00:21,360 --> 04:00:22,000
Oh, shoot.

4942
04:00:22,260 --> 04:00:23,200
I think I had a meeting.

4943
04:00:23,400 --> 04:00:24,160
Are they yelling at me?

4944
04:00:26,580 --> 04:00:26,980
Oops.

4945
04:00:32,870 --> 04:00:33,270
Oops.

4946
04:00:35,770 --> 04:00:36,370
Oh, no.

4947
04:00:36,410 --> 04:00:37,850
I have it in 30 minutes.

4948
04:00:38,050 --> 04:00:38,210
Okay, good.

4949
04:00:46,660 --> 04:00:48,300
I got it wrong on the calendar.

4950
04:00:51,620 --> 04:00:52,020
Okay.

4951
04:00:52,520 --> 04:00:52,660
Okay.

4952
04:00:52,960 --> 04:00:53,200
Anyway.

4953
04:00:53,560 --> 04:00:54,880
Okay, I have 30 minutes to solve this.

4954
04:00:57,460 --> 04:00:58,640
We could solve in 30.

4955
04:00:59,020 --> 04:00:59,420
Probably.

4956
04:00:59,640 --> 04:00:59,820
Maybe.

4957
04:01:00,020 --> 04:01:00,260
Hopefully.

4958
04:01:01,120 --> 04:01:01,880
What was I saying?

4959
04:01:02,040 --> 04:01:02,160
Okay.

4960
04:01:02,380 --> 04:01:02,720
Uh...

4961
04:01:02,720 --> 04:01:03,660
I didn't even notice.

4962
04:01:03,900 --> 04:01:04,240
Nine.

4963
04:01:04,380 --> 04:01:04,760
I don't know.

4964
04:01:04,940 --> 04:01:05,700
We can do that.

4965
04:01:15,120 --> 04:01:16,540
I don't remember what I was saying, though.

4966
04:01:19,020 --> 04:01:19,820
I don't remember.

4967
04:01:20,160 --> 04:01:21,340
Oh, you bought something because of TikTok.

4968
04:01:21,540 --> 04:01:21,880
Thank you.

4969
04:01:22,340 --> 04:01:23,260
Um, I didn't...

4970
04:01:23,260 --> 04:01:23,680
I...

4971
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:24,880
Okay, so it's a chair.

4972
04:01:24,940 --> 04:01:29,200
So when I sit in my chair, I'm always like crisscross applesauce.

4973
04:01:29,220 --> 04:01:30,620
Or I'm sitting on my knees.

4974
04:01:30,720 --> 04:01:31,340
Or I'm like...

4975
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:32,660
I'm all over the place.

4976
04:01:32,800 --> 04:01:36,060
And I found a chair that's made for that.

4977
04:01:36,960 --> 04:01:37,400
And...

4978
04:01:37,880 --> 04:01:38,320
I...

4979
04:01:38,320 --> 04:01:39,300
I've got it.

4980
04:01:39,440 --> 04:01:41,360
I'm gonna see if I like it.

4981
04:01:41,820 --> 04:01:42,260
Hopefully.

4982
04:01:43,000 --> 04:01:43,440
Hopefully.

4983
04:01:44,620 --> 04:01:46,460
Otherwise, I just return it, but...

4984
04:01:46,460 --> 04:01:47,020
Yattel.

4985
04:01:47,420 --> 04:01:47,860
Yattel.

4986
04:01:48,580 --> 04:01:49,380
Mm-hmm.

4987
04:01:49,380 --> 04:01:51,300
But I was like...

4988
04:01:51,300 --> 04:01:51,380
Dang.

4989
04:01:51,860 --> 04:01:53,440
This is like made for me.

4990
04:01:59,420 --> 04:02:00,720
You got influenced.

4991
04:02:00,720 --> 04:02:01,560
I did.

4992
04:02:03,720 --> 04:02:04,280
Hopefully...

4993
04:02:04,280 --> 04:02:05,760
Hopefully it works well.

4994
04:02:11,000 --> 04:02:13,560
Try not to give exact answers, please.

4995
04:02:14,440 --> 04:02:15,080
Thank you.

4996
04:02:15,160 --> 04:02:16,560
I know you're just trying to help.

4997
04:02:16,560 --> 04:02:18,680
But I also want to solve it myself.

4998
04:02:20,300 --> 04:02:21,100
But thank you.

4999
04:02:21,220 --> 04:02:21,680
Thank you.

5000
04:02:45,450 --> 04:02:46,330
Oh, shoot.

5001
04:02:46,490 --> 04:02:48,030
We don't know if it's a one or the two.

5002
04:02:48,810 --> 04:02:50,130
Oh, my golly.

5003
04:02:50,870 --> 04:02:51,090
Okay.

5004
04:02:53,550 --> 04:02:54,390
But this is...

5005
04:02:54,390 --> 04:02:55,870
Got to be the two.

5006
04:02:56,130 --> 04:02:56,730
The one's here.

5007
04:02:56,850 --> 04:02:57,530
The two's here.

5008
04:03:00,330 --> 04:03:01,170
One...

5009
04:03:01,170 --> 04:03:02,610
One...

5010
04:03:04,050 --> 04:03:04,890
One...

5011
04:03:11,150 --> 04:03:12,590
Is that six?

5012
04:03:13,030 --> 04:03:13,650
Yes.

5013
04:03:14,490 --> 04:03:15,790
Do I deceive?

5014
04:03:16,150 --> 04:03:17,630
I probably would deceive...

5015
04:03:17,630 --> 04:03:19,810
After so long of staring at this.

5016
04:03:21,330 --> 04:03:22,170
Two...

5017
04:03:22,170 --> 04:03:22,590
Two...

5018
04:03:23,470 --> 04:03:23,890
One...

5019
04:03:24,470 --> 04:03:24,890
Two.

5020
04:03:25,830 --> 04:03:26,450
Okay, I'm checking.

5021
04:03:30,330 --> 04:03:31,790
No mistakes found.

5022
04:03:33,310 --> 04:03:34,970
And whatever the heck...

5023
04:03:34,970 --> 04:03:36,410
I still can't tell what it is at all.

5024
04:03:36,650 --> 04:03:37,670
I guess I...

5025
04:03:37,670 --> 04:03:39,370
Just don't know what the painting is.

5026
04:03:39,890 --> 04:03:40,350
There's...

5027
04:03:40,350 --> 04:03:40,590
I...

5028
04:03:40,590 --> 04:03:43,010
I feel like I just don't know what it is.

5029
04:03:46,600 --> 04:03:47,560
Okay, here.

5030
04:03:51,530 --> 04:03:52,590
This is eight, right?

5031
04:03:52,810 --> 04:03:53,290
Yes, okay.

5032
04:03:57,750 --> 04:03:59,170
Ten in the bottom right.

5033
04:03:59,410 --> 04:03:59,670
Wake.

5034
04:04:03,050 --> 04:04:04,970
Is that the dude's hand?

5035
04:04:05,210 --> 04:04:06,490
I can't tell.

5036
04:04:06,770 --> 04:04:11,490
It's going to be insane once we actually see what this actual painting is.

5037
04:04:12,250 --> 04:04:14,950
Because I can't tell at all what it is.

5038
04:04:19,070 --> 04:04:20,390
I can't tell.

5039
04:04:21,050 --> 04:04:22,370
It's a mystery.

5040
04:04:23,830 --> 04:04:24,770
One, two, three, four.

5041
04:04:27,370 --> 04:04:28,010
Three.

5042
04:04:28,770 --> 04:04:29,330
One.

5043
04:04:29,330 --> 04:04:29,970
One, one.

5044
04:04:30,910 --> 04:04:31,630
Yatta!

5045
04:04:32,810 --> 04:04:34,590
Yatta indeed, Raden.

5046
04:04:35,050 --> 04:04:36,210
Yatta indeed.

5047
04:04:39,090 --> 04:04:39,810
Raden.

5048
04:04:40,110 --> 04:04:41,270
How close are we?

5049
04:04:41,710 --> 04:04:43,710
How close is the finish line?

5050
04:04:44,210 --> 04:04:45,450
Please.なるほど.

5051
04:04:46,470 --> 04:04:47,190
Please.

5052
04:04:48,850 --> 04:04:52,050
Just tell me... Give me any sort of sign.

5053
04:04:58,290 --> 04:05:00,130
I think it's got to be like that.

5054
04:05:01,090 --> 04:05:01,470
I think...

5055
04:05:01,470 --> 04:05:01,890
Okay, hold on.

5056
04:05:01,930 --> 04:05:01,950
Sorry.

5057
04:05:01,950 --> 04:05:02,670
I'm sorry.

5058
04:05:02,930 --> 04:05:04,050
Okay, I was right.

5059
04:05:07,030 --> 04:05:10,890
I was just trying to make sure I don't need to backtrack, you know?

5060
04:05:14,490 --> 04:05:14,930
Okay.

5061
04:05:16,710 --> 04:05:17,530
So close.

5062
04:05:19,350 --> 04:05:19,730
Okay.

5063
04:05:20,630 --> 04:05:22,550
Just count how many white squares you got left.

5064
04:05:23,050 --> 04:05:23,430
Right?

5065
04:05:25,390 --> 04:05:26,690
Still don't know this one.

5066
04:05:32,540 --> 04:05:34,160
The end is near.

5067
04:05:38,710 --> 04:05:40,130
The end is near.

5068
04:05:44,250 --> 04:05:44,850
Yeah.

5069
04:05:45,070 --> 04:05:46,230
I can't count anymore.

5070
04:05:46,770 --> 04:05:48,290
I've lost all...

5071
04:05:48,290 --> 04:05:49,750
all functions.

5072
04:05:54,850 --> 04:05:56,270
I've lost everything.

5073
04:05:58,090 --> 04:05:58,990
Wait, two.

5074
04:06:11,600 --> 04:06:13,460
Wait, I was looking at the wrong column.

5075
04:06:13,660 --> 04:06:14,100
Oh my gosh.

5076
04:06:14,100 --> 04:06:16,960
I've done that so many times before though.

5077
04:06:17,100 --> 04:06:22,120
Where I'm looking at the wrong column and I accidentally put some...

5078
04:06:22,120 --> 04:06:24,460
Luckily, they have, like, the...

5079
04:06:24,460 --> 04:06:27,160
It's much more manageable here.

5080
04:06:28,720 --> 04:06:31,180
But it's still tricky sometimes.

5081
04:06:42,100 --> 04:06:43,200
We're almost there!

5082
04:06:43,620 --> 04:06:44,640
We're almost there.

5083
04:06:56,020 --> 04:06:56,660
Yes.

5084
04:06:58,020 --> 04:06:59,140
Eat it!

5085
04:07:00,220 --> 04:07:00,880
Okay.

5086
04:07:04,720 --> 04:07:05,900
Wait, is that five?

5087
04:07:06,060 --> 04:07:06,820
One, two, one.

5088
04:07:07,660 --> 04:07:08,600
Can't count.

5089
04:07:08,960 --> 04:07:09,200
Yes.

5090
04:07:10,320 --> 04:07:10,980
Okay.

5091
04:07:12,980 --> 04:07:14,440
What is it?

5092
04:07:14,780 --> 04:07:15,620
Is it his hand?

5093
04:07:15,800 --> 04:07:17,800
Oh, like, his arm extending out?

5094
04:07:20,320 --> 04:07:20,980
Creepy.

5095
04:07:31,880 --> 04:07:33,600
Three, one, three...

5096
04:07:36,820 --> 04:07:37,260
Four...

5097
04:07:38,580 --> 04:07:39,220
So bright.

5098
04:07:46,940 --> 04:07:47,640
Unlock them.

5099
04:07:50,380 --> 04:07:52,000
Wait, did I just mess that up?

5100
04:07:52,420 --> 04:07:52,960
I can't tell.

5101
04:07:53,780 --> 04:07:54,120
I can't tell.

5102
04:07:54,320 --> 04:07:56,680
I can't

5103
04:08:00,070 --> 04:08:00,070
tell.

5104
04:08:01,310 --> 04:08:02,030
Oh, wait.

5105
04:08:02,190 --> 04:08:04,590
Maybe it's a girl looking at him.

5106
04:08:04,730 --> 04:08:05,610
Like, this is the hair.

5107
04:08:05,610 --> 04:08:07,210
And this is her hat.

5108
04:08:07,510 --> 04:08:09,210
And, like, she's got, like, a...

5109
04:08:09,210 --> 04:08:11,170
Scarf looking thing on here.

5110
04:08:11,670 --> 04:08:12,150
She's like...

5111
04:08:12,150 --> 04:08:13,530
It looks like she's looking at him.

5112
04:08:16,630 --> 04:08:17,670
I think...

5113
04:08:19,690 --> 04:08:20,730
I think...

5114
04:08:22,230 --> 04:08:23,090
I think...

5115
04:08:23,090 --> 04:08:24,190
I think, I think, I think, I think...

5116
04:08:25,530 --> 04:08:26,790
I had a thought.

5117
04:08:31,030 --> 04:08:31,670
Music.

5118
04:08:48,510 --> 04:08:49,150
Maybe...

5119
04:08:50,070 --> 04:08:50,910
Wait, is this ten?

5120
04:08:51,670 --> 04:08:52,030
Yes.

5121
04:08:54,650 --> 04:08:55,930
So, two...

5122
04:08:59,250 --> 04:09:01,690
Hey, I just finished another road, Raden.

5123
04:09:01,690 --> 04:09:04,050
Please, tell me... that you're proud of me.

5124
04:09:04,330 --> 04:09:05,830
Tell me that you're proud of me, please.

5125
04:09:09,590 --> 04:09:10,550
Oh, wait.

5126
04:09:10,630 --> 04:09:11,490
We can finish this row, too.

5127
04:09:16,950 --> 04:09:17,930
Are you good on time?

5128
04:09:18,050 --> 04:09:18,170
Yep.

5129
04:09:20,770 --> 04:09:24,470
I'm genuinely worried about some of your viewers' ability to absorb visual information.

5130
04:09:28,470 --> 04:09:29,430
They say...

5131
04:09:29,430 --> 04:09:31,090
Like stream or like chat.

5132
04:09:33,450 --> 04:09:35,550
Or chat reflects the stream.

5133
04:09:36,970 --> 04:09:38,370
What are you trying to say, huh?

5134
04:09:42,990 --> 04:09:43,910
What are we...

5135
04:09:43,910 --> 04:09:45,170
What are we trying to say here?

5136
04:09:47,890 --> 04:09:49,330
I like how it...

5137
04:09:49,330 --> 04:09:51,090
Kind of shows you...

5138
04:09:51,090 --> 04:09:53,550
What ones that you still need to fill out.

5139
04:09:53,770 --> 04:09:54,630
But like...

5140
04:09:54,630 --> 04:09:55,210
I don't know.

5141
04:09:55,330 --> 04:09:57,310
This system is very intuitive.

5142
04:09:57,670 --> 04:09:58,590
It's really nice.

5143
04:09:58,830 --> 04:09:59,450
Five, six.

5144
04:10:06,800 --> 04:10:07,500
Like see?

5145
04:10:07,700 --> 04:10:10,040
It shows here that I've filled out the other things.

5146
04:10:10,200 --> 04:10:11,360
But I still need to do the two.

5147
04:10:12,320 --> 04:10:12,800
You know?

5148
04:10:12,960 --> 04:10:13,360
Like that.

5149
04:10:13,580 --> 04:10:14,420
It's really nice.

5150
04:10:14,880 --> 04:10:15,940
So then if I do this...

5151
04:10:15,940 --> 04:10:17,500
I've already filled out the other stuff.

5152
04:10:17,660 --> 04:10:18,340
I just have to...

5153
04:10:18,960 --> 04:10:19,900
Do like that.

5154
04:10:20,500 --> 04:10:21,340
It's kind of nice.

5155
04:10:32,250 --> 04:10:33,230
What else we got?

5156
04:10:41,690 --> 04:10:43,050
Guys, the end is near.

5157
04:10:47,430 --> 04:10:48,490
What am I missing?

5158
04:10:48,930 --> 04:10:49,170
Oh, here.

5159
04:10:49,870 --> 04:10:50,430
Is this it?

5160
04:10:53,850 --> 04:10:55,190
Is this the last one?

5161
04:11:07,070 --> 04:11:09,450
Whoever guessed the night watch?

5162
04:11:10,150 --> 04:11:11,410
You got it.

5163
04:11:14,430 --> 04:11:15,070
What?

5164
04:11:15,070 --> 04:11:15,190
What?

5165
04:11:15,710 --> 04:11:15,850
What?

5166
04:11:17,950 --> 04:11:18,710
I

5167
04:11:22,290 --> 04:11:24,410
thought it was a cow of mine.

5168
04:11:25,010 --> 04:11:25,550
I thought it was a cow of mine.

5169
04:11:26,490 --> 04:11:29,010
Oh, Rembrandt.

5170
04:11:37,590 --> 04:11:38,990
Wow...

5171
04:11:38,990 --> 04:11:39,250
Wow!

5172
04:11:39,570 --> 04:11:39,690
Wow...

5173
04:11:39,690 --> 04:11:41,610
Wow...

5174
04:11:44,890 --> 04:11:46,290
Wow...

5175
04:11:57,590 --> 04:11:58,990
Wow...

5176
04:12:00,670 --> 04:12:02,990
This is the second one.

5177
04:12:04,050 --> 04:12:05,390
Thank you!

5178
04:12:06,130 --> 04:12:06,930
Thank you!

5179
04:12:11,950 --> 04:12:15,510
This is the first sentence.

5180
04:12:16,270 --> 04:12:18,950
This is called Rembrandt Lighting.

5181
04:12:19,210 --> 04:12:25,510
It is used to be used to play and play, and it is used to be used to play.

5182
04:12:30,430 --> 04:12:31,270
Oh...

5183
04:12:35,270 --> 04:12:36,110
Oh...

5184
04:12:40,950 --> 04:12:43,270
I'm sub two hours, baby.

5185
04:12:50,590 --> 04:12:51,690
Oh my gosh.

5186
04:12:52,290 --> 04:12:53,070
Thank you so much.

5187
04:12:53,790 --> 04:12:56,690
It's cut off your name, not...

5188
04:12:58,110 --> 04:12:59,750
Thank you so much for the...

5189
04:12:59,750 --> 04:13:00,770
Thank you.

5190
04:13:05,090 --> 04:13:07,430
All right, so I'm finishing the night watch.

5191
04:13:07,610 --> 04:13:08,170
I'm disappointed.

5192
04:13:08,730 --> 04:13:11,770
To not see cowboys embracing each other, but...

5193
04:13:11,770 --> 04:13:13,830
I'm happy to see you beat it.

5194
04:13:14,010 --> 04:13:14,290
Yeah.

5195
04:13:15,970 --> 04:13:17,170
Oh my goodness.

5196
04:13:18,470 --> 04:13:22,450
Well, I did two more hours than I expected to.

5197
04:13:25,930 --> 04:13:27,350
For the stream.

5198
04:13:29,870 --> 04:13:31,350
One last puzzle.

5199
04:13:32,730 --> 04:13:34,530
Thank you so much for the...

5200
04:13:34,530 --> 04:13:36,370
Thank you so much for the...

5201
04:13:36,370 --> 04:13:37,630
For the...

5202
04:13:37,630 --> 04:13:38,130
Who's the one?

5203
04:13:39,410 --> 04:13:39,610
Huh.

5204
04:13:43,490 --> 04:13:44,090
Yes.

5205
04:13:45,390 --> 04:13:45,990
But...

5206
04:13:45,990 --> 04:13:46,610
Nice.

5207
04:13:47,450 --> 04:13:48,830
GG, everybody.

5208
04:13:49,070 --> 04:13:51,170
Thank you for the help with this last one.

5209
04:13:51,310 --> 04:13:52,370
And with the other ones as well.

5210
04:13:52,930 --> 04:13:53,250
We did...

5211
04:13:53,250 --> 04:13:54,930
We made a great team.

5212
04:13:55,910 --> 04:13:57,430
Be proud of yourselves.

5213
04:13:57,430 --> 04:13:58,810
We solved it together.

5214
04:14:00,350 --> 04:14:02,990
16 people crowdfunded the commission for it.

5215
04:14:02,990 --> 04:14:06,270
You could see an ultra-high zoom version online.

5216
04:14:08,210 --> 04:14:08,850
Commission?

5217
04:14:11,330 --> 04:14:14,830
Really like the fan game culture that sprung up around VTubers.

5218
04:14:15,070 --> 04:14:15,930
Me too.

5219
04:14:19,010 --> 04:14:20,170
Oh, okay.

5220
04:14:21,970 --> 04:14:23,650

Maybe if it's...

5228
04:14:32,810 --> 04:14:34,050
If it's five by five.
