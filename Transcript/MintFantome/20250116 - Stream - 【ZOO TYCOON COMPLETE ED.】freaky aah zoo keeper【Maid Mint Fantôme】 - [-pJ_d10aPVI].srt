1
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,860
Oh-ha-oh-oh-ah.

2
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,060
Ah-ah-ah.

3
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,460
Hello.

4
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,300
Ah.

5
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:53,080
Why does it feel like I have not... I mean I have streamed, but why does it feel like I have not streamed?

6
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,760
In a minute.

7
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,480
Well, I'm just embarrassed.

8
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,380
I'm just embarrassed.

9
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,760
I don't know why I'm hiding.

10
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,880
Hello everybody.

11
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,820
I sound better today.

12
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah, my voice is still not 100%.

13
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,700
It's still a little raspy.

14
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,040
But, uh, uh, yeah.

15
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,260
Just a little bit raspy.

16
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,040
Thanks for the five.

17
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,300
But I'm feeling so much better.

18
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,460
I still haven't taken my medicine for today.

19
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,320
Well, I took the first one this morning.

20
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:56,580
And after stream, I'm gonna take the other one, but I'm not gonna take it now because it makes my tummy hurt even more.

21
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,220
Hello, sicko.

22
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,060
Takanashi Kiara channel, hololive EN, hello.

23
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,340
I'm a sicko.

24
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,520
Hello, sicko.

25
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,280
What do you mean, in body or in mind?

26
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,560
Hey, Wawa.

27
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,720
That game you were playing today was whack.

28
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,800
Tika, thanks for the five gifted.

29
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,800
And Johnny, thanks for the five gifted.

30
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,920
I do sound less like a southern grandma.

31
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,160
Just a little bit of a southern grandma.

32
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,140
That game was so funny.

33
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
You're just going around punching everything.

34
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,180
Tis himself, thanks for the five gifted.

35
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,920
Yeah.

36
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,500
Oh, you're probably like, why isn't the game up?

37
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,120
I wanted to experience the intro and everything together.

38
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,540
Because it like throws me straight into the tutorial.

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,960
And I wanted to do, oh my gosh, all the gifted, thank you.

40
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,160
I wanted to do all the tutorial stuff together.

41
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,520
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted.

42
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,700
Spike, thanks for the 20 gifted.

43
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,660
I had like a single plot along the arm for it.

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,560
Hey, hey, hey.

45
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,660
This is not my office hours.

46
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Star Creator, thanks for the 10 gifted.

47
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
I used to play this game with my aunt on our old PC.

48
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,340
It brings back memories, this and Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.

49
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
Yeah, I used to play this game all the time.

50
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,200
I used to play this game.

51
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,140
I used to play Rollercoaster Tycoon.

52
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:37,780
You know, like this, the Rollercoaster Tycoon, the Sims, the trifecta of simulation games back in the day.

53
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,280
Logan, thank you for the five.

54
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,560
Dark Disciple, thanks for the super chat.

55
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,280
Invisible Moose, thanks for the 10 gifted.

56
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,700
Here's my proposal.

57
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,840
What are we talking about?

58
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Shoulder frills toggle doko?

59
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,700
Stop!

60
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,020
I feel, I feel, I feel so naked.

61
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,820
Don't take off my frills.

62
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,780
I, oh my gosh.

63
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,960
I feel like, I feel like I can't, I can't show you guys everything.

64
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:16,120
Because then when I get like, when I do get a new outfit and if it maybe like shows my shoulders or whatever, whatever.

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,540
Then you guys will be like, I already saw that.

66
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,860
I already saw, what's next?

67
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,780
Come on, catch up, catch up Mint Frentom.

68
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,340
We're on the next thing now.

69
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,300
So I'm like, I can't, I can't show you guys everything.

70
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,160
I have to save stuff for, for the future.

71
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,760
Whenever it happens, if it ever happens, I don't know.

72
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,660
I don't know.

73
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,180
Maybe I'll just never get a outfit that shows off my shoulders now because you guys have just seen everything apparently.

74
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:02,280
But quite honestly, even if I wanted to show my shoulders on stream, the rigging was not quite made for, for that.

75
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:10,360
So there were little things that I had to like, that I had to like erase out to post on Twitter.

76
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,020
If you saw the pictures on Twitter.

77
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,420
Because the rigging is like, oh yeah, we're made to, so you can see the frills.

78
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,260
But you guys think the frills are so cute, right?

79
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,560
So you want them all the time.

80
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,380
A sunset is beautiful no matter how many times you witness it.

81
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,760
Tuna.

82
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,460
Secret tuna riz.

83
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Okay.

84
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,700
Gosh.

85
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,900
I heard that there was an all you can eat buffet at the cafe tonight.

86
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

87
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,530
I mostly have a cough really only when I talk, which is like so counterproductive.

88
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,510
For stream, but overall, I'm feeling like 80%.

89
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,690
I'm feeling so much better.

90
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,510
My nose is not completely stopped anymore.

91
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,650
I feel so good.

92
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,970
The medicine has been helping so much.

93
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,470
Who would have thunk, right?

94
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,070
Koiki... Koi... Koi... Koiyuki, sorry.

95
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,990
Thanks for the gifted.

96
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,110
Thank you for the superchat.

97
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,450
Are there still empty plots available?

98
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,370
Also, dark noodles!

99
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,870
Alright, I'll sing you happy birthday and then we'll start the game.

100
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,790
Happy birthday to you.

101
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,750
Happy birthday to you.

102
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,510
Happy birthday, dark noodles.

103
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,930
Happy birthday to you.

104
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,930
Happy birthday!

105
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,410
The freaky ghost man has given me new knowledge.

106
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,590
I was playing a Miku song in Fortnite and noticed the otake going on in the background.

107
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,090
Something I wouldn't have noticed without you nerding out.

108
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,450
Yeah!

109
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,690
Oh my gosh.

110
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,930
Me, all day, has been...

111
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,570
Okay, hold on.

112
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,110
First of all, I was like, I want Miku skin in Fortnite.

113
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,430
But honestly, I don't see myself ever using it.

114
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,710
Because I have Snake in Fortnite.

115
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,750
I don't think I'll ever change from him.

116
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,250
I don't think I'll ever stop using Snake.

117
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,130
But me, all day, I've just been being like...

118
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,690
When did we start using that song instead of...

119
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,270
But I like this one.

120
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,910
I think I might like it better than...

121
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,270
Even though it's a classic.

122
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,510
I'm thinking Miku, Miku.

123
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,870
It's so catchy!

124
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,230
Hold on.

125
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,070
That wasn't...

126
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,110
That wasn't sick cough.

127
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,510
That was me getting something stuck in my throat cough.

128
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,710
Boomer?

129
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,690
Maybe.

130
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,150
The frills are cute, but the person wearing it is cuter.

131
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,550
Chicken!

132
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,310
I wanted to post one of the...

133
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,910
Shaki keeps sending me stupid edits of my 3D model.

134
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,390
They're so funny.

135
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,870
When you and Kiara get married, will you take her color and become made mango?

136
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,270
What do you mean mango?

137
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,230
I think Kiara and I's colors already compliment each other.

138
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,230
Kiara has mint in her hair.

139
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,730
You know?

140
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,630
I mean, it's my birthday.

141
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,650
I just wanted to say thank you for making the past year so great.

142
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,130
I hope next year's gonna be even better.

143
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,910
Thanks PON!

144
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,630
Happy birthday!

145
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,690
Okay, now I sing you happy birthday.

146
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,130
And now we start the game.

147
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:08,650
Okay?

148
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,490
Oh my gosh.

149
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,150
I'm thinking Minto, Minto.

150
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,290
Synapse, I ain't giving you the super chat.

151
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,310
Okay.

152
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,590
Happy birthday to you.

153
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,050
Happy birthday to you.

154
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,570
Happy birthday dear PON.

155
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,450
Happy birthday to you.

156
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,730
Happy birthday!

157
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,550
Alright, let's start up the game.

158
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,210
It might be a little loud at the beginning.

159
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,310
I think it's okay.

160
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,910
Let's go.

161
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,590
Microsoft Game Studios.

162
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,870
Blue fan.

163
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,310
These are so epic.

164
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,810
Wow!

165
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,530
Thank you for the 20 dollars.

166
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,130
Oh, it didn't throw me into the tutorial.

167
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,870
Oh my gosh.

168
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,850
It's so nostalgic.

169
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,130
It's so nostalgic.

170
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,720
Turn it down just a bit.

171
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,240
It

172
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,730
would be cool if you called your zoo Japari Park and fill it with servals.

173
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,910
But I don't think the game has any servals.

174
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,170
No!

175
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,590
Japari Park has so many different kinds of animals.

176
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,550
Frozen frog, thanks for 10 months.

177
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,570
10 months, sorry.

178
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,550
10 gifted!

179
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,150
We have to zoo keep Minto.

180
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,570
Why are we zoo keeping Minto?

181
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,250
Game franchise is 24 years old.

182
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,950
Apparently there is a new one, but it kind of sucks.

183
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,530
There's like one on Steam.

184
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,510
But the ratings, the reviews for it are not good.

185
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,050
Because it's not like this game where you get to build the enclosures and everything.

186
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,970
In that one, you are just like a zoo keeper.

187
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,390
And you like go and you like, you know, clean the animals.

188
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,130
It's like actual zoo keeper sim.

189
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,070
But this one is original zoo tycoon.

190
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,750
You will build the zoo and then free the animals and have them eat the people.

191
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,210
You can't kill people in the new one.

192
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,630
What's the point?

193
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,470
POV, you just got out of school and winding down.

194
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,690
Ma'am, let me just build my zoo and then I'll do my homework after.

195
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,630
Okay, ma'am?

196
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,030
Okay, let's do the tutorial because it's been a long time since I've played this game.

197
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,650
Oh, wait.

198
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,050
How many tutorials are there?

199
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,410
Very advanced.

200
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,090
Okay, hold on.

201
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,950
Let's just do...

202
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,810
Okay, hold on.

203
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,330
Okay, hold on.

204
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,950
Maybe we do...

205
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,790
They are like, you will become a zoo.

206
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,310
Oh, wait.

207
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,170
I can move the window.

208
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:47,830
Oh my gosh.

209
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,550
It was stuck in the corner for a bit.

210
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,130
Oh, thank goodness.

211
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,650
They are like, you will become a zoo tycoon master.

212
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,570
Great.

213
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,770
Welcome to Mabu's show.

214
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,390
Can you play super solvers, gizmos, and gadgets in the future?

215
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,410
I don't think I'm going to remember that.

216
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,910
I can't stop saying Minky.

217
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,930
I feel like I should have like a...

218
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,910
I've thought about doing like a Google Doc thing where people can submit game suggestions.

219
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,850
But I'm afraid it will become abused.

220
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,090
And become used like a marshmallow or something.

221
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,740
Thank you so much for the 5 dollars.

222
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,180
Makes me so happy to see my favorite little ghosty playing my child's favorite game.

223
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
Thank you.

224
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,140
This is the first game I ever remember modding.

225
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,800
No, wait.

226
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,440
What did you mod on Eskeleton?

227
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,790
Maybe that would be good.

228
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,770
To have like just a...

229
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,630
Oh my god, this song is already driving me crazy.

230
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,870
To have like a pinned community post.

231
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,350
Nameless, welcome to Mabu's show.

232
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,150
You can add new animals and buildings in the future.

233
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,850
McDonald's mod!

234
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,230
Okay, let's see.

235
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,410
Let's do the first tutorial.

236
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,530
Wow!

237
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,210
Oh, welcome to Zoo Tycoon.

238
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,610
We'll be playing soon.

239
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,910
But first, this brief introductory tutorial will teach you some of the important game controls of Zoo Tycoon.

240
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,930
When you play this tutorial, you will see a reminder text display in the upper section of the gameplay area.

241
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,770
Click this reminder panel to revisit the current tutorial's instructions.

242
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,690
First thing to learn is the game options tab.

243
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,030
Here.

244
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,230
Select a game.

245
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,170
Oh, look at him!

246
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,190
Wait, how do I zoom in?

247
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,210
Can I?

248
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,570
How do I zoom in?

249
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,170
I want to zoom in.

250
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,610
Oh, it won't let me yet.

251
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,370
Oh my gosh, all these little assets are so familiar.

252
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,530
Oh my god.

253
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,050
And I want to name all of our animals.

254
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,110
Like this one will be Minky.

255
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,930
Nine months.

256
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,950
Wow, wow, wow.

257
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,350
It takes knee socks.

258
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,630
Knee socks.

259
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,890
Woods of woods of woods.

260
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,110
Just signed a mortgage.

261
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,790
Woo, debt.

262
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:24,890
Fancy.

263
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,710
Congratulations, McMack.

264
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,010
Another... oh.

265
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,910
He's always wanted a brother.

266
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,970
Oh no, I'm blocking some of it.

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,630
Hold on.

268
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,930
Actually, okay, I never do this, but I'm going to have the game block me.

269
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,770
I never do this.

270
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,950
I never have the game block me.

271
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,430
But I shall.

272
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Like so.

273
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm thinking Minko, Minko.

274
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,200
Sorry.

275
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,980
Where we were.

276
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,660
There, where did that keyboard used?

277
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,660
Sounded so good, I just had to get it.

278
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,960
Oh my gosh, I hope you like it.

279
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,060
My only issue with it is it doesn't have a...

280
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,000
It doesn't have a print screen button.

281
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,400
So I had to write on a sticky note how to screenshot with the Windows Shift S.

282
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,020
A brother.

283
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,820
I always wanted a brother.

284
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,780
Wow, this place is kind of packed.

285
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,180
Why can't I move around?

286
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,540
Okay, let's just do the tutorial.

287
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,560
Let's view the Zoo Tycoon game world.

288
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,840
First, you can scroll the game map by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen.

289
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,080
Like so.

290
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,640
Oh my god, we have actual Minkis.

291
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,780
He's hungry.

292
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,420
I'm hungry.

293
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,160
Wow, Minky.

294
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,440
Minky.

295
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,520
Actual Minky.

296
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,240
Minky won.

297
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,460
They're not very happy.

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,820
This zoo sucks.

299
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
What about the giraffes?

300
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,540
Oh, that guy is living his best life ever.

301
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,140
He's single though.

302
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,200
Are we sure he's happy?

303
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,020
Click on the zoom out button.

304
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,280
Nice, this is a tiny zoo.

305
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,420
Tiny, tiny zoo.

306
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,540
Rotating the game would allow you to see animals and buildings that might not be visible from the current view.

307
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,680
Although it was hard to see, there's a trash can behind the statue.

308
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,740
Okay, rotate.

309
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,420
Oh my god!

310
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
There really is a trash can.

311
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,040
How do I... okay.

312
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,460
Is this the only way to move?

313
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,680
I can't like drag around?

314
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,560
Kind of sucks.

315
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,620
Because it's like... it's kind of finicky.

316
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,520
Oh, there we go.

317
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,280
Okay.

318
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,900
How do... oh my god.

319
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,960
There it is!

320
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,340
It's a single giraffe.

321
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,960
He's not bothered by anybody.

322
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,800
He's not held back by...

323
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,700
Wait, where did he go?

324
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,940
Minky is not happy!

325
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,760
Oh my... I'm hungry!

326
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
All my monkeys are so...

327
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,980
Oh my god.

328
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
Wait, I thought we named chimpanzee to Minky.

329
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,080
Minky.

330
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,920
Minky.

331
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,900
Oh my god, all the chimpanzees are going...

332
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,320
What's wrong?

333
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,740
They're like freaking out.

334
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,520
Oh, I can move with arrow keys.

335
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,100
That's nice.

336
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,040
Yeah, this guy, he's like...

337
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,660
Hell yeah!

338
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,240
Oh, whoa!

339
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,320
Whoa, he's running!

340
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,100
Okay, I need to stop.

341
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,560
We're not even playing the game yet.

342
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,940
We're not even in the game yet and I'm already having a good time.

343
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,640
Okay.

344
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,640
Except the minkies are not having a good time.

345
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,500
Look at them!

346
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,780
Revolt!

347
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:23,980
Revolt!

348
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,500
Revolution!

349
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,760
Why aren't they happy?

350
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,680
They're gonna revolt like Planet of the Apes.

351
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:34,960
Yeah!

352
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,740
Maybe it's because there's so many.

353
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,500
Oh my god, they're really not happy.

354
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,200
Damn, I can't move them outside.

355
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,240
They hate him!

356
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,230
Oh my god, shut up!

357
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,890
Minky is not happy.

358
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,050
Okay, I'm rotating.

359
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,990
Okay, there we go.

360
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,610
Click the pause button.

361
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:05,890
Nice.

362
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,510
We can pause to get our bearings.

363
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,810
I'm just gonna sell this guy off.

364
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,770
I'm just gonna sell him.

365
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,110
Oh, we get a nice refund.

366
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,110
Damn, we're making good money.

367
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,250
Okay.

368
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,130
Another very useful is the undo previous action.

369
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,970
Oh, that's kinda nice.

370
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,730
Oh no!

371
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,830
I got infected!

372
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,520
We are the monkeys and she's the zookeeper.

373
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,500
Then you would be the ultimate happy, would you not?

374
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,840
Finally, let's learn how to remove or clear objects from the zoo.

375
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,120
Oh, let's bulldoze?

376
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,680
Okay, yeah.

377
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,720
Wait, how do I bulldoze?

378
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,640
Oh, it makes me wanna build...

379
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
Okay, it's like...

380
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,280
It's like you should build this and then delete it.

381
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,280
No, everybody, you can't be...

382
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,540
You...

383
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,620
You're not allowed to be a fool.

384
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,400
You must be hungry in my park.

385
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,480
And then undo.

386
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,620
Delete...

387
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,740
Oh, a section of the fence from the lion exhibit!

388
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,160
Oh my god.

389
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,240
Be free.

390
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,460
Be free!

391
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,540
Yeah!

392
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,360
Yeah!

393
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,500
Oh my god!

394
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,020
Good grief, you've allowed the lions to run free in the zoo.

395
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,000
What were you thinking?

396
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,160
Well, we hope you learned your lesson.

397
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,080
Never trust the people who write these tutorials.

398
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,720
Never clear sections of fence in the lion's exhibit.

399
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,980
Unless you like seeing your guests flee in terror.

400
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,200
Okay.

401
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,100
Let's do the next tutorial.

402
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,940
Oh my gosh, camels!

403
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,880
Alright, basic gameplay.

404
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,860
Main menu.

405
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,700
First task is to build an exhibit.

406
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
Okay, we can do this.

407
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,700
It's gonna be huge.

408
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,560
It's gonna be ginormous.

409
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,400
Biggest exhibit ever.

410
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,860
Okay, guys?

411
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,040
It's gonna house the ultimate animal.

412
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh.

413
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,880
Oh.

414
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,820
Did I?

415
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,620
Oh, I already put it.

416
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,440
Okay.

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,300
Up against the fence.

418
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,440
It's like crazy.

419
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,400
You can see... you can be like two feet away from these animals.

420
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,220
It's just gonna take up the whole park.

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,980
What the hell is that?

422
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,460
Oh, the giraffes.

423
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:34,940
They're fighting.

424
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,320
Oh, we're making a Bengal tiger!

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,960
A mouse.

426
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,180
Yeah, we'll put a mouse in there.

427
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,340
Oh yeah, and this is the full expansion.

428
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,620
Who's throwing up in my park?

429
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,560
Fucking nasty children!

430
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,900
Get out of here!

431
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,520
Earth coin!

432
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,600
Thank you for the 10 gift.

433
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,180
Thank you.

434
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,680
We're gonna...

435
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,180
We're gonna...

436
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,200
We're gonna...

437
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,440
Wait, so this is the complete collection.

438
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,700
So we do have a fish and we have dinosaurs.

439
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,900
So exciting, I know.

440
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,840
I wish this was an easier way to do this.

441
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,140
Oh, I wish I could like drag it, you know.

442
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,360
But one at a time, manually.

443
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,860
That's okay.

444
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,560
That's alright.

445
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,860
I'm patient.

446
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm a patient...

447
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm a patient kid.

448
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,960
Oh no!

449
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,320
No one tell her?

450
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,160
What do you mean?

451
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,620
I tried shift click.

452
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,400
That didn't work.

453
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,760
I thought there was click and drag.

454
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,320
Apparently not.

455
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,920
Mint one does not like the chat in its exhibit.

456
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,020
No!

457
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,900
What are you talking about?

458
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,960
You get placed in my exhibit and my happiness...

459
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,280
I'm just like sad faces.

460
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,440
Click and hold.

461
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I tried that!

462
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm holding right now.

463
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm holding right now.

464
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,640
It doesn't work.

465
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,480
Maybe I need to get to that part of the tutorial.

466
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,360
I don't know.

467
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,820
Tiger.

468
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Okay.

469
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,280
Oh, but a yeti.

470
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,540
And a tiger.

471
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,650
Yuzu has its first Bengal tiger.

472
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,510
Left side of the game, higher staff.

473
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,750
Why did you sit down like that?

474
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:51,930
Make a path.

475
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,570
I think they can see.

476
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,710
I think they can see the tiger.

477
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,390
Oh my god.

478
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,810
Oh, I thought they were...

479
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,270
I thought the yeti was maybe a person in a suit.

480
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,650
And they were about to, you know, become the yeti.

481
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,450
Yeti guy exhibit.

482
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,010
Exactly.

483
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,790
Okay.

484
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,390
Okay.

485
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,930
We're making a little pathway.

486
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,200
How many...

487
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,520
How much pathway do I need?

488
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,400
Place eight concrete paths.

489
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,660
Okay.

490
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,180
There we go.

491
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,240
Alright.

492
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,260
A burger stand.

493
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,540
I didn't really leave a lot of room for that.

494
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,580
There we go.

495
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,360
Now your patrons have a place to get something to eat.

496
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,920
What's next?

497
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,340
Why they're going to get thirsty.

498
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,160
Oh shoot.

499
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,500
Okay.

500
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,640
Yeah.

501
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,360
Okay.

502
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,240
The pathway to the drink station.

503
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,020
Kazuhiro's Burgers.

504
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh my gosh.

505
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,360
We have the name of that.

506
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,840
Don't we?

507
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,560
Someone's dying of thirst and they're like, oh my god.

508
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm so thirsty.

509
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,520
I hope there's a drink place close by.

510
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,560
I have to walk to the other side of the zoo.

511
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,060
But do you want them to eat and drink standing up?

512
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,900
Let's place four picnic tables near the burger stand.

513
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,200
Oh.

514
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,980
Okay.

515
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,100
Wait.

516
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:42,560
Oh.

517
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,180
Here.

518
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,950
There we go.

519
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,390
Mint burgers.

520
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,170
No.

521
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,590
Kazuhiro Burgers.

522
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,850
You're really getting the hang of this.

523
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,430
They're eating.

524
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:03,850
They're drinking.

525
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,410
What's missing?

526
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,690
Oh, restrooms.

527
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,290
I just...

528
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,210
What did I just do there?

529
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:12,850
Oh my gosh.

530
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,650
Imagine you pee in front of the giraffes.

531
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,990
What?

532
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,290
Birth?

533
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,800
Oh my gosh.

534
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,240
Happy birthday, Miki.

535
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,020
You're missing one last item.

536
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,820
Oh, trash can.

537
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,430
There.

538
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,850
Oh, three.

539
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,420
Okay.

540
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,720
Wait.

541
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,860
I accidentally placed something I didn't mean to.

542
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,760
Actually, I feel like we're pretty good.

543
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,120
Actually, this is important because the chimpanzees were miserable.

544
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,980
Why were they so upset?

545
00:29:59,720 --> 00:29:59,860
Okay.

546
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,120
Suitable exhibit.

547
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,500
Oh, I forgot about this.

548
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,240
You can make the ground and stuff.

549
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,860
Can you put 500 alligators all over the place?

550
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,580
I just saw a great anime.

551
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,060
It's about a guy named Sanshi with eczema on his legs.

552
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,820
It's called Ichi Ni Sanshi.

553
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,700
Boo!

554
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,920
Wait.

555
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,260
Yeah, negative two.

556
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,060
Okay, on the left side, click the construction button.

557
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,480
This one?

558
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,440
Oh, okay.

559
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
So, from what I remember...

560
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,180
Hold on.

561
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,940
You can click and then you can see what they like, right?

562
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,900
Wait, how do you see what they like though?

563
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,220
Who has slept a long time ago?

564
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,820
Get this guy to bed.

565
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,840
You're a lion.

566
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,080
What else are you doing?

567
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,620
Okay.

568
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,360
Oh

569
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,360
my god, this guy.

570
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,960
Oh no, Mike Tigers.

571
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,680
Oh no, nobody's happy.

572
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,240
Okay, okay.

573
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,940
Hold on.

574
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,880
The tutorial is making me do the lions first.

575
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,700
The savannah grass.

576
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,220
Oh, look at how happy he's becoming.

577
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,500
But sometimes they like a little bit of grass.

578
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,420
Oh, okay.

579
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Do it for the adjacent exhibit.

580
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,960
Place the correct terrain in the jaguar exhibit.

581
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,840
So, I have to go here.

582
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,700
Ah, see?

583
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,660
And then it shows...

585
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,040
Okay, so it's here that shows what they like.

586
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,400
He's not sleepy, he's my brother.

587
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,900
Negative two.

588
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,960
Okay, jaguar likes rainforest.

589
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,440
This is the jaguar, right?

590
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,540
And then we can make it bigger, I remember.

591
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,500
They're happier, they're happy.

592
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,280
Oh, too much, too much grass.

593
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,400
Oh no, no, sorry.

594
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,340
Whee!

595
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,480
Whee!

596
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,200
Okay, okay.

597
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,300
Oh, too much, too much, too much.

598
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,200
What?

599
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,160
It's a jaguar.

600
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,580
Is it not?

601
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,660
Or is it...

602
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,880
Yeah, jaguar.

603
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,060
What do you mean?

604
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,080
What do you guys call it?

605
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,780
It says leopard.

606
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
Oh shit!

607
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,760
Oopsie.

608
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,980
Wait, which one is that one?

609
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,520
Oh no!

610
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,560
There he is!

611
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,100
Okay, what does he like?

612
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,620
Oh, then we got lucky with the leopards, huh?

613
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,780
He wants the rainforest.

614
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,550
Why does he get such a sad, small exhibit?

615
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,530
Jaguar.

616
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,470
Jaguar.

617
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,670
What?

618
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,050
Jaguar.

619
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,430
Jaguar.

620
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,670
What are you talking about?

621
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,890
Jaguar.

622
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,270
Jaguar.

623
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,470
Why are you guys making fun of how I talk?

624
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,980
Jaguawa.

625
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,100
Jaguawa.

626
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,270
Don't make fun of how I talk.

627
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,430
It's like, one time...

628
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,770
Okay, I'm gonna say this and now you guys are always going to point it out whenever I say it.

629
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,550
But one time I was like, oh man, I won the game, yippee!

630
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,990
And someone was just like, won?

631
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,870
Don't you mean won?

632
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,210
And I was like, I won the game!

633
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,310
Yeah, I won the game!

634
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,430
And they're like, no, it's pronounced won the game.

635
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,570
I won the game.

636
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:35,630
And they're like, no!

637
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,610
Why?

638
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,490
And ever since then, I've always been so self-conscious about it.

639
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,590
And now I'm never gonna...

640
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,470
I'm just gonna call this a big kitty.

641
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,150
It's spelled jaguar.

642
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,250
But it's pronounced throat war for mangrove.

643
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,580
Okay, great.

644
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,940
Both exhibits now have terrain that the animals like.

645
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,720
Animals require more than just terrain.

646
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,160
Okay, now we're gonna add trees.

647
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,120
Place two trees in the lion exhibit.

648
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,680
Oh, okay.

649
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,940
Okay, two trees.

650
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,480
What?

651
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,640
Wait, he doesn't like that!

652
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,380
What does he want then?

653
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,060
Oh, this one?

654
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,200
He's like...

655
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,780
What?

656
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,860
What?

657
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,900
Two grass trees?

658
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,440
He hates this thing!

659
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,820
I'm making him unhappy!

660
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,580
What?

661
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Oops, did you notice that?

662
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, okay.

663
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,120
Float it up.

664
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,200
Please indicate the lion doesn't like this tree.

665
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,540
We can't imagine where you got the idea to do that.

666
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,080
These guys are gaslighters.

667
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,460
He hates trees.

668
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,260
Okay.

669
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,100
Delete tree.

670
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,860
Delete it, delete it, delete it.

671
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,740
He wants this instead.

672
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,880
Okay, four trees for you.

673
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,520
Lion one is unhappy.

674
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,360
Okay, click the big kitty.

675
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,960
Okay.

676
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,040
Four in the big kitty cage.

677
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,680
Okay, four in the big kitty cage.

678
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,720
Wait, what does he like?

679
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,760
What does he like?

680
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,960
He likes this one.

681
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,010
Four.

682
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,410
Big kitty.

683
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,970
He wants a gaming PC.

684
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,230
Big kitties love catwalk trees.

685
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,170
You can also discover how to make animals happy by viewing the zookeeper's recommendations.

686
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,710
Oh, here.

687
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,950
Okay, let's see what he says.

688
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,990
He needs more foliage.

689
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,830
There's too much grass.

690
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,470
This is reminding me...

691
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,130
Do you guys...

692
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,890
Do you guys see that episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog?

693
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,950
With little Muriel.

694
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,730
And she's like...

695
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:01,830
Less macaroni.

696
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,690
More cheese.

697
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,530
That's how I feel about this.

698
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,930
Too much grass.

699
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,590
Not enough dirt.

700
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,770
Too much rain for us.

701
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,570
Not enough water.

702
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,980
Improve the lion's exhibit suitability.

703
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,530
Look, he's so much happier though.

704
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,650
He would be happier with more rocks.

705
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,690
Okay, not enough dirt.

706
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,890
I like how you say words.

707
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:26,690
No.

708
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,030
I don't want to be a streamer anymore.

709
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,650
People make fun of the way I say words.

710
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,290
Sigh.

711
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:35,770
Dirt.

712
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,290
Okay, little tiny dirts.

713
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,090
Dirt.

714
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:38,930
Dirt.

715
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:39,670
Dirt.

716
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,450
Dirt.

717
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,370
Dirt.

718
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,050
Maybe... Is there too much grass?

719
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,810
Too much grass!

720
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,430
More dirt.

721
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,130
Too much grass.

722
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,970
You gotta remember to get the edges, you know?

723
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,430
Too much grass.

724
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,250
Okay, too much grass.

725
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,340
Okay.

726
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,580
Now it's better.

727
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,500
More animals of the same type.

728
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:01,880
Okay.

729
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,700
Oh, wait.

730
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
I just made a guy.

731
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
Okay, fight for her.

732
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,340
And then he wants some rocks.

733
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,260
He's always wanted a brother.

734
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,380
Not enough sand.

735
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,880
Too much dirt.

736
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,540
I hate this game.

737
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,060
Too much grass.

738
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,880
Too much grass.

739
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,840
Not enough grass.

740
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,700
Not enough sand.

741
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,540
Too much dirt.

742
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,130
Too much dirt.

743
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,310
I love the way they sound so sad.

744
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,690
How's the volume, by the way?

745
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,570
Not enough shelters.

746
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,310
Fresh water.

747
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,170
Toy.

748
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:51,550
Okay.

749
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,030
Oh, there's something about the lion.

750
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,250
High maintenance lion.

751
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,510
I know, right?

752
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,150
Gosh.

753
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,230
Water.

754
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,770
Water.

755
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,070
Oh!

756
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,650
We did it!

757
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,990
The African lion is now quite happy with its exhibit.

758
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,190
You must complete just one more task before you are ready to manage your own zoo.

759
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,870
The zoo has been given two additional clouded leopards.

760
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,570
They have been placed in an exhibit that is not yet suitable for them.

761
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,210
Okay.

762
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,910
I know where these guys are.

763
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,430
Make a duplicate?

764
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,510
Of the...

765
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,010
Oh.

766
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,510
Like this?

767
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,150
So this is...

768
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,790
Wait.

769
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,890
This is a...

770
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,230
Huh?

771
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:31,770
Huh?

772
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,170
So these are clouded leopards and then we got two more?

773
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,050
Okay.

774
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,830
This is exactly what I went through when I was like ten.

775
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,050
I never touched a tycoon game after.

776
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,370
Because these picky ass animals!

777
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,490
This is just too weird of a placement.

778
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,370
Do they like this?

779
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,130
Oh, yeah they do, baby.

780
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,230
Oh, yeah.

781
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,630
Oh, yeah.

782
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,970
Do they like that?

783
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,110
Oh, yeah.

784
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,290
Oh, yeah.

785
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,250
Yeah, we're gonna make this like...

786
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,170
Oh, they hate that thing.

787
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,230
That's the ugliest tree I've ever seen.

788
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,010
Yeah, we like this tree instead.

789
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,470
What about this one?

790
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:09,970
Oh!

791
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,090
Oh, no.

792
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,350
That's an ugly ass tree.

793
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,270
We hate that tree.

794
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,790
Less macaroni.

795
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,010
More cheese.

796
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,570
Ew, someone's going to the bathroom.

797
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,390
Oh!

798
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,930
That's fancy.

799
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,930
And we can rotate it too.

800
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,010
Look at that.

801
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,390
Look at that.

802
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,690
Look at that.

803
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,910
And then shelters for these guys.

804
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,150
They need a shelter.

805
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,850
What do you mean you're not happy?

806
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,910
I'm working on it.

807
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,850
It's already so much better than before.

808
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,870
What are you talking about?

809
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,730
Hold on.

810
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,410
Needs more foliage.

811
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,390
Oh, a toy.

812
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,850
They want this.

813
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,510
This thing.

814
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,690
Oh, yeah.

815
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,770
And a rock.

816
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,150
Nope, never mind.

817
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,070
They don't want that rock.

818
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,480
More trees.

819
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,220
Okay, I'm just...

820
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,060
Oh, they hated this one.

821
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm going to give them a lot of ferns.

822
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,420
Also, this exhibit sucks.

823
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,100
How are you supposed to see anything in it?

824
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,120
Okay.

825
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,200
We did it.

826
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,380
We've done it.

827
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,300
Okay, we don't need to do the next one.

828
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,180
Oh, God!

829
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,480
You're streaming being...

830
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,620
Oh, you're streaming 24-7 online while you were in Japan was very helpful while I was writing code that could tell me if the user was live.

831
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,300
Thanks for that.

832
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,280
Here's 10 bucks.

833
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,120
Oh, thanks.

834
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,360
Glad I could help.

835
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,340
Play.

836
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,040
Freeform game.

837
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,460
Oh, my gosh.

838
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,080
Oh, my gosh.

839
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,640
Oh, my gosh.

840
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,240
Oh, my gosh.

841
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,880
Oh, my gosh.

842
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,520
Where do we want to go?

843
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,420
We could just be in the middle of the ocean.

844
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,300
Dry river.

845
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,620
I think we should go for...

846
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,940
What's a large dino map?

847
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,480
Small city, my beloved.

848
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,280
Where is that?

849
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,080
Small volcano.

850
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,100
Death mountain?

851
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,500
That sounds intense.

852
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Oh, small city.

853
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,480
There it is.

854
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,300
A small zoo in the middle of a city.

855
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,160
Epic.

856
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,200
Welcome to Mambo Ship.

857
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,140
Thank you.

858
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,940
Hmm...

859
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,340
Airport resort map.

860
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,360
This one seems kind of nice.

861
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,320
Lava lap.

862
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,200
Wow!

863
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,320
It has lava.

864
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,640
You guys, should we do a dinosaur map first thing?

865
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,100
Dino?

866
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:55,780
Okay.

867
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,920
I'm giving myself a high budget though.

868
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,680
I'm giving myself a high...

869
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,660
Wait, what's the highest we can do?

870
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,490
What if I give myself a million dollars?

871
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,910
Oh, I can't do that.

872
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,190
Okay.

873
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,990
Max it out?

874
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,110
Nah, we gotta have a little bit.

875
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,890
Above, above, above.

876
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,490
You know.

877
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,510
Oh, I hear it.

878
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,390
Whoa, these are so cool.

879
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,610
That's a lava pit.

880
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,990
Do you think the people will die here?

881
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,830
Do you think it'll...

882
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,450
Oh look, we can put sea dinos in there.

883
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,810
Do you think it'll explode?

884
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,410
It'll erupt.

885
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,390
All of this.

886
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,950
All of this.

887
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,830
Can you still use windows?

888
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,170
Oh, it does erupt.

889
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,490
Oh my god, the people will die.

890
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,610
Yeah, I still use Windows 10.

891
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,670
You can't make me upgrade to Windows 11.

892
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,550
I have that on my laptop and I hate it.

893
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,310
I hate Windows 11.

894
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:18,730
Okay.

895
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,430
This seems like a good place.

896
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,590
Look, there's even like little geysers and stuff.

897
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,030
Large geysers, little geysers.

898
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:26,910
Nice.

899
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,090
Okay.

900
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

901
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,920
We can also get regular animals.

902
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,900
We can get whatever we want.

903
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,440
But we gotta get a giant sloth.

904
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,020
Gotta get that guy.

905
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,700
What have we got?

906
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,460
Oh look, they show you how to pronounce it.

907
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:55,780
Bigfoot!

908
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,620
Oh my gosh, I used to love this thing.

909
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,960
I don't know what the hell this thing is.

910
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,320
I used to love it.

911
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,340
It's so cute.

912
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,920
I don't know what the hell that thing is.

913
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,240
Also, I always used to laugh at the realistic polar bear.

914
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,300
Magnet the polar bear.

915
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,320
Like, who is that?

916
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,520
What's a...

917
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,900
What's a...

918
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,440
Oh, here.

919
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,760
The Loch Ness Monster.

920
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,700
That'll be a good thing.

921
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,400
It's Magnet.

922
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,340
If you like dinosaurs, you should try Jurassic World 2 game.

923
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,020
Oh.

924
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,780
And wooly rhinoceros.

925
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,100
That guy can go...

926
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,720
Oh, giant tortoise.

927
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:47,700
Yeah.

928
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,300
These guys can go in here.

929
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,760
Oh, I remember the reindeer.

930
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,640
And the reindeer would be like...

931
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,060
And it would have Christmas music sometimes.

932
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,140
I remember.

933
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,500
Are these birds or are these like...

934
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:01,820
You know.

935
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:02,680
Okay.

936
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,340
What should be our first dinosaur?

937
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,880
Oh my gosh.

938
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,440
Oh my gosh.

939
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:06,960
Oh my gosh.

940
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,420
I'm gonna build some facilities.

941
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,420
We're gonna build...

942
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,740
I always like to have a little...

943
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,780
A little...

944
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,260
What's it called?

945
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:15,900
Gift stand.

946
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,480
Like here.

947
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,320
Is there like a dino themed one?

948
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:18,560
Ah.

949
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:19,760
This.

950
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,280
This.

951
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,700
This might be good.

952
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:22,980
Gift stand.

953
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,260
Alright, everybody.

954
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:25,880
Come in.

955
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,320
Come in.

956
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,780
Come in.

957
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:30,740
Hmm.

958
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,020
22 dollars.

959
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,580
Only gift stands.

960
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,960
Only gift stands and a long, long, long pathway.

961
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,020
All the way to see...

962
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,560
All the way to see this guy.

963
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,380
What should be our first guy?

964
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,420
Mel-chan!

965
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,140
Thanks for 9 months.

966
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,120
The restroom by the...

967
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,060
The single restroom is at the volcano.

968
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,640
Gosh, there's so many buildings.

969
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,820
There's so many buildings.

970
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,340
Oh, here we go.

971
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,640
Oh no!

972
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,320
Why not?

973
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,240
Oh, come on.

974
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,780
What?

975
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,220
A raptor?

976
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,820
Okay, okay.

977
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,620
I'm gonna do this.

978
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:25,940
And this.

979
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,800
We're gonna try for real, you guys.

980
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,420
This is like serious...

981
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,140
Gaming.

982
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:31,500
What?

983
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,440
I can't put it in between?

984
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,640
Okay, that kind of sucks.

985
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,560
I'm gonna put a tall torch.

986
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,480
Nope, nevermind.

987
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,660
I'm not gonna put that.

988
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,040
Look, this is the theming.

989
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,860
This is the theming.

990
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,980
Now we're locked in.

991
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,580
And then...

992
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,960
The benches are all stone.

993
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,100
Yeah.

994
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,340
I'm gonna have a small exhibit right here.

995
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,080
Go away.

996
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,380
There's always...

997
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,320
It's always best to have like an exhibit...

998
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,040
Right in the front.

999
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,700
You know what I mean?

1000
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,340
To get them people like...

1001
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,320
They're like...

1002
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,660
It should be fine like this though, right?

1003
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,540
I don't remember which ones need like the electric...

1004
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,320
The electric chair.

1005
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,780
Electric chair, electric chair.

1006
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,600
Thanks for the five gifted.

1007
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,320
Thank you.

1008
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,100
What should this be?

1009
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,740
Gotta be something big at the front though.

1010
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,280
You think?

1011
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,800
I was thinking like a little...

1012
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,720
Small teaser.

1013
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,660
Like a...

1014
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,200
Little...

1015
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,920
You're like, wow.

1016
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:37,880
Oh my gosh.

1017
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,920
That's a thing at the front.

1018
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,440
Sorry, I meant fence.

1019
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,080
Electric fence.

1020
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,180
I didn't mean chair.

1021
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,400
Electric chair.

1022
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,180
No, fence.

1023
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:50,580
Sorry.

1024
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,560
Hi, dad.

1025
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:56,760
It's okay.

1026
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,520
We still love you.

1027
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,460
Whenever you talk Tommy Pickles.

1028
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,340
A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.

1029
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,620
I can...

1030
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,520
I don't need this.

1031
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,620
I don't need...

1032
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,240
If I just put it to the back, right?

1033
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,100
We don't need...

1034
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,640
We don't need...

1035
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,520
We don't need...

1036
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,220
Along the wall, right?

1037
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,460
That's how that works.

1038
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,540
I don't know actually.

1039
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,520
The wall...

1040
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,520
The wall against...

1041
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,020
Should be fine.

1042
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,580
It is fine.

1043
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,080
My brother and I bonded over this game as kids.

1044
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,000
Brother.

1045
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,200
Clever girl.

1046
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,640
Praise me.

1047
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,220
Praise me.

1048
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:46,560
Okay.

1049
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,180
All signs point to brother.

1050
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,120
Okay, first exhibit.

1051
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,720
And then we're gonna get rid of these.

1052
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,760
Because we don't need them.

1053
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,040
Save our money.

1054
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,160
Atlantean tank wall.

1055
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,620
Maybe like this guy.

1056
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,500
Aster...

1057
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,060
Astericosaurus.

1058
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,100
Living medium to large size...

1059
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,620
Maybe not.

1060
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,520
Small...

1061
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:21,980
Oh.

1062
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,700
A Plateo...

1063
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,780
Plateosaurus might be good.

1064
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,940
He's a gentle little guy.

1065
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,140
He's so gentle.

1066
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,920
He means no harm.

1067
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,440
Brother.

1068
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,220
Or a Gallimimus.

1069
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,020
Medium to large size.

1070
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,920
No.

1071
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,320
We need a small guy.

1072
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,520
We need somebody who doesn't like people.

1073
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,380
A Komodo dragon!

1074
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,000
What's with the tar pit?

1075
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,500
I don't know.

1076
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,940
It was just there when I got here.

1077
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,900
Wait, if I put this guy in...

1078
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,960
Is he...

1079
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,880
Oh, I forgot.

1080
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,420
They start as eggs and then they hatch.

1081
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,400
I forgot that.

1082
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,200
That's so cute.

1083
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,500
Asterigosaurus.

1084
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:10,600
Us.

1085
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,060
Us.

1086
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,680
Us.

1087
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,140
Does it mean you're sick?

1088
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,600
Yeah, I am a little bit.

1089
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,840
Do you unlock more animals or is this everything?

1090
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,840
This is the guy that will break out.

1091
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,820
I'm almost positive.

1092
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,880
Allosaurus will break the barrier.

1093
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,440
Right!

1094
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,580
I kind of want to see it though.

1095
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,840
We'll do it later.

1096
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,260
Okay, let's just do a little...

1097
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:42,800
This guy.

1098
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,540
We'll put two of them.

1099
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,140
They like deciduous forest.

1100
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,880
Okay, alright.

1101
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,060
I'm doing it.

1102
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,440
Are there any people here?

1103
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,660
Hello everybody!

1104
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,840
You should join.

1105
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,560
You should come to our park because it's very awesome.

1106
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,680
We have dinosaurs now.

1107
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,740
Hello!

1108
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,280
Show me your kids!

1109
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,140
Thanks for the gifted.

1110
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,220
Oh my gosh.

1111
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,040
What else do they like?

1112
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,220
What else do they like?

1113
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,780
You like...

1114
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,560
Oh no!

1115
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,420
He needs a scientist.

1116
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,560
Okay, scientist.

1117
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,260
Get in there.

1118
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,420
Let's do a tour guide.

1119
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,360
A dinosaur recovery room?

1120
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,120
We don't need that.

1121
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,760
That's so silly.

1122
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,140
Wait, does scientist take care of the dinosaurs too?

1123
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh, okay.

1124
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,420
You're too slow.

1125
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:48,980
Get in there.

1126
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,920
How many Land Before Times have you seen?

1127
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,600
I don't know.

1128
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,320
Maybe...

1129
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,920
I don't know.

1130
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,700
Let's do a speedy recovery.

1131
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,720
Thank you!

1132
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,760
Thanks, Magister!

1133
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:07,620
Alright.

1134
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,320
Alright.

1135
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,080
See, they're getting healthier.

1136
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,020
Okay, what else do they like?

1137
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,240
This guy likes the gloss...

1138
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,620
...trees.

1139
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,340
Wait.

1140
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,560
None of these look like that.

1141
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,840
Uh-oh.

1142
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,040
Wait, do I not have that tree?

1143
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,320
Uh-oh.

1144
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,400
The glossy tree?

1145
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,200
Uh-oh.

1146
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:47,650
Uh-oh.

1147
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,170
I need to research it first.

1148
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,050
Wait, how do I do that?

1149
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,690
That was not in the tutorial.

1150
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,760
What do you think of the park?

1151
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,720
What do you think of the park, guest number three?

1152
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,140
Look at that egg.

1153
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,100
I've seen everything in the zoo.

1154
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,180
I have to leave now.

1155
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh, you like a chimpanzee?

1156
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,620
You're at the wrong part.

1157
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,800
What are you people doing?

1158
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,560
Oh my god, they're all sacrificing themselves.

1159
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,560
Stop, she's going to sacrifice herself.

1160
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,060
I've seen everything at the zoo.

1161
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,340
Eek, I better not get too close to the lava pit.

1162
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,060
Okay, maybe don't go off the path.

1163
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:26,700
Hello?

1164
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,500
Eek, the lava pit.

1165
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,260
Oh, I'm so scared.

1166
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,940
I'm thirsty.

1167
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,800
Oh my god.

1168
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,020
You dumbass.

1169
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,580
Go here.

1170
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,280
Give me money.

1171
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,090
How are you feeling?

1172
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,450
Suitability zero.

1173
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,750
Too much.

1174
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,290
Okay, we need more water.

1175
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,760
He does not like his exhibit.

1176
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,300
There we go.

1177
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,540
More water.

1178
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,620
Does not like the tar pit.

1179
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,140
But it's natural.

1180
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,360
Thanks for the super chat, Jimmy.

1181
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,120
More foliage.

1182
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:17,960
More rocks.

1183
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,400
Okay, more rocks.

1184
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,660
We can do rocks.

1185
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,640
Uh...

1186
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,340
No...

1187
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,060
Uh...

1188
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,200
Normal ass rocks.

1189
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,500
Normal ass rocks.

1190
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,100
Some small rocks.

1191
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,970
I'm going to try...

1192
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
The skinko tree.

1193
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,380
Oh, see, they do like it.

1194
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,900
What about this one?

1195
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1196
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,120
This is good.

1197
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,580
This is good.

1198
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,860
They like it.

1199
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,900
And...

1200
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,460
Oh!

1201
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,840
Oh!

1202
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,900
What about this?

1203
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:52,900
Nice.

1204
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,180
Nice.

1205
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,520
I knew that forest...

1206
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,100
Oh, too many.

1207
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,120
Just kidding.

1208
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,460
Too much brownstone.

1209
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,760
Not enough grass.

1210
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,220
Not...

1211
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,240
Too much sand.

1212
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,920
Where the hell is sand?

1213
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,500
Where is sand in your...

1214
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,100
Oh, okay.

1215
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,500
Okay.

1216
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,040
Okay.

1217
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:10,940
I got it.

1218
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,800
I got it.

1219
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,000
Chill.

1220
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,460
I understand.

1221
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,260
They like that.

1222
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,460
Oh, there's the sand.

1223
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,520
Okay.

1224
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,460
Too much...

1225
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,400
Too much sand.

1226
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,440
Not enough fresh water.

1227
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,190
I got sick too.

1228
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,670
Why did you get sick?

1229
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,370
Don't get sick.

1230
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,050
Okay.

1231
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:34,950
Now a shelter.

1232
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:35,940
And they're going to be...

1233
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,510
So happy.

1234
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,950
Like the happiest dinosaur burrow.

1235
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,170
Get this...

1236
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,020
Get this right in...

1237
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,130
In here.

1238
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:46,890
Somewhere.

1239
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,830
Why can't I place it anywhere?

1240
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,910
She's infecting us.

1241
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:53,850
It wasn't me.

1242
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,030
Maybe this.

1243
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,130
Oh my god.

1244
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:56,370
Okay.

1245
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:56,790
Never mind.

1246
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,520
I didn't pass the sickness on to you.

1247
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,100
You guys are just down with the sickness.

1248
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,180
It's not my fault.

1249
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,460
Okay.

1250
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,620
I'm going to get rid of this rock.

1251
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,280
Look at him go.

1252
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,680
Okay.

1253
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,780
And I'm going to get rid of this tree.

1254
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,980
Just for now you guys.

1255
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,460
Oh my god.

1256
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,080
I'm so picky.

1257
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,320
Okay.

1258
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,180
Alright.

1259
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,880
I'm going to add some more rocks.

1260
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,900
Just for you guys.

1261
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,620
My sweet little...

1262
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,100
My sweet little...

1263
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,660
Platypuses.

1264
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,740
Whatever you're called.

1265
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,060
I don't remember your name.

1266
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,280
I give you a better tree.

1267
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,280
Sorry.

1268
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,180
That scared me.

1269
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,190
Parry the platypus.

1270
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,610
Let's do another exhibit.

1271
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,090
Still waiting on those 500 gators.

1272
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,190
They are coming.

1273
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,490
They are coming.

1274
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,410
They're going to be...

1275
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,910
They're going to be like the final exhibit.

1276
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:04,110
Okay.

1277
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:04,950
Oh.

1278
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:06,650
Wow.

1279
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,210
They're doing research all the way over here.

1280
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,420
They're going to be like right...

1281
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:16,800
No.

1282
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,920
I feel like you need to go to the far side.

1283
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,500
Of the place.

1284
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,060
You know?

1285
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:22,100
You know?

1286
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,420
Can you rename a guest after me and drop me in the lava?

1287
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,260
Okay.

1288
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:29,820
Where are you?

1289
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,160
Oh, here.

1290
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,240
Guest 19.

1291
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,020
No.

1292
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,040
Guest...

1293
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,780
Gezora.

1294
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,380
Alright.

1295
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:37,980
See you later.

1296
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,840
Oh, I can't.

1297
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,360
I can't.

1298
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:46,900
Here.

1299
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,680
I'll just do this.

1300
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:53,370
Alright.

1301
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,350
Good luck getting home.

1302
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,170
Good luck.

1303
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,330
Good luck everybody else.

1304
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,470
Alright.

1305
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,110
Let's do one over here because these guys are pissing me off.

1306
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,810
Why do they keep walking over there?

1307
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,290
The exhibit is right here in front of you.

1308
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:20,730
Oh.

1309
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:21,970
No, no, no.

1310
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:22,490
I don't...

1311
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,050
I don't care.

1312
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,470
I think I need to put the walking path closer.

1313
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,760
How do I build paths again?

1314
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,620
Hold on.

1315
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,120
How do I build...

1316
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,840
Hold on.

1317
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:42,820
I know.

1318
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:43,960
I know this.

1319
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,240
I know this terrain.

1320
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,720
Height.

1321
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:51,940
Oh, zoo paths.

1322
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,830
There we go.

1323
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,210
Now everybody can get up and close and personal with our favorite little guys.

1324
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,050
And they're so happy.

1325
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:05,870
See?

1326
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,630
They're so happy.

1327
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,730
He says he's overjoyed.

1328
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,850
They're overjoyed.

1329
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,100
Okay.

1330
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,060
What should we build right here?

1331
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,660
Lava pit is way cooler than a zoo.

1332
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:24,460
I...

1333
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,460
Look at everybody.

1334
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,720
Why do you care?

1335
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:27,660
Why?

1336
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,220
Oh, gross.

1337
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,740
Pick that shit up.

1338
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,280
Literally.

1339
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,880
Look at this.

1340
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,960
This is not an exhibit.

1341
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,220
Wow.

1342
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,040
That's not...

1343
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,620
It's not part of the...

1344
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,910
Drop me in a dinosaur enclosure?

1345
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:02,880
Oh, sorry.

1346
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,580
I forgot the L.

1347
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,140
You were too stunned to speak.

1348
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,260
Oh.

1349
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,240
Oh, there you go.

1350
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:17,660
Okay.

1351
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,220
Now you're...

1352
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,620
Now you're freaking out a little bit.

1353
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,020
Oh, yeah.

1354
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,730
I want to hear your screams.

1355
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,290
Why aren't you screaming?

1356
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,730
Why can't I hear your screams?

1357
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:36,730
Hmm.

1358
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:38,170
Anyway.

1359
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,630
Guys, what do we...

1360
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,450
Wow.

1361
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,570
Small volcano.

1362
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:44,950
That's so cool.

1363
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,570
What is a dinosaur that likes this area?

1364
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:49,190
You know?

1365
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:52,850
Wait a second.

1366
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,650
I think I put two girls in here.

1367
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,900
You are...

1368
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,300
Oh.

1369
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,600
Yuri real?

1370
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,620
If I put in a guy now though, that's a problematic age gap.

1371
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,110
What do I do?

1372
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,110
Love triangle?

1373
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:35,470
No.

1374
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,540
What do I do?

1375
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,640
There's still year one.

1376
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,600
Oh,

1377
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:51,640
we got this guy now.

1378
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,580
He's really colorful.

1379
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,340
When do we get...

1380
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,820
Saltwater crocodile.

1381
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:58,860
We're getting the crocs.

1382
01:02:59,060 --> 01:02:59,940
We're getting the crocs.

1383
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,360
Where is he?

1384
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,440
Oh, my God.

1385
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:05,880
Wolf.

1386
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,760
This guy.

1387
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,270
They're happy.

1388
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:13,370
No.

1389
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,010
You shouldn't be happy about that.

1390
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,160
Mint strikes me as someone who wears crocs.

1391
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:24,800
I don't.

1392
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,620
I actually don't though.

1393
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,380
A dinosaur ghost.

1394
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,480
That's literally all around us.

1395
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,360
A dinosaur ghost.

1396
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,820
I have a dinosaur as a pet.

1397
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,240
A dinosaur ghost.

1398
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,980
All ghosts have a dinosaur as a pet.

1399
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,730
No shoulder frills Mint has summoned me.

1400
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:53,130
I literally have the shoulders on.

1401
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,810
What do you want from me?

1402
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:03,410
Okay, let's build a really dangerous guy.

1403
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,770
Let's build a dangerous...

1404
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,570
Let's build a dangerous guy.

1405
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:16,870
So dangerous that anybody who steps close is gonna get got.

1406
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:21,470
So dangerous and scary.

1407
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:29,330
Even looking at him might cause death.

1408
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,610
He's that scary.

1409
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:36,630
We're just gonna build it just like this.

1410
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,410
Just like this.

1411
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:39,750
Oh, yeah.

1412
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,650
Who the hell is...

1413
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,710
Wait, I don't have a bathroom here, do I?

1414
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,670
Uh-oh, everybody's probably shitting their pants.

1415
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,170
Hold on.

1416
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:54,950
My bad, everybody.

1417
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:55,890
Here you go.

1418
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,470
All is well.

1419
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,590
Let's do a couple bouncy guys.

1420
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:12,170
You guys, we have to make the greatest zoo in the world first.

1421
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:15,430
We have to make it the greatest zoo so our place is packed.

1422
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:19,230
Everyone's just like, oh my god, I love this zoo so much.

1423
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,250
It's the greatest zoo ever.

1424
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,450
Oh, no.

1425
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:28,390
And then we let them loose and we block the entrance and everybody dies.

1426
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:29,410
That's what we got.

1427
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,710
That's the strat.

1428
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,330
That is the actual strat.

1429
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,550
I know what I'm doing.

1430
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,890
But first we have to play things proper, okay?

1431
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:46,650
We have to make sure this place is so popular, though.

1432
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,010
It's gotta be so popular first.

1433
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,030
What the hell?

1434
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,290
What was that boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink?

1435
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:58,830
No!

1436
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,230
Plotty!

1437
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,130
He's sucking that up.

1438
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,670
Oh, yeah.

1439
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,450
Can you guys hear the game, by the way, or is it too low?

1440
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,730
Just let me know.

1441
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:17,370
All right, this looks kind of thin right now because I messed up a little bit.

1442
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,430
It's going.

1443
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,570
It sounds fine.

1444
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:21,550
Okay, thank you, guys.

1445
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,750
This is gonna be a pretty big enclosure.

1446
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:30,990
Guys,

1447
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,690
I think this guy was gonna get out.

1448
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,160
Guys, I think I messed up a little bit.

1449
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,140
Oh, oh, oh.

1450
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,560
Does himself instead of five kisses.

1451
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:51,720
It's okay.

1452
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,600
It's okay.

1453
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,580
We can remedy this.

1454
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,460
Wait, what did I just do?

1455
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,180
How did that drag?

1456
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,880
I'm serious.

1457
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,010
Oh, this is how you drag.

1458
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,130
I figured out how.

1459
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,530
So you have to place it first.

1460
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:09,430
Ah, I figured it out.

1461
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,790
I figured it out.

1462
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:11,510
Oh, whoops.

1463
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,490
There we go.

1464
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,610
I figured it out.

1465
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,790
I figured it out.

1466
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:20,710
Oh, thank God.

1467
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,290
Oh, thank God.

1468
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:23,350
All right, and then here.

1469
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:24,510
Oh, whoops.

1470
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,610
I messed up again.

1471
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,310
No, I messed up.

1472
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,850
There we go.

1473
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,810
Okay, like this, like so.

1474
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,090
All right, this is a pretty big, pretty big exhibit.

1475
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,970
I'm not gonna lie.

1476
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,170
It's a pretty big exhibit.

1477
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:43,950
Any dino would be lucky to have this exhibit.

1478
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,510
This is like better...

1479
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,310
This is better than like a...

1480
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,390
Who the hell are you?

1481
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:52,790
No way, don't tell me.

1482
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:54,490
Is it?

1483
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,470
Nope, you're guest 104.

1484
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,950
Well, you're in the way.

1485
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,430
And we'll probably get eaten.

1486
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:04,930
Okay!

1487
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:05,330
Yay!

1488
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:08,710
Human.

1489
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:13,890
What?

1490
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,410
That's so messed up.

1491
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:34,010
The human is loose.

1492
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,530
Can you sit up there?

1493
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:36,450
Thanks for the...

1494
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:38,410
Thanks for the five.

1495
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,950
All right, people are like getting anxious, you guys.

1496
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,010
They're like, we need more dinos.

1497
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:45,550
Stat.

1498
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,330
Give us dinos or give us death.

1499
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,190
Do these guys like to hang out?

1500
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,930
Alone or in small family groups.

1501
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:56,190
Okay.

1502
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:57,650
That should be enough then.

1503
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,930
They are a rainforest.

1504
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,770
Rainforest kind of guys.

1505
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,690
Nope, that's not a rainforest.

1506
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,770
This is a rainforest.

1507
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:07,270
Okay.

1508
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:15,630
Kind of messed up having dinos next to fossils.

1509
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,470
You know, it's just...

1510
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,590
They have to be put in their place.

1511
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,050
They can't just be like, Ah, we're dinos and we ride in the joint.

1512
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:25,690
No, no, no.

1513
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,570
They also need to know what is to come for them.

1514
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:37,270
It's like when, you know, humans see cemeteries all the time.

1515
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,830
You have to be reminded of your mortality.

1516
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:43,370
That's...

1517
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:44,810
Where the hell is this person going?

1518
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,330
I can't stand these people.

1519
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:49,690
Zoopath.

1520
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:51,410
Oink, oink.

1521
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:52,430
Zoopath.

1522
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:54,530
Oink.

1523
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,250
Please let me drag.

1524
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,410
Please let me drag.

1525
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,500
Okay.

1526
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,040
Whatever.

1527
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:03,600
Good enough.

1528
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,160
There's our scientist.

1529
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,360
Kind of an inconvenient...

1530
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:11,860
Oh, there it is.

1531
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,260
Okay, good.

1532
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,180
Hey.

1533
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,940
Was that a Zoopals reference?

1534
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:22,840
Old!

1535
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,380
Old!

1536
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,620
You got the reference, you old.

1537
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,240
Let's get rid of this tree cause that tree is ugly.

1538
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,160
They probably love this thing.

1539
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,560
Mangrove tree?

1540
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,840
They want 50 of them.

1541
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,600
Durian tree?

1542
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,560
Oh, yeah.

1543
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,880
Oh, yeah.

1544
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,480
They're like, I live, breathe, die for the durians.

1545
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,840
And they probably want this thing.

1546
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,780
How do I...

1547
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,080
Uh-oh.

1548
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,700
Oh my god, it's already birthed.

1549
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,120
It's already birthed!

1550
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:01,300
Hello.

1551
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,460
Oh, yeah.

1552
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:07,060
Not enough fresh water, too much rainforest, not enough grass.

1553
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:07,540
Okay.

1554
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,100
More grass.

1555
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,040
Fully this grass.

1556
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:15,200
Grass.

1557
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,780
Oh, yeah.

1558
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,640
Happy little fellas.

1559
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,220
So happy.

1560
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,700
Look at them run!

1561
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,780
Eat that guy.

1562
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,380
Eat that guy.

1563
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,440
Is that enough grass?

1564
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:36,660
Too much rain...

1565
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:36,900
Okay.

1566
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,820
Now fresh water.

1567
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,100
Okay.

1568
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,840
Too steep.

1569
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,800
Walk cycle.

1570
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:44,960
Walk cycle.

1571
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,700
Hold on.

1572
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,180
This one.

1573
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,140
Down.

1574
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,160
Down.

1575
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,140
Down, drag.

1576
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,680
There we go.

1577
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,520
Maybe this area can go up.

1578
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:08,900
Like here?

1579
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:09,740
Oh, yeah.

1580
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,060
I don't think he's happy.

1581
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,400
Oh no, he's not happy.

1582
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,900
Oh, he's not happy.

1583
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,600
I'm working on it!

1584
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,400
I'm working on it!

1585
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,500
Is he gonna try and break out?

1586
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,900
I'm working on it.

1587
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,360
I'm working on it.

1588
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,080
I'm working on it!

1589
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:31,520
Oh my god.

1590
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,740
Guys, I don't think they're happy.

1591
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,220
Guys, I don't think they're happy.

1592
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,320
Guys.

1593
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,260
Dinosaur revolt.

1594
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,800
The minky revolution is now.

1595
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:42,880
Oh.

1596
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,360
Oh my god!

1597
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,160
No!

1598
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,720
You don't need to escape!

1599
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,160
Does not like the rubble.

1600
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,140
What rubble?

1601
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,380
What are they talking about?

1602
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,860
Oh no, he's trying to commit.

1603
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,700
Oh no!

1604
01:12:59,200 --> 01:12:59,940
He's trying.

1605
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,980
He's wanting to die.

1606
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,200
He'd rather kill himself than be in this exhibit.

1607
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,120
Oh my god.

1608
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,620
Oh my god.

1609
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,040
He won't eat it out though, right?

1610
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,460
It's electric.

1611
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,580
Oh wow!

1612
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,300
That's crazy.

1613
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,920
What rubble are they talking about?

1614
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,920
This thing?

1615
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,960
Oh, they didn't like that.

1616
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:31,220
Okay.

1617
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,460
Okay, now let's...

1618
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,680
Put in some fresh water.

1619
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:37,820
Fresh water.

1620
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,900
Does not like the rubble.

1621
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,780
Those dumb dinos take down the trees they don't like.

1622
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,940
Not enough fresh water still?

1623
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:53,960
Is that enough?

1624
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,540
Not enough grass.

1625
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:56,900
Okay.

1626
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,420
Are you really rainforest guys?

1627
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,920
Cause like...

1628
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,020
I don't know if that's true.

1629
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,800
You sure don't like anything.

1630
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,980
That is rainforesty.

1631
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,460
Oh, this.

1632
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,200
This they hate.

1633
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,360
Okay, picky ass.

1634
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,160
My god.

1635
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,280
Now we just gotta put in a shelter.

1636
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,600
And they'll be so much better.

1637
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,200
They'll be feeling good.

1638
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,780
There we go.

1639
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,100
They're not feeling good.

1640
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,520
It is well suited, but I don't think they...

1641
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,520
I don't think they care.

1642
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,640
Hold on!

1643
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,800
Let's put in more stuff.

1644
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,780
Do they want a toy?

1645
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,200
What do dinosaurs like?

1646
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,300
Show objects?

1647
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:50,740
No.

1648
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,400
Maybe some rocks?

1649
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,180
Meat.

1650
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,300
This one.

1651
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:58,620
Oh yeah.

1652
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,960
I'm working on it!

1653
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,760
They like that?

1654
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,040
Okay.

1655
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,980
But the ranger didn't tell me to put in rocks and shit.

1656
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,480
They're so unhappy.

1657
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,780
What rubble?

1658
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,900
What did you knock down now?

1659
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,840
Oh my god.

1660
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,700
Oh my god.

1661
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,840
They're so...

1662
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,700
Oh my god!

1663
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,180
It's getting better.

1664
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:32,700
It's getting better.

1665
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,580
It's getting better.

1666
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,620
Oh no, too many rocks.

1667
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,560
Do they like this?

1668
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,700
Oh no, they liked that.

1669
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:43,880
What was that?

1670
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,500
That was a...

1671
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,520
We'll just put a bush.

1672
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:48,920
Okay,

1673
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:53,950
this is good.

1674
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,330
You like this tree?

1675
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,610
I'm gonna get rid of this because it's too big.

1676
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:02,830
It's fine.

1677
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,290
They'll get over it.

1678
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,830
Do they hate this?

1679
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:12,750
Oh no, they liked that.

1680
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:14,470
They hate that.

1681
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,750
They only like a certain amount of them.

1682
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,570
Oh my god, they're so picky.

1683
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,750
They're so freaking picky.

1684
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,030
Oh my god, I'm gonna lose my...

1685
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:26,950
No, they hate that!

1686
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:32,430
I'm gonna lose my mind over these stupid ass allosaurus.

1687
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,110
Excellence in exhibit design.

1688
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:42,450
At least one exhibit that is highly suitable.

1689
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,310
Yeah, they're divas.

1690
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,510
You guys help!

1691
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,470
They're so awful to me.

1692
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,170
I'm just trying to make them happy.

1693
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,780
What about this?

1694
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,620
Yeah, more of these.

1695
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,560
I'm trying!

1696
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,580
Oh my god.

1697
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,540
This is such an ugly exhibit.

1698
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,440
These guys suck.

1699
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,180
No more durians.

1700
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:13,840
What's this one?

1701
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,520
I hate that.

1702
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,720
What about this one?

1703
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,400
We hate that.

1704
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:22,380
More of these.

1705
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,060
This exhibit sucks.

1706
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,300
Why aren't you guys eating?

1707
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,860
Oh my god, they're trying to starve themselves to death.

1708
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,620
They're starving.

1709
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,320
They have food right here!

1710
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,480
Can they not reach it?

1711
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,100
I wonder.

1712
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,030
Now they can reach it.

1713
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:48,150
Maybe.

1714
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,570
He's eating.

1715
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,250
Oh look, he's happy now.

1716
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,490
He's happy now.

1717
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:55,570
Offer them a goat.

1718
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,590
I'm gonna give them a bongo.

1719
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,070
They hate that.

1720
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,630
Oh!

1721
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,770
Oh my gosh, he's so much better now.

1722
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,130
Hey, why aren't you eating?

1723
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:13,910
You would...

1724
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,650
I'm gonna give you a minky.

1725
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,970
Wait, his food actually didn't go up.

1726
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,350
Eat, you stupid ass!

1727
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,470
Right there!

1728
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:30,570
There they are.

1729
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:33,590
They're trauma bonding.

1730
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,610
That's why they don't...

1731
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,470
This guy is so stupid.

1732
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:42,690
He killed it for sport.

1733
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:46,090
He does not like the rubble.

1734
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,910
You made more rubble?

1735
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:48,750
Are you kidding me?

1736
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,770
But you said you liked that tree!

1737
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,270
You said you liked it.

1738
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,510
Why'd you get rid of it?

1739
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,580
Why'd you kill it if you liked it?

1740
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,260
Okay.

1741
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,100
Whatever.

1742
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,320
I'm done learning how you function.

1743
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,300
Okay, they're happy now.

1744
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,080
They're happy.

1745
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,900
Okay, chat.

1746
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,840
Since these guys are so picky and annoying, I'm gonna name them Chat 2.

1747
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,240
Chat 1.

1748
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,900
Put them in solitary confinement for being so ungrateful.

1749
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,020
Solitary.

1750
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,580
Okay.

1751
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,160
They're better now though.

1752
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,560
Everything's good now.

1753
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,980
They're not trying to kill themselves.

1754
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,620
Can't find any food.

1755
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,000
Scientists, what are you doing?

1756
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,500
What the hell are you doing?

1757
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,480
Okay, we're gonna hire another scientist.

1758
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,980
How's the ratings on my zoo?

1759
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,280
Um...

1760
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:19,160
69.

1761
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,780
Why did it go down?

1762
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:27,860
What about no animals and 500 snack machines and burger stands?

1763
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,500
No, we gotta do this proper.

1764
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,040
First time is proper, guys.

1765
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,880
First time is proper.

1766
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,640
And then we fuck it up.

1767
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,700
And then we go apeshit.

1768
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,560
Hot dog.

1769
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,260
Oh yeah, hot dog stand.

1770
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,340
Get your hot dogs.

1771
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,500
Quality animal care.

1772
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,540
That's right, baby.

1773
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,900
I'm the best to ever do it.

1774
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,700
I'm the best to ever do it.

1775
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,820
I love how all these scientists are like, we're doing real research.

1776
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,640
And I'm like, la la la.

1777
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:08,720
Yeah.

1778
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:20,930
Time to have people eat hot dogs in front of your research stand area.

1779
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,970
Oh, here we go.

1780
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:22,830
The paths, okay.

1781
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,000
Okay, why can't I put anything there?

1782
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,340
Little dino feet to uh...

1783
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,480
Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of these.

1784
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:40,220
Yes.

1785
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:41,680
Yes.

1786
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,060
I'm gonna get rid of those and I'm gonna put in some...

1787
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,280
Get rid of the dumpster.

1788
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,260
We're gonna put in some places to eat.

1789
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,260
You know.

1790
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,820
The importance.

1791
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,020
The essentials.

1792
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:56,840
Yeah.

1793
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,420
Oh yeah.

1794
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,000
Like that.

1795
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,880
Model it after Monkey Jungle.

1796
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:06,820
The people are in the enclosure while the animals roam free outside.

1797
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,720
They'll all kill each other though.

1798
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,400
The humans, I mean.

1799
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,080
Hot dog.

1800
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:17,260
Hot dog.

1801
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,700
One hot dog, please.

1802
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,440
Wait, how much do I have it set here?

1803
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,460
Right, you sent too much.

1804
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,500
It's only a two dollar hot dog.

1805
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,400
It's a two dollar hot dog.

1806
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,810
Then I get a soda too.

1807
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:39,510
Okay.

1808
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,670
Do people even use these?

1809
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,730
Use this month only three times.

1810
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:50,590
I think the children should not have fun.

1811
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,730
What about this one?

1812
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:53,750
Only one time?

1813
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:54,830
Destroy, destroy.

1814
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,450
Okay, are you guys eating well now?

1815
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,970
Okay, good.

1816
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:08,920
Dino gift shop.

1817
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,680
Whoa, this place is huge.

1818
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,780
Okay, destroy this tree.

1819
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,720
And make...

1820
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,140
This is what we do, you guys.

1821
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:23,060
We destroy nature and make room for places that things can be bought at.

1822
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:26,820
Oh, there's just like a tree in the middle of the walkway.

1823
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:27,940
Oops.

1824
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,380
We destroy nature so that we can play.

1825
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,540
Move, you people.

1826
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,220
I'm trying to...

1827
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:39,500
Why doesn't anyone follow the damn...

1828
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,880
The damn park.

1829
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:43,340
The sidewalk.

1830
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,160
Oh my god.

1831
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,500
That was my favorite tree.

1832
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,220
I apologize.

1833
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:52,520
This is all in the name of capitalism.

1834
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,760
Had to be done.

1835
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,400
Uh oh.

1836
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,440
You good?

1837
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,400
Are you unhappy?

1838
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,540
Are you trying to kill yourself again?

1839
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,100
I dare you.

1840
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Chat, do it.

1841
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,260
I dare you.

1842
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,920
Yeah, I dare you.

1843
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:12,720
Kill yourself!

1844
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:13,740
Kill yourself!

1845
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,650
He tried.

1846
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:26,270
Zoo tycoon.

1847
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,230
Alright.

1848
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,870
Nice.

1849
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,870
Look at our little area.

1850
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:36,910
Look at our...

1851
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:37,630
Look at our zoo.

1852
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:44,150
But what nobody knows is that on the other side of the map...

1853
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:45,170
Where'd that person go?

1854
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,690
I wonder where they're at.

1855
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:56,890
Remember we just let them wander out here?

1856
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,430
I wonder where they went.

1857
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,330
Do you think they left?

1858
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:07,310
Wait.

1859
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,210
Nope, that's a different guest.

1860
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,730
What the hell are you guys doing out here?

1861
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:19,770
Don't we have like signs that say no people beyond this point?

1862
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,460
I just joined, but I...

1863
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:28,820
I'm talking to the dinosaur.

1864
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:28,980
Dinosaur.

1865
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,120
I went home a while ago meant my oshi is streaming tonight.

1866
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,240
No!

1867
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,380
Where are you?

1868
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,180
Wait, can we see like the name of the guest?

1869
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:41,880
Oh, guest list.

1870
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,040
Okay, hold on.

1871
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,720
You couldn't have left!

1872
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,160
You really did leave.

1873
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,740
You really did leave.

1874
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,280
Column 007.

1875
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,480
Zero successful escapes.

1876
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:03,540
Zero happiness points.

1877
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,220
Seven self-electrification.

1878
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,240
We have someone who's hungry.

1879
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,200
Okay, well maybe you should like find the burger.

1880
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,360
Oh, that's why you're hungry?

1881
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,140
You fucking dumbass!

1882
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,500
I'm thirsty.

1883
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,220
I need to go to the bathroom.

1884
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,580
I'm thirsty.

1885
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,380
I need to go to the bathroom.

1886
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,320
Oh my god!

1887
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,160
You deserve to go in here.

1888
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,200
Stupid guest 172.

1889
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,720
Kill him!

1890
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:33,220
Kill his ass!

1891
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,180
Ouch!

1892
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,500
I've been attacked by chat!

1893
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,760
There's your food.

1894
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,200
Chow down, baby.

1895
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:58,260
Ouch!

1896
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,300
Oh, he's fine now.

1897
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:04,680
False alarm.

1898
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,360
False alarm, everybody.

1899
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,500
I'm okay.

1900
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,540
This is drinks.

1901
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,100
We'll put it...

1902
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,040
Also, I forgot to mention.

1903
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,160
We are a hot dog only establishment.

1904
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,220
So there will be no other stands.

1905
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:30,540
Oh, sorry.

1906
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,100
I lied.

1907
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,960
There will be no other stands.

1908
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,320
Besides hot dogs.

1909
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,080
But it was themed.

1910
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,720
That's why I put it in.

1911
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,260
It was themed.

1912
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,500
Oh, and cotton candy.

1913
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,940
We can allow cotton candy.

1914
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,920
That's not a real food.

1915
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,120
Oh.

1916
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,640
Hot dogs only.

1917
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,880
And some drinks, you know.

1918
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,640
Anybody who's thirsty.

1919
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,540
Oh, let's put in some more trash cans.

1920
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,220
I think we only have one at the moment.

1921
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,240
Okay.

1922
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:15,480
Oh, sorry.

1923
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,160
Here, here.

1924
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,720
Another one right here.

1925
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:21,960
Perfect.

1926
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,440
Hot dog!

1927
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,240
Actually.

1928
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,020
Exactly.

1929
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:39,330
If you rename the tar pit into Minto's pit, I think it will be a popular attraction.

1930
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:42,870
But the dinosaurs didn't like it.

1931
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:44,890
That's so disappointing.

1932
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,060
It's like so disappointing.

1933
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:51,700
Hold on.

1934
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,460
Can I add more tar pit?

1935
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,640
Was it under here?

1936
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,320
You think?

1937
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,460
Oh wait, I forgot.

1938
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,820
There's like things like this.

1939
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,420
Like a fossil wall.

1940
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,640
People will be like, whoa, fossil wall.

1941
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:06,240
And we'll put in a Velociraptor statue.

1942
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,720
This is what every good park has.

1943
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,660
This little playful...

1944
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,640
This guy next to the toilet.

1945
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,960
Reinforce observation.

1946
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,160
Oh, this is nice.

1947
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,680
This is very fancy.

1948
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,300
Let's have a map.

1949
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,780
Does this really count as a zoo anymore?

1950
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:40,960
It's like, oh man, I wonder what's at the zoo.

1951
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,480
There's all two things.

1952
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:45,980
Yeah, baby.

1953
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:49,780
You get what you paid for here.

1954
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,880
All two things.

1955
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:52,900
Where's the tar pit?

1956
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:54,540
Oh no.

1957
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,740
Can we not buy the tar pit?

1958
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,560
We'll put a geyser here.

1959
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,960
Here, we can put this here.

1960
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,940
I can't name it!

1961
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:09,020
I was gonna name this Mintos Pits.

1962
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,380
Look at our...

1963
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,360
Look at our zoo.

1964
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:27,620
It's pretty fantastic, if I do say so myself.

1965
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,640
It's pretty incredible, actually.

1966
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,200
I think I have what it takes to run a real zoo.

1967
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,680
I'm just saying.

1968
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,140
Okay, let's put our next guy... What should we do next?

1969
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:40,420
Oh.

1970
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,800
On the other... Oh, we have a stegosaurus!

1971
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,200
Stegosaurus time, baby.

1972
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,720
So easy.

1973
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,580
I know!

1974
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,720
That's what I'm saying.

1975
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:52,820
We're gonna do a stegosaurus.

1976
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,420
These guys are pretty chill.

1977
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,480
We only need...

1978
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,340
Oh, this one can work too, right?

1979
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,580
These guys are so chill, we just need something like this.

1980
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,660
They won't get out.

1981
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,640
I mean, what if I even just did this?

1982
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,020
They're so chill.

1983
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,760
I'm gonna test it.

1984
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,620
Nope, that's a monkey.

1985
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,160
Scientists, get in there.

1986
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:34,340
How chill are these guys?

1987
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:40,040
How chill are these guys?

1988
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,960
Stegosaurus petting zoo.

1989
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:42,360
Yeah!

1990
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,880
They're just chill enough.

1991
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,860
They're literally herbivores.

1992
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:49,920
It's fine.

1993
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,880
It's so fine.

1994
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,100
I'm gonna get...

1995
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,880
We'll get another tour guide.

1996
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,840
We'll get another maintenance worker.

1997
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,220
One more maintenance worker.

1998
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,600
Scientists.

1999
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,600
And scientists...

2000
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,500
Yeah, you go to the...

2001
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,020
I'll put you there.

2002
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:15,900
Doesn't have the nostalgia factor of this game, but you might like Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster.

2003
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,040
Maybe.

2004
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,480
Current duty going to human.

2005
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:22,860
What?

2006
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,040
What do you mean by that?

2007
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:27,800
What?

2008
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,320
Huh?

2009
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:30,440
Huh?

2010
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,560
Let's just... Okay.

2011
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,100
All of our animals have food.

2012
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,620
When is he gonna hatch?

2013
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,860
You can hear the toilet.

2014
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:03,820
You want me to zoom in?

2015
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:05,720
There you go.

2016
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,500
Damn, this is a busy restroom.

2017
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,760
That's what's going on in there.

2018
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,080
Here, I'll build a second one right next to it.

2019
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:21,920
Oink, oink, oink.

2020
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,180
Oh, see?

2021
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,600
There's like so many other cool things.

2022
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,800
Oh, there's a dinosaur gift shop.

2023
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,000
Wait, is that what it is?

2024
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:28,960
Dinosaur gift shop.

2025
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,560
Oh, this thing is huge.

2026
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:33,180
It doesn't look like a dinosaur gift shop.

2027
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,780
I thought we already built the dinosaur gift shop.

2028
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,520
What is this then?

2029
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,900
Oh, kid's dinosaur gift shop.

2030
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,040
Okay.

2031
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,460
Come on, hurry it up.

2032
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,000
Yippee!

2033
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,360
Yippee!

2034
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,220
What else we got?

2035
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,800
What's some new animals we got, baby?

2036
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,660
We got a hyena.

2037
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,320
We got a Siberian tiger.

2038
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:06,480
We've got a Bigfoot!

2039
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,800
We got a mandrill.

2040
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,540
Multiple monkeys.

2041
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:17,120
We've got a Jaguar.

2042
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,280
Jaguar.

2043
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,640
Jaguar.

2044
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,900
I think I misplaced my switch controller.

2045
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:26,780
Can you use your supernatural maid powers to tell me where it is?

2046
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,860
I think it's probably behind your bed.

2047
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:43,820
Okay.

2048
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:45,100
There he goes!

2049
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,530
There he goes!

2050
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:55,670
Uh oh.

2051
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,610
Hey Stegosaurus, I'm gonna pick you up.

2052
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:00,190
Oh no!

2053
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,850
He's fine again.

2054
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:08,410
He's back in his little exhibit.

2055
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,170
Everything's okay.

2056
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:11,710
He's chilling.

2057
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:13,970
He's good.

2058
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:14,770
He's doing well.

2059
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:16,010
He's doing well.

2060
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:18,670
See?

2061
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:19,910
Easy.

2062
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:22,590
Don't do it!

2063
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:27,170
Our rating just plummeted.

2064
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:29,530
Okay, fine.

2065
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:30,450
Goodbye, Stegosaurus.

2066
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,350
Where's Stegosaurus?

2067
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,540
What a silly guy.

2068
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,080
Right!

2069
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,600
Craziness.

2070
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,100
Okay, our zoo rating is going back up.

2071
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:48,900
Oh!

2072
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,020
Yikes.

2073
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,660
Where are these guys going?

2074
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,760
Where are you going, actually?

2075
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,060
You're monitoring the zoo?

2076
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,480
Maybe do that over here.

2077
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,220
Okay, thank you.

2078
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:03,760
And you?

2079
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,520
What are you doing?

2080
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,460
You are monitoring... Okay, you're getting fired.

2081
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,300
See ya!

2082
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,180
Zoo recession?

2083
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:14,600
No!

2084
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,800
Okay, this one should be fine though.

2085
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,920
Okay, I'm just gonna...

2086
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,280
We're gonna do it like this.

2087
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,700
And we're gonna make the people climb.

2088
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,040
We're gonna make them work for this exhibit.

2089
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,080
It's not the most interesting.

2090
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,340
Here, we'll give a little pizzazz.

2091
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,200
Like that.

2092
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,960
There we go.

2093
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,680
This is the Stegosaurus.

2094
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,080
Oh wait, I forgot to name it Stegosaurus.

2095
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:43,240
Stegosaurus.

2096
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:55,300
And this guy...

2097
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,000
Here we go.

2098
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,800
I wonder when my guys are gonna give birth.

2099
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:00,860
You think they're happy?

2100
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:03,060
I wonder if I can see a little animal list.

2101
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:03,500
Let's see.

2102
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,180
Everybody seems...

2103
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:07,620
Alright.

2104
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,240
How are you doing?

2105
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:10,560
Yeah.

2106
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:12,220
Yeah.

2107
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,080
Wait, didn't we have another one?

2108
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:17,100
Another one?

2109
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,600
Oh my god, the problematic age gap.

2110
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,740
This guy's not an adult yet.

2111
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:26,340
Oh my god.

2112
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,030
The size difference.

2113
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:36,490
It's like his mom.

2114
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:39,910
Who said it would be fine?

2115
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:42,350
You said he was still year one.

2116
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,440
Not the Shodosaurus.

2117
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:54,760
No!

2118
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,040
Oh my god, no.

2119
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,660
Give him food, scientist!

2120
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,580
What are you doing?

2121
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,740
Is anyone going?

2122
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:07,580
Okay, here he goes.

2123
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,140
While he's busy, while we're waiting.

2124
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:13,400
Stegosaurus loves the coniferous forest.

2125
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,840
And they love the leopard...

2126
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:16,800
Don...

2127
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,640
Don...

2128
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,500
Don tree.

2129
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,200
Don tree.

2130
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,000
You think this will be too steep for them?

2131
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:36,100
You think they'll be like, My little legs can't handle the steepness.

2132
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,580
Yeah, that tree.

2133
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:43,260
Too much sand.

2134
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:49,190
Okay.

2135
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:49,810
Alright.

2136
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,510
And probably some fresh water.

2137
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:53,790
Like that, you know.

2138
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:56,050
Probably a little hideaway.

2139
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:58,830
What does a Stegosaurus hide away in?

2140
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:00,290
Oh!

2141
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:05,870
When did I get so low on money?

2142
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:07,690
Uh oh.

2143
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,630
Uh.

2144
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:10,870
Uh oh.

2145
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,930
Uh oh.

2146
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:16,650
Do you think they would be that, or the crawl one?

2147
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:18,010
This one.

2148
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:21,970
Small Stegosaurus.

2149
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:23,350
Stegosaurus are kind of big.

2150
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,470
Okay, we need people to come to our zoo.

2151
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:29,110
Stat?

2152
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:33,350
Um.

2153
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:36,130
Uh.

2154
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:38,590
Probably this one, right?

2155
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:39,830
Oh gosh.

2156
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:41,510
We don't have a lot of money.

2157
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,590
Okay, I'm just gonna have to, uh.

2158
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:44,870
This is the tree they love.

2159
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:46,990
We can put a couple in.

2160
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:50,110
Maybe like this one?

2161
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:50,830
No.

2162
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:52,350
What's a really tall one?

2163
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:52,930
This one maybe.

2164
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:54,370
Okay.

2165
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,050
This is good, this is good.

2166
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,550
And then some rocks.

2167
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:58,330
Oh, pine bush.

2168
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:02,290
We're just, we're just guessing.

2169
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:03,410
Based on vibes.

2170
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:08,150
This is purely vibe, vibe, vibe based.

2171
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:11,810
Oh no!

2172
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,890
I'm, oh my gosh, I'm like in the red.

2173
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,010
Oh my god.

2174
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,290
Oh my god.

2175
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:17,330
Oh my god!

2176
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,920
Not enough trees.

2177
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,160
Can I build a pathway?

2178
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:32,100
So people will come and view said animal.

2179
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:37,270
Okay.

2180
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:38,650
I don't have enough money.

2181
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,290
I think I need to have fire some people.

2182
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:43,210
Um.

2183
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:45,150
Where's my staff list?

2184
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:45,530
Everybody?

2185
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:49,310
Guys, oh, Scientist 1, Tour Guide 1.

2186
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:51,710
We have fallen on some hard, hard times.

2187
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:58,230
Tour Guide 2, you just have not been getting the ratings.

2188
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:01,050
You have just not been meeting expectations.

2189
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:01,470
I'm sorry.

2190
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:02,450
You need to go.

2191
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:02,830
Yes.

2192
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:05,330
Uh, Maintenance Worker number 4.

2193
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,390
We don't even, we only have two bathrooms.

2194
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,230
Quite honestly.

2195
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,890
Please leave the premises.

2196
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:13,230
Uh, Scientist 4.

2197
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:15,590
You, what the fuck are you doing?

2198
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:16,930
I just said get out of here.

2199
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:22,110
And now we should have more money.

2200
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:27,710
Unassigned staff?

2201
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:28,830
Wait.

2202
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:31,130
Why do we have so many people unassigned?

2203
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,670
I don't think we need tour guides after all.

2204
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:37,090
It's not even that big of a zoo.

2205
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:39,010
Okay.

2206
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:39,630
Brother.

2207
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:42,990
Oh my god, we're not even going to be able to pay you at this point.

2208
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:45,090
Oh my god.

2209
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:49,710
Five dollars for a plushie?

2210
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:50,730
Sorry everybody.

2211
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:53,470
Eight dollars.

2212
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,010
What is this place called?

2213
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:59,270
Oh, I thought it was called Kino Gift Shop.

2214
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:01,210
Cause kids and dino.

2215
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:01,270
No.

2216
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,310
Kino Gift Shop.

2217
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:13,350
They combined in my brain.

2218
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:18,610
Psychotosaurus 2 hatched!

2219
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:19,730
We have more.

2220
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:23,490
Do we have anyone viewing them?

2221
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:24,270
Okay, what?

2222
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:25,150
Are you happy?

2223
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:26,790
Oh, he's quite happy.

2224
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:27,990
Oh, he's not quite happy.

2225
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:28,970
Not enough dirt.

2226
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,110
Does not like the cave.

2227
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:33,290
You know what, that's great actually for us.

2228
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,910
Get this shit out of here.

2229
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:37,130
Thank you $1,000 baby.

2230
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:40,670
Dino plushie please.

2231
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:42,890
Thank you Kuya, thank you.

2232
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,890
Thank you Kuya, thank you.

2233
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,570
Oh my gosh.

2234
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:50,190
Some more dirt.

2235
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:57,770
This is very expensive dirt.

2236
01:42:57,770 --> 01:42:59,710
Please understand, Stegosaurus.

2237
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:01,550
Please understand.

2238
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:05,810
Too much coniferous, not enough grass.

2239
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:07,430
More animals?

2240
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:10,050
That's too steep.

2241
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:11,450
Does that cost money?

2242
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,500
Does it cost money to lower?

2243
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:19,820
No, okay.

2244
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:26,170
No, we're good I think.

2245
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,390
I think.

2246
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:32,690
They crave the grass.

2247
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:34,530
We'll give it to them.

2248
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:35,470
We'll give it to them.

2249
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,110
They'll get grass.

2250
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:39,690
They'll get grass.

2251
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:40,910
They'll get it.

2252
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:46,790
I went to Keno gift shop, but there's actually no Keno to be found.

2253
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:48,670
Just plushies of dinosaurs.

2254
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,170
What is a Keno?

2255
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:56,090
I've seen people use it, but I don't know what it means actually.

2256
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:59,410
I thought it was like the cinema, right?

2257
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:06,230
Oh no, too much.

2258
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:07,610
Okay, good now.

2259
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:09,710
It's like cinema, okay.

2260
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:10,690
It's like a masterpiece.

2261
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:11,710
What are you saying?

2262
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:13,470
My gift shop is not a masterpiece?

2263
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:15,830
You saying that?

2264
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:17,610
Not enough funds?

2265
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:18,890
Oh no.

2266
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,060
Oh, they like that though.

2267
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,580
Actually, they like that a lot.

2268
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:26,780
They want more grass.

2269
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:37,020
You guys just might not be...

2270
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,640
Oh no, they're knocking everything over.

2271
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,180
Oh my god, no!

2272
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,160
All of my trees!

2273
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,160
You know how much these cost me?

2274
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:44,500
You sons of bitches!

2275
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,040
What else do you not like?

2276
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:52,700
Does not like the rubble.

2277
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,300
There's more?

2278
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,140
What else did you knock over?

2279
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,320
I don't see any more rubble.

2280
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,380
You're making money again.

2281
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:05,960
Am I?

2282
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,260
Where's the rubble?

2283
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,060
Can the visitors see this exhibit?

2284
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:17,080
I don't know why they have no problem walking all the way the fuck over here.

2285
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,180
Look at this!

2286
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,340
But they won't walk over here.

2287
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:21,700
I don't understand.

2288
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:26,200
I don't get it.

2289
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,360
It's not like the rubble.

2290
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,500
Where's more rubble?

2291
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,680
Oh, undo.

2292
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,440
I'm working on it.

2293
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,040
Oh, there it is.

2294
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,020
I'm trying.

2295
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:45,820
I'm trying.

2296
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,220
Oops.

2297
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:53,920
Okay, we might have enough money to lower some of this.

2298
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:07,220
That should be a bit better.

2299
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,100
They want more guys.

2300
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,520
You can hide trees behind rocks to prevent...

2301
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,700
But they obviously don't like it though, right?

2302
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:21,880
I think these guys are totally happy now.

2303
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,100
They don't want to break out anymore.

2304
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:29,280
They don't care that the stegosaurus are absolutely just...

2305
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:29,900
Oh, never mind.

2306
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,020
But look, he's overjoyed.

2307
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:36,860
Chuu!

2308
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:48,110
That's not mine!

2309
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:51,850
Oh my god, we're so in the red.

2310
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:53,330
Oh my god, what's happening?

2311
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:55,150
Why are we so in debt?

2312
01:46:58,770 --> 01:46:59,250
Guys?

2313
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:01,710
Guys?

2314
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:04,050
Why are we in debt?

2315
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,070
Oh, I think I need to raise the prices of the zoo.

2316
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:18,440
You guys are coming for dinosaurs.

2317
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:21,080
Like, get over yourselves.

2318
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:23,380
Look how many people are here.

2319
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,840
Hot dogs stay the same price.

2320
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:27,480
But cotton candy...

2321
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,220
Oh, nope, nope, nope.

2322
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:29,960
Three bucks.

2323
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,440
Ten dollars.

2324
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:35,280
For a plushie.

2325
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,600
It's worth, everybody, it's worth it.

2326
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,760
It's a panda.

2327
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,300
We don't even have pandas here.

2328
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:43,500
Crushed ice?

2329
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,720
This is starting to feel like a real zoo.

2330
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:54,300
Ten thousand people will pay it?

2331
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:54,580
Really?

2332
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,540
Even guests?

2333
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,120
Oh my gosh, guest 400!

2334
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:00,340
What do you think, guest 400?

2335
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:00,540
Oh my god.

2336
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:13,800
Empty-headed.

2337
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,100
Here, come look at this.

2338
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,720
Come look at this stegosaurus.

2339
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:19,820
Come look, come look.

2340
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,060
What do you think of that?

2341
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,360
What do you think about that guy?

2342
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,220
Really cool, huh?

2343
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,780
There she goes.

2344
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,840
When will we make money again?

2345
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:37,250
Charge to use the toilets?

2346
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:38,830
I can't do that.

2347
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,270
It won't let me.

2348
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:42,890
Otherwise, I totally would.

2349
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:50,860
Hot dogs!

2350
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,940
Get your hot dogs!

2351
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,460
$1.50 hot dog.

2352
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,320
Cheap, cheap, cheap hot dogs.

2353
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:57,860
I have no money.

2354
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,920
Funding has stopped for all programs.

2355
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,180
Guys, I have to go.

2356
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:03,380
Just a little ghosties room.

2357
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:06,540
So...

2358
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,800
Just keep my zoo...

2359
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,500
Cheer when I get money.

2360
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,900
I'm gonna let the zoo just run on its own, okay?

2361
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:16,740
Who do you wanna watch?

2362
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:18,820
Do you wanna watch these guys?

2363
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,380
Do you wanna watch these guys?

2364
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:22,880
Which do you wanna watch?

2365
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:24,660
Do you wanna watch these guys?

2366
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:25,500
Which do you wanna watch?

2367
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,120
Where'd that other guest go?

2368
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:39,040
The gators are coming, by the way.

2369
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:40,300
Oh, there she is.

2370
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:41,780
What is she...

2371
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:43,440
Still no thoughts.

2372
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:45,960
Lava pit.

2373
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,740
Okay, I'll let you watch the lava pit.

2374
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,040
There you go.

2375
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,180
Okay, I'll be right back.

2376
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:53,840
I'll be right back.

2377
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:56,180
Little ghosties room for me.

2378
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:06,910
Okay, guys.

2379
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:08,070
I haven't looked yet.

2380
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:09,870
But how much money have we made?

2381
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:11,570
I haven't looked yet.

2382
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:12,790
I haven't looked yet.

2383
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:14,950
I haven't looked yet.

2384
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:16,410
I haven't looked yet.

2385
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:19,450
I haven't looked yet.

2386
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:36,590
Grasshoppers existed since 20 million years ago.

2387
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:39,710
Where did they hop for 55 million years?

2388
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:40,790
Wait.

2389
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:44,430
Grasshoppers existed since 145 million years ago.

2390
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:47,470
But grasshoppers existed since 200 million years ago.

2391
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:51,030
What?

2392
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:54,130
Then who...

2393
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:54,710
Wait.

2394
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:58,710
Then who named them grasshoppers?

2395
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:00,230
Wait.

2396
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:04,110
So they were...

2397
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:07,830
It must have been a time traveler.

2398
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:12,110
A time traveler...

2399
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,310
Technology unlocked.

2400
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:14,970
Pay toilets.

2401
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:15,430
No way.

2402
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:15,730
Really?

2403
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,030
Don't lie to me.

2404
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:25,030
A time traveler went back and was...

2405
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:25,670
Oh my god.

2406
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:26,870
Another one?

2407
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:27,730
Oh my gosh.

2408
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:29,170
Wait.

2409
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:30,550
Which one did he made with?

2410
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:34,350
Which one?

2411
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:35,470
Which one made it?

2412
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:38,070
We have to sell the other one.

2413
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:38,750
The weaker one.

2414
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:42,630
Uh-oh.

2415
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:45,430
It's dying.

2416
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:48,670
You guys, we're getting out of debt.

2417
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:49,790
We're getting out of debt.

2418
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:53,330
I know you're not happy, but like...

2419
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:54,590
Guest 400 loves you.

2420
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:56,750
I'm guessing that's Guest 400.

2421
01:54:58,090 --> 01:54:58,490
Yeah!

2422
01:54:58,890 --> 01:54:59,610
Oh, they're hungry.

2423
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:02,810
You should spend money on a hotdog.

2424
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:04,750
Maybe like 50 of them.

2425
01:55:07,530 --> 01:55:08,390
Where are you going?

2426
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:10,070
No, the hotdog's right there!

2427
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:11,270
Guest 400!

2428
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:14,010
You're so stupid.

2429
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:16,630
Kendo gift shop.

2430
01:55:17,290 --> 01:55:19,670
Makes only a profit of 100 dollars.

2431
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:22,370
More hotdog.

2432
01:55:22,990 --> 01:55:24,050
I can't spend...

2433
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:24,650
600!

2434
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:24,790
600!

2435
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:30,450
Niki has such a cute and happy pee face.

2436
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:38,810
Look how big they are.

2437
01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:43,090
Guys, I'm scared for our dinosaurs.

2438
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:44,910
We're almost out of the red!

2439
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:47,150
Oh my gosh, we're almost out of the red for real.

2440
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:49,670
We're almost out of the red for real.

2441
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:54,590
I think we gotta kill Plessio.

2442
01:55:56,970 --> 01:55:57,850
Oh, sorry.

2443
01:55:58,030 --> 01:55:58,410
Platty.

2444
01:55:58,650 --> 01:55:59,650
Not Plessiosaurus.

2445
01:55:59,830 --> 01:56:00,350
I'm stupid.

2446
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:03,130
Like this guy.

2447
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:04,510
Popcorn, please.

2448
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:05,890
I don't sell that here!

2449
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:09,750
No!

2450
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:10,550
No!

2451
01:56:10,850 --> 01:56:11,370
No!

2452
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:13,230
Stop paying the people!

2453
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:14,010
Please.

2454
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:14,970
Please.

2455
01:56:15,670 --> 01:56:17,170
Please stop paying the people.

2456
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:17,790
Okay, you know what?

2457
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:18,750
Get rid of the Stegosaurus.

2458
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:20,650
They're not happy.

2459
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:21,850
They hate it here.

2460
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:22,830
I hate them.

2461
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:23,870
Please go away.

2462
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:28,370
You ruined my exhibits!

2463
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:31,270
Get out of here.

2464
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:34,250
I'll bring you back when the time is right.

2465
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:36,370
The time is not right.

2466
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,510
We need our money back.

2467
01:56:38,910 --> 01:56:39,910
We need our money back!

2468
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:42,750
Okay!

2469
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:49,140
Oh my god, imagine that happening.

2470
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,580
These guys are huge now.

2471
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,100
These guys are so big.

2472
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,020
It is not big enough.

2473
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:22,250
What about for this one?

2474
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:24,070
Oh no!

2475
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:25,270
Oh no!

2476
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:28,250
And you want a kid?

2477
01:57:28,330 --> 01:57:29,410
Oh my god, it's born!

2478
01:57:30,190 --> 01:57:31,130
Oh my god, okay.

2479
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,360
Oh no!

2480
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:39,280
Oh no!

2481
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,040
I'm sure all my favorite Stegosaurus are doing well.

2482
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:42,700
No!

2483
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,040
We can fix this.

2484
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,680
Everybody?

2485
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:01,200
Everybody?

2486
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:07,730
What the hell?

2487
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:11,250
Why is Santa Claus in my park?

2488
01:58:12,270 --> 01:58:12,970
Shoot him!

2489
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:14,370
Shoot him down!

2490
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:16,810
What the hell are you doing here, Santa?

2491
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:17,730
Pay up!

2492
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:19,110
You're on my property!

2493
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:21,430
You need to pay the admission fee!

2494
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:33,690
Okay, alright guys.

2495
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:40,700
This is so sad.

2496
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,540
This is so sad.

2497
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:47,320
But it's okay, because...

2498
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:51,300
The visitors aren't gonna know what hit them.

2499
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:53,060
Look at that.

2500
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:54,560
We have so much more room now.

2501
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,400
Okay, are you ready for this?

2502
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:57,480
Sell all the staff!

2503
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,760
Sell them off!

2504
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,160
No new hires!

2505
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,880
No new hires.

2506
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:03,600
Scientists?

2507
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,400
You have nothing to do?

2508
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:06,660
You're getting out of here.

2509
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,380
You're monitoring the zoo?

2510
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,160
Get out of here!

2511
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,280
Maintenance worker one?

2512
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:13,460
Going to clean up?

2513
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:13,740
Okay.

2514
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:15,240
Monitoring zoo?

2515
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:15,960
Get out of here!

2516
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:24,300
Let's see.

2517
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,640
Where should we release the beast?

2518
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:33,340
Can I just release them, even if they don't have a cage?

2519
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,060
Okay, I can't do that.

2520
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:40,480
But all I have to do is make a teeny tiny cage.

2521
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,240
And then, we'll release the beast.

2522
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:49,900
I just realized that there were different things.

2523
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:52,120
See, this would be perfect.

2524
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,180
Zoo tycoon!

2525
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:00,820
Oh, what the heck?

2526
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:10,260
This zoo is just absolutely a failure.

2527
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:11,940
A massive failure, everybody.

2528
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:13,940
And I apologize on my part.

2529
02:00:18,110 --> 02:00:22,110
I apologize for my recklessness.

2530
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:35,390
I apologize for thinking that I could turn this into the world's best zoo.

2531
02:00:37,130 --> 02:00:39,230
I have a lot of thirsty guests.

2532
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:42,450
Are you guys in the park?

2533
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:48,870
But I will go down with my ship.

2534
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:52,030
And that's why I say...

2535
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:56,810
Be free.

2536
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:06,220
To the humans!

2537
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:10,680
Do you think they know yet?

2538
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,520
Do you think they know yet?

2539
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:15,440
Okay, they're gonna get there eventually.

2540
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:21,440
Okay, they don't know what's coming for them.

2541
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:23,880
Block the gate.

2542
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:24,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2543
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:25,380
Thank you, thank you.

2544
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:26,380
Block the gate.

2545
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:27,960
Block the gate.

2546
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:30,140
Pause.

2547
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:41,690
Humans.

2548
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:11,340
Okay, guys.

2549
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,920
Guys, maybe go this way.

2550
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,240
This way, this way.

2551
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,180
Maybe I should make a pathway for them.

2552
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:18,180
Hold on.

2553
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:20,180
Let's make a little salt water...

2554
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:21,340
They like salt water.

2555
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,820
This is salt water crocodiles, right?

2556
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:23,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2557
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,400
That's fine.

2558
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:31,860
Don't worry about it.

2559
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:33,440
Wait, is that salt?

2560
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,680
I don't think that's salt water.

2561
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:40,080
This way!

2562
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,660
This way!

2563
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:43,660
This way!

2564
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:53,100
Cooking?

2565
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:56,160
Barn owls existed 45 million years ago.

2566
02:02:56,380 --> 02:02:58,060
Barns have existed for 800 years.

2567
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:02,500
I'm gonna leave Minky's wild zoo.

2568
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:03,200
No, no, no!

2569
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:03,900
There's no escape!

2570
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,720
Oh, what?

2571
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,060
They're all just swimming in the water.

2572
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:14,440
Guys, it was a massive failure.

2573
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:22,460
This is why we have plan B.

2574
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,300
Run!

2575
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:36,620
Run!

2576
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:40,400
Run!

2577
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,020
All these people are acting mighty calm.

2578
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,000
Everybody here.

2579
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:47,580
This guy is literally running into the fray.

2580
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,560
I love the lag.

2581
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,720
That's my favorite part.

2582
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:52,820
Where's our other guy?

2583
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:54,760
Get out of there!

2584
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:56,180
No!

2585
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:57,920
It's no time to be sad.

2586
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:01,300
Actually, turn your sadness into anger!

2587
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,240
Turn your sadness into distraction!

2588
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,600
Oh my god!

2589
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:07,780
Oh my god!

2590
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:27,550
Why are you angry?

2591
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:31,730
They have no thoughts.

2592
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:33,410
But they're angry about something.

2593
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:39,090
Today's activity is survive.

2594
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:42,470
They're still thirsty.

2595
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:43,950
Despite it all.

2596
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:45,130
I'm leaving the zoo.

2597
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:46,630
Animals are running free.

2598
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:48,010
I don't like the zoo at all.

2599
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:49,910
I'm going to an amusement park.

2600
02:04:53,210 --> 02:04:54,030
Oh my god.

2601
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:55,810
He's going for it.

2602
02:04:55,810 --> 02:04:57,130
Get him, chat!

2603
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:57,710
Get him!

2604
02:04:58,490 --> 02:04:59,450
Get him, chat!

2605
02:04:59,570 --> 02:05:00,050
Get him!

2606
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:01,570
Where's the other guy?

2607
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:05,870
The scientist is so chill.

2608
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:08,990
What did he just do?

2609
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:11,070
Oh my god!

2610
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:13,170
He took out the Velociraptor statue!

2611
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,100
Maintenance worker?

2612
02:05:21,820 --> 02:05:23,100
This guy has...

2613
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:24,380
He's like...

2614
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:28,240
I'm getting paid at least.

2615
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:33,080
Well...

2616
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,440
This is just...

2617
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,600
What do you mean you can't find any food?

2618
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:39,460
Go to the entrance!

2619
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:49,650
The lag is so bad.

2620
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:50,910
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2621
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:52,810
Oh yeah!

2622
02:05:54,730 --> 02:05:55,770
Oh yeah!

2623
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:01,810
Who's screaming?

2624
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:05,690
Oh my god.

2625
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:10,260
Oh god.

2626
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:26,780
Beautiful.

2627
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:30,200
How's our crocodiles doing?

2628
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,060
They're so chill.

2629
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:34,080
They're like...

2630
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,940
We're literally just crocodiles in the water.

2631
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:39,760
Oh,

2632
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
you weren't in the water.

2633
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,620
But it showed you were in the water.

2634
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:47,420
What about this guy?

2635
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:49,600
The way they run is pretty freaky.

2636
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:49,840
Look!

2637
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,220
He was in the water.

2638
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,440
What a bust.

2639
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:09,120
Man, in two years we ran this place into the ground.

2640
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,660
Look, he's laying down.

2641
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:11,560
It's so cute.

2642
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:15,780
I know it's because he's unhappy, but...

2643
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:21,540
We couldn't even make it one whole year.

2644
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:26,140
January 30th, everybody remembers.

2645
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:30,180
In 15 days, everyone will remember.

2646
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:34,460
What's our zoo name?

2647
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:45,430
The experience.

2648
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:46,250
It's the experience.

2649
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:49,210
It's the experience.

2650
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:53,850
Everybody will remember what happened.

2651
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:55,650
Everybody will remember.

2652
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:57,350
The experience.

2653
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:02,850
Okay, let's quit.

2654
02:08:03,650 --> 02:08:04,010
Boo!

2655
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:05,730
Wait, how do I get here?

2656
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:24,160
I know it's a bit of a shorter stream, but...

2657
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:26,160
In the efforts to preserve my voice...

2658
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,320
I think I might...

2659
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:28,460
Get here.

2660
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,780
I would like to do more Zoo Tycoon.

2661
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,660
I want to do it.

2662
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:35,740
I was actually trying.

2663
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:36,880
That's what's so frustrating.

2664
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:40,240
I actually was trying to have...

2665
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:41,480
A legitimate...

2666
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:44,660
A legitimate...

2667
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:46,180
Zoo experience.

2668
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,860
Where we would make the best zoo.

2669
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:48,800
And then...

2670
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:50,840
Have it all go to shit.

2671
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,340
But instead, we didn't even make it a year.

2672
02:08:58,220 --> 02:08:59,820
Business ownership too hard.

2673
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:00,280
Right?

2674
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:07,080
I know a lot of people are saying Planet Zoo.

2675
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:09,440
So maybe we will try that.

2676
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:11,040
A lot of people are saying about it.

2677
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,040
But this one I wanted to definitely play for the...

2678
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:18,480
Nostalgia, you know?

2679
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,560
Speaking of Microsoft games...

2680
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:23,140
Are you playing Microsoft Flight Simulator?

2681
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,120
Someday I would like to.

2682
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:25,320
Yeah.

2683
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:27,760
Thanks for playing this game.

2684
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:29,620
Thank you for watching this game.

2685
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,220
Thanks Abby.

2686
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:31,380
Thanks for two months.

2687
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:32,460
Thanks for the streaming.

2688
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,460
I hope you feel better soon.

2689
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:38,280
After life finds a way.

2690
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:39,980
Yeah, sorry.

2691
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:41,940
Maybe Planet Zoo doesn't lag as much.

2692
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,720
Yeah, the lagging does kind of...

2693
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:45,820
Make it hard to play, right?

2694
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,940
New Aquarian series started?

2695
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:51,900
I don't even know about it.

2696
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:53,000
Aquarian Moe?

2697
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,320
I'm gonna look it up.

2698
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:00,570
I apologize though if...

2699
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,600
Some streams are shorter this...

2700
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,420
This...

2701
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:05,180
This week.

2702
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,480
Maybe some next week too.

2703
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:09,360
Did I miss much?

2704
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:10,460
Was doing work stuff.

2705
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,100
Yeah, missed it all.

2706
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:19,240
You missed it all.

2707
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:20,880
You missed when I got rid of...

2708
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,660
You missed when I showed my bare shoulders.

2709
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,120
Right everybody?

2710
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,800
I did that.

2711
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:36,540
Eventually.

2712
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:40,640
Yeah, of course.

2713
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:46,360
Anyway.

2714
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,140
Thank you guys.

2715
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,380
Sorry for the short stream.

2716
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,300
Have a good rest of your day or your night.

2717
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,280
And hopefully this was fun nostalgia.

2718
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,040
It was for me for sure.

2719
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,760
Such a blast from the past.

2720
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:00,080
Yeah!

2721
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,260
Thank you guys.

2722
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:06,500
Bye bye.

2723
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:09,060
Bye bye.
