1
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,010
Wait a second.

2
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,250
Oh, that's the game.

3
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,970
And that's me.

4
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,510
Oh,

5
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,810
my windows are messed up.

6
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,920
There we go.

7
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,800
I think.

8
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,460
That's a bit better.

9
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Maybe.

10
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,140
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

11
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,840
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome in, wait.

12
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,130
Is that me or the kid?

13
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,650
That's me.

14
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,190
Not the kid.

15
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm making sure that the size is not cut off a little bit on
the bottom.

16
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,580
Okay, anyway.

17
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,040
Whatever.

18
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,900
It's fine.

19
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,600
We're okay.

20
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,420
We're okay.

21
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,900
Domenclor.

22
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
I think that's a new one.

23
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,100
Hi.

24
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:57,800
Hi.

25
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,500
Hi.

26
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,340
Hello, Eve funds.

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,440
Oh, thank you!

28
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,640
Thanks, Murphy.

29
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,660
What do you think of Murphy for?

30
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,960
Mito-chan, kawaii-yata!

31
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,400
Thank you!

32
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,640
Oh, did you guys see my holy...

33
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,060
My Japanese has regressed so bad.

34
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,080
I can't...

35
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,280
Well, I also was so...

36
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,220
tired.

37
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,600
Jurassic!

38
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,080
Happy birthday!

39
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,400
Happy, happy birthday!

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,020
Happy birthday!

41
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:51,020
Announced today on Ayami Mama's stream, we have Ayami to
Ayami family collab cafe!

42
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,400
Yata!

43
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,940
Yippee!

44
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:09,240
So, the collab We'll be running from the 7th to the 20th, I
think.

45
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,680
Pachi, pachi, pachi, I can't wait to go to you and a yummy
cafe again.

46
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, thank you.

47
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,280
So that was the gloop bloop.

48
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,420
Yes, it was.

49
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,260
And so unfortunately I can't put up the graphic right now.

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,820
But yeah, same place.

51
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,840
Gameplayers.

52
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,140
Hello, Minto, and I booze like you!

53
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,300
If the YouTube crashes, I fear you will have to stream via
carrier pigeon.

54
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,580
I will send to each and every one of you what I am doing.

55
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,260
How much Eve can we harvest from Minto?

56
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,860
Going to sleep!

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,780
I can't wait to watch the mod.

58
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,840
Good night!

59
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,560
Good night, good night.

60
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,700
Thank you, Brandon.

61
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,280
Good night.

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,940
What was I gonna say?

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,860
Oh, I meant to like...

64
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,160
Oh my god, okay, so...

65
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,500
I kind of mentioned this before, previous stream, but like,
I'm not used to these types of games, right?

66
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,460
Like, I don't do FPS very often.

67
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,780
They actually quite stress me out.

68
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,110
They actually quite stress me out, but... So I feel like...

69
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,060
Sometimes I'm like, I want to play, but I don't want to
play, you know what I mean?

70
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,680
It's not like me forcing... Well, it's a little bit me
forcing myself.

71
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:39,200
But, you know, at the same time I won't get used to the
games if I don't try them so you know it's kind of so you

72
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:52,000
know I've appreciate your patience with me as I as I tackle
Bioshock it's a pretty stressful game be brave Minto thank

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,920
you yeah especially because it's like a lot of switching
around stuff i i'm meant to practice a little bit um neil

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,960
It's not enough.

78
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,180
You!

79
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,740

Do it!

82
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,280

83
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,720
Do it!

84
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,550
Crank that.

85
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,810
I had it to 10.

86
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,430
Now I need to adjust my settings.

87
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,790
There's a ghost in the stream.

88
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,790
Happy National Chocolate Meat Day!

89
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:21,630
Actually, I don't know if it's a national fake meat because
I saw also a Japanese hashtag for...

90
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,470
I almost said national for Chocolate Mint Day.

91
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,070
So I think it is international Chocolate Mint Day.

92
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,190
Also, did you see the new Spinosaurus news?

93
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,890
Oh my gosh, yes I did.

94
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,930
Did you guys see that they discovered a different, like...

95
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,030
Species of Spinosaurus.

96
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,010
This guy has a bigger horn than the others.

97
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,230
It's like 20 inches long.

98
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,010
And he was discovered more inland.

99
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:58,190
So it kind of is like this guy, this guy isn't probably
searching for fish and stuff in the, you know, he's walking

100
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,810
around.

101
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,850
I don't know, eating bugs, who knows.

102
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,110
Yeah, new Spinosaurus.

103
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,250
New dino dropped?

104
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,710
I know.

105
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,930
We got the newest dino patch.

106
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,330
It's awesome.

107
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,070
Oh, facts.

108
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,910
Who cares about that?

109
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,770
Nerd, says Dr. Tyrannosaur.

110
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:32,830
Yeah.

111
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,210
You wouldn't.

112
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,970
You wouldn't.

113
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,630
Unicorn dino.

114
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,390
Come back next week for more Dino News.

115
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,850
Happy Chocobito Day!

116
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,550
I went to get new Costco chocolate mint Sunday and it was
delightful!

117
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,310
Truly, you are everywhere.

118
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,430
I want to try it.

119
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,270
You don't need to have a Costco membership to get the food,
right?

120
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,510
You can just walk on in.

121
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:05,590
I think?

122
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,590
Stream alerts off.

123
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,330
Oh, they might be...

124
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:09,830
Oh, sorry.

125
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,890
I had them off.

126
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,550
Hold on, one moment.

127
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,590
I turned them off for when I was recording.

128
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,330
Yesterday.

129
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,850
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

130
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,630
Also, Ducky, thank you.

131
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,230
Happy National Chocolate Minto Day.

132
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,970
Why can't I say chocolate normally?

133
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,670
I was recording Portal 2 yesterday.

134
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,550
And, oh.

135
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,070
I did the first one as a member.

136
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,570
stream then i did the second one off stream i'm i'm letting
you guys know it's rough

137
00:10:49,170 --> 00:11:04,170
um part part six is is rough i i i don't know what happened
in my brain at all um i had a hard time on something that

138
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:11,950
was so it was so stupid i was like i don't know i don't know
i don't know Literally, I had to stop recording and take a

139
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,270
break.

140
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,930
And then while I was like sipping my tea, I was like, wait a
second.

141
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,190
Would if I, and then I solved it like in one shot right
after.

142
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,450
I was so angry.

143
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,230
I was so angry.

144
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,450
So classic gamer.

145
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,870
Oh gosh, I almost wanted to like, it was so bad.

146
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:51,350
I had to do like a, like a five five time well yeah five
time zoom on it and it's 100 worth it for the cake i felt i

147
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:59,750
wanted to i wanted to scrap the entire thing and redo it i
was so angry i was like you guys are gonna be anybody

148
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:11,240
watching is gonna be like girl oh it's it's rough i'm
telling you now it's it's not an easy one

149
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:24,740
because I'm literally I think out of the hour that I
recorded actually I had to go over because I couldn't get

150
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,160
the puzzle it's like 45 minutes

151
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:45,760
so I was like oh I feel so stupid I don't know sometimes you
know things just like really click with you and sometimes

152
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:53,040
like Even if it's like a simple solution, sometimes the
brain just does not work.

153
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh, geez.

154
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,580
Real ones won't skip.

155
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,940
No, it's okay.

156
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,760
You can skip.

157
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,220
I think I even put like a...

158
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Actually, I put like a...

159
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,000
Uh-oh.

163
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:44,340
like i don't know and then it was literally um so the puzzle
okay i'll just explain a little bit it's like a two-parter

164
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:52,780
puzzle i would say the first one part is quote unquote more
difficult than the second part and the second part is what i

165

It's red candy.

It's a quiz.

173
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,500
It's a quiz.

174
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,820
It's a quiz.

175
00:14:47,820 --> 00:15:01,680
It just told me what...

176
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,960
I only wanted the answer to the quiz.

177
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,770
It's in the shape of a heart.

178
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,170
Oh, no it's not.

179
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,190
I only got half of it.

180
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,710
I thought it...

181
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,350
Netamare!

182
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,830
Okay, I'm trying.

183
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,750
I'll tell you, I'll taste it and then I'll tell you what
flavor it is.

184
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,210
Whoa!

185
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,210
Whoa!

186
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,590
I taste it.

187
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,250
This is a strange flavor.

188
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,770
Mon Buran?

189
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,050
Do you guys know?

190
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,610
Hold on.

191
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,470
Wait, it's...

192
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,610
How... I only know...

193
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,410
I don't think I've ever had it in English.

194
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,290
This flavor.

195
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,810
Mon Buran.

196
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,840
The chestnut.

197
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,380
Yes.

198
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,960
Montblat.

199
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that one, that one.

200
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,180
It tastes just like it.

201
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,700
It looks like like it would be like a fruity...

202
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,480
This is so strange.

203
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,300
Okay,

204
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

205
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm sorry, I'm stalling.

206
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,600
Blonde is white in French.

207
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,260
Yes.

208
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
But what is the moon?

209
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,490
The color of the candy is red, though.

210
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,950
She's stalling us from greatness.

211
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,910
I'm sorry!

212
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,230
Mountain.

213
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,250
Mountain of white?

214
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,710
Chestnut?

215
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,770
Isn't this a stalling stream?

216
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,090
It is, it is!

217
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,090
White mountain.

218
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,800
Petals of white, but a mountain.

219
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,020
Mountain of white.

220
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,660
Mountain of white.

221
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,260
You know what?

222
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,340
Some people call my cheeks that...

223
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,340
This is your part to say.

224
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,000
Which cheeks?

225
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,040
Let's start the game.

226
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to get this out of my mouth.

227
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,100
It's okay.

228
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,520

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,570
That's where we got to go.

257
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,150
I wonder what movies they were watching.

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,750

Oh, I guess I didn't really need it.

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,730
Lots and sons.

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,910
Is anyone there?

264
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,330
Is that not a big, big daddy?

265
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,210
Our alert's still disabled.

266
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:51,690
What?

267
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,870
Wait, I turned them on one moment.

268
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,550
I know you're busy, but when you're able to check your
streamlight, oh, oh, oh.

271
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,930
That's my bad.

272
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,130

your flower stand.

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,900
I feel like I should get some Eve.

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,380
Eve.

What is this?

344
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,150
Engineering tonics.

345
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,230
Improve your ability to interact with the machines.

346
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,170
Spend that money.

347
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,130

348
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,790
I agree.

349
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,250
It's blue drink.

350
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,050
It's blue drink.

351
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,670
I have this telekinesis.

352
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,850
Wait, I thought I had a fire, wait.

353
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:17,930
Oh, here we go.

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,990
Incinerate.

355
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,150
Set objects and creatures on fire.

356
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,390
I think I wanna switch it out for that.

357
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,470
I don't know, I feel like I use these, you know.

358
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,790
Don't wait, incinerate.

359
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,990
It's free, right, to swap out?

360
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,250
Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby.

361
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,970
You have an empty slot that you could put, wait, I do?

362
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,590
What do you mean?

363
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,570
Oh, like here?

364
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,450
And I don't have anything else.

365
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,570
Don't lie to me.

366
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,670
There should be a mod that says, Feel Good after the circus
of value laughs.

367
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,610
Oh, feel good.

368
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,790
YouTube was censoring feel plus good together.

369
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,790
YouTube being more D-Gen than...

370
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,550
What?

371
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,710
That's crazy.

372
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,270
YouTube doesn't want your health.

373
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,750
All right.

374
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,290
All right.

375
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,150
This is to switch.

376
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,950
Let's get my gun out.

377
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,710
Put your gun, Ty.

378
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,570
Alright, alright, I'm gonna stop being a little baby now.

379
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,430
I'm scared though.

380
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,070
This game stresses me out.

381
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:21,970
I'm not gonna lie.

382
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,190
I mean, I know you guys have been saying that.

383
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,210
It's a stressful game.

384
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,530
Is that it?

385
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,470
Wait, I can't go back?

386
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,010
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

387
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,230
Oh, yes I can.

388
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,470
What if I'm too scared?

389
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,010
What if I'm too scared?

390
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,370
Look at all my...

391
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,190
Saves though.

392
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,830
I'll keep doing these because the game might crash.

393
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,090
Anyway.

394
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,470
I gotta remember how to play this.

395
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,790
91 days since our last accident.

396
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,210
Accidents last year.

397
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,650
Accidents this year.

398
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,390
2.

399
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,230
And a half maybe.

400
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,430
Oh my gosh.

401
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,170
The decor.

402
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,030
I'm surprised this guy isn't getting Ian by all the fishies.

403
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,670
Maybe he's nasty.

404
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,310
I don't believe this counter.

405
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,570
Something about it seems false.

406
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,010
What the?

407
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,990
Who was that?

408
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,370
Safety is everyone's responsibility.

409
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,230
Who was that?

410
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,620
A friend.

411
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,980
They're always friends.

412
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,940
They're always friends.

413
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,000
Wait, there's something shimmering up there.

414
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,980
Nothing?

415
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
Stingy?

416
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay.

417
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,260
Alright, we keep going.

418
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Wait.

419
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,480
What the days go by like wind?

420
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,240
Cool.

421
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,000
Cool.

422
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,500
Oh, this is where the baby!

423
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,920
This is where...

424
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
This is where Little Sister crawls through.

425
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,120
Oh, gosh.

426
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,180
How many...

427
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,760
This is Rapture.

428
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,560
The wonders of Andrew Ryan will change your life.

429
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,900
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

430
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,180
Not a horror game, by the way.

431
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,820
Totally not a horror game.

432
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Oh, let me...

433
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,960
Save.

434
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,240
Save.

435
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,540
Yeah, alright.

436
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,760
Do not turn off the computer.

437
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And we'll hack it.

438
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,390
Uh...

439
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,530
Uh,

440
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,150
we're zigzagging.

441
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,410
We're zigzagging.

442
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

443
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,110
Zigzagging.

444
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,910
Wait, uh, there we go.

445
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:06,770
Easy.

446
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,290
I don't need to heal though.

447
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,570
Oh, did it get smokier in here or is it just me?

448
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,210
Just me?

449
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,230
Wait, is it getting really smoky in here?

450
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:20,890
Wait.

451
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,570
Are we out?

452
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,250
Oh!

453
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,070
Oh!

454
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,990
I think she was looking at me.

455
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,250
Ooh, that ain't good.

456
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,090
Lower wharf.

457
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,610
Mccrack and crabs.

458
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,070
You gotta really love seafood to live here, huh?

459
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,490
What's that over there?

460
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,870
Oh, are you coming back?

461
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,330
Why?

462
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,690
Those are fish over there.

463
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:03,170
Oh, the girls are fighting.

464
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,230
Yeah, do it for me.

465
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:12,240
Oh, yeah, do it for me.

466
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,320
Oh, I think he died.

467
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,820
I think he's dead.

468
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,460
Hurry, Mr. Bubbles!

469
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,880
We're fine, right?

470
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,620
As long as I don't attack, everything's all good, right?

471
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,660
Right?

472
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,540
Anything in here?

473
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,830
Wait, what's that?

474
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,830
What's that meter?

475
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,070
What does that meter mean?

476
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,090
Do you guys see that?

477
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,470
Wait, is that his health?

478
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:57,810
Oh.

479
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,950
You remember this?

480
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,510
What's that mean?

481
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,170
I'm scared.

482
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,450
What does that mean?

483
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,270
You remember this.

484
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:11,730
Yummy.

485
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,850
Oh, I shouldn't have eaten them.

486
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:19,860
Hello?

487
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,560
Mr. Bubbles.

488
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,900
Is this a thing, though?

489
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,740
Oh.

490
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,040
Oh.

491
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,160
Oh.

492
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,900
Oh.

493
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,920
Somebody has a...

494
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,060
Um...

495
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,420
I don't know if I got him.

496
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,840
Oh, oh, oh, I thought I heard somebody behind me.

497
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,140
Wait, oh, this thing is gonna take off again.

Maybe I did?

502
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,360
Yes I did.

503
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:50,960
Nice.

504
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,360
Hack, hack, hack.

505
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,940
Wait, what did this do?

506
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,480
What the hell?

507
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:55,780
No.

508
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,220
No, no, no, no, no.

509
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,620
No hint.

510
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,360
Hack!

511
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,780
Oh, hack.

512
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,580
Oh, it's really hard.

513
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,460
Uh-oh.

514
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:05,840
Okay.

515
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,960
The H came up and it was like, are you stuck?

516
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:12,800
Dummy?

517
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,160
H for hack!

518
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,620
Alright, save.

519
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,080
Okay.

520
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,520
170.

521
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,960
Okay, hack, hack, hack.

522
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,100
Okay.

523
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,280
Alright.

524
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,820
I have a question.

525
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,380
Can they, like, I can hack them, but can they, like, reset
them, like, to be evil turrets?

526
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,520
Or are they forever friendly?

527
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,570
Gamba.

528
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,690
No, all yours.

529
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,390
Oh, cool.

530
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,050
Alright.

531
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,470
Oh shoot.

532
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,190
I'm already feeling the pressure.

533
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,210
Oh, oh, oh.

534
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,510
Oh, oh.

535
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,690
Oh, no!

536
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,230
Ow!

537
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:04,830
Ow!

538
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,490
Wait.

539
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,130
Ow!

540
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,910
I'm feeling the pressure, Mr. Crabbs!

541
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:10,910
Mr. Crabbs!

542
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,650
I don't like this!

543
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,210
Mr. Crabbs, I don't- Oh, shoot.

544
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:13,910
What the hell?

545
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,590
Okay, I think we're gonna lose this.

546
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,910
Uh, yeah, we got- we don't have this.

547
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:19,710
Okay.

548
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,210
Wait.

549
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,850
No, no, no bots.

550
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,050
No bots, no bots.

551
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:30,850
No bots.

552
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,610
That would be stupid.

553
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,690
I have finger on V.

554
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,450
Okay.

555
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,590
All right.

556
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,100
Oh, I don't think this one's as difficult as before.

557
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:47,960
Maybe.

558
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,760
I say that.

559
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,440
I will surely regret saying that.

560
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,880
Oh, oh, nice.

561
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Nice, nice, nice.

562
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,160
Uh...

563
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,880
I just need...

564
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,700
Yeso!

565
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,280
Yeso!

566
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,360
Yeso!

567
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,500
Yeso!

568
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,340
Oh!

569
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,640
Okay.

570
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,400
Oh my

571
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,580
gosh!

572
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,820
Yeah, get him turret!

573
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,500
Get him turret!

574
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Where are you?

575
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,120
Where'd he go?

576
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,320
Get him turret!

577
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,280
I traded you, O Lord, for Mammon.

578
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,920
Come on then!

579
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,980
You come on!

580
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,860
Where are you?

581
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,360
Oh shoot.

582
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,540
Oh stop!

583
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,280
Stop!

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,560
You're a very... you're a very very good turret.

585
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,060
You're a very good turret.

586
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,420
Am I a good turret?

587
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:17,820
Oh.

588
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,580
Oh no.

589
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,400
Big Daddy's coming.

590
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,420
Oh geez.

591
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:20,960
Okay, wait.

592
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
Uh, can I hack this?

593
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,500
That did almost kill me.

594
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,060
That would have been wild.

595
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,000
What's in here anyway?

596
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,320
A Valias.

597
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Only if I hack it, I can get the Eve.

598
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,460
Where am I going?

599
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,270
Oh my god, wait, is he like stalking me?

600
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,730
I'm scared, I'm so scared.

601
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,810
Ooh, this is freaky.

602
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:01,990
Enter the code.

603
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,810
I'm... I'm...

604
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,570
Trapped, I think.

605
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,770
Surely he won't come down here.

606
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,790
Whatever this is

607
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:39,870

It's my eyes.

612
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,410
Nothing is in the smuggler's crate.

613
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,630
Are you kidding me?

614
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,850

Oh, I'm in the water.

626
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,380
I'm an idiot.

627
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay, wait, hold on.

628
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,440

00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

630
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,380
Oh, my gosh, this game.

631
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,220
Where did that person come from?

632
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,200
Can you go through here?

633
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,740
Where did they come from?

634
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,640
Oh, they got cash money, though.

635
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,720
Oh, these fish.

636
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,100
We're remembering how to play the game, everybody.

637
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,900
Oh, that's not him.

638
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,680
Can I get up there?

639
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,760
There's something up there, though.

640
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,500
Oh!

641
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,300
I collected bugs.

642
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,120
Four of them, I think.

643
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,340
There's something else over there.

644
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,260
Maybe he's...

645
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,720
He's gone.

646
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,170
There was something shining.

647
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:46,710
Oh, there.

648
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,070
A lot of machine gun rounds.

649
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,470
Wow, okay.

650
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,150
A lot of machine gun rounds.

651
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,210
Anything up there?

652
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,630
Wait, there's more under here.

653
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,030
Fab.

654
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,040
All right, I save and then we go.

655
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,180
Whatever this game can do, men can do double.

656
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,640
RJ, hey on happy birthday!

657
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,020
Happy happy birthday!

658
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,740
I'm just gonna go.

659
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,240
Where is he?

660
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,180
He sounds so close.

661
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,800
Why isn't my rocket working, huh?

662
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,360
Did I search this guy?

663
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,460
Yeah, oh, no I didn't.

664
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,140
He had two bucks.

665
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,080
Oh, there he is.

666
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,460
They're spawn camping me.

667
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,340
What?

668
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,260
So, if I get too close, they become hostile.

669
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,160
Is that the case?

670
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,900
If I shoot or get too close, right?

671
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,700
Yes.

672
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,200
Okay.

673
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,660
I don't know quite yet how close is close.

674
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,880
This is not a super great place to attack him, I feel.

675
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,120
So, I am...

676
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,520
What is that sound?

677
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,620
What is that sound?

678
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,340
What is that?

679
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,900
Why isn't my rocket working on him, huh?

680
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,840
No, I don't need a hint, please!

681
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,180
I'm scared!

682
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,940
Don't come over here.

683
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,940
This guy looks different.

684
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,280
This helmet looks a little different.

685
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:26,250
I'm not, I'm not.

686
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,690
Holy cow.

687
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,590
Oh geez!

688
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,170
That's a turret.

689
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,710
I had a feeling it was a turret.

690
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,050
Of course it's a turret.

691
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:49,490

life spray and pray i was i was literally spraying like this

693
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:12,830
because of the god no was shooting like that.

694
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,690
What is that right there?

695
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,810
I wish I could have hacked it.

696
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:17,310
I tried.

697
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,310
I tried to get to it.

698
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,530
How do I switch the different ammo's again?

699
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,510
The recoil was crazy.

700
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,010
Oh, zapping it.

701
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:29,670
Yeah, that's right.

702
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,490
I can do that.

703
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,090
Where is the other one?

704
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,290
I don't...

705
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,910
Didn't see where it was at.

706
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,510
What a waste.

707
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,470
What a waste.

708
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,190
Ouch!

709
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,530
Where is it?

710
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,600
I don't see the other...

711
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,820
Oh, good, it's killing people.

712
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,620
It's also killing people.

713
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,830
Somebody else just left.

714
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,230
I don't know where the other...

715
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,950
Is he dead?

716
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,350
I don't have any more.

717
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:35,970
Do you have any?

718
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,230
What's that blue down there?

719
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,110
Is that the good stuff?

720
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,970
Oh, it's not the good stuff!

721
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,030
Um...

722
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,030
Guys?

723
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,230
Guys!

724
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:09,770
Crouch?

725
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,110
Wait, how do you crouch?

726
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,050
Because- Oh, see.

727
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,760
I can't hack it.

728
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,560
I got something, though.

729
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,380
Oh, here we go.

730
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,930
Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, sorry.

731
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,890
Getting back into it, getting back into it.

732
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,370
This is actually not a bad spot, isn't it?

733
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,250
This is actually a decent, okay, spot for you.

734
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,630
I hate these things, though.

735
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,630
Um, oh my gosh, really?

736
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,410
You're gonna be so rude like that?

737
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,610
Um, can I have a, like, one that goes the other way, please?

738
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,290
This, you.

739
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:09,410
And, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, wait, I don't have a thing that
goes the the other way?

740
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,650
Wait, wait, this is so... Wait!

741
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,770
How am I... Wait, how am I supposed to turn it?

742
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,560
Um... I can't even loop it!

743
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,580
Oh, I was right there.

744
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,440
Oh, there was two of them.

745
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,240
I missed it.

746
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,180
My bad.

747
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,520
Um...

748
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,900
Wait.

749
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,860
That was my bad.

750
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,580
Oops!

751
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,720
Blind minkey!

752
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,800
Meow.

753
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,300
That's me.

754
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,000
All right, hack it.

755
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,280
All right.

756
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,260
Uh...

757
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,700
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

758
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,580
Ah-huh, yes, yes, yes.

759
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,900
I see, I see.

760
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,280
Oh, uh...

761
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,700
I see, I see.

762
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:13,960
I see.

763
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,100
I see.

764
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,020
Now I need you.

765
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,120
And I need you.

766
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,300
And we're finished.

767
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,140
Yippee!

768
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,460
Shinomi Kat, happy birthday!

769
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,480
Hacking is so hyper.

770
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,340
It's so fun.

771
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,440
Actually, I'm obsessed with this part of the game.

772
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,300
I don't want to waste it all.

773
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,840
I'm obsessed with the hacking.

774
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,640
I think that's a lot of fun.

775
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,140
Oh, I think that's more evil.

776
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,060
I wish I could

777
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,880
I wish I could hack it

778
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,220
Yeah, what was that?

779
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:16,880
I feel like I'm in a shootout I want to hack it, but I don't
know if I can reach Okay, hold on Let's see if my magic can

780
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,360
reach it

781
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,720
I don't think it can Let me try, let me try.

782
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,720
Is it that?

783
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,120
Yeah, I think I need to get closer.

784
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,660
Who are- the girls are fighting!

785
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,480
What are they- The girls are fighting!

786
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,150
Wow, if you guys are shooting at each other!

787
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,410
All right, girls.

788
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,710
Let's settle down.

789
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,810
Let's settle down.

790
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,800
Oh, what's this over here?

791
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,840
What are you?

792
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,540
Oh, a shotgun.

793
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:16,720
Okay.

794
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,840
There's a lot of stuff under here, isn't there?

795
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,120
Just random things.

796
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,920
How do I get out of this?

797
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,040
Wait until...

798
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,240
Go!

799
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:39,980
Oh!

800
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,440
Okay.

801
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,460
Oh,

802
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:53,900
man.

803
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,010
Oh, maybe I can leave this way.

804
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:02,880
Oh, my God.

805
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,380
There's...

806
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,640
Ouch!

807
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,540
Oh, God.

808
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,200
Oh, there's so much shooting!

809
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,820
There's a med kit on the ground.

810
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,080
If I could get anywhere, everything is just shooting all at
once.

811
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,400
Oh, my God.

812
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,560
Oh, he's a...

813
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,360
blast watching people play this game for the first time.

814
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,500
Counselor, thank you so much.

815
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,580
I can't.

816
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,720
Go away.

817
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:33,760
Oh.

818
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,340
Oh my god.

819
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,040
Of course.

820
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,700
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

821
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm trying to do anything right now.

822
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,280
I'm actually struggling to get out of here.

823
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,780
Oh my god.

824
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,700
Oh my god.

825
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,300
This is tough.

826
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,340
This is a tough.

827
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
This is a tough...

828
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,360
I wish my turret could handle the other turret.

829
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,360
You know what I'm talking about.

830
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
Alright, book it boss.

831
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:13,680
Okay.

832
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,520
I'm gonna...

833
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:17,840
I'm ready.

834
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,040
In 3, 2, 1, go.

835
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,460
I'm not... Why am I still crouching?

836
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:23,960
Run!

837
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,010
Oh, uh...

838
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:38,830
Ouch!

839
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,150
Everything's fine.

840
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,250
Everything's fine.

841
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:44,930
Everything's not fine.

842
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,470
At least he's got money.

843
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,970
Let's just get out of here.

844
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,130
Let's just... Let's just go.

845
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,790
I'm out of bullets.

846
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:53,890
I'm out of...

847
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,110
I'm out of everything.

848
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,390
It's just shooting.

849
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,010
Everything is just happening.

850
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,690
Why is there still more?

851
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,470
Oh, first aid kit.

852
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,410
Oh, thank goodness.

853
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:14,790
Oh, I'm up here.

854
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:15,430
Okay.

855
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:16,930
Oh, my God.

856
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,870
I can just hear everything.

857
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,490
I'm not drinking that.

858
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:21,990
Let's hear, though.

859
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:22,650
A pistol.

860
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:23,390
Take that.

861
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,270
Gene bank.

862
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,210
Oh, okay, okay.

863
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,050
I just hear...

864
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:31,650
everything.

865
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,770
Oh, I went in a big circle.

866
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,030
Wait, are you serious right now?

867
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,510
I just noticed.

868
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,970
I went in a big circle.

869
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,650
It is so loud.

870
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,950
Oh, B to switch ammo.

871
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,750
Thank you so much.

872
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:47,230
Thank you.

873
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:48,830
Alright, let's see.

874
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,130
Increases your maximum.

875
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,710
If I could have anything.

876
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:55,970
Plasmid slot.

877
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,060
Extra nutrition.

878
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,440
You gain a little extra health from snacks and bandages.

879
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,040
Try not to backseat, but if you die in the game, just
respawn a Vita chamber with no penalties.

880
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,560
Just in case you get stuck again.

881
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,520
Thank you!

882
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,260
Thank you.

883
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,520
No, you're good.

884
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,060
Like I said, I'm not used to these types of games, so they
stress me out.

885
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,240
Maybe reduce all physical damage would be really good.

886
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,360
Freeze your foes.

887
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,140
Wait, winter blast sounds awesome.

888
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,400
Wait, there's so many.

889
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,260
Hacker's Delight.

890
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,320
Every time you hack something, you gain a little health and
Eve!

891
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,840
Wait.

892
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,440
I think I need that.

893
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,580
I'm hacking everything.

894
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,540
I think Hacker's Delight would be the best thing ever.

895
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,240
You can freeze turrets with it too.

896
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,920
Speedy Hacker.

897
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,100
Reduces flow speed.

898
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,800
Wait, I kind of love all these like little eyes.

899
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,240
upgrades.

900
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,060
They're so fun.

901
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,060
I'm gonna hack.

902
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,280
Where is it?

903
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,000
Hackers delight.

904
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,780
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

905
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,100
Reduces difficulty when hacking turrets, bots, accounts.

906
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,180
Hack the planet!

907
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,140
Hack the planet!

908
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,240
Increases damage you deal to cameras, bots.

909
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,700
Oh, increases damage.

910
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,380
If I punch them.

911
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,760
Yeah, little hell.

912
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:39,220
I don't have anything that's like a Oh my god, they're still
shooting They're still going

913
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:50,580
I hear something I think I hear big daddy Yeah, this one By
engineering tonics Press to review the ones you have

914
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:56,600
currently equipped I don't have any Physical tonics But did
you see any engineering ones That we could have gotten

915
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,010
By the one that kills you instantly Okay

916
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,620
Hacking upgrades are off the engineering.

917
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,080
Well, not that one.

918
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,540
Unfortunately.

919
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,340
Okay, um...

920
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,480
I am slightly lost, though.

921
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,350
Goal.

922
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:40,090
Wait.

923
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,550
Oh, God!

924
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:44,830
They're coming back.

925
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,630
Go make this harder than it needs to work.

926
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,290
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

927
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,430
Okay, let's see.

928
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,930
If I crouch and go, well, it's CB.

929
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,500
Alright.

930
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,580
I think I'm going to try and hack it, the other one too.

931
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:30,370
Lateral.

932
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:31,110
Alright.

933
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,390
I'm going to run.

934
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,770
I get it.

935
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:34,970
Run!

936
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,010
ZIGZAG!

937
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:38,410
ZIGZAG!

938
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:39,730
ZIGZAG!

939
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,130
ZIGZAG!

940
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:42,150
ZIGZAG!

941
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:44,130
ZIGZAG!

942
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:44,670
We're hacking?

943
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:47,810
I'm saving.

944
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,290
Oh, I'm hacking!

945
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:55,270
Oh, I'm hacking!

946
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,410
Oh, I'm hacking!

947
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:00,610
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all
right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all

948
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,010
right, all right, all right.

949
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,890
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

950
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,090
Oh yeah.

951
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,450
Oh,

952
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:24,730
what did I just do?

953
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,390
On Axia?

954
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,150
Yes.

955
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,610
Give me housing!

956
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:32,490
Give me eggs!

957
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,170
All right, we're done shooting now, right?

958
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,250
We're done being annoying.

959
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,860
I see something glow in there.

960
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,260
Looks like machine gun round.

961
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,580
My tummy's full, Mr. B.

962
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,860
My tummy's full, Mr. B.

963
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,500
She's so cute.

964
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,630
Time for a nap, sleeping.

965
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,800
Where is he going?

966
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,740
I think they went through that door.

967
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,160
Yeah, there they go.

968
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:55,550
Awesome.

969
01:00:59,760 --> 01:00:59,980
Whoa!

970
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,240
Medical expert.

971
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,060
Your first aid kits will go further.

972
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,280
Healing sickness and injury at a rate you're sure to find
astonishing.

973
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,300
Oh no, I can't.

974
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,040
Wait, uh, first aid kids give you slightly more health.

975
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,940
This one is the first aid kids give you Eve, and this is...

976
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,800
Yeah, I think I should...

977
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,240
Why have you forsaken me?

978
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:29,690
I am.

979
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,070
Yes, my turrets!

980
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,570
Oh, how do you know I'm here?

981
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:40,810
Wait, how do you know I'm here?

982
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,470
There's a lot going on.

983
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,700
Okay, anyway.

984
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,920
Let's take all their stuff.

985
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,200
Holy!

986
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,460
You're loaded.

987
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,280
First aid kit.

988
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,720
What does coffee do?

989
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,660
Brittany.

990
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,060
Okay, I am lost.

991
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,720
I don't have very many pistols.

992
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,340
Yippee!

993
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:26,820
Okay.

994
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,980
What's that?

995
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:28,700
More?

996
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,600
More pistol?

997
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,820
Okay, actually killing them is pretty nice because you get
more stuff, right?

998
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,060
Oh, yeah, baby.

999
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,300
Okay, okay.

1000
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,600
Okay, okay.

1001
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,500
Oh, yeah, baby.

1002
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,660
Alright, I'm saving, sorry.

1003
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,640
Oh, yeah.

1004
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,340
Actually, drinking...

1005
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,460
Coffee gives you the Eve.

1006
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,560
Oh, okay, cool, cool.

1007
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,440
So it says we need to go this way.

1008
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:58,940
Can I search you?

1009
01:02:59,220 --> 01:02:59,740
You know?

1010
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,210
This way.

1011
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,310
Is it...

1012
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,150
Can I go back this way?

1013
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:26,210
Does this open?

1014
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:30,650
Oh my god, it opened this entire time!

1015
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,060
Oh, that's a lot of first aid kits now, isn't it?

1016
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,240
I didn't even notice this door.

1017
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,020
My bad.

1018
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:56,020
saving again this is the way this is it we got it we didn't
need no hint i'm good game one day the gentlemen start

1019
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:10,070

1020
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,960

1021
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:28,360
oh my gosh getting the hack thing is awesome.

1022
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,960
Minky with a blicky.

1023
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,980
It's a buckshot shotgun.

1024
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,840
Saving twice before moving on.

1025
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,200
She's just like me for real for real.

1026
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,760
I'm glad that you can understand that.

1027
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,460
Is that another first aid kit?

1028
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,000
No.

1029
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,980
That looks like a plug in the wall.

1030
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,360
Wait.

1031
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,820
What's all this though?

1032
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,200
Oh no.

1033
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,400
We're about the boss fight for real aren't we?

1034
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,180
Wait.

1035
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,980
Oh and they give us this.

1036
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,480
Okay, we're in trouble, I think.

1037
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,400
Rise up, save scum gang.

1038
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:03,600
Yeah.

1039
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:13,480
It's also because I'm like, I don't want to redo stuff if I,
like, if the game crashes.

1040
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,260
I'm more save scummy.

1041
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:16,780
Knock!

1042
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:26,060
I'm more save scummy on games that I have to, um, that I
have to...

1043
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,100
be careful about, you know.

1044
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,260
All right, here we go.

1045
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,480
Knock, knock!

1046
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,200
Peach!

1047
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,060
You're looking for an invite to the fisheries.

1048
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,680
Nuts, I say.

1049
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:53,080
But if in your heads up to the Warp Master's office and find
old Peach on research camera, maybe I could manage an

1050
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:53,680
invite.

1051
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,300
Oh, you're safe?

1052
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,080
Well, what was that?

1053
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,260
My friend, you are fucked.

1054
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:03,820
Holy!

1055
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:07,980
Oh!

1056
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,620
Where did she go?

1057
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,610
Oh my god!

1058
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,560
No.

1059
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,160
No.

1060
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,380
It happens to the top for you.

1061
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,620
Look on the top of the belt.

1062
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,800
You'll find something to keep you alive.

1063
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:59,240
Now, go get that camera and then step shots of those that
crawls on the ceiling.

1064
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,680
Then I'll let you into the fisheries.

1065
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:03,560
Okay.

1066
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,000
Grenade launcher!

1067
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,980
I'll snap a ounce of fountain on you and I'll have you in a
box.

1068
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:15,640
Atlas gives you the vouch, but I ain't turning my eye just
on his say-so.

1069
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:18,740
Okay.

1070
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:20,580
Woo!

1071
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,540
Yes, sir.

1072
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,100
Yes, sir.

1073
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,120
Alright, well, that could have been worse.

1074
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,640
Oh, that's big doubting.

1075
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,440
Yes, sir.

1076
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,700
No, sir.

1077
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,540
I saw PTSD from the noise the spider slicers make when they
scuttle about.

1078
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:08,860
What?

1079
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,540
thinking this is something, but it's our turret.

1080
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,980
Alright, so we have to go get the camera from the...

1081
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:24,900
Oh, sorry.

1082
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,420
I'm trying to, like, get used to switching back and forth.

1083
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:38,660
Oh!

1084
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,780
There's guys down there.

1085
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,440
Oh my god, There's three of them!

1086
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,260
Wait, hold on.

1087
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,520
Uh, yeah.

1088
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,850
I thought that would kill them.

1089
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,600
Let's let my turret take care of it.

1090
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,480
I think it took care of them.

1091
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,960
I think he's coming back.

1092
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,500
I don't get one shot by that anymore.

1093
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,880
It out!

1094
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,860
Little sister.

1095
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,000
She's so cute.

1096
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,640
But we took care of him!

1097
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:39,430
Word.

1098
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:43,730
Oh yeah baby, oh yeah baby, oh yeah baby!

1099
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,090
What else do we have here?

1100
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,050
Electric book.

1101
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,290
I didn't get that before.

1102
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,250
Wait, didn't I hack this?

1103
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:56,210
I thought I hacked this one before, no?

1104
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,290
I thought I thought!

1105
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:14,310
Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.

1106
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,410
Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.

1107
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:16,710
Oh yeah.

1108
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,830
This one's tough, okay.

1109
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:21,670
Um, can I get one that goes up?

1110
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,650
Like this?

1111
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:24,010
Yes.

1112
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:26,910
There we go.

1113
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,150
Okay, okay.

1114
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,030
feel a little bit better now, bro.

1115
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,950
I was like, I don't know if I'm going to make this one.

1116
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,630
And, uh, oh, wait, here we go.

1117
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,630
And then, where's the other way?

1118
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,170
This one.

1119
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:40,770
Okay.

1120
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,550
Oh, maybe I didn't.

1121
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,170
I think, okay.

1122
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:49,410
Yeah, I guess I didn't.

1123
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,030
The circus of value.

1124
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,210
I will buy another Eve.

1125
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:00,230
I want to buy another slot, to be honest.

1126
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:13,390
Holy cow.

1127
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:19,070
They explode so much, they just explode once they die.

1128
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,930
Atlas, wait, what'd that guy say?

1129
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:23,670
I didn't hear.

1130
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,810
Unlock a plasmid slot.

1131
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:30,890
Oh, this is the atom!

1132
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,170
I forgot it's a completely, totally different currency.

1133
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:34,890
That's right.

1134
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,390
Nice shot, thank you.

1135
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,610
By lots of Eve.

1136
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,160
Oh, this is open now.

1137
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,760
Oh, okay, cool.

1138
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,140
Ah!

1139
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,520
Oh!

1140
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,960
Nice.

1141
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,800
The fire does help.

1142
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,560
The fire is scary, but it does help.

1143
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,980
It's very scary.

1144
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,360
It's very scary.

1145
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,780
Why are you empty?

1146
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:29,520
Yes.

1147
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:31,580
Nice.

1148
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,220
Yes.

1149
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,850
Did I grab that?

1150
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:39,470
Oh.

1151
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:41,550
Gosh, there's so much stuff on the ground.

1152
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,170
The game feels generous right now.

1153
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,210
I have a feeling.

1154
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,430
That will change in the future, huh?

1155
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:51,790
Oh, is there a...

1156
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,620
Where does this go?

1157
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:12,650
Oh, this is a scary What the shooting?

1158
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:15,270
What is that?

1159
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:16,230
Oh, it's a tape gun.

1160
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,970
Oh, I think those are my turrets that are shooting.

1161
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:22,590
How

1162
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:32,480
does this happen?

1163
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,920
Rapture is transforming before my eyes.

1164
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,650
The great chain is pulling away from me.

1165
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,380
Perhaps it's time to give it a tug.

1166
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,860
Give it a tug.

1167
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,080
Perhaps.

1168
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,780
Like, the turrets are doing their jobs out there.

1169
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,560
Um, is that?

1170
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,900
Hello?

1171
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,780
Thank you?

1172
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,440
Did that fall out of your pockets?

1173
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,780
Wait, what?

1174
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,160
Oh, I got him.

1175
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,480
Oh, dang it, I couldn't get him.

1176
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,560
Where did Bank tribute to the gutter goes?

1177
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,380
Why did he do that?

1178
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,560
I'm actually so confused why he did that.

1179
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:59,200
I mean, I'm not gonna be upset about it.

1180
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,540
I'm just confused.

1181
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,080
Okay.

1182
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,440
He's like, here you go, buddy.

1183
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,360
You look thirsty.

1184
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,360
Okay.

1185
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,920
Yeah, he helped you out, yeah.

1186
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,940
He did help me out.

1187
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,560
He repaid him with bullets.

1188
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,440
Actually, guys, I have to use the little ghosty's room.

1189
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,640
I'm sorry.

1190
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,720
I will be right back.

1191
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,000
There's three little sisters in this level.

1192
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,560
Maybe that's why I'm seeing them loop around so much.

1193
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,040
Oh, my goodness.

1194
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,700
We need to get the item.

1195
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,740
We need to get the island.

1196
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:35,920
I'll be right back.

1197
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,040
I just gotta be.

1198
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,420
Be every safe travels.

1199
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,380
Yes, it is a treacherous journey that I must take to the
ghosty's room.

1200
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,500
I'll be right back.

1201
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:08,690
I'm back.

1202
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:09,850
Sorry about that.

1203
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:15,750

Frat grenade.

1231
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,550
Be the switch ammo.

1232
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:27,750
Yeah, yeah, I do remember that.

1233
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,780
I knew there would be a little sister.

1234
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,280
Uh, they're not gonna get mad at me for that, are they?

1235
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,340
Yeah, we're building them free.

1236
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,120
Oh.

1237
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,840
Dang it.

1238
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,340
Oh no.

1239
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:03,100
My last mod got copyright struck, so...

1241
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,040
You're not mad at me, right?

1242
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,100
I protected her.

1243
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,440
Yeah, I protected her.

1244
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,070
Oh, I was gonna get caught again.

1245
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,530
I'm gonna get struck so bad.

1246
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:20,410
That's okay.

1247
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,230
I can't pick anymore!

1248
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,210
Uh...

1249
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:35,420
I saw one of these smugglers having a game of catching on
the docks today and these surprised me because his hands

1250
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,180
were crippled during the war.

1251
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,340
He was unloading the barge the other day.

1252
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,060
Oh, I did a joke.

1253
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,600
He was beaten from the sea slug.

1254
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:51,500
He woke up the next morning and he found he could move his
fingers for the first time in years.

1255
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:53,660
One second.

1256
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,100
I think we gotta fight this guy.

1257
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:00,280
I think we might need to fight him.

1258
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:10,680
If I, like, can I hurt the little sisters, you know?

1259
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,800
I don't want to.

1260
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,720
Oh, this is the proximity mine.

1261
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,460
Okay, okay.

1262
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:17,960
Very cool.

1263
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:20,700
No?

1264
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:21,660
Okay, they're invincible.

1265
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,340
Okay, cool, cool.

1266
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,320

That wasn't bad.

1273
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:51,480
Read like a book.

1274
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:52,660
I know that.

1275
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:53,780
Wait, wait.

1276
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,560
Wait, where the heck am I?

1277
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:55,980
Wait.

1278
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,020
Wait.

1279
01:24:59,360 --> 01:24:59,820
Huh?

1280
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,060
This one.

1281
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,040
That's the one I just did, right?

1282
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,240
Oh, I gotta scroll up some.

1283
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,100
There we go.

1284
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,180
That was weird.

1285
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,640
That many saves.

1286
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,720
Shhh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

1287
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,740
Wait, uh...

1288
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,640
Uh...

1289
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,340
Because his hands were crippled during the war.

1290
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,540
Oh, okay.

1291
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:57,400
He could move his fingers only for his power and force him I
don't

1292
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:15,170
know if this works at all

1293
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:27,020
No, it's not dream time Oh,

1294
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:43,430
he's almost there

1295
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,980
What is this?

1296
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,980
What is going on there?

1297
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,400
I'm afraid to get close.

1298
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,680
Is it like a mine or something?

1299
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,420
Oh, dang.

1300
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:25,740
That's a mine.

1301
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:26,500
Okay, okay.

1302
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,180
Thank you.

1303
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,880
Walk closer.

1304
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,040
Little baby!

1305
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:45,820
Give me the atom.

1306
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,620
Thank you.

1307
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:48,800
Thank you.

1308
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,040
Armour piercing pistol rounds!

1309
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,420
Gotta use those for a second.

1310
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,100
What's the reward deal?

1311
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:04,740
The reward will be inside a teddy bear at a gatherer's
garden.

1312
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,040
Oh, let's go.

1313
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:07,900
Yippee!

1314
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,240
Alright.

1315
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,080
Okay.

1316
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,080
Wait, that's not what I meant to do.

1317
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,840
We'll keep these for now.

1318
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,040
F1.

1319
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:24,860
That's what it is.

1320
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:25,140
Okay.

1321
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,000
I hear another one.

1322
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,840
I hear another girl.

1323
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:30,920
She's talking.

1324
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:34,080
Okay.

1325
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,160
I'm gonna save again.

1326
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:35,540
Sorry.

1327
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,020
We gotta reward!

1328
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:43,260
Alright.

1329
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,040
So, chill out.

1330
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,500
Oh, it's the way... Oh, we're upstairs.

1331
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,800
I just noticed where we are.

1332
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,830
We don't know what has happened to you.

1333
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:07,830
Ryan's men have taken you away and said you are needed to
save corruption.

1334
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:08,730
Another guy.

1335
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:10,630
I need a child to save a city.

1336
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,650
But I see these little girls crawling out of these vents.

1337
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:20,210
And I only wonder if you might one day crawl out of this
vent and find these not.

1338
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:22,590
My baby is...

1339
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:23,810
crawling out of the vent.

1340
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:28,270
Oh, seven.

1341
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:29,630
Seven.

1342
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:33,170
Seven, five.

1343
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,890
Oh, it's so sad.

1344
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,890
We gotta run.

1345
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:45,310
Eat the potato chip.

1346
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,690
Eat the potato chip.

1347
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:50,950
Okay.

1348
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:52,590
Okay.

1349
01:29:52,610 --> 01:30:00,370
I'm trying not to get got by the, um, by the rocket launcher
and also by a person.

1350
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:01,510
Oh my god!

1351
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:04,410
We're hacking?

1352
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:16,110
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

1353
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,370
Sheesh, oh.

1354
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:18,790
Oh, wait.

1355
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:20,930
Wait, where did I put that?

1356
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:22,270
Oh, actually this works.

1357
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,210
This actually works.

1358
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:34,210

1359
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:45,190

1360
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:51,350

through everything again i

1361
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,620

1362
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:06,310
i am to go into here.

1363
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:07,190
Warning.

1364
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:10,770
High security measures enforced beyond this point.

1365
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,670
Central station monitoring and videotaping 24 hours a day.

1366
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:17,930
I lack.

1367
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:20,130
Can I shoot these?

1368
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:22,110
Or...

1369
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:27,230
Where am I anyway?

1370
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,010
Oh, we're getting to the goal.

1371
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:38,980
Whoa!

1372
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:39,540
Whoa!

1373
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:39,880
Whoa!

1374
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,220
Good Goodness gracious!

1375
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,360
Too many machine gun rounds.

1376
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,100
Give me all your money.

1377
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:57,400
Bozo.

1378
01:31:59,220 --> 01:31:59,940
What is this?

1379
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,720
The bot shut down.

1380
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,580
That sounds like a good idea, no?

1381
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,840
We shall save before we do that.

1382
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,300
Yeah, the camera.

1383
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,980
Surveillance camera.

1384
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:15,860
bot shut down.

1385
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,200
Can I do it?

1386
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:19,720
Does it work?

1387
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,080
Can I hack it?

1388
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,380
Hello?

1389
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,080
What is this?

1390
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:27,880
Bot shut down panels are used to cancel active security
alarms and shut down any security bots that have been

1391
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,540
summoned by the alarm.

1392
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,420
Using a bot shut down panel costs $20!

1393
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,820
Okay, let me pay.

1394
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,340
Let me pay the fee.

1395
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,520
How do I use it?

1396
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:40,720
Hello?

1397
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,740
I wish to pay the fee.

1398
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:53,850
Dude, the security cameras not count as active bots?

1399
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,430
Oh, it has to be an alert.

1400
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:57,750
What's going on?

1401
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:07,530
Alright.

1402
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,590
How?

1403
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,470
I can hack it.

1404
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:20,950
I just need to see where it is.

1405
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,040
Oh, geez.

1406
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:29,720
Oh, geez.

1407
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,420
Uh, I can't hack it.

1408
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:32,940
I'm lost.

1409
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:33,840
Alright, wait, I'm stuck.

1410
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,020
You don't see me?

1411
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:36,680
Okay, good.

1412
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,680
You don't see me?

1413
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,300
I'm too short to get it.

1414
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:43,800
I have to jump.

1415
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:46,860
Hut!

1416
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:47,700
Oh, geez.

1417
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:48,220
Hut!

1418
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:48,820
Hack!

1419
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,270
There is no...

1420
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:09,840
Okay.

1421
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,220
Wait, I'm just gonna...

1422
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:11,420
Hold on.

1423
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:12,900
I'm gonna reload so that I can...

1424
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,080
Oops.

1425
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,320
Okay, hold on.

1426
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:19,580
I'm gonna grab the stuff.

1427
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,260
And I'm gonna...

1428
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,460
This is too familiar.

1429
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,000
This is too familiar with my everyday afterlife.

1430
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,800
We can destroy it.

1431
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,340
This is true.

1432
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,920
This is true.

1433
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,200
There's also stuff like here.

1434
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,960
I don't know if it will see me.

1435
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,920
Honestly, I'm not quite sure, but I'm not risking it.

1436
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,280
This Fontaine fellow is somebody to watch.

1437
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,660
Once he was just a menace to be connected at home.

1438
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:57,420
But he always manages to be where the evidence isn't.

1439
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,620
He's the most dangerous type of huddle.

1440
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,700
Kind with vision.

1441
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,800
Something up there.

1442
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,800
Can you guys remind me who Fontaine is again?

1443
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,940
I am struggling to remember.

1444
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,000
It hasn't been shown yet.

1445
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:28,360
Also, there's something shiny over here, too.

1446
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:31,760
Awesome.

1447
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:35,900
What is up that?

1448
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,200
What is all that up there, anyway?

1449
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:38,440
What is up, dog?

1450
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,280
I hear him coming.

1451
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,820
I want to hack this.

1452
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,700
Alright, so we can destroy...

1453
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,100
Alright, once it goes back...

1454
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:55,680
Okay.

1455
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,400
Uh, oops, I couldn't see it.

1456
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,500
That was my bad.

1457
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:07,850
Wait, can I?

1458
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,320
Nothing much.

1459
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,440
How about you?

1460
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:19,920
Hmm.

1461
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,130
Didn't she have telekinesis?

1462
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:28,910
I don't have it attached right now.

1463
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:31,010
Freaky.

1464
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,210
Oh, he's wearing his little mask.

1465
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:34,730
Cute.

1466
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,590
Okay, I'm just gonna go for it.

1467
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:46,900
Okay, um, I know I can stand underneath and it does not see.

1468
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:48,600
Yeah!

1469
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,540
All right, now time to see what the other camera does.

1470
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,900
Well, this one's even trickier, maybe.

1471
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:09,690
Wait, uh, save!

1472
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:10,470
Hack!

1473
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:12,290
Save, then hack!

1474
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:14,690
Save, then hack!

1475
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:16,430
Hack!

1476
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:17,290
All right.

1477
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:19,210
All right, we got this.

1478
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:20,010
We got this team.

1479
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:20,870
We got this team.

1480
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:26,290
We got this team.

1481
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:27,750
We got this team.

1482
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,180
Oh, my God.

1483
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,200
Are you kidding me?

1484
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:37,940
Oh, shoot.

1485
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:39,700
Okay.

1486
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:41,880
Um.

1487
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,060
We saved it.

1488
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:52,820
We saved the run.

1489
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,100
We saved the run.

1490
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,680
Nice save.

1491
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,140
Holy cow.

1492
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:01,960
Okay.

1493
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:03,280
All right.

1494
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:04,180
We're in here.

1495
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,900

1496
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:15,000

1499
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,260
This won't see me, right?

1500
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,080
It will, it will, it will, it will!

1501
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,260
Holy cow!

1502
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,660
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.

1503
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,080
I want to hack it so bad.

1504
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,160
I wonder if I can get it from a different angle.

1505
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:07,820
You know.

1506
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,660
Grab whatever that is.

1507
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,480
I can't shoot.

1508
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:17,520
I'm stupid.

1509
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:25,750
Can I get it from here?

1510
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:26,970
No, there's no way.

1511
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:28,330
Anyway, let's just keep going.

1512
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:29,570
I don't want to keep wasting Eve.

1513
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:31,610
Warfmaster's office!

1514
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:36,350
Okay.

1515
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,110
Fancy sounding.

1516
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,710
I'm sure glad I am.

1517
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:58,590
Oh!

1518
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:01,290
Alright, good to know.

1519
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:02,630
I'm running.

1520
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,400
Wait, what the alarm was going off?

1521
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:12,060
From where?

1522
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:12,600
From who?

1523
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:13,540
Why?

1524
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,180
Why was an alarm going off?

1525
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,400
Six grenades, more than enough to kill anything that moves.

1526
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,660
Through the glass.

1527
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,980
Oh, I see it now, I see it.

1528
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,000
Oh my gosh, that's tricky.

1529
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:29,420
Okay.

1530
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:32,440
the room.

1531
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,340
It is sneaky.

1532
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,200
And I heard a lady.

1533
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,100
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

1534
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:45,740
Oh, dang it.

1535
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,020
I didn't want to lose more Eve.

1536
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,080
I forgot that alcohol takes the Eve.

1537
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,960
Is he coming from over here?

1538
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,520
Oh, my gosh.

1539
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:25,640
Oh, my gosh.

1540
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:30,660
Okay.

1541
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:35,200
Can I please move?

1542
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:37,140
God!

1543
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,240
Everything is happening.

1544
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:56,980
All at once.

1545
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:01,900
What the heck is that?

1546
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:09,050
Okay, okay, okay.

1547
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:13,310
This is fine!

1548
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:15,050
Oh!

1549
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:21,430

1552
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,060
He says as he groans.

1553
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,100
I heard him go.

1554
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:05,180
Oh my god.

1555
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,000
Alright, alright, here we go.

1556
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,520
Oh my god, and there's a camera!

1557
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:16,260
I gotta hack- This is not good.

1558
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,160
This is actually the worst it could be.

1559
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,320
I'm glad I just saved.

1560
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,780
This is pretty grim, guys.

1561
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:29,080
As soon as I am done with this, what do I do?

1562
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,480
As soon as I'm done with this, what do I do?

1563
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,260
Oh my god.

1564
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:46,050
No, you.

1565
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:58,380
I'm gonna press F and then I'm gonna look up and press V.

1566
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,120
It's fine.

1567
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:14,760
I just say it.

1568
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:25,660

1576
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,640
Oh my gosh.

1577
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:19,940
Nothing here.

1578
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,300
A crawler.

1579
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,660
Don't find me.

1580
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,040
Is this room safe?

1581
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,620
Oh, we have a thing!

1582
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,160
Oh, find a chamber!

1583
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,920
Wait, this is not safe.

1584
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,320
Gene bank.

1585
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,900
I don't know what is shooting anymore.

1586
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,260
Use the wrench in those vents.

1587
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,080
Oh, okay, got it.

1588
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:53,780
Thank you.

1589
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:57,260
Wait, but my prize!

1590
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,220
She said I have a prize.

1591
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,200
At the next...

1592
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,980
At the next garden!

1593
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,880
Come on.

1594
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,360
Use your legs.

1595
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,140
You can do it.

1596
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,620
I can't tell if there's a door to it over here or not.

1597
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,920
Maybe it's through the vent.

1598
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:23,900
That's what I'm thinking.

1599
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:33,630
So far I'm okay with the things that I have.

1600
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:37,590
The electricity is like nearly a must.

1601
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,540
That sounds really close.

1602
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,860
This sounds really close.

1603
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:53,720
More machine?

1604
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,240
This game really wants me to use the machine gun, huh?

1605
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,180
Interrogation room.

1606
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,880
Jesus loves me this I know.

1607
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:11,740
Oh, I found it.

1608
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:15,000
Oh, the Bible tells me so.

1609
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:18,900
Little ones to him belong.

1610
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,880
They are weak, but he...

1611
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,500
Thank you.

1612
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,060
Camera obscura.

1613
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:42,570
Oi, did I see this room before?

1614
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:48,890
Oh.

1615
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:50,790
Hello?

1616
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:52,010
Oh, there was a coffee.

1617
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:54,170
Sure?

1618
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:56,110
I'll... sure?

1619
01:48:56,710 --> 01:48:57,530
Okay, let's take it.

1620
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:01,330
Take pictures of enemies at the camera to research them.

1621
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:06,490
Each type of enemy has a unique set of research bonuses by
taking a picture of the splicer on the other side of the

1622
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:06,710
window.

1623
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:08,570
Keep the subject centered and nearby.

1624
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:09,730
Ah!

1625
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:10,390
Good.

1626
01:49:10,990 --> 01:49:12,510
You've got the camera.

1627
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:17,590
Now get me some snaps, snaps on those spider splicers.

1628
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:22,030
And don't come back down here till you've got my research.

1629
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:24,650
Okay.

1630
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:27,190
Wee.

1631
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:30,170
Say cheers.

1632
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:41,790
research level reached spider splicer research bonus
increased damage spider spice spice i can't say this name

1633
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:46,930
spider splicers are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds

1634
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:58,930
okay i have to take three photos you know that's not gonna

Spider-Cyder.

1637
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,410
Jesus loves me.

1638
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,030
Yes, I know.

1639
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:12,110
The Bible tells me so.

1640
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:12,870
Oh.

1641
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:17,430
Oh.

1642
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:22,950
I'm sorry, Father.

1643
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:24,790
I'll do what you said.

1644
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:26,290
I'll do it.

1645
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:27,370
There you are over here.

1646
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,890
Come on.

1647
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:29,830
Let's get up with this.

1648
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:30,150
Oh.

1649
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,380
Got a guy?

1650
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,780
Or did you not count?

1651
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,940
You're a different splicer.

1652
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,040
Nice shot, thank you.

1653
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:05,520
Okay, I just was double checking that he didn't.

1654
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:06,600
Okay, six.

1655
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,140
Oh my gosh, this is so disorienting.

1656
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:13,400
You think you know me?

1657
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,740
Oh my god, what happened here?

1658
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:17,920
No!

1659
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:18,840
My garden!

1660
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,800
My prize!

1661
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,420
My way out.

1662
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:36,390
You think you know me?

1663
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,630
So dramatic.

1664
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:42,410
I'm trying to move.

1665
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:44,570
Well, there's a guy down there.

1666
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:46,630
Can I like zoom?

1667
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:48,370
Like, yeah, there was garden.

1668
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:57,550
Can I zoom in?

1669
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:01,130
Can I get a good picture of you?

1670
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:02,630
Whoa!

1671
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:05,830
Leather, lead head splicer.

1672
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:08,990
Multiple subjects.

1673
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:10,730
Is that a rooster?

1674
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,990
It absolutely is.

1675
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:17,170
What is this?

1676
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:21,270
Security bullseye.

1677
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:24,250
Are those pesky security cameras getting you down?

1678
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:25,590
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1679
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:31,290
Simply tag your enemies with our photoelectric insects and
those cameras and turrets become your best friend.

1680
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:34,510
That sounds huge.

1681
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:39,070
The background noises are so spooky.

1682
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:39,950
I know, right?

1683
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:53,960
Dramatic pause.

1684
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:55,660
And flip!

1685
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:03,280
I don't know where we are though.

1686
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,860
It's kind of spooking me.

1687
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,080
Okay, I'm gonna save again, sorry.

1688
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,860
It's basically an automatic hack.

1689
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:15,700
Seems like it, but then at the same time, I wonder...

1690
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:18,920
if...

1691
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,980
Then, you know, if I don't hack...

1692
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,480
I mean, some things are easy to hack, some things are not.

1693
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:27,020
You know what I mean?

1694
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:28,460
So it's like...

1695
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:31,300
But if I hack, I get the Eve and I get the health.

1696
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:36,280
So I guess it's good to have, but also...

1697
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:36,760
Yeah.

1698
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:46,030
Easy peasy.

1699
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:00,800
Oh, so easy.

1700
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,640
It's a plasmid though, so you'd be replacing incinerate.

1701
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:04,760
Oh.

1702
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:11,080
We do have enough to get a new plasmid slot.

1703
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,300
If I can get there.

1704
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:17,100
And we got some more.

1705
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:21,420
We even got some more atoms.

1706
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:24,840
We're hacking.

1707
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:29,240
Oh, I didn't save actually.

1708
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:30,960
That might have been a mistake.

1709
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,940
That might have been a mistake.

1710
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:34,720
Uh.

1711
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,300
Oh, it's fast.

1712
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,220
Oh, wait.

1713
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:40,200
Oh, I'm supposed to go up there.

1714
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:42,240
All right.

1715
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,620
Um, yeah.

1716
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:52,900
Nice.

1717
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,020
Now you got this.

1718
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:57,580
I got this, baby.

1719
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,360
Hack successful.

1720
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:00,860
What do we have anyway?

1721
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,680
How did personnel auto rounds?

1722
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:07,340
Was this for my...

1723
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:08,160
Oh, machine gun.

1724
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:10,700
It tells me.

1725
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:13,740
Kind of expensive.

1726
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:16,120
Hacker extraordinary.

1727
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:24,060
Alright,

1728
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,780
I hacked two things in a row, I deserve my save.

1729
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:35,800
I feel like I'm literally going at a snail's pace with this
game.

1730
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:39,860
But I do want to try and beat it before I go to Japan.

1731
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:41,420
We shall see.

1732
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:46,650
Oh, oops.

1733
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:52,010
Can you speak up?

1734
01:55:52,130 --> 01:55:53,470
I can't hear you over the turret.

1735
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:01,230
Sea slug?

1736
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:14,970
We're blaming the sea slugs' fault?

1737
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:18,350
But it means more Bioshock.

1738
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:21,570
That is true.

1739
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:23,070
That is so true.

1740
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:45,410
for you for discriminating tastes oh this is where I beat
the big daddy okay I can't get through here another big

1741
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:54,290
daddy second big daddy where do I

1742
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,990
Where...

1743
01:56:58,990 --> 01:56:59,650
Where...

1744
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:00,190
Where was that?

1745
01:57:00,710 --> 01:57:02,710
Oh, this game gets me all topsy-turvy.

1746
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:05,930
This level has three.

1747
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:07,810
Yes, it did say that.

1748
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:11,650
Oh, I guess I go through here, no?

1749
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:12,490
Okay, just kidding.

1750
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:22,310
I'm like trying not to, you know...

1751
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:25,310
cute myself too.

1752
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:29,930
McDonough.

1753
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:35,050
Uh oh.

1754
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:40,990
Either you build it like a bathtub or she's gonna turn into
a sewer.

1755
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:41,570
Ew.

1756
01:57:42,110 --> 01:57:42,870
No, McDonough.

1757
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:45,850
You said we're not gonna build no bathtub.

1758
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:48,130
We're gonna build Eden.

1759
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:53,650
Eden in a bathtub or a sewer.

1760
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:56,250
Do you have the research camera?

1761
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:56,750
Yeah.

1762
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:08,430
Does Big Daddy count as a camera picture?

1763
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:14,630
Does Big Daddy count?

1764
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,060
That's a good shot.

1765
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:27,980
Yippee!

1766
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,060
All enemies count.

1767
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:30,580
Lucky.

1768
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:33,340
Rosie.

1769
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:35,420
Did that...

1770
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,740
Wait, how many more do I need them?

1771
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:40,360
Take photos of splicers to complete your goal.

1772
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:51,270
Also the little sister.

1773
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:55,550
Honestly, I don't even see her.

1774
01:58:55,770 --> 01:58:56,470
I know she's there.

1775
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:01,790
Mr. B.

1776
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:05,990
I guess... she's so tiny.

1777
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:10,210
She's so teeny tiny.

1778
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:12,390
Aw, you were gonna come closer to me?

1779
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:18,110
Aw, it would have been gotten a better photo.

1780
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:26,550
No, I'm taking the picture!

1781
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:27,230
Stop!

1782
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:28,990
Okay, hold on.

1783
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:29,990
Right here.

1784
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:31,870
I got her.

1785
01:59:33,170 --> 01:59:33,990
Little sister.

1786
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:43,350
Small increases to matter.

1787
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,570
Max, Health, and Eve.

1788
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:46,350
Yippee!

1789
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:47,830
Okay, we're going now.

1790
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:49,790
Oh my gosh, there's a lot going on.

1791
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:56,480
There's a lot going on.

1792
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:56,860
Oh!

1793
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:00,780
I just realized I didn't search this guy.

1794
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:01,680
Wow.

1795
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,340
And there's more over here.

1796
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:04,460
Awesome.

1797
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:05,980
Okay.

1798
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:07,180
Last save.

1799
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,360
Before we keep going.

1800
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:11,660
A lot of rewards.

1801
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,880
There's so much to unlock in this game.

1802
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,220
Kinda crazy.

1803
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,120
There's so much going on.

1804
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:23,600
I'm hacking.

1805
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:31,560
I'm hacking.

1806
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:38,690
I'm hacking.

1807
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:40,370
I'm hacking.

1808
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:42,810
I'm hacking.

1809
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:45,810
There's a... a long boy?

1810
02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:46,650
Long boy!

1811
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:51,250
A little hacking as a tree.

1812
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:54,090
This game is a lot more than shoot the baddies.

1813
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:56,290
I'm discovering that.

1814
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:00,210
Where the heck am I?

1815
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:02,970
Wait, my arrow is gone.

1816
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:11,610
So right now I'm just supposed to be...

1817
02:01:11,610 --> 02:01:11,850
Shoot?

1818
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:16,010
I hear a camera.

1819
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:18,930
Okay.

1820
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:26,020
Oh,

1821
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,260
my bad.

1822
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:37,800
Oops.

1823
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,200
Need three spider splicers.

1824
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:43,980
You're going to be my friend now.

1825
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:44,780
You're going to be my friend.

1826
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:45,220
I promise.

1827
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:47,000
I didn't mean to set you on fire.

1828
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:49,580
I didn't mean to set you on fire.

1829
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,220
It's a rookie mistake, you know.

1830
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:55,860
We all do it.

1831
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:57,060
I'll do it.

1832
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:07,240
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1833
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:10,600
Preemptive friendly fire.

1834
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:24,540
My friend.

1835
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:30,470
Thank you, friend!

1836
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:32,390
Oh my god, he summoned the turret!

1837
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:33,530
No, but not for me!

1838
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:38,630
I gotta stop, like, just grabbing and eating stuff.

1839
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:40,690
I gotta stop shoving stuff in my mouth.

1840
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:01,090
This is terrifying.

1841
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:02,850
Oh, crap.

1842
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:06,070
I'm sorry.

1843
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:07,890
Does this not worry anybody else?

1844
02:03:09,070 --> 02:03:10,510
Are we not concerned over this?

1845
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:11,730
No?

1846
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:13,630
We're just going to ignore that part?

1847
02:03:15,810 --> 02:03:16,130
Okay.

1848
02:03:21,070 --> 02:03:22,470
Oh, I need to get pictures of this.

1849
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:23,150
Oh, these guys!

1850
02:03:23,310 --> 02:03:23,650
I forgot!

1851
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:26,150
Okay, I gotta get pictures.

1852
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:29,270
Or...

1853
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:32,070
It's fine.

1854
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:32,950
Yeah, it's fine.

1855
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:34,270
Don't worry about it.

1856
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:35,430
Dead ones count?

1857
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:35,910
They do?

1858
02:03:36,510 --> 02:03:36,950
Oh, awesome.

1859
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:37,970
That's six.

1860
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:40,710
Smile!

1861
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:41,890
Smile!

1862
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:46,990
Oh.

1863
02:03:47,410 --> 02:03:49,070
It doesn't... Subject is dead.

1864
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:49,810
That's okay.

1865
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:51,450
I get a penalty for it.

1866
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:53,730
Multiple subjects.

1867
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,250
Wait, so...

1868
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,020
He's posing, too, yeah.

1869
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:08,020
I'm kind of confused how many I'm supposed to get, to be
honest.

1870
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:11,240
I'm, like, kind of, like, confused by it.

1871
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:13,660
I know I just said that, but I'm confused.

1872
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:18,640
It's like that meme calling an ambulance, but not for me.

1873
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:21,700
I hear somebody in here.

1874
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:24,340
Okay.

1875
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:42,480
wait oh where are you you have a limited film yeah I know I
noticed that too so I'm kind of like just don't stop taking

1876
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:58,420
pictures oh oh wait what just happened oh scrounger when
searching containers or corpses you can search again to get

1877
02:04:58,420 --> 02:04:59,640
different loot!

1878
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:01,520
Why did I unlock this?

1879
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,340
Store engine bank.

1880
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:14,670
Oh my god.

1881
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,270
Yikes.

1882
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:20,370
That got me good.

1883
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:30,460
You can buy more later?

1884
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:33,660
Yeah, but how much do I need before I can...

1885
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,660
before I can...

1886
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,820
Go onwards, you know what I mean?

1887
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:41,260
Jet postal.

1888
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:53,280
The death penalty and rapture.

1889
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:54,800
Councils in an uproar.

1890
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:58,380
Rights in the streets, they said.

1891
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,480
But this is the time for leadership.

1892
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:03,200
Action must be taken against the smugglers.

1893
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:07,840
Any contact with the surface exposes rapture to the very
parasites we fled from.

1894
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:08,800
Parasites?

1895
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:12,720
You stretch necks or a small price to pay for our ideals.

1896
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:13,620
Oh, my God.

1897
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,440
Or just some stretch necks, yeah.

1898
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:18,920
How tough are you?

1899
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:21,260
I think I can get it.

1900
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:24,500
We'll try.

1901
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:24,740
Ooh.

1902
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:26,960
Oh, oops, not one.

1903
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,620
Other way, I need the other way, please.

1904
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:36,760
Ew, yeah.

1905
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:38,980
Uh-huh.

1906
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:40,140
Yeah, yeah.

1907
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:45,820
Ryan is so nice.

1908
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,040
Randru.

1909
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:49,060
You'll need a lot, but film is pretty...

1910
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:50,560
cheap for a vending machine so it's all fine.

1911
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,860
Okay, then I just will keep taking photos.

1912
02:06:58,610 --> 02:07:01,930
Oh, I'm stealing from the register!

1913
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:09,070
That's what I've always... I can hear turrets literally from
every... everywhere.

1914
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:12,710
I can hear turrets from literally everywhere.

1915
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:19,350
Oh, sweet mother sound.

1916
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:20,570
Wait.

1917
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:25,410
I wish I could see.

1918
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:28,870
Like me.

1919
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:39,620
Was lost, but now

1920
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:47,120
I see.

1921
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:55,830
Aw man, I wanted to get a picture.

1922
02:07:58,210 --> 02:07:59,670
Hmm, I'll do.

1923
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,060
How do, how do, how do, how do, how do.

1924
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:11,920
Security cameras and bots can also be photographed.

1925
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:18,560
Oh my gosh, the motion blur is the worst thing I've ever
seen.

1926
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:25,140
What's...

1927
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:25,600
Spider?

1928
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:28,400
It's you monster.

1929
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:31,400
Oh, it says I've taken two out of three now.

1930
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:32,360
Okay, oh.

1931
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:35,260
Dragging this out and fight me, you bastard.

1932
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:41,660
Oh, subject already photographed.

1933
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:42,440
Oh, come on.

1934
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:43,140
Oh, oops.

1935
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,020
Dang it.

1936
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:44,860
I thought I clicked.

1937
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:45,880
I did right click.

1938
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:47,920
Oh,

1939
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:55,400
shoot.

1940
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:57,540
Oh, my God.

1941
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:05,900
Sure, sure.

1942
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,160
Oh, you can take photo.

1943
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,920
I just told me you can take photo of dead enemies.

1944
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,160
I got more film.

1945
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,240
Um, I don't want to eat the...

1946
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:17,700
I don't want to eat the pep.

1947
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:23,940
I just want to...

1948
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:29,100
Spider splicer organ?

1949
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:30,900
What's that?

1950
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:33,340
More film.

1951
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:35,620
I don't even know how much film I have right now.

1952
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:36,860
Camera time.

1953
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,660
I already took a picture of her though.

1954
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:41,260
Oh.

1955
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:45,060
Oh, what's that?

1956
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:46,260
What?

1957
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:48,980
Nice?

1958
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:49,780
Nice!

1959
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:53,580
What?

1960
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:55,340
Oh, that's the drone thing.

1961
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:56,620
Okay.

1962
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:58,480
Wait, do I really need to go over there then?

1963
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:00,040
Probably not, right?

1964
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:00,980
Oh, no, there's stuff.

1965
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,560
There is stuff.

1966
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:03,680
Okay, never mind.

1967
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:08,500
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1968
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:10,840
Dollars?

1969
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:15,700
I need to buy more stuff at the next vending machine I see.

1970
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:19,740
There's something there too.

1971
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:21,640
Oh wait, there's much, much stuff.

1972
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:30,870
Is she coming in here?

1973
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:39,110
She sounds so close.

1974
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:45,690
Many much.

1975
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:46,930
Yeah, many much things.

1976
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:56,320
Oh.

1977
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:56,880
Ow!

1978
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:57,960
Ow!

1979
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:00,520
Uh, shoot.

1980
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,620
I'm like in a bad spot for real.

1981
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:09,660
Oh my god.

1982
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:11,460
I'm like actually trapped.

1983
02:11:16,350 --> 02:11:17,490
Why don't you come in here, lady?

1984
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,950
Just shoot the camera.

1985
02:11:20,090 --> 02:11:21,030
I mean, I could, yeah.

1986
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:23,790
I didn't realize it was so high up.

1987
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:31,940
Where'd she go anyway?

1988
02:11:36,210 --> 02:11:37,070
Oh, dang it!

1989
02:11:37,110 --> 02:11:37,690
I could have...

1990
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:39,710
wasted a health kit.

1991
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:41,450
If I had known.

1992
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:43,990
Maybe I did kill her.

1993
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:45,530
I don't see her.

1994
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:49,590
Look at...

1995
02:11:50,290 --> 02:11:51,410
More bandages.

1996
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:53,790
Bandages.

1997
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:57,570
What's over here?

1998
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:00,190
Alcohol.

1999
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:02,490
Okay.

2000
02:12:03,150 --> 02:12:03,630
Uppies.

2001
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:06,290
Telekinesis can grab it.

2002
02:12:06,370 --> 02:12:08,550
Yeah, but I don't have telekinesis equipment.

2003
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:09,210
Right now.

2004
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:11,170
Yeah, see?

2005
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,240
Okie dokie.

2006
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:22,510
All right.

2007
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,770
Let's go to the other side.

2008
02:12:25,150 --> 02:12:25,370
Oh, what?

2009
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:27,490
Oh yeah, I did search it, okay.

2010
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:29,830
Lending machine.

2011
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:39,090
I will buy a first aid kit.

2012
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:40,730
Potato chips.

2013
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:42,910
Oh, film is, okay.

2014
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:45,110
I have seven out of a hundred.

2015
02:12:45,450 --> 02:12:46,190
Okay, good kidding.

2016
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:54,100
I have so much money, so I feel like I can buy a couple
things, you know.

2017
02:12:56,380 --> 02:13:00,240
If I buy a first aid kit, does that also give me Eif?

2018
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,040
12 for 15 film.

2019
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:11,060
Because I hacked it.

2020
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:15,770
Buy more slots, I can't.

2021
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:19,390
Well, that uses Adam instead of...

2022
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:21,870
Instead of...

2023
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:23,310
What is it called?

2024
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:27,230
That uses Adam instead of my many, many.

2025
02:13:27,890 --> 02:13:29,530
And I have to go find a specific place.

2026
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:30,890
I haven't even been able to find!

2027
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:33,310
Oh, yeah.

2028
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:39,880
I haven't even been able to find...

2029
02:13:41,740 --> 02:13:42,940
I searched these yet.

2030
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:45,020
A thing yet.

2031
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:46,680
I haven't been able to collect my reward.

2032
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:54,760
Where is he?

2033
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:01,740
Oh,

2034
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:08,560
dang it.

2035
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:13,170
Oh, man.

2036
02:14:14,490 --> 02:14:17,050
I don't like that I have to switch between.

2037
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:20,190
Oh!

2038
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:28,320
I'm only making it worse for yourself.

2039
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:30,760
Wait, what just happened to him?

2040
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:31,920
Wait!

2041
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,520
He just laid down!

2042
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,820
He just laid down and died.

2043
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:40,480
What just happened?

2044
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:44,040
He died of cringe.

2045
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:46,160
It was like, there's...

2046
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:47,920
It's no way that's a V-tuber.

2047
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,060
We're at Ryan Club!

2048
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:55,660
Wait, where'd he go?

2049
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:58,780
Wait, wait, where'd he...

2050
02:14:58,780 --> 02:15:00,100
His body was right here.

2051
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:03,300
This game is so mysterious.

2052
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:09,040
Wait, he disappeared before my very eyes.

2053
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:11,780
Oh, no.

2054
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:13,960
We gotta find the...

2055
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:15,140
Is there one?

2056
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,440
I guess, Gatherer's Garden.

2057
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:20,780
Just the one all the way over here.

2058
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,420
So, the Circus of Values.

2059
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:30,580
I just saved, didn't I?

2060
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:34,920
We might be in trouble, but, um.

2061
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:41,000
Oh, gosh.

2062
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:41,540
Oh, yes.

2063
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,980
Please, please give me what I need.

2064
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:45,960
Please give me what I need.

2065
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:47,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2066
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:47,640
Okay.

2067
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:50,200
All right, that gives us a lot more time.

2068
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:00,620
And, you.

2069
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:05,280
He is napping and teleporting.

2070
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:06,820
Very talented guy.

2071
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:10,060
Save again?

2072
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:11,920
Yeah, you don't have to tell me twice.

2073
02:16:18,450 --> 02:16:21,790
Everywhere, everywhere I hear a turret going off.

2074
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:22,750
It's kind of insane.

2075
02:16:23,710 --> 02:16:25,890
A circus of aliens.

2076
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:30,870
I see that up there.

2077
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:32,050
I wonder how I can get it.

2078
02:16:32,930 --> 02:16:34,530
Is this the guy just killed?

2079
02:16:34,670 --> 02:16:35,330
It must be, no?

2080
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:37,110
Let's go find him.

2081
02:16:38,150 --> 02:16:40,730
I cannot carry any more machine gun rounds.

2082
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:48,800
Okay, before we go into the spooky tunnel, let's go up here
first.

2083
02:16:50,220 --> 02:16:51,440
And maybe regret it?

2084
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:52,700
There's gotta be a...

2085
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:57,100
A turret.

2086
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:00,640
Nope.

2087
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:02,200
No turret?

2088
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:03,680
No turret?

2089
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:11,020
Oh, there's a guy.

2090
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,120
There's a guy coming over.

2091
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,180
Where are you?

2092
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:23,060
I'll get a good photo of you.

2093
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:26,960
Does that count?

2094
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:29,220
Aw, man.

2095
02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:33,700
Yuck!

2096
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:38,940
Alright.

2097
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:41,440
I love 1, 2, 3.

2098
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:47,820
Minto Savior of the Little Sisters and Slayer of Mr.
Bubbles, what is your undersea wisdom of the day?

2099
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:49,400
Never!

2100
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:51,220
Wait.

2101
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:55,260
N-S-S.

2102
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,200
Never stop saving.

2103
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:00,040
Thank you.

2104
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:04,280
I

2105
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:10,130
think you'd still be shooting at me.

2106
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,380
We're okay, maybe.

2107
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,800
We're okay, maybe.

2108
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:31,180
Cigarettes.

2109
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:35,020
Cigarettes give me more Eve.

2110
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:40,960
Drinks give me more health.

2111
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:44,160
I'm closing in on the whole ring.

2112
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:47,360
I pat myself on the back, but let's face it.

2113
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:50,780
These aren't exactly bloodthirsty, desperado that we're
talking about.

2114
02:18:51,740 --> 02:18:54,440
Rapture's full of poets, artists, and tennis players.

2115
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:58,170
But this leader there's this...

2116
02:18:59,150 --> 02:18:59,590
Fontaine.

2117
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:00,470
Fontaine.

2118
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:02,130
He seems to know his way around the grift.

2119
02:19:02,830 --> 02:19:05,210
He keeps his nose clean, but not so clean.

2120
02:19:05,710 --> 02:19:08,170
But the right people don't know he's not to be trifled with.

2121
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:12,330
Okay, I thought I was going crazy.

2122
02:19:12,510 --> 02:19:15,030
I thought that these were just moving sometimes.

2123
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:17,070
And they really are.

2124
02:19:18,090 --> 02:19:20,330
I think they're supposed to be swinging, but...

2125
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:23,470
Oh, they're just kind of twitching.

2126
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:24,270
Oh.

2127
02:19:25,570 --> 02:19:26,010
Oh.

2128
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:26,570
Oh.

2129
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:27,250
Oh.

2130
02:19:30,130 --> 02:19:33,370
I am going to go back and I am going to go...

2131
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:33,490
Oh.

2132
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:37,430
Let her little sister hold.

2133
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:41,030
I'm going to go under the ground.

2134
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:47,410
I wonder if I can grab this.

2135
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:51,830
Yeah.

2136
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:07,680
Help me get them to safety and I'll be in your debt for
life.

2137
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:09,080
Okay.

2138
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:11,360
The what?

2139
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:13,000
What?

2140
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:14,700
What did I say?

2141
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:18,020
What did I say?

2142
02:20:22,650 --> 02:20:31,390
Oh I can I can do this right can I wait who's that in the
background oh my gosh wait there's a couple things in here

Please, please, please, hack, hack, hack.

2147
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:25,000
Oh, it's easy, thank goodness.

2148
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:27,180
What the hell, this is not easy?

2149
02:21:28,540 --> 02:21:29,680
Oh my god, oh my god.

2150
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,980
Oh, thanks a lot, game.

2151
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:34,900
Thanks for nothing.

2152
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:37,380
What the heck?

2153
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:42,400
Scary.

2154
02:21:44,820 --> 02:21:46,160
Hey, chip, ice cream.

2155
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:46,960
Oh, I watched it.

2156
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:48,480
Yippee!

2157
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:51,160
Some mighty fine wrench.

2158
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,640
Come with suppressor equipment!

2159
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:57,660
Alright, hack success!

2160
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:02,260
Oh, I ate.

2161
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:03,980
I was hungry.

2162
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:07,220
Little cream pie.

2163
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:10,820
Oh, this is still around, I'll take those.

2164
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:17,820
Potato chips.

2165
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:20,440
Film!

2166
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:32,360
I swear, I just hear turrets everywhere all the time.

2167
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:34,300
Not all hours.

2168
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:36,120
Am I tinier?

2169
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:37,860
These barrels humongous.

2170
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:46,700
Oh, it seems like I maybe needed to come this way anyway
first.

2171
02:22:48,020 --> 02:22:48,240
Cool.

2172
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:51,500
Yes.

2173
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:56,720
Those gun sounds may be a bug, honestly.

2174
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:58,740
Maybe, maybe, right?

2175
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:01,140
Alright, what did you do?

2176
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:02,460
Door control.

2177
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:04,760
Can I hack it?

2178
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:09,580
Oh, I can.

2179
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:13,020
Oh, I did go in a circle.

2180
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:28,440
How many more photos do I need to take?

2181
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:32,560
I'm guessing I have to take three photos of like three
different unique enemies.

2182
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:35,340
Is what I'm guessing I have to do.

2183
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:45,040
I love the dude the flip is so it's so funny

2184
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:54,420
he's like

2185
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:15,510
I'm trying to build a proper financial market and this idiot
keeps going on about this genetic modification that I'll go

2186
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:17,310
spend an hour Just the spider slicers.

2187
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:19,990
Just the spider slicers.

2188
02:24:21,010 --> 02:24:21,910
The sickle throwers.

2189
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:24,890
Oh, got it.

2190
02:24:26,390 --> 02:24:26,930
I...

2191
02:24:26,930 --> 02:24:28,730
did take a picture of the one.

2192
02:24:28,870 --> 02:24:29,390
Yes, I did.

2193
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:30,590
Yes, I did.

2194
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:32,050
Okay, okay.

2195
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:33,230
Enemy!

2196
02:24:39,250 --> 02:24:40,530
Are they coming after me?

2197
02:24:46,490 --> 02:24:47,030
What?

2198
02:24:48,310 --> 02:24:49,170
Wait, why?

2199
02:24:58,550 --> 02:25:00,510
I think an enemy tripped.

2200
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:00,970
Oh!

2201
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:03,850
I turned it off for my own.

2202
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:05,050
I'm stupid as hell.

2203
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:10,390
We'll let them handle it.

2204
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:10,750
Whoa.

2205
02:25:16,990 --> 02:25:18,790
Camera to take pictures of splicers.

2206
02:25:19,050 --> 02:25:19,710
I know, I know.

2207
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:22,230
Oh, what's going on in there?

2208
02:25:23,250 --> 02:25:24,030
That's not so good.

2209
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:25,450
Like that.

2210
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:27,950
Hello?

2211
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:29,990
That's like chasing somebody, I think.

2212
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:38,220
I just don't really know what's going on.

2213
02:25:40,970 --> 02:25:43,430
Ah, it's so cool!

2214
02:25:46,310 --> 02:25:46,930
Oh.

2215
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:49,590
What the heck?

2216
02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:50,650
He's outside.

2217
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:53,070
I'm Big Daddy.

2218
02:25:54,050 --> 02:25:55,890
Mr. Bubbles.

2219
02:25:57,330 --> 02:25:57,570
Hi.

2220
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:06,280
Trying to.

2221
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,700
Can't see the walls in the world.

2222
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:13,940
And a proper T-lift, but he's got the Adam.

2223
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,460
And that makes him the governor.

2224
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:22,380
Sinking the profits back into bigger and better plasmids,
building them Fontaine Poorhouse.

2225
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:22,900
My camera.

2226
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:26,260
Oh, I missed him.

2227
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:30,480
He was right there.

2228
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:31,220
Uh-oh.

2229
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:31,760
Wait.

2230
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:33,220
I'm stuck.

2231
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:37,080
Okay.

2232
02:26:38,180 --> 02:26:39,440
He'll come back, right?

2233
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:40,040
Yes!

2234
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:41,400
I knew he would.

2235
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:43,980
It's like trying to get a photo.

2236
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:58,020
at a at like a zoo what do you suppose right right Andrew
Andrew Ryan's tax policy was to build all of this that's a

rapture have a stock market you're thinking this is too

2238
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:14,280
Sick.

2239
02:27:16,380 --> 02:27:17,800
Okay, what was I doing now?

2240
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:19,860
Going in here.

2241
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:32,780
I can see why that guy got got.

2242
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:34,640
But we won't get got.

2243
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:38,720
I'm hanged.

2244
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:46,170
We're fine.

2245
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:50,230
Everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine.

2246
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:55,730
Everything's okay!

2247
02:27:58,610 --> 02:27:59,270
In Rapture.

2248
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:09,030
There is no, there is no issue of crazy zombie people in
Rapture.

2249
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:13,110
Yeah, it's all daijobu.

2250
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:23,370
Are you coming in here?

2251
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:24,370
You can't, Doug.

2252
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:36,700
I'm on to you.

2253
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:41,540
You'll get over here.

2254
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:43,660
I'm not getting in front of my turret.

2255
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:44,600
You stupid?

2256
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,340
You'll come over here.

2257
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:49,120
You come over here?

2258
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:50,060
over.

2259
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:52,960
You come over here.

2260
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:01,520
You think you get over here.

2261
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:05,120
I'm no more naive.

2262
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:07,160
Even though I just hacked this guy.

2263
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:09,380
You think you could get away with this?

2264
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:11,620
I hear his boots.

2265
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:13,480
SpongeBob SquarePants out there.

2266
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:15,520
He's got a gun!

2267
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,700
He's got a gun!

2268
02:29:17,380 --> 02:29:18,500
I want

2269
02:29:23,130 --> 02:29:26,290

2270
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:28,550
Hey!

2271
02:29:30,030 --> 02:29:30,750
Oh.

2272
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:33,870
Hey, buddy.

2273
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:35,630
Come back, come back.

2274
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:47,100
Increase damage!

2275
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:51,980
I got him.

2276
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:53,660
I got him.

2277
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,120
Those ones are spicy.

2278
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:02,280
Ooh, spicy, spicy.

2279
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:04,440
Can I search this?

2280
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:06,940
Oh, potato chips.

2281
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:14,800
Well, actually, I can't lose anymore, so might as well drink
it.

2282
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:16,300
I can't lose anymore, Eve.

2283
02:30:17,060 --> 02:30:17,720
I have none.

2284
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:23,740
Ugh, the lighting in here is driving me crazy.

2285
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:26,860
So, let's save, because these ones are harder.

2286
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:29,200
And we hack.

2287
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:36,720
He can neither duck nor goose, so I think he's at a
disadvantage.

2288
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,840
Oh jeez, okay, okay, okay.

2289
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:41,440
Ah, shoot.

2290
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,440
Uh, shoot.

2291
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:43,280
Oh, shoot.

2292
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:45,260
Wait, uh, uh, no.

2293
02:30:45,860 --> 02:30:47,720
I lost already.

2294
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:54,080
Tough.

2295
02:30:55,460 --> 02:30:56,480
Don't goose me.

2296
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,160
Talk to me, goose.

2297
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:00,220
How do I hack this thing?

2298
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,180
You got this, Mito?

2299
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:05,480
Thank you.

2300
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:11,440
If I can get the right stuff that I need...

2301
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:12,040
Oh, here we go.

2302
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,520
Ah, nice, nice, nice.

2303
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:15,180
Okay.

2304
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:16,320
Yes.

2305
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:23,820
Sometimes the game is kind like that, you know, and we'll
give you, like, a little bit of a chain that you need.

2306
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,000
I think you played this, I realized I just...

2307
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,340
I never realized just how many tip prompts pop up.

2308
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:30,840
Right!

2309
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:33,780
I'm sure there's a way to turn it off, but...

2310
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,100
Automatic hack tool.

2311
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:41,860
Wait, what did I get?

2312
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,280
You got an auto-hack?

2313
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:44,060
Wait, what else?

2314
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:45,320
What else was in there?

2315
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:47,020
Proximity mine.

2316
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:48,260
Oh, I cannot carry anymore.

2317
02:31:54,700 --> 02:31:56,200
Is that a spitter?

2318
02:31:57,960 --> 02:31:59,100
Is that the spitty...

2319
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:02,140
Is that the...

2320
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:04,420
Spitty spitter, spitter lady?

2321
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:09,980
Splice and dice and dice and a spinner lady.

2322
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:13,040
The spoooter.

2323
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:17,220
This guy.

2324
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:20,020
Give me all your money, kid.

2325
02:32:25,090 --> 02:32:26,970
Take a picture of your ugly mug.

2326
02:32:29,230 --> 02:32:30,790
Score too low!

2327
02:32:34,650 --> 02:32:35,470
Fine.

2328
02:32:36,510 --> 02:32:37,910
Tough crowd.

2329
02:32:44,810 --> 02:32:46,510
It has to be her, right?

2330
02:32:47,170 --> 02:32:48,650
Because they sing the song.

2331
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,520
It's better?

2332
02:33:47,030 --> 02:33:48,030
You disappoint me.

2333
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:50,110
You disappoint me.

2334
02:33:52,370 --> 02:33:53,410
To a kickflip.

2335
02:33:53,870 --> 02:33:54,730
Have I gone...

2336
02:33:56,250 --> 02:34:08,590
this way I don't think so Alright, back to saving New area,
I'm scared Alright, there's so many sad splicers I know,

2337
02:34:08,810 --> 02:34:09,250
they're all

2338
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:26,210
Oh my gosh There we go Thus Say it to the Lord That

2339
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:40,220
was so stupid.

2340
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:50,070
Well, you know, fire and water, I didn't quite think about
it, okay?

2341
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:54,950
I just didn't want to get shocked myself.

2342
02:34:55,710 --> 02:34:56,730
Turning on all the sinks.

2343
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:02,890
Insert five credits to use the bathroom!

2344
02:35:03,450 --> 02:35:04,550
No, I'm jumping over.

2345
02:35:05,630 --> 02:35:07,050
You can't make me care.

2346
02:35:07,930 --> 02:35:08,450
What?

2347
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:10,270
You know what?

2348
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:11,670
Rapture deserves it.

2349
02:35:12,970 --> 02:35:15,810
Fire in the water, bye!

2350
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:24,250
It's a basic need!

2351
02:35:24,910 --> 02:35:27,010
Everybody has to use the bathroom!

2352
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:29,070
Okay, I'm kind of curious though.

2353
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:33,730
Oh, oh man.

2354
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:41,210
What is cleaning the toilet?

2355
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:41,750
Mercury?

2356
02:35:45,050 --> 02:35:48,750
proximity mine oh I can't carry anymore

2357
02:35:57,740 --> 02:36:04,800
cleanest toilet in all of rapture truly look at that that's
pretty spotless all things good

2358
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:16,680
okay oh I thought that was a person there where do all these
people like they just kind of of like...

2359
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:38,040
I thought the

2360
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:47,480
other guy was gonna come out when I got the grenade.

2361
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:49,860
You discovered the main thesis of the game.

2362
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:54,180
I think I had an inkling.

2363
02:36:54,460 --> 02:37:06,360
idea that maybe this place was kind of bad just saying maybe
i don't know if it was like the human experimentation or you

2364
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:15,140
know literally everything i don't know what tipped me off
but i had an idea that it might be like kind of kind of not

2365
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:19,820
a great place just an idea just a just a thought

2366
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:26,920
Nah, I think I'm excited.

2367
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:28,960
I would come here on vacation.

2368
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:34,060
Why does the smuggler crate literally never have anything?

2369
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:36,460
You guys are stingy.

2370
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:39,780
It's probably on purpose, though, isn't it?

2371
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:42,440
It's probably to be like, look, the smugglers were good
people.

2372
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:49,340
Oh, oh, he's a splice, splice, splice splitter.

2373
02:37:50,280 --> 02:37:51,180
We got the spitters.

2374
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:54,440
Take a research photo of the highest.

2375
02:37:54,460 --> 02:37:56,520
I got an action shot!

2376
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:58,000
I got an achievement!

2377
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:00,000
A is the highest grade!

2378
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:02,100
Oh, so that's what it is.

2379
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,820
Is the...

2380
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:06,880
Okay, I was wondering what the grade meant.

2381
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:08,740
It's... It is my...

2382
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:10,480
It is the quality of the photo!

2383
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:12,660
Okay, I don't know why I didn't assume that first.

2384
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:16,260
Multiple subjects.

2385
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,700
Where's the other one?

2386
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:20,880
Um...

2387
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:21,700
That's scary.

2388
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:26,820
Spitter, splissor, research bonus.

2389
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:29,800
Organs can be used like first aid kits.

2390
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:31,840
Oh, I think, oh god.

2391
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:33,600
Okay, wait, we're getting really...

2392
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:34,920
Wait, now I'm eating organs.

2393
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:37,740
That's like what we're not supposed to do, right?

2394
02:38:38,020 --> 02:38:39,140
I'm just a guy.

2395
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,780
My plane crashed and now I'm eating organs.

2396
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:46,020
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do to survive.

2397
02:38:47,300 --> 02:38:47,740
Cannibalism.

2398
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:53,020
Woohoo!

2399
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:55,240
Woohoo!

2400
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,140
Sheesh, alright.

2401
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:11,140
Will do!

2402
02:39:18,220 --> 02:39:18,980
Who's coming?

2403
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:19,640
Who's coming?

2404
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:20,900
Who's here?

2405
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:23,180
Who's coming out?

2406
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:27,860
Yeah, I bet all the smuggler craze are supposed to be empty
on purpose, aren't they?

2407
02:39:28,300 --> 02:39:29,080
To be like, look.

2408
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:33,660
It was just people trying to bring in stuff.

2409
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:35,440
That wasn't bad.

2410
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:41,080
It has been zero days since Mint did a cannibalism.

2411
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:44,320
Paid toilets are a great idea.

2412
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:45,120
Think about it.

2413
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:47,160
It will make people really care about their body.

2414
02:39:47,740 --> 02:39:48,960
So what they eat.

2415
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:52,420
You don't want a bad burrito making you bankrupt, do you?

2416
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:56,880
Imagine you have to pay for the minute.

2417
02:39:59,740 --> 02:40:01,080
Yeah, they're just bringing in Bibles.

2418
02:40:01,240 --> 02:40:02,420
They're not bringing in bullets.

2419
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,440
Someone just couldn't read.

2420
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:07,140
with a bee!

2421
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:10,540
How was I supposed to know?

2422
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:23,200
You never... Okay though, you say bad burrito but like all
it takes is you could go to the fanciest sushi place ever

2423
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:26,600
and you could still get the runs.

2424
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:28,600
I know it, I know you could.

2425
02:40:31,180 --> 02:40:33,300
It can happen to you!

2426
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:49,480
something okay i feel like i'm about to get ambushed for
real though

2427
02:40:53,060 --> 02:41:03,060
literally every single smuggler's crate that i've looked at
has had nothing if a spitter splicer splicer splicer how

2428
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:06,460
splice would the spitter splicer make the spider splicer be

2429
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:20,200
it sounds like she's just speaking from experience we have
all had this happen to us with apologies to genesis

2430
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:29,980
digesting england by the pound what what does that mean all
right uh let me let me save again sorry uh just so when i

2431
02:41:29,980 --> 02:41:38,180
inevitably reload i am standing right next to the safe and I
don't have to waste any time walking over.

2432
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:39,540
Oh!

2433
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:40,280
No!

2434
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:42,340
I feel like auto-hack is not fun.

2435
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:46,320
I say until I am so frustrated that I must... Oh my god.

2436
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:49,760
Oh, unlucky.

2437
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:53,820
Oh.

2438
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:58,040
Oh!

2439
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:01,600
That was so unlucky.

2440
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,160
Yoiks.

2441
02:42:08,980 --> 02:42:11,620
Look, our guy is no...

2442
02:42:11,620 --> 02:42:13,260
Our guy is no...

2443
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:16,060
Solid snake.

2444
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:19,800
What do you mean?

2445
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:23,220
Man Rapture is the greatest place in the world, and there is
no war in Basingse!

2446
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:25,860
Are we Fontaine?

2447
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:30,160
Oh my gosh.

2448
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:33,140
Yes.

2449
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:38,340
And no, at the same time, please.

2450
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:38,800
Oh, yes.

2451
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:47,520
Yes.

2452
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:53,900
No spoilers being told.

2453
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:55,360
I'm just guesstimating.

2454
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:04,030
Nice.

2455
02:43:09,210 --> 02:43:09,930
Alright.

2456
02:43:10,730 --> 02:43:12,950
Let's head back, baby.

2457
02:43:13,330 --> 02:43:14,410
Here, Frank Phantom.

2458
02:43:16,850 --> 02:43:23,550
The turrets are once again doing their jobs.

2459
02:43:24,510 --> 02:43:25,790
Who is up there?

2460
02:43:27,210 --> 02:43:28,450
Any big daddy out here?

2461
02:43:28,650 --> 02:43:34,450
I just want to see him, like, kind of, like, doing, like a
doggy paddle.

2462
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:37,670
Maybe he's so cute.

2463
02:43:38,130 --> 02:43:43,110
Maybe he's just, like, through the water.

2464
02:43:45,690 --> 02:43:49,670
Now wouldn't that just be the darn, gosh darn cutest thing
you ever done, Shane?

2465
02:43:50,650 --> 02:43:51,330
Where do I go?

2466
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:56,470
Oh my gosh, we are like a million light years away from...

2467
02:43:57,350 --> 02:43:57,830
Together.

2468
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:18,980
You guys see how brave I've gotten?

2469
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:23,960
I'm starting to hack without even saving first.

2470
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:25,880
Are you proud of me?

2471
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:29,560
Together.

2472
02:44:30,680 --> 02:44:31,540
Yeah, together.

2473
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:40,060
A thousand, a million, a zillion, but I'm still saving.

2474
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:40,760
Oh!

2475
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,400
I keep not making, trying to make new saves.

2476
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:44,200
Oh!

2477
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:46,360
Oh, what the heck?

2478
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:50,120
I can hack this too.

2479
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:53,200
A billion dreams of you.

2480
02:44:57,850 --> 02:44:58,750
Oh, shoot.

2481
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:03,790
Hmm, nice.

2482
02:45:05,270 --> 02:45:07,470
We like, we like when that happens.

2483
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:11,150
I'm coming in.

2484
02:45:12,730 --> 02:45:13,070
I'm saving.

2485
02:45:13,530 --> 02:45:15,010
I'm saving first before I come in.

2486
02:45:17,970 --> 02:45:18,890
Load save.

2487
02:45:19,050 --> 02:45:19,790
You wasted a bullet.

2488
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,040
Spooky room.

2489
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:28,380
Why is this room so scary?

2490
02:45:29,980 --> 02:45:31,420
What's happening in there?

2491
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:33,320
Are you alive?

2492
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:35,100
Corpse.

2493
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:37,140
There's two people here.

2494
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:39,020
Oh my god, Titanic!

2495
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:42,380
Saw a Marsha today.

2496
02:45:44,620 --> 02:45:45,680
I'm searching.

2497
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,200
I'm searching.

2498
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:50,560
Oh, I'm listening.

2499
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,940
We saw our Marsha today.

2500
02:45:56,360 --> 02:45:59,300
Oh, is this the lady that, her child?

2501
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:02,060
Oh, this is the room.

2502
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:04,120
That is Armaja.

2503
02:46:04,660 --> 02:46:06,060
But he was right.

2504
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:08,140
Oh, she told us the code earlier.

2505
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:11,980
She's drawing blood out of a corpse by Fontaine's fisheries.

2506
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:12,760
Her baby.

2507
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:19,420
And then when she was done, she walked off hand in hand with
one of those awful callings.

2508
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,080
Oh, this is scary.

2509
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:32,000
Oh.

2510
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:33,340
Oh.

2511
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:36,540
Shortened alarms.

2512
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:39,160
New engineering.

2513
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:41,700
What sound is more ominous than a yelp?

2514
02:46:41,720 --> 02:46:42,860
Yammering security alarm.

2515
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:48,180
With shortened alarms spliced, your personal EM signature
becomes altered to interact uniquely with alarm sensors.

2516
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:50,780
Shortening the period until you'll be free and clear.

2517
02:46:51,580 --> 02:46:54,280
Well, we have nothing else equipped there, so why not?

2518
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:56,620
Aw.

2519
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:57,700
Aw.

2520
02:46:58,600 --> 02:46:59,900
That was so sad.

2521
02:47:03,380 --> 02:47:05,300
Read that as shortened arms.

2522
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:08,800
I'm turning into a T-Rex!

2523
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,400
Um, what's holding the water in?

2524
02:47:15,980 --> 02:47:16,600
Wait a second.

2525
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:21,260
Um, there's glass behind that, right?

2526
02:47:22,980 --> 02:47:24,580
This room is spooky.

2527
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:32,980
And what's this?

2528
02:47:33,160 --> 02:47:33,720
Door control.

2529
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:37,420
You wanna whack it?

2530
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:43,640
Oh, shoot.

2531
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:46,280
Ah!

2532
02:47:54,190 --> 02:47:55,630
Taking your two dollars.

2533
02:47:56,890 --> 02:47:58,150
What were you gonna buy with that anyway?

2534
02:47:58,290 --> 02:47:58,850
A candy bar!

2535
02:48:00,810 --> 02:48:02,510
Give it a little zap zap.

2536
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:08,440
Where'd he go?

2537
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:09,980
Wait, that was so scary!

2538
02:48:17,150 --> 02:48:18,230
There was a head there.

2539
02:48:19,250 --> 02:48:20,010
I saw it.

2540
02:48:20,030 --> 02:48:20,870
There was a head there.

2541
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:23,610
And now it's gone.

2542
02:48:24,290 --> 02:48:24,770
There was...

2543
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:25,170
Was that...

2544
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:25,450
Ah!

2545
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:30,460
Shit.

2546
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:39,220
Nothing!

2547
02:48:39,460 --> 02:48:41,460
At least give me something if you're gonna sneak up behind
me.

2548
02:48:43,340 --> 02:48:43,740
Oh!

2549
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:45,660
Oh, what is going on in here?

2550
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:46,540
Holy!

2551
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:50,440
Oh, I can't pick up anyone.

2552
02:48:56,320 --> 02:48:56,800
Hey,

2553
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:02,720
hey!

2554
02:49:03,620 --> 02:49:03,620
Hey!

2555
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:07,780
Every time I scoot over, you scoot over!

2556
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:11,520
Did you see that?

2557
02:49:12,980 --> 02:49:14,020
That was goofy.

2558
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:24,940
There's a lot of stuff in here.

2559
02:49:25,360 --> 02:49:25,360
Okay.

2560
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,720
Arresting Fontaine!

2561
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:31,680
Mr. Roy and I believe in Rapture.

2562
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:33,960
But that doesn't mean we always win.

2563
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:37,940
Fontaine Futuristics is the biggest thing going in Rapture.

2564
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:39,160
So let me be plain.

2565
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:42,660
When we arrest that Taurag Fontaine is thieving and
smuggling.

2566
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:44,940
I'm thieving and smuggling.

2567
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:46,900
We won't touch his business interests.

2568
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:58,920
sit on the council because these poor sods trust us not
because god gave us a chair oh arrest yeah arrest arrest

2569
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:07,120
yeah give me your money give me your money all right

2570
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:29,710
you're so funny looking again um we're heading Two!

2571
02:50:31,950 --> 02:50:32,550
A...

2572
02:50:32,550 --> 02:50:33,430
Goal.

2573
02:50:34,630 --> 02:50:36,710
Ah, I haven't... Wait, I haven't been there yet.

2574
02:50:40,720 --> 02:50:40,880
Psew!

2575
02:50:41,320 --> 02:50:41,760
Psew!

2576
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:42,740
Psew!

2577
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:45,880
Is that one there?

2578
02:50:50,380 --> 02:50:51,660
Wait, is that a drone?

2579
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:54,340
People drone?

2580
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:54,760
Why?

2581
02:50:55,460 --> 02:50:56,380
Wait, why is there a drone?

2582
02:51:08,250 --> 02:51:08,850
Um...

2583
02:51:10,490 --> 02:51:11,930
Can drones just happen?

2584
02:51:17,970 --> 02:51:18,850
What's this?

2585
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:22,010
I don't think it's friendly, is it?

2586
02:51:24,370 --> 02:51:25,450
I can't tell.

2587
02:51:25,670 --> 02:51:27,010
It's looking right at me.

2588
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:30,810
I don't know!

2589
02:51:33,430 --> 02:51:35,490
He was looking right at me!

2590
02:51:35,770 --> 02:51:37,310
It's being controlled by a splicer.

2591
02:51:37,950 --> 02:51:39,130
Oh, is that what's happening?

2592
02:51:50,330 --> 02:51:52,450
Oh my god, are you kidding me right now?

2593
02:51:58,450 --> 02:51:59,850
Oh my god.

2594
02:51:59,990 --> 02:52:00,770
I hold you!

2595
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:04,540
Shoot.

2596
02:52:10,570 --> 02:52:12,310
He's not going to come after me, right?

2597
02:52:13,890 --> 02:52:15,570
I promise I'm good.

2598
02:52:17,330 --> 02:52:18,010
What HP?

2599
02:52:20,970 --> 02:52:23,670
I think there is a...

2600
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:24,510
Yeah, there is.

2601
02:52:25,630 --> 02:52:27,470
Aww, they're so cute.

2602
02:52:28,070 --> 02:52:28,770
Okay, hold on.

2603
02:52:29,230 --> 02:52:30,850
I'm going to say real quick, I don't know.

2604
02:52:31,010 --> 02:52:34,670
I'm nervous because I don't know yet how close I can get.

2605
02:52:35,030 --> 02:52:35,730
Actually, you know what?

2606
02:52:35,770 --> 02:52:36,850
Let's test it right now.

2607
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:38,250
I'll test it.

2608
02:52:45,460 --> 02:52:46,320
Save always.

2609
02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:47,820
Honestly, it's good to anyway.

2610
02:52:48,860 --> 02:52:50,100
What do you mean to say?

2611
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:00,740
I'm pretty close.

2612
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:03,500
He's like, shoot.

2613
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:04,720
Shoot.

2614
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:09,100
Okay, wow, you can actually get really close, can't you?

2615
02:53:09,380 --> 02:53:11,640
It's getting close to the little system.

2616
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:16,100
Oh, shit.

2617
02:53:50,980 --> 02:53:52,440
I'm gonna corner myself at some point.

2618
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:55,640
Ouch.

2619
02:53:56,740 --> 02:53:57,240
Uh, shoot.

2620
02:53:57,860 --> 02:54:01,760
Oh, my god.

2621
02:54:07,650 --> 02:54:08,330
We got him!

2622
02:54:08,630 --> 02:54:09,130
No, no, come back!

2623
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:17,820
The turret noises in the background are killing me.

2624
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:22,200

2625
02:54:25,290 --> 02:54:39,650

2626
02:54:39,650 --> 02:54:47,590

2627
02:54:50,450 --> 02:54:51,070
Poor guy.

2628
02:54:51,390 --> 02:54:51,930
What do you mean?

2629
02:54:51,990 --> 02:54:52,430
Why?

2630
02:54:52,690 --> 02:54:53,410
Minky no.

2631
02:54:54,650 --> 02:54:55,770
I saved her.

2632
02:54:56,810 --> 02:54:57,230
All right.

2633
02:54:58,650 --> 02:54:58,970
All right.

2634
02:54:59,110 --> 02:54:59,570
Where are we going?

2635
02:54:59,750 --> 02:55:00,190
This way.

2636
02:55:12,430 --> 02:55:17,450
I want that up there.

2637
02:55:18,190 --> 02:55:18,750
Oh, if I had...

2638
02:55:18,750 --> 02:55:19,010
Wait!

2639
02:55:19,990 --> 02:55:23,190
We can swap our telekinesis, right?

2640
02:55:23,450 --> 02:55:25,810
And we can get it.

2641
02:55:26,130 --> 02:55:26,730
Security ball.

2642
02:55:26,970 --> 02:55:29,490
Oh, that's right.

2643
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:31,910
Ah, that's right.

2644
02:55:36,530 --> 02:55:37,110
I mean,

2645
02:55:40,630 --> 02:55:45,350
if I have this, then I don't need the electricity,
technically.

2646
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:50,380
Learning the gene bank.

2647
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:50,800
Yay!

2648
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:56,440
You started that fight with that grenade launcher, and as it
exploded, I can't knock something big over to scare the

2649
02:55:56,440 --> 02:55:57,520
butchings is out of me.

2650
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:04,180
If I...

2651
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:05,980
I think this is temporary though.

2652
02:56:06,120 --> 02:56:06,720
I think so.

2653
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:08,420
Well, anyway.

2654
02:56:08,700 --> 02:56:10,600
For now, we'll switch this out.

2655
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:14,740
I forgot how to use the telekinesis.

2656
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:15,500
Wait.

2657
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:17,380
Oh!

2658
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:19,340
Well, I still got it.

2659
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:22,620
It works.

2660
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:24,660
It works.

2661
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:27,980
I want to try.

2662
02:56:28,060 --> 02:56:30,100
I'll try using the telekinesis for a bit.

2663
02:56:33,460 --> 02:56:33,960
Um...

2664
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:35,320
I'll try.

2665
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:38,180
Re-learning it.

2666
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:43,240
Right now, do I want to buy anything?

2667
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:44,360
I'm deciding.

2668
02:56:45,540 --> 02:56:47,900
How much film?

2669
02:56:48,100 --> 02:56:48,440
11.

2670
02:56:50,540 --> 02:56:50,900
You know what?

2671
02:56:50,900 --> 02:56:52,850
Yeah, let's just buy a first aid kit because why not...

2672
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:57,700
Welcome to the circus of value!

2673
02:56:58,800 --> 02:56:59,960
Use it like a grav gun.

2674
02:57:00,120 --> 02:57:00,520
Yeah!

2675
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:03,320
One more little sister to get in this level?

2676
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:05,080
I thought...

2677
02:57:05,080 --> 02:57:05,940
Where was it?

2678
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:07,760
It was like towards the beginning.

2679
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:11,040
Um, she was...

2680
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:14,860
The one that I didn't get that was by the fishery, I'm
pretty sure.

2681
02:57:15,780 --> 02:57:16,780
You have so much money.

2682
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:17,280
I know!

2683
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:18,700
Fine, I'll get him on one.

2684
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:25,440
I'm a hoarder.

2685
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:26,680
You guys know this by now.

2686
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:34,580
The circus.

2687
02:57:35,060 --> 02:57:36,940
Oh, well, you...

2688
02:57:37,540 --> 02:57:38,660
I'm supposed to go with that.

2689
02:57:45,460 --> 02:57:45,820
Oh.

2690
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:48,940
Oh boy.

2691
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:50,320
Multiple subjects.

2692
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:52,600
Oh,

2693
02:57:58,300 --> 02:57:58,540
out of him!

2694
02:57:58,820 --> 02:57:59,320
Out of!

2695
02:58:12,220 --> 02:58:15,280
You are not friend, you are not friend, you are not friend,
you are not friend, you are not...

2696
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:16,820
When did they set this up?

2697
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,340
Who set this up?

2698
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:20,140
When did this, when did this happen?

2699
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:23,880
Oh!

2700
02:58:25,060 --> 02:58:26,500
I don't think I got it, though.

2701
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:27,360
Oh, I did.

2702
02:58:28,380 --> 02:58:29,500
Hack, hack, hack, hack!

2703
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,320
It happened when it happened.

2704
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:40,280
Oh, I'm hacking.

2705
02:58:41,060 --> 02:58:42,360
Oh, dang it, it was an easy one.

2706
02:58:42,460 --> 02:58:45,640
I'm going to accidentally click that auto hack, I swear.

2707
02:58:46,520 --> 02:58:48,300
And I'll be really sad about it when I do.

2708
02:58:50,520 --> 02:58:52,300
Especially if it's on an easy one.

2709
02:58:53,020 --> 02:58:54,380
Or one that I want to do.

2710
02:58:57,320 --> 02:58:57,820
There we go.

2711
02:59:00,100 --> 02:59:01,440
I love hacking

2712
02:59:06,280 --> 02:59:17,380
Oh the fishes scared me Not the pet bar Oh they took out the
camera Oh I did eat the pet bar I'm so stupid They took out

Okay yeah it was Oops Oh no

would be safe.

2716
02:59:52,750 --> 02:59:58,030
And that if anyone went mad with power, that they would
totally let you out and go home.

2717
02:59:59,010 --> 02:59:59,930
Wife guy.

2718
03:00:02,010 --> 03:00:04,390
Minto merch idea, you could sell pipes.

2719
03:00:04,870 --> 03:00:05,670
What the hell?

2720
03:00:13,660 --> 03:00:14,660
Upper wharf.

2721
03:00:21,220 --> 03:00:22,840
Oh my god, why are we screaming?

2722
03:00:32,810 --> 03:00:33,390
Hello?

2723
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:39,100
Oh, this was not open before.

2724
03:00:48,730 --> 03:00:49,350
My god.

2725
03:00:49,670 --> 03:00:49,850
Wait.

2726
03:00:52,690 --> 03:00:53,690
Where is that?

2727
03:00:58,020 --> 03:00:58,980
Where are you?

2728
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:07,420
Oh my gosh.

2729
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:07,840
Ouch.

2730
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:12,130
Big daddy.

2731
03:01:12,650 --> 03:01:13,210
Big daddy.

2732
03:01:13,710 --> 03:01:14,370
I gotta be careful.

2733
03:01:18,500 --> 03:01:19,880
Don't hit big daddy.

2734
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:26,280
Oh, he's got...

2735
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:31,020
She does have little sister with him, though.

2736
03:01:34,740 --> 03:01:37,280
An anxiety smoker, but instead of smoking, you save.

2737
03:01:37,540 --> 03:01:38,560
Yeah, that sounds about right.

2738
03:01:39,680 --> 03:01:40,720
That sounds accurate.

2739
03:01:42,980 --> 03:01:45,160
How many do I have?

2740
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:47,120
Proximity mine?

2741
03:01:48,300 --> 03:01:50,160
Only one fragment is.

2742
03:01:55,520 --> 03:02:04,100
and five proximity mines get a pick I've gotten a pick of
these two before though I mean I guess I can take another

2743
03:02:13,940 --> 03:02:21,580
yeah see subject already photographed it gives you like
nothing I don't think it's worth it wasting your

2744
03:02:25,960 --> 03:02:27,680
what is this guy shooting?

2745
03:02:28,260 --> 03:02:28,400
No.

2746
03:02:29,060 --> 03:02:29,860
Who is shooting?

2747
03:02:30,860 --> 03:02:34,060
I don't think it's worth wasting film just to get like a
teeny tiny bit.

2748
03:02:34,420 --> 03:02:35,660
I need to go that way though.

2749
03:02:35,820 --> 03:02:36,180
No!

2750
03:02:47,850 --> 03:02:48,450
Oh.

2751
03:02:49,590 --> 03:02:51,810
I was trying to grab this.

2752
03:02:53,330 --> 03:02:53,690
No!

2753
03:02:54,070 --> 03:02:54,910
Okay, I give up.

2754
03:03:04,660 --> 03:03:08,180
He walked by his dead body.

2755
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:13,700
Shoot it to Oh, I guess we could do that too, right?

2756
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:17,680
No.

2757
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:21,940
I'm sorry.

2758
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:24,460
I'm so sorry.

2759
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,640
Please come back, though, so I can actually...

2760
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:27,240
Yes, thank you.

2761
03:03:29,560 --> 03:03:33,440
We did get two little sisters, so I'm honestly okay for
right now.

2762
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:36,280
Wait, this guy doesn't even have one.

2763
03:03:37,220 --> 03:03:37,740
Oh, never mind.

2764
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:38,500
It would have been a...

2765
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:39,900
Well, not a waste, but you know what I mean.

2766
03:03:40,180 --> 03:03:41,000
But the other guy did...

2767
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:41,860
Wait, so that means...

2768
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:42,780
There's another one.

2769
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:43,620
Oh gosh.

2770
03:03:50,710 --> 03:03:51,850
Okay, ah.

2771
03:03:53,450 --> 03:03:55,250
She left, he put her to bed!

2772
03:03:56,310 --> 03:03:58,870
Oh, she went in the hole!

2773
03:04:01,190 --> 03:04:01,990
Um, hold on.

2774
03:04:02,090 --> 03:04:03,430
Yeah, let's do this.

2775
03:04:03,650 --> 03:04:04,870
And do this.

2776
03:04:07,010 --> 03:04:12,190
And I'm going down this way.

2777
03:04:12,950 --> 03:04:15,430
I'm kind of lost, I don't remember exactly where.

2778
03:04:15,450 --> 03:04:16,650
everything is.

2779
03:04:17,610 --> 03:04:18,150
Oh, I remember.

2780
03:04:18,310 --> 03:04:19,590
I could crawl under here.

2781
03:04:20,610 --> 03:04:21,210
Anything new?

2782
03:04:23,910 --> 03:04:24,330
Okay.

2783
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:29,040
Oh, yes, I remember.

2784
03:04:29,360 --> 03:04:29,660
I remember.

2785
03:04:32,140 --> 03:04:34,600
My turrets have been doing such a great job, it seems.

2786
03:04:45,340 --> 03:04:46,380
Female splice.

2787
03:04:55,840 --> 03:04:58,360
Oh, I just noticed this thing.

2788
03:04:58,540 --> 03:04:59,060
Oh my gosh.

2789
03:04:59,580 --> 03:05:06,880
Wrench lure When fighting, though, stronger or faster than
yourself, you'll need every advantage possible in a Scrum.

2790
03:05:07,580 --> 03:05:12,780
Wrench Lurker allows you to make the most of your
opportunities when your antagonist is caught off guard.

2791
03:05:13,380 --> 03:05:13,520
Oh.

2792
03:05:14,600 --> 03:05:16,640
Wait, so it's just like a sneak attack?

2793
03:05:19,240 --> 03:05:19,940
I have wrench.

2794
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:24,420
Oh, quiet your footsteps and increases damage from melee
attacks on unaware opponents.

2795
03:05:25,360 --> 03:05:26,700
Oh, wow, this, okay.

2796
03:05:26,700 --> 03:05:37,400
I have this where you yeah this one is if they damage you
you emit static and this one makes my wrench stronger so

2797
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:43,240
honestly I feel like I could oh no it's stealth

2798
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:55,980
oh let's try it

2799
03:05:59,420 --> 03:06:02,360
Oh my god Oh

2800
03:06:07,570 --> 03:06:12,670
hi I don't even know notice you wait

2801
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:21,600
did I get hurt from that or

2802
03:06:24,700 --> 03:06:28,800
oucha where

2803
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:33,910
is she she's so hard to see

2804
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:50,600
everything is happening all at once oh my god lady can you
die already where

2805
03:07:00,510 --> 03:07:00,790
is she

2806
03:07:06,660 --> 03:07:08,660
I'm just gonna...

2807
03:07:09,800 --> 03:07:10,420
Oh my god!

2808
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:10,760
Ouch!

2809
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:11,140
Ouch!

2810
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:11,320
Ouch!

2811
03:07:15,360 --> 03:07:17,040
She's so beefy.

2812
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:21,120
Ouch!

2813
03:07:25,100 --> 03:07:27,080
Where are you?

2814
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:41,780
Oh my god, please!

2815
03:07:42,860 --> 03:07:43,200
Please!

2816
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:46,900
Oh my god!

2817
03:07:47,260 --> 03:07:49,000
Oh my stinking god!

2818
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:53,020
I don't know who you are!

2819
03:07:53,300 --> 03:07:54,560
Just die already!

2820
03:07:56,420 --> 03:07:57,220
Why is she?

2821
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:03,080
What the bear, please?

2822
03:08:03,720 --> 03:08:04,580
Where is she going?

2823
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:06,280
Oh my god.

2824
03:08:08,320 --> 03:08:10,480
Because I'm afraid of commitment!

2825
03:08:15,670 --> 03:08:16,650
Oh, damn it.

2826
03:08:16,870 --> 03:08:19,110
I didn't think that went through.

2827
03:08:24,060 --> 03:08:25,320
Is that doing damage to her?

2828
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:26,780
I can't tell, to be honest.

2829
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:28,720
Oh my god.

2830
03:08:29,220 --> 03:08:31,140
I'm actually going crazy.

2831
03:08:31,280 --> 03:08:32,640
Why is she not dying?

2832
03:08:37,070 --> 03:08:37,930
It does?

2833
03:08:38,470 --> 03:08:38,470
Okay.

2834
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:42,980
Where is she?

2835
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:46,940
Where did she go?

2836
03:08:50,300 --> 03:08:51,120
Where did she go?

2837
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:53,420
You can't do all that to me and then leave.

2838
03:08:54,540 --> 03:08:54,980
Ma'am?

2839
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:57,200
My crates.

2840
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:15,640
You have found your first reward from Tendenbaum for saving
little sister.

2841
03:09:18,260 --> 03:09:20,680
New Plasmid, hypnotized Big Daddy.

2842
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:22,140
Need a bodyguard in a pinch?

2843
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:28,860
Our new hypnotized Plasmid will fool a Big Daddy into
protecting you as if you were its own little sister!

2844
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:30,760
Minta little sister.

2845
03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:34,340
She already ran to a heal station.

2846
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:37,900
Wait, so I'm not... I wasn't going crazy.

2847
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:39,840
It looked like her health went up.

2848
03:09:41,220 --> 03:09:42,360
No stinking way.

2849
03:09:45,660 --> 03:09:46,620
I'm little sister.

2850
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:49,940
Minto, imoto.

2851
03:09:55,080 --> 03:09:58,000
But for now, we store in the gene bank because there's no
guy here.

2852
03:09:59,100 --> 03:09:59,200
Oh.

2853
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:02,520
I also got something else, but I don't know what.

2854
03:10:03,620 --> 03:10:04,500
Hold on.

2855
03:10:06,240 --> 03:10:06,800
Is she back?

2856
03:10:07,300 --> 03:10:08,140
Please say no.

2857
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:11,320
Dear God, please leave me alone.

2858
03:10:17,220 --> 03:10:27,120
Okay, let's just ignore her for a second we're just gonna
i'm gonna buy another plasmid slot we're gonna ignore her

2859
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:31,380
for like two seconds okay anyway um i

2860
03:10:38,790 --> 03:10:40,910
already know about that one though okay um

2861
03:10:45,990 --> 03:10:57,530
speedy hacker i could get another plasmid slot we have quite
a bit now I could fit in there.

2862
03:11:01,250 --> 03:11:02,130
Fire spreads.

2863
03:11:11,060 --> 03:11:12,020
More slots.

2864
03:11:13,660 --> 03:11:14,520
Armored shell?

2865
03:11:15,380 --> 03:11:19,900
I think, I think, honestly, armored shell is pretty good
to...

2866
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:20,780
Oh, shoot!

2867
03:11:21,800 --> 03:11:24,220
Wait, how can I open up more slots here?

2868
03:11:27,340 --> 03:11:28,400
Oh, dang it.

2869
03:11:28,460 --> 03:11:29,560
I don't even think about it.

2870
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:37,600
Okay, I can't tell if this does much, the static discharge.

2871
03:11:40,220 --> 03:11:41,620
You'll have to buy more later.

2872
03:11:44,400 --> 03:11:45,360
Barry Raiders!

2873
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:47,420
Thanks, Barry!

2874
03:11:47,580 --> 03:11:48,480
Wait, I didn't see it.

2875
03:11:48,500 --> 03:11:49,220
I'm so sorry.

2876
03:11:49,340 --> 03:11:52,520
I think I was getting my butt wiped by that lady.

2877
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:53,480
Oh my gosh.

2878
03:11:54,480 --> 03:11:59,120
You can tell how Minto's done with your boss fight stick as
soon as she pumps the shotgun.

2879
03:12:00,380 --> 03:12:01,640
We got raided!

2880
03:12:02,600 --> 03:12:03,780
I was trying.

2881
03:12:03,980 --> 03:12:05,460
I was fighting for my afterlife.

2882
03:12:06,640 --> 03:12:08,220
Oh, thank you, Barry.

2883
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:10,700
Um.

2884
03:12:13,860 --> 03:12:15,300
Maybe this would be better, though.

2885
03:12:16,200 --> 03:12:16,700
I don't know.

2886
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:19,340
Okay, another plasmid slot.

2887
03:12:19,900 --> 03:12:21,460
And then I'll save up for more later.

2888
03:12:32,470 --> 03:12:35,070
Eva, wait, how long will Big Daddy love me?

2889
03:12:38,450 --> 03:12:41,330
Do you have all the plasmids that let you shoot out bees?

2890
03:12:44,330 --> 03:12:47,830
I don't have a plasmid that lets me shoot bees.

2891
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:51,510
That's a deep question.

2892
03:12:55,850 --> 03:12:57,330
How long will he love me?

2893
03:12:58,170 --> 03:12:59,050
Last a good while?

2894
03:12:59,210 --> 03:13:00,010
Maybe till death.

2895
03:13:01,850 --> 03:13:03,590
Till death do us part.

2896
03:13:05,730 --> 03:13:06,090
Okay.

2897
03:13:07,770 --> 03:13:08,390
Oh, shoot.

2898
03:13:09,050 --> 03:13:09,270
Wait.

2899
03:13:09,870 --> 03:13:10,670
Oh, my God.

2900
03:13:11,090 --> 03:13:11,390
Lady.

2901
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:13,510
Leave me alone!

2902
03:13:15,750 --> 03:13:16,530
You are so annoying!

2903
03:13:17,210 --> 03:13:18,170
You are actually so annoying!

2904
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:19,150
Please!

2905
03:13:20,970 --> 03:13:22,930
Oh my god, that's all it took.

2906
03:13:28,530 --> 03:13:31,410
Oh yeah, she went down real easy, thank you.

2907
03:13:31,990 --> 03:13:34,890
Snap-y, snap-ys.

2908
03:13:35,690 --> 03:13:37,490
Snap-y, snap-ys.

2909
03:13:37,970 --> 03:13:38,570
Okay, hold on.

2910
03:13:38,670 --> 03:13:41,250

lady.

2916
03:14:52,320 --> 03:14:55,640
I had bought so many first aid kits and everything.

2917
03:14:55,860 --> 03:14:58,180
And she wasted them.

2918
03:14:58,580 --> 03:14:59,060
Wasted them.

2919
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:01,280
We're good for that though now.

2920
03:15:05,420 --> 03:15:06,260
Oh wait, I'm stuck.

2921
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:08,780
No, my turret's even gone.

2922
03:15:12,420 --> 03:15:13,280

2925
03:15:43,980 --> 03:15:49,300

without getting more Adam

hand mini boss is probably just hangry true yeah that is a

one more to get.

2929
03:16:22,920 --> 03:16:24,100
That might be a warning.

2930
03:16:24,380 --> 03:16:26,780
It's like, girl, you do not have enough.

2931
03:16:26,920 --> 03:16:28,060
I know it for sure.

2932
03:16:32,970 --> 03:16:33,750
There's something.

2933
03:16:34,290 --> 03:16:35,470
Oh, that's not sparkling.

2934
03:16:35,730 --> 03:16:36,150
It's just...

2935
03:16:41,130 --> 03:16:41,610
Um...

2936
03:16:44,270 --> 03:16:45,270
Well, question.

2937
03:16:45,490 --> 03:16:48,150
Can I hypnotize a big daddy and then...

2938
03:16:50,150 --> 03:16:50,950
the girl?

2939
03:16:52,570 --> 03:16:55,250
Go get Adam, the game subtly hinted.

2940
03:16:55,970 --> 03:16:56,270
No.

2941
03:16:57,850 --> 03:16:58,790
Oh, that's lame.

2942
03:16:59,290 --> 03:17:00,250
She leaves!

2943
03:17:01,070 --> 03:17:02,870
What if I grab her real fast?

2944
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:09,000
I can't tell where this is at.

2945
03:17:09,180 --> 03:17:13,640
This room looks like... I haven't been able to go in there,
I think.

2946
03:17:15,580 --> 03:17:17,860
At least not that I remember.

2947
03:17:23,940 --> 03:17:27,040
I like my pistol too much.

2948
03:17:27,980 --> 03:17:28,700
My revolver.

2949
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:37,800
Oh, I hear him?

2950
03:17:39,580 --> 03:17:39,940
Maybe?

2951
03:17:40,180 --> 03:17:41,100
I don't know where I hear him.

2952
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:42,840
Well, he was up here before, wasn't he?

2953
03:17:51,050 --> 03:17:52,370
Oh yeah, he's in there.

2954
03:17:53,070 --> 03:17:54,050
All right, hold on, let me save.

2955
03:17:55,810 --> 03:17:56,770
Oh, game!

2956
03:17:57,570 --> 03:17:57,850
Game!

2957
03:17:59,110 --> 03:18:00,350
Oh, they are on the map!

2958
03:18:00,410 --> 03:18:00,630
Are they?

2959
03:18:02,710 --> 03:18:03,490
Where am I?

2960
03:18:05,830 --> 03:18:07,090
No, they're not.

2961
03:18:08,670 --> 03:18:10,090
They're not on the map.

2962
03:18:18,140 --> 03:18:19,660
Oh, I should have got him.

2963
03:18:29,890 --> 03:18:30,810
One guide.

2964
03:18:31,030 --> 03:18:31,790
I truly was.

2965
03:18:32,830 --> 03:18:32,970
Wait.

2966
03:18:34,050 --> 03:18:34,890
Okay, that's right.

2967
03:18:34,970 --> 03:18:36,290
I can't hypnotize them.

2968
03:18:38,890 --> 03:18:40,890
Um, this is like such a bad...

2969
03:18:40,890 --> 03:18:42,330
Wait, I wish I could...

2970
03:18:42,330 --> 03:18:42,550
E!

2971
03:18:44,290 --> 03:18:44,810
No!

2972
03:18:47,270 --> 03:18:48,690
I need, I need her!

2973
03:18:50,030 --> 03:18:50,250
Now!

2974
03:18:55,460 --> 03:18:57,080
Oh, this is, like, the worst area!

2975
03:19:01,140 --> 03:19:02,760
I want to try it, though.

2976
03:19:08,440 --> 03:19:09,920
You're mine, now.

2977
03:19:12,720 --> 03:19:13,420
She's like, hello?

2978
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:16,140
She's so confused.

2979
03:19:18,060 --> 03:19:18,700
She's like, hello?

2980
03:19:19,240 --> 03:19:20,700
She doesn't know what to do!

2981
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:21,680
Come back here.

2982
03:19:22,420 --> 03:19:23,600
Oh, this is so lame.

2983
03:19:23,940 --> 03:19:25,660
I guess it would be pretty OP though, wouldn't it?

2984
03:19:28,740 --> 03:19:29,840
It'd be pretty OP.

2985
03:19:33,680 --> 03:19:35,940
Now, if I attack him...

2986
03:19:38,220 --> 03:19:39,220
Does he...

2987
03:19:39,220 --> 03:19:40,720
Where is she going?

2988
03:19:46,060 --> 03:19:46,560
Um...

2989
03:19:55,220 --> 03:19:57,180
He immediately aggro's on me.

2990
03:19:57,180 --> 03:19:58,520
Okay, wait a second then.

2991
03:19:59,840 --> 03:20:01,160
We do need her around, though.

2992
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:01,820
Where did she go?

2993
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:03,920
Hello, little girl.

2994
03:20:05,240 --> 03:20:06,120
Little girl, I'm not...

2995
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:07,180
Wait, was I...

2996
03:20:07,800 --> 03:20:08,640
Oh, there she is.

2997
03:20:10,320 --> 03:20:12,000
She's just wandering around.

2998
03:20:12,780 --> 03:20:13,840
I don't know what to do.

2999
03:20:19,930 --> 03:20:21,410
Wait, is that...

3000
03:20:21,410 --> 03:20:21,970
No way.

3001
03:20:22,090 --> 03:20:23,110
Someone just dropped this.

3002
03:20:23,670 --> 03:20:24,110
Oh my god.

3003
03:20:24,330 --> 03:20:26,330
I hate the way you shake the camera.

3004
03:20:26,950 --> 03:20:27,930
Can we not do that?

3005
03:20:29,210 --> 03:20:29,770
Oh, thank you.

3006
03:20:29,790 --> 03:20:30,090
Thanks.

3007
03:20:31,150 --> 03:20:32,190
Oh my god, please.

3008
03:20:32,370 --> 03:20:33,650
You're gonna give me...

3009
03:20:34,530 --> 03:20:36,750
I'm gonna get motion sickness from you.

3010
03:20:38,590 --> 03:20:41,110
Oh, I think he's back to normal.

3011
03:20:41,470 --> 03:20:42,350
Oh, but she's leaving.

3012
03:20:44,590 --> 03:20:46,630
Oh my god, the worst timing ever.

3013
03:20:47,410 --> 03:20:48,570
Wait, so he doesn't stay...

3014
03:20:48,570 --> 03:20:51,410
Okay, well now we know he doesn't stick around forever.

3015
03:20:54,310 --> 03:20:55,810
No, that is awkward, isn't it?

3016
03:20:59,310 --> 03:20:59,710
...

3017
03:20:59,710 --> 03:20:59,770
...

3018
03:21:03,650 --> 03:21:04,170
Um...

3019
03:21:04,170 --> 03:21:05,270
Well now we know.

3020
03:21:06,030 --> 03:21:07,670
Science experiment complete.

3021
03:21:09,270 --> 03:21:10,790
Yeah, it was pretty long though, it was.

3022
03:21:13,010 --> 03:21:14,470
But we lost her.

3023
03:21:16,050 --> 03:21:17,510
Yeah, I'm gonna reload, you're right.

3024
03:21:19,210 --> 03:21:20,670
Oh, let's see, alright.

3025
03:21:23,350 --> 03:21:24,750
Yeah, it's like two minutes.

3026
03:21:25,730 --> 03:21:26,270
That's good.

3027
03:21:26,570 --> 03:21:27,170
Good to know.

3028
03:21:28,790 --> 03:21:29,190
Hmm.

3029
03:21:29,790 --> 03:21:30,130
Okay.

3030
03:21:34,710 --> 03:21:35,110
Now...

3031
03:21:36,710 --> 03:21:37,650
Oh, come on.

3032
03:21:55,270 --> 03:21:56,330
Get Mr. Bubbles!

3033
03:21:57,730 --> 03:21:58,570
I'm not your...

3034
03:21:58,570 --> 03:22:00,270
Well, I am your enemy, but...

3035
03:22:00,270 --> 03:22:00,530
Alright.

3036
03:22:01,210 --> 03:22:01,770
Alright, hold on.

3037
03:22:01,950 --> 03:22:02,910
Now let me do a new save.

3038
03:22:05,770 --> 03:22:06,630
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3039
03:22:10,040 --> 03:22:12,220
I have four of these.

3040
03:22:13,100 --> 03:22:14,000
One of these.

3041
03:22:14,720 --> 03:22:15,220
Oh, okay.

3042
03:22:15,400 --> 03:22:15,760
He's back there.

3043
03:22:15,780 --> 03:22:17,160
He's back there, perfect.

3044
03:22:18,780 --> 03:22:20,840
Oh my god, there's two of them!

3045
03:22:21,320 --> 03:22:22,220
Wait, what?

3046
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:25,540
Wait, wait, wait.

3047
03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:31,360
There's only supposed to be three little...

3048
03:22:33,960 --> 03:22:38,140
Wait, there's only supposed to be three little sisters, and
I already got two of them.

3049
03:22:39,440 --> 03:22:41,260
Can you get them to fight each other?

3050
03:22:42,120 --> 03:22:42,600
Can they?

3051
03:22:43,180 --> 03:22:43,680
Hypnotized.

3052
03:22:43,960 --> 03:22:44,960
Oh, you're so right.

3053
03:22:46,460 --> 03:22:47,220
Oh, wait, wait.

3054
03:22:55,120 --> 03:22:57,080
And then aggro on this guy, right?

3055
03:22:58,360 --> 03:22:58,660
Uh.

3056
03:23:11,560 --> 03:23:13,140
I'm trying not to shoot the other guy, though.

3057
03:23:15,420 --> 03:23:17,040
It's like a kaiju battle.

3058
03:23:17,480 --> 03:23:17,920
Yeah!

3059
03:23:29,100 --> 03:23:32,020
She looks so scared, it's so sad.

3060
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:33,200
Are they even doing anything?

3061
03:23:38,770 --> 03:23:39,510
Oh, nice!

3062
03:23:39,630 --> 03:23:40,790
They finally hit it!

3063
03:23:47,430 --> 03:23:48,050
Yay!

3064
03:23:50,810 --> 03:23:51,430
Rescue.

3065
03:23:51,990 --> 03:23:52,590
Please, rescue.

3066
03:23:53,310 --> 03:23:53,770
Oh!

3067
03:23:54,810 --> 03:23:55,330
Nice!

3068
03:23:56,890 --> 03:23:58,810
Oh my god, that was so awesome!

3069
03:24:04,580 --> 03:24:05,620
Thank you.

3070
03:24:05,780 --> 03:24:06,300
You're welcome.

3071
03:24:07,480 --> 03:24:08,040
Thanks for the money.

3072
03:24:08,520 --> 03:24:09,180
Thanks for the money.

3073
03:24:10,140 --> 03:24:12,540
And you are, um...

3074
03:24:13,720 --> 03:24:14,240
Well...

3075
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:16,960
I don't know what to do with you now.

3076
03:24:19,260 --> 03:24:20,340
You're free to go?

3077
03:24:21,300 --> 03:24:22,480
The dads are fighting?

3078
03:24:22,980 --> 03:24:23,900
That was so awesome.

3079
03:24:28,560 --> 03:24:34,930

yeah he's he's god

3080
03:24:42,460 --> 03:24:54,180
rosy what happened to our other big daddy i like the other
design more i think we lost uh we lost um oh there it is

3081
03:24:57,940 --> 03:24:59,760
We lost the little sister, though.

3082
03:25:00,500 --> 03:25:01,980
I'm so confused, though.

3083
03:25:02,460 --> 03:25:05,700
Where does it show how many little sisters are on the map or
on the level?

3084
03:25:07,300 --> 03:25:09,300
Because I'm curious what it will say now.

3085
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:13,200
They swap every level-ish.

3086
03:25:13,680 --> 03:25:14,280
Ah, okay.

3087
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:16,740
Bouncer is the iconic Big Daddy.

3088
03:25:16,980 --> 03:25:17,200
Yeah.

3089
03:25:17,980 --> 03:25:18,960
Oh, it's Pausmania.

3090
03:25:20,680 --> 03:25:21,920
That's so funny.

3091
03:25:24,360 --> 03:25:25,560
That's so funny.

3092
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:27,840
I guess maybe it did glitch out when I...

3093
03:25:27,860 --> 03:25:28,320
loaded?

3094
03:25:29,480 --> 03:25:29,480
Somehow?

3095
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:34,640
He doesn't know what to do.

3096
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:36,360
Are you lost?

3097
03:25:40,120 --> 03:25:40,840
Oh, wait.

3098
03:25:40,940 --> 03:25:42,340
I'm just gonna follow him down.

3099
03:25:45,660 --> 03:25:46,320
And try...

3100
03:25:46,320 --> 03:25:52,180
Hope that a little sister does not crawl out of the hole so
that I don't get to Oh, I don't aggro him on an accident.

3101
03:25:55,140 --> 03:25:56,240
I saved so much ammo.

3102
03:25:56,360 --> 03:25:57,780
I really... It was awesome!

3103
03:25:57,860 --> 03:26:03,870
right okay gotta go this i do have to go this way right yeah

3104
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:09,360
following the dairy

3105
03:26:21,890 --> 03:26:24,030
yeah they do move

3106
03:26:27,250 --> 03:26:34,610
making my camera all wobbly though it does give me a little
motion sick i don't think it will give me motion sick if my

3107
03:26:34,610 --> 03:26:44,230
screen wasn't full screen you know I mean he's half health
but I don't feel like we should take him just because we

3108
03:26:44,230 --> 03:27:02,940
don't have he doesn't have a little sister right okay bye
okay the game can't get mad at me now okay the game can't

3109
03:27:02,940 --> 03:27:08,160
get mad at me now they do drop loose That's true.

3110
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:09,740
That is true.

3111
03:27:10,460 --> 03:27:11,720
They do drop loot.

3112
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:14,100
I'm knocking.

3113
03:27:18,120 --> 03:27:20,440
The war rat didn't get himself that.

3114
03:27:20,760 --> 03:27:20,880
Nope.

3115
03:27:20,980 --> 03:27:23,880
You got something from me and my crew?

3116
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:26,580
Or are you just looking to get criticized?

3117
03:27:27,140 --> 03:27:28,740
You set here a spell.

3118
03:27:28,920 --> 03:27:29,460
A spell.

3119
03:27:29,760 --> 03:27:30,960
I need to set on some coffee.

3120
03:27:31,420 --> 03:27:33,380
Maybe puts on silverware in the light.

3121
03:27:33,380 --> 03:27:34,560
I need to talk like Smeagle.

3122
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:38,300
Put on silver wares.

3123
03:27:39,200 --> 03:27:39,800
Precious.

3124
03:27:41,360 --> 03:27:43,680
Before you head into the fisheries, award to the wise.

3125
03:27:44,540 --> 03:27:49,560
All peachy seems about as straight as the dog's heart.

3126
03:27:50,080 --> 03:27:50,480
Okay.

3127
03:27:51,200 --> 03:27:51,340
Oh.

3128
03:27:53,180 --> 03:27:56,860
Nobody walks into my swampy carry ain't a heat.

3129
03:27:57,460 --> 03:27:58,540
Put your weapons in the no more.

3130
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:00,400

The no more.

3132
03:28:03,780 --> 03:28:05,060
Relinquish your weapons.

3133
03:28:11,130 --> 03:28:11,890
That's true.

3134
03:28:14,570 --> 03:28:15,330
Oh boy.

3135
03:28:18,690 --> 03:28:19,450

3138
03:28:22,490 --> 03:28:23,150
Let me grab it.

3139
03:28:26,150 --> 03:28:27,010
Do I already have this one?

3140
03:28:27,050 --> 03:28:28,190
Is that why it won't let me have it?

3141
03:28:29,490 --> 03:28:32,470
Oh, the game is like, hey buddy, you should really...

3142
03:28:35,950 --> 03:28:37,070

Nothing.

3149
03:29:15,310 --> 03:29:16,050
Search.

3150
03:29:16,710 --> 03:29:17,650
I'm searching.

3151
03:29:19,730 --> 03:29:21,150
That's a whole lot of bullets.

3152
03:29:25,110 --> 03:29:25,870
Just water.

3153
03:29:27,290 --> 03:29:28,330
Just water.

3154
03:29:29,990 --> 03:29:31,310

3155
03:29:32,750 --> 03:29:33,250
Nothing.

3156
03:29:34,290 --> 03:29:35,750
Send weapons!

3157
03:29:36,650 --> 03:29:37,290
Ah!

3158
03:29:38,050 --> 03:29:41,470
You now have no weapons except your wrench.

3159
03:29:47,580 --> 03:29:48,980
Automatic hack tool.

3160
03:29:56,350 --> 03:29:57,550
I should have not taken that.

3161
03:29:57,710 --> 03:29:59,010
I don't need it.

3162
03:30:00,470 --> 03:30:02,270
I didn't need it anyway.

3163
03:30:05,870 --> 03:30:08,110
Can I incinerate boxes?

3164
03:30:19,450 --> 03:30:23,350
Now, I bet when the boss waggled out of hell, no.

3165
03:30:23,530 --> 03:30:28,350
I'm told the devil he'd be right back and the devil says,
sure, thank you.

3166
03:30:28,370 --> 03:30:37,890
mr fontaine i'll hold you a spot ryan promised fontaine was

Oh, I healed too preemptively.

3169
03:31:22,580 --> 03:31:23,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3170
03:31:27,890 --> 03:31:29,750
Oh my gosh, they're all over.

3171
03:31:30,610 --> 03:31:31,110
Oh my gosh.

3172
03:31:34,750 --> 03:31:35,310
Ouch!

3173
03:31:35,410 --> 03:31:35,510
Ouch!

3174
03:31:35,730 --> 03:31:35,730
Ouch!

3175
03:31:35,850 --> 03:31:35,850
Ouch!

3176
03:31:40,770 --> 03:31:42,690
Where are other people at?

3177
03:31:43,010 --> 03:31:43,950
I'm trying to run away.

3178
03:31:44,430 --> 03:31:45,730
Oh, this part's scary.

3179
03:31:52,240 --> 03:31:53,680
They're just on fire.

3180
03:31:55,760 --> 03:31:56,880
Alarm activated!

3181
03:32:03,310 --> 03:32:03,910
I'm trying!

3182
03:32:04,030 --> 03:32:05,170
Oh my god, I can't see anything.

3183
03:32:12,870 --> 03:32:14,030
Oh my god.

3184
03:32:14,470 --> 03:32:17,230
Okay, maybe the fire is not the run.

3185
03:32:17,670 --> 03:32:18,650
Okay, that's fine.

3186
03:32:20,030 --> 03:32:20,570
That's okay.

3187
03:32:22,950 --> 03:32:24,550
I mean, it could be the run.

3188
03:32:28,530 --> 03:32:34,070
I'm gonna reload because I lost all my health kits, you
know.

3189
03:32:35,510 --> 03:32:37,210
You gotta shoot, too.

3190
03:32:38,550 --> 03:32:40,070
With what gun?

3191
03:32:41,970 --> 03:32:43,590
What do you mean?

3192
03:32:44,950 --> 03:32:48,630
You gotta shoot or I don't have a gun.

3193
03:32:53,020 --> 03:32:54,240
Oh my god, this is real.

3194

I'll try and remember that.

3198
03:33:34,940 --> 03:33:38,480
I can zap him, and I can set him on fire.

3199
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:44,660
I wish my hand could easily go up to F1.

3200
03:33:45,180 --> 03:33:48,020
And that flurry from Washta.

3201
03:33:48,780 --> 03:33:50,000
It's a little tricky, I feel.

3202
03:33:50,740 --> 03:33:51,500
What triggered the alarm?

3203
03:33:51,560 --> 03:33:52,460
I don't know!

3204
03:33:53,720 --> 03:33:55,800
That, okay, now I know there's an alarm to it.

There's a camera in the L-shaped wall you hid in.

3208
03:34:32,590 --> 03:34:34,110
Ah, I see, I see.

3209
03:34:34,810 --> 03:34:36,430
You could hack them while he talks.

3210
03:34:36,690 --> 03:34:37,270
The cameras?

3211
03:34:39,110 --> 03:34:39,750
Could we?

3212
03:34:41,110 --> 03:34:41,470
Okay.

3213
03:34:44,130 --> 03:34:46,110
Is that that red light that I'm seeing?

3214
03:34:47,350 --> 03:34:47,970
All right, I'm sorry.

3215
03:34:48,070 --> 03:34:48,970
I'm going to say it one more time.

3216
03:34:49,110 --> 03:34:50,430
I don't remember what...

3217
03:34:51,550 --> 03:34:53,510
This one's a tricky fight, but you got this.

3218
03:34:53,650 --> 03:34:54,050
Good luck, boss.

3219
03:34:54,170 --> 03:34:54,730
Thank you.

3220
03:34:54,890 --> 03:34:57,130
It is tricky because there's so many...

3221
03:34:58,050 --> 03:34:59,070
going on!

3222
03:35:00,230 --> 03:35:00,790
F2.

3223
03:35:03,450 --> 03:35:03,670
Oh, wait.

3224
03:35:03,970 --> 03:35:04,370
Not this.

3225
03:35:04,450 --> 03:35:04,770
F1.

3226
03:35:08,330 --> 03:35:08,590
Ha.

3227
03:35:20,870 --> 03:35:21,910
La la la.

3228
03:35:22,790 --> 03:35:24,850
La la la la la la la.

3229
03:35:25,750 --> 03:35:26,310
Wrong one.

3230
03:35:26,790 --> 03:35:27,810
La la la la la.

3231
03:35:28,310 --> 03:35:30,370
I need one more long boy.

3232
03:35:31,170 --> 03:35:31,630
Long boy?

3233
03:35:32,070 --> 03:35:32,530
Long boy.

3234
03:35:33,150 --> 03:35:33,810
Oh, thank you.

3235
03:35:36,930 --> 03:35:37,490
Okay.

3236
03:35:38,730 --> 03:35:41,030
This game is probably easier with controller.

3237
03:35:42,470 --> 03:35:44,290
Wait, I can't tell if you're serious.

3238
03:35:46,630 --> 03:35:47,150
I

3239
03:35:56,680 --> 03:36:01,120
don't know where I am.

3240
03:36:01,760 --> 03:36:02,160
Actually.

3241
03:36:06,780 --> 03:36:08,340
Okay, I am gonna save here, though.

3242
03:36:08,600 --> 03:36:12,880
I don't know if this is a good time to save, but just
because I hacked it.

3243
03:36:13,320 --> 03:36:17,220
Promise Fontaine was dust, and now here you are doing his
dirty...

3244
03:36:17,300 --> 03:36:20,740
I guess that makes Ryan a bomb, and you...

3245
03:36:22,020 --> 03:36:22,440
Me?

3246
03:36:24,320 --> 03:36:24,740
Hello?

3247
03:36:28,030 --> 03:36:28,990
Where is he, anyway?

3248
03:36:36,590 --> 03:36:37,410
Oh my god.

3249
03:36:37,890 --> 03:36:39,250
Well, it would really help to...

3250
03:36:40,130 --> 03:36:40,550
Ah!

3251
03:36:50,030 --> 03:36:50,870
I don't like this.

3252
03:36:50,950 --> 03:36:52,610
I think I'm doing a bad job, guys.

3253
03:36:54,270 --> 03:36:55,610
I can't even pick that up.

3254
03:36:56,330 --> 03:36:57,270
I can pick this one up, though.

3255
03:36:57,990 --> 03:36:58,690
Does this block?

3256
03:36:59,310 --> 03:36:59,590
Ah!

3257
03:37:01,390 --> 03:37:03,390
I think I'm doing a poor job here.

3258
03:37:05,350 --> 03:37:05,970
Oh, oops.

3259
03:37:06,650 --> 03:37:09,150
I did it?

3260
03:37:09,770 --> 03:37:10,150
No.

3261
03:37:12,710 --> 03:37:13,270
Holy shit.

3262
03:37:15,050 --> 03:37:16,310
Oh, thanks Atlas, thank you.

3263
03:37:16,710 --> 03:37:17,530
I don't know, actually.

3264
03:37:18,290 --> 03:37:18,930
Wait, I'm confused.

3265
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:21,050
Wait, I did it, but I didn't.

3266
03:37:23,270 --> 03:37:24,510
I did it, but I didn't.

3267
03:37:25,170 --> 03:37:26,090
The turret killed him?

3268
03:37:27,770 --> 03:37:28,150
Wait.

3269
03:37:34,470 --> 03:37:36,230
I'm actually so confused.

3270
03:37:38,550 --> 03:37:39,690
I've got a run pass.

3271
03:37:44,490 --> 03:37:45,410
I'll take that.

3272
03:37:45,490 --> 03:37:46,310
Thank you very much.

3273
03:37:47,350 --> 03:37:48,250
Wait, no way.

3274
03:37:48,650 --> 03:37:52,970
Oh my gosh.

3275
03:37:53,950 --> 03:37:54,930
You son of a gun.

3276
03:37:55,810 --> 03:37:56,570
Because you are a gun.

3277
03:38:04,110 --> 03:38:05,470
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3278
03:38:08,770 --> 03:38:10,750
Um, oh, spooky number!

3279
03:38:13,610 --> 03:38:16,010
I'm gonna try and get it.

3280
03:38:16,750 --> 03:38:17,890
You killed him with the barrel.

3281
03:38:18,970 --> 03:38:20,350
I'm so confused.

3282
03:38:20,950 --> 03:38:22,810
I'm not mad about it.

3283
03:38:23,050 --> 03:38:24,430
I'm just really confused.

3284
03:38:24,810 --> 03:38:26,210
I thought I was doing so poorly.

3285
03:38:26,790 --> 03:38:27,490
I mean, I was.

3286
03:38:27,770 --> 03:38:31,330
I feel like I was doing so bad.

3287
03:38:34,050 --> 03:38:34,650
Okay.

3288
03:38:37,630 --> 03:38:38,190
Sure!

3289
03:38:38,810 --> 03:38:39,970
Why don't we take those?

3290
03:38:40,110 --> 03:38:41,010
I don't know.

3291
03:38:44,610 --> 03:38:46,090
Alright, whatever.

3292
03:38:52,530 --> 03:38:53,870
You were doing mediocre.

3293
03:38:58,290 --> 03:39:00,410
I'm honestly so confused.

3294
03:39:00,670 --> 03:39:03,050
Okay, it's like right there.

3295
03:39:03,550 --> 03:39:03,730
Shoot.

3296
03:39:03,990 --> 03:39:04,610
Oh, I did get it.

3297
03:39:04,690 --> 03:39:05,250
I did get it.

3298
03:39:05,930 --> 03:39:07,490
Oh, but it's so far away.

3299
03:39:09,330 --> 03:39:09,890
No.

3300
03:39:14,320 --> 03:39:14,740
Can I?

3301
03:39:14,880 --> 03:39:16,500
Oh, I might need to blow it up.

3302
03:39:22,480 --> 03:39:22,760
Hmm.

3303
03:39:23,260 --> 03:39:23,920
I only have one.

3304
03:39:24,160 --> 03:39:25,600
I could go buy some more health packs.

3305
03:39:49,790 --> 03:39:51,110
Oh, I have nothing to blow it up.

3306
03:39:51,250 --> 03:39:51,630
I forgot.

3307
03:39:52,070 --> 03:39:52,310
That's right.

3308
03:39:52,310 --> 03:39:53,630
I was like, wait, where are my weapons?

3309
03:39:56,550 --> 03:39:58,310
Burn it with fire!

3310
03:40:04,830 --> 03:40:06,070
Burn it with fire!

3311
03:40:08,920 --> 03:40:10,520
I don't know if it's working or not.

3312
03:40:11,900 --> 03:40:13,420
I think you can go back and get your stuff.

3313
03:40:13,760 --> 03:40:14,360
Oh, you think I can?

3314
03:40:21,320 --> 03:40:22,800
Are you dead yet?

3315
03:40:27,600 --> 03:40:28,040
Electricity?

3316
03:40:30,420 --> 03:40:30,860
Electricity!

3317
03:40:30,940 --> 03:40:33,320
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3318
03:40:38,020 --> 03:40:38,460
Values.

3319
03:40:40,660 --> 03:40:43,280
Wait, what's my health like, oh yeah, let's purchase a
potato jeeps.

3320
03:40:45,740 --> 03:40:50,500
chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp oh they give you like nothing

3321
03:40:54,650 --> 03:40:57,010

3323
03:41:14,550 --> 03:41:17,710
shots that moves.

3324
03:41:19,050 --> 03:41:22,470
So, do I, um...

3325
03:41:22,470 --> 03:41:24,890
LVs or...

3326
03:41:27,170 --> 03:41:30,390
Oh, some poor sap was laying there.

3327
03:41:46,490 --> 03:41:47,130
Oh

3328
03:41:52,910 --> 03:41:54,990
my god, are you serious right now?

3329
03:41:55,310 --> 03:41:55,850
Ah!

3330
03:42:01,820 --> 03:42:05,000
I didn't need to take a photo of her on fire.

3331
03:42:05,480 --> 03:42:06,660
Mad on fire!

3332
03:42:09,620 --> 03:42:11,160
Imagine setting up shop.

3333
03:42:11,780 --> 03:42:13,160
Girls throwing barrels.

3334
03:42:13,980 --> 03:42:15,500
Yeah, how is this not an A?

3335
03:42:15,960 --> 03:42:17,480
It's an action shot.

3336
03:42:18,020 --> 03:42:18,780
Oh, shoot.

3337
03:42:21,560 --> 03:42:22,120
Oh,

3338
03:42:25,360 --> 03:42:26,940
so these are like opening up doors.

3339
03:42:27,180 --> 03:42:27,880
Okay, very cool.

3340
03:42:29,520 --> 03:42:30,400
I ate a kick.

3341
03:42:30,980 --> 03:42:31,680
I took her.

3342
03:42:32,960 --> 03:42:33,600
Oh, geez.

3343
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:34,680
This is annoying.

3344
03:42:35,180 --> 03:42:35,700
Oh, my God.

3345
03:42:35,820 --> 03:42:42,760
This wouldn't be nearly as annoying if I didn't have this
stupid thing that I can't do anything about, you know?

3346
03:42:43,360 --> 03:42:45,120
It's actually so frustrating.

3347
03:42:46,140 --> 03:42:46,300
Wait.

3348
03:42:46,600 --> 03:42:47,430
Can I barrel it?

3349
03:42:50,980 --> 03:42:51,600
Ah!

3350
03:42:52,840 --> 03:42:53,960
Bad idea!

3351
03:42:54,980 --> 03:42:55,980
Bad idea!

3352
03:43:07,790 --> 03:43:08,790
Oh, gosh.

3353
03:43:09,350 --> 03:43:10,390
It's so annoying.

3354
03:43:14,030 --> 03:43:16,070
It's actually so annoying.

3355
03:43:19,390 --> 03:43:21,150
Oh, that's a body.

3356
03:43:23,370 --> 03:43:24,530
We have nothing on you, though.

3357
03:43:26,750 --> 03:43:33,090
Zap it is temporary, you guys.

3358
03:43:33,670 --> 03:43:35,290
Maybe if I zap it again and...

3359
03:43:37,070 --> 03:43:38,870
And set it on fire again?

3360
03:43:39,770 --> 03:43:40,750
I don't know what to do.

3361
03:43:42,290 --> 03:43:42,810
Ha!

3362
03:43:48,180 --> 03:43:50,180
It's so fast, too.

3363
03:43:50,360 --> 03:43:50,920
How...

3364
03:43:50,920 --> 03:43:51,520
Oh my gosh, please.

3365
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:53,640
Oh my god.

3366
03:44:00,630 --> 03:44:01,790
Oh, so annoying.

3367
03:44:03,650 --> 03:44:05,270
Anyway, just go down the stairs.

3368
03:44:05,410 --> 03:44:06,010
There's stairs?

3369
03:44:09,920 --> 03:44:10,680
Oh,

3370
03:44:15,010 --> 03:44:15,890
my stuff.

3371
03:44:23,150 --> 03:44:24,670
My stuff.

3372
03:44:35,890 --> 03:44:38,010
Can I get him now, though?

3373
03:44:41,090 --> 03:44:42,490
I don't know if I can.

3374
03:44:50,240 --> 03:44:50,900
Uh, search.

3375
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:52,380
Pet boar.

3376
03:44:56,640 --> 03:44:58,340
I'm exploring a little bit.

3377
03:45:01,100 --> 03:45:02,660
I lost my med kits.

3378
03:45:04,120 --> 03:45:05,760
I noticed that I had fewer.

3379
03:45:06,100 --> 03:45:06,940
Wait, where'd they go?

3380
03:45:12,060 --> 03:45:12,700
Okay.

3381
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:15,120
Oh yeah, you're really making me want to open it up.

3382
03:45:18,560 --> 03:45:19,900
Power to the people.

3383
03:45:20,340 --> 03:45:21,640
Fontaine Futuristics.

3384
03:45:22,200 --> 03:45:23,060
Upgrade weapon.

3385
03:45:24,140 --> 03:45:24,940
Wait, what's this mean?

3386
03:45:25,060 --> 03:45:25,700
Wait, hold on, sorry.

3387
03:45:25,880 --> 03:45:28,420
I'm just going to save again because I don't...

3388
03:45:28,420 --> 03:45:30,240
I hate dealing with that stupid turret.

3389
03:45:33,400 --> 03:45:33,680
Oh!

3390
03:45:38,320 --> 03:45:43,800
The auto-generated sharp-shaped charges make you immune to
the damage from your old grenades!

3391
03:45:44,940 --> 03:45:45,160
Oh!

3392
03:45:45,240 --> 03:45:47,800
This machine will be disabled.

3393
03:45:47,940 --> 03:45:49,480
You get one upgrade.

3394
03:45:51,720 --> 03:45:57,080
I feel like damage immunity is pretty big.

3395
03:45:58,420 --> 03:46:01,840
Kickback reduction is also pretty good.

3396
03:46:03,820 --> 03:46:05,680
Pistol clip size.

3397
03:46:06,460 --> 03:46:06,640
No.

3398
03:46:07,580 --> 03:46:08,340
Six shots.

3399
03:46:09,940 --> 03:46:11,940
More than enough to kill anything.

3400
03:46:12,380 --> 03:46:13,100
That moves.

3401
03:46:14,940 --> 03:46:16,180
But Damage up.

3402
03:46:16,960 --> 03:46:18,220
Damage up is pretty cool too.

3403
03:46:18,380 --> 03:46:19,280
Rate of fire.

3404
03:46:22,460 --> 03:46:24,820
Yeah, six shots is more than enough.

3405
03:46:28,400 --> 03:46:28,960
Ew.

3406
03:46:30,700 --> 03:46:33,900
I feel like, honestly, damage immunity is like the biggest.

3407
03:46:35,720 --> 03:46:40,160
Because knowing me, a big daddy would be standing right next
to me.

3408
03:46:40,500 --> 03:46:42,480
And I would pull out my grenade launcher.

3409
03:46:42,900 --> 03:46:44,640
And I'd be like, eat this!

3410
03:46:45,240 --> 03:46:46,440
We both die.

3411
03:46:51,640 --> 03:46:54,640
But I do use my shotgun a lot.

3412
03:46:55,760 --> 03:46:57,960
Gas-assisted firing mechanism increases.

3413
03:47:00,980 --> 03:47:02,940
For you, it's pretty good.

3414
03:47:03,340 --> 03:47:04,520
What's that supposed to mean, huh?

3415
03:47:05,800 --> 03:47:06,780
What's that supposed to mean?

3416
03:47:08,260 --> 03:47:09,420
What's that supposed to mean?

3417
03:47:09,520 --> 03:47:11,120
You're a shotgun baddie.

3418
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:14,220
You can eat shrapnel for breakfast.

3419
03:47:15,340 --> 03:47:17,800
Eat this and you share a meal.

3420
03:47:20,040 --> 03:47:22,440
I've just taken my fork and...

3421
03:47:23,200 --> 03:47:24,900
Right in there, meal.

3422
03:47:26,900 --> 03:47:28,000
Shotgun's always a win.

3423
03:47:28,120 --> 03:47:29,160
Yeah, but which one should I do?

3424
03:47:29,280 --> 03:47:31,040
The damage increase or the rate of fire?

3425
03:47:42,660 --> 03:47:43,180
Damage?

3426
03:47:43,960 --> 03:47:44,260
Okay.

3427
03:47:48,690 --> 03:47:49,270
Look at her.

3428
03:47:49,490 --> 03:47:50,670
She's beautiful.

3429
03:47:56,210 --> 03:47:58,670
You can't take it from me, Ryan.

3430
03:48:00,870 --> 03:48:02,210
Give me one second.

3431
03:48:02,450 --> 03:48:03,850
I think I'm going to go get some more water.

3432
03:48:04,070 --> 03:48:04,910
Actually, no.

3433
03:48:07,990 --> 03:48:09,650
What is my goal?

3434
03:48:10,830 --> 03:48:11,330
Show hint.

3435
03:48:12,170 --> 03:48:13,910
The passage in the hidden...

3436
03:48:13,910 --> 03:48:14,250
Oh.

3437
03:48:18,230 --> 03:48:20,610
So I am supposed to be opening these up.

3438
03:48:22,210 --> 03:48:25,170
I didn't want to tell me where it was, though.

3439
03:48:25,230 --> 03:48:25,590
Just give me...

3440
03:48:25,610 --> 03:48:27,610
A hint is not supposed to...

3441
03:48:28,150 --> 03:48:31,370
A hint is not supposed to be like, By the way, it's in the
basement!

3442
03:48:35,870 --> 03:48:37,450
Go get some water, Minky.

3443
03:48:37,630 --> 03:48:37,930
I will.

3444
03:48:39,630 --> 03:48:41,130
I am... I will.

3445
03:48:43,570 --> 03:48:45,190
I did just save, right?

3446
03:48:45,330 --> 03:48:45,510
Okay.

3447
03:48:48,490 --> 03:48:49,610
I don't think it's this one.

3448
03:48:49,670 --> 03:48:50,330
I think it's this one.

3449
03:48:51,170 --> 03:48:53,870
And if it's not, we're testing our shotgun.

3450
03:49:00,870 --> 03:49:01,910
I wanna...

3451
03:49:01,910 --> 03:49:02,510
Woo!

3452
03:49:05,950 --> 03:49:06,550
Ouch, Ouch!

3453
03:49:07,230 --> 03:49:08,130
Oh my gosh.

3454
03:49:09,330 --> 03:49:09,470
Ouch!

3455
03:49:10,230 --> 03:49:10,470
Hey!

3456
03:49:12,590 --> 03:49:14,170
Why was that so hard for me?

3457
03:49:14,630 --> 03:49:15,230
Holy cow.

3458
03:49:18,630 --> 03:49:19,510
Three shots.

3459
03:49:21,310 --> 03:49:23,090
I don't think you can get away with this?

3460
03:49:23,570 --> 03:49:25,590
I completely forgot that like this exists.

3461
03:49:25,610 --> 03:49:26,050
Right.

3462
03:49:29,190 --> 03:49:29,590
Ouch!

3463
03:49:34,050 --> 03:49:34,450
Yikes.

3464
03:49:38,010 --> 03:49:39,510
I was just yapping in here.

3465
03:49:39,710 --> 03:49:40,350
Wait, is this...

3466
03:49:40,350 --> 03:49:40,770
Oh, no.

3467
03:49:41,070 --> 03:49:42,370
I was picked the wrong one.

3468
03:49:49,950 --> 03:49:51,010
I did pick the wrong one.

3469
03:49:51,610 --> 03:49:54,330
Well, honestly, we can probably just listen to all or go
into all of them.

3470
03:49:56,390 --> 03:50:00,270
He's squeezing us out of 80 points of our cut with the
threat of turning us into Ryan.

3471
03:50:00,910 --> 03:50:09,430
don't play ball son of a bitch sammy g comes and tells me
he's thinking of going to the constable and the next day

3472
03:50:09,430 --> 03:50:16,750
sammy sammy g is found in a sack in a salt pond we had no
choice here we stay on fontaine's crew and we're gonna catch

3473
03:50:16,750 --> 03:50:29,130
the gallows we take a powder and we end up like sammy g not
sammy g everybody calls him sammy g for sammy gone oh no

3474
03:50:32,870 --> 03:50:35,510
Why do they full name him like that?

3475
03:50:37,130 --> 03:50:38,230
Oh my gosh, please.

3476
03:50:40,270 --> 03:50:40,530
Okay.

3477
03:50:42,110 --> 03:50:44,050
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3478
03:50:44,350 --> 03:50:44,590
Yes.

3479
03:50:45,930 --> 03:50:46,430
There we go.

3480
03:50:51,270 --> 03:50:54,610
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, bam.

3481
03:50:57,090 --> 03:51:00,070
Happy 11 months, me, Tom, almost a one-year sick, my top.

3482
03:51:00,310 --> 03:51:00,990
Thank you.

3483
03:51:01,350 --> 03:51:02,050
Thank you so much.

3484
03:51:02,090 --> 03:51:02,850
We're 11 months.

3485
03:51:04,430 --> 03:51:06,390
What did we get?

3486
03:51:10,410 --> 03:51:12,110
We'll take all of that.

3487
03:51:12,570 --> 03:51:13,510
Thank you.

3488
03:51:15,650 --> 03:51:17,610
Okay, well, I guess maybe it's this one.

3489
03:51:31,890 --> 03:51:32,610
Ghost.

3490
03:51:33,770 --> 03:51:34,010
Ghost.

3491
03:51:41,910 --> 03:51:45,830
What kind of operation is Fontaine running here?

3492
03:51:47,070 --> 03:51:49,150
Oh, okay.

3493
03:51:50,370 --> 03:51:50,830
Erm.

3494
03:51:55,370 --> 03:51:56,710
Oh, wrong thing.

3495
03:51:56,890 --> 03:51:58,490
Oh, my god, I wasted it.

3496
03:52:02,930 --> 03:52:04,170
Wasted it for that.

3497
03:52:10,770 --> 03:52:11,230
Music.

3498
03:52:11,830 --> 03:52:12,370
Oh, hello.

3499
03:52:12,810 --> 03:52:13,610
Can I get there, please?

3500
03:52:14,450 --> 03:52:14,650
Wait.

3501
03:52:15,110 --> 03:52:15,310
Hello?

3502
03:52:16,490 --> 03:52:17,710
Do I need to melt more?

3503
03:52:17,930 --> 03:52:18,830
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

3504
03:52:19,630 --> 03:52:20,450
Wait, guys, I'm stuck.

3505
03:52:22,570 --> 03:52:24,590
Okay, I'm not stuck anymore.

3506
03:52:31,970 --> 03:52:35,490
I don't believe that for one second.

3507
03:52:36,610 --> 03:52:40,890
Smooth sailing in my horror game.

3508
03:52:42,190 --> 03:52:42,590
Impossible.

3509
03:52:50,890 --> 03:52:51,350
Yay!

3510
03:52:52,670 --> 03:52:54,270
Smugglers hideout!

3511
03:52:55,410 --> 03:52:56,950
Wait, did we actually make it?

3512
03:52:57,850 --> 03:52:59,310
Wait, is that actually smooth sailing?

3513
03:53:12,770 --> 03:53:17,390
The smuggler has been smuggling potato chips.

3514
03:53:19,290 --> 03:53:20,950
Those dang guys.

3515
03:53:22,530 --> 03:53:23,970
And peppy bars.

3516
03:53:25,710 --> 03:53:25,890
Ah!

3517
03:53:26,290 --> 03:53:26,450
Ah!

3518
03:53:27,050 --> 03:53:27,870
Sorry.

3519
03:53:28,490 --> 03:53:29,530
What the hell is that?

3520
03:53:29,870 --> 03:53:31,630
I got flashbanged by old people.

3521
03:53:40,570 --> 03:53:42,530
Then she just cutscene.

3522
03:53:55,750 --> 03:53:58,550
Well then why don't you get them?

3523
03:53:59,850 --> 03:54:01,930
If they're a hundred yards away.

3524
03:54:04,390 --> 03:54:06,250
I hear a vending machine.

3525
03:54:09,730 --> 03:54:11,850
Why are the smugglers living in water?

3526
03:54:12,350 --> 03:54:13,610
Oh wait, everybody's living in water.

3527
03:54:13,630 --> 03:54:14,210
water.

3528
03:54:15,350 --> 03:54:16,110
My bad.

3529
03:54:17,410 --> 03:54:17,410
Oh!

3530
03:54:25,050 --> 03:54:26,110
The Siggies.

3531
03:54:27,550 --> 03:54:31,770
I shouldn't probably waste uh health right now though.

3532
03:54:33,830 --> 03:54:35,650
Don't we have a vending machine actually though?

3533
03:54:38,390 --> 03:54:40,550
Does this count as like... Ooh!

3534
03:54:45,050 --> 03:54:45,690
Underwear.

3535
03:54:47,910 --> 03:54:48,650
Wait, what was that?

3536
03:54:49,150 --> 03:54:49,310
Oh.

3537
03:54:53,010 --> 03:54:53,410
compromised?

3538
03:54:59,710 --> 03:55:00,890
I think so.

3539
03:55:01,970 --> 03:55:05,690
Well, actually, I think they just don't like me.

3540
03:55:07,930 --> 03:55:09,350
Does that answer your question?

3541
03:55:11,030 --> 03:55:14,490
I was going to ask though, does this count as like a new
area, like a new chapter?

3542
03:55:15,030 --> 03:55:16,810
Because we went through the wharf and everything.

3543
03:55:17,110 --> 03:55:22,070
I don't, I guess this game doesn't super have like, yeah, we
were at Neptune's bounty and now we're in a smuggler's

3544
03:55:22,070 --> 03:55:22,510
hideout.

3545
03:55:22,850 --> 03:55:24,850
So I think I might call it here then.

3546
03:55:24,950 --> 03:55:25,670
And we can continue.

3547
03:55:28,810 --> 03:55:29,990
This is a short one.

3548
03:55:30,090 --> 03:55:30,610
Oh, is it?

3549
03:55:31,310 --> 03:55:32,390
How short are we talking?

3550
03:55:34,950 --> 03:55:36,290
I guess I don't...

3551
03:55:39,700 --> 03:55:41,660
It's an in-between chapter.

3552
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:42,820
Oh, it's really short?

3553
03:55:42,960 --> 03:55:44,020
Okay, we can do it then.

3554
03:55:44,100 --> 03:55:44,740
We can do it then.

3555
03:55:48,280 --> 03:55:52,200
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run, hackin.

3556
03:55:53,820 --> 03:55:55,440
Hacking, hacking, hacking.

3557
03:55:56,000 --> 03:55:57,820
Hacking to the game.

3558
03:56:22,270 --> 03:56:23,190
Vodka.

3559
03:56:30,100 --> 03:56:30,640
No, no.

3560
03:56:31,080 --> 03:56:32,000
Pistol?

3561
03:56:32,560 --> 03:56:33,020
Shotgun?

3562
03:56:33,640 --> 03:56:34,220
Eve?

3563
03:56:36,600 --> 03:56:38,760
Wow, they love chips!

3564
03:56:40,540 --> 03:56:42,880
They're just, wow, they love chips!

3565
03:56:44,340 --> 03:56:46,760
They're just like me, for real, for real!

3566
03:56:47,640 --> 03:56:48,900
I love a potato chip!

3567
03:56:50,180 --> 03:56:50,980
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

3568
03:56:51,180 --> 03:56:52,840
Oh, I didn't mean to drink that.

3569
03:56:53,700 --> 03:56:54,700
That's fine though.

3570
03:56:55,680 --> 03:56:56,540
Peppy bar.

3571
03:56:58,460 --> 03:56:58,760
Mmm.

3572
03:57:00,900 --> 03:57:01,460
Oh.

3573
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:03,440
Meeting with Fontaine.

3574
03:57:04,620 --> 03:57:05,860
We all come down here.

3575
03:57:06,260 --> 03:57:09,260
Figured we all be part of Ryan's great chain.

3576
03:57:09,900 --> 03:57:12,060
Turns out Ryan's chain is made of gold.

3577
03:57:12,480 --> 03:57:15,760
And ours are the sort with the big iron ball around your
ankle.

3578
03:57:15,940 --> 03:57:16,060
Yeah.

3579
03:57:16,240 --> 03:57:18,560
He's up in Fort Frolic banging fashion.

3580
03:57:20,020 --> 03:57:22,820
We're down in this dump yanking guts out of fish.

3581
03:57:23,480 --> 03:57:25,100
Fontaine's promising something better.

3582
03:57:25,500 --> 03:57:27,200
He's like one of us, you know.

3583
03:57:27,440 --> 03:57:29,040
Like he's worked a day in his life.

3584
03:57:29,600 --> 03:57:32,380
He says meet him at his fish packing joint at 11.

3585
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:42,560
guys hey it's not like things could get a lot worse how
could things get worse

3586
03:57:46,120 --> 03:58:01,980
hmm sauna actually where do I go do I go oh I came from over
there just I'm just kidding, I get it.

3587
03:58:07,450 --> 03:58:09,250
Dang, I was making off good.

3588
03:58:10,090 --> 03:58:11,450
Oh no, he dropped his whiskey even.

3589
03:58:14,230 --> 03:58:18,370
Dang, the guy was taking the whole bar with him.

3590
03:58:22,000 --> 03:58:23,140
Oh, find the submarine.

3591
03:58:25,720 --> 03:58:30,420
Is he gonna get mad at me?

3592
03:58:30,520 --> 03:58:32,180
Is he gonna be like, I know who you are?

3593
03:58:35,980 --> 03:58:41,120
If you press that button, you'll learn what it means to
truly be my enemy.

3594
03:58:43,200 --> 03:58:43,600
Randrew!

3595
03:58:44,660 --> 03:58:46,060
I think I already know.

3596
03:58:47,000 --> 03:58:47,380
I don't know.

3597
03:58:47,680 --> 03:58:48,460
Kind of annoying.

3598
03:58:50,120 --> 03:58:51,640
Too bad I don't need these.

3599
03:58:51,780 --> 03:58:52,660
Like, I...

3600
03:58:52,660 --> 03:58:54,040
I wish they were first aid kits.

3601
03:58:57,140 --> 03:58:58,400
I don't know how to balance.

3602
03:58:58,640 --> 03:58:59,480
I don't know how to balance.

3603
03:58:59,960 --> 03:59:00,580
I don't know how to balance.

3604
03:59:00,940 --> 03:59:01,240
I don't know.

3605
03:59:01,460 --> 03:59:02,220
Wait, which way?

3606
03:59:04,860 --> 03:59:06,500
Are we supposed to go this way or this way?

3607
03:59:07,620 --> 03:59:08,440
Through the hole?

3608
03:59:09,560 --> 03:59:10,720
I need gamer paint?

3609
03:59:10,920 --> 03:59:11,180
Please?

3610
03:59:13,020 --> 03:59:13,780
Oh, there we go.

3611
03:59:22,200 --> 03:59:23,160
Ran true.

3612
03:59:23,440 --> 03:59:25,480
I can't call him anything else.

3613
03:59:27,340 --> 03:59:27,920
Oh, wait.

3614
03:59:29,240 --> 03:59:29,540
Yeah!

3615
03:59:54,310 --> 03:59:56,130
Games like, where are you going?

3616
03:59:57,610 --> 03:59:58,890
You stupid ghost.

3617
04:00:00,450 --> 04:00:02,710
This looks like a loop- this looks like a boss area.

3618
04:00:03,370 --> 04:00:04,230
I'm not gonna lie.

3619
04:00:05,190 --> 04:00:05,790
This looks like a boss area.

3620
04:00:05,810 --> 04:00:10,810
boss area oh all

3621
04:00:17,650 --> 04:00:34,370
my stuff got mixed around now because because my look at all
that cash oh yeah someone was a little butterfingers over

3622
04:00:34,370 --> 04:00:55,640
here Frank Fontaine crowd scientist she's damaged goods all
right all right just like all those chumps they scraped out

3623
04:00:55,640 --> 04:01:07,880
of them prison camps oh but she's no crackpot she's gonna
make me the kind of scratch that'll have Ryan look like he's

3624
04:01:07,880 --> 04:01:16,560
running a paper route she just needs some supplies to get
the ball rolling and a Friend to watch her back.

3625
04:01:16,940 --> 04:01:18,360
Friend to watch her back.

3626
04:01:18,680 --> 04:01:21,040
I'm an old gangster type.

3627
04:01:22,500 --> 04:01:24,320
Yeah, I'm the old gangster type.

3628
04:01:24,460 --> 04:01:25,000
Wait, hold on.

3629
04:01:25,360 --> 04:01:28,380
Just because I don't know if I'm doing the order of
operations wrong.

3630
04:01:28,620 --> 04:01:31,720
I saw the lever up there, but I want to go look at this
first.

3631
04:01:38,930 --> 04:01:40,050
Oh, wait.

3632
04:02:05,470 --> 04:02:07,250
What do we tell him?

3633
04:02:14,840 --> 04:02:17,200
It ain't looking so good, Alice.

3634
04:02:20,920 --> 04:02:28,360
You know what movie I watched recently That I hadn't watched
in a really long time Was A Train to Busan Did you guys ever

3635
04:02:28,360 --> 04:02:28,840
watch that?

3636
04:02:28,980 --> 04:02:37,560
I feel like Correct me if I'm wrong Maybe there was another
movie But I feel like it was one of the very first Like

3637
04:02:38,500 --> 04:02:46,500
Korean movies that hit International fame There was a sequel
Was there really?

3638
04:02:47,700 --> 04:02:49,080
This Korean zombie flick right?

3639
04:02:49,540 --> 04:02:51,580
Yeah, yeah, I watched it again recently.

3640
04:02:54,320 --> 04:02:55,580
That and Parasite.

3641
04:02:56,060 --> 04:02:57,780
I think Parasite, for sure.

3642
04:02:59,000 --> 04:03:03,800
But I feel like a lot of people talked about Train to Busan,
right?

3643
04:03:05,300 --> 04:03:05,980
Old boy.

3644
04:03:06,060 --> 04:03:07,960
Oh, Old boy kind of did, but it was more niche.

3645
04:03:08,080 --> 04:03:08,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3646
04:03:09,780 --> 04:03:10,820
Old boy, probably.

3647
04:03:11,480 --> 04:03:12,620
Yeah, that's true.

3648
04:03:12,840 --> 04:03:14,160
Ah, forgot about Old boy.

3649
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:15,680
Yeah, you're right.

3650
04:03:17,100 --> 04:03:20,840
But I think because, like, when Train to Busan, came out, it
was on Netflix.

3651
04:03:21,180 --> 04:03:28,800
And it was like so, it was like when, you know, streaming
Korean movies became more accessible.

3652
04:03:30,240 --> 04:03:30,320
Hmm.

3653
04:03:31,800 --> 04:03:33,980
So, yeah.

3654
04:03:34,360 --> 04:03:36,060
To train, to busa.

3655
04:03:39,980 --> 04:03:43,740
But, oh man, I watched it recently and I was like, oh my
gosh.

3656
04:03:46,260 --> 04:03:54,100
It's so, it's, you know, it's one of those like, like kind
of almost like a doomer zombie movie.

3657
04:03:54,380 --> 04:03:59,520
So if you haven't watched it before, I don't know if you
don't like those kinds of like, oh God, that favorite

3658
04:03:59,520 --> 04:04:00,020
character?

3659
04:04:00,180 --> 04:04:01,280
Yeah, they're dead, you know.

3660
04:04:01,460 --> 04:04:04,880
Like I wouldn't recommend it then if you don't like those
kinds of things.

3661
04:04:05,460 --> 04:04:09,060
But, um, and then I found out recently about another movie.

3662
04:04:09,200 --> 04:04:14,660
Sorry, I don't know why that guy talking about his family
reminded me of, of, because like Train to, oh, Train to

3663
04:04:14,660 --> 04:04:26,400
Busan is all like about, um, the guy's family and stuff and
I will save just because um but I've learned about another

3664
04:04:26,400 --> 04:04:37,080
movie recently that I I don't want to watch it but it's
called Passengers it's with Chris Pratt but basically okay

3665
04:04:37,080 --> 04:04:53,860
but what is so fascinating about this movie it is it is a it
is a love story but the movie is a horror movie like truly

3666
04:04:53,860 --> 04:05:05,240
but they but they that movie is messed up it's really messed
up so i'm gonna spoil it a little bit if you guys don't mind

3667
04:05:05,240 --> 04:05:16,820
um it's kind of so messed up so basically like i said i
didn't watch it i kind of watched like a like a a video

3668
04:05:16,820 --> 04:05:27,360
essay on it kind recently about like if you re-edited the
movie it would change the entire tone of it um but so it's

3669
04:05:27,360 --> 04:05:33,440
about a spaceship that's going someplace i think to like
another colony and it has like it's going to be there in

3670
04:05:33,440 --> 04:05:41,860
like 200 years or something um and like earth earth 200
years or something something of like some you know egregious

3671
04:05:41,860 --> 04:05:44,800
amount of time right that nobody would survive if they

3672
04:05:48,040 --> 04:05:53,560
And Chris Pratt's little sleep pod wakes him up early.

3673
04:05:53,880 --> 04:05:56,900
Wakes him up like 90 years early or something.

3674
04:05:57,220 --> 04:05:59,840
So he's like, he's like, oh, shoot.

3675
04:06:00,600 --> 04:06:01,640
What do I do?

3676
04:06:01,720 --> 04:06:02,640
What do I do?

3677
04:06:03,360 --> 04:06:04,480
And this guy.

3678
04:06:07,100 --> 04:06:09,400
This guy wakes up another lady.

3679
04:06:12,680 --> 04:06:14,200
It doesn't tell her.

3680
04:06:14,240 --> 04:06:15,380
And he's like, oh, no.

3681
04:06:16,540 --> 04:06:17,820
Earpod also.

3682
04:06:17,880 --> 04:06:19,160
woke you up.

3683
04:06:24,260 --> 04:06:26,600
And then eventually she finds out.

3684
04:06:26,760 --> 04:06:27,640
Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence.

3685
04:06:27,900 --> 04:06:28,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3686
04:06:30,880 --> 04:06:34,040
And eventually she finds out and she's like, what the hell,
dude?

3687
04:06:34,160 --> 04:06:36,000
And he's like, my man.

3688
04:06:36,900 --> 04:06:40,440
And then she's like, no, I still love you.

3689
04:06:45,080 --> 04:06:51,280
He literally dooms her to die on the ship with him.

3690
04:06:54,080 --> 04:06:54,560
And...

3691
04:06:54,560 --> 04:06:56,220
I just...

3692
04:06:57,020 --> 04:06:58,500
And it was kind of interesting.

3693
04:06:59,100 --> 04:06:59,180
The...

3694
04:07:00,120 --> 04:07:04,920
The video that I watched about it was basically like...

3695
04:07:04,920 --> 04:07:13,040
So, you know, the movie shows Chris Pratt waking up and him
kind of going about his day and then being like, Me so

3696
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:13,700
lonely!

3697
04:07:14,640 --> 04:07:17,400
And wakes her up and then this and that and the other, you
know?

3698
04:07:19,580 --> 04:07:20,060
But...

3699
04:07:20,060 --> 04:07:29,840
The video describes like if he Instead of Edited the movie
Where Where when the girl Wakes up Right And she's And then

3700
04:07:29,840 --> 04:07:35,480
She also sees Chris Pratt She's like When Jennifer Lawrence
Wakes up She sees Chris Pratt And she's like Why are you

3701
04:07:35,480 --> 04:07:40,360
awake Because nobody else Is awake And he's like I don't
know And then they go around And they see like Kind of

3702
04:07:40,360 --> 04:07:46,720
remnants Of things that Like he had done Throughout the time
That he Like they I think he like Waits a year Or something

3703
04:07:47,600 --> 04:08:01,060
Before he Wakes her up And Yeah it does have Lawrence
Fishburne in it too it does yeah um and uh like there's

3704
04:08:01,060 --> 04:08:09,020
something that happens and Chris Pratt goes to sacrifice
himself and then she saves him and she's like no I do love

3705
04:08:09,020 --> 04:08:17,900
you but it kind of then turns into like a mystery rather
than like a like a mystery kind of creepy like and you see

3706
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:26,500
how creepy he's acting and everything don't want to watch
the movie but i was like so fascinated by it just like how

3707
04:08:26,500 --> 04:08:34,120
how it you know stuff like that where you can like re-edit a
movie changes the entire tone tonal shift of it i don't know

3708
04:08:34,120 --> 04:08:41,280
i'm just so fascinated anyway sorry for my tangent she was
mad for like a little while about how he basically tried to

3709
04:08:41,280 --> 04:08:54,680
murder her he did it's so bad anyway we're hacking this it's
so oh my gosh like I want to watch it but I don't at the

3710
04:08:54,680 --> 04:09:03,100
same time because I'm like obviously now I know how the
movie ends because I spoiled myself I can't I had nobody to

3711
04:09:03,100 --> 04:09:06,520
blame but myself for that but at the same time oh wait

3712
04:09:10,140 --> 04:09:19,080
I wish they had done the other edit okay it's
mid-forgettable movie, I forgot it existed.

3713
04:09:19,220 --> 04:09:27,200
I think had they done the other editing, like the one that
I, where you start where she wakes up instead, I think it

3714
04:09:27,200 --> 04:09:33,900
would have been a little more like exciting and kind of
like, oh, we have to, we see like that, it looks like

3715
04:09:33,900 --> 04:09:38,560
somebody has lived here for a while, but we only just woke
up, what's going on, you know?

3716
04:09:39,720 --> 04:09:44,800
Not a movie, but for a good Korean zombie TV series, I
definitely recommend All of Us Are Dead.

3717
04:09:44,880 --> 04:09:53,560
It's on Netflix too, if you want stuff it's fine oh thank
you garland mode i'll check it out thanks for the pink thank

3718
04:09:53,560 --> 04:10:00,700
you thank you thank you so much thank you thank you
compelling at least yeah okay anyway let's go let out this

3719
04:10:00,700 --> 04:10:07,840
guy's family if they're really in there at all what's

3720
04:10:35,510 --> 04:10:36,110
he doing

3721
04:11:06,910 --> 04:11:07,970
oh no

3722
04:11:23,450 --> 04:11:26,230
She was wearing the cool mask that I was used to.

3723
04:11:29,570 --> 04:11:30,910
Fire spreads, everybody.

3724
04:11:37,830 --> 04:11:37,850
Ouch.

3725
04:11:41,210 --> 04:11:42,470
They don't come from behind, do they?

3726
04:11:42,930 --> 04:11:43,730
I don't think so.

3727
04:11:50,410 --> 04:11:50,810
Oh.

3728
04:11:51,510 --> 04:11:52,290
I think they...

3729
04:11:52,290 --> 04:11:53,810
I don't have, like, a time limit or anything.

3730
04:11:53,830 --> 04:11:55,330
Get out if you can't!

3731
04:11:55,390 --> 04:11:57,130
Get out!

3732
04:11:57,310 --> 04:11:59,050
Wait, why am I getting out now?

3733
04:12:07,590 --> 04:12:07,870
Oh!

3734
04:12:07,870 --> 04:12:08,370
Her mask!

3735
04:12:09,490 --> 04:12:10,790
That was crazy!

3736
04:12:16,120 --> 04:12:17,640
I got her good.

3737
04:12:22,830 --> 04:12:23,230
Oh!

3738
04:12:23,670 --> 04:12:23,870
Oh!

3739
04:12:24,030 --> 04:12:24,170
No!

3740
04:12:27,440 --> 04:12:31,280
You lose in like an assassin, and then you try to sneak out
like a thief.

3741
04:12:31,800 --> 04:12:33,200
But no CIA spook.

3742
04:12:33,480 --> 04:12:34,340
Who are you?

3743
04:12:35,380 --> 04:12:36,840
I don't know.

3744
04:12:36,840 --> 04:12:39,360
There's two ways to deal with the mystery.

3745
04:12:40,380 --> 04:12:43,200
Uncover it or eliminate it.

3746
04:12:46,320 --> 04:12:47,520
Thank you.

3747
04:12:50,720 --> 04:12:52,180
Oh, it's family!

3748
04:12:53,660 --> 04:12:54,220
Get out!

3749
04:12:54,460 --> 04:12:56,380
Get out and get to Arcadia!

3750
04:13:03,170 --> 04:13:03,770
Ripperoni.

3751
04:13:03,870 --> 04:13:04,490
Poor guy.

3752
04:13:05,650 --> 04:13:06,790
He's just been helping us.

3753
04:13:06,870 --> 04:13:07,950
Well, you know, tempting.

3754
04:13:09,090 --> 04:13:10,810
Oh, did I...

3755
04:13:10,810 --> 04:13:11,870
I'm trying to get everything.

3756
04:13:12,310 --> 04:13:15,350
Sorry, I'm looting bodies while you mourn your family.

3757
04:13:15,530 --> 04:13:16,150
Don't mind me.

3758
04:13:18,930 --> 04:13:20,450
Wait, that other spitter lady disappeared.

3759
04:13:20,570 --> 04:13:22,630
Wait, I don't think I got all the bodies up here.

3760
04:13:23,470 --> 04:13:24,490
Rip and pepperoni!

3761
04:13:26,150 --> 04:13:26,910
They died.

3762
04:13:28,350 --> 04:13:30,170
With lots of money in their pockets.

3763
04:13:31,050 --> 04:13:31,250
Aww.

3764
04:13:33,950 --> 04:13:34,910
So sad.

3765
04:13:40,910 --> 04:13:43,190
Yeah, the cremation is taken care of.

3766
04:13:47,600 --> 04:13:48,880
Lutover family.

3767
04:13:50,100 --> 04:13:54,320
Star Wars episode 3 and black and white dubbed in Japanese
with no subtitles.

3768
04:13:55,400 --> 04:13:56,900
I bet it changes the entire feel.

3769
04:13:57,040 --> 04:13:57,620
I believe you.

3770
04:14:00,580 --> 04:14:00,760
Oh.

3771
04:14:01,960 --> 04:14:03,020
Offered a deal.

3772
04:14:04,260 --> 04:14:06,680
The Irish pork pie offered me a deal.

3773
04:14:07,200 --> 04:14:09,760
I flip Infantine and I walk out of here.

3774
04:14:10,200 --> 04:14:10,780
That's simple.

3775
04:14:11,520 --> 04:14:14,900
How do I know that fat fuck isn't Fontaine's guy?

3776
04:14:16,100 --> 04:14:17,520
They're not all Fontaine's guy.

3777
04:14:18,420 --> 04:14:20,860
Fontaine's got Adam, and everybody wants it.

3778
04:14:21,120 --> 04:14:24,360
Brian's got a whole lot of talk and a nice suit.

3779
04:14:25,100 --> 04:14:29,580
Even down here, any idiot can see which way the wind is
blowing.

3780
04:14:40,980 --> 04:14:41,800
To Arcadia.

3781
04:14:43,520 --> 04:14:45,640
It's going to be a gross hour movie.

3782
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:50,100
All right.

3783
04:14:51,980 --> 04:14:53,840
Ooh, Arcadia looks pretty.

3784
04:14:54,860 --> 04:15:03,700
Cool, then we will pick this back up on a Saturday when I
next play.

3785
04:15:07,460 --> 04:15:08,580
Oh, Patrick.

3786
04:15:26,330 --> 04:15:28,070
Yeah, get angry.

3787
04:15:29,490 --> 04:15:31,950
I came to this place to build the impossible.

3788
04:15:32,710 --> 04:15:34,110
Andrew is on the phone too.

3789
04:15:34,250 --> 04:15:35,030
Oh my god, how awkward.

3790
04:15:35,890 --> 04:15:36,690
He was eavesdropping.

3791
04:15:39,950 --> 04:15:43,870
Even the air you breathe is sponged from my account.

3792
04:15:44,290 --> 04:15:45,990
Well, breathe deep.

3793
04:15:47,050 --> 04:15:49,710
So later you might remember the taste.

3794
04:15:52,010 --> 04:15:52,090
Oh!

3795
04:15:52,130 --> 04:15:55,270
You get to the bathysphere in the rolling hills.

3796
04:15:56,510 --> 04:15:58,810
That'll take you straight to the devil himself.

3797
04:15:58,990 --> 04:15:59,390
All right.

3798
04:15:59,830 --> 04:16:04,490
And then all debts will be paid in full.

3799
04:16:04,810 --> 04:16:06,830
Oh yeah, I'm going to give him the one two.

3800
04:16:07,030 --> 04:16:07,570
New goal.

3801
04:16:07,730 --> 04:16:09,150
Go to the metro station.

3802
04:16:09,570 --> 04:16:13,530
All right, we will head to the metro station next time.

3803
04:16:14,950 --> 04:16:19,090
Thank you guys so much for Bioshock today.

3804
04:16:19,990 --> 04:16:24,410
I don't, honestly, I have no idea how far we are in the
game.

3805
04:16:24,730 --> 04:16:25,590
Thanks for this dream, Vicky.

3806
04:16:25,950 --> 04:16:26,890
Hope your head feels better.

3807
04:16:27,070 --> 04:16:27,450
Drink lots of water.

3808
04:16:27,870 --> 04:16:28,210
Thank you.

3809
04:16:28,350 --> 04:16:28,570
Thank you.

3810
04:16:28,730 --> 04:16:29,010
Thank you.

3811
04:16:29,230 --> 04:16:31,810
Also, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3812
04:16:31,850 --> 04:16:32,970
Um, pencil tip.

3813
04:16:33,310 --> 04:16:34,710
Thank you for the super chat, too.

3814
04:16:35,510 --> 04:16:39,550
YouTuber pop culture detective did a whole video on the
abduction as romance trope because of the past.

3815
04:16:39,570 --> 04:16:40,510
No way!

3816
04:16:40,590 --> 04:16:41,990
Wait, I kind of want to watch it now.

3817
04:16:45,920 --> 04:16:47,440
This game's so hectic and loud.

3818
04:16:48,120 --> 04:16:48,900
Was it too loud?

3819
04:16:49,140 --> 04:16:49,840
I'm so sorry.

3820
04:16:51,520 --> 04:16:53,060
If the sound was too loud.

3821
04:16:53,900 --> 04:16:55,860
The passenger's edit would have been way better.

3822
04:16:56,600 --> 04:16:58,700
Wishing you a nice, calm, comfy, quiet, rest of your night.

3823
04:16:58,800 --> 04:16:59,440
Thank you, Dwargo.

3824
04:16:59,700 --> 04:17:00,360
Thank you.

3825
04:17:01,100 --> 04:17:01,740
It wasn't.

3826
04:17:01,740 --> 04:17:02,160
It was fine.

3827
04:17:02,240 --> 04:17:02,640
It wasn't for us.

3828
04:17:02,760 --> 04:17:03,420
Okay, good, good, good.

3829
04:17:03,900 --> 04:17:04,900
Arcadia is the best level.

3830
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:05,800
Can't wait for the next stream.

3831
04:17:06,220 --> 04:17:06,860
Me too, though.

3832
04:17:06,920 --> 04:17:07,340
Me too.

3833
04:17:08,640 --> 04:17:09,400
Thought it would sound good?

3834
04:17:09,520 --> 04:17:09,760
Okay.

3835
04:17:10,220 --> 04:17:10,700

04:17:10,860 --> 04:17:11,080

04:19:14,380 --> 04:19:15,720
I'm so slow.

3857
04:19:16,700 --> 04:19:17,980
Glad you're enjoying the game.

3858
04:19:19,080 --> 04:19:21,500

Thank you.

3863
04:19:27,820 --> 04:19:29,740
You're about one-third of the way through.

3864
04:19:32,600 --> 04:19:33,080
Okay.

3865
04:19:35,660 --> 04:19:37,020
Exploring is cool, though.

3866
04:19:37,920 --> 04:19:39,040
This is how you enjoy games.

3867
04:19:39,280 --> 04:19:41,500
And honestly, yeah, I'm pretty...

3868
04:19:41,520 --> 04:19:47,220
I'm pretty slow with games but I do it's kind of how I enjoy
them too have a good night Mickey thanks for the stream hope

3869
04:19:47,220 --> 04:19:54,700

you thank you taking the pictures took a bit it did it did

3870
04:19:54,700 --> 04:20:00,280
that's true you're at a good pace it's a long game I thought
I would be okay because I think I remember saying seeing

3871
04:20:00,280 --> 04:20:11,900
that it was like a 12 hour average well how I don't remember
well that's okay we won't rush it we won't rush it if i

3872
04:20:11,900 --> 04:20:18,120
don't beat it before japan that's okay it's not ideal
because i don't want to like have to wait such a long time

3873
04:20:18,120 --> 04:20:23,140
in between i'll forget exactly i'll truly forget how to beat
everything so

3874
04:20:26,940 --> 04:20:37,720
but you can do it i'll do my best i'll do my best you got a
good system down after you warmed up again that's true that

3875
04:20:37,720 --> 04:20:42,260
is true saturday i think saturday and then i think i have a
for Tuesday.

3876
04:20:46,760 --> 04:20:50,040
I can probably fit it in twice again too before I leave.

3877
04:20:50,880 --> 04:20:51,240
Or something.

3878
04:20:52,260 --> 04:20:52,660
Probably.

3879
04:20:58,200 --> 04:20:58,760
Okie dokie.

3880
04:21:00,060 --> 04:21:02,580
You're slow because you save every five seconds.

3881
04:21:04,160 --> 04:21:04,700
I know.

3882
04:21:05,260 --> 04:21:06,320
But that's not why I'm slow.

3883
04:21:07,380 --> 04:21:08,700
Saving takes five seconds.

3884
04:21:11,840 --> 04:21:13,040
