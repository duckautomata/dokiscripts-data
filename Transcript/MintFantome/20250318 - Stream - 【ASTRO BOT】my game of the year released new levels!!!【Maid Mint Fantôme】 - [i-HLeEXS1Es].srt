1
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,280
Perfect timing.

2
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,720
I think my settings are strange.

3
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,400
Can you hear me?

4
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,940
Can you hear me?

5
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,460
Null.

6
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,520
Yes.

7
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,020
Bad and clear.

8
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,080
You guys!

9
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,580
I might have done something silly.

10
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,400
Takezo, thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

11
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,920
I might have done something silly.

12
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,920
And I got influenced.

13
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,700
But...

14
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,400
What did you do?

15
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,480
So I saw a video of a person that was like, Look at this tiny monitor.

16
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,420
And I was like, It's so tiny!

17
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,640
It's so cute!

18
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,880
And...

19
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,580
Logan, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

20
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,580
And so I...

21
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,620
Maybe it was just like, I want the tiny monitor, but I have no use for a tiny monitor.

22
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,980
And then I was like, Wait a second.

23
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,140
I could put chat on the tiny monitor.

24
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,560
I could put chat on the tiny monitor.

25
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,240
Belated White Day, thank you so much Brian.

26
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,140
Not unwritten.

27
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,620
And so...

28
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,980
Wait, you guys can't say though that I hate you guys.

29
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,480
Because I literally bought a tiny monitor.

30
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,500
Just to put you guys on the tiny monitor.

31
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,000
So now you have your own little dedicated space.

32
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,280
She trapped us.

33
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:52,940
No!

34
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,160
No, no, no.

35
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,540
You're in a good position.

36
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,900
Oh gosh.

37
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,740
Don't put us on the tiny monitor.

38
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,300
What's wrong with the tiny monitor?

39
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,500
But also...

40
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,580
Astrobot speedrunning community?

41
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,160
No way.

42
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,960
Thank you for the super chat.

43
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,100
One of those digital photo breaks that goes through his profile picture.

44
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
No, so I...

45
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,520
It might take me a second.

46
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,220
I told you guys this because it might take me a second to get used to it.

47
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,200
But right now it's working.

48
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,520
Amazon has free returns.

49
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,520
I like it.

50
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,300
I like the tiny monitor.

51
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,860
But here's another thing.

52
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,600
Here's another thing.

53
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,360
When I travel...

54
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,340
Taking my monitor...

55
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,200
Or taking my laptop plus a whole other monitor is so heavy.

56
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,220
And instead now...

57
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,340
I could take the tiny monitor.

58
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,920
I could take...

59
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,040
What if I got a tiny desktop and then I have a tiny monitor?

60
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,860
How big is it?

61
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,340
It's like...

62
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,720
I don't know.

63
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,260
It's really tiny.

64
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,550
It's...

65
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,350
It's really small.

66
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,130
Hold on, I'll take a photo.

67
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,190
I'll take a photo.

68
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,110
Sorry kids.

69
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,370
Wait, I don't think I would be able to show you right now though.

70
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,510
Because my one monitor is set to Astro Bot.

71
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,290
What did you say your name was?

72
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,370
Astro Bot.

73
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,110
My voice is terrible today.

74
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,710
What's happening?

75
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,430
I have to really heal my voice up though.

76
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,290
I have stuff I need to record soon, you guys.

77
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,110
I'm gonna be taking it easy with my throat for a bit.

78
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,950
Look at this.

79
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,510
I am Astro Bot.

80
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,110
The wish box is kind of cramped, boss.

81
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,970
No, it's not!

82
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,910
And it's...

83
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,670
Okay, I'm gonna...

84
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:20,970
Hold on.

85
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,430
I'm gonna post it to Twitter.

86
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,430
Okay, hold on.

87
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,150
Let me take a photo.

88
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,010
Let me take a photo.

89
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,890
Let me take a photo.

90
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,810
Let me take a photo and I'll post it.

91
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,190
Can I have a mother base happy birthday to relieve some of the existential dread of being 35 and not owning a home.

92
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,050
Except for the tiny monitor.

93
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,730
How do I say your name?

94
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,110
Gus?

95
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,170
Gus.

96
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,290
Gus!

97
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,110
Happy birthday!

98
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,430
Okay, I'll sing you happy birthday then I'll post the photo.

99
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,870
Happy birthday.

100
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,810
Congratulations.

101
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,630
Happy birthday.

102
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,590
Salutation.

103
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,270
Happy birthday.

104
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,490
May your sky stay blue.

105
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,210
Happy birthday, tiny monitor and you.

106
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,670
Happy birthday.

107
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,010
Okay, I'm taking a picture.

108
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,170
I'm gonna wink for the photo.

109
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,370
Okay.

110
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,570
Now I'm gonna put a filter on it so I don't look so ugly.

111
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,790
Say wong!

112
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,990
Yeah, man.

113
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,850
Photo.

114
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,950
Oh, I have to cover this up.

115
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:45,690
Wait.

116
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,570
Hold on, I gotta take another photo.

117
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,830
I have something in there that's incriminating evidence.

118
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,610
One second, I have to take another photo.

119
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,390
Okay.

120
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,770
Everybody say cheese!

121
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,270
Say cheese!

122
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,090
Say cheese!

123
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,290
Say cheese!

124
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,170
You're on the photo.

125
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,750
You're on...

126
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,470
You're on the photo.

127
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,050
Say cheese!

128
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,510
Say cheese!

129
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,930
Cheese!

130
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,410
Cheese!

131
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,150
Okay.

132
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,130
Let's see.

133
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Why did I capture SigmaTub saying help?

134
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,120
You son of a bitch.

135
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,980
It's cute in the tiny monitor.

136
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,780
Please.

137
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,620
Please.

138
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,300
You like it.

139
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,900
You like it.

140
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,600
You like it.

141
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,720
Oh my gosh.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,160
Hold on.

143
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,380
Astro Bot.

144
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,620
Astro Bot.

145
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,120
Okay.

146
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,260
I look...

147
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,380
I'm making a funny face.

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,920
Hold on, I'm gonna put something over me.

149
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,640
I'm gonna do what the Japanese girlies do and put like a little thing over your face to hide your face.

150
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,320
I'm making a silly face.

151
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,860
There we go.

152
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm uploading it to Twitter right now.

153
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,060
You guys can tell me about my tiny monitor.

154
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,950
Right.

155
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,170
Right.

156
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,130
My tiny monitor I use for chat.

157
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,960
Another birthday.

158
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,260
Hold on.

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,260
Congrats on Kojima-san.

160
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,980
Okay.

161
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,260
I'm kind of scared about that.

162
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,440
You guys know that that's not actually Kojima, right?

163
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,840
I actually went back to the post today.

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,700
And I saw how many likes were on it and how many people were like, Yo, Mint, you got Kojima to notice you.

165
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,320
That's not Hideo Kojima.

166
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
There were actually a lot of people.

167
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,500
I couldn't tell.

168
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,780
I couldn't tell.

169
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,940
Okay, I'm posting it now.

170
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,940
I couldn't tell if they could tell or not.

171
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,840
He doesn't even look like him.

172
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,840
No, that is not Hideo Kojima.

173
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,580
Can I get a happy birthday and a quick shout out to my friend Rhyme.

174
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,060
Hey, Rhyme, shout out to you from JK.

175
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,900
It was Kojimbo.

176
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,320
What?

177
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,060
Oh, I'm already seeing issues with my tiny monitor.

178
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,960
I think I might have to rethink this.

179
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,520
I

180
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,100
think I might have to rethink this.

181
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,160
Real Kojima doesn't look like Kojima.

182
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,200
Oh, Jay, happy birthday.

183
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,860
Happy birthday to you.

184
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
Happy birthday to you.

185
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,220
Happy birthday, dear Jay.

186
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,900
Happy birthday to you.

187
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,440
Happy birthday.

188
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,660
Has anyone else's Twitter been really weird?

189
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,580
Like, it takes forever for me to post anything.

190
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,760
It takes, especially like photos, it takes like super duper long.

191
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,360
Thank you.

192
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,560
Thank you.

193
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,860
It's been like that recently.

194
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,600
Nah, stuff isn't loading, it's so bad.

195
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,900
Stupid website.

196
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,440
The tiny monitor will be posted eventually.

197
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,600
Eventually, eventually, eventually.

198
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,740
Eventually.

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,860
Oh yeah, because of the DDoS, whatever.

200
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,920
Just sell the site already, please.

201
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,440
Can we go back to actually it being Twitter?

202
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,560
Twitter?

203
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,790
Anyway, we're not here to talk about that.

204
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,970
We're here to Astro Bot.

205
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,170
We're here to Astro Bot.

206
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,020
It's been a while.

207
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,700
It's been a while since we've seen our little guys, so let's go see how they're doing.

208
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,860
And look, I'm a soup.

209
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,500
Recovering from jet lag.

210
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,960
Drinking melon soda.

211
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,600
Yummy.

212
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,100
Welcome back, Jay.

213
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,760
Thank you for the pink.

214
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,040
I wanted to do something for his... Wait.

215
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,560
My friend is a big fan and is getting married to his fiance.

216
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,560
I wanted to do something for his bachelor party as best man I thought to ask you for a special message.

217
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,300
Does he mind having little screaming Astro Bots in the background?

218
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,860
Does he...

219
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,630
Does he mind if I like...

220
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,230
They're all... They're very noisy.

221
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,090
Maybe he's a big fan and that's a bonus?

222
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,110
Okay.

223
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,610
I hope he's an Astro Bot hater.

224
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,090
No!

225
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,310
No!

226
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,030
It's the kids?

227
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,410
Okay.

228
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,990
Okay.

229
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,490
Yeah.

230
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,170
Alright.

231
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,490
Here's our message for...

232
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,310
For...

233
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,210
For...

234
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,770
Nate!

235
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,270
Hello, Nate.

236
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:09,170
Your friend, JMDelarosa94, told me to send this message to you.

237
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,730
Because you're getting married to Mariah.

238
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,330
But probably not Carrie, right?

239
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,790
I'm confirming with the staff off screen.

240
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,470
Not Mariah Carrie.

241
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,990
I hope you don't mind Astro Bot.

242
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,150
When you guys have kids, then they'll want to play this game.

243
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,590
And look how many of your children there are.

244
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,370
Also, Mariah, hit me up, girl.

245
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,630
Congratulations!

246
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:35,970
Congratulations!

247
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,780
I hope

248
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,610
that worked.

249
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,280
Did you guys see the tiny monitor yet?

250
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,820
It still hasn't uploaded.

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,140
Okay.

252
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,820
Well, we have another galaxy.

253
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,660
Vicious Void.

254
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,800
But...

255
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,380
Before we go there, we must check in on our children.

256
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
Our children.

257
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,140
Happy birthday!

258
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,120
Not the bones.

259
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,260
I don't have those.

260
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,160
Ildaran.

261
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,360
Happy birthday!

262
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,220
Happy birthday to you.

263
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,720
Happy birthday to you.

264
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,580
Happy birthday, dear Ildaran.

265
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,620
Happy birthday to you.

266
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,320
Happy birthday!

267
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,060
Oh my gosh.

268
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,300
Wait.

269
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:45,960
Todokete?

270
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,520
You're two?

271
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,140
One more time!

272
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,560
Happy birthday to you.

273
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,040
Happy birthday to you.

274
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,660
Happy birthday, dear Todokete.

275
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,860
Happy birthday to you.

276
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
Happy birthday.

277
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,600
Thank you for the super chat, Chanchan.

278
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,560
Okay, I'm making sure I didn't miss anything.

279
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,800
I have to scroll up a lot on my tiny monitor.

280
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,340
It was sent!

281
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,620
My tweet was sent!

282
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,700
Do you guys see it?

283
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,220
Do you guys see the tiny... Go to Twitter.

284
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,140
Go to...

285
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,980
At Minto Phantom.

286
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
Do you guys see it?

287
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,000
You can see it next to the mythical block.

288
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
It's so cute though, right?

289
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,020
It's my tiny monitor.

290
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,690
It's not too tiny.

291
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,550
It's not too tiny.

292
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,310
Don't you dare insult him like that.

293
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,250
Don't you dare insult... Oh look, you killed Astro Bot.

294
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,210
He died of your cringe.

295
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,790
Don't insult my tiny monitor.

296
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:32,790
Please.

297
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,470
He can't handle it.

298
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,230
He can't handle this anymore.

299
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,130
It's not your birthday.

300
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,350
Happy not birthday.

301
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,990
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

302
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,070
Just

303
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
killed that person.

304
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,520
Died of cringe.

305
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,580
Let's go say hi to our favorite people right here.

306
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,420
Hello.

307
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,540
Hello Raiden.

308
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,240
Hi Psycho Mantis.

309
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,400
Hi Snake.

310
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,820
Hello Gray Fox.

311
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,900
Hi other Snake.

312
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,140
Thanks for the 15.

313
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,900
Oh, 15.

314
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,820
I thought it said 15.

315
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,480
Oh no, my monitor is not tiny.

316
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,560
I can read it.

317
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,320
I can read it.

318
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,460
The 5 gifted.

319
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,280
Thank you.

320
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,370
I can read it.

321
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,830
I can read it.

322
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,080
I can read it.

323
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,700
It's okay.

324
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,920
Set us free.

325
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,740
You are free.

326
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,620
I give you guys the best place to live.

327
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,980
Why don't you like it?

328
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,320
For once I was like, oh my gosh, they are going to be so happy that they have their own little...

329
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,980
Their own little area.

330
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,520
I thought of them.

331
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,600
I thought of them so much that I...

332
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,800
That I bought a tiny monitor just so I could see them.

333
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
And then everybody is complaining.

334
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,040
I didn't think you would hate it.

335
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,940
This is a prison.

336
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,210
You can't see.

337
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,010
Yes I can.

338
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,810
I read your chat just now.

339
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,210
I can see.

340
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,930
We are birds in a cage.

341
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,350
What if I turn off the tiny monitor?

342
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,830
If you love something, let it go.

343
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,930
And if it loves you back, it will...

344
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,650
If it loves you, it will come back.

345
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,050
Okay, I'm going to do it.

346
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,310
I'm going to turn off the tiny monitor.

347
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,670
Happy St. Paddy's.

348
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,390
All you have to do is wear minto merch and they are always wearing green.

349
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,010
Actually I wonder what would happen if I turned it off.

350
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,090
If my whole resolution would be all messed up.

351
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,630
I'm not going to do it.

352
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,460
The tiny monitor.

353
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,270
Let's go to the vicious void.

354
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,550
Like when you travel.

355
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,530
Yeah, it will be so good when I travel.

356
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,690
Why do these all look so evil?

357
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,010
Cock-a-doodle-do.

358
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,090
Oh my god.

359
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,510
This one looks cute.

360
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,670
Oh nevermind.

361
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,030
I thought they had big ol' thrust or bust.

362
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,860
I think we might have to save that one for last.

363
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,560
Tick-tock shock.

364
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,060
Armored hardcore.

365
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
Wait a second.

366
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,820
Why do these all sound so terrifying?

367
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,740
Hard to bear?

368
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,400
It's literally dinosaurs.

369
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,640
Cowabunga.

370
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,160
I'm trapped here.

371
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
The monitor is so tiny.

372
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,740
Can I also give a shoutout to the speedrunning community?

373
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,600
Hey astrobot speedrunning community, please don't watch this.

374
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,740
Thank you.

375
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,060
Let's try the tick-tock shock.

376
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,500
Let's try it.

377
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,010
Oh my gosh, wait.

378
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,750
This is my thumbnail.

379
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,430
I think.

380
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,590
Oh my god, when do those stop?

381
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,450
Do they?

382
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,410
What the hell?

383
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,730
Oh, this is... I have the time travel.

384
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,930
Wait, I used it though.

385
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,620
Okay, I don't think I can do it in the air.

386
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,650
Hello.

387
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,210
What do I do with you guys?

388
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,330
Okay.

389
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:12,870
Jump.

390
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,530
Why is this so insane?

391
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,230
The music is so crazy.

392
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,650
Okay, hold on.

393
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,110
I can go.

394
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,410
I can go.

395
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,850
I can go.

396
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,310
Now!

397
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,470
Oh my god, I can't go.

398
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,050
Just kidding.

399
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:31,970
I lied.

400
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,090
I lied.

401
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,350
Redo.

402
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:34,710
Redo.

403
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,070
Redo.

404
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,270
I can go.

405
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:37,970
Now!

406
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,920
Okay.

407
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,400
Why is the music so scary?

408
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Okay.

409
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,020
Okay.

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Alright.

411
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,820
Holy moly!

412
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,440
Look how far we have to go.

413
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,300
Okay, we're fine.

414
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,340
This is fine.

415
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,020
This is... This is fine.

416
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,370
Stop freaking out.

417
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,410
Hold on, I gotta text.

418
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:26,470
Yes.

419
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,730
Alright, I'm not stalling.

420
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,810
I'm not stalling or anything.

421
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,370
Oh, what the?

422
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,530
Why didn't it work?

423
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,620
Yeah!

424
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,440
Beat his ass.

425
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay.

426
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,740
Okay.

427
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,600
Okay.

428
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,080
One obstacle.

429
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,420
Over... Over... Dive.

430
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:01,980
Dive.

431
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,200
Alright, this one doesn't look so bad.

432
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,280
Alright.

433
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,800
Do I need the time?

434
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,200
Yes, obviously, but...

435
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,830
There we go.

436
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:21,690
Okay, I got him.

437
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,410
Okay.

438
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,330
First try.

439
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,910
Okay, okay, okay.

440
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,710
Alright.

441
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,290
No checkpoints in sight.

442
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:33,970
I...

443
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,690
Don't think I see any either.

444
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,110
Yeah.

445
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,970
Bellatro.

446
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,170
John Bellatro here.

447
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,390
Wait!

448
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,850
No!

449
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,110
I don't remember how to activate that thing.

450
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,710
Wait, how do I activate the flower?

451
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,450
I don't remember.

452
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,040
Square.

453
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,540
Okay.

454
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,920
That's what I thought.

455
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,580
Dang it.

456
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,700
It's okay.

457
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,760
Okay.

458
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,280
Alright.

459
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
Alright, we got this.

460
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,020
Nice.

461
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,440
Okay, easy.

462
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,820
Easy peasy, everybody.

463
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,540
Easy peasy.

464
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,780
This is quite the warm-up though.

465
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,480
I know!

466
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,600
I haven't played Astro Bot in months.

467
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,680
Okay.

468
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,100
The person up here better be worth it, I swear.

469
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,800
Okay.

470
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,400
Alright, back to where we started.

471
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,380
No worries.

472
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,260
No worries.

473
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,850
I got him.

474
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,390
Okay.

475
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,510
Alright!

476
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,650
What's happening here?

477
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,810
Is anything gonna... It looks like a launch pad, no?

478
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,370
That was pretty clean.

479
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,630
That was pretty clean, huh?

480
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,050
It's a trap.

481
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,650
Nice.

482
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,970
Oh, no!

483
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,980
Oh my god.

484
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,320
I'm trying to decide which way I go.

485
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,780
Why isn't it working?

486
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,620
Oh my god.

487
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,040
Why is my time not working?

488
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,360
Why isn't it working?

489
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,320
One more.

490
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,060
There we go.

491
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,260
I was greedy.

492
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,040
I wasn't double tapping.

493
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,020
You press both at the same...

494
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,800
Oh, wait.

495
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,420
I thought you press L2 and R2.

496
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,900
Okay, it's only one.

497
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,060
It's been a minute.

498
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,600
It's okay.

499
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,720
We're gaming.

500
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,020
We can get back there fast.

501
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,720
Oh my god.

502
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,140
This music might drive me insane.

503
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,770
That was so close.

504
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,030
Okay.

505
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,890
That was so close.

506
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,390
I'm focused.

507
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,090
I'm focused.

508
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,570
You can do this, Minto.

509
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,270
Thank you.

510
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:08,970
I'm focused.

511
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,430
I'm focused.

512
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:09,950
Okay, next.

513
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,110
Okay.

514
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,270
Alright.

515
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,060
Okay.

516
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,600
This part's scary.

517
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,680
This part's a little freaky.

518
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,520
I was right there.

519
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Why didn't the flower go up high enough?

520
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,520
Why?

521
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Okay, stop it.

522
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,640
I

523
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,440
don't think I remember how to use the flower well enough.

524
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,560
That's my issue.

525
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,220
Alright, and shoot!

526
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,880
That was close.

527
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,230
That

528
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,110
was my bad.

529
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,150
Jump before using it.

530
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,190
Like jump.

531
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,290
What am I doing?

532
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:32,850
What am I doing?

533
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,470
Oh, I'm choking.

534
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,920
What am I doing?

535
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,290
I had such a good flow before.

536
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,510
You know what?

537
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,950
It's fine.

538
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:26,670
Okay.

539
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,120
Alright.

540
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,620
What?

541
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,120
Oh, I forgot to freeze time.

542
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,500
I forgot to freeze the time.

543
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,080
I forgot.

544
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,680
I forgot.

545
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,460
Okay.

546
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,300
Alright.

547
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,480
It's okay.

548
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,180
We can get there pretty easily, I'd say.

549
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
Okay.

550
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,240
Okay.

551
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,460
I think if I had a heart, my heart rate would be crazy right now.

552
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,420
I didn't jump in time.

553
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,980
Oh my god, these new levels are crazy!

554
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,640
They were like, oh yeah, you can only play these if you beat the game.

555
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,250
Okay.

556
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,000
Okay.

557
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,460
Okay.

558
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,020
Okay.

559
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,320
Alright.

560
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,870
So close.

561
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,510
Oh, whoops.

562
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,790
That was so close!

563
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,930
That was pretty unlucky.

564
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,430
It's okay.

565
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,370
At least I remembered this time, you know?

566
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,840
Okay.

567
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,320
I like this part because I get a bit of a rest.

568
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,480
I get a bit of a rest before I have to continue.

569
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,500
Okay.

570
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
First try.

571
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,120
I'm so sweaty right now.

572
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,900
Holy moly.

573
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,620
I have to do this every time?

574
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,880
I don't want to know the leaderboard.

575
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,980
I don't want to know.

576
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,540
My PB is...

577
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,160
Don't look.

578
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,340
They don't even give you extra stuff, they're just like...

579
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,580
They're like, you don't get the extra gold or whatever.

580
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,620
Thank you, thank you.

581
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,880
Oh,

582
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,990
sorry, I was reading your thing.

583
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,490
Hey, Hachi.

584
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,510
Let's try it.

585
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,990
Oh, thank you!

586
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,470
I was trying to figure out how to get rid of the...

587
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,770
I forgot about the full screen.

588
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,410
Yeah, thank you.

589
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,930
Yeah, I can breathe.

590
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,070
Oh, you have so much more room for activities.

591
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,710
Mintobot game win.

592
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,890
Okay, let's try the busted one.

593
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,130
Thrust or bust?

594
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,810
You can stretch, yeah.

595
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,730
Oh, okay, this is the doll.

596
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,470
This is the...

597
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,570
Oh, I like this music.

598
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:23,690
This music.

599
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,370
Oh, I don't like these guys though.

600
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,230
Ouch!

601
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,930
I ran right into it.

602
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,840
I don't know why I thought that would work.

603
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,520
Sorry, I don't know why that got me sick again.

604
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,240
Nice.

605
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,270
Who is a good boy?

606
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,270
Is that what they are saying?

607
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,270
What the hell am I supposed to do here?

608
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,730
Can you still top time?

609
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,110
Nope.

610
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,250
That was only that last... Now we have the thrust.

611
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,430
We've got the thrust, boy.

612
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,120
Okay.

613
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,340
Nice!

614
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,340
Okay.

615
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,440
This looks horrible.

616
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,120
This looks so evil.

617
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,940
That was my nickname in high school.

618
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,980
The what?

619
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,560
Wait, what?

620
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,720
Wait, what the heck is that guy over there?

621
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,980
Am I supposed to kill that guy over there?

622
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,520
You see him all the way on that tree branch?

623
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,640
He looks evil.

624
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,320
Okay, sorry.

625
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,840
I am actually stalled.

626
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,380
Oh, the thrust master.

627
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,240
No, it wasn't.

628
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,140
Don't lie.

629
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,940
Don't lie.

630
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,920
The dang... The dang guy got us.

631
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,490
Nice.

632
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:52,790
Okay.

633
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,880
Okay.

634
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
Let's do this again.

635
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,900
Okay.

636
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,060
Alright, back to where we ended off.

637
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,300
The breeze.

638
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,520
How did it go so fast?

639
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:28,760
How do?

640
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,570
It splatted.

641
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,150
Thrust it too hard.

642
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:41,810
Been there?

643
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,090
Really?

644
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:56,430
I heard people say this is the hardest of the new levels.

645
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,670
There we go.

646
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,410
Just take care of that guy.

647
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:07,590
Nice.

648
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,330
Wow, I made it all the way across.

649
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,050
Okay.

650
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,690
How the heck do you do this part here?

651
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,530
I don't think there are checkpoints in this... In these levels.

652
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,490
I think you just... You're just left on your own.

653
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,770
Gotta time it.

654
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,530
A normal jump should work, should it?

655
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,570
Let's try.

656
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,390
Oh my gosh.

657
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:38,990
Oh!

658
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,320
Yes, it fencing.

659
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,560
Okay.

660
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,240
What is that thing over there though?

661
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,610
Ouch.

662
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,570
Dang it.

663
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,990
Okay.

664
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,370
Okay.

665
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,960
Oh, that was close.

666
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,880
Holy moly.

667
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,160
Don't like those purple guys.

668
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,980
Me neither.

669
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,260
They're the worst, right?

670
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,140
Anything that spits.

671
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:44,980
At

672
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,080
least I got the timing on it now though.

673
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,620
Kind of.

674
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,260
A little.

675
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,500
Just a bit.

676
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,760
Sort of.

677
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,820
You know.

678
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,740
Okay.

679
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,700
Alright.

680
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,560
Yeah, no spitting.

681
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,060
Oh no, these guys...

682
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,700
Ouch!

683
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,720
Wait, what?

684
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,440
What happened?

685
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,420
No!

686
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,920
Did I get smacked?

687
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,600
Was that what happened?

688
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,160
I got blocked.

689
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,160
Shoot.

690
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,220
I don't like to get this... I like to take care of that guy.

691
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,040
So that I don't have to think about him going after me.

692
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,620
Ouch!

693
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,350
Taco smacked.

694
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,590
You know, there would be worse ways to go, probably.

695
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,770
There's probably worse ways to go.

696
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,620
Not everyone can say they've been smacked by a taco.

697
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,680
In fact, there are probably a very large amount of people that would love to be smacked by a taco.

698
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,360
It's true.

699
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,920
I'm in.

700
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,600
See?

701
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,580
M.

702
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,940
Jenkins is your man.

703
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,920
Or woman.

704
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,200
Whichever.

705
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,860
It's like, Minto, my name...

706
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,660
What am I getting the timing off on this floor?

707
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,140
It's like, Minto, my name is Man Jenkins.

708
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,400
Sorry.

709
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,820
What do you think the M stands for?

710
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,020
Exactly.

711
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,980
Are we talking backhand or fronthand?

712
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,490
Like, the sucker?

713
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,770
The sucker side?

714
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,150
Or the...

715
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,450
Or the slimy, smooth side?

716
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,290
I forgot the timing for this one.

717
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,410
I think it's when it's, like, in the middle.

718
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:54,550
Yeah.

719
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:55,390
Okay.

720
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,350
Alright.

721
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,620
This song makes me want to do mischievous things.

722
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,680
This song makes me want to act up.

723
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:08,940
Alright.

724
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,840
Get prickled.

725
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,370
Alright.

726
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,190
Unwelcome school vibes!

727
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:43,910
Cats!

728
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,650
Oh my gosh!

729
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:45,170
Yes!

730
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:45,690
9-0!

731
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,130
That's exactly what I was thinking of!

732
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:55,490
If you guys know Unwelcome School from Blue Archive, that soundtrack is exactly what I was thinking too!

733
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,610
Exactly!

734
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,870
Look up Unwelcome School from Blue Archive.

735
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,170
And you'll get the vibes.

736
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,890
It's actually kind of become like a meme song.

737
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,950
In fact, it's really popular on TikTok.

738
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,470
Which is so funny, but it goes...

739
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,170
Like that.

740
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,550
It's kind of like, we are number one.

741
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,990
I know, Kisaki coming to global tomorrow.

742
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,740
I was really...

743
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,720
Risky on that one.

744
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,020
Okay.

745
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,130
Alright.

746
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,610
This one is so hard.

747
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,540
Ouch!

748
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,060
I had it.

749
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,100
I had it.

750
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,900
It was my fault.

751
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,920
It's while driving.

752
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,020
Can you... Do you know what I'm doing?

753
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,680
Should I read out everything that I'm doing for you?

754
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,460
At least you killed that guy on the way out.

755
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,460
So true.

756
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,580
We took care of his rut.

757
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,560
Okay.

758
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,440
I'm not good at timing this one either.

759
00:52:59,340 --> 00:52:59,940
Okay.

760
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,420
Gamer callouts.

761
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,100
Alright, I'm jumping.

762
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,340
I'm jumping.

763
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,540
I'm stalling.

764
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,400
I'm jumping.

765
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,780
I'm not stalling.

766
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,140
I'm...

767
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,680
I'm calculating.

768
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,780
How was the movie?

769
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,840
Beauty and the Beast.

770
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,240
It was okay.

771
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,320
It was okay.

772
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,320
It was okay.

773
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,300
It wasn't great.

774
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,320
I guess it could have been...

775
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,660
Better.

776
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,720
I didn't... Oh, I only hated that fact that they...

777
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,060
I didn't hate it.

778
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,980
I only hated the fact that they...

779
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,880
There was a character in the original.

780
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,460
And she was a sexy maid.

781
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,100
That was in a relationship with...

782
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,100
With...

783
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,460
Lumiere, the candlestick.

784
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,140
But they made her not a maid anymore.

785
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Why would they do that?

786
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,720
Oh wait, sorry, I need to pay attention.

787
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,240
Sorry guys, I'm gaming.

788
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,260
I need to...

789
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,940
Oh my god, did you see him?

790
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,360
I give it a 5 because I'm old.

791
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,020
And I'm nice compared to my younger self.

792
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,340
It would be better.

793
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,460
5 out of 10?

794
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,020
Or 5 out of 5?

795
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:18,140
Okay.

796
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,560
Probably tried to avoid the French maid stereotype.

797
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,740
Maids are not controversial.

798
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,460
They're not.

799
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,480
They're not controversial.

800
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,800
Okay, next.

801
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:58,990
Nice!

802
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:00,630
Okay.

803
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:02,250
Alright.

804
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,750
So then we go...

805
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,170
Okay.

806
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:07,810
Alright.

807
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,670
Alright, okay.

808
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:19,950
Oh shoot, what do I do?

809
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,890
Oh, spin!

810
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,070
Okay, there we go.

811
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:23,490
Nice.

812
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,490
Alright, I remembered, I remembered.

813
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,510
For some reason I thought I needed a power-up for that part.

814
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:34,730
Saved, I know.

815
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:35,370
My goodness.

816
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,360
I don't even see the end in sight.

817
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,560
Where is it?

818
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,780
How much more does it go?

819
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,180
Okay.

820
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,560
Alright, I am stalling a little bit.

821
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:56,560
No!

822
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,830
Oh, thank you for the Hagitsuba!

823
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,150
Wait, hold on.

824
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,990
Now in pause, thank you!

825
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,530
Sharing the love today because...

826
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,270
Sharing the love because today is my birthday!

827
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,470
May I humbly request a happy birthday?

828
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,510
Of course!

829
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:19,410
Happy birthday to you!

830
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,410
Happy birthday to you!

831
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,530
Happy birthday dear Nalentosh!

832
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,270
Happy birthday to you!

833
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,730
Happy birthday!

834
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,810
Alright.

835
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,630
If I...

836
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,830
If I...

837
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,070
Wait, what?

838
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,710
Oh, you have to decide which one you go to.

839
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:49,770
If I make this, I'm going to reward myself with being able to go to the party.

840
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,840
We made it so far!

841
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,130
We made it so far!

842
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,040
This level is hard.

843
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,980
It is!

844
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,180
Miss, miss, miss.

845
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,420
Reward yourself anyway.

846
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,540
I think I will.

847
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,620
I'll be right back.

848
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,140
Sorry guys.

849
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,560
It hasn't even been an hour.

850
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,920
I've been drinking so much tea tonight.

851
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,260
I'll be right back.

852
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,060
I'm so sorry.

853
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,340
I can't believe I'm already having to go to the bathroom.

854
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,260
I'm so sorry.

855
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,200
I'm so sorry.

856
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:58,860
I'm so sorry.

857
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,480
Give me a second.

858
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,200
No way.

859
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,420
What did you say?

860
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,420
Miss, miss, miss.

861
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,960
Oh, that was you?

862
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,440
That was you!

863
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,040
Is that your actual account?

864
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,740
Do you go to other channels?

865
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,320
Or is that like a burner account?

866
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,340
And you're too much of a coward to use your real account to say these things, huh?

867
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,640
You go to other YouTubers and you're just like...

868
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,340
Curse of Ra.

869
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,480
I have seen other please pee on me YouTuber account names.

870
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,100
No.

871
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,200
What's with the gone fishing?

872
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,520
It's because I'm going to the little ghost's room.

873
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,860
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

874
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,980
What is it?

875
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,080
Still fishing?

876
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,500
Not even a little bit.

877
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,840
Mito's still fishing.

878
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,360
Gamer noise.

879
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,080
Okay, I'm going to make some gamer noises so that I...

880
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,120
So that I can concentrate, okay?

881
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:16,660
Okay.

882
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,900
I forgot to make the noises.

883
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,100
I made them in my head.

884
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,700
In my head I was like...

885
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,140
Dusko!

886
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,700
Dusko my wife!

887
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,100
Thank you for the... Stop it.

888
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,280
Also Njico, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

889
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,040
Thank you!

890
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,040
Oh yeah!

891
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,780
Oh yeah!

892
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,440
Oh yeah!

893
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,270
Oh yeah!

894
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,470
Oh yeah!

895
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,570
Why

896
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,790
did you... Their arms are so short!

897
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,380
I went

898
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,010
too soon!

899
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,110
Nevermind.

900
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:03,810
I'm a gamer.

901
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,500
Oh shoot!

902
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,280
What am I thinking?

903
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,220
What was I thinking?

904
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,600
I'm not thinking anymore.

905
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,220
Don't think.

906
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Just do.

907
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,500
Okay Tom Cruise, thank you!

908
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,680
Don't think, just do.

909
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,980
Don't think, just do.

910
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,220
Okay.

911
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,920
Oh my god!

912
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,140
Just jam.

913
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,520
My favorite Top Gun line.

914
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,890
You're so nasty!

915
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:18,250
I will declare my love for you and all my feelings... What are you talking about?

916
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,410
I will say please PM me, Phantom.

917
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,690
I am no coward.

918
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,260
Coward.

919
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,420
Oh my goodness.

920
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,180
Oopsie.

921
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:58,100
I know you guys are just kidding around, which is why, you know...

922
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,400
What the?

923
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,140
What just happened?

924
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,060
It's all in good fun.

925
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:06,660
Shoot.

926
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,000
Oh where am I going?

927
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,220
Oh my god.

928
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,100
Wait, could you like avoid it by walking on the sides?

929
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:16,600
I wonder.

930
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:19,700
I'm

931
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,290
gonna die.

932
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:25,050
There it is.

933
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,090
I knew I didn't time it.

934
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,150
I didn't time it.

935
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,830
That's my fault.

936
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,590
Get yourself together, Miko.

937
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,690
What are you doing?

938
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,530
What are you doing, Miko?

939
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,850
Get yourself together.

940
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,570
This is a game to you.

941
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,640
How did you live that?

942
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,040
I know.

943
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,920
I bought a GameShark.

944
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,280
I'm just gonna... We'll just do that.

945
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:24,480
Alright, once I'm ready...

946
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,780
Please.

947
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,520
Alright, nice.

948
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,420
There's new levels?

949
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,300
There are!

950
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,220
And they're really hard!

951
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,080
They're so difficult!

952
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:58,800
Yes!

953
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,820
Saved!

954
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,080
OK.

955
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,420
Alright, alright, alright.

956
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,580
It's... We were able to do this one.

957
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,800
Aw, man.

958
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,480
Aw, man.

959
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,630
Aw, man.

960
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,400
Aw, man.

961
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,680
This part kills me though, every time.

962
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:02,130
You OK, dog?

963
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:02,910
You OK, dog?

964
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:06,110
I'm not OK, dog.

965
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,530
I'm not OK, dog.

966
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,110
Game Genie was another cheat device.

967
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:20,990
I actually never owned any of those kinds of things.

968
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,430
I might be the truest gamer.

969
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,370
Ruby King, welcome to membership.

970
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,290
Thank you so much.

971
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,230
Thank you.

972
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:34,490
Alright.

973
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:45,130
There we go.

974
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,130
That's the strat.

975
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,090
That's the strat.

976
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:50,770
No cheats, all skill.

977
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,490
OK.

978
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,070
I

979
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,920
didn't even move forward even a little bit!

980
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,900
Oh my gosh!

981
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,020
Are you kidding me?

982
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,440
That was so close.

983
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,260
Holy moly.

984
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,790
Oh my gosh.

985
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:52,910
Too funny.

986
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:00,840
Alright.

987
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,480
Seem to be getting better at that one at least, I suppose.

988
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:14,350
Nice.

989
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,970
Random values that were not in the book.

990
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,050
It injected code into the run time in the game.

991
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:21,850
Freaky effects.

992
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,910
Oh my, how are you gonna do it?

993
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:28,790
Like that?

994
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:38,490
OK.

995
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:42,630
Alright.

996
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:45,770
I'm scared.

997
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,530
I'm too scared.

998
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:47,770
No, I can't do it.

999
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,570
I'm too scared.

1000
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,350
I'm too scared!

1001
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,460
Wow!

1002
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,800
Maybe I am a gamer!

1003
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:37,960
Do I bust into him or... I don't think so.

1004
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,980
I think I have to go to the next... the other side maybe.

1005
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,580
Oh my god.

1006
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:56,030
You know you do the...

1007
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,050
What is this?

1008
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:58,890
Burst.

1009
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,290
Wait.

1010
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,030
No, it's bust.

1011
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:04,770
It's... Is this level called thrust or bust?

1012
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,270
Holy moly.

1013
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,210
I think I don't like these levels!

1014
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,670
Astrobot, you were supposed to be my game of the year.

1015
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,890
I thought you... I thought you... I thought you would be kind to me.

1016
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,410
Can I have you on my next Yutasha?

1017
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,350
Oh my gosh, I would be honored!

1018
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,810
Oh, please!

1019
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,690
Astrobot, you sweet, sweet... He used his arms!

1020
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,450
Did you see that?

1021
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,790
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

1022
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:51,430
Thank you!

1023
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,190
Oh my gosh, he used his arms!

1024
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,830
Wait, so I have to go back and forth?

1025
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,610
That seems impossible, I'm not gonna lie.

1026
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,190
Because they're gonna keep spawning, no?

1027
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:19,970
Oh shoot.

1028
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:20,770
There we go.

1029
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:21,230
I got him.

1030
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:31,970
I don't think I... I don't think I... I don't think I...

1031
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,970
Thrust into him, because...

1032
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:37,750
Then...

1033
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,930
With all the other spikes I die, it wouldn't be any different with him.

1034
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:42,730
I think I have to switch sides.

1035
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:44,430
No way, this is impossible.

1036
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,370
This is so impossible!

1037
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,530
This is impossible!

1038
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,850
Is that the ending over there?

1039
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:55,610
Oh, I see him!

1040
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,230
I see the little robot guy!

1041
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:05,910
Come on, get my bearings.

1042
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,660
It wasn't impossible!

1043
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:20,000
Oh my gosh!

1044
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,640
It wasn't impossible, I did it!

1045
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,980
Holy moly!

1046
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,440
Holy moly cannoli!

1047
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,860
It was way easier than I thought it would be, actually.

1048
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,800
Okay, so his thing does reach...

1049
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,060
That other side.

1050
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,680
Wait, why are they both awake now?

1051
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,980
Oh my gosh, both of them reach?

1052
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,580
No... And then that thing also flips?

1053
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,720
No, this is so evil.

1054
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,460
No, this is so evil.

1055
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,900
I don't know.

1056
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:15,680
Hold on.

1057
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,140
I'm trying to catch my bearings.

1058
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,940
Maybe I make him fall asleep again and I go fast.

1059
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,640
Don't overthink it.

1060
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,660
I'm scared, that's all.

1061
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,300
I'm scared.

1062
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,080
I feel like it would be better to be on this side, no?

1063
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,340
On that side?

1064
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Alright, here we go.

1065
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,660
I do feel like the other side is a little closer.

1066
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,580
I feel like it too, unless it's in the middle and it's just...

1067
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,480
No, it's definitely towards the right side.

1068
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,780
They wouldn't do that though, where you have to go on...

1069
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,780
They wouldn't put the platform over here if you couldn't make it, right?

1070
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,380
They wouldn't put the platform here if you couldn't make it.

1071
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,980
Please turn, astrobot.

1072
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:21,820
There we go.

1073
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,140
Nice save, nice save.

1074
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,020
Oh my god, the big guy too even!

1075
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,920
Oh my gosh, no, no.

1076
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:38,680
Hold on.

1077
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:39,880
I'm trying to get timing.

1078
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,080
Okay, next one.

1079
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:43,600
I'll go.

1080
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,020
Are you kidding me?

1081
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:49,580
Please!

1082
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,480
That was so cruel!

1083
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,320
Are you kidding me?

1084
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,690
That was so cruel!

1085
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:12,130
Oh gosh!

1086
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,430
There

1087
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,140
we go, I got him.

1088
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:25,360
Oh

1089
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,980
gosh!

1090
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:46,990
Okay.

1091
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,270
Okay.

1092
01:18:59,360 --> 01:18:59,980
Okay.

1093
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:08,080
I think speedrunning this level would stress me the hell out!

1094
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:10,900
Like, no!

1095
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,960
It would stress me out way too much!

1096
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:15,780
What outfit?

1097
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,640
Oh, it's Ghost of Tsushima, right?

1098
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,160
I picked it because of Ghost.

1099
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:34,310
Alright, let's not mess this up.

1100
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,330
Wait, timing.

1101
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,470
There we go.

1102
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,410
Let's go to a different planet.

1103
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:38,450
Let's go to a different planet.

1104
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:43,210
We can just do a little taste test of each one, right?

1105
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:48,850
I said I would save that one for last anyway.

1106
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:51,390
I broke my own rule.

1107
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:54,350
Oh, okay.

1108
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:55,750
I'm this guy.

1109
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,850
I don't mind this one because...

1110
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:04,410
It makes it so I can be a little invincible.

1111
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:05,390
Oh wait.

1112
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:09,010
I become a little invincible guy like this.

1113
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:13,850
I just have to roll.

1114
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:15,370
What the?

1115
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:17,450
Oh, that guy died on top of me.

1116
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:19,550
Stupid.

1117
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:23,330
Can you imagine if these were like tilt controls?

1118
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,250
That would be so crazy.

1119
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:26,090
Hey!

1120
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:26,630
Hey!

1121
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:27,310
Hey!

1122
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:40,350
Stupid rabbit.

1123
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:41,930
Alright, there we go.

1124
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,390
There we go.

1125
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,730
I'm using tilt controls.

1126
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:50,910
This guy is so stupid.

1127
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:57,930
Oh my god, that falls.

1128
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:12,320
I don't know if that's the intended...

1129
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,200
That's intended for me now.

1130
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,090
That's so evil.

1131
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,850
Why would you make me jump up there?

1132
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:27,890
I guess it doesn't make you jump up.

1133
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,510
I did it.

1134
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:29,710
I did it all on my own.

1135
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:31,890
Not even thinking about it.

1136
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,360
Oh, I got it.

1137
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:36,520
Okay.

1138
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,690
He just does it all on his own.

1139
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,520
That's so silly.

1140
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,260
That's so... It's too silly.

1141
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:10,500
Okay.

1142
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:16,910
Oh gosh, what am I doing?

1143
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:17,930
Why am I like this?

1144
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:20,250
Oh, I have to jump in the middle?

1145
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,190
Okay.

1146
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:32,270
I thought I was gonna rest my throat, you guys.

1147
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:34,630
Maybe I picked the wrong game.

1148
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:38,890
Here I thought we were gonna have some relaxing, fun astrobot levels.

1149
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:43,070
I didn't know that they literally created hell in a game.

1150
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,020
I saw under the water.

1151
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:50,980
Did you guys see that?

1152
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,180
Oh, I just noticed we're in Egypt.

1153
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,380
Like I said, hell.

1154
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,360
Just kidding.

1155
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,080
Okay.

1156
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,260
Literally gone pushing.

1157
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:20,740
Do your worst, little guy.

1158
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,040
He's like, I am.

1159
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:34,700
Anyway.

1160
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:43,470
There's no going back.

1161
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:45,690
There's no going back.

1162
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,450
Even before this update, is astrobot really that relaxing?

1163
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,110
I think so.

1164
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:53,670
Wait, this one isn't even that long.

1165
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,490
He's right there.

1166
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,660
Wait, this one's not even that long.

1167
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,060
He's right there.

1168
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:08,820
Okay.

1169
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,320
Alright.

1170
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,540
Oh my god, oh my god.

1171
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,600
I'm such a stupid head.

1172
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,300
Sorry.

1173
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,520
Things are in motion and I shouldn't be greedy.

1174
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,340
I shouldn't be greedy.

1175
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,280
Are you guys feeling relaxed right now, for real?

1176
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,740
Oh, why did I do that?

1177
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,840
You guys are feeling relaxed?

1178
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,760
Like, calm you with my soothing voice.

1179
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,180
Will that make you feel even more relaxed?

1180
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,860
Very chill, yeah?

1181
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,420
He turns around and walks away.

1182
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,820
So silly.

1183
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,260
I'm gonna be good.

1184
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,120
I'm not gonna scream.

1185
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,620
If I scream, I'll go...

1186
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,780
I'll go...

1187
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,960
You got any grapes?

1188
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,040
Oh my gosh, wait, I do actually have grapes.

1189
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,020
Silent screaming.

1190
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,010
Like that.

1191
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,950
Scream in lowercase.

1192
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,370
Very soothing after a workday.

1193
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:49,890
That's good.

1194
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:51,930
That's good.

1195
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,850
Okay.

1196
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,530
Gosh, this part is so tricky.

1197
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:06,210
Wait, what?

1198
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:08,510
But I was a ball.

1199
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:11,570
I was a ball.

1200
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:14,470
I was a ball.

1201
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,420
Oh my goodness.

1202
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,080
Thank goodness.

1203
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,680
Every time.

1204
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:39,900
It's me every time.

1205
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,640
Alright, I just have to get through this part.

1206
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,740
And then there's a spikey and there's a bunny.

1207
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,780
There's a couple guys I gotta take care of.

1208
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,220
I gotta take care of some guys, okay?

1209
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,620
Just gotta take care of some guys.

1210
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,880
I like how this part seems fine and they're like, oh, this part's too easy.

1211
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,200
Turn on the fire.

1212
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:20,720
Oh, you thought this part would be a breeze?

1213
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,080
Maybe speed is the key here?

1214
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,700
Oh, I think so for sure.

1215
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:34,190
It's just...

1216
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:35,010
Ah, see?

1217
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:38,090
I don't know how this part works.

1218
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:41,730
I jump but I don't get enough air to...

1219
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,420
Maybe like that.

1220
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:51,220
What am I doing?

1221
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,420
Oh my gosh, okay.

1222
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,660
Jump a bit earlier.

1223
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:58,780
Okay.

1224
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,960
Oh, uh oh.

1225
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,000
I stopped paying attention.

1226
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,720
Uh oh.

1227
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,340
That's no good.

1228
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,660
Oh, he's going all the way back.

1229
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,400
Oh, he's going back into position.

1230
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,360
Oh, I waited way too long.

1231
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,120
Sorry, I was reading chat.

1232
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,340
He has nowhere to go.

1233
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,520
Okay, we're fine.

1234
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,560
Yeah!

1235
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:48,780
Alright.

1236
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,220
So, how soon are we talking?

1237
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:00,920
Right

1238
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,660
when you hit the side.

1239
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,460
Like all the way here?

1240
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,340
Oh, I think I see it.

1241
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,560
Maybe I get it.

1242
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,500
Okay.

1243
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:24,620
Come on.

1244
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:30,860
I made it!

1245
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,760
I made it!

1246
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,560
I didn't think that guy would be able to reach me from all the way over there.

1247
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:55,900
I didn't think he would reach me from all the way over there.

1248
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,280
So cruel.

1249
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:06,810
At least this level is not very long.

1250
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:11,970
I was only concerned about a bunny and...

1251
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,610
Alright, once I hit the edge.

1252
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,230
Okay, on the other side.

1253
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,830
I went too soon.

1254
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:47,850
I went too soon.

1255
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:57,570
It's okay.

1256
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,370
It's easy getting back there.

1257
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:00,850
It's easy getting back there.

1258
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,090
Oh, just kidding.

1259
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:06,150
You get the idea though.

1260
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,290
Yeah, I get the idea.

1261
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:30,510
I wasn't even... I don't even think you could actually die at that part.

1262
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:32,130
The part that I just died to.

1263
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:35,690
That was greedy.

1264
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,410
I'm afraid...

1265
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:55,950
I will take some medicine.

1266
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:58,590
I might have to cut today's stream short though.

1267
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,230
I don't think it's the game's fault.

1268
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:04,330
I'm starting to get a migraine.

1269
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:05,370
I don't know why.

1270
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,810
Usually my migraines are triggered by something, but...

1271
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,320
I don't know.

1272
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,020
The stress.

1273
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,100
Did I drink enough water?

1274
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,200
I've been drinking water.

1275
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,060
I'll go until I can go no more.

1276
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,000
I had a stubborn headache all day.

1277
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,840
You know what it might be?

1278
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,420
Oh my gosh, I went outside.

1279
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,900
I went outside today and everything's in bloom.

1280
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,100
I think it actually might be pollen.

1281
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:52,740
I think that's it.

1282
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,660
Because I was like, why do I feel so icky?

1283
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:57,300
Oh my goodness.

1284
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:58,900
That'll do it.

1285
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,260
Don't go outside.

1286
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,120
Not even once.

1287
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,900
Not even once.

1288
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,480
Minto touched grass.

1289
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,560
Yeah, I had some things I had to do for my new car.

1290
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:20,000
This is why I like the tiny monitor.

1291
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,120
Outside is scary.

1292
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:29,810
Alright, we're setting ourselves up.

1293
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:31,430
For victory.

1294
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:35,490
Okay.

1295
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:42,900
Oh my god.

1296
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,000
I'm safe.

1297
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:44,680
I'm safe.

1298
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,100
I'm safe.

1299
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,600
I'm safe.

1300
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,520
Ish.

1301
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:47,660
I'm safer now.

1302
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:47,920
Okay.

1303
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,420
Okay.

1304
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:55,800
Break that for me.

1305
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,900
Break this thing.

1306
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,440
It's got some animal parts inside of it.

1307
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,580
It's got brains and stuff.

1308
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,400
Alright.

1309
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,000
Gosh, he...

1310
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,860
Okay, I'm gonna have to go so fast.

1311
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,420
Look how fast he shoots.

1312
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,260
What the hell?

1313
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,680
Are you kidding me?

1314
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,840
Fall mode blocks and it dies?

1315
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:28,180
Okay.

1316
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,240
No way!

1317
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:35,360
That was so horrible.

1318
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:39,700
Are you kidding me?

1319
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,740
This soul's like sure is intense.

1320
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,780
I think I am ready for...

1321
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,180
I'm ready for any difficult game now.

1322
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,020
I'm ready.

1323
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:53,820
I've done it.

1324
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,460
Turn around.

1325
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,480
Bright eyes.

1326
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,340
Every now and then I fall apart.

1327
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,840
Bright eyes.

1328
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:10,840
Okay, don't get greedy.

1329
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,060
Don't get greedy.

1330
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:12,780
Don't get greedy.

1331
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,920
Does he only shoot in one spot or like...

1332
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,640
Can he move around?

1333
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,320
Okay, he can definitely move around.

1334
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,240
Good to know.

1335
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:40,180
And also, if I'm a ball, does he push me?

1336
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:41,400
Yes, he does.

1337
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,200
So if I'm on that platform, he can push me off.

1338
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,420
I have to be very...

1339
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,260
So let's practice here.

1340
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,960
Okay, okay.

1341
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,420
You can push back.

1342
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,260
You can push back.

1343
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,540
Okay, okay.

1344
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:06,160
We're learning.

1345
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,660
We're learning.

1346
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,240
We're learning.

1347
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:15,110
Yeah, with the fire though, excuse me.

1348
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:21,030
And also, that other guy, we have to be able to use our arms.

1349
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:23,290
Because that's how you kill him.

1350
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:26,530
But I think with the... in ball form, we'll be able to...

1351
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:29,470
I can't believe I didn't notice it there.

1352
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,810
I thought it was just like a...

1353
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:34,810
I didn't even notice it, like, doing that there.

1354
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:37,290
Okay, alright, alright.

1355
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,290
I didn't trust myself, sorry.

1356
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:08,780
Okay.

1357
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,120
Wait, this is not an unscrewy guy.

1358
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,800
It's something that I have to unscrew.

1359
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:15,720
Okay, interesting.

1360
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,320
Okay, that makes a difference.

1361
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,460
Because it's not an enemy.

1362
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,180
Okay.

1363
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:30,800
Alright, we did it.

1364
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,100
We did it.

1365
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:31,520
We did it.

1366
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:43,940
It's Mt.

1367
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:43,940
Fuji.

1368
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:48,820
Okay.

1369
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:59,050
I let go just a little bit too soon.

1370
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:02,710
I let go just a little bit too soon.

1371
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:07,030
My hand cramps with this thing, I'm not gonna lie.

1372
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:10,510
Having to hold the R2 is...

1373
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:12,530
You gotta have strong hands for that.

1374
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:13,470
What the?

1375
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:14,710
Uh-oh.

1376
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:19,810
He didn't get activated.

1377
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,480
Just in case.

1378
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,560
Voice of an angel in the soul of an ojisan.

1379
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:50,840
Yeah.

1380
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:53,860
Yeah.

1381
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,080
That's me.

1382
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,240
Wait, voice of an angel?

1383
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:58,720
Really?

1384
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:00,780
Really?

1385
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,600
This is a short level, mint 30 minutes ago.

1386
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,320
We haven't been on this one for 30 minutes.

1387
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,960
I started like...

1388
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,100
I started 20 minutes ago.

1389
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:16,500
I started 20 minutes ago.

1390
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,340
I messed up.

1391
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,080
I was still in the ball form though.

1392
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,160
The fire shouldn't have killed me.

1393
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,000
I think...

1394
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,380
I'm starting to think that Astro Bot might be for masochists.

1395
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,680
Game of the year, baby.

1396
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,440
Fire should be illegal?

1397
01:40:58,760 --> 01:40:59,540
Yeah, I agree.

1398
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:08,770
I didn't even get a single one.

1399
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:12,410
I can't believe...

1400
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:13,550
I was screaming.

1401
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:20,990
I'm sorry.

1402
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:21,770
Sorry!

1403
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:25,510
So sorry.

1404
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:27,230
So sorry.

1405
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:29,170
So sorry.

1406
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:29,270
So sorry.

1407
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:30,950
So sorry.

1408
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:34,590
One

1409
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,040
day I hope to see what biblically accurate Minto looks like.

1410
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,620
I hope she has at least 10 eyes.

1411
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,420
This is biblically accurate.

1412
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,620
You're seeing it right now.

1413
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:01,090
You don't see all the eyes?

1414
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,070
You don't see all the eyes?

1415
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:30,800
I got you.

1416
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:43,380
There's a gap in between the pillars, everybody.

1417
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,520
There's a gap in between the pillars.

1418
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:55,270
So far that's definitely the toughest part for me.

1419
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:57,830
Mind the gap.

1420
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:01,930
At

1421
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:21,690
least this song doesn't make me feel I'm going as crazy as the last one.

1422
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:29,440
I'm sorry.

1423
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:35,900
Yes!

1424
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:36,300
Yes!

1425
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:36,500
Yes!

1426
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:36,660
Yes!

1427
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:36,760
Yes!

1428
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,000
We made it.

1429
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:40,400
Oh yeah!

1430
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:42,240
Oh yeah!

1431
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:45,580
Oh yeah!

1432
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:49,080
Oh yeah!

1433
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:49,900
Oh yeah!

1434
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:50,520
Oh yeah!

1435
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,540
Sorry, I'm gonna wait.

1436
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:16,460
Might have been the opportune time, but I'm...

1437
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:22,810
I have to wait again.

1438
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:24,350
I have to wait again.

1439
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:25,990
At least I'm pretty safe here.

1440
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,280
Alright.

1441
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:36,420
Alrighty.

1442
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:37,940
Okay.

1443
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:39,620
Alrighty.

1444
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,600
Okay, Fuji-san!

1445
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,000
Alright, I won't let go!

1446
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:48,260
I won't let go!

1447
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:48,900
I won't let go!

1448
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:49,480
I won't let go!

1449
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:49,980
I won't let go!

1450
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:50,540
I won't let go!

1451
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,400
Oh, they...

1452
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,300
They spin around.

1453
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:03,860
Oh my god.

1454
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:05,980
They're right on top of me.

1455
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:08,860
Okay, I'm kinda stuck.

1456
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,180
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

1457
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,440
Wait, excuse me!

1458
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,080
I don't know if I... Stand up!

1459
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:15,480
If I touch you, will I die?

1460
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:17,060
I don't know.

1461
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,060
Wait, I'm stuck.

1462
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,320
Wait, I'm stuck.

1463
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,760
Okay, I'm not stuck anymore.

1464
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,560
Okay, we're fine.

1465
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:24,760
Okay, alright.

1466
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,780
Oh my gosh.

1467
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:30,300
This timing is kind of insane.

1468
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:31,800
Does it cover the whole thing?

1469
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:34,020
Yes it does.

1470
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:36,480
Excuse me!

1471
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,540
Oh my gosh.

1472
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:47,000
My finger is getting cramped so bad.

1473
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:54,890
I don't know what to do!

1474
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:57,430
I don't know what to do!

1475
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:04,690
I don't know what to do!

1476
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:06,450
I seriously don't.

1477
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:07,330
Oh my gosh.

1478
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:09,590
Oh my gosh.

1479
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:10,670
Oh my gosh.

1480
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:12,110
You got this?

1481
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:13,670
I don't know the timing!

1482
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:15,890
I don't know the timing!

1483
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:22,660
Yeah, I know I have to charge spin them.

1484
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,380
That's what's so difficult about this.

1485
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:26,720
Wait, I think I lead them over here.

1486
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:27,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1487
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,240
Hold on.

1488
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,240
I lead them here.

1489
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,320
Alright, alright.

1490
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,640
Okay, okay.

1491
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,820
Lead them back over here.

1492
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,620
Distract them.

1493
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:42,340
Distract them.

1494
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:43,500
Come here, come here.

1495
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:44,840
Come back.

1496
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:45,560
Come here, come here.

1497
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,120
Yeah, yeah.

1498
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:50,940
Yeah!

1499
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,940
Oh my gosh, it's Devil May Cry!

1500
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:16,030
Yikes.

1501
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:19,710
The last one we got in a minute.

1502
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:20,710
This one was four.

1503
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:22,490
It's okay though.

1504
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:23,270
I beat it.

1505
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:27,790
Oh, my finger was cramping so bad.

1506
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:29,650
Holy moly!

1507
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:33,490
What are you talking about?

1508
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:36,650
It's those guys that were in the church in Devil May Cry 4 at the very beginning.

1509
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:38,010
Those very important characters.

1510
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:41,770
Duh!

1511
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:43,710
Assassin's Creed!

1512
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:44,710
What are you talking about?

1513
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:51,370
Oh, you're talking about Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4!

1514
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:53,410
Yes, yes, yes!

1515
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:55,950
It is Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4.

1516
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:56,410
Yeah!

1517
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:01,230
I read world record instead of new record.

1518
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:02,330
That'd be insane.

1519
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:06,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1520
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,590
Hard to bear.

1521
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:09,510
I'm already...

1522
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:10,790
I'm already...

1523
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:14,430
How much do I have?

1524
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:15,150
How much more?

1525
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:18,050
This level is so crazy though.

1526
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:32,490
Okay.

1527
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:37,290
Oh, but if I...

1528
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,250
Oh, my god.

1529
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,850
Are you kidding me?

1530
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:43,970
Wait, what the hell?

1531
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:51,460
Oops.

1532
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:57,880
What

1533
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,180
am I supposed to do there?

1534
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:08,400
Clap the hat?

1535
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:09,480
Okay, okay.

1536
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:17,910
I see.

1537
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,370
I did it though.

1538
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,810
Thank you so much for the friend!

1539
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:36,470
Guys, don't ever play the extra levels of Astro Bot.

1540
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:45,280
Oh, my gosh.

1541
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:59,080
Thank you so much for the gifted.

1542
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,140
Thank you.

1543
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:03,280
Don't ever play unless you're a masochist.

1544
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:05,320
And then you'll love it.

1545
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,400
Then you'll really be so happy.

1546
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,820
Thank you so much for the gifted.

1547
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:11,920
Thank you, thank you.

1548
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:13,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1549
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,320
Sorry if I missed some gifted.

1550
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:31,590
No,

1551
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:35,830
you bastards!

1552
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:37,790
I hate those guys.

1553
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:40,150
Okay, I know if I...

1554
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:44,970
These will move if I clap, but where will it move to?

1555
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:47,470
Is it gonna topple on top of me?

1556
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:49,230
I'm scared.

1557
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:52,170
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

1558
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:52,950
Thank you!

1559
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:57,570
It's my birthday tomorrow and an early happy birthday from you.

1560
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:00,370
And the wisps would make me really happy, thanks.

1561
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:02,490
And really excited for the repo collab.

1562
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:03,210
Thank you, Swan!

1563
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:04,770
Happy early birthday!

1564
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:08,910
Happy birthday to you.

1565
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:11,450
Happy birthday to you.

1566
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:14,010
Happy birthday, dear Swan.

1567
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:17,850
Happy birthday to you.

1568
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:20,930
Okay, time to find out.

1569
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:27,550
It's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

1570
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:33,130
Okay, I'm gonna have to jump.

1571
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:36,150
Oh.

1572
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:39,550
Okay.

1573
01:51:40,890 --> 01:51:41,710
And same here.

1574
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,820
Don't you dare!

1575
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:25,100
I hate that pumpkin man!

1576
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:46,940
Okay.

1577
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:48,400
Alright.

1578
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:49,760
Okay.

1579
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,300
We're fine.

1580
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:52,840
We're fine.

1581
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:01,010
Okay.

1582
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:04,190
Oh, don't get...

1583
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:06,150
I was like, what happens after this?

1584
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:09,290
I don't know, because I was a silly head.

1585
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:15,590
I

1586
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,940
thought he would just reach for it.

1587
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,560
I thought he would just reach for it.

1588
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,080
Okay.

1589
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:45,650
Yeah.

1590
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:46,590
Alright.

1591
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:47,850
We got his ass.

1592
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:02,210
You control what buttons you press?

1593
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:03,810
Don't be a smart ass to me!

1594
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:09,210
Sometimes Astro Bot reaches for things!

1595
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:12,310
And sometimes he doesn't!

1596
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:15,090
And it's not by my control!

1597
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:15,170
Bro.

1598
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:41,140
Oh, there he goes!

1599
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,220
At least this part's really easy.

1600
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,020
Actually, this one's not so bad.

1601
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,500
I did press it, but I only pressed one.

1602
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:09,140
Because it's kind of confusing.

1603
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:13,280
Because with the other ones, you sometimes only have to press one thing.

1604
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,080
Or you press the other thing.

1605
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,440
Like, you don't have to press both.

1606
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,260
But some of them you do have to press both.

1607
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:20,540
So I get...

1608
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:26,980
I get comfortable with only pressing one.

1609
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,040
And I'm like, oh, I have to press two.

1610
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:32,400
Okay.

1611
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:40,500
Oh, my god.

1612
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:42,000
Okay.

1613
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,500
My hands are so sweaty!

1614
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,380
Ectoplasm all over my controller!

1615
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:54,530
Guys, I thought this was going to be a really chill night.

1616
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:55,450
What?

1617
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:56,750
You stupid...

1618
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:57,030
Why?

1619
01:55:57,430 --> 01:56:00,370
I thought these were going to be chill, cute levels!

1620
01:56:02,890 --> 01:56:06,110
You look like you belong in Hot Topic!

1621
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:08,590
Oh, you stupid skull!

1622
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:14,270
Uh-oh, my chat froze.

1623
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:14,610
Hold on.

1624
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:17,570
Wait, how do I refresh it?

1625
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,190
How do I refresh it on my tiny monitor?

1626
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:21,930
Let me do it F5.

1627
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:26,260
Let's see.

1628
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:27,540
Oh.

1629
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,440
It worked!

1630
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,260
It worked!

1631
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,360
Wow, that was so much easier than it's usually been.

1632
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:38,220
Tiny monitor is...

1633
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:43,430
is proving its worth.

1634
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:46,230
It's proving its worth!

1635
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:48,990
Still tiny though, yeah?

1636
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:52,250
Oh, no!

1637
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:57,500
Can I still clap?

1638
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,400
Oh, please!

1639
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:02,000
Please!

1640
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,340
Okay, I got him.

1641
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:05,740
I got him.

1642
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:08,800
Okay, so then there's these.

1643
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:12,220
And they move.

1644
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,460
And below them is...

1645
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:17,140
Okay, you can't let them drop, obviously.

1646
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:17,600
Alright.

1647
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:19,800
Okay.

1648
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,320
Tiny monitor doing work.

1649
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:30,980
Okay,

1650
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:39,280
that area is also gonna have the walls sticking out.

1651
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:42,320
Oh my gosh, wait, that part is gonna be so crazy.

1652
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,560
How do I even get...

1653
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:44,360
Oh.

1654
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:44,480
Wow.

1655
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:54,690
Is there like a jump platform somewhere?

1656
01:57:57,650 --> 01:57:59,230
How do I do that?

1657
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:03,250
I can't even tell.

1658
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:04,770
Clap very carefully.

1659
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,390
How do you get up?

1660
01:58:09,410 --> 01:58:10,410
How do you jump up?

1661
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:14,730
Around the cylinder.

1662
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:20,990
Okay, sorry, I'm stalling.

1663
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:23,790
I'm trying to figure it out before we go over there.

1664
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:26,270
We're so close to the end, I can see them.

1665
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:28,330
How far have we come?

1666
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:30,150
Wow.

1667
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,310
Wow.

1668
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:33,670
Oh my god.

1669
01:58:34,990 --> 01:58:35,470
Alright.

1670
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:35,610
Alright.

1671
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:41,470
And they kinda like, do like a little shmoop and they're like...

1672
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,900
Oh my god, where did this guy come from?

1673
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,540
Okay, he's...

1674
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:54,200
Oh shoot.

1675
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:00,700
Okay, do I go when they block it then?

1676
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:02,320
I assume.

1677
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,040
They'll block it for me?

1678
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:06,080
No, they don't.

1679
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:06,700
Oh shoot.

1680
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,920
Do I have to go to the left?

1681
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,980
See, that's why I was so confused.

1682
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,560
There we go.

1683
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:22,560
Nice.

1684
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:24,700
The other way.

1685
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,940
That's why I was so confused like...

1686
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:29,020
How do I do this?

1687
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:32,240
What?

1688
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:34,400
I'm a right... I'm right brained.

1689
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:36,220
I'm not the creative one.

1690
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:45,360
I didn't even think it could go another way.

1691
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:52,440
Sorry.

1692
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:54,720
I got distracted.

1693
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:54,920
Correct.

1694
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:07,910
What do you mean dope brained?

1695
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:13,900
What do you mean dope brained?

1696
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:19,800
Oh my gosh, I got a comment on my Devil May Cry playthrough and they were like...

1697
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:26,840
Wow, Mint can really pay attention to stuff and play at the same time and learn the mechanics.

1698
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,160
She's really smart.

1699
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,480
And I was like...

1700
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:35,580
Guys, I said I was really smart.

1701
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:46,480
It must have been new.

1702
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:47,420
No.

1703
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:49,840
I'm smart.

1704
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:57,740
I'm smart.

1705
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:00,600
Why else would I have a big brained...

1706
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,820
Emo otherwise?

1707
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:05,560
Why else?

1708
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:06,860
I'm a genius.

1709
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:17,550
Please.

1710
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:27,540
I'm a genius.

1711
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:38,160
Page review.

1712
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,200
I'm so smart.

1713
02:01:58,730 --> 02:02:00,230
You guys are just jealous.

1714
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:02,850
You guys are just jealous.

1715
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:09,970
Savant's the genius?

1716
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:10,590
Wow.

1717
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:15,870
I'm even more of a genius than I realized.

1718
02:02:16,270 --> 02:02:18,750
I can't fucking do this part.

1719
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:26,170
I hate it.

1720
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:37,440
I hate that part the most.

1721
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:45,070
Please.

1722
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:46,350
Die.

1723
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:50,110
I

1724
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,340
did it before.

1725
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,040
I believe in you.

1726
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:56,860
Thank you.

1727
02:03:03,370 --> 02:03:04,610
Screw you guys.

1728
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:05,850
Screw you guys.

1729
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:12,790
Maybe if I get further... Closer to here, you know.

1730
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:14,530
Further.

1731
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:18,070
The timing of it is so tricky.

1732
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:24,170
Yes.

1733
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:25,710
Again.

1734
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:33,460
Okay.

1735
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:45,580
We saved it.

1736
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:46,080
We saved it.

1737
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:46,660
We saved it.

1738
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:47,620
Alright.

1739
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:47,940
Alright.

1740
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:48,240
Alright.

1741
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:54,470
Oh my god.

1742
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:06,350
Wait.

1743
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:06,670
Ah?

1744
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:12,550
Oh, I think I have to jump on top of this?

1745
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,550
Oh my gosh.

1746
02:04:14,610 --> 02:04:14,790
Wait.

1747
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:23,370
Oh my god.

1748
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:29,510
Wait.

1749
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:31,410
Wait.

1750
02:04:33,730 --> 02:04:34,810
How do I do this?

1751
02:04:34,950 --> 02:04:35,930
I don't know, you guys.

1752
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:36,030
Please.

1753
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,430
I don't know how to do this.

1754
02:04:42,070 --> 02:04:42,950
Keep going left?

1755
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:50,690
Okay.

1756
02:04:50,930 --> 02:04:50,930
Okay.

1757
02:04:50,970 --> 02:04:51,210
Okay.

1758
02:04:51,310 --> 02:04:51,450
Okay.

1759
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:52,650
Okay.

1760
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:52,930
Okay.

1761
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:01,200
How do I keep going left?

1762
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:08,120
Oh my

1763
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:23,250
god.

1764
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:28,360
Better than the last one even.

1765
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:31,260
Get me out of here.

1766
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:42,310
Who was that?

1767
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,750
I don't even know who I rescued.

1768
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:46,890
I don't even know who I rescued.

1769
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:49,330
What do I do?

1770
02:05:53,510 --> 02:05:55,710
I feel like I'm ready for...

1771
02:05:56,270 --> 02:05:58,550
Well, not ready, but like...

1772
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:00,690
I'm a little bit more prepared.

1773
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:02,830
Oh, this one is the... Yeah, this one does this.

1774
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:05,970
I'm a little bit more prepared maybe for...

1775
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:09,850
The final... That like level 300 level, you know?

1776
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:34,330
You astro those bots.

1777
02:06:34,430 --> 02:06:35,150
Oh yeah.

1778
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:39,110
Oh shoot, I forgot about the chain.

1779
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:41,550
I forgot about the chain.

1780
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:48,630
How did I live?

1781
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:52,860
How did I live?

1782
02:06:54,860 --> 02:06:55,480
Crazy.

1783
02:07:04,150 --> 02:07:05,660
Yeah, we got his butt.

1784
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:11,600
Okay, so these are little birds.

1785
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:13,300
Why would they do this?

1786
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,000
Look at the dragons.

1787
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,260
Oh, I see it all the way up there.

1788
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:24,940
I hate the aliens too.

1789
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,000
Oh gosh.

1790
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:26,440
Okay.

1791
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,500
What the heck is going on up there?

1792
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:33,180
There's spikes and then there's...

1793
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:35,180
Oh my god.

1794
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:35,640
And then there's spikes.

1795
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:36,840
There's spikes over there.

1796
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,680
And there's spikes on the side and spikes on the top.

1797
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:45,020
Are

1798
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:50,750
you kidding me?

1799
02:07:55,940 --> 02:07:57,060
You slide down.

1800
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:58,400
Good to know.

1801
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:01,020
Wow, you slide down.

1802
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,720
Evil ropes.

1803
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:17,980
Astro bots got no upper body strength apparently.

1804
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:20,420
He's too slippery.

1805
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:22,040
Can I?

1806
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,720
Okay, so this is one...

1807
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,720
If I hold down both...

1808
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:31,400
I think I get the same amount as if I hold down one.

1809
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:31,920
Okay, cool.

1810
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,080
Rope covered in butter.

1811
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:35,200
True, right?

1812
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:38,560
Alright.

1813
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:38,760
Alright.

1814
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:44,560
Oh no, please.

1815
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:45,120
Grab it!

1816
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:45,720
Astro bot!

1817
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:53,090
How am I supposed to swing if I'm constantly falling down though?

1818
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:57,030
Are you kidding me?

1819
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:03,030
You might not be the best mid that I know.

1820
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,610
What do you mean?

1821
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:06,710
You're the best ghost mid?

1822
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:09,130
What is this backhanded compliment?

1823
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:25,680
Thanks, I guess.

1824
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:29,140
Thanks, I guess.

1825
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,400
It's fine.

1826
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,100
It's fine.

1827
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:35,080
I don't have to be...

1828
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:37,180
the best, you know.

1829
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,040
It's fine.

1830
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,340
It's fine.

1831
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:45,360
Okay, so even holding up doesn't do anything.

1832
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:46,340
What?

1833
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:49,600
How am I supposed to stay up?

1834
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:51,720
I don't understand this one.

1835
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:06,350
Can you boost after you... But I let go!

1836
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:13,310
Let me try again.

1837
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:16,350
Oh my gosh, my depth perception.

1838
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:22,910
I just have to jump to the next one immediately?

1839
02:10:23,610 --> 02:10:26,950
But like, why make it look like they're little swinging guys then?

1840
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:30,050
If that's not the case...

1841
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,050
I'll try.

1842
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:33,770
I'll try.

1843
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,320
Okay.

1844
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:41,060
Alright.

1845
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:49,510
You

1846
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:56,270
are the best mid I know?

1847
02:10:56,970 --> 02:10:57,690
Thanks.

1848
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,020
What's

1849
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,530
wrong with my tiny monitor?

1850
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:24,730
What's wrong with my tiny monitor?

1851
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:27,070
You're just not used to him yet.

1852
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:31,910
Once you get to know him, he's a really great guy.

1853
02:11:33,450 --> 02:11:34,550
Tiny monitor.

1854
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:39,870
Size doesn't matter.

1855
02:11:45,790 --> 02:11:48,050
Unless it's a really cute tiny monitor.

1856
02:11:52,410 --> 02:11:55,190
I think it's doing a really great job too.

1857
02:12:03,570 --> 02:12:07,790
I can read more than four comments at a time.

1858
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:13,610
It's much bigger now that I enhanced the full screen.

1859
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:17,750
The best mid anyone knows... Wait.

1860
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:19,850
Anyone who says otherwise is lying.

1861
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:21,850
Yeah.

1862
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:22,310
Wait.

1863
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:22,890
Yeah.

1864
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:30,470
Senator Armstrong is the real maid because he makes a mother of all omelettes.

1865
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:35,050
I'm up to six what?

1866
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:35,650
Tries?

1867
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:37,150
Sorry.

1868
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:42,790
I don't like this part.

1869
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:44,710
I don't like it.

1870
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:49,400
I don't like this part.

1871
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,460
I'm really tall.

1872
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:01,000
I couldn't see.

1873
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:05,960
I don't like that part.

1874
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:07,840
I got past it though.

1875
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:10,040
I just don't.

1876
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:11,740
I didn't like it though.

1877
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:14,820
I didn't enjoy getting past it or anything.

1878
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:19,420
You made it though.

1879
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:20,540
Yeah, I did.

1880
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,360
Somehow.

1881
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:24,100
Okay.

1882
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:24,860
Maybe it's...

1883
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:27,940
I was going to say it's not as bad as I thought.

1884
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:42,080
Bird makes me feel so slow.

1885
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:06,700
No, no, no.

1886
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:10,070
I didn't have any boost.

1887
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:12,170
I didn't have any boost.

1888
02:14:15,190 --> 02:14:16,410
I don't know.

1889
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:26,790
But I got the strat down now at least which is pretty good.

1890
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:32,490
You see, I am a genius maybe.

1891
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:36,390
I need to stop saying that.

1892
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:40,750
I need to stop calling myself a genius.

1893
02:14:40,750 --> 02:14:40,950
Genius!

1894
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:12,000
Yeah,

1895
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:28,840
screw you!

1896
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,320
What do I do?

1897
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:42,160
New levels?

1898
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:43,860
Yeah, they put out new levels.

1899
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,080
Just a couple and they are all really, really hard.

1900
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,940
What am I supposed to do here?

1901
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:52,680
Maybe I go past him.

1902
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,280
Maybe I don't even beat him up.

1903
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:08,790
I'm not even going to attempt trying to kill him, I think.

1904
02:16:09,490 --> 02:16:10,250
Boost over him.

1905
02:16:10,290 --> 02:16:12,010
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to try and do.

1906
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,310
Dang it!

1907
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:27,690
Chicken first and then laser legs.

1908
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:30,270
I think you are correct.

1909
02:16:33,390 --> 02:16:34,110
I forgot to jump.

1910
02:16:35,570 --> 02:16:35,950
My bad.

1911
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:10,070
Is this a reference to the MGSV chicken hat?

1912
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:14,290
That would make it just that much better.

1913
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:20,320
Guys, all I've been thinking about is Peace Walker.

1914
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,560
I want to play it again so bad.

1915
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:24,820
I want to play it again.

1916
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:25,120
I want to play it again.

1917
02:17:46,390 --> 02:17:53,410
Okay, I need to stop boosting first before I laser leg.

1918
02:17:55,330 --> 02:17:58,310
Or I need to stop using laser leg before I boost.

1919
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:01,030
Because once I'm out of laser leg, I don't get it back.

1920
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:02,670
Until I'm back on the ground.

1921
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:07,490
I'll have to wait DMC first this week.

1922
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:12,490
Yeah, DMC Fridays and Metal Gear Saturdays.

1923
02:18:16,770 --> 02:18:18,470
Wait, boost first here?

1924
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:20,350
Wait, someone said the opposite.

1925
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:23,510
That I chicken here first and then I leg boost after.

1926
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:27,830
DMCA.

1927
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:33,990
Chicken then boost.

1928
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:35,590
I thought boost was chicken.

1929
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:38,650
Oh, by boost I meant chicken.

1930
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:42,030
Yeah, maybe we'll call... Since it's too... It's kind of confusing.

1931
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:45,210
Let's say chicken and let's say legs.

1932
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:47,190
Chicken legs!

1933
02:18:50,850 --> 02:18:52,990
I hope you guys aren't hungry.

1934
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:55,910
Chicken legs.

1935
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:59,670
This area is so pretty though.

1936
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:02,170
I'm glad that it's not on a timer.

1937
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:04,830
Okay, but the game is timey.

1938
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:06,270
Okay, let's go!

1939
02:19:10,110 --> 02:19:10,590
Oh.

1940
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:12,150
Oh!

1941
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:17,690
Okay, now here we go and I boost at the very end.

1942
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:25,550
Okay, okay.

1943
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:27,390
This is so evil.

1944
02:19:27,790 --> 02:19:30,390
So I'm gonna have to boost on top of him too.

1945
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:33,330
You see, these are the spikes I was talking about earlier.

1946
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:35,110
They're on the sides, they're on the walls.

1947
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:36,330
They're everywhere.

1948
02:19:36,330 --> 02:19:36,450
They're everywhere.

1949
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:41,610
Yeah, now two more times.

1950
02:19:45,510 --> 02:19:48,490
This one is so evil though because it's like...

1951
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:50,190
Spitty man.

1952
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:57,170
Okay, so once I get there I gotta be like...

1953
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:59,690
I gotta laser leg him.

1954
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:10,480
What's happening here?

1955
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:11,980
Wait, what is this?

1956
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:13,360
I lived?

1957
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,420
Astrobot, your arm extends!

1958
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,360
And you're only telling me this right now!

1959
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:20,500
Sorry, I'm trying not to...

1960
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:42,130
Astrobot, we could've...

1961
02:20:42,130 --> 02:20:48,330
And yet, you so selfishly let me have to do things over and over and over again.

1962
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,150
Okay.

1963
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:54,590
Okay, so there are two going at the same time.

1964
02:20:56,790 --> 02:20:58,810
No, camera please!

1965
02:20:59,350 --> 02:21:00,190
Camera, what are you doing?

1966
02:21:00,450 --> 02:21:01,410
I can't see!

1967
02:21:01,550 --> 02:21:02,050
Okay, thank you.

1968
02:21:05,410 --> 02:21:06,430
How do I talk?

1969
02:21:06,470 --> 02:21:07,190
When do I go?

1970
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:08,690
Stop!

1971
02:21:08,850 --> 02:21:09,770
Camera, please!

1972
02:21:11,530 --> 02:21:12,490
Focus trolling.

1973
02:21:14,530 --> 02:21:15,130
Um...

1974
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:24,750
It has to be...

1975
02:21:24,750 --> 02:21:27,490
Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm going blind.

1976
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:29,330
It has to be...

1977
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:33,590
When the spikes are right there on the bottom.

1978
02:21:35,530 --> 02:21:36,730
Because otherwise...

1979
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:38,010
Oh my gosh, this is the worst!

1980
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,590
This is the worst!

1981
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:44,250
Because otherwise...

1982
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:47,210
I will...

1983
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:50,710
I will run into the spikes, I think.

1984
02:21:51,550 --> 02:21:52,610
What is happening?

1985
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:54,170
Stop focusing!

1986
02:21:57,010 --> 02:21:58,790
Okay, I'm just gonna have to go for it.

1987
02:21:59,410 --> 02:22:00,510
And hope and pray.

1988
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:03,030
I'll go...

1989
02:22:03,030 --> 02:22:03,650
Now.

1990
02:22:05,730 --> 02:22:06,570
I'm stuck?

1991
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:07,050
Wait.

1992
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:08,450
Astrobot!

1993
02:22:09,470 --> 02:22:10,030
Astrobot!

1994
02:22:11,150 --> 02:22:11,710
Astrobot!

1995
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:13,770
What do I do?

1996
02:22:13,930 --> 02:22:14,470
I'm stuck.

1997
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:27,550
Boost up?

1998
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:29,370
Are you kidding me?

1999
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:31,290
Oh my gosh, I'm not gonna make it.

2000
02:22:31,610 --> 02:22:32,690
I'm not gonna make it.

2001
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:35,670
I think I'll miss the platform.

2002
02:22:36,830 --> 02:22:37,810
I'll try chicken though.

2003
02:22:38,430 --> 02:22:39,470
Oh, it won't let me chicken.

2004
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:44,340
What do I do?

2005
02:22:44,420 --> 02:22:45,520
I don't wanna die!

2006
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:49,120
I can't hold any... Nothing works.

2007
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:50,640
Nothing works.

2008
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:51,740
John's happy birthday!

2009
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:52,900
Sorry, I'm in a panic.

2010
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:53,820
I can't sing right now.

2011
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:54,300
I'm sorry!

2012
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:56,960
I don't even see your super chat.

2013
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:57,580
I'm so sorry.

2014
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,860
This is why I never told you about my arm.

2015
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,160
I'm afraid to jump.

2016
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,340
I think I'm just gonna miss.

2017
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:13,820
What's the point of saving me?

2018
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:27,110
Okay.

2019
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:32,210
Okay.

2020
02:23:53,430 --> 02:23:54,930
Okay, sorry.

2021
02:23:55,130 --> 02:23:55,990
Slow and steady.

2022
02:23:56,510 --> 02:23:57,930
So much for speedrunning, Nissan.

2023
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:14,060
Okay, there's a slimy man.

2024
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,540
Alright, there's a slimy man.

2025
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:44,010
We got so far, you guys.

2026
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:45,930
We almost won.

2027
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:48,370
We basically one-shot that area.

2028
02:24:50,190 --> 02:24:52,270
I wasn't even under the shadow.

2029
02:24:52,510 --> 02:24:52,890
Are you kidding?

2030
02:24:55,610 --> 02:24:56,850
I'm gonna kill these monkeys.

2031
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:58,470
I'm gonna kill all these monkeys.

2032
02:24:58,770 --> 02:24:59,850
I'm gonna kill these monkeys.

2033
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:00,930
I'm gonna kill them.

2034
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:01,950
I'm gonna murder them.

2035
02:25:02,130 --> 02:25:03,790
They're never gonna have families ever again.

2036
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:06,190
No, I'm setting this whole land on fire!

2037
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:10,470
Everything will burn.

2038
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:11,790
Everything will burn.

2039
02:25:53,790 --> 02:25:55,130
Burn.

2040
02:25:55,710 --> 02:25:56,470
Burn!

2041
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:17,930
Oh,

2042
02:26:36,050 --> 02:26:36,690
that's so awkward.

2043
02:26:39,010 --> 02:26:40,190
Don't lick my nose.

2044
02:26:40,470 --> 02:26:40,850
There we go.

2045
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:52,080
I'm now Evil Minky.

2046
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:56,720
I'm Evil Minky, everybody.

2047
02:27:02,550 --> 02:27:06,750
I'm Evil Minky and you shall only address me as such.

2048
02:27:10,290 --> 02:27:10,690
Okay.

2049
02:27:22,770 --> 02:27:25,590
I wasn't even touching the shadow.

2050
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:26,670
You guys saw that, right?

2051
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:29,970
You guys saw that, right?

2052
02:27:30,330 --> 02:27:32,110
I wasn't even touching the shadow.

2053
02:27:34,250 --> 02:27:35,570
I was clear.

2054
02:27:35,710 --> 02:27:37,310
I was clear from it.

2055
02:27:40,890 --> 02:27:41,850
I'm blind.

2056
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:03,400
Evil Minky be like, I got you guys a huge...

2057
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:07,060
I'm not laughing.

2058
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:11,620
I'm laughing with my... I'm frown laughing.

2059
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:15,200
I've been paid.

2060
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:18,340
I can't.

2061
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,160
I won't laugh ever again.

2062
02:28:25,350 --> 02:28:26,650
No, I'm not laughing.

2063
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:38,400
Evil Minky be like, I'm 5'6".

2064
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:45,370
I won't ever laugh again.

2065
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:47,890
I won't ever laugh again.

2066
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:48,730
I'll never laugh again.

2067
02:28:52,830 --> 02:28:53,810
Will we make it?

2068
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:12,430
I hate... I hate these guys so much.

2069
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:15,970
I ran right into it.

2070
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:35,560
Thank you.

2071
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:40,200
I'm in public buying sourdough from the markets.

2072
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:45,700
I just had to lock in and attempt to keep the straightest face because I heard the screams of the damned if I'm right here.

2073
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:47,960
I'm dying.

2074
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:50,640
I'm in the damned and you're laughing.

2075
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,680
Hi, Evil Minky.

2076
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:56,820
I don't love anything.

2077
02:29:58,460 --> 02:29:59,920
This world deserves to burn.

2078
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:03,100
And if you are part of this world, you deserve to burn.

2079
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:13,740
Okay, I'm done not smiling.

2080
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:16,520
But I'm still evil.

2081
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:18,260
Don't get it wrong.

2082
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:20,680
I'm still evil.

2083
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:23,080
I'm still evil.

2084
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:23,860
Wait.

2085
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:26,920
I'll just... I'll never... I'll never smile.

2086
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:28,860
This is better.

2087
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,860
Anyway, now this is really evil.

2088
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:44,640
On a scale of 1 to evil, how evil is this?

2089
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:48,560
If this was...

2090
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:52,460
If this were your sleep paralysis demon...

2091
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:59,030
Pure evil.

2092
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,270
Hello.

2093
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:08,310
My

2094
02:31:16,690 --> 02:31:17,410
blade.

2095
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:24,770
It sucks because this one isn't even... This one is like...

2096
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:26,450
Honestly, not even that bad.

2097
02:31:28,250 --> 02:31:30,130
I was doing so well.

2098
02:31:30,910 --> 02:31:32,030
The one part.

2099
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,360
Go away.

2100
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:05,640
Okay, so here I jump and then I boost.

2101
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,600
Little cat going not-heh-heh energy.

2102
02:32:25,390 --> 02:32:26,630
I don't know how that happened.

2103
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:29,610
I don't know how that happened, but it happened.

2104
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:33,590
Oh my god.

2105
02:32:33,890 --> 02:32:35,090
Save somehow.

2106
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:37,430
Does evil mean to accept marriage proposals?

2107
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:37,950
No!

2108
02:32:41,350 --> 02:32:42,230
Evil, why cute?

2109
02:32:42,370 --> 02:32:42,670
No!

2110
02:32:53,530 --> 02:32:54,130
Okay.

2111
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:19,280
The clutch of the century.

2112
02:33:23,580 --> 02:33:25,980
I don't think I'm evil anymore.

2113
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:31,500
Actually, we'll see if we can get past Mr. Slime and then I'll see.

2114
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:34,900
I gotta get past Mr. Slime and then I'll see.

2115
02:33:55,210 --> 02:33:56,310
I'm scared.

2116
02:33:57,750 --> 02:33:58,870
I'm scared.

2117
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:05,380
I'm scared.

2118
02:34:22,590 --> 02:34:25,830
Okay, it's just a pink... It's just a pink slime.

2119
02:34:26,130 --> 02:34:27,510
It's just a pink slime.

2120
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:29,690
It's just a pink slime.

2121
02:34:41,690 --> 02:34:46,260
That was it!

2122
02:34:54,030 --> 02:34:56,190
That was the end of it.

2123
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:58,090
Oh my god.

2124
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,780
Get me out of here.

2125
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:13,340
It was a single slime!

2126
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:20,840
I want her to stay here instead of Turquoise Minto.

2127
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:06,900
I felt so good about my victory too.

2128
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:13,520
I'm never... I'm never turning... I'm never turning evil mode ever again.

2129
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:16,960
I'm gonna go get some water.

2130
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:17,640
I'll be right back.

2131
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:33,720
Actually, I know I talked about a migraine earlier.

2132
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:35,260
It's totally gone.

2133
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:37,800
It's totally gone.

2134
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:38,940
Let's go.

2135
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:43,220
And we did four out of five.

2136
02:38:45,460 --> 02:38:46,760
Thruster bust.

2137
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:50,420
Was I close with this one?

2138
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:51,120
I can't remember.

2139
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,300
I'm stronger now.

2140
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:58,480
I've defeated... Since then I've defeated three other worlds.

2141
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:00,440
I'm stronger now.

2142
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:01,380
I was close.

2143
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:03,740
Okay, let's try it.

2144
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:06,240
Let's try it.

2145
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:14,870
I'm more powerful.

2146
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:24,500
I don't know if I can actually get the dogs while...

2147
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:30,480
When they're...

2148
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:31,640
But not dogs.

2149
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:32,920
The bells.

2150
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:36,240
I think I just wanted to say dogs.

2151
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:40,180
The bells when they're steaming.

2152
02:39:40,900 --> 02:39:41,740
I don't think I can.

2153
02:39:43,020 --> 02:39:43,940
I don't think I can.

2154
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:45,820
Tofu!

2155
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:47,660
Something, something.

2156
02:39:48,580 --> 02:39:49,900
Akasupacha, I love you.

2157
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:51,220
Thank you!

2158
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:54,320
I didn't have to, but thank you so much!

2159
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:56,820
Thank you.

2160
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:03,360
It's weird.

2161
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:05,460
We used to go up and now we're going sideways.

2162
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:08,180
I have to get used to it.

2163
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:09,960
Do you really?

2164
02:40:11,380 --> 02:40:13,440
Do you really love me?

2165
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:24,900
I think I should kill this guy.

2166
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:32,690
I'm stronger now!

2167
02:40:33,010 --> 02:40:34,390
I'm so strong now!

2168
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:36,030
Oh!

2169
02:40:48,010 --> 02:40:49,710
You guys are just like...

2170
02:40:49,710 --> 02:40:51,310
Hey Minto, have more confidence.

2171
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:52,110
Oh you can!

2172
02:40:52,470 --> 02:40:52,910
Okay, cool.

2173
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:55,090
Have more confidence Minto.

2174
02:40:56,170 --> 02:40:58,530
This is what happens when I have confidence.

2175
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:03,050
Nothing ever goes in my favor.

2176
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:14,740
Oh shoot.

2177
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:15,860
I got him still.

2178
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:18,540
I got him still.

2179
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:23,300
Oh shoot.

2180
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:24,020
Kill him.

2181
02:41:27,060 --> 02:41:28,880
Kill all slimes!

2182
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:31,140
Destroy all slimes!

2183
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:33,240
How did I miss?

2184
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:34,280
It's right there!

2185
02:41:41,980 --> 02:41:44,980
Guys, I think I broke the game!

2186
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:53,520
I think I broke the game!

2187
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:56,500
I didn't know you could do that.

2188
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:04,560
What the heck?

2189
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:08,900
Why is the easiest part the thing that's messing me up the most?

2190
02:42:09,080 --> 02:42:11,900
Oh that was close.

2191
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:26,930
My bad.

2192
02:42:27,130 --> 02:42:29,250
I was more focused on killing him.

2193
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:38,890
Alright.

2194
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:44,070
What the heck did I do?

2195
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:46,510
Too much thrust and not enough busting.

2196
02:42:47,590 --> 02:42:49,730
If you break the game, that should count as a win.

2197
02:42:50,990 --> 02:42:53,070
Is that a speedrun strat actually?

2198
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:08,870
I can't see that as a speedrun strat.

2199
02:43:10,510 --> 02:43:11,570
Oh my gosh!

2200
02:43:11,630 --> 02:43:12,670
I keep hitting the tentacle.

2201
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:19,770
I already feel more confident in my movements though.

2202
02:43:23,310 --> 02:43:24,730
I can do this.

2203
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:25,510
Maybe.

2204
02:43:26,270 --> 02:43:27,010
No confidence.

2205
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:27,930
No confidence!

2206
02:43:28,130 --> 02:43:28,590
No confidence!

2207
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:36,230
I didn't mean it!

2208
02:43:36,470 --> 02:43:37,650
I didn't mean it game!

2209
02:43:40,250 --> 02:43:41,090
I didn't mean it!

2210
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,770
Don't please!

2211
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:46,110
The controller has...

2212
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:49,530
The controller has a microphone.

2213
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:56,470
It can hear me.

2214
02:43:56,670 --> 02:43:57,910
It can hear me.

2215
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:03,520
That was close.

2216
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:04,620
Get out of here.

2217
02:44:14,740 --> 02:44:18,640
I believe you stand absolutely no chance.

2218
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:19,020
Yeah!

2219
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:20,820
I stand no chance!

2220
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:25,060
It said nothing worked.

2221
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:26,900
I have to just not think.

2222
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:29,640
Tom Cruise style.

2223
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:32,400
I am Maverick.

2224
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:33,520
I am Maverick.

2225
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:40,640
Even the spike guy gave up on...

2226
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,640
Okay, I'm really throwing now.

2227
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:43,660
What the heck is going on?

2228
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:46,840
I'm making all these little mistakes.

2229
02:44:57,870 --> 02:45:02,570
We at Sony PlayStation like to listen in to your games and screw you over when you think you're doing good.

2230
02:45:04,430 --> 02:45:07,870
More like Goose how you fell into the ocean there.

2231
02:45:09,450 --> 02:45:15,040
I am dead, so...

2232
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:17,720
Maybe I'm more like Goose than Maverick.

2233
02:45:23,720 --> 02:45:24,900
Talk to me, Goose.

2234
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:26,640
You guys can ever say that too.

2235
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:27,920
You can be like, talk to me, Minto.

2236
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:31,220
And I'll beam some really...

2237
02:45:31,220 --> 02:45:37,080
Really cool and wise thoughts into your brain.

2238
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:43,160
No, I'm right here, so I can't do it.

2239
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:44,620
It has to be like a...

2240
02:45:44,620 --> 02:45:46,300
Like a psychological thing.

2241
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:48,600
You know?

2242
02:45:50,980 --> 02:45:51,500
Well...

2243
02:45:51,500 --> 02:45:54,840
This level alone is adding content for the Minto phrasing comp.

2244
02:45:54,900 --> 02:45:56,320
How am I supposed to say?

2245
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:57,540
This is us.

2246
02:45:57,960 --> 02:45:58,700
We're bursting.

2247
02:45:59,160 --> 02:45:59,860
We're thrusting.

2248
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:01,440
We're busting.

2249
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:03,220
This is literally the name of the level.

2250
02:46:05,180 --> 02:46:06,220
I can't...

2251
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:09,560
I can't say it any other way.

2252
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:12,780
I can't do it any other way.

2253
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:12,860
Okay.

2254
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:21,720
I'm trying to do the bust into him, so it like...

2255
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:23,120
Makes him explode.

2256
02:46:23,740 --> 02:46:24,140
You know?

2257
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:26,660
Or is this the thrust?

2258
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:27,400
I don't know!

2259
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:30,100
Is this the thrust or the bust?

2260
02:46:37,900 --> 02:46:38,480
Oh shoot.

2261
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:39,920
I usually wait.

2262
02:46:42,780 --> 02:46:44,260
One leads to another.

2263
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:48,640
Really?

2264
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:50,200
So there is an order of operations?

2265
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:53,360
Oh my god!

2266
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:00,680
It gave me a second chance!

2267
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:04,800
It gave me a second chance!

2268
02:47:11,250 --> 02:47:12,370
Kind world.

2269
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:20,910
Alright, let's try and...

2270
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:25,340
I missed.

2271
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:26,820
How could you miss?

2272
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:33,920
Alright.

2273
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:40,110
I'm just gonna ignore him, like I used to before.

2274
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:44,530
Not you!

2275
02:47:44,890 --> 02:47:45,450
You're dead.

2276
02:47:46,630 --> 02:47:46,850
Okay.

2277
02:47:48,050 --> 02:47:51,270
Talk to me, Minto starts hearing Ocelot quotes in your brain.

2278
02:47:52,390 --> 02:47:53,390
It's true.

2279
02:47:54,370 --> 02:47:55,270
Kind world.

2280
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:55,470
Die.

2281
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:00,920
Okay.

2282
02:48:01,980 --> 02:48:04,900
I don't know what's wrong with me in this part here.

2283
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:22,780
This part too though.

2284
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:24,600
Oh, there's so many parts that I've died on.

2285
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:32,990
He's happy.

2286
02:48:33,290 --> 02:48:34,630
He's like, you just killed a man!

2287
02:48:37,290 --> 02:48:39,270
Okay, we'll go to this side.

2288
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:45,420
Oh shoot, I...

2289
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:48,460
I can't, I can't, I can't leggy there.

2290
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:51,520
I can't leggy there or else I won't be able to make it.

2291
02:48:52,620 --> 02:48:54,160
Okay, I forgot about that.

2292
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:56,680
I can't leggy.

2293
02:49:10,450 --> 02:49:10,970
Saved!

2294
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:16,930
Hope you're having a fun day, stay safe.

2295
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:19,150
Thank you, I am having so much fun.

2296
02:49:20,230 --> 02:49:22,990
Despite my mauling.

2297
02:49:24,250 --> 02:49:25,550
I always have fun.

2298
02:49:27,930 --> 02:49:30,990
You know, you can tell if I'm not having fun in the game.

2299
02:49:32,930 --> 02:49:33,510
I think.

2300
02:49:37,910 --> 02:49:39,870
Just some mild mauling.

2301
02:49:44,630 --> 02:49:48,350
I always thought that I was pretty good at handling my emotions.

2302
02:49:48,350 --> 02:49:50,810
But I think, actually...

2303
02:49:50,810 --> 02:49:53,610
Then people were like, you wear your emotions on your sleeve.

2304
02:49:53,710 --> 02:49:55,390
And I was like, I do?

2305
02:49:57,410 --> 02:49:57,850
And...

2306
02:49:59,190 --> 02:50:02,030
Then I was like, well I guess I wouldn't be a ghost if I...

2307
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:04,970
If I was good with my emotions.

2308
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:06,450
I just won one of your...

2309
02:50:06,450 --> 02:50:07,070
Shikishi!

2310
02:50:07,870 --> 02:50:09,170
No, I virulent!

2311
02:50:10,770 --> 02:50:11,950
Oh my god!

2312
02:50:12,290 --> 02:50:15,230
Oh, I was wondering when those were...

2313
02:50:18,530 --> 02:50:20,270
It's okay, I've waited too long.

2314
02:50:21,810 --> 02:50:23,810
My time was gonna be all off.

2315
02:50:24,490 --> 02:50:26,190
I was wondering when they were gonna give those away.

2316
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:57,720
Oh, come on!

2317
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:59,200
I barely tapped it!

2318
02:51:01,480 --> 02:51:04,140
Yeah, congrats virulent, congrats!

2319
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:09,280
I barely tapped it.

2320
02:51:22,410 --> 02:51:24,610
There we go, that's what I wanted to do before.

2321
02:51:33,590 --> 02:51:35,330
Oh my god, oh my god!

2322
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:42,700
Alright, alright.

2323
02:52:06,620 --> 02:52:08,660
Okay, I need to just burst.

2324
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:11,920
No laggy, no laggy, no laggy.

2325
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:15,340
Just, just, just burst, just burst.

2326
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:18,180
Oh, what's wrong with me?

2327
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:20,760
Maybe, just kidding, maybe I can...

2328
02:52:30,020 --> 02:52:32,520
I was doing so well that round!

2329
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:35,780
I was doing so well!

2330
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:51,580
I jumped further than I anticipated.

2331
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:03,310
Will it feel good to win?

2332
02:53:03,370 --> 02:53:04,330
I don't know anymore.

2333
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:05,690
What is it?

2334
02:53:06,410 --> 02:53:09,310
What does feeling good feel like anymore?

2335
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:33,260
Oh shit!

2336
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:03,860
Evil Mint, no!

2337
02:54:05,140 --> 02:54:08,000
Because you guys say that you don't like me anymore.

2338
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:45,340
Oh my god, how did I make it?

2339
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:15,480
I pressed it!

2340
02:55:15,560 --> 02:55:16,340
I did it!

2341
02:55:16,340 --> 02:55:18,600
I pressed it!

2342
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,140
I pressed it!

2343
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:21,640
I did!

2344
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:24,680
I pressed the dog button!

2345
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:30,020
I pressed the dog button!

2346
02:55:35,240 --> 02:55:38,660
I pressed the dog...

2347
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:40,800
I pressed the dog button.

2348
02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:07,760
Oh, shit.

2349
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:15,360
All I can see is...

2350
02:56:16,060 --> 02:56:18,900
This is the perfect one to end on, huh?

2351
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,760
Because it's so green and it's St. Paddy's Day.

2352
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:29,140
You guys are wearing green because you're like, yeah, I like Minto when she's green.

2353
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:32,300
Oh, shit.

2354
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:36,080
I keep fucking dying to the stupid spikes.

2355
02:56:47,830 --> 02:56:48,770
Oh, shit.

2356
02:56:49,210 --> 02:56:50,570
I need to do the thing.

2357
02:56:53,670 --> 02:56:54,990
I need to do the thing.

2358
02:57:01,220 --> 02:57:03,200
Is there a reason you're not lasering?

2359
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:04,920
It's because I run out of laser.

2360
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:13,860
I'm trying to get him with the... I said it earlier.

2361
02:57:13,960 --> 02:57:15,460
I'm trying to get him with like the...

2362
02:57:16,320 --> 02:57:17,460
That power-up.

2363
02:57:19,700 --> 02:57:20,380
But...

2364
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:23,260
Clearly I'm just really shitty at games.

2365
02:57:23,960 --> 02:57:26,900
And then it twists, so it doesn't matter anyway.

2366
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:47,830
Like that.

2367
02:57:48,710 --> 02:57:50,810
That's the ideal...

2368
02:57:51,650 --> 02:57:52,310
formation.

2369
02:57:59,360 --> 02:58:00,300
Oh, please.

2370
02:58:00,820 --> 02:58:01,120
Okay.

2371
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:02,540
Alright.

2372
02:58:15,100 --> 02:58:16,740
Oh, why did I do that?

2373
02:58:29,570 --> 02:58:31,110
At this rate...

2374
02:58:31,110 --> 02:58:35,050
I think I would be able to speedrun this if I were any good.

2375
02:58:38,190 --> 02:58:41,050
At this rate... How many times have I done this damn level?

2376
02:58:43,010 --> 02:58:43,470
I

2377
02:58:49,830 --> 02:58:50,850
didn't have enough boost.

2378
02:58:51,410 --> 02:58:53,330
I didn't have enough boost!

2379
02:58:56,050 --> 02:58:56,570
Oh,

2380
02:59:17,220 --> 02:59:17,360
god.

2381
02:59:25,830 --> 02:59:26,890
I'm so tired.

2382
02:59:27,790 --> 02:59:29,690
Please put me out of my misery!

2383
02:59:31,270 --> 02:59:33,290
Please put me out of my misery!

2384
02:59:34,090 --> 02:59:37,630
I've done this so many... I've played these games!

2385
02:59:38,070 --> 02:59:38,250
Oops.

2386
02:59:38,850 --> 02:59:39,750
Not before.

2387
02:59:45,470 --> 02:59:48,630
I've played these games before!

2388
03:00:07,330 --> 03:00:08,690
I almost...

2389
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:12,590
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2390
03:00:12,590 --> 03:00:14,090
You can't catch me.

2391
03:00:14,450 --> 03:00:16,090
I'm the gingerbread man!

2392
03:00:18,310 --> 03:00:22,090
I almost did not...

2393
03:00:22,090 --> 03:00:24,370
make that.

2394
03:00:30,230 --> 03:00:30,850
We're back.

2395
03:00:32,010 --> 03:00:32,530
We're back.

2396
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:48,430
Why did you do that?

2397
03:00:49,210 --> 03:00:50,010
Why?

2398
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:51,810
Why did you do that?

2399
03:01:20,830 --> 03:01:26,390
I also think this one wouldn't be so bad if it didn't feel...

2400
03:01:26,390 --> 03:01:27,750
so damn long!

2401
03:01:32,120 --> 03:01:34,560
Even though I don't think it's even that long.

2402
03:01:34,980 --> 03:01:36,580
It just feels so long.

2403
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:00,700
It's long for no checkpoints.

2404
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:05,160
They were like, challenge level's real.

2405
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:09,080
Come on, why am I doing different from before?

2406
03:02:13,340 --> 03:02:15,240
I feel like I'm going at the same pace.

2407
03:02:20,050 --> 03:02:22,710
It shouldn't get me with the spikes.

2408
03:02:23,630 --> 03:02:24,870
Or maybe I'm faster.

2409
03:02:25,330 --> 03:02:26,030
I don't know.

2410
03:02:31,490 --> 03:02:32,090
Am

2411
03:02:56,780 --> 03:02:58,120
I too fast?

2412
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:00,640
Am I too fast?

2413
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:02,820
For the level?

2414
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:04,220
I'm too good?

2415
03:03:08,460 --> 03:03:11,820
I got too good at doing it and then I got too fast.

2416
03:03:12,100 --> 03:03:13,640
And now I can't...

2417
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:20,120
I don't know what speed I was at though.

2418
03:03:20,220 --> 03:03:22,320
Because I was going as fast as I could before.

2419
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:25,300
And now I'm going as fast as I can now.

2420
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:30,080
So I don't know where the middle ground becomes.

2421
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:33,040
I need to pay attention.

2422
03:03:33,320 --> 03:03:37,040
The re-chat on my cute tiny monitor is so perfect.

2423
03:03:37,640 --> 03:03:39,340
It was definitely a great investment.

2424
03:03:42,360 --> 03:03:42,760
Oh shit.

2425
03:03:43,560 --> 03:03:45,660
Wow, it can do that apparently.

2426
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:53,900
I'm learning all sorts of new things about this game.

2427
03:03:59,240 --> 03:04:00,780
Knocked out of the park.

2428
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:02,640
Home run, baby!

2429
03:04:09,640 --> 03:04:13,140
It's hard to watch Yoshi get thrusted and busted for three hours straight.

2430
03:04:23,130 --> 03:04:24,590
I lost the timing.

2431
03:04:47,090 --> 03:04:48,310
My chat froze.

2432
03:04:48,430 --> 03:04:48,750
Hold on.

2433
03:04:51,590 --> 03:04:52,990
F5.

2434
03:04:55,990 --> 03:04:56,690
F5.

2435
03:04:56,970 --> 03:04:58,050
There we go.

2436
03:05:03,830 --> 03:05:05,230
This

2437
03:05:15,620 --> 03:05:19,320
game is so evil sometimes.

2438
03:05:19,720 --> 03:05:23,460
This game is so evil sometimes!

2439
03:05:23,460 --> 03:05:24,400
Sometimes!

2440
03:05:38,320 --> 03:05:40,980
Wait, it just disappeared.

2441
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:42,440
Hold on.

2442
03:05:44,680 --> 03:05:45,660
OK, I got you.

2443
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:49,980
My hands are so sweaty.

2444
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:54,360
I don't remember.

2445
03:05:54,500 --> 03:05:56,220
Oh yeah, there was the bing bong bing.

2446
03:05:56,680 --> 03:05:57,900
With the giant bing bell.

2447
03:05:58,980 --> 03:06:00,000
And then that was the end.

2448
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,500
Yeah, I was so close to the end before.

2449
03:06:01,580 --> 03:06:02,620
That's right, I remember.

2450
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:09,640
OK.

2451
03:06:19,550 --> 03:06:20,590
Position yourself.

2452
03:06:21,230 --> 03:06:21,530
Alright.

2453
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:16,480
I think it's in my depth perception acting up again.

2454
03:07:25,770 --> 03:07:28,930
This game is killer for my depth perception, honestly.

2455
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:33,070
OK.

2456
03:07:33,070 --> 03:07:33,290
OK.

2457
03:07:37,650 --> 03:07:38,090
Please.

2458
03:07:38,230 --> 03:07:38,890
OK, thank goodness.

2459
03:07:39,090 --> 03:07:40,010
That was so close.

2460
03:07:41,610 --> 03:07:41,970
Alright.

2461
03:07:44,230 --> 03:07:44,670
Yes!

2462
03:07:44,670 --> 03:07:45,590
Somehow I made it.

2463
03:07:49,010 --> 03:07:50,790
I think it's just a big hitbox.

2464
03:07:50,870 --> 03:07:51,530
I think so too.

2465
03:07:51,670 --> 03:07:54,690
I wonder if having the dog on my back adds to it.

2466
03:07:54,750 --> 03:07:56,170
Because I definitely hit the button there.

2467
03:07:57,330 --> 03:07:59,830
He just didn't thrust fast enough.

2468
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:24,100
I'm so nervous.

2469
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:26,820
I'm so nervous.

2470
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:32,380
OK, next one.

2471
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:40,780
Oh shoot.

2472
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:43,060
Oh my god.

2473
03:08:43,500 --> 03:08:44,220
There's another one?

2474
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:50,200
Holy cow!

2475
03:08:54,220 --> 03:08:55,900
Oh my god!

2476
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:04,620
I'm so sweaty.

2477
03:09:04,620 --> 03:09:08,700
I can't wait to take a shower after this.

2478
03:09:11,060 --> 03:09:11,860
Holy cow.

2479
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:12,740
Hold on, I need a sippy.

2480
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:28,170
Yeah, pray to Astro Snake.

2481
03:09:28,690 --> 03:09:30,390
Alright, we just got these three guys left.

2482
03:09:33,110 --> 03:09:35,110
I'm going to mess it up somehow, I know it.

2483
03:09:36,390 --> 03:09:36,790
OK.

2484
03:09:43,580 --> 03:09:44,640
They can't reach here.

2485
03:09:46,680 --> 03:09:49,400
But just in case, I'm going to stand on the corner because I'm scared.

2486
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:53,300
Hi Astro Bot, please stop waving at me and turn around.

2487
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:54,320
Thank you.

2488
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:55,340
Can you turn around?

2489
03:09:55,980 --> 03:09:56,620
Can you turn around?

2490
03:09:56,720 --> 03:09:57,140
Thank you.

2491
03:10:03,270 --> 03:10:06,530
Then as soon as I get to the second platform...

2492
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:11,620
The bigger guy is going to wake up.

2493
03:10:12,820 --> 03:10:14,080
So I have to be careful.

2494
03:10:22,020 --> 03:10:25,020
Sorry, I'm just seeing how... I wonder if I can run to the edge.

2495
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:26,320
OK.

2496
03:10:26,580 --> 03:10:27,660
Next one.

2497
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:39,160
Sorry,

2498
03:10:47,130 --> 03:10:47,950
I can't reach out right now.

2499
03:10:48,050 --> 03:10:49,430
I'm sorry, thank you for the super chat.

2500
03:10:50,210 --> 03:10:51,390
Thank you for the super chat!

2501
03:10:51,590 --> 03:10:52,710
I can't read it right now though.

2502
03:10:53,010 --> 03:10:53,990
I really gotta concentrate.

2503
03:11:19,580 --> 03:11:20,900
I don't know how I lived.

2504
03:11:27,300 --> 03:11:30,160
I forgot he flipped upside down.

2505
03:11:37,440 --> 03:11:42,600
I was too concentrated on staying alive from the...

2506
03:11:46,400 --> 03:11:50,500
I was too concentrated on staying alive from the...

2507
03:11:55,460 --> 03:11:56,080
Shit.

2508
03:12:11,340 --> 03:12:12,300
OK.

2509
03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:13,740
We got this.

2510
03:12:14,120 --> 03:12:14,460
Maybe.

2511
03:12:15,080 --> 03:12:16,940
I can't say that or else I die.

2512
03:12:18,240 --> 03:12:19,000
Please.

2513
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:05,680
That's... No.

2514
03:13:05,900 --> 03:13:07,180
That's actually evil.

2515
03:13:07,640 --> 03:13:08,200
What?

2516
03:13:09,060 --> 03:13:10,100
I was there!

2517
03:13:11,100 --> 03:13:11,820
What?

2518
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:15,240
That's so evil.

2519
03:13:15,740 --> 03:13:17,340
There was no way I could avoid that.

2520
03:13:19,660 --> 03:13:21,400
The game is cheating!

2521
03:13:40,890 --> 03:13:41,970
We made it.

2522
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:02,820
Game is cheating.

2523
03:14:05,700 --> 03:14:06,960
Game is cheating.

2524
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:09,540
Why did it do that to me?

2525
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:12,340
Why did it do that to me?

2526
03:14:48,350 --> 03:14:50,950
Guys, don't talk about keeping a timer.

2527
03:14:51,450 --> 03:14:53,850
It's not motivating at all.

2528
03:14:56,630 --> 03:14:57,350
Anyone

2529
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:11,340
who was here earlier, I went and did some other levels.

2530
03:15:12,780 --> 03:15:15,760
So maybe you saw that.

2531
03:15:19,070 --> 03:15:22,130
Or you saw me do it.

2532
03:15:22,610 --> 03:15:24,830
And then I went and did some other levels.

2533
03:15:25,890 --> 03:15:27,210
And then...

2534
03:15:50,180 --> 03:15:50,900
Oops.

2535
03:15:51,060 --> 03:15:52,780
I ran right into the log.

2536
03:15:57,680 --> 03:15:59,340
I wasn't trying to dunk on you.

2537
03:15:59,520 --> 03:15:59,960
It's OK.

2538
03:16:00,300 --> 03:16:01,500
It's a hard level.

2539
03:16:02,400 --> 03:16:04,000
And I have been on it for a long time.

2540
03:16:05,040 --> 03:16:06,520
Because I'm bad at games.

2541
03:16:16,270 --> 03:16:19,850
I think I'm just coping myself too.

2542
03:16:20,990 --> 03:16:23,090
I'm like, I did other levels you guys.

2543
03:16:24,190 --> 03:16:24,790
Don't you know?

2544
03:16:25,510 --> 03:16:27,050
I haven't been on this the entire...

2545
03:16:27,050 --> 03:16:27,310
What?

2546
03:16:27,890 --> 03:16:28,090
What?

2547
03:16:28,350 --> 03:16:28,510
What?

2548
03:16:41,260 --> 03:16:44,780
I think if I saw the world record for this, I might throw up.

2549
03:16:59,930 --> 03:17:09,810
I feel like I need to speedrun this part.

2550
03:17:10,250 --> 03:17:14,850
Actually, this level isn't even that fast... or fast... that long.

2551
03:17:14,850 --> 03:17:20,810
I think it's just got so much... I don't know.

2552
03:17:21,010 --> 03:17:28,310
I have no idea what makes this level feel longer than the rest.

2553
03:17:31,090 --> 03:17:32,070
I don't know.

2554
03:17:34,770 --> 03:17:37,950
I don't think it's so much longer than the others.

2555
03:17:42,400 --> 03:17:43,620
It is longer?

2556
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,160
It is?

2557
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:44,780
You think so?

2558
03:17:46,380 --> 03:17:46,860
OK.

2559
03:17:55,780 --> 03:17:57,040
Astro Bot is still having fun.

2560
03:17:57,120 --> 03:17:57,980
That's all that matters, right?

2561
03:17:59,300 --> 03:18:00,320
He's like, woohoo!

2562
03:18:01,060 --> 03:18:02,920
It doesn't matter how many times I die!

2563
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:06,120
I'm not the one who gets to suffer for it!

2564
03:19:08,720 --> 03:19:10,100
So I know what's happening.

2565
03:19:11,220 --> 03:19:14,360
It's thinking that I'm reaching...

2566
03:19:14,360 --> 03:19:16,140
The third platform.

2567
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:17,820
So...

2568
03:19:18,640 --> 03:19:19,120
OK.

2569
03:19:19,660 --> 03:19:20,700
So this is the middle.

2570
03:19:21,060 --> 03:19:21,980
And these are the platforms.

2571
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:23,560
Right?

2572
03:19:24,240 --> 03:19:25,880
And it's like...

2573
03:19:25,880 --> 03:19:26,260
OK.

2574
03:19:26,440 --> 03:19:27,800
I go from here and I...

2575
03:19:27,800 --> 03:19:29,820
And then the thing comes and I...

2576
03:19:29,820 --> 03:19:32,220
And then you're supposed to go to the one with the...

2577
03:19:32,220 --> 03:19:35,460
This is the platform with the bounce.

2578
03:19:37,020 --> 03:19:40,040
It's thinking I'm landing here and it's spawning another thing.

2579
03:19:43,180 --> 03:19:44,300
But like...

2580
03:19:45,100 --> 03:19:46,480
The game is bad!

2581
03:19:48,940 --> 03:19:50,300
The game is bad!

2582
03:19:51,560 --> 03:19:53,500
Because... Why would you have... Why would you...

2583
03:19:54,220 --> 03:19:56,300
Make the threshold like here?

2584
03:20:24,730 --> 03:20:26,670
I'm gonna reset the timer on these guys.

2585
03:20:53,230 --> 03:20:55,590
I don't wanna do what I did before.

2586
03:20:55,710 --> 03:20:57,050
I wish I could've...

2587
03:20:57,050 --> 03:21:00,970
Do the... I wish I could do what I originally did when I first got past that because...

2588
03:21:01,610 --> 03:21:03,290
I only had to go...

2589
03:21:03,290 --> 03:21:05,010
Against the two of them.

2590
03:21:06,310 --> 03:21:06,890
But...

2591
03:21:06,890 --> 03:21:10,010
When I accidentally messed it up before...

2592
03:21:10,850 --> 03:21:13,220
It was on accident so I don't even know what I did...

2593
03:21:13,770 --> 03:21:16,250
To get past all of those guys.

2594
03:21:37,710 --> 03:21:39,490
I feel like I'm valid here.

2595
03:21:39,650 --> 03:21:42,490
Everybody who's saying I'm coping, you're going to wrong.

2596
03:21:43,170 --> 03:21:44,790
I think I'm valid here.

2597
03:21:47,010 --> 03:21:50,750
No enemy should spawn where you...

2598
03:21:50,750 --> 03:21:52,190
Where you spawn.

2599
03:21:52,190 --> 03:21:54,090
Oh shit.

2600
03:21:54,570 --> 03:21:55,290
There we go.

2601
03:21:58,570 --> 03:21:59,970
I think I'm valid here.

2602
03:22:07,700 --> 03:22:10,020
You can make fun of all my other shortcomings.

2603
03:22:10,660 --> 03:22:12,520
And how bad I am at everything else.

2604
03:22:13,100 --> 03:22:14,460
Trust me, I already know.

2605
03:22:17,360 --> 03:22:17,800
See?

2606
03:22:21,550 --> 03:22:23,330
Why is it doing it now though?

2607
03:22:23,370 --> 03:22:24,190
It never did it before!

2608
03:22:25,050 --> 03:22:26,490
I don't think it's on a timer.

2609
03:22:26,770 --> 03:22:28,990
Because otherwise it would keep spawning like right here.

2610
03:22:30,530 --> 03:22:31,130
I

2611
03:22:34,710 --> 03:22:36,650
don't think... Game is bad.

2612
03:22:44,730 --> 03:22:46,870
That part is really poorly designed.

2613
03:22:49,450 --> 03:22:51,450
That part is so poorly designed.

2614
03:22:58,310 --> 03:22:59,830
Turn around, Astro Bot.

2615
03:23:00,010 --> 03:23:00,450
Turn around.

2616
03:23:00,830 --> 03:23:03,090
Turn your little body around.

2617
03:23:03,150 --> 03:23:03,550
There we go.

2618
03:23:08,370 --> 03:23:09,570
Oh shit.

2619
03:23:34,790 --> 03:23:37,090
I don't want to play anymore.

2620
03:23:43,820 --> 03:23:46,780
But I know I'll feel worse if I stop now.

2621
03:23:49,360 --> 03:23:52,120
I'll be even more frustrated if I stop now.

2622
03:24:38,240 --> 03:24:39,300
I'm suffering.

2623
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:41,440
This dog is suffering through so much abuse.

2624
03:24:42,380 --> 03:24:43,580
So am I, so...

2625
03:24:50,840 --> 03:24:51,940
Abuse from the game.

2626
03:24:52,500 --> 03:24:53,500
Abuse from my child.

2627
03:24:59,480 --> 03:25:01,460
I forgot about the dog.

2628
03:25:02,020 --> 03:25:03,140
He's right there!

2629
03:25:03,220 --> 03:25:04,160
How could you forget about him?

2630
03:25:23,630 --> 03:25:24,190
See?

2631
03:25:24,530 --> 03:25:25,190
See?

2632
03:25:25,590 --> 03:25:26,050
See?

2633
03:25:26,870 --> 03:25:27,390
Why?

2634
03:25:27,750 --> 03:25:28,410
Why?

2635
03:25:28,910 --> 03:25:29,370
Why?

2636
03:25:30,210 --> 03:25:32,690
Why didn't it do it this time?

2637
03:25:33,110 --> 03:25:34,630
I don't understand!

2638
03:25:38,150 --> 03:25:41,050
The game is... This part is so poorly programmed!

2639
03:26:02,740 --> 03:26:03,220
Okay.

2640
03:26:04,700 --> 03:26:07,860
I want to see if maybe I can get them a little bit more out of sync.

2641
03:26:09,940 --> 03:26:10,600
Oh shit.

2642
03:26:10,940 --> 03:26:11,440
Oh shit!

2643
03:26:27,490 --> 03:26:31,830
I can't even make it to the part that I'm most afraid of.

2644
03:26:33,070 --> 03:26:34,210
You know what?

2645
03:26:34,290 --> 03:26:34,810
It's fine.

2646
03:26:34,810 --> 03:26:36,190
Goodbye slime.

2647
03:26:37,150 --> 03:26:38,830
You get to live another day!

2648
03:26:39,270 --> 03:26:40,230
Lucky you, huh?

2649
03:26:41,530 --> 03:26:42,710
Lucky you!

2650
03:26:45,710 --> 03:26:47,910
You get to live another day!

2651
03:27:01,340 --> 03:27:02,440
Oh shit.

2652
03:27:02,760 --> 03:27:03,200
There we go.

2653
03:27:03,640 --> 03:27:04,480
Holy moly.

2654
03:27:10,900 --> 03:27:12,100
I'm waiting.

2655
03:27:12,400 --> 03:27:14,460
Oh my gosh, I have to keep wiping off my hands.

2656
03:27:23,160 --> 03:27:24,900
It's nonsensical to me.

2657
03:27:26,720 --> 03:27:27,400
Okay.

2658
03:27:31,200 --> 03:27:32,700
Back to where we were.

2659
03:27:33,780 --> 03:27:35,220
Too much ectoplasm!

2660
03:27:39,670 --> 03:27:40,350
Thank you!

2661
03:27:50,640 --> 03:27:51,720
Okay, yeah.

2662
03:27:51,900 --> 03:27:52,800
Mom's spaghetti.

2663
03:27:53,140 --> 03:27:54,120
I wish I had some spaghetti.

2664
03:27:56,500 --> 03:27:57,680
Okay, alright.

2665
03:28:03,190 --> 03:28:05,090
Sorry, I'm getting nervous again.

2666
03:28:11,280 --> 03:28:14,460
I'm also watching the platform and how much he twists and turns.

2667
03:28:17,680 --> 03:28:19,460
Oh no, they're starting to get back in sync!

2668
03:28:33,960 --> 03:28:34,800
One down!

2669
03:28:38,870 --> 03:28:41,190
Okay, the big guy can't reach here just yet.

2670
03:28:43,870 --> 03:28:45,430
Yeah, he can't reach here just yet.

2671
03:28:45,670 --> 03:28:48,990
Yeah, I remember the tipping.

2672
03:28:49,630 --> 03:28:51,110
The tipping, I remember.

2673
03:28:52,510 --> 03:28:54,130
I just don't know how to...

2674
03:28:56,890 --> 03:28:58,850
Sorry, I know I'm taking so much time.

2675
03:29:00,470 --> 03:29:01,830
And I'm so scared!

2676
03:29:03,370 --> 03:29:04,670
What's the depth perception?

2677
03:29:06,550 --> 03:29:08,190
It's really bad with the bells.

2678
03:29:11,990 --> 03:29:13,110
Okay, next one.

2679
03:29:19,130 --> 03:29:20,510
Okay, we're good!

2680
03:29:29,670 --> 03:29:30,690
I saved it!

2681
03:29:30,790 --> 03:29:31,130
I saved it!

2682
03:29:31,170 --> 03:29:31,530
I saved it!

2683
03:29:31,590 --> 03:29:32,370
I saved it!

2684
03:29:35,170 --> 03:29:35,770
Alright,

2685
03:29:39,350 --> 03:29:42,010
that thing switches quite often.

2686
03:29:43,570 --> 03:29:44,930
It flips over.

2687
03:29:49,130 --> 03:29:50,150
Quite often.

2688
03:29:55,200 --> 03:29:56,240
I'm scared!

2689
03:29:59,800 --> 03:30:01,680
Wait for it to shake before you go.

2690
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:03,120
Maybe...

2691
03:30:05,900 --> 03:30:07,720
Okay, go when it starts shaking.

2692
03:30:08,540 --> 03:30:11,000
But I'm so worried about this.

2693
03:30:11,800 --> 03:30:13,000
I can't pay attention.

2694
03:30:38,220 --> 03:30:39,600
Get me out of here.

2695
03:30:44,750 --> 03:30:48,130
I completed all five.

2696
03:30:48,130 --> 03:30:49,350
What the...

2697
03:30:53,500 --> 03:30:54,220
Thank

2698
03:31:00,770 --> 03:31:19,070
you, Fortnite.

2699
03:31:19,870 --> 03:31:20,710
Thank you, Fortnite.

2700
03:31:24,990 --> 03:31:26,290
You did it.

2701
03:31:26,310 --> 03:31:27,210
I did it.

2702
03:31:27,730 --> 03:31:28,690
Great thrusting.

2703
03:31:28,970 --> 03:31:29,630
Thank you.

2704
03:31:29,990 --> 03:31:32,110
Before we quit...

2705
03:31:33,370 --> 03:31:36,050
Wasn't there an area I forgot to do?

2706
03:31:36,690 --> 03:31:37,630
Was it here?

2707
03:31:38,550 --> 03:31:39,210
Hold on.

2708
03:31:39,290 --> 03:31:39,970
What's the map?

2709
03:31:41,830 --> 03:31:42,590
Never mind.

2710
03:31:42,870 --> 03:31:44,170
No, never mind.

2711
03:31:44,290 --> 03:31:44,810
I did it.

2712
03:31:46,370 --> 03:31:48,490
It's just this one last one.

2713
03:31:49,090 --> 03:31:49,470
You know what?

2714
03:31:49,490 --> 03:31:52,710
Now that I'm all warmed up, let's go give it one little go.

2715
03:31:54,070 --> 03:31:56,630
Let's give it one go and see how we do.

2716
03:32:01,510 --> 03:32:03,430
No, I didn't do all the secret levels.

2717
03:32:03,550 --> 03:32:04,010
It's fine.

2718
03:32:04,330 --> 03:32:06,250
I don't need to be a completionist.

2719
03:32:06,250 --> 03:32:06,810
It's alright.

2720
03:32:08,690 --> 03:32:09,610
It's fine.

2721
03:32:10,230 --> 03:32:11,270
Thank you, Ducky.

2722
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:14,110
I got a message.

2723
03:32:14,290 --> 03:32:15,490
I want your Touhou Shikishi too.

2724
03:32:16,190 --> 03:32:16,430
What?

2725
03:32:16,770 --> 03:32:17,810
You guys are too lucky.

2726
03:32:22,510 --> 03:32:22,990
Congratulations!

2727
03:32:28,120 --> 03:32:28,900
No, no, no.

2728
03:32:28,940 --> 03:32:30,720
I'm not going to try to complete this.

2729
03:32:31,500 --> 03:32:32,700
It's OK if I fail.

2730
03:32:32,700 --> 03:32:33,200
Yeah.

2731
03:32:38,320 --> 03:32:40,560
We're in the credits now of the game.

2732
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:48,620
Climbing all the people.

2733
03:32:51,660 --> 03:32:53,080
But I'm all warmed up now, no?

2734
03:32:54,340 --> 03:32:55,860
I might be pretty good at this.

2735
03:32:56,100 --> 03:32:57,160
Oh shit, never mind.

2736
03:33:04,450 --> 03:33:05,390
How did I do that?

2737
03:33:12,370 --> 03:33:13,670
I might be better at this than I thought.

2738
03:33:14,530 --> 03:33:16,670
Oh wait, I need to... Never mind.

2739
03:33:16,950 --> 03:33:17,370
I give up.

2740
03:33:19,730 --> 03:33:20,870
I give up!

2741
03:33:22,350 --> 03:33:24,270
Oh, now you don't want to fall off the edge.

2742
03:33:24,690 --> 03:33:29,550
Oh, but sometimes when I do this in the other level, you would just be like, oh I'm going to fall.

2743
03:33:29,850 --> 03:33:31,850
Oh no, now you don't want to fall off the edge, huh?

2744
03:33:32,730 --> 03:33:34,150
Is it scary Astro Bot?

2745
03:33:34,530 --> 03:33:35,250
Is it scary?

2746
03:33:36,470 --> 03:33:37,690
Wow, it's so pretty.

2747
03:33:40,290 --> 03:33:42,130
The shapes are talking to me.

2748
03:33:50,510 --> 03:33:53,390
I might be better at this than I thought, guys.

2749
03:33:54,310 --> 03:33:55,110
Classic Minto.

2750
03:33:56,330 --> 03:33:57,670
Classic Minto tactic.

2751
03:34:01,270 --> 03:34:05,370
Classic Minto confidence and death tactic.

2752
03:34:15,970 --> 03:34:19,190
I have to time this one, but I don't remember how.

2753
03:34:19,370 --> 03:34:19,830
There we go.

2754
03:34:22,110 --> 03:34:23,250
Can I jump through here?

2755
03:34:23,370 --> 03:34:23,690
Yeah!

2756
03:34:30,830 --> 03:34:31,970
Oh, I'm dead.

2757
03:34:34,090 --> 03:34:35,050
OK, I give up.

2758
03:34:36,270 --> 03:34:36,790
I give up.

2759
03:34:37,390 --> 03:34:37,910
I'm tired.

2760
03:34:38,650 --> 03:34:38,970
Leave!

2761
03:34:39,110 --> 03:34:39,870
No hotdog!

2762
03:34:40,310 --> 03:34:42,270
Oh, thank you for a hotdog Raichu.

2763
03:34:43,270 --> 03:34:44,590
Looking for a spooky dino.

2764
03:34:46,750 --> 03:34:48,550
That was all you Minto could give me.

2765
03:34:49,030 --> 03:34:49,910
Thank you!

2766
03:34:50,510 --> 03:34:52,410
And here, we are in space.

2767
03:34:58,130 --> 03:34:58,610
Space.

2768
03:35:00,130 --> 03:35:01,370
Are all my guys still there?

2769
03:35:01,730 --> 03:35:02,770
No, they left me here.

2770
03:35:02,910 --> 03:35:04,410
They left me here to die!

2771
03:35:05,670 --> 03:35:07,690
They said you'll never come back Astro Bot.

2772
03:35:13,150 --> 03:35:14,530
Thank you guys!

2773
03:35:14,790 --> 03:35:16,410
We did the secret...

2774
03:35:16,410 --> 03:35:17,530
Not secret, sorry.

2775
03:35:17,610 --> 03:35:20,510
We did the extra levels and I...

2776
03:35:20,510 --> 03:35:22,450
I'm done with Astro Bot.

2777
03:35:24,730 --> 03:35:25,510
That's it.

2778
03:35:26,190 --> 03:35:27,270
I'm good now.

2779
03:35:28,050 --> 03:35:29,530
I've done all that I wanted to do.

2780
03:35:29,630 --> 03:35:30,790
I've collected all that...

2781
03:35:30,790 --> 03:35:36,470
Honestly, I could have stopped at all the metal gears, but we did more.

2782
03:35:47,170 --> 03:35:49,250
Toad bust, but she can thrust.

2783
03:35:50,210 --> 03:35:51,850
I have a little bit there.

2784
03:35:54,330 --> 03:35:55,270
Nice fight though.

2785
03:35:57,810 --> 03:36:01,050
We thrusted and busted till we finished baby!

2786
03:36:02,050 --> 03:36:03,770
And that's the stream!

2787
03:36:04,550 --> 03:36:05,450
Otsuminto everybody!

2788
03:36:05,670 --> 03:36:06,570
Thank you so much for watching!

2789
03:36:06,750 --> 03:36:07,750
Thanks for hanging out with me!

2790
03:36:09,130 --> 03:36:11,150
I'll see you guys when I see you next!

2791
03:36:11,150 --> 03:36:12,850
Otsuminto byebye!

2792
03:36:15,690 --> 03:36:17,090
