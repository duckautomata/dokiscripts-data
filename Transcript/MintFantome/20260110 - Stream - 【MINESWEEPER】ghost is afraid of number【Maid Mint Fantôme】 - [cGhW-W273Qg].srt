00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:16,620
And I also feel like it's not it's not impressive if I don't
beat it on expert.

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,500
We're gonna we're gonna do it, baby.

19

Your time is ticking?

24
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,800
Are you trying to say that I might, that I need to have a
baby right now?

25
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,120
Because that's usually what that means when you say that to
a lady.

26
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,070
The corner or the timer in the corner?

27
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,130
Oh, yeah.

28
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,970
Last week, it took about 45 minutes to try and solve one of
these bad boys.

29
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,830
You know, Mind Sweeper is not for the week, I think.

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,270
Happy Friday, Minto.

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm sure you and Doki are very proud.

37
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,060
Hmm.

38
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I don't think Doki is proud of anybody.

39
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,220
You're a blast to watch?

40
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,300
A blast to watch, Min.

41
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,960
You put that boo in.

42
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,760

45
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,540
So, Gamer Sups will send me, like, free stuff, right?

46
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,300
Like, I had to tell them that I couldn't take any more of
their, like, actual merch, which is very nice that they

47
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,540
send.

48
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,780
Every time they do a drop, they send something.

49
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,900
So if it's, like, they send, like, all of the stuff, too.

50
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,680
Like, all the new flavors to me, and also, all of the...

51
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:40,560
like if there's like clothes or whatever the set comes with
it's it's it's i had to tell them though i have no more

52
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:57,320
space please don't send me anything else i have the amount
of cups i got was insane but but um uh still still send me

53
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:07,740
like the the like i said the flavors and things or if they
come out with a new product and um they came out with

54
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:21,000
something hold on what was it I think I uh they literally
told me this today gamer raid and so they had sent me some

55
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:35,740
gamer raid but um so I use like a like a forwarding service
right for like all my mail because you know i'm i'm safe

56
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:51,580
like that but um before the gamer raid they sent me like
cans of cans uh of some of the stuff that they had i

57
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:58,520
couldn't have it because it's carbonated but um um

58
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:10,920
you know cans are quite heavy right and so is apparently
this gamer aid because whenever i need to ship it from my

59
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:24,660
forwarding service to me uh the shipping is over a hundred
dollars and sometimes it would be like that um with the with

60
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,840
the merch as well and i was like and it was like almost
monthly that i was getting this stuff and i was like oh my

61
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,920
god i'm spending $100 to ship it all to me.

62
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,700
Anytime you're moving water around, it's gotta be heavy.

63
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm like, oh, no.

64
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,540
No.

65
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,060
The most expensive free stuff.

66
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,620
I know.

67
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,200
She doesn't know that's how much we pay for it.

68
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,400
That's not.

69
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,080
You shouldn't be.

70
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:14,840

Scruff on Loop What is that?

73
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:37,060
That's how I feel Buying anything off AmiYami now I had to,
I had to forego some orders.

74
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:45,320
I had to be like, because one of the things that I got from
the Metal Gear pre-order, Metal Gear Delta pre-order, was

75
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,080
the Ami Ami exclusive was a skateboard deck.

76
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,280
And I had this stuff.

77
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,140
Actually, I didn't even check what the shipping was.

78
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,140
I was too scared.

79
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,240
I was a pet man, thank you.

80
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,300
I had some sample packets sitting around an order and
genuinely of a surprise that it was pretty good.

81
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,080
Yeah, it's pretty good.

82
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,280
17 months.

83
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,020
Crimson Dhaka!

84
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,160
No, I'm just kidding.

85
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm always...

86
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,880
I live in a populous USA city.

87
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,760
Two cans of subs is $80 before shipping.

88
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,540
What's a populous?

89
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,680
Like a popular city?

90
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:52,980
I live in the popular city which starts at like 11 dollars
use them creator codes people wait where is that what's the

91
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:08,700
popular city why is it so expensive the shipping I just want
a fat amount at a casino game let's go Walter why mind if I

92
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,760

95
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,900
Happy New Year.

96
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,900
You're not late at all.

97
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,900
It's only the 9th.

98
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,860
Happy New Year!

99
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,080
You know what's crazy too?

100
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,440
I thought about...

101
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,840
Not only just, I guess shipping is expensive, but also plane
tickets have been so expensive.

102
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,420
I was like, I think I'll...

103
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
You guys, I was gonna do it.

104
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,700
I was gonna take a weekend and I was gonna go to Disney and
I was gonna go ride dinosaur one more time because I just

105
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:59,260
couldn't fathom not riding it ever again and I looked up
plane tickets to Orlando 500 I'm on the east coast mind you

106
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,100
500 dollars USD

107
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,820
So, uh, needless to say.

108
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,640
And that's before Disney tickets, before hotel, anything.

109
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,800
I was, I was appalled and disgusted.

110
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,120
I was like, you, you can't, you can't, you can't do this.

111
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,060
That's a robbery.

112
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,980
I'm on the East Coast.

113
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,420
That's like just a couple of hours.

114
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:54,340
hours oh my god is that cheap no it's usually like half that
or more sometimes craziness you didn't want to drive i

115
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:04,600
didn't want to be gone from streaming for so long i was like
i don't want to i wanted it to really be like a quick thing

116
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,380
like in and out boom boom I go ride it.

117
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,880
I go back home.

118
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,400
I was like, you know, I'm ready to, you know, I just wanted
to go say bye to it.

119
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,580
But man, oh, $500.

120
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:29,780
That's like flying to the West Coast, which is like a very,
like five hours from the East Coast.

121
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,760
It's craziness.

122
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,280
Craziness.

123
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,480
And I've never done like a road trip.

124
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,420

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,330
What's going on in Orlando?

169
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:50,070
oh my god while i was there though okay while i was there
you guys i learned about the pop tart bowl which i first

170
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:57,010
thought was a pop tart convention i was like do i need to
extend my dates so that i can go to the pop tart convention

171
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:04,950
and try a bunch of different kinds of pop tarts no don't be
fooled it's football but but hold on it's college football

172
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:21,470
but but it's not just any football you guys there are okay
it's like a cult i learned this you first there are pop-tart

173
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:32,670
mascots right there are pop-tart mascots the game begins the
game begins with them honoring the former pop-tart from last

174
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:43,910
year's pop-tart bowl okay and then at the end the chosen
pop-tart the winning pop tart gets sacrificed into an omega

175
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:54,430
giant huge it's a it's i was about to say live size but a
live size toaster would just be a regular size toaster no no

176
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:05,050
no it is a massive toaster that they sacrifice the pop tarts
fall into and then it cooks into a giant pop tart and i

177
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:12,190
don't know what they do with it i don't think everybody gets
one but I would be kind of fun if you get a little piece of

178
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,210
the giant pop-tart and he can eat it.

179
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,870
And that's the pop-tart bowl.

180
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,490
And at first I was like, ah, man, it's football.

181
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,590
Yuck.

182
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,050
I thought it was going to be a pop-tart convention, but no.

183
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,670
Now I feel like I should have gone so that I could see the
sacrifice of the pop-tart.

184
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,350
As long as the winning pop-tart is always brown sugar
cinnamon, we're good.

185
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,310
No, Oreo, Oreo, Oreo, Oreo, Oreo, cookie, cream, cookie.

186
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:55,350
cream finally a way to make football interesting you should
go we should go to the pop-tart bowl next year we should go

187
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:03,090
I actually don't like pop-tarts that much but I was very
excited about the idea of like a convention that was when I

188
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,930
was in Florida for holiday Matsuri I was like man what is
America doing sometimes I wonder.

189
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,710
It's kind of fun, though, no?

190
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,410
And then the Pop-Tarts are out there.

191
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,430
Like all the people in the Pop-Tart mascots are out there
and they're being silly, goofy.

192
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,130
And then one gets killed and eaten and devoured in front of
the masses.

193
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:33,990
That's a modern day, like, you know, they used to do an
execution in, like, the courtyard of little towns.

194
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,850
That's a modern day execution, now, isn't it?

195
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,390
They're like beheading?

196
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,370
No, no.

197
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,210
We cook them now.

198
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,930
That Pop-Tart's going straight into the toast.

199
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,150
So strange.

200
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,630
The Pop-Tart's bowl and the Duke's Mayo Bowl.

201
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,590
Maybe a less yummy food made sure people had a good time.

202
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:02,870
What?

203
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,310
I've never heard of the Mayo Bowl.

204
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,670
That sounds terrible.

205
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,090
You missed your opportunity to complete the ritual.

206
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,870
No!

207
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,780
I had a dream.

208
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,260
I had a dream the other night that...

209
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,940
That...

210
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,260
Oh, what was it now?

211
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,920
What was it?

212
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,120
Uh...

213
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,690
That like a party.

214
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,310
Oh, I remember!

215
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:54,930
I was I was a ballet I was a ballerina and I got chosen to
be the lead ballerina in a dance in like a in a performance

216
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:03,270
and I was like yippee so I held a party and someone that
came to the party was like okay do you guys remember there's

217
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,630

little boy that like is basically god and can control

218
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:21,270
everything and so everyone bends to his will make him upset
it was basically that this this girl comes to my party and

219
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:38,170
and and i'm like oh oh it's january 24th the 31st s j u m oh

220
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,850

221
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:56,210
um that episode yeah it was freaky right uh but um the
little girl like wanted something i don't remember what it

222
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:04,770
was and walter white was there from breaking bad and he was
like he was like i don't want to he him and his big old ego

223
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:15,110
his big old big stinking ego was like i don't want to do and
so she got really mad and she triggered the end of the world

224
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:24,950
and the end of the world all i was gonna do is be a
ballerina and walter white said that ain't happening and so

225
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:35,370
i remember being it was like like it was orange kind of like
the color grading in the breaking bad show right but thank

226
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:47,110
you for the super chat but um but it was like because it was
like you know know uh uh it was orange from all the fire um

227
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:56,070

and just kind of being like the world is ending the world is

228
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:11,950

don't think i was in mexico though i don't think so this one

229
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,850
should be safe

230
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:32,630

two are also not safe because of the two right so mine's

231
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:46,340
reaper dreams have meanings meanwhile dreams yeah They're
continuing Malcolm in the middle on Hulu.

232
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,920
Is he Malcolm in the front?

233
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,300
Malcolm in the back?

234
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,660
Does he ever get out of the middle?

235
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,160
Orange apocalypse.

236
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,200
What is Crimson One?

237
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,780
Read Twilight Zone.

238
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,560
A local TV mogul where I'm from had in his will that the
station he owned would have a Twilight Zone marathon when he

239
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,100
died.

240
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,820
Did they?

241
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,360
Did they?

242
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
Yeah, sorry, we're playing mine, Sweeper.

243
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,960
She's the middle child, so no.

244
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,000
We could change that.

245
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,020
We could change that.

246
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,260
I'm bored, gang, because I'm way behind.

247
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
But the thumbnail's amazing.

248
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,380
Thanks, Rooks!

249
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,280
See you later.

250
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,160
Whoa, whoa, sorry, did you hear that?

251
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,960
Sorry, that was my...

252
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,580
Sorry, I okay, I okay.

253
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,980
That was my headphones brushing against my mic.

254
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:56,920
Sorry.

255
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,960
Alrighty, alright, this one, not safe.

256
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,320
Okay, I should lock in, but I'm also just wanting to talk.

257
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,820
You can just click whatever?

258
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,780
Wow, wee!

259
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,020
That actually...

260
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:32,520
did me some good so these two and then this one very nice
clicking anything is actually maybe a valid strut i have

261
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,440
complete faith in you thank you

262
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:45,180
i'm a napling hanging out with you in the eyeballs because
i'm avoiding outer wild spoilers watching it earlier.

263
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,040
Wait, it shouldn't...

264
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,900
The video shouldn't still be going, right?

265
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,500
Before you go boom today, I have faith in you.

266
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,300
Can I borrow $5?

267
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,480
Thanks!

268
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
Why would you give me $5 then?

269
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,080
If you're wanting to borrow it.

270
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,490
Oh, it ended 20 minutes ago.

271
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,250
Yeah, that's what I thought.

272
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,810
The past Nimeo is so close.

273
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,990
The thing is, is I don't remember.

274
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:27,270
Like, I very vaguely remember things from the DLC so I'm
like I'm like oh because I played it I played it um but I'm

275
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:36,010
like her trying to figure out I'm watching her trying to
figure out things and I'm also like oh yeah how did you do

276
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:44,030
that oh yeah how was that supposed to be done you know I
can't remember

277
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,710
DLC is hard.

278
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,290
It was.

279
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,270
I remember.

280
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,070
I think she's really...

281
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,490
It's really impressive that she's playing it without chat
too.

282
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,410
Because for me, I would be like...

283
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,510
I'm like, hint!

284
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:05,950
Hint!

285
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,050
Help!

286
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,570
Help me!

287
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,550
Help!

288
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,970
Every game is really...

289
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:27,570
replayable if you forget everything exactly but there are
some things of outer wilds i think it's really the impact of

290
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:39,070
the ending with outer wilds you know what i mean and and
like especially the main game now that i know with like the

291
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:50,190
the fishies and stuff and you know whatever whatever It's
like Like That I don't think I'll ever forget You know And

292
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:57,530
so I'm like Yeah You know I could forget like How to do
certain tiny puzzles But

293
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:11,540
No spoilers I'm not giving spoilers I just said fishies
That's all And then also The ending of the DLC And

294
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:20,500
everything too Like I just feel like The ending sticks out
to me more than like all the little puzzles and the ending

295
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,720
is the most important part.

296
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,660
So...

297
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,840
That sounds fishy.

298
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,520
They're fishy on the bramble.

299
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,080
All you have to do is go into the bramble and you see them
immediately.

300
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,860
So...

301
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,420
Yeah.

302
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,440
Oh well.

303
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,500
Maybe, maybe in like 100 years I could replay it and be
like, oh yeah!

304
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh yeah!

305
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,960
Oh, I love Outer Wilds, I love it.

306
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,320
I'm gonna click here.

307
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Oh!

308
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,080
Guys!

309
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,080
I might be a genius.

310
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,020
Dan, Dan!

311
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,580
Holy luck.

312
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,380
It ain't luck, baby.

313
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:29,580
it's all skill it's all skill it's all up here in my noggin

314
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,260
you hear that that's the lucky coin i ate

315
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,500
yeah that's that lucky coin rattling around in there

316
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:56,940
let's see what else we got here we can do do this one, we
could do this one, we could do this one, we could do this

317
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,380
one.

318
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,380
I love corner ones.

319
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,380
Corner one, corner one.

320
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,700
I'm already at 79.

321
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,300
Let's go.

322
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,960
Careful, it might hit the brain cell.

323
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,280
What?

324
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,420
What brain cell?

325
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,760
What brain cell?

326
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,330
Still got one more corner one.

327
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:31,730
I do?

328
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,530
Oh, I see it.

329
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:32,910
Right here.

330
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,140
That's just the brains, though.

331
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,260
Let's see what else we got.

332
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,280
I will, I will lock in, because I do.

333
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,540
I want to beat this.

334
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,600
I do.

335
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,680
I want to beat Mind Sweeper.

336
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,100
That means this one's safe.

337
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,920
I like how the guy goes

338
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,590
And that means this one is safe.

339
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,810
This one is safe.

340
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,310
Yeah.

341
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,290
Which means it has to be that one.

342
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,890
She can be the...

343
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,490
I want to.

344
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,110
I want to.

345
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,730
I'll let R click on a number.

346
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,170
Reveal all unflagged squares around that number.

controversial take

359
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,290
It's a shortcut.

360
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,670
It lets you play fast.

361
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,990
Oh my god.

362
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,770
That's craziness.

363
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,690
She's starting to believe.

364
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,610
I know, I know, I am, I am.

365
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,850
I'm starting to believe.

366
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,470
But then sometimes I'm also...

367
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,190
The numbers.

368
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:13,400
narrative number 76 more minds to go but 76 but not the
opposite way around the other way around

369
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:28,580
i admit please i didn't say it so what else did i'm not as
brain-rodded as you guys i'm not as brain-rodded as you guys

370
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,000
it doesn't come to me so quickly when someone makes that You
know?

371
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,060
So the three can also be cleared.

372
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,740
Like so.

373
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,360
Right, because it can only touch one, two, three.

374
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,360
Right?

375
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,520
Right.

376
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,540
Ah, yeah, baby.

377
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,560
In that case, okay.

378
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,040
So then this one is safe.

379
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,660
Scary.

380
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,370
Still scary touching it though.

381
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,210
Which means that one is not safe.

382
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,600
One, two.

383
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,500
Safe.

384
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,040
Oh my gosh.

385
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,660
Crazy.

386
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,040
Why did it open up like that?

387
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,900
Why did it kind of scare me?

388
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,180
This one is safe.

389
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,860
Not safe.

390
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,760
Not safe.

391
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,380
Yeah.

392
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,540
Yeah.

394
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:53,720
Yeah.

395
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,540
There's so much happening.

396
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:57,980
Hold on.

397
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,460
What if I Beat it first try.

398
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,540
Wait, I think I just jinxed myself.

399
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,280
Welcome back, Gort.

400
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,220
Nice profile picture.

401
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,720
The Windows XP background is cracking me up.

402
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,860
Did you guys ever have, like, OS time?

403
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,040
Replace your sounds on, like, XP time.

404
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,280
Replace your sounds on your computer.

405
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,160
Okay.

406
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,400
A long time ago, yeah, me too!

407
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,500
Why can't we bring OS-Tan back?

408
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,620
Probably though, 11-Tan would be not great.

409
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,380
Me too, I'm just up as Asala on at Magfest this weekend.

410
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,960

412
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,720

At the same time...

422
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,520
Who would be Snake, though?

423
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,120

424
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,100

Wait, when are you going to be Snake?

434
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,470
But you're not marrying me.

435
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,970
You're marrying Evan.

436
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,970
Let's all make that very clear.

437
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,350

438
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,950
You are literally him.

Can I come to the wedding dressed as Naomi?

452
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,620
Only if you...

453
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,300
Wait.

454
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,300
Only if you interrupt it many times.

455
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,040
You have to be like...

456
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,480
You have to always make it about yourself.

457
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,720
Wait.

458
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,260
I kind of want to do like a costume, like a roleplay party.

459
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:24,000
not a role-playing party you know one thing I oh my gosh I
saw while I was in Orlando was a murder mystery like theater

460
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:34,300
dinner show and I've never done one of those before oh I
wanted to go so bad but I'm also nervous what if I'm the one

461
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:45,380
who dies and then I can't participate and then I'm just
laying there in my lake in my mesh And I'm like, ah, man.

462
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,280
You're already dead.

463
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,800
No, no.

464
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,300
I'm dead, like, for real.

465
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,140
But in the context of the murder mystery show, I'm supposed
to be alive, you know?

466
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,160
And then someone could kill me.

467
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,900
And I'm like, they're like, at any time I like try to eat my
food or something, they come up to me and they're like,

468
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,140
we're gonna.

469
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,240
You better close that mouth a little messy.

470
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,240
You are not finishing your food until we find this.

471
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,200
It's murder, okay.

472
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,460
They take it very seriously.

473
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,020
What song are you walking down the aisle to, Minto?

474
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,340
You know I've thought about this before.

475
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,510
Something Metal Gear.

476
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,990
Evan, are you okay?

477
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,130
How much did you drink tonight?

478
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,410
Twelve shots.

479
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,710
This time I had twelve shots.

480
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,450
You forgot the throw up emoji.

481
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:54,010
You would be over the toilet at that point, buddy.

482
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,670
Who will officiate a wedding for this MGS crew?

483
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:01,950
Campbell.

484
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,370
Sir, I'm dead for my day job, please.

485
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,930
Can I please be alive?

486
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,490
Can I please be alive?

487
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,150
I just want to taste.

488
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,510
I just want to taste.

489
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:17,870
I want to know the taste of what it feels like to be a
normal human girl.

490
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:36,220
for one day it's like that it's like that scene in Casper I
just I just want to feel the love I just want to feel

491
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:55,540
something okay I'm over I went to a charity murder mystery
dinner spaghetti dinner For a cat, oh my gosh, I want to be

492
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,360
getting so much right now.

493
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,580
For a cat shelter once, it was a fantastic overlap of
theater people and cat people.

494
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,140
10 out of 10 recommend attending murder mystery dinners are
fun.

495
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,080
But also, what if it's not a very popular location and
you're the only one in the crowd?

496
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,660
And they're like, well, this is awkward.

497
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,300
You're at the altar and when the grooms turn to say, I do,
he starts activating the optional code at conversation

498
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,960
instead.

499
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:32,280
it's just like do you take this what this this wait what did
they say do you take this ghost to be your lawfully wedded

500
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:41,400
wife and he says i'm going offline Michael welcome to my
bishop thank you

501
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:53,420
and Adonai welcome to my bishop thank you Yes, I do.

502
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,570
The whole ceremony is conducted via codec.

503
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:03,870
Oh my gosh, what if?

504
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:04,390
What if?

505
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,790
To get to the altar?

506
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,470
It was like a sneaking mission, right?

507
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,990
I have a friend called Cyberfishy.

508
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,930
I know Cyberfishy, who doesn't think she'll make it to
Off-Kai this year.

509
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,570
You're her kamiyoshi, can you tell her to lock in?

510
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,770
Wait, no, Cyberfishy!

511
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,930
I wanna see you.

512
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,150
I want to see you!

513
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:29,550
Please!

514
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:30,990
Come to Off-Kai!

515
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:36,870
There will be lots of Minto around, so...

516
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,490
Off-Kai is going to be full of Minto.

517
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,210
You got this!

518
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:40,670
You got this!

519
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:41,050
You got this!

520
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:41,850
You got this!

521
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,350
What if you got married on a field of white flowers?

522
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:50,150
And then I had to shoot the person I was marrying?

523
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,210
There can only be one married.

524
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:54,930
Wait.

525
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,630
One...

526
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,410
Uh...

527
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,950
There can only...

528
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:03,810
Oh...

529
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:05,950
Uh...

530
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:06,970
There...

531
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,570
Ah...

532
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:19,630
One spouse.

533
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,430
Minto, what if the dress is the box?

534
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,350
Well, you're just trying to get me in my cardboard dress
again.

535
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,750
I know what you guys are doing.

536
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,470
I know your game.

537
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:36,410
You're just trying to get me in in the cardboard dress
again.

538
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,370
Highlander MGS crossover.

539
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,570
Hey, hang, no.

540
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,170
Are you sure?

541
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:55,250
Are you sure about that?

542
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,090
This one, not safe.

543
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,630
I'm still playing the game, don't worry.

544
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,490
Safe.

545
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,530
I'm still playing.

546
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,030
Safe.

547
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,490
Pinto holds snake, holds Ocelot's hand while the background
plays the winner.

548
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,090
The winner takes it off.

549
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:29,230
Honestly, I chose Mind Sweeper today because I was also
like, I think I've just got a one.

550
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:35,990
Like I knew that with Mind Sweeper, I would just be able to
like yapp and have like just just kind of take it easy, so

551
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,510
that was also partially why I chose it.

552
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,130
Safe.

553
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,470
I think I'm understanding the game now.

554
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,630
Yes, I like the number.

555
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,850
Best way to show up to a wedding is either Halo Jump or via
One Man SDV.

556
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,030
Bride is OSP.

557
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:11,770
This is becoming more and more realistic like real like we
could really plan this i think oh my gosh though i think

558
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:23,470
actually like a a you know how like wedding planners are a
thing a wedding planner who specializes in doing video game

559
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:32,890
themed uh wedding ceremonies would be like like she has it
all planned out like what kind of cake you get what kind of

560
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:43,330
decorations you have because like like video game anime
themed weddings are like actually quite common I think it's

561
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:53,590
like I think I need to patent that I think I need to I think
I need to like get on that you'd be making Buku books I

562
00:51:53,590 --> 00:52:09,670
think there's a huge market for that you imagine having like
a super classy but also like super nerdy um Zelda, Zelda

563
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,590
themed wedding, you know?

564
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,650
Boo-Koo books, exactly!

565
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:23,310
I would like to thank Eating Mike Tyson's A-S-S.

566
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,670

572
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,470

both.

00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,090
Yeah, you might.

578
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,990

So, you know, believe it or not, I'm extremely, like, um,
talk deprived.

589
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,530

game anime themed wedding either way you are invited as the
bride

596
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:46,730
Wait a minute Is this Actually, have you guys heard about
this?

597
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:56,250
Like sometimes It's like, I think it's like an East Asian
Not common thing for sure, but I had a part time sometimes

598
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:11,310
Thank you Thank you so much But sometimes when like someone
when like someone passes away early like you know at a young

599
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:21,110
age like like you know say 19 for example sometimes the
parents will be like okay we're going to we're going to find

600
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:30,870
somebody that will marry my son or daughter's spirit so that
they the spirit can then feel fulfilled and move on

601
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,510
Have you guys ever heard of that before?

602
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,610
It's kind of depressing.

603
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,350
I thought that was an Asian thing.

604
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,770
Yeah, yeah, that's why I think.

605
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:53,730
I've heard of it in, like, East Asia, but I don't know if
it's...

606
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:56,790
I don't think it's very common, but it is a thing.

607
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,750
In your ghostly experience, does it ever work?

608
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,370
Well, like, I feel bad for the living person because...

609
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:15,310
it's like they have to like they have to like what's the
word be married to the person for like a certain amount of

610
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:24,150
time I think it's mostly though like psychics that like scam
people maybe I don't know I don't think I've ever been

611
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:34,650
married to a living person and then what am I supposed to do
when their time is up do I get a spiritual divorce I They

612
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,510
just...

613
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,510
What am I supposed to do?

614
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:47,520
I feel like the spirit should also get a say in this.

615
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,520
I feel like that too.

616
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,820
What if I really...

617
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,020
What if I'm like, hey, this person is...

618
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,280
I don't mean from scam psychics.

619
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,560
What if I'm like, oh gosh, this person's living situation is
horrible.

620
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,220
Like, they're disgusting.

621
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,700
Can't wait for the Minto lizard postings.

622
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,440
Dinosaur posting is pretty close.

623
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,720
Steal their soul, Yandere style, so they can't leave you.

624
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,620
Spiritual divorce is indeed a word I never thought I'd hear
today.

625
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,120
Yeah, well...

626
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,860
You never know.

627
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,200
Yeah, what about a prenup?

628
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,440
I don't know.

629
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,360
Do you need a prenup?

630
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,500
Divorce via Ouija board.

631
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,480
Do you want a divorce?

632
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,030
Little, the little planchette moves over to, yes.

633
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:56,740
I take the dog.

634
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,220
Planchette moves.

635
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,220
No.

636
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,840
Y-E-S-N-T.

637
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:07,780
Yes, it.

638
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:14,940
Then, you gotta really, you gotta, you gotta give an answer
that, like, will keep them on their toes.

639
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,740
Do you want a divorce?

640
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,520
Ouija board just spells out, I can change.

641
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,740
Do we need ghost lawyers?

642
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,380
Yeah, in that case, like, what if...

643
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,120
What if, like, the person that died, you know, obviously
they left behind things that they...

644
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:51,380
owned does this does the does the wife or the husband
whoever married the spirit do they then get the things very

645
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,390
very confusing this is getting complicated yeah

646
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:16,130
very very interesting hmm but i have i have heard stories of
like people being like I had a relationship with a ghost and

647
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:27,430
the ghost and I would be like we'd have me and ghost would
have funky funky time I've heard of that before and I say

648
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,090
it's fun being the Lulu maybe I think

649
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:42,450
consult the board this planchette driven marriage drama
brought to you by bro

650
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:51,590
this is weird why can't they marry Hatsune Miku like normal
people yeah or the Eiffel Tower

651
00:59:55,570 --> 01:00:04,350
people are so funny huh what the fuck is that what they're
calling it now funky funky time what else am I supposed to

652
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:13,830
call it they they do the bow chicka wow wow Maybe.

653
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,320

Oh, you're right.

660
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:54,830
You're right.

661
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,590

01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,550
Oh my gosh.

671
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:30,470
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

672
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,030
Wow!

673
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,040
You can do the four in the top left.

674
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,360
This way?

675
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,380
One, two, three, four.

676
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,100
Yes, we can.

677
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,860
It's just completely surrounded.

678
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,080
You're surrounded.

679
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,080
Put your hands up.

680
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:58,680
Bada-dang.

681
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,300
And now that I've had the chance to eat some food and drink
some water,

682
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,280
Evan, it's been like 10 minutes!

683
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,740
Evan!

684
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,160
What?

685
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,400
You haven't!

686
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,440
That quickly!

687
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,480
Thanks for the fun stream.

688
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,880
If time allows, I dare you!

689
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,940
To complete a minesweeper board without flagging any mines.

690
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,020
Maybe we could do that!

691
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,220
Okay.

692
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:44,460
Once I beat an expert one We'll try that We'll try that

693
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,440

01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,580
Here, I'll do one again.

698
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,940
Oh, wait, wait.

699
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,380
I'll do one again.

700
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,620
Oh, well, then.

701
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,620
This is expert.

702
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,260
I know.

703
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,640
Wait, did I say expert?

704
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:34,940
Wait, no, after I complete this one, we'll do it on like an
easy board, the easier board.

705
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,140

706
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,000
One, two.

707
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:41,420
Whoops.

708
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,330
I was answering the guy's question.

709
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,690
Oh, okay, sorry.

710
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,650
I didn't know.

711
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:06,370
Sometimes my brain moves very fast and I don't know if I
misspeak or something.

712
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,710
let's see

713
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:33,030
my brain my brain's always braining it's just braining
sometimes a little funny funnier than others especially

714
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:43,010
streaming because I'm so I'm focused on multiple things at
once so I'm like it's like when you're talking and writing

715
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:48,370
something you know you're like typing something and you type
what you say Kind of similar to that.

716
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,530
We love your brand.

717
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:55,730
I'm glad.

718
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:01,090

Yeah.

721
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:10,370
Sometimes it says subscriber only mode, but I am subbed.

722
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,770
First of all, thank you for subscribing.

723
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,670
Second of all, you're not the only one.

724
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,150
YouTube has been really funky.

725
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:28,050
funky like recently a lot of people are saying that they're
having issues with this one is safe

726
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:40,090
i middle clicked because i was scared yeah i do the
subscriber mode because it helps keep out spam like bot

727
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:51,010
messages coming in so easily you know what i mean but um
sorry that it's been kind of buggy for you guys.

728
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,890
Middle click, the three at the top.

729
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:58,950
Which one?

730
01:05:59,150 --> 01:05:59,370
This one?

731
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,430
Oh, you're right.

732
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,410
Yeah, one, two, three.

733
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,610
Thank you!

734
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:07,350
One.

735
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:09,370
One, two.

736
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:09,950
Okay.

737
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:14,030
This one is free.

738
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,670
So it has to be...

739
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,170
Oh wait, it could be that one or that one.

740
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:20,430
Okay.

741
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:23,650
Four?

742
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,770
We've gotten up to six, baby.

743
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,650
I love the way Minto's brain works so much.

744
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,630
Except when it's being mean to her.

745
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:35,850
Hey!

746
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,670
Max is eight?

747
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:49,430
Oh, I guess because it would be like one, two, three, four,
five, six, 7, 8, and then the 8 right there.

748
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,230
How rare is that, though?

749
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:54,730
I feel like 8 has to be, like, super rare, right?

750
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,780
Never seen it.

751
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,960
It's very, very rare.

752
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,220
Yeah, it must be.

753
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,740
How exciting if one day we got it.

754
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,120
That'd be so cool.

755
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,280
Fun multitask mistake for me was in the first grade.

756
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,860
I was supposed to start the Pledge of Allegiance, but I was
reading a Sesame Street book and I was saying whatever

757
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,260
Grover was saying.

758
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,860
Not Grover.

759
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,000
If mint was a soda flavor, would it be Coke Zero Sugar?

760
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:43,420
Because...

761
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,500
Because why?

762
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,010
I pledge allegiance to Grover.

763
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:51,130
Of the...

764
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:51,910
Of...

765
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:52,310
Of...

766
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,270
The United Sesame Streets.

767
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,700
You learned how to play Mindsaber from old college humor
sketch.

768
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,520
No way.

769
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,600
This one's clean.

770
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:07,960
Nice.

771
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,480
Then it must be this one.

772
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,700
Because one, two, three.

773
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:19,580
Clean.

774
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,860
Sorry, I will play the game.

775
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:23,840
I am playing.

776
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,120
Just, you know, on my own terms.

777
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,820
Not clean.

778
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,420
Not clean.

779
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,720
I was wrong!

780
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,420
Wait, how was I wrong?

781
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:40,760
Wait.

782
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,120
What's

783
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:48,270
up there?

784
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:51,030
Dang it, I didn't see the connecting there.

785
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:52,270
No!

786
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:55,950
Oh well.

787
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:58,850
I'm gonna do this one.

788
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,310
I'm gonna also do this one.

789
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:05,830
Two.

790
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,710
A simple two.

791
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,310
Here.

792
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,730
Another simple two.

793
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:12,350
Here.

794
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:14,750
Bam.

795
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,130
Okay, we can start with this.

796
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:21,970
There we go.

797
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:22,950
And there.

798
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:23,690
And there.

799
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:24,230
Nice.

800
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,750
We got three corners.

801
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:29,950
Which would you give up?

802
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,430
Lasagna or shrimp scampi?

803
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,770
I love shrimp scampi.

804
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,610
I would give up.

805
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,470
I don't like lasagna that much, actually, so goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye.

806
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:41,450
Give me shrimp scampy every day.

807
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:44,990
That was some lemon juice on top.

808
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:50,790
Do you notice the face it makes when you click?

809
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:51,250
Yeah!

810
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:52,840
I like it.

811
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,850
Safe.

812
01:09:58,890 --> 01:09:59,750
Whoa!

813
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:02,450
Say...

814
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:04,790
Say...

815
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,790
Save?

816
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:06,790
Oh, okay, four.

817
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:08,850
Corner.

818
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:09,810
Save.

819
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,490
Corner.

820
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,290
I'll take all the lasagna.

821
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,910
Okay, you can have it.

822
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,530
Top right corner, I dare you.

823
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:21,910
I do it.

824
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,930
I'm not afraid.

825
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,150
That's the funny thing about being dead.

826
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,370
I'm not afraid of death.

827
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:30,730
What am I gonna do?

828
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:31,990
Blow up.

829
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:34,890
Oh, gosh, mom, I'm blowing up on the internet.

830
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,450
Might be a bad thing.

831
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,890
Might not be great, actually.

832
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,710
Oh, gosh.

833
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,130
Oh, no.

834
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:51,150
It's like the good and bad thing about, like, going viral,
you know?

835
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,290
It's like...

836
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:58,890
You'll get then...

837
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,430
You'll then get, like, the people that are...

838
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:14,470
scary and unhinged that that start to pay attention to you
too and you're like oh no oh no oh no

839
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:41,450
they come out of the woodwork I know I'm very honestly like
I'm very what's the word comfortable with my size because it

840
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:53,570
is like I'm I feel very like i don't i'm not the i'm not the
biggest obviously but it's like i i feel like it's chill

841
01:11:53,570 --> 01:12:05,410
enough you know it's pretty nice during the yaps and the
sweeping thanks minto thanks artemaris welcome back your

842
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:13,310
usars yeah yeah yeah yeah mint is a liar she stole billions

843
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:37,020
I'll never admit it Minto likes being short confirmed I You
know I wanted to be really tall A long time ago I wish I was

844
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:46,840
like Like six foot tall I wanted to be like so tall And then
You know I thought about it for like planes and stuff

845
01:12:46,840 --> 01:13:04,920
Actually I don't mind at all and also it's funny because
like um I once I saw a video that was like this is the POV

846
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:19,320
of of um like a POV of someone in a kitchen at 150
centimeters right so like about 5 feet and um and it was

847
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:26,500
funny because the comments were like oh this feels so much
more comfortable than like seeing the pov of someone at six

848

dishes like if i'm trying or a plate.

851
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,020
It's very inconvenient.

852
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,260
Short propaganda?

853
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:55,840
No.

854
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,040
No!

855
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,280
It's better!

856
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,260
Guy who gets vertigo watching a six-foot POV.

857
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,360
Can you ride roller coasters?

858
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,160
Yeah.

859
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,040
I can ride any roller coaster.

860
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,780
I was five foot nothing up until like 15.

861
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,580
Now I'm six foot.

862
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,600
How did that happen?

863
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,540
What kind of growth spurt did you have?

864
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,680
Whatever size you are, that's the perfect size.

865
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,480
Thank you.

866
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,680
Also, thank you so much for the redirect, Mero.

867
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,940
Welcome, welcome.

868
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,400
Welcome, welcome everybody.

869
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,260
This one must be bud.

870
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,380
So then this is safe.

871
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,080
Wait, safe.

872
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:44,560
Paperbacks!

873
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,480
Thank you for the gifted.

874
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:45,980
There we go.

875
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,360
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

876
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,240
I had a growth spurt.

877
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,040
Can't relate.

878
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,500
Thank you, STO2.

879
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,060
Thank you for the gift, dad.

880
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,740
Rest in glitch race.

881
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,980
Thank you for the gift, dad.

882
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,940
Ducky, thank you for the gift, dad.

883
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,560
We can tell.

884
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,520
My body for gore.

885
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,300
Imagine growing.

886
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,200
It's supposed to hurt, though, no?

887
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,020
Like when you...

888
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,760
It's right click.

889
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:25,340
Okay, good.

890
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,220
Just when I was getting scared for a second.

891
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,600
It hurts when your body grows, though, doesn't it?

892
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,120
That should be, yeah.

893
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,100
Choo-choo.

894
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,860
So then this is safe.

895
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:42,340
Yeah.

896
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,080
A bit.

897
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,520
There are growing pains.

898
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,400
Why would it hurt?

899
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,840
Because you're stretching.

900
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,020
Right?

901
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,220
I suffered so much in my childhood from growing pains.

902
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,000
Maybe you guys just don't remember because you're old.

903
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,780
I'm a fresh, you know, 19.

904
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,300
I don't

905
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,260
know why, but Minto's extra cute tonight.

906
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,100
Let's see.

907
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:47,580

This one is all, these are also clear.

913
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,260
She's gonna be awesome at this one.

914
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,500
She actually focuses.

915
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,880
That's the hard part is the focus.

916
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,540
You know what I mean?

917
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,540
That's the hard part.

918
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,320
Focus.

919
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,410
You gotta lock in.

920
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:56,690
Okay.

924
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:27,530
I want to play a mind sweeper clone that makes cute minto
noises when I click.

925
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,970
Okay, there's gotta be a game dev in the chat.

926
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:32,950
You know what to do.

927
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:34,850
You know what to make.

928
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:35,790
Oh wait, this is good.

929
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:36,410
This is clear.

930
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,150
Yeah.

931
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:38,350
This is clear.

932
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:43,670
Clear.

933
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:49,150
I will do the sounds.

934
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:50,950
I could be like, save.

935
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:52,810
Save.

936
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,750
Jay, welcome back!

937
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,130
Hi, I am GameDev.

938
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:00,570
If you want to, you could.

939
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:02,710
Save.

940
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:03,630
Save.

941
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,230
Save.

942
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,210
And then if you accidentally click a bomb, it goes, Save.

943
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:08,910
Oh, just kidding!

944
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:12,270
What would be the sound effect for explosion?

945
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,490
That's my Donald Duck impression.

946
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,610
If there was an explosion, it would be like, Kaplowy!

947
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:26,180
Save.

948
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,540
Roadrunner cartoons.

949
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,420
Roadrunner cartoons.

950
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,680
Let's see, what do we got here?

951
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,200
Safe.

952
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:46,660
Safe.

953
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,100
Oh, oops, safe.

954
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:05,350
The one on the left middle by the flag.

955
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,000

959
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,440
But for the rules of the game, I think I get it.

960
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,660
I think I get it.

961
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Elpers in chat.

962
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,400
I'm an elpa.

963
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:52,820
Oh, whoops.

964
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,500
Oh my god, I almost...

965
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,960
Middle click is scary because sometimes I accidentally click
on the wrong thing.

966
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,400
That's scary.

967
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:00,420
That's so scary.

968
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,760
Holy canoli, that would have been bad.

969
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,800
There's a mine on your nose.

970
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,680
We'll boop it and flag it safe for you.

971
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:16,840
Wait.

972
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,820
It tickles.

973
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,520
It tickles.

974
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,460
This one is not safe.

975
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,820
One, two.

976
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,070
And so this one is not safe.

977
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:43,840
Yes.

978
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,960
I got to ride in the back of a car.

01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,460

986
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,480
Sometimes I just want a smaller meal, you know?

987
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,860
Two top middle.

Thank you, thank you.

Sometimes, though, like, some places will let you.

995
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,840
But some restaurants are, like, really...

996
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:54,600
strict about it you know especially it's easier to get away
with it at like a fast food place if you're like going

997
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:59,640
through drive-through or you know just ordering but if
you're like at a sit-down restaurant usually they'll like

998
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:08,060

01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,320
You can do that five.

Oh, there is a five!

That knocked out a ton, didn't it?

1011
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,240
Craziness.

1012
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:21,140
And then also, we will be able to do this three, right?

1013
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,080

Hummer, hummer, hummer.

Remember at perpetually...

1022
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,780
Remember being perpetually nine years old to get kids'
prices up over there.

1023
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,500
Well, let's see.

1024
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:03,000
I know you guys yell at me at places to look, but I would
also like to find them myself.

1025
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,480
You know.

1026
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,540
One, two.

1027
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:13,920
I would like to find them myself before I rely on you guys
and your expertise, okay?

1028
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:18,060
So if you think I'm ignoring you, I probably am.

1029
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:19,800
Oh!

1030
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,160
She hates us.

1031
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,220
No!

1032
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:36,200
One.

1033
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,020
Never.

1034
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:39,540
One.

1035
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:41,940
Someone.

1036
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:42,680
One.

1037
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,280
Someone.

1038
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,740
Someone.

1039
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,080
Someone.

1040
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,080
Someone.

1041
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:50,540
Someone.

1042
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,680
I mean someone.

1043
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:52,660
Someone.

1044
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:54,880
Someone.

1045
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,060
Someone.

1046
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,020
Someone.

1047
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,160
Someone.

1048
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:58,620
Someone else.

1049
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,700
Someone.

1050
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:02,960
Someone.

1051
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,040
Someone.

1052
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,580
This is a corn.

1053
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,040
Oh.

1054
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,460
Uh, this one.

1055
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,220
There we go.

1056
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,460
Oh, misclick.

1057
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,540
A birthday.

1058
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,820
Minto Bind Sweeper's Dream on my birthday.

1059
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:14,880
You got this man.

1060
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,460
I believe in you.

1061
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:16,320
I'm Peter.

1062
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,540
Happy birthday.

1063
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,820
Happy, happy birthday.

1064
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,580
Happy, happy birthday.

1065
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,520
Looking cute, Minto.

1066
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:25,060
Thank you.

1067
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,040
Oh, my gosh.

1068
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:29,900
I thought my clock.

1069
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,100
I thought it had been.

1070
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,000
Oh, my gosh.

1071
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,800
I thought it had been two and a half hours already.

1072
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,560
I was like, there's no.

1073
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:45,500
way but my clock uh the i have a i have a like a a clock and
the i wasn't looking at my computer clock i was looking at

1074
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:51,960
it and i have a koharu standy in front of it and it blocked
the part that made it look like eight so i thought it was

1075
01:27:51,960 --> 01:28:01,340
nine and i was like what where did the time go sorry for the
winded explanation

1076
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,700
A clock you say.

1077
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,380
Yes, yes, I might have a clock.

1078
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,880
I might partake in the, you know, the time.

1079
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,720
Mito, sweeto, Mito, cuteo!

1080
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,780
Shadow Chama!

1081
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,420
Thank you for this, everybody!

1082
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,360
I love you.

1083
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:38,200
I like when you beat Mind Sweeper and the smiley face guy is
like...

1084
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:38,540
Glasses.

1085
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,280
I've never beat Mind Sweeper, so I'm really...

1086
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,000
I want that experience.

1087
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,500
I want that.

1088
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,140
I want to see that guy.

1089
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,240
I've never beaten it.

1090
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,780
Today is the day.

1091
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,240
Spoilers.

1092
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,940
Not the Mind Sweeper spoilers.

1093
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,900
Oh my god.

1094
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,760
Oh my god.

1095
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,380
Did you start with hard mode?

1096
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,460
Started with hard mode.

1097
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:22,620
Da-den.

1098
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,300
Oh, nice, nice.

1099
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:30,720
I like when we clear more than two things.

1100
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:33,440
Okay.

1101
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:41,970
Sometimes in the end it's 50-50.

1102
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:43,470
I know, that's what happened to me last.

1103
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:53,890
time and what was my downfall but i believe i believe here
look we haven't even gotten to 999 yet we're kind of killing

1104
01:29:53,890 --> 01:30:21,500
it wait it has to be this one one two three okay at this
pace hey hey we're going at minto pace okay please please

1105
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:29,000
understand Have you watched Apple BBC prehistoric planet
season 1 and 2?

1106
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:29,720
No.

1107
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:30,960
I haven't.

1108
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,760
I don't think I...

1109
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:37,540
I'm pretty sure I canceled Apple TV after Severance.

1110
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,160
And then once Severance comes back, I'll get it again.

1111
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,000
That's how I...

1112
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,100
That's how I work.

1113
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,180
I don't really have, like, any subscription services.

1114
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,510
Unless, like, I want to watch something and then I get rid
of it.

1115
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:01,440
Pluribus.

1116
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:02,160
What's that?

1117
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,860
What's pluribus?

1118
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,280
Not spoilers.

1119
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,240
Cannot believe.

1120
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,800
It's about slimes.

1121
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,460
From the Directors of Breaking Bad?

1122
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,360
New show by...

1123
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,620
Wait, I'm looking it up.

1124
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,620
Wait, hold on.

1125
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:33,660
Pluribus.

1126
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:35,020
Oh!

1127
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,040
Lady Yellen.

1128
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,920
Post-apocalyptic science fiction TV show.

1129
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:41,700
Whoa!

1130
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:49,540
The most miserable person on earth must save the world from
happiness.

1131
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,000
What is this?

1132
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,360
What is this show?

1133
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,240
Oh wow, it's kind of divisive, I feel.

1134
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,520
The reviews show a lot of five-star and then quite a bit of
one-star.

1135
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,280
Uh-uh.

1136
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,800
It's really good.

1137
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,340
There was...

1138
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,540
There was one apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic show.

1139
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:16,740
Oh, I think it was Last Man on Earth or something.

1140
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,340
I think it got canceled before anything.

1141
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,080
Yeah, Last Man on Earth.

1142
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,440
I was watching that along, like, when it came out.

1143
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:27,960
And...

1144
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,540
I think I got canceled.

1145
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,640
cancelled and never, uh, never, they never solved anything.

1146
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,400
That's kind of what it reminded me of.

1147
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:39,880
The synopsis.

1148
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:40,840
Let's check it out.

1149
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,540
Wait, is it on the Apple TV?

1150
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:44,380
Oh, no.

1151
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:48,460
This is pretty funny.

1152
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:51,420
Yeah, I thought it was, I thought it was okay when I watched
it, yeah.

1153
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,560
I saw, I saw a, a video that was like...

1154
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:05,940
If a show gets cancelled, I feel like we are owed one final
episode.

1155
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,040
You know what I mean?

1156
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,480
Like, just some sort of...

1157
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,260
I feel like they can at least...

1158
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,900
They should at least give us that.

1159
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:19,380
Like, something to just kind of explain things and wrap it
up.

1160
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:20,800
Just...

1161
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:21,600
Even if it's...

1162
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,480
Even if it's...

1163
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,100
Like, you know...

1164
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,540
I get it.

1165
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:32,760
Like, if something is cancelled in between seasons, like,
that's so messed up.

1166
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,900
For somebody who wants an ending.

1167
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:35,600
Exactly!

1168
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,040
Oh, man.

1169
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,820
Do you guys see any moves I can do?

1170
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:44,840
I'm trying to look.

1171
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:45,320
I'm looking.

1172
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:46,780
I'm looking.

1173
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,000
I'm looking.

1174
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:53,400
Give us a send-off, even if it's just to say your main actor
is unhinged.

1175
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:53,920
I know!

1176
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:54,680
Something!

1177
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,980
Like, I feel like people deserve the closure.

1178
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,280
The two on top.

1179
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:06,040
Middle left, two, two, two.

1180
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,400
This one?

1181
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:10,740
Or, oh, this one?

1182
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,180
Both of them.

1183
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:25,860
How?

1184
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:26,340
Where?

1185
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:35,800
Huh?

1186
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,930
Two on top left of three.

1187
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,850
Yeah, but it's, how would I know?

1188
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:52,990
Because it could be this or this or this.

1189
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:58,970
It could be all three of those.

1190
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:01,650
Night of your preference for proper resolutions.

1191
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:02,910
How did you feel about Twin Peaks?

1192
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:04,310
I have not watched it, Dan.

1193
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:06,910
I have not watched.

1194
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,670
To the right.

1195
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:12,210
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

1196
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,990
Oh, this one.

1197
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:13,770
Oh, okay, okay.

1198
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:14,470
Because...

1199
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:17,870
Thank you.

1200
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:19,410
Thank you.

1201
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:38,890
Oh, it's a good thing we didn't do corners, huh?

1202
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:43,710

Let's go.

1212
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:25,790
Thank you guys.

1213
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,310
I didn't see that at all.

1214
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:32,870
Anything here?

1215
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,250
Good progress indeed.

1216
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:48,790
Four on the right is open.

1217
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,270
This one?

1218
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:55,670
I'm starting drawing!

1219
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,410
Give me three to four years, I'll design your bunny girl
outfit.

1220
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,730
Yeah, you will!

1221
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:04,570
Okay, I won't do a bunny girl outfit for three or four years
then.

1222
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,410
Right above my mouse.

1223
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:11,130
We're in the bottom left corner.

1224
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:14,110
Should we try and get this corner down over here then?

1225
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:18,130
It's kind of scary here though.

1226
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,830
Oh, I can do this too.

1227
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,130
This one?

1228
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:23,550
Okay.

1229
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:24,930
Boom.

1230
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:27,570
And then boom, boom, boom.

1231
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:29,930
One, two.

1232
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,130
This must be this one.

1233
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,090
Done.

1234
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:37,950
Five.

1235
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,070
One, two, three, four.

1236
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,750
Oh wait, no, never mind.

1237
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:45,330
You can finish the bottom left corner, start where the two
and three are.

1238
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:45,750
Mm-mm.

1239
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:47,030
Mm-mm.

1240
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,110
Mm-mm.

1241
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,380
Little Mouse with the 2 and 3.

1242
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,160
Do you know, that's the funny thing about this game.

1243
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,600
Is there many parts with 2 and 3.

1244
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:02,780
But we can do it right there.

1245
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:03,300
You're right.

1246
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,980
I did end up seeing that one.

1247
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,140
Let's see.

1248
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,060
That actually clears up the 5.

1249
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,220
So 1, 2, 3, 1.

1250
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,420
Like this, right?

1251
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,660
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1252
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,480
Skid Rock.

1253
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,920
design a bunny girl outfit right now.

1254
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,480
Bunny ears.

1255
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,220
That's it.

1256
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,360
That's it.

1257
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,380
No, nothing else.

1258
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:42,780
You know, Ayami Mama, she made a bunny girl outfit, like a,
she did some fan art of Koharu wearing a bunny girl outfit,

1259
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,640
and it's so cute, but she also made it into a clear file.

1260
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:51,280
And the clear file, you guys, Ayami Mama's a genius.

1261
01:38:51,540 --> 01:39:02,240
The clear file has a separate part where the outfit is
overlaid on top and so when you open up the clear file

1262
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:24,120
underneath is you know when you take off the clothes yeah I
love my mama you one two three Save.

1263
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,220
We did another corner!

01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:29,800
Oh my gosh.

1265
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,680
We're about halfway through, you guys.

01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:41,340
Minto cardboard bunny dress win.

1267
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:42,740

1268
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,520
Cardboard!

1269
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,620
I want to be properly dressed.

1270
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:46,390

Mint will clear this before the timer hits 1000.

1274
01:39:59,460 --> 01:39:59,580

1277
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,040
I...

1278
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:07,960
Freestyle!

1279
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:10,740
Yeah.

1280
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,760
That was my superpower.

1281
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:19,180
That was my superpower.

1282
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,000
Um, this one must be.

1283
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:24,940
Which means this one is clear.

1284
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,000
Yes.

1285
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,400
Which means this one is also clear.

1286
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,760
Which means this one is bad.

1287
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,400
Bad news bears.

1288
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,140
Very important.

1289
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,380
Leggings or no leggings?

01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:17,400
Oh, you're right, thank you.

1384
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,220
Thank you, thank you.

1385
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:21,420
Yes, two, two.

1386
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,820
Yes, so this one is safe.

1387
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:30,260
So then this bad boy right there.

1388
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,980
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

1389
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:40,620
I love a tutu.

1390
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,360
Princess tutu.

1391
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:45,940
Oh!

1392
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,700
Oh wait, I see a tutu.

1393
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:04,060
Da-da!

1394
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:04,920
Whoa!

1395
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:08,100
Okay.

1396
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,020
Hmm.

1397
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:14,840
Yes, yes, very interesting.

1398
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,720
And it has to be this one too, then.

1399
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:18,720
One, two.

1400
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:20,200
Yes.

1401
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:24,740
Hmm.

1402
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:25,860
Ugh.

1403
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:27,900
It's so bright.

1404
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,560
I wish I could turn out the brightness.

1405
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,740
There needs to be like a dark mode.

1406
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:33,540
Wait.

1407
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,920
I wonder what display does.

1408
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,700
Wait, what if I lose my game?

1409
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,600
I'll try it after.

1410
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:51,460
Yes sir I'll try it after Let's see

1411
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:02,030
Minto are you ever doing another concert at anime NYC in the
future?

1412
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:13,770
Thanks for the server chat I would like to If I ever get the
chance to I would But sometimes it's not so easy to just be

1413
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:30,470
like I want to do this thing You know big bucks or to be
invited the two three two is free I don't know where you see

1414
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:40,950
that or this one right here oh oh one two this one oh wait

1415
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:44,910

1416
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:50,550
Bye-bye!

1417
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:52,510
Monthly Minto appreciation!

Thank you!

Big, big money.

1421
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:01,990
Large money.

1422
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,310
Because 3D, well, I mean, it doesn't have to be 3D.

1423
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:12,230
But for a show like Anime NYC, I would want to put in the
extra effort.

1424
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:12,930
You know what I mean?

1425
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:16,050
I would want it to be 3D.

1426
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:27,130
what i want it to be because anime nyc is a big big event i
would want it to be also a big concert yeah lunari welcome

1427
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,390
back thank you

1428
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:35,150
let's see

1429
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:55,790
uh this three is one two which means this guy is free one
two free see what I did there yeah

1430
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:07,750
nice we will await your return to MIC with eager eyes and
pen lights in hand yeah and then hopefully too whenever I

1431
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:19,510
return it's also with Phoebe and Vicky so we can do Denzitsu
concert da da da one One, two, three, four.

1432
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:22,830
I have to double check everything, man.

1433
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:33,250
You said free instead of three.

1434
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:34,130
Very clever.

1435
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,070
Yeah, yeah, I did, I did.

1436
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:38,710
I should be saying safe.

1437
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:39,930
I don't know why I'm saying free.

1438
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:44,050
It's like I'm releasing it from its mortal coil.

1439
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:45,390
You are free.

1440
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,770
You are free!

1441
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:53,670
Oh, I'm getting a little...

1442
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:57,590
This area.

1443
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:05,630
That chunk now requires harder deductions, I think.

1444
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:06,250
Oh, really?

1445
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:08,230
That's

1446
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,880
a good way to not explode.

1447
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:21,700
Do I have to guess?

1448
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,060
No way.

1449
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:24,840
No, why?

1450
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:25,920
No, why?

1451
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:29,280
You got Spider Solitaire on that?

1452
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,940
I love Spider Solitaire.

1453
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:35,340
The three fields above the four are mines.

1454
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:36,720
How do we know?

1455
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,950
The space pinball.

1456
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:54,870
Wait, that's so good.

1457
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:57,030
You can deduce it.

1458
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:01,270
Because the three means only one mine can be next to it.

1459
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:10,330
Yeah, but why couldn't it be like that?

1460
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:11,430
Like that one?

1461
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:14,890
I don't know how you guys figure this out sometimes.

1462
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:30,450
I'm still learning English.

1463
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:31,630
You can only understand a little.

1464
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,210
I absolutely love cute mint.

1465
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:43,750
Supa-chan, thank you!

1466
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:45,650
Thank you for watching, thank you!

1467
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:54,370
English, go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-goo!

1468
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:58,970
Got a bail!

1469
01:53:59,090 --> 01:53:59,990
Good night, Rebel!

1470
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:03,970
Bottom left under the two, wait.

1471
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:07,310
The two under the one will be safe in the middle.

1472
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:10,630
Wait, oh, wait, too many words!

1473
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:22,290
Too many words The one beside the three cannot be in mine So
the one beside the four must not be one

1474
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:30,020
But why can't it be?

1475
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:39,740
That's why I don't understand how you guys deduce these
Because it's like, you're like It has to be Like, you know

1476
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:51,960
That's why K3 Okay, now you're speaking Now, okay this game
next week i mean last week what do you mean k3 what i what

1477
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:59,900
is this battleships i sank your ship l1 k1 what is this

1478
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:05,260
what is this

1479
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:28,440
next week might be accurate accurate no no i know how to
play I know method of exclusion maybe I'll never be a pro at

1480
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:38,460
mind sweeper then if I don't know how to do the exclusions
that's okay I just want to beat the game once queen to L1

1481
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:46,940
who the one closest to the smiling face tells you that only
one bomb in the two spaces.

1482
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:48,400
Yeah, I get that.

1483
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:53,380
The two under tells you the one bomb, the top three spaces.

1484
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,760
That means the third one.

1485
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:56,160
Now you lost me.

1486
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:03,620
Yeah, I know the rules, but not the strats.

1487
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:08,120
I think that's a good way of putting it, because I really
get confused when you guys start saying things.

1488
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,560
Don't say things are easy, because they're not easy for me
with numbers.

1489
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,100
Thank you.

1490
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,540
The one, I just need a lot of explanations.

1491
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:30,200
The one four space, wait, the one four spaces from the
ghost.

1492
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,140
Wait, what's ghost?

1493
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:31,820
Me?

1494
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:35,740
Wait, X sparks the spot.

1495
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,140
Ah, okay.

1496
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:40,200
Purple place?

1497
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:41,920
Mind sweeper, 3D pinball.

1498
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:43,520
No, I love solitaire.

1499
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:44,640
Solitaire is my favorite.

1500
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:48,320
I place, I have like, what's it called?

1501
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,760
Solitaire on my phone.

1502
01:56:51,920 --> 01:57:01,380
I can play on the plane and that's like one time I had no
little TV screen on a flight to Japan and so it was just me

1503
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,140
in solitary the whole time baby

1504
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:23,260
okay there's so much text okay the 3 below 4 cannot have
more than 2 mines yeah because it already has 2 yeah the 4

1505
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:27,080
must have 3 mines on top and 1 near the 3

1506
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:53,900
okay okay okay uh that that helped explain I think okay I
get what your so the other one is a mystery we don't know if

1507
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:57,000
it's this one touching three or that one touching three

1508
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:13,400
I understand what you're putting down i get it okay okay
okay sometimes it's sometimes you guys will explain it in

1509
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:16,740
seven different ways and only one way clicks for me you know
what i mean

1510
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:34,520
one two three okay oh but this one has to be this one one
two three so then one two three four boom One...

1511
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:35,000
Wait.

1512
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,320
One, two, three...

1513
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:37,760
Four!

1514
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:38,780
Like that.

1515
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,100
Wait, this is scary.

1516
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:41,760
There's too many.

1517
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,840
There's too many bombs.

1518
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:46,740
Wait, yeah, that is right, right?

1519
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,320
One, two, three, four, yeah.

1520
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:49,840
There's too many bombs.

1521
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:51,240
There's too many bombs.

1522
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:57,080
They're doing good though.

1523
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:57,640
Thank you!

1524
01:58:58,220 --> 01:59:00,220
If it helps, there's a bomb on the bottom right of the
screen.

1525
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,800
You are the bomb.

1526
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:12,090
And the...

1527
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:13,930
Okay, from here, though.

1528
01:59:18,110 --> 01:59:20,090
From here, though, it's pretty spooky, isn't it?

1529
01:59:30,030 --> 01:59:33,650
Apply the same logic to the one and two by the smiley face.

1530
02:00:14,630 --> 02:00:15,110
But...

1531
02:00:15,110 --> 02:00:17,310
But those have a one...

1532
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:21,870
I don't know if this or this.

1533
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:35,720
So then this one is free.

1534
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:37,600
Is that what you're saying?

1535
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:43,120
So this one is okay.

1536
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:44,640
Okay.

1537
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:49,840
I thought you guys were talking about where I place a flag.

1538
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:53,240
Okay.

1539
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:58,480
So then this flag, this is flagged.

1540
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,460
Because it's one, two, three.

1541
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:02,920
Okay.

1542
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,340
Tricky, tricky, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1543
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,420
Okay, okay.

1544
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,260
Okay, okay.

1545
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,500
And then this too is...

1546
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:13,860
Okay.

1547
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:24,320
When Microsoft stopped packaging Minesweeper and other games
with their OS, Windows 8, is when I knew Microsoft was done.

1548
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,340
Give us the games we earned for the...

1549
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:30,520
It's because they were like...

1550
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:34,480
I bet you it was some old foggy.

1551
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:40,880
that was like, hey, my salary men are playing games at work
and not working.

1552
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:43,380
Get it out of there.

1553
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:44,820
Get it out of there.

1554
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:51,460
We yearn for the games.

1555
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:54,340
We yearn for the mine.

1556
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,500
Sweeper.

1557
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,140
Okay.

1558
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,400
This is spooky, scary, guys.

1559
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,820
This is too scary.

1560
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:23,790
This is hard When it gets really down to the wire You know
Skeletons, yeah Spooky, scary skeletons Wait a second, hold

1561
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:39,630
on Two, two, this one's okay Wait, so that means
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da We did it Okay One, two Three.

1562
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:40,770
Three is safe.

1563
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:45,010
So many fours crammed into this area.

1564
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:47,070
One, two, three.

1565
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:49,270
Okay, one, two, three.

1566
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:57,070
It would make most sense that it's this, right?

1567
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:05,320
Four.

1568
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:15,550
You can't get any more there right now.

1569
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:19,770
Do we just...

1570
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:21,210
do this one right here.

1571
02:03:33,790 --> 02:03:38,910
Guys, I don't want to get so far over here to where if I die
now, I die now.

1572
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:43,430
I don't want to do all the work over here just to die in the
last two moves.

1573
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:48,530
I don't want to do the right side yet.

1574
02:03:50,350 --> 02:03:51,850
I want to just die!

1575
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:53,870
I want to just die!

1576
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:57,990
It's never going to change, you know?

1577
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:04,390
we have like unless we do this whole area and then we have
one mine left you know what i mean

1578
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:26,150
change tactics go to the twos and threes on the right i like
how i'm being directed okay fine fine we will divert course

1579
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:31,990
Nah, I'm gonna press it.

1580
02:04:36,570 --> 02:04:38,470
That was scary.

1581
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:40,120
Wasn't it guys?

1582
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:44,510
That

1583
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:49,650
was scary.

1584
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:03,450
Yeah, it kind of doesn't help so much though, right?

1585
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:05,110
A little bit.

1586
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:08,170
It's still kind of tricky.

1587
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:09,550
It still could be anywhere.

1588
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:10,170
I feel.

1589
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:16,170
Wait, you can solve it now.

1590
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:16,790
Wait, does it?

1591
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:18,210
Wait, how can you solve it?

1592
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:28,330
This one is guaranteed safe.

1593
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:29,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1594
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,290
That's what I figured.

1595
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:32,230
Because...

1596
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:34,090
Okay, that means this one's safe.

1597
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:35,650
Because 1, 2, 3...

1598
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:38,750
Oh, yeah!

1599
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,450
Wait, here we go!

1600
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:41,630
1, 2...

1601
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:42,190
Okay, wait.

1602
02:05:42,290 --> 02:05:43,230
Okay, hold on.

1603
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:44,910
Uh...

1604
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:49,940
This one.

1605
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:57,230
Wait, the four?

1606
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:58,070
What about the four?

1607
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:15,170
So then this one, yeah.

1608
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:19,710
We didn't need to come back at all, everybody.

1609
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:28,960
Alright, now to the right side.

1610
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:31,900
Hum, hum, hum, hum.

1611
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,520
Hum, hum, hum, hum.

1612
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:37,900
Tear.

1613
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,900
Not another video takedown.

1614
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:42,540
No gambling.

1615
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:42,860
Oh.

1616
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:45,620
You're right.

1617
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:46,860
No gambling!

1618
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:50,680
I don't condone!

1619
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:54,100
Or wait, I say no to gambling.

1620
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:59,520
I've never gambled once in my afterlife ever!

1621
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:03,880
Oh, wait, this two is also...

1622
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:04,620
I just realized.

1623
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:06,980
Which means one here.

1624
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,300
Okay.

1625
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,820
And then also this two.

1626
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:13,240
Which means this two is safe.

1627
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:13,840
Okay, cool.

1628
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,580
I'm a betting man.

1629
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:19,600
Bet 10 gifted, you won't click the bottom right corner.

1630
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,280
Just don't make baby noises.

1631
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:25,780
Toes were mine.

1632
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:34,400
Oh yeah, the two below here too.

1633
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:36,320
I don't know.

1634
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,360
I'm so far now.

1635
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,560
I don't feel like I don't...

1636
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:39,080
I'm scared.

1637
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:40,080
I'm too scared.

1638
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:40,820
I'm too chicken.

1639
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:42,620
I'm chicken for real.

1640
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:44,520
I'm chicken and out.

1641
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:47,140
I am.

1642
02:07:51,860 --> 02:08:07,000
I don't believe in the corner method anymore Too much to
lose Too much to lose Uh, let's see here Uh, this one Nice

1643
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:20,260
Which means this one's safe Nice Friends of the park Thank
you for the tech captain Thank you Oh Amito gambling is...

1644
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:22,660
And crime is how I make all my money to Super Chai use.

1645
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:23,820
Sometimes it's criminal gambling.

1646
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:25,460
Sometimes gambling, criminal.

1647
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:28,220
Okay, Walter White.

1648
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:31,080
Thank you for the Super Chai.

1649
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:33,040
And then we can also do this three.

1650
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:37,180
And then two is safe.

1651
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:43,720
And then must be this other two as well.

1652
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:46,780
And then three is safe.

1653
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:53,480
I messed up

1654
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:02,570
I messed up

1655
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:07,830
I see where I messed up

1656
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,140
I didn't see the other corner

1657
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:23,280
I went too fast oh here's a good start

1658
02:09:32,830 --> 02:09:34,590
we can begin here

1659
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:40,990
oh the dark mode yeah let me see let me see

1660
02:09:49,750 --> 02:10:01,950
wait it's it doesn't look so good for you guys though i
think it kind of looks weird for you guys huh it's it's fine

1661
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:11,750
we don't need it it's fine it's okay it's okay that's fine
it was a big difference for me because the rest of the

1662
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:14,830
screen turned dark, but it's fine.

1663
02:10:15,110 --> 02:10:15,870
It's fine.

1664
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:17,110
I don't need it.

1665
02:10:17,170 --> 02:10:18,110
I don't need it.

1666
02:10:18,990 --> 02:10:19,910
I don't need it.

1667
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:21,790
It's fine.

1668
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:27,330
As long as you guys don't have your eyes hurting them.

1669
02:10:28,330 --> 02:10:28,890
That's all.

1670
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:29,630
It's okay.

1671
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:49,260
Okay.

1672
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:53,460
I might be speeding through here a little bit.

1673
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:59,280
One, two, three, four.

1674
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:00,460
Yes.

1675
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:07,240
I might be a little speedy.

1676
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:08,940
A little speed demon.

1677
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:14,440
Dark mode Mind Sweeper looks like a modern McDonald's
building.

1678
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,220
What is that supposed to mean?

1679
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,360
Look at her goal.

1680
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:22,560
I'm on world record pace, mom.

1681
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:24,460
I'll make it.

1682
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:26,440
I'll make it.

1683
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:30,160
None.

1684
02:11:39,570 --> 02:11:40,470
I'm looking around.

1685
02:11:41,050 --> 02:11:41,210
Oh, here.

1686
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:48,470
This one.

1687
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:53,430
Do you guys hear that?

1688
02:11:53,470 --> 02:11:54,130
That was my tummy.

1689
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:55,530
It went, wow.

1690
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:57,530
I think I'm hungry.

1691
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:02,490
I was gonna make ramen after this.

1692
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:05,810
I want something salty, you know?

1693
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:10,830
Did not hear.

1694
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:13,250
Go eat?

1695
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:15,350
That's too short.

1696
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:16,870
We gotta beat the game, you guys.

1697
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:18,050
We gotta beat the game.

1698
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:22,050
I wanna be mine, sweeper.

1699
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:24,050
I wanna do it.

1700
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:26,350
I wanna be mine, sweeper.

1701
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:30,290
Clear.

1702
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:35,450
the three is near the center oh this one

1703
02:12:40,750 --> 02:12:48,650
south yeah i've been craving like a potato chip you know
something salty

1704
02:12:51,810 --> 02:13:05,250
careful of the 12 hour bond limit you are cruel i've only
i'm so mad about myself for the past game.

1705
02:13:05,830 --> 02:13:07,150
If only I had...

1706
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:09,430
If only...

1707
02:13:09,430 --> 02:13:12,710
If only I had paid attention better.

1708
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:15,190
But I guess that's the...

1709
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:16,410
Gosh, if only...

1710
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:18,790
It's one thing if you get...

1711
02:13:18,790 --> 02:13:20,350
Got by the 50-50, you know.

1712
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:23,250
But if I had paid attention better...

1713
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:26,630
I would have had it.

1714
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:28,250
I would have had it.

1715
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,710
It would have been mine.

1716
02:13:29,890 --> 02:13:30,250
Victory.

1717
02:13:30,610 --> 02:13:31,790
It would have been my grasp.

1718
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:32,710
Maybe.

1719
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:36,130
Logan!

1720
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:37,990
Thank you so much, motherfuck, it's a-

1721
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:43,250
Anyone could have made that error.

1722
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:45,110
Thank you.

1723
02:13:45,530 --> 02:13:49,910
The average person can physically live without food for
three weeks to two months.

1724
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:54,190
How long can you last mentally not be the mind sweeper?

1725
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:56,050
Food.

1726
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:57,510
Not even once.

1727
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:01,830
Okay, um, let's see.

1728
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:02,170
Where?

1729
02:14:02,370 --> 02:14:03,270
The two is good.

1730
02:14:03,790 --> 02:14:14,230
I'm locked in I'm I'm I'm concentrating I'm concentrating
well locked in is like that's it maybe not locked in maybe

1731
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:29,650
I'm like paying attention maybe I'm paying attention this
three can be done this one here yeah I'm slightly locked in

1732
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:34,730
why would it I'm buckled up you know when you get in a car.

1733
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:36,630
I'm buckled up.

1734
02:14:36,770 --> 02:14:39,230
But I wouldn't say I'm locked in the car.

1735
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:46,930
Everybody wear your seatbelt.

1736
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,120
She's strapped in.

1737
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:05,260
Where else?

1738
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:13,320
Here's a don't know towards the sodium food fund.

1739
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,640
Stay salty, Minky.

1740
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:16,240
Ectoplasm's salty?

1741
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:19,280
Ectoplasm's not salty.

1742
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,680
If you're salty, does that mean you're thirsty?

1743
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,060
Maybe I need to stop drinking coffee.

1744
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:28,720
Drink some water.

1745
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:35,040
It's like a Baja blast.

1746
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:35,560
Yeah.

1747
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:37,080
Baja's blast.

1748
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:42,060
Three next to the one he just did.

1749
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:43,320
This guy!

1750
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:45,260
Oh!

1751
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:47,980
Yeah, I guess so, right?

1752
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:49,000
One, two, three.

1753
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:50,860
Yeah, we could just continue down the trend.

1754
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,280
And then one is good.

1755
02:15:52,660 --> 02:15:52,860
Woo!

1756
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:54,420
And there.

1757
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:55,880
Nice.

1758
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:56,780
And there.

1759
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:57,620
And nice.

1760
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:58,140
And you.

1761
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:01,120
One, two, three, four.

1762
02:16:05,410 --> 02:16:05,850
Okay.

1763
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,740
Are you learning to see the patterns?

1764
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:17,040
I'll be honest.

1765
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,200
No.

1766
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:20,840
But...

1767
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:22,520
Not...

1768
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:35,160
entire like it's more so it's more so i am better at like
learning stuff about games like that when i'm not streaming

1769
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:43,060
because my my stream brain is on right now so really
retaining things for me in this kind of environment is

1770
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:48,800
difficult it's okay me neither okay good i'm glad i'm not
the only one

1771
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:56,280
I think this one's safe.

1772
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:58,600
No, I don't know.

1773
02:16:58,780 --> 02:16:59,700
I don't have no idea.

1774
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:01,600
Hmm.

1775
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:07,000
You are for sure just distracted a bit.

1776
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:08,240
Yeah.

1777
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:10,060
Yeah.

1778
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:15,310
The

1779
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:20,550
bottom right twos.

1780
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:33,420
My brain is in watch mode, not backseat mode.

1781
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:34,260
That's okay.

1782
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:35,100
Thanks for watching.

1783
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:38,900
Being a novice, you're as likely to imagine patterns as you
see them.

1784
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:40,200
So, yeah, be careful.

1785
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:40,860
Oh!

1786
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:43,780
Did you just call me a noob?

1787
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:46,420
Did you just call me a noobie?

1788
02:17:47,060 --> 02:17:49,140
You say, hey, little kid.

1789
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:50,700
Watch yourself.

1790
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:52,100
Watch your back.

1791
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:00,460
Actually, I...

1792
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,500
I am...

1793
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,920
I'm just a poor little baby.

1794
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:06,520
That was my first time playing Mind Sweeper.

1795
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,080
Be kind to me.

1796
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:11,140
Be kind.

1797
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:14,520
I mean, it is true.

1798
02:18:21,590 --> 02:18:24,250
I'm just a poor noob.

1799
02:18:24,390 --> 02:18:26,510
Wait, this one is one, two, like that.

1800
02:18:26,610 --> 02:18:28,130
And then three, so it's safe.

1801
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:31,290
Double one, two.

1802
02:18:31,830 --> 02:18:32,290
One, two.

1803
02:18:32,390 --> 02:18:33,130
Well, I don't have the three.

1804
02:18:34,830 --> 02:18:37,290
robs you the joy of pure gameplay fun.

1805
02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:39,730
Really?

1806
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:46,390
Isn't that like how you're supposed to get better at the
game and learn how to do things?

1807
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:56,350
Good luck you can clear all the threes on the right side,
but you will need to use process of elimination based on

1808
02:18:56,350 --> 02:18:58,250
location of the bombs with the numbers next to it.

1809
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:01,150
Huh?

1810
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:03,630
Huh?

1811
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:14,340
Oh wait, I was gonna say actually we could do that nope I
almost got toot again thank you for your help I forgot you

1812
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:25,540
became a super expert from playing expert mode once last
week sorry sorry to hit pedal to hit pedal moment

1813
02:19:36,210 --> 02:19:40,550
oh this too that was my impression of a car

1814
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:48,860
And then two is safe.

1815
02:19:58,840 --> 02:19:59,560
So accurate.

1816
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:12,220
Now it's your transmission going.

1817
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,790
Uh-oh.

1818
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:23,310
This two is also okay.

1819
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:26,050
It sounds very fast.

1820
02:20:26,250 --> 02:20:26,670
It is!

1821
02:20:26,830 --> 02:20:27,230
It is!

1822
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:28,310
Whoops, there we go.

1823
02:20:28,770 --> 02:20:28,790
Oh!

1824
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:30,650
Big moves, big moves.

1825
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:33,630
Big moves, everybody.

1826
02:20:33,790 --> 02:20:34,530
Big moves.

1827
02:20:37,290 --> 02:20:38,750
Yes, yeah.

1828
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:40,510
Oh, uh, yes!

1829
02:20:46,210 --> 02:20:48,130
Someone told me.

1830
02:20:50,250 --> 02:20:51,270
The Minto Mobile.

1831
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:54,390
The Minto Pinto, except that should not happen to the Minto
Pinto.

1832
02:20:55,270 --> 02:20:57,870
Minto Pinto will live a long and healthy life.

1833
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:01,950
We got this one right here.

1834
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:08,940
You're a suit.

1835
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:14,460
Did you know that this game was originally developed by Mine
S.

1836
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:16,960
Weeper back in 1967?

1837
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:18,240
Don't say that yet.

1838
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,980
The Bite of 67.

1839
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:21,540
Debbie Rye voice.

1840
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:23,460
She's really good.

1841
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:42,020
One, two, three.

1842
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:45,840
One, two, three.

1843
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:50,260
Did I do that right?

1844
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:52,120
Scared.

1845
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:53,480
Nervous.

1846
02:21:56,740 --> 02:21:58,960
I'm shaking in my booties right now.

1847
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:07,040
One, two.

1848
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:13,600
Good so far.

1849
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:14,420
Thanks.

1850
02:22:16,140 --> 02:22:17,640
Me, the minto of the mines, sweet burino.

1851
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,140
What is your wisdom of the day?

1852
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:22,940
My wisdom is...

1853
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:24,840
Eat salt and drink water.

1854
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:34,500
The Ford Pinto exploded whenever someone hit the back
because that was where the gas tank was.

1855
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:37,820
It never happened to the Minto Pinto.

1856
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:45,780
The advanced technique in Mind Sweeper is actually just like
in Nonograms, where you can color the tiles in between

1857
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:46,940
possible extremes.

1858
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:52,500
If you look at possible bomb locations, you may find some
tiles that are guaranteed even if you don't know the rest.

1859
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:55,560
But Nonograms make a picture.

1860
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:59,020
And sometimes I can guess.

1861
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:03,140
Instructions unclear, drank seawater.

1862
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:04,300
Oh do!

1863
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:06,840
that.

1864
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:08,500
Silly willy.

1865
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:11,360
You're too silly.

1866
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:15,020
Seawater will make you hallucinant and then you'll see
mermaids.

1867
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:18,420
Which might be kind of cool.

1868
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:20,360
Nah, don't look at this message.

1869
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:20,720
No!

1870
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:21,180
Ah!

1871
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:25,280
Arrk, my mind.

1872
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:33,190
I want to see mermaids.

1873
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:35,670
I can siren you.

1874
02:23:37,430 --> 02:23:38,930
Coming to the world.

1875
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:57,270
Water It's just the right temperature You know you wanna
swim in the water It feels really nice Come into the water,

1876
02:23:57,730 --> 02:24:04,590
you cute little sailor I'll show you how to swim

1877
02:24:09,110 --> 02:24:10,710
Follow me.

1878
02:24:11,470 --> 02:24:14,410
You'll never see your family again.

1879
02:24:18,350 --> 02:24:20,230
Guys, I'm jumping in.

1880
02:24:20,630 --> 02:24:21,230
Blub, blub, blub.

1881
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:22,870
Not to swimming.

1882
02:24:24,390 --> 02:24:28,470
Where can I download Min Toes 95 to play this game?

1883
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:30,630
Why?

1884
02:24:30,830 --> 02:24:33,490
I play on minesweeperonline.com.

1885
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:37,370
Very easy.

1886
02:24:38,190 --> 02:24:47,150
Oh, oh, I was to say we could do this three but we cannot oh
this two is good though so we can do the three yippee safe

1887
02:24:47,150 --> 02:25:00,790
safe oh okay look at that everybody should think i'm cute
crash broken ship noises planks flying around

1888
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:06,530
Whambo!

1889
02:25:07,790 --> 02:25:08,410
Kyaambo!

1890
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:12,050
And then this three has to be like this, right?

1891
02:25:12,390 --> 02:25:13,730
Because one, two, three.

1892
02:25:14,410 --> 02:25:15,470
Which means one is safe.

1893
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:16,870
Two is safe.

1894
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,230
Two is safe again.

1895
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:21,210
Ugh!

1896
02:25:25,070 --> 02:25:27,670
One, two, three!

1897
02:25:29,210 --> 02:25:30,610
Two is safe.

1898
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:36,310
Let's see, let's do this abs.

1899
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:38,770
Look, they got an 8-pack up going on here.

1900
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:42,890
Look, if it were right underneath the Smiley, that would be
so good.

1901
02:25:43,390 --> 02:25:45,410
It would look just like an 8-pack on him.

1902
02:25:46,850 --> 02:25:49,050
Mr. Smiley, you've been working out.

1903
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:54,230
You've been working out, huh?

1904
02:25:55,010 --> 02:25:58,930
All right, this 2 has to be like this.

1905
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:00,350
1, 2.

1906
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:22,130
which means this three is safe one, two, three and then one,
two okay, we don't know yet we don't know yet wait no one,

1907
02:26:26,530 --> 02:26:34,460
two this, oh wait, no the three is not safe It's always
these parts that get me tough!

1908
02:26:40,170 --> 02:26:41,290
Oh wait, this three is safe.

1909
02:26:41,390 --> 02:26:42,670
Okay, here we go.

1910
02:26:43,250 --> 02:26:44,350
One, two, three.

1911
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:48,530
Wait, one, two, three, four.

1912
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:49,730
Like so.

1913
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:52,390
Right?

1914
02:26:55,490 --> 02:26:58,910
Possibly the first time in history someone has looked at
mine sweeper and thought, abs.

1915
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:05,030
They should make this game easier for me specifically.

1916
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:09,150
I want it to be where you reveal a picture underneath.

1917
02:27:09,870 --> 02:27:13,130
And it preferably be a naked anime lady.

1918
02:27:15,170 --> 02:27:17,050
That would really get me motivated.

1919
02:27:19,770 --> 02:27:21,030
One, two, three.

1920
02:27:25,710 --> 02:27:26,550
See, like, how are you?

1921
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:32,190
Oh, it has to be this one.

1922
02:27:34,010 --> 02:27:35,870
It's not, this is the safe one.

1923
02:27:35,870 --> 02:27:37,070
Ah, I did

1924
02:27:47,270 --> 02:27:47,910
it.

1925
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:52,880
Woohoo!

1926
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:55,240
Okay, nice, very good.

1927
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,440
Where should I go to now?

1928
02:27:58,500 --> 02:27:58,800
Hmm.

1929
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:06,740
She's learning in streamer mode.

1930
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:09,640
Streamer mode is on.

1931
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:24,780
You need to be on the design team for video games.

1932
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:25,580
I agree.

1933
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:27,820
Binary Ghost, thank you for all the super chats.

1934
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:28,360
Thank you!

1935
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:42,200
You can use the logic with the 222 on the right To know it's
middle and bottom Oh, like this Ah, I see, I see Like, so,

1936
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:43,080
oh wait

1937
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:51,880
Where is your motivation?

1938
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:01,480
I'm probably not sure there's probably an Edelgiver of Mind
Sweeper.

1939
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:13,550
I think these ones confuse me the most because my brain is
always just like it could go any type of way I feel.

1940
02:29:15,070 --> 02:29:17,050
Andrew, thank you so much for the red!

1941
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:17,950
Hello, hello!

1942
02:29:18,990 --> 02:29:19,950
Welcome in.

1943
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:22,630
I claim VTubers as my dependents.

1944
02:29:24,750 --> 02:29:26,130
Oh, thank you.

1945
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:31,390
The bottom 311 is easier.

1946
02:29:38,220 --> 02:29:39,840
Because it's like this, right?

1947
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:42,820
Because we already have the one, two.

1948
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:44,680
And it has to be connecting.

1949
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:46,560
It has to be...

1950
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:48,740
Well, this is where I...

1951
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:48,900
Okay.

1952
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,720
This is where I get confused, though.

1953
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:52,080
There I go.

1954
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:53,260
Thank you so much for the fact you did.

1955
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:55,420
Like, why couldn't it be this?

1956
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,940
Oh, and then like this.

1957
02:29:58,720 --> 02:29:59,140
You know?

1958
02:30:05,650 --> 02:30:07,190
That's why I get confused.

1959
02:30:10,930 --> 02:30:12,830
But which block is always safe?

1960
02:30:15,070 --> 02:30:16,270
Oh, this one?

1961
02:30:22,990 --> 02:30:23,350
Save.

1962
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:31,330
Game dev Ibu, who is making a Minto Mind Sweeper, change it
to an Edo Game version.

1963
02:30:32,250 --> 02:30:33,210
Wait, wait, wait.

1964
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:38,860
Or you could change it to just a full Edo Game version.

1965
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:39,440
Yeah, that's okay.

1966
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:40,300
It doesn't have to be me.

1967
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,980
I'm starting to disintegrate.

1968
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:57,440
Because I'm hungry.

1969
02:30:58,740 --> 02:30:59,220
Okay.

1970
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,520
I feel like the two doesn't help so much.

1971
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:26,080
You

1972
02:31:30,230 --> 02:31:33,290
can use the same technique to solve the left.

1973
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:35,930
Up here?

1974
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:52,910
But there's so many.

1975
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:08,020
Use the MGS mind detector.

1976
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:09,120
I wish.

1977
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:23,780
lots of ones is good though yeah that's true well I mean yes
ones are good because they're easier to figure out I feel

1978
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:26,860
but right now I'm kind of stumped

1979
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:48,130
start from the top okay could be this or this well that's
the thing it's like I feel like for all of these I could be

1980
02:32:48,130 --> 02:32:56,450
like is this or this is this or this wait okay hold on if I
just I'm just gonna mark for my own visual i'm a visual

1981
02:32:56,450 --> 02:33:15,300
learner so it couldn't be this it can't be like alternating
right like you have to be one two one two like that top one

1982
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:30,040
means the third isn't one that's true oh i get okay okay
okay okay okay i i it's it's clicking little by little

1983
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:33,820
little by little so now if I erase

1984
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:47,520
these little by little so this guy has to oh wait no he
doesn't have to be okay okay oh because there's already one

1985
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:52,140
bomb where the three and two are on the bottom right to
complete the three there has to be a bomb above or below the

1986
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:57,640
That means the three squares to the right of the two are
safe.

1987
02:33:58,180 --> 02:33:58,520
The three?

1988
02:33:59,040 --> 02:33:59,720
Oh, the three?

1989
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:00,280
Huh?

1990
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:13,630
So there's a bomb here or here?

1991
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:16,090
Oh, you went this way!

1992
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:17,650
Vertical, not horizontal!

1993
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:25,080
Okay, okay.

1994
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:29,520
I'm like, what do you mean?

1995
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:44,140
that's crazy that's so much thought wow hello meeto today I
cosplayed you at hooters and converted the waitress into an

1996
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:51,300
eye booth she has no idea what a youtuber is probably oh my
gosh it went to hooters if you were dressed as me then

1997
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:57,620
technically that means I've been to hooters right what'd you
get what'd you eat

1998
02:35:04,890 --> 02:35:09,230
alright let's see Okay, I want to keep going back to this
one, though, because I'm trying to figure it out a little

1999
02:35:09,230 --> 02:35:09,750
bit.

2000
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:25,930
So we cleared it up a little bit.

2001
02:35:29,710 --> 02:35:30,950
The wings were okay.

2002
02:35:35,030 --> 02:35:37,310
When are we getting a live stream from Hooters?

2003
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:38,550
Hooters collab?

2004
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:52,270
For leftmost one, the top or bottom must be one, corners.

2005
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:55,330
So the left of them must be safe.

2006
02:35:57,250 --> 02:36:12,530
like oh okay I get it I get it oh you're right okay like
that I see I see I see I see why is it gotta be a 4 it's so

2007
02:36:12,530 --> 02:36:22,510
high wait but this one is also this oh wait just kidding
sorry oh my gosh how well so much okay so then

2008
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:46,160
but it doesn't can I apply the same logic my brain hurts me
too

2009
02:36:51,960 --> 02:37:06,490
and then because but for the four we can do that because
it's still gonna be somewhere in the corners here okay okay

2010
02:37:06,490 --> 02:37:10,430
okay Booters is just America's version of Big Cafe, exactly!

2011
02:37:13,130 --> 02:37:14,290
Oh,

2012
02:37:22,450 --> 02:37:23,610
Big Bird.

2013
02:37:24,650 --> 02:37:26,210
No, no.

2014
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:29,490
I'm still... still confused.

2015
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:33,570
I'm still like...

2016
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:33,970
Huh?

2017
02:37:34,730 --> 02:37:35,250
You know?

2018
02:37:40,850 --> 02:37:43,170
But here...

2019
02:37:44,690 --> 02:37:46,670
I think...

2020
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:06,180
this is where i'm trying to figure it out because it can't
be like boom boom you know to hit up everything because then

2021
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:23,700
it doesn't work with this guy so uh the two threes on the
left left the bottom threes i'm on it confuses me i'm i'm on

2022
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:30,600
ones i'm not thinking twos and threes I'm on ones.

2023
02:38:37,150 --> 02:38:39,330
Which by the fours are definitely mines?

2024
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:42,650
Well, like, this one would be one.

2025
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:45,350
Or see, I'm like, is it this one or this one?

2026
02:38:51,250 --> 02:38:52,370
Wait, okay, hold on.

2027
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:56,250
For this four, it has to be this one, these three.

2028
02:38:56,690 --> 02:38:58,330
It has to be boom, boom, boom.

2029
02:38:58,850 --> 02:39:00,410
So those are those are three.

2030
02:39:00,730 --> 02:39:00,730
Okay.

2031
02:39:01,210 --> 02:39:01,710
Wait, no.

2032
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:03,210
Well, yes.

2033
02:39:03,730 --> 02:39:04,170
Right?

2034
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:04,970
Yeah.

2035
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:06,930
Because It can't be boom and boom.

2036
02:39:07,990 --> 02:39:08,210
Yes.

2037
02:39:08,590 --> 02:39:09,130
Yes, yes.

2038
02:39:09,230 --> 02:39:09,810
Okay, that is it.

2039
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,190
That is it.

2040
02:39:10,410 --> 02:39:11,730
That is what I deduced.

2041
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:14,910
Yes.

2042
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:25,240
Then,

2043
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:36,180
now the three above it.

2044
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:38,280
Like this three?

2045
02:39:39,160 --> 02:40:04,400
well but how how it has to touch the one so oh wait wait
sorry these two are safe yes and then this one is safe and

2046
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:15,280
so I'm guessing it's this and this and this is I was
incorrect.

2047
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:22,010
Oopsie.

2048
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:25,890
Well, I learned a valuable lesson.

2049
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:30,810
I learned a valuable lesson.

2050
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:35,190
Dang it.

2051
02:40:35,710 --> 02:40:38,130
Your honor roll just rolled a bit too fast.

2052
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:44,250

2053
02:40:47,270 --> 02:40:48,930

2054
02:40:54,290 --> 02:41:01,590
that's okay my goal for 2026 is to be mine sweeper meow
tower gives us bad guessing habits no!

2055
02:41:02,230 --> 02:41:04,750
Meow tower would never I never guessed in meow tower

2056
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:15,820
value a boo lesson well guys I'm gonna end it here so that I
can go eat.

2057
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:18,140
But thank you for helping me again.

2058
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:20,440
I feel like I'm getting a little bit of the strats.

2059
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:22,400
I feel like I'm definitely...

2060
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:24,540
My brain is expanding.

2061
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:27,380
It's growing one wrinkle at a time.

2062
02:41:27,820 --> 02:41:31,480
I'm not like the Grinch where my heart grows three sizes in
one session.

2063
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:34,920
My brain will grow one wrinkle per session.

2064
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:36,140
So please understand.

2065
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:40,980
But thank you!

2066
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:43,480
I feel like we didn't play so much of the game.

2067
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:45,360
I feel like I yapped for so long.

2068
02:41:46,460 --> 02:41:49,260
I feel like I yapped more than I played, but that's okay.

2069
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:50,500
Wait, wait, wait!

2070
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:51,400
Hold on, guys.

2071
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:54,400
I'm gonna do the Metal Gear method again.

2072
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:56,480
Watch this.

2073
02:42:00,970 --> 02:42:01,490
Sweep!

2074
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:03,630
Ah!

2075
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,720
Watch this, watch this.

2076
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:11,100
Sweep!

2077
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:16,270
Oh!

2078
02:42:22,750 --> 02:42:23,590
Hello,

2079
02:42:52,040 --> 02:42:52,580
it's me.

2080
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:54,360
Minto from the hospital.

2081
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:57,960
Sorry, my lungs are filled with...

2082
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,600
Uh, gas.

2083
02:43:02,820 --> 02:43:04,040
What you mean to everybody?

2084
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:08,400
And remember, always, stay sweeping.
