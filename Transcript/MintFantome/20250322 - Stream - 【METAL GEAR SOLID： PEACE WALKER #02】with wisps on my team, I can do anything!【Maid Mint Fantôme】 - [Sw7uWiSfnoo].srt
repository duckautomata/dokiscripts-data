00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,620
Hello Soldiers!

2
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
Welcome back!

3
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,060
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid!

4
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,940
Please welcome!

5
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

6
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,820
Chow, Chow, Chow Mater!

7
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,140
Please!

8
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,040
Wait a second!

9
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,740
There we go.

10
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,640
We can watch, I guess, the intro.

11
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,960
But I want to... I always... I want to talk first.

12
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,480
Vic Boss!

13
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,120
Vic Boss!

14
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,980
We're not there yet.

15
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,440
We will be there, eventually.

16
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,620
Welcome back.

17
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,620
Today is going to be fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!

18
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,340
We're...

19
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Thank you for joining... Oh my goodness.

20
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
Thank you for... It doesn't even let me talk for like 2 seconds.

21
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,600
Thank you for joining on Nemi's charity stream.

22
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,380
Much love.

23
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,720
Thank you!

24
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,820
Kashimoto, thank you so much for the super chat.

25
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,780
I had a lot of fun.

26
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,140
Here, I'm just gonna... Here, we'll watch the intro first and then I'll talk.

27
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,940
The game keeps interrupting me.

28
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,200
We'll talk after.

29
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,180
Oh my god, it's Kaz!

30
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,520
That's my girl!

31
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,420
That's my girl!

32
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,220
Yeah, Amanda!

33
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,940
Chico!

34
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,280
We rescued him last time.

35
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,980
Cecile!

36
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,920
Never heard from again.

37
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,880
Stranger!

38
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,180
We

39
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,430
might be seeing some of these today.

40
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,110
Oh, Bali.

41
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,750
That's my boss.

42
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,610
So serious.

43
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,530
Hatsune Miku!

44
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,910
I love the peace.

45
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,650
I love the peace.

46
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,050
I love the peace!

47
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,490
Alright.

48
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,430
Oh my gosh, the intro.

49
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,330
I love the new theme.

50
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,710
I can't get over it.

51
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,010
I can't get over it.

52
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,950
And my favorite of all, lively dead maid.

53
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,130
Would that be my Kojima name?

54
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,910
How was the audio by the way?

55
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,430
I didn't check at all when I was playing.

56
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,670
I did not look.

57
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,270
Good?

58
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,450
It's okay?

59
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:18,790
Okay.

60
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,670
Cool.

61
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,350
Cool, cool, cool.

62
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,010
Peace Walker is one of my most favorite games.

63
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,130
Me too!

64
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,870
I love Peace Walker.

65
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:36,710
I feel it's a little underrated in the Metal Gear sphere.

66
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,070
But it's so good.

67
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,350
Oh my gosh, it's for real.

68
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,310
It's always up there whenever I talk about my favorite Metal Gear games.

69
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,970
It's so, so good.

70
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,590
Oh, it's so, so good.

71
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,490
Everything about it, I love it.

72
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:52,950
Yeah.

73
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,530
There would be no V without PW.

74
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,170
Exactly, exactly.

75
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,790
I mentioned this in pre-chat.

76
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,330
I probably should have been doing the extra missions in Peace Walker.

77
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,670
To like get through those off stream.

78
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,790
But instead, I've just been playing a bunch of Ground Zeroes.

79
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,370
I don't know, I just had this itch to play Ground Zeroes again.

80
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,550
And so I've just been doing it.

81
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,630
Because when I get, when we finish Peace Walker and we do Ground Zeroes.

82
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,770
I was like...

83
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,630
So how I want to do it is...

84
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,270
I want to do the main mission, obviously.

85
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,050
And then there's two...

86
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,790
No, sorry, three other missions that I want to do.

87
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,870
I feel like we could do it all in one stream.

88
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,290
Probably.

89
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,770
But um...

90
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,350
Yeah.

91
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,030
So...

92
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,850
Whenever I talk about Metal Gear series, I really go silent when this part of the convo comes up.

93
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,650
I guess I can only...

94
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,990
Is that about what I talked about last week?

95
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,070
But uh...

96
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,930
There's three missions that I want to do in Ground Zeroes.

97
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,950
And I unlocked two of them yesterday.

98
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,370
Because you have to get some special stuff.

99
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,650
You have to do some extra things to unlock them.

100
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,770
So I did that yesterday.

101
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,790
While watching Nemi Nightmare.

102
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,510
While watching Nemi Nightmare.

103
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,710
So...

104
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,810
Yeah, Peace Walker...

105
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,690
Not Peace Walker, sorry.

106
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,770
Ground Zeroes is like super duper...

107
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,090
We can do it super duper easily.

108
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,590
I say easily, I'm probably setting myself up for failure there.

109
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,750
We can do it super duper quickly.

110
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,770
I think one of the missions...

111
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,770
I'm purposefully not doing them off stream.

112
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,770
I'll do them on stream.

113
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,990
Though I know about them.

114
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,550
But I have not done them before.

115
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,750
So it will be my first time playing them.

116
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,390
I was on Nemi's stream yesterday.

117
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,570
She did her 8 hour charity stream for Little Bean.

118
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,070
And I was there.

119
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,230
We played Age of Empires together.

120
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,430
And oh my gosh, it was actually our first time talking in a voice call together.

121
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,470
So when she called me, I was like...

122
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,070
Nemi Nightmare is...

123
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,230
She's in my ears.

124
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,090
I can hear her directly.

125
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,890
So it was really special.

126
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,170
And I was really nervous.

127
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,510
But she was so cute.

128
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,570
And I was happy.

129
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,530
I'm always happy when I get to collab with my Oshies.

130
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,590
So now I've played Age of Empires 2 with two of my Oshies.

131
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,550
I don't know how this keeps happening.

132
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,030
I hope Nemi didn't scare you away with the Dota talk.

133
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,290
No!

134
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,730
Actually I'm catching flack.

135
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,490
I've seen some people clipping.

136
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,130
And I saw some people posting it on Twitter.

137
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,250
And I saw people being like...

138
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,210
Wow, how does that other girl not know what Dota is?

139
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,450
And I'm like...

140
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,890
Oh, sorry.

141
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,070
Sorry, I have TASTE!

142
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,250
No, I'm just kidding.

143
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,590
But I don't know MOBA at all.

144
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,030
I don't do anything like that.

145
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,410
I don't know.

146
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,930
I had a weird dream where...

147
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,190
Sorry, I'm reading an old super chat.

148
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,850
I had a weird dream where all the VTuber idols went to war.

149
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,310
And I was dressed up as Snake fighting Doki dressed up as Liquid.

150
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,590
It's weird because you're usually Venom Snake.

151
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,930
I don't want to be Venom Snake.

152
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,630
I'd rather be Solid Snake.

153
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,870
I only chose Venom for my Twitter profile.

154
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,270
Because...

155
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:06,870
Because...

156
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,490
It's funny.

157
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,370
Thank you for not knowing about MOBAs.

158
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,530
This is why you're my OC.

159
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,790
You know, I have other garbage tastes in games.

160
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,670
And...

161
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,970
Yeah, so...

162
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,370
It all works out, right?

163
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,770
Everybody's got to have their guilty pleasure, you know?

164
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,410
Mine is what we're playing today.

165
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,770
Actually, I'm going to scoot down just a tad.

166
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,710
And...

167
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,450
Come on guys, she plays Chillas.

168
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,750
Yeah, bad horror games are my guilty pleasure.

169
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,170
You're not guilty?

170
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,550
I'm 100% guilty.

171
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,550
I admit that.

172
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,350
One second.

173
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,010
There we go.

174
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,770
Metal Gear Solid and Ace Combat over Dota.

175
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,810
Good game on AoE too, by the way.

176
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,690
So many people just crumble when they get attacked, but you held the fort until the elephants arrived.

177
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,650
I tried!

178
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,190
I tried!

179
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,810
Why does this keep happening to me?

180
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,230
Why do the enemies keep coming to me?

181
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,390
It's like I have a sweet blood or something.

182
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,110
The little mosquitoes keep coming to me.

183
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:33,870
Why?

184
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,750
Did you name your cat Paz because of Paz Tapes?

185
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,030
What?

186
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,810
Was Nuke the cat ever an option?

187
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,110
Will I

188
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,400
ever play MGS Survival?

189
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,040
I want to, actually.

190
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,880
I want to because...

191
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,380
Because...

192
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,160
There was...

193
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,300
No, there is...

194
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,080
There is a guy I know.

195
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,400
His name is Fingers.

196
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,600
He actually helped with music for Freak or Treat.

197
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,700
The game that I made.

198
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
And he likes Survive.

199
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,160
So I want to get him and Berry Bug and Maddy.

200
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,860
I want us to all do a group.

201
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,580
And he teaches us how to play Survive to the optimal ability.

202
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,370
So, yeah.

203
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,730
Fingers mentioned.

204
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:42,890
Yeah.

205
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,670
How to survive, survive.

206
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,450
So, load game.

207
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,150
Did

208
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,530
you see?

209
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,890
There is a new maid coming soon.

210
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,390
Crony is finally getting a maid outfit.

211
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,190
Nice.

212
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,690
Okay.

213
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,950
So we built Mother Base.

214
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,290
Up a little.

215
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,430
Oh my gosh.

216
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,810
Thank you for all the superchats, you guys.

217
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,310
I took my cat to the vet for a checkup.

218
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,390
She was mad.

219
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,190
How do your cats handle the vet?

220
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,430
They are usually fine after I take them, but they don't like...

221
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,710
Neither of my cats like riding in the car or being in the crate or anything.

222
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,390
If an enemy makes you think about Dota, you can get her to play MGS.

223
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,650
That's only fair.

224
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,630
Maybe.

225
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,110
She said so herself.

226
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,590
She's not a retro...

227
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,590
She's not a retro streamer.

228
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,910
Yeah, do I have any gifts?

229
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,590
I sure hope so.

230
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:57,690
Inbox!

231
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,210
It's okay.

232
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,950
It's okay.

233
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,260
It's okay.

234
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,540
It's okay.

235
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,940
It's okay.

236
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,900
It's okay.

237
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,770
So let's check out our...

238
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,900
Our people.

239
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
Yeah, I got a million...

240
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,140
A million fan letters and gifts from everybody.

241
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,020
I got so many.

242
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,300
A ton of them.

243
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,220
They're all from Big Boss.

244
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,200
He said you're my number one soldier.

245
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,220
He said you're the coolest and prettiest and smartest and strongest.

246
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,220
Hold on, I'm reading the note right now.

247
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:44,500
And did I mention cutest and funniest and most awesomest soldier on Mother Base?

248
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,440
I couldn't have Mother Base without you.

249
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,260
You are the glue that holds us together.

250
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,700
You are the blood to my mosquito.

251
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,960
Thank you for being here, Mint Phantom.

252
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,620
Love, Big Boss.

253
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,000
And then there's a kissy mark.

254
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,840
We meet the legendary staff member.

255
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,860
Yeah, we gotta meet Leech.

256
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,960
Leech Walker.

257
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,620
Alright, let's just get into it, I suppose.

258
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,660
Yeah, he put on his finest lipstick for this letter.

259
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,060
Monster Hunter Connections is how I got some friends and Oshis to consider playing Metal Gear Peace Walker because of co-op.

260
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,460
Really?

261
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,480
But you also just gotta play it, no?

262
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
Ducky, thank you so much for the five gifted.

263
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
Yeah, I should have done these.

264
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
I should have done these.

265
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,400
I should have done these off stream.

266
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,360
I should have done these.

267
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,600
What's wrong with me?

268
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,440
Dab chick.

269
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh my gosh, I forgot about dab chick.

270
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,520
Marksmanship challenge.

271
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,180
Let's do target practice to get me back into that.

272
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
Oh my gosh, the little guns is a treat.

273
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,800
Why are you yelling at me, Master Miller?

274
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,820
Gosh.

275
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,380
Oh my gosh, Jack.

276
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,700
Welcome to membership.

277
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,260
Did Big Boss also practice kissing paper?

278
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:40,860
Probably.

279
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,700
Mint is cute and funny.

280
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,300
Thanks.

281
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,620
Mission prep.

282
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,920
Yeah, this is fine.

283
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,640
Alright.

284
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,920
It's fine, it's fine.

285
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,460
I just gotta practice.

286
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,660
Listen up, for us there is no victory.

287
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,300
He's so concise.

288
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,660
He's so...

289
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,440
Thank you.

290
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,060
I don't...OK, hold on.

291
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,660
Yeah, there we go.

292
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,940
Let's do that, baby.

293
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,400
Bing bong.

294
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,900
Where is it?

295
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,360
Oh, you.

296
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,120
Sorry.

297
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,860
Bing bong.

298
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,740
No, there is one right here.

299
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,680
What are you talking about?

300
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,820
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

301
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,140
Barely scraped by.

302
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,400
Oh no.

303
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,380
Oops, shoot, shoot.

304
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,620
I'm hugging him.

305
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,220
Bing bong.

306
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,280
This guy?

307
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,240
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

308
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,780
Where are they?

309
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,240
There's more?

310
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,700
I heard one.

311
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,240
Oh my gosh.

312
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
Dang, I got him.

313
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,580
Not really.

314
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,040
Anyone else?

315
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Want a piece of me?

316
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,680
There he is.

317
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,680
Where?

318
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,340
Where?

319
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,360
Codename Big Phantom.

320
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,680
Thank you.

321
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,440
Over here?

322
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,780
Oh, I think I have to climb up.

323
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,640
I'm so silly.

324
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,880
You always do the target range one?

325
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,300
Yeah, I thought that's what this was.

326
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,020
Boss.

327
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,680
Boss, I'm lost.

328
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,920
Boss, where do I climb?

329
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,800
No, just kidding.

330
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,960
Good luck with the target window.

331
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Thank you!

332
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,060
Is there a ladder?

333
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,900
On the other side?

334
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, I see it.

335
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,440
I see it.

336
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,300
I thought it would be... Oh my gosh.

337
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,120
I thought it would be like against the wall.

338
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,360
You know what I mean?

339
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,230
Bing bong.

340
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,770
I've been a little spoiled because I've been playing Ground Zeroes with my mouse.

341
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,750
And guys, I get crazy headshots.

342
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,350
I'm just letting you know I'm kind of cracked.

343
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,570
I'm kind of insane.

344
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,410
Dang it.

345
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,030
I'm kind of awesome.

346
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,350
Dang it!

347
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,970
So close!

348
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:42,330
I know they're headshots too because I get like a little thing that says new long range headshot.

349
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,890
I know it's a headshot too.

350
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,890
It says you got a headshot.

351
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,090
Oh there you are.

352
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,170
Right in the mouth.

353
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,410
Made him look like that.

354
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,690
Boom, headshot.

355
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,590
Kind of.

356
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,150
That was like a cheek shot.

357
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,710
But the front cheek.

358
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,770
Not the back cheek.

359
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,670
Nice.

360
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,870
You hit all the targets in your booth.

361
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,410
Move on to the next one.

362
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:09,950
Okay.

363
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,570
What's the next one?

364
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,090
Oh there it is.

365
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,270
I see him.

366
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,670
I got you.

367
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,590
We're going to get right in the center.

368
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:23,690
Nice.

369
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,270
You hit all the targets in your booth.

370
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,870
Move on to the next one.

371
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,690
That's it though, right?

372
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,150
What do you mean the next one?

373
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,090
There's more?

374
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,580
There's more?

375
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,140
I think I've done enough practice.

376
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,380
No?

377
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,600
I think we're good.

378
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,720
What's the goal of this game right now?

379
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,900
Oh this is what I'm doing at this current moment?

380
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,360
Practice.

381
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,620
Practice.

382
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,440
Thank you for the superchat!

383
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,740
Good luck getting into Metal Gear.

384
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,200
You better hold your promise.

385
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,200
You better actually be serious if that's why you're not watching.

386
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,200
You better give me a progress report.

387
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,820
You better say... There's something else here.

388
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,580
Kaz, what are you talking about?

389
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Okay, I'm leaving.

390
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,960
Training exercise complete.

391
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:44,930
Alright.

392
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,990
Clear rank.

393
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,190
Infinity.

394
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,850
There's a free camo in the target practice.

395
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,550
One for folks.

396
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:03,550
What?

397
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,210
Seriously?

398
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,790
There is?

399
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,370
Not bad Minto.

400
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,370
Thanks.

401
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,670
There is?

402
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,070
Number one?

403
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,070
Target practice one.

404
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,770
Which is this?

405
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,570
Oh this is the...

406
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,510
Should we make a room?

407
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,010
I love that he...I love that he calls it a special treat.

408
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,890
He knows it so well.

409
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,590
As a special treat.

410
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,750
Anybody wanna target practice with me?

411
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,190
Global.

412
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:49,790
Okay.

413
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,370
Come on in.

414
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm just gonna start.

415
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,340
Oh, just kidding.

416
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,640
Yeah, it's fine.

417
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,580
Protect the boss?

418
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,080
It's a shooting range.

419
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,320
Should be fine though.

420
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,320
Can we...Is there friendly fire?

421
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,620
Is there friendly fire?

422
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,600
Can you guys be my...my practice?

423
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,900
I told my bank a secret about you but it got out all over town.

424
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,260
Turns out there were a lot of tellers.

425
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,580
How dare!

426
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,720
Loose lips sink ships.

427
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,300
And banks.

428
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,520
I dug a big hole underneath the bank.

429
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,880
And it will sink.

430
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,140
In two days time.

431
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,040
Oh, pink bag!

432
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,420
When you're done, head over to the exit.

433
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,780
Alright everybody!

434
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Are you okay?

435
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,270
Let's see.

436
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,590
Wait.

437
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,370
Hold on.

438
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,430
Wait, how do I...That's auto-aim.

439
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,390
How do I fight again?

440
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,010
Oh gosh.

441
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:50,830
Hold on.

442
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,010
How do I do CQC?

443
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,490
It sounds like he's saying make out.

444
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,050
Make out.

445
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,630
Make out.

446
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,550
Make out.

447
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,810
Wait, I don't...Oh gosh.

448
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,710
Group A.

449
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,070
No.

450
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,010
How do I...Gosh, sorry guys.

451
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,510
I'm trying to remember how to CQC.

452
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,670
Oh, RT.

453
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,610
Do it.

454
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,970
Do it.

455
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,270
Do it.

456
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:34,790
Do it.

457
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,110
Do it.

458
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,010
Why isn't it not working?

459
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,470
Sneak in.

460
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:44,970
Sneak out.

461
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,770
That's so funny.

462
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,550
Press and hold RT.

463
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,610
That's what I'm doing.

464
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,430
Why isn't it working?

465
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:02,810
Sneak in.

466
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,210
Sneak out.

467
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,910
Sneak in.

468
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,350
Sneak out.

469
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:04,770
Sneak in.

470
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,230
Sneak in.

471
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,490
Sneak in.

472
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,720
Sneak in.

473
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Sneak in.

474
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,180
This is so stupid.

475
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,900
Why is there a training?

476
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,460
When is it going to turn on?

477
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,240
Commence!

478
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,800
When does it turn on?

479
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,160
Oh!

480
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,080
Oh!

481
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,180
Let's turn it on!

482
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,060
Hey, hold on!

483
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,720
I'm gonna get the most.

484
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,800
I'm gonna get the most.

485
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,600
Oh, nobody got it.

486
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,080
I'm gonna get the most.

487
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,500
Gonna get the most.

488
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm gonna get the most.

489
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm gonna get the most.

490
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,610
I'm gonna get the most.

491
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,990
I got him.

492
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,530
I got him.

493
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,090
I got him.

494
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,790
I'm gonna get the most.

495
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,510
Why does he disappear?

496
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,130
Oh, shoot.

497
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,630
He's right in front of me, isn't he?

498
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,820
Wait, I can't see anything.

499
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,600
Why can't I see anything?

500
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,740
What changed?

501
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,660
I can't see anything.

502
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,720
Also, why am I... Oh, I'm in auto-aim, that's why.

503
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,380
Oh my gosh.

504
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,340
Oh, I'm embarrassing.

505
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,440
Me!

506
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,320
Uh-oh.

507
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:05,720
Me!

508
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,860
Me!

509
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,100
Oh, oop.

510
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,460
Me!

511
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,880
Oh, shoot.

512
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,320
Me!

513
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,380
Me!

514
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,280
Ow!

515
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,460
Yeah.

516
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,180
Me!

517
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, where'd he go?

518
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:20,720
Oh!

519
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,380
Oh!

520
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,880
Stop being so fast!

521
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,920
No, stop being so fast!

522
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,940
I'm on... I'm on tilt controls!

523
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:44,870
Hey.

524
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,930
Hey, you all, you never miss if you just spam it.

525
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,510
Oh, my bad.

526
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,310
I killed a person.

527
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,130
Was the Geneva Convention invented now?

528
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,750
Probably not.

529
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,850
Come

530
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,940
on, guys!

531
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,520
Spray and pray!

532
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,700
Spray and pray!

533
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,740
Yes, it was.

534
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,040
Oh.

535
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,100
After the end of World War II, the world was split in two.

536
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,580
Spray and pray!

537
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,660
Oh, oops.

538
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,540
Sometimes there are worthy sacrifices.

539
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,520
Like the people that stand in our way.

540
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,120
Spray and pray!

541
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
When is it over?

542
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,680
When is it over?

543
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,900
I got him and I didn't kill an innocent person with it too.

544
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,160
Oh, come on.

545
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,040
Let me have him!

546
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,680
Hey!

547
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,140
You took my bed!

548
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,480
You took my bed!

549
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,780
What?

550
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,140
You took my target and he was for me.

551
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,790
Are you gonna die?

552
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,410
Alright, is this never ending?

553
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,370
How long does this...

554
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:32,850
Wait, hold on.

555
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,630
Let me get the...

556
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,570
Where is the camo?

557
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,950
This area looks so familiar.

558
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,930
You missed!

559
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,390
How could you miss?

560
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,590
Don't die on me.

561
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,850
I got a T-shirt!

562
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,210
T-shirt up here everybody!

563
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,710
Come get your T-shirt!

564
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,550

570

Alright.

571
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,110
Alright, that's enough practice everybody.

572
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,910
I can't...

573
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,650
I'm not...

574
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,290
I have to be supervised on the base.

575
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,290
Shot in the head.

576
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:18,950
Thanks guys.

577
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,830
Lay there!

578
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,790
No, no, no, no!

579
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:24,930
Lay there!

580
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,330
Lay there!

581
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,250
Lay there on the ground.

582
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,910
Lay there on the ground.

583
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,190
Come here!

584
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,490
Come here!

585
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:28,990
No!

586
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,470
Come here!

587
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:29,730
Come here!

588
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,370
Alright!

589
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,490
You're laying on the ground.

590
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,330
Alright, come on.

591
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:33,650
Let's go.

592
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,350
Let's go.

593
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,290
No!

594
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,170
Let's play the game!

595
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,990
You've got to wait for backup before going any farther.

596
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,290
Come on!

597
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,630
Come on!

598
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,490
It's not over yet.

599
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,810
It is over.

600
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,270
Training exercise complete.

601
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,510
Thanks boss.

602
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:53,390
You're welcome.

603
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,390
Awesome.

604
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,290
Good job team.

605
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,130
Sorry, I was getting kind of into the shooting the targets.

606
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,390
I thought that there would...

607
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,990
I thought it would stop eventually and then give us a score.

608
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,700
No!

609
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,380
We had no camaraderie.

610
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
We had none!

611
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,360
Sad.

612
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,120
Alright, are you guys ready to play the actual game?

613
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,040
That was so funny.

614
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,240
OK.

615
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,060
Classic wisp behavior.

616
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,140
We are about to destroy the barricade.

617
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,740
We need C4 charges.

618
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,180
Oh yeah, that's right!

619
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,060
Oh gosh.

620
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,320
That's right.

621
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,600
What was the license plate of the truck?

622
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,880
I don't remember.

623
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,380
This is Mint Streams.

624
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
I go to check the mail and my Mint merch arrived!

625
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:02,980
Yay!

626
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,340
Thank you for getting it.

627
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,380
Thank you so much.

628
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,680
Oh shoot.

629
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,660
I just realized I forgot to do something.

630
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,320
I should be fine.

631
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,000
I'll fix it later.

632
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,940
It's nothing for you to worry about.

633
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,440
C4!

634
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,480
Thank you!

635
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,500
OK, obviously I'm gonna host.

636
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,300
Anybody can come in.

637
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,360
Mission prep.

638
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,640
Let's see.

639
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,800
Let's get our... would it be under weapons or items?

640
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,220
It's there, the C4.

641
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,580
C4.

642
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,360
Kiwi!

643
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,200
Burgoby.

644
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,060
Burgboy.

645
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,140
Burgboy.

646
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,680
I'm gonna call you Gurbo... Burgoby.

647
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,340
Alright, you got your C4?

648
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,480
You have your C4?

649
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,880
What's the T-shirt look like?

650
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,060
How can one man...

651
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,040
How can one man look so good in a T?

652
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Go with the T.

653
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,640
Oh my god, get this man a bra!

654
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,300
Wow!

655
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,540
Oh, he's so casual.

656
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,120
I love casual Friday.

657
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,600
OK, anyway.

658
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,100
With this Uniqlo drip.

659
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,760
Oh my gosh!

660
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,180
That would have been so cool to have the Uniqlo shirts in the games.

661
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,220
Missed opportunity for real.

662
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,580
Ready?

663
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,140
Ready Burgoby?

664
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,660
Burgoby, Gurboby, Burgoby.

665
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,510
They were?

666
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,850
They were DLC?

667
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,030
I don't remember them.

668
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:43,200
I can't remember all the camos.

669
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,720
Available.

670
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,140
Wait, which ones could you get for this game?

671
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,860
Could you get the one...

672
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,640
The white T-shirt with boss on the back?

673
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,340
The boss art?

674
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,360
That's my favorite Peace Walker shirt.

675
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,980
Actually...

676
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,820
Was there more than...

677
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,480
Yes, there were several Peace Walker shirts.

678
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,020
Because there was the one with Strange Love.

679
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,900
Oh no!

680
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,680
Burgoby, I only brought...

681
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,620
Shh, come here.

682
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,520
Shh, I have a secret.

683
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,320
I only brought...

684
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,700
I only brought weapons to kill.

685
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,400
What do I do?

686
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,940
I thought

687
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,490
I drank a gun, but I didn't.

688
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,620
That's...

689
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,360
What are you doing?

690
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,400
Okay.

691
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,620
Oopsie.

692
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,460
Oh.

693
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,940
It's all up to you.

694
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,960
I'll get the law ready.

695
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,100
I'll get the law ready.

696
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,210
You got this guy.

697
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,230
Oh, you got him.

698
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,190
You got him.

699
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,390
Burgoby, it's all up to you.

700
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:24,650
I...

701
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,730
Oh, we're taking him home.

702
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,370
Take him home.

703
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,470
Wait.

704
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,110
Oh, I need...

705
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,770
I gotta equip it.

706
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,790
I'm stupid.

707
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,610
Oh, you took him home.

708
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,830
Good job.

709
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,870
Good job.

710
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,890
Burgoby, should I use the law?

711
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,610
Bert told me you operate on Xbox.

712
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,670
I would offer my assistance, but I'm sick and monsters need hunting.

713
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:55,990
Oh.

714
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,210
Have fun with hunting!

715
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,010
You can do that in this game too.

716
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:01,570
I'm just saying.

717
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,690
But feel better also.

718
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,230
Oh, you got his ass.

719
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,970
Nice.

720
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,370
I'm gonna take him home.

721
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,850
He keeps stealing my thunder.

722
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,610
I keep hearing the beep.

723
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,610
It's kind of freaking me out.

724
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,110
I'm taking him home.

725
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,150
Here he comes.

726
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,930
There he goes.

727
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,230
At neck-breaking speed.

728
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:40,670
We're good?

729
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,450
Oh, sorry.

730
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,290
My bad.

731
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,710
Let's go.

732
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:49,970
I am the law.

733
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:50,790
I am the law.

734
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,350
I am the law.

735
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:52,590
Meow.

736
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,410
Meow.

737
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:53,710
Meow.

738
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:09,310
Oh, I see a guy up there.

739
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,230
You wanna take him out?

740
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,270
You got him.

741
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:15,490
Easy.

742
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,070
Easy.

743
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:16,850
Don't miss.

744
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:17,350
Don't miss.

745
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:17,870
Don't miss.

746
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:18,390
Don't miss.

747
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:18,870
Don't miss.

748
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:20,970
Wow.

749
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,190
Nice one.

750
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,410
Nice shot.

751
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,450
Wish we could grab him though.

752
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,410
No pressure.

753
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,270
No pressure.

754
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,510
Any other men?

755
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,210
Any other guys?

756
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,970
Wait, which way do we go?

757
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,350
Is there not a guy that's like wandering around over here?

758
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,510
There's some down here, no?

759
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:49,790
Yep, there's one.

760
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:51,290
What if I...

761
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,810
Okay, if you don't, I will.

762
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,190
You got this.

763
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:56,790
Oh, you want me to?

764
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:57,590
Okay.

765
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,950
You got this.

766
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:05,650
Oh.

767
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:06,810
One.

768
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:08,570
Ooh.

769
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:12,010
Oh, I was gonna give you the three, Borgobi!

770
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,230
I was gonna give you the three!

771
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,210
You barely made it.

772
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,320
Oh, there's another guy.

773
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,840
I'll take care of him.

774
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,420
He probably sucked.

775
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,490
Ripped that guy.

776
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,170
If he were stronger, he would be alive and then we could take him.

777
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,710
Yeah!

778
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:54,910
Yay!

779
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,350
It's this way, right?

780
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,470
Wait, west.

781
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,090
Borgobi, which way is west?

782
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:02,750
This way?

783
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,170
Which way is west?

784
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,500
That's not west!

785
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,120
West!

786
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:16,840
West!

787
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,550
Yeah!

788
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:22,630
West!

789
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,050
Weest.

790
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,830
Not weest!

791
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,500
This is uncharted...

792
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,940
No, it's not.

793
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,580
Just kidding.

794
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,260
We've been here before.

795
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,880
Here, I'll get my stun rod out, even though I don't know how to use it.

796
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,420
Okay.

797
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,760
Easy now, Borgobi.

798
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,820
I'm trusting you.

799
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,100
I'm trusting you.

800
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,620
Oh!

801
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,580
Oh, Borgobi!

802
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,960
Borgobi, we're in trouble.

803
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,360
I think I got him.

804
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,340
I think he spotted me.

805
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,080
No, you didn't.

806
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:12,860
Help!

807
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,600
Protect me!

808
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,660
I have no weapon except the law!

809
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,940
Oh my god!

810
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,660
Where is he?

811
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,320
Oh gosh, there's so many of them.

812
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,960
I could take them all out in one hit, Borgobi.

813
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:37,880
Okay.

814
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,440
Here, I'm gonna go get the other guy.

815
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,260
I'll CQC him.

816
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,540
I'll go CQC a guy.

817
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,940
Oh, sorry.

818
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,800
I didn't mean to punch you.

819
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,260
So silly.

820
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,390
Where?

821
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,240
Tell him.

822
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,620
Ask him where the goods are.

823
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,720
Ask him where the goods are.

824
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,660
That guy has good eyesight.

825
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,480
We'll take him home.

826
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,980
Wasn't there one more?

827
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,640
Oh, you.

828
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,640
This is what we C4.

829
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,780
Borgobi, watch out.

830
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,140
Watch out.

831
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:54,720
Watch out.

832
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,520
RT.

833
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,280
Wait, did I do it?

834
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,140
Is that mine or yours?

835
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,400
You're not gonna blow me up, are you?

836
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,640
Is this me?

837
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,440
This isn't mine, is it?

838
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
Why is my RT not working?

839
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,160
I'm so confused, you guys.

840
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,720
I'm actually...

841
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,580
I need

842
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,610
to aim it?

843
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:35,950
Okay.

844
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,130
That's why.

845
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,450
Oh my gosh, I'm so stupid.

846
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,050
Me too.

847
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:44,430
Oh.

848
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,350
Oh.

849
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,000
Just a little surprise for the edit.

850
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,220
Yeah, as a treat.

851
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:20,960
Yeah, exactly.

852
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,080
You guys would be so proud.

853
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:31,810
Thanks, Borgobi.

854
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,450
Only a C.

855
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:40,730
He could have done better.

856
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,190
The next time I won't forget my gun.

857
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,730
I promise.

858
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,390
Super cute.

859
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,610
She wants to leave Sickbay and get back on the battlefield.

860
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,210
But she's not fully healed.

861
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,690
She's still in crutches.

862
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,030
Who'd be crazy enough to try and fight like that?

863
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,190
You have to talk some sense into her.

864
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:06,450
Okay.

865
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,810
Is she with you right now?

866
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,310
Why, Big Boss is the best.

867
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,910
She keeps shouting about how she doesn't want to be there.

868
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:13,450
She won't show up about it.

869
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,290
She's driving me...

870
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:14,790
Let her go.

871
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,450
What?

872
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,430
If that's what she wants, let her go.

873
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,610
I'm really not in the mood for jokes, Snake.

874
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,490
I'm serious.

875
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,010
Let her go.

876
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:23,470
Why?

877
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,290
So she can come back in a body bag?

878
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,230
I'm really not in the mood for jokes, Kaz.

879
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,910
Threw it right back in his face.

880
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,410
Amanda isn't the type to just sit around in Sickbay.

881
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,890
She has a sense of duty.

882
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,050
Her purpose in life is to fight.

883
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,630
The battlefield isn't just the best thing for her.

884
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,690
It's the best thing for her compas too.

885
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,610
She'll be a huge morale boost.

886
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,230
That can only benefit MSF.

887
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:46,750
You think so?

888
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,410
You're good at fighting, Kaz.

889
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:49,370
One of the best.

890
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,730
But you've got a lot to learn when it comes to people.

891
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:53,970
Says Snake!

892
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,910
I'll think it over and find a team for her.

893
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,010
Don't worry.

894
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,790
She won't let us down.

895
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,790
Mr. Charisma over here.

896
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,990
You have to learn about people.

897
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:05,850
Okay.

898
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,230
Kaz is like the most charismatic guy ever.

899
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,110
Yay!

900
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,810
We got the sniper rifle.

901
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,750
Rhinoceros.

902
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,270
Mandrill.

903
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:20,430
I'm just... oh.

904
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,610
I said I was gonna skip these but...

905
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,050
A new plant.

906
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,550
Yeah baby!

907
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,910
We're killing it.

908
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,150
Alright, let's separate our guys.

909
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,250
Adding... wait.

910
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,110
To the team!

911
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,490
Red Seabream!

912
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:37,930
Cleone.

913
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,670
Cleone.

914
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,450
Cleone.

915
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,030
Civet Cat.

916
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,750
Oh, he's a weapons technician, eh?

917
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,030
No, you're going into combat, mister.

918
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,510
Look how strong your combat is.

919
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:01,570
Amanda.

920
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,330
What is she going to?

921
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,990
What's the last one again?

922
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,050
Is that intel, I think?

923
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:10,010
Orko!

924
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,490
Even in game, I am haunted by Orko.

925
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,140
Kudu.

926
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,300
Snipio.

927
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,600
My cooking is 100% safe for human consumption.

928
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,100
Why would you say that?

929
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,350
Scorpionfish.

930
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:50,310
Red Seabream.

931
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,370
Sea Lemon?

932
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,710
What the heck is a Sea Lemon?

933
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,230
Armadillo.

934
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,270
Moss.

935
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,390
Okay, that's everybody.

936
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,630
And...

937
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,030
Auto assign.

938
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,110
Very nice.

939
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,150
Very good.

940
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,410
It's like a sea grape.

941
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,990
They're extra salty.

942
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,130
Lemons aren't salty, they're just sour.

943
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,510
Right?

944
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,950
Hello, hello!

945
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,970
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome in!

946
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,210
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome in!

947
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:27,910
Let's see, what do we got?

948
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,010
What do we got that we can make?

949
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,250
This...

950
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,110
This...

951
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,510
And this is currently...

952
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,190
Oh yeah, yeah.

953
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,250
This is the...

954
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,410
Wait, when did I start making this?

955
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,690
Solid Magazine.

956
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,150
When did I start making that?

957
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:51,310
Items...

958
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:52,770
Oh, we can make curry!

959
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,830
Oh, I thought we were making the analyzer.

960
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,690
Oh wait, no, this is a 2-star analyzer.

961
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,510
Let's make some curry.

962
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,710
What is this?

963
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,590
Surround indicator.

964
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,270
We have a good amount of GMP.

965
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,630
Let's do that analyzer.

966
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,930
Level 19 or higher.

967
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,090
We have current 20.

968
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:21,950
Nice.

969
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:22,310
Let's...

970
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,410
Oh, I guess we can do both.

971
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,110
Research the Doritos.

972
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,130
When?

973
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,410
When do we get the Doritos?

974
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,210
Okay, we got a top...

975
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,750
Oh wait, Amanda is free.

976
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:39,730
She's out.

977
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:42,990
Why doesn't...

978
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,570
Why doesn't anybody send me anything?

979
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,540
I got so much stuff on the PlayStation.

980
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:56,960
Why?

981
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,380
Why?

982
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,180
Did you sort the recruits?

983
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,640
I did.

984
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,060
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

985
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,220
Metal Gear Grind.

986
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,840
I always am.

987
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,740
You sent me stuff?

988
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,260
Why?

989
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,240
Where did it go?

990
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:27,720
Why?

991
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,000
Why did Microsoft eat it?

992
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,380
They ate the curry.

993
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,660
Had I known this, I would have never played on the Xbox.

994
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,080
No.

995
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,250
Infiltrate the crater base.

996
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:52,270
Follow the nukes and infiltrate the enemy's main base inside of the crater of Irazu.

997
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,150
Towards the heart of the mountain.

998
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,050
That's its final destination.

999
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,990
We've got no intel on what lies beyond, so stay sharp.

1000
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,550
Come on in!

1001
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,830
Somebody.

1002
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,770
And while you do that...

1003
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,030
See, I saw this.

1004
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,130
And I thought it was my...

1005
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,650
I thought it was my...

1006
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,910
I thought it was that.

1007
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:26,690
But...

1008
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:28,630
That should be good though.

1009
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,950
What we have now.

1010
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:33,870
What I have here is fine.

1011
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,630
Welcome Requiem.

1012
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,630
Any briefing files?

1013
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:42,370
Let's talk to Miller.

1014
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,790
Commandos.

1015
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,450
No, I have clothes on.

1016
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:54,850
Well trained and highly dangerous.

1017
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,470
Amanda's crew calls them commandos.

1018
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:03,430
Unlike the patrolmen, these guys will actively, relentlessly track and hunt you down like hounds.

1019
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:04,610
Hmm.

1020
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,270
Hounds to hunt a former foxhound.

1021
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:08,950
Bring it on.

1022
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,830
They won't give up easily, even if they lose sight of you.

1023
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,170
They'll clear out any likely hiding places they come across.

1024
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:19,090
So don't get too comfy in one spot, or you might get caught again.

1025
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,050
Keep your eyes fixed on them and what they're doing.

1026
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:26,070
Also, be aware that commando gear includes body armor.

1027
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,130
So don't think you can deal with them by going in guns blazing.

1028
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:29,750
I can deal.

1029
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,330
All I've got to do is find an exposed weak point and...

1030
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,050
Their crotch.

1031
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,490
Wow, look at the thighs on those guys.

1032
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,750
Wow, they really do.

1033
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,930
What's Pies gotta say?

1034
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,490
Where are we going to?

1035
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,090
The canyon.

1036
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,070
Let's see what she says.

1037
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,790
Snake, to the north of the village is a bridge that crosses a hydraulic pipe.

1038
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,690
Though normally the bridge is not used by people.

1039
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,010
If you slip, you will fall straight to the bottom of the valley.

1040
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,390
Be careful.

1041
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,130
What's a channel doing here?

1042
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,690
It is not for irrigation.

1043
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,850
They are hydroelectric pipes.

1044
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:06,010
I wonder if they run into Irasu's crater lake.

1045
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:09,150
Normally they would build a reservoir at the bottom of the valley.

1046
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,530
But it was probably too dangerous.

1047
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:15,170
Los Cantos means Sword Peak.

1048
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,910
It does?

1049
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:21,410
Ready?

1050
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,550
You ready Freddy?

1051
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:32,190
He even unreadied while I was briefing.

1052
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:34,670
Alright.

1053
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,150
Let's go.

1054
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,790
Start the mission.

1055
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:42,630
I'm ready.

1056
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,810
I'm ready for real now.

1057
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,090
I'm ready to play the game.

1058
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,430
Honestly.

1059
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:52,710
Yeah, is Paz bluffing?

1060
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,870
Is she telling lies?

1061
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:54,750
She would never.

1062
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,250
My precious Paz would never tell lies.

1063
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,450
Take that back.

1064
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,170
Nobody said it, but take it back.

1065
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,830
Here we are.

1066
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,290
We are the team.

1067
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,230
Okay.

1068
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,750
Do you think I can get this guy?

1069
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,550
Hold on, I got this guy.

1070
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,690
From here, I'm a sniping queen.

1071
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,070
I got him.

1072
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,950
I got him.

1073
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,190
I got him!

1074
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,690
You don't have faith in me Requiem?

1075
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,650
Jeez.

1076
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,110
What are you... Why?

1077
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:41,530
Why?

1078
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,670
You don't have no faith in me.

1079
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,450
You have no faith in me.

1080
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,410
Do your little dance.

1081
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:50,450
I don't want to... Oh shoot.

1082
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,070
When did they start getting helmets?

1083
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,930
Hold on, you take down one guy, I take down the other guy.

1084
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,250
Oh, I was gonna...

1085
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,150
Yeah, you get...

1086
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:07,570
Oh...

1087
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:09,910
Why?

1088
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,560
You were supposed to take out the guy!

1089
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:18,840
Requiem!

1090
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,220
Requiem, we are in trouble now.

1091
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,260
Requiem, we are in trouble now.

1092
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,520
Oh you got him.

1093
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:25,720
Nice.

1094
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,660
What is it?

1095
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,140
Nothing.

1096
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,340
This is literally what Kaiz was warning us about.

1097
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,160
They spotted you, they didn't spot me.

1098
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,500
They spotted you, they didn't spot me.

1099
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,020
They spotted you, they didn't spot me.

1100
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,130
Is there anymore?

1101
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,750
No, there is no more.

1102
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:58,270
Easiness.

1103
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,250
Easy peasy.

1104
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,110
Requiem, what were you doing?

1105
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,190
You fool!

1106
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,330
Hey, come here.

1107
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,010
What were you doing?

1108
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,010
What were you thinking, soldier?

1109
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:12,110
Apologize.

1110
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,070
Sneak in.

1111
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,090
Sneak out.

1112
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,780
It's still stealthy.

1113
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,360
Yeah, it's still stealthy if no one is left.

1114
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:26,820
It's all good.

1115
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,420
Oh, I remember.

1116
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,200
Oh my gosh.

1117
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,880
Wait, there is... I remember.

1118
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,780
There is a bunch of... There is a bunch of people in this area.

1119
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,560
I remember.

1120
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,480
I can't jump up there.

1121
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm too small.

1122
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:39,900
Wait, wait, wait.

1123
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,700
I can box.

1124
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:41,980
Where is my box?

1125
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,420
I forgot that you can do this, right?

1126
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,340
How do you drop it?

1127
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,500
A, right?

1128
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,160
Yeah, see?

1129
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,360
Who is here?

1130
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,320
Who is up here?

1131
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,380
Well, this is a good vantage point, no?

1132
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,160
I can get this guy.

1133
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:14,820
What?

1134
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:18,740
Sentry!

1135
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,800
Oh, shoot.

1136
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,240
Why did I have to reload?

1137
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,880
We are not doing so hot with this, are we?

1138
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,000
Requiem, what happened?

1139
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,900
We were the dream team.

1140
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:34,880
What happened, buddy?

1141
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,160
What happened?

1142
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,760
We were the dream team.

1143
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,740
Where are the rocket launchers at?

1144
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,220
OK, I got that guy at least.

1145
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,160
Oh, shoot.

1146
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,160
I think we are OK.

1147
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:48,860
No?

1148
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:48,900
No?

1149
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,100
I got that guy.

1150
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,060
He is gonna go down, no?

1151
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,580
Oh, there is a guy down here.

1152
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,140
Oh my gosh.

1153
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:55,720
Where did you come from?

1154
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,380
Do I have auto-aim on?

1155
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:00,900
No.

1156
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,430
Oh, he is a wimpy baby!

1157
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:25,950
He is a wimpy baby!

1158
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,720
Thank you!

1159
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,240
Thank you, Fulton.

1160
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,680
How many more guys are we taking?

1161
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,980
How many more guys are we bringing?

1162
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,160
Requiem, are you OK?

1163
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:49,500
Are you alive?

1164
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,460
I almost killed you.

1165
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,700
I almost just did you a one-two.

1166
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh, he is out of bounds.

1167
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,420
Hold on, I want to loot a little bit more.

1168
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,240
It looked like it hurt.

1169
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,120
No!

1170
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:04,280
No!

1171
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,460
All my men are the strongest soldiers.

1172
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,080
They would never get hurt so easily.

1173
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,100
I thought there was a prisoner in this one.

1174
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,340
Maybe I...

1175
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,160
I thought that there was...

1176
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,060
I think I was thinking of a different location.

1177
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:23,920
That's OK, though.

1178
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:24,880
That's my fault.

1179
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,840
They start to look the same, huh?

1180
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,180
You think we can get him?

1181
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,500
Hold on, I'm gonna inch.

1182
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,580
The next bit, I think.

1183
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:36,920
Maybe.

1184
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,200
Oh, my box!

1185
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,800
I forgot my box.

1186
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:47,920
Bye-bye!

1187
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,460
You thought you heard a female voice by the box?

1188
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:53,060
Yeah, right?

1189
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:53,760
I thought so too.

1190
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,660
Oh, we have another box?

1191
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,000
Cool.

1192
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,860
There's three guys up there.

1193
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,020
I almost...

1194
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:09,400
I almost pressed this to be able to mark them.

1195
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,520
I'm just gonna shoot them.

1196
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,020
Not headshot them.

1197
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,480
Unless I'm really good.

1198
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,420
OK, and just make them go...

1199
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,820
Now they'll all fall asleep one by one.

1200
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,480
Just a box.

1201
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,360
We're lagging the game a little bit.

1202
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,260
Thank you!

1203
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,720
Alright, fall asleep.

1204
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,690
Fall asleep, little baby.

1205
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:49,610
Oh, there it is.

1206
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,170
One down.

1207
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:53,670
Oops!

1208
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:58,270
There it is.

1209
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:02,780
I timed it...

1210
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,010
precisely.

1211
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:06,430
You guys...

1212
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,350
I knew what I was doing.

1213
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,130
I knew what I was doing!

1214
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:19,570
Oh wait, I should save some Fultons for...

1215
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,770
I always forget that when I'm trying to...

1216
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,050
run and...

1217
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,050
I'm looting for...

1218
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,470
for Mother Base.

1219
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:34,090
I'm grabbing supplies.

1220
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:37,850
Is that the hostage sound?

1221
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,210
Oh my gosh!

1222
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,990
Why didn't you take him down with CQC?

1223
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:46,950
He was right there!

1224
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,870
He was right there!

1225
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,250
Who else?

1226
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,870
I think there's somebody in here.

1227
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,210
If I remember correctly.

1228
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,450
There's definitely someone in this area.

1229
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,310
I have four left.

1230
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,030
You think I can...you think I'll be good?

1231
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,510
When the VTuber backs you too?

1232
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,030
Yeah, why not?

1233
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:14,870
Hello?

1234
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:18,110
You found him!

1235
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,310
Good job.

1236
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,370
I think there's another one though in the other area.

1237
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:22,490
I think.

1238
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:23,890
Is there anyone down here?

1239
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,990
There's gotta be someone down here.

1240
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,230
Doors are unusable.

1241
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,170
Hello?

1242
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:34,310
Is there someone in there?

1243
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,290
There's nobody!

1244
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:43,430
But I remembered that there was somebody in this map.

1245
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:47,790
You good?

1246
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:55,930
We're going inside!

1247
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,270
I hope we don't get attacked or anything!

1248
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:01,650
Shoot!

1249
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:02,430
Shoot with the tank!

1250
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,550
I like it.

1251
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:20,730
Yeah, it takes two people.

1252
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,430
It's such a big door, it should have two people.

1253
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,190
Oh boy!

1254
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:28,950
Oh golly!

1255
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,610
No!

1256
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,370
It's...

1257
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,270
I don't remember the license plate.

1258
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,650
Shucks.

1259
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,390
I want to...

1260
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,270
I didn't mean to do that.

1261
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:53,610
Sorry.

1262
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,590
I didn't press anything.

1263
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:56,390
I just zoomed in.

1264
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:57,670
Okay.

1265
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,050
Definitely not that one.

1266
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,050
It was not this one.

1267
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:06,190
It had like a...

1268
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,450
It's checking for me.

1269
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,730
I want to make sure we don't accidentally do it.

1270
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:15,790
Oh, it's that one, right?

1271
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:20,490
Mr. Kojima!

1272
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:20,870
Jackpot!

1273
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,050
We got him, Mr. Kojima!

1274
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:30,650
Jackpot!

1275
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,530
Mr. Kojima, it's not...

1276
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,450
My leg!

1277
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,570
These are such...

1278
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,930
It's not this one either, no?

1279
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,930
It's definitely this one.

1280
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,150
Right?

1281
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,210
Okay.

1282
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,090
This one.

1283
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,470
It's empty!

1284
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:08,750
Just a box.

1285
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:13,310
Mr. Kojima!

1286
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,860
Oh no!

1287
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,880
Oh no!

1288
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,300
Okay.

1289
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,280
No spoilers on Yui, you guys.

1290
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,120
No spoilers on him, okay?

1291
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,920
There's some people in chat that haven't played the game yet.

1292
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:41,940
Do it.

1293
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,740
Jackpot!

1294
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,140
He's a thief!

1295
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,920
The toast?

1296
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,000
Like a toast.

1297
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,020
I thought like bread.

1298
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,600
Peace Walker!

1299
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,660
I can't hear!

1300
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:42,960
I'm kidding!

1301
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,600
I'm getting so many flashbacks from this man.

1302
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,880
Oh gosh!

1303
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,120
Come to us, Stark.

1304
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,020
We are going to have to meet it halfway.

1305
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:23,960
For victory!

1306
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,300
Cold Man!

1307
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,080
Mito is here too.

1308
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,940
Nuke!

1309
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,880
Very slowly.

1310
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,040
Making his way.

1311
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,040
That's not good.

1312
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,640
That's not good.

1313
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,940
Animated comics are goaded.

1314
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,260
They are so good, right?

1315
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,960
Gosh, the art style is so awesome.

1316
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,260
Hmm...

1317
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,020
Couldn't hot cold mean lukewarm?

1318
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,960
Yeah, but lukewarm man doesn't sound as fun, no?

1319
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,260
Hatsune Miku!

1320
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,450
Requiem, are you OK?

1321
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,190
Oh gosh, Huey jumpscare.

1322
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,840
In the next episode.

1323
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,960
I can't remember.

1324
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:32,880
I'm so bad.

1325
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,300
I can't remember which one is which.

1326
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Like I know there is Pupa and then Chrysalis.

1327
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,540
And then there is one more.

1328
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,440
I can't remember what the last one is.

1329
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,980
Chrysalis is the second one.

1330
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,580
BabyCorn, thanks for the gifted!

1331
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,700
Thank you so much!

1332
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:53,470
Cocoon!

1333
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,510
Was I thinking of cocoon instead of...wait.

1334
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,470
That's what...yeah.

1335
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,930
Pupa is basically Shagohan.

1336
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:09,130
Oh, we had three alert phases.

1337
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:09,970
None of them were me.

1338
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:10,670
I'm just saying.

1339
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:20,950
I've been awarded the butterfly title given to soldiers who mainly use short range weapons in favor of taking down enemies with non-lethal force.

1340
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,730
That's me.

1341
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,310
Huey!

1342
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:30,810
Personally, I did not like that comic at all.

1343
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,510
It doesn't do the main character justice.

1344
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:38,310
I know.

1345
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,390
Aw.

1346
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,950
What's so sad is there's gonna be people being like, oh man.

1347
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:50,270
Like I saw someone in the chat being like, I'm gonna find out why you guys don't like Huey so much.

1348
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:57,790
Well, that actually...not in this game, but you will know!

1349
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:01,290
Actually, in this game, he's pretty alright.

1350
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,040
He's not so bad.

1351
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,160
He's...well...

1352
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,480
Hello Hideo Kojima.

1353
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,600
Welcome to Mother Base.

1354
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,620
Yeah, we'll get there in all due time.

1355
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,580
In all due time.

1356
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,700
Ooh, spicy curry.

1357
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,480
Jaguar?

1358
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:32,500
Bear?

1359
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,480
Bull shark!

1360
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,940
Why do you have wounds?

1361
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:38,420
Was it me?

1362
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,200
Uh-oh.

1363
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,280
Sickness.

1364
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:43,820
Octopus has hostility.

1365
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,440
Alright, let's sort our guys.

1366
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,020
Let's see who we've...

1367
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,600
Oh wait.

1368
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:52,780
Who we meet.

1369
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:53,720
Seattle.

1370
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:55,180
Hideo.

1371
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,200
70% of my existence is made of movies.

1372
01:18:59,200 --> 01:18:59,820
It's...

1373
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,580
It is up to you to decide what to do with the remaining 30%.

1374
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:08,220
Starfish?

1375
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,760
Timing is everything in consecutive CQC, you know.

1376
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:12,580
Gotta be cool.

1377
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,660
Press the button at just the right time.

1378
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,420
What do you think this is?

1379
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,520
Starfish a game?

1380
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:20,460
Aardvark.

1381
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:22,840
Govi!

1382
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,080
You look prettier every time I see you.

1383
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,080
He

1384
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:32,560
thinks...

1385
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,520
I mean, boss does have some really nice eyelashes.

1386
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,840
Aguri.

1387
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,120
Shuni.

1388
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:45,880
Sunny.

1389
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:48,160
Onager.

1390
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,400
Agama.

1391
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,020
What are these animals?

1392
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,240
I've never heard of these before.

1393
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:55,680
Otter.

1394
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,900
Oh my god, Otter is setting up death flags for himself.

1395
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:00,020
Drinks later?

1396
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,440
It's on me.

1397
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,600
Dies in battle.

1398
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,300
Do they have any female soldiers in this?

1399
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,370
I don't think so.

1400
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,690
Another mission, right boss?

1401
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,660
Oh, it's the... yeah, oh.

1402
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,720
I was thinking...

1403
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,360
I couldn't remember if they were in this one or B.

1404
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,800
Only from POWs.

1405
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,420
There you go.

1406
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:32,520
Thank you.

1407
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,700
See, chat is so knowledgeable.

1408
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:34,540
I am not.

1409
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,020
Badger.

1410
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:37,500
Lion.

1411
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:39,500
Skink.

1412
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,360
Lemur!

1413
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,880
Lemur, you've never been in a real fight before?

1414
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,540
That's OK, we're putting you in the kitchen.

1415
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,060
Bluegill.

1416
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,560
Whoa, sea otter is goaded.

1417
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,660
Oh my gosh, look at him.

1418
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,720
Whoa!

1419
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,720
The guy has crazy stats.

1420
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,080
I just noticed.

1421
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,520
Yeah, let's go.

1422
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,500
High ranking.

1423
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,220
Lime soda.

1424
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,260
Lime!

1425
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:11,540
Let's see.

1426
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,500
We'll do another smoke grenade.

1427
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,920
Even though I haven't used mine yet, but...

1428
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,760
I like to carry them on hand.

1429
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,700
Lime soda.

1430
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,880
Oh, ration too.

1431
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,340
Big.

1432
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,100
What's this?

1433
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,200
Oh, this is the surround.

1434
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:34,880
Yeah, that's right.

1435
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,860
Alright, next mission.

1436
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,520
Who wants to fight Pewpa?

1437
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,900
Who wants to fight Pewpa together?

1438
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,000
I think lime soda was Mountain Dew.

1439
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:06,840
I'm feeling more and more regret for not playing the PSP version.

1440
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:10,480
Or the PlayStation version.

1441
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:17,060
How is it that they didn't get Mountain Dew for the Xbox version?

1442
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,800
How is it that they didn't get Mountain Dew for the Xbox version when the Xbox is literally lime green?

1443
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,380
Wait, is that all that Mountain Dew is?

1444
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,340
Is a lime soda?

1445
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,510
The controls might make you not miss the PSP version.

1446
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,370
Well, I mean, I'd still be playing it on the PS3.

1447
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,470
It's dew from the mountains.

1448
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,750
The licenses weren't in the HD collection.

1449
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:02,290
Oh, really?

1450
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,330
But I feel like I remember seeing it.

1451
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,130
I think I'm gaslighting myself.

1452
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,290
I have like gaslit myself into remembering these things.

1453
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:24,630
Probably because I've also seen videos of it of other people having played this game and everything too.

1454
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,210
Green soda.

1455
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,390
Just tastes like Mountain Dew?

1456
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:31,930
I don't know what that tastes like.

1457
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:36,330
You're like the same people that are like, oh, it just tastes like Coca-Cola.

1458
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,950
I don't know what that tastes like.

1459
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:39,030
Okay.

1460
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:47,770
Get on in here.

1461
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,470
Alright, team!

1462
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:55,830
Make sure you bring your big guns.

1463
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:07,000
I don't think we need the smoke grenade, but I have already.

1464
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,280
I have the supply.

1465
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,100
Supply...

1466
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,700
Maybe a C4, but oh, I have that too.

1467
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,000
Do we want the assault rifle?

1468
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,320
I don't think a sniper rifle will be worth it.

1469
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,140
I just realized I got the sleepy sniper.

1470
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:28,960
Nice.

1471
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,600
Drink Mountain Dew?

1472
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,340
I can't!

1473
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,400
I can't have soda!

1474
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,500
It doesn't mix well with the Ecuador Plaza.

1475
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,240
And my swimming trunks, yeah.

1476
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:51,480
Maybe I don't, but I kinda want the sniper so that I can have a precision on the pod.

1477
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,360
Which would be better?

1478
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,420
The M16 or the M60?

1479
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,720
Hello, gun otaku, it's your time to shine.

1480
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,140
Sodas are bad for you anyway, true.

1481
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,220
M60?

1482
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:26,700
Lucky!

1483
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,070
Down with the tea!

1484
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,330
Everybody ready with the tea?

1485
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:51,250
I know it's so weird, I never recognized you guys' names, but it's really funny when I see you guys have usernames that's the same as your YouTube names.

1486
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:55,170
And then I'm like, wow, you've been consistent for so long.

1487
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,540
They make Mountain Dew flavored lip balm.

1488
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:07,500
No idea how close it is, but there's a lot of soda flavored, non-soda things out there.

1489
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:12,100
Yeah, I just never think about it until someone reminds me, you know?

1490
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,500
I never changed mine.

1491
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,220
I know, I remember seeing it.

1492
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,240
I made my gamer tag in middle school and never changed it.

1493
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,680
I get that though.

1494
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:32,480
It's fun having a consistent name, like, online name for so long.

1495
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:39,060
Then, you know, there's some people that I can't refer to them as, like, their actual name.

1496
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,400
Like, I am like, you are your handle.

1497
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,640
Look at his eyelashes!

1498
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,340
He's so beautiful!

1499
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,540
Hey, team!

1500
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,580
We're the team!

1501
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,060
Oh gosh, I have to remember how to do this fight.

1502
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:58,240
I did it.

1503
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,280
Let's go team, let's go!

1504
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,740
Using the same username for most things for over a decade now.

1505
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,440
Pupa!

1506
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,600
I know, it's so fast!

1507
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:25,900
Oh my god.

1508
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:31,560
No shock units!

1509
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,380
Ouch!

1510
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:36,860
Oh!

1511
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,000
Thanks, thanks Yui!

1512
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,140
We're gonna kill this thing like crazy.

1513
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,320
Bye!

1514
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,140
Good job team!

1515
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:19,860
I'm going!

1516
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,040
I'm going!

1517
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,800
She's already dead.

1518
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,440
Damn, we didn't even, like, make it to...

1519
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,900
That was so fast.

1520
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,020
AI pod.

1521
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,200
Space oddity time.

1522
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:52,000
I love this part though, but it also makes me so sad.

1523
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,500
I'm gonna turn it up.

1524
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,760
I like this part.

1525
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:05,820
Oh.

1526
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,780
Ah, I missed!

1527
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:13,460
I can't get that one.

1528
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:16,980
I think it's getting too damaged.

1529
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,800
Hey, does anybody...

1530
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,020
Anyone wanna...

1531
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,100
Anyone wanna damage that part so I can grab it?

1532
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,460
This part... What is the C?

1533
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:35,940
Looks like pudding.

1534
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,200
I have 20 seconds and then there is an S.

1535
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,700
I got the C!

1536
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,360
I got the C!

1537
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:47,320
Good job guys.

1538
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,680
Good job, good job.

1539
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,610
Oh, am I gonna have time?

1540
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,050
No!

1541
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:00,130
Ah, I missed one!

1542
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:06,350
I shouldn't have dilly-dallied while waiting for the things to...

1543
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:07,870
It's okay though.

1544
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,310
We got most of it.

1545
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:15,890
What do you get from doing that?

1546
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:16,690
You'll see.

1547
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:19,690
You'll see.

1548
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:20,170
You'll see.

1549
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,760
Mission complete, baby.

1550
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,500
Goodbye, pupa.

1551
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,180
Baby Shagohan.

1552
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,740
It was so fast.

1553
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,820
Gosh, they improved it so much.

1554
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,320
She's going home.

1555
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,360
Hatsune Miku, see you later.

1556
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:00,740
Sorry though.

1557
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,360
He's like shaking on the stairs.

1558
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:11,020
Name's Hughie!

1559
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:21,940
Right.

1560
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:25,640
With a rocket launcher.

1561
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:33,960
Oh, are you an entomologist too?

1562
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,760
He's like fact-checking him.

1563
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,860
He's fact-checking him on the spot.

1564
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,520
Yeah.

1565
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,140
Oh my god.

1566
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,200
Final phase.

1567
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,480
Oh gosh, the ominous glow of his glasses.

1568
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,620
Hey guys, no.

1569
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,100
Stop!

1570
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:40,480
Stop!

1571
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:40,880
Stop!

1572
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,500
Stop!

1573
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,360
I want people to...

1574
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,320
I want to show them the cutscene!

1575
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:46,840
Stop it!

1576
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,380
The one you just fought was a pupa.

1577
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:56,800
There's also a flying type called chrysalis and a treaded type, the cocoon.

1578
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:08,560
Motor control, target detection, tracking, attack, capture and transport functions are all controlled by an electronic brain.

1579
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,460
There's no need for a human pilot.

1580
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,720
They can only follow simple commands though.

1581
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,800
Why build them here?

1582
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,460
What am I looking at?

1583
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,960
Hot Cold Man.

1584
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,120
Peace Walker.

1585
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,000
Uh oh.

1586
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,310
Where have you...

1587
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:57,260
The butterflies.

1588
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:12,040
Why do they make Yui so terrifying in these photos?

1589
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,860
The terrain is full of tropical rainforest.

1590
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,420
A lot of the time you can't even build a proper road.

1591
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,280
So I went back to where it all started.

1592
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:25,660
What's that?

1593
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:27,320
Legs.

1594
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,900
Walking power.

1595
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:36,840
A mobile launcher carrying a thermonuclear warhead even more powerful than the Soviet RDS-220s.

1596
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,100
That's Peace Walker.

1597
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:42,120
Chico's Basilisco.

1598
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,200
Basilisco.

1599
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,420
We did the assembly and field testing here.

1600
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,740
A walking nuke.

1601
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:52,160
I sort of borrowed the original idea from Behind the Iron Curtain.

1602
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,940
The missing link between infantry and artillery.

1603
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,500
Metal Gear.

1604
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,880
Metal Gear.

1605
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,460
He's like, I like the sound of that.

1606
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,840
They'd actually need to deploy dozens of them.

1607
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,060
That's pretty metal.

1608
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:09,240
Oh.

1609
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:41,180
Which makes launching an act of suicide.

1610
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:44,980
In the end, neither side can use its nukes.

1611
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:49,840
It's thanks to this doctrine that the world's two superpowers have avoided all-out confrontation.

1612
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,540
Nuclear deterrence has brought us peace.

1613
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:56,440
At the very least, it's prevented another world war from breaking out.

1614
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,440
But the theory of nuclear deterrence exists only on paper.

1615
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,440
In reality, there's no guarantee that either side would follow through with retaliation.

1616
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:06,820
Oh.

1617
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:11,540
There's the chance that a preemptive strike could destroy all the missile bases.

1618
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,940
Render them unable to retaliate.

1619
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:20,220
But the biggest flaw in the theory is that the decision to retaliate has to be made by human beings.

1620
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:20,940
Humans.

1621
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,540
Let me give you a real world example.

1622
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,200
Let's say Country X launches first against Country Y.

1623
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:27,880
Then they just keep going?

1624
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:34,420
If the people in charge of Country Y are like you and me, they're not going to be able to retaliate, knowing that they're effectively ending all human life.

1625
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,660
So then the weak link in nuclear deterrence theory is the uncertainty of retaliation.

1626
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:39,980
Bingo.

1627
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:44,820
And that creates a loophole Country X can exploit to launch the first strike.

1628
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:48,600
Which is why we designed the system to be unmanned.

1629
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,240
With Peace Walker, retaliation is certain.

1630
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:57,080
It chooses the appropriate target and launches a retaliatory nuclear strike.

1631
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,040
Every time.

1632
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:58,140
Anger.

1633
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:58,980
Anger the robot.

1634
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,840
Without needing human input to make the call.

1635
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:06,260
Launching a nuclear strike against Peace Walker is tantamount to pushing the launch button against yourself.

1636
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:14,040
It closes the loophole in nuclear deterrence theory, rendering our friends in Country X completely unable to launch.

1637
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:24,440
What Coldman is saying is that to achieve this goal, we need to demonstrate that retaliation will be carried out by a machine.

1638
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,960
He will launch his nuke.

1639
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:32,480
And then his version of deterrence will be complete.

1640
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,720
He's so scary.

1641
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,400
I believe in peace through nuclear deterrence.

1642
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:40,460
Why?

1643
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,100
My father worked on the Manhattan Project.

1644
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,060
He put his whole life into that research.

1645
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,440
And all it created was this illusion of peace called deterrence.

1646
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,880
This cursed ass family.

1647
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,360
And then I was born.

1648
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,680
Unable to walk.

1649
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,100
Otacon, why'd you start working on Metal Gear?

1650
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,920
I had no choice but to face up to the nukes.

1651
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,260
Huey, why'd you start working on Metal Gear?

1652
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:06,840
Oh, my father.

1653
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,980
If they do end up launching, it'll all have been for nothing.

1654
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,840
Huey, they've got to be stopped.

1655
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,460
Why'd you make the nukes?

1656
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:17,100
My father.

1657
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,840
To a base near the border.

1658
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,280
The final test is five days from now.

1659
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,840
Where's the base?

1660
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:24,640
You're gonna stop them?

1661
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:27,900
It's kind of a hike.

1662
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,900
And besides, there's a surefire way to halt the project.

1663
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,640
You see, Peace Walker isn't quite finished yet.

1664
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,140
What do you mean?

1665
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:40,760
It's missing one last critical structural component.

1666
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:42,960
The AI.

1667
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,260
It's brain.

1668
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:54,560
The reptile pod, the electronic brain I was working on, can only follow commands like Go there.

1669
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,100
Attack that.

1670
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,540
It's helping us achieve peace!

1671
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:04,400
But for nuclear deterrence to work, it must function in place of a human decision-maker.

1672
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,520
It needs something to analyze the huge volumes of data coming in and select an appropriate target for retaliation.

1673
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:16,800
Hence, it needs the high-level decision-making ability of a cerebrum.

1674
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:19,600
The mechanical cerebrum.

1675
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:26,160
The hardware configuration is modeled on the human brain similar to the pod I worked on, but its role is completely different.

1676
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,720
Where's it being made?

1677
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,040
A research lab to the north.

1678
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:34,300
An AI expert named Dr. Strangelove is developing it.

1679
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,240
Very hush-hush.

1680
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,120
Dr. Strangelove.

1681
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,640
Strangelove was recruited from the States too.

1682
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:45,580
In the field of AI, there's no one better, that's for sure.

1683
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,040
But man, what a basket case.

1684
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:49,520
Says you!

1685
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:55,040
Especially you.

1686
01:39:58,500 --> 01:39:59,860
She hates everyone.

1687
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,520
I'll lend you my ID card.

1688
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,400
It'll get you through security at the lab.

1689
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,620
Oh, and one more thing.

1690
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:07,860
What's this?

1691
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,180
A letter of recommendation?

1692
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,400
Yeah, it's...

1693
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,220
It's from me to Dr. Strangelove.

1694
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,180
Don't read it, okay?

1695
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,280
Okay, I promise!

1696
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,500
Tear that sucker open!

1697
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,220
So what will you do now?

1698
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,680
I... I'm done with science.

1699
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,640
At this rate, I'm probably already halfway to hell anyway.

1700
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,100
This man can't stop lying!

1701
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,600
Why are you always lying?

1702
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:40,140
Oh my god.

1703
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,500
Stop fucking lying!

1704
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,240
I'm probably better suited to something like that than this paradise.

1705
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:55,720
Sorry, I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna avoid...

1706
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,840
We are in this game, everybody.

1707
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,820
Can't get ahead of ourselves, okay?

1708
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,340
I'm just really passionate, and I know you guys are all too.

1709
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,140
Cause that's what you are!

1710
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,060
Sorry.

1711
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,160
Okay, I'm done.

1712
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,480
I'm done, I'm done.

1713
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,680
I'm done, I'm done.

1714
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,340
I'm done, I'm done.

1715
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:41,430
Kiwi is just a silly guy in this game, for real.

1716
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,990
A country without an army!

1717
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:48,650
Thank you guys!

1718
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:50,950
We spedrun that.

1719
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,610
Look at that, 13 minutes.

1720
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:57,150
Speedrun through the boss battles.

1721
01:41:57,510 --> 01:42:00,030
For anyone curious...

1722
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:05,120
Also, if I'm gonna do any missions on my own or anything like that...

1723
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:10,070
There might be a few that I choose to do on my own, but for the most part...

1724
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:13,070
I don't mind actually speedrunning this game because...

1725
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:16,070
I'm really just kind of going through it so that we can...

1726
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:20,450
Go through the story and experience everything.

1727
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,250
Taking it slow!

1728
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:23,350
That's true.

1729
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:33,290
It's not that I want to speedrun the story, but...

1730
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:40,030
Look at this guy's smile!

1731
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:57,230
I'm done with science.

1732
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:02,170
Oh my god!

1733
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:05,410
You just said you were done with science!

1734
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,130
This guy is ridiculous!

1735
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:32,550
That didn't take long at all.

1736
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:36,770
He's like, just this once.

1737
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:40,750
We'll make your weapon and then I'll stop.

1738
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:43,470
What's that?

1739
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:55,450
Oh, OK.

1740
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,410
More money!

1741
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:58,710
More money!

1742
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:00,350
Oh yeah!

1743
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:04,130
Miller's got a lot to say.

1744
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:10,990
Country?

1745
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:31,850
Huey in the kitchen?

1746
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,850
Don't read Huey's letter, he'll be upset.

1747
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:39,290
No, I won't.

1748
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,450
My men!

1749
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:46,250
My men!

1750
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:49,170
I'm attached to my men!

1751
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:51,250
We might lose men.

1752
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,150
Outer Ops 2!

1753
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:01,490
Lime soda!

1754
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:05,490
Strange Love's Lab.

1755
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:08,010
Chaff Grenade.

1756
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:13,050
Oh yeah, I saw someone throw a Chaff Grenade earlier.

1757
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:13,750
Good job.

1758
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,010
Night Vision Goggles!

1759
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:17,510
Lobster.

1760
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:18,710
Alpaca.

1761
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:19,650
Wild Fish.

1762
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:21,050
Wait, hold on.

1763
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:21,990
I'm going to skip all these guys.

1764
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:24,150
No plan.

1765
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:28,770
Great stream.

1766
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:29,970
Thank you Froggy!

1767
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,910
Thanks so much for the superchat.

1768
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:57,620
Oh my gosh!

1769
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:01,460
A maximum of 100 people can be recovered permission.

1770
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,100
Are there that many people?

1771
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:04,600
Holy moly!

1772
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:06,620
Super...

1773
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:06,760
Oh!

1774
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,440
Wow!

1775
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:09,060
Wow!

1776
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,160
Wow!

1777
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:11,180
Wow!

1778
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,380
Wow!

1779
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:15,500
Thank you!

1780
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:25,460
I received a gift!

1781
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,460
I think I'm good on the tutorial.

1782
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,400
I think I remember how it works.

1783
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,720
Let's organize our guys real quick.

1784
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,580
Support strike mark up.

1785
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,540
Oh, I'm on Fulton Recovery 3!

1786
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,890
Should we dispatch some guys?

1787
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,430
Let's see...

1788
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:06,470
I'm going to send out a mech.

1789
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:15,910
We could get rid of some of the worst.

1790
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,310
Well, there's no...

1791
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:21,210
We don't know if they are going to die.

1792
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:26,130
Would you consider Dr. Strangelove watch along?

1793
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:28,450
It's been a while since I watched it, so yeah.

1794
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:34,310
We had to get gifts after experiencing Huey.

1795
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:37,570
I wonder why some people have tried sending and they don't go through.

1796
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,490
I'm attached to Jaguar.

1797
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:54,710
We're going to send some guys out.

1798
01:47:57,950 --> 01:48:01,750
Maybe I don't remember how this works, but I'm just going to go for it.

1799
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:03,590
No!

1800
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:04,390
Lizard!

1801
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,370
Lizard!

1802
01:48:06,710 --> 01:48:07,190
Lizard!

1803
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:08,730
Lizard!

1804
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:09,410
Lizard!

1805
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:10,710
Oh no!

1806
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:11,870
Wait, what have I done?

1807
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:13,610
What have I done?

1808
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:13,650
Lizard!

1809
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:26,430
I'm going to send Jaguar to watch over Lizard.

1810
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,130
I don't think I need to send all these guys.

1811
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:31,430
There's only two of them, but that's OK.

1812
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:32,890
Launch an attack!

1813
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:38,730
They'll all make it home safe, I believe.

1814
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:46,000
Where is the...someone said it earlier.

1815
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:51,900
We're going to go read that letter now.

1816
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,160
We're going to go read that letter now.

1817
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,400
R&D under other.

1818
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,560
You're the best!

1819
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,360
Thank you.

1820
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,940
I wonder what it could say.

1821
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:23,960
I wonder what it is.

1822
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,740
Was it something I said maybe?

1823
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,100
If so, I apologize.

1824
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,600
I can't read it so fast.

1825
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,260
Hold on!

1826
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,660
The text is so fast.

1827
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:09,280
I thought it would go up the entire screen.

1828
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,120
Was it something I said maybe?

1829
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,280
If so, I apologize.

1830
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:16,020
It's just there's something I want to tell you, so I decided to put it in a letter.

1831
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:23,480
I mean, obviously this isn't the best time and all, but I was, you know, kind of curious about your research and stuff.

1832
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:25,500
Speaking of which, how's the pod coming along?

1833
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,440
I was wondering whether that program I wrote was working out or not.

1834
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,460
You know, the one that links our two AIs together?

1835
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,960
If it's not, I could always go over and fix it.

1836
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,160
If that's OK, of course.

1837
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:37,300
For my own peace of mind, really, you know, make sure the program's feeling alright.

1838
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,780
Or I guess I really wouldn't say the program has feelings, so...

1839
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:40,040
Oops.

1840
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,580
I hit my controller on accident.

1841
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,140
He's rapping.

1842
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:50,100
Rap God.

1843
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:52,360
Look, we can even see his signature at the bottom.

1844
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:01,890
Zoom in.

1845
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:03,970
Can you guys read it?

1846
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:06,090
I could always go over and fix it.

1847
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:07,050
If that's OK, of course.

1848
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:11,350
For my own peace of mind, really, you know, make sure the program's feelings are alright.

1849
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:13,790
I guess you wouldn't really say the program has feelings, would you?

1850
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:14,010
Haha.

1851
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,330
Sorry, I'm getting off track here.

1852
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:18,170
So anyway, I've been meaning to tell you something for the longest time.

1853
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:21,430
I've been thinking, back when we first met at NASA, those were fun times.

1854
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:25,830
You know, living the dream, getting to work all the time with the science we loved.

1855
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:29,650
Ever since then, I've always held you, your research, in the highest esteem.

1856
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:30,410
No more than that.

1857
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:32,050
I think you're a wonderful person.

1858
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:34,230
Sorry, I don't even know what I'm trying to say here.

1859
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:36,770
So when you disappeared from NASA all of a sudden, I was devastated.

1860
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,270
That's when I finally dawned on me.

1861
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:39,230
I need you.

1862
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:40,350
For my research, you see.

1863
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:40,930
I mean, no.

1864
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:41,630
Well, yes.

1865
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:42,270
And no.

1866
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:42,890
It's hard to explain.

1867
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:45,570
Anyway, when I saw you again in Costa Rica, I could hardly believe it.

1868
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:47,430
I thought maybe it was divine intervention or something.

1869
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,890
You know, like it was written somewhere that we were meant to be like this.

1870
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:51,910
You and me, the two of us from now on, you know?

1871
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:53,070
Just you and me, Morty.

1872
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:54,310
Sorry, wrong series.

1873
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:55,590
Anyway, I'm doing research.

1874
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:57,190
The research, uh, meetings.

1875
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:58,890
No, I'm rambling again.

1876
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:59,150
Sorry.

1877
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,590
We don't have much time left.

1878
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:02,310
When Peace Walker is finished, that's it, right?

1879
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:06,490
That's the end of the project, so what I'm trying to say is, Peace Walker is kind of like something we create together, you know?

1880
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:08,010
And when it's finished, then we'll...

1881
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:09,550
I know we're not done yet.

1882
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:10,830
We need to finish it first, right?

1883
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:13,910
Yeah, until we do, I just hope you won't disappear on me like you did last time.

1884
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:15,250
Sorry for taking up your time.

1885
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:18,210
I wish you the best of luck with your research, your dear friend, Huey.

1886
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:34,590
Thank you for reading that.

1887
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:39,330
You see, Huey made the letter scroll that fast because he really didn't want you to read it.

1888
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:40,830
I know!

1889
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:42,550
He's such a silly guy.

1890
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,150
Hold on, I want to get rid of all this, too.

1891
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,050
No, no.

1892
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,920
Oh, there's so many things.

1893
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:03,520
OK, I give up.

1894
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:09,420
On to Strange Love.

1895
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,300
On to...

1896
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,720
the start of my favorite part of the game.

1897
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,400
Oh, I'm so excited.

1898
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,360
Do we?

1899
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:19,500
No, we don't.

1900
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,500
See?

1901
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:22,880
And Warp now exists.

1902
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,780
It's a multiverse.

1903
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:45,560
Alright, who wants to join, baby?

1904
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:45,880
Huey!

1905
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,940
Come on in.

1906
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,240
Come on in, come on in.

1907
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,420
Oh, wow, that was so fast.

1908
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:54,500
Wayfarers!

1909
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,320
Do we need...

1910
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,640
Oh, I should put my...

1911
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,020
Are we in the jungle still?

1912
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:07,540
Survival.

1913
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,040
Do we need our key?

1914
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:14,400
I'll equip it just in case, because I feel like I'll forget it later.

1915
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:18,420
ID card.

1916
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:19,180
There we go.

1917
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:29,340
Thanks, now I have crippling depression and trust issues.

1918
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:32,260
Sorry, Huey!

1919
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:36,720
Sorry, I mixed it up with...

1920
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:37,300
the mail.

1921
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:38,740
Sorry!

1922
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:44,870
Let's go!

1923
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:58,880
Strange love.

1924
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,800
I thought you said snake love.

1925
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:02,900
Survival.

1926
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,400
Take your time, take your time.

1927
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:14,000
I forgot to change my guns.

1928
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,560
I forgot to change my guns.

1929
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,060
I forgot to change my guns.

1930
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,640
I forgot to change my guns.

1931
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,920
I forgot to change my guns.

1932
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:35,300
Chapter 2!

1933
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,800
That's me!

1934
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,780
The Phantom Hero.

1935
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,560
Chico...

1936
01:55:51,380 --> 01:55:54,880
He gave me an axe?

1937
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:05,800
Oh, Paz is so cute.

1938
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:30,460
Wow!

1939
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:34,480
That's insane.

1940
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:42,320
I have it!

1941
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:43,000
Oh, the butterfly!

1942
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,100
I remember the ID, but not...

1943
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,300
I remember the ID, but not my weapons.

1944
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:11,900
Parasites.

1945
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:11,960
Parasites.

1946
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:17,640
Oh my god, Paz looks so cool.

1947
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,380
OK!

1948
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:27,540
I'll be careful.

1949
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:46,070
There goes our mule.

1950
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:54,510
Snake, Strange Love's lab is a few miles to the north.

1951
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:56,910
It won't be long before the AI is complete.

1952
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:58,070
Don't let that happen.

1953
01:57:58,430 --> 01:57:58,670
OK!

1954
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:00,750
Just a mule.

1955
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:05,590
I'm thinking strange love, strange love.

1956
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:09,050
I'm thinking...

1957
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:11,250
No, what's this?

1958
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:11,410
It's...

1959
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:18,850
Oh my gosh, look how cool we look.

1960
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:26,870
Wait there, wait there, wait there.

1961
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:28,010
I have a secret.

1962
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:29,230
I have a secret.

1963
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:31,090
I'm about to tell you something.

1964
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:33,010
It's all up to you buddy.

1965
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:36,450
I left all...I left all my weapons.

1966
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:39,190
I left all...

1967
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:40,510
No, stop, stop.

1968
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:41,170
This is serious.

1969
01:58:41,610 --> 01:58:43,210
I left all my weapons at home.

1970
01:58:43,670 --> 01:58:45,390
It's all up to you.

1971
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:46,910
It's all up to you.

1972
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:49,150
You got to try and...

1973
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:54,310
What do you mean by that?

1974
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:03,210
Do you see any men?

1975
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:11,880
Do you see any men?

1976
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,480
I can get them with my hands.

1977
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,140
Probably.

1978
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:19,520
Where's the men?

1979
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:21,600
I'll get them with my hands.

1980
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:21,800
OK.

1981
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:22,780
Oh, I see them right there.

1982
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:24,260
I see them in the tree.

1983
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:25,620
Right there.

1984
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:28,220
How do I zoom in this thing?

1985
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:29,640
Can I?

1986
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:32,960
Maybe not.

1987
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:35,940
Good job!

1988
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:39,740
I at least brought my Fultons.

1989
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:43,940
Hey!

1990
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,280
Wayfarer!

1991
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,760
What happened?

1992
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,000
What are you doing to that guy?

1993
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:56,700
I'm kicking the air.

1994
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:03,440
Where did that guy come from?

1995
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:17,430
No reinforcements necessary.

1996
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:19,390
No reinforcements.

1997
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:20,690
Wayfarer!

1998
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:21,470
Wayfarer!

1999
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,250
I said it was up to you.

2000
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:23,150
What the heck were you thinking?

2001
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:25,470
What the heck were you thinking buddy?

2002
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:26,630
Oh my god.

2003
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:27,570
They are on their way.

2004
02:00:29,450 --> 02:00:30,330
I don't think they noticed.

2005
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:35,230
I don't think they noticed.

2006
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:37,390
Are you going to get them or...

2007
02:00:38,870 --> 02:00:39,610
I am a tree.

2008
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,230
I am a tree.

2009
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:46,710
Are they going to come over?

2010
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:47,530
Oh, nice.

2011
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,060
Oh wow, they are really dumb.

2012
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:00,100
Ok, this is good.

2013
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:07,840
See?

2014
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,020
Wayfarer!

2015
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:19,740
Wayfarer!

2016
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:21,580
What were you thinking standing out in the open like that?

2017
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:22,380
Wayfarer!

2018
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:23,220
They are going to see us!

2019
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:24,080
Wayfarer!

2020
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,040
What were you thinking?

2021
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:30,300
Were you some kind of reckless newbie?

2022
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:31,700
What is this?

2023
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,400
Soldier!

2024
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:33,940
Get your act together.

2025
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,140
Wayfarer!

2026
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,240
Wayfarer, that's not even a real person.

2027
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:39,300
Wayfarer, that's a standee.

2028
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,920
That's literally... that's not even real.

2029
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:44,640
Get it together.

2030
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:52,880
They keep sending me idiots when I ask for signs.

2031
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,460
Yeah, kill it.

2032
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,240
I'm just...

2033
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:00,540
Nice.

2034
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,040
Don't hit me though.

2035
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:05,680
Alright, come on.

2036
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:06,420
Let's keep going.

2037
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:17,710
Wait, is there something we missed?

2038
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:19,750
That's how you go back?

2039
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,330
No?

2040
02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:21,730
We got everything?

2041
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:22,510
I think we got everything.

2042
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:22,890
Let's go.

2043
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:25,890
Tranquil as a forest...

2044
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:29,890
But afar... within...

2045
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:31,130
Oh, wait.

2046
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:32,630
Did I just go by myself?

2047
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:37,350
Once you find your center...

2048
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:40,370
You are sure to win.

2049
02:02:40,990 --> 02:02:42,130
Oh, you were here the whole time.

2050
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:44,110
That's not a real person.

2051
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:45,770
Don't get fooled, Wayfarer.

2052
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:46,650
That's a fake.

2053
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:48,510
That's a phony.

2054
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:52,130
I'm sure there's real guys around here though.

2055
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:53,230
Use your hands.

2056
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:54,890
Use your hands.

2057
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:58,330
I see a guy.

2058
02:02:58,710 --> 02:02:59,370
I see a guy.

2059
02:02:59,790 --> 02:03:00,650
I see a guy.

2060
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:04,970
I forgot that you can't move when you lay down in this game.

2061
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:09,550
I'm gonna go take him down.

2062
02:03:11,370 --> 02:03:11,850
Nope.

2063
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:12,790
Nevermind.

2064
02:03:12,910 --> 02:03:13,710
I changed my mind.

2065
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,810
I didn't see that guy.

2066
02:03:15,810 --> 02:03:16,710
Oh.

2067
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:18,630
Oh.

2068
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:26,840
Oh, he got me!

2069
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:28,340
Wait, I got him!

2070
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:29,580
No, he got me!

2071
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,000
Wait, I got him!

2072
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,140
I was like, nice, I got him.

2073
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,680
Oh, we're not getting an A on this one.

2074
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:43,600
Oh my gosh.

2075
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:22,290
Wayfarer, don't die.

2076
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,390
Oh

2077
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:34,700
my gosh.

2078
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:41,990
Bring me back.

2079
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:52,050
Hey, thank you.

2080
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:56,190
I should...I meant to put my rations on.

2081
02:04:56,810 --> 02:04:57,690
My bad.

2082
02:04:58,230 --> 02:04:59,050
We're okay though.

2083
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:02,750
Wait.

2084
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:03,910
Great find.

2085
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:09,230
Are you okay?

2086
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:10,930
You're like bleeding out, Wayfarer.

2087
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:11,450
Are you alright?

2088
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:16,750
We need to go the other way, no?

2089
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,110
No, we can't go this way.

2090
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:24,710
Yeah, I know.

2091
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:25,330
I don't know.

2092
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:27,390
Gosh, he's so nosy.

2093
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,390
Snake!

2094
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:34,030
Are you gonna be okay?

2095
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:35,510
You're beeping a lot.

2096
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:37,230
You wanna lay on the ground a little bit?

2097
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,030
Here, I'll lay with you.

2098
02:05:41,850 --> 02:05:42,530
There you go.

2099
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:43,530
Yeah.

2100
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:45,230
Come on.

2101
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:46,650
Come on.

2102
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:47,330
Lay dead.

2103
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:50,950
So convenient that CPR can revive you from bullet wounds.

2104
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:51,650
I know, right?

2105
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:53,370
This is peaceful, huh?

2106
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:57,670
We're just...we're just two fellas lying on the ground.

2107
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:59,530
In the middle of the forest.

2108
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:03,730
After just killing a bunch of guys.

2109
02:06:04,910 --> 02:06:05,990
I'm going to full health.

2110
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:07,030
What's wrong with you?

2111
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:12,610
Peace layer.

2112
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:15,410
Walking?

2113
02:06:15,730 --> 02:06:15,930
No.

2114
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:16,550
Peace walker?

2115
02:06:16,630 --> 02:06:16,790
No.

2116
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:17,550
Peace laying?

2117
02:06:17,710 --> 02:06:17,930
Yeah.

2118
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:23,480
Get up, soldier.

2119
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:26,280
Come on.

2120
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:32,700
We need to go.

2121
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,530
Peace kicker.

2122
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:40,790
Peace day will never come.

2123
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:41,750
Maybe.

2124
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:46,090
I mean...

2125
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,470
Oh my gosh.

2126
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,550
This just reminded me.

2127
02:06:57,630 --> 02:06:59,570
I can't wait for that one spooky mission.

2128
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,650
And the extra ops.

2129
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:03,770
I'm excited for that one.

2130
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:08,960
Butterfly!

2131
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:19,010
Oh!

2132
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:20,270
This is...Oh!

2133
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:22,130
I should have known this area.

2134
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:40,630
In the next episode.

2135
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:47,710
Yeah, we have rocket launchers.

2136
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:48,330
We're all good.

2137
02:07:55,290 --> 02:07:57,910
We had a two camaraderie.

2138
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:00,510
I didn't do those kills.

2139
02:08:00,630 --> 02:08:01,150
Those were not me.

2140
02:08:01,230 --> 02:08:01,730
Those were not me.

2141
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:02,370
Those were not me.

2142
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,770
Don't put that on me.

2143
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:07,890
Naked.

2144
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:10,190
Going with the tea.

2145
02:08:11,970 --> 02:08:12,850
Thanks, Wayfarer.

2146
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:16,990
Why is it always everybody else that gets us into alert phases?

2147
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:21,810
What if I didn't?

2148
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:23,810
What if I didn't?

2149
02:08:40,410 --> 02:08:43,970
This guy literally can't help himself.

2150
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:45,970
He can't help himself.

2151
02:08:47,370 --> 02:08:48,270
Yeah.

2152
02:08:53,310 --> 02:08:53,930
True.

2153
02:08:54,050 --> 02:08:55,810
Single handedly.

2154
02:09:08,410 --> 02:09:10,510
Sorry to have everyone join them.

2155
02:09:21,810 --> 02:09:23,170
Go down without a fight.

2156
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:25,830
So don't get too preoccupied with this stuff.

2157
02:09:26,190 --> 02:09:26,950
Don't worry.

2158
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:29,970
I'm not about to risk my life for a bunch of scrap.

2159
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:31,610
I would hope not.

2160
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:33,410
One more thing.

2161
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:36,150
Our new bipedal weapon needs a name.

2162
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:38,010
Good point.

2163
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:41,230
We can't keep calling it our bipedal weapon.

2164
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:45,370
I had a talk with Miller and we came up with Metal Gear Zeke.

2165
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:46,450
Metal Gear.

2166
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:48,810
He really liked the name Metal Gear.

2167
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:49,770
I can't believe this.

2168
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:49,930
I can't believe this.

2169
02:09:54,850 --> 02:10:00,770
I wonder who suggested the Japanese aircraft name.

2170
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,890
What the...

2171
02:10:05,890 --> 02:10:07,330
I wonder...

2172
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:11,690
Who suggested the Japanese name part of it.

2173
02:10:13,490 --> 02:10:18,050
Metal Gear Zero.

2174
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:21,530
Weeaboo.

2175
02:10:21,790 --> 02:10:22,190
Weeaboo.

2176
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:26,570
Was it perhaps this guy right here?

2177
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:29,030
Kazuhiro Weeaboo Miller.

2178
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:31,770
Obsessed with Japan.

2179
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:36,610
Actually it's been two hours since the stream and we got our first Japan mention.

2180
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:37,550
That's kind of impressive.

2181
02:10:40,690 --> 02:10:42,470
He's losing his senses.

2182
02:10:45,790 --> 02:10:47,550
I'm going to skip all this.

2183
02:10:50,890 --> 02:10:53,330
Wait, did our combat guys come back?

2184
02:10:53,370 --> 02:10:54,050
Oh, they returned.

2185
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:55,990
And?

2186
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:57,650
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

2187
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:03,560
Auto play.

2188
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:17,090
Why are they going after Koifu?

2189
02:11:19,590 --> 02:11:21,430
Oh yeah, take him down.

2190
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:24,370
Kill that turtle.

2191
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:26,570
Wait, can we get him to come to our team?

2192
02:11:27,330 --> 02:11:28,250
Nope, he's dead.

2193
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:32,130
Woah!

2194
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,400
Overkill.

2195
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:45,980
Good job team.

2196
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:50,040
Cardboard box tank.

2197
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:51,000
Nice.

2198
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:53,920
Anyways.

2199
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:55,880
Level up!

2200
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:58,940
We got Cougar.

2201
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:02,160
He's a foodie.

2202
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:03,800
Wish Warbler.

2203
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:04,940
Gerbil.

2204
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:10,860
Silkworm.

2205
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:12,120
Hyena.

2206
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:14,540
I love to grill things.

2207
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:16,220
My favorite food is stir-fried noodles.

2208
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:19,320
Those grilled chicken skewers they got in Japan are pretty good too.

2209
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:25,000
Lobster has literally nothing to say.

2210
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,280
Wow, a man of mystery.

2211
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:29,360
Japan mention.

2212
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:30,920
Megamouth shark.

2213
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:34,300
DD Megamouth do.

2214
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:35,800
Bob White.

2215
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:38,740
I love this.

2216
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:40,700
I'm a well-known journalist.

2217
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:42,240
I'm going to write your story.

2218
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:44,640
Well, not if you die in the battlefield.

2219
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:45,660
Kill a monster.

2220
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,280
Aguri.

2221
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,400
That's all our guys.

2222
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:52,820
Sonic Eye.

2223
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,520
What did we need money for?

2224
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:57,600
I don't remember.

2225
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:00,260
It was like to expand the base, right?

2226
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:04,400
I guess we just need more money in general, huh?

2227
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:10,040
We have zero anything for Zeke.

2228
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:12,040
It's just an empty, empty room.

2229
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:14,000
So sad.

2230
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:17,060
Peace Walker Zeke.

2231
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:19,580
That'll be us soon.

2232
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:20,460
That'll be us soon.

2233
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:23,040
That'll be us soon.

2234
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:24,800
We did grab...

2235
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:30,700
I guess not the ones that we need.

2236
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,080
This thing always confuses me.

2237
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,000
Even with the tutorial.

2238
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:41,200
I don't think even last time I played I finished it.

2239
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,540
I don't think so.

2240
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:47,600
That's OK.

2241
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,580
Let's do chaff.

2242
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:55,780
This is the strike mark.

2243
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:58,860
I'll hold off for now.

2244
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,960
Night vision goggles.

2245
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:04,140
We could get a shield.

2246
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:11,200
I pray NGS volume 2 has Peace Walker so latecomers like me can play online.

2247
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:12,700
I know, right?

2248
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:14,460
I hope so.

2249
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:15,800
But then, what?

2250
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:16,620
Do I play it again?

2251
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:19,780
Maybe I play it again members or something.

2252
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:28,980
I never did 100% the AI parts myself.

2253
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:30,320
Yeah, it's OK.

2254
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,800
OK, I think.

2255
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:35,840
Again, again.

2256
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:36,900
What's this one?

2257
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:38,060
Oh, this is the surround.

2258
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,920
Maybe the sonic eye.

2259
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:46,880
Maybe not.

2260
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:51,380
I promise you won't get mad.

2261
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:56,280
MGSV was my first ever MGS game because I saw edits of it with Duran Duran.

2262
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:00,080
No way.

2263
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:01,420
That must be pretty recent then.

2264
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:03,720
Night vision goggles.

2265
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,180
We don't need the...

2266
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:12,720
Fulton!

2267
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:17,000
More Fulton!

2268
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:21,620
Alright, you guys ready to fight an... I was going to say an aeroplane.

2269
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:25,540
You guys ready to fight a helicopter?

2270
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:27,660
Helicopter.

2271
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:31,160
That's a very timely meme still, right?

2272
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:35,180
Things everybody still talks about, right?

2273
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:54,020
Get in here, folks!

2274
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,780
I'm looking for the best of the best of the best.

2275
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:03,000
Everybody came in so fast.

2276
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:06,820
Worldwide!

2277
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:07,980
Let's go.

2278
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:12,520
I guess I still need the law, huh?

2279
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:15,140
I have the grenade.

2280
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:15,960
Smoke grenade.

2281
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:18,580
This should be OK actually.

2282
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:26,340
Mark 22 for recruits.

2283
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:29,140
I hate that you're right.

2284
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:38,040
I hate that you're right.

2285
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:47,560
I'm going to bring it so the law will be for the helicopter.

2286
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:52,140
And then this will be for the people and I'll just use my hands for the people.

2287
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:55,020
Mark 22 and M60?

2288
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:55,400
Really?

2289
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:58,260
Maybe the law is kind of slow.

2290
02:17:02,210 --> 02:17:02,910
Replace grenade?

2291
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:04,270
I can't replace it with a weapon.

2292
02:17:06,910 --> 02:17:08,630
Like you can only replace it with...

2293
02:17:11,230 --> 02:17:11,770
What's this?

2294
02:17:11,930 --> 02:17:14,070
Oh wait, actually let me update my...

2295
02:17:14,070 --> 02:17:15,370
Oh, the fault is already updated.

2296
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:16,050
OK, OK, OK.

2297
02:17:28,610 --> 02:17:30,430
Smoke plus trink gun trust.

2298
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:35,050
I'm going to try and use the smoke grenades because I do want to bring these guys home.

2299
02:17:35,810 --> 02:17:38,690
But I don't think I'll... If I smoke...

2300
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:40,370
I mean I could use like a...

2301
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:42,130
Oh wait, I don't have night vision.

2302
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:43,510
Gosh, I keep... I'm sorry.

2303
02:17:43,650 --> 02:17:46,490
I'm in such Ground Zero's brain right now.

2304
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:49,950
Bring curry for the crew.

2305
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:51,310
The curry!

2306
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:53,150
We'll bring curry for the crew.

2307
02:17:53,610 --> 02:17:54,350
Where is it?

2308
02:17:55,410 --> 02:17:56,990
We got some curry.

2309
02:17:57,530 --> 02:17:59,190
Wait, the tortilla chips!

2310
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:00,550
That might be the Doritos.

2311
02:18:01,910 --> 02:18:02,190
No?

2312
02:18:04,850 --> 02:18:05,710
Nah, this is fine.

2313
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:08,270
You guys ready?

2314
02:18:11,770 --> 02:18:12,330
Doritos!

2315
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:12,970
Doritos!

2316
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Silver...

2317
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,460
Silver...

2318
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:32,040
Kino...

2319
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:33,440
Brooks...

2320
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:35,440
And Steak007.

2321
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:38,840
93373.

2322
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:45,880
You were like 007 but also of all the other people that claim to be 007.

2323
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:51,240
Did you try like double... Did you go up from 1 until you got to a number that wasn't taken?

2324
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:55,180
So you were like 0071, 0072, 0073...

2325
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:57,480
And then you had to land on, you know...

2326
02:18:58,380 --> 02:18:58,860
007...

2327
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:00,660
9...

2328
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:03,940
Milm.

2329
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:04,480
Ma'am.

2330
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:05,280
Ma'am.

2331
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:06,220
Not ma'am.

2332
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:07,080
Ma'am.

2333
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:07,740
Man.

2334
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,020
It's the opposite.

2335
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:11,200
It's the opposite.

2336
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:16,760
Alright guys, try to bring some fellas home, OK?

2337
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:20,080
Try to bring some guys home so we can...

2338
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:24,500
So we can have some more armies, OK?

2339
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,480
OK.

2340
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:32,020
Let's find the...

2341
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:37,660
Ouch!

2342
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:39,500
What is wrong with you?

2343
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:42,480
Why did you do this?

2344
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:43,680
Oh my gosh.

2345
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:51,690
Can

2346
02:20:03,910 --> 02:20:04,970
I get some here?

2347
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:06,670
Yeah, let's take some home!

2348
02:20:07,170 --> 02:20:08,090
Let's take some guys home!

2349
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:11,150
Where is the helicopter?

2350
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:13,630
I can't see in my own smoke.

2351
02:20:17,650 --> 02:20:18,250
Ouch!

2352
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:19,770
I tried to leave.

2353
02:20:27,220 --> 02:20:28,160
Where is everybody?

2354
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:30,220
Where is the helicopter?

2355
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:30,940
Oh, there it is.

2356
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:48,390
There you go.

2357
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:48,790
Nice.

2358
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:50,070
Oh, me too?

2359
02:20:50,390 --> 02:20:51,490
Oh, I went the wrong way!

2360
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:54,610
It's just really smoky up in here, OK guys?

2361
02:20:58,850 --> 02:20:59,790
Very good, very good.

2362
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:00,230
Take them home!

2363
02:21:00,330 --> 02:21:00,830
Take them home!

2364
02:21:01,830 --> 02:21:02,650
Take them home!

2365
02:21:04,410 --> 02:21:05,130
Now what?

2366
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:07,890
Yeah, they don't know where we are at.

2367
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:08,470
They are stupid.

2368
02:21:15,890 --> 02:21:20,050
We do also have to take off the ID, so...

2369
02:21:20,050 --> 02:21:23,230
If you guys could like, you know, also attack it.

2370
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:23,890
Oh shoot.

2371
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:25,710
There you go.

2372
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:26,830
Good job team.

2373
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:26,870
Take them.

2374
02:21:35,350 --> 02:21:36,230
Oh no!

2375
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:37,970
Rooks are you OK?

2376
02:21:40,190 --> 02:21:41,250
I saw that.

2377
02:21:41,890 --> 02:21:42,710
How could you miss?

2378
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:45,990
How could you miss?

2379
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:47,310
OK, let's focus on you.

2380
02:21:58,190 --> 02:21:59,270
Good job team!

2381
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,370
Good job team!

2382
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:21,440
Go team go!

2383
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,640
Go team go!

2384
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:25,340
Where is everybody?

2385
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:27,440
They are all gone?

2386
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,680
Good job everybody!

2387
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:30,180
Go team go!

2388
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:31,420
Go team go!

2389
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:37,140
How many troops are in here, right?

2390
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,760
Kept you waiting, huh?

2391
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:58,380
Wow, this thing is really honed in on you guys, huh?

2392
02:23:02,730 --> 02:23:05,130
I'm absolutely chilling over here.

2393
02:23:10,430 --> 02:23:10,950
Guys,

2394
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:30,010
it's up to you!

2395
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:40,160
Oh, that's not my smoke grenade.

2396
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:50,630
Where are you guys?

2397
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:56,600
I can't see anything.

2398
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:00,240
Did we get him?

2399
02:24:00,980 --> 02:24:01,700
Good job team.

2400
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:03,660
I don't think I did anything, but that's alright.

2401
02:24:06,580 --> 02:24:12,250
I could throw... Oh wait, supply!

2402
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:22,200
RT

2403
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:28,080
That's not what I asked for.

2404
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:35,510
That's not what I expected.

2405
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:39,150
OK, there we go, there we go.

2406
02:24:39,230 --> 02:24:39,710
We're fine.

2407
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:41,830
We

2408
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:53,840
need a cardboard box.

2409
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:01,820
Come

2410
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:06,470
on team!

2411
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:09,690
It's just a single helicopter!

2412
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:09,810
Good!

2413
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:13,490
Solid Snake can do this in his sleep!

2414
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:17,970
This thing is really beefy.

2415
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:21,130
Dang, they don't make Hind D's like they used to, huh?

2416
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:43,960
Hey Rook, you doing alright?

2417
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:45,360
You doing OK?

2418
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:47,320
Did you just drop some more chips?

2419
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:49,180
Oh, thank you!

2420
02:26:03,090 --> 02:26:04,050
Rook, Rook, Rook, Rook!

2421
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:25,260
Oh shit, I didn't think that was gonna hit me.

2422
02:27:01,010 --> 02:27:02,070
You got him?

2423
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:10,700
That guy right there?

2424
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:12,900
We can take him down.

2425
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:15,780
We can take him.

2426
02:27:29,250 --> 02:27:31,070
You can also tranq the leader?

2427
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:31,650
You can?

2428
02:27:33,470 --> 02:27:34,310
Where is he?

2429
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:34,950
Wait!

2430
02:27:35,490 --> 02:27:36,410
Let's get the leader!

2431
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:37,210
Let's tranq him!

2432
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:39,950
Nevermind.

2433
02:27:40,170 --> 02:27:41,010
Wait, you got him.

2434
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:42,210
How did you get him so fast?

2435
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:44,170
How did you get him so fast?

2436
02:27:47,450 --> 02:27:48,630
Why did you do that?

2437
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:49,450
Who did that?

2438
02:27:50,150 --> 02:27:51,010
What the heck?

2439
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:55,170
What the heck?

2440
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:03,200
High caliber tranq sniper.

2441
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:04,240
Very good!

2442
02:28:12,390 --> 02:28:13,610
Good

2443
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:19,940
job!

2444
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:21,240
Damn!

2445
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:26,490
Oh my gosh, our camaraderie was great!

2446
02:28:30,970 --> 02:28:32,190
Seventeen!

2447
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:35,790
Seventeen people!

2448
02:28:37,030 --> 02:28:37,850
Sneaking suit!

2449
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:44,250
Good job team!

2450
02:28:47,690 --> 02:28:54,570
What do you mean by that?

2451
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:57,250
Yeah I don't...oh no

2452
02:29:02,250 --> 02:29:08,270
I think we can!

2453
02:29:20,650 --> 02:29:24,610
The power of Boss Mito and her culinary team at full display.

2454
02:29:26,310 --> 02:29:30,430
I need to find my eye drops.

2455
02:29:37,330 --> 02:29:38,630
Shock builds character.

2456
02:29:38,730 --> 02:29:40,190
They need to know what we are all about.

2457
02:29:42,010 --> 02:29:44,530
They need to know what we are all about.

2458
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:47,310
Delivery!

2459
02:29:48,490 --> 02:29:49,250
Really?

2460
02:29:50,010 --> 02:29:50,410
Lemon.

2461
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:52,610
Tarpon.

2462
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:57,290
Oh my gosh, every single one of those guys got sent to the brig.

2463
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:58,730
No way!

2464
02:30:02,550 --> 02:30:03,310
Rooks!

2465
02:30:04,050 --> 02:30:04,770
Thank you!

2466
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:14,790
Is that all you said?

2467
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:16,010
What is it?

2468
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:25,630
A magazine for inside the love box.

2469
02:30:26,650 --> 02:30:28,110
Go, go, go!

2470
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:34,030
Is it all tortilla chips?

2471
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,050
All tortilla chips!

2472
02:30:41,730 --> 02:30:42,750
Thank you very much.

2473
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:51,160
I'm craving some Doritos now for real.

2474
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:58,720
My monitor arm that was supposed to come today was delayed to tomorrow.

2475
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:01,820
Can you use your Metal Gear Zeke to smite those responsible?

2476
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:03,360
I will!

2477
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:05,000
Gosh, that's the worst.

2478
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:09,960
That's actually the worst when you are looking forward to something and you are like it's going to come today, it's going to come today...

2479
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:11,080
And then it doesn't!

2480
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:15,200
Awful.

2481
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:22,020
For now...

2482
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,660
For now I think we are okay.

2483
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:29,720
Make the rocket launcher, you'll need it for Miku.

2484
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:35,250
It's after this one.

2485
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:38,090
Or the one after.

2486
02:31:39,370 --> 02:31:42,510
We have a little bit of time between next Miku.

2487
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:48,890
Actually, oh wait, but I do want to... Then I need to develop it, because it needs time to develop.

2488
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:50,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2489
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:51,950
We need it.

2490
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:55,150
I was thinking about it, I was like...

2491
02:31:57,290 --> 02:31:59,390
But it's not just a one and done baby.

2492
02:32:03,730 --> 02:32:04,210
Okay.

2493
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:06,050
Oh, and our guys.

2494
02:32:06,210 --> 02:32:07,650
I forgot to... Oh, we only have two guys.

2495
02:32:10,150 --> 02:32:10,630
Spitter...

2496
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:12,490
And grouper.

2497
02:32:13,550 --> 02:32:14,030
Spitter?

2498
02:32:14,450 --> 02:32:15,330
I hardly grouper.

2499
02:32:20,570 --> 02:32:22,410
Don't forget to change your weapon this time.

2500
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:23,490
I know, I know!

2501
02:32:23,490 --> 02:32:23,550
I know!

2502
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:33,120
Thanks for taking out that helicopter with me boss.

2503
02:32:33,580 --> 02:32:33,780
Yeah!

2504
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:37,760
Getting to play my favorite franchise in multiplayer in 2025 was such a treat.

2505
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:40,780
And playing with my other two?

2506
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:42,980
What do you mean?

2507
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:44,800
WSF forever!

2508
02:32:49,390 --> 02:32:50,370
My Oshi.

2509
02:32:50,570 --> 02:32:54,130
All good.

2510
02:32:58,010 --> 02:32:58,410
Walkman!

2511
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:00,350
Wait, hold on though.

2512
02:33:01,970 --> 02:33:03,270
I was waiting for this.

2513
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:04,710
We are so close.

2514
02:33:06,130 --> 02:33:06,490
No!

2515
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:11,090
I don't have enough money.

2516
02:33:11,210 --> 02:33:12,070
Wait, can I go into debt?

2517
02:33:12,330 --> 02:33:13,030
I can!

2518
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:15,790
I'm in debt, I'm in debt, I'm in debt, I'm in debt.

2519
02:33:18,290 --> 02:33:18,690
Yes.

2520
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:21,270
We'll get more money, don't worry.

2521
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:24,610
My Minto merch arrived today.

2522
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:26,250
I'm Minto3, best day ever!

2523
02:33:27,390 --> 02:33:27,950
Munekin!

2524
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:30,010
Thank you for getting it.

2525
02:33:30,350 --> 02:33:31,630
Let's recruit some guys too.

2526
02:33:32,070 --> 02:33:33,010
I'm sending out a notice.

2527
02:33:33,430 --> 02:33:37,810
Who would like to join Minto-san's Frontiers?

2528
02:33:39,310 --> 02:33:42,210
I'm putting out a search at this very moment.

2529
02:33:47,030 --> 02:33:49,270
Wait, I thought we weren't supposed to be...

2530
02:33:53,110 --> 02:33:55,810
I thought we weren't supposed to be so heavy handed.

2531
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:12,300
I'm the real deal?

2532
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:15,020
Upskirts.

2533
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:38,480
Okay.

2534
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:40,260
I'm scared.

2535
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:44,080
Hello!

2536
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:46,540
Oh you?

2537
02:34:48,860 --> 02:34:49,280
Good second.

2538
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:58,220
Did I get him?

2539
02:35:00,140 --> 02:35:01,540
This guy is tough.

2540
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:02,940
Still?

2541
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:05,880
Go down!

2542
02:35:15,350 --> 02:35:17,470
I thought I was going to be running through the jungle.

2543
02:35:18,410 --> 02:35:21,990
Managing to capture a Hein with one of my two OG's Ember Wisps.

2544
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:23,550
One of my favorite franchises.

2545
02:35:24,290 --> 02:35:24,970
Life is good.

2546
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:26,650
Thanks Snake.

2547
02:35:28,010 --> 02:35:29,070
Thanks for joining.

2548
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:30,210
That was a lot of fun.

2549
02:35:32,190 --> 02:35:35,370
Wow, they must have really liked me.

2550
02:35:36,270 --> 02:35:38,870
We gave up our homes, but we're still alive.

2551
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:39,930
We're still fighting.

2552
02:35:40,430 --> 02:35:42,830
There, there.

2553
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:43,930
You're always going to get interrupted.

2554
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:47,310
Nice.

2555
02:35:49,210 --> 02:35:50,870
Nice and nice and nice.

2556
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:53,110
I wonder how good they are.

2557
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:56,890
Cabbage what?

2558
02:35:58,570 --> 02:35:59,010
Rattlesnake!

2559
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:03,150
No, please no!

2560
02:36:03,650 --> 02:36:03,850
No!

2561
02:36:08,190 --> 02:36:09,430
I'm in trouble.

2562
02:36:15,890 --> 02:36:16,610
Nice.

2563
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:19,570
We at least got one good guy.

2564
02:36:22,390 --> 02:36:23,930
I'm not in debt anymore.

2565
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:25,370
Continue the development.

2566
02:36:28,850 --> 02:36:30,910
We're not in debt anymore.

2567
02:36:31,410 --> 02:36:32,650
Continue the development.

2568
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:36,570
Make my stuff.

2569
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:49,010
OK.

2570
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:50,810
I'm excited.

2571
02:36:51,170 --> 02:36:52,210
Who's joining me today?

2572
02:36:52,930 --> 02:36:54,730
We're going into the jungle.

2573
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:55,630
Well, we've been in the jungle.

2574
02:36:55,790 --> 02:36:57,350
We're going into the ruins.

2575
02:36:57,890 --> 02:36:59,910
This is like a very special job, OK?

2576
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:03,330
Whoever comes in, you've got to be special.

2577
02:37:05,090 --> 02:37:05,570
Maubius!

2578
02:37:06,030 --> 02:37:06,950
You're special.

2579
02:37:08,630 --> 02:37:10,150
OK, I'm going to change my stuff.

2580
02:37:10,330 --> 02:37:10,790
Oh wait.

2581
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:13,050
Do I need to?

2582
02:37:13,290 --> 02:37:14,670
Oh wait, actually...

2583
02:37:14,670 --> 02:37:19,290
I am going to bring only non-lethal stuff.

2584
02:37:19,290 --> 02:37:20,370
I hope you don't mind.

2585
02:37:21,050 --> 02:37:21,990
And I got the card.

2586
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:26,210
Let's go!

2587
02:37:26,310 --> 02:37:27,150
Reporting for duty!

2588
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:31,670
Let's go!

2589
02:37:34,070 --> 02:37:34,770
Sneak suit?

2590
02:37:34,830 --> 02:37:35,990
I've got to develop that still.

2591
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:37,370
No?

2592
02:37:38,510 --> 02:37:39,650
I've got to develop it, no?

2593
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:54,020
Oh I obtained it.

2594
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:57,860
I'll switch later.

2595
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:04,740
Is it all the fatigues you don't have to develop?

2596
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:06,680
Those are automatic?

2597
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:09,960
I feel like the sneaking suit is special, no?

2598
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:12,200
Wow.

2599
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,040
Hello!

2600
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:21,280
Alright Maubius, I don't have anything secret to tell you because I have everything...

2601
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:23,700
Wait, is there anything in here?

2602
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:27,140
They'll never hear me coming.

2603
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:29,420
Never hear you coming!

2604
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:34,200
Alright, alright.

2605
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:35,240
Let's keep going.

2606
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:40,020
It is this way, yeah?

2607
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:45,760
Let's go baby!

2608
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:49,400
Let's go baby.

2609
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:52,880
Look, we could've avoided the helicopter, but...

2610
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:55,200
I think Kazuhiro Miller is trying to sabotage us.

2611
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:01,080
Alright.

2612
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:07,380
Dirt?

2613
02:39:10,460 --> 02:39:12,800
Do you see any guys?

2614
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:17,340
I'm looking with my special...

2615
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:19,760
Will they hear this?

2616
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:26,320
Clearly not.

2617
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:39,320
I'm scared.

2618
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:44,820
Thanks.

2619
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,420
Wait, how are you so far ahead?

2620
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:47,860
Wait!

2621
02:39:48,340 --> 02:39:49,080
Wait for me!

2622
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:56,620
Are you taking them home?

2623
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,380
I can do it.

2624
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:04,300
They're coming home.

2625
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:08,760
Where is the laser sight at?

2626
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:09,780
Did I already get that guy?

2627
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:10,560
Because I'm too good?

2628
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:14,080
Oh, you got another guy down over there!

2629
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:14,860
I see him.

2630
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:17,860
You're so good.

2631
02:40:18,100 --> 02:40:18,820
You're fast.

2632
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:19,160
Wow.

2633
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,120
Alright, nice.

2634
02:40:20,660 --> 02:40:21,480
Nice speed running.

2635
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:25,060
Alright.

2636
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:25,480
Alright.

2637
02:40:31,910 --> 02:40:34,220
We continue onward.

2638
02:40:34,800 --> 02:40:36,300
We continue onward.

2639
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:44,100
I wonder if they'll hear me again next time.

2640
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:50,380
Do you see anyone?

2641
02:40:53,170 --> 02:40:54,770
Do you see anyone?

2642
02:40:55,870 --> 02:40:57,570
I don't see anyone.

2643
02:40:58,090 --> 02:41:01,230
Oh you do?

2644
02:41:02,750 --> 02:41:03,310
Where is he?

2645
02:41:05,250 --> 02:41:06,310
Where is he at?

2646
02:41:09,830 --> 02:41:11,410
I don't see anyone.

2647
02:41:17,770 --> 02:41:18,350
Where?

2648
02:41:20,090 --> 02:41:21,630
Do you guys see anyone?

2649
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:32,190
Wait.

2650
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:33,350
I just heard a guy.

2651
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:36,430
Maybe?

2652
02:41:38,270 --> 02:41:39,210
Where is he at?

2653
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:49,360
This part makes me so nervous.

2654
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:51,440
Where are they?

2655
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:54,820
I'm gonna take this guy home.

2656
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:55,940
No!

2657
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:55,980
Hello!

2658
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:01,400
He's so loud, right?

2659
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:02,900
Oh, is he behind the wall?

2660
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:05,120
Oh, he's in here maybe?

2661
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:11,020
Oh my gosh.

2662
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:13,160
Oh my gosh.

2663
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:14,280
The prisoner!

2664
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:19,780
Is somebody there?

2665
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:29,020
I'm gonna switch to not my, you know, my sniper if I don't need it.

2666
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:30,400
Is somebody there?

2667
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:33,240
Oh!

2668
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:34,780
Oh my God!

2669
02:42:35,380 --> 02:42:36,780
I would have never seen him coming.

2670
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:39,500
Damn!

2671
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:44,180
Yeah, rob him of all his worth.

2672
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:45,600
Oh, he's got Lime Soda!

2673
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:49,780
You're coming home with me.

2674
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:51,820
Dang, you know where all the guys are.

2675
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:55,620
I love people when they play games a lot.

2676
02:42:58,080 --> 02:42:59,260
Oh, I see him too.

2677
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:04,200
I'm just gonna take him out.

2678
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:06,460
Look at him.

2679
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:07,560
He's already asleep.

2680
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:09,320
What are you, the end?

2681
02:43:11,060 --> 02:43:11,940
What are you, the end?

2682
02:43:13,880 --> 02:43:14,600
Impressive.

2683
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:16,880
No, you showed me!

2684
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:17,720
You showed me!

2685
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,360
Is that it?

2686
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:36,320
Let's keep going baby.

2687
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:38,280
Going well.

2688
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:40,800
Bird.

2689
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:47,580
Bird.

2690
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:51,900
Oh my gosh, could it be a lovely lady?

2691
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:58,670
Oh,

2692
02:44:02,390 --> 02:44:03,030
she's French.

2693
02:44:04,310 --> 02:44:04,990
French.

2694
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:08,730
Cash, cash.

2695
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:10,570
A cash, cash.

2696
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:21,430
Cecile!

2697
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:25,610
Ok guys, if I look it's not my fault.

2698
02:44:25,710 --> 02:44:26,670
She's just like that.

2699
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:33,210
French.

2700
02:44:37,550 --> 02:44:38,330
Cash, cash.

2701
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:51,150
The pretzel?

2702
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:55,970
Yeah, the pretzel.

2703
02:45:08,590 --> 02:45:10,430
I'm also...

2704
02:45:10,430 --> 02:45:12,970
I am also an ornithologist.

2705
02:45:14,810 --> 02:45:15,630
The pretzel?

2706
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:17,410
Yeah, we the pretzel.

2707
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:22,590
Oh my god, we gave her Mountain Dew.

2708
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:32,670
Oh, how is this American drink is...

2709
02:45:32,670 --> 02:45:34,810
So, it's disgusting.

2710
02:45:40,010 --> 02:45:42,970
As you would say, it's disgusting.

2711
02:45:51,650 --> 02:45:52,870
That's me saying this.

2712
02:46:00,770 --> 02:46:02,270
You can hear it.

2713
02:46:03,190 --> 02:46:05,150
And then you also hear Hatsune Miku's song.

2714
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:11,070
That's right, remember?

2715
02:46:11,290 --> 02:46:13,010
Last time we heard the boss's voice.

2716
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:13,990
But why?

2717
02:46:15,310 --> 02:46:16,730
Will you play the newest MGS?

2718
02:46:16,910 --> 02:46:17,250
Of course!

2719
02:46:34,450 --> 02:46:37,050
Out of her own kindness, obvious.

2720
02:46:40,030 --> 02:46:40,670
Obviously.

2721
02:46:45,890 --> 02:46:49,250
Out of the kindness of her heart, she bathes you.

2722
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:51,050
How'd you escape?

2723
02:46:51,730 --> 02:46:53,250
I waited for an opening.

2724
02:46:53,730 --> 02:46:55,050
Stole an ID card.

2725
02:46:55,790 --> 02:46:58,830
They almost caught me, but I managed to elude them.

2726
02:46:59,950 --> 02:47:01,450
There's a pretzel right above you.

2727
02:47:03,070 --> 02:47:06,390
I was barefoot, with no supplies.

2728
02:47:11,250 --> 02:47:12,090
Mountain Dew.

2729
02:47:12,870 --> 02:47:14,270
I am so sorry.

2730
02:47:15,210 --> 02:47:16,070
I drank it all.

2731
02:47:17,190 --> 02:47:17,930
She's so cute.

2732
02:47:17,930 --> 02:47:22,110
That facility... did you see anybody else in there?

2733
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:27,250
Well, there was another woman, but I never saw her in person.

2734
02:47:29,250 --> 02:47:31,390
Because, you know, the blindfold.

2735
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:34,410
Oh yes!

2736
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:36,050
She often sang.

2737
02:47:37,090 --> 02:47:37,650
Sang?

2738
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:38,710
Hatsune Miku.

2739
02:47:38,810 --> 02:47:40,150
It was such a strange song.

2740
02:47:42,690 --> 02:47:44,350
What kind of person was she?

2741
02:47:44,590 --> 02:47:46,270
Could you tell anything from her voice?

2742
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:47,490
I don't know.

2743
02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:49,830
I don't even know why I was held a prisoner.

2744
02:47:51,390 --> 02:47:57,770
They confiscated my equipment, my supplies, my passport, money... everything.

2745
02:47:58,630 --> 02:48:01,870
The only thing I was allowed to keep were my undergarments.

2746
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:05,030
So that I would not be able to escape.

2747
02:48:05,850 --> 02:48:09,110
And now, I am without even the means to prove who I am.

2748
02:48:09,730 --> 02:48:11,910
I will not make it home to Paris like this.

2749
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:12,730
No Paris!

2750
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:23,090
Yeah, we can call everyone Lizard.

2751
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:25,410
And Monkey.

2752
02:48:34,970 --> 02:48:37,390
Ok man, beggars can't be choosers.

2753
02:48:37,390 --> 02:48:37,690
Ok.

2754
02:48:41,150 --> 02:48:42,190
Wow, he's risen her up.

2755
02:48:52,350 --> 02:48:57,870
Did it hurt when you fell from Outer Heaven?

2756
02:49:06,930 --> 02:49:07,390
No.

2757
02:49:07,970 --> 02:49:08,970
There was a tube.

2758
02:49:09,550 --> 02:49:10,890
A large tube in the back.

2759
02:49:11,510 --> 02:49:13,610
When I approached it, I heard a voice.

2760
02:49:14,210 --> 02:49:15,190
What did it say?

2761
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:16,470
Jack.

2762
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:21,030
Yes, it simply said Jack over and over.

2763
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:24,830
Jack?

2764
02:49:26,310 --> 02:49:28,330
Listen, you've got to get me out of here.

2765
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:29,390
I really need a shower.

2766
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:30,670
Wait here.

2767
02:49:30,950 --> 02:49:32,570
I still got business to take care of.

2768
02:49:32,590 --> 02:49:32,830
What?

2769
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,870
You're not thinking of going in there, are you?

2770
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:36,370
You can't leave me here.

2771
02:49:36,370 --> 02:49:38,710
I'll have some friends pick her up.

2772
02:49:40,130 --> 02:49:41,190
We have a...oh.

2773
02:49:41,870 --> 02:49:43,530
He's going to be very excited.

2774
02:49:45,530 --> 02:49:46,990
It's a woman!

2775
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:47,530
It's a woman!

2776
02:49:47,950 --> 02:49:48,750
It's a lady!

2777
02:49:48,910 --> 02:49:49,390
Lady!

2778
02:49:50,090 --> 02:49:50,550
Lady!

2779
02:49:55,510 --> 02:49:56,230
Female!

2780
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:02,550
Female.

2781
02:50:02,790 --> 02:50:03,570
Kazuhira Miller.

2782
02:50:06,370 --> 02:50:07,750
So she's safe then.

2783
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:08,790
Good news.

2784
02:50:09,390 --> 02:50:11,330
I'm sure Paz will be glad to hear it.

2785
02:50:11,790 --> 02:50:12,210
You bet.

2786
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:15,130
Snake, the ruins are just up ahead.

2787
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:16,430
Head north.

2788
02:50:16,630 --> 02:50:17,390
On my way.

2789
02:50:17,870 --> 02:50:18,930
On my way!

2790
02:50:19,250 --> 02:50:19,970
What about me?

2791
02:50:20,430 --> 02:50:21,550
What about me?

2792
02:50:21,690 --> 02:50:22,950
What about me?

2793
02:50:33,070 --> 02:50:35,170
We acquired Cecile.

2794
02:50:36,690 --> 02:50:37,150
Yay!

2795
02:50:39,910 --> 02:50:40,710
Oh that's right.

2796
02:50:40,750 --> 02:50:41,610
Just a little bit more.

2797
02:50:45,450 --> 02:50:45,910
Wait.

2798
02:50:48,730 --> 02:50:50,170
I'm going to switch to my...

2799
02:50:50,810 --> 02:50:51,890
Can they hear this?

2800
02:51:01,190 --> 02:51:02,630
I don't think they can.

2801
02:51:02,950 --> 02:51:03,790
I think they're really silly.

2802
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:10,410
Thank you!

2803
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:20,280
Morbius!

2804
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:22,560
Oh.

2805
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:23,380
I see him right there.

2806
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:23,780
I see him.

2807
02:51:23,900 --> 02:51:24,280
You got him.

2808
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:24,860
You got him.

2809
02:51:25,100 --> 02:51:25,640
You got him.

2810
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:26,240
Oh.

2811
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:27,540
He's looking this way.

2812
02:51:28,880 --> 02:51:30,200
He's looking directly at you.

2813
02:51:31,220 --> 02:51:32,080
You got this.

2814
02:51:37,670 --> 02:51:38,030
Oh.

2815
02:51:38,430 --> 02:51:39,070
Get him in the butt.

2816
02:51:40,230 --> 02:51:41,830
Oh there's like a bunch of them.

2817
02:51:44,650 --> 02:51:45,670
I think they'll hear that.

2818
02:51:47,810 --> 02:51:48,870
What's wrong?

2819
02:51:51,850 --> 02:51:53,010
Get him out!

2820
02:51:57,220 --> 02:51:57,980
Nice!

2821
02:51:58,580 --> 02:51:59,960
We got this!

2822
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:07,020
Don't even need to...

2823
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:11,480
Oh.

2824
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:12,920
I see him.

2825
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:16,040
Wait.

2826
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:18,900
I want to take you home.

2827
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:20,060
No!

2828
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:21,460
Dang it.

2829
02:52:21,460 --> 02:52:23,960
I couldn't line up my shot fast enough.

2830
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,580
Why do you take what?

2831
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,360
What do you mean?

2832
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:28,960
Oh.

2833
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:29,620
There's a guy over here.

2834
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:30,040
I'll get him.

2835
02:52:31,740 --> 02:52:32,040
Uh oh.

2836
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:33,500
This is my last one.

2837
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:37,120
Wait.

2838
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:40,120
Are there any... I think there's some prisoners around here.

2839
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:40,320
No?

2840
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:44,220
Or am I crazy?

2841
02:52:45,140 --> 02:52:46,320
Are there prisoners here?

2842
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:47,420
Spin for yes!

2843
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:51,600
Maybe?

2844
02:52:54,620 --> 02:52:57,480
Do you have...

2845
02:52:58,460 --> 02:52:59,360
No.

2846
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:08,300
Do you have a fulton?

2847
02:53:13,170 --> 02:53:14,010
Do you have a fulton?

2848
02:53:17,190 --> 02:53:18,310
Oh no!

2849
02:53:20,190 --> 02:53:22,030
Oh no!

2850
02:53:24,070 --> 02:53:24,790
Oh man.

2851
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:31,820
Oh no.

2852
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:32,200
It's ok.

2853
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:33,420
You didn't have to use that.

2854
02:53:34,120 --> 02:53:35,160
It's not that important.

2855
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:37,440
I had one too.

2856
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:41,560
Oh they didn't give me... Ok.

2857
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:41,820
Hold on.

2858
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:42,200
Let me try.

2859
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:51,060
Land on me.

2860
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:55,040
No!

2861
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:56,480
They didn't give me any!

2862
02:53:56,940 --> 02:53:57,740
What?

2863
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:00,080
Stingy!

2864
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:02,760
It's probably because I ran out...

2865
02:54:03,880 --> 02:54:05,380
Stingy guys!

2866
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:07,020
Um.

2867
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:08,360
Sorry prisoner.

2868
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:13,920
Sorry prisoner.

2869
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:19,120
Sorry.

2870
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:21,040
I knocked him out.

2871
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:22,900
I couldn't...

2872
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:24,480
Ok.

2873
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:25,080
Let's just go.

2874
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:27,520
My fault.

2875
02:54:27,580 --> 02:54:28,100
No, it's ok.

2876
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:34,900
It'll take two people.

2877
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:39,560
It'll take two... people.

2878
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:43,180
No, drag them back to the pickup mechanic here.

2879
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:44,740
Unfortunately, no.

2880
02:54:44,740 --> 02:54:49,120
V makes a lot of improvements.

2881
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:51,900
Well, improvements and also...

2882
02:54:51,900 --> 02:54:55,700
They added the realism of the... What's it called?

2883
02:54:56,500 --> 02:55:00,660
So basically in this game you can fulton anybody indoors or outdoors.

2884
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:03,880
But...

2885
02:55:03,880 --> 02:55:06,060
She blocked him!

2886
02:55:06,060 --> 02:55:07,100
Damn!

2887
02:55:12,860 --> 02:55:14,480
She blocked him!

2888
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:15,460
She hates him!

2889
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:17,400
She hates him!

2890
02:55:17,860 --> 02:55:19,140
She hates him!

2891
02:55:20,160 --> 02:55:23,720
Yeah, in this game you can fulton anybody from anywhere but...

2892
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:27,040
In V...

2893
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:30,320
You have to drag them outside.

2894
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:32,900
Until you get improved ones.

2895
02:55:37,620 --> 02:55:38,880
I still got a prisoner?

2896
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:40,900
When did I get that?

2897
02:55:44,340 --> 02:55:45,460
Oh versus.

2898
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:48,760
Until the wormhole.

2899
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:07,660
lol

2900
02:56:13,460 --> 02:56:20,260
I was never exactly her favorite.

2901
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:27,160
So...

2902
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:30,520
In my bedroom.

2903
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:31,400
I mean...

2904
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:47,960
lol Oh my god, Cecile's Ace Combat era.

2905
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:49,160
Relatable.

2906
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:52,940
Yeah, how relatable.

2907
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:14,460
Oh no.

2908
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:15,980
We have to listen for the cat cell.

2909
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,480
We have to listen for the cat cell.

2910
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:31,880
Wait, she just took a bird?

2911
02:57:31,880 --> 02:57:32,600
lol

2912
02:57:36,580 --> 02:57:39,040
She's such a trickster.

2913
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:43,380
lol What's that?

2914
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:45,740
You took a bird?

2915
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:49,340
I thought it was under the tree.

2916
02:57:55,620 --> 02:57:56,460
Oh Snake.

2917
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:58,280
He's such a silly goose.

2918
02:58:02,700 --> 02:58:03,300
Nice.

2919
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:17,880
Strange.

2920
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:19,900
Sus.

2921
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:24,060
Orange jacket.

2922
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:26,600
Alright.

2923
02:58:29,360 --> 02:58:30,540
Should I do this one on my own?

2924
02:58:33,360 --> 02:58:34,640
How do I want to do this?

2925
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:37,860
Because I don't want to play with someone that knows where they are.

2926
02:58:38,720 --> 02:58:39,340
You know what I mean?

2927
02:58:40,940 --> 02:58:42,700
We take men all the time.

2928
02:58:42,860 --> 02:58:44,960
Can we really criticize her for taking birds?

2929
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:48,700
Oh yes, Cecile.

2930
02:58:51,460 --> 02:58:52,600
Yay, all of our stuff.

2931
02:58:56,380 --> 02:58:56,780
Delivery!

2932
02:58:57,440 --> 02:58:57,840
Delivery.

2933
02:58:57,840 --> 02:59:00,160
Uh oh, Yellowtail, why are you sick?

2934
02:59:00,980 --> 02:59:01,720
What did you eat?

2935
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:03,840
Cicada.

2936
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:04,360
Robin.

2937
02:59:05,580 --> 02:59:06,100
Caribou.

2938
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:07,860
Staff has not been assigned to a team.

2939
02:59:08,660 --> 02:59:11,800
Oh, did I not do that last time?

2940
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:17,260
Doritos.

2941
02:59:17,820 --> 02:59:19,200
Oh Morbius, thank you!

2942
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:20,780
Morbius.

2943
02:59:20,780 --> 02:59:20,820
Morbius.

2944
02:59:26,780 --> 02:59:28,640
Thank you for the full team!

2945
02:59:33,900 --> 02:59:35,900
Sleep gas mine.

2946
02:59:36,520 --> 02:59:36,680
Nice.

2947
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:40,340
Wait, how does that work?

2948
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:43,340
Solid.

2949
02:59:43,620 --> 02:59:43,940
Liquid.

2950
02:59:44,400 --> 02:59:45,040
Solidus!

2951
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:49,040
Those are good, aren't they?

2952
02:59:50,060 --> 02:59:51,540
Everyone keeps sending them to me.

2953
02:59:54,340 --> 02:59:55,460

2954
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:57,700

2957
03:00:03,460 --> 03:00:06,780
Thanks Mito for letting me help you to open the way.

2958
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:08,860
Another day in the office for me.

2959
03:00:09,500 --> 03:00:10,640
You can count on me anytime.

2960
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:12,080
Thank you!

2961
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:14,100

Komodo Dragon.

2964
03:00:19,640 --> 03:00:23,920
Boss, if you find me lying face down on the battlefield, you gotta revive me.

2965
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:26,960
But no mouth to mouth, please.

2966
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:29,260
I want Komodo Dragon off my base.

2967
03:00:29,780 --> 03:00:31,020
He is not a team player.

2968
03:00:31,820 --> 03:00:32,520

Gosh, she is so beautiful, right guys?

2985
03:00:58,700 --> 03:01:01,160
How can he say no mouth to mouth from Snake?

2986
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:02,260
That's what I'm saying.

2987
03:01:03,880 --> 03:01:06,320
Look how beautiful she is.

2988
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:12,820
Wow!

2989
03:01:13,420 --> 03:01:14,220
Madam!

2990
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:18,060

2991
03:01:18,940 --> 03:01:18,940
Madam!

2992
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:25,260
Thank you Kojima!

2993
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:26,900

03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:37,060
That's all of them.

2998
03:01:37,060 --> 03:01:38,840
Still no leech, you guys.

2999
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:41,700
Assault Rifle.

3000
03:01:43,020 --> 03:01:44,340

Words and deeds.

3007
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:02,900
I'm not regretting them.

3008
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:05,920
Oh my goodness, we have so many things.

3009
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:08,000
Holy moly!

3010
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:10,780
Make.

3011
03:02:21,130 --> 03:02:23,030
What else do we have in here?

3012
03:02:24,670 --> 03:02:25,610
Our Walkman.

3013
03:02:31,050 --> 03:02:31,810
Glovebox.

3014
03:02:32,810 --> 03:02:33,850
What makes it better?

3015
03:02:34,850 --> 03:02:36,050
Bigger cardboard box.

3016
03:02:36,170 --> 03:02:37,110

3017
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:39,130

Night vision.

3019
03:02:49,230 --> 03:02:49,710
Hmm...

3020
03:02:51,230 --> 03:02:52,450
We could do...

3021
03:02:56,270 --> 03:02:57,030
Baby car!

3022
03:02:57,410 --> 03:02:58,550
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

3023
03:02:58,670 --> 03:02:59,350
Thank you.

3024
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:01,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3025
03:03:02,730 --> 03:03:03,610
Big box.

3026
03:03:03,970 --> 03:03:05,630
Night vision goggles and Walkman.

3027
03:03:12,140 --> 03:03:14,340
Get more Fulton stuff with the landmines.

3028
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:15,520
What do you mean landmines?

3029
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:17,940
I didn't have that.

3030
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:25,400
Hmm...

3031
03:03:25,400 --> 03:03:26,160
I

3032
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:31,480
don't know what I want to make.

3033
03:03:32,040 --> 03:03:33,220
I have all this money.

3034
03:03:33,700 --> 03:03:35,820
And too much indecision.

3035
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:39,800
There is a Fulton landmine that comes up later.

3036
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:41,840
I

3037
03:03:45,220 --> 03:03:47,880
think people have been giving it to me, right?

3038
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:54,720
This one?

3039
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:57,100
No, this is the gas mine.

3040
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:05,380
Actually, how do you use this?

3041
03:04:05,460 --> 03:04:05,740
Oh, wait.

3042
03:04:05,900 --> 03:04:10,020
Sleeping automatically executes Fulton recovery on targets after they fall asleep.

3043
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,180
How do you use this?

3044
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:21,330
I prefer non-lethal probably.

3045
03:04:25,880 --> 03:04:28,220
You have to get them to patrol into it.

3046
03:04:28,320 --> 03:04:29,600
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

3047
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:32,340
Chap is useful against boss fights.

3048
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:33,040
That is true.

3049
03:04:33,320 --> 03:04:34,280
That is true.

3050
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:36,760
We'll at least do that.

3051
03:04:36,880 --> 03:04:37,960
I think we'll be good.

3052
03:04:37,960 --> 03:04:40,180
I'm going to hold off for now.

3053
03:04:40,360 --> 03:04:42,040
Until we have a more...

3054
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:43,640
Maybe we'll get something else too.

3055
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:46,460
That will be good and require a lot of GMP.

3056
03:04:48,300 --> 03:04:48,740
Alright.

3057
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:55,080
Yes!

3058
03:04:57,560 --> 03:04:58,520
Orange jacket!

3059
03:05:00,380 --> 03:05:01,700
Orange and Kettle.

3060
03:05:08,260 --> 03:05:09,640
Body check.

3061
03:05:10,500 --> 03:05:10,740
Okay.

3062
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:14,460
Alrighty.

3063
03:05:18,580 --> 03:05:22,060
This should be fine.

3064
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:25,460
This should be... Wait, maybe...

3065
03:05:26,100 --> 03:05:28,320
Oh, it also switched to Fulton 3.

3066
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:29,560
Yippee!

3067
03:05:32,980 --> 03:05:33,600
Combat.

3068
03:05:34,240 --> 03:05:34,980
Oh, Micmac.

3069
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:36,020
Hello.

3070
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:39,400
Should I stealth too?

3071
03:05:40,500 --> 03:05:41,360
Where is my stealth?

3072
03:05:43,100 --> 03:05:44,380
I love the beach.

3073
03:05:44,740 --> 03:05:45,340
Wait.

3074
03:05:46,760 --> 03:05:48,300
I want that one.

3075
03:05:48,900 --> 03:05:50,060
I don't have it yet.

3076
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:52,120
I love the beach.

3077
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:52,880
Oh, there it is.

3078
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:53,220
Sneaking.

3079
03:05:54,140 --> 03:05:54,400
Stealth.

3080
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:57,420
Oh, I forgot.

3081
03:05:57,660 --> 03:05:57,780
Wait.

3082
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:07,100
I don't really need the love box, but whatever.

3083
03:06:10,480 --> 03:06:14,530
Oh, I don't need the ID card anymore.

3084
03:06:16,470 --> 03:06:17,190
Walkman.

3085
03:06:22,010 --> 03:06:24,810
Maybe the speak to sound thing?

3086
03:06:24,890 --> 03:06:26,550
If we are searching for a bird.

3087
03:06:28,370 --> 03:06:29,770
One moment, please.

3088
03:06:30,090 --> 03:06:31,630
I have to give all my stuff back.

3089
03:06:32,350 --> 03:06:33,410
You are out here stealing men again?

3090
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:34,950
Yes, I am.

3091
03:06:35,050 --> 03:06:35,350
I am.

3092
03:06:36,490 --> 03:06:37,770
I love the beach.

3093
03:06:43,910 --> 03:06:45,170
Wait, did I attach the Fulton?

3094
03:06:45,290 --> 03:06:45,890
Oh, yes, I did.

3095
03:06:46,730 --> 03:06:47,090
My bad.

3096
03:06:49,870 --> 03:06:53,130
They are like, you are going to be snake whether you like it or not.

3097
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:57,850
Let's just take some curry.

3098
03:06:58,670 --> 03:06:59,870
Wait, did I look in here?

3099
03:07:00,450 --> 03:07:01,590
Oh, that's all of the stuff.

3100
03:07:03,190 --> 03:07:04,650
Oh, I forgot my weapons.

3101
03:07:08,890 --> 03:07:09,290
You...

3102
03:07:12,090 --> 03:07:12,490
You...

3103
03:07:14,990 --> 03:07:16,570
We can do the magazines.

3104
03:07:16,790 --> 03:07:19,030
We can distract them with a silly little magazine.

3105
03:07:19,190 --> 03:07:20,110
They will be like, yummy.

3106
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:26,390
You know?

3107
03:07:26,390 --> 03:07:30,390
But we don't want to Fulton the guy...

3108
03:07:31,970 --> 03:07:33,750
That we are trying to take.

3109
03:07:35,910 --> 03:07:37,670
Oh wait, this is all placeable weapons.

3110
03:07:37,750 --> 03:07:38,070
I am silly.

3111
03:07:38,410 --> 03:07:38,890
Smoke.

3112
03:07:39,610 --> 03:07:41,290
I am just grabbing whatever.

3113
03:07:41,550 --> 03:07:43,390
Oh wait, where is my regular...

3114
03:07:44,570 --> 03:07:46,510
Where is the empty mag?

3115
03:07:46,750 --> 03:07:47,170
There we go.

3116
03:07:48,770 --> 03:07:50,490
We will do a bunch of distraction things.

3117
03:07:51,610 --> 03:07:52,770
Everything is distraction.

3118
03:07:53,990 --> 03:07:54,510
Thank you.

3119
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:57,150
Oh, my bad.

3120
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:03,990
Cecile, what does it sound like again?

3121
03:08:13,090 --> 03:08:15,290
She is staring into my soul.

3122
03:08:15,710 --> 03:08:16,590
That's all I am.

3123
03:08:26,390 --> 03:08:26,530
Wow.

3124
03:08:29,990 --> 03:08:30,450
Oh.

3125
03:08:32,350 --> 03:08:32,810
Wow.

3126
03:08:37,910 --> 03:08:38,370
Oh.

3127
03:08:40,490 --> 03:08:40,950
Oh,

3128
03:08:44,470 --> 03:08:45,350
room for the ID card.

3129
03:08:56,390 --> 03:08:56,930
Guys.

3130
03:08:59,270 --> 03:09:01,150
I was driving the other day.

3131
03:09:02,690 --> 03:09:05,390
And on the side of the road I saw a peacock.

3132
03:09:08,530 --> 03:09:10,650
I don't know why.

3133
03:09:13,410 --> 03:09:14,430
Sounds like there is a peacock.

3134
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:23,390
I found the...

3135
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:25,730
Okay.

3136
03:09:33,560 --> 03:09:35,360
How does it taste?

3137
03:09:37,640 --> 03:09:40,060
That one sucks Cecile.

3138
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:05,720
Hold on.

3139
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:06,440
Give me a second.

3140
03:10:07,940 --> 03:10:09,160
Let's take out the curry.

3141
03:10:10,860 --> 03:10:12,100
Wait, how do I remove it?

3142
03:10:17,100 --> 03:10:18,260
How does it taste?

3143
03:10:18,480 --> 03:10:22,860
Okay, you guys remember what the pretzel sounded like?

3144
03:10:25,240 --> 03:10:27,160
I wanted to hear her monkey impression.

3145
03:10:27,260 --> 03:10:28,000
I am not going to lie.

3146
03:10:32,660 --> 03:10:33,940
Starting the mission.

3147
03:10:36,800 --> 03:10:38,240
Starting the mission.

3148
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:40,500
Kyoa!

3149
03:10:40,660 --> 03:10:41,240
Kyoa!

3150
03:10:44,620 --> 03:10:46,620
It is in another tape?

3151
03:10:46,720 --> 03:10:47,560
Oh my gosh.

3152
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:49,260
We gotta hear the monkey.

3153
03:10:51,640 --> 03:10:52,220
Hi snake.

3154
03:10:55,690 --> 03:10:57,060
Oh my god.

3155
03:10:59,830 --> 03:11:01,080
I love the beach.

3156
03:11:02,580 --> 03:11:03,900
Not that guy.

3157
03:11:10,320 --> 03:11:11,400
I'll get him.

3158
03:11:13,580 --> 03:11:14,780
That's not the right weapon.

3159
03:11:28,580 --> 03:11:30,120
We are fine.

3160
03:11:30,220 --> 03:11:30,920
Everything is good.

3161
03:11:31,780 --> 03:11:32,740
Can I take this guy home?

3162
03:11:35,960 --> 03:11:37,600
Hey, you are not going home!

3163
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:38,860
Hey, get up!

3164
03:11:39,580 --> 03:11:40,600
What are you doing?

3165
03:11:41,440 --> 03:11:42,100
Get up!

3166
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:44,360
You are not a cat either.

3167
03:11:49,460 --> 03:11:50,860
How do I get out of here?

3168
03:11:54,540 --> 03:11:55,000
This way?

3169
03:11:55,140 --> 03:11:56,460
Oh, there is a guy over there.

3170
03:11:56,800 --> 03:11:57,080
What?

3171
03:11:57,360 --> 03:11:58,100
What are you doing to me?

3172
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:06,760
Yeah!

3173
03:12:07,140 --> 03:12:08,400
Oh, you got the banana even.

3174
03:12:09,620 --> 03:12:10,440
I want your stuff.

3175
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:10,960
Give me your stuff.

3176
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:11,480
Give me your stuff.

3177
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:12,360
Give me your stuff.

3178
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:16,240
Give me your stuff.

3179
03:12:17,720 --> 03:12:19,400
Wait, no, no, no, no.

3180
03:12:20,760 --> 03:12:22,100
Oh my gosh, I'm patting his butt.

3181
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:22,840
Stop!

3182
03:12:23,140 --> 03:12:24,200
I can't get his stuff.

3183
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:35,580
Don't do it!

3184
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:39,300
Alright, let's take him home.

3185
03:12:40,140 --> 03:12:41,320
He is just a silly guy.

3186
03:12:43,080 --> 03:12:44,280
Am I going the right way?

3187
03:12:44,440 --> 03:12:44,700
Yeah.

3188
03:12:44,700 --> 03:12:47,080
Wait, what does it say?

3189
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:50,980
Get your hand off of me!

3190
03:12:57,230 --> 03:12:59,270
This game is so fun.

3191
03:12:59,810 --> 03:13:01,150
I love Peace Walker.

3192
03:13:04,130 --> 03:13:05,930
I love Peace Walker.

3193
03:13:10,400 --> 03:13:11,500
Where are we?

3194
03:13:22,660 --> 03:13:24,140
Oh, I'm coming too.

3195
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:27,720
You got him?

3196
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:36,190
Oh, you already got this guy.

3197
03:13:45,960 --> 03:13:47,900
Stop messing with him.

3198
03:13:49,100 --> 03:13:50,040
Come on.

3199
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:51,460
We don't need him.

3200
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:55,980
Where are the other guys?

3201
03:13:57,620 --> 03:13:58,700
Where are they at?

3202
03:13:58,780 --> 03:13:59,400
Oh, there he is.

3203
03:13:59,400 --> 03:14:01,980
Hey, you just ran right past him.

3204
03:14:02,300 --> 03:14:03,060
I got him.

3205
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:07,680
No,

3206
03:14:14,950 --> 03:14:15,710
he got me first.

3207
03:14:16,030 --> 03:14:17,530
No, he got me first.

3208
03:14:19,050 --> 03:14:21,390
No, he got me first.

3209
03:14:24,250 --> 03:14:25,790
What does that mean?

3210
03:14:27,610 --> 03:14:28,930
Oh, he got me again.

3211
03:14:29,790 --> 03:14:30,650
A little help.

3212
03:14:30,810 --> 03:14:31,870
A little help here.

3213
03:14:32,030 --> 03:14:33,070
A little help here.

3214
03:14:38,650 --> 03:14:39,250
Thanks,

3215
03:14:42,870 --> 03:14:43,550
I guess.

3216
03:14:46,170 --> 03:14:47,310
We are on the ground.

3217
03:14:47,890 --> 03:14:48,490
What

3218
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:53,740
the?

3219
03:14:53,980 --> 03:14:55,460
What the heck just happened?

3220
03:14:58,760 --> 03:14:59,360
Nice!

3221
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:02,340
We double teamed those guys.

3222
03:15:06,380 --> 03:15:08,170
I'm gonna take some of them home.

3223
03:15:10,520 --> 03:15:11,640
Yeah, we saved.

3224
03:15:12,280 --> 03:15:13,380
That guy teleported though.

3225
03:15:13,460 --> 03:15:14,380
You guys saw that, right?

3226
03:15:16,860 --> 03:15:18,340
We'll take the end home too.

3227
03:15:20,380 --> 03:15:21,960
Do you hear a kettle?

3228
03:15:29,920 --> 03:15:30,840
He cheated.

3229
03:15:31,140 --> 03:15:33,340
He's using hacks for real.

3230
03:15:34,860 --> 03:15:35,400
OK.

3231
03:15:36,700 --> 03:15:37,780
Isn't it in here?

3232
03:15:41,100 --> 03:15:42,200
Am I crazy?

3233
03:16:06,920 --> 03:16:08,380
Thank you!

3234
03:16:08,380 --> 03:16:08,520
Yeah!

3235
03:16:14,580 --> 03:16:16,140
Where the hell is this bird?

3236
03:16:18,460 --> 03:16:20,120
Do you hear him?

3237
03:16:20,320 --> 03:16:20,980
He's not here.

3238
03:16:21,980 --> 03:16:23,280
I think we gotta keep going south.

3239
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:25,260
What are you doing to this guy?

3240
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:26,120
Come on.

3241
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:31,420
I'm not gonna take everybody.

3242
03:16:33,140 --> 03:16:35,400
We are an exclusive club now.

3243
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:39,320
Click, click, click.

3244
03:16:40,280 --> 03:16:42,160
That's all I remember.

3245
03:16:46,280 --> 03:16:47,740
That's all I remember.

3246
03:16:48,780 --> 03:16:50,980
Is there even anybody here?

3247
03:16:55,820 --> 03:16:57,000
Oh there is.

3248
03:16:57,880 --> 03:16:58,360
Oh!

3249
03:17:02,080 --> 03:17:02,560
No.

3250
03:17:04,280 --> 03:17:04,760
Freeze.

3251
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:08,740
OK.

3252
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:14,660
I hear the kettle.

3253
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:15,280
Do you hear it?

3254
03:17:17,920 --> 03:17:18,640
There it is!

3255
03:17:21,540 --> 03:17:22,500
Excuse me.

3256
03:17:22,740 --> 03:17:23,240
Can you move?

3257
03:17:23,560 --> 03:17:24,440
Can you get off this guy?

3258
03:17:24,440 --> 03:17:26,660
Go away from him.

3259
03:17:26,860 --> 03:17:28,920
I don't want to see your crotch.

3260
03:17:31,300 --> 03:17:32,480
Oh my God.

3261
03:17:33,200 --> 03:17:34,020
OK guys.

3262
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:40,500
Can I take him home?

3263
03:17:44,020 --> 03:17:45,180
Yeah!

3264
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:52,720
Thanks underwear man.

3265
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:56,280
He's got his banana out.

3266
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:58,340
Don't say it like that.

3267
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:02,400
Alright, back to the lab.

3268
03:18:02,980 --> 03:18:04,680
Back to the lab everybody.

3269
03:18:07,800 --> 03:18:09,260
Oh the traps.

3270
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:10,200
Oh shoot.

3271
03:18:16,660 --> 03:18:17,280
Let's see.

3272
03:18:17,380 --> 03:18:17,700
Hold on.

3273
03:18:18,140 --> 03:18:19,660
Yeah, I want to test using them, right?

3274
03:18:22,980 --> 03:18:23,940
The, uh...

3275
03:18:25,560 --> 03:18:28,720
Automatically executes Fulton recovery on targets after they fall asleep.

3276
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:30,640
How do I use this?

3277
03:18:32,440 --> 03:18:33,660
Well this guy...

3278
03:18:35,900 --> 03:18:37,400
Is there a guy over here still?

3279
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:42,300
I guess I need to walk into it, huh?

3280
03:18:44,140 --> 03:18:45,160
Oh he's still asleep.

3281
03:18:50,620 --> 03:18:51,180
Alright,

3282
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:56,680
drag him over it.

3283
03:18:59,910 --> 03:19:00,870
Oh my God, moss man.

3284
03:19:09,710 --> 03:19:11,550
This was such a bust.

3285
03:19:11,610 --> 03:19:12,970
He's all the way over there!

3286
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:30,080
Just asleep.

3287
03:19:31,060 --> 03:19:31,720
Just asleep.

3288
03:19:32,780 --> 03:19:33,940
Just asleep.

3289
03:19:35,360 --> 03:19:36,380
Come on!

3290
03:19:36,700 --> 03:19:37,460
Come on!

3291
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:38,880
Come on!

3292
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:40,380
Come on!

3293
03:19:40,420 --> 03:19:41,440
Wake up snake!

3294
03:19:42,460 --> 03:19:44,600
Can you wake me up?

3295
03:19:44,960 --> 03:19:45,480
Thank you.

3296
03:19:47,860 --> 03:19:48,580
Where's

3297
03:20:12,120 --> 03:20:13,120
the reinforcements?

3298
03:20:16,980 --> 03:20:17,620
Nice.

3299
03:20:18,260 --> 03:20:19,840
I don't think the reinforcements ever came.

3300
03:20:23,480 --> 03:20:26,340
You had this the whole time!

3301
03:20:29,200 --> 03:20:30,980
Don't be so dramatic.

3302
03:20:32,540 --> 03:20:34,540
Don't be so dramatic!

3303
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:43,160
This guy is all slumped over.

3304
03:20:43,300 --> 03:20:44,480
Maybe if I...let's see.

3305
03:20:50,160 --> 03:20:55,420
If I put it like right...there.

3306
03:20:59,360 --> 03:21:00,580
Oh me too.

3307
03:21:01,440 --> 03:21:02,960
It's really potent.

3308
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:07,060
Wake me up!

3309
03:21:07,780 --> 03:21:08,640
Wake me up!

3310
03:21:22,400 --> 03:21:24,080
Thank you.

3311
03:21:24,300 --> 03:21:24,920
Alright, let's go.

3312
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:31,800
The reinforcements did come.

3313
03:21:33,560 --> 03:21:34,400
Stupid.

3314
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:44,180
They really did show up.

3315
03:21:44,480 --> 03:21:45,740
Micmac is just too good.

3316
03:21:45,820 --> 03:21:47,020
I didn't even notice they were there.

3317
03:21:50,020 --> 03:21:51,900
I can see you!

3318
03:22:04,100 --> 03:22:05,980
These guys are no good.

3319
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:08,000
I'm getting bad vibes.

3320
03:22:09,900 --> 03:22:11,080
No, nevermind.

3321
03:22:11,200 --> 03:22:11,940
I changed my mind.

3322
03:22:12,080 --> 03:22:13,080
One of them might be Leech.

3323
03:22:17,520 --> 03:22:19,600
That's where the bad vibes come from.

3324
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:24,100
You missed!

3325
03:22:36,340 --> 03:22:39,400
Computer, I need the second person!

3326
03:22:47,030 --> 03:22:47,630
Betrayal.

3327
03:22:47,930 --> 03:22:48,690
I know!

3328
03:22:48,910 --> 03:22:50,650
Micmac how could you betray me?

3329
03:22:51,850 --> 03:22:52,310
How dare!

3330
03:22:54,190 --> 03:22:54,590
How dare!

3331
03:22:54,690 --> 03:22:54,970
How dare!

3332
03:22:56,450 --> 03:22:56,810
Alright.

3333
03:23:07,340 --> 03:23:08,680
I like when it's co-op.

3334
03:23:08,860 --> 03:23:10,260
I can see your radar.

3335
03:23:10,480 --> 03:23:10,920
Wait, let me see.

3336
03:23:11,320 --> 03:23:11,980
Yeah, see?

3337
03:23:12,580 --> 03:23:13,060
When it's co-op.

3338
03:23:13,220 --> 03:23:16,200
Chat is kind of blocking it, but when it's co-op...

3339
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:23,000
No!

3340
03:23:23,420 --> 03:23:23,840
No!

3341
03:23:24,520 --> 03:23:25,240
No!

3342
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:26,400
You're lagging!

3343
03:23:26,500 --> 03:23:26,960
You're lagging!

3344
03:23:27,460 --> 03:23:28,060
You're cheating!

3345
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:28,480
You're cheating!

3346
03:23:30,460 --> 03:23:31,800
We're in sync!

3347
03:23:31,940 --> 03:23:33,480
We're so in sync!

3348
03:23:42,980 --> 03:23:44,800
Alright, story time.

3349
03:23:45,720 --> 03:23:47,880
I should have gotten some water first, but that's OK.

3350
03:23:52,620 --> 03:23:54,300
Oh, because of Snake Inn?

3351
03:23:54,860 --> 03:23:57,440
Because we were in the co-op?

3352
03:23:57,540 --> 03:23:58,580
That's so funny still.

3353
03:24:00,360 --> 03:24:02,600
Thank you so much for the 20 gifts!

3354
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:21,060
That was fun.

3355
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:22,320
That was so silly.

3356
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:34,070
Oh.

3357
03:24:36,880 --> 03:24:39,020
It can't be.

3358
03:24:39,640 --> 03:24:42,460
Oh my god!

3359
03:24:44,900 --> 03:24:45,260
What?

3360
03:24:55,320 --> 03:24:58,040
That guy always keeps you waiting.

3361
03:25:06,780 --> 03:25:08,640
Don't move!

3362
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:20,020
No!

3363
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:35,220
It's trauma.

3364
03:25:40,260 --> 03:25:45,620
He never did!

3365
03:26:07,320 --> 03:26:08,720
No!

3366
03:26:09,480 --> 03:26:09,800
No!

3367
03:26:10,940 --> 03:26:11,380
No!

3368
03:26:11,380 --> 03:26:11,480
No!

3369
03:26:12,200 --> 03:26:12,440
No!

3370
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:33,280
Is that what you call the truth?

3371
03:26:33,440 --> 03:26:34,840
Totally gaslit himself.

3372
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:38,680
You were there, Snake!

3373
03:26:41,380 --> 03:26:44,600
You were the woman you loved most in this world before you buried her.

3374
03:26:45,060 --> 03:26:46,500
It was my mission.

3375
03:26:48,100 --> 03:26:52,160
So that's the conclusion you came to in order to live with yourself.

3376
03:26:52,640 --> 03:26:53,920
What's the boss to you?

3377
03:26:54,640 --> 03:26:57,120
I'm the one she abandoned when she left this world.

3378
03:26:58,020 --> 03:27:01,680
I won't rest until I get answers from the woman I loved.

3379
03:27:02,460 --> 03:27:04,000
You and I are the same.

3380
03:27:05,260 --> 03:27:06,840
We are the walking dead.

3381
03:27:07,880 --> 03:27:09,980
Uh-oh, AMC's gonna be suing.

3382
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:13,660
The boss is gone.

3383
03:27:14,460 --> 03:27:15,360
Not so fast.

3384
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:19,120
You'd like to meet her, wouldn't you?

3385
03:27:19,640 --> 03:27:20,640
I can arrange it.

3386
03:27:21,960 --> 03:27:23,060
You took her life.

3387
03:27:23,340 --> 03:27:24,520
I gave it back.

3388
03:27:25,340 --> 03:27:26,020
You what?

3389
03:27:26,920 --> 03:27:28,220
Care for a sniff?

3390
03:27:29,540 --> 03:27:30,780
It's only snuff.

3391
03:27:31,160 --> 03:27:32,880
You're a cigar man, aren't you?

3392
03:27:32,880 --> 03:27:37,300
Well, there's no smoking in there, so if you want to meet her, you'd best partake now.

3393
03:27:41,080 --> 03:27:42,360
Follow me.

3394
03:27:45,520 --> 03:27:46,900
This is my baby.

3395
03:27:47,360 --> 03:27:48,520
My morpho butterfly.

3396
03:27:49,220 --> 03:27:52,340
It's neither pupa nor cocoon, but an amalga.

3397
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:56,000
A complete individual in the fullest sense of the word.

3398
03:27:56,360 --> 03:27:57,260
Is someone there?

3399
03:27:58,160 --> 03:27:59,920
We have a visitor.

3400
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:01,660
I'll introduce him.

3401
03:28:02,920 --> 03:28:04,820
Don't try anything foolish.

3402
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:07,240
As long as we're in here...

3403
03:28:07,240 --> 03:28:08,420
I'm gonna cry!

3404
03:28:09,300 --> 03:28:10,820
...I can introduce you with calm and the press of a button.

3405
03:28:11,320 --> 03:28:12,260
Who are you?

3406
03:28:19,750 --> 03:28:21,270
A warfighter.

3407
03:28:27,050 --> 03:28:27,810
Boss?

3408
03:28:27,810 --> 03:28:28,990
Is that you?

3409
03:28:29,690 --> 03:28:32,050
I call it the mammal part.

3410
03:28:32,290 --> 03:28:33,670
Mammal part?

3411
03:28:33,670 --> 03:28:40,070
For my participation on the project, I demanded access to all information on the boss.

3412
03:28:41,030 --> 03:28:43,410
Everything the CIA had.

3413
03:28:44,650 --> 03:28:49,310
Her personal history, military records, physiological data, correspondence.

3414
03:28:50,050 --> 03:28:52,850
The files for every operation she took part in.

3415
03:28:53,330 --> 03:28:56,250
Every decision she ever made at every possible turn.

3416
03:28:56,790 --> 03:28:58,990
What she took and what was taken from her.

3417
03:28:59,470 --> 03:29:01,190
Her pain and her pleasure.

3418
03:29:01,630 --> 03:29:02,870
Her joy and sorrow.

3419
03:29:02,870 --> 03:29:05,070
Her life and death.

3420
03:29:05,970 --> 03:29:07,170
And yes, even you.

3421
03:29:07,810 --> 03:29:09,270
Why would you do that?

3422
03:29:09,510 --> 03:29:21,150
Coldman sought an MAD-based AI that would deliver an effective retaliatory strike against the most appropriate target in response to a nuclear attack from a hypothetical adversary.

3423
03:29:21,910 --> 03:29:28,830
An unmanned device to act as a deterrent capable of making the decisions and taking the actions that human beings cannot.

3424
03:29:29,610 --> 03:29:40,570
I therefore concluded he required a cool calculating machine, programmed to inflict swift, sure, and utter annihilation upon the enemy.

3425
03:29:41,230 --> 03:29:42,250
No retaliation.

3426
03:29:43,070 --> 03:29:46,950
But he took it upon himself to come up with a different answer.

3427
03:29:47,670 --> 03:29:51,690
He said he needed the thought patterns of the very finest rational mind.

3428
03:29:52,370 --> 03:29:58,750
One that thought on a global scale, took both past and future into consideration, and reached the best...

3429
03:29:58,750 --> 03:29:59,490
What is that O?

3430
03:29:59,610 --> 03:30:00,070
It's different.

3431
03:30:01,490 --> 03:30:03,750
It's two different O's.

3432
03:30:04,710 --> 03:30:06,490
It was the logical thing to do.

3433
03:30:07,210 --> 03:30:12,390
I knew of only one person who could be entrusted with the fate of the entire human race.

3434
03:30:12,710 --> 03:30:14,130
No pressure for her.

3435
03:30:14,790 --> 03:30:17,090
To clear her name.

3436
03:30:18,450 --> 03:30:21,850
Why was a legendary hero forced to betray her country?

3437
03:30:22,650 --> 03:30:27,710
Why was she targeted for assassination by you, her most beloved disciple?

3438
03:30:27,710 --> 03:30:31,070
I have no use for fabrications.

3439
03:30:31,430 --> 03:30:32,850
I want the truth.

3440
03:30:33,150 --> 03:30:34,410
The boss's last will.

3441
03:30:35,850 --> 03:30:38,470
You must be dying to know yourself.

3442
03:30:39,750 --> 03:30:40,030
No.

3443
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:41,290
No.

3444
03:30:41,990 --> 03:30:43,270
She abandoned her country.

3445
03:30:43,930 --> 03:30:45,010
Abandoned us all.

3446
03:30:46,110 --> 03:30:46,530
Really?

3447
03:30:47,230 --> 03:30:49,790
You think you understand her feelings?

3448
03:30:51,170 --> 03:30:54,850
You're trying to recreate the boss's last will.

3449
03:30:55,470 --> 03:30:56,070
Is that it?

3450
03:30:56,070 --> 03:30:59,970
Why don't you ask her yourself, Jack?

3451
03:31:00,270 --> 03:31:00,910
Jack!

3452
03:31:01,450 --> 03:31:01,790
What?

3453
03:31:02,570 --> 03:31:03,190
Jack!

3454
03:31:03,490 --> 03:31:04,390
Boss!

3455
03:31:05,750 --> 03:31:06,710
Jack!

3456
03:31:07,530 --> 03:31:08,010
Boss!

3457
03:31:09,450 --> 03:31:10,410
Jack!

3458
03:31:11,470 --> 03:31:12,830
Go home.

3459
03:31:13,310 --> 03:31:14,870
I'm not your boss anymore.

3460
03:31:15,670 --> 03:31:16,210
Boss!

3461
03:31:16,690 --> 03:31:17,550
Go home!

3462
03:31:17,950 --> 03:31:19,450
No, I...

3463
03:31:19,450 --> 03:31:21,790
Complete your mission, Snake.

3464
03:31:22,630 --> 03:31:25,410
Extinguish that noble soul once again.

3465
03:31:26,070 --> 03:31:27,270
If you can.

3466
03:31:32,990 --> 03:31:36,950
Oh my gosh, we're trapped in the mammal pod.

3467
03:31:40,990 --> 03:31:42,670
My heart.

3468
03:31:44,350 --> 03:31:45,710
It's so weh.

3469
03:31:48,310 --> 03:31:51,450
Loyalty to the mission or loyalty to me?

3470
03:31:52,390 --> 03:31:53,350
Jack!

3471
03:31:56,070 --> 03:31:56,730
I'm

3472
03:32:05,580 --> 03:32:06,760
not your boss anymore.

3473
03:32:07,160 --> 03:32:08,080
Go home.

3474
03:32:09,960 --> 03:32:11,840
Why did you come back?

3475
03:32:14,820 --> 03:32:16,220
I'm not your boss anymore.

3476
03:32:16,640 --> 03:32:17,420
Go home.

3477
03:32:20,140 --> 03:32:23,200
You better stay around from now on.

3478
03:32:27,220 --> 03:32:28,380
Cal 9000.

3479
03:32:28,960 --> 03:32:30,160
I'm not your boss anymore.

3480
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:31,560
Go home.

3481
03:32:32,220 --> 03:32:36,540
I'm not your boss anymore.

3482
03:32:37,060 --> 03:32:37,760
Go home.

3483
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:38,360
Yoink!

3484
03:32:40,500 --> 03:32:41,460
Go home.

3485
03:32:41,840 --> 03:32:43,540
I'm not your boss anymore.

3486
03:32:43,900 --> 03:32:44,800
Go home.

3487
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:51,200
What is this?

3488
03:32:51,400 --> 03:32:52,400
This response?

3489
03:32:52,800 --> 03:32:53,480
Oh god.

3490
03:32:53,780 --> 03:32:54,500
Discontinue!

3491
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:09,880
Whoopsie.

3492
03:33:18,990 --> 03:33:20,710
I taught you all I could.

3493
03:33:22,290 --> 03:33:24,490
The rest you needed to learn on your own.

3494
03:33:26,870 --> 03:33:27,750
Techniques, sure.

3495
03:33:28,350 --> 03:33:30,190
But what about how to think like a soldier?

3496
03:33:30,190 --> 03:33:30,690
Oops.

3497
03:33:52,890 --> 03:33:54,710
There's a saying in the Orient.

3498
03:33:55,050 --> 03:33:56,310
Loyalty to the enemy.

3499
03:33:57,050 --> 03:33:58,050
Do you know what it means?

3500
03:33:59,750 --> 03:34:00,990
Being patriotic.

3501
03:34:01,850 --> 03:34:04,210
It means devoting yourself to your country.

3502
03:34:12,150 --> 03:34:12,950
Oops.

3503
03:34:23,370 --> 03:34:26,190
The BGM kills me.

3504
03:34:32,350 --> 03:34:33,150
Oops.

3505
03:34:33,550 --> 03:34:34,210
I didn't get the RT.

3506
03:34:52,250 --> 03:34:52,650
Oops.

3507
03:34:53,330 --> 03:34:53,510
What the?

3508
03:34:54,210 --> 03:34:54,590
What?

3509
03:34:54,710 --> 03:34:55,610
I get...

3510
03:34:55,610 --> 03:34:57,970
Why is it saying beep beep?

3511
03:34:58,250 --> 03:34:59,230
I did break trigger.

3512
03:35:00,390 --> 03:35:01,030
What are you talking about?

3513
03:35:08,610 --> 03:35:11,370
With absolute certainty is the mission.

3514
03:35:18,110 --> 03:35:20,950
I'm defecting to the Soviet Union.

3515
03:35:21,850 --> 03:35:24,930
Jack, you can't come with us.

3516
03:35:26,310 --> 03:35:27,930
You can't sit with us.

3517
03:35:33,430 --> 03:35:34,430
Boss!

3518
03:35:38,510 --> 03:35:39,330
Boss!

3519
03:35:43,290 --> 03:35:45,210
Go home, Jack.

3520
03:35:51,130 --> 03:35:53,510
He's like, what happened in there?

3521
03:35:58,490 --> 03:35:59,870
The flowers.

3522
03:36:03,450 --> 03:36:04,370
Oh

3523
03:36:08,810 --> 03:36:10,290
my god!

3524
03:36:11,910 --> 03:36:14,230
What are you doing back there?

3525
03:36:19,050 --> 03:36:19,270
What?

3526
03:36:28,180 --> 03:36:30,130
That looks familiar.

3527
03:36:33,690 --> 03:36:34,590
Mercenaries!

3528
03:36:39,130 --> 03:36:44,410
To be continued in the next...

3529
03:36:44,410 --> 03:36:45,710
Hatsune Miku time baby!

3530
03:36:46,690 --> 03:36:47,410
Let's go.

3531
03:36:48,590 --> 03:36:50,990
I wonder how long I'll go today.

3532
03:36:53,690 --> 03:36:58,090
We'll definitely beat Chrysalis.

3533
03:37:01,010 --> 03:37:02,310
Going all in.

3534
03:37:02,410 --> 03:37:02,950
Thanks boss.

3535
03:37:03,050 --> 03:37:03,650
Thanks Eggman!

3536
03:37:03,950 --> 03:37:04,810
That was so fun!

3537
03:37:05,870 --> 03:37:07,430
Speedo guy whiplash.

3538
03:37:08,070 --> 03:37:09,090
So funny.

3539
03:37:16,010 --> 03:37:16,770
Yay!

3540
03:37:16,970 --> 03:37:17,530
Sub-arrival.

3541
03:37:18,610 --> 03:37:19,370
Skip.

3542
03:37:20,130 --> 03:37:20,890
Shrimp!

3543
03:37:21,030 --> 03:37:22,210
What are you doing in there?

3544
03:37:22,210 --> 03:37:23,730
Salmon.

3545
03:37:25,470 --> 03:37:27,530
I'm Solid Snipe.

3546
03:37:29,150 --> 03:37:29,870
Sony.

3547
03:37:30,830 --> 03:37:31,730
Capybara.

3548
03:37:32,010 --> 03:37:34,390
There's no reason a capybara should be in the brig.

3549
03:37:36,390 --> 03:37:38,090
You chose the wrong name for yourself.

3550
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:41,430
We got Dorado!

3551
03:37:43,310 --> 03:37:44,210
Cicada.

3552
03:37:45,530 --> 03:37:46,030
Robin.

3553
03:37:47,230 --> 03:37:47,890
Crane.

3554
03:37:49,030 --> 03:37:50,890
We got the goat!

3555
03:37:50,890 --> 03:37:51,150
Goat!

3556
03:37:52,030 --> 03:37:53,630
We got goat!

3557
03:37:55,850 --> 03:37:56,490
Kestrel.

3558
03:37:57,770 --> 03:37:58,410
Goanna.

3559
03:37:59,690 --> 03:38:00,330
Caribou.

3560
03:38:01,270 --> 03:38:01,890
Reindeer.

3561
03:38:03,350 --> 03:38:04,110
Oh my god!

3562
03:38:04,270 --> 03:38:04,990
Sea otter!

3563
03:38:07,090 --> 03:38:08,950
We got the goat!

3564
03:38:10,850 --> 03:38:11,670
That's it.

3565
03:38:12,330 --> 03:38:13,950
Gosh, are we never going to see Leech again?

3566
03:38:17,330 --> 03:38:18,550
I guess we'll see.

3567
03:38:20,890 --> 03:38:22,530
Look at our base.

3568
03:38:23,310 --> 03:38:25,210
You guys, it's really starting to shape up.

3569
03:38:26,430 --> 03:38:27,370
Let me out!

3570
03:38:29,890 --> 03:38:32,410
You gotta be a good boy, everybody.

3571
03:38:32,790 --> 03:38:33,310
Oh wait, sorry.

3572
03:38:34,390 --> 03:38:35,190
This one.

3573
03:38:36,210 --> 03:38:38,510
You gotta be only good boys and girls.

3574
03:38:40,610 --> 03:38:42,450
We could get D+.

3575
03:38:44,010 --> 03:38:45,830
Should we send our same guys?

3576
03:38:47,490 --> 03:38:49,290
It should be, maybe...

3577
03:38:49,970 --> 03:38:53,230
No, I'm sending out a mech.

3578
03:38:55,450 --> 03:38:57,250
We're sending this bad boy out.

3579
03:38:58,890 --> 03:39:02,550
What if I also send out our helicopter?

3580
03:39:04,030 --> 03:39:05,090
Oh, we have a tank too!

3581
03:39:05,230 --> 03:39:05,870
I didn't even notice.

3582
03:39:09,490 --> 03:39:11,150
We're sending out all the big boys.

3583
03:39:14,070 --> 03:39:15,570
Oh, I'm so silly.

3584
03:39:18,170 --> 03:39:19,590
Sending out all of them.

3585
03:39:20,250 --> 03:39:21,190
Let's take them all.

3586
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:23,130
Launch and attack!

3587
03:39:24,550 --> 03:39:25,710
Send Orca.

3588
03:39:30,490 --> 03:39:31,250
Let's see.

3589
03:39:32,250 --> 03:39:33,850
Anything else we can recruit?

3590
03:39:35,090 --> 03:39:35,770
Anymore guys?

3591
03:39:35,890 --> 03:39:36,790
Hi Cecile.

3592
03:39:37,530 --> 03:39:39,410
You people are such culinary savages.

3593
03:39:40,770 --> 03:39:42,130
Why does she think that about us?

3594
03:39:42,130 --> 03:39:43,690
What's that about us?

3595
03:39:45,350 --> 03:39:46,310
Entrance exam.

3596
03:39:49,110 --> 03:39:49,950
Yeah, yeah.

3597
03:39:50,550 --> 03:39:51,330
Let's go.

3598
03:39:53,970 --> 03:39:55,070
Let's go, let's go.

3599
03:39:55,090 --> 03:39:55,910
Yeah, we have curry.

3600
03:39:56,530 --> 03:39:57,650
We have deliciousness.

3601
03:39:57,790 --> 03:40:01,130
We have Doritos and curry and Mountain Dew on Mother Base.

3602
03:40:03,410 --> 03:40:04,570
That's a lot of guys.

3603
03:40:07,250 --> 03:40:07,810
Hello?

3604
03:40:07,810 --> 03:40:07,910
Hello?

3605
03:40:10,190 --> 03:40:11,810
There we go.

3606
03:40:25,600 --> 03:40:29,240
Yeah, you just got up and I'm taking you back down again.

3607
03:40:33,340 --> 03:40:34,480
Oh no!

3608
03:40:36,660 --> 03:40:37,580
Oh no!

3609
03:40:40,600 --> 03:40:41,860
Please!

3610
03:40:43,070 --> 03:40:45,200
So close.

3611
03:40:48,220 --> 03:40:49,480
Consecutive.

3612
03:40:50,880 --> 03:40:52,140
Consecutive.

3613
03:40:52,880 --> 03:40:53,580
Consecutive.

3614
03:40:54,040 --> 03:40:56,460
I also call out every move that I do.

3615
03:41:01,630 --> 03:41:02,430
Nice.

3616
03:41:04,170 --> 03:41:06,350
Nice, nice, nice.

3617
03:41:07,270 --> 03:41:08,370
You're pretty good.

3618
03:41:09,850 --> 03:41:11,010
Strange love!

3619
03:41:14,090 --> 03:41:16,850
Her quote is so messed up.

3620
03:41:21,960 --> 03:41:23,080
Strange love!

3621
03:41:23,340 --> 03:41:24,040
We have a winner.

3622
03:41:24,820 --> 03:41:26,220
Well, not really, but...

3623
03:41:27,540 --> 03:41:29,040
Let's go see who we got.

3624
03:41:32,440 --> 03:41:33,000
Bobolink?

3625
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:36,000
What's with these angry guys?

3626
03:41:36,840 --> 03:41:37,400
Arowana.

3627
03:41:38,660 --> 03:41:39,220
Swallow.

3628
03:41:41,780 --> 03:41:42,340
Falcon.

3629
03:41:42,520 --> 03:41:43,200
He's not very good.

3630
03:41:43,200 --> 03:41:43,960
The other guys are good.

3631
03:41:49,810 --> 03:41:53,310
Do you see what I see?

3632
03:41:53,470 --> 03:41:54,650
Oh my god!

3633
03:41:55,150 --> 03:41:56,850
We have a...

3634
03:41:59,410 --> 03:42:00,770
Sound the alarms!

3635
03:42:01,270 --> 03:42:02,110
We have a female!

3636
03:42:04,810 --> 03:42:06,290
We have a lady.

3637
03:42:06,910 --> 03:42:09,430
Give me any order you want and I'll make it happen.

3638
03:42:12,650 --> 03:42:13,690
Alright, J.

3639
03:42:14,190 --> 03:42:17,250
I command you to stay with me for the rest of my afterlife.

3640
03:42:20,270 --> 03:42:20,830
Crane!

3641
03:42:23,390 --> 03:42:25,510
We got some pretty decent guys this time.

3642
03:42:26,630 --> 03:42:27,190
Nice.

3643
03:42:29,130 --> 03:42:30,950
They really gave her that quote.

3644
03:42:32,410 --> 03:42:33,350
Yeah, they did.

3645
03:42:34,170 --> 03:42:36,670
Alright, Chaff is still in the works.

3646
03:42:39,430 --> 03:42:41,170
We're about to face...

3647
03:42:41,170 --> 03:42:43,250
We're about to face...

3648
03:42:43,250 --> 03:42:46,870
Oh my gosh!

3649
03:42:46,930 --> 03:42:47,090
J!

3650
03:42:54,770 --> 03:42:59,070
We're about to face Chrysalis.

3651
03:42:59,730 --> 03:43:07,070
I think we're okay with what we got.

3652
03:43:11,170 --> 03:43:11,950
Chrysler.

3653
03:43:16,430 --> 03:43:22,610
Alright, I need four strong guys to come help me out.

3654
03:43:23,430 --> 03:43:25,430
If you play as J...

3655
03:43:30,450 --> 03:43:32,790
I know what to do.

3656
03:43:34,690 --> 03:43:36,210
Come on in.

3657
03:43:40,820 --> 03:43:41,460
Nice!

3658
03:43:42,360 --> 03:43:43,000
Nice!

3659
03:43:43,900 --> 03:43:44,960
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

3660
03:43:47,480 --> 03:43:48,400
Let's see.

3661
03:43:49,440 --> 03:43:50,560
Mission prep everybody.

3662
03:43:50,800 --> 03:43:52,480
Get your stuff ready.

3663
03:43:59,550 --> 03:44:00,550
Hold on, wait.

3664
03:44:02,850 --> 03:44:04,010
Yeah, it should be fine.

3665
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:07,270
Solid magazine, no.

3666
03:44:08,730 --> 03:44:09,950
We'll go with the grenade.

3667
03:44:10,610 --> 03:44:12,090
We don't need this either.

3668
03:44:12,250 --> 03:44:14,950
We'll go with... I already have this.

3669
03:44:15,550 --> 03:44:16,610
I guess we don't.

3670
03:44:16,690 --> 03:44:17,650
I don't really need anything.

3671
03:44:19,510 --> 03:44:20,250
We need that.

3672
03:44:21,210 --> 03:44:22,010
I'll bring that.

3673
03:44:23,010 --> 03:44:23,970
Don't need that.

3674
03:44:25,230 --> 03:44:29,290
I'm gonna bring another curry though, just in case.

3675
03:44:30,650 --> 03:44:32,250
That's the surround indicator.

3676
03:44:32,790 --> 03:44:34,070
I didn't even use my Walkman.

3677
03:44:35,750 --> 03:44:36,810
Oh Chaff, thank you!

3678
03:44:36,850 --> 03:44:37,530
Thank you for the reminder.

3679
03:44:39,330 --> 03:44:40,010
Oh wait.

3680
03:44:40,670 --> 03:44:41,470
There it is, yeah.

3681
03:44:56,400 --> 03:44:57,500
Gone with the team.

3682
03:44:57,640 --> 03:44:59,040
Gone with the team.

3683
03:45:02,920 --> 03:45:04,380
Oh, sorry.

3684
03:45:04,520 --> 03:45:06,540
I have to redo all my stuff.

3685
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:08,120
Sorry, sorry.

3686
03:45:08,540 --> 03:45:09,060
So sorry.

3687
03:45:09,240 --> 03:45:10,180
I have to redo all my stuff.

3688
03:45:23,710 --> 03:45:24,870
Huey's ID card.

3689
03:45:32,370 --> 03:45:35,200
Blah, blah, blah.

3690
03:45:39,280 --> 03:45:40,840
I want to take a picture of all of us.

3691
03:45:45,720 --> 03:45:47,540
I've been meaning to do that and I keep forgetting.

3692
03:45:49,180 --> 03:45:50,660
I don't really need the analyzer, do I?

3693
03:45:52,360 --> 03:45:53,140
What's this do again?

3694
03:45:53,320 --> 03:45:54,520
Oh, yeah.

3695
03:45:58,060 --> 03:45:58,560
Thank you!

3696
03:45:59,920 --> 03:46:01,500
Are we ready, team?

3697
03:46:01,500 --> 03:46:02,020
Team!

3698
03:46:09,320 --> 03:46:10,140
We'll be fine.

3699
03:46:10,200 --> 03:46:11,320
We don't need another curry.

3700
03:46:11,940 --> 03:46:14,180
Alright guys, before you do anything, let me take a picture.

3701
03:46:17,180 --> 03:46:18,820
I want to take a picture of us.

3702
03:46:20,100 --> 03:46:20,780
Our little team.

3703
03:46:28,540 --> 03:46:30,300
You missed the panties.

3704
03:46:31,140 --> 03:46:33,340
I don't have that yet, but I'll get that.

3705
03:46:33,380 --> 03:46:34,200
I'll get that outfit.

3706
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:36,180
Bye bye!

3707
03:46:38,860 --> 03:46:40,180
This time...

3708
03:46:40,180 --> 03:46:45,080
This time I stream this game we are getting our date with Kazuhira Miller.

3709
03:46:46,220 --> 03:46:48,160
I swear on it.

3710
03:46:49,620 --> 03:46:51,300
I swear on it.

3711
03:46:51,360 --> 03:46:52,880
We are getting that date.

3712
03:47:08,780 --> 03:47:10,180
Roger that, boss.

3713
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:14,140
Cross your heart and hope to re-die?

3714
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:14,480
Yep.

3715
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:17,740
Cross my heart and hope to live.

3716
03:47:20,820 --> 03:47:21,780
Alright guys.

3717
03:47:25,560 --> 03:47:26,040
Cheese!

3718
03:47:26,780 --> 03:47:27,620
Where are you going?

3719
03:47:28,080 --> 03:47:28,460
Come here.

3720
03:47:28,720 --> 03:47:29,160
Come here.

3721
03:47:29,240 --> 03:47:30,280
I can't get all of you guys.

3722
03:47:31,920 --> 03:47:33,080
Don't worry about it.

3723
03:47:37,980 --> 03:47:38,460
Cheese!

3724
03:47:48,020 --> 03:47:48,900
Mash it!

3725
03:48:04,440 --> 03:48:05,080
I

3726
03:48:09,330 --> 03:48:10,710
wish I could...There we go.

3727
03:48:11,090 --> 03:48:12,130
No, the battle pod!

3728
03:48:30,450 --> 03:48:31,430
Take that!

3729
03:48:31,650 --> 03:48:31,970
Nothing.

3730
03:48:31,970 --> 03:48:37,360
Come back please.

3731
03:48:49,100 --> 03:48:50,220
I have no more!

3732
03:48:54,400 --> 03:48:56,280
Are you not an attack pod?

3733
03:49:14,310 --> 03:49:15,390
Is it too far?

3734
03:49:15,830 --> 03:49:16,770
It's too far!

3735
03:49:18,350 --> 03:49:19,930
I should have not brought the gun.

3736
03:49:20,030 --> 03:49:21,030
I should have brought...

3737
03:49:21,030 --> 03:49:22,330
Sorry, I'm taking your stuff.

3738
03:49:23,210 --> 03:49:24,190
I don't know if that's for me.

3739
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,590
Launching kidnappers.

3740
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:41,440
Abuse!

3741
03:49:42,920 --> 03:49:44,180
Don't be kidnappers!

3742
03:49:44,840 --> 03:49:45,480
I'm an adult!

3743
03:49:49,640 --> 03:49:50,280
There we go.

3744
03:49:50,460 --> 03:49:50,900
Nice.

3745
03:49:51,600 --> 03:49:55,050
Good job team!

3746
03:49:55,150 --> 03:49:55,510
Where is she?

3747
03:49:55,670 --> 03:49:56,070
There she is.

3748
03:49:56,950 --> 03:49:57,390
Hello.

3749
03:50:02,380 --> 03:50:02,820
Oh my god.

3750
03:50:03,100 --> 03:50:03,480
Team?

3751
03:50:03,640 --> 03:50:04,460
Are we okay team?

3752
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:06,700
No more kidnappers!

3753
03:50:13,620 --> 03:50:15,840
Oh, I thought I got the pod before,

3754
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:19,340
but...

3755
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:20,100
The pod!

3756
03:50:23,710 --> 03:50:24,770
No, no, no, no, no!

3757
03:50:24,770 --> 03:50:25,750
No chain gun!

3758
03:50:35,220 --> 03:50:35,740
Morpheus!

3759
03:50:36,160 --> 03:50:37,340
Oh, you're fine.

3760
03:50:37,600 --> 03:50:38,840
You're just getting health, right?

3761
03:50:39,760 --> 03:50:40,860
I'll also join you.

3762
03:50:43,100 --> 03:50:44,320
You scared me!

3763
03:50:44,500 --> 03:50:45,280
I thought you were down!

3764
03:50:48,400 --> 03:50:49,600
Wait, we lost someone.

3765
03:50:53,520 --> 03:50:54,900
Wait, did someone disconnect?

3766
03:50:55,880 --> 03:50:57,100
Wait, Morpheus, why don't...

3767
03:50:58,920 --> 03:51:00,440
What just happened?

3768
03:51:04,500 --> 03:51:05,400
Not yet!

3769
03:51:05,800 --> 03:51:06,920
It's not over yet!

3770
03:51:24,750 --> 03:51:26,350
I was an idiot.

3771
03:51:27,650 --> 03:51:28,870
I was an idiot.

3772
03:51:29,050 --> 03:51:29,890
Why did I...

3773
03:51:35,220 --> 03:51:37,080
Why did I not bring both...

3774
03:51:38,540 --> 03:51:39,460
Both things.

3775
03:51:39,580 --> 03:51:40,640
Why did I bring one gun?

3776
03:51:54,430 --> 03:51:55,510
Oh my god.

3777
03:52:06,940 --> 03:52:08,640
The chaff grenades, thank you!

3778
03:52:09,680 --> 03:52:11,560
The chaff grenades are so good!

3779
03:52:18,580 --> 03:52:19,180
Nice!

3780
03:52:21,460 --> 03:52:23,180
It's alright, the chaffs!

3781
03:52:24,320 --> 03:52:25,160
What do you mean?

3782
03:52:30,000 --> 03:52:30,240
No!

3783
03:52:39,960 --> 03:52:42,780
I tried to do it before she could do it.

3784
03:52:43,440 --> 03:52:43,940
I tried.

3785
03:52:44,760 --> 03:52:45,960
Wait, I have no more again.

3786
03:52:55,920 --> 03:52:56,800
Yes, please!

3787
03:52:57,820 --> 03:52:58,860
Yes, please!

3788
03:53:04,300 --> 03:53:05,560
Oh, more rations!

3789
03:53:05,680 --> 03:53:05,940
Awesome!

3790
03:53:14,410 --> 03:53:25,310
Oops, I guess I died.

3791
03:53:38,010 --> 03:53:39,890
She's gonna land on the supplies!

3792
03:53:45,590 --> 03:53:46,190
Ouch!

3793
03:53:51,490 --> 03:53:53,270
Wait, stop, thank you!

3794
03:53:53,350 --> 03:53:54,910
Oops, I guess I died.

3795
03:54:08,370 --> 03:54:10,590
Oops, I guess I died.

3796
03:54:20,540 --> 03:54:21,620
Hello team!

3797
03:54:22,180 --> 03:54:23,040
Thank you very much!

3798
03:54:24,220 --> 03:54:26,160
One guy is glitching out a little bit.

3799
03:54:27,700 --> 03:54:29,500
I win it!

3800
03:54:29,960 --> 03:54:31,960
I win it!

3801
03:54:33,120 --> 03:54:34,260
Too close for a bazooka?

3802
03:54:34,340 --> 03:54:34,920
Never!

3803
03:54:35,420 --> 03:54:36,460
What are you talking about?

3804
03:54:44,200 --> 03:54:45,600
Holy cow!

3805
03:54:54,540 --> 03:54:56,000
Holy moly!

3806
03:55:02,730 --> 03:55:03,330
Come on Snake!

3807
03:55:04,050 --> 03:55:07,690
Snake, I need you to really stuff those in there!

3808
03:55:08,570 --> 03:55:11,750
Yes, I need you to stuff them in your pants!

3809
03:55:15,290 --> 03:55:16,730
I need you to...

3810
03:55:17,510 --> 03:55:18,930
Oh my god!

3811
03:55:20,070 --> 03:55:20,330
OK!

3812
03:55:26,410 --> 03:55:27,450
Stuff it in there!

3813
03:55:28,150 --> 03:55:29,910
Make sure it's...what the?

3814
03:55:30,390 --> 03:55:30,910
What just happened?

3815
03:55:30,910 --> 03:55:31,910
Are we good?

3816
03:55:32,410 --> 03:55:33,670
Are we OK?

3817
03:55:39,590 --> 03:55:40,850
This one.

3818
03:55:41,290 --> 03:55:42,190
What just happened?

3819
03:55:44,550 --> 03:55:45,250
This one?

3820
03:55:52,460 --> 03:55:54,000
Come on Snake!

3821
03:55:54,380 --> 03:55:55,060
Grab it!

3822
03:55:59,400 --> 03:56:00,440
I couldn't get it.

3823
03:56:02,200 --> 03:56:03,760
I couldn't get it.

3824
03:56:04,420 --> 03:56:04,900
No!

3825
03:56:05,680 --> 03:56:06,360
It's OK though.

3826
03:56:09,480 --> 03:56:12,980
I got like almost half of them, so that's not so bad.

3827
03:56:13,660 --> 03:56:14,840
Good haul though, yeah!

3828
03:56:18,470 --> 03:56:19,740
Cold man jumpscare!

3829
03:56:27,580 --> 03:56:28,720
This thing!

3830
03:56:31,200 --> 03:56:33,160
This stinking AI bot!

3831
03:56:35,370 --> 03:56:36,080
Oh my goodness!

3832
03:56:38,640 --> 03:56:40,600
Oops, I guess I died.

3833
03:56:40,820 --> 03:56:41,420
Hi team!

3834
03:56:42,400 --> 03:56:44,420
By the way, all three of you!

3835
03:56:48,760 --> 03:56:50,240
So funny!

3836
03:56:55,970 --> 03:56:58,420
I've been the main character every time!

3837
03:57:03,550 --> 03:57:05,090
Good job everyone!

3838
03:57:06,550 --> 03:57:09,970
Carl Gustav M2 Design Specs, rank 2.

3839
03:57:11,930 --> 03:57:13,290
Support strike?

3840
03:57:16,490 --> 03:57:17,490
Not quite!

3841
03:57:47,850 --> 03:57:49,210
We got this!

3842
03:57:49,490 --> 03:57:49,790
Yeah!

3843
03:58:11,390 --> 03:58:13,530
Thanks for the reminder!

3844
03:58:24,970 --> 03:58:27,950
Strange love is piano and Huey is a fiddle!

3845
03:58:36,230 --> 03:58:36,950
Kaz!

3846
03:58:46,690 --> 03:58:48,490
That machine's not the problem.

3847
03:58:48,990 --> 03:58:51,750
It's that the boss still lives inside of you.

3848
03:58:52,090 --> 03:58:52,530
Bullshit!

3849
03:58:53,390 --> 03:58:54,590
She's dead, Snake.

3850
03:58:55,050 --> 03:58:56,990
It's time to come to terms with that.

3851
03:58:58,430 --> 03:58:59,970
Let me put it another way.

3852
03:59:00,670 --> 03:59:02,190
You've left everything behind.

3853
03:59:02,710 --> 03:59:05,750
Your country, your identity, your past and ideals.

3854
03:59:06,390 --> 03:59:08,990
But there's still one thing you haven't let go of.

3855
03:59:09,270 --> 03:59:10,510
What are you talking about?

3856
03:59:11,170 --> 03:59:11,770
The boss.

3857
03:59:12,290 --> 03:59:13,630
You still haven't let her go.

3858
03:59:13,630 --> 03:59:15,630
The boss...

3859
03:59:28,130 --> 03:59:30,930
I mean...

3860
03:59:30,930 --> 03:59:36,790
Until they pass on...

3861
03:59:38,410 --> 03:59:41,090
I mean...

3862
03:59:43,630 --> 03:59:45,690
They made up.

3863
03:59:56,310 --> 03:59:58,330
Depends on the ghost.

3864
03:59:59,530 --> 04:00:01,770
Wisp's sweating profusely.

3865
04:00:01,770 --> 04:00:03,830
The truth won't change the past.

3866
04:00:04,050 --> 04:00:04,990
You still wanna know?

3867
04:00:07,170 --> 04:00:07,690
No.

3868
04:00:07,690 --> 04:00:10,710
I took on this mission for a kid who believes in peace.

3869
04:00:12,150 --> 04:00:16,030
The most frustrating about this game is Snake's...

3870
04:00:16,030 --> 04:00:18,430
Peace Walker is on the verge of completion.

3871
04:00:18,990 --> 04:00:19,830
Come on boss.

3872
04:00:20,290 --> 04:00:21,290
Let's get to that base.

3873
04:00:22,410 --> 04:00:24,450
The most frustrating thing about this game...

3874
04:00:26,330 --> 04:00:26,730
Oh...

3875
04:00:30,150 --> 04:00:32,470
We got some leggies.

3876
04:00:32,530 --> 04:00:34,290
We got some power.

3877
04:00:34,710 --> 04:00:36,550
We got a lot of head.

3878
04:00:37,770 --> 04:00:40,910
And we got some more leggies.

3879
04:00:47,690 --> 04:00:49,690
Okay, back to Mother Base.

3880
04:00:50,490 --> 04:00:51,150
Hi Chico.

3881
04:00:53,290 --> 04:00:54,930
Chico, Chico, Chico.

3882
04:00:56,990 --> 04:00:58,970
Chico, Chico, Chico.

3883
04:00:59,310 --> 04:01:01,070
Carl, Gustav and two.

3884
04:01:03,930 --> 04:01:05,770
Oh yeah, our Autoroms guy.

3885
04:01:06,310 --> 04:01:07,110
Delivery!

3886
04:01:09,570 --> 04:01:10,930
Thank you!

3887
04:01:14,470 --> 04:01:16,210
Thank you guys!

3888
04:01:17,210 --> 04:01:18,390
The

3889
04:01:23,210 --> 04:01:25,010
flower, the flower.

3890
04:01:26,670 --> 04:01:31,650
Thank you for the...

3891
04:01:32,390 --> 04:01:33,230
Cologne.

3892
04:01:35,550 --> 04:01:36,270
Downgrade?

3893
04:01:36,370 --> 04:01:37,950
You gave me a downgrade of the curry.

3894
04:01:39,910 --> 04:01:41,990
Stop giving me downgrades.

3895
04:01:45,810 --> 04:01:46,910
Downgrade.

3896
04:01:50,290 --> 04:01:52,310
Remember me.

3897
04:01:58,040 --> 04:01:59,800
The rescue box.

3898
04:01:59,880 --> 04:02:01,440
Oh thank you!

3899
04:02:01,560 --> 04:02:02,080
Oh my gosh.

3900
04:02:02,400 --> 04:02:06,800
Stun box, bomb box, cardboard box.

3901
04:02:07,140 --> 04:02:09,920
Cardboard box, great curry.

3902
04:02:10,720 --> 04:02:11,520
More cologne.

3903
04:02:11,940 --> 04:02:13,280
What are you guys trying to say, huh?

3904
04:02:14,220 --> 04:02:18,940
Shield, blood box, cardboard box, more stuff.

3905
04:02:25,420 --> 04:02:27,160
Thank you for all the stuff everybody!

3906
04:02:28,840 --> 04:02:29,880
Thank you!

3907
04:02:33,720 --> 04:02:39,940
Special day, special day, special day, special day, special day, special day, special day, special day, special day, special day.

3908
04:02:40,040 --> 04:02:40,200
Yeah!

3909
04:02:43,200 --> 04:02:44,360
OK, let's skip the rest.

3910
04:02:44,580 --> 04:02:45,540
Thank you!

3911
04:02:47,720 --> 04:02:48,920
Did we have more guys?

3912
04:02:48,980 --> 04:02:49,520
We did.

3913
04:02:50,180 --> 04:02:55,420
We got Suni, Bullshark, Sunfish, Snipe, Capybara, Salmon, Shrimp.

3914
04:02:55,420 --> 04:02:56,000
Suni.

3915
04:02:56,120 --> 04:02:57,100
Oh, that's all of them.

3916
04:02:58,900 --> 04:03:02,200
I'm sorry, the POW was in the brig?

3917
04:03:03,640 --> 04:03:05,120
I saved your ass!

3918
04:03:05,820 --> 04:03:07,500
And you're gonna treat me like that?

3919
04:03:10,680 --> 04:03:12,420
Nice, our R&D really went up.

3920
04:03:12,840 --> 04:03:16,020
We have a ton of stuff that we can... Holy cow!

3921
04:03:17,740 --> 04:03:18,280
Stun grenade.

3922
04:03:20,520 --> 04:03:21,880
For sure, stun grenade.

3923
04:03:23,980 --> 04:03:25,540
He was in the infirmary?

3924
04:03:25,720 --> 04:03:25,860
Oh.

3925
04:03:27,940 --> 04:03:29,240
Oh yeah, also.

3926
04:03:36,560 --> 04:03:37,720
Fast forward.

3927
04:03:51,380 --> 04:03:53,280
Where's the fast forward part?

3928
04:03:54,040 --> 04:03:55,640
Oh, there it is.

3929
04:03:57,200 --> 04:03:59,120
Where's the fast forward part?

3930
04:03:59,120 --> 04:03:59,200
OK.

3931
04:04:03,380 --> 04:04:05,440
It was fun taking down that boss at the infirmary.

3932
04:04:05,580 --> 04:04:06,980
I can't believe we took down the Chrysler.

3933
04:04:07,100 --> 04:04:07,340
Yeah!

3934
04:04:12,120 --> 04:04:13,480
No, he's still alive.

3935
04:04:15,820 --> 04:04:16,680
No!

3936
04:04:52,900 --> 04:04:58,620
Why did I choose the fast one?

3937
04:04:58,780 --> 04:04:59,740
It's so slow.

3938
04:05:03,440 --> 04:05:05,680
I have to keep clicking A.

3939
04:05:05,900 --> 04:05:06,780
This is the worst.

3940
04:05:10,360 --> 04:05:13,240
No way, is he the only one that doesn't make it out?

3941
04:05:18,170 --> 04:05:20,850
Is he the only one that doesn't make it out?

3942
04:05:22,190 --> 04:05:22,750
Lizard!

3943
04:05:24,710 --> 04:05:25,270
Lizard!

3944
04:06:02,020 --> 04:06:03,160
He's a sickbay!

3945
04:06:06,800 --> 04:06:07,360
Lizard!

3946
04:06:16,440 --> 04:06:17,840
Lizard!

3947
04:06:19,800 --> 04:06:21,840
I'm so worried.

3948
04:06:29,820 --> 04:06:33,220
Oh my gosh.

3949
04:06:34,640 --> 04:06:36,240
I'm so glad.

3950
04:06:43,380 --> 04:06:45,360
I'm so glad.

3951
04:06:51,960 --> 04:06:53,860
He's alive.

3952
04:06:54,760 --> 04:06:57,720
He just needs some smacks.

3953
04:07:02,880 --> 04:07:05,220
He clung on to life.

3954
04:07:06,160 --> 04:07:07,200
Down but not up.

3955
04:07:15,040 --> 04:07:15,680
Ugh.

3956
04:07:19,540 --> 04:07:20,180
Did...

3957
04:07:21,100 --> 04:07:22,700
Did YouTube break?

3958
04:07:24,200 --> 04:07:25,040
We're back?

3959
04:07:25,680 --> 04:07:26,320
What happened?

3960
04:07:27,280 --> 04:07:29,340
Was also YouTube so shocked about Lizard?

3961
04:07:34,540 --> 04:07:37,140
Don't make me worry ever again Lizard, OK?

3962
04:07:37,760 --> 04:07:39,860
I'm not gonna send you back out there.

3963
04:07:40,740 --> 04:07:41,760
Why are you sick?

3964
04:07:41,760 --> 04:07:46,520
Boss, that magazine I lent you before the last mission.

3965
04:07:46,840 --> 04:07:47,540
Can I have it?

3966
04:07:47,840 --> 04:07:48,060
What?

3967
04:07:48,380 --> 04:07:49,260
You left it out there?

3968
04:07:49,560 --> 04:07:51,200
I haven't finished reading it yet.

3969
04:07:54,020 --> 04:07:55,100
Oh, OK.

3970
04:07:58,520 --> 04:08:00,320
The almost loss of Lizard.

3971
04:08:03,300 --> 04:08:04,160
Scared me.

3972
04:08:05,020 --> 04:08:06,640
Scared me like nothing other.

3973
04:08:06,880 --> 04:08:07,600
My goodness.

3974
04:08:07,600 --> 04:08:07,880
My goodness.

3975
04:08:11,160 --> 04:08:13,760
I shed tears for you Lizard.

3976
04:08:13,800 --> 04:08:15,000
You can't leave me yet.

3977
04:08:20,140 --> 04:08:22,020
Hold on one second.

3978
04:08:22,280 --> 04:08:23,620
Return to Mother Base.

3979
04:08:24,080 --> 04:08:25,760
Lizard lost his tail.

3980
04:08:30,340 --> 04:08:32,080
How do I...

3981
04:08:33,260 --> 04:08:35,520
I wanna see...

3982
04:08:37,160 --> 04:08:38,880
I guess we have to go into the mission select.

3983
04:08:39,000 --> 04:08:42,520
I wanna see some of the codex, like the conversations, but...

3984
04:08:44,780 --> 04:08:46,520
But obviously without...

3985
04:08:51,340 --> 04:08:51,700
Without...

3986
04:08:53,260 --> 04:08:54,120
Doing the mission.

3987
04:08:58,850 --> 04:09:00,430
Filter them by defense or health.

3988
04:09:00,530 --> 04:09:01,210
I know, right?

3989
04:09:01,610 --> 04:09:03,370
I just sent in my worst guys.

3990
04:09:03,470 --> 04:09:04,290
I'll never do it again.

3991
04:09:04,330 --> 04:09:04,950
I'm such a fool.

3992
04:09:08,590 --> 04:09:10,310
It's also item capture.

3993
04:09:14,410 --> 04:09:14,850
Gosh.

3994
04:09:15,890 --> 04:09:17,570
We got classified documents.

3995
04:09:18,190 --> 04:09:19,810
Target demolition, Fulton recovery.

3996
04:09:19,950 --> 04:09:21,090
A lot of Fulton recovery.

3997
04:09:21,210 --> 04:09:22,730
Some of these I might actually do off stream.

3998
04:09:22,810 --> 04:09:23,610
I hope you guys don't mind.

3999
04:09:29,750 --> 04:09:32,150
You really do care for your men, don't you boss?

4000
04:09:32,270 --> 04:09:32,930
I do.

4001
04:09:34,430 --> 04:09:35,310
I do.

4002
04:09:35,670 --> 04:09:36,390
I do.

4003
04:09:40,550 --> 04:09:41,070
No...

4004
04:09:44,670 --> 04:09:49,350
Yeah, like some of these I can do.

4005
04:09:51,230 --> 04:09:52,270
No worries.

4006
04:09:57,650 --> 04:09:59,850
And the cutscenes we got too.

4007
04:10:00,030 --> 04:10:01,830
It's always fun to go back and look at.

4008
04:10:13,820 --> 04:10:14,940
Wait, cancel.

4009
04:10:23,150 --> 04:10:25,570
Saving special missions for stream is a good idea.

4010
04:10:25,930 --> 04:10:26,410
Yeah, yeah.

4011
04:10:26,770 --> 04:10:27,970
That's what I try to do anyway.

4012
04:10:28,350 --> 04:10:31,470
Some of these, like Fulton recovery, number 17.

4013
04:10:33,170 --> 04:10:34,870
There's a lot of extra ops.

4014
04:10:35,410 --> 04:10:40,850
But a lot of them are really good to have for some of the later on stuff.

4015
04:10:43,830 --> 04:10:44,450
Hold on.

4016
04:10:44,590 --> 04:10:45,430
I'm not gonna do this.

4017
04:10:46,590 --> 04:10:47,410
I'm gonna skip it.

4018
04:10:48,770 --> 04:10:51,330
And I'm just gonna go into the briefing files.

4019
04:10:52,550 --> 04:10:53,450
Oh no!

4020
04:10:53,650 --> 04:10:53,950
Wait!

4021
04:10:54,410 --> 04:10:56,410
How do you...?

4022
04:11:00,110 --> 04:11:01,650
How do you...?

4023
04:11:01,650 --> 04:11:02,290
There we go.

4024
04:11:02,490 --> 04:11:03,390
The file library.

4025
04:11:03,530 --> 04:11:04,970
Here we go.

4026
04:11:07,130 --> 04:11:08,330
About himself.

4027
04:11:08,770 --> 04:11:10,430
How Miller met Snake.

4028
04:11:17,410 --> 04:11:20,050
And now here we are fighting side by side.

4029
04:11:21,430 --> 04:11:24,330
Yeah, after I quit the JSDF.

4030
04:11:24,470 --> 04:11:37,590
I wanna hear Miller's Spanish.

4031
04:11:37,590 --> 04:11:38,030
Spanish.

4032
04:11:42,710 --> 04:11:45,510
Japan mentioned.

4033
04:11:56,650 --> 04:12:01,010
He sees Snake and...

4034
04:12:01,290 --> 04:12:02,750
His mind goes blank.

4035
04:12:08,730 --> 04:12:13,010
May, I'm from Japan by the way.

4036
04:12:18,170 --> 04:12:25,410
By the way, I'm from Japan.

4037
04:12:26,830 --> 04:12:27,530
Konnichiwa.

4038
04:12:27,530 --> 04:12:29,470
I'd heard samurai were a proud bunch.

4039
04:12:29,790 --> 04:12:33,730
I wanted to know why one of them would stoop so low as to try to take his opponent with him.

4040
04:12:34,250 --> 04:12:36,110
And I said, I'll never lose again.

4041
04:12:36,530 --> 04:12:37,810
We'll never lose again.

4042
04:12:38,090 --> 04:12:42,290
Yeah, we'll do whatever it takes, but we'll never be beaten again.

4043
04:12:42,630 --> 04:12:45,070
Then, I passed out from the blood loss.

4044
04:12:45,190 --> 04:12:49,130
When I woke up, I was in your camp's infirmary, stuck full of tubes.

4045
04:12:49,570 --> 04:12:52,710
Why'd you save me, your enemy, after I tried to kill you?

4046
04:12:52,710 --> 04:12:57,450
Because you swallowed your pride and fought with everything you had.

4047
04:12:57,550 --> 04:12:58,810
I just didn't want to lose.

4048
04:12:59,130 --> 04:13:01,810
You found a way to fight back, even in the face of death.

4049
04:13:02,070 --> 04:13:03,690
Even when you knew you were going to die.

4050
04:13:04,570 --> 04:13:06,170
That's the mark of a true warrior.

4051
04:13:06,630 --> 04:13:10,090
It's not about gain and loss, or victory and defeat.

4052
04:13:10,770 --> 04:13:15,810
I looked at the way you lived your life and saw the path I needed to take as a warrior.

4053
04:13:16,430 --> 04:13:16,870
Wow.

4054
04:13:17,590 --> 04:13:18,450
I never knew that.

4055
04:13:19,310 --> 04:13:20,270
And that's why you...

4056
04:13:20,270 --> 04:13:25,090
I realized then, that the battlefield doesn't only divide people into allies and enemies.

4057
04:13:25,510 --> 04:13:29,050
Sometimes, it tells you more than just who's an ally or who's an enemy.

4058
04:13:29,710 --> 04:13:33,050
Sometimes, it helps reveal your true comrades.

4059
04:13:33,430 --> 04:13:34,450
Like you and me, huh?

4060
04:13:34,690 --> 04:13:35,210
That's right.

4061
04:13:36,030 --> 04:13:38,610
And two years later, here we are.

4062
04:13:42,810 --> 04:13:44,510
Rolls within Mother Base.

4063
04:13:44,710 --> 04:13:46,790
Whatcha doin' over there, mister?

4064
04:13:47,530 --> 04:13:49,850
Don't forget to give the MSF staff assignments.

4065
04:13:49,850 --> 04:13:53,270
Where you place people will determine how Mother Base grows.

4066
04:13:53,370 --> 04:13:53,730
Right.

4067
04:13:53,990 --> 04:13:55,030
That goes for me, too.

4068
04:13:55,410 --> 04:13:57,150
Assign me wherever you think is best.

4069
04:13:57,370 --> 04:13:57,650
You?

4070
04:13:58,250 --> 04:13:59,750
I thought you were second in command.

4071
04:14:00,110 --> 04:14:01,410
Don't worry, I've got that covered.

4072
04:14:01,670 --> 04:14:03,070
But MSF is still small.

4073
04:14:03,270 --> 04:14:03,750
No, we're not!

4074
04:14:03,770 --> 04:14:06,030
I don't have the leisure of sitting around on my butt all day.

4075
04:14:08,250 --> 04:14:10,270
I see your point, but...

4076
04:14:10,270 --> 04:14:13,930
Not to brag or anything, but I'd kick ass at whatever job you gave me.

4077
04:14:13,930 --> 04:14:17,130
Put me in the area you want to focus on developing most.

4078
04:14:17,310 --> 04:14:20,190
I'll take real good care of the staff there.

4079
04:14:20,370 --> 04:14:21,350
Easy, Kaz.

4080
04:14:29,860 --> 04:14:33,140
I'm jealous of whoever's on Kaz's team.

4081
04:14:35,660 --> 04:14:40,620
The morale in Kaz's team is through the roof.

4082
04:14:44,820 --> 04:14:46,640
This is the best one.

4083
04:14:46,640 --> 04:14:49,520
Snake, about cardboard boxes...

4084
04:14:50,340 --> 04:14:57,120
It feels kind of weird me explaining this stuff to you, but there have been a few recent developments in cardboard box technology.

4085
04:14:57,660 --> 04:14:59,360
So just to be safe, here goes.

4086
04:14:59,780 --> 04:15:00,420
Go on.

4087
04:15:00,920 --> 04:15:03,740
You can do much more with a box than just hide under it.

4088
04:15:04,080 --> 04:15:06,120
You can put it someplace and leave it there.

4089
04:15:07,000 --> 04:15:12,560
You can get on top of it and use it to reach high places, or hide from the enemy in its shadow.

4090
04:15:14,040 --> 04:15:16,040
I like what I'm hearing so far.

4091
04:15:16,040 --> 04:15:17,280
And that's not all.

4092
04:15:17,580 --> 04:15:20,760
You can even put items in it and send them to Co-op's teammates.

4093
04:15:21,100 --> 04:15:21,360
Really?

4094
04:15:22,420 --> 04:15:23,860
I never thought of any of that.

4095
04:15:24,440 --> 04:15:27,900
Damn, is there anything a cardboard box can't do?

4096
04:15:28,480 --> 04:15:30,100
Every soldier should have one.

4097
04:15:30,120 --> 04:15:31,760
Yeah, well, don't get too excited.

4098
04:15:32,220 --> 04:15:34,100
This isn't exactly what they were made for.

4099
04:15:34,560 --> 04:15:39,420
Which reminds me, don't you think the boxes around here are a little on the... big side?

4100
04:15:39,940 --> 04:15:40,360
You're right.

4101
04:15:40,720 --> 04:15:42,800
I bet two people could fit under one box.

4102
04:15:42,800 --> 04:15:44,340
If they packed in tight enough.

4103
04:15:44,460 --> 04:15:46,280
They call them love boxes.

4104
04:15:46,820 --> 04:15:47,380
Love boxes?

4105
04:15:47,820 --> 04:15:50,660
Of course you don't need a love box to fit two people inside.

4106
04:15:51,140 --> 04:15:53,060
Any box of similar size will do.

4107
04:15:56,630 --> 04:15:58,990
Two men in a box...

4108
04:16:00,810 --> 04:16:04,170
Up to two people can fit inside a cardboard box.

4109
04:16:04,470 --> 04:16:05,150
Tell me how.

4110
04:16:05,470 --> 04:16:05,790
Tell me how!

4111
04:16:05,790 --> 04:16:09,770
Get close to a box with a teammate inside, and an icon will appear.

4112
04:16:10,030 --> 04:16:11,850
Then press the action button.

4113
04:16:11,850 --> 04:16:15,150
You'll stay inside as long as the action button is pressed.

4114
04:16:15,950 --> 04:16:17,330
So, same as snake formation?

4115
04:16:18,030 --> 04:16:19,170
Exactly the same.

4116
04:16:19,550 --> 04:16:24,490
In fact, when you put on a cardboard box, when snake in, both of you can climb inside.

4117
04:16:24,890 --> 04:16:28,330
A box big enough to hold me and my buddy.

4118
04:16:29,150 --> 04:16:31,290
These are fine times we live in, hey Kaz?

4119
04:16:31,670 --> 04:16:32,170
Yeah.

4120
04:16:32,750 --> 04:16:33,730
Sure, boss.

4121
04:16:43,580 --> 04:16:45,180
Two men in a box...

4122
04:16:48,300 --> 04:16:48,780
lol

4123
04:17:00,200 --> 04:17:01,660
What about himself?

4124
04:17:02,260 --> 04:17:03,760
How Japanese are you, huh?

4125
04:17:04,820 --> 04:17:06,660
Oh wait, we already did that one, obviously.

4126
04:17:08,020 --> 04:17:08,420
Dang.

4127
04:17:09,040 --> 04:17:10,760
How Japanese are you, Kazuhiro Miller?

4128
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:11,640
Tell me more.

4129
04:17:14,560 --> 04:17:17,240
Are there any other ones that you guys wanna hear about?

4130
04:17:20,860 --> 04:17:22,640
Wait, where's the...

4131
04:17:29,910 --> 04:17:32,110
Chase visits at Hiroshima.

4132
04:17:32,690 --> 04:17:33,570
Why do we care?

4133
04:17:37,110 --> 04:17:38,350
Cecile's name.

4134
04:17:41,530 --> 04:17:43,130
Wait, like...

4135
04:17:44,810 --> 04:17:45,910
This one.

4136
04:17:49,970 --> 04:17:51,370
Oh yeah, that's right.

4137
04:17:51,370 --> 04:17:53,470
I don't know many people from France.

4138
04:17:53,470 --> 04:17:54,390
This is so stupid.

4139
04:17:54,390 --> 04:17:55,230
Is it a common name?

4140
04:17:55,610 --> 04:17:56,610
No, not that common.

4141
04:17:57,130 --> 04:18:01,110
But Wagner's second wife was named Cosima Francesca Gaetano Wagner.

4142
04:18:01,510 --> 04:18:01,830
Huh.

4143
04:18:02,330 --> 04:18:05,010
You know, Kojima is a common last name in Japan.

4144
04:18:05,430 --> 04:18:05,810
Kaz.

4145
04:18:06,190 --> 04:18:11,670
It's just funny how, you know, I'm part Japanese and Cecile's middle name is so close to Kojima.

4146
04:18:11,990 --> 04:18:14,570
It feels like destiny unfolding.

4147
04:18:15,690 --> 04:18:16,850
You think so?

4148
04:18:17,310 --> 04:18:17,690
Oui oui.

4149
04:18:18,130 --> 04:18:19,610
That's a beautiful name you have.

4150
04:18:19,610 --> 04:18:20,110
Oui oui.

4151
04:18:20,110 --> 04:18:22,110
Cecile Kojima Kaminades.

4152
04:18:22,350 --> 04:18:23,490
Wait a second.

4153
04:18:24,030 --> 04:18:26,050
Cecile Kojima Kaminades.

4154
04:18:27,010 --> 04:18:28,370
Kojima Kaminades.

4155
04:18:29,130 --> 04:18:30,590
Hey, that's close to...

4156
04:18:30,590 --> 04:18:31,430
Close to what?

4157
04:18:31,670 --> 04:18:32,290
Your name.

4158
04:18:32,850 --> 04:18:34,770
It sounds almost like the sentence...

4159
04:18:34,770 --> 04:18:36,750
Kojima Kaminades.

4160
04:18:37,330 --> 04:18:37,770
In Japanese.

4161
04:18:38,350 --> 04:18:39,810
And what does it mean, Sibuplay?

4162
04:18:40,210 --> 04:18:43,370
Well, Kami is the word for God in Japanese.

4163
04:18:44,090 --> 04:18:44,770
Nandesu.

4164
04:18:45,010 --> 04:18:45,690
Nandesu.

4165
04:18:45,690 --> 04:18:47,070
It's hard to explain.

4166
04:18:47,530 --> 04:18:51,050
But placed after God, it would turn the sentence into...

4167
04:18:51,050 --> 04:18:51,610
Is God.

4168
04:18:52,010 --> 04:18:52,370
OK.

4169
04:18:53,030 --> 04:18:53,570
So?

4170
04:18:54,210 --> 04:18:55,510
Kojima is God.

4171
04:18:56,170 --> 04:18:57,650
Cecile's name is a message.

4172
04:18:58,330 --> 04:18:59,170
I don't believe it.

4173
04:18:59,790 --> 04:19:00,970
Kojima is God.

4174
04:19:01,490 --> 04:19:02,830
Kojima is God.

4175
04:19:03,230 --> 04:19:03,770
Kaz.

4176
04:19:12,200 --> 04:19:18,000
Oh, by the way, Cecile, I'm Japanese, Cecile, and you know...

4177
04:19:18,000 --> 04:19:20,860
Hello, Cecile.

4178
04:19:21,200 --> 04:19:24,160
My name is Kazuhiro Miller, and I'm also Japanese.

4179
04:19:24,540 --> 04:19:25,300
Do you know Nihongo?

4180
04:19:25,800 --> 04:19:26,400
Konichiwa.

4181
04:19:30,880 --> 04:19:32,720
I take back what I said.

4182
04:19:32,820 --> 04:19:34,420
What did you say about Kaz?

4183
04:19:36,360 --> 04:19:37,480
Kojima is God.

4184
04:19:37,600 --> 04:19:38,720
Kojima is God.

4185
04:19:39,360 --> 04:19:40,800
You can't believe it.

4186
04:19:43,180 --> 04:19:45,380
Guys, tell me more about Japan, please.

4187
04:19:48,680 --> 04:19:51,300
Cecile's whole name was a real Konami employee.

4188
04:19:51,860 --> 04:19:52,220
Wow.

4189
04:19:55,040 --> 04:19:57,980
Cecile Kojima Kaminandesu.

4190
04:20:01,140 --> 04:20:02,420
Kojima Kaminandesu.

4191
04:20:05,660 --> 04:20:06,780
Why can I hear the monkey?

4192
04:20:07,720 --> 04:20:08,560
Oh, Picasso!

4193
04:20:10,820 --> 04:20:11,640
Oh, wait.

4194
04:20:11,720 --> 04:20:12,540
Not Picasso.

4195
04:20:12,700 --> 04:20:14,000
I was thinking of...

4196
04:20:18,320 --> 04:20:19,320
Van Gogh.

4197
04:20:19,520 --> 04:20:21,760
I was going to say that guy was a weeaboo too.

4198
04:20:23,160 --> 04:20:24,420
Ride into Kojima.

4199
04:20:24,600 --> 04:20:26,660
You're a real egotistical developer.

4200
04:20:28,440 --> 04:20:28,960
Macarons.

4201
04:20:28,960 --> 04:20:32,040
Tell me, Snake.

4202
04:20:32,340 --> 04:20:34,380
Do you ever put sweets in your rations?

4203
04:20:35,060 --> 04:20:36,260
Never thought about it before.

4204
04:20:36,800 --> 04:20:37,180
Why?

4205
04:20:37,660 --> 04:20:39,980
Ah, I simply love them.

4206
04:20:40,520 --> 04:20:42,160
French sweets are très delicious.

4207
04:20:42,740 --> 04:20:50,440
Everyone loves crepes, but there are also profiteroles, eclairs, madeleines, financiers.

4208
04:20:51,000 --> 04:20:54,260
Then there's tartatin, and you can't forget savarin.

4209
04:20:54,260 --> 04:20:58,620
Oh, and mille-feuille, crepes, blanc-mange.

4210
04:20:58,640 --> 04:20:59,420
You already said crepes.

4211
04:20:59,540 --> 04:21:01,380
Yeah, you already mentioned crepes.

4212
04:21:03,420 --> 04:21:10,120
Soufflés, croquembouche, cannelle, florentine, queen amagne, peach melbers.

4213
04:21:10,940 --> 04:21:11,660
Finished.

4214
04:21:13,780 --> 04:21:15,220
And macarons.

4215
04:21:15,500 --> 04:21:15,940
Macarons.

4216
04:21:15,940 --> 04:21:17,020
I love those the most.

4217
04:21:17,580 --> 04:21:19,460
Macarons in Parisian are the best.

4218
04:21:19,940 --> 04:21:23,120
They are so cute and colorful, and they contain meringue.

4219
04:21:23,120 --> 04:21:25,020
So they melt right in your mouth.

4220
04:21:25,400 --> 04:21:29,720
Wow, I had no idea macarons were that popular in France, too.

4221
04:21:30,200 --> 04:21:31,840
What do you mean in France, too?

4222
04:21:32,260 --> 04:21:34,740
Macarons are those coconut-flavored cookies, right?

4223
04:21:35,420 --> 04:21:36,680
Excuse you?

4224
04:21:37,080 --> 04:21:40,120
Macarons contain almond powder, not coconuts.

4225
04:21:40,980 --> 04:21:42,080
Don't they have peanuts in them?

4226
04:21:42,420 --> 04:21:44,020
I've had them in Japan a few times.

4227
04:21:44,060 --> 04:21:46,380
I thought they were called macarons.

4228
04:21:47,780 --> 04:21:48,460
Macarons?

4229
04:21:49,140 --> 04:21:51,540
Some cheap imitation, I am sure.

4230
04:21:52,460 --> 04:21:53,060
Catherine!

4231
04:21:53,060 --> 04:21:56,000
French macarons have a long and distinguished history.

4232
04:21:56,500 --> 04:22:02,600
They date back to the 16th century, when Catherine de' Medici of Florence married into the French royal family.

4233
04:22:03,080 --> 04:22:07,140
The story goes that her pâtissier shared the recipe after they arrived.

4234
04:22:07,620 --> 04:22:10,280
That is a history of over 500 years.

4235
04:22:10,980 --> 04:22:13,620
So, they are originally from Italy, then.

4236
04:22:14,980 --> 04:22:17,440
Don't macarons come from Italy, too?

4237
04:22:17,800 --> 04:22:20,460
Look, I do not really think...

4238
04:22:20,460 --> 04:22:24,460
Keep in mind, macaron is almost identical to macaroni.

4239
04:22:24,600 --> 04:22:26,980
Well, that settles it.

4240
04:22:27,640 --> 04:22:29,180
I can't believe this!

4241
04:22:29,660 --> 04:22:32,120
To associate macarons with macaroni?

4242
04:22:32,700 --> 04:22:36,260
You, Monsieur Miller, are an insensible oaf.

4243
04:22:39,280 --> 04:22:41,520
Hey, why am I the bad guy?

4244
04:22:41,960 --> 04:22:43,160
Come on, Cecile, wait!

4245
04:22:43,540 --> 04:22:44,060
Cecile!

4246
04:22:44,700 --> 04:22:45,280
I can't.

4247
04:22:45,340 --> 04:22:46,640
I'm actually crying.

4248
04:22:46,700 --> 04:22:47,480
It's so funny.

4249
04:22:49,500 --> 04:22:51,360
He was so mad.

4250
04:22:51,500 --> 04:22:52,800
He was like...

4251
04:22:52,800 --> 04:22:59,520
Also, don't forget that macarons sound really close to macaroni.

4252
04:23:04,340 --> 04:23:05,840
It's so funny.

4253
04:23:06,180 --> 04:23:07,440
I love Peace Walker.

4254
04:23:08,380 --> 04:23:11,880
Oh my gosh, there's so much gold in the...

4255
04:23:14,480 --> 04:23:17,020
There's so much gold in the codex.

4256
04:23:17,140 --> 04:23:18,060
Or in the tapes.

4257
04:23:18,120 --> 04:23:19,040
They're so good.

4258
04:23:19,880 --> 04:23:21,800
Oh my gosh.

4259
04:23:23,200 --> 04:23:24,800
Mimicking animal calls.

4260
04:23:26,060 --> 04:23:28,560
Isn't there a game like that?

4261
04:23:28,780 --> 04:23:29,960
I want to play it.

4262
04:23:33,520 --> 04:23:35,200
Alright, give it to you, Zen.

4263
04:23:39,120 --> 04:23:40,500
That's pretty good.

4264
04:23:40,880 --> 04:23:41,960
I can do others, too.

4265
04:23:42,420 --> 04:23:45,340
Like a sheep, a pig...

4266
04:23:48,820 --> 04:23:49,440
Wow.

4267
04:23:50,240 --> 04:23:51,280
What about a pig?

4268
04:23:54,040 --> 04:23:55,020
That's uncanny.

4269
04:23:56,750 --> 04:23:58,800
Oh, I can do a rabbit, as well.

4270
04:23:59,180 --> 04:23:59,680
A rabbit?

4271
04:24:00,440 --> 04:24:01,660
Rabbits make noises?

4272
04:24:02,200 --> 04:24:02,520
Certainly.

4273
04:24:03,060 --> 04:24:04,400
But they are very faint.

4274
04:24:04,720 --> 04:24:07,880
So perhaps only someone who has owned one would recognize them.

4275
04:24:08,040 --> 04:24:08,980
I see.

4276
04:24:09,120 --> 04:24:09,860
Are they all rabbit owners?

4277
04:24:09,860 --> 04:24:11,500
So, what do they sound like?

4278
04:24:11,960 --> 04:24:13,440
Listen very carefully.

4279
04:24:14,160 --> 04:24:14,520
Okay.

4280
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:14,580
Okay.

4281
04:24:19,580 --> 04:24:20,120
Seriously?

4282
04:24:20,920 --> 04:24:22,180
Rabbits sound like that?

4283
04:24:22,860 --> 04:24:23,580
He's laughing.

4284
04:24:30,020 --> 04:24:31,100
They do?

4285
04:24:33,100 --> 04:24:34,900
If it sounds like that, I'm dying.

4286
04:24:37,520 --> 04:24:40,440
Cecile, you are too good at your impressions.

4287
04:24:53,500 --> 04:24:54,040
What?

4288
04:24:54,040 --> 04:24:54,220
Oh, what?

4289
04:24:55,220 --> 04:24:57,060
We have to listen to this one.

4290
04:24:59,660 --> 04:25:00,500
Rabbit sledge.

4291
04:25:02,120 --> 04:25:03,600
Guys, this is so great.

4292
04:25:27,920 --> 04:25:29,460
You mean like everybody?

4293
04:25:31,440 --> 04:25:33,220
Hugh, he invented vaping!

4294
04:25:47,220 --> 04:25:49,480
It hurts you and those around you.

4295
04:25:49,680 --> 04:25:52,020
Electronic cigarettes might not seem so bad then.

4296
04:25:52,240 --> 04:25:55,060
Yeah, when that happens, I'll think about it.

4297
04:25:56,840 --> 04:25:58,660
Threw him off the rig.

4298
04:26:02,540 --> 04:26:06,820
It's a wonder Solid Snake didn't catch on to Master Miller being a fake in MGS1.

4299
04:26:06,900 --> 04:26:10,240
He went the whole game without mentioning he was Japanese.

4300
04:26:10,240 --> 04:26:10,980
Japanese...

4301
04:26:14,580 --> 04:26:17,880
I love that one too.

4302
04:26:18,820 --> 04:26:20,460
Oh my goodness.

4303
04:26:21,960 --> 04:26:23,340
There's obviously more.

4304
04:26:24,420 --> 04:26:27,840
But we will listen to other ones another day.

4305
04:26:29,080 --> 04:26:32,240
This one unlocks the...

4306
04:26:36,080 --> 04:26:37,540
The mission, right?

4307
04:26:39,320 --> 04:26:41,600
So Hughie is to blame, good to know.

4308
04:26:42,120 --> 04:26:47,720
Another reason to hate Hughie, yeah.

4309
04:26:48,440 --> 04:26:49,460
So yeah, Monster Hunter.

4310
04:26:51,880 --> 04:26:53,580
We can probably do that next time.

4311
04:26:57,500 --> 04:26:58,820
Pa is so cute.

4312
04:27:04,780 --> 04:27:07,160
Don't forget, she goes eventually for the bonus.

4313
04:27:07,160 --> 04:27:09,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4314
04:27:10,760 --> 04:27:13,520
I'm all worn out from laughing so hard.

4315
04:27:15,220 --> 04:27:17,720
I'm all worn out from laughing so hard.

4316
04:27:17,820 --> 04:27:18,740
They're too good.

4317
04:27:19,540 --> 04:27:20,720
It's so funny.

4318
04:27:21,460 --> 04:27:22,800
Between two women.

4319
04:27:25,500 --> 04:27:26,480
Oh gosh.

4320
04:27:29,760 --> 04:27:31,080
That's so funny.

4321
04:27:32,180 --> 04:27:33,200
We got through.

4322
04:27:33,480 --> 04:27:34,980
Let's see, how many did we get through?

4323
04:27:35,840 --> 04:27:37,980
We did Destroy the Barricade.

4324
04:27:38,260 --> 04:27:42,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

4325
04:27:42,400 --> 04:27:44,460
8 missions today.

4326
04:27:45,280 --> 04:27:46,300
Good job team.

4327
04:27:48,820 --> 04:27:50,560
That was so silly and so fun.

4328
04:27:51,540 --> 04:27:56,080
And we started the part of why I love Peace Walker so much.

4329
04:27:56,600 --> 04:27:58,260
I love the stuff with the mammal pod.

4330
04:27:58,260 --> 04:28:03,520
Do you know that Kazuhiro Miller is half Japanese?

4331
04:28:03,840 --> 04:28:05,160
Oh no, wait, really?

4332
04:28:05,740 --> 04:28:06,840
Oh my gosh, thank you.

4333
04:28:07,800 --> 04:28:08,660
Thanks, Hirule.

4334
04:28:10,060 --> 04:28:11,520
This is so fun.

4335
04:28:11,800 --> 04:28:12,700
So, so, so fun.

4336
04:28:13,120 --> 04:28:14,740
And there's still so much more.

4337
04:28:15,320 --> 04:28:18,840
Next week, yeah, next week will also be Saturday.

4338
04:28:19,560 --> 04:28:21,620
Might go for a little bit longer next week.

4339
04:28:21,620 --> 04:28:27,560
Though, next week I also have a collab at night.

4340
04:28:27,720 --> 04:28:29,120
So I can't go too, too long.

4341
04:28:33,240 --> 04:28:38,860
Yeah, set your sources please about Kazuhiro Miller being half Japanese.

4342
04:28:45,710 --> 04:28:47,270
Next week will be Saturday.

4343
04:28:47,650 --> 04:28:52,370
Well, it's the week after I actually have to play in the middle of the week.

4344
04:28:52,370 --> 04:28:54,430
So, yeah.

4345
04:28:57,410 --> 04:28:59,870
I've been making my schedules in advance.

4346
04:29:00,970 --> 04:29:01,910
More collabs?

4347
04:29:01,970 --> 04:29:02,930
I have two.

4348
04:29:03,510 --> 04:29:05,070
Two collabs next week.

4349
04:29:05,950 --> 04:29:10,350
And they are... I don't know if I will do my POV for either of them.

4350
04:29:11,030 --> 04:29:12,250
Maybe the one at night.

4351
04:29:12,890 --> 04:29:14,930
Because I also have one early, early in the morning.

4352
04:29:15,110 --> 04:29:18,290
And they're both with a bunch of Japanese people.

4353
04:29:18,670 --> 04:29:20,850
Not people, but like...

4354
04:29:20,850 --> 04:29:23,390
They're like Japanese-focused?

4355
04:29:24,070 --> 04:29:25,790
Like, it's hard to explain.

4356
04:29:27,670 --> 04:29:33,150
I don't know a lot of people joining, so I'm nervous.

4357
04:29:35,210 --> 04:29:37,790
We're all down if you ever want an extra OPS grind stream.

4358
04:29:38,390 --> 04:29:38,910
Thanks!

4359
04:29:39,230 --> 04:29:40,690
Maybe as a member or something.

4360
04:29:41,130 --> 04:29:43,370
Yeah, instead of me playing Ground Zeroes.

4361
04:29:44,910 --> 04:29:45,830
Yeah, yeah.

4362
04:29:46,870 --> 04:29:47,910
Collab with guys.

4363
04:29:48,590 --> 04:29:52,990
I hate to break it to you guys, but Kazuhira Miller...

4364
04:29:52,990 --> 04:29:56,110
That guy was discovered in his home last week.

4365
04:29:58,530 --> 04:29:59,930
Act just like Kaz.

4366
04:30:00,250 --> 04:30:03,310
I'll be like, actually, in Japan...

4367
04:30:03,310 --> 04:30:06,710
Macaron is really close to macaroni.

4368
04:30:10,250 --> 04:30:11,850
His half-Japanese home.

4369
04:30:12,390 --> 04:30:14,390
That guy definitely has a tatami mat room.

4370
04:30:18,610 --> 04:30:21,650
He loves his culture.

4371
04:30:22,330 --> 04:30:22,950
Half of it.

4372
04:30:24,470 --> 04:30:25,490
He's really passionate.

4373
04:30:28,750 --> 04:30:30,570
Yeah, he sleeps on a futon.

4374
04:30:31,710 --> 04:30:33,630
He's like, have you guys ever tried this great thing?

4375
04:30:33,730 --> 04:30:35,250
It's called ramen.

4376
04:30:36,870 --> 04:30:38,430
It's extremely Japanese.

4377
04:30:43,960 --> 04:30:45,500
Yeah, this is a lot of fun.

4378
04:30:45,500 --> 04:30:53,000
And this game is actually quite long, so we have a lot more to get through.

4379
04:30:54,740 --> 04:30:56,800
But we're still making good progress.

4380
04:31:01,220 --> 04:31:05,420
Shocking news, Kazuhira Miller was found on his home.

4381
04:31:05,720 --> 04:31:05,980
No!

4382
04:31:07,880 --> 04:31:13,140
Do you think Kaz makes everyone in Mother Base take their boots off when they get on the helicopter boat?

4383
04:31:13,900 --> 04:31:14,300
Absolutely.

4384
04:31:17,800 --> 04:31:21,840
No, probably not on base, but definitely entering his room.

4385
04:31:23,940 --> 04:31:26,680
Definitely entering his room, he makes everyone take off their shoes.

4386
04:31:29,020 --> 04:31:29,880
Thanks for the stream, boss.

4387
04:31:29,960 --> 04:31:31,800
I apologize for my performance in the mission.

4388
04:31:32,240 --> 04:31:32,640
No!

4389
04:31:33,120 --> 04:31:33,580
Way better.

4390
04:31:33,740 --> 04:31:34,360
It was so much fun.

4391
04:31:34,460 --> 04:31:35,460
Thank you for joining.

4392
04:31:35,660 --> 04:31:36,380
Thank you, guys.

4393
04:31:36,900 --> 04:31:38,160
It was so much fun.

4394
04:31:39,760 --> 04:31:42,520
I will see you guys when I see you next.

4395
04:31:43,160 --> 04:31:44,240
Have a good day, have a good night.

4396
04:31:45,560 --> 04:31:47,320
Remember to stay loyal to the mission.

4397
04:31:48,760 --> 04:31:49,500
And I'll see you next.

4398
04:31:54,320 --> 04:31:55,780
See you guys, thank you.
