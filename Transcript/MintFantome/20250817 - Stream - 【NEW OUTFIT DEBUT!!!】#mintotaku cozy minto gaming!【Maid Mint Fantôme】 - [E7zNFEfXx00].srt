00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,300
You're like ghosts!

2
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,360
Oh, everybody, did you see that?

3
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,920
Did you see that?

4
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,360
Isn't that kind of nifty?

00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,620
Did you see it?

6
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,360

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,020
Yeah, hold on.

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,570
I have a little transition stinger now.

14
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,170
Isn't that cute?

15
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,510
I was gonna save a...

17
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,550
I don't know.

18
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,310
I was like, I don't know.

19
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,410
I'll just start using it today.

20
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,430
I like different today.

21
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,150
Nope, I'm still the same.

22
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,990
Thank you guys for the gift.

23
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,090
Thank you.

24
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,710
Thank you, thank you so much.

25
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,610
Thank you, thank you all.

26
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,950
Thank you.

27
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,590
Thank you.

28
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,370
Oh, I didn't...

29
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,170
Wait, did I say...

30
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,330
Did I welcome you home?

31
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,190
I think so.

32
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,070
Wait.

33
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:07,950
You did.

34
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,950
I'm a wee bit nervous.

35
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,310
I'm a wee bit nervous.

36
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,530
There's a lot going on today, you guys.

37
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,050
There's so many things happening today.

38
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,370
So, today's stream will be...

39
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,890
That's, it'll be about the normal length of a reveal.

40
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,250
So, yeah, it's exciting.

41
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,030
I don't want to keep you guys held up here, right?

42
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,010
So, but after the reveal, I want to do a little bit of karaoke.

43
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,470
I have just a couple songs.

44
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,730
I already picked them out too.

45
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,130
And then, I also want to show you guys a preview of something.

46
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,670
So if you stick around to the very end, you will see.

47
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,570
You will see.

48
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,650
I'll challenge.

49
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,430
My drink is burning me.

50
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,210
Yes, yes, yes.

51
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,210
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,590
So, mmm, mmm, mmm.

53
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,710
I don't...

54
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,590
I don't really know what to say.

55
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,210
Or do.

56
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:31,490
I... This is my first proper outfit reveal, so I'm kind of like...

57
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,590
I'm so...

58
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,110
What do I do?

59
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,410
I'm nervous, I'm nervous!

60
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,470
But, um...

61
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,430
And also...

62
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,310

It's, you know, sometimes simple is best, right?

65
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,360
So it's very easy to draw.

66
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,980
And I can take clothes off.

67
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,420
So, um...

68
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,340
So, if you don't want to even draw some of all of it, you can just take stuff off and draw that, too.

69
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,460
Don't blush.

70
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,680
Stop.

71
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,450
It's summer.

72
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,230
It's summer and, you know, it gets a little hot.

73
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,130
So, it's just got, you know, sometimes you guys never strip?

74
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,290
Permission to drop in without clothes.

75
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,650

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,410
I mean, of course, it's, you know, comfy.

81
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,990

I just realized I'm taking you to my room.

101
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,050
Because I've never been to my room before.

102

But it's clean.

106
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,390
Well, it's like a little abandoned.

107
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,850
But you know, I mean...

108
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,770
I just don't like haunting with people, you know what I mean?

109
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,090
If I accidentally spook them, they'll be like, And then I'm like, So...

110
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,910
It's just, uh, it's just easier to choose someplace abandoned, right?

111
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,210
That makes sense.

112
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,730

You know, actually, there is one thing I want to do.

156
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,540
Because when I'm like...

157
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,800
When I'm getting...

158
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,280
When I'm getting comfy, cozy...

159
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,940
I'm just going to pretend that you guys are not here.

160
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,340
Is that okay?

161
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:03,760
One thing that I like to do, now that I'm all like changed and just feeling trying to relax, wind down after a busy day at the maid cafe, I think I'm going to write a little bit.

162
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,200
Is that okay?

163
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
You don't mind, right?

164
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,700
You guys can just kind of do your own thing.

165
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,140
And I'm going to write a little bit.

166
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,600
But I want some, I want some suggestions if you don't mind.

167
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,840
So, let's see.

168
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,900
Okay.

169
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,340
Wait, that's not what I meant to do.

170
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,780
Don't, don't, don't, wait, don't react to that.

171
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,060
Wait, how do I stop this?

172
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,560
What?

173
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,220
Wait, what is this feature?

174
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,100
Ah!

175
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,160
Wait!

176
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,480
Ah!

177
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Okay, one moment.

178
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,040
Here we go.

179
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,660
Okay, okay, okay.

180
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,700
What the hell is a Q&A?

181
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,720
Okay, you guys have like 30 seconds to answer.

182
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,210
I see, I see, interesting.

183
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,130
Interesting, interesting.

184
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,830
I'm gonna change the BGM for this.

185
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,460
Wow, that's an overwhelming win.

186
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,600
You guys are freaks or something.

187
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,260
It's time to Yume out.

188
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,360
I mean, that's me every day.

189
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:00,700
Okay.

190
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,040
Oh, Yume out.

191
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,840
Oh, Yume out.

192
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,860
Um, cool.

193
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,640
I don't think it's going to change at all.

194
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,800
So, I will write a fanfic of me and Snake.

195
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,440
Okay.

196
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,280
Gotta get cozy.

197
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,780
Okay, here we go.

198
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,060
Snake, don't forget your bento.

199
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,240
I made it just for you.

200
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,920
I put extra, extra, extra cheese and a calorie mate too.

201
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,020
Snake smirked smirkedly.

202
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,160
Thanks, Minto.

203
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,940
who could cook and clean, which you can definitely do, and you do every day.

204
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,880
Such a great job.

205
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,420
With no mistakes, Minto blushed.

206
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,340
Her blush extending from the tip of her tippy button nose to the tip of her pointy ears.

207
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,740
She was embarrassed.

208
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,000
It had all been one year since Snake left Ocelot, but the thought of them not being together still crosses her mind.

209
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,220
Does he still think of Ocelot?

210
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,580
When they sleep in the same bed?

211
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,180
Oh, but Mint and Snake don't do anything.

212
00:18:14,380 --> 00:19:02,060
They just sleep not doing anything like that anyway does he wish that he was sleeping in the same bed and also uh wait touching oselot but but in a in not in a bad way in like a way that is romantic that will make him happy minto ponders that this is a good start this is a good start to chapter 1 i'd say i'd say this is a good yeah but there but but it needs more workshopping i will continue this i will i will put this in the in my folder that will be continue writing

213
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,130

214
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,210
wow Look at you guys!

215
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,170
Look at you, look how gooey you are.

216
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,330
I finally got to take my shoes off.

217
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,690
And you know, guys, those were heels.

218
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,230
I've been wearing like heels for quite some time now.

219
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:43,290
So, it's finally, it feels so good to finally be able to just, yeah, put my slippers on.

220
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,330
I wear slippers all the time.

221
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,310
Like I'm never not wearing slippers, you know.

222
00:19:52,330 --> 00:20:15,790
you guys see it all you guys see you guys getting comfy and what's this what's a tail what what that you how did you how could you you probably couldn't tell that it was a tail from the silhouette uh uh uh Uso!

223
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,510
Uso!

224
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,430
Yeah, I'm like good on my tippy toes too.

225
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,270
Where does it come from?

226
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,090
Well, I do have a reference that I will show you all.

227
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,190
Yes.

228
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,470
The only bounce Minto has?

229
00:20:41,990 --> 00:21:40,730
Honestly, I think Celia probably was just like well I'm not I'm not rigging boobs so you guys this is the jiggle physics isn't this what you came for the vtuber jiggle physics yes yes yes but let's I still feel like riding though you guys I still feel like riding I'm trying to really get into my into my cozy comfort feeling you know now that I'm home and all that so um let's see what let's let's write something else let's write something else so what should I write let's see same

230
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,150
as before same as before.

231
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,570
Also, my legs.

233
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,850
Well, you guys can normally see my legs, I think.

234
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,790
I think you guys can normally see my legs, though.

235
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:12,650
Oh!

236
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,350
You saw nothing?

237
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,250
There we go.

238
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,590
I'll zoom in a little bit.

239
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,130
Oh.

240
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,330
So what should I write?

241
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:40,590
about we have three options write in my diary right about how cute my oh she is or write about akihabara hmm decisions decisions decisions

242
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:53,070
decisions decisions but i think how cute my oh she is is it's another overwhelming win it's crazy

243
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:59,350
all right all right that's your oshi smirk smirkedly i will then write about my oshi this will definitely get my creative juices flowing that but yeah yeah i should reconsider that phrasing okay anyway it's not like that it's not like that okay whatever i'm gonna write about my because she's so cute okay guys do you ever just fall in love do you ever look at someone for the first time and think wow we they are just the greatest most beautiful most amazing most wonderful most cutest most spectacular being you've ever seen in this world in this universe well that's how i feel about myoshi myoshi is the cutest girl ever to ever exist she does many cute things like pose with her hands and she has a big old smile and she does many cute faces if you ever saw her would fall in love too.

244
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,730
Sometimes when she sees me, she touches my hand.

245
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,250
And sometimes when she sees me, she is just very cute.

246
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,630
Actually, that's every time she sees me.

247
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,970
She is always cute.

248
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:18,770
If I get amnesia, I would be happy because I could meet her again all over for the first time and experience the feeling of falling in love all over again.

249
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,850
She is my soul Oshi, and I would find her in any incarnation.

250
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,150
Is that right?

251
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,550
I love my Oshi.

252
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,170
The end.

253
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,710
Yep, pretty much that.

254
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,070
Pretty much that.

255
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,710
Yeah, pretty much.

256
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,410
Yeah.

257
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,870
Do you guys feel that too?

258
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,310
Do you guys feel that way as well, Masuroshi?

259
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,890
I'd say.

260
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,390
It's a very strong bond I have with me and myoshi.

261
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,130
I would find her in every timeline.

262
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,790
I'd say.

263
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,890
And...

264
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,350
Boom!

265
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,370
Oh!

266
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,230
Oh my gosh.

267
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,710
Big puppy jacket!

268
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,090
Big, big jacket!

269
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,270
Big, big jacket!

270
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,290
And she's got shorts on!

271
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:19,750
Whoa!

272
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,610
Whoa, whoa!

273
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,590
I'm so pink, right?

274
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,530
I think, I think, I am-y mama.

275
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,270
Made this outfit...

276
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,530
When I saw it, I was just like...

277
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,950
It kind of looks like I borrowed her wardrobe.

278
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,130
It kind of feels like I borrowed her wardrobe a little bit.

279
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,950
But also...

280
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,530
Also...

281
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,070
Let's see.

282
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,970
I'll zoom in just a tiny tad bit.

283
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,190
Because...

284
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,770
There's, of course, something very important.

285
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:54,810
Maybe.

286
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,050
Maybe.

287
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:57,670
Perhaps.

288
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,630
You know, of course if it...

289
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,610
Let me...

290
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:13,070
I mean,

291
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,300
it's breezy in here, but it's still summer, no!

292
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,720
So, I just thought it would be...

293
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
Just thought it might be good to...

294
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
To, you know...

295
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,720
To take it on!

296
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,820
There you guys go.

297
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,760
Oops, don't look.

298
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,860
There you go.

299
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,680
Exactly what you wanted, huh?

300
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,080
Look at that.

301
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,340
I lotioned up, baby.

302
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,940
That's fresh ectoplasm.

303
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,500
Right there.

304
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,900
Enhance, enhance!

305
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,380
So, the tummy

306
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,250
But we'll keep the jacket on for now.

307
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,910
We'll keep the jacket on for now.

308
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,530
Guys, I still want to write more, though.

309
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,330
I want to write more.

310
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,830
I want to write more.

311
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,650
Let's do one more.

312
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,070
One more, one more writing prompt.

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,880
Decide, decide, decide!

316
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,140
Rigged!

317
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,000
What do you mean, rigged?

318
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,600
I was like, can you kind of see my hair?

319
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,720
Kind of see my hair.

320
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,900
Peaking out the illusion of choice.

321
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,320
No!

322
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,480
Number three, my lord.

323
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,280
Pick number three, my lord.

324
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,780
No, they're definitely different choices.

325
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah, they're definitely different.

326
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,840
Okay.

327
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,700
Okay, I'm going to write about the Revolver Ocelot.

328
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,940
Good choice, everybody.

329
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,600
Good choice.

330
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,460
Revolver Ocelot.

331
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,100
Revolver Ocelot.

332
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,740
Revolver Ocelot.

333
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Revolver Ocelot.

334
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,120
Revolver Ocelot.

335
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:23,880
Revolver Ocelot.

336
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,600
Revolver.

337
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
This guy drives me absolutely bonkers!

338
00:29:26,460 --> 00:30:18,200
It is something that's hard for me to describe because it's far beyond love or any admiration i put this man on a pedestal i put him above every human being ever that has been born or existed in this universe revolver also is everything that i wish could be and he is someone that i don't even know how to describe how much this man has changed my brain chemistry how could someone be so the way that they are so unapologetically themselves to such a mad degree that he just does it all i can't i can't describe him perfectly because there's just so much to him he's everything that i want everything i want to be a revolver ocelot just just saying his name shiver down my spine he's such a he's such a powerful powerful force in my afterlife

339
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,320
just this just like the speech make it's and the Ocelot that changed him, his trajectory of his life.

340
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,280
That's how I felt just watching that scene.

341
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,320
I felt the osmosis of afterlife changing.

342
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,040
This, and it happened to me as well, you know, through him.

343
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,200
If I...

344
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:54,400
If there was one person I could ever possess for the rest of my afterlife and just see a little bit, a little bit of what goes inside their brain, their head, it would be Ocelot.

345
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,220
The end.

346
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,640
The end.

347
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:04,990
The end.

348
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,850
I didn't get enough off my chest.

349
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,250
But...

350
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,250
But...

351
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,450
It still felt good.

352
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,210
It still felt good.

353
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:13,650
3!

354
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,570
Boo!

355
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,710
Ghost.

356
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,190
Is that what you thought it would say?

357
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,710
Ghost.

358
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,450
Yay!

359
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,770
I feel so comfy.

360
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,190
So, so comfy.

361
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,730
And I got, I got a cute little, little necklace on.

362
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,130
I got a cute little necklace on.

363
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,770
And, um, of course, I'll show you without the jacket on.

364
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:52,930
Bada-dum.

365
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:53,910
Oh!

366
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,110
Don't call it a caller, you freak!

367
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,550
What are you talking about?

368
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,270
What are you talking about?

369
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,270
Oh, it does jingle a little bit.

370
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,910
And that also...

372
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,730
You know, sometimes...

373
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,890
Okay, this is like maybe a very specific situation.

374
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:25,250
But you know when you are sleeping and you are cold but hot at the same time, stick out one leg.

375
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,150
But what if you just, like, stick out your shoulders?

376
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:40,710
What if I just kind of, like, removed the tank top underneath?

377
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,390
And...

378
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,010
It's just kind of similar to, like, sticking your leg out.

379
00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:18,010
to where you um to where you and it like i said it's it's it's it's it's still summer so it gets warm but it's also it's also quite quite chilly at night so it's nice to have a little bit of both i'd say okay i'm embarrassed but also i want to point out this guy look at him go

00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,170
It makes me want to eat pudding.

382
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:34,770
Yeah.

383
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:43,110
As for the slippers, I was supposed to have this made as merch, but unfortunately, it did not happen.

384
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:50,010
But hopefully in the future, you guys can get your very own Wisp slippers.

385
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,970
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,370

Yippee!

458
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:21,080
You guys kind of like the old school fujoshi, old school otaku look a little bit.

459
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:32,620
And then also, like I showed you with the jacket, without the frills, and I showed you the glasses.

460
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,700
But also, also, I can do it with my other hair.

461
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:47,860
So it's kind of fun to, to, I think actually, actually, like this looks so natural.

462
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,380
Yeah, so I can still have my main headband on.

463
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,080
It's still me, it's still me.

464
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,800
And if I put my braids, if I take my braids out...

00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,900
Long hair.

00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,980
Which, I said, sorry, today's karaoke will probably be incredibly...

524
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,720
Can you hear it?

525
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,960
I just noticed.

526
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:03,720
Can you hear it?

527
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,940
Oh, well, you probably can't hear it right now.

528
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,680
Hopefully, you can hear it in, like, two seconds.

529
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,100
Uh.

530
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:13,980
Uh.

531
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,400
Uh.

532
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,280
Can I hear it?

533
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:49,260

534
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,260
That should be good, right?

535
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,400
Is that...

536
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,680
Is that okay?

537
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,320
You hear it?

538
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,780
Okay, cool.

539
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,420
Me too.

540
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,860
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

541
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
Yeah, I have four ears.

542
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,460
The more to ignore you with my dear.

543
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:19,360
All the backseating will go through the cat ears, so I kind of Nora butter.

544
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,240
Just in and out, baby.

545
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,090
Let's try.

546
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:30,650
Sorry.

547
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,450
I'm using the joy sound.

548
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,550
So, joy sound on the switch.

549
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,470
I didn't practice this.

550
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:53,130
This is going to be probably scuffed, but...

551
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,560
That's so wonderful.

552
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:32,520
That's so wonderful I can't see I can't see that's the way I want to be I don't want to hear me or

553
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,480
I'll test you to do it So I'm a man, I'm a man, don't fall out

554
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:01,980
I learned today that this song is composed by the same lady that composed four fruits basket.

555
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,040
Isn't that kind of crazy?

556
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,840
I was like, what?

557
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,660
What is this?

558
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,900
The contrast is crazy.

559
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:20,410
I'm gonna also Let's get rid of this and This And so I'll sing with my outfit out, like, you can actually see it.

560
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,050
Like, I'll sing like this.

561
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,430
Just singing in my room.

562
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,490
Just singing.

563
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,530
All by myself.

564
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,510
For funsies.

565
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,130
What did I have next?

566
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:32,690
Oh gosh.

567
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,810
I wrote everything down.

568
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,500
I wrote the wrong thing.

569
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,080
Oh.

570
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,180
This one, probably, they're all going to be scuffed.

571
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:44,980
I really apologize.

572
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,940
Yeah, I gotta show the wiggle off.

573
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,340
I gotta show the wiggle off.

574
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,480
But also, like, look at my hips.

575
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,420
English.

576
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,080
It's not an English song though.

577
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,980
But we can be a little sexy for this one, I think.

578
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,300
There we go.

579
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,120
Oh.

580
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:21,750
Yes.

581
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:22,770
This one.

582
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:30,850
I realized that a lot of these songs I picked, because they're like Annie's song, I don't know the full versions.

583
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,550
So I Apologize for like the middle.

584
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,460
Here I'll get a little closer.

585
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,340
There we go.

586
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,100
Maybe that's better.

587
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,640
Oh, right in my...

588
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,300

I need to stop pretending I'm sexy.

611
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,170
It doesn't work!

612
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:01,950

Yubi!

629
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,060
Sadly, I can't do the dance for this, so if you know the dance, do

630
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:39,480
it.

631
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,120
If you open your heart, open your heart.

632
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,260
Let's move, the voice will be together.

633

The win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win.

01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:00,570
I'm

640
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,550
doing the dance, kind of.

641
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,270
I'm doing the dance, kind of.

642
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:16,910
That was real eyes!

643
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,550
Realize, real eyes, real eyes.

644
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,270
Real, real lies.

645
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:23,870
Real lies.

646
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,090
Real lies.

647
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,050
I don't know what I'm saying anymore.

648
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,210
I don't know what I'm saying anymore.

649
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,330
Real eyes, real lies.

650
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,750
Real lies.

651
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,270
Real eyes.

652
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,230
Real eyes.

653
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:43,810
Real eyes.

654
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,070
Realize.

655
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:49,750
I forgot to do like facial expressions and stuff.

656
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,050
We can do it with...

657
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,490
with this in the background, I suppose.

658
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,830
Um...

659
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,090
Uh...

660
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,810
Uh...

661
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,210
They're all the same, though.

662
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:07,790
Um...

663
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,250
Wait!

664
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:09,870
This...

665
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:10,750
goes perfect!

666
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:11,710
Now!

667
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,640
Why did I tongue them out?

668
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,810
I'm a real cat.

669
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:33,650
Yeah!

670
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,940
Um, meow.

671
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,780
What do you mean you want to keep seeing my tummy?

672
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,580
You you freaks?

673
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,900
What do you mean?

674
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:10,620
What do you mean you wish that I could toggle the the the The frills off my tank top off with also the jacket off What do you mean?

675
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,060
That's what you wish to see.

676
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:39,810
Are you...

677
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:41,390
Are you satisfied?

678
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,400
Are you...

679
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,700
Are you satisfied?

680
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:53,680
Okay.

681
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,220
Layouts I got.

682
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,200
Um...

683
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,640
Um...

684
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,080
But in your ear.

685
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,010
That was fun.

686
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,150
That was exciting.

687
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,710
And then, of course, you know.

688
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,430
Would you adopt a mean kitty?

689
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:01,090
If you saw a mean kitty on the side of the street, would you...

690
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:06,130
If you saw a mean kitty in a cardboard box, would you say just a box and walk away?

691
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:10,650
Would you investigate said box and would you adopt mink at him?

692
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,990
I can't cook or clean.

693
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,650
I'm a mid at a mid cafe.

694
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,530
I don't know how to do anything.

695
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:22,250
So I actually, all I would do is, I'm potty trained though.

696
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:24,510
I think.

697
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:30,570
Just a box.

698
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,800
Just a box.

699
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,860
If you write that on the litter box, it would work.

700
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:56,280
So you would adopt a mean kitty and allow her into your home to claw your furniture and eat your food and haunt your space?

713
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,740

activate somebody.

723
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Especially with the caller.

724
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,720
But I guess I'll do it anyway.

728
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:32,460

Shall I sing?

733
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,960
This next one I might also get scuffed because that's one of those songs.

734
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,540
Sorry, I'm so nervous still.

735
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,120

But this next one is not from an Edoge, but it is from a show also about Edoge, and I bring out my glasses again, because there's a character in it.

739
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,480
That also wears these same glasses.

740
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,220
Can you guess?

741
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,560
