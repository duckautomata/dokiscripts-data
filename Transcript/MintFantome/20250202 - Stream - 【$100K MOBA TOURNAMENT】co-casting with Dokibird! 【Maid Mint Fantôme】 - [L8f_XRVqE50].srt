1
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,200
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,080
I don't know how you guys might be like...

3
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,380
What the fuck?

4
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,580
It's okay, I used R1.

5
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,860
One down, one down, one to go.

6
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,320
It already started.

7
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,240
I mean, what's going on here?

8
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,880
Okay, so like, we're told we can only have two F-bombs.

9
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,360
And bombs.

10
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,660
And the whole stream!

11
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,800
And the whole stream!

12
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,560
You

13
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
know, it was just natural.

14
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,040
I couldn't help it, man.

15
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,640
It's been a week since I streamed, I couldn't help it.

16
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,800
I need to get it out.

17
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,260
So it's not like two out of each of us, it's two in the entire stream from all of us here.

18
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,940
And you're like, what do you mean by all of us?

19
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,800
It's just you and me.

20
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,680
No, we actually have a mysterious third person here with us today.

21
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,220
What?

22
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,820
That's me.

23
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,820
Hi, I'm a mysterious person.

24
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,640
I'm Fulham, to those of you who don't know me.

25
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,740
I also don't have a VTuber model because I'm not a VTuber.

26
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm the Minecraft guy.

27
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,780
CaptainSparklez?

28
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,680
He's not CaptainSparklez.

29
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,500
I wish, I wish.

30
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,740
Oh my god, it's the CaptainSparklez, but British.

31
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,740
British CaptainSparklez.

32
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,420
Do you want to do an introduction, Fulham?

33
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,160
I mean, dude, I think you guys introduced me well enough.

34
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,160
I can be a British CaptainSparklez if you need me.

35
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,720
I think as far as I know, my aim is to help you guys know what's going on in the game.

36
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,680
Yes, so he is our Minecraft analysis.

37
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,060
Analysis expert.

38
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,840
Yeah, yeah, the analysis expert.

39
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,360
Because we are here, Min and I are here, to cast a Minecraft tournament.

40
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,560
Yeah!

41
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,480
I guess you couldn't tell that it's you.

42
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,840
It's not just any kind of Minecraft tournament.

43
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,760
Oh, no, no, no.

44
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,720
It is a MOBA Minecraft tournament, which Min and I have zero knowledge.

45
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,800
We were like, wait, today, we're like, wait, this is a MOBA?

46
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,380
And then I was like, wait, I thought you knew about MOBA.

47
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,260
It's like, no, I don't play.

48
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
I didn't say it, I didn't say it, we still have our one.

49
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,120
It's okay, we still got one left, we still got one left.

50
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,720
I didn't say it.

51
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
No, I didn't say it.

52
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,720
I don't freaking play League.

53
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,320
League!

54
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,580
It's great, because none of us play League, and none of us play any MOBAs.

55
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,900
So we're all gonna have to learn as we go.

56
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,740
We're gonna learn today.

57
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,320
I've played Minecraft, though.

58
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,840
Actually, Doki and I, we recently spedrun beating the game.

59
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, yeah, beating.

60
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,440
On hardcore.

61
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,700
Yeah, we totally beat it.

62
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,320
See, this is what I like to hear.

63
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,740
That's my whole thing.

64
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,800
That's what I do every day.

65
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,020
I do the whole speedrunning thing.

66
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,040
We did it under 24 hours, too.

67
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,000
Dude, that is faster than some people I know.

68
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,480
Congratulations.

69
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,500
What's your PB?

70
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
Okay, okay, you're asking...

71
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,160
Alright, I mean, 10 minutes, 40 seconds.

72
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,100
But let's, you know, 10 minutes, 24 hours, that's the same thing, man.

73
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,300
It's, yeah, exactly.

74
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,060
We were in hardcore, I think that accounts for like, you know, minus...

75
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,160
That actually, yeah.

76
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,420
Minus, like, 50 hours or something.

77
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,600
Exactly.

78
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,360
So I think you guys beat me, to be fair.

79
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,680
I feel like we are the professionals at this point.

80
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,420
Yeah, I think so.

81
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,560
Yeah, so, yeah, so we're here to cast...

82
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,840
It was actually crazy.

83
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,780
They, like, asked me to cast a Minecraft tournament.

84
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,180
And they're wondering, oh, hey, dude, you know anyone you could bring over?

85
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,600
And I was like, I think Mint's a good co-caster.

86
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,060
And then Mint actually researched more about this than I did.

87
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,220
I didn't research.

88
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,900
They literally sent us documents that you chose not to read.

89
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,440
I got food poisoning yesterday.

90
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
I have my excuse.

91
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,060
I got food pois... Okay, I think everyone knows I'm in Japan.

92
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,820
Everyone knows now, anyway.

93
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,520
I mean, my times... The times I've been commuting is very obvious.

94
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,600
How do I get food poisoning in Japan?

95
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,900
Like, I don't...

96
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,140
It's the MOBA part.

97
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,200
MOBA part.

98
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Oh my gosh, look at this map.

99
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,080
It's kind of crazy.

100
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,120
This map is pretty cool.

101
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,400
I was told that the maps have names.

102
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,600
I'm going to be real with you.

103
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't remember what they are.

104
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,420
So I'm going to find out right now.

105
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,100
We are in Round 1 Block City.

106
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,440
That is a really imaginative name for a city full of blocks, I think.

107
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,180
I wish I was shitting you, but that's, like, the real name.

108
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,120
That's so good.

109
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,540
It's restarting.

110
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,140
It's restarting again.

111
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Okay, we're back.

112
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,160
Maybe we're not back, actually.

113
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,800
We hear audio from their game.

114
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,360
Oh, there's the golden rabbit.

115
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,480
What is that?

116
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,660
Oh, it's called Block City.

117
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,760
Round 1 is in Block City.

118
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,300
That's what I said.

119
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,820
Oh, I thought you were lying.

120
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,860
We're back to CaptainSparklez.

121
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,820
Oh, yeah.

122
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,020
What's the lore?

123
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,640
You said you read the lore.

124
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,520
Well, hold on.

125
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,040
I believe the first match is TeamSparklez versus TeamHannah.

126
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,380
Uh-huh.

127
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,860
Now, I know all of the people in this event.

128
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,320
Because I'm in the Minecraft scene.

129
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm in the space.

130
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,700
I know the teams, which is kind of cool.

131
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,280
You know them?

132
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,460
So, some people know that I'm actually not at my home PC right now.

133
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,820
I'm in the house of someone who's playing on CaptainSparklez's team.

134
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,740
I think he's in TeamSparklez right now.

135
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,180
I'll pay you $50 to sabotage.

136
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
Do you want me to go unplug his internet?

137
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,920
That would be really good.

138
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,460
Go unplug his monitor right now.

139
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,480
Put some peanut butter on it.

140
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,240
Unleash a rat to go and do the dirty work for you.

141
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,740
That's weird.

142
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,780
There is one really long cable running through the room.

143
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,340
But I think it's the internet cable.

144
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,160
Do it.

145
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,740
There's some scissors over there.

146
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,080
They won't know.

147
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,860
It's not like there's evidence right here.

148
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm also connected to that internet though.

149
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,460
So, I would just vanish at the same time.

150
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,300
That would be for a worthy cause.

151
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,820
Imagine the content.

152
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,500
Imagine the drama in the content.

153
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,240
If I leave at some random point...

154
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,720
If you unplug this guy's internet, everybody will know.

155
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,560
Drama creates content.

156
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,240
I learned about that last week.

157
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,220
Let's save that for another time.

158
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm going to read some things from the document.

159
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,700
I'm going to read the objective of the game.

160
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,380
That's helpful to know, I think.

161
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,200
I think the objective is going to be super important.

162
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh, there's Hannah!

163
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,100
They're bowing to each other.

164
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,740
So polite.

165
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,520
Good game.

166
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,720
The objective is to eliminate the enemy's dragon.

167
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Each team has their own little ender dragon.

168
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,780
It's actually kind of cute.

169
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,240
It's surrounded by end crystals.

170
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,100
It's kind of like the ender dragon fight.

171
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,260
Where you have to destroy the crystals.

172
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,280
Before the dragon can be killed.

173
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,240
And they also have withers.

174
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,720
I don't know what that's about.

175
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, so the dragon is the end point.

176
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,580
Like League.

177
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,140
The dragon is the giant crystal in League.

178
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,200
I don't play League, but I've seen it.

179
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,700
With your own two eyes?

180
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
Yeah, with my own two eyes.

181
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,460
I've seen one or two League games in my life.

182
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,860
Oh, it's the Nexus!

183
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,220
Oh my god.

184
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,660
One of the moderators are like yelling at me.

185
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,880
Be like, it's the Nexus!

186
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,700
It's called the Nexus, Doki.

187
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,420
You goddamn nerd.

188
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,940
I'm sorry.

189
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
I'm sorry.

190
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,520
Mint didn't know what it was either.

191
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,220
I didn't claim to know.

192
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,940
You did.

193
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,260
I've seen a League game or two in my day.

194
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,200
Like one or two.

195
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,900
How am I supposed to know the names?

196
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,840
I don't know either.

197
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,860
That's why we are the professional casters for this tournament.

198
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,140
Go on with the rules.

199
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,580
There's five rounds.

200
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,340
Each round will take place in a different map.

201
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,280
Which is kind of cool.

202
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,640
Um...

203
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,200
Oh, there's like...

204
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,100
There's like...

205
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,340
There's different players.

206
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,940
So each player is going to start at their house base.

207
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,700
And then they're going to pick a character.

208
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,460
Oh, so that's where they're choosing the character.

209
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,140
Wait, oh yeah, you were telling me...

210
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,380
Apparently, each of these...

211
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,380
There's like characters with actual lore written about them.

212
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,060
Yeah, it's kind of intricate.

213
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,220
Like, we have...

214
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,080
Sir Block.

215
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,220
I need to hear about the granny again, please.

216
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,280
Because there's this granny.

217
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,260
I want to know someone that's playing as the granny in this game.

218
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,580
We have Granny Gooddrop.

219
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,920
Age 77.

220
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,140
She is recognizably an alien-like slimy yet wholesome grandma character.

221
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,620
She plays for the kinship.

222
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
But some people play for the thrill.

223
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Which I was like, hag love.

224
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,440
Hag love.

225
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,100
I do.

226
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,180
That's the VTuber hive mind going on there.

227
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,420
Yeah, they're like, finally some good content.

228
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,820
Nah.

229
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,980
But they have like ultimate abilities.

230
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,960
So basically there's mobs in the game as well that they can kill to get money.

231
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,300
And then they can buy like armor or upgrades.

232
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,420
Yeah.

233
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,580
So it's just basically like farming creep and league and deadlock.

234
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,940
You know so much.

235
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,520
You know so much about this.

236
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,880
I play deadlock.

237
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,700
I play deadlock, which is sort of like league, but like shooter.

238
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,160
I mean, I feel like this game is more like deadlock than league.

239
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,120
Actually, this is actually a lot more like deadlock than league.

240
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,100
Wow.

241
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,760
I never took you as a league player, Doki Bird.

242
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,140
No, I didn't like deadlock.

243
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,360
Oh, so you like league.

244
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,240
She said she didn't like deadlock, everybody.

245
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,740
She liked league.

246
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,160
No, no, no.

247
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,760
That's what I'm hearing.

248
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,380
I've never watched Arcane because I'm scared it's going to make me like league.

249
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,280
That's the same reason I've not watched it either.

250
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,960
Because I do not want to like league yet.

251
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,120
Doki, oh my god, you have to watch Arcane, it's so good.

252
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,380
And I was like, no.

253
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,460
That's a legitimate thing you'd say.

254
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,360
I'm afraid that I'll actually like league if I watch Arcane.

255
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,520
And I refuse to give league my time.

256
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,440
All I know is that it takes a really long time to play.

257
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,260
Like, you sit there for 12 hours and then you've gained like three elo.

258
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,220
It's like 40 minutes to one hour per game.

259
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,760
And then if you're losing, the team will hold you hostage.

260
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:25,980
Because you can't quit, you can't surrender, but you have to have the whole team wanting to surrender.

261
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,600
And there's always going to be one asshole that's not going to let you surrender.

262
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,600
Like, my whole thing is doing things quickly.

263
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,220
Like, I want to speedrun, so like 10 minutes, great, cool, yeah, awesome.

264
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,380
Like, giving me an hour long game?

265
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,440
Dude, I can't handle that.

266
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,740
Luckily, I don't think these games are an hour.

267
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,580
That's why this is better, because I'm pretty sure we're not going to be held hostage for an hour.

268
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,060
And it's Minecraft!

269
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,840
20-30 minutes at most.

270
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Wait, how long have you been speedrunning for?

271
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,620
Yeah.

272
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,640
This has been my thing for like four years, roughly.

273
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,960
So, I mean, yeah.

274
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,120
Are you on any records?

275
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,720
I used to have top 10 worldwide, which was pretty good.

276
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,540
And then I've slowly kind of realized that I don't have the time to put into...

277
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,600
Dude, some of these people spend all day doing it, and I do not have that.

278
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,180
I don't have that kind of capacity in me anymore.

279
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,860
What do you do then?

280
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,000
Dude, I'm getting old.

281
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
You're a speedrunner.

282
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,620
What do you do if you're not speedrunning?

283
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,500
Well, like, stream.

284
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,320
Some of these people do it offline and stuff, man.

285
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh!

286
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,460
That's like me when I play Rank.

287
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,320
I get it.

288
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,020
I get it.

289
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,820
I get that.

290
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,180
Yeah.

291
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
You actually have a life outside of streaming.

292
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,100
That's crazy.

293
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,580
Hey, I don't want to say that I'm at a friend's house right now doing this commentary, but hey, we were at a birthday party.

294
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:52,960
Wait, why are you at your friend's house?

295
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,060
Oh, it was a birthday party?

296
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,520
What?

297
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,400
Shit, sorry.

298
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,760
Doki.

299
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,720
It's okay.

300
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,420
It's okay.

301
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,040
It's okay.

302
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,060
It's okay.

303
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,260
We made it 30 minutes.

304
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,380
We made it 30 minutes.

305
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
That's a good amount.

306
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,140
I had 30 minutes of it being live.

307
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,460
It's been a week, guys.

308
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,280
I haven't streamed in a week.

309
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,200
I have this all built up.

310
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,620
Anyway, I was going to say, your friend just got out of a birthday party and now he's here playing Minecraft tournament?

311
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,880
Damn, what a griney.

312
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,100
We've gone from a birthday party to do this.

313
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:44,220
I'm commentating in his living room, he's in his studio playing right now, and then as soon as we're done, we're going back out.

314
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
We're going straight back out to the bar that our friends are at.

315
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,260
Oh, wait, so you're going to another party?

316
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,760
Yeah.

317
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,920
Wait, so the birthday party isn't even over?

318
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,100
Nope.

319
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,800
Wait, you should pre-game here.

320
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,620
Yeah, this is a break.

321
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,540
This is a break.

322
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,680
You should pre-game, grab some alcohol.

323
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,540
Oh, hey, that's us.

324
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,000
Wait, I can't believe it.

325
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,120
The party's not even over and your friend is here.

326
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,520
Dude, both of us have our priorities, right?

327
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,080
We have to go and see our friends.

328
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,020
We have to say, like, happy birthday, man.

329
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,500
But I'm going to be so honest with you, in two hours time, I'm leaving and we're going to go play Minecraft.

330
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,660
And then we'll come back.

331
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,220
It's okay.

332
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Oh my gosh.

333
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,080
Oh my gosh.

334
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
Wait, did you throw a Minecraft-themed birthday party?

335
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,840
Oh, dude, I wish.

336
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,700
Literally on branding.

337
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,200
It would have been so good.

338
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,400
As Minecrafters, you don't even throw a Minecraft party?

339
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,140
Like, what's the point?

340
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,380
Maybe we'll find the most Minecraft-y thing in his house and just take it.

341
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,340
Take it.

342
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,820
You could literally just go to Walmart and buy something.

343
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,220
Is there a Walmart in...

344
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,380
There is.

345
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,420
There is?

346
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,620
It's under a different name, yeah.

347
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,560
But, I mean, it is nearly...

348
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,880
It's like 9.30pm.

349
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,260
So, I think we're going to be...

350
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,260
I think most of the stores are closed.

351
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,220
I'm pretty sure Minecraft stuff is, like, everywhere, though.

352
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,140
You could literally go to a convenience store and find Minecraft, right?

353
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,940
There's bound to be a Minecraft t-shirt somewhere.

354
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,820
Yeah, like, I'm just going to say, like, there has to be Minecraft somewhere.

355
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,040
And you know what?

356
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:25,120
If your friend wins, you know, the prize money at first place is $25,000 for the whole team.

357
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,840
25k?

358
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,660
I think, you know, drinks would be on them, probably.

359
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,180
Oh, we're watching him right now.

360
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,180
This is the friend that I'm next to.

361
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,840
Should I run?

362
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,820
Should I run into his room?

363
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,180
Go, go, go!

364
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,500
Go, go, go!

365
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,790
Show up at his camp right now.

366
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,470
See if he's actually... if he's lying to us or not.

367
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,470
He could be like, I know this guy, and he actually doesn't know.

368
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,570
So my chat was like, dox yourself now.

369
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,050
Is this conflict of interest?

370
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,430
I did it, I did it.

371
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,390
Yeah, we did.

372
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,030
Yeah, we saw you, we saw you.

373
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,310
Yeah, our chat was like, oh my god, face reveal.

374
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,810
Is this a real British Captain Sparkles?

375
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,530
That's me, that's me.

376
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,930
Oh my god.

377
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,550
My chat was like, is that Captain Sparkles?

378
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,050
Why is this guy throwing like...

379
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,010
Captain Sparkles is like throwing...

380
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,650
what is he doing?

381
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,750
He's got like a little tail.

382
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,630
Oh my god, ERC sir, subscribe for two months.

383
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,550
Thanks for the subscription.

384
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,330
I think we're gonna be starting the game soon-ish.

385
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,070
Wait, how many teams are competing Mint?

386
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,610
That's a great question.

387
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,770
Okay, I'll take the answer if you need it.

388
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,210
We've got eight teams.

389
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,350
Yeah, that's what I meant.

390
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,650
We've got eight teams, and we split them off into two groups of four.

391
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,450
So those four will play against each other.

392
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,790
Between four players?

393
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,630
That's a lot.

394
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,290
There's five on each team though.

395
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,650
Five players on each team.

396
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:25,630
We have two groups of four teams, and they play against each other once, and we kind of get a seeding based on that.

397
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:31,850
So the top teams in the group will go onto a bracket, and the bottom teams will go onto a loser's bracket sort of thing.

398
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,210
And then we'll find out who comes first, second, third, fourth.

399
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,310
What we'll be doing is following the top teams the whole way through pretty much, as far as I know.

400
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,350
The back end staff are working hard to bring us the most interesting games as far as I know.

401
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,950
I'm sure they're not going to show us sixth place versus eighth place.

402
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,410
You know what I mean?

403
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,670
They're going to show us first and second.

404
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:02,110
But every team places they get a prize money, so that's nice.

405
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,310
It doesn't matter.

406
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,290
Even your last place, you get money in the end.

407
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,330
And then Minted already got paid, so we're fine.

408
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,250
Hey, we all know why you're here.

409
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:15,730
It's okay.

410
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,350
Don't worry.

411
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,310
I'm here for the games.

412
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,930
We're here also for the games, too.

414
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:23,850
Oh, yeah.

415
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,810
I'm here to watch the thrills.

416
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,590
Actually, I'm curious to know what MOBA Minecraft is like.

417
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,470
Yeah, me too, honestly.

418
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,290
I want to see how they actually run the whole thing.

419
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,150
I'm glad I don't have to play.

420
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:44,910
It's actually crazy how much you can customize Minecraft in general for random games and stuff.

421
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,890
Have you ever played anything other than vanilla?

422
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,670
Yeah, I have.

423
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,410
Like, separate game modes and stuff?

424
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,810
Special game modes?

425
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,370
I played Sonic the Hedgehog.

426
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,590
The official Sonic?

427
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,630
Yeah, I played the official Sonic.

428
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,050
I played the official Sonic.

429
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,630
I was thinking about, like, Bed Wars or stuff like that.

430
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,570
Or, like, what was it called?

431
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,090
The Minecraft Civilization.

432
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,710
Oh, my gosh.

433
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,110
Wait.

434
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,990
Fulham, would you jump for the beef?

435
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,390
Oh, my god.

436
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,550
I would jump.

437
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,750
I would 100% jump for the beef, and I would 100% miss and fall.

438
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,990
Dude, I...

439
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,390
Yeah, you're a professional.

440
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,750
Yeah, you're a professional.

441
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,190
I'm professionally bad.

442
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,710
Whoa, on stream?

443
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,250
It's okay.

444
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,550
If I bully myself, it means my chat can't bully me.

445
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,710
So, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of small.

446
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,330
No, they definitely can.

447
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,390
Encourages them.

448
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,790
You hear that, chat?

449
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,910
Everybody, listen up.

450
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,290
If I bully myself, you can't bully me.

451
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,450
They're like, oh, my god, finally, we can let it loose.

452
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,190
Oh, don't worry.

453
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,570
They already do.

454
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,730
They know who they are.

455
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,290
It's fine.

456
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,270
Oh, look, they're picking the characters.

457
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,210
Oh, my god, there's a rabbit boy?

458
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,990
Dude, that's awesome.

459
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,190
Did you see her?

460
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,490
She was like the green...

461
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:13,910
Oh, my god.

462
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,710
I see her.

463
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,270
I see her.

464
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:17,850
She's green.

465
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,530
Who the heck is the slimy... the bunny boy there?

466
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,170
Let me see.

467
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,390
Hold on, I have the characters pulled up.

468
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,330
Slime bag.

469
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,890
Guys, the reason why I'm not looking at it is because I only have one monitor, which is my laptop, so I can't tab.

470
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,310
I can't tab in and out.

471
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,890
Okay, you found it?

472
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,950
Yeah, rabbit person, well known for his movement speed.

473
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,770
Okay, the name is Banjax.

474
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,270
I don't know who Banjax is.

475
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,550
Okay, I was gonna be like rabbit person.

476
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,070
Rabbit person would be crazy though, you're right.

477
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:11,250
So they have like ultimate abilities and stuff like throughout the game.

478
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,330
And obviously it kind of depends on the person you choose.

479
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:18,590
And the rabbit has rabbit's foot, which means they get like quicker...

480
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,910
like they get speed, which is cool.

481
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,570
Oh!

482
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,630
And then their ultimate is bunny hop, which lets them like jump really high.

483
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,210
The lore?

484
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,170
Extremely impulsive and high energy.

485
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:40,770
Banjax is well known for tauntingly leaping around his allies before eagerly leaping into the battlefield, often before his allies are ready.

486
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,410
Thanks.

487
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,330
Thank you for that lore.

488
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,730
But what's his age?

489
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,170
27?

490
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,150
He's 27?

491
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:53,370
Yeah, like Uncle Slimehack gets his age and like profession and everything.

492
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,690
And then rabbit person is like he likes to jump.

493
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,270
I'm just a rabbit.

494
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,090
I mean, there's Daedra.

495
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,110
Daedra is 18... or 1,862 years old.

496
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:06,830
Okay, what... yeah.

497
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,170
And what else about him?

498
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,850
I like how someone's like, is he single though?

499
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,630
Calm down, you guys.

500
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,370
That should be in the lore.

501
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,730
That should be in the lore.

502
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,070
Actually, there should be like a relationship.

503
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,570
Taken, it's complicated.

504
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,150
We gotta know.

506
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,850
Two of these people are children of like one another.

507
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,430
One of them is the child of one, right?

508
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,950
Wait, really?

509
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,610
Which one?

510
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,550
Angel and Axel.

511
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,470
So Angel is the child of Axel.

512
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,270
Are they both angels?

513
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,190
So one of them is a DPS and one of them is a healer.

514
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,330
The healer is the kid of the DPS.

515
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:42,890
Oh no.

516
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,410
Angel's a minotaur.

517
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:46,550
Oh.

518
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,150
Wait, is Angel the child or the...

519
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,950
Well, they're both minotaurs, yeah, look.

520
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,770
Less intimidating minotaur.

521
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,790
The less intimidating one is the child, according to the synopsis.

522
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,510
Which one is it?

523
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:08,730
Okay, but Daedra is a cowgirl demon, so I think that is relative.

524
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,490
Oh!

525
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,710
I think we might be starting.

526
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,450
Are we starting?

527
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,110
Oh my gosh.

528
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,110
Oh I see it.

529
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,230
One is a white cow, the other one is a brown cow.

530
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,570
Brown cow.

531
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,230
Yeah, see look at the left.

532
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,110
Oh I see.

533
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,390
No one is playing slimehag.

534
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,750
No one is playing slimehag.

535
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:28,730
Dude.

536
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,450
There is already a meta.

537
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,850
In MCL there is already a meta.

538
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,690
There is already a meta This game just started!

539
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,250
They've done this before, apparently they've added new characters and so that's the new tournament.

540
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:51,490
I thought it was like they were playing this for the very first time, but I guess like they've trained for it and everything.

541
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,590
I think that there's like new maps and new characters, but this is a recurring thing, yeah.

542
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,170
Look, they're going around, they're killing the mobs, getting their money.

543
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,810
Guys, you can play MOBA League right now.

544
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,090
Kill that bat, kill that bat.

545
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,490
Oh, never mind, not enough money.

546
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,930
I was going to say MOBA craft, I was going to say league is already MOBA.

547
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,430
MOBA craft is good, I like that.

548
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,270
MOBA craft is great, yeah.

549
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,170
Oh wait, that's the nexus, the dragon.

550
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

551
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:26,090
So we're seeing these guys click very quickly and that is because we're using a combat system that's well known to be in an older version of Minecraft.

552
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,090
So, you guys have played Minecraft recently, right?

553
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:37,930
If you swing at a mob or whatever, you have to wait between your swings to charge them back up.

554
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:45,870
Back when Minecraft was a little bit in its earlier days, you can just click as much as you want and that's what we're using in this version.

555
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,470
You can see that CBK is just spam clicking away and gets the kill there.

556
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,950
Oh wait, someone died already.

557
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,030
Who died?

558
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,850
There is a respawn timer.

559
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,230
There is a respawn timer.

560
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,470
The more they die, the higher it gets.

561
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:04,470
So, at first it's 10 seconds and then when they respawn it'll be...

562
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,370
15 seconds, whatever.

563
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,290
Wait, is CaptainSparklez's team winning with that first kill?

564
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,450
That first kill might be helpful.

565
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:17,270
I actually don't know how beneficial a kill is really early on because look at the bottom of CaptainSparklez's screen.

566
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,190
We've got coins and mana, I think.

567
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,850
I think that's mana.

568
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,670
I'm not sure.

569
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,810
But then they end up spending these things on these upgrades.

570
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,390
Oh my god, there's a piggy bank!

571
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,490
Get your money, CaptainSparklez!

572
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,230
Get your money!

573
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,110
Come on, go get rich!

574
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,250
Look at him go!

575
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,610
Look at him farm the creep!

576
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,030
The best pirate bot in every MOBA.

577
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,530
I wonder if there's any secrets and stuff that you can find.

578
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,130
Big mobs for big money.

579
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:56,070
You can get inside a building or something and hit some crazy clip into a wall.

580
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,610
That's what I'd be looking for right now.

581
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,770
Make an invincible jump.

582
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,170
Exploring the map instead of doing the objective?

583
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,170
That's crazy.

584
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:07,650
Oh, we gotta fight!

585
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,390
Oh, they're fighting!

586
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,690
He was just dodging!

587
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,330
Oh no, it's one against two.

588
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,110
He was not gonna win that.

589
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,550
He got cornered.

590
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,870
That's one to one.

591
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,130
Looks like one kill each, right?

592
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,770
Oh, but there is another death on the other team.

593
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,850
Maybe we missed the death there.

594
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,270
I mean, it's very early on in the game.

595
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:30,270
I don't wanna make any predictions here.

596
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,690
I was gonna be like, oh, there's still three minutes left of the game.

597
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,750
I was like, that's a short game.

598
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,850
I realized I was counting up.

599
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,290
I was gonna be like, there's three minutes left?

600
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:39,950
That's crazy!

601
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,770
Are all these games going on simultaneously or is it like...

602
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:46,850
Yeah, exactly.

603
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:53,750
So we have like four games running at the same time and right now we're gonna watch one.

604
00:47:54,170 --> 00:48:01,490
I think it's definitely, in my opinion, probably two of the best teams out of the group facing off against each other.

605
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:02,530
Wait, really?

606
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,990
Which team has Feinberg?

607
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,810
How do we know Feinberg?

608
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,130
Hello?

609
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,050
Cause I saw you was in the game.

610
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,810
How do you guys know Feinberg?

611
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,410
Well, I know Feinberg.

612
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,110
Oh, I don't know.

613
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:26,370
I had him on my team before and everybody was like, Feinberg has one of the top, the most records for any Minecraft tournament.

614
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,650
He's a good friend of mine and I love that everyone knows him.

615
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,430
He is a really, really lovely guy.

616
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,170
Is he that good of a friend?

617
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,010
Would he lend you $100?

618
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,890
Yeah, would he lend you $100?

619
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:47,470
If you were dangling from the cliff and then like, he had to he was in the middle of completing a number one Minecraft record, would he let you die or save you?

620
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,390
It's like if he completes the record, he'll be like number one in the world or he saves you.

621
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,830
Would he let you die?

622
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,410
I think he might save me because he's already number one.

623
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,950
He might save you.

624
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:04,670
There's definitely a might.

625
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,130
There's definitely like a 50-50 there.

626
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,930
I have to get lucky.

627
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,810
It's not even like 80 or 90.

628
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,170
Oh no, no, no.

629
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,190
Definitely 50-50.

630
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,970
It really depends because if everything's going right and that's the run, he's not looking away.

631
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,530
He's not looking away.

632
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,930
Even when you're like screaming at him.

633
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,270
100%.

634
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,970
He's totally locked in if that's the case.

635
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,390
Oh, they backed off for now.

636
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:34,110
Tactical retreat.

637
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,190
How long do these games usually last for?

638
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,310
Now that is a question I won't be able to tell you.

639
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,150
I think it's probably around 20 minutes, maybe 25 minutes.

640
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,750
That's like half of a League game.

641
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:45,990
That's already better than League.

642
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,850
People get to kill there.

643
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,270
So it does say...

644
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,750
But then dies in the retake.

645
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,630
Yeah, I mean like...

646
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,510
He was already low.

647
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,170
Oh, the Minecraft music popped in.

648
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,010
That scared me.

649
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:00,830
We're so chill.

650
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,270
It becomes so much more relaxed.

651
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,370
Even though we see all these people fighting.

652
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,990
They're all dying to each other.

653
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,950
But look at this Minecraft music.

654
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,130
It's almost like piano jump scare.

655
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,610
Now, something that's really interesting.

656
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,910
I think like...

657
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,730
CaptainSparklez right now isn't spending his cash, right?

658
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,990
He's got 350 bucks just sitting there.

659
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,190
And I think you can spend those on upgrades for like the team.

660
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:34,490
Oh, is this like the mid boss?

661
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,070
It might well be.

662
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,070
It looks like it's towards the middle of the map.

663
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,370
I guess this is going to give one team a huge advantage.

664
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,510
It looks like Red is taking it out.

665
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,070
It's right smack dab in the middle.

666
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,190
I wonder if the mid boss regens.

667
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:51,350
Because I know like in Deadlock the mid boss regens if you don't hit it hit it again.

668
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:55,750
Oh dude, look at the... It's got a different texture in the game.

669
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,050
Oh no!

670
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,690
Yeah, wait, why does that team have a different texture for their stats?

671
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,330
It shows up as a pot of gold for the other people.

672
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,230
It kind of makes sense.

673
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,630
Yeah, I was going to be like, wait, that's weird.

674
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,670
I guess like the different teams, it looks different.

675
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:13,770
Maybe so.

676
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,330
I mean, oh my god, they're so close to...

677
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,650
Wait, the Nexus is so close.

678
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,290
The Ender Dragon is so close to them.

679
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,090
I didn't realize it was that close.

680
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,530
Look out below!

681
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:27,510
Look out below!

682
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:29,910
Oh!

683
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,430
Oh my god!

684
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,710
Oh my god!

685
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:32,450
Oh wow!

686
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,910
Oh wow, and it's dead!

687
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:44,030
It looks like Team Red was able to kill that, so I think that's CaptainSparklez's team was able to get whatever bonus you get.

688
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,370
I assume not some coins or some mana though.

689
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,550
It should be money because it's pot of gold.

690
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,270
Look out below!

691
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:56,020
I was like, what the heck was that?

692
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,400
What's going on here when they go into the wall?

693
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,660
I think they were just healing.

694
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,580
They were trying to hide and heal.

695
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,860
It looks like maybe that's a sudden death timer right underneath.

696
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,020
That's counting down here.

697
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,040
Sudden death?

698
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,260
Oh my god.

699
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,520
Dates are high!

700
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,300
The 20 minutes was probably a pretty good guess.

701
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,180
I think it's around about 20 minutes estimated.

702
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:25,320
Yeah, so I guess if they don't win the game within 20 minutes, it's like you just have one life left.

703
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,560
It does say that the matches have a 40 minute timer.

704
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,540
Oh, 40?

705
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,480
Well, we are a tiny bit behind schedule.

706
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,560
So maybe there's like a...

707
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,220
Maybe they're just like, nope, nevermind.

708
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,680
Oh!

709
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,760
It could be the slime respawn timer.

710
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,180
Oh, maybe.

711
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,640
Oh, possibly.

712
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,020
But it looks like a little skull.

713
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,000
That's true.

714
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,200
I mean, it does look... yeah.

715
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,500
Looks more ominous.

716
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,700
Yeah, we'll see in 9 minutes what it really is.

717
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,600
Someone go straight to the dragon.

718
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,740
No one's protecting it.

719
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,960
What if they just flank and just go straight there?

720
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,260
I'm sure these guys are screaming at each other in coal.

721
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,460
Going like, oh, we need to go left!

722
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,300
We need to go right!

723
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,160
We need to do this!

724
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:20,260
Each dragon does have the withers protecting it too, though.

725
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,200
That's true.

726
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,500
One person, I think, would be kind of...

727
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,380
We'll die.

728
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,880
That guy's so low.

729
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,200
His HP is so low right now.

730
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:29,760
Heal!

731
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,240
Heal!

732
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:30,780
Heal!

733
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,760
Oh, you can recall and go straight home.

734
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,820
That's smart.

735
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,100
That must be what they're doing then.

736
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,380
Yeah, so you can go back and buy items and heal and stuff.

737
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:40,960
Interesting.

738
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,660
And you can always protect yourself as well and just get out of situations.

739
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,880
I hope we get to watch someone play slime hag.

740
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,540
I just want to see slime hag.

741
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,060
Justice for slime hag.

742
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,480
Make her a meta.

743
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,880
Make her a meta again.

744
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,240
Again?

745
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,640
As if she were before.

746
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,700
Looks like Shatter is close to the red base here and he's getting a few kills.

747
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,660
He's got two kills here.

748
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,400
That was a good advancement.

749
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,680
I think that's like the first damage we've seen on any of the withers on the outside.

750
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,480
Oh wait, they shot the wither?

751
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,520
She was so far.

752
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,540
I think it might have literally been one hit.

753
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,400
So I don't think it matters that much.

754
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,380
But it's more than the other team have done so far.

755
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,220
The one hit wonder.

756
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,740
As long as the other team never touches the wither, they win.

757
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,700
Yeah, real.

758
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,100
It's just that easy.

759
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,400
Yeah, pretty much.

760
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,580
Oh my god.

761
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,660
Oh my god, it's a giant team fight right now.

762
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,220
What the heck was that?

763
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,800
Was that an ultimate line again?

764
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,460
Oh my gosh, look at the iron golem.

765
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,800
He's like...

766
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,080
Oh my god, look at them all advance.

767
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,300
There's four of the red team.

768
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,340
Four of the red team are pushing in right now.

769
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh my god, they're going in.

770
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,600
They're going in.

771
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,240
The withers are fighting back.

772
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,660
So much of ASMR jumpscares.

773
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:11,680
I know.

774
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,480
Oh my god.

775
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,000
You want to play right now.

776
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,440
Wait, maybe that's the mom.

777
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,100
Wasn't there like a mom character here or a child?

778
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,420
That was blue's team, right?

779
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,240
That went in?

780
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,400
Yeah, no.

781
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,860
Red went in, but blue just defended their base.

782
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,040
You can see at the top, they've got health bars.

783
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,620
And the wither for blue is already at half health.

784
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:47,540
So if red go back in, that could be a big exploit for red team.

785
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,080
But the blue team did get a little bit of damage on the red wither as well.

786
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,300
And blue don't have to respawn now because it looks like red are on the defense.

787
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,580
Thank god for our Minecraft analysis, guys.

788
00:55:59,660 --> 00:55:59,980
I know.

789
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,020
I would have definitely not registered on any of that.

790
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,220
I like the just pit a fire.

791
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,080
You can spawn there.

792
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,580
Oh, good shot!

793
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,380
That was such a good shot!

794
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,920
That was, yeah.

795
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,000
What a shot from that guy.

796
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,540
Whoever that guy was.

797
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,020
Oh, we got the Minecraft music back.

798
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,320
Thank you.

799
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,500
Oh, wait, they're back!

800
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,460
Red tower under attack!

801
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,860
Oh my god, wait.

802
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,520
They're doing big damage on that wither.

803
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,820
Yeah, that one wither.

804
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,020
They did protect it, but that one is low now.

805
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,100
Oh yeah, they have to retreat because all of them are coming back now.

806
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,320
This Minecraft music makes it so much more dramatic.

807
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,160
It's like calming me down.

808
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,860
What even are those blocks?

809
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,120
Those red blocks?

810
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:58,660
Those are spawns, so they're spawning like little mobs that they can attack for money and stuff.

811
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,280
I'm learning, see?

812
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,680
I'm learning as we go.

813
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,240
I think if we were in this I think we'd be winning, just saying.

814
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,020
I think so too, 100%.

815
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:16,860
As long as they give us like, you know, plus 500% HP and like plus 100% damage, yeah, we'd definitely win this.

816
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,800
I need like the wither skull effect where if you...

817
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,720
If I tap them once they lose all their heart.

818
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,320
Just make us giant ender dragons too and we can fly.

819
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

820
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,020
You know, the caster buff right there.

821
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,420
Give me a card.

822
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,300
Give me a card and run people over.

823
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,540
That should be the final match.

824
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,120
The final team has to defeat the casters to win my game.

825
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,600
Whoa, the voice said red tower under attack.

826
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,140
Oh my god, the red tower's HP is gone.

827
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:53,840
First wither down!

828
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,560
Wait, why are we watching the fight?

829
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,700
We can't see it, please show us the face.

830
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,400
Show us the face.

831
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,760
Oh, okay, red was able to defend it.

832
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,820
Oh, now they're running away.

833
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,140
But the wither's down, so they're down to the crystal now.

834
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,840
No, they still have two more withers.

835
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,780
Yeah, they still have two more.

836
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,900
Everybody has three.

837
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,120
Do you have to kill all of the withers before you can go to the crystal?

838
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,940
I believe so.

839
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,440
I guess the crystals are closest to the wither, you know?

840
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,320
If you're trying to get for the other crystal.

841
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,920
I assume each wither is guarding their own crystal.

842
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,420
Yeah.

843
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,200
Oh my god, this one guy, he's like, let me solo him.

844
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,180
That one guy's just soloing.

845
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,220
He's almost got the wither down.

846
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,000
He's got it!

847
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,240
Where's his team?

848
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,040
Where's the team?

849
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,420
They just let him solo it.

850
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,340
His team are all dead, it looks like.

851
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:57,520
Red really pushed up on the blue crystals, but he was just left on his own.

852
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,620
He was able to solo out a whole wither.

853
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,340
Tactical retreat.

854
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,140
Getting the shots.

855
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,480
Now, Shatt is well known to be a really strong PvPer, so...

856
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,000
But, he's able to be taken down by two.

857
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:10,800
That helps.

858
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,520
No matter how good you are, 1v2.

859
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,360
1v1 him!

860
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,200
That's not fair!

861
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,300
Where is the integrity here?

862
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,480
He had performance anxiety.

863
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,460
He knew he was on the screen.

864
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,000
They got one guy.

865
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,420
All of team blue have their ults pretty much.

866
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,400
They are all fully charged pretty much.

867
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,540
They are trying to go back in.

868
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,420
They are trying to go back in.

869
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,880
I think if they did like a charged attack...

870
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,200
Oh!

871
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,060
Oh!

872
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,800
Oh my god!

873
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,640
Who gets the kill?

874
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,560
I think one more wither.

875
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,780
They could push.

876
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,840
Just sneak in like that other guy.

877
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:09,080
I feel like I'm going to have to heavy defend now though, because they are so behind of everything.

878
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,960
Dude, he's pushing again.

879
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,600
Shatt is the only one at the base.

880
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,600
He's able to get more damage.

881
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:14,900
Look!

882
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,500
He's the only one here.

883
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,440
Okay, now he's being defended.

884
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,880
These guys got to watch out.

885
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,880
He already got like one third.

886
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,080
He already got a little bit of it.

887
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,500
Oh my god, they let him live?

888
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,580
He just runs away.

889
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,400
They just let him run away?

890
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,780
I like how people are like, why is Mint blue in color instead of mint?

891
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,420
This is her.

892
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,260
When she plays Minecraft, she turns blue.

893
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,820
This is me locked in.

894
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:42,680
Yeah.

895
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:42,820
Yeah.

896
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,640
It's like, what flavor of mint are you right now?

897
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:48,860
I'm...

898
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:51,920
Winter...no.

899
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,320
Winter Breeze!

900
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,300
Spearmint?

901
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,380
No, that's too green.

902
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,700
Wait, they already got the crystal!

903
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,240
Oh my god!

904
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,180
Dude, look at all the blue teams!

905
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,700
Look at blue team's health as well!

906
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,160
I think that's final death.

907
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,720
I think that's like the final.

908
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,140
When it gets like close to the end time.

909
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,660
Maybe, maybe that'll start taking more and more damage.

910
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,160
Maybe.

911
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,760
Yeah, they lowered the health.

912
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,580
I'm going to go shop real quick.

913
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,520
In the middle of a fight?

914
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,140
Quick intermission.

915
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,860
Blue crystal eliminated.

916
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,040
Wait, that's...

917
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,520
Oh my god, wait, they're going to blue...

918
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,900
Red team's going to win because of the timer.

919
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,340
It says alive though.

920
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:57,360
Yeah, but like because like the timer going down all the crystals and wither took damage, so like red has like an advantage there.

921
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,720
Oh, the pot of gold is back again.

922
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,320
Yeah, if you don't get it done in time.

923
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:05,960
Yeah.

924
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:13,220
Because it's like blue team worked so hard lowering red, like actually no, not blue team, that one guy worked so hard.

925
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,460
That's true, that's true.

926
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,200
There's a monkey in the tree!

927
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,240
Get him out of the tree!

928
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,340
Red tower is under attack.

929
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,720
Not the monkey!

930
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,640
What's he doing?

931
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,200
Where's his family?

932
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,340
Help him!

933
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,260
Red tower is gone.

934
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,300
There's only two crystals left for red.

935
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,160
There's only two crystals.

936
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,940
And they're really low, I think.

937
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,940
Red crystal dead.

938
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:41,780
There's only one left.

939
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,480
And the dragon!

940
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,920
Blue are going to take the win here and we're not going to be able to see it.

941
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:48,940
But it's just one guy.

942
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,140
It's just one guy!

943
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,100
It is!

944
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,660
It's just one guy!

945
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,340
They defended it just.

946
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,440
Just one guy!

947
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,110
They're all one guy!

948
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,610
Their main tower is on like 30% health.

949
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:07,290
This is...

950
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,350
Red team needs something crazy here.

951
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,910
They literally just have to send one guy over it.

952
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:19,120
They have two members down too.

953
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,760
So it's like...

954
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,200
That's true.

955
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,200
How did that one guy kill two?

956
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:24,760
There it is!

957
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,020
Two!

958
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:28,840
One guy!

959
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,020
Anna's team takes the win!

960
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,860
Being honest, it pretty much was a one man mission there for Shata.

961
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,560
He was able to take out so many towers and crystals.

962
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:39,480
That's crazy.

963
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,020
He actually took down the dragon himself too.

964
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,060
MVP.

965
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,400
MVP one guy.

966
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,280
That's crazy.

967
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,820
The fact that like...

968
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,340
Almost like...

969
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:02,300
Three people from Kat and Sparkle's team had to defend themselves against that guy.

970
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,540
That's crazy to see.

971
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,160
I know that he's a super strong player but...

972
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,620
I'm surprised he was able to do that much.

973
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:11,980
Because these guys...

974
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,840
Red's no slouch team here.

975
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,100
I'm not expecting them to get completely whupped.

976
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,800
The middle pot of gold, right?

977
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,340
Yeah, Red team won the pot of gold and everything.

978
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,440
Wait, who was the one guy?

979
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,120
Was it Shata?

980
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,660
Shata, yeah, in the bottom right.

981
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,520
Was it Rabbit Boy?

982
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,360
It's Rabbit Boy!

983
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,340
He was so fast.

984
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,220
Maybe it is.

985
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,040
Look, he's able to just jump around really quick.

986
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,860
Look down below!

987
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,380
Oh my god, there he is.

988
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,240
There's their team.

989
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,920
There we go.

990
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,620
I honestly thought Red could make a really good comeback.

991
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,060
Especially when they got all of that damage from the team.

992
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,980
At one point, it was really any person's game.

993
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,200
They started with the damage too.

994
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,320
They started really well.

995
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,960
Yeah, they got the first one but...

996
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,280
Literally, Shata was able to take out a whole crystal on his own.

997
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,760
I don't know how.

998
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,280
He took down two withers and a crystal.

999
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,300
And I think the dragon too.

1000
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,580
For real, right?

1001
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,780
There was just one person on the dragon for real.

1002
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,160
He took down the majority of the dragon.

1003
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,620
And he let him live.

1004
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,640
I was so surprised.

1005
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,860
He just ran away.

1006
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,100
I was like, whoa, okay.

1007
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,080
These replays are really sick, actually.

1008
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,580
I'm so glad that we're able to see these back really quickly.

1009
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:37,840
I know that's difficult.

1010
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,660
Oh, there he is!

1011
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,580
They killed him!

1012
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:40,800
There he is, bang!

1013
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,840
He literally killed him before his final breath!

1014
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,780
Did you see that?

1015
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,400
He killed the dragon before he died!

1016
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,400
Oh my god.

1017
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,360
What a hero.

1018
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,280
What a hero.

1019
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,740
That was crazy.

1020
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,420
That was a crazy first game to watch.

1021
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,520
Our next game up...

1022
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,660
I think we still have one match going.

1023
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,560
Which is...

1024
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,840
Team 5UP and Team BTMC.

1025
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,960
So we're just waiting on their match.

1026
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,160
We're waiting on the final teams before we can watch the next game.

1027
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,080
Next game is like...

1028
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,440
Waste of Horse?

1029
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,740
Dude, I'm not trying to pronounce that.

1030
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,040
You guys try it.

1031
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,640
How is there an H and an R next to each other?

1032
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,120
How does that even sound?

1033
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:31,960
Waste of Horse.

1034
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,020
Like Hoff from Star Wars with an R.

1035
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,160
Oh, like Hoff from Star Wars.

1036
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,300
Like Hoff from Star Wars Harf.

1037
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:43,200
Harf.

1038
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,340
How about we just call it Waste?

1039
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,500
That's a better idea, right?

1040
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,800
The Waste.

1041
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,540
So we got Team Hannah winning.

1042
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,480
Well, we saw that one.

1043
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:07,160
We had Team S Major win round 1 and Team Small Ant win...

1044
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,940
Oh, Small Ant!

1045
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,220
I didn't watch him too!

1046
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,200
I was going to say, you guys might know Small Ant.

1047
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,060
Small Ant's the team with...

1048
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,960
Small Ant's the team with Feinberg.

1049
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,620
You guys got there.

1050
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,480
Yeah, I do!

1051
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,160
Actually, all the time.

1052
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,420
Well, we know which team Mint's going to cheer for.

1053
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,680
Hey, it's the one with Feinberg on as well.

1054
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,200
So that's the one you're cheering for too.

1055
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh, it's the Feinberg team!

1056
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,180
Yeah!

1057
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,840
Well, next round we have Team Snifferish vs.

1058
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:41,700
Team Hannah.

1059
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,520
Team Sparkles vs.

1060
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,780
Team S Major.

1061
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,540
Team Small Ant vs.

1062
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,900
Team BTMC.

1063
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,820
And Team Five Up vs.

1064
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,440
Team Shubble.

1065
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,580
Can we request which team we want to watch?

1066
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,060
Let's just watch Team Small Ant.

1067
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,300
Yeah, can we please?

1068
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,060
Yeah, can we watch Small Ant?

1069
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,960
Look, I think they're going to make it to the final.

1070
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,500
So I think we will definitely see him at least once.

1071
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,560
We think that's...

1072
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,420
Yeah, it's going to be such a good game.

1073
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,120
When I spectate someone though, they end up losing.

1074
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,120
So I don't know.

1075
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,520
Then we definitely should spectate Small Ant.

1076
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,100
You're a jinx?

1077
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,560
Yeah, I'm a bit of a jinx.

1078
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,260
Alright, let's do it.

1079
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,640
I'm doing my job of doing the analysis thing.

1080
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:24,160
Right?

1081
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:31,300
So all of the other teams that played each other, the team that got more kills usually took out the dragon and won the game.

1082
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:38,040
But in the game that we watched, the red team got more kills but then lost to the blue team.

1083
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:46,220
So it was like, I don't know, maybe it was like a strategy difference that maybe Team Red were just trying to kill too much and then wasn't focusing on the towers.

1084
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,160
The blue team kind of held on to their ults for a long time.

1085
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,360
True, yeah, you're right.

1086
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,600
So maybe they more strategically used them to their advantage.

1087
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,160
I think Team Red just might have got more kills, but they just don't look for flankers.

1088
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:05,200
Because literally, they got that one guy sneaked in three or four different times.

1089
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:11,660
And you know, you would think that after the second time, they learned from it, but then he just kept doing it.

1090
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,660
Dude, they gotta have one guy on defense.

1091
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,100
You need one person to stay back.

1092
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,700
No, just maybe two.

1093
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,260
Maybe two, right?

1094
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,200
I think they had one guy on defense and then he dies to the other guy.

1095
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,700
Right, they lose the 1v1.

1096
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,640
Yeah, they lost the 1v1 and they're like, whoops, okay, that's my bad.

1097
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,680
It just kept happening several times.

1098
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,500
I think that's the reason why they lost.

1099
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,440
Match 4 has their winner.

1100
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,840
The winner was Team 5up.

1101
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,160
Alright, how many matches are there in total again?

1102
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:55,060
There's four matches going on at a time and there's five rounds.

1103
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,540
So guys, there's still three more.

1104
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,860
Wait, does that include the finals?

1105
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,800
So yeah, there's four more to go, right?

1106
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,360
We gotta watch four more, I think.

1107
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,140
Yeah, but does that include the finals or is it the rounds for qualifying?

1108
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:14,380
We got three group stage matches and then two, like a semi-final and a final.

1109
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,980
There's two more group stages and then semis and then finals.

1110
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,000
Yeah, okay.

1111
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,780
Just for the people in chat, I totally knew that.

1112
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,480
You were testing me.

1113
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,500
I just wanted to ask these questions for chat.

1114
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,500
I'm pretty sure they were curious about it too.

1115
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:37,120
I just think Fulham is more articulate with how he can say the answers.

1116
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,860
It's like a test.

1117
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:39,900
We're testing him.

1118
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,700
I'm here to be chat's representative.

1119
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,760
I'm role-playing as chat, you know.

1120
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,060
I'm asking the questions that they want to ask.

1121
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:49,920
Oh yeah.

1122
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,520
Chat, do you have any questions?

1123
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,280
Yeah, if you have any questions, I'll ask them for you guys.

1124
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,940
They're asking, why is Mint blue?

1125
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,420
I told you, she's Winter Breeze Mint.

1126
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,420
I'm Arctic Mint.

1127
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,260
Oh yeah, it's like arctic foxes, where during the winter they change color.

1128
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,640
Yeah, so they change color to white, but instead you change to blue.

1129
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,640
I'm just a little...

1130
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,820
Yeah, I'm a little shrunk today.

1131
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:18,640
Yeah.

1132
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,220
We're just waiting, guys.

1133
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,840
We're just waiting for the next game right now.

1134
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,800
And after that...

1135
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,340
After that, we're gonna be gaming again.

1136
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,860
I wonder what the next place is like.

1137
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:36,580
We're gonna watch Small Ant.

1138
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,220
Who's Small Ant playing against?

1139
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,560
BTMC, right?

1140
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,440
Yes, BTMC.

1141
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,720
Alright.

1142
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,660
Oh, there they are.

1143
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:46,760
That's your favorite!

1144
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,140
That's my Oshie!

1145
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,100
That's your Minecraft Oshie!

1146
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,520
That's my Minecraft Oshie!

1147
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,540
Why couldn't that be me?

1148
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,600
You should've been me!

1149
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:03,900
Alright.

1150
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,760
Dude, I have too much insight about most of the people on this team.

1151
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:14,860
I am, like, very good friends with four-fifths of these people.

1152
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,320
Moony is the only person I don't know.

1153
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:21,120
I think Moony's a VTuber as well.

1154
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,480
I'm not in the scene hugely.

1155
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,120
I have played Minecraft once with Moony, though, and she was very cool.

1156
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,340
So, we have Feinberg, who's like the guy, right?

1157
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,740
The one guy that's really quick and really fast and cool.

1158
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,860
Right?

1159
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:49,200
But, if I tell you that Silver, the guy with the dog as the profile picture, when I tell you he's better than Feinberg is...

1160
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,540
Is that a hot take?

1161
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,740
Is that a hot take?

1162
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,180
Maybe I'm getting cancelled on Twitter right now.

1163
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,480
Drama!

1164
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,700
I'm gonna get called out, like, Oh, I prefer this friend to this friend.

1165
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,350
I think Silver's a bit of a hidden gem.

1166
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,010
You know what I mean?

1167
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:18,170
I think Silver's a little bit of a... He's underground right now.

1168
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,710
Oh, he's an up-and-comer.

1169
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,750
Exactly.

1170
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,790
Oh, look at this map.

1171
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:29,390
So, he's just starting to get more and more records, right?

1172
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:30,430
Oh, dude, yeah.

1173
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:33,830
He's quicker than Feinberg is, bro.

1174
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:37,750
I'm telling you that is a factor right now.

1175
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:46,790
The opinions stated here do not reflect all of the co-captains in Doki Blade.

1176
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:50,370
Minecraft fans, chill.

1177
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,770
We don't know much about the community.

1178
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:53,410
Just blame me.

1179
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:53,870
It's okay.

1180
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,450
It's okay.

1181
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:55,710
You can keep blaming me.

1182
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:02,130
So, it looks like there's some spawns down inside the crevice.

1183
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,050
This is so cool.

1184
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,930
It's like a two-tiered map.

1185
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,910
You've got the top level which has the three lanes.

1186
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,710
I mean, it's more open.

1187
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,550
You're gonna struggle to...

1188
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,590
You're gonna struggle to get one manned like the other team did.

1189
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,790
There's no secret path through a building or whatever like before.

1190
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,550
Jump!

1191
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:28,710
Jump!

1192
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,670
Do they take damage if they fall?

1193
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,310
No!

1194
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,770
Oh my god, they're fine.

1195
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,610
See, there is a bottom pathway.

1196
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:37,910
They can get one guy.

1197
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,870
There's literally one guy at the bottom right now.

1198
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:41,150
There is.

1199
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:44,070
There's one red team that's just like running from the bottom.

1200
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:50,330
Oh, that must be the pot of gold.

1201
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,530
No, it's gum-gum.

1202
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:53,770
Why is it called gum-gum?

1203
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:55,390
What does that mean?

1204
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,350
Oh my god, it's gum-gum!

1205
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:58,650
It's gum-gum, obviously!

1206
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,570
Oh, my fault, my fault.

1207
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,350
Sorry, sorry.

1208
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,090
I should know.

1209
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:04,250
It's gum-gum?

1210
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,390
Sorry, sorry.

1211
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:06,790
I completely forgot.

1212
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:10,830
Like, duh, of course.

1213
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,110
It's gum-gum.

1214
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:14,710
First name, gum.

1215
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:16,510
Second name, gum.

1216
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:23,510
We were told by staff that it's gum-gum pistol but I don't think that explains anything.

1217
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,030
Is it really?

1218
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,690
That's One Piece, isn't that?

1219
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,670
Oh, I'm making One Piece.

1220
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:43,490
Yeah, I was gonna say man, oh my god, how are you an otaku and you don't know anything about One Piece?

1221
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,350
I know the One Piece.

1222
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:50,870
I can't believe it.

1223
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:54,330
You're more of an anime fan than me and you didn't know about gum-gum pistol?

1224
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:55,550
No?

1225
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,490
Well, um...

1226
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,170
Take my card.

1227
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:58,730
Here you go.

1228
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,270
Here's my otaku card.

1229
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:01,730
It's yours now.

1230
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:04,490
You can have it.

1231
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:05,210
I don't care.

1232
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:05,610
Whatever.

1233
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,370
She doesn't care about you guys yet.

1234
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:08,830
Wow.

1235
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,830
How is that even real?

1236
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:13,730
She hates you.

1237
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,090
She doesn't care about the otakus.

1238
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:17,230
One Piece is just not moe enough for me.

1239
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,450
She doesn't care about anime anymore.

1240
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,530
I used to be an otaku.

1241
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:28,090
The blue myth is so mean.

1242
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:35,230
The more blue she becomes, the more normie she is.

1243
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,590
That's a scary thought.

1244
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:41,210
Aw, the little axolotls are so cute.

1245
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:46,350
Oh my god, wait, they gotta kill it for creep!

1246
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:47,310
That's a creep!

1247
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,570
How many people have fallen into the...

1248
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:51,150
The hole?

1249
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:51,890
Yeah.

1250
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,550
I don't know how they get back up.

1251
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:58,330
Where's the path back to the top?

1252
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,350
There's a staircase on each side.

1253
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:01,330
Oh, okay.

1254
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,350
So there is a way to get out from the bottom.

1255
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,290
Okay, I just said Silver runs that you are better, so you better not die here.

1256
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:08,710
Oh, and he died.

1257
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:09,890
Aww.

1258
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:11,430
I'm telling ya.

1259
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,550
I think I'm a hater, man.

1260
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:15,790
I think I'm just a big hater.

1261
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,690
Wait, which team is...

1262
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:21,830
Is he also on Small Ant's team?

1263
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,530
Yeah, he's on the Small Ant Feinberg team.

1264
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,050
Well, let's see who's gonna do more...

1265
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,070
make more contributions.

1266
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,450
Feinberg or Silver?

1267
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:30,070
True.

1268
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,710
We're gonna find out who's the MVP.

1269
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,450
Who's gonna be the MVP here?

1270
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:37,950
There's so many legs.

1271
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,970
The hoglins have cool little mohawks.

1272
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,430
Rainbow mohawks.

1273
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:42,550
That's so cool.

1274
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:44,490
How do you see that?

1275
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,590
Yeah, dude, next time you'll notice it now.

1276
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,670
Look, the pig in the background.

1277
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:52,270
Oh my god, he does.

1278
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,130
He has a little rainbow mohawk.

1279
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,490
That's cute.

1280
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:58,250
Oh, wow.

1281
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:00,350
Are they going for Gum Gum?

1282
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,550
No, Gum Gum!

1283
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:04,070
Oh, wait.

1284
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,290
No, they're avoiding Gum Gum.

1285
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,210
They don't need Gum Gum.

1286
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,790
I thought they were gonna go solo the...

1287
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:12,930
Oh, Blue Tower under attack.

1288
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:14,770
Red are pushing.

1289
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,210
Red are pushing and killing Blue's tower.

1290
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:17,930
Yeah, where the heck is Blue Tower?

1291
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,350
Yeah, I kinda can't tell which tower is which.

1292
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,610
Yeah, I don't know which color is which.

1293
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:26,010
There's Feinberg.

1294
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,730
Gotta kill and he's just farming this spawner over here.

1295
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,030
Getting as much coins as he can.

1296
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,470
Getting as much upgrades.

1297
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,770
I'm sure these guys have already analyzed which upgrade's best.

1298
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:40,530
It's actually best to upgrade this to level 2 but don't upgrade it to level 3.

1299
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,370
Before the tournament?

1300
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:51,550
Well, they've got the documents and if I know anything about the Red team here these guys probably had a meeting like an hour ago going like, okay, this is the strategy.

1301
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,310
We gotta do this.

1302
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,290
This game is already out, right?

1303
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:58,030
So they could've practiced beforehand, right?

1304
01:18:58,770 --> 01:18:59,130
True.

1305
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,670
I don't know how they practice though.

1306
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,710
I don't think these servers are public.

1307
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,130
I don't think you can just play.

1308
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,050
You can't just play it?

1309
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:07,170
I don't know.

1310
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:07,490
Maybe.

1311
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,230
Maybe, but I don't think so.

1312
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:13,490
I think these guys have played in this event before, but I'm not sure if it's...

1313
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:15,890
I don't know if you can just play anytime.

1314
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:21,990
These servers, it's only for tournaments only.

1315
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,930
I think so.

1316
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:24,890
I don't want to get this wrong.

1317
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:27,150
I'm the pro and I don't know for certain.

1318
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,530
You're here to be our Minecraft analysis.

1319
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:32,010
Is our Minecraft analysis guy gonna lie to us?

1320
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,330
Am I actually trolling?

1321
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,130
Oh my god.

1322
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:38,390
Red tower under attack.

1323
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:39,850
Thank you.

1324
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:40,890
Thank you, voice line.

1325
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,410
Red tower under attack.

1326
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:44,450
Oh my god.

1327
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:45,490
Thank god they told us.

1328
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:46,610
I would've never known.

1329
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,030
I actually wouldn't because we're just watching people fight.

1330
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:53,230
Wait, red tower's taking so much damage.

1331
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:53,950
Oh my god.

1332
01:19:55,610 --> 01:20:01,090
Looks like team blue are actually putting in the work here, but maybe it's just because team red trusts each other.

1333
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,650
They go, yep, you're gonna go back to base.

1334
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:03,350
You're gonna defend.

1335
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,050
And look, they're not taking damage anymore.

1336
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:05,930
And not anymore either.

1337
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,350
Maybe they're relying on the timer.

1338
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:13,790
Remember when the timer went lower and then all the towers got hit?

1339
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:15,630
There's no timer anymore.

1340
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,350
It starts at 10 minutes.

1341
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:19,870
Oh, okay, okay.

1342
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:27,030
I wonder if they're waiting for that because I feel like it's not that worth it if all the towers are just gonna take damage.

1343
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,050
Gum gum got hit!

1344
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,430
Gum gum!

1345
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:31,710
No!

1346
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,710
Nobody's paying attention to gum gum.

1347
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:35,550
It's kind of sad.

1348
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,270
Maybe he just...

1349
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,250
Oh, there he is!

1350
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:43,450
Yeah, slap him!

1351
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,970
Slap gum gum!

1352
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:48,650
That's right.

1353
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,910
He's been a naughty gum gum.

1354
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:51,530
2v1.

1355
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,230
I feel like Climbug's not winning that one.

1356
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:58,350
Maybe blue can take out the entirety of gum gum here.

1357
01:20:58,670 --> 01:20:59,950
They might be able to do it.

1358
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,890
Hold on, someone's going for defending.

1359
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:04,910
Oh, he ulted.

1360
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:05,890
That has to be an ult.

1361
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:12,370
Oh, here's the backup.

1362
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,690
Cavalry's arrived.

1363
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:18,470
Oh, he almost died for that too.

1364
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,950
Wait, the red team has so many people dead already.

1365
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,290
They had like 2 people dead earlier.

1366
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:27,910
Oh, 2v3 now.

1367
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:34,090
I feel like the plan is just let the other team get gum gum low and then come in for the steal.

1368
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,630
Dude, I think these guys just won a 2v3.

1369
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:42,450
I think the blue team just completely walked into their trap and like gave them 1v1s for no reason.

1370
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,150
How did he die?

1371
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,790
What?

1372
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:48,190
Does gum gum deal back?

1373
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:51,530
Gum gum hits back, bro.

1374
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,790
Is it like knocking back or something?

1375
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:55,010
Yeah, I was like, how did he die?

1376
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:55,770
How did he die?

1377
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,550
Let's go, gum gum.

1378
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:07,230
Defend yourself, gum gum.

1379
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:10,350
Oh, we have the red team rushing.

1380
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,250
They're pushing.

1381
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:12,650
Oh, never mind, blue team too.

1382
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:14,530
Look out below!

1383
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,430
Oh, look out below!

1384
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:17,610
Dang!

1385
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:22,890
0-3, It looks like red got it.

1386
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,910
Red team got it.

1387
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:26,630
They used two ults for it.

1388
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:27,230
You see that?

1389
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,890
They have like 3% ult now.

1390
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:29,310
Oh yeah.

1391
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:44,650
That's gotta be like an iron golem with a cool skin or something, right?

1392
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:46,250
I think that's the case.

1393
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,870
I think it's just gonna be like a teammate that can run in.

1394
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,250
But you're right, I think the ult was used there.

1395
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,510
Is it good to use it on the middle boss?

1396
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:53,910
Maybe.

1397
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,210
I don't know.

1398
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,370
They also got kills from it too.

1399
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,050
That's what I'm thinking.

1400
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:04,310
I feel like it's good just because the blue team was just there for it.

1401
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:09,370
Oh, see look, the timer started for the the half HP.

1402
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:12,710
It starts at like 9 or 8 minutes.

1403
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:13,930
Not 10.

1404
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:18,910
The only issue is that now blue team has a lot of ults for this fight.

1405
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:25,210
Oh, they still died.

1406
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:35,150
I feel like there was more damage on the towers at this point last time, last match that we had.

1407
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:36,570
Really?

1408
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,170
I feel...

1409
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:38,690
Maybe I'm wrong.

1410
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:40,970
Maybe the analysis guys...

1411
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:44,230
They got like the withers already, didn't they?

1412
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,330
At least one of the withers.

1413
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:46,090
That's what I thought.

1414
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,830
I thought they had a wither down by now.

1415
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:51,190
So maybe these guys are playing more defensive than the other team that we watched.

1416
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:54,610
Or maybe this map is a bit too...

1417
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,370
This map is a little bizarre.

1418
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:01,170
It looks huge, like there's people at the bottom now versus the top.

1419
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:05,650
It feels like there's so many places to defend versus the others.

1420
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:06,290
Right.

1421
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:07,510
The other one.

1422
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:11,690
Oh my god, how am I gonna communicate with all that?

1423
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,910
Red's attacking blue.

1424
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:16,030
Oh, but look, they've teleported back.

1425
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:18,030
He leaves.

1426
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:19,770
Oh, unless...

1427
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:20,130
2v1.

1428
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:23,190
Oh, he won the 2v1.

1429
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:24,170
Wait, did he?

1430
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,530
No.

1431
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,510
He teleported back.

1432
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,210
Oh, he teleported back, yeah.

1433
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:29,770
One of them died from it.

1434
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:30,610
From that fight.

1435
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,130
Their rabbit boy died.

1436
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,470
That's a good trade still.

1437
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,710
Look, they're jumping down, trying to avoid the fight, but still getting chased.

1438
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:39,670
Yeah, there's no fall damage.

1439
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:42,350
There's no fall damage for it.

1440
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:44,710
Oh, there's his teammates right there though.

1441
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:49,250
Oh, the creeps saved them.

1442
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:52,310
What a hero.

1443
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:52,890
He's going in.

1444
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:53,870
Oh, nevermind.

1445
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,290
No, he's going in.

1446
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:57,610
Curry you.

1447
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:01,030
3v1.

1448
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,440
Oh my god, soothing minecraft music in the 3v1.

1449
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,940
Oh my god, there's a blue sheep.

1450
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:18,580
Red is so focused on this 2v1 that they're not focused on their towers.

1451
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,180
They're getting damaged.

1452
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,020
Oh my god, they're hiding down there.

1453
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,980
Whose tower is getting hit right now?

1454
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,440
I don't think anyone's tower is getting hit.

1455
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,060
I think they're okay.

1456
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:29,980
There's a big fight.

1457
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,800
Blue is pretty good about defending their tower.

1458
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,020
Yeah, yeah.

1459
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,040
DTMC is going crazy.

1460
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,840
And look, they're dealing some damage on the towers.

1461
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,560
That wither's nearly dead.

1462
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,600
That wither is dead.

1463
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,960
Red wither gone.

1464
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,320
One red wither is gone.

1465
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,300
One red wither gone.

1466
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,280
I think you might be a jinx, man.

1467
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,400
I told you!

1468
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,940
I told you!

1469
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:59,020
I think you might be a jinx, man.

1470
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,040
That's crazy because SmallHat's team is so stacked, not gonna lie.

1471
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,740
Their team is really, really stacked.

1472
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,440
I wonder if it's the map or what.

1473
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:15,200
Maybe they're just focusing their priorities in the wrong places.

1474
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,180
I think there's like four blue guys running down this mid lane right now.

1475
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:19,980
Look, 4v1.

1476
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,420
There we go, look.

1477
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,200
Blue are launching a big attack here.

1478
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,740
And they've got ults.

1479
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,600
Look at their ults as well.

1480
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,380
Okay, there's three.

1481
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,320
There's the ult coming out.

1482
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,140
The army is here.

1483
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:36,600
I'm on fire today, baby.

1484
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,980
I'm on fire today, baby.

1485
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,140
Oh, man.

1486
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,800
Oh, man.

1487
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,280
Wow, they got a crystal down.

1488
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,020
They got a crystal.

1489
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,380
Oh, it's not all the way down.

1490
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,100
It's not all the way down.

1491
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,040
But they used all their ults for that, though.

1492
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,780
They used all their ults for that.

1493
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,820
Oh, they're heading back.

1494
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,460
They're heading over.

1495
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,020
Oh my god, here's the counterattack.

1496
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,300
They're pushing.

1497
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,160
Oh my god.

1498
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,460
They need to, though.

1499
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,720
They really need to.

1500
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:08,360
This is the perfect time, especially if, you know, they killed a lot of the enemies.

1501
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,760
Minecraft analysis guy.

1502
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,060
Is it like...

1503
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,560
Is the blue team less stacked than the red team?

1504
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,660
If I had to say, yeah, definitely.

1505
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,380
I know that...

1506
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,360
I'm not trying to be nasty, right?

1507
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,460
I like the blue team as well.

1508
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,760
Blue team definitely feel like they have one big carry.

1509
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,640
And that's going to be FireBreathMan, which is the bunny boy.

1510
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,460
A bunny boy.

1511
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:35,020
Rabbit boy.

1512
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,980
Yeah, rabbit boy is probably the best player on the blue team right now, FireBreathMan.

1513
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,760
But I think that there's probably like two or three really good red teamers.

1514
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,620
So, I don't know, but does red team have a bunny boy?

1515
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,720
I think they... do they?

1516
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:51,340
I don't know.

1517
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,080
Yeah, they do.

1518
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:52,820
Oh, there we go.

1519
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,280
I was like, what?

1520
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,200
There he is.

1521
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,380
But I'm going to be honest, it looks like blue team are doing better.

1522
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,400
They've got a crystal down.

1523
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,500
They've got a tower down.

1524
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,340
Yeah.

1525
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:05,380
No, blue team is 100% doing better.

1526
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:12,980
They... I feel like red team has not been focusing on attacking the base at all.

1527
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,940
Maybe there's some secret.

1528
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,460
Maybe red's just gearing up.

1529
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,400
Maybe they've got all of the attack that they need right now.

1530
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,200
I mean, red do have three ults.

1531
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,240
We'll see in like four minutes.

1532
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,060
Look down below.

1533
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:30,900
Oh, red are finally attacking.

1534
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,440
Here we go.

1535
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,240
Oh, they're getting two withers maybe.

1536
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,440
Oh.

1537
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,480
Okay, one down.

1538
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,060
Nice.

1539
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:38,900
One down.

1540
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,540
They might grab another crystal.

1541
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,040
Oh, the wither's pretty close.

1542
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,140
Oh my god.

1543
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:45,960
Trust the plan.

1544
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:49,000
They wanted us to think that...

1545
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:49,840
Oh my god.

1546
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:51,520
Look at this attack.

1547
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,880
Wait, they're going crazy.

1548
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,120
Finebug's trying to take out two here.

1549
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,060
Takes out one.

1550
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:57,960
Oh my god.

1551
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,140
Wait, they might get another wither.

1552
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,580
They might get another crystal here.

1553
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,700
Oh wait, that's so close.

1554
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,520
Oh my god, we should have trusted the plan.

1555
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:05,700
We should have trusted the plan.

1556
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,620
There's a second crystal.

1557
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,820
I'm assuming... Oh my god, just one more.

1558
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,180
Oh my god, just one more wither.

1559
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,220
They're all dead though.

1560
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,200
What a crazy counterattack by red, man.

1561
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,220
That was so cool.

1562
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,580
Yeah, but they still have like two...

1563
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,980
They're going to a counterattack and they only have two people alive.

1564
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,060
Oh no, they're going to get hurt.

1565
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,100
I think the respawns are going to be okay, I think.

1566
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,080
And Rad still has her ultimate ability as well.

1567
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,840
Well, Meow and Smallant still have another...

1568
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:35,880
Oh, just kidding.

1569
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,840
Oh, just kidding.

1570
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,900
No, Rad says they're all...

1571
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:41,380
Yeah, yeah.

1572
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,820
No, I just meant the respawn.

1573
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,300
Oh, respawn, yeah.

1574
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:44,980
They're all back.

1575
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:50,140
So it looks like both teams kind of have one ult left now.

1576
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,620
Oh my god, he's hulking up!

1577
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,940
The tower's gone!

1578
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,300
Oh my god!

1579
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,260
Killed it with his last swing.

1580
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,160
Oh my god!

1581
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,420
Feinberg dies there, but...

1582
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:04,280
Wait, three people are already...

1583
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,360
Wait, three people are already dead.

1584
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:07,680
Blue team is still up.

1585
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,020
But I don't... Oh, Smallant's hiding!

1586
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,500
Oh no, he gets found.

1587
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,500
Oh no!

1588
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,280
But look, he's leading the entire team downstairs.

1589
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,560
Maybe this is a good counterattack chance.

1590
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:22,320
I mean, their respawns are back now.

1591
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,600
All the respawns are back, but... Just dragging this one player away is so smart.

1592
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,060
Wait, there's only one crystal left for blue team.

1593
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,220
He's coming.

1594
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,900
He's on the hunt.

1595
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,800
Oh, he's distracted by the hunt.

1596
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:41,720
He got distracted!

1597
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,280
He saw the distraction and he was like, oh my...

1598
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,520
Mob break, you know?

1599
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,580
Just a little ADHD there.

1600
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,700
I think this 1v1 is huge.

1601
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,680
He's cool as a cucumber.

1602
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,440
His heart rate is only 85.

1603
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,900
He knows what he's doing.

1604
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:08,980
He just went for a little detour mission there with the freaking Hoglin.

1605
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,160
Well, the red team is pushing.

1606
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,240
They're like...

1607
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,020
I don't think they're going to take the 1v3 here.

1608
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,800
No, red team dies.

1609
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,540
But I think that might be Feinberg in the back there.

1610
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,560
Feinberg is there, killing the crows.

1611
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,420
Oh, the crystal!

1612
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,660
Oh, the crystal's down!

1613
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,020
Feinberg dies, but it's down to the dragon.

1614
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,060
They had the dragon.

1615
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,820
I mean, you've got to be favoriting the red team here.

1616
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,560
I think red team are probably the...

1617
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,140
The favorites right now, yeah.

1618
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,520
I think that's...

1619
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,220
The content team, that's brilliant.

1620
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:49,360
Yeah, yeah.

1621
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:52,880
But I mean, blue are pushing.

1622
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,900
Look, they're trying to flank outside of this mid lane, but...

1623
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,180
Oh, they got a kill, though.

1624
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,800
They got one guy over there.

1625
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,200
He was like...

1626
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,740
Wait, oh my god!

1627
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,580
That's so much damage!

1628
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,240
Red tower's almost dead.

1629
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,320
Almost done, yeah.

1630
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,720
Yeah, but they still need to get the two other crystals.

1631
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,300
But they're half down.

1632
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,780
It's because of the timer thing.

1633
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,920
Remember when they...

1634
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,040
They did the timer thing where they...

1635
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,180
Oh, GumGum's back!

1636
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,880
I'm coming, I'm back!

1637
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,720
I'm coming for you!

1638
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:35,360
GumGum!

1639
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,200
Who just went in there?

1640
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,020
Oh, red team are dealing damage to the dragon, finally.

1641
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,160
Oh, they're ulting.

1642
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,100
They have...

1643
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,480
Oh, they're dying, though.

1644
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:51,440
Oh, wow.

1645
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,100
Yeah, this is gonna be it, surely.

1646
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,220
Blue used an ult and got them dead.

1647
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,660
They're so close.

1648
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,420
They have to do a counterattack right now.

1649
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:06,980
But there's only two of them.

1650
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:09,060
Maybe just one guy sneaking in would be...

1651
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,480
Yeah, one guy is enough.

1652
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:11,960
We saw that last game, right?

1653
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,640
Just need to get five or six hits on that dragon and it's gonna be over.

1654
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,880
GumGum's just sitting there.

1655
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,400
No, don't kill GumGum!

1656
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:19,860
Good.

1657
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,660
I want GumGum to just slap them and then they fall.

1658
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,300
Just one little shot.

1659
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,640
Red almost have their ults back as well.

1660
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,140
Look, 83, 81.

1661
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,780
Yeah, they just need one good ult.

1662
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:38,420
If they count... If they, like, defend... If red can defend this, they can just counterattack and win.

1663
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,100
Yeah, for real.

1664
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,960
And it's a 4v3 in red's favor.

1665
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:46,320
I think, like, red is... I can't tell, but does red have more money?

1666
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,440
I think they do because they got GumGum in the middle, right?

1667
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,120
They got the first GumGum, that is.

1668
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:51,600
Yeah.

1669
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,140
Oh, they won the fight.

1670
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,520
They killed almost everybody in blue.

1671
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,760
But I think two of blue survived.

1672
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,340
Yeah, two blue survived.

1673
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,720
Oh, there's one more defender, though.

1674
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:06,140
They're onto the crystal.

1675
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,700
Okay, one blue down.

1676
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:08,060
Oh, no.

1677
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:08,920
Okay.

1678
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,040
There's the second blue gone.

1679
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:12,120
They need some sort of counterattack now, though.

1680
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,600
Oh, he hid!

1681
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,800
Smallman tried to hide, but not gonna get the death.

1682
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,220
He tried to hide!

1683
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,680
He tried to hide to get the...

1684
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,540
That's smart.

1685
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,900
That's such a smart, like, tactic.

1686
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,260
When they're rushing to the other base.

1687
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,700
Yeah.

1688
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,180
Yeah, hiding over there.

1689
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:30,580
Yeah, hiding over there just for the sneak attack.

1690
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:31,800
GumGum!

1691
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:32,320
No!

1692
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:33,500
Are they gonna kill GumGum?

1693
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:34,160
I'm surprised.

1694
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,720
Why are they shooting GumGum?

1695
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:36,680
They're wasting time.

1696
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:37,640
They're wasting time.

1697
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,220
You just need to do this much damage to the dragon.

1698
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:43,320
Oh, maybe.

1699
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,220
What if there's one guy on the outside?

1700
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:46,640
That's what it looks like there is.

1701
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:47,880
Maybe they're using him as a distraction.

1702
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,260
Whoa, where did he fly to?

1703
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,000
Did you see that?

1704
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,160
His ult, his ult.

1705
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,200
Watch out below!

1706
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:53,720
Watch out, man!

1707
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,380
It kinda worked, as well.

1708
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,120
Look at this.

1709
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,160
Firebug falls off, and now it's a 4v2.

1710
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,160
All four of them!

1711
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,620
This is huge, actually.

1712
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,680
This is actually insane.

1713
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,900
Blue could do this.

1714
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:08,740
Blue can come back here.

1715
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,860
It's a 4v0.

1716
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,960
Firebug's alive, but what's he gonna do?

1717
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,740
It's one defender against four.

1718
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:17,840
Power down.

1719
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,800
They're killing the crystal.

1720
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,940
Firebug has his ult.

1721
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,160
Can Firebug's ult actually work?

1722
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,480
Oh my god, SmallAnt.

1723
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:29,700
He's on his own.

1724
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,000
Can SmallAnt win?

1725
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,160
He's dealing damage!

1726
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,180
SmallAnt one-mans it!

1727
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:35,740
Wow!

1728
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,120
Who was that?

1729
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,760
SmallAnt snuck around, just like he did.

1730
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,460
The one guy.

1731
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,680
You muted yourself.

1732
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,600
You were so excited.

1733
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,520
What an absolutely beautiful kill.

1734
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,760
That was so close.

1735
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,340
That was actually so crazy.

1736
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:05,100
That was really smart to let them take out the tower so they wouldn't notice that someone was killing the dragon.

1737
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:09,800
They thought they were waiting for respawn, but he was just on the other side of the map.

1738
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,740
They basically baited him.

1739
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:18,680
They baited the entire team to get closer to the dragon so they could sneak in.

1740
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,700
That's insane.

1741
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,020
So he dropped down.

1742
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,120
He dropped down purposely just to do the flank.

1743
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,840
That was so smart.

1744
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,380
Wow.

1745
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,280
That was a close game.

1746
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,160
That was a really close game.

1747
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,120
See?

1748
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,340
You're not a jinx!

1749
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:34,380
I know!

1750
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:35,980
The comeback!

1751
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,160
You gave them the comeback.

1752
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:42,300
I never doubted them for a second, but maybe one second.

1753
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:46,120
Just one percent of that.

1754
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,060
It was risky though.

1755
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:55,880
Especially if all four of them were hitting the other dragon, they could've been getting more damage.

1756
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:56,880
They could've out-timed.

1757
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,320
I don't know what ult that is.

1758
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:04,820
A giant cat in the middle running around.

1759
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,540
It's like, I'm ulting out.

1760
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,140
It's so big compared to everybody too.

1761
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,340
I know!

1762
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,120
That's funny.

1763
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:23,740
I mean, the spam damage is kind of crazy.

1764
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:26,460
I don't think I played Minecraft when that was...

1765
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,260
I don't know actually.

1766
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:28,900
I never did think of competitive.

1767
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:29,980
I haven't either.

1768
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:33,840
I used to spam damage and then my chat would yell at me.

1769
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,440
Stop spamming!

1770
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,880
You're not getting the optimal strong hits.

1771
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:39,880
Yeah.

1772
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:42,140
Now we can give an excuse.

1773
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,000
It's because we were watching this MOBA tournament.

1774
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,300
We thought it was the thing.

1775
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,360
We were watching professionals.

1776
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,480
If they did it, I would do it.

1777
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,500
That's what we learned.

1778
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,580
We actually do have all the teams for round 2.

1779
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,980
For that, we have Team Hannah winning round 2 again.

1780
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,720
That's their second win.

1781
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:12,720
Who did they win against?

1782
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,840
Team Snifferfish.

1783
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:21,160
Team Sparkles won against Team S Major.

1784
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,600
Team SmallAnt won against Team BTMC.

1785
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:26,680
Sorry, no bias.

1786
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:31,040
No caster bias, of course.

1787
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,000
No, of course not.

1788
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:36,540
Team FiveUp wins against Team Shubble.

1789
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,860
Which that is Team Shubble and Team BTMC.

1790
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:43,560
They both have two losses.

1791
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:47,600
Next game would be the final group stage.

1792
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:50,280
After that would be semis and then finals.

1793
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:52,040
We'll see how it goes from there.

1794
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:56,340
Has the matchup for the next group stage been up yet or no?

1795
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,260
No, not...

1796
01:38:59,260 --> 01:38:59,940
Oh wait, yes it is.

1797
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:00,920
Sorry, I'm a liar.

1798
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,140
Round 3, we're in Sweet Peaks, baby!

1799
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,480
Wow!

1800
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:07,560
Sweet Peaks.

1801
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:12,700
We have Team Snifferfish versus Team Sparkles.

1802
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:15,920
Team Hannah versus Team S Major.

1803
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:23,100
Team SmallAnt versus Team FiveUp and Team BTMC versus Team Shubble.

1804
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,060
I don't know who to watch.

1805
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:30,060
Has anyone watched Hannah, Sparkles and SmallAnt, your oshi?

1806
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:30,800
Yeah.

1807
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:34,220
I don't really know the other teams as well.

1808
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,000
I don't either.

1809
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,960
We'll wait for Fulham to come back.

1810
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:41,420
Our professional Minecraft analysis guy.

1811
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,660
I wonder if he has a degree.

1812
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,180
In Minecraft?

1813
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,120
In what?

1814
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,780
In Minecraft, yeah.

1815
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:59,680
Oh, they're saying SmallAnt versus FiveUp.

1816
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,620
We don't get a choice.

1817
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:02,420
We don't.

1818
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,200
Oh, no.

1819
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:05,800
The spectator.

1820
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,720
The spectator curse.

1821
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,620
I'm eating my popcorn.

1822
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,540
Oh, yeah, your popcorn.

1823
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:17,320
Wait, did you tell Chad that you brought popcorn to eat for the tournament?

1824
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,880
No, I didn't.

1825
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,240
Guys, I have popcorn.

1826
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:25,200
Yeah, she has popcorn for this exciting tournament.

1827
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,600
Wait, our British Captain Sparkles is back.

1828
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,100
Oh, British Captain Sparkles.

1829
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:30,500
Welcome back.

1830
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,760
I think our Chad's gonna forget what his actual name is with the stuff we're saying.

1831
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:38,820
We just keep calling him, like, Minecraft analysis guy and British Captain Sparkles.

1832
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:40,280
I say Fulham.

1833
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:41,100
Fulham.

1834
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,580
He has a name.

1835
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,960
He has a...

1836
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:45,880
Big Ham.

1837
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,180
Big Ham.

1838
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:54,360
Large Pig.

1839
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,640
Oh, wow.

1840
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:01,440
British commentator man.

1841
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,700
Oh, there he is.

1842
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,420
Oh, there's a shop.

1843
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:10,160
I love that one time when, like, their dragons were getting attacked and then they just went for...

1844
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:11,460
went to the shopkeeper.

1845
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:19,620
It's like, when your dragons get attacked, it's not time to shop right now.

1846
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,540
It's not shopping time.

1847
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:25,080
I think we're at Sweet Peaks now.

1848
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,780
That's the map that we're at.

1849
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,400
Oh, it's like, it's actually sweet.

1850
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,400
It's like candy.

1851
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:32,100
Yeah, candy land.

1852
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,280
Thank you guys for holding down the fort.

1853
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,140
I kinda needed to go pee, I'm gonna be honest.

1854
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,720
Oh, we were wondering, what degree do you have?

1855
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:40,300
In Minecraft.

1856
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,840
How did you know that I have a degree?

1857
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,080
Yeah, what kind of degree do you have?

1858
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,100
Yeah, what's your credential?

1859
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,160
Your Minecraft credentials.

1860
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,400
Oh, my Minecraft credentials.

1861
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,620
To be a professional Minecrafter.

1862
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:51,220
Your degree.

1863
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:53,680
What school did you taught yourself?

1864
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:57,720
In reality, in real life, I have an engineering degree.

1865
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:01,700
But, in Minecraft, I think that's how you calculate stuff.

1866
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:06,300
Yeah, that's like a redstone degree or something, maybe, like something like that, you know what I mean?

1867
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1868
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,960
I'm trying to translate it to Minecraft.

1869
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,000
What did you want it to be before Minecraft ruined your life?

1870
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,180
Oh, no.

1871
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,900
You can say that.

1872
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,760
You are 100% allowed to say that.

1873
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,520
I could have done anything, bro.

1874
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:29,980
I have a whole ass degree and then I went, yeah, but Minecraft's really fun.

1875
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,000
I could just do that all the time instead.

1876
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,400
That's true.

1877
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:37,900
It's way more fun than having to do numbers and stupid stuff like that, dude.

1878
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:44,460
Oh, we're being told to explain some things for this match, I think.

1879
01:42:45,060 --> 01:43:00,740
So, actually, we mentioned before how this is not like the first time they've done this tournament and they have actually two new characters and they want us to talk about one of the characters is Harmony.

1880
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:12,560
Harmony is being played by 5UPS and she is a scout and she's 29 years old.

1881
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:15,480
She's probably single and probably likes...

1882
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,160
What are her likes and dislikes?

1883
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:18,200
What are her hobbies?

1884
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,180
She probably likes long walks on the beach, you know?

1885
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:23,780
I need the whole dating profile, please.

1886
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:25,180
This is really important.

1887
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,060
For chat, obviously.

1888
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,680
Wait, she has a cat.

1889
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,140
She fights with her cat.

1890
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,260
Which way are we swiping?

1891
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,760
Oh my god, is Rattle playing?

1892
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,560
Oh my god, yeah, Rattle's playing as Harmony.

1893
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:38,240
This makes sense.

1894
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,020
Yeah, you can see the cat on the head, the green cat.

1895
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,920
Oh my god, that's awesome.

1896
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,320
It's so cute!

1897
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,140
Is that the old thing?

1898
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,620
Does the cat become huge?

1899
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:50,580
Yes!

1900
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,600
Oh my god, Rascal!

1901
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,380
Rascal!

1902
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,460
That is so cute.

1903
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:59,520
So the cat hulks out then.

1904
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,060
I see.

1905
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:07,400
Yeah, so Harmony and Rascal are the newest character addition for...

1906
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,560
and then I guess for this tournament, yeah.

1907
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,760
Wait, who's the other character?

1908
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:23,900
Um, I don't think SirBlock is new per se, at least I didn't say, but SmallAnt is playing as SirBlock.

1909
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:29,780
That guy is a dapper man with a suit and tie and he's got a green aura.

1910
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,980
Wait, SmallAnt's playing him, right?

1911
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:34,560
Is that him?

1912
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,320
Yeah, I see the green aura.

1913
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:39,380
He's so dapper.

1914
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:40,700
I'll pay...

1915
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:45,360
I'll pay a Minecraft player $100 if they play Granny Hag.

1916
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:47,560
Dude, we need Granny Hag.

1917
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,240
Where is Granny Hag?

1918
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,600
We need Slam Hag!

1919
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:54,440
Literally, she must be not meta, right?

1920
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,120
The devs might be watching right now.

1921
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:59,300
You can tune up her...

1922
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,740
Yeah, tune up her right now.

1923
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:02,320
Right now.

1924
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,800
Just don't tell anybody.

1925
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,640
Only the real ones will know.

1926
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,660
Just for one game, but for right now.

1927
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,020
They're fighting little candy zombies.

1928
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,260
This is so cute.

1929
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,360
Oh wait, really?

1930
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,540
Oh my god, they are.

1931
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,940
I like how the mobs are themed towards the maps too.

1932
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,580
Got Feinberg coming in.

1933
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,100
Oh, wait, Reinho.

1934
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,340
Oh, isn't she a VTuber?

1935
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,280
Reinho is a VTuber.

1936
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,980
Man, her name literally has VT at the end.

1937
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,840
Oh, you're right!

1938
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,580
I didn't see it.

1939
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,640
It stands for virtual tub or something.

1940
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,800
I wasn't looking at the sides.

1941
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:47,300
I was looking at her name above and I didn't see it.

1942
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:49,760
Her VT for a minute sounds very tubular.

1943
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,200
Very tubular.

1944
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,340
That's what the VT stands for.

1945
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,380
If you see somebody's name at the end, that's VT.

1946
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,460
They're very cool.

1947
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,160
Feinberg coming in.

1948
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:13,320
I like how they're alerted when someone is close to base because the withers just start going crazy.

1949
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,800
There's not really ways to sneak in.

1950
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,240
There's a lot of hiding spots though.

1951
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:22,140
Oh my god, wait, Feinberg lost the 1v1.

1952
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:24,420
I think that's Feinberg, right?

1953
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,200
The Feinberg won the 1v1.

1954
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,560
Oh my god, he's a little sneaky.

1955
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,560
You're right, there are a lot of hiding spots.

1956
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,080
Yeah, there's so many hiding spots here.

1957
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,460
He has no idea.

1958
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,300
Oh my god, he's gonna get ambushed.

1959
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:39,560
Oh my god!

1960
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:40,960
That's crazy.

1961
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,620
That's crazy.

1962
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,880
What a beautiful little hiding spot.

1963
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,380
No, he didn't.

1964
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:51,380
But Silva's there to clean up the pieces.

1965
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:53,180
Wait, no, he lived.

1966
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,580
Yeah, wait, the red team won the fight.

1967
01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:00,740
Yeah, Silva came in from the side and was able to clean it up.

1968
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:02,980
Nobody died during that.

1969
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:04,720
On the other side.

1970
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:09,280
This map is much bigger but also has a little canyon in the middle too.

1971
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,460
Oh my god, it's a cake!

1972
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,400
The devil's food cake!

1973
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:14,760
That is so cool.

1974
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:19,980
Wait, I just realized why we saw slime earlier, because their textures were breaking.

1975
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:25,020
That's why we saw slime for pot of gold.

1976
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,800
We accidentally saw behind the Wizard of Oz's curtain.

1977
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,520
Sorry everybody, your immersion.

1978
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:38,340
I was wondering why the slime was called pot of gold.

1979
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:40,940
Small ant running away.

1980
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:43,240
There he goes.

1981
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:43,880
Run.

1982
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,980
He's gonna get ya.

1983
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,140
He's gonna get ya.

1984
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,560
This map is crazy.

1985
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:55,100
This is why bunny boy is so overpowered here, because if you're getting chased like this, you can just catch up.

1986
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,660
There's no way they can outrun you.

1987
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,460
I think bunny boy is really good for flanking too.

1988
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,160
To get the main tower and stuff.

1989
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,820
He seems like...

1990
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:07,680
It looks like every team has a similar sort of comp as well.

1991
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:17,520
A lot of them have one harmony and one surblock and then you've got the bunny guy and the two minotaurs, I think.

1992
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:24,860
I feel like Feinberg's team has to be the meta team, because I've seen that comp the most.

1993
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:25,720
Yeah, for real.

1994
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:35,100
It's very similar between the two, it's just that small ant is using the surblock and then on the other team, Redoonz is using a different character that I don't know if we've seen.

1995
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,340
That's not the granny, right?

1996
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:37,160
That's not the granny.

1997
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,960
No, granny is actually slimy.

1998
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Who's that character?

1999
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
That might be Axel?

2000
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,060
Is that Axel?

2001
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:48,180
Oh no, just kidding, he's a minotaur.

2002
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:51,380
Yeah, I was gonna say, I thought Axel was a minotaur.

2003
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,580
Let's see, I'm looking through the characters.

2004
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,400
Oh wait!

2005
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:55,740
No, I don't know.

2006
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:00,100
She has brown short hair.

2007
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,060
Mmm?

2008
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:05,840
Mmm?

2009
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:07,160
Mmm?

2010
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:08,540
Mmm?

2011
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,120
I'm not sure, it could be the side.

2012
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:14,760
We should ask our Minecraft analyst guy.

2013
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:15,540
He should know.

2014
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,240
I'm trying to find out.

2015
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:23,100
He should know as the professional Minecraft analysis guy who didn't fake his credentials.

2016
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:27,820
He has an actual degree in redstone.

2017
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,780
I have a degree from Glock University.

2018
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,380
So who is that character that they're playing?

2019
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:36,360
I mean...

2020
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:37,600
erm...

2021
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,600
erm...

2022
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:42,760
erm...

2023
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,520
I think we should just make something up and then we'll agree.

2024
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:46,320
I feel like, yeah.

2025
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:53,440
Is that... okay, it might be Tulibot, which is a cyborg.

2026
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:55,720
That's what I said, it might be the cyborg.

2027
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,540
Wait, are you making stuff up or is that an actual...

2028
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:00,240
No, this is a guy.

2029
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,140
No, it says robotic glasses covering eyes.

2030
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,280
But it says eyes.

2031
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:06,800
Yeah, right?

2032
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,200
There's only one eye covered though.

2033
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:14,380
I feel like there's a couple characters we haven't seen, like the great mage, I don't think we've seen him.

2034
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,640
Ooh, someone used an alt there.

2035
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:18,580
I didn't hear what that was.

2036
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:23,040
Pew pew, did you hear that?

2037
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,100
He's like, pew pew.

2038
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,580
That's Rattles, that's my goat.

2039
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,740
Let's go, Rad.

2040
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:43,100
It kind of makes sense as well, because her Vtuber model is a catgirl and she's using the class, which has the cat and the catgirl is like a...

2041
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:43,660
Hulking out cat.

2042
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,280
Well, that's so perfect then.

2043
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,680
That's so funny.

2044
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,140
Hulking out cat.

2045
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:54,340
Hulking out cat.

2046
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,940
He's like, cootie smash.

2047
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:03,400
We need a reskin of it for you Doki and it's Garfield instead.

2048
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:06,620
Garfield.

2049
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:08,200
Garfield smash.

2050
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,960
My money's gone.

2051
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,820
Lasagna where?

2052
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:17,820
I don't know why he's becoming more like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2053
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:23,540
Mondays at my rate.

2054
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:25,980
Lasagna.

2055
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:34,160
Sounds like Garfield hates Mondays.

2056
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:42,200
The only kind of damage we have so far is the red team has a tiny bit of damage against autowither.

2057
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:48,240
It seems like the first 10 minutes are pretty... It's just farming pretty much, yeah.

2058
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,180
Yeah, I mean, that's what MOBAs are.

2059
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,380
It's just, for me...

2060
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,820
Oh, Red are attacking right now though.

2061
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:54,340
Oh, they're attacking.

2062
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,300
Oh, there you go.

2063
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,580
They're going in.

2064
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:58,340
Thank god.

2065
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:01,980
This is what I personally have initially with MOBAs.

2066
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,000
It's just the first 10 minutes is just farming.

2067
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,300
It feels like that for sure.

2068
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:11,440
But when you get to the action part, it's really fun.

2069
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:12,540
Oh, there he is!

2070
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:16,240
Oh my god, he's cute.

2071
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:17,440
Mondays!

2072
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:20,400
Oh my god, look at him go!

2073
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:23,180
Oh my god, he's so fast!

2074
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:27,520
No!

2075
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:29,480
Garfield!

2076
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:31,840
Garfield.

2077
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:33,500
Ripped to a legend.

2078
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:39,380
What's so great, what's so funny about Harmony is each of the character profiles has, like, why they're playing the games.

2079
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,640
And she plays for her cat.

2080
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:45,900
She plays for... I feel like the cat just wants...

2081
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,440
I think the cat is the one that wants to be in this game.

2082
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,280
For real, right?

2083
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:49,660
Yeah.

2084
01:52:51,180 --> 01:53:00,200
So, Rascal battles furiously to defend Harmony, always staying within a 16 block range of the player until his HP energy runs out.

2085
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:04,680
If Harmony dies whilst Rascal is mid ult, he enters rage mode.

2086
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:08,960
So, like, he goes rage mode when she's dead.

2087
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:12,020
Yeah, but he has to be, like, in...

2088
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:14,380
He has to be, like, kind of already mid ult.

2089
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:15,620
Already mid ult.

2090
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:18,220
I love that.

2091
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,420
Red are attacking again.

2092
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:23,400
They put a tower down.

2093
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,120
We already got a tower down so fast.

2094
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,700
They're being a little more aggressive this time.

2095
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:30,400
Oh my god, I think red team might be better.

2096
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:32,660
Scrungle.

2097
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:36,320
Already 10 minutes in and they already got a tower?

2098
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:37,060
That's crazy.

2099
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:39,060
That's really good for them.

2100
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:40,420
I like this tiny view we got going on.

2101
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:41,640
What was that?

2102
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:45,140
Oh yeah, the tiny POV there.

2103
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:49,720
Is there any worth going into the crevice?

2104
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:50,680
Or is it a death?

2105
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:51,700
Do you die down there?

2106
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,240
It doesn't seem...

2107
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,320
I was thinking, is the crater the second map that we had?

2108
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,060
No, it doesn't seem to be the case.

2109
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,900
I think it looks like...

2110
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:04,120
It's like Willy Wonka down there.

2111
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:07,160
You die in the chocolate sauce.

2112
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,600
This is the chocolate factory.

2113
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:12,260
Yeah.

2114
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:20,180
I mean, blue have done some damage on the red withers, but not very much.

2115
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:23,600
I'm going to be honest, I feel like red are kind of overpowered here.

2116
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,700
Feinberg takes out two.

2117
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:29,380
Oh my god, yeah, I was going to say they just killed so many people.

2118
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:30,880
Damn.

2119
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:35,320
But to be fair, the blue team lost three there.

2120
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,260
So they're like even pretty much.

2121
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:39,540
You know what I want to see?

2122
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:42,340
I want to see Willy Wonka do a battle royale with children.

2123
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:46,520
Is that not just the regular plot of the movie?

2124
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,780
But they don't...

2125
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,060
They don't die.

2126
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,340
Well, hey, you don't know where they go, right?

2127
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,180
One of them turns into a blueberry.

2128
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:01,720
Yeah, but she's still alive.

2129
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:04,320
She has to live her life in the factory, like as a blueberry.

2130
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,880
What kind of life is that?

2131
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:10,320
It's basically death sentence.

2132
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:15,420
Hey,

2133
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:21,440
we've used our two slip-ups already.

2134
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:30,020
Red are pushing and they have their ults.

2135
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:31,540
There's four.

2136
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:33,240
Oh, one person's already dead.

2137
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,180
Finebug's just written this crystal out.

2138
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:41,680
Crystal down.

2139
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:46,100
Yep.

2140
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:50,640
I'm surprised they've not used their ults yet.

2141
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:54,820
Everyone's got their silver as it as well.

2142
01:55:58,100 --> 01:55:59,380
That's crazy!

2143
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:02,640
But the red team did lose a tower.

2144
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,380
Yeah, I think like...

2145
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:09,620
Someone's attacking red as well.

2146
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:12,300
Yeah, someone on blue team is attacking them right now.

2147
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,660
Or they were, because nothing is...

2148
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:19,520
Dude, silver's going crazy on these kills right now, but finally they got enough respawns.

2149
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,000
Finebug got a crystal down.

2150
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,960
He can't take the 1v3.

2151
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,000
He cannot take that 1v3.

2152
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:31,860
They're doing a counter attack, but they just need one person to sneak in.

2153
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,540
That's it.

2154
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,000
What is Axel's...

2155
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:40,700
Finebug's...

2156
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,420
He has three ults.

2157
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:43,660
Red team has three ults.

2158
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:45,240
Dude, I'm surprised they didn't use them.

2159
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:48,100
I know that Smallant used his, because his is down below.

2160
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:56,780
What's crazy, each character even has their own passive, so that's probably why the meta is like, you know, this kind of build.

2161
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,140
The ults for...

2162
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,840
Axel, the Minotaur guy.

2163
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:10,800
Oh, it like locks people in.

2164
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,180
Yeah, it stuns them, I think.

2165
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:13,780
Yeah, yeah.

2166
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,960
It makes them faster.

2167
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,040
Finebug used his ult.

2168
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:21,860
It makes them land attacks more quickly.

2169
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,040
Oh, yeah, they died.

2170
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,480
Oh my god, dude.

2171
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:27,760
Rascal's goated up right now.

2172
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,000
No, Rascal!

2173
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:30,960
No!

2174
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:32,860
Someone from the blue team just fell.

2175
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,360
Oh my god, the dragons!

2176
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:35,700
The crystals are down!

2177
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:36,740
It's just the dragon!

2178
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,040
It's just the dragon!

2179
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:42,790
He's chasing him!

2180
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:48,490
Are we gonna see a flank from blue team, or are red team gonna take this down?

2181
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:49,550
Oh...

2182
01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:57,410
Oh wait, they just need to use the Rascal ult, and then like just run to the dragon and get into rage mode.

2183
01:57:57,550 --> 01:58:03,130
And Rad's at 95% on the Rascal ult right now, so definitely could do, maybe, in a few seconds.

2184
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,550
But she might die here, she's dead.

2185
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,950
We gotta see her respawn first.

2186
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:08,910
Oh, but here he goes!

2187
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:11,650
And there it is!

2188
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:13,650
Wow, that was fast.

2189
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,390
Wow, that was fast.

2190
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:16,110
That had to be the fastest team.

2191
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:18,590
That was a super quick game, yeah.

2192
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:19,410
15 minutes.

2193
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:26,010
I think SmallAnt's team is like really overpowered compared to the other team.

2194
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,270
That's crazy.

2195
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:35,010
That might actually be our first win of the entire round, out of all the teams that are going against each other.

2196
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:38,190
I think it was.

2197
01:58:38,210 --> 01:58:41,810
I think it was the fastest match out of the like four matches we have going on.

2198
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:42,410
That was fast, yeah.

2199
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:44,870
That was so fast.

2200
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:45,590
That was fast.

2201
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:50,910
They like took like three towers down within like ten minutes and everything.

2202
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,600
The highlights, our little recap reel.

2203
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,640
Watching him go...

2204
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,560
Hulk mode.

2205
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:12,380
I love that the cat turns into a huge...

2206
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:17,840
a huge like a rage cat that just tries to defeat everything.

2207
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:18,680
I love that.

2208
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,500
I know.

2209
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:25,180
He's like times three bigger than everybody else too.

2210
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:26,520
Yeah.

2211
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:30,120
He's just like, I'm angry.

2212
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,980
Goodbye, SmallAnt.

2213
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:40,280
Oh, and the win.

2214
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,580
Yeah, baby.

2215
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:45,120
Here it is.

2216
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:45,640
Victory!

2217
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:46,520
Victory!

2218
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:52,500
That was some intense games.

2219
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,520
We do have another.

2220
01:59:56,100 --> 02:00:00,540
Team BTMC actually won against Team Shubble.

2221
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:02,960
Shubble?

2222
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:03,560
Shubble?

2223
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:05,180
Shubble?

2224
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:08,420
Where do you see that?

2225
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:09,560
Oh, I see it.

2226
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,520
Guys, I am professional.

2227
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:18,900
Yeah.

2228
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,060
Yeah, professional.

2229
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:24,700
Wait, that means their game must be really fast too.

2230
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:26,800
Dude, that was fast.

2231
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:27,840
That was pretty fast.

2232
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:29,940
Did they finish theirs before us?

2233
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,300
No, no, we finished.

2234
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,660
It was really close though, yeah.

2235
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:39,200
Oh, so I heard that Fulham has something to say to us.

2236
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:49,360
Yeah, I think I'm meant to say a big, huge thank you to H&R Block for making awesome things happen in gaming.

2237
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:55,000
And you guys should make sure to go check out Luna Client and check out the free HRB Cosmetics.

2238
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,760
Because with HRB Block, it is better with Block.

2239
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,720
That's all I have to say.

2240
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,320
Now, I'm so grateful that you guys were dancing and jumping around during that.

2241
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:05,700
That was super, super helpful.

2242
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:12,900
Yes, thank you for watching.

2243
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:15,880
Hey, shout out to those guys, but we're done now.

2244
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:16,320
It's okay.

2245
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,300
Hey, we're back.

2246
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,520
We're back and ready to talk about the MOBA.

2247
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:20,580
We're back, guys.

2248
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,240
We're back.

2249
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:22,640
No skipper, skipper.

2250
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:28,140
Yeah, we wouldn't be able to have the tournament without you guys.

2251
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,140
Guys, go check them out.

2252
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,880
New exclamation point Luna in either of our chats.

2253
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:36,320
More details about our wonderful sponsor.

2254
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:41,400
Yeah, you can go to the link and get the little cosmetic.

2255
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2256
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:49,560
Oh yeah, Min was telling me how she was setting up her bot for the first time for the stream and was not having a good time.

2257
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:54,700
I started streaming and it immediately started banning everybody else.

2258
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:58,800
Why was it banning?

2259
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,520
What did you do?

2260
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:03,000
Because it was just like people are spamming emotes.

2261
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:07,680
It was like if you post more than three emotes, I'm gonna ban you.

2262
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,760
It was like ten people at once.

2263
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:11,160
It was crazy.

2264
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:20,140
Nightbot is only here for the lunar skin.

2265
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:21,540
Cosmetic.

2266
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:22,620
Lunar cosmetic.

2267
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:24,960
That's funny.

2268
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:27,880
They're like, how dare you spam.

2269
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,180
It's okay, guys.

2270
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:29,940
You can...

2271
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:30,500
Oh wait, no.

2272
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:31,760
Oh wait.

2273
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,400
You can do it on my...

2274
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:37,120
You can't do it on my YouTube, but you can spam emotes on my Twitch channel.

2275
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:41,040
Dude, bots can be like that.

2276
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:42,660
Especially when you first set them up.

2277
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,540
It's like, uh-oh.

2278
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:43,940
Nope.

2279
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,340
Something's going wrong here.

2280
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:49,240
Someone's being rude and too many exclamation marks.

2281
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:49,760
Come on.

2282
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:50,760
Relax, man.

2283
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:51,680
It's okay.

2284
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:53,060
It's so sensitive.

2285
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:55,880
Hey, it's okay to be sensitive sometimes.

2286
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:57,640
It has to for those who don't have mods.

2287
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:58,400
Right, yeah.

2288
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,680
Someone says self-moderate and stuff.

2289
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:03,840
It has to be super sensitive.

2290
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:07,780
One wrong move makes it goodbye channel.

2291
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:09,540
I know.

2292
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,060
Well, we are in the final two rounds.

2293
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:16,740
It's semi-finals next, guys.

2294
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:18,140
Oh my gosh.

2295
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:20,650
We're already at the semis.

2296
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:22,260
I know.

2297
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:22,760
We're zooming.

2298
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:25,880
Who's in the semi-finals?

2299
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:28,020
What are the match-ups for the semi-finals?

2300
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:36,760
I mean, we're still waiting on some of the outcomes of the games, but I think that given the fact that we saw Team Smallant win two games, that's big.

2301
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:41,760
And I literally just heard my friend scream from next door.

2302
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:43,640
So I think they might have just won.

2303
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,900
Oh, so Sparkle's won against Sniffer, then.

2304
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:47,840
I believe so.

2305
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:49,660
Yes, I'm seeing them entering it now.

2306
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:50,260
I can see it in the game's log.

2307
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:53,600
Actually, well, yeah.

2308
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,760
So we have...

2309
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,560
I think Hana has won.

2310
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,080
Well, we just need to know if Hana wins her game.

2311
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:02,320
Yeah, because that would be three wins for Hana.

2312
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:07,720
Yeah, because if Hana would have won all her games, I believe Smallant won all his games too, right?

2313
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:08,500
Yes.

2314
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:11,440
I mean, this is not gospel.

2315
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:17,460
This is not confirmed, but I'm going to assume that it sounds like it might be Team Sparkle versus Smallant.

2316
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,620
And then, I think it might be Team Hana versus FiveUp?

2317
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:24,740
I'm not sure on that second matchup.

2318
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,880
I'm not 100% sure.

2319
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:31,040
Sparkle, Hana, and Smallant are definitely in the semis.

2320
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:32,720
Wait, how many...

2321
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:37,520
Do all groups qualify for semifinals?

2322
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:42,400
Yeah, so I think this is where it splits off into two different brackets where...

2323
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,900
Is it a loser bracket or a winner's bracket?

2324
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:46,860
Yeah, exactly.

2325
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:52,400
I think they call it a consolation bracket because I think loser sounds rude, right?

2326
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:54,500
No one's a loser.

2327
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,060
Everyone's a winner.

2328
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:57,220
Everyone's a winner.

2329
02:04:58,400 --> 02:04:59,600
No, you're fine.

2330
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:01,280
I call it a loser bracket.

2331
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:04,560
We all have to accept it as I grow up.

2332
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:07,860
Hey,

2333
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:13,040
we're sensitive Minecraft players.

2334
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:15,520
We can't be called losers, okay?

2335
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:16,840
Hey, be nice.

2336
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,060
We're runners-up.

2337
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,560
We're consolation brackets.

2338
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:21,160
You know what I mean?

2339
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,280
Don't say the L word here, Tokyo.

2340
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,140
I'm sorry.

2341
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:28,800
I've been a loser before in tournaments.

2342
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,600
I just thought it'd be the same.

2343
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:33,760
Hey, it's okay to be a loser.

2344
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:42,320
Wait, so are the semis going at the same... sorry, the consolation bracket and the winner's bracket?

2345
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,520
Yeah, they both happen at the same time, right?

2346
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,000
They're going at the same time, okay.

2347
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,320
I think we're going to be focusing on whoever is in the winner's bracket though, you know what I mean?

2348
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,660
I feel like that's maybe more important.

2349
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:59,820
But this pretty much determines whether these teams are going to be finishing in the top four or the bottom four.

2350
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:08,080
Because that's now all done from the group stages, but from now on, it all depends on whether they're going to win these bracket matchups.

2351
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:17,160
So, once we go through these semifinals, the last match will be... we'll watch the finals, but there's also going to be a third place match, I think, running at the same time.

2352
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:26,460
I'm going to check what the behind the scenes are saying, but yeah, I think that seems to be usually what the run of play is.

2353
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:33,060
And I think we're just waiting on that final game to see who's playing who in this finale.

2354
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:36,500
Oh, I think we just got it in.

2355
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:38,000
There it is.

2356
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:40,120
Team Hannah gets their third win!

2357
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:41,100
There it is.

2358
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:47,000
Yeah, so it is SmallAnt, Hannah, and Sparklez.

2359
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,420
I think so.

2360
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:51,480
And then I'm not sure who that fourth team is, but I think...

2361
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:54,580
Because I know there's some tiebreakers and things like that.

2362
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:59,620
Now, as much as I'm the quote-unquote pro, I don't know everything about it.

2363
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,120
I need to do some research.

2364
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:02,460
Someone's going to...

2365
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:05,600
Someone will tell me in my ear in a little minute and say, hey, these are the matchups.

2366
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:07,260
So, we'll find that out very soon.

2367
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:09,000
Okay, soon, soon.

2368
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:10,620
I think they're...

2369
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:15,480
They're asking me to do something too, and I'm like, how do I do that?

2370
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,200
Oh, she's...

2371
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,160
Toki is buffering.

2372
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:19,320
Everybody, please hold.

2373
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,120
Guys, please hold.

2374
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:25,900
I'm trying to figure out this thing that they're trying to tell me to do, and I'm like, but how?

2375
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:28,540
I never...

2376
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:30,840
I don't know when I did that.

2377
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:32,700
That was my before 10s.

2378
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:33,060
Okay.

2379
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,740
Buffer, buffer.

2380
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,240
Oh my god.

2381
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:43,900
Guys, please hold.

2382
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:46,980
I'm buffering right now because I'm trying to figure this out.

2383
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:49,540
I think they're helping you.

2384
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,000
Oh, thank god.

2385
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:51,400
Okay.

2386
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:54,160
I might be wrong.

2387
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:56,900
I tried to give you a suggestion, but it might not even be correct, dude.

2388
02:07:58,540 --> 02:07:59,700
Okay, alright.

2389
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:03,600
Is this our fourth map?

2390
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:05,620
Is this Goldmire Gulch?

2391
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:07,720
Goldmire...

2392
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:08,060
Oh!

2393
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:09,700
Goldmire Gulch.

2394
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:13,680
It looks like the first city we were at.

2395
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:15,140
Just sunset.

2396
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:16,140
Does it?

2397
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:17,600
Oh, it does, sort of.

2398
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:17,880
Yeah.

2399
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,460
I think we're just chilling.

2400
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:25,660
I think 5UP's gonna find out whether they've made it to the top bracket or the bottom bracket.

2401
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:26,740
Oh, maybe that's the lobby.

2402
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:28,860
Maybe that's the lobby.

2403
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:31,540
Hi, 5UP.

2404
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,980
You go do your thing.

2405
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:35,780
I believe in you.

2406
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:37,200
They're exploring.

2407
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:39,060
They're giving us a little tour of the city.

2408
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:39,780
Yeah.

2409
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:42,140
They're giving us a little tour while we figure this out.

2410
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:42,680
Yeah.

2411
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:48,340
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.

2412
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:48,940
That's so cute.

2413
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:56,050
Wow.

2414
02:08:58,590 --> 02:08:59,070
Alright.

2415
02:08:59,530 --> 02:09:02,950
You go carry the casting real quick while I figure out settings.

2416
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:03,490
Me?

2417
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:04,090
Okay.

2418
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:08,910
Okay, Fulham, I'm gonna question you.

2419
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,170
Oh god, am I gonna get interviewed live?

2420
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:11,850
This is scary.

2421
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:12,930
I haven't prepared my answers.

2422
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:13,490
Help.

2423
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:15,290
Um...

2424
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:16,830
Um...

2425
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:19,970
What's your favorite Minecraft mob?

2426
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:23,650
That's a really good question.

2427
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:25,090
Don't lie.

2428
02:09:26,110 --> 02:09:27,670
No, I have to think about it.

2429
02:09:27,690 --> 02:09:28,130
You know what I mean?

2430
02:09:30,110 --> 02:09:31,110
Okay, right.

2431
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:33,350
I like...

2432
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:34,730
Oh dude, they all kind of suck.

2433
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:35,910
Like, I don't like any of them.

2434
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:36,810
Woah!

2435
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:39,390
Live on stream?

2436
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:40,770
Dude, what is...

2437
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:42,350
Like, I can't say skeletons.

2438
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:43,750
Skeletons are so annoying.

2439
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:46,510
Do you think that Enderman is sexy?

2440
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:48,490
Oh, okay.

2441
02:09:48,690 --> 02:09:50,510
Hey, am I allowed to speak about this?

2442
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:51,670
On stream?

2443
02:09:52,190 --> 02:09:52,430
Yeah.

2444
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:56,110
Oh, definitely Wither Skeleton.

2445
02:09:56,410 --> 02:09:57,650
Definitely Wither Skeleton.

2446
02:09:58,610 --> 02:09:59,170
Yeah, dude.

2447
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:01,470
They're crazy tall.

2448
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:01,890
Hello?

2449
02:10:02,450 --> 02:10:03,050
Hello?

2450
02:10:04,410 --> 02:10:06,130
Three blocks tall?

2451
02:10:07,410 --> 02:10:08,990
Three blocks tall?

2452
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:09,970
Skinny?

2453
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:11,590
Damn, okay.

2454
02:10:11,950 --> 02:10:13,490
I didn't know you were built like that.

2455
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:17,610
Then where is the Enderman fall into this case?

2456
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:20,070
Oh, hey, Enderman's cool.

2457
02:10:20,870 --> 02:10:22,130
Yeah, but they can teleport.

2458
02:10:22,330 --> 02:10:23,130
And that freaks me out.

2459
02:10:23,370 --> 02:10:26,370
They can teleport and that freaks me out.

2460
02:10:26,370 --> 02:10:27,010
You know what I mean?

2461
02:10:28,290 --> 02:10:31,850
At least the Wither Skeletons, they've got a similar build.

2462
02:10:32,190 --> 02:10:35,790
But, you know, one of them can teleport and one of them can't.

2463
02:10:35,790 --> 02:10:36,330
You know what I mean?

2464
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:38,430
And you can't look at Enderman in the eyes.

2465
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,890
That's something that you learn on day one.

2466
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:41,770
So you're afraid of commitment.

2467
02:10:46,070 --> 02:10:47,250
Oh, you're right.

2468
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:48,610
Sorry, I just registered that.

2469
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:53,370
I fixed it.

2470
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:55,190
Okay, what is...

2471
02:10:55,730 --> 02:11:00,370
Okay, so what is your first thing you do when you are speed running on Minecraft?

2472
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:02,690
Punch a tree.

2473
02:11:03,250 --> 02:11:05,030
Oh, that makes so much sense.

2474
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:06,930
It's just like a real Minecraft playthrough.

2475
02:11:07,150 --> 02:11:08,010
It's like your Let's Play.

2476
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:09,590
You gotta punch a tree.

2477
02:11:10,290 --> 02:11:11,130
It's pretty universal.

2478
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:14,030
What's your type then?

2479
02:11:14,710 --> 02:11:17,050
Yeah, spin the question.

2480
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:18,470
I think it's obvious.

2481
02:11:18,650 --> 02:11:18,950
Enderman.

2482
02:11:20,890 --> 02:11:23,370
Okay, but what makes the Enderman your type?

2483
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:28,370
I kind of like that he teleports because I never know what's going to happen.

2484
02:11:28,470 --> 02:11:30,010
It's going to come up behind me.

2485
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:31,630
Hey, yo!

2486
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:34,250
Damn, Freaky!

2487
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,900
What about you, Doki?

2488
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:46,520
Come on.

2489
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:47,520
Me?

2490
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:49,340
I don't play Minecraft enough to...

2491
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:49,860
Oh, come on.

2492
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:50,380
Shut up.

2493
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:53,360
I'm trying to dodge the question.

2494
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:56,980
We're all airing our dirty laundry here.

2495
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:57,380
Come on.

2496
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:01,020
Okay, wait.

2497
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,720
Wait, wait.

2498
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:03,400
What are the mobs again?

2499
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:06,600
They're going to kick me out of Minecraft University because of this stream.

2500
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,680
You better at least answer the question.

2501
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:09,760
Because of this stream?

2502
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,140
Just because they're like, Whoa, Wither Skeleton.

2503
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:12,960
Yeah, right?

2504
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:19,360
Then what's the right answer that would get you approved in Minecraft University?

2505
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:22,960
Dude, you have to be like, Like, no one.

2506
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:25,000
Oh, I love the Minecraft too much.

2507
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:25,500
Like, no.

2508
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:27,260
What a boring answer.

2509
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:29,960
Doki,

2510
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:39,840
I feel like for you, it would be an Iron Golem.

2511
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:41,860
Why the Iron Golem?

2512
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:43,980
It's the closest to a robot.

2513
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:49,780
That's crazy.

2514
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:49,920
That's crazy.

2515
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:52,340
Okay, look.

2516
02:12:52,540 --> 02:13:01,820
Look, I just think certain Transformers are made, designed to be pretty wild.

2517
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:03,140
I'm trying to be PG.

2518
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:06,440
Hey, I think Iron Golems are tall.

2519
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:09,120
They deal a lot of damage if you're into that.

2520
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:10,180
I don't know.

2521
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:14,160
They can carry me.

2522
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:18,060
And if you're nice to them, they give you flowers.

2523
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:19,560
That's real.

2524
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:20,720
That's in the game.

2525
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:21,700
That's so romantic.

2526
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,140
Why didn't you pick Iron Golems?

2527
02:13:24,180 --> 02:13:25,800
I didn't even think about that.

2528
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:28,000
Why didn't you pick Iron Golems?

2529
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:29,120
They give you a flower.

2530
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:36,620
Oh my god, they can protect me.

2531
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:38,100
Oh my god, you're so...

2532
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:41,260
They protect you, they give you flowers.

2533
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:42,140
This is a good answer.

2534
02:13:42,740 --> 02:13:43,480
I don't understand.

2535
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:46,820
You chose Endermen, but they're like the dead beats of Minecraft.

2536
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:48,580
No, they pick up.

2537
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:50,680
They are literally picking up stuff.

2538
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,740
You splash water on them and they're gone.

2539
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:55,100
They're never coming back.

2540
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:59,800
The moment you splash a little water, they're not coming back.

2541
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:00,620
Oh, we got an ad.

2542
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,060
I'm kind of hungry.

2543
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:12,640
Oh, we're going to be watching Team Hannah vs.

2544
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:13,580
Firepup.

2545
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:16,040
Oh my god, this is the gold minus emmys.

2546
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:16,840
Wow!

2547
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:19,280
I was so locked in.

2548
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,160
I think I got the people right.

2549
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:22,500
I think I got the matchups right.

2550
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:23,960
I'm the Minecraft pro.

2551
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:26,800
Yeah, you're chilling.

2552
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:31,280
Team Hannah vs.

2553
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:33,420
Team Firepup.

2554
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,460
That's what we'll be spectating.

2555
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:39,060
And then the other team is Team SmallAnt vs.

2556
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:39,700
Team Sparkles.

2557
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:43,480
Oh, wow!

2558
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:47,400
Wait, do they take damage from the fire and stuff?

2559
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:48,960
Yeah, I wonder if the lava hurts them.

2560
02:14:49,860 --> 02:14:51,360
You probably don't want to jump into the lava.

2561
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:55,100
But I bet there's something inside the mouths.

2562
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:56,300
You see how there's a bit of popcorn?

2563
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:58,480
You have to jump for the beef, I think.

2564
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:01,660
I think there's going to be the mobs that spawn in the middle that might give you lots of coins.

2565
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:05,200
You've got to travel over that lava and not get hit off.

2566
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:09,580
I like how some of my chat was like, is this the UK?

2567
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:12,120
Hey, be nice, okay?

2568
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:14,200
We don't have hot weather over here.

2569
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:14,980
It would be raining.

2570
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:16,700
If it was raining, yeah, that's the UK.

2571
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:18,180
Yeah, it'd be a lot more grey.

2572
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:20,680
That's true.

2573
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:25,340
What's that new biome that turns the whole sky grey?

2574
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,540
That's the UK?

2575
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:33,020
Wait, did you see the newest updates in Minecraft?

2576
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,280
Maybe someone should have been going for the creaking, bro.

2577
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,880
They hide their hearts somewhere.

2578
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:40,360
Actually, that's kind of not good to date.

2579
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,460
The creaking.

2580
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:48,160
Oh my god, this looks so gloomy.

2581
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:52,420
We were just at the sweet map and now we're in the underworld.

2582
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:52,920
I know.

2583
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,060
It was really cute.

2584
02:15:56,420 --> 02:16:00,160
It's because we committed sin by talking about which Minecraft mob it is.

2585
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:02,680
They're like, remember what you said.

2586
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:05,040
What the heck is an Omnigast?

2587
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:06,380
Omnigast?

2588
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:08,040
It's got four faces, dude.

2589
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:12,540
It's got a face on all of the sides.

2590
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,760
Oh, that's gross.

2591
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:15,920
I don't like that one.

2592
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,760
Wait, can you ride the strider into the middle?

2593
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,740
I wish, that would be awesome if you could.

2594
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:24,780
That'd be cute.

2595
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,400
Oh my god, they already killed somebody.

2596
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:29,800
We already have aggression.

2597
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:31,920
We were like, I miss gum gum.

2598
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:35,320
Dude, oh, I miss gum gum too.

2599
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:37,020
We all miss gum gum.

2600
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,020
Gum gum is better than this Omnigast.

2601
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:41,760
Omnigast, yeah.

2602
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:43,920
Little rascals just chilling over there.

2603
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:46,100
Jump into the lava, do it.

2604
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:46,720
For science.

2605
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:48,700
It'll be so funny.

2606
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,360
Do it while the caster is watching.

2607
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:53,780
We gotta find someone that jumps into the lava.

2608
02:16:53,880 --> 02:16:54,760
I'm sure that'll happen.

2609
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,420
I'm sure that someone's gonna fall in.

2610
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:57,180
Place your bets.

2611
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:58,020
That's curious.

2612
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:03,320
That's curious and be like, I wonder if I'll survive, you know?

2613
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:03,820
Yeah.

2614
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:06,020
Hmm.

2615
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:07,500
The farming.

2616
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:12,160
This is what kind of seems to happen at the start of every game, right?

2617
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:13,380
They're just killing the mobs.

2618
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:15,820
They're not worrying about kills or towers.

2619
02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:18,240
Oh, it's a zombie horse.

2620
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:23,240
I love how a lot of the mobs are striders wearing a hat.

2621
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:23,980
It's so cute.

2622
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:25,240
Oh, dude, he's got a top hat on, hello?

2623
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:26,980
Yeah, he's got his little hat on.

2624
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:31,340
I like how they all have these little custom costumes, too.

2625
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:35,920
Oh my god, no.

2626
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,380
Leave those poor sh- Wait, is that bunny boy?

2627
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:42,120
Is that the bunny boy skin?

2628
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,040
He looks like the Easter rabbit.

2629
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:48,460
We actually have a bit of variation in between the two teams this time.

2630
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:50,900
Oh, you're right.

2631
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,820
Yeah, I see it.

2632
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:53,820
Hangy's got the fire guy.

2633
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:59,040
Hannah's team has like, yeah, Hannah's team has fire guy and, oh, bunny boy.

2634
02:17:59,160 --> 02:17:59,940
They still have bunny boy.

2635
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:01,820
It's like fire guy versus...

2636
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:03,740
What's the fire guy's name?

2637
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:05,340
Have we figured out what that guy is yet?

2638
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:06,120
Dude, no.

2639
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:09,520
We still haven't figured it out.

2640
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:12,540
You could have given me an hour, I read through this document, I'm like, I have no idea.

2641
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:15,620
Maybe the mods, maybe the admins know.

2642
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:17,740
Admins, if you're watching, what is that?

2643
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:21,800
What is...

2644
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:22,760
Yeah.

2645
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:24,620
We know you're watching.

2646
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:30,940
Do one of you two want to try and tell me what Pangy's name is?

2647
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,060
It's the Pyro Elemental.

2648
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:34,300
You guys can say the name though.

2649
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:35,360
Oh, I'll find it.

2650
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:35,640
Hold on.

2651
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:41,720
I've got it on my screen, but I'm going to let you read it.

2652
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:48,760
Ignis Ullabagin Saint Germain Kedrick Von Constantine.

2653
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,560
That's the one.

2654
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:52,800
I would have said that too, but I was a bit, you know...

2655
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:55,280
I had something in my throat.

2656
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:56,560
Oh, okay.

2657
02:18:58,020 --> 02:18:59,640
Why is my table floating?

2658
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:00,640
What did you just say?

2659
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:05,760
The admin said that, but still won't tell us what the fork is.

2660
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:07,700
Tell me what the guy is playing.

2661
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:11,640
I'm just going to screenshot it and say, who is this?

2662
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:13,080
Who is this?

2663
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:19,700
They responded to Min saying a name of, but we still don't know who this guy is.

2664
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:25,520
We need to know the one with the scouter, the dragon ball scouter.

2665
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,520
Oh, it is Chulibot!

2666
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,560
I got it right!

2667
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:31,180
It's fine.

2668
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:34,220
I'm back as the Minecraft pro.

2669
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:35,240
I'm the goat like that.

2670
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:36,000
I got it right.

2671
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:38,300
Get off your high horse now.

2672
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:39,920
We need to knock you down.

2673
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:42,320
Okay, sorry.

2674
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,640
It wasn't you.

2675
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:49,900
Are you sure you even went to Minecraft University?

2676
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:51,660
Where's your degree?

2677
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:58,400
Give me the lore on fire guy.

2678
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:01,040
His hair is fire.

2679
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:02,460
His hands are fire.

2680
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:03,980
He's on fire.

2681
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:06,620
Is that really the lore?

2682
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,380
That's actually the character synopsis.

2683
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:09,900
What?

2684
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:11,360
Really?

2685
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:17,560
There's no age or anything.

2686
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:19,080
He's just on fire.

2687
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:20,960
He's 28 years old.

2688
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:23,860
He's old.

2689
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:30,720
He's playing for the thrill of the game.

2690
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:36,060
They've got a brother.

2691
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:39,900
In the game, the lore says that they've got a brother.

2692
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:41,740
Who's the brother?

2693
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:44,400
Okay, it makes sense.

2694
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:53,160
Actually, their brother is Froska Olwench St. Ward Bonstrap von Constantine, which kind of makes sense.

2695
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:56,760
So there's a fire guy and an ice guy.

2696
02:20:57,460 --> 02:21:00,360
Oh my god.

2697
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:08,140
It's just like that one song, that one movie where there was a fire guy and the ice guy in that Christmas movie.

2698
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:11,280
Yeah, the Rudolph one.

2699
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:13,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2700
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:15,940
Like Snowmizer and Firemizer.

2701
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:21,420
They could've literally...

2702
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:28,800
Oh my gosh, now I'm kind of sad that Team 2 didn't give us the brotherly showdown.

2703
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:33,380
Did you see the picture they sent?

2704
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,180
Alright, they're going for the ghast.

2705
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:46,880
Oh, they almost got the ghast.

2706
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:47,880
Who's the blue team again?

2707
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,640
Team 5 up.

2708
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:57,900
No one's damaged any crystals or any towers yet, but blue are probably getting the ghast.

2709
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:59,000
It's still early.

2710
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:01,780
Yeah, I assume it's also a lot harder too.

2711
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:03,100
Oh, he's trying to steal.

2712
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:04,420
Did he get the steal?

2713
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,480
Did he get it?

2714
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,020
I have no idea.

2715
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:09,560
Loki, I hope he did.

2716
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:14,740
I saw a plus 25 over him, but I'm not sure if that was...

2717
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:15,620
I don't know.

2718
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:16,940
I don't know if he stole it.

2719
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:21,060
I can't tell.

2720
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:24,620
It's very hard to tell from here if they stole it or not.

2721
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:32,040
I like how he just ran up there and just slapped it and nobody cared.

2722
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:36,080
They just let him slap the ghast.

2723
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:37,080
I was like, okay.

2724
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:42,000
Could have been a good time to sneak over to the blue team.

2725
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:43,740
They got one guy again.

2726
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:47,640
It's the same one guy from game one.

2727
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:48,800
It's a one guy strat.

2728
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:52,500
It's your buddy or your friend.

2729
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:53,640
Your other friend.

2730
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:55,380
You have too many friends.

2731
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:56,640
I've got a few of them.

2732
02:22:56,660 --> 02:22:57,280
Don't worry.

2733
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,900
I've got a couple more.

2734
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:05,600
I'm going to say three people right now that are in this game that I don't like anymore.

2735
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,600
Number one is...

2736
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:07,900
I'm joking.

2737
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:08,940
I can't do it.

2738
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,960
I'll say it.

2739
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:15,360
I don't like Doki Bird.

2740
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:18,120
I hate you too.

2741
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:22,040
It was all fake.

2742
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:25,140
We manufactured it for stream because we know people love that shit.

2743
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:27,120
I'm typing a twit longer right now.

2744
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:27,780
Oh my god.

2745
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,140
New drama.

2746
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:32,080
You witnessed it all.

2747
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:37,960
We're going to manufacture drama right now.

2748
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:38,760
For the thrill.

2749
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:39,780
For the excitement.

2750
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:42,640
Just like that fire guy.

2751
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:44,920
Mods, cut the camera.

2752
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:46,080
We're going home.

2753
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:48,800
We need a dramatic walk off set.

2754
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:49,720
In fact, I'll do that.

2755
02:23:49,900 --> 02:23:51,720
I can't work with her.

2756
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,980
And I just leave.

2757
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:04,920
I can't keep casting if she's going to be in this call.

2758
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,200
This is true.

2759
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:11,500
This is the entertainment, everybody.

2760
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:18,440
Oh my god, wait.

2761
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,100
He's wearing a cowboy hat.

2762
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,500
It's so cute.

2763
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:24,300
Why is he yee-hawing in hell?

2764
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:29,500
That's basically the place to yee-haw.

2765
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:32,400
The little scarabs are cute too.

2766
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:38,620
It looked like, just at a glance, it looked like blue team all had an ult.

2767
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:41,820
Maybe they've been saving it up to try and do one big push.

2768
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,100
I think all five of them have an ult.

2769
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:44,960
We can't see it now.

2770
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:45,360
Here we go.

2771
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:48,080
All five of blue team have their ults ready.

2772
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:48,740
Are they pushing?

2773
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:51,900
To be fair, three of the red team do as well.

2774
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:53,880
Yeah, blue team are pushing right now.

2775
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:56,320
Red tower under attack.

2776
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:59,320
Red tower under attack.

2777
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:00,800
They're all ulting.

2778
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,040
One of them died already.

2779
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,040
Need to get Pangi down.

2780
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:06,500
There we go.

2781
02:25:06,580 --> 02:25:07,120
Pangi's dead.

2782
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:08,880
Oh, but it's a 3v4.

2783
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:10,820
They had enough time to respawn.

2784
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:12,720
It's not going to do that much.

2785
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:14,820
Yeah, because it's their first death.

2786
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:18,860
Yeah, I was going to say, if this were late game, it would be huge.

2787
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:19,540
It's not great.

2788
02:25:22,220 --> 02:25:28,780
I mean, yeah, it was an okay push, but they've all used their ults now, and they didn't do that much.

2789
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:33,560
Red have three ults themselves and could do a really cool counterattack right now.

2790
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:39,640
They seem to be heading over.

2791
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:39,880
Oh!

2792
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:46,120
Little flank there, but there's that one red guy that's kind of still protecting.

2793
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,960
I don't know.

2794
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:52,360
I don't know how many different paths there are into the dragon.

2795
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,240
There has to be three lanes, right?

2796
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:55,220
I think so.

2797
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:55,760
In the jungle.

2798
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:56,280
Technically.

2799
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:00,740
I mean, that's usually how MOBAs go.

2800
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:04,320
They usually have three lanes, and then there's the jungle where they can flank and stuff.

2801
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:10,900
I mean, red team... Oh my god, one tower is almost gone, too, for red team.

2802
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:14,820
Yeah, they were still able to do...

2803
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:16,580
you know...

2804
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:17,400
a chip of damage.

2805
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:19,160
I can't tell.

2806
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:27,300
Honestly, I feel like with the games going on right now, blue team is having an advantage over red team.

2807
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:31,100
We saw small ants team destroy blue team.

2808
02:26:31,380 --> 02:26:32,740
So like...

2809
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:32,940
True.

2810
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:35,800
I feel like small ants team has to... Oh my god, see?

2811
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:36,680
He's just hiding there.

2812
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:37,400
Where is his healing?

2813
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,120
Oh, and he popped out.

2814
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,520
Oh my god, he's so fast!

2815
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:45,720
Oh, that must be...

2816
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,080
No, that's not his ult.

2817
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:48,360
Oh, he's dead.

2818
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:52,460
He's like, I can solo him.

2819
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:54,880
And then he dies instantly.

2820
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,180
Oh, that's a tower down.

2821
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:01,520
That was a tower down, yeah.

2822
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,680
Where did he get that tower?

2823
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,860
I was like, for a non-league player, Doki knows a lot.

2824
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:08,620
I played Deadlock, guys!

2825
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:09,500
I played it!

2826
02:27:09,800 --> 02:27:11,300
She's a secret...

2827
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,760
She's a league player in denial.

2828
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:14,420
Truly.

2829
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:15,820
I played Deadlock!

2830
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:17,460
It's practically league.

2831
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:23,120
Practically league is saying league in the same sentence.

2832
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:23,740
No, it's not.

2833
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:25,280
It is, actually.

2834
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:27,140
It technically...

2835
02:27:27,140 --> 02:27:28,120
No, it's not.

2836
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:30,540
League is like more miserable.

2837
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:36,040
I don't know anything about MOBAs.

2838
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,460
I'm here for the fun.

2839
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:39,920
She's here for the thrill of it.

2840
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:41,060
I'm here for the thrill of it.

2841
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:41,700
Call me!

2842
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:42,800
I'm here for the cat, bro.

2843
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,480
I'm gonna be honest.

2844
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:45,000
I'm only playing for my cat.

2845
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:47,980
I'm here for GumGum.

2846
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:50,140
I miss GumGum.

2847
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:51,320
Bring GumGum back.

2848
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:53,500
GumGum, final boss.

2849
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:54,140
GumGum.

2850
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:57,500
Just put...

2851
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:59,960
Just change all the textures for GumGum at this point.

2852
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:04,340
Instead of a wither skeleton that's guarded by a GumGum.

2853
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:09,000
GumGum that shoots out little fireballs.

2854
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,640
Is that tower down?

2855
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:13,240
I think he's doing a lot of damage, to be fair.

2856
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:13,780
Yeah.

2857
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:15,700
Ow.

2858
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:19,940
Couldn't one-man it, though.

2859
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:21,840
Even though you got pretty close.

2860
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:22,820
The health is low.

2861
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:23,600
Yeah.

2862
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:29,580
I mean, they're doing a one-guy strat again where everybody else acts as a distraction.

2863
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:31,560
But I don't know if for this team if it works.

2864
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:37,060
I love how the bun rabbit boy's costume is just a guy with rabbit ears.

2865
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:39,360
It's like he's cosplaying right now.

2866
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:39,940
It's okay to be a rabbit ear guy.

2867
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:42,980
Oh.

2868
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:45,280
Oh my god.

2869
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:46,840
Nice shots.

2870
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:49,420
Look at those dodges.

2871
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,180
And then he died.

2872
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:52,940
Oh, one...

2873
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:53,780
Here we go.

2874
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:54,780
The one-guy strat.

2875
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:57,140
Or in this situation, one gal.

2876
02:28:57,140 --> 02:28:58,300
Hannah's right here.

2877
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:00,620
Killing that mid tower.

2878
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:05,740
Decides to dodge that tower and go for the one that has lower health to try and get it killed.

2879
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:06,760
That's smart.

2880
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:17,880
I don't know if it's smart against this team to do that because I feel like the other team is more like working together to grab the towers.

2881
02:29:19,660 --> 02:29:20,920
I mean, I think we'll find out.

2882
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,840
But bear in mind, last match we watched was pretty much done at this point.

2883
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,620
We got it done in 15 minutes, right?

2884
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:29,180
We've only got one tower down.

2885
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:32,620
And last time they had all the towers, all the crystals, and the dragon.

2886
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:35,360
I think this match is definitely a lot slower.

2887
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:38,100
They're a little more evenly matched.

2888
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,120
I'd say.

2889
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:42,840
I feel like...

2890
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:44,940
Oh, wait.

2891
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:46,780
Smine already won their game.

2892
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:47,780
No way.

2893
02:29:49,320 --> 02:29:51,280
I'm on fire today, baby.

2894
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:55,240
I'm not sure my chat's lying to me, but someone was like...

2895
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,820
Someone wrote SmallAnt won.

2896
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,720
No, I see it too.

2897
02:29:59,020 --> 02:29:59,360
Oh, wait.

2898
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:00,400
No, I don't see it.

2899
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:00,840
Just kidding.

2900
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:01,900
Oh, yeah.

2901
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:04,700
Oh, my god.

2902
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,100
That's crazy.

2903
02:30:06,300 --> 02:30:07,340
That's so fast.

2904
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:09,920
I think, judging by...

2905
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:13,400
Whoever wins this matchup, I think they're...

2906
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:17,260
Because we saw Hanna won against CaptainSparklez.

2907
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,840
And then SmallAnt demolished a five-ups team.

2908
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:27,860
I think we can tell who's gonna win just from that.

2909
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:33,060
Unless whoever's facing SmallAnt's gonna have the most miracle run ever.

2910
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:37,220
It could be like a map goes against someone's play.

2911
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:38,860
Or like underdog.

2912
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:41,120
The underdog.

2913
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,060
We don't wanna jinx anybody.

2914
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:47,460
Maybe someone on SmallAnt's team crashes.

2915
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:51,800
We just had another team come in.

2916
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:55,460
Sniperish lost to Btmc.

2917
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:56,520
Oh!

2918
02:30:57,760 --> 02:30:58,980
You see that little buffoo?

2919
02:30:59,380 --> 02:31:03,060
That's one of those lower bracket team matchups right there.

2920
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:07,860
And that still matters because obviously the prizes are gonna change between 8th and 1st.

2921
02:31:08,260 --> 02:31:12,920
So even if you're in that lower bracket, you're still gonna try and get to that top 5.

2922
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,060
If you can get 5th, that's still a big... Hey!

2923
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:16,860
Everyone's gonna go home happy, I think.

2924
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:18,880
Yeah, exactly.

2925
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:23,160
BlueCrystal under attack.

2926
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:25,420
BlueCrystal under attack.

2927
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:29,720
Oh my gosh, she's taking him in an adventure right now.

2928
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,420
It's going down!

2929
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:30,980
Oh my gosh!

2930
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:32,040
Is it getting solo'd?

2931
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:33,180
Oh my god.

2932
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:34,700
And there it is!

2933
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:35,760
Oh, it's down!

2934
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:38,280
And then the next tower!

2935
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:41,540
1 HP on that tower.

2936
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:43,380
I think they just died at the 1 HP.

2937
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:46,000
Oh, that was close.

2938
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:49,540
That's...

2939
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:52,220
I mean, there's 9 seconds left.

2940
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:54,780
After that, the whole tower takes damage, I believe.

2941
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:55,060
Right?

2942
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,620
Oh yeah, they're about to...

2943
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:01,600
Wait, what?

2944
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:03,300
What the hell?

2945
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:05,880
Oh my god.

2946
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:08,020
That counter is a little...

2947
02:32:08,020 --> 02:32:09,560
mysterious for us.

2948
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:11,320
Yeah, I'm still a little mysterious.

2949
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:12,540
I still don't understand.

2950
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:15,760
And another tower down on the red team!

2951
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:16,200
Yeah!

2952
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,540
And they're going after the crystal.

2953
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:19,260
Oh my gosh.

2954
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:24,800
I guess that is... that has to be the mid-boss then.

2955
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:29,000
Remember that one time when all the towers got hit?

2956
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,160
I wonder what that was.

2957
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:33,820
Yeah, the mid-boss is back.

2958
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,820
I guess that was a mid-boss time.

2959
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:36,700
I wonder what that was.

2960
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:40,840
Remember when, like, when the timer was going down and all the towers got hit at once?

2961
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:41,480
Oh, there it is!

2962
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:42,420
Nevermind, it happened.

2963
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:45,160
There it is!

2964
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:47,280
There was a little delay, but there it is.

2965
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,720
Oh my gosh, that really...

2966
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:51,560
It really makes it look like everybody is kind of...

2967
02:32:57,850 --> 02:32:58,830
There it is.

2968
02:32:59,090 --> 02:33:06,010
I guess because they killed the boss the moment, the right time when the towers lost HP too.

2969
02:33:06,270 --> 02:33:07,830
So it was just timing-wise.

2970
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:09,470
Oh my god.

2971
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:09,870
Solo.

2972
02:33:10,190 --> 02:33:11,270
Let's go.

2973
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:12,650
Let's go.

2974
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:14,810
I can solo her.

2975
02:33:15,470 --> 02:33:16,910
That's the last tower!

2976
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:19,270
That's the last wither down for Team 2!

2977
02:33:20,230 --> 02:33:23,210
Oh my god, the ult to the crystal is so smart.

2978
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:25,490
I'm gonna deal damage to it.

2979
02:33:25,870 --> 02:33:29,190
Yeah, I think it really looks like Red are gonna take this down here.

2980
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:31,390
Yay, we got the dragon!

2981
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:37,330
They ulted to kill that last player, but I mean, it's all down to the dragon.

2982
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:38,850
Yeah, I'm not sure.

2983
02:33:39,230 --> 02:33:41,630
There's still three crystals and a whole tower.

2984
02:33:42,730 --> 02:33:45,190
That's pretty rough for the whole team.

2985
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:49,430
The crystals are almost down though, so it's not gonna be that rough.

2986
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:51,330
They just need to make sure they grab...

2987
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:56,670
Two people need to respawn, so the moment they kill one of them... Oh, Pengi has like... Oh, nevermind.

2988
02:33:56,750 --> 02:33:57,450
Pengi's back.

2989
02:33:59,430 --> 02:34:02,670
I was gonna say, Pengi has a long respawn, but he's back now.

2990
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:06,270
Yeah, I think... Maybe there's an item that you can purchase too.

2991
02:34:06,670 --> 02:34:08,090
Cause I feel like... Respawn faster?

2992
02:34:08,390 --> 02:34:12,550
Yeah, you saw I said 58 seconds, and then they're back?

2993
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:22,630
Yeah, it's happened to me before, so I'm wondering if maybe there's an item or something that allows them to respawn more like, faster to come in.

2994
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:31,610
I think it may... Maybe it's just like the... Yeah, the timer looks like it counts down to zero and then keeps going a little bit further.

2995
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:33,470
That's why.

2996
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:39,350
Yeah, cause I was like wondering why it went zero and then like 59 58, and I was like, whoa that's long.

2997
02:34:40,370 --> 02:34:41,350
Is that an ult there?

2998
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:42,610
Is that our fire there?

2999
02:34:42,930 --> 02:34:44,250
They almost...

3000
02:34:44,250 --> 02:34:45,310
They gotta sneak it in.

3001
02:34:45,890 --> 02:34:48,110
I mean, all of them are guarding it really well now.

3002
02:34:48,210 --> 02:34:49,330
The defense is really good.

3003
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:52,470
But they need to offense too, like they can't just...

3004
02:34:54,630 --> 02:34:57,430
They're like, I'm gonna guard this dragon for 19 minutes.

3005
02:35:01,770 --> 02:35:02,650
Oh, oh!

3006
02:35:02,670 --> 02:35:03,830
Oh, they're on the crystal!

3007
02:35:04,370 --> 02:35:06,350
Oh, they got one of them.

3008
02:35:06,510 --> 02:35:07,350
They got one, yeah.

3009
02:35:08,950 --> 02:35:10,230
Yeah, blue dragon's under attack.

3010
02:35:10,890 --> 02:35:11,910
There it is, surely.

3011
02:35:12,490 --> 02:35:13,350
Oh, no way.

3012
02:35:14,010 --> 02:35:15,630
That was so close.

3013
02:35:16,370 --> 02:35:17,930
Red still have to push.

3014
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:20,210
They've still got like 10% left of that dragon health.

3015
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:21,750
I can't see blue coming back.

3016
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:23,670
The thing is, they have three people that are down.

3017
02:35:23,930 --> 02:35:27,250
The blue team knows that three people are down so they're rushing it now.

3018
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:28,790
Do you think they can rush in time?

3019
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:30,430
Oh, Kaboodle!

3020
02:35:31,370 --> 02:35:32,390
Kaboodle got spotted!

3021
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:35,010
They saw him though.

3022
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:35,590
I don't know.

3023
02:35:35,770 --> 02:35:37,950
I think they're...

3024
02:35:38,730 --> 02:35:41,090
I don't think they're going after him though.

3025
02:35:42,730 --> 02:35:44,290
He's like, psych!

3026
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:46,390
Oh my god.

3027
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:50,170
If Cap goes back now, she might be able to get this next crystal.

3028
02:35:50,670 --> 02:35:51,870
Or get the last damage.

3029
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:54,210
But no, blue are fully defending.

3030
02:35:54,210 --> 02:35:55,730
Blue are hard defending.

3031
02:35:55,730 --> 02:35:57,490
There was somebody at the red team.

3032
02:35:57,710 --> 02:35:59,590
Three are on the red side.

3033
02:36:00,090 --> 02:36:00,510
Three of them.

3034
02:36:01,750 --> 02:36:03,670
Two people died already on blue.

3035
02:36:05,230 --> 02:36:06,210
Coke our field!

3036
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:10,070
Yeah, they defended it.

3037
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:12,270
Hannah's defending really well.

3038
02:36:12,490 --> 02:36:13,350
Looks like...

3039
02:36:13,350 --> 02:36:14,010
Oh, here it is!

3040
02:36:14,810 --> 02:36:16,330
One man, again!

3041
02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:20,170
Same thing as last time.

3042
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:25,150
Shatter goes through, gets that final few hits on the dragon, just flanks and wins.

3043
02:36:25,650 --> 02:36:28,150
It was worth it.

3044
02:36:28,350 --> 02:36:29,810
It was worth the risk.

3045
02:36:30,250 --> 02:36:31,870
So that means we have our finalists, right?

3046
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:34,210
We have team Hannah vs team SmallAnt.

3047
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:40,030
And in that third place matchup, it's going to be team Sparklez vs team FiveUp.

3048
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:43,690
It's a pretty interesting matchup in both senses.

3049
02:36:44,050 --> 02:36:47,510
I assume we're going to be watching the grand finals here.

3050
02:36:47,610 --> 02:36:48,530
Hannah and SmallAnt.

3051
02:36:48,530 --> 02:36:49,150
Yeah.

3052
02:36:50,050 --> 02:36:52,270
I feel like it's going to be a really fast game.

3053
02:36:52,510 --> 02:36:53,010
Me too.

3054
02:36:53,370 --> 02:36:54,890
I just don't know who it's going to go to.

3055
02:36:56,910 --> 02:36:58,410
You don't have to be...

3056
02:36:58,410 --> 02:36:59,490
You don't have to pretend.

3057
02:36:59,750 --> 02:37:01,510
Okay, maybe that's true.

3058
02:37:03,330 --> 02:37:06,210
Fine, if I don't have to pretend, I know who it's going to.

3059
02:37:06,730 --> 02:37:10,610
I was going to say, Mr. Minecraft analysis, you don't have to pretend here.

3060
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:12,930
Minna and I definitely know who it is.

3061
02:37:13,150 --> 02:37:14,710
We're giving everyone a fair shot.

3062
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:16,310
It's all for the drama.

3063
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:17,370
It all matters.

3064
02:37:17,490 --> 02:37:17,990
You know what I mean?

3065
02:37:18,310 --> 02:37:19,650
Anyone can win.

3066
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:21,150
No one's a loser here.

3067
02:37:21,270 --> 02:37:22,730
It's just a consolation bracket.

3068
02:37:23,130 --> 02:37:25,030
Okay, but you're an analysis, right?

3069
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:31,050
So you're here to talk about who you think is going to win as a Minecraft analysis.

3070
02:37:31,890 --> 02:37:33,350
I already told you...

3071
02:37:34,370 --> 02:37:37,470
Who do you think is going to win this tournament?

3072
02:37:38,230 --> 02:37:40,510
I already told you who I thought my underdog was.

3073
02:37:40,690 --> 02:37:42,750
And that man right there has silver runs.

3074
02:37:42,910 --> 02:37:46,390
I just cannot see anyone able to face up against him.

3075
02:37:46,450 --> 02:37:49,410
I think that he's, like I say, a little bit under the radar.

3076
02:37:50,070 --> 02:37:51,290
Maybe hidden gem.

3077
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:53,170
Sleeper agent if you will.

3078
02:37:54,930 --> 02:37:56,310
A sleeper is...

3079
02:37:56,310 --> 02:38:01,050
Really, really strong player, but maybe under the radar a little bit.

3080
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:05,350
Oh, 100%.

3081
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:05,550
Hello?

3082
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:08,950
Like, Feinberg is mid, but silver is the GOAT.

3083
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:09,430
You know what I mean?

3084
02:38:11,550 --> 02:38:12,190
Clip it!

3085
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:13,090
Clip it!

3086
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:14,630
Clip it!

3087
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:17,170
No!

3088
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:19,470
I'm gonna get cancelled!

3089
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:20,370
No!

3090
02:38:22,270 --> 02:38:23,070
Clip it!

3091
02:38:24,030 --> 02:38:26,430
Fulham says Feinberg is mid.

3092
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:27,470
But we don't believe that.

3093
02:38:27,570 --> 02:38:30,250
Mid and I do not share the same opinion, by the way.

3094
02:38:30,450 --> 02:38:32,590
We don't share the same opinion.

3095
02:38:32,590 --> 02:38:35,330
Do you guys think that team Feinberg and team Smolant are going to win though?

3096
02:38:35,650 --> 02:38:40,450
I think that's who the casters booth is supporting in this final matchup.

3097
02:38:40,590 --> 02:38:43,690
I think there is some biases.

3098
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:46,130
Not from me, of course, but for a team.

3099
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:49,290
There's never been biases anywhere.

3100
02:38:50,310 --> 02:38:53,970
I don't have any additional stakes that I've bet with anyone.

3101
02:38:55,890 --> 02:39:03,310
Not when we were talking about teams and your ears and eyes didn't perk up the moment you heard one of the teams that you get suspected.

3102
02:39:03,330 --> 02:39:06,030
I'm just saying that I...

3103
02:39:06,030 --> 02:39:07,070
You know...

3104
02:39:10,790 --> 02:39:11,590
It's just...

3105
02:39:11,590 --> 02:39:13,390
There's exciting people everywhere.

3106
02:39:13,630 --> 02:39:15,130
That's all I'm going to say.

3107
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:18,470
Yeah, and which one were you most excited about mid?

3108
02:39:18,610 --> 02:39:19,570
Which one was it?

3109
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:19,970
GumGum.

3110
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:23,050
No, team GumGum.

3111
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:24,370
I think GumGum's going to win.

3112
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:26,110
He was there, not going to lie.

3113
02:39:26,170 --> 02:39:27,690
He was there!

3114
02:39:32,690 --> 02:39:41,870
The thing that's so interesting, like the game we just watched again, the team that won only got 30 kills and the team that lost got 60.

3115
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:43,970
So like...

3116
02:39:43,970 --> 02:39:45,810
It's such a weird...

3117
02:39:46,590 --> 02:39:48,710
I think it's because of Hannah's strat.

3118
02:39:49,170 --> 02:39:52,230
They literally just send one person over and that's it.

3119
02:39:52,270 --> 02:39:53,390
And it works.

3120
02:39:53,510 --> 02:39:54,410
It does work though.

3121
02:39:55,490 --> 02:40:02,390
They lose their players during defense when they're defending the towers but then they only send people over to kill.

3122
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:07,050
They just send one person over every time and it works for them.

3123
02:40:07,330 --> 02:40:10,470
And I think the rest of the team just focuses on farming creep too.

3124
02:40:11,810 --> 02:40:12,970
Which helps a lot.

3125
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:19,030
Great analysis.

3126
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:22,330
I believe we're watching the finals next, right?

3127
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:26,150
I believe so and all of the teams are done.

3128
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:27,450
So I guess they're just setting that up.

3129
02:40:27,930 --> 02:40:29,370
Who won what?

3130
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:30,690
Can you read it out for me?

3131
02:40:30,970 --> 02:40:32,870
We have...

3132
02:40:35,030 --> 02:40:39,490
Team Hannah as our winner versus Team Fival.

3133
02:40:41,330 --> 02:40:42,730
We have...

3134
02:40:42,730 --> 02:40:47,370
Team Smallant as our winner versus Team Sparkles.

3135
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:50,670
And then for the...

3136
02:40:50,670 --> 02:40:52,010
What are we calling them?

3137
02:40:52,110 --> 02:40:52,930
The small league?

3138
02:40:53,850 --> 02:40:54,770
Yeah, the little league.

3139
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:55,310
I like that.

3140
02:40:56,370 --> 02:40:58,730
We have...

3141
02:40:58,730 --> 02:41:01,030
For the small league...

3142
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:02,470
Oh god.

3143
02:41:03,030 --> 02:41:04,150
I feel like that's worse.

3144
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:08,950
Little itty bitty league.

3145
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:17,510
Those who are babies...

3146
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:21,530
Team S Major as our winner versus Team Shubble.

3147
02:41:21,850 --> 02:41:22,690
And then...

3148
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:26,650
Team TMC as our winner versus Team Snipperish.

3149
02:41:27,230 --> 02:41:27,750
Snipperish.

3150
02:41:28,950 --> 02:41:30,550
Which I was like, um...

3151
02:41:30,550 --> 02:41:31,650
It's average size.

3152
02:41:36,230 --> 02:41:40,270
I actually think it's quite a big league if I'm being honest with you.

3153
02:41:40,730 --> 02:41:43,410
I think it's above average league.

3154
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:47,910
We're talking so much shit and we wouldn't be able to last like two seconds if we were...

3155
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:54,110
If we were in this matchup we could absolutely destroy it.

3156
02:41:56,710 --> 02:41:59,850
Unless the admins keep us like creative mode or something.

3157
02:41:59,910 --> 02:42:01,590
But hey, we're the casters.

3158
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:03,450
We're just here to let you know.

3159
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:05,870
Casters doesn't mean they're the best players.

3160
02:42:06,010 --> 02:42:07,090
Look at other esports.

3161
02:42:07,750 --> 02:42:08,790
I shouldn't say that.

3162
02:42:10,750 --> 02:42:11,550
Oh, fine.

3163
02:42:11,650 --> 02:42:13,170
What, you calling me not the best player?

3164
02:42:13,270 --> 02:42:13,850
Okay, that's fine.

3165
02:42:14,110 --> 02:42:16,090
You guys can be rude and nasty to the pro.

3166
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:17,450
It's fine.

3167
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:18,250
No, you guys are right.

3168
02:42:19,290 --> 02:42:20,410
What do you mean?

3169
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:21,990
Yeah, you're literally casting.

3170
02:42:23,770 --> 02:42:25,810
When are you gonna get into the match?

3171
02:42:26,130 --> 02:42:26,570
True.

3172
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:30,210
Why are you just a caster?

3173
02:42:31,730 --> 02:42:33,290
It's because I'm washed, I think.

3174
02:42:35,810 --> 02:42:36,690
This guy...

3175
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:38,410
No, we're not letting him in.

3176
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:39,770
He's too good.

3177
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:41,330
He wouldn't let the teams be balanced.

3178
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:44,170
That's why you're a Minecraft professional analyst.

3179
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:46,110
He's all speed, no skill.

3180
02:42:46,670 --> 02:42:50,410
You knew way too much that it just wouldn't be fair if you were part of the games.

3181
02:42:51,230 --> 02:42:52,110
Right, like...

3182
02:42:52,110 --> 02:42:54,230
Stop gassing him up.

3183
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:58,350
Sorry, you can take him down a peg.

3184
02:42:58,770 --> 02:43:00,490
Oh, you're allowed to, don't worry.

3185
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:02,190
We're doing good cop, bad cop.

3186
02:43:02,250 --> 02:43:03,550
It's your turn to be bad cop.

3187
02:43:05,390 --> 02:43:05,870
British!

3188
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:07,690
No!

3189
02:43:08,730 --> 02:43:09,210
No!

3190
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:10,110
No!

3191
02:43:13,470 --> 02:43:14,210
It's okay.

3192
02:43:14,410 --> 02:43:16,350
I will always have the British curse.

3193
02:43:16,610 --> 02:43:19,290
That's something I have to deal with for the rest of my life.

3194
02:43:19,290 --> 02:43:21,730
You can always leave.

3195
02:43:23,970 --> 02:43:26,870
No matter where I go, the British curse will follow.

3196
02:43:27,570 --> 02:43:28,170
That's...

3197
02:43:28,170 --> 02:43:31,350
No, you can pretend to be Australian.

3198
02:43:32,310 --> 02:43:32,690
Cute.

3199
02:43:34,070 --> 02:43:35,430
But then you'd be Australian.

3200
02:43:36,250 --> 02:43:36,770
Oh my god.

3201
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:38,670
Oh my god, what is that?

3202
02:43:38,690 --> 02:43:40,370
I'm excited for this map.

3203
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:43,190
We are at Meow Meow Manor, everybody.

3204
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:46,690
Meow Meow Manor.

3205
02:43:46,690 --> 02:43:48,990
Oh my gosh.

3206
02:43:49,110 --> 02:43:50,150
Oh my god.

3207
02:43:50,370 --> 02:43:51,670
What a big boy.

3208
02:43:53,170 --> 02:43:56,690
I think that this, if I had to say...

3209
02:43:58,910 --> 02:44:00,050
Oh my god, more cats.

3210
02:44:00,270 --> 02:44:00,530
Oh!

3211
02:44:02,430 --> 02:44:03,750
Where does the...

3212
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:05,630
Oh, I guess the dragon is down there.

3213
02:44:06,330 --> 02:44:08,710
They're just watching over the cats.

3214
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:09,670
Oh!

3215
02:44:10,530 --> 02:44:13,290
I wonder if you can drop... I don't think you can drop down, right?

3216
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:14,270
There's no way.

3217
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:17,490
Oh, there's definitely little pods down here.

3218
02:44:17,490 --> 02:44:18,170
Look at this.

3219
02:44:18,190 --> 02:44:19,270
There's loads of hiding spots.

3220
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:20,690
Apparently, this is a new map.

3221
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:21,270
Oh!

3222
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:24,570
So we're getting a first look at it.

3223
02:44:24,670 --> 02:44:25,070
Wow!

3224
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:28,570
Wow, we're getting first exclusive look right here on this channel.

3225
02:44:29,330 --> 02:44:30,010
I think...

3226
02:44:30,010 --> 02:44:31,090
I think that the...

3227
02:44:31,090 --> 02:44:37,350
I think that the admins... the admins must love... must be cat people, right?

3228
02:44:37,410 --> 02:44:41,510
Because the new map, that's Cat Manor, or Meow Meow Manor, right?

3229
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:49,370
And the new hero, or the new character, that's Harmony, right?

3230
02:44:49,370 --> 02:44:50,690
And Harmony has a cat.

3231
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:53,870
I was like, no, Rascal is kind of the MVP.

3232
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:56,370
Yeah, no, Rascal's the MVP for real.

3233
02:44:56,390 --> 02:44:57,590
Harmony is just a plus one.

3234
02:44:58,070 --> 02:44:59,310
Rascal's where we're at.

3235
02:44:59,810 --> 02:45:01,190
Rascal's the OG, yeah.

3236
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:04,030
Oh my gosh, I love the way they did the drapes and everything.

3237
02:45:04,230 --> 02:45:05,670
That's so... it looks so good.

3238
02:45:05,890 --> 02:45:07,810
Are you writing it down for your next build?

3239
02:45:07,870 --> 02:45:10,670
Yeah, I'm getting inspo inspo right now.

3240
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:14,280
This is beautiful.

3241
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:15,660
This is a really good map.

3242
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:18,560
Thank you to everyone who did the behind the scenes stuff.

3243
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:21,980
I know there's a billion, grillion people that have worked on everything.

3244
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:23,560
I assume so.

3245
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:27,380
It looks so intricate and so detailed in general.

3246
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:28,740
For real.

3247
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:30,560
Oh my god, there's a secret tunnel?

3248
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:31,920
Secret tunnel!

3249
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:34,500
This is huge.

3250
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:38,100
There's so many of these little hiding spots in different places.

3251
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:40,140
And it's a 5v5, dude.

3252
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:42,140
I feel like the one man strat works.

3253
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:43,720
This is a big map.

3254
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:45,360
It's a big map.

3255
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:59,060
I think that's why the one man strat's been working so well.

3256
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:01,360
It's such a big map and such a small team.

3257
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:03,100
You can't defend it from all angles.

3258
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:06,960
And Shatter we've seen killed that dragon twice now.

3259
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:08,800
In two different matches.

3260
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:09,980
In that one man strat.

3261
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:12,960
I wonder if he can get away with this.

3262
02:46:13,060 --> 02:46:15,900
Cause this team SmallAnt's team is a lot stronger.

3263
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:20,080
Yeah, it's definitely the biggest matchup that we're gonna see.

3264
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:21,200
I think it's the most intense.

3265
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:23,880
SmallAnt's team is very good at PvP too.

3266
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:27,800
So it's like, I don't know if he's gonna get away with it like the other teams.

3267
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:29,300
But it is pretty.

3268
02:46:29,860 --> 02:46:31,100
It's a huge map.

3269
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:31,860
Oh my gosh.

3270
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:32,960
There's still more?

3271
02:46:35,580 --> 02:46:36,080
God.

3272
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:38,480
There's more to this map?

3273
02:46:38,700 --> 02:46:39,820
Like, oh my god.

3274
02:46:42,460 --> 02:46:44,320
Alright, but who's the mid boss though?

3275
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:46,160
So true.

3276
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:48,280
Don't let it be a cat.

3277
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:49,540
It can't be a cat, right?

3278
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:50,780
Maybe a mouse.

3279
02:46:51,140 --> 02:46:52,660
Maybe a giant mouse.

3280
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:54,740
I like that.

3281
02:46:55,100 --> 02:46:56,180
Tom and Jerry style.

3282
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,780
Look at the chandelier.

3283
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:00,340
Wow!

3284
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:02,660
Oh my gosh, you're right.

3285
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:03,980
Wait, I see it.

3286
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:05,060
Crazy.

3287
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:07,780
You don't even look up really when you're playing, but it's so beautiful.

3288
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:09,940
You've got all the details and stuff.

3289
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:11,720
We went all out with this one.

3290
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:14,520
This is a really cool matchup.

3291
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:19,140
Right, so if I had to describe these, Minecraft analysis mode on.

3292
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:20,060
Okay, analyzer go.

3293
02:47:21,180 --> 02:47:24,260
We have... Team SmallAnt is mostly speedrunners.

3294
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:26,180
And that's why I think I know them so well.

3295
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:28,400
I'm really good friends with most of the guys on that team.

3296
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:30,560
That's why they're speeding through a lot of the games too.

3297
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:32,500
And they've been winning super fast, right?

3298
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:33,840
It kind of fits their brand.

3299
02:47:34,320 --> 02:47:37,500
But on the other team, it's Team Lifesteal.

3300
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:42,420
Now, most of these guys are on a server together, which is all about PvP.

3301
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:47,480
They love, you know, the whole thing is killing each other and trying to steal each other's life.

3302
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:49,620
That's why it's called Lifesteal.

3303
02:47:50,580 --> 02:47:57,760
So, if I had to be honest, I think that Hanna's team is going to be stronger in the combat side of things.

3304
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:03,860
But it's weird because in some of the games that we've been watching, Hanna's team has had less kills.

3305
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,180
So maybe they're trying to focus on strategy.

3306
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:12,240
But I know that the speedrunner guys, they know how to... they know the ins and outs of this game.

3307
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:13,480
I'm sure they've checked the meta.

3308
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:15,560
They know exactly what's the best.

3309
02:48:15,800 --> 02:48:17,700
I'm pretty sure they researched a hell of a lot.

3310
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:18,680
Exactly.

3311
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:27,220
And, I mean, I think that it's pretty telling that these guys are in the final.

3312
02:48:27,400 --> 02:48:31,940
I know that individually, amongst the teams, they're really good friends as well.

3313
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:35,060
Like, all five of the teams, they have good synergy.

3314
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:36,240
They have good communications.

3315
02:48:36,460 --> 02:48:39,980
They're able to give advice and listen and talk really easily.

3316
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:42,300
And maybe that wasn't true for some of the other teams.

3317
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:43,880
And that's why we see these two in the final.

3318
02:48:44,860 --> 02:48:46,660
Dude, I'm just excited, okay?

3319
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,420
I love these teams.

3320
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:49,200
I'm so hyped.

3321
02:48:49,780 --> 02:48:53,840
Because they've been playing together in all these Minecraft tournaments for a long time now.

3322
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:56,340
So the chemistry must be, like, really tight by now.

3323
02:48:57,500 --> 02:48:59,100
Yeah, this isn't their first rodeo.

3324
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:00,540
They've played these games before.

3325
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:06,920
Team Hanna just needs to be more bloodthirsty maybe.

3326
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:07,860
Maybe.

3327
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:15,420
I think that Team Hanna are better at the combat stuff, so maybe they do need to use it to their advantage.

3328
02:49:15,580 --> 02:49:17,100
Hanna might win via tie.

3329
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:19,320
True, possibly.

3330
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:23,680
Because, like, Hanna's team is better when the games draw on longer.

3331
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:25,760
Because they're really good at defense, what I've noticed.

3332
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:30,740
Just because they literally just depend on one person for offense.

3333
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:35,580
True, and the SmallAnts team are much more attacking.

3334
02:49:35,780 --> 02:49:37,100
They go way faster.

3335
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:39,200
Yeah, they really do.

3336
02:49:39,820 --> 02:49:43,640
It depends on, like, if the game draws on too long or not.

3337
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:50,620
Because, like, the thing is, though, the thing is, though, like, Hanna and Sparkle's team was a very close match.

3338
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,340
It was, right?

3339
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:56,240
But SmallAnts demolished Sparkle's team.

3340
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:59,280
It sounds like they got through that match a lot faster, right?

3341
02:49:59,300 --> 02:49:59,680
Yeah, they did.

3342
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:04,000
They apparently got the first tower within five minutes, which is crazy.

3343
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:05,080
Yeah, that's insane.

3344
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:10,400
I really want to know how important that middle boss is for these winners.

3345
02:50:10,780 --> 02:50:17,280
I know that the matches that we've watched, sometimes that GumGum or the equivalent...

3346
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:19,460
GumGum or...

3347
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:20,900
ForeverGumGum?

3348
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:22,120
I'm not even calling it MidBoss.

3349
02:50:22,220 --> 02:50:23,220
It's GumGum.

3350
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:24,080
Exactly.

3351
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:28,680
I don't know how important that GumGum is, right?

3352
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:32,100
Is it crucial or is it just kind of a distraction?

3353
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,380
It's the money, right?

3354
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:35,440
It's more money.

3355
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:39,900
So, like, that means they get more upgrades for it faster.

3356
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:46,440
But then, like, will it work for them to their advantage with having a head start with the money situation?

3357
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:48,840
Because you can't just farm creep to match it.

3358
02:50:49,660 --> 02:50:55,400
Yeah, like, maybe they don't even attack the MidBoss and they're just going for these zombies and these little mobs around the outside.

3359
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:56,480
Is it equivalent?

3360
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:57,540
Is it better?

3361
02:50:57,900 --> 02:51:01,940
I'm sure that these top two teams have their strategies locked down.

3362
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:03,080
They know exactly what they want to do.

3363
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:05,160
They've already played, like, what, four games already?

3364
02:51:05,420 --> 02:51:08,340
Like, they better have their strategies locked down by then.

3365
02:51:08,500 --> 02:51:11,860
I think both of these teams have played four games and they've won all four.

3366
02:51:12,260 --> 02:51:15,300
So, both of them are undefeated going into this final match.

3367
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:25,460
For the middle, for the GumGumBoss, the winner gets 300 coins on killing that guy.

3368
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:26,860
That is pretty good.

3369
02:51:27,400 --> 02:51:31,900
We haven't seen really anyone getting, I feel, any armor upgrades.

3370
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,940
At least they're not visual.

3371
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:36,320
I think it's, like, I don't think it's a visual thing, I'm pretty sure.

3372
02:51:36,500 --> 02:51:40,140
I think it's, like, I think it's just, like, as long as you...

3373
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:42,000
otherwise it's cosmetics.

3374
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:49,120
Yeah, all those coins can really impact all the upgrades.

3375
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:51,500
Like, 300 coins is a lot of coins in general.

3376
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:54,940
Have you seen teams one without it, though?

3377
02:51:55,300 --> 02:51:59,840
You can go from a diamond sword to a netherite sword with 450 coins, so, you know, it's like...

3378
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:00,980
Oh, that's a lot, yeah.

3379
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
So, you know, that's pretty big.

3380
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,240
Wait, is that the midboss, the oracle?

3381
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:06,620
Nah, that's not fun.

3382
02:52:06,620 --> 02:52:08,560
Wait, I didn't see him.

3383
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:09,940
Yeah, it's just...

3384
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,120
It's like a...

3385
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:13,400
Devs, you heard that?

3386
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:13,960
Change it.

3387
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:15,860
Right now.

3388
02:52:16,480 --> 02:52:17,920
It's meow meow mana, hello?

3389
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:20,000
Like, the enemy should be a mouse.

3390
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:23,920
Look at the little mice that are fighting the little mom mice.

3391
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:25,720
Oh, they're all mice?

3392
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:26,240
Okay, cool.

3393
02:52:27,140 --> 02:52:28,200
Yeah, but the...

3394
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:30,820
Oh my god, that already got some pp, okay.

3395
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:32,400
Oh, they got...

3396
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:33,900
And Feinberg gets one back.

3397
02:52:34,060 --> 02:52:36,360
It's one killer piece for these guys so far.

3398
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:39,340
Dude, that's a hundred coins for the witch?

3399
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:40,620
That's a really good strategy.

3400
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:42,720
It looks like these guys might know.

3401
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:45,660
Wait, you just kill three witches and it'll be over.

3402
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:48,220
Oh...

3403
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:50,960
Feinberg getting 3v1'd, he cannot handle that.

3404
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:53,860
Pyromaniac, pangy.

3405
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:58,200
Blue team is just traveling in a group and stuff, trying to catch them.

3406
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:04,200
I think they know that red team is mostly all solos, trying to farm as much as they can individually.

3407
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:06,700
So they're trying to catch them off guard.

3408
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:09,060
Especially with the map so big.

3409
02:53:09,660 --> 02:53:11,540
How important are those kills, though?

3410
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:14,240
How important does that even matter?

3411
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:16,020
Or does that, like...

3412
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:21,280
I think Silva's just going for coins there so a death isn't really that important, I feel.

3413
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:22,220
Maybe I'm wrong.

3414
02:53:22,220 --> 02:53:23,580
Maybe this is gonna be huge.

3415
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:25,080
True, of course.

3416
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:32,100
I feel like it's not worth it because, I mean, maybe the first death or two but after that they gotta be really careful because the timer keeps increasing.

3417
02:53:32,520 --> 02:53:32,660
Exactly.

3418
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:35,380
Oh my god, there they go.

3419
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:36,380
They're going for the oracle.

3420
02:53:38,260 --> 02:53:38,860
The oracle.

3421
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:40,820
It's like a giant square.

3422
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:42,660
Oh, that is quite cool, to be fair.

3423
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:44,380
That's pretty cool.

3424
02:53:44,420 --> 02:53:44,960
It's just a giant square.

3425
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:49,800
No, it looks like that one thing.

3426
02:53:50,220 --> 02:53:51,060
The beam thing?

3427
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:52,000
Yeah, the beam thing.

3428
02:53:52,760 --> 02:53:53,080
Yeah, yeah.

3429
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:54,300
Minecraft and now this guy.

3430
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:55,260
What is the beam thing?

3431
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:56,640
Oh, it's a beacon, right?

3432
02:53:56,660 --> 02:53:57,780
Oh, the beacon, yeah!

3433
02:53:57,780 --> 02:54:00,140
See, that's why we have you here.

3434
02:54:00,320 --> 02:54:01,340
That's what I'm here for.

3435
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:03,020
What's the technical term?

3436
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:05,500
The scientific term of this creature?

3437
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:08,360
Yeah, the scientific term of this Minecraft item.

3438
02:54:10,100 --> 02:54:13,160
We already see Hanna's team being very aggressive, so...

3439
02:54:13,160 --> 02:54:16,600
Yeah, this has been the most aggressive I've ever seen Hanna's team.

3440
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:18,580
I think that's what they need to do.

3441
02:54:18,700 --> 02:54:23,600
I think that's the right strategy for them because they are stronger when it comes to combat.

3442
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:27,140
You can see Shratta is probably going to take out...

3443
02:54:27,140 --> 02:54:28,440
Is that Rattles?

3444
02:54:28,500 --> 02:54:29,860
I think that's Rattles.

3445
02:54:30,040 --> 02:54:32,500
Oh, Rattles got the 2v1!

3446
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:34,040
Come on, Rad!

3447
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:36,760
He barely lost any HP for that, too.

3448
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:38,360
That's my goat right there.

3449
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:43,400
He was like half HP from biases on the table.

3450
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:45,840
Okay, okay.

3451
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:46,560
Sorry, my fault.

3452
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:47,760
I shouldn't be biased.

3453
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:49,340
You should head... Oh wait, no.

3454
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:51,080
He's not CaptainSparklez.

3455
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:55,380
I was going to say you should head over there and interrupt them coming in, but that's not CaptainSparklez.

3456
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:56,660
Hey, he's in the third place playoff.

3457
02:54:56,820 --> 02:54:58,380
I gotta keep a track on that.

3458
02:54:59,780 --> 02:55:03,400
If he wins the third place playoff, I'm running in there and jumping on him.

3459
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:09,500
It depends on how long that match goes on for.

3460
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:18,000
Maybe we'll be able to see it if TeamSquadLand is able to speed run their way out of this, but it looks like the blue team are getting a lot of kills.

3461
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:19,980
But to be fair, they're always 2v1ing.

3462
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:25,480
I don't see... They lose the 1v1 but they win majority of the 2v1s.

3463
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:26,240
Yeah, that's true.

3464
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:32,900
Rattles was able to take one of those 2v1s, but most of them you're right, they're going in the direction of Hannah's team.

3465
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:34,480
They're all grouping up and stuff.

3466
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:41,300
Hannah's team is just grouping up for kills, while SmallAnt's team is all like, they're all so separated and split up.

3467
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:42,060
Two reds though.

3468
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:43,820
Two reds pushing in on Kaboodle here.

3469
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:46,200
I don't know if she's going to be able to hold them off here.

3470
02:55:46,460 --> 02:55:47,600
Oh, she gets silver.

3471
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:48,560
Oh, she got one of them.

3472
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:50,080
Oh, she got two!

3473
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:50,460
She gets both!

3474
02:55:51,620 --> 02:55:53,880
Damn, these 1v2s are crazy!

3475
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:57,200
I don't know.

3476
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:00,640
SmallAnt's team is going to keep accumulating deaths.

3477
02:56:00,940 --> 02:56:02,440
It's going to be rough for them.

3478
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:04,120
Maybe they're getting a lot of coins right now.

3479
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:04,660
We don't know.

3480
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:07,280
We can't tell about the currency and the mana and stuff.

3481
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:10,920
So maybe they're just farming creep, like you say.

3482
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:14,580
Yeah, but like getting kills also gives you gold I assume.

3483
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:16,560
True, you're probably right.

3484
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:17,880
I'm pretty sure.

3485
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:19,680
Majority of MOBAs is like that.

3486
02:56:20,140 --> 02:56:24,620
I'm pretty sure getting kills is also very important as well.

3487
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:27,940
And if you get kills on late game, you get more gold.

3488
02:56:28,920 --> 02:56:30,380
Feinberg, she's behind you!

3489
02:56:30,580 --> 02:56:31,460
Hanna's behind you!

3490
02:56:32,060 --> 02:56:32,580
Oh!

3491
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:35,280
I wonder if you can hear their footsteps.

3492
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:38,180
Dude, I've got a live feed to Feinberg's ear.

3493
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:38,960
What the heck?

3494
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:39,740
How did he know?

3495
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:42,760
Oh my god, he got the kill.

3496
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:46,160
I wonder if you can't hear the footsteps very well.

3497
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:49,500
Or like, they have an ability to mute the footsteps.

3498
02:56:49,500 --> 02:56:59,780
I know that these speedrunners have definitely got... you know when you first start the game, he comes up and says like turn this on for narrator so it like speaks out what it is you're doing.

3499
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:03,260
There's another accessibility setting that gives you subtitles.

3500
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:04,860
Oh yeah, that went on.

3501
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:09,480
So you can see the footsteps and maybe that was what he used there.

3502
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:12,320
In that corner you're able to see, oh, footsteps behind you.

3503
02:57:12,500 --> 02:57:14,100
Oh, that means there's a person there.

3504
02:57:14,100 --> 02:57:16,380
Maybe he's able to use that.

3505
02:57:16,980 --> 02:57:19,100
Does everyone not play with the subtitles on?

3506
02:57:19,240 --> 02:57:20,020
I feel like that's essential.

3507
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:22,860
I think that's smart to do.

3508
02:57:22,980 --> 02:57:24,240
Like, I definitely play with them on.

3509
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:28,520
I don't know, but these guys probably just started with a new...

3510
02:57:28,520 --> 02:57:31,000
Oh, Feinberg takes a death.

3511
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:33,560
Wait, I think that's Feinberg's ult, right?

3512
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:36,700
I think that might have been Pangy's.

3513
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:37,040
Yeah.

3514
02:57:37,460 --> 02:57:39,060
Pangy's the fire guy.

3515
02:57:39,820 --> 02:57:41,100
No, no, he didn't ult.

3516
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:42,460
No, it was...

3517
02:57:42,460 --> 02:57:43,320
Wait, what?

3518
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:44,100
That was Feinberg?

3519
02:57:44,260 --> 02:57:46,500
That was an item or ability.

3520
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:47,800
Maybe it was one of the lower tier ones.

3521
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:48,900
Yeah, the abilities, right?

3522
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:50,680
They still got abilities and ults.

3523
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:52,680
That's another kill for Hanna's team.

3524
02:57:52,780 --> 02:57:54,780
They've just been killing non-stop.

3525
02:57:55,060 --> 02:57:59,200
I know, it's kind of... I haven't seen any kills from small...

3526
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:03,100
Oh, I mean, there's one right now, but like I feel like the majority of the kills were on Hanna's team.

3527
02:58:03,220 --> 02:58:03,600
Yeah.

3528
02:58:05,500 --> 02:58:06,840
They're not letting them farm.

3529
02:58:07,020 --> 02:58:09,100
They're not letting them like...

3530
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:12,200
They're increasing their time to come back, so it's...

3531
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:12,940
This is smart.

3532
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:16,720
It's elongating the game as well, which we've seen.

3533
02:58:16,820 --> 02:58:19,300
Hanna's team's doing so much better in those longer games.

3534
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:19,720
Yeah.

3535
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:23,160
They're able to farm a lot more, get more coins, get more advantage.

3536
02:58:24,180 --> 02:58:28,400
I think if these teams are evenly matched, I'd always back blue team.

3537
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:31,260
I'd back Hanna's team in just a raw 1v1.

3538
02:58:31,620 --> 02:58:34,300
Because I think their combat skills are much better.

3539
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:35,640
Yeah, they did it.

3540
02:58:35,640 --> 02:58:37,540
Judging, looking at this, yeah.

3541
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:39,520
I honestly thought like...

3542
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:49,400
I thought that Feinberg's team was gonna like, just like roll over them, but like they're making a very evenly match right now.

3543
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:55,380
And we've seen in previous matches that SmallAnt's team goes in very quickly, and they don't have a chance to here.

3544
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:56,960
Like it's... No damage.

3545
02:58:57,080 --> 02:58:58,240
No damage at all.

3546
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:01,760
We would see them like get towers in.

3547
02:59:02,660 --> 02:59:04,380
But now like they haven't yet.

3548
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:06,220
Which is interesting.

3549
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:08,840
Well maybe the Oracle is gonna swing it in red team's favor.

3550
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:17,700
If they're able to get a few kills here, and then maybe take out that mid boss, maybe they'll be able to come back and start farming some better gear.

3551
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:26,100
I think that if that's not gonna be the case, if blue take out this mid boss... Blue is getting the Oracle right now.

3552
02:59:27,460 --> 02:59:29,300
Look out below!

3553
02:59:29,300 --> 02:59:30,000
Look out below!

3554
02:59:30,660 --> 02:59:32,020
Look out below!

3555
02:59:32,840 --> 02:59:35,320
Red team were able to kind of avoid that stun though.

3556
02:59:36,180 --> 02:59:36,840
Oh dude!

3557
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:39,280
Look at how quickly they're taking out the damage though!

3558
02:59:40,580 --> 02:59:41,620
Hannah's destroying!

3559
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:43,360
I think that's her ultimate.

3560
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:44,240
Oh but Hannah dies!

3561
02:59:44,580 --> 02:59:49,260
If red team can crit it out right now, and there's no there's no one to defend it.

3562
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:50,480
Oh run back!

3563
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:51,840
Come on!

3564
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:52,840
Silver!

3565
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:55,160
And Silver takes it out!

3566
02:59:55,560 --> 02:59:57,240
That's my underdog right there.

3567
02:59:57,240 --> 02:59:58,780
That's my hidden gem.

3568
02:59:59,820 --> 03:00:00,960
It's all that matter.

3569
03:00:01,100 --> 03:00:01,880
All of the coins.

3570
03:00:02,220 --> 03:00:04,140
That was a good example of the ult though.

3571
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:07,040
It looked like he was using a macro there.

3572
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:08,320
I know!

3573
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:11,000
It looked like that cookie clicker macro.

3574
03:00:13,900 --> 03:00:15,440
Now I think it's pretty even.

3575
03:00:15,960 --> 03:00:18,260
Red have got... Red can get so many upgrades now.

3576
03:00:18,480 --> 03:00:19,200
What are you trying to say?

3577
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:26,060
What are you trying to confess?

3578
03:00:26,140 --> 03:00:26,680
I don't know.

3579
03:00:35,440 --> 03:00:36,280
I don't know.

3580
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:40,680
So Red got the upgrades but nothing is happening so far.

3581
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:45,720
I don't know how important those upgrades are but Red gets another kill there as well.

3582
03:00:46,100 --> 03:00:49,040
Apparently my chat said it's like a whole entire upgrade for a team.

3583
03:00:49,540 --> 03:01:02,980
So like it actually does a lot but I think like... Yeah 300 coins could definitely get you... Yeah 300 coins would get you from sharpness 1 to sharpness 2 which that's more important than a single upgrade individually.

3584
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:10,440
Because like a sharpness 2 iron sword is better than a sharpness 1 diamond sword so that's massive actually.

3585
03:01:10,740 --> 03:01:12,520
I like how his teammate just ignored him.

3586
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:13,860
Oh there he goes.

3587
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:14,800
He's like Oh!

3588
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:18,920
He turned around way too late.

3589
03:01:20,720 --> 03:01:24,800
Finally we're seeing some tower damage and Blue's tower is getting damaged here.

3590
03:01:25,620 --> 03:01:27,120
So Red are taking attack here.

3591
03:01:27,800 --> 03:01:28,500
Just a little bit.

3592
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:30,680
Just a chip but you know it's something.

3593
03:01:31,300 --> 03:01:32,300
10 minutes in.

3594
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:37,460
Hey anything is helpful at this point.

3595
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:38,380
I know yeah.

3596
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:40,580
In 2 minutes all the towers are gonna get damaged.

3597
03:01:41,180 --> 03:01:47,360
Yeah I was gonna say at this point it's it's gonna be anyone's game honestly.

3598
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:50,720
Yeah it's weight is really close.

3599
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:55,920
It definitely gets much more much more exciting when all the towers get damaged.

3600
03:01:55,920 --> 03:02:00,960
Then it's like really quick to destroy a tower at that point.

3601
03:02:01,780 --> 03:02:03,160
It gets super duper close.

3602
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:06,900
I mean these teams are pretty much neck and neck right now.

3603
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:09,240
They've not lost their game for the whole time.

3604
03:02:09,420 --> 03:02:10,160
I love that.

3605
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:14,420
I love that we're seeing the best of the best play against each other.

3606
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:14,940
Yeah.

3607
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:21,240
And right now I honestly thought maybe one team would have already won.

3608
03:02:21,460 --> 03:02:24,300
Or one team would have been at least significantly ahead.

3609
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,960
But there's no real huge advantage.

3610
03:02:27,180 --> 03:02:28,760
Sure red have a little bit of damage.

3611
03:02:28,940 --> 03:02:31,340
But that can be done in 2 seconds by blue team.

3612
03:02:31,480 --> 03:02:33,360
I think they could easily make this comeback.

3613
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:38,340
I'm so interested to see Hannah's team's player kill count.

3614
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:39,800
Oh my god.

3615
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:42,140
Hannah's team's just been killing everybody.

3616
03:02:42,380 --> 03:02:46,780
I'm curious how many kills their entire team has had so far.

3617
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:52,540
Like I barely see red team getting the kills at the moment.

3618
03:02:52,660 --> 03:02:53,960
But they're still really close.

3619
03:02:54,320 --> 03:02:55,580
I think it's just cause like...

3620
03:02:55,580 --> 03:03:03,740
I think it's just cause like even if they're killing a lot... if blue team's killing a lot of them, someone in red team is farming a lot of gold for everybody.

3621
03:03:07,940 --> 03:03:11,320
Cause like I feel like with the amount of people that...

3622
03:03:11,320 --> 03:03:11,960
Oh my god.

3623
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:12,660
There they go.

3624
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:14,640
Oh nice.

3625
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:17,800
We got a little bit of the...

3626
03:03:17,800 --> 03:03:21,240
Like a fraction of the heart I think.

3627
03:03:21,740 --> 03:03:22,060
Yeah.

3628
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:25,020
I just feel like...

3629
03:03:25,020 --> 03:03:30,480
Cause like I feel like with the amount of people that blue team's been killing, they should be like overrunning them.

3630
03:03:30,560 --> 03:03:31,300
But yet they're like...

3631
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:33,100
They seem like similar...

3632
03:03:33,100 --> 03:03:36,820
Like similar skill wise and gold wise.

3633
03:03:38,320 --> 03:03:39,620
Oh the hiding...

3634
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:40,280
The hide strat.

3635
03:03:40,380 --> 03:03:40,500
Oh!

3636
03:03:42,580 --> 03:03:43,060
What?

3637
03:03:43,220 --> 03:03:43,680
The boat?

3638
03:03:44,260 --> 03:03:45,640
Where did that come from?

3639
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:48,500
Wait, there's a boat?

3640
03:03:48,960 --> 03:03:49,040
Yeah!

3641
03:03:49,820 --> 03:03:50,800
Who was that?

3642
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:51,260
Feinberg?

3643
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:52,600
He just pulled out a boat.

3644
03:03:54,020 --> 03:03:56,480
He's gonna run people over with a boat.

3645
03:03:56,860 --> 03:03:58,380
What does a boat even do?

3646
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:01,840
Oh, there's another fight?

3647
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:04,560
Oh, they lost the fight.

3648
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:06,620
Oh, that's my...

3649
03:04:07,460 --> 03:04:08,580
Oh gosh.

3650
03:04:09,460 --> 03:04:13,780
I think if they take small land out, they can like go for the towers at that point.

3651
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:15,180
I think...

3652
03:04:15,180 --> 03:04:17,160
Both teams have some damage here.

3653
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:20,500
The biggest disadvantage is also this map is huge.

3654
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:21,740
It's so big.

3655
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:26,180
I feel like by the time they get to the tower people would have already respawned too.

3656
03:04:34,600 --> 03:04:35,600
Oh no!

3657
03:04:40,060 --> 03:04:40,920
I think that was Feinberg.

3658
03:04:42,140 --> 03:04:43,360
I mean, it's a 1v2.

3659
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:44,380
Oh, it's a 1v3.

3660
03:04:44,620 --> 03:04:46,040
He's like, I'm gonna kill you.

3661
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:48,000
I think someone pulled off.

3662
03:04:49,580 --> 03:04:50,700
Yeah, I think they're...

3663
03:04:50,700 --> 03:04:53,320
You can see another person heading in for it.

3664
03:04:53,800 --> 03:04:54,860
Feinberg's trying to distract.

3665
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:56,700
ADHD kicking in.

3666
03:04:57,660 --> 03:05:00,800
No, I think it's good to go after the witches though because they're big money.

3667
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:04,180
They're big money but it's just funny to see they're like, witching.

3668
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:05,660
Fighting, I'm fighting.

3669
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:06,600
Oh, a witch.

3670
03:05:07,140 --> 03:05:08,060
Oh, a witch.

3671
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:10,040
Oh, silver.

3672
03:05:10,740 --> 03:05:12,060
Hannah is strong.

3673
03:05:12,760 --> 03:05:13,360
She's scary.

3674
03:05:16,060 --> 03:05:16,900
A witch.

3675
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:21,220
The witches seem like they're pretty overpowered.

3676
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:22,900
You get 100 coins if you kill one.

3677
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:24,240
I know, that's what I'm saying.

3678
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:26,220
Three witches equals an oracle.

3679
03:05:27,280 --> 03:05:27,560
Yeah.

3680
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:30,660
So that's why it's worth going after them.

3681
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:32,840
Yeah, that's why he's like, a witch.

3682
03:05:35,820 --> 03:05:37,020
Oh, a witch.

3683
03:05:37,180 --> 03:05:39,540
gold you... I guess it depends on how late game it is.

3684
03:05:39,660 --> 03:05:43,660
I was wondering how much gold you get for like, player kills.

3685
03:05:47,900 --> 03:05:48,820
No, we don't really...

3686
03:05:48,820 --> 03:05:49,500
Do we see that?

3687
03:05:49,580 --> 03:05:50,720
Does that pop up when they...

3688
03:05:50,720 --> 03:05:51,600
I don't know.

3689
03:05:52,520 --> 03:05:54,000
Because like, it'd be...

3690
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,540
You do get gold, right?

3691
03:05:56,600 --> 03:05:57,600
For killing players?

3692
03:05:57,760 --> 03:06:00,040
Because usually MOBAs, you get gold for killing players.

3693
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:04,100
Yeah, I think we get gold and aura per kill.

3694
03:06:04,200 --> 03:06:09,240
Yeah, because it depends on... The more late game it is, the more gold you get because it's more upgraded and stuff.

3695
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:11,640
These guys are hoarding their ults.

3696
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:16,760
Look, four ults for team red and the blue team, so close as well.

3697
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:18,080
Oh my god, he just 1v2'd.

3698
03:06:19,020 --> 03:06:21,360
Oh, apparently it's plus 25 gold for players.

3699
03:06:21,420 --> 03:06:23,620
Oh, so there's no point in killing players.

3700
03:06:25,120 --> 03:06:30,860
I mean, there is a point, but like, I mean, there's a point, but like, you get more gold from...

3701
03:06:30,860 --> 03:06:31,440
Oh, red!

3702
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:35,200
We've seen it before and he's gonna do it again.

3703
03:06:35,380 --> 03:06:36,360
Oh, gosh.

3704
03:06:37,080 --> 03:06:37,640
Oh, they took him down.

3705
03:06:39,500 --> 03:06:40,880
But it's worth it.

3706
03:06:41,860 --> 03:06:43,160
Oh, they're getting one too.

3707
03:06:43,540 --> 03:06:43,940
Nice.

3708
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:46,660
Okay, we got some action going on.

3709
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:48,140
Oh my god, look how fast he is though.

3710
03:06:48,160 --> 03:06:50,260
All three towers have just a bit of damage taken.

3711
03:06:50,700 --> 03:06:53,680
Yeah, but that red team's tower is almost down though.

3712
03:06:54,700 --> 03:06:55,680
It's like 25%.

3713
03:06:58,180 --> 03:06:59,840
I feel like there's more damage...

3714
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:00,600
Oh my god.

3715
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:02,920
Who was it?

3716
03:07:02,960 --> 03:07:03,820
Who was it that...

3717
03:07:03,820 --> 03:07:04,380
What's his name?

3718
03:07:04,460 --> 03:07:05,820
The guy that did the other tower?

3719
03:07:07,620 --> 03:07:07,760
What?

3720
03:07:07,900 --> 03:07:08,200
Shatter?

3721
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:08,760
Shatter?

3722
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,920
Shatter's damage is insane compared to the others.

3723
03:07:14,820 --> 03:07:15,080
Yeah.

3724
03:07:15,080 --> 03:07:19,400
He almost got that tower to half HP while like... Just by himself.

3725
03:07:19,820 --> 03:07:20,860
Yeah, just by himself.

3726
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:21,000
Oh.

3727
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:24,740
Versus like the red team trying to do the same thing.

3728
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:29,360
Because I think it was Finebird that tried to take the tower and he only got like a little bit of the percentage off.

3729
03:07:31,380 --> 03:07:31,780
Hmm.

3730
03:07:34,060 --> 03:07:35,560
This is a really long game.

3731
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:41,340
And like we said at the start, the longer games are gonna be favoring Team Blue, but look at Team Red here.

3732
03:07:43,420 --> 03:07:44,480
Oh my god.

3733
03:07:44,520 --> 03:07:45,620
One on each tower.

3734
03:07:46,460 --> 03:07:47,680
Oh, they're all respawning.

3735
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:49,520
Oh my god.

3736
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:51,100
That's one tower down.

3737
03:07:51,240 --> 03:07:52,580
Two towers down.

3738
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:55,300
And there's all the respawns coming in.

3739
03:07:55,480 --> 03:07:56,620
Four respawns.

3740
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:58,860
No one's getting silver.

3741
03:08:00,480 --> 03:08:01,420
They all have ults.

3742
03:08:01,980 --> 03:08:02,380
Wow.

3743
03:08:02,380 --> 03:08:03,860
But that's a lot of damage.

3744
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:05,040
That was huge.

3745
03:08:05,740 --> 03:08:07,520
Wait, when did they kill three?

3746
03:08:07,840 --> 03:08:09,500
They almost got a crystal too.

3747
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:10,700
Wait, wait, wait.

3748
03:08:10,840 --> 03:08:11,380
The one guy.

3749
03:08:11,480 --> 03:08:12,140
The one guy.

3750
03:08:14,180 --> 03:08:17,460
I think one guy's gonna take down the one tower.

3751
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:18,340
Oh.

3752
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:27,740
But they almost got two crystals out of that though from the Red team.

3753
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:29,980
When did they kill three?

3754
03:08:30,220 --> 03:08:31,200
I didn't even notice that.

3755
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:32,200
Three of them were down.

3756
03:08:34,540 --> 03:08:36,240
That was a huge push.

3757
03:08:36,360 --> 03:08:36,540
Yeah.

3758
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:38,320
That was a huge push from Red team.

3759
03:08:38,620 --> 03:08:39,560
I didn't even notice.

3760
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:40,040
Oh, which?

3761
03:08:44,340 --> 03:08:45,880
I didn't even notice that.

3762
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:46,500
You don't have to.

3763
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:49,300
I'm gonna kill you.

3764
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:53,420
Shatter is truly a...

3765
03:08:53,420 --> 03:08:55,060
He is a menace.

3766
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:57,780
He's like, get over here.

3767
03:08:58,120 --> 03:08:59,560
I'm gonna have rabbit stew.

3768
03:09:05,990 --> 03:09:09,730
I'm hearing a lot of shouts from my current next door neighbor.

3769
03:09:10,210 --> 03:09:10,970
I think it's positive.

3770
03:09:11,490 --> 03:09:11,950
He's cheering.

3771
03:09:12,150 --> 03:09:13,090
I don't think he's won yet.

3772
03:09:13,370 --> 03:09:15,630
Look at all the towers took damage.

3773
03:09:15,830 --> 03:09:16,710
They're half damage now.

3774
03:09:16,910 --> 03:09:17,630
Oh my god, the half time.

3775
03:09:17,990 --> 03:09:21,010
That kind of evens it back up, right?

3776
03:09:21,450 --> 03:09:22,190
Yeah, it does.

3777
03:09:23,630 --> 03:09:24,510
Pretty much.

3778
03:09:25,590 --> 03:09:31,250
It felt like Red was heavily in the lead and now the lead is being cut by quite a lot.

3779
03:09:34,690 --> 03:09:36,830
That's where the RNG kicks in.

3780
03:09:39,850 --> 03:09:41,430
No, it's all skill.

3781
03:09:44,890 --> 03:09:47,190
I thought that witch was someone coming for backup.

3782
03:09:47,410 --> 03:09:47,810
Nope.

3783
03:09:50,770 --> 03:09:53,610
No time to go after the witch right now.

3784
03:10:03,610 --> 03:10:10,330
He got the crystal.

3785
03:10:10,530 --> 03:10:11,930
Even though he died, he got the crystal.

3786
03:10:11,930 --> 03:10:13,830
And there's a big...

3787
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:14,790
That's the tower down.

3788
03:10:14,910 --> 03:10:16,310
Rattles gets the tower down.

3789
03:10:18,330 --> 03:10:19,810
Rattles gets the 1v1.

3790
03:10:24,410 --> 03:10:26,110
Dude, she got it down to 1 HP.

3791
03:10:28,970 --> 03:10:32,050
Yeah, Smalllands not gonna do a lot of damage here, but is drawing out a lot of players.

3792
03:10:32,410 --> 03:10:33,730
Can he get one hit off maybe?

3793
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:34,630
One hit on a crystal?

3794
03:10:35,070 --> 03:10:35,470
Two hits?

3795
03:10:35,890 --> 03:10:36,290
Okay.

3796
03:10:37,210 --> 03:10:37,990
That's helpful.

3797
03:10:38,410 --> 03:10:38,710
That's helpful.

3798
03:10:38,710 --> 03:10:40,410
That, they're just...

3799
03:10:40,410 --> 03:10:42,630
The crystals are literally like one hit away from...

3800
03:10:42,630 --> 03:10:45,590
Oh my god, the spawn time is a lot longer now.

3801
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:46,630
Is it like 20 seconds?

3802
03:10:47,450 --> 03:10:49,710
But to be fair, the map's so big by the time they get there.

3803
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:52,050
They're basically respawning.

3804
03:10:52,390 --> 03:10:52,770
Yeah, exactly.

3805
03:10:53,590 --> 03:10:54,410
Look out below!

3806
03:10:55,750 --> 03:10:56,750
Look out below!

3807
03:10:58,570 --> 03:11:00,210
Oh, the oracle's back alive.

3808
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:02,930
I guess someone could take out that mid-boss, but it's kind of useless at this point.

3809
03:11:02,930 --> 03:11:04,330
I feel like it's not worth it.

3810
03:11:04,710 --> 03:11:10,750
It's definitely not worth it for Team Red, who only have to kill like one tiny little crystal.

3811
03:11:11,030 --> 03:11:12,330
And Feinberg uses his ult!

3812
03:11:12,570 --> 03:11:14,230
And a lot of damage comes out!

3813
03:11:14,770 --> 03:11:15,670
Crystals down!

3814
03:11:15,990 --> 03:11:16,470
Dragon!

3815
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:18,630
This is gonna be it.

3816
03:11:18,910 --> 03:11:20,430
Feinberg's trying to defend the respawns.

3817
03:11:21,950 --> 03:11:24,010
Defending the respawns as best as he can.

3818
03:11:25,690 --> 03:11:26,310
10 HP!

3819
03:11:27,110 --> 03:11:27,690
It's over!

3820
03:11:30,210 --> 03:11:31,630
And it's over!

3821
03:11:33,030 --> 03:11:35,210
Team Snorlamp takes the victory!

3822
03:11:35,610 --> 03:11:36,870
Oh my god!

3823
03:11:37,410 --> 03:11:37,790
Look at that!

3824
03:11:37,970 --> 03:11:40,350
Everybody in Blue Team was dead!

3825
03:11:40,530 --> 03:11:42,830
And I couldn't even take out the last tower.

3826
03:11:43,050 --> 03:11:43,750
Like, wow!

3827
03:11:44,550 --> 03:11:45,510
That's crazy.

3828
03:11:45,710 --> 03:11:46,550
Oh my god.

3829
03:11:47,550 --> 03:11:48,870
That was a crazy game.

3830
03:11:49,850 --> 03:11:51,150
It was so close, too.

3831
03:11:51,170 --> 03:11:51,610
Oh my gosh.

3832
03:11:52,990 --> 03:12:05,630
It's crazy to see, because Hanna's team basically... I felt like Hanna's team did so well in kills, but I'm pretty sure, like... I'm pretty sure Red Team was legit just farming creeps.

3833
03:12:05,670 --> 03:12:07,390
They didn't care about player kills.

3834
03:12:08,370 --> 03:12:09,990
That was crazy.

3835
03:12:10,750 --> 03:12:15,290
Which is so interesting, because it feels like that's exactly what Hanna's team did for the rest of the game.

3836
03:12:15,570 --> 03:12:22,270
They had less kills in a lot of these games, but in this one, Hanna's team got so many kills, but it didn't really help.

3837
03:12:22,590 --> 03:12:26,990
This was such an important moment, where they were able to take out the Oracle in the middle.

3838
03:12:27,850 --> 03:12:33,170
This round, Team Smolett has 54 kills, and Team Hanna had 35.

3839
03:12:33,610 --> 03:12:34,010
What?

3840
03:12:34,370 --> 03:12:35,050
Wait, what?

3841
03:12:35,390 --> 03:12:36,730
Smolett got more kills?

3842
03:12:37,010 --> 03:12:37,850
I guess so.

3843
03:12:38,570 --> 03:12:40,370
I guess we just didn't see it.

3844
03:12:40,610 --> 03:12:44,590
Maybe the view we had was... I don't know.

3845
03:12:44,830 --> 03:12:47,030
Maybe it was like the spectator.

3846
03:12:47,650 --> 03:12:47,830
Yeah.

3847
03:12:49,950 --> 03:12:51,870
We just didn't see some of the side kills or something.

3848
03:12:52,610 --> 03:12:53,490
That's crazy.

3849
03:12:53,790 --> 03:12:55,510
It felt like Hanna was killing everybody.

3850
03:12:55,850 --> 03:12:56,970
It felt like that, right?

3851
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:59,090
Maybe it was more so in the beginning, too.

3852
03:12:59,270 --> 03:13:05,510
They might be getting kills at endgame, because you know how they were 1v3ing, and we saw those 1v3 kills.

3853
03:13:05,750 --> 03:13:14,030
Yeah, I think late game, they definitely got more kills, but we didn't see them, but beginning, it was all like we just saw Hanna's team killing everybody in the beginning.

3854
03:13:15,430 --> 03:13:15,970
Oh my god.

3855
03:13:16,490 --> 03:13:19,670
It truly is... You can't call the game so early, you know?

3856
03:13:19,690 --> 03:13:20,410
It's anybody's game.

3857
03:13:20,590 --> 03:13:21,110
Yeah, yeah.

3858
03:13:21,710 --> 03:13:23,330
But I was right in my prediction.

3859
03:13:26,610 --> 03:13:27,770
That's my Oshi!

3860
03:13:28,190 --> 03:13:28,310
Woo!

3861
03:13:30,370 --> 03:13:32,710
I'll show you some biases right now.

3862
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:34,470
No!

3863
03:13:35,590 --> 03:13:38,270
Well, I guess we have almost everybody.

3864
03:13:38,970 --> 03:13:42,990
Team Sparklez did win against Team 5up.

3865
03:13:43,010 --> 03:13:45,350
Okay, you definitely didn't hear me celebrating that.

3866
03:13:45,550 --> 03:13:46,730
I don't want to hear it.

3867
03:13:46,910 --> 03:13:48,090
You guys didn't hear me...

3868
03:13:49,370 --> 03:13:51,690
Yeah, he got there in the end.

3869
03:13:51,690 --> 03:13:54,230
Oh, wow.

3870
03:13:55,050 --> 03:13:58,090
Even the overall kills and everything.

3871
03:13:58,390 --> 03:14:02,970
Oh my god, small with 264 overall kills.

3872
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:03,330
Wow.

3873
03:14:03,550 --> 03:14:04,990
That's the highest out of everyone, too.

3874
03:14:05,790 --> 03:14:09,130
Most overall wins and highest overall kills, like wow.

3875
03:14:09,130 --> 03:14:10,450
That's a lot, yeah.

3876
03:14:10,950 --> 03:14:11,890
They just swept.

3877
03:14:12,650 --> 03:14:17,070
The second team was 231 kills.

3878
03:14:17,830 --> 03:14:18,950
That was...

3879
03:14:18,950 --> 03:14:19,970
Yeah, Team TMC.

3880
03:14:20,830 --> 03:14:24,570
Yeah, but still 264.

3881
03:14:26,750 --> 03:14:28,870
That is a lot of kills.

3882
03:14:29,410 --> 03:14:30,510
What is that?

3883
03:14:30,530 --> 03:14:31,250
Over 4 games?

3884
03:14:32,710 --> 03:14:33,670
5 games is that?

3885
03:14:33,770 --> 03:14:36,470
5 different games and that's 264 kills?

3886
03:14:36,850 --> 03:14:37,210
Yeah.

3887
03:14:37,510 --> 03:14:38,610
That's so many.

3888
03:14:38,830 --> 03:14:41,010
Within 5 games?

3889
03:14:41,090 --> 03:14:43,170
That's so much for 5 games in general.

3890
03:14:43,830 --> 03:14:46,610
Which is very crazy to see.

3891
03:14:48,830 --> 03:14:52,450
We're still waiting on one more team or one more match.

3892
03:14:53,930 --> 03:14:55,410
One final match.

3893
03:14:55,650 --> 03:14:55,810
Yeah.

3894
03:14:56,750 --> 03:14:58,310
Who's the last final match?

3895
03:14:58,890 --> 03:15:02,130
It's Team Snifferish versus Team Shubble.

3896
03:15:03,930 --> 03:15:06,290
Oh, beautiful.

3897
03:15:06,450 --> 03:15:06,750
Look at this.

3898
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:08,290
We get to see the rematches.

3899
03:15:08,910 --> 03:15:09,370
Gum Gum!

3900
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:11,090
We love you, Gum Gum!

3901
03:15:11,090 --> 03:15:11,730
Gum Gum!

3902
03:15:12,790 --> 03:15:13,310
Yeah.

3903
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:17,030
If Gum Gum had a concert, I would be there.

3904
03:15:17,250 --> 03:15:17,510
Yeah.

3905
03:15:20,070 --> 03:15:21,390
Bring back Gum.

3906
03:15:21,470 --> 03:15:23,790
Replace all the Mii Boss with Gum Gum.

3907
03:15:24,370 --> 03:15:24,790
Honestly.

3908
03:15:25,330 --> 03:15:27,350
Give the people what they want.

3909
03:15:27,630 --> 03:15:36,550
In the next MCL, you aren't gonna have any Minecraft Pro Analysis because I'm gonna be there and I'm gonna just be protecting Gum Gum the whole time.

3910
03:15:36,710 --> 03:15:37,990
I'm not even gonna be trying.

3911
03:15:37,990 --> 03:15:40,510
I'm gonna be surrounding Gum Gum.

3912
03:15:40,630 --> 03:15:41,930
Yep, that's it.

3913
03:15:41,930 --> 03:15:42,330
I'm telling you.

3914
03:15:42,390 --> 03:15:43,910
I'm making it out the trenches.

3915
03:15:44,450 --> 03:15:46,330
Gum Gum bodyguard.

3916
03:15:46,610 --> 03:15:50,390
You gotta get through the VTuber casting to get in the tournament.

3917
03:15:52,190 --> 03:15:53,310
This was your test.

3918
03:15:53,930 --> 03:15:54,970
This was his test.

3919
03:15:56,310 --> 03:15:57,250
And once again...

3920
03:15:57,250 --> 03:16:00,490
It's just because they can't have two Captain Sparkles in the tournament.

3921
03:16:01,150 --> 03:16:01,350
True.

3922
03:16:04,110 --> 03:16:06,790
Only one Captain Sparkles per tournament.

3923
03:16:08,730 --> 03:16:10,670
No British allowed.

3924
03:16:10,930 --> 03:16:15,090
We should have like a whole Sparkles team.

3925
03:16:15,350 --> 03:16:16,370
Captain Sparkles.

3926
03:16:16,890 --> 03:16:18,110
Major Sparkles.

3927
03:16:19,590 --> 03:16:24,550
I like how you said Major Sparkles before British Sparkles.

3928
03:16:24,830 --> 03:16:26,510
Admiral Sparkles.

3929
03:16:28,390 --> 03:16:29,990
Private Sparkles.

3930
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:30,770
Yeah, exactly.

3931
03:16:32,150 --> 03:16:33,430
That's the Gum Gum guard.

3932
03:16:33,430 --> 03:16:35,530
The Gum Gum guard.

3933
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:37,570
The Sparkle guard.

3934
03:16:37,970 --> 03:16:38,770
The Sparkle guard.

3935
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:42,910
Which was your favorite map, Doki?

3936
03:16:43,690 --> 03:16:45,170
I think... Oh, that's hard.

3937
03:16:45,390 --> 03:16:46,790
I think I like Gum Gum.

3938
03:16:50,050 --> 03:16:54,630
That map was unique because it was like really, you know...

3939
03:16:55,250 --> 03:16:56,570
There's high ground and low ground.

3940
03:16:56,610 --> 03:16:57,490
Yeah, exactly.

3941
03:16:57,930 --> 03:17:04,650
I mean, it was big with the low ground stuff but I feel like... I think the last map was huge.

3942
03:17:05,250 --> 03:17:07,710
There's so much going on.

3943
03:17:08,230 --> 03:17:08,670
Huge.

3944
03:17:09,230 --> 03:17:11,010
I feel bad for the spectators.

3945
03:17:12,010 --> 03:17:15,030
Computers, the render distance is maxed out.

3946
03:17:16,390 --> 03:17:18,870
There's so many things to look at, too.

3947
03:17:19,810 --> 03:17:22,570
There's so many things happening at the same time, so it's hard to capture.

3948
03:17:22,830 --> 03:17:24,730
There were tunnels, too, for the last map.

3949
03:17:24,850 --> 03:17:27,130
There were so many things going on.

3950
03:17:27,730 --> 03:17:33,830
Maybe that's why we missed some of the kills because obviously Team Smallland ended up getting more kills than Team Hanna, but...

3951
03:17:33,830 --> 03:17:35,270
It could have been also late game.

3952
03:17:35,970 --> 03:17:39,150
Yeah, 100% believe it was a lot of late game kills, too.

3953
03:17:39,790 --> 03:17:42,750
I guess that creep really helped Team Smallland.

3954
03:17:42,850 --> 03:17:45,330
Getting that mid boss was able to get them a load of upgrades.

3955
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:51,310
And there it is.

3956
03:17:52,470 --> 03:17:53,350
Team won!

3957
03:17:53,590 --> 03:17:54,030
Wow!

3958
03:17:55,150 --> 03:17:56,370
There it is!

3959
03:17:56,370 --> 03:17:58,450
That was pretty... That was a clean kill, too.

3960
03:17:58,550 --> 03:17:58,870
At the end.

3961
03:17:59,470 --> 03:18:03,810
That was pretty exciting to be our first co-casting in Minecraft tournament.

3962
03:18:04,610 --> 03:18:05,930
Sorry, trio casting.

3963
03:18:08,050 --> 03:18:08,770
Oh yeah, trio.

3964
03:18:08,990 --> 03:18:09,530
Thank you!

3965
03:18:10,770 --> 03:18:11,650
Analysis expert.

3966
03:18:11,970 --> 03:18:12,710
Hey, that's me.

3967
03:18:12,830 --> 03:18:13,390
Thank you.

3968
03:18:15,370 --> 03:18:16,270
Thanks for having me.

3969
03:18:16,650 --> 03:18:16,990
Yeah!

3970
03:18:17,470 --> 03:18:21,930
Thanks for giving us the analysis and telling us what was going on, too.

3971
03:18:21,990 --> 03:18:23,290
In a more professional manner.

3972
03:18:23,290 --> 03:18:24,110
I know.

3973
03:18:24,650 --> 03:18:30,230
I'm just trying to help you guys out and make sure that everyone understands what's going on whenever I can.

3974
03:18:30,330 --> 03:18:31,450
Thank you guys for having me.

3975
03:18:32,670 --> 03:18:33,850
I'm jealous, man.

3976
03:18:33,890 --> 03:18:35,150
You guys got these little VTubers.

3977
03:18:35,250 --> 03:18:35,550
Look at you.

3978
03:18:35,590 --> 03:18:36,370
You're dancing around.

3979
03:18:37,090 --> 03:18:39,130
You can technically dance around.

3980
03:18:39,430 --> 03:18:39,670
Yeah!

3981
03:18:40,710 --> 03:18:41,770
I have been.

3982
03:18:41,970 --> 03:18:47,530
I've been sitting here.

3983
03:18:47,630 --> 03:18:52,730
I've had my webcam on the whole time just so that I could pretend I was on the screen.

3984
03:18:52,730 --> 03:18:53,450
For who?

3985
03:18:54,770 --> 03:18:55,870
Literally for me.

3986
03:18:56,510 --> 03:18:56,630
Ah!

3987
03:18:58,430 --> 03:18:59,230
Flash!

3988
03:19:00,530 --> 03:19:01,330
Flash!

3989
03:19:01,850 --> 03:19:03,410
That's so funny.

3990
03:19:05,710 --> 03:19:07,190
Oh my god.

3991
03:19:07,330 --> 03:19:08,370
It literally...

3992
03:19:08,370 --> 03:19:10,950
I felt like Five Nights at Freddy's jump scare.

3993
03:19:11,530 --> 03:19:12,910
British jump scare.

3994
03:19:13,870 --> 03:19:14,810
Oh my god.

3995
03:19:15,010 --> 03:19:17,130
Oh my god.

3996
03:19:17,770 --> 03:19:19,110
Flash bang.

3997
03:19:21,510 --> 03:19:21,730
Oh my god.

3998
03:19:22,510 --> 03:19:23,730
Flash bang.

3999
03:19:24,430 --> 03:19:26,430
Oh my god.

4000
03:19:29,630 --> 03:19:33,300
I wasn't expecting that.

4001
03:19:34,060 --> 03:19:35,120
That was amazing.

4002
03:19:36,420 --> 03:19:37,740
Oh my god.

4003
03:19:37,860 --> 03:19:38,920
What a jump scare.

4004
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:43,580
I almost got a little afraid that we're going to go 3D for a while.

4005
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:46,280
No, relax.

4006
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:47,620
It's okay.

4007
03:19:48,720 --> 03:19:49,780
I'm not ready.

4008
03:19:49,780 --> 03:19:53,000
I'm not ready to be in 2D form for a little longer.

4009
03:19:55,060 --> 03:19:56,540
That was fun.

4010
03:19:56,660 --> 03:20:01,040
I had a great time co-casting or trio casting with all of you guys.

4011
03:20:01,220 --> 03:20:02,940
Thank you for inviting us.

4012
03:20:03,560 --> 03:20:04,840
Thank you for having us.

4013
03:20:05,580 --> 03:20:07,840
Congrats to Team Small Land!

4014
03:20:12,460 --> 03:20:16,980
If we ever have any speedrun...

4015
03:20:16,980 --> 03:20:20,640
If we ever do another speedrun hardcore we'll come to you for advice.

4016
03:20:20,640 --> 03:20:22,160
I will be there no matter what.

4017
03:20:22,300 --> 03:20:23,760
I promise you.

4018
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:24,640
I will be there.

4019
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:26,700
Don't watch.

4020
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:27,940
I'm going to ban you from my channel.

4021
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:31,240
I'm not allowed to watch anymore.

4022
03:20:31,680 --> 03:20:33,900
We will be in Minecraft a second time.

4023
03:20:34,660 --> 03:20:36,320
I believe in you guys.

4024
03:20:36,940 --> 03:20:38,540
Just don't watch us.

4025
03:20:39,300 --> 03:20:40,600
I'll close my eyes.

4026
03:20:41,680 --> 03:20:42,600
I'll listen.

4027
03:20:43,260 --> 03:20:44,920
You need to do this next.

4028
03:20:44,940 --> 03:20:45,820
Don't even listen.

4029
03:20:45,820 --> 03:20:48,100
I'm not going to ban at 0%.

4030
03:20:48,100 --> 03:20:48,460
Fine.

4031
03:20:51,300 --> 03:20:51,900
Don't worry.

4032
03:20:51,960 --> 03:20:53,000
Everything will be okay.

4033
03:20:53,980 --> 03:20:56,880
We just don't want you to steal our strats.

4034
03:20:57,420 --> 03:20:58,140
I can't.

4035
03:20:58,700 --> 03:21:01,180
We have some of our own secret strats.

4036
03:21:02,100 --> 03:21:04,500
We don't want that exposed to the world.

4037
03:21:04,680 --> 03:21:05,980
I think you guys are a bit too good.

4038
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:08,360
If I tried to copy your strats, I think you'd win.

4039
03:21:08,940 --> 03:21:10,460
Here, I'll get you in on a secret.

4040
03:21:11,860 --> 03:21:15,180
One of them is to just kill yourself if you don't feel the vibe.

4041
03:21:15,900 --> 03:21:16,660
That's true.

4042
03:21:17,820 --> 03:21:19,280
You know what the crazy thing is?

4043
03:21:19,400 --> 03:21:21,200
That's actually a real strat as well.

4044
03:21:21,260 --> 03:21:22,800
I'll tell you about that another time.

4045
03:21:23,020 --> 03:21:25,080
Oh my god.

4046
03:21:26,240 --> 03:21:27,320
I believe you.

4047
03:21:27,400 --> 03:21:29,500
Do you have anything else you'd like to say?

4048
03:21:30,100 --> 03:21:32,360
No, I just want to say a massive thank you to you two.

4049
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:34,460
It's been an amazing vibe.

4050
03:21:35,280 --> 03:21:39,640
I've been over the moon being able to jump around, talk around with you guys.

4051
03:21:39,900 --> 03:21:44,580
You guys have brought the absolute most hype that we've ever seen to a Minecraft event, I think.

4052
03:21:44,900 --> 03:21:48,420
We need to have more casters that are like you guys.

4053
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:51,280
Just excited and shit.

4054
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:52,620
It's been awesome!

4055
03:21:53,880 --> 03:21:54,720
I love that.

4056
03:21:55,980 --> 03:21:57,400
It's been so exciting.

4057
03:21:57,900 --> 03:22:00,820
If there was three of me, it wouldn't work, right?

4058
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:03,220
I'd just be yapping about statistics.

4059
03:22:03,220 --> 03:22:04,940
Oh my god, can we have three British people?

4060
03:22:05,480 --> 03:22:05,820
Right?

4061
03:22:07,800 --> 03:22:10,060
You needed to balance me out and I loved it.

4062
03:22:10,060 --> 03:22:12,700
It was a great balance, so thank you guys for having me on.

4063
03:22:12,760 --> 03:22:14,160
I've absolutely loved it.

4064
03:22:14,240 --> 03:22:16,460
Yeah, thanks for all the analysis.

4065
03:22:17,340 --> 03:22:18,960
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4066
03:22:19,880 --> 03:22:23,080
But also, I think you were supposed to say something too.

4067
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:24,960
Oh, am I supposed to say something?

4068
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:27,280
One more shout out.

4069
03:22:27,980 --> 03:22:29,500
Yeah, okay, sorry.

4070
03:22:29,660 --> 03:22:31,000
That was my segue for you.

4071
03:22:31,880 --> 03:22:35,760
Dude, you can try your best, but more importantly, shout out to you two.

4072
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:41,540
But also, thank you very much to H&R Block for making amazing things happen in gaming.

4073
03:22:41,980 --> 03:22:42,200
Woo!

4074
03:22:42,740 --> 03:22:47,340
Make sure to go to Lunar Client and check out the free HRB cosmetics.

4075
03:22:47,980 --> 03:22:51,220
And remember, with H&R Block, it's better with Block.

4076
03:22:51,340 --> 03:22:52,080
Thank you guys.

4077
03:22:52,680 --> 03:22:52,800
Woo!

4078
03:22:53,820 --> 03:22:59,820
Remember to use exclamation point Lunar in both Min and I's chat to see more details about it.

4079
03:22:59,980 --> 03:23:00,520
Yeah!

4080
03:23:01,180 --> 03:23:02,360
Thank you guys!

4081
03:23:02,360 --> 03:23:03,440
That is so real.
