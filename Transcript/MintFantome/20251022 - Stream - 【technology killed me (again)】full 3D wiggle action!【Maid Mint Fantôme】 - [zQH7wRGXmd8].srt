54
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,610

Thank you.

57
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:22,850
Oh, yeah.

58
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,130
See, I still have quite a bit.

59
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,250
Seven.

60
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,410
I still have quite a bit that I need to unlock, so, you know.

61
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,210
Whoa, wow, my arm is crazy.

62
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,330
Still quite a bit.

64
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,950
Yeah.

65
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,630
Have you escaped yet?

66
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,290
No, I haven't escaped.

67
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,670
So maybe that's...

68
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,430
See, see, actually, I don't...

69
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,510
Oh, wait, I have to collect all the bones, right?

70
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,350
But I don't know what this key does.

71
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,370
So that's your final reward.

72
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,390
I still haven't decided when you'll get it.

73
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:33,570
I had I had like many bones at one point I have many bones I had like maybe four bones and then but I died really fast because it gave me like three bones and then I bought a bone and I had four bones and I was like wow my debt is huge So, uh, yeah.

74
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,490
But, I don't know, I just kind of want to play.

75
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,050
Um, uh, I just kind of want to play.

76
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,530
Head empty.

77
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,810
No, no thoughts.

78
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,030
Just gamble.

79
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,250
Jackpot.

80
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,590
Jackpot.

81
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,930
That's what I'm thinking.

82
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,210
Nah.

83
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,270
First time tuning in.

84
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,290
Oh no, Hiro!

85
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,110
I'm sorry!

86
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,430
I'm so...

87
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,530
This is like the worst time to see me.

88
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,070
This is maybe the worst impression ever.

89
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,150
Maybe.

90
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,810
Oh, but thank you.

91
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,630
Thank you so much for the super chat.

92
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,650
Thank you, thank you.

93
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:21,830
Alrighty.

94
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,390
Well, do I want anything?

95
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,190
I'm gonna grab that.

96
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,450
I don't think I've tried it before.

97
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,690
Hmm.

98
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,490
Hi, dog.

99
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,230
I'm just happy to spend some koala tea time with you.

100
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,810
Koala tea time.

101
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,230
Tea time!

102
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,950
What did this do again?

103
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,070
Sorry.

104
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:45,690
Oh, no.

105
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,210
I'm, like, in that kind of mood where I just do stuff and I don't know what it even means.

106
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,830
Get to school.

107
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,410
What happens if you rotate on my head?

108
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:11,990
Like that?

109
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,250
Why am I disappearing?

110
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,150
Where am I going?

111
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,190
Wait, why is my skirt flipped up?

112
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,110
Where am I going?

113
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,570
Oh, excuse me.

114
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,130
Oh gosh.

115
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,050
3D.

116
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,270
3D, man.

117
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,350
For some reason, it won't let me turn anymore.

118
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,290
Guys, can I show you...

119
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,650
Can I show you what's going on underneath the desk?

120
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,430
Can I show you?

121
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,480
Yeah?

122
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,200
Okay.

123
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,640
One moment, please.

124
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Hold on.

125
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,340
I want to make a better...

126
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm gonna... Ah!

127
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,480
Ah, hold on, I want to make a better face.

128
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:06,920
Ah!

129
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,590
Wait, I wonder if it'll show up here.

130
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,000
This is peak.

131
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,300
This is ideal gaming.

132
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,350
This is how I play the game.

133
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,360
Guys?

134
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,320
Isn't this how you guys game at home?

135
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,580
Okay, we'll just keep it like this for now, then.

136
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Alright, press the button.

137
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,160
Slam!

138
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,990
Wait, what does that mean again?

139
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,470
Sorry, hold on.

140
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,410
For every round, uh...

141
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,810
You gain one extra spin with seven log.

142
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,090
Oh, so it's like...

143
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,990
This is like the coin, but bad.

144
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,810
Oh, it's ancient coin, that's why.

145
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,730
I wonder if I can extend even more.

146
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,030
Oh!

147
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,830
Everybody was kung fu fighting!

148
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,050
Hiya!

149
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,930
Sorry, I'm blocking the spinner.

150
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,570
About to hit that thunderstabbing.

151
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,040
Oh, sorry, I accidentally clicked on something.

152
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm trying to exit out of it.

153
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
I'm just doing the splits now.

154
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Okay, this is, this works.

155
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,560
This works, this works.

156
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,300
I wish I could turn though.

157
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,500
There she goes.

158
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,420
You didn't see anything sussy, right?

159
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Hold on.

160
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,060
I can't figure out how to turn!

161
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,180
Guys.

162
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,080
Everything is so bad today.

163
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,320
I can't even play the game.

164
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,320
I'm so distracted.

165
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,730
I figured it out!

166
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Where'd my leg go?

167
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,660
Oh, there it is.

168
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,680
Okay, this is better.

169
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,680
Okay, what we're doing?

170
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,420
Grabbing my money?

171
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,760
Depositing my money?

172
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,950
Deposit?

173
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,150
And spin!

174
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

175
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:25,630
Yeah, yeah!

176
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,890
Just do it!

177
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,650
Pull!

178
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:30,970
Woohoo!

179
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,850
Paul!

180
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,250
Oh!

181
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,710
Paul!

182
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,690
Oh.

183
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,610
Yippee!

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,820
I don't think I want any of these.

226
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,680

230
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,580

Okay, anyway, back to game.

Don't look at how I'm sitting.

246
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,600
Don't look at how I'm sitting, okay.

247
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,800
Why am I lagging?

248
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,700

258
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,340
Sorry, I'm so distracted because I can't focus.

259
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,380

There we go.

263
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,480
Okay, I had to realign my thing.

264
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,780
Let's see.

265
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,620
I don't feel like anything here was...

266
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,440
the lemon would be good.

267
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,680
I could get it for free, I guess.

268
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,560
Maybe every time I...

269
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Why did I do that?

270
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,080
I did, I did it wrong.

271
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,640
Why, why did I do that?

272
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,540
Let's just, let's just do this.

273
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,280

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,140
That wasn't so bad.

295
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,060
Could have been way worse.

296
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,700
Could have been way worse.

297
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,680
