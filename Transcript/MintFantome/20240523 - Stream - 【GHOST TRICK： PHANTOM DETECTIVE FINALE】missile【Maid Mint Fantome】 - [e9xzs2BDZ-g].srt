1
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,650
Oh gosh...

2
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,870
Welcome back, Master!

3
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:03,530
Welcome back to Ghost Trek!

4
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,730
My guitar is next to the five kippins.

5
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,750
Thank you!

6
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,610
Hello, hello...

7
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,770
My voice is kind of icky today.

8
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,590
Oh my goodness.

9
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,370
Maybe I've been talking too much recently.

10
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,370
I'm so excited to finish the game!

11
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,730
Yippee!

12
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,630
Thanks for the 10 gifted Star Creators!

13
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,290
Thanks for the 10 gifted Star Creators!

14
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,610
10 gifted!

15
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,590
Thank you guys!

16
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,310
Thank you so much!

17
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,470
Not great for a VA heavy game.

18
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,070
That's okay.

19
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,630
I think we'll persevere.

20
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,810
I think so.

21
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,650
What else?

22
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,390
What was I going to say?

23
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,460
I don't remember.

24
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,360
I think...

25
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,260
Oh!

26
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,440
I was messing around with some stuff.

27
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,660
You might notice some differences.

28
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,620
Maybe they're not so obvious, though.

29
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,660
Maybe.

30
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Spankin' time!

31
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

32
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,460
Thank you so much!

33
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,140
Thank you.

34
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,380
I think my voice is all wacky because I...

35
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,560
I haven't really spoken today.

36
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,900
Hold on.

37
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,710
I'm quite unobservant.

38
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,470
It's okay.

39
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,210
I'm a gamer with OBS or...

40
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:47,790
No.

41
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,130
With me!

42
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,810
Did you cut your hair?

43
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,630
No.

44
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,790
It's still so flowy.

45
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,270
Did you get a new haircut?

46
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,230
No!

47
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,050
You're extra cute today.

48
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,140
You're higher up.

49
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,160
Oh, am I too high?

50
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,380
Let me...

51
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,200
There we are.

52
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,060
Zemir is extra cute today.

53
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,460
Okay.

54
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,760
Why...

55
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,620
Why both of you saying that?

56
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,540
Was this an orchestrated effort?

57
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
I don't appreciate it.

58
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,880
I don't appreciate this.

59
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,120
But what I do appreciate is beating the game!

60
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,860
Woohoo!

61
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,900
We're on...

62
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,260
Yeah...

63
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,440
Let's get right into it.

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
And we have...

65
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,780
Hold on.

66
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm just gonna go to chapter select because I don't remember.

67
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,760
We're on chapter fifteen.

68
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,340
Fifteen...

69
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,140
Sixteen, seventeen...

70
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,100
We have four chapters left!

71
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
And then we'll break the game!

72
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,060
Yippee!

73
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,220
And I'm excited because last...

74
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,260
Night...

75
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
It ended on like a crazy...

76
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,860
Thank you!

77
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,160
Thank you!

78
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,980
Thank you!

79
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,060
I completed making the homemade memphis style BBQ sauce for my BBQ pulled pork complete with a side of homemade slaw.

80
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,960
How are you... how are you so competent?

81
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,620
How are you so competent?

82
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,300
I don't understand!

83
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,320
Mint is cute.

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,100
I'm overwhelmed by how cute Mint is today.

85
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,880
I can't handle it.

86
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,080
I can't handle you!

87
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,740
I can't handle this!

88
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,160
Okay, so... so... so...

89
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,520
Recap.

90
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,440
We...

91
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,540
Okay, recap.

92
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,020
Recap.

93
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,500
A lot happened.

94
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,900
We found out that the daughter that was kidnapped was not the minister's daughter.

95
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,620
Instead, it was Detective Jowd's daughter.

96
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,200
Camilla is Detective Jowd's daughter.

97
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,280
And that she built a contraption that is eerily similar to the one in that pigeon guy's junkyard basement.

98
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,060
And uh...

99
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,300
The same one that killed Lin before.

100
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,480
In blue guy voice.

101
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,160
Aww, cutie.

102
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,360
No!

103
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
I don't want to be him!

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,640
I don't want to hear his voice!

105
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,580
And...

106
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,000
Stop super chatting!

107
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,620
How...

108
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,940
What do you think about me?

109
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,900
Stop it!

110
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,240
Um, yeah, we hate that guy now.

111
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,260
We hate Shaggy now.

112
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,260
Um...

113
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,900
Um, because...

114
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,320
Uh...

115
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,460
Then we were told to get the music box.

116
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,200
Because the music box has the gun in it.

117
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,580
We get the music box.

118
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
And we figure out that the other guy was...

119
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,460
Died.

120
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Because...

121
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,300
Missile...

122
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,760
Oh, Missile.

123
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,380
Missile died.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
But Missile now has powers!

125
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
Missile has special powers.

126
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,720
Because of some sort of...

127
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Meteorite, maybe?

128
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,840
Some...

129
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,760
Some strange meteorite...

130
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,040
Fell in the park.

131
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,380
And...

132
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,760
And...

133
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,720
Killed the guy that was holding Lin hostage.

134
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,280
Oh...

135
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,820
Um...

136
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,210
And yeah...

137
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,250
Missile better...

138
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,850
Missile better survive this or I'm going to riot.

139
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,210
Um...

140
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,390
So continue.

141
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,630
But yeah, I believe that's everything that happened.

142
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,730
Anime nonsense.

143
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,530
Got it.

144
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,290
Yeah, the Temsik.

145
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,710
The Temsik...

146
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,810
Fell...

147
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,870
In the...

148
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,570
Park!

149
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,870
And...

150
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,570
Uh...

151
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,950
Became Temsik Park.

152
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,890
And that's why the guy...

153
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,170
Was trying to not...

154
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,790
Have people build in the park.

155
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,570
So Sara fell asleep before the last two streams.

156
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,970
So I'm forcing myself to stay awake.

157
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,230
No!

158
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,150
Don't force yourself!

159
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:12,790
No!

160
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,190
Don't force yourself!

161
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,550
Okay?

162
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,110
How does she...

163
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,570
No!

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,650
Um...

165
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,250
I have a...

166
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,610
Uh...

167
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,230
I plan on having a EU friendly stream.

168
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,310
At the end of this week.

169
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,150
On Friday.

170
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,590
So um...

171
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,070
You can...

172
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,710
Watch that!

173
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,110
Mm.

174
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,290
She's our kami-oshi-ghost mate.

175
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,150
Thank you!

176
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,310
Thank you!

177
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,910
But yeah...

178
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,210
Meteorite fell ten years ago though.

179
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,470
Which is still weird.

180
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,610
Weird.

181
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,690
Why is that weird?

182
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,970
Are meteorites on a timeline?

183
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,890
Are they on a deadline?

184
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,400
Oh yeah, and apparently... that's the biggest thing, you're right.

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,420
Apparently Sissel was the kidnapper in the park 10 years ago.

186
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Which makes no sense.

187
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,900
There's so much that we have to learn about.

188
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,440
So let's... let's get to it!

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
Let's just jump right into it.

190
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,720
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited about the game.

191
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,660
2.55 AM.

192
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,280
I would be passed out at this point.

193
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
That was a really wild twist.

194
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,860
10 years ago, a man named Sissel took a little girl named Lin hostage and then was killed by a meteorite fragment.

195
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,300
But!

196
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,820
Didn't Detective Jout say that the guy's name was not Sissel?

197
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,400
Thank you for yapping I got stuck in traffic.

198
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,640
I almost didn't make it so I'm hype.

199
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,980
Let's go, Saku!

200
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,780
Welcome home!

201
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,220
Welcome home!

202
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:44,880
Welcome home!

203
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,460
Nils, thank you for the bank!

204
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,660
No, no one has said that today.

205
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't think anybody will say it today.

206
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,890
Anyway.

207
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,950
And then was killed by a meteorite fragment.

208
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,410
Mint.

209
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,050
Frag.

210
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,650
Mint.

211
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,970
I killed a man!

212
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,670
Tonight, a man named Sissel met a detective named Lin at the park.

213
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,090
At a junkyard on the edge of town.

214
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,950
And then was killed by a bullet.

215
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,190
Oh!

216
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,910
One other thing I forgot to mention.

217
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,890
We forgot the manipulator.

218
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,870
There's like some other ghost man that is a manipulator.

219
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,250
It's not like a twin situation, is it?

220
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,350
Like, that'd be crazy.

221
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:40,990
Cooper!

222
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,470
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

223
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,510
Thank you!

224
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,450
And...

225
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,110
Yeah, he...

226
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,530
Low battery.

227
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:50,870
Hold on.

228
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,510
Let me...

229
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,150
Oh, shoot.

230
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,490
I have a cord!

231
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,030
I'm sorry!

232
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,410
I got it!

233
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Okay.

234
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,050
My controller is plugged in.

235
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,290
What was I saying?

236
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,900
What?

237
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,570
What's wrong?

238
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,150
Why are you guys doing the tehepero?

239
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,550
Nice save.

240
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,510
What do you mean liquid?

241
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,810
Oh, liquid and solid sisal?

242
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,010
I hope so.

243
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,150
Here's to our Oshis missel.

244
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,030
And Minto too!

245
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,270
Thank you!

246
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,890
My Oshi is also missel.

247
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,910
Yeah.

248
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,830
Okay.

249
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:23,650
Okay.

250
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,150
Okay.

251
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,050
Um...

252
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,110
Tonight, a man named Sissel met a detective named Lin at a junkyard on the edge of town and then was killed by a bullet.

253
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,310
And we think that maybe the manipulator...

254
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,350
Well, we don't think.

255
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:46,950
We think that the manipulator manipulated the gun to kill the mom instead of the contraption working as it was supposed to.

256
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:53,830
And then also that maybe we think that the manipulator possessed Lin to shoot Sissel.

257
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,630
Miso!

258
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,010
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

259
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,910
And Smashboo, thanks for the 10 gifted!

260
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,070
Why are you guys gifting so many gifted memberships today?

261
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,530
Why is going on?

262
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:16,250
But the scene I was waiting for me on the other end of the phone line feels like the final nail in the coffin of my lost memory.

263
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:16,970
Okay.

264
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,390
Oh, wait.

265
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,670
Oh, and that's right!

266
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,950
Wait, what is going on?

267
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,270
Huh?

268
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,090
You're a pig.

269
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:24,970
Huh?

270
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,330
Huh?

271
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,230
You're a pig.

272
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,250
What did I say?

273
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:29,850
What is this?

274
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:29,930
What?

275
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,190
What?

276
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,300
YouTube chat story, people are talking about how cute Mint is.

277
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,900
Some people say that she is extra cute today, while others say that she is always cute.

278
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,460
I hate this!

279
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,680
I hate this!

280
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,900
Wait...

281
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,760
I see myself… Sissification maybe?

282
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,740
What is going on?

283
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,340
What is going on?

284
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm going to pull picture the gifted.

285
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,600
I Primack, thanks for the gifted.

286
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,640
Niels, thanks for the 10 gifted.

287
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,680
C2, thanks for the 5 gifted.

288
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh my gosh.

289
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,860
This is the peak.

290
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,720
Oh boy.

291
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,720
Okay, wait.

292
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,860
Also, because...

293
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,200
Also because...

294
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,460
Detective Carbonaro also betrayed us.

295
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,660
He said, you gotta kill Detective Jowd or something by tonight.

296
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,140
He said the deal still stands.

297
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,380
He betrayed us, I think.

298
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,860
What is going on?

299
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,500
Who are you?

300
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,580
Liquid!

301
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,680
There you are, Commander Sith.

302
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,640
Finally.

303
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,700
Huh?

304
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,280
Sissel?

305
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,820
What?

306
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,800
Where have you been, my good man?

307
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,320
We've been looking everywhere for you.

308
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,020
What?

309
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,960
Had a little unfinished business to take care of.

310
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,540
Didn't think it would take this long.

311
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,280
What about your people?

312
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,000
They sure went out of their way to mess me up.

313
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,040
Arigato, arigato.

314
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,060
How are there three of us?

315
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,780
Thanks for playing through one of my favorite games.

316
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,640
This is the first time I've watched a streamer play through an entire game from start to finish.

317
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,620
It's been kind of poggers.

318
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,620
I hope you enjoy the finale.

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
Oh my gosh, thank you!

320
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,080
I say, I believe we fulfilled every one of your conditions in our little deal.

321
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,460
Oh my gosh, thank you guys!

322
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,160
Minto, minto.

323
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,040
Can you say purple burglar alarm?

324
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,710
Did I say something bad just now?

325
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,910
I don't know.

326
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,230
What right do you have to complain about anything outside our bargain?

327
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,910
It's a tongue twister.

328
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,190
Oh, okay.

329
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,090
We can talk about that when we get together.

330
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,570
This will be our last communication by telephone.

331
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,650
We'll arrive in one hour.

332
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,690
I look forward to seeing you, Cecil.

333
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,530
What?

334
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,190
How do you know me?

335
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,050
How, how do I, how am I know me?

336
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,810
How am I standing know me?

337
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,590
How am I there?

338
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,570
Dawn is approaching.

339
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,330
The darkness surrounding my own mystery is deep.

340
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,710
But I know it's always darkest before the dawn.

341
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,590
Did I convince myself I'm Cecil but I'm not actually Cecil?

342
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,510
Huh?

343
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,510
Solid.

344
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,070
Am I solid, Cecil?

345
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,470
Wait, that, no, that is not solid Cecil.

346
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,490
Hmm, yes.

347
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,150
We're nearing the final stages of our little deal, my good man.

348
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,770
Yes, sir.

349
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,610
All preparations are complete, sir.

350
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,630
And we just had a report, sir.

351
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,110
Lights have been spotted, sir.

352
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,150
Lights?

353
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,270
Have they now?

354
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,230
By all means, let me have a look.

355
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,570
My voice being raspy today is perfect for this guy.

356
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,990
Oh my gosh, we haven't seen these guys since the very beginning.

357
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,270
And we're on part five.

358
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,650
Always there, too there are.

359
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,090
A master and an apprentice.

360
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,210
Whoa.

361
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,250
That's a Star Wars reference, man.

362
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,030
Thanks for the clarification.

363
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,600
Aren't we actually right?

364
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,960
And has this been VR missions this whole time?

365
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
Hmm, yes.

366
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
We're very close.

367
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,360
We will now disconnect from the communication cable and have no service until we arrive, sir.

368
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,280
Wait, are they in like a spaceship?

369
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,880
What?

370
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,820
What do you mean?

371
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,480
Very well.

372
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,720
Huh?

373
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,400
Arrive where?

374
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,660
What is going on?

375
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,000
The lamp couldn't gaslight us?

376
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
That's what I feel like.

377
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,260
Wait, it's zooming out?

378
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,560
Oh my god, wait.

379
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,800
Are we really actually on?

380
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,340
No, we're underwater!

381
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,660
We're in a submarine.

382
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,760
What?

383
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:03,840
What?

384
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,280
Nice try, Inspector Cabanela.

385
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,240
But you could never stop me.

386
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,260
Oh my god, he's got an evil look on his face.

387
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,620
Oh my god, what is going on?

388
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,260
He's pretty...

389
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,100
He's pretty alright.

390
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,620
See ya, sucker.

391
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,260
Oh my gosh, evil Cecil.

392
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Solidus!

393
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,160
C'est ca?

394
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,020
Oh my god, wait.

395
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,480
Now we get to talk to Inspector.

396
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,440
So.

397
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,600
That submarine guy and his people have a deal going with me, do they?

398
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,680
If that's the case...

399
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,460
They probably aren't the ones...

400
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,580
Sorry.

401
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,720
The ones who killed me, right?

402
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,840
Anyway.

403
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,280
There's definitely something behind the Inspector's death.

404
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,000
I think I'd better talk to him.

405
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,060
Where did you get that information from?

407
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,310
Oh, he's unconscious.

408
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,170
Hey, do you think you could wake up for me?

409
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:19,890
Wake up!

410
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,890
Oh boy, still unconscious, eh?

411
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,270
Guess he hasn't been dead for very long, then.

412
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,810
See you later, alligator.

413
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,710
Thanks, Angel!

414
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,430
Thanks for the gift!

415
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,910
I'll just go ahead and go back to four minutes before his death.

416
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,510
I'm a little nervous about what I might see there, though.

417
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,270
But if that's where I'm going to find my answers...

418
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,830
Oh my gosh, I can't stop yawning!

419
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,070
I can't run away from it.

420
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,550
I may need to go get some tea or something.

421
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,260
Once the criminal gets the punishment he deserves, the hostage will go free.

422
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,320
Carry out the execution immediately and wait for our call.

423
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,460
Okay, this is what we saw.

424
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
That's a good boy.

425
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,660
That's a good boy.

426
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,480
Gee,

427
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,720
a hostage, sir, is a handy thing.

428
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,840
It gives me complete control over the top police inspector in the country.

429
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,300
So, Detective Cabanela isn't betraying us.

430
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,560
He's sad.

431
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,220
What's the matter?

432
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,180
Why do we have an accent all of a sudden?

433
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
What's the matter?

434
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,760
All those broken bones, smartabit?

435
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,160
He broke his bones.

436
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,800
What's it like to feel pain?

437
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,180
Does it make you feel alive?

438
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,640
Wait, the sisal is dead?

439
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,060
Why are you doing this?

440
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,000
Now, is that any kind of question for a top inspector to ask?

441
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,260
Isn't it obvious?

442
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,780
Revenge, of course.

443
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,100
Oh, my God!

444
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,820
Revenge on all the people who stole my life away ten years ago.

445
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,520
Make me feel alive again.

446
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
So, he's...

447
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,520
Wait.

448
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,740
Is he possessing my body or...

449
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,790
So, wait.

450
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,550
We died.

451
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,270
I'm guessing.

452
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,470
I'm guessing we died and then the ghost possessed our body.

453
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,590
I'm guessing.

454
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,290
I'm guessing.

455
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,130
The manipulator.

456
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,790
Don't be ridiculous.

457
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,230
It was a meteorite that stole your life.

458
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,670
Or have you forgotten that?

459
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,030
Wait, but then that still doesn't explain ten years ago.

460
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,790
Wrong.

461
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,590
I was murdered by all of you.

462
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,870
Oh, my goodness, my throat.

463
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,170
Maybe he has multiple lives like a cat.

464
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,170
Oh, maybe.

465
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,010
Detective Jowd who chased me down and forced me into a coma.

466
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,690
Even though I was innocent.

467
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,790
Lynn, that girl who was right there where I was running.

468
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,410
We were blaming the child.

469
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,690
Lynn, she was just an innocent little girl playing in the park.

470
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,210
Don't push yourself.

471
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:27,910
I'll be okay.

472
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,450
No worries.

473
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,530
If that brat hadn't been there, I never would have thought of taking a hostage.

474
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,370
That's the most self-centered garbage I've ever heard.

475
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,590
And finally, you, Inspector Cabanela.

476
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,050
Me.

477
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,270
If you hadn't done what you did, I never would have pointed a gun at that kid.

478
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,610
Wait, what did he do?

479
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,510
This is a whole lot of victim blaming, Cecil.

480
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,930
You were so proud of your spotless record.

481
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,090
And my case was the one blot on it, wasn't it?

482
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,010
Only two people know the real truth.

483
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,330
Me and Detective Jowd.

484
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,590
I bet tonight's execution will be quite a relief to you, won't it?

485
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:25,410
One of the people who know about the stain on your record will disappear for good.

486
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,750
That's why you didn't help him escape from prison.

487
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:31,990
Objection!

488
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,210
That's the kind of guy you are!

489
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,320
I got nothing to say to you.

490
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,780
You'd never listen anyway.

491
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,890
You're a good kid.

492
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,210
You're a good kid.

493
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,470
Now then, Inspector.

494
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,030
Time to make a big red stain on your spotless white coat.

495
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,690
What the?

496
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,610
Oh my god, he's manipulating everything!

497
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,970
He's too powerful!

498
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,210
This was another condition of my ideal.

499
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,090
To wipe out everybody who knew about Temsec.

500
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,310
Wait, then what about the old man?

501
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:43,950
Revenge?

502
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,090
That's what I'm up to!

503
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,090
None of this makes any sense.

504
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,870
Hey, man.

505
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,430
He's alive!

506
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,370
Mind telling me what's going on?

507
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,870
Inspector Cabanela, he's awake!

508
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,370
My head is spinning, baby.

509
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,810
Am I to understand that Cabanela character who just got shot is me?

510
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,390
Uh, that's right.

511
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,770
And you're supposed to be the scoundrel there who just shot me?

512
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,650
Uh, I guess so?

513
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,630
But you couldn't be, could you?

514
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:23,770
Huh?

515
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,730
After all, the guy in the red suit just walked out the door, right?

516
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,510
So, who are you?

517
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,410
I don't know!

518
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,310
I don't know!

519
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,490
I guess I just have to face it.

520
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,470
I'm not that Sissel guy.

521
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,490
I'm not that Sissel guy.

522
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,870
I'm somebody who's searching for himself.

523
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,830
Poor guy.

524
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,250
What do you mean low battery?

525
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,430
Uh-oh.

526
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,230
Is it not charging?

527
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,120
Uh-oh.

528
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,180
Oh, wait, one second.

529
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,760
Let me try this.

530
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,050
Oh, that doesn't work.

531
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,930
Uh-oh.

532
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,050
Um...

533
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,790
Let me try this.

534
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,190
Oh, wait.

535
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,930
Um...

536
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,510
Ah!

537
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,430
Um...

538
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm trying to charge my controller.

539
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,870
I can't use the Joy-Cons.

540
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,190
No, I cannot do that.

541
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:24,830
Um...

542
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,650
Oh, shoot.

543
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,710
I mean, maybe.

544
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,570
Actually, let me see.

545
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:37,970
Uh...

546
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,680
No.

547
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,400
See, can you hear them?

548
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
Can you hear them?

549
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,820
I'm pressing the A button.

550
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,540
But it's not doing anything.

551
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,620
Why isn't it charging?

552
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,480
It's worked before.

553
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,160
Hold

554
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,620
on.

555
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,040
Let me try plugging it in again.

556
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,820
I'll try it in again.

557
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,840
I think I didn't have it plugged in all the way.

558
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,630
Or it wasn't plugged in all the way.

559
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,470
Okay, now we're good.

560
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,270
I'm so sorry, everybody.

561
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:50,810
I'm so sorry.

562
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,650
Okay, we're good now.

563
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:51,950
We're good.

564
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,090
The light is on.

565
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:55,810
Okay.

566
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,670
And somebody is searching for himself.

567
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,550
Okay, here we go.

568
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,630
Shut up.

569
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,130
Shut up, everybody.

570
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,750
That's why I'm here.

571
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,370
To save you.

572
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,150
At the very least, you have information about that guy in red.

573
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,190
Information I need.

574
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,490
I'm not a clown!

575
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:14,950
Stop!

576
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,150
No!

577
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,570
I'm not a clown.

578
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,670
So you came on a rescue mission now, did you?

579
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,570
Nothing like the sound of that, baby.

580
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,910
Because there's a very important life here somewhere.

581
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,150
A life valuable to this nation.

582
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,490
I get it.

583
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,110
She's cute as a dog.

584
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,450
She's cute as ever but extra silly.

585
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,750
You're a silly.

586
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,210
Colonel!

587
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,930
Cecil, turn the game console off right now.

588
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,010
Were you manipulating my...

589
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,670
My controller?

590
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,650
Okay.

591
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,710
Do your thing, baby.

592
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,550
All right, four minutes before the death.

593
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,590
Okay, trick time.

594
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,410
So, are you a manipulator too?

595
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,270
Oh, he knows what a manipulator is.

596
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,110
Why do we not know anything then?

597
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:18,750
Why do we not know anything about like... you know... I think that's kind of odd, like...

598
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:25,730
Everyone else kind of regains a little bit of their memory, like... not a memory, but like... a little bit of knowledge.

599
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,630
But for us, we didn't even know what kidnapping was.

600
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,470
You know?

601
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,450
How does Inspector Cabanela know what a manipulator is and all that research and everything?

602
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,730
He didn't know his name, but he kept everything that he knew.

603
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,630
For us, we don't know anything.

604
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,620
My man even forgot how to read.

605
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,220
Yeah, we don't even know how to read!

606
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,420
We don't even know how to read!

607
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,740
There's something fishy.

608
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,300
Like... like it doesn't feel like we were human.

609
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,500
Is what I'm getting at.

610
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,160
I don't know.

611
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,920
No spoilers, no spoilers.

612
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,500
I'm just cooking.

613
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,200
I'm just cooking.

614
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,000
I have ghost tricks.

615
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,040
Powers of the dead, yeah, but I can't control living creatures.

616
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,560
Anywho, I think you'd better be very careful.

617
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,960
That guy in red is a manipulator.

618
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,800
Naturally, he knows about powers like yours.

619
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,240
Wait, so if I... if I change something...

620
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,720
Is he gonna... if he realizes you're here, things might get a little sticky.

621
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,820
You're right.

622
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,780
I'd better be careful.

623
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,140
That's a good boy!

624
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,320
That's a good boy!

625
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,180
Hello, ghost yellow!

626
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,680
Hope you're doing well today.

627
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,200
Thank you!

628
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
Thank you so much!

629
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,400
Thanks for the donut.

630
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,220
Hostage...

631
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,180
Okay, we've kind of gotten all this part.

632
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,540
Let's see, what can we...

633
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,660
Oh, look at him!

634
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,820
There's that something emanating from his body.

635
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,560
Is it really the sign of having special powers of the dead?

636
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,360
Okay...

637
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,780
Helmet...

638
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,740
Oh, we can get up to the book!

639
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,020
What is this?

640
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,700
The top of this bookshelf is lined with books.

641
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,800
This one is the top is balanced so precariously, it's a wonder if it doesn't fall off.

642
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,800
How did the old pigeon guy even reach up here?

643
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,480
And I wonder if he makes his pigeon fetch it for him.

644
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,140
The stink?

645
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,600
Nasty...

646
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:49,800
Nasty...

647
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,440
Okay...

648
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,020
What can we do with the helmet?

649
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,880
We can rock it?

650
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,360
Oh!

651
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,820
Uh-oh.

652
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,920
I think he noticed us.

653
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,360
What's going on?

654
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,260
We've never seen the ghost world like this!

655
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,680
So you're here, are you?

656
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,500
He sensed my presence!

657
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,480
Uh-oh.

658
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,350
Me?

659
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,530
Wait a minute...

660
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:20,830
Me?

661
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,490
I noticed you.

662
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,290
You think you can stop me, do you?

663
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:25,970
Oh my god.

664
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,890
He's looking at me!

665
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,390
I don't know why you're wearing my face.

666
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,110
But you might as well give up now.

667
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,350
I control everything.

668
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,390
Damn it!

669
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,610
No!

670
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,370
It doesn't work!

671
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,010
It doesn't work!

672
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,850
Everything, including the life of this police inspector and what?

673
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,010
Wait!

674
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,710
Don't shoot!

675
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,050
Oh my god.

676
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,210
So we can't make any obvious movements.

677
00:35:59,350 --> 00:35:59,810
That's crazy.

678
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,830
This other me knows the powers of the dead well!

679
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,470
Who wouldn't notice what you just did?

680
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,770
You were practically shouting, Look at me, baby!

681
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,890
It looks like it might be hard to save you under these circumstances.

682
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,930
I guess I can't use my powers right in front of him like that.

683
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,610
Okay.

684
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:19,710
Interesting.

685
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,230
I was curious what would happen if he noticed us.

686
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,190
So interesting.

687
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:24,830
Okay.

688
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,170
So cool!

689
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:27,530
Okay.

690
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,270
Oh my god.

691
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,630
He looked straight at me.

692
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,590
It's kind of freaky.

693
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,830
I'm not saying I would do this.

694
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,590
But are we allowed to gift you weapons?

695
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,690
Like are we allowed to give you maybe a sword?

696
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,410
No.

697
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:55,670
As much as I would love to accept that, I don't think I can.

698
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,930
I'm going to Japan.

699
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:56,910
Um...

700
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,270
But also, if this is for Ofukai...

701
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,170
After Ofukai, I'm going to Japan.

702
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,150
So...

703
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,670
I would like the gifts to be smaller.

704
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,450
So that I can fit them in my suitcase.

705
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,570
Yeah.

706
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,750
There and back.

707
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:22,850
Yeah.

708
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,720
Oh my gosh.

709
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,600
That would be awesome to get a sword though.

710
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,440
That would be so cool.

711
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,120
Wait.

712
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,400
There's...

713
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,160
If I open this, will the same thing happen?

714
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,700
Or close it?

715
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,640
Oh!

716
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:41,960
Okay.

717
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,520
We got to wait for it to heat up.

718
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,580
I think.

719
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,860
And go...

720
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:52,950
What's the matter?

721
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,950
All those broken bones.

722
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,590
Smart a bit.

723
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,330
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

724
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,510
Oh!

725
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,190
Never mind.

726
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:01,750
Okay.

727
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,870
He didn't even give us time to...

728
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,410
Oh!

729
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,250
But now we're closer here.

730
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:06,830
Okay.

731
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,130
Perfect.

732
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,830
And...

733
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,290
Oh!

734
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,090
Wait.

735
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,790
Everything is destroyed.

736
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,810
What about a SOCOM?

737
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,950
I won it!

738
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,510
PSA.

739
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,630
Do not give weapons to the dangerous VTuber.

740
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,370
It's not for my safety.

741
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,150
It's for yours.

742
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,850
Look at this place.

743
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,130
The whole thing.

744
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,510
The whole contraption is destroyed.

745
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,050
Is the old man dead?

746
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,890
What in the world happened here?

747
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,250
I think I'm starting to remember.

748
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,570
Something bad happened here.

749
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,970
And now...

750
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,650
There's another death alliance.

751
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,090
Lying hidden here.

752
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:50,850
I knew it.

753
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,610
What?

754
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,330
Another death?

755
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,350
Didn't I tell you from the start?

756
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,990
Didn't I say there was a very important life valuable to the nation here?

757
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,970
He wasn't talking about himself.

758
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,690
I thought you were talking about you.

759
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,490
I'm just a crazy character in a white coat, baby.

760
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:10,770
Oh!

761
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,520
His little bird is sad.

762
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,440
Okay.

763
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,260
Come to think of it.

764
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,300
Where is that old pigeon guy?

765
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,640
Okay.

766
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,460
We don't have much time.

767
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,140
Move it down.

768
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,360
Move it down.

769
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,680
Or...

770
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Oh!

771
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,340
Like that?

772
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:30,980
Exactly.

773
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,080
There he is!

774
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,160
Oh!

775
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,340
Little bird!

776
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,720
Little bird!

777
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,900
This is some kind of a device.

778
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,860
Very astute observation.

779
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,300
Sorry.

780
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,320
My memory isn't working.

781
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,320
Yeah.

782
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,400
Mine isn't working too well right now either.

783
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,080
But I do remember seeing somebody use this equipment though.

784
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,580
I got to open this thing.

785
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:54,800
Yeah.

786
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,120
There we go.

787
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,680
Okay.

788
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
I'm so sad.

789
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,660
It's too sad.

790
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,460
It's too sad.

791
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,880
Okay.

792
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Let's talk to the doctor.

793
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,240
Excuse me.

794
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,770
Are you awake?

795
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,690
Of course.

796
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,270
I never sleep during work hours.

797
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,910
Professor, do you recognize me?

798
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,430
There's only one crazy character in a white coat that I know of.

799
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,950
He hasn't lost his memory.

800
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,110
I'm sorry.

801
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,370
I'm not the type who likes losing things.

802
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,470
But never mind that.

803
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,670
Cabanela, this is quite a surprising guest you've brought with you.

804
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,530
Pretending like he didn't just blow up the place.

805
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,330
Oh shoot!

806
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,310
We're trying to hide the evidence.

807
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,730
Are you talking about me?

808
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,950
Well, this is a different guy.

809
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,450
And I'm his guest actually.

810
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,330
Said he came to rescue us.

811
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,990
Why is the bird there too?

812
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,210
The bird is always with him in spirit.

813
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,050
I'm sure he's in a bad mood.

814
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,510
Unlike you, my sharp friend, he still hasn't gotten his memory back.

815
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,330
Hmph.

816
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:13,990
Pitiful.

817
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:15,690
Ouch.

818
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,510
That hurts.

819
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,670
Anyway, now we'll be going back to four minutes before your death.

820
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,890
In order to change your fate, that is.

821
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,790
But aren't we already in the past, man?

822
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,170
But we can go back even further.

823
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,570
I've done it before.

824
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,350
I still don't see a path to saving Inspector Cabanela.

825
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,650
But if we go back further, maybe I'll find a lead.

826
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,050
Okay.

827
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,050
Oh my gosh.

828
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,590
We're rewinding even further!

829
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,090
Going beyond!

830
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,150
Okay.

831
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,270
Ghost-ception.

832
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,670
What the?

833
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,390
How many times do I have to tell you, Professor?

834
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,830
This place is dangerous.

835
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,140
Don't be daft.

836
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,220
I can't leave now.

837
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,180
Wait, what is he doing with Cecil's body?

838
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,020
He's completely dead.

839
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
But just as I thought.

840
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,760
I'm getting a reading.

841
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,700
This is the source of his powers.

842
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,480
If I remove it...

843
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,600
He's not dead.

844
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,360
He's just not there.

845
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,600
Wait, what do you mean?

846
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,760
What do you mean by that?

847
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,900
The true form of the manipulator isn't something you can detect.

848
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,980
It's a spirit.

849
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,020
Ridiculous.

850
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,640
Okay.

851
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,300
So you figured it all out, huh?

852
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,680
Dun-dun-dun-dun.

853
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,760
Hold on, I have a cool effect.

854
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,480
I have a cool effect for evil Cecil.

855
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:09,840
Cha!

856
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,800
You're a clever man, Inspector Cavanilla.

857
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,020
So it's really true.

858
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,340
Y-you're...

859
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,920
I wasted a lot of time tonight because of you, Inspector.

860
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,920
Spooky.

861
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,160
But it's all just like you said.

862
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,160
I died ten years ago.

863
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,080
This body is just a vessel.

864
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,160
A shell.

865
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,300
I control everything.

866
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,600
The shell.

867
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,780
People.

868
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,960
Just like I controlled the Justice Minister and Lynn.

869
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,860
Evil meant hot?

870
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,600
Wait a second.

871
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,160
So it's true.

872
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,680
You were manipulating my baby that time.

873
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,160
You made her shoot your shell.

874
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
But why?

875
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,980
Why would you do a thing like that?

876
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,280
...

877
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,680
To create conclusive evidence.

878
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,280
You know.

879
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,020
On that security tape.

880
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,400
Now she's a murderer, too.

881
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,740
She'll suffer just like Zhao did.

882
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,020
Go back.

883
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,040
I have to...

884
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,820
I have to do it for the character, you guys.

885
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,500
Now then, Professor.

886
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,840
But imagine, you guys.

887
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,420
Imagine.

888
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,740
I put on...

889
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,060
I put on...

890
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,420
Wait.

891
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,280
Do I have it?

892
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:40,840
Oh, wait.

893
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,200
I don't think I'd be able to get it right now.

894
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,840
Dang it, I can't.

895
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,160
If I put on an eyepatch, I would be just like Raiden.

896
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,940
Evil Mint Kawaii.

897
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,380
I'm afraid it's time for you to die.

898
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,420
I don't have any grudge against you.

899
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,980
I'm even grateful to you.

900
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,520
Doctor.

901
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:07,720
Doctor.

902
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,460
Oh, yeah?

903
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,580
So why don't you let me live then?

904
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,260
I'll be leaving this country forever tonight.

905
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,500
But before I do...

906
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,700
I need to erase all evidence that these powers of mine exist.

907
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,920
Along with the contraption in this room.

908
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,580
Oh my god.

909
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,060
Oh my god.

910
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,580
Oh my god.

911
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,040
Wait.

912
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,180
The bomb.

913
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,620
The bomb.

914
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:34,740
The bomb.

915
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:35,980
Wait.

916
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,840
This time the thing will work the way it isn't meant to.

917
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,300
It'll be all over.

918
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,980
Wait, but.

919
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,740
Why don't you just, like.

920
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,680
All you have to do is like, use your finger and go On the fire.

921
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,600
And then it's fixed?

922
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,600
Evil Mint.

923
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,320
Please come crawling out of my computer.

924
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,520
Ok.

925
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,320
Cupid won't turn this time.

926
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,360
He'll shoot his little arrow this way.

927
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,290
Professor, look out!

928
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,530
How did he know that there was a bomb there?

929
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,370
How did he survive that?

930
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,430
Dynamite, eh?

931
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,710
When the devil did he put that there?

932
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:31,610
That's what I'm saying!

933
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,700
He planned it all out tonight.

934
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,000
Having my baby shoot him.

935
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,360
Having his corpse disappear.

936
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,860
His corpse disappeared?

937
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,780
Wait, 10 years ago?

938
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,580
No.

939
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,200
Oh yeah, when we were sitting there, right?

940
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,760
That medical examiner, remember him?

941
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,360
He was a complete and utter impasse!

942
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,720
I... I said it!

943
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,140
I called it!

944
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
I called it!

945
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,990
Guy is probably in cahoots with them!

946
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:06,890
I...

947
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,440
I called it!

948
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,340
I called it!

949
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,340
I mean, maybe I was being a little judgmental.

950
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,360
But...

951
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:32,640
Um...

952
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,260
I don't know.

953
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,520
He said he was going to take the corpse back to the lab.

954
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,660
But he'd already made a deal...

955
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,540
But he also was acting kinda sussy, you know?

956
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,400
He already made a deal with the manipulator to meet him and give him the body back.

957
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,820
But I wasn't going to let that happen, baby.

958
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,480
You saw through their plan, eh?

959
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,620
I noticed right away the medical examiner didn't know the first thing about examining a body.

960
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,460
He was being weird!

961
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,000
I knew he was a fake, so I tracked him down and bought him off.

962
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,100
Oh my god, dang!

963
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,580
He's a... he's a triple-crosser!

964
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,420
Bought him off?

965
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,260
I had him smuggle the corpse to this room.

966
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,340
Oh...

967
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,460
I thought we could...

968
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,960
Find the source of his powers!

969
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,420
Of course, never in my wildest dreams did I think his abilities were powers of the dead.

970
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,340
Anyway, there isn't much time.

971
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,480
He's leaving the country before dawn.

972
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,160
That's why I have until dawn, probably.

973
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,280
And I'm gonna follow him, of course, after I save you two.

974
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,420
But something's been nagging at the back of my mind.

975
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,020
I remember what Ray said to me tonight.

976
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,780
He said that spirits cease to exist when the day breaks.

977
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,240
But if that's true...

978
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,440
How could a spirit from ten years ago still be here?

979
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,040
Mmm...

980
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,500
Cabanela is ocelot?

981
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,100
No!

982
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,040
The doctor is ocelot!

983
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,860
The doctor is ocelot!

984
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,980
Except he's like...

985
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,960
So inconsequential.

986
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,240
Yeah, I think Ray was lying.

987
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,180
I think I mentioned that last stream too.

988
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,140
No time for thinking now, baby!

989
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,760
Action is the name of the game!

990
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,580
Work your magic and take us back.

991
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,400
Even further into the past.

992
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:37,940
Okay.

993
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,760
If only...

994
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,320
If only they had...

995
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,160
Oh, sorry.

996
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,120
I didn't realize.

997
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,020
I thought I pressed Cabanela's text.

998
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,420
He said stop the explosion.

999
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,760
Foolish of you to say, too.

1000
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,440
If you stop the explosion, he'll just do me in some other way.

1001
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,800
Fair enough.

1002
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,320
Then jump in there and take care of that man in red, would you?

1003
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,300
I repeat.

1004
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,040
Easy enough for you to say.

1005
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,400
And most likely impossible to boot.

1006
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,240
That huge explosion didn't even make him bat an eye.

1007
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,500
We gotta tie him up!

1008
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,720
Well, what do you propo- propose then, professor?

1009
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,800
Pray tell.

1010
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:22,380
Your best bet is to save me during the explosion without him noticing.

1011
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,440
How is that our best bet?

1012
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,700
This puzzle is tough to figure out.

1013
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,780
How...

1014
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,580
How...

1015
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,320
What?

1016
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,580
How is that our best bet?

1017
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,640
Why don't we just tie him up and not let him touch anything?

1018
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,040
Easy enough for you to say.

1019
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,120
Sheesh.

1020
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,280
What's with all these people?

1021
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,540
Anywho.

1022
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,360
Jump in there and do something.

1023
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,100
Okay.

1024
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,760
Okay.

1025
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,360
My guess is...

1026
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,840
When the explosion happens, we open up the door and have him fall down.

1027
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,180
Right?

1028
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,260
So that way he wouldn't notice that...

1029
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:10,310
That way he wouldn't notice that he doesn't die.

1030
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,430
But I also can't move anywhere.

1031
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,550
Oh, wait.

1032
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:15,890
Here we go.

1033
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,950
Okay.

1034
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,510
Fool!

1035
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,450
What do you think you're doing?

1036
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:22,870
Oh.

1037
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,550
I just thought I'd try it out.

1038
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,930
If you do, you're going to set the contraption in motion.

1039
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,670
Just put the fire out.

1040
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,010
Oh, yeah.

1041
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:32,490
I just thought.

1042
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,850
He just thought he'd blow me up is what he thought.

1043
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,150
Oops.

1044
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,070
That was my bad.

1045
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,030
There aren't a whole lot of things I can use my tricks on in this room.

1046
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:45,950
Yeah.

1047
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,610
Exactly.

1048
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,930
Why don't you just set the...

1049
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,510
You can move the fire.

1050
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,090
Fire away.

1051
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,490
I need him to move back towards me.

1052
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,480
Can you turn this way so I can't reach?

1053
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,220
Oh.

1054
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:09,720
Maybe here.

1055
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,540
There we go.

1056
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:10,820
Okay.

1057
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,580
Do I have to wait?

1058
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,100
No.

1059
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,500
I feel like it has to be something else that I can do.

1060
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,700
I'm going to see what happens if I go all the way until the end and drop him down.

1061
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,120
Right?

1062
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:30,560
Oh.

1063
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,580
But he doesn't...

1064
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,020
Stand.

1065
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,380
Oh.

1066
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,500
There.

1067
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:36,780
Okay.

1068
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,940
Now he does stand on the door.

1069
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,240
Okay.

1070
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:38,600
Nice.

1071
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,000
Time is passing.

1072
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,520
What if I drop him?

1073
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:44,800
Oh.

1074
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,720
It's no use.

1075
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,180
I can't.

1076
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:46,280
Oh.

1077
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,120
I can't.

1078
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,180
Could the fact the professor is standing on it have anything to do with it?

1079
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,300
I may look small but I'm pretty heavy set.

1080
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,760
He sounds so proud of that fact too.

1081
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:56,860
This door.

1082
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,760
Such a pain.

1083
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,860
Too bad it doesn't open downward.

1084
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,580
Sometimes life can be so hard.

1085
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,400
Wouldn't you agree, professor?

1086
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,860
Oh no.

1087
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,320
That's why we're both dead.

1088
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,840
The door that opens downward.

1089
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,300
Eh?

1090
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,440
The door that opens downward?

1091
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,480
What is going on in here?

1092
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:15,800
Oh.

1093
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,840
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1094
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,260
Dum,

1095
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,950
dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.

1096
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,070
As he perhaps may have already noticed, time is running out.

1097
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:30,490
In -and -out, baby.

1098
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,370
Sizzle?

1099
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,670
Who is this?

1100
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,150
Sizzle?

1101
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,010
I know that voice.

1102
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,250
Hmm?

1103
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,810
What's with that frail sounding call for help?

1104
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,030
He's here somewhere.

1105
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:13,710
Is it Ray?

1106
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,270
The lamp?

1107
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,090
Missile?

1108
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,790
Oh, it's Missile!

1109
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,510
A little guy that looks a little fragile but has strength that surprise you.

1110
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,090
Well, he's asking you to find him.

1111
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,510
And before he's carried away, no less.

1112
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,510
But I'm almost out of time.

1113
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:30,550
Should I look for him?

1114
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:31,810
Okay.

1115
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:32,510
Uh...

1116
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:33,690
I can't reach!

1117
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,470
Oh no!

1118
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,050
Wait.

1119
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,210
Um...

1120
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,860
If I can stop this toy from spinning, I can halt the contraption, but that won't really solve anything.

1121
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,320
There's a smart boy.

1122
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,820
If you stop the explosion, he'll find another way to get me.

1123
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,780
It would probably give away the fact that you're here, too.

1124
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,340
So I have to rescue you without stopping the explosion.

1125
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,760
Is that even possible?

1126
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,780
That's what has to be done.

1127
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,640
Deal with it!

1128
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,160
Can I reach?

1129
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:18,820
Ah!

1130
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,700
I can't reach!

1131
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,360
How do I...

1132
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,040
Do I just look around?

1133
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,840
Oh!

1134
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,900
Cecil!

1135
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,340
Here I am!

1136
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,780
It's Cecil!

1137
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,620
What are you doing there?

1138
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,760
Do you really have to ask?

1139
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:44,680
Seriously.

1140
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,080
Are you really going there?

1141
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,540
Uh...

1142
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,160
No, that's okay.

1143
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:48,880
Never mind.

1144
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,880
Anyway, I need your powers.

1145
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,980
Will you help me out?

1146
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,480
Of course!

1147
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,220
Okay.

1148
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,780
Here!

1149
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:55,940
Let me come join you!

1150
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,040
Um...

1151
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,680
Okay.

1152
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,540
Very good.

1153
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Here I am, Cecil!

1154
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,700
Wait, but I think I've lost enough...

1155
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,040
I've lost too much time, I think.

1156
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,160
Wait, no!

1157
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,680
We just have to figure out before...

1158
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:13,960
What?

1159
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,320
As the explosion happens.

1160
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:15,980
So...

1161
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,040
We have to figure it out as the explosion happens.

1162
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,820
Maybe things will flow in a new direction.

1163
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,200
Even though that's not the case.

1164
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,140
The flow of the sewer is a little bit stinky.

1165
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,140
Fate has changed.

1166
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,060
Kind of.

1167
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,140
Okay.

1168
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,680
Alright, let's see.

1169
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,740
YZR.

1170
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,760
What are some things that are the same?

1171
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,120
Measuring device...

1172
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,500
Toolbox...

1173
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,260
Motor...

1174
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,540
Is there anything that's like the same shape?

1175
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,400
Okay.

1176
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,680
Hmm...

1177
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,440
Thanks for the super chat!

1178
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,220
The toy cake...

1179
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,600
Is kind of similar to...

1180
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:08,760
The tool...

1181
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,100
Oh, you can't reach that floor though.

1182
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,140
Um...

1183
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,020
Okay, hold on.

1184
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,780
Maybe...

1185
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,220
No, no, no.

1186
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,340
Maybe down here.

1187
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,660
Oh, wait.

1188
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,000
Actually, what about the rats?

1189
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,680
Here, here, here.

1190
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,660
Trash can lid...

1191
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,680
Um...

1192
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:25,940
Trash can?

1193
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,580
What's this?

1194
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,060
Wait, what's going on?

1195
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,660
Those squeaky guys are making a fuss about something.

1196
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,340
Sizzle...

1197
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,520
My animal instincts are starting to surface!

1198
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,340
If you mean you want to chase them, I think you have to be alive to do that.

1199
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,800
Hmm...

1200
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,100
There must be some kind of rat feast in that trash can.

1201
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,900
Those things usually make a bigger commotion than that.

1202
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,780
Bigger commotion, eh?

1203
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,040
What does it...

1204
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,740
What does that mean?

1205
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,060
Oh!

1206
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:58,780
Swap!

1207
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,480
Oh!

1208
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,500
Okay, they're inside the feast.

1209
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,560
What's in...

1210
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,420
What's going on?

1211
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,980
Oh, more rats are coming!

1212
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,120
Uh...

1213
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,400
What's going on?

1214
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,040
Why are there so many rats?

1215
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,120
Now that's what I'd call some proper commotion.

1216
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,700
Why are there so many rats?

1217
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,320
They're...

1218
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,100
They're making that trash can dance.

1219
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,740
Truth be told, I feel a bit like dancing now, myself.

1220
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,220
Oh!

1221
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,280
It's getting harder and harder to hold my...

1222
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,060
Hold my wild instincts back!

1223
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,920
What a dangerous bunch.

1224
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,480
Oh my gosh, wait.

1225
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,040
I have like no time!

1226
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,020
Oh...

1227
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:41,760
Oh...

1228
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,300
What's going on?

1229
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,400
Trash can lid...

1230
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,720
I don't know what I just did!

1231
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,540
I don't...

1232
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:50,880
Wait!

1233
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,160
The trash can lid?

1234
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,500
Oh no.

1235
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,940
I thought the trash can lid and the tire could change.

1236
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:56,960
No...

1237
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,920
Eh!

1238
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,700
Eh!

1239
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,200
Oh!

1240
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,520
Switch!

1241
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,860
What does that do?

1242
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,600
I have a trash can lid here now.

1243
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,400
I don't know what...

1244
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,600
I don't know what else to do with it.

1245
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,520
Cancel...

1246
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,490
Now it's flat.

1247
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,450
And we can switch it!

1248
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,190
Wait.

1249
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,210
We can switch the lid!

1250
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:46,770
Oh!

1251
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:49,490
With...

1252
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,070
Ah!

1253
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:52,210
Oh!

1254
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:54,570
Okay, okay.

1255
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:55,010
I got it.

1256
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,310
I got it.

1257
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:57,070
Okay.

1258
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,150
But we have to wait until it explodes.

1259
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,630
I think.

1260
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:05,990
Oh my gosh.

1261
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,010
That's so tricky.

1262
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:09,390
Okay.

1263
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,350
Okay.

1264
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:11,630
Okay.

1265
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,150
I think if it explodes, it's too late.

1266
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:19,910
You have so much time.

1267
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:20,190
Zero seconds.

1268
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:20,490
Okay.

1269
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:20,850
Switch!

1270
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,870
Look out!

1271
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:25,930
Oh!

1272
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:26,310
There we go.

1273
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:29,050
Okay!

1274
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,370
Easy peasy.

1275
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,650
Oh.

1276
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,270
Cabanela's not dead though.

1277
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,230
He's not dead.

1278
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,530
Sorry.

1279
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:43,750
Oh.

1280
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,210
Sorry, little pigeon.

1281
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,690
Oh my god.

1282
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:51,850
Look at the...

1283
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,170
Look at the position.

1284
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,090
The legging.

1285
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:56,310
As for you, Inspector.

1286
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,990
I have a little job for you.

1287
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,730
I can't move.

1288
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,270
I think I have four or five broken bones.

1289
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,310
I don't mind.

1290
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,290
It will prevent me from manipulating you.

1291
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,370
It might make it hurt a little bit when I move you though.

1292
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,230
Quite a bit, actually.

1293
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,030
Damn you!

1294
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:20,770
Oh!

1295
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:20,790
Oh!

1296
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:23,920
No!

1297
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,820
He's so cute.

1298
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:28,220
Oh!

1299
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,100
She's alive.

1300
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,140
First try.

1301
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:36,700
Nice work.

1302
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,340
Thank you!

1303
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,340
I can't believe it.

1304
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,320
You...

1305
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,620
You lot actually pulled it off!

1306
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,800
Sorry, Inspector Cabanela.

1307
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,340
I couldn't do anything to help you.

1308
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,680
And there I am.

1309
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,000
A poor broken heap of arms and legs.

1310
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,300
But it's okay.

1311
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,720
But no matter.

1312
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,880
I enjoyed the show.

1313
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,000
The magic disappearing act.

1314
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,600
That is...

1315
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,840
Nothing like it, baby.

1316
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,280
Yeah.

1317
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,680
His name is Lovey Dovey.

1318
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,340
No way.

1319
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:04,820
He's so cute.

1320
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,660
Do you guys mind if I have some... Pringles?

1321
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,360
I'm kind of hungry.

1322
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,880
I bought some Minecraft Pringles so I can get coins.

1323
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,060
Except...

1324
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:26,560
Thank you!

1325
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,020
Thank you!

1326
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,760
Kiss!

1327
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,180
Kiss!

1328
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:29,640
Kiss!

1329
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,920
Good job, Minto.

1330
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,000
With some help from the world's finest best doggo.

1331
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:34,740
Oh, sorry.

1332
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,920
The world's finest...

1333
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,560
The world's best doggo!

1334
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,500
Yes!

1335
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:53,010
I haven't had Pringles in so long.

1336
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,130
I got them because they had Minecraft on them.

1337
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:56,330
You get three...

1338
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,230
350 Minecoins.

1339
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,190
Who wouldn't get them?

1340
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:05,990
Unlike a normal magic trick, I'm the one that managed to vanish without a trace here.

1341
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:08,330
Okay, nice.

1342
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:14,970
You want some?

1343
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,930
Say ah!

1344
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,360
What do you do with Minecoins?

1345
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,280
You can buy...

1346
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,480
It's for the Bedrock version, not the Java version.

1347
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,520
You can buy certain worlds.

1348
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,260
They have a Jurassic Park world, you guys.

1349
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,000
A Jurassic Park Minecraft world.

1350
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,120
They have a Godzilla Minecraft world!

1351
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,180
Godzilla!

1352
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,940
You can fight as Godzilla.

1353
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,640
And you fight like Mothra and stuff like that.

1354
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,860
It's so awesome!

1355
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,620
Yeah, they have a Mega Man X-World!

1356
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,960
It's crazy!

1357
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,080
I'm really upset.

1358
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,500
Excuse me, Mr. Missile!

1359
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,440
You really shouldn't be mean like that.

1360
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,780
And what's this lively little creature?

1361
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,460
Oh, this little doggy is the warrior who keeps Camilla safe.

1362
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,740
Or he would be, if he was actually still full of life.

1363
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,300
Wait a second.

1364
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:44,340
I just realized, how are we going to go back to save Missile?

1365
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,560
How does this not create a time paradox?

1366
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:49,540
And we're...

1367
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,760
How do we go back and save Missile?

1368
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:00,890
Camilla...

1369
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,810
Gods in heaven, what a terrible thing!

1370
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,330
That poor little girl taken hostage!

1371
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,370
It's a cruel twist of fate indeed.

1372
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:11,310
Wait a minute!

1373
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:13,430
Miss Camilla is... a hostage?

1374
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,210
Yes, we're sorry little warrior.

1375
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,970
Miss Camilla, a hostage!

1376
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,060
Anyway, Inspector Cavanella.

1377
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,710
It's time to save your life now.

1378
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:30,970
But you couldn't get very far when you tried before, am I right?

1379
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,230
I love Missile.

1380
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,910
But this time it's different, right, Sissel?

1381
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:36,210
That's right.

1382
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,450
With us working together, it's a whole different situation.

1383
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,910
We'll save the inspector in white, and then we'll go rescue Camilla.

1384
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:43,390
Okay?

1385
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:44,910
Okay.

1386
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,310
Let's hurry up and get through this.

1387
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:47,870
Gee, kids.

1388
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,050
You're making me feel like an afterthought.

1389
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,490
Apologize to Cavanella.

1390
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:54,550
You're right.

1391
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,030
I should.

1392
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,870
I thought... I thought he betrayed us.

1393
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,370
I thought he was a bad guy the whole time.

1394
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:00,490
To be honest.

1395
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,030
No, he was a good guy.

1396
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,130
It's a good red herring.

1397
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:17,670
It is, yeah.

1398
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,160
Okay.

1399
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,640
Let's get started.

1400
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,480
Inspector Cavanella is upstairs.

1401
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,880
So our first step is to get up there.

1402
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,500
Sissel, I'll go up first and wait for you.

1403
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,560
Wait.

1404
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,560
Oh.

1405
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,480
Can you help me out, mister?

1406
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,380
Okay, lovey-dove.

1407
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,620
So cute.

1408
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,160
We need your help.

1409
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,460
Carry this measuring device upstairs.

1410
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,880
It has Mr. Ghost in it, so don't drop it.

1411
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,680
Thank you, lovey-dove.

1412
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,040
So close.

1413
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,100
So close.

1414
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,320
Just a little bit more.

1415
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:10,460
Oh, wait.

1416
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,640
I missed the... I missed the...

1417
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:12,480
Sorry.

1418
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,300
I missed the prompt.

1419
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,060
Okay.

1420
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,120
We're upstairs.

1421
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,320
There you are, Sissel.

1422
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,420
Sorry for the wait, Missile.

1423
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:27,960
If you want to see the best death in the game, let the situation with Cavanella play out without doing anything.

1424
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:28,760
Really?

1425
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,060
Okay.

1426
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:30,700
We'll do that.

1427
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,740
Four minutes from now, the inspector will be killed by a gun.

1428
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,380
You just jump in there and stop him from firing, would you?

1429
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,340
There you go again with that stuff.

1430
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,640
Besides, it doesn't make any sense.

1431
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,940
If you stop him from firing, he'll just kill you some other way.

1432
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,460
Wait a minute.

1433
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,280
That sounds familiar.

1434
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,540
Yep.

1435
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,000
Same situation as mine.

1436
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:04,740
Your best bet this time around is to allow him to shoot and then save Cavanella without him noticing.

1437
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:06,880
Whew.

1438
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,860
It's even worse than last time.

1439
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,240
Anywho.

1440
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,000
Jump in there and do something.

1441
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,260
I'm ready to jump in, Sissel.

1442
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:14,600
Oh wait.

1443
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,400
So don't do anything?

1444
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,520
So I'm just gonna watch?

1445
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,200
I'm gonna eat my Pringles and watch?

1446
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,360
Okay.

1447
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,280
Time is passing.

1448
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,540
Did you see that?

1449
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,680
That bad Sissel turned around!

1450
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,860
Do you have to call him that?

1451
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:44,860
But yeah.

1452
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,820
Maybe this is our chance to try and do some ghost tricks.

1453
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,360
This is the only time he takes his eyes off of me too.

1454
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,100
You have something to do?

1455
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:51,980
Do it now!

1456
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,480
Okay.

1457
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,680
I don't think I will.

1458
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:01,830
I think I'm gonna...

1459
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:04,410
Objection!

1460
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,800
Nothing to say to you.

1461
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:14,500
Ooh!

1462
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,500
Dang.

1463
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,060
He ragdolls over there.

1464
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,920
So crazy like.

1465
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,600
Like he got no bones.

1466
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,680
Sissel, right?

1467
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,060
What are they saying?

1468
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,880
I'm a little scared right now.

1469
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,180
Why didn't he die?

1470
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,340
Because he's already dead.

1471
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,220
He died 10 years ago.

1472
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,500
I knew full well he wouldn't die if I shot him.

1473
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,200
And why did you go to the trouble of shooting him at all?

1474
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:50,960
Time is almost up.

1475
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,340
That's enough chit-chat.

1476
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,640
But now the situation has changed slightly.

1477
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,740
These last split seconds are our chance.

1478
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:57,640
They are?

1479
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:58,920
Okay.

1480
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,040
Wait a second.

1481
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,680
Oh, there's a motor.

1482
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:11,750
Let's see.

1483
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:13,950
What goes on?

1484
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,120
This was... Oh, another condition.

1485
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,660
Wipe out everybody that knows about...

1486
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,540
He's going to shoot!

1487
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,080
It's too late!

1488
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,200
Again?

1489
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,520
I'm going to get shot again?

1490
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:28,040
No, wait!

1491
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,440
Our chance is coming up!

1492
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,080
The last split second, right?

1493
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,120
Leave it to me!

1494
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:35,540
Hello?

1495
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,560
Would you look at that?

1496
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:48,020
The bullet is hanging in mid-air between the gun and the inspector's forehead!

1497
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:50,040
Now's our chance!

1498
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,560
Wait...

1499
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,460
I'm here in the bullet right now!

1500
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:57,140
Let's swap this little thing with something else!

1501
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:57,900
Wait, what?

1502
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,420
It's our only hope.

1503
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:01,980
It is?

1504
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:02,940
Wait...

1505
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,100
There's got to be something here with the same shape and direction as the bullet!

1506
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Hurry now!

1507
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,780
Swap that hanging bullet with something else!

1508
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,350
That's a bullet?

1509
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:31,780
What?

1510
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,820
What is the bullet even shape...

1511
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,360
I can't even tell what the shape is!

1512
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,060
I can't even tell!

1513
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:45,900
What is it?

1514
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,740
Is it with the hard hat?

1515
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,780
Oh my god...

1516
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,640
No way...

1517
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,100
Is it going to work?

1518
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,340
Oh!

1519
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,990
That didn't go...

1520
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:09,450
Oh my god!

1521
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:13,550
We tried swapping what we could find but we just made things worse!

1522
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,490
Not nice, kids!

1523
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:16,470
Not nice at all!

1524
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:18,010
You put a dent in my lovely...

1525
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:24,370
Oh no!

1526
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,650
I don't have a napkin!

1527
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,570
Oh wait, maybe I do.

1528
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:31,990
No, I don't have a napkin.

1529
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:37,690
Guess we better search for something softer to swap with.

1530
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:39,710
Okay.

1531
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,030
From the beginning means from this beginning, right?

1532
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,190
Not from the doctor's beginning.

1533
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:47,310
Oh!

1534
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:47,930
Oh wait!

1535
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:48,990
I want to see what he says here.

1536
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:51,530
You've got...

1537
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:51,570
Oh!

1538
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,470
You've got grit, little pigeon.

1539
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:55,850
I'd better get up there before the little pigeon's strength gives out.

1540
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,290
It's still waiting for me.

1541
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:57,890
I'd better hurry.

1542
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:58,910
Yeah.

1543
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:00,630
Okay.

1544
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:02,070
Give me...

1545
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,370
Don't worry, everybody falls for that.

1546
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:05,610
Give me one second.

1547
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,710
I'm going to go wash my hands and get some more water.

1548
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,870
Sorry for the intermission.

1549
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,330
Mid...

1550
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:13,930
Mid puzzle.

1551
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,150
Give me one second.

1552
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:19,090
I have no napkin and I have a dirty hand.

1553
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:19,590
Okay.

1554
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,370
I mean, I don't want to use my sleeves even though they cover my hands.

1555
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:24,130
But, you know.

1556
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:24,810
I

1557
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,520
was out of hot water.

1558
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,260
I couldn't get any more water at all.

1559
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,240
Sorry.

1560
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,000
I left for no reason.

1561
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,740
I filled up my thing again.

1562
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,320
So...

1563
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,320
So...

1564
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,300
It's boiling now.

1565
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,540
You don't have a kettle?

1566
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,760
That's what I'm using.

1567
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,280
Thanks for all the super chat.

1568
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,700
Thank you, guys.

1569
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:31,380
I actually got this puzzle wrong the first time because I didn't know what a bullet in flight was shaped like.

1570
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:31,760
That's...

1571
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,400
That's...

1572
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,280
It's weird, right?

1573
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:34,500
Okay.

1574
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,060
Once it's fired, the bullet will be the key to the whole thing.

1575
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,400
Okay.

1576
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,080
Use my powers.

1577
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:40,500
Okay.

1578
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:41,740
So...

1579
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,520
Trick time.

1580
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,420
We have to find something soft that is the shape of the helmet.

1581
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,180
How do we get it over there, though?

1582
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,920
That's literally it.

1583
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,600
That's literally it.

1584
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,460
But we don't reach.

1585
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,500
Hmm...

1586
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,030
Oh, wait.

1587
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:17,130
We can move through the step ladder.

1588
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,550
Help me, step ladder.

1589
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:20,110
I'm stuck.

1590
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,670
Wait.

1591
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:21,550
Wait.

1592
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,430
Um...

1593
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,260
ZR.

1594
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,300
Oh, I can't reach there either.

1595
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,820
I'm so useless.

1596
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:32,880
Wait.

1597
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,780
I'm stuck here.

1598
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,120
Wait.

1599
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:35,560
Uh?

1600
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:36,160
Eh?

1601
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:36,680
Eh?

1602
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,560
Huh?

1603
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:38,720
Huh?

1604
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:39,780
Huh?

1605
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:40,040
Huh?

1606
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:40,920
Wait.

1607
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:41,920
Oh, wait.

1608
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,200
We have to wait for him to set it down.

1609
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:43,620
That's right.

1610
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:45,880
I remember.

1611
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,380
I remember.

1612
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,180
Bang.

1613
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:49,620
Bang.

1614
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,080
Okay.

1615
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,380
Chance!

1616
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:54,980
Oh...

1617
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,640
Wait.

1618
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,580
Ah...

1619
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:56,870
Ah...

1620
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,060
Ah...

1621
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:58,640
Ah...

1622
01:17:59,400 --> 01:17:59,980
Ah...

1623
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,740
He's gonna turn around.

1624
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,740
Time is passing.

1625
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,560
Swivel.

1626
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:11,780
La, la, la.

1627
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,280
Don't notice me.

1628
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,220
Rock...

1629
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:15,420
Wait.

1630
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,880
If I rock it now, will he notice?

1631
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,200
Oh.

1632
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,240
Oopsie.

1633
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:19,620
Okay.

1634
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:21,700
What was that?

1635
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,960
I think I made things worse.

1636
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:25,900
Uh-oh.

1637
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,400
Uh...

1638
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,020
Oopsie.

1639
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,620
Oh, wait.

1640
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,360
Oh, wait.

1641
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,000
Um...

1642
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,780
No, because it would still launch the helmet.

1643
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,340
It would still launch the helmet.

1644
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:54,040
Like, it would still go...

1645
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:54,100
Pew.

1646
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:54,860
You know?

1647
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,240
Pew.

1648
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,280
Pew.

1649
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,640
Because it would be in motion.

1650
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:57,880
Oh.

1651
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:57,920
That's right.

1652
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:05,730
Ah...

1653
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:06,910
How do I get over there, though?

1654
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:11,630
Hmm...

1655
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,750
How do I get over there?

1656
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,780
I can't be as long as you...

1657
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:22,400
Hmm...

1658
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:24,880
Uh, uh.

1659
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,400
Hmm...

1660
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:32,900
What was that noise?

1661
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:33,860
Ha ha ha ha.

1662
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,080
What was that noise?

1663
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,980
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1664
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:44,440
Ah...

1665
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:44,940
Oh...

1666
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,200
Oh, it's closer.

1667
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:50,980
It's closer.

1668
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,160
I forgot that.

1669
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,300
I forgot that that happened.

1670
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:00,000
Wait, why is the music stopped?

1671
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,240
Oh, that's why the music stopped!

1672
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,280
Oh no!

1673
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,780
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle!

1674
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,520
Okay, now go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1675
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,840
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!

1676
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,260
Now, I think we should be able to do it.

1677
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,660
I think.

1678
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,080
Now we just wait, right?

1679
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,760
Is Missile going to intercept again?

1680
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,320
Oh, it looks like the book!

1681
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,720
Oh, the shape!

1682
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,820
Oh, you're right.

1683
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,720
Oh, you're right.

1684
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,000
It's too flat.

1685
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,500
Oh no!

1686
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,280
Oh, okay.

1687
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,640
I shouldn't have moved the helmet on the ground.

1688
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,080
I should have kept it up there.

1689
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,260
Okay, okay.

1690
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,940
I get it now.

1691
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,780
Okay, we'll reset.

1692
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:01,500
Restart, restart.

1693
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,220
Are you sure?

1694
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,430
Don't reset?

1695
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,390
Okay.

1696
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:10,870
I'll try it.

1697
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,050
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1698
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,150
Okay.

1699
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:27,310
Even though my powers are nothing, I can do.

1700
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:29,170
Swap the bullet with...

1701
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,070
Sorry, inspector.

1702
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:31,930
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1703
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:33,950
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1704
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:34,990
Wait.

1705
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:35,010
Oh, wait.

1706
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:37,430
Swap?

1707
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:39,570
Hm?

1708
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,950
Now it's just hanging there.

1709
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,750
Oh, oh, I get it.

1710
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,670
Okay, I didn't realize that it would like...

1711
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,630
If I swapped it with the book, it would then slide down.

1712
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:55,730
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1713
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,910
I get it now.

1714
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,450
I get it.

1715
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:58,210
Okay, okay, okay.

1716
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,430
So I still had to rock it to the ground.

1717
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,050
Or like, rock it...

1718
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:04,710
Knock it over!

1719
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:06,730
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1720
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,010
No worries, no worries.

1721
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:12,310
Okay.

1722
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,070
I get it.

1723
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,490
The game spoiled her.

1724
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:17,730
Yeah, pretty much.

1725
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:21,690
It's all a waiting game for most of this, though.

1726
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,570
So here we gotta wait.

1727
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:25,710
We gotta wait.

1728
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:26,750
We gotta wait.

1729
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,610
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1730
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:31,890
Ba-bang!

1731
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,550
Okay.

1732
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,050
And from here, we go here.

1733
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,810
We go here.

1734
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:36,330
We go here.

1735
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:37,930
And we... Oh, no.

1736
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:38,530
Just kidding.

1737
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:39,150
We go here.

1738
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:41,390
And we wait for him to turn around.

1739
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:43,510
Objection!

1740
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:45,630
Spin!

1741
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:49,210
Chup!

1742
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:49,730
Chup!

1743
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,290
And rock!

1744
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,990
La-la-la-la-la.

1745
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:55,190
What was that noise?

1746
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,190
Nothing.

1747
01:22:58,610 --> 01:22:59,790
Nothing here.

1748
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,810
Now I wait for him to get shot.

1749
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,530
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

1750
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,190
Yeah.

1751
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:11,690
And I have to go really fast.

1752
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,130
Pew!

1753
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:20,590
Nice.

1754
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:23,530
Just a hat.

1755
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:26,790
Trick time.

1756
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:28,750
Okay.

1757
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:30,390
Oh!

1758
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:32,890
Uh...

1759
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,310
I need you to move.

1760
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:41,590
Oh!

1761
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:41,910
Oh!

1762
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,190
Oh!

1763
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:42,410
Oh!

1764
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:42,790
Oh!

1765
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:43,230
Go!

1766
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:43,510
Go!

1767
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:43,650
Go!

1768
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:43,810
Go!

1769
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,110
Go!

1770
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:44,370
Go!

1771
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:44,590
Go!

1772
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:45,390
Okay.

1773
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:46,870
Move!

1774
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:47,790
Go!

1775
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:47,970
Go!

1776
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:48,150
Go!

1777
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:48,370
Go!

1778
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:48,550
Go!

1779
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:51,610
Chup!

1780
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:52,170
Chup!

1781
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:53,290
Rock it!

1782
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:53,910
Jiggle!

1783
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:54,170
Jiggle!

1784
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:54,690
Jiggle!

1785
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:58,850
Move it!

1786
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,830
Move it!

1787
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:00,250
Move it!

1788
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:00,750
Move it!

1789
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:01,350
Okay.

1790
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,070
Uh... Swap it!

1791
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,390
Pop it!

1792
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:08,610
Pop it!

1793
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:09,210
Twist it!

1794
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,310
Twist it!

1795
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,070
Swap it!

1796
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:14,490
Okay.

1797
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:18,390
And then...

1798
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:19,130
Oh.

1799
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,230
Would you look at that!

1800
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:21,970
Right on the hook!

1801
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,450
I love knit hats.

1802
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,430
So warm.

1803
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:26,150
And most of all...

1804
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:26,850
Soft.

1805
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,730
Why are you in my head?

1806
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,690
And now that I'm looking at it...

1807
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:36,990
That hat is the same shape as the helmet that you just knocked down!

1808
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:38,370
Aha!

1809
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,350
I thought so!

1810
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,210
Yes.

1811
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,730
Now we'll intercept...

1812
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:46,330
With the fuzzy hat.

1813
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:51,660
Bing!

1814
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,560
Da-da-da-da-da.

1815
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,960
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

1816
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,240
Da-da-da-da-da.

1817
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:00,140
Oh!

1818
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:00,260
Oh!

1819
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,740
For some reason I was like...

1820
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,000
Missile!

1821
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:03,460
Missile!

1822
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,520
Missile!

1823
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:04,960
Missile!

1824
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:05,620
Missile!

1825
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,120
Okay.

1826
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,420
Bullet with hat!

1827
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:11,980
Swap!

1828
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:14,640
Boom!

1829
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,320
Oh!

1830
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,360
Oh my god!

1831
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,960
He's freaking dead!

1832
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:26,480
Oh he just totally didn't think anything of it.

1833
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,200
I don't think he noticed.

1834
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,380
Looks like he pulled off another magic disappearing act.

1835
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:35,680
And now I say again...

1836
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,260
I love new hats.

1837
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,540
So warm and most of all...

1838
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:40,300
Soft.

1839
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,040
Did I do alright?

1840
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,880
You did a fine job little one.

1841
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:46,880
Go Missile!

1842
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:47,720
Wait.

1843
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:50,080
You guys...

1844
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:50,480
You guys...

1845
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,420
Did I do a good job?

1846
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,020
Did...

1847
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,180
Did Mint do a good job?

1848
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:58,340
Good job!

1849
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,640
Ear scratches for everyone.

1850
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,420
Minto did great.

1851
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,360
Yippee!

1852
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,240
You saved another life.

1853
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,780
And I'll keep doing it too.

1854
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,740
Over and over.

1855
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,680
Good job Mint.

1856
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,340
Thank you!

1857
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:37,980
Nah!

1858
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,340
What I just...

1859
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,080
What I saw in just these four minutes...

1860
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,960
Gave me all the answers I've been looking for.

1861
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,740
All our research these past ten years pales in comparison.

1862
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,340
Right professor?

1863
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,120
Yeah all I had to do was die.

1864
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,920
So you two were working together.

1865
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,380
That's about the size of a yeah.

1866
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,420
Who would believe a story about a manipulator?

1867
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,620
So we pursued it ourselves.

1868
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,040
Just the two of us.

1869
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,020
I wonder if the knit hat is a reference to Hobo Phoenix...

1870
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,080
Hobo Hodo!

1871
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,280
Maybe.

1872
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,760
It is the same color.

1873
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,980
If it had a little button on it then it for sure would be, right?

1874
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,740
Or it would be the other way around.

1875
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,960
Maybe Phoenix's hat is a reference to this, right?

1876
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,040
Because this game came...

1877
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:25,860
I'm assuming this game came out after... I mean before Apollo Justice, right?

1878
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,240
Takumi didn't work on Hobo, right?

1879
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:35,720
He didn't!

1880
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,500
Oh.

1881
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:38,440
Oh it was after.

1882
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,240
This game was in 2009.

1883
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:40,880
Oh.

1884
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,240
I see, I see, I see.

1885
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,100
Huh.

1886
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,300
Takumi helped produce Apollo, I think.

1887
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,500
I'm quite a crazy character myself after all.

1888
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,500
Okay, let's hurry back!

1889
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,720
Back to our time!

1890
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:07,960
Nixie, thank you!

1891
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,920
Fortunately I'm gonna have to miss the end of this game due to sleep.

1892
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,640
But I hope you enjoy it.

1893
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,180
It's only gonna get twistier.

1894
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:14,460
Really?

1895
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,560
From here, even twistier!

1896
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:18,040
I'm excited.

1897
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:18,900
Thank you!

1898
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,780
I have to rescue Miss Camilla!

1899
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,560
You're right, Missile.

1900
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,860
And there's a certain guy I have to follow too.

1901
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,540
Yeah, me.

1902
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:30,420
Me!

1903
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:31,700
I have to follow me!

1904
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:38,980
Wake up.

1905
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,300
Wake up, Inspector.

1906
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,220
It was the performance of a lifetime.

1907
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,680
After completing his revenge on Inspector Cavanella, the man in red left.

1908
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:49,760
And now...

1909
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,440
A new story is about to unfold.

1910
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,880
And a new present.

1911
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,000
We saved two people!

1912
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,600
How are you feeling, you old crazy character?

1913
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,960
What the ghost doing?

1914
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,960
Hey there, Prof!

1915
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,400
We're both alive, I see.

1916
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,160
Yeah, nothing like it, baby.

1917
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,740
But I don't know if I'm getting old or what.

1918
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,220
I've got a few aches and pains here and there.

1919
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,780
Used to be a little thing like an explosion...

1920
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,580
Used to be a little thing like an explosion wouldn't bother me.

1921
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:28,520
Yeah, right.

1922
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:30,180
Like I'm going to believe that.

1923
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:31,400
So what?

1924
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,020
The guy in red is gone, eh?

1925
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,740
Just in case, I posted special investigation units all around the building.

1926
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:41,140
Let's just pray the boys came through for us.

1927
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,380
What if they got me?

1928
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,080
It paid off, though.

1929
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,840
You can't trust anybody.

1930
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,020
Not even yourself!

1931
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:47,180
Apparently.

1932
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:48,720
Damn it.

1933
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,720
You've picked a bad time not to listen to me, buddy of mine.

1934
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,880
Inspector Cabanela's so cool.

1935
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,200
You got this.

1936
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,580
Trick time.

1937
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,800
Well, looks like both of their deaths were erased.

1938
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:07,060
Unfortunately, in the case of the inspector in white, I can't call it a complete success.

1939
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:10,620
I mean, how are you supposed to stop his bones being broken from an explosion?

1940
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,500
But in any case, these two have the information I need to start tracking the manipulator.

1941
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:18,860
I'd better talk to them.

1942
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,880
Why do I want to talk to the bird?

1943
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,080
How is Missile doing?

1944
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:29,360
Alright, Sissel, it's time to go!

1945
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:34,060
Out into the big wide world to rescue Miss Camilla!

1946
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,300
Hold on a minute, Missile.

1947
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,200
I have to talk to these two first.

1948
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,140
Oh.

1949
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,380
Okay.

1950
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:41,900
I understand.

1951
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:43,980
But just know one thing.

1952
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,740
I go where the wind takes me.

1953
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,940
Is this little doggy trying to put pressure on me?

1954
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:52,420
Okay.

1955
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,120
Let's talk.

1956
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,440
Mr. Superintendent.

1957
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,420
Do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?

1958
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,680
I haven't always been a junkyard superintendent.

1959
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,240
Intent...

1960
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,480
Intendant.

1961
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,340
Superintendent.

1962
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,760
You know, I used to be part of the police.

1963
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,320
The police, huh?

1964
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:16,660
He's like a leaf in the wind.

1965
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,540
Super Nintendo.

1966
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:24,400
Not as a detective, but as a medical examiner.

1967
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,500
I investigated victims cause of death.

1968
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,460
Like mine?

1969
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:34,060
Ten years ago, I was asked to autopsy a strange corpse.

1970
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,160
Hit by a meteorite fragment and died instantly.

1971
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,120
Well, what if the police report is wrong too?

1972
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,840
What if everything is wrong?

1973
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,180
There were no signs of life.

1974
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,060
He was definitely dead.

1975
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,240
But I never filed an autopsy report.

1976
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:03,610
That's because the corpse suddenly vanished.

1977
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:07,470
Leaving behind only one clue.

1978
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,890
An unusual corpse.

1979
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:15,930
I bet that's what I've been chasing all night.

1980
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:16,470
Wouldn't it...

1981
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,070
Wouldn't it be like...

1982
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:19,130
So...

1983
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,410
It would be bones.

1984
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:22,830
It would just be bones.

1985
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,750
We'd be a walking skeleton.

1986
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:27,790
Could you tell me more?

1987
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:29,610
Yeah, sure.

1988
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:33,390
I have an interest in you recovering your memory and finding your true identity too.

1989
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:35,570
Unusual corpse.

1990
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:38,510
That's the only way I can describe it too.

1991
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:40,070
It was an unusual corpse.

1992
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:42,090
He was dead alright.

1993
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,230
No question about that.

1994
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:47,490
But there wasn't a scratch on him.

1995
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:53,270
Not a scratch, but I thought he was hit by a meteorite fragment.

1996
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:01,230
Spooky scary skeletons and shivers down your spine.

1997
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:05,210
You gotta manipulate the blood flow and flow of nutrients.

1998
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,150
I don't understand it any more than you do.

1999
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:12,050
Okay...

2000
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:14,230
It's aliens.

2001
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:17,190
Aliens.

2002
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:19,190
Aliens.

2003
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,730
I was completely bewildered.

2004
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,470
But when I tried to autopsy him I was even more puzzled.

2005
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:27,470
I couldn't perform the autopsy.

2006
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,250
It's like...

2007
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:35,910
He's like manipulating the body but trying to be kind of like inconspicuous about it, so it's just like...

2008
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:37,770
Or sorry, conspicuous about it.

2009
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,250
So he's just like...

2010
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:42,630
He'll like go in with the knife and the hand and he kind of shoots up like...

2011
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:46,210
Maybe that's not very conspicuous at all actually.

2012
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:46,610
Wait.

2013
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:48,790
Is it inconspicuous or conspicuous?

2014
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:49,270
Now I'm confused.

2015
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:52,590
I don't know.

2016
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:57,770
Wait.

2017
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:02,830
Which one...

2018
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,590
Inconspicuous equals subtle.

2019
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,750
Subtle.

2020
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:07,030
Okay, okay.

2021
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,310
I switched them around.

2022
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:11,690
I had it right the first time.

2023
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:14,730
I'm confused too.

2024
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:20,330
Okay.

2025
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:21,410
Now I remember.

2026
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,870
I thought I had it right.

2027
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:29,630
You couldn't?

2028
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:30,430
What do you mean?

2029
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:33,350
The scalpel went in but I couldn't cut.

2030
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:39,930
As soon as I tried to make an incision it would heal up in the very next instant.

2031
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:41,430
That's how it went.

2032
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:43,290
And no scarring or blood either.

2033
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:47,330
The rock makes you immortal?

2034
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:48,750
The rock makes you immortal?

2035
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:51,550
And I never had the chance to solve the mystery.

2036
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,650
That's because the corpse up and vanished on us.

2037
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,170
The morgue is very well guarded.

2038
01:34:59,170 --> 01:34:59,990
The morgue is very well guarded.

2039
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,830
Nobody could have stolen that body.

2040
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:09,620
But there is one way the corpse could have disappeared.

2041
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,560
What's that?

2042
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:18,820
If he just got up and walked out himself...

2043
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:20,980
Nice.

2044
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,240
He's bisexual!

2045
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,320
Vamp.

2046
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,820
He got up, opened the door, and walked out on its own.

2047
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,020
Wait, is that on the security camera?

2048
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:43,180
What?

2049
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,940
He was dead, but he wasn't dead.

2050
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,260
We saw it with our own eyes tonight.

2051
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,460
Not even that explosion could kill him.

2052
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:55,560
And he didn't even feel it when he slammed his fist onto that stove.

2053
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:02,780
The corpse left behind some data from some...

2054
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:09,000
The corpse left behind some data from some testing I did.

2055
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,980
I got some readings for some kind of radiation...

2056
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,460
coming off the body.

2057
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:20,640
No wonder this town is so kooky!

2058
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:23,820
They all have radiation poisoning!

2059
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,340
No wonder everyone is so eccentric!

2060
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:28,940
Oh my god!

2061
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,300
Radiation...

2062
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,180
Radioactive!

2063
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,140
Radioactive!

2064
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:41,600
I used all kinds of instruments, but I couldn't determine exactly what kind of radiation it was.

2065
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,100
Sub...

2066
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:45,420
Sorry.

2067
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,060
Un-discovered type.

2068
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,380
From a world unknown.

2069
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,520
From a world unknown.

2070
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,120
Wait a minute...

2071
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:51,660
Could it be?

2072
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:52,900
That's right.

2073
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,360
It was coming from that meteorite fragment.

2074
01:36:59,520 --> 01:36:59,920
Aliens!

2075
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:00,320
Aliens!

2076
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:00,980
Aliens!

2077
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,360
Oh my gosh.

2078
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,760
I'm getting super...

2079
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,800
Outer Wilds vibes right now.

2080
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,840
Just because I'm thinking of like the rock in Outer Wilds, you know?

2081
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,140
And how it was so mysterious.

2082
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:14,900
Ghosts of Matter.

2083
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,220
Yeah!

2084
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:15,500
Yeah!

2085
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:15,640
Yeah!

2086
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,000
No, I'm thinking of the one that...

2087
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,480
When you turn around, it would disappear.

2088
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,040
I went to that park and tested the spot where the meteorite fell.

2089
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,860
Just as I expected, I detected radiation coming from that crater.

2090
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,380
It was the exact same pattern of radiation as that of the corpse.

2091
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,100
Yes, the quantum rock!

2092
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,460
Yes, yes, yes.

2093
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:38,520
At the time, I thought he was some kind of immortal being.

2094
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:40,920
He would die only to come back to life.

2095
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:46,180
I wanted to research it all in depth, so I quit my job as a police medical examiner.

2096
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:52,940
Several years later, I came to learn the connection between my research...

2097
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:54,940
I'm so sorry.

2098
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,820
I keep yawning.

2099
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,740
I'm so sorry.

2100
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,840
I'm so sorry.

2101
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,420
My research...

2102
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,060
And the manipulator case.

2103
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,280
Thanks to the arrival of this crazy character here...

2104
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,860
Oh, stop now, professor.

2105
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,620
Do you want to see me blush?

2106
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,420
Cabanela's arrival.

2107
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,320
Please continue.

2108
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:18,700
I gotta get more water.

2109
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:29,350
It was about a year ago, I say.

2110
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:30,830
My neck hurts.

2111
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:32,470
It doesn't hurt!

2112
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:37,270
This man in white came dancing into my research lab here.

2113
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:42,950
Minthe, are you the byproduct of radiation too?

2114
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,950
Am I a freak?

2115
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:58,490
I don't glow at night.

2116
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,550
I don't glow in the dark.

2117
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:01,870
Sometimes.

2118
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:02,690
I don't know.

2119
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:05,950
You are green?

2120
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,000
Wait, I am a freak!

2121
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,340
I'm a freaky ghost maid!

2122
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,280
I think we should explore this later.

2123
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:30,780
I heard there was an oddball here who's researching Temsik.

2124
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:32,280
Is that you, baby?

2125
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,660
I like how he calls everybody baby.

2126
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:38,860
Even to the old man scientist.

2127
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:42,140
Who are you to be calling anybody an oddball?

2128
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,880
Maybe I came from outer space.

2129
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,480
Maybe I came from outer space.

2130
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,260
Uranium rod.

2131
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:00,100
Maybe I'm actually an alien.

2132
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:01,980
Mon, welcome to membership.

2133
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:02,660
Thank you!

2134
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,940
Wow, what convinced you, Mon?

2135
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,620
Did you think like, oh my gosh, she's an alien?

2136
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,420
I love aliens!

2137
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:10,820
You know?

2138
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,780
Space ghost coast to coast!

2139
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:22,010
The dots keep connecting, you guys.

2140
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:22,930
This is kind of crazy.

2141
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:28,030
The dots keep connecting!

2142
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,010
I was investigating the manipulator case then.

2143
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:35,470
And then I heard there was a man...

2144
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:41,810
Who'd quit the police force to study the meteorite?

2145
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:45,150
When I heard that, it was like a meteorite had struck me on the head.

2146
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:48,270
Ah, look at all of them.

2147
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,610
Oh my gosh, wait, I completely forgot about the guy on the left.

2148
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:52,470
The guy who has his toes out.

2149
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:56,190
At the time, we were just starting to get leads on this manipulator.

2150
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:58,550
We didn't know who he was yet.

2151
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:00,210
Space Minto!

2152
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:05,450
But we knew he was communicating with a certain foreign country.

2153
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:09,250
In one of those communications, we heard the manipulator say this.

2154
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:13,690
The source of my power...

2155
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,310
Is not of this world.

2156
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:21,500
End transmission.

2157
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,500
And that's when I put two and two together, baby.

2158
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,940
The manipulator case and Temsik were somehow connected.

2159
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,060
Which also explained how five years ago...

2160
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:33,740
He used his powers to manipulate a birthday surprise.

2161
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,060
A little girl made by her mother.

2162
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,840
He added that gun to the contraption.

2163
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,820
Most likely by controlling Camilla.

2164
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,520
You're starting to freak me out.

2165
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:46,360
What's wrong?

2166
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,820
If I haven't started freaking you out from the beginning...

2167
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,420
I'm not doing my job as a ghost well enough.

2168
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:53,820
Honestly.

2169
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,900
Alright, now we talk to...

2170
01:41:58,820 --> 01:41:59,300
Cabanela.

2171
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,880
If I knew things were going to end up like this...

2172
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,380
I would have tried to die in that explosion, baby.

2173
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,860
That way I could have been dancing after Big Red by now.

2174
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,020
I might be able to erase deaths.

2175
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,720
But it's true I can't do much about injuries.

2176
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,720
But really, you shouldn't talk that way.

2177
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,460
Yeah, sorry.

2178
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:22,660
I suppose you're right.

2179
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,180
I just hate feeling so...

2180
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:24,980
Helpless.

2181
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,600
He was right there within my grasp.

2182
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,320
I just missed the puzzle.

2183
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:32,720
Sorry.

2184
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,680
All our plans were resting on tonight.

2185
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:37,560
And then this...

2186
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,880
This had to happen.

2187
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,480
Guess he's thinking about his spotless record.

2188
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,300
It's not too late, Inspector.

2189
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:44,180
We still have a chance.

2190
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,800
Maybe I can catch him.

2191
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,440
I say you're right.

2192
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:48,400
That's not a bad idea.

2193
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:50,180
I'll cooperate with you fully.

2194
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,080
Go ahead and fire away with any questions you like, Mr. Ghost.

2195
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:54,440
Okay.

2196
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,460
I'm going to go get my water now.

2197
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,080
And I'm actually going to get some caffeine too.

2198
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:00,640
Because...

2199
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:03,280
I know we're in...

2200
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,020
It's going to be a long while to finish this.

2201
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:06,560
So...

2202
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:07,580
I got to be...

2203
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,360
Not yawning every two seconds.

2204
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:09,780
So...

2205
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:11,020
I'm so sorry.

2206
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:12,080
It's going to be a little...

2207
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:13,960
Oh my gosh.

2208
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,920
I'm so sorry for the second break.

2209
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,800
I'm going to make a little note.

2210
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,520
Getting water...

2211
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:21,480
Getting...

2212
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:22,940
Oh no.

2213
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,160
I have hiccups.

2214
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,160
No.

2215
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,500
I have hiccups.

2216
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,100
Getting water...

2217
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:34,580
And...

2218
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,600
Energy.

2219
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:42,980
No!

2220
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:47,410
No!

2221
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:49,650
Please, no.

2222
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:55,970
Oh no, no, no, no.

2223
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:59,210
I hate it.

2224
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:01,150
Oh wait, actually...

2225
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,040
Okay, I'll be right back.

2226
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:17,480
Oh yeah.

2227
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:18,960
Okay.

2228
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,440
We are...

2229
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:26,730
I'm back.

2230
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:28,570
Oh my god.

2231
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:29,490
I almost spilled my drink.

2232
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:30,730
I have two drinks.

2233
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:33,250
I have two drinks.

2234
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:35,830
Okay.

2235
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:36,970
Okay.

2236
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:37,990
Okay.

2237
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,510
I'm so sorry, everybody.

2238
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:41,430
I didn't want to leave two times.

2239
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:41,950
But...

2240
01:47:42,610 --> 01:47:43,130
Um...

2241
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:43,770
Yes.

2242
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:44,330
I'm back.

2243
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:46,250
Sorry, VOD watchers.

2244
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:47,470
So sorry, everybody.

2245
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,900
Are the hiccups gone?

2246
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:54,700
Yeah, they're gone.

2247
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,080
Yippee!

2248
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:01,280
I don't know where to put the second drink.

2249
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,480
I'll put it there.

2250
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:03,480
Okay.

2251
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:04,760
Okay.

2252
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:08,360
We kept the VOD watchers entertained.

2253
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:09,020
We did?

2254
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:09,680
What did you do?

2255
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:11,200
What did you do?

2256
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:11,740
What did you do?

2257
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:14,600
You can see me scooting up in my chair.

2258
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,240
Okay.

2259
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,780
No, I can't see.

2260
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:20,560
It's just for fun.

2261
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:21,380
I'm a person who can't jump on this.

2262
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:21,600
I'm a man who can't jump on anything.

2263
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:21,760
A kiss.

2264
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:21,980
Dive.

2265
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:22,760
Now...

2266
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:24,500
No.

2267
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,220
No, I can't.

2268
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:29,660
I can't.

2269
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:32,360
Okay.

2270
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,040
Okay.

2271
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,400
No, I can't.

2272
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:35,600
I'm sorry.

2273
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:36,900
I'm sorry.

2274
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:37,780
No, I can't.

2275
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:39,240
I can't.

2276
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:39,800
I can't.

2277
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,280
I can't.

2278
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:41,680
I can't.

2279
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:41,700
I can't.

2280
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,820
But what about when he said this?

2281
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,580
Oh, that it was a lie?

2282
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,440
Yeah, right.

2283
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,440
I was murdered by all of you!

2284
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,700
Detective Jowd who forced me into a corner.

2285
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,700
Lynn, the girl who was playing in the park.

2286
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,540
And finally you, Inspector Cabanela.

2287
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:02,120
If you hadn't done what you did, I never would have pointed a gun at that kid.

2288
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:03,740
Mmm...

2289
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:09,200
Mmm...

2290
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,960
Spill the beans, Cabanela.

2291
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,000
Ten years ago on that day...

2292
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,360
The Special Investigation Unit was working on a certain big case.

2293
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,760
We hauled in a young man...

2294
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,120
...An important witness to our investigation...

2295
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:24,660
And then I did it.

2296
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,980
I made two very stupid mistakes.

2297
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:27,720
Oh...

2298
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,900
Detective, I'm telling you!

2299
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,580
I don't know anything about it!

2300
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,600
Fine, fine.

2301
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,820
You're under no obligation to talk, of course.

2302
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:46,360
But if you don't, the Special Investigation Unit can make the rest of your life a living hell.

2303
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,100
He's a witness!

2304
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,460
If he's just a witness, why are you interrogating him like this?

2305
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,500
The first mistake was being a big meanie.

2306
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,700
But I...

2307
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:10,620
I'd just been assigned to the Special Investigation Unit, you see.

2308
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:16,060
They didn't share much info on big cases with a newbie like me yet.

2309
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:17,900
And I wanted to impress them.

2310
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:19,160
Good cop, bad cop?

2311
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:20,840
Nooooo!

2312
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,560
It was only supposed to be a simple matter of taking a statement.

2313
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,520
But I was too green.

2314
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,060
Me!

2315
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,160
I'm green!

2316
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:32,780
I'm a mix of blue, too.

2317
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,300
I pushed him too hard.

2318
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,860
I drove him into a corner and made him lose all hope.

2319
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:39,900
That was my first mistake.

2320
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:43,560
And then I made another mistake on top of that.

2321
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:45,740
He was too minty.

2322
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:51,080
It ain't easy being...

2323
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,740
It ain't inty being minty.

2324
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:58,460
Cabanela, got a minute?

2325
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,760
The Chief wants to see you about your report.

2326
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,480
Oh no, you left him in there!

2327
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:03,760
Got it.

2328
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:04,720
I'll be right there.

2329
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:09,680
You stay right here and be a good boy now.

2330
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:16,370
Oh my god, is that why he said good boy to Cabanela?

2331
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:18,190
Oh my god!

2332
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:23,890
He's been thinking about that for a long time!

2333
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:30,990
And that's when I did it.

2334
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:34,170
I left it behind in the interrogation room.

2335
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:36,050
My gun!

2336
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:38,630
Oh my god, you're so...

2337
01:51:38,630 --> 01:51:38,930
What?

2338
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:46,200
How could you?

2339
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,400
He used my gun to escape.

2340
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:50,420
What he said is true.

2341
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,460
If I hadn't made that mistake...

2342
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:56,140
He never would have had a gun to point at Lin in the first place.

2343
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,400
Fire this guy?

2344
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,520
I know, right?

2345
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:06,700
How is he not fired?

2346
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:08,680
Manipulator.

2347
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:13,740
We first found out about the manipulator's existence during a certain overseas communication.

2348
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:15,660
Overseas communication?

2349
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:16,800
Overseas communication?

2350
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:22,160
For national security purposes, this country keeps tabs on the communications networks.

2351
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:27,320
This particular communication was about making a deal with a certain foreign country.

2352
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:31,140
Cecil, you said you'd stay put and be a good boy.

2353
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,000
Oh my god, you guys.

2354
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,200
I sometimes say that to Pies.

2355
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,760
But I actually think I have to rename her Johnny.

2356
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:44,580
Oh my god.

2357
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,040
This morning...

2358
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,920
I think I'm so tired because...

2359
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,880
This morning was a little stressful for me.

2360
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,720
And that I was just cleaning up so much shit.

2361
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,960
I'm never...

2362
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,140
I went down to pet her.

2363
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,900
And I pet her.

2364
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,660
She was looking out the window.

2365
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:05,200
I pet her.

2366
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,100
And my hand was wet.

2367
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:17,660
And then...

2368
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:20,180
And then I looked at her.

2369
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:22,360
I was like, what?

2370
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,820
And then I just saw poop all over her.

2371
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,520
Poop everywhere!

2372
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:30,920
And then she was like walking on the couch.

2373
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,920
She was walking everywhere.

2374
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,330
It's Johnny.

2375
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:42,350
Have you taken her to the vet?

2376
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:45,170
Well, I've changed her food a couple times.

2377
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:46,890
So...

2378
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:48,410
I know...

2379
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:49,190
Like I've been...

2380
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:49,450
It's...

2381
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:51,450
When I got her...

2382
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:54,930
I tried weaning her off the food that they gave me.

2383
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:55,870
That she was used to.

2384
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:57,050
But...

2385
01:53:57,970 --> 01:53:58,490
She...

2386
01:53:59,130 --> 01:53:59,650
Didn't...

2387
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:00,650
She wouldn't eat it.

2388
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,890
And so...

2389
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:03,530
I started giving her a new food.

2390
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:04,130
And then...

2391
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:05,970
She had a bad tummy ache.

2392
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:07,170
And I was like...

2393
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:08,770
I can't pinpoint the problem.

2394
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:10,010
Ugh.

2395
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:11,010
I'm like...

2396
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:11,330
Is she...

2397
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,510
Is she like...

2398
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:14,430
Has a sensitive stomach to something?

2399
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:15,370
Or...

2400
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:17,810
I had a shitty kitty.

2401
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:18,390
It sucked.

2402
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:21,030
Oh, I've never had...

2403
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,590
She's not using the box.

2404
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:23,190
No, she is.

2405
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:23,670
She is.

2406
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:24,130
She is.

2407
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:26,030
It's just...

2408
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:28,310
She poops liquid.

2409
01:54:32,190 --> 01:54:33,230
Well, sometimes.

2410
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:34,010
Not always.

2411
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:35,330
It's just...

2412
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:36,210
It's been so bad.

2413
01:54:36,330 --> 01:54:38,090
It's been so stressful on me.

2414
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:40,290
I'm just...

2415
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,110
I'm just cleaning up poop all the time.

2416
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:44,730
Ugh.

2417
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:48,030
It's so bad.

2418
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:55,350
Ugh.

2419
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:00,430
Allergy?

2420
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:02,090
I thought that might be the case.

2421
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:03,410
So I've tried like...

2422
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:04,690
You know, I was like...

2423
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:05,130
Maybe...

2424
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:06,090
The worst...

2425
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:07,750
The worst of it was when she had chicken.

2426
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:09,430
And so I thought maybe she can't have chicken.

2427
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:11,270
And then I would try something else.

2428
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:12,850
And then she would still be poopy.

2429
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:14,750
Oh, man.

2430
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:17,850
Everything is poop.

2431
01:55:18,010 --> 01:55:18,310
Oh, man.

2432
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:19,210
Oh, man.

2433
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:20,230
My God.

2434
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:32,110
Thanks, Ocelot, for the super chat.

2435
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:37,830
Anyway, sorry about that.

2436
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:40,150
Why did I think about that?

2437
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:43,710
Why did I think about my cat's poop?

2438
01:55:46,870 --> 01:55:47,430
It's okay.

2439
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:48,010
It's okay.

2440
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:49,570
It's okay.

2441
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:51,950
It's okay.

2442
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:56,590
It's okay.

2443
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:58,210
Have you went to the vet to check their stomach?

2444
01:55:58,330 --> 01:55:58,750
Not yet!

2445
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:07,230
Actually, I had to take Butaro to the emergency vet.

2446
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,570
Like, literally a couple days ago.

2447
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:13,570
I had to take him to the emergency vet.

2448
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:19,950
It's just been... I'm like, oh my god, I've just been running back and forth to vets.

2449
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:24,330
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

2450
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:26,630
I might have had a minor breakdown about it today.

2451
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:29,110
When I was cleaning up shit.

2452
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:31,170
So I think that's why I'm so tired.

2453
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:32,730
Is he okay?

2454
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:33,570
Yeah, he's okay.

2455
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:34,250
He's fine.

2456
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:37,470
He had a cold and he wasn't getting over it.

2457
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:39,330
So I just had to get him some extra antibiotics.

2458
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:42,230
So... yeah.

2459
01:56:47,290 --> 01:56:48,830
Anyway... anyway... okay.

2460
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:52,130
Vet cost... oh my god.

2461
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:53,730
I've probably...

2462
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:57,270
Yeah, I don't even want to think about how much I've spent on...

2463
01:56:57,270 --> 01:57:00,350
Luckily, I'm in a position where I can afford it, right?

2464
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:02,290
But... oh god.

2465
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:13,000
But Butaro is doing much better now.

2466
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,720
He got... he got his shots.

2467
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:19,820
He got some antibiotic shots and stuff, so...

2468
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:21,660
Yeah.

2469
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,080
Yeah.

2470
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:30,080
Survival of the fittest cats.

2471
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:30,620
No!

2472
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:37,150
Is YouTube finally paying you?

2473
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:38,650
Oh my gosh, I got paid today!

2474
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:39,690
Yes!

2475
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,450
I got paid!

2476
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:44,290
I got paid!

2477
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:44,650
Yippee!

2478
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:49,170
Oh my gosh, no!

2479
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:51,450
Thank you for the vodka soup, but please don't!

2480
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,390
I feel like you have to...

2481
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:56,490
Actually... I feel like I could have sent dozens of vodkas with the vodka.

2482
01:57:56,490 --> 01:57:58,390
When my cat was having seizures.

2483
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:00,670
I know!

2484
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:01,770
Oh, I know, I know!

2485
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:02,130
Please!

2486
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:03,870
No, don't send those.

2487
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:06,490
Actually, like...

2488
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:10,310
It's...

2489
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:11,850
It's okay.

2490
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:13,090
It's all good.

2491
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:14,490
It's all good.

2492
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:15,830
I don't need like extra or anything.

2493
01:58:16,150 --> 01:58:16,750
I'm all good.

2494
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:17,910
Are you sure?

2495
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:19,530
Yes, I'm 100%.

2496
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:24,430
You guys already do so much as it is.

2497
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:25,610
You guys already do so much as it is.

2498
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:25,890
So...

2499
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:31,120
Yeah...

2500
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:33,660
Anyway...

2501
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:35,920
This particular...

2502
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:36,820
Let's get back to the game, right?

2503
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:40,540
This particular communication was about making a deal with a certain foreign country.

2504
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:40,840
This particular communication was about making a deal with a certain foreign country.

2505
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,660
Oh, he said he wanted them to buy him.

2506
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:46,700
Whoa, you can see his outline.

2507
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:48,380
Whoa!

2508
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:51,180
It looks... Wait, can you guys see it?

2509
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,140
An OBS?

2510
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:53,000
I can see it.

2511
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:53,460
It looks so cool.

2512
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,500
You cannot stop me.

2513
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,200
Stop!

2514
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:57,040
Oh...

2515
01:58:58,820 --> 01:59:00,480
I think she's just, you know...

2516
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,640
She's a kitten and...

2517
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:03,820
It's growing pains, maybe.

2518
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,560
You can't see him?

2519
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:06,220
That's so weird.

2520
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:08,500
Maybe if I... I'm gonna take a picture.

2521
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:08,900
Oh, wait.

2522
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:10,640
Oh, I can't take a picture.

2523
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,360
It won't show up.

2524
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:12,020
I don't think.

2525
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,080
Oh, it does.

2526
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:17,700
Oh, no, it doesn't.

2527
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,080
Dang.

2528
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,160
Never mind.

2529
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:21,140
That's so weird.

2530
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:23,080
Anyway...

2531
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,000
He said he wanted them to buy him.

2532
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:26,520
Him and his powers.

2533
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:27,360
Buy him?

2534
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:32,840
That's how we first heard about him.

2535
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,340
Of course, we didn't know what he looked like at the time.

2536
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:41,180
And in order to prove these powers of his, gave them two predictions.

2537
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:44,960
He foresaw two completely preposterous impossible cases.

2538
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:49,720
The case of a man who would sing national secrets during a live rock concert broadcast.

2539
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:54,920
In the case of a man who would take the chief commissioner hostage in his own office.

2540
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,340
Mmm, those two wonderful things.

2541
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:27,300
Cool inmates at the special prison, eh?

2542
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:29,660
Submarine that belongs to the other country in this deal.

2543
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:31,740
Submarine!

2544
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:37,100
But we haven't been able to find out where it's going to surface.

2545
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:42,180
It's terrifying to think what would happen if his powers were to fall into their hands.

2546
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:43,200
That means we just have to...

2547
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:48,260
Wait, we can teleport back to the south and we can listen in on stuff.

2548
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:51,840
I don't know.

2549
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,960
If Blue Country has Blue Lady...

2550
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:56,000
Doesn't seem so bad.

2551
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:58,220
Right.

2552
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:01,120
Highly unlikely they'd use him for peaceful purposes.

2553
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,140
And now they have that little girl as a hostage.

2554
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:07,740
Camilla...

2555
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,820
We have to stop him before he leaves the country!

2556
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:12,360
Sorry.

2557
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:15,420
Spotless record.

2558
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:17,920
A spotless record of yours.

2559
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,880
Is it really that important to you?

2560
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:21,600
Of course, baby.

2561
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:24,640
In some ways it's more important to me than my life.

2562
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:26,300
Than your life, eh?

2563
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,320
Of course.

2564
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:33,420
After all, it's because of my record that I'm able to get my hands on all intel as head of the Special Investigation Unit.

2565
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,640
I'm moving to Blue Lady Country.

2566
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,700
All in favor of moving to Blue Lady Country, say aye!

2567
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:44,180
Aye!

2568
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:44,500
Aye!

2569
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:45,260
Aye!

2570
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:46,180
Aye!

2571
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:46,560
Aye!

2572
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:47,000
Aye!

2573
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:47,340
Aye!

2574
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:47,500
Aye!

2575
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:47,860
Aye!

2576
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:48,420
Aye!

2577
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,160
Aye!

2578
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:52,820
Aye!

2579
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:57,220
Because of my position.

2580
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:01,860
I get to direct all aspects of the investigation into the manipulator case.

2581
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,880
What confuses me about this, though, is he knew all of this.

2582
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:10,120
But still was going to allow Detective Jowd to be executed?

2583
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,640
Oh, but I guess that would...

2584
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:14,260
Because Detective Jowd confessed, right?

2585
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,720
And he wanted the spotless record.

2586
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:17,720
Never mind.

2587
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:21,880
Consider Country with Blue Lady also have...

2588
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:22,980
Blue Shaggy.

2589
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:32,410
All in favor of killing Blue Shaggy, say aye!

2590
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:34,250
Aye!

2591
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:34,550
Aye!

2592
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:36,730
Oh, pick me, my lord, pick me!

2593
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:39,170
Aye.

2594
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:43,330
Yeah!

2595
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:44,070
Aye!

2596
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,390
No, not my Oshie.

2597
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:50,950
Your Oshie killed a dog.

2598
02:02:51,070 --> 02:02:51,970
What are you talking about?

2599
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:56,650
Your Oshie killed my Oshie.

2600
02:02:58,410 --> 02:02:59,010
Your Oshie killed my Oshie.

2601
02:02:59,010 --> 02:02:59,910
The manipulator case?

2602
02:03:00,150 --> 02:03:02,710
That's why you cared about your record so much?

2603
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:04,770
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

2604
02:03:04,930 --> 02:03:08,830
I think the manipulator case is a really big thing to care about.

2605
02:03:09,070 --> 02:03:09,510
Right?

2606
02:03:09,690 --> 02:03:16,790
Like, this guy is able to transcend time and space and people and dimensions.

2607
02:03:17,170 --> 02:03:21,250
I think that's a pretty big threat to international security.

2608
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:23,630
Of course.

2609
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:25,110
Why else, baby?

2610
02:03:25,650 --> 02:03:27,370
Yeah, it seems like a pretty big deal.

2611
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:32,710
I just could never believe it, man.

2612
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:34,430
Zhao shooting Alma.

2613
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:36,670
I didn't care that he confessed.

2614
02:03:36,990 --> 02:03:38,990
There was definitely something more to the story.

2615
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:40,210
Some secret.

2616
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:44,930
I did everything I could to climb the ladder.

2617
02:03:45,090 --> 02:03:46,350
Everything in my power.

2618
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:48,410
And then I finally found the answer.

2619
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:50,890
It took five long years.

2620
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:52,730
The manipulator.

2621
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:54,930
He's going to prove that Zhao is innocent.

2622
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:56,010
Yeah!

2623
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:57,450
What incredible determination.

2624
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,110
Oh.

2625
02:04:00,910 --> 02:04:01,810
Cabanela's determination.

2626
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:05,070
Went after consulting with scientists.

2627
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:06,690
You're not a byproduct.

2628
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:07,470
Radiation.

2629
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:08,150
But a...

2630
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:10,370
Byproduct.

2631
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:11,550
Electrolyte.

2632
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,140
Am I a vampire too?

2633
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:20,600
My god.

2634
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,680
There's one thing I just don't understand.

2635
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:31,140
If you were so determined to help Detective Zhao...

2636
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,320
Why didn't you help him escape from prison?

2637
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:36,620
Perfect record.

2638
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:37,240
Perfect record.

2639
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,820
That's an easy one, baby.

2640
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:41,380
Escaping from prison is a crime.

2641
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:52,270
I wasn't about to help him commit a crime after spending five years trying to prove him innocent.

2642
02:04:52,270 --> 02:04:56,410
And he himself has to be executed, you know?

2643
02:04:56,750 --> 02:05:00,830
As a man of the law, I had to make sure that the execution was stopped legally.

2644
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:05,850
That's why I brought him before the justice minister too.

2645
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:09,390
I needed to buy as much time as I possibly could, baby.

2646
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:11,050
Thank you, thank you.

2647
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:11,950
You're welcome.

2648
02:05:12,910 --> 02:05:14,430
I think they're a little backed up.

2649
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,650
Wrong forever, thank you.

2650
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:18,090
You remember how this game used to be?

2651
02:05:18,230 --> 02:05:20,170
Haha, this guy is one step ahead, Tengo.

2652
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:23,890
And this ghost leaves two times, but mint.

2653
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:27,510
Now it's about revengeance and aliens and crazy plot twists?

2654
02:05:27,790 --> 02:05:28,430
Freaky.

2655
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:30,730
So true.

2656
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:35,390
I love this soundtrack so much.

2657
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:35,970
It's so good.

2658
02:05:36,990 --> 02:05:39,870
But there's one little unfortunate result of all of this.

2659
02:05:40,130 --> 02:05:42,890
Lin completely misunderstood your intentions.

2660
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:44,410
Ha!

2661
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:46,410
What's a little misunderstanding?

2662
02:05:46,970 --> 02:05:48,290
My baby will come around.

2663
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:49,310
Give it time.

2664
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:53,350
But there are more important things to do with our time tonight.

2665
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:56,790
Trauma is one of the best tracks?

2666
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:57,950
Is that what this is called?

2667
02:05:58,930 --> 02:05:59,430
Trauma!

2668
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:01,270
Thank you, thank you.

2669
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:01,850
Chu!

2670
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:02,570
Chu!

2671
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:05,690
I came back from a three mile walk with my dog.

2672
02:06:08,510 --> 02:06:11,430
All I hear is mint talking about liquid poop.

2673
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:11,810
Thank you, thank you.

2674
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:13,850
I'm sorry, Kitty Funs.

2675
02:06:13,850 --> 02:06:14,570
Thank you.

2676
02:06:14,570 --> 02:06:15,250
Thank you, Hyper.

2677
02:06:15,610 --> 02:06:16,350
Thank you, thank you.

2678
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:16,490
Thank you.

2679
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:22,770
So that contraption in the basement here, you built that to try and help Detective Jowd?

2680
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:25,030
That's right.

2681
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:28,450
Jowd and I worked together back when I was with the Force.

2682
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:32,210
I used the reports of his case to try and recreate the device.

2683
02:06:32,970 --> 02:06:36,610
But there was just one part of it that I couldn't reproduce.

2684
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:38,530
No matter how hard I tried.

2685
02:06:38,870 --> 02:06:39,550
What is it?

2686
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:40,950
The cupid turning around?

2687
02:06:43,730 --> 02:06:44,210
RRR!

2688
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:48,410
Thank you for the pink donut.

2689
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:49,630
Thank you so much.

2690
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,670
No super chats.

2691
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:51,310
Got it.

2692
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:54,350
Thank you.

2693
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:55,890
Blue cheese!

2694
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:56,770
Thanks for the thank you.

2695
02:06:56,930 --> 02:06:58,070
Thank you so much.

2696
02:06:58,130 --> 02:06:58,490
Thank you.

2697
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:01,310
Camilla told Jowd...

2698
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:02,050
Oh my goodness.

2699
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:03,570
Missile!

2700
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:05,030
Blue lady is hot.

2701
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:06,150
Shaggy?

2702
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:11,740
Liquid poop is the best part.

2703
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:12,280
No.

2704
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,280
How do I say your name?

2705
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:16,980
Is it Ian Tua or is it Lan Tua?

2706
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:24,220
I can't tell if it's an L, lower case L or an upper case I.

2707
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:33,000
My friend Bob Sacamano had a kitten and I visited him once and I was going to return some pants.

2708
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,880
The cat shat right on your neck.

2709
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,640
I'm sorry.

2710
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:42,280
That's not funny.

2711
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:43,340
You were going to return them.

2712
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,120
That's so sad.

2713
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,260
Kittens gonna kitten I guess.

2714
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:48,700
I guess.

2715
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:52,520
Camilla told Jowd it had something it shouldn't have.

2716
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:53,540
Wait.

2717
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,420
Told Jowd it did something it shouldn't have.

2718
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:57,080
Made an impossible move.

2719
02:07:57,860 --> 02:07:59,100
Lan Tua like liquid.

2720
02:07:59,220 --> 02:07:59,400
Oh!

2721
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,060
Thank you guys.

2722
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:00,460
Thank you.

2723
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:03,800
They said it's an L.

2724
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:04,800
Thank you!

2725
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:09,380
I added that part to the device I recreated.

2726
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:12,880
I put in a part that would allow Cupid to rotate.

2727
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:14,580
Otherwise the gun wouldn't fire.

2728
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:18,440
So that must mean somebody manipulated Camilla's contraption.

2729
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:23,720
As a result, we proved to ourselves that the manipulator actually existed.

2730
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:26,920
Lin!

2731
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,300
Inspector Cabanilla!

2732
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:32,980
Hey baby.

2733
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:39,520
Oh my god.

2734
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:40,580
He's so awesome.

2735
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:42,820
Sorry about that phone call.

2736
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,980
I must have sounded like a real villain.

2737
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:46,580
He's so smooth.

2738
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:46,960
I know!

2739
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:47,940
Oh my gosh.

2740
02:08:48,740 --> 02:08:50,860
I hate it to spoil your image of me.

2741
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:54,900
Of that cool cat inspector you always looked up to.

2742
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:57,620
Is that really the image she had of him?

2743
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:08,270
Inspector Cabanilla.

2744
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:09,010
I'm sorry.

2745
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:09,890
I just heard.

2746
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:14,050
You were chasing after that man all this time to try and help Detective Jowd.

2747
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:19,970
This manipulator is such a dangerous character.

2748
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:22,290
I was hoping you didn't have to be involved.

2749
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:23,070
Ow.

2750
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:24,010
I just bit my tongue.

2751
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:30,980
I'm sorry.

2752
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,580
You're right.

2753
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:37,560
I will knock you off your feet as it will be.

2754
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:40,780
No, it's not.

2755
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:44,100
You're just a coward.

2756
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:44,880
I'm sorry.

2757
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:45,560
I'm sorry.

2758
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:46,800
Me neither.

2759
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,940
You are my last hope.

2760
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,740
I'm sorry.

2761
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:55,760
I'm sorry for everything you've done for me the last time.

2762
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:56,700
I'm sorry.

2763
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:58,780
I've been ripped for a while now.

2764
02:09:59,220 --> 02:09:59,900
Thanks, though.

2765
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:00,920
Oh, Raiders!

2766
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:01,500
Thank you!

2767
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,600
Alien!

2768
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,380
I couldn't catch the rest of it, but thank you!

2769
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,420
Thanks for the raid!

2770
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:08,720
Hello.

2771
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:13,100
If you've never played Ghost Trick, you're probably going to be kind of lost.

2772
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:15,300
And if you plan on playing Ghost Trick...

2773
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:19,660
This is spoilers, I think.

2774
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,920
But thanks for the raiding!

2775
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:23,640
Thank you!

2776
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,260
Murphy, thanks for the 10 gifted!

2777
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:28,140
Thank you, thank you!

2778
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,320
White on white text, I know.

2779
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:33,200
Tonight...

2780
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:39,360
Tonight, I'm going to die in your arms!

2781
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:40,660
Wait.

2782
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,140
Wait.

2783
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:43,540
I think I got it wrong.

2784
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,640
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

2785
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:49,800
Prunk for Robin, thanks for the 5 gifted!

2786
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:52,560
I really thought we finally had him.

2787
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:53,620
But my body...

2788
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:55,880
My body gave out on me right at the critical moment.

2789
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:57,840
It's like a cruel joke.

2790
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,520
But a joke is a joke.

2791
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:04,040
You might as well laugh.

2792
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:05,660
Jowd!

2793
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:08,700
The minister called off the execution order!

2794
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:13,300
And while he was at it, he let Detective Jowd go free until tomorrow morning, too!

2795
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,900
That's a pretty extreme, while he was at it.

2796
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:21,800
The Chad is here.

2797
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:23,820
With his massive chin.

2798
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:27,440
Sorry, I took so long to get here.

2799
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:28,780
Yeah, I kept you waiting, huh?

2800
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:31,140
You can leave the rest to me.

2801
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:33,140
There you go again.

2802
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:34,620
You've always been like that.

2803
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:39,120
You make everybody else run around, and then you swoop in at the last second.

2804
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:40,840
Jowd.

2805
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:46,150
He kept his coat!

2806
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:51,990
Five years ago, you left this coat with me just before you turned yourself in.

2807
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:54,810
I promise to give it back to you one day.

2808
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:56,650
The pigeon!

2809
02:11:56,790 --> 02:11:57,430
Pigeon delivery!

2810
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:02,080
What the?

2811
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,120
He's still in his prison clothes.

2812
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,480
He's in his little onesie.

2813
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,720
I've been waiting so long, Detective Jowd!

2814
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:13,720
We are so back!

2815
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,740
Look how cool he looks.

2816
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,380
I'm waiting for this day to come!

2817
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:21,240
Thanks for not giving up on me, Lin.

2818
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:24,340
Okay, I'm off then.

2819
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,720
Good luck, my old friend.

2820
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:30,920
Yeah, prison onesie!

2821
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:33,940
Yeah!

2822
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:36,400
Hypnosis!

2823
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:38,680
Oh, this present you gave me.

2824
02:12:38,860 --> 02:12:39,860
It's just what I needed.

2825
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:40,640
Thank you.

2826
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:42,760
Glad you like it.

2827
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:49,200
They don't even look at each other when they send each other off.

2828
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:50,360
So cool.

2829
02:12:51,820 --> 02:12:52,680
So cool.

2830
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:54,520
Cecil, are you there?

2831
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:55,920
Yeah, I'm here.

2832
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:58,660
You and I have to go find that man.

2833
02:12:58,940 --> 02:12:59,920
I need your help.

2834
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:01,040
Will you do this with me?

2835
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:02,480
Sure, but how?

2836
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:05,660
We don't know where the submarine is and the phone line doesn't...

2837
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:06,620
Oh, the phone doesn't work.

2838
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:07,880
That's news to me.

2839
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:10,640
They use communication cables to make their...

2840
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:12,040
Communication cables.

2841
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,480
To make their calls.

2842
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,840
The doges write themselves.

2843
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:19,400
Sorry, I have my goggles on, you know?

2844
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:21,040
Sorry, I have my goggles on, you know?

2845
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:21,660
You're hooked up somehow.

2846
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:22,420
You'll see.

2847
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:24,280
Could you wait here until we do?

2848
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:25,360
Please?

2849
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:26,500
Okay, fine.

2850
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:27,720
I'm counting on you.

2851
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,700
This true self you're looking for.

2852
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:32,640
I bet you'll find it soon.

2853
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,700
Alright, I'm leaving, Inspector Cabanela.

2854
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:41,690
It's almost dawn.

2855
02:13:42,250 --> 02:13:43,610
I'm not who I thought I was.

2856
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:45,930
I'm actually further from knowing who I am than ever.

2857
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:47,750
But now I don't feel so alone.

2858
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:48,490
Yeah.

2859
02:13:48,690 --> 02:13:49,790
Oh yeah, they didn't disconnect.

2860
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:50,230
They're right.

2861
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:51,610
Just got major...

2862
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:53,470
Snoss-a-lott.

2863
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:58,350
Snoss-a-lott vibes.

2864
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:05,050
Why do you think I like Sissel and Inspector Cabanela?

2865
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:10,130
Snoss-a-lott works though.

2866
02:14:10,570 --> 02:14:11,130
Snotticon?

2867
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:15,250
Snotticon for these two is snoss-a-lott for Inspector Cabanela and Sissel.

2868
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:18,210
I mistyped.

2869
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:23,390
Each one of us, for his or her own reasons, is looking for the truth.

2870
02:14:23,770 --> 02:14:27,130
Together, I think we can shed light on these mysteries and drive away the darkness.

2871
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:28,490
But it's almost dawn.

2872
02:14:28,670 --> 02:14:29,890
This was a long chapter.

2873
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:30,590
Two hours.

2874
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,050
Wow.

2875
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:32,450
We're gonna...

2876
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:35,250
We're gonna be in it tonight, you guys.

2877
02:14:36,290 --> 02:14:37,830
Maybe I should have started sooner.

2878
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:42,710
This is my formal apology for thinking Cabanela is one of the blue guys last stream.

2879
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:45,550
He's now just below missile and coolness.

2880
02:14:45,670 --> 02:14:46,130
I agree.

2881
02:14:46,350 --> 02:14:47,370
I agree, David.

2882
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:51,210
We got a new background, but it's just black.

2883
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:53,750
There's nothing...

2884
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:54,590
Oh, wait!

2885
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:55,370
I see what it is.

2886
02:14:55,450 --> 02:14:56,090
I think.

2887
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:57,070
It's...

2888
02:14:57,070 --> 02:14:59,330
I think it's the sidebars.

2889
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:00,530
Oh, neat!

2890
02:15:01,190 --> 02:15:01,710
Oh!

2891
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:02,150
Oh!

2892
02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:05,990
Ghost trick!

2893
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:08,690
Langering death.

2894
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:09,950
Did you guys like the thumbnail?

2895
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:13,290
I even, like, manipulated my body so that...

2896
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:16,810
So that it even matched the way the thumbnail looked.

2897
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:18,810
Or the portrait in the game.

2898
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:24,790
The submarine!

2899
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:27,710
Cecil!

2900
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,150
Okay, saving.

2901
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:32,510
Manipulator?

2902
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:35,070
Oh my gosh.

2903
02:15:35,570 --> 02:15:37,690
Maybe I do have the ghost trick powers.

2904
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,970
Continue playing.

2905
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:50,510
GoIbD is for backseat in cats.

2906
02:15:50,930 --> 02:15:51,770
But I.B.D.

2907
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:53,670
is sometimes as easy as...

2908
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:54,070
For the...

2909
02:15:58,090 --> 02:15:59,050
To vet.

2910
02:15:59,250 --> 02:15:59,970
I.B.D.

2911
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:02,230
worsens, not improves, for everyone with this issue.

2912
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:03,190
I...

2913
02:16:03,190 --> 02:16:03,630
You know what?

2914
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:05,070
I'm not gonna lie.

2915
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:07,590
When I...

2916
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:12,430
When I got her, I thought that, like, when she had her first pooping episode...

2917
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:13,710
This is what I was like, I wonder if she has IBS.

2918
02:16:15,610 --> 02:16:18,090
I don't know what IBD is, but I'll look into it.

2919
02:16:20,190 --> 02:16:29,390
And don't apologize for trying to help.

2920
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:30,290
I really appreciate it.

2921
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:36,310
Your inflammatory bowel disease?

2922
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:37,230
Is that it?

2923
02:16:38,970 --> 02:16:40,310
Irritable boob syndrome?

2924
02:16:40,790 --> 02:16:41,210
No!

2925
02:16:41,210 --> 02:16:43,330
Is she throwing up?

2926
02:16:43,470 --> 02:16:44,410
No, not at all.

2927
02:16:45,310 --> 02:16:46,390
No throwing up.

2928
02:16:46,530 --> 02:16:47,570
Oh, she threw up once.

2929
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:50,590
The first time I got her, but I think that was because she was stressed.

2930
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:54,910
Call it hot girl tummy problems.

2931
02:16:56,410 --> 02:16:59,050
All hot girls have IBS.

2932
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:04,530
It's because God had to nerf them a little bit.

2933
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:08,890
They had to have IBS because they're too hot.

2934
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:11,030
I'd be shitting.

2935
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:16,750
All hot girls have IBS.

2936
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:20,050
I'm a hot girl.

2937
02:17:20,230 --> 02:17:20,370
Woo!

2938
02:17:23,570 --> 02:17:24,310
Sasaki syndrome.

2939
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,810
And what do you know?

2940
02:17:26,990 --> 02:17:27,770
He's hot.

2941
02:17:29,330 --> 02:17:30,130
He's hot.

2942
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:34,010
There has to be something wrong with you.

2943
02:17:34,050 --> 02:17:35,670
You can't just be hot and normal, okay?

2944
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:37,950
What a nerf.

2945
02:17:39,690 --> 02:17:40,850
I don't have IBS.

2946
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:42,910
I don't have IBS.

2947
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:50,490
Lin kept her promise about getting me hooked up about two hours before dawn the phone rang.

2948
02:17:50,690 --> 02:17:51,650
Two hours?

2949
02:17:51,710 --> 02:17:52,110
That's it?

2950
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:53,390
Oh gosh.

2951
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:57,530
Ring-a-ling-a-ling.

2952
02:17:58,530 --> 02:17:59,530
Ring-a...

2953
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:00,990
Sorry.

2954
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:03,210
I like almost hiccuped.

2955
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:04,250
Hello?

2956
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:06,250
This is Joud.

2957
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:07,510
Sissel, are you listening?

2958
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:08,430
We need your powers.

2959
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:09,570
No time to talk.

2960
02:18:09,710 --> 02:18:10,530
We'll be waiting for you.

2961
02:18:13,270 --> 02:18:13,670
Okay.

2962
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:14,810
Is that why Johnny's hot?

2963
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:15,510
Yes.

2964
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:22,110
Look at... What is this look on the doctor... What is this look on his face?

2965
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,630
Look at his... What is this look on your face?

2966
02:18:26,970 --> 02:18:28,250
Are you looking at me?

2967
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:31,170
Well, you better get going.

2968
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:32,290
He's talking to me.

2969
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:35,670
This long night is drawing to an end.

2970
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:37,970
Yeah, looks like it.

2971
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:39,990
Thank you for all your help tonight.

2972
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:42,750
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

2973
02:18:44,430 --> 02:18:45,970
The bird bowed at me.

2974
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:49,510
At the other end of the phone line.

2975
02:18:49,710 --> 02:18:52,070
I'm finally gonna find all my answers.

2976
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:52,990
I'd better go.

2977
02:18:54,510 --> 02:18:55,570
Fourth wall break.

2978
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:58,270
He looked directly at my soul.

2979
02:18:58,570 --> 02:18:59,910
I mean, I am a soul.

2980
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:01,230
That's why I know.

2981
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:07,350
So that's why you jeans-o-fiber-fiber- What are you talking about?

2982
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:09,450
What are you talking about, Misfits?

2983
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:13,070
A single telephone line connects me and the other sisal.

2984
02:19:13,210 --> 02:19:17,590
But that single line spreads out like a spider's web to ensnare the fates of many people.

2985
02:19:20,090 --> 02:19:21,210
How'd they get in?

2986
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:23,730
When I just reached the center of the web.

2987
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:29,560
Whoa.

2988
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:29,700
Whoa.

2989
02:19:36,890 --> 02:19:39,650
Fiber-fiber-fiber-fiber-fiber.

2990
02:19:39,990 --> 02:19:41,410
Eat more fiber.

2991
02:19:42,270 --> 02:19:44,370
Welcome to the Yonoa.

2992
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:47,370
Detective Joud.

2993
02:19:47,650 --> 02:19:48,230
Oh!

2994
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:53,250
How did he get in here?

2995
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:56,230
How did you get in here?

2996
02:19:56,950 --> 02:19:59,070
Did you swim here?

2997
02:19:59,310 --> 02:20:00,050
Detective!

2998
02:20:01,570 --> 02:20:04,230
My detective sense must have gotten rusty.

2999
02:20:04,530 --> 02:20:06,770
I didn't even sense your presence here in the dark.

3000
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:08,250
He's just that good.

3001
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:12,650
That's because I switched the power to my mask-off, Detective Joud.

3002
02:20:14,490 --> 02:20:15,810
I used your phone.

3003
02:20:15,990 --> 02:20:16,990
Hope you don't mind.

3004
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:19,970
Beep-beep-beep-boop-boop-bam!

3005
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,980
You think he slaps asses like that machine?

3006
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:28,800
Hey, God!

3007
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:30,580
Never thought you'd track us here.

3008
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:33,380
Especially seeing as you are a death row inmate.

3009
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:37,200
And I'm equally surprised about your choice of transportation.

3010
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:38,740
A submarine, eh?

3011
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:41,440
No, he's a gentleman.

3012
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,020
But how did you find us, my man?

3013
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:49,360
Not even the police knew where the Yonoa was going to surface.

3014
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,380
Confounded?

3015
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:51,580
Oh, it surfaced!

3016
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,060
We detectives have a little saying.

3017
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:58,200
If there's something you want to know about a case, ask the criminals.

3018
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,020
What did he have?

3019
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:04,680
Oh, who?

3020
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:08,260
When did he...

3021
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:15,600
The bullet the man in red was shot with had a radio transmitter in it!

3022
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:17,080
What?

3023
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:24,540
I have a little something for you.

3024
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:25,660
And it's the pocket watch.

3025
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:27,480
Is it actually like a...

3026
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:33,600
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

3027
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:35,140
Oh my God, it's a Dragon Ball Scouter.

3028
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,640
Oh my God!

3029
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:42,300
Cabanela has given me some pretty weird presents in the past.

3030
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:44,400
But they always prove useful.

3031
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:47,780
This one was a radio receiver made to look like a pocket watch.

3032
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:49,320
Birkenstall!

3033
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:50,420
Welcome to membership!

3034
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:51,160
Thank you!

3035
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:54,260
Hmm, yes.

3036
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:55,520
Inspector Cabanela.

3037
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,520
I hear he's an excellent investigator.

3038
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:02,420
By the way, where is that man in red?

3039
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:05,360
I know he's on this submarine somewhere.

3040
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:08,300
That's an Ocelot move for real.

3041
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:12,080
Ah, Cecil you mean?

3042
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:24,760
I've been here the whole time.

3043
02:22:28,810 --> 02:22:31,170
Oh my God, that's so funny.

3044
02:22:33,250 --> 02:22:34,450
You can relax.

3045
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:36,330
That's nothing but his shell.

3046
02:22:36,710 --> 02:22:38,070
YouTube dying tonight.

3047
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:38,570
Uh-oh.

3048
02:22:38,630 --> 02:22:39,530
I hope everything's okay.

3049
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:42,150
His shell, eh?

3050
02:22:42,990 --> 02:22:44,930
His spirit isn't here right now.

3051
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:46,670
Most likely right about now.

3052
02:22:47,170 --> 02:22:49,310
He's controlling your daughter.

3053
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:50,270
What?

3054
02:22:53,890 --> 02:22:55,710
Please, I beg you, let my daughter go!

3055
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:57,810
If you need a hostage, take me!

3056
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:59,230
Just please, let her go!

3057
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:00,590
Bah!

3058
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:04,190
There's something our nation needs.

3059
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:05,690
Cecil has it.

3060
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,670
That's all we care about, my man.

3061
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:08,750
Nothing else matters.

3062
02:23:09,210 --> 02:23:10,750
However, it would appear...

3063
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:12,730
Cecil has underestimated us.

3064
02:23:12,910 --> 02:23:16,170
He's left behind his precious bargaining chip here.

3065
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:18,350
Bargaining chip?

3066
02:23:19,570 --> 02:23:20,170
Oh!

3067
02:23:20,170 --> 02:23:20,770
Us!

3068
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:21,650
Oh, just kidding.

3069
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:27,640
It's me!

3070
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:29,440
I thought he was gonna go...

3071
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,140
and like suck me down.

3072
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:35,560
Our nation has already researched it.

3073
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:38,300
This product that Cecil has to offer...

3074
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:39,520
The meteor.

3075
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:41,720
The source of his powers.

3076
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:43,840
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

3077
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:44,600
Slap!

3078
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:49,960
Whoa!

3079
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,140
That's a hunk of chunk!

3080
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:52,460
Wowee!

3081
02:23:56,380 --> 02:23:57,340
It's ours now.

3082
02:23:57,560 --> 02:23:58,620
Or it's theirs, I guess.

3083
02:23:59,060 --> 02:23:59,580
What?

3084
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,020
What in the world was that?

3085
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:03,800
The Temsik Fragment.

3086
02:24:04,220 --> 02:24:06,320
It gives spirits special powers.

3087
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:12,580
And now our deal with Cecil is concluded, as far as we're concerned.

3088
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:14,640
What are you talking about?

3089
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:19,320
What a mistake to make.

3090
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:25,660
Right at the most crucial moment.

3091
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:27,860
Now then, Detective Jowd.

3092
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,400
Farewell.

3093
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:35,500
Slap!

3094
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:37,760
Oh!

3095
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:40,760
Uh...

3096
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:44,780
What?

3097
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:48,420
What in the world?

3098
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:50,240
The whole room just vanished!

3099
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:51,700
Detective Jowd!

3100
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:52,840
Where did he go?

3101
02:24:55,480 --> 02:24:56,000
Where?

3102
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:00,100
Oh, because the table moved?

3103
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:02,040
The telephone went down there?

3104
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:02,560
Oh gosh.

3105
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:03,540
What's going on?

3106
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:04,760
Why is there a basketball?

3107
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:06,260
What now?

3108
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:08,320
I think I heard an explosion somewhere.

3109
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:09,280
Oh, that means...

3110
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:11,640
We'll probably have to switch things with, uh...

3111
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:13,660
With...

3112
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:14,920
Missile again.

3113
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:17,920
In any case, Lin and the little lady should be here somewhere.

3114
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,160
I smell danger.

3115
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:20,560
I'd better find them.

3116
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:21,420
And fast!

3117
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:24,020
Trick time!

3118
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:27,700
Who is this?

3119
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:31,240
So you're here, huh?

3120
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:33,220
It's Missile!

3121
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:41,000
Yes, I think even I remember who you are by now.

3122
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:44,240
It's Minto!

3123
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:48,460
What do you suppose that shock was a minute ago?

3124
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,560
I have no idea, of course!

3125
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:53,080
I'm just a little sheltered apartment dog!

3126
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:55,900
What, with my memory...

3127
02:25:55,900 --> 02:25:56,560
Loss of memory?

3128
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:57,720
I can't say much...

3129
02:25:57,720 --> 02:25:58,280
I'm much better.

3130
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:00,460
Anyway...

3131
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,060
Let's hurry up and go save Miss Lin and Miss Camilla!

3132
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:07,120
Do you think that trusty nose of yours can sniff them out?

3133
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:08,900
It's Minto!

3134
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:09,000
It's Minto!

3135
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:13,860
I'm sorry to say, I don't think it can!

3136
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:16,320
Did I even bother to ask?

3137
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:19,360
But you do have the power to swap objects.

3138
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,100
So let's find that lady detective and that little lady together.

3139
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,140
You got it!

3140
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:30,980
Ring-a-ling!

3141
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:32,580
Are those missiles?

3142
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:34,080
I think, uh...

3143
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:35,600
Are those missiles, Missile?

3144
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:40,340
I'm gonna put mint on my shower speakers.

3145
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:44,340
Have a nice shower!

3146
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:47,640
The telephone is ringing.

3147
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:49,400
Wow!

3148
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:51,720
It's Miss Camilla!

3149
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:53,000
I just know it!

3150
02:26:53,780 --> 02:26:57,180
My trusty nose is practically screaming it at me!

3151
02:26:57,560 --> 02:27:00,080
I think you'd call that more of a hunch.

3152
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:04,220
Anyway, let's get to the phone before it stops ringing.

3153
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:05,940
Those are torpedoes.

3154
02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:06,700
I guess you're right.

3155
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:08,780
You bet!

3156
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:10,940
Trick time!

3157
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:11,080
Trick time!

3158
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:13,800
Let's see...

3159
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,300
Oh, that's where Missile is.

3160
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:17,960
I can't reach anywhere else, so we're gonna...

3161
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:19,460
We're gonna...

3162
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:23,180
What is this?

3163
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:23,980
Emergency light!

3164
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:26,560
Can Missile... Oh!

3165
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:26,960
Hello?

3166
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:27,420
Hello?

3167
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:28,360
Miss Camilla!

3168
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:29,240
Hello!

3169
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:32,460
I don't think he can pick up the phone.

3170
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:34,960
It's no use!

3171
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:38,620
This black hello just doesn't like me!

3172
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:39,380
What?

3173
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:42,500
Just create a path for me, Missile!

3174
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:43,520
I'll come right over!

3175
02:27:45,580 --> 02:27:46,040
Okay.

3176
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:51,040
What do I need to switch?

3177
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:54,060
No.

3178
02:27:57,380 --> 02:28:00,500
I could switch the emergency lights, but it doesn't really do much.

3179
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:04,140
Maybe if I switch...

3180
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:04,460
Oh!

3181
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:07,640
Okay.

3182
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:10,980
He's so cute, I know.

3183
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:13,180
He's just this precious little guy.

3184
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:16,760
And...

3185
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:18,120
And switch!

3186
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:19,180
Switcheroo!

3187
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:20,760
There we go!

3188
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:23,080
Oh!

3189
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:23,600
Uh-oh!

3190
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:24,640
Uh-oh!

3191
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:25,040
Uh-oh!

3192
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:29,320
I think I just heard another little explosion in the distance.

3193
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:31,340
I've got a bad feeling about this.

3194
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:33,240
Cecil, look!

3195
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,320
That black hello...

3196
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:37,320
It came off the hook!

3197
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:39,420
Uh-oh.

3198
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:40,740
I better answer it fast!

3199
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:46,160
Easy.

3200
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,400
Hello?

3201
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,040
Is anybody there?

3202
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,360
It's her.

3203
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:52,040
The little lady.

3204
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:53,260
It's Cecil.

3205
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:53,780
Where are you?

3206
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:55,880
Somebody please answer!

3207
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:58,180
I guess she can't hear my voice.

3208
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:00,640
You too, huh?

3209
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:01,440
Oh, good.

3210
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:02,860
I thought she was ignoring me.

3211
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:04,820
Somebody help me!

3212
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:05,840
Lin...

3213
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:06,360
Uh-oh.

3214
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:08,640
It's been a while since Lin's died.

3215
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:10,080
She said Lin!

3216
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:12,060
Miss Lin!

3217
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:13,800
We'd better hurry!

3218
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:15,100
Let's go Cecil!

3219
02:29:16,420 --> 02:29:17,120
Go there!

3220
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,020
It's been a real long time since Lin's died.

3221
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:22,780
Oh, wait!

3222
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:22,940
No!

3223
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,480
She's not dead!

3224
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:23,780
She...

3225
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:23,900
Oh!

3226
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:24,760
Wait a second.

3227
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:25,420
Maybe she is dead.

3228
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:30,140
Her body is not yellow though.

3229
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:35,980
But she's kind of like...

3230
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:38,780
I thought she was just like leaning over like the staircase.

3231
02:29:40,380 --> 02:29:41,060
But, um...

3232
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:41,140
It's okay.

3233
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:41,800
Uh-oh.

3234
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:43,780
Are we gonna have to like Titanic our way out of here?

3235
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:44,500
Oh, no.

3236
02:29:48,430 --> 02:29:49,410
It's no use.

3237
02:29:49,450 --> 02:29:50,190
Nobody is answering.

3238
02:29:52,410 --> 02:29:52,970
Oh...

3239
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:56,150
Camilla...

3240
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,170
Miss...

3241
02:29:58,170 --> 02:29:59,730
Miss Camilla!

3242
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:01,090
And...

3243
02:30:01,810 --> 02:30:02,370
Miss...

3244
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:03,490
Miss Lin!

3245
02:30:04,690 --> 02:30:06,150
Oh, poor Miss Lin!

3246
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:09,090
Yeah, she can't seem to catch a break.

3247
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:11,710
Looks like another tragedy has happened.

3248
02:30:12,690 --> 02:30:13,250
Oh!

3249
02:30:13,270 --> 02:30:14,690
Sorry to keep you waiting, little...

3250
02:30:15,970 --> 02:30:17,010
little lady.

3251
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:18,210
Sissy!

3252
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:19,350
I knew you'd come!

3253
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:21,230
Miss Camilla!

3254
02:30:21,490 --> 02:30:22,510
Miss Camilla!

3255
02:30:23,230 --> 02:30:24,330
And Missle, too!

3256
02:30:24,410 --> 02:30:25,890
I'm so glad to see you're all ri...

3257
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:28,210
All right...

3258
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:29,290
Well...

3259
02:30:29,290 --> 02:30:31,650
I wouldn't say I'm all right, exactly.

3260
02:30:33,990 --> 02:30:34,950
Hey, wait a minute.

3261
02:30:35,410 --> 02:30:36,690
Missle, your voice...

3262
02:30:36,690 --> 02:30:38,770
I think I remember hearing it somewhere before.

3263
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:40,270
What?

3264
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:41,130
My voice?

3265
02:30:42,090 --> 02:30:42,610
Hmm...

3266
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:43,030
That's right.

3267
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:43,250
Come on.

3268
02:30:43,270 --> 02:30:48,410
Miss Camilla has a core now, so that means she did hear Missle's voice before when he saved her that time.

3269
02:30:49,470 --> 02:30:51,290
So that was you, wasn't it, Missle?

3270
02:30:51,810 --> 02:30:53,850
You're the one who saved me in the park tonight.

3271
02:30:55,390 --> 02:30:57,690
Thank you, Miss Camilla.

3272
02:30:58,090 --> 02:31:00,870
I'm so glad I was born your little doggy!

3273
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:14,660
Me, when I think about my Oshis, I'm so glad I was born to die to become a fan of you.

3274
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:16,620
I love you, Miss Oshis!

3275
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:22,380
Hey Miso, could you stay here and watch over your mistress for a while?

3276
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:23,420
Huh?

3277
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:25,680
But don't you need my powers?

3278
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:28,620
I'll see what I can do on my own for a while.

3279
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:32,400
After all, you're the only one who can protect her.

3280
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:35,780
Okay, I'll do it!

3281
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:37,360
I love Miso!

3282
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:41,420
I love Miso!

3283
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:49,680
I wonder what happened this time.

3284
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:51,780
I better talk to the little lady more.

3285
02:31:52,300 --> 02:31:56,840
I wonder if she got electrocuted from the water.

3286
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:58,620
I better do something about the detective lady.

3287
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,820
Oh, oh, uh, turn it?

3288
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:06,780
Okay.

3289
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,140
Lynn!

3290
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:12,780
I'm happy you died to become my Yoshi.

3291
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:15,520
Did you have to censor it because YouTube?

3292
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:17,020
I appreciate it.

3293
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:22,380
I'm glad I died too then.

3294
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:25,960
Oh, Cecil, you're here!

3295
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:30,960
Lynn, what in the world happened here?

3296
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,020
I don't know.

3297
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:35,940
Huh?

3298
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:37,840
I just sort of blacked out all of a sudden.

3299
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:39,520
Next thing I know, I was dead!

3300
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:43,900
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't know in that case, you guys.

3301
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:48,100
I think I have to go to the little ghosty's room.

3302
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,260
I think I have to go to the ghosty's room.

3303
02:32:56,080 --> 02:33:00,640
I can't believe in the two and a half hours I've left the stream three times.

3304
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:02,400
That's insane.

3305
02:33:02,820 --> 02:33:03,980
That never happens.

3306
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:06,500
I won't allow you.

3307
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:07,600
Please!

3308
02:33:08,020 --> 02:33:09,680
I prefer you dead ghost.

3309
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:15,160
That's because I have two drinks.

3310
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:22,360
Okay, you can listen to this bopping soundtrack and I'll be right back.

3311
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:26,900
I'm sorry, I just have to pee!

3312
02:33:27,980 --> 02:33:29,900
I have to expel the ectoplasm.

3313
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,200
Actually, that's not a good way to say that.

3314
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:32,760
You know what?

3315
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,540
Oh my god, when I opened the door...

3316
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:37,400
When I opened the door to leave...

3317
02:36:39,140 --> 02:36:42,380
Pies came like running at me and she was like...

3318
02:36:45,180 --> 02:36:46,660
She kept chirping at me.

3319
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:48,640
And then she was following me.

3320
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:50,220
And I fed her.

3321
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:52,640
I fed her when I went to go get the water earlier.

3322
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:54,040
So...

3323
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,820
So I know she wasn't hungry.

3324
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:58,680
I think she was like...

3325
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:00,340
Lethargic all day.

3326
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:01,760
Or it's like she slept all day.

3327
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:03,160
Because I had to give her a bath earlier.

3328
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,480
And I think it made her really tired.

3329
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,200
I had to give her a bath earlier.

3330
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:08,400
From the poop.

3331
02:37:09,620 --> 02:37:09,980
And...

3332
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:11,540
She slept all day.

3333
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:12,640
She was just sad about it.

3334
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:14,000
And now she's all like happy.

3335
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:15,780
She even followed me into the bathroom.

3336
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,460
One thing I really love about her.

3337
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:19,520
One thing that I think is the cutest thing about her.

3338
02:37:20,380 --> 02:37:21,580
She's a plopper.

3339
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:22,260
Like...

3340
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:24,080
She doesn't just like lay down normally.

3341
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:24,860
She just like...

3342
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:25,560
She goes like...

3343
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:28,860
She's so cute.

3344
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:31,340
So like...

3345
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:32,880
She even followed me into the bathroom.

3346
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:33,880
And was just like...

3347
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:34,400
La la la.

3348
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:35,140
Hello.

3349
02:37:35,580 --> 02:37:35,980
Hello.

3350
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:36,980
Hello mom.

3351
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:39,100
And then she just plopped on the ground.

3352
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:40,520
She's so cute.

3353
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:44,820
She's so cute.

3354
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:45,880
Does she spread out?

3355
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:46,580
Yes she does.

3356
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:46,980
She bananas.

3357
02:37:47,580 --> 02:37:48,800
She turns into a banana.

3358
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:52,840
She's a plopper in more ways than one.

3359
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:53,760
I hate that.

3360
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:56,120
I hate that so much.

3361
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:57,520
She's really sweet.

3362
02:37:57,680 --> 02:37:58,700
I really love her.

3363
02:37:59,220 --> 02:37:59,920
I do.

3364
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:01,400
I hope she's okay.

3365
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:03,160
It stresses me out.

3366
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:05,360
Me wondering if she's...

3367
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:07,680
Good, you know?

3368
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:08,000
What?

3369
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:08,720
How did I...

3370
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:09,220
There we go.

3371
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:12,780
Okay, let's get back to the game.

3372
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,200
Let's get back to the game.

3373
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:15,840
Bye bye.

3374
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:17,100
Bye bye.

3375
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:22,340
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't know in that case.

3376
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:23,760
I don't know what we're talking about.

3377
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:26,060
Oh, about how she died.

3378
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:26,360
That's right.

3379
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:27,840
And where's Detective Jowd?

3380
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:28,540
Is he all right?

3381
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:30,540
I don't know.

3382
02:38:31,140 --> 02:38:31,540
Huh?

3383
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,080
The room he was in just disappeared all of a sudden.

3384
02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:36,820
Rabbits do that too.

3385
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:37,460
It's so cute.

3386
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:38,080
Yeah.

3387
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:39,960
Oh.

3388
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:40,160
Oh.

3389
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:41,520
Oh.

3390
02:38:42,280 --> 02:38:44,800
Now it's all making even less sense than before.

3391
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:49,480
Give me one second.

3392
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,800
Let me check something on my phone.

3393
02:39:12,680 --> 02:39:13,560
What is...

3394
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:13,720
Wait.

3395
02:39:13,880 --> 02:39:14,940
Oh, never mind.

3396
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:15,200
Okay.

3397
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:16,000
I'm good.

3398
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:16,440
I'm good.

3399
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:17,680
Everything okay?

3400
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:18,140
Yep.

3401
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:18,940
All good.

3402
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:22,840
After we left the super's office, we followed after the man in red.

3403
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,560
We tracked him with that radio transmitter.

3404
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:25,800
Trans...

3405
02:39:26,860 --> 02:39:27,380
Transmister?

3406
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:31,180
Transmitter Inspector Calvinella fired into him with the bullet.

3407
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:37,500
The man in red took a boat out to sea from a small harbor on the edge of town.

3408
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:43,720
Detective Jowd and I managed to secretly stow away on his boat.

3409
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:48,540
And then we sneaked onto the submarine with him when it surfaced.

3410
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:53,120
Before long, the submarine dove back down again.

3411
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:53,860
Oh.

3412
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:55,400
So that's how...

3413
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:56,040
I was like...

3414
02:39:56,040 --> 02:39:56,660
How did you...

3415
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:57,800
Okay.

3416
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:58,880
Thank you for the...

3417
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:03,060
Thank you for the explanation of how he got down there under the water.

3418
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:04,260
Under the sea.

3419
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:06,460
Detective Jowd and I decided to split up.

3420
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:09,680
He would take care of the telephone line and I would look for Camilla.

3421
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,080
I found Camilla hiding here.

3422
02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:14,340
In the engine room.

3423
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:15,740
She had escaped and run away here.

3424
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:20,540
Wow.

3425
02:40:20,860 --> 02:40:21,860
That's quite an adventure.

3426
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:22,920
What happened next?

3427
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:24,880
I don't know.

3428
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:25,620
Huh?

3429
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:28,140
There was a flash of white all of a sudden.

3430
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:29,340
Next thing I know, I was dead.

3431
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:29,780
Okay.

3432
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:31,580
She definitely got electrocuted, I think.

3433
02:40:32,540 --> 02:40:33,120
Oh, boy.

3434
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:35,460
It sounds like it'd be quicker for me to see for myself.

3435
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,280
Time to rewind.

3436
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,900
Maybe from the water.

3437
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:47,760
Es...

3438
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:48,740
Yo, Noah.

3439
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:49,660
Aw.

3440
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:51,260
Camilla, are you okay?

3441
02:40:56,860 --> 02:40:57,420
Wow.

3442
02:40:57,820 --> 02:40:58,620
Oh, my God.

3443
02:40:58,960 --> 02:40:59,520
Cam...

3444
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:00,040
Camilla?

3445
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:02,220
Oh, no.

3446
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:04,700
Oh, no.

3447
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:05,800
She's getting manipulated.

3448
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:11,400
Hello, Lynn.

3449
02:41:11,740 --> 02:41:13,860
Or is it Detective now?

3450
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:16,640
It's been 10 years since we last met.

3451
02:41:22,990 --> 02:41:23,910
Are you...

3452
02:41:24,690 --> 02:41:27,350
Are you really that man from the park 10 years ago?

3453
02:41:28,210 --> 02:41:28,770
I'm sorry.

3454
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:33,120
Well, well.

3455
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:35,460
I see there's no need to introduce myself.

3456
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:38,140
Give Camilla back.

3457
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,120
She has nothing to do with any of this.

3458
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:42,720
Afraid I can't do that.

3459
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:44,380
This is my last chance.

3460
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:49,160
Look at the sass.

3461
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:50,020
The hand on the hip.

3462
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:51,360
The phone is ringing.

3463
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:53,100
It's not for me.

3464
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:54,900
Nobody ever calls the dead.

3465
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:57,920
Yo.

3466
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:00,220
Single-handedly.

3467
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:01,220
Oh, my God.

3468
02:42:01,220 --> 02:42:01,340
Oh, my God.

3469
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:06,280
The fact that you're here means that my revenge plan has failed.

3470
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:08,720
Revenge plan?

3471
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:11,600
It didn't happen tonight, did it?

3472
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:13,100
His execution.

3473
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:20,400
Well, knowing him, I half expected as much.

3474
02:42:21,380 --> 02:42:23,200
That's why I was waiting here like this.

3475
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:24,900
Waiting for him to show up.

3476
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,580
Ta-da.

3477
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:30,500
Wouldn't it be just what he wanted?

3478
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:31,540
To be executed?

3479
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:33,140
Executed by his own daughter?

3480
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:39,920
I heard about 10 years ago.

3481
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:42,720
Oh, wait, wait.

3482
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:44,240
I heard about 10 years ago.

3483
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:46,320
I feel sorry about what happened to you.

3484
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:47,800
But revenge?

3485
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:54,940
Nobody could possibly know what I've...

3486
02:42:54,940 --> 02:42:59,390
What in the world?

3487
02:42:59,450 --> 02:42:59,890
An explosion?

3488
02:43:01,370 --> 02:43:02,010
Uh-oh.

3489
02:43:02,450 --> 02:43:04,350
I've got a bad feeling about this.

3490
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:07,430
Have I been had?

3491
02:43:10,310 --> 02:43:11,030
Look out!

3492
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:19,730
Revenge, huh?

3493
02:43:20,410 --> 02:43:22,230
That's a feeling I just can't understand.

3494
02:43:23,510 --> 02:43:24,430
Of course not.

3495
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:25,410
You're not him.

3496
02:43:27,310 --> 02:43:27,970
She's right.

3497
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:29,470
I'm not him, am I?

3498
02:43:30,670 --> 02:43:32,630
He was going to shoot Detective Jowd.

3499
02:43:33,170 --> 02:43:34,030
That's Camilla.

3500
02:43:34,290 --> 02:43:35,710
When he came to rescue her.

3501
02:43:36,410 --> 02:43:37,590
It's just too horrible.

3502
02:43:39,550 --> 02:43:40,070
Anyway.

3503
02:43:40,530 --> 02:43:41,790
Let's bring you back to life.

3504
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:42,410
Again.

3505
02:43:43,670 --> 02:43:45,670
He didn't have to add the again part.

3506
02:43:47,390 --> 02:43:47,910
Hmm.

3507
02:43:48,050 --> 02:43:48,570
Okay.

3508
02:43:48,990 --> 02:43:50,350
How do we stop this?

3509
02:43:51,790 --> 02:43:52,310
How?

3510
02:43:54,030 --> 02:43:54,830
Trick time.

3511
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:55,850
How do we stop this?

3512
02:43:57,770 --> 02:43:58,570
So, let's see.

3513
02:43:58,650 --> 02:44:00,710
The cause of death this time...

3514
02:44:01,330 --> 02:44:03,230
was the mysterious explosion.

3515
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:07,490
You're pretty up.

3516
02:44:07,490 --> 02:44:08,210
For a dead woman.

3517
02:44:13,470 --> 02:44:15,390
You know how detectives love a good mystery.

3518
02:44:15,570 --> 02:44:17,010
It's like a shot of vitamins.

3519
02:44:18,070 --> 02:44:19,690
And what do you mean for a dead woman?

3520
02:44:21,950 --> 02:44:24,550
Do you guys think that I'm energetic for being so dead?

3521
02:44:26,850 --> 02:44:30,010
I guess we should look for a way to stop that explosion.

3522
02:44:31,050 --> 02:44:31,450
Okay.

3523
02:44:31,750 --> 02:44:32,810
Let's do this thing.

3524
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:36,030
Finding clues is like a dose of minerals to a detective.

3525
02:44:37,490 --> 02:44:37,770
Quite.

3526
02:44:38,370 --> 02:44:38,930
Very.

3527
02:44:39,190 --> 02:44:39,410
Yeah.

3528
02:44:40,530 --> 02:44:41,090
Woohoo!

3529
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:47,080
You're quite lively.

3530
02:44:49,320 --> 02:44:52,920
I'm afraid with my memory loss, I have no idea what vitamins are minerals.

3531
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:57,100
Rocks, fossils, rocks, fossils, rocks, and minerals.

3532
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:58,680
Are you okay?

3533
02:44:59,040 --> 02:44:59,740
Let's see.

3534
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:02,100
What do we have?

3535
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:03,580
Oh.

3536
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:05,380
Oh, yes.

3537
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:05,900
This whole...

3538
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:06,700
This whole scenario.

3539
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:08,920
Let's see.

3540
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:09,500
Oh.

3541
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:12,340
I can't get to anywhere.

3542
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:14,140
I am trapped.

3543
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:18,440
We have to wait for her to move the gun.

3544
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:28,650
I think...

3545
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:29,630
Yeah.

3546
02:45:29,810 --> 02:45:30,870
We still can't do anything.

3547
02:45:31,230 --> 02:45:31,550
Wait.

3548
02:45:31,590 --> 02:45:32,590
Can I switch to...

3549
02:45:32,590 --> 02:45:32,750
No.

3550
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:33,850
I can't switch to...

3551
02:45:36,870 --> 02:45:37,750
But also...

3552
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:38,890
If I can't switch to...

3553
02:45:38,890 --> 02:45:39,850
I wouldn't...

3554
02:45:39,850 --> 02:45:42,590
I wouldn't be able to switch things anyway, I think.

3555
02:45:42,690 --> 02:45:43,130
Because...

3556
02:45:43,130 --> 02:45:44,330
The ghost...

3557
02:45:45,010 --> 02:45:45,830
Cecil would notice.

3558
02:45:47,650 --> 02:45:49,030
No one calls for the dead.

3559
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:49,390
Oh.

3560
02:45:50,270 --> 02:45:50,670
And...

3561
02:45:50,670 --> 02:45:51,350
Here we go.

3562
02:45:52,670 --> 02:45:53,410
Trick time.

3563
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:01,200
Wait.

3564
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:02,640
But who's calling?

3565
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:10,080
I can't get the line to work.

3566
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:10,600
That's funny.

3567
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:13,060
I thought I could use the phone in the past if somebody was calling.

3568
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:13,660
Yeah.

3569
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:15,620
What are you talking about?

3570
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:17,880
The receiver has to be off the hook first, silly.

3571
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:19,280
Oh.

3572
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:21,160
Well, don't look at me.

3573
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:22,140
I can't do it.

3574
02:46:22,180 --> 02:46:22,560
I don't have time.

3575
02:46:22,560 --> 02:46:23,800
I don't have any hands or feet right now.

3576
02:46:24,540 --> 02:46:26,140
Somebody, please answer the phone.

3577
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:28,240
If you want something done, you have to do it yourself.

3578
02:46:29,460 --> 02:46:29,960
Okay.

3579
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:32,020
Let's go up here.

3580
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:37,760
This is an emergency light.

3581
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:40,340
What's...

3582
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:41,660
What does turning this do?

3583
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:45,360
Uh-huh.

3584
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:49,360
This is the phone.

3585
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:49,940
Oh.

3586
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:51,640
What about turning this too?

3587
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:52,540
Let's see.

3588
02:46:52,540 --> 02:46:52,900
Let's turn this.

3589
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:53,880
Turn.

3590
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:54,220
Turn.

3591
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:54,480
Turn.

3592
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:54,680
Oh.

3593
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:55,240
Oh.

3594
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:56,160
Oh.

3595
02:46:58,120 --> 02:46:58,940
That's what that did.

3596
02:46:59,580 --> 02:47:01,420
Hey, we somehow managed to knock down the receiver.

3597
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:02,120
That...

3598
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:05,300
I'm kind of concerned about the condition of this submarine.

3599
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:07,940
Somehow managed?

3600
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:09,820
Who's to say that's not how I planned it?

3601
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:11,000
Come on.

3602
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:11,200
Hurry.

3603
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:12,720
Now's your chance to get on the phone.

3604
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:14,380
It might be Detective Jowd.

3605
02:47:15,260 --> 02:47:15,840
She's right.

3606
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:16,740
I'd better check it out.

3607
02:47:22,150 --> 02:47:25,430
Using the new episode of the podcast to power me through...

3608
02:47:25,450 --> 02:47:26,530
finding a different job.

3609
02:47:26,910 --> 02:47:33,810
Funny that a ghost is helping me quit the job a woods gnome encouraged me to pass the interview for.

3610
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:38,580
I mean...

3611
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:40,600
Um...

3612
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:43,020
You know what?

3613
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:47,940
I think the woods gnome probably didn't know what they were talking about.

3614
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:49,660
And you know what?

3615
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:52,800
Just like I came back, there were changes.

3616
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:54,140
You have...

3617
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:55,300
You can do changes too.

3618
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:56,320
You know?

3619
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:57,740
Yeah.

3620
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:06,520
Quit your job.

3621
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:10,380
And I'll encourage you for the next one.

3622
02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:15,040
Hello.

3623
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:16,220
Anybody there?

3624
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:19,900
If anybody's still there, get yourself here on the double.

3625
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:21,280
We're about to head out.

3626
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:23,720
Speak up.

3627
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:24,720
Why don't you answer?

3628
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:26,080
Anyway.

3629
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:26,960
Come on.

3630
02:48:26,980 --> 02:48:27,440
If you're coming.

3631
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:28,540
We're leaving.

3632
02:48:29,220 --> 02:48:29,700
Oh.

3633
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:30,760
I guess I have to go.

3634
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:32,440
I guess I better go there because they're leaving.

3635
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:35,220
Get gnomed, silly.

3636
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:45,380
So I have to delay them leaving because that's the explosion.

3637
02:48:46,480 --> 02:48:48,120
So it might be true what they say.

3638
02:48:48,580 --> 02:48:50,700
That there are restless ghosts on board.

3639
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:51,080
Whoa.

3640
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:52,540
Creepy.

3641
02:48:54,600 --> 02:48:55,040
Okay.

3642
02:48:55,060 --> 02:48:55,660
We're back here.

3643
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:57,100
That does it.

3644
02:48:57,180 --> 02:48:59,220
I promise to turn over a new leaf, mom.

3645
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:00,760
I promise to turn over a new leaf, mom.

3646
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:01,540
Wait.

3647
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:02,260
Don't leave.

3648
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:07,900
Who is he calling restless ghosts?

3649
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:08,600
Yeah.

3650
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:10,300
Who is he calling restless...

3651
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:12,560
Who is he calling restless ghosts?

3652
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:19,340
Well, it's true neither of us is really resting in peace.

3653
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:21,600
Anyway.

3654
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:24,320
Looks like the sub just lost one of its crew.

3655
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:28,520
I guess that means the fate of this sub has changed slightly.

3656
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:29,400
Oh.

3657
02:49:30,940 --> 02:49:31,500
Okay.

3658
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:31,900
Nice.

3659
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:36,300
Sizzle has underestimated us.

3660
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:38,900
He's left behind his precious bargaining chip here.

3661
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:39,480
Okay.

3662
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:41,660
This is when they take the stone.

3663
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:45,280
Okay.

3664
02:49:45,380 --> 02:49:46,140
There goes the phone.

3665
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:48,500
Detective Jowd.

3666
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:49,680
What's going on there?

3667
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:52,400
I saw this little deal go down once before.

3668
02:49:52,860 --> 02:49:53,820
Just a moment.

3669
02:49:53,900 --> 02:49:58,380
The man in red is about to get his Temsik fragment taken away.

3670
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:01,840
Okay.

3671
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:02,900
So...

3672
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:03,160
Okay.

3673
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:03,940
Do I have to go up there?

3674
02:50:04,600 --> 02:50:05,420
What's happening?

3675
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:11,820
They decided to conclude the deal without the other party present.

3676
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:17,120
They're just going to go ahead and steal the Temsik fragment.

3677
02:50:18,140 --> 02:50:19,100
But that's...

3678
02:50:19,820 --> 02:50:20,800
That's cheating!

3679
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:26,200
I think we have more important things to think about right now.

3680
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:29,000
Where is the Temsik fragment going to go?

3681
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:30,500
True.

3682
02:50:30,620 --> 02:50:31,080
True.

3683
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:31,360
True.

3684
02:50:31,380 --> 02:50:31,600
True.

3685
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:31,960
True.

3686
02:50:35,360 --> 02:50:37,100
If I open this...

3687
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:37,700
Boink.

3688
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:38,160
Oh.

3689
02:50:42,450 --> 02:50:42,770
Wait.

3690
02:50:45,870 --> 02:50:46,190
Okay.

3691
02:50:46,330 --> 02:50:46,570
Hold on.

3692
02:50:46,910 --> 02:50:47,230
Open.

3693
02:50:48,670 --> 02:50:49,310
And go.

3694
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:50,610
Now.

3695
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:53,900
Oh.

3696
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:54,320
I'm stuck.

3697
02:50:56,360 --> 02:50:56,680
Wait.

3698
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:56,960
Wait.

3699
02:50:56,980 --> 02:50:57,800
I'm going to be stuck though.

3700
02:50:58,700 --> 02:50:59,620
What's this valve do?

3701
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:00,800
Beep.

3702
02:51:00,860 --> 02:51:00,980
Beep.

3703
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:01,100
Beep.

3704
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:03,620
Oh.

3705
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:04,220
Oh.

3706
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:04,800
There it goes.

3707
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:05,180
There it goes.

3708
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:05,540
There it goes.

3709
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:06,980
Oh.

3710
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:07,380
And up.

3711
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:07,820
Is it easy?

3712
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:09,140
Oh my god.

3713
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:15,060
Why are there so many men in the submarine?

3714
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:20,060
The Temsik fragment.

3715
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:24,120
The objective has been achieved.

3716
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:26,600
Now we detach the control room as planned.

3717
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:27,980
Yes, sir.

3718
02:51:28,180 --> 02:51:28,960
Farewell, sir.

3719
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:32,060
Yeah.

3720
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:33,480
It's like a clown car for real.

3721
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:34,240
Clown sub.

3722
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:38,440
Cecil, what just happened?

3723
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:39,020
Oh.

3724
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:41,200
The whole room just disappeared with Detective Joud in it.

3725
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:43,340
Don't worry, Lin.

3726
02:51:44,500 --> 02:51:46,620
I bet Detective Joud can take care of himself.

3727
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:50,040
The main thing right now is rescuing you and the little lady.

3728
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:53,120
I can't believe this is happening.

3729
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:59,640
Now then, I'd better hurry along before Cecil discovers what he's lost and comes after me.

3730
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:02,140
The Yanoa will be his coffin.

3731
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:03,180
Oh.

3732
02:52:07,880 --> 02:52:10,580
May it lie buried here in the deep sea.

3733
02:52:10,580 --> 02:52:11,320
Forever.

3734
02:52:13,320 --> 02:52:14,520
Farewell, Cecil.

3735
02:52:18,720 --> 02:52:19,740
There he goes.

3736
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:21,820
Oh, and that's why the water starts to rise too.

3737
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:23,000
I think.

3738
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:26,180
These poor guys.

3739
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:30,540
Oh.

3740
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:34,340
There he goes.

3741
02:52:34,820 --> 02:52:35,760
Taking off.

3742
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:38,760
Hmm.

3743
02:52:40,140 --> 02:52:40,740
Oh.

3744
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:42,600
So that's the cause of death.

3745
02:52:43,900 --> 02:52:46,800
I think we probably gotta get the little handle thing down there, right?

3746
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:47,620
What is?

3747
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:50,480
Don't tell me that's another thing you've forgotten.

3748
02:52:51,020 --> 02:52:51,900
The torpedo!

3749
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:53,280
It's like...

3750
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:55,440
Well, you've heard of a missile before, haven't you?

3751
02:52:56,020 --> 02:52:56,840
Yeah, the dog.

3752
02:52:57,580 --> 02:52:59,820
But a different missile comes more readily to mind.

3753
02:53:00,900 --> 02:53:03,720
It looks like he plans to sink the submarine with that thing.

3754
02:53:05,220 --> 02:53:09,300
I mean, all you have to do is just not let it rise to the surface.

3755
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:12,520
All you have to do is just let it...

3756
02:53:12,840 --> 02:53:13,700
sit at the bottom.

3757
02:53:13,860 --> 02:53:14,180
Right?

3758
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:16,180
This is not good.

3759
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:19,280
We have to do something before that torpedo is fired.

3760
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:20,560
Okay.

3761
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:23,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3762
02:53:24,940 --> 02:53:25,260
Uh...

3763
02:53:25,620 --> 02:53:25,940
Lower!

3764
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:28,060
It won't budge.

3765
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:28,780
Maybe it's broken.

3766
02:53:29,380 --> 02:53:29,820
Oh, well.

3767
02:53:29,860 --> 02:53:31,360
I guess I don't have to lower it right now.

3768
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:35,280
And even if I had to move it, I could probably get Lynn to do it for me.

3769
02:53:35,620 --> 02:53:35,940
Oh.

3770
02:53:35,960 --> 02:53:37,020
What are you talking about?

3771
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:38,260
What about this one?

3772
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:42,440
Nothing's happening.

3773
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:45,920
You done goofed?

3774
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:46,340
Uh-oh.

3775
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,100
Sure seems like it should do something.

3776
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:50,980
Maybe it's just some kind of ornament.

3777
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:52,780
Uh...

3778
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:54,200
We can't let it launch!

3779
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:55,220
I think it's launched.

3780
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:57,360
I think it's launched!

3781
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:58,780
What can we do?

3782
02:53:59,320 --> 02:54:01,240
Let's just get to the torpedo as fast as we can.

3783
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:03,120
Maybe we can find a way to stop it somehow.

3784
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:04,260
Somehow?

3785
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:06,120
A true detective never gives up.

3786
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:08,680
Well, we certainly can't just ignore it.

3787
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:10,400
Uh...

3788
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:11,920
Uh...

3789
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:12,600
Boy.

3790
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:13,840
I think we've lost our chance.

3791
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:16,160
Uh...

3792
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:17,180
What was my chance?

3793
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:18,200
Was it with the rock?

3794
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:19,040
Or...

3795
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:20,620
Um...

3796
02:54:21,440 --> 02:54:23,580
Maybe when I launch this up, it's...

3797
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:24,980
I attach myself to the rock?

3798
02:54:26,700 --> 02:54:27,180
Or...

3799
02:54:32,600 --> 02:54:34,300
I guess we'll just see what happens.

3800
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:36,120
It's gonna launch!

3801
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:38,540
There's no use.

3802
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:39,680
There's nothing we can do from here.

3803
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:41,600
Meow.

3804
02:54:43,860 --> 02:54:44,700
Trick time.

3805
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:45,500
Trick time.

3806
02:54:46,060 --> 02:54:46,540
Trick time.

3807
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:46,980
Oh.

3808
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:49,060
There goes the missile.

3809
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:51,820
Now there's really nothing we can do.

3810
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:54,560
If only our missile was here right now.

3811
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:57,420
And Becky tried to take it head on for us.

3812
02:54:58,080 --> 02:54:59,080
Yeah, I bet he would.

3813
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:01,240
Looks like we better rethink this whole thing.

3814
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:04,360
Okay, from the fate change.

3815
02:55:08,780 --> 02:55:10,580
There goes missile but not the dog.

3816
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:16,910
So I think I have to attach myself to...

3817
02:55:18,750 --> 02:55:19,590
The rock.

3818
02:55:20,730 --> 02:55:21,170
Right?

3819
02:55:23,250 --> 02:55:25,050
When it gets...

3820
02:55:26,110 --> 02:55:26,710
Hold on.

3821
02:55:26,810 --> 02:55:27,650
Oh, I can't see.

3822
02:55:27,710 --> 02:55:27,930
Okay.

3823
02:55:27,970 --> 02:55:28,990
I wanted to see if I could...

3824
02:55:29,870 --> 02:55:30,310
Okay.

3825
02:55:31,470 --> 02:55:32,490
Grab the rock!

3826
02:55:33,910 --> 02:55:34,790
Eat it up!

3827
02:55:35,050 --> 02:55:35,490
Okay.

3828
02:55:36,210 --> 02:55:36,650
Now.

3829
02:55:37,170 --> 02:55:37,610
Uh...

3830
02:55:41,360 --> 02:55:42,240
I wonder...

3831
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:43,320
Open!

3832
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:47,300
I wonder if I'm timing this correct...

3833
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:49,240
Correctly.

3834
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:50,040
I don't think I did.

3835
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:51,420
Okay.

3836
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:51,900
Okay.

3837
02:55:51,980 --> 02:55:52,340
One more.

3838
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:52,760
One more.

3839
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:53,420
Okay.

3840
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:53,740
Okay.

3841
02:55:53,780 --> 02:55:54,000
Okay.

3842
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:54,220
Okay.

3843
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:54,440
Okay.

3844
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:55,560
Uh...

3845
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:00,680
You can wait in the light.

3846
02:56:00,820 --> 02:56:01,420
Oh, that's right.

3847
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:02,520
You guys are so smart.

3848
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:02,980
Okay.

3849
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:03,960
Oh!

3850
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:08,080
Wait!

3851
02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:08,520
No!

3852
02:56:10,020 --> 02:56:10,700
Oh, gosh.

3853
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:11,100
Oh, gosh.

3854
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:11,740
I missed...

3855
02:56:11,740 --> 02:56:12,620
My chance!

3856
02:56:16,480 --> 02:56:16,920
Nice!

3857
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:18,940
Never mind.

3858
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:20,520
I didn't miss my chance.

3859
02:56:24,220 --> 02:56:24,660
Wait.

3860
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:25,880
If I'm here...

3861
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:28,100
Oh, I'm in the capsule.

3862
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:28,440
Okay.

3863
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:28,700
Okay.

3864
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:28,940
Alright.

3865
02:56:31,560 --> 02:56:31,960
Poof!

3866
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:33,280
That was so close.

3867
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:34,720
Clutch, man.

3868
02:56:35,020 --> 02:56:35,420
Clutch.

3869
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:53,790
From the capsule?

3870
02:56:53,990 --> 02:56:54,530
What can I do?

3871
02:56:57,190 --> 02:56:57,590
Hmm...

3872
02:57:05,820 --> 02:57:07,640
You caught the after image?

3873
02:57:07,740 --> 02:57:08,460
I'm just that good.

3874
02:57:08,800 --> 02:57:10,400
I'm just that good.

3875
02:57:21,530 --> 02:57:22,810
Do something!

3876
02:57:23,230 --> 02:57:24,190
Is it the lever?

3877
02:57:25,990 --> 02:57:27,410
Perhaps it is.

3878
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:29,190
Lower the lever.

3879
02:57:30,110 --> 02:57:30,990
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3880
02:57:32,110 --> 02:57:34,630
Okay, I'm inside.

3881
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:35,170
Wait.

3882
02:57:35,750 --> 02:57:37,150
That's not letting me do anything else.

3883
02:57:38,690 --> 02:57:39,310
There's no time!

3884
02:57:39,390 --> 02:57:39,950
It's gonna launch!

3885
02:57:40,630 --> 02:57:41,950
We can still find a way to stop it.

3886
02:57:42,350 --> 02:57:42,670
How?

3887
02:57:43,330 --> 02:57:46,330
Even if the torpedo does launch, we just have to stop it from detonating, right?

3888
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:48,030
There's still something we can do.

3889
02:57:48,210 --> 02:57:48,530
Okay.

3890
02:57:49,310 --> 02:57:49,970
I hope!

3891
02:57:51,070 --> 02:57:54,450
Why was the I hope at the end the strongest part of that sentence?

3892
02:57:55,690 --> 02:57:56,330
Here it goes!

3893
02:58:02,710 --> 02:58:04,730
Oh my god, it literally turns around.

3894
02:58:07,050 --> 02:58:08,930
Why is there a mouse in here?

3895
02:58:11,450 --> 02:58:13,350
Why is there a mouse in the torpedo?

3896
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:17,010
How did you get in here?

3897
02:58:18,810 --> 02:58:21,550
I came along for the ride without giving it too much thought.

3898
02:58:23,030 --> 02:58:24,550
Well, was this really the best move?

3899
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:26,010
I think so.

3900
02:58:26,270 --> 02:58:28,310
We just have to keep it from going off, right?

3901
02:58:29,130 --> 02:58:29,850
Okay, mouse.

3902
02:58:30,750 --> 02:58:32,910
I'm sure this poor little rat will thank us too.

3903
02:58:33,010 --> 02:58:34,090
Sorry, I kept saying mouse.

3904
02:58:34,310 --> 02:58:35,230
You're a rat!

3905
02:58:37,090 --> 02:58:38,810
How in the world did it get in there?

3906
02:58:40,250 --> 02:58:40,690
Okay.

3907
02:58:42,190 --> 02:58:43,770
This game hates rats.

3908
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:46,430
This game is... Oh!

3909
02:58:46,490 --> 02:58:49,550
I think these outside parts are supposed to be weights of some sort.

3910
02:58:50,410 --> 02:58:51,550
Spinning black things, right?

3911
02:58:52,310 --> 02:58:55,170
Apparently their spinning helps the torpedo maintain its balance.

3912
02:58:55,650 --> 02:58:56,870
They must be pretty heavy.

3913
02:58:57,390 --> 02:59:00,010
I wonder if we can use these weights to our advantage somehow.

3914
02:59:02,270 --> 02:59:02,870
Stop!

3915
02:59:06,250 --> 02:59:06,850
Operate.

3916
02:59:08,310 --> 02:59:08,910
Operate.

3917
02:59:08,910 --> 02:59:09,230
Okay.

3918
02:59:11,950 --> 02:59:13,910
Let's examine the detonator.

3919
02:59:14,410 --> 02:59:16,250
This is probably the detonator.

3920
02:59:16,550 --> 02:59:17,250
Don't press it!

3921
02:59:17,270 --> 02:59:18,230
The torpedo will explode!

3922
02:59:19,330 --> 02:59:19,970
Uh-oh.

3923
02:59:20,010 --> 02:59:20,690
Better be careful.

3924
02:59:21,670 --> 02:59:25,090
But you know, there should be a safety device around here somewhere.

3925
02:59:25,990 --> 02:59:27,170
Safety device, huh?

3926
02:59:27,330 --> 02:59:28,250
That sounds promising.

3927
02:59:28,250 --> 02:59:32,310
We have to put the safety on before this thing blows up.

3928
02:59:34,070 --> 02:59:37,330
Wait, what's the dialogue here?

3929
02:59:37,970 --> 02:59:38,630
Press it!

3930
02:59:39,750 --> 02:59:41,290
Do you know how a torpedo works?

3931
02:59:41,970 --> 02:59:43,170
No, I can't say I do.

3932
02:59:43,410 --> 02:59:44,790
Wow, detectives sure know a lot.

3933
02:59:45,210 --> 02:59:46,830
I saw it explained once in a book.

3934
02:59:48,650 --> 02:59:50,490
On impact, the fuse in the...

3935
02:59:50,490 --> 02:59:52,010
Okay, someone tell me if this is accurate.

3936
02:59:52,170 --> 02:59:52,810
I'm so curious.

3937
02:59:53,470 --> 02:59:55,710
On impact, the fuse in the tip is depressed.

3938
02:59:56,370 --> 02:59:57,450
Uh-huh.

3939
02:59:59,690 --> 03:00:02,090
That, in turn, sets off the detonator.

3940
03:00:03,170 --> 03:00:03,710
Woah!

3941
03:00:04,370 --> 03:00:05,510
The detonator, huh?

3942
03:00:05,730 --> 03:00:07,130
That must be the red button.

3943
03:00:07,430 --> 03:00:08,410
Kinda not a...

3944
03:00:08,410 --> 03:00:11,570
Wait, so there's like a tiny little red button inside a torpedo?

3945
03:00:14,270 --> 03:00:14,810
Oh...

3946
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:16,950
That sounds so silly, though.

3947
03:00:18,470 --> 03:00:19,270
There is?

3948
03:00:19,410 --> 03:00:19,850
For real?

3949
03:00:21,650 --> 03:00:23,130
Probably won't be a button.

3950
03:00:23,130 --> 03:00:23,670
Hahaha.

3951
03:00:29,800 --> 03:00:31,560
IRL torpedoes have rats in them, too.

3952
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:32,200
Wow!

3953
03:00:38,300 --> 03:00:39,760
More of like an igniter.

3954
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:40,960
Okay, that makes more sense.

3955
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:45,640
So how do we stop it?

3956
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:48,700
It didn't explain anything about that in the book.

3957
03:00:49,260 --> 03:00:51,020
Wow, detectives sure know a lot.

3958
03:00:51,460 --> 03:00:52,460
Or not.

3959
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:54,940
Okay, uh...

3960
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:58,300
Let's operate the joint.

3961
03:00:59,500 --> 03:00:59,940
Oh!

3962
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:01,260
Oh my...

3963
03:01:02,820 --> 03:01:04,560
This looks like...

3964
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:05,820
Just a thing.

3965
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:07,140
If we clamp down...

3966
03:01:07,140 --> 03:01:09,800
Clamp this thing on the fuse, it should keep it from moving.

3967
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:11,960
So what does that mean exactly?

3968
03:01:12,380 --> 03:01:15,260
It means we might be able to stop the torpedo from exploding with this.

3969
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:17,860
I have to admit, I don't understand all the details.

3970
03:01:18,220 --> 03:01:19,620
But I do want to give it a try.

3971
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:21,660
Before we can do that...

3972
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:22,940
Looks like we have to get...

3973
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:24,520
Something out of the way first, huh?

3974
03:01:25,740 --> 03:01:27,240
Um, little rat...

3975
03:01:27,820 --> 03:01:28,840
Little rat... Okay.

3976
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:33,420
I think if we stop it in a certain way, it will fling the rat.

3977
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:34,100
He'll be like...

3978
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:34,580
Either like...

3979
03:01:34,580 --> 03:01:34,760
Woo!

3980
03:01:35,060 --> 03:01:35,980
Or he'll be like...

3981
03:01:35,980 --> 03:01:36,340
Woo!

3982
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:37,500
You know?

3983
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:40,420
Let's try stopping this one.

3984
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:42,640
Oh god!

3985
03:01:43,060 --> 03:01:43,760
Oh god!

3986
03:01:44,300 --> 03:01:45,100
Oh god!

3987
03:01:45,180 --> 03:01:45,560
Oh god!

3988
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:45,740
Oh god!

3989
03:01:45,740 --> 03:01:45,900
Oh god!

3990
03:01:45,900 --> 03:01:46,620
Maybe I was wrong.

3991
03:01:50,640 --> 03:01:51,040
Uh...

3992
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:52,180
What?

3993
03:01:54,380 --> 03:01:55,820
How do I get you out of here?

3994
03:02:01,750 --> 03:02:02,150
Stop!

3995
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:02,250
Nope!

3996
03:02:03,990 --> 03:02:05,430
When I stop one...

3997
03:02:05,430 --> 03:02:05,950
Wait.

3998
03:02:06,170 --> 03:02:06,430
Huh?

3999
03:02:07,310 --> 03:02:09,270
When I stop one, the other one starts.

4000
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:12,310
Oh!

4001
03:02:12,350 --> 03:02:12,870
Wait a second.

4002
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:18,310
Oh, I had to time it.

4003
03:02:18,610 --> 03:02:19,390
Oh, there we go.

4004
03:02:19,530 --> 03:02:20,010
Oh my god.

4005
03:02:20,110 --> 03:02:20,350
Wait.

4006
03:02:21,370 --> 03:02:23,050
We've dumped the little creature off.

4007
03:02:23,770 --> 03:02:24,210
Okay.

4008
03:02:25,390 --> 03:02:28,070
Those weights were heavy enough to turn the whole torpedo over.

4009
03:02:28,230 --> 03:02:28,650
Nice!

4010
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:30,250
I...

4011
03:02:30,250 --> 03:02:32,810
I knew that was gonna happen.

4012
03:02:34,990 --> 03:02:36,250
Now for that safety device.

4013
03:02:36,770 --> 03:02:37,410
Right!

4014
03:02:38,030 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh my god.

4015
03:02:41,070 --> 03:02:41,710
Operate!

4016
03:02:44,450 --> 03:02:46,830
There, we clamped the safety device on.

4017
03:02:48,570 --> 03:02:50,530
I totally knew that was gonna happen.

4018
03:02:51,230 --> 03:02:53,350
That should keep this torpedo from exploding.

4019
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:55,210
But there's just one problem.

4020
03:02:55,770 --> 03:02:56,410
Problem?

4021
03:02:56,650 --> 03:02:57,210
What's that?

4022
03:02:57,950 --> 03:02:59,630
The torpedo is still going to impact.

4023
03:03:00,030 --> 03:03:01,430
We can't do anything about that.

4024
03:03:01,890 --> 03:03:02,650
Uh oh.

4025
03:03:03,510 --> 03:03:04,070
Oh!

4026
03:03:06,830 --> 03:03:08,390
As expected of a genius, Minto.

4027
03:03:09,450 --> 03:03:10,150
Thank you.

4028
03:03:13,370 --> 03:03:14,530
Oh, but it didn't...

4029
03:03:14,530 --> 03:03:17,490
The explosion didn't happen so all the stuff didn't come...

4030
03:03:18,130 --> 03:03:21,690
It didn't, like, come toppling down the ceiling and stuff.

4031
03:03:23,490 --> 03:03:25,750
It looks like the torpedo still hit the sub.

4032
03:03:26,630 --> 03:03:27,190
Oh, I got it.

4033
03:03:27,190 --> 03:03:28,630
But it looks like the submarine is still...

4034
03:03:28,630 --> 03:03:28,870
Okay!

4035
03:03:29,970 --> 03:03:32,890
This changes everybody's fate, including the little rat.

4036
03:03:34,050 --> 03:03:35,210
Cecil, we did it!

4037
03:03:36,830 --> 03:03:37,790
Fate averted.

4038
03:03:40,970 --> 03:03:41,810
What's the matter?

4039
03:03:41,910 --> 03:03:42,650
You still look unhappy.

4040
03:03:43,870 --> 03:03:45,330
Crash is better than an explosion.

4041
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:45,850
Exactly.

4042
03:03:46,190 --> 03:03:48,050
We stopped the torpedo from blowing up.

4043
03:03:49,170 --> 03:03:51,630
But we still opened up a gaping hole in the submarine.

4044
03:03:52,950 --> 03:03:53,650
You're right.

4045
03:03:53,890 --> 03:03:54,990
I guess...

4046
03:03:55,770 --> 03:03:58,110
I guess that's just what missiles do.

4047
03:03:58,310 --> 03:03:59,390
They're unstoppable!

4048
03:04:01,090 --> 03:04:02,150
Am I hearing things?

4049
03:04:02,910 --> 03:04:03,430
Anyway.

4050
03:04:03,850 --> 03:04:07,030
I guess we better get back to the present as quickly as we can.

4051
03:04:08,370 --> 03:04:08,890
Right.

4052
03:04:08,950 --> 03:04:09,930
I'm worried about Camilla.

4053
03:04:10,550 --> 03:04:12,710
I think our best boy is talking.

4054
03:04:15,550 --> 03:04:17,710
I think our best boy is hanging about.

4055
03:04:19,930 --> 03:04:21,830
We managed to stop death for now.

4056
03:04:22,030 --> 03:04:23,370
But it hasn't disappeared altogether.

4057
03:04:23,830 --> 03:04:24,950
It's now slowly...

4058
03:04:24,990 --> 03:04:25,450
but surely...

4059
03:04:25,450 --> 03:04:26,150
filling the room.

4060
03:04:26,610 --> 03:04:27,010
Ooh!

4061
03:04:27,290 --> 03:04:27,690
Titanic!

4062
03:04:27,970 --> 03:04:28,150
Scary!

4063
03:04:29,790 --> 03:04:30,330
Uh-oh.

4064
03:04:31,130 --> 03:04:33,550
Water is seeping in through the hole where the torpedo hit.

4065
03:04:35,470 --> 03:04:36,710
I have to step out.

4066
03:04:37,170 --> 03:04:39,070
Here's an early congrats on reaching the end, Mint.

4067
03:04:39,130 --> 03:04:40,010
It was so fun to watch.

4068
03:04:40,690 --> 03:04:41,090
Poopy!

4069
03:04:41,430 --> 03:04:42,150
Thank you!

4070
03:04:43,110 --> 03:04:44,090
Thank you so much.

4071
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:49,530
We've got to get them out of here.

4072
03:04:49,750 --> 03:04:50,990
I'd better go meet up with Lynn.

4073
03:04:52,810 --> 03:04:53,610
Trick time.

4074
03:04:55,550 --> 03:04:57,570
I like this soundtrack too.

4075
03:04:57,690 --> 03:04:58,150
It's so cool.

4076
03:04:59,650 --> 03:05:00,170
Uh...

4077
03:05:01,730 --> 03:05:02,250
Wheel.

4078
03:05:03,410 --> 03:05:03,930
Wheel.

4079
03:05:04,070 --> 03:05:04,190
Oh.

4080
03:05:04,270 --> 03:05:04,910
What's this one do?

4081
03:05:05,010 --> 03:05:05,430
Wheel.

4082
03:05:06,610 --> 03:05:07,130
Starter.

4083
03:05:08,470 --> 03:05:08,990
Transformer.

4084
03:05:09,170 --> 03:05:10,010
Medium fan.

4085
03:05:10,510 --> 03:05:12,410
Let's, I guess, start whatever we're starting.

4086
03:05:14,470 --> 03:05:14,990
Oh!

4087
03:05:17,070 --> 03:05:20,450
The lights went out but this machine apparently still works.

4088
03:05:22,510 --> 03:05:24,470
The ride only gets crazier from here?

4089
03:05:24,610 --> 03:05:24,970
Oh!

4090
03:05:25,570 --> 03:05:27,510
Unfortunately, I guess it won't run for very long.

4091
03:05:27,650 --> 03:05:28,710
How much crazier can it get?

4092
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:32,070
Maybe I can use its movements to help me create a path.

4093
03:05:37,370 --> 03:05:38,650
I'd better hurry over to Lynn.

4094
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:39,930
It's not safe to stay here.

4095
03:05:40,210 --> 03:05:43,510
I just don't have the power to stop that water from coming in.

4096
03:05:45,050 --> 03:05:45,450
Wait.

4097
03:05:45,550 --> 03:05:46,590
What did I change?

4098
03:05:48,510 --> 03:05:49,830
I didn't really change anything.

4099
03:05:53,350 --> 03:05:54,670
I don't think at least.

4100
03:05:54,870 --> 03:05:55,070
Oh!

4101
03:05:55,770 --> 03:05:56,950
That thing right there.

4102
03:05:57,550 --> 03:05:57,950
Oh!

4103
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:01,020
Let's.

4104
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:01,280
Oh!

4105
03:06:01,380 --> 03:06:01,680
Uh.

4106
03:06:02,780 --> 03:06:03,260
Okay.

4107
03:06:03,320 --> 03:06:04,500
Can't do anything with the fans.

4108
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:07,240
But I can.

4109
03:06:09,480 --> 03:06:10,240
Do this.

4110
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:11,400
Oh.

4111
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:12,600
A little bit.

4112
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:13,800
There we go.

4113
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:14,540
Oh my goodness.

4114
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:17,240
There we go.

4115
03:06:17,400 --> 03:06:17,780
Okay.

4116
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:23,480
Wait.

4117
03:06:25,680 --> 03:06:27,140
What can I do with this piston?

4118
03:06:28,220 --> 03:06:28,720
Uh-oh.

4119
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:29,680
Oh!

4120
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:30,700
Oh!

4121
03:06:31,120 --> 03:06:31,560
Oh!

4122
03:06:31,580 --> 03:06:32,060
It lifted up.

4123
03:06:32,140 --> 03:06:32,600
Oh, phew.

4124
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:33,700
I thought I was trapped for a second.

4125
03:06:33,720 --> 03:06:34,080
For real.

4126
03:06:34,340 --> 03:06:35,080
Oh my gosh.

4127
03:06:37,420 --> 03:06:38,120
She cooking.

4128
03:06:41,860 --> 03:06:42,300
Camilla.

4129
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:43,360
Lynn!

4130
03:06:44,460 --> 03:06:45,300
Camilla, you're awake.

4131
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:46,140
How do you feel?

4132
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:47,680
I'm so sorry.

4133
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:49,840
I'm sorry I pointed that gun at you.

4134
03:06:50,780 --> 03:06:51,220
Wait.

4135
03:06:51,260 --> 03:06:52,260
So she remembers it.

4136
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:56,480
Camilla's been the manipulator this whole time.

4137
03:06:58,680 --> 03:06:59,120
Hmm?

4138
03:06:59,380 --> 03:06:59,680
I'm sorry.

4139
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:01,920
Well, how do you remember that, huh, Camilla?

4140
03:07:02,380 --> 03:07:02,540
Hmm?

4141
03:07:03,940 --> 03:07:05,020
Don't worry about that.

4142
03:07:05,140 --> 03:07:06,100
That wasn't you.

4143
03:07:08,180 --> 03:07:09,140
Miss Camilla!

4144
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:11,520
Oh, Missle, you're here.

4145
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:13,620
Oh, poor Miss Camilla.

4146
03:07:13,780 --> 03:07:15,200
Miss Lynn, what should we do?

4147
03:07:17,200 --> 03:07:19,820
We have to get out of here before any more water comes in.

4148
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:23,660
Cecil should be along any second.

4149
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:25,980
I knew Cici would come.

4150
03:07:26,380 --> 03:07:28,140
And Missy is here too.

4151
03:07:28,420 --> 03:07:28,900
I'm sorry.

4152
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:29,680
I'm sorry.

4153
03:07:31,340 --> 03:07:33,680
I'm so happy everybody's going to be with me now.

4154
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:36,640
Oh, dies.

4155
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:42,960
Uh-oh.

4156
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:45,260
God, I love that dog.

4157
03:07:45,480 --> 03:07:45,920
Me too.

4158
03:07:46,120 --> 03:07:47,160
I'll get you out of here.

4159
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:51,040
If it's the last thing I do...

4160
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:53,000
Don't say that, Lynn, because it might very well be...

4161
03:07:53,420 --> 03:07:54,800
I think I'm going to cry.

4162
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:57,980
Or whimper, as the case may be.

4163
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,880
I better send a signal to Lynn that I'm here before it's too late.

4164
03:08:02,480 --> 03:08:02,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

4165
03:08:07,320 --> 03:08:07,800
It's me.

4166
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:09,180
Look at that flashlight.

4167
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:10,680
It's Cecil.

4168
03:08:10,700 --> 03:08:11,080
He's here.

4169
03:08:13,060 --> 03:08:14,500
That was a quick death flag.

4170
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:15,400
Yeah, it was.

4171
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:20,340
What if there's like a...

4172
03:08:20,340 --> 03:08:21,440
Can you imagine?

4173
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:22,420
What if there's like a thing?

4174
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:25,720
A puzzle that we can't solve at some point?

4175
03:08:25,880 --> 03:08:26,880
That scares me.

4176
03:08:26,920 --> 03:08:30,960
What if, like, Lynn dies and we try to solve the puzzle and she's like, there's no helping it.

4177
03:08:31,340 --> 03:08:32,760
It just has to be this way.

4178
03:08:32,800 --> 03:08:32,880
I don't know.

4179
03:08:33,540 --> 03:08:33,940
I'm sorry.

4180
03:08:33,940 --> 03:08:35,300
No, I don't want that to happen.

4181
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:38,420
I'm glad you're here, Cecil.

4182
03:08:39,060 --> 03:08:39,960
Sorry for the wait.

4183
03:08:40,360 --> 03:08:42,640
It looks like this room is going to fill up with water fast.

4184
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:48,220
We'd better get out that door as quick as we can.

4185
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:51,160
We won't be getting out that door, I'm afraid.

4186
03:08:51,380 --> 03:08:53,120
The water pressure is too great already.

4187
03:08:53,220 --> 03:08:54,060
I can't open it.

4188
03:08:56,120 --> 03:08:56,520
What?

4189
03:08:57,060 --> 03:08:58,400
What does water pressure mean?

4190
03:09:03,140 --> 03:09:05,180
Think of it as the force of the water holding you back.

4191
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:08,500
Cecil is so dumb.

4192
03:09:08,740 --> 03:09:09,460
I love this guy.

4193
03:09:10,300 --> 03:09:13,120
The water level keeps getting higher and higher in here.

4194
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:16,380
So the only way out of here is up, huh?

4195
03:09:17,380 --> 03:09:17,780
Exactly.

4196
03:09:19,060 --> 03:09:19,460
Okay.

4197
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:19,860
Got it.

4198
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:21,360
Let's look for a path that goes up.

4199
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:23,140
Which I see one already.

4200
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:24,160
Right there.

4201
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:25,160
Oh, you missed it.

4202
03:09:25,240 --> 03:09:25,920
Oh, right there.

4203
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:29,520
Look at that ladder.

4204
03:09:29,620 --> 03:09:32,480
I wonder if we can get it down somehow.

4205
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:34,000
Good idea.

4206
03:09:34,220 --> 03:09:35,000
Let's try it.

4207
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:35,160
Let's try it.

4208
03:09:35,160 --> 03:09:36,620
What is water?

4209
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:37,600
What is water?

4210
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:39,400
Oh, and by the way...

4211
03:09:41,800 --> 03:09:43,260
I can't swim!

4212
03:09:44,080 --> 03:09:45,280
Neither can Camilla?

4213
03:09:47,820 --> 03:09:48,780
Oh my god.

4214
03:09:49,320 --> 03:09:51,240
Don't you have any good news for me?

4215
03:09:52,580 --> 03:09:53,820
Let me think about it.

4216
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:55,680
In the meantime, could you hurry, please?

4217
03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:57,160
Okay.

4218
03:09:58,940 --> 03:09:59,980
I'm assuming...

4219
03:09:59,980 --> 03:10:01,880
I'm assuming...

4220
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:04,720
I'm assuming this is time then.

4221
03:10:04,720 --> 03:10:05,080
Oh.

4222
03:10:06,480 --> 03:10:07,740
What does this do?

4223
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:08,280
Oh.

4224
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:09,580
Uh...

4225
03:10:10,260 --> 03:10:10,860
Handle...

4226
03:10:10,860 --> 03:10:11,560
Turn the handle!

4227
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:15,160
Oh.

4228
03:10:15,300 --> 03:10:15,900
Oh!

4229
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:19,640
Okay.

4230
03:10:21,920 --> 03:10:22,520
Uh...

4231
03:10:23,340 --> 03:10:23,940
Let's see.

4232
03:10:25,180 --> 03:10:26,140
Switch lower.

4233
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:29,560
Nice!

4234
03:10:31,840 --> 03:10:33,160
You did it, Sissel!

4235
03:10:33,180 --> 03:10:33,600
Thanks!

4236
03:10:34,480 --> 03:10:35,680
Big Talabar!

4237
03:10:35,740 --> 03:10:36,720
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

4238
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:37,320
Thank you!

4239
03:10:37,340 --> 03:10:37,980
Thank you so much!

4240
03:10:39,160 --> 03:10:40,880
Where is Raiden when you need him?

4241
03:10:41,100 --> 03:10:41,620
I know, right?

4242
03:10:41,900 --> 03:10:43,580
Listen to the sound of my heartbeat.

4243
03:10:44,740 --> 03:10:45,880
Or lack thereof.

4244
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:48,200
Okay.

4245
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:48,700
We're here.

4246
03:10:49,340 --> 03:10:49,780
Nice.

4247
03:10:57,640 --> 03:10:58,660
What was that?

4248
03:10:59,580 --> 03:11:02,480
It looks like water seeping in isn't the only thing we have to worry about.

4249
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:06,080
And I hope you can manage to avoid drowning for two cute girls.

4250
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:07,460
Leave it to me!

4251
03:11:10,840 --> 03:11:11,540
Uh-oh.

4252
03:11:12,160 --> 03:11:12,640
No!

4253
03:11:12,840 --> 03:11:13,560
Our flashlight!

4254
03:11:14,180 --> 03:11:15,820
The flashlight doesn't work anymore!

4255
03:11:16,760 --> 03:11:17,900
Hey, don't get mad at me.

4256
03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:21,160
Maybe the contacts are bad or something.

4257
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:22,840
Hey, I know.

4258
03:11:22,880 --> 03:11:24,000
You can fix it with your powers.

4259
03:11:24,460 --> 03:11:24,680
I...

4260
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:26,940
Now that's just taking things too far.

4261
03:11:30,140 --> 03:11:30,620
Okay.

4262
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:32,780
Uh...

4263
03:11:32,780 --> 03:11:34,240
Wait, can I actually turn it on?

4264
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:35,020
Yeah.

4265
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:36,060
You can.

4266
03:11:36,060 --> 03:11:36,380
Oh!

4267
03:11:36,540 --> 03:11:37,340
It actually worked!

4268
03:11:39,740 --> 03:11:40,660
Did you use...

4269
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:43,600
Did you used to be an electrician in your past life or something?

4270
03:11:44,600 --> 03:11:46,880
That's a cruel question, considering the circumstances.

4271
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:49,400
Now all we have to do is...

4272
03:11:50,680 --> 03:11:52,380
Get to that door and we're safe.

4273
03:11:52,740 --> 03:11:53,220
Oh!

4274
03:11:56,600 --> 03:11:57,800
Oh my God!

4275
03:11:57,900 --> 03:11:58,360
Oh my God!

4276
03:11:58,380 --> 03:11:58,660
Oh my God!

4277
03:11:58,680 --> 03:11:58,960
Oh my God!

4278
03:11:58,960 --> 03:11:59,260
Oh my God!

4279
03:11:59,280 --> 03:11:59,440
Oh my God!

4280
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:02,160
Oh!

4281
03:12:02,260 --> 03:12:02,740
Oh!

4282
03:12:03,120 --> 03:12:03,560
Oh!

4283
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:04,180
Oh!

4284
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:04,680
Oh!

4285
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:05,640
It's actually the Titanic!

4286
03:12:10,780 --> 03:12:11,820
Oh my God!

4287
03:12:16,240 --> 03:12:16,760
Uh...

4288
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:19,160
Listen to the sound of the...

4289
03:12:19,160 --> 03:12:21,580
Of the no posters on my wall.

4290
03:12:21,700 --> 03:12:22,220
What does that mean?

4291
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:28,780
What happened now?

4292
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:32,860
Looks like the submarine decided to rear up on its hind legs!

4293
03:12:34,480 --> 03:12:36,880
I can't believe we're still okay after that fall.

4294
03:12:37,240 --> 03:12:38,120
Oh, I mean...

4295
03:12:38,120 --> 03:12:39,600
Speak for yourself, but come on.

4296
03:12:39,620 --> 03:12:40,440
I mean, there's Camilla right there.

4297
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:41,420
She looks like...

4298
03:12:41,420 --> 03:12:43,020
She doesn't look like she's doing so well.

4299
03:12:44,060 --> 03:12:47,220
Either we're really lucky or we're dead and we just haven't realized it yet.

4300
03:12:47,780 --> 03:12:49,960
Come on now, as if the latter could be true.

4301
03:12:52,140 --> 03:12:52,660
Uh...

4302
03:12:52,660 --> 03:12:53,400
Camilla!

4303
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:57,260
Oh no way.

4304
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:00,840
What now?

4305
03:13:01,420 --> 03:13:03,280
The water sure is rising fast.

4306
03:13:04,620 --> 03:13:07,460
Something's rising and it isn't the shield hero.

4307
03:13:08,380 --> 03:13:09,160
Come on!

4308
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:09,600
Okay.

4309
03:13:10,420 --> 03:13:11,040
Oh my god.

4310
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:12,260
You'll just have to go up!

4311
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:13,100
Up to the top!

4312
03:13:14,620 --> 03:13:16,240
Let's see how I can help with my ghost tricks.

4313
03:13:20,020 --> 03:13:21,700
What are we gonna do with her?

4314
03:13:22,500 --> 03:13:24,320
I think I see a familiar flame over there.

4315
03:13:26,140 --> 03:13:26,540
Misa!

4316
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:28,160
Cecil, there you are!

4317
03:13:28,940 --> 03:13:29,620
How's it going?

4318
03:13:31,620 --> 03:13:32,420
How's it going?

4319
03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:34,120
I'd say it was going pretty badly.

4320
03:13:36,140 --> 03:13:37,660
Someday it'll be the shield hero.

4321
03:13:39,620 --> 03:13:41,760
You guys, what's rising is the water!

4322
03:13:42,400 --> 03:13:44,400
It's the water that's rising!

4323
03:13:44,880 --> 03:13:46,240
What else would I mean?

4324
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:48,460
It's the water!

4325
03:13:49,420 --> 03:13:52,940
You do understand how dangerous the situation is, don't you?

4326
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:55,980
Oh, the water!

4327
03:13:56,900 --> 03:13:57,760
Of course!

4328
03:13:57,900 --> 03:14:03,060
After all, just ask anybody who knows me about how much I hate taking a bath.

4329
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:05,840
Usually dogs like baths, though.

4330
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:13,430
Have you guys ever...

4331
03:14:13,970 --> 03:14:15,350
Have you guys ever met a dog that doesn't like a bath?

4332
03:14:17,010 --> 03:14:19,610
Maybe he's been in danger of drowning before himself.

4333
03:14:20,470 --> 03:14:20,950
Okay.

4334
03:14:21,270 --> 03:14:23,170
Ready to create a path for these ladies?

4335
03:14:23,830 --> 03:14:24,730
Of course!

4336
03:14:26,430 --> 03:14:26,910
Alright.

4337
03:14:27,430 --> 03:14:28,170
Trick time.

4338
03:14:30,050 --> 03:14:30,710
Let's see.

4339
03:14:32,170 --> 03:14:32,790
Oh, no.

4340
03:14:33,150 --> 03:14:33,630
Uh...

4341
03:14:36,090 --> 03:14:37,990
No, uh, I guess swap, sure.

4342
03:14:38,330 --> 03:14:38,810
Oh wait.

4343
03:14:39,290 --> 03:14:39,770
Uh...

4344
03:14:40,410 --> 03:14:41,030
Let's see.

4345
03:14:41,170 --> 03:14:43,090
Where can we... where can we go to?

4346
03:14:44,010 --> 03:14:45,350
What can we... oh my goodness.

4347
03:14:45,790 --> 03:14:47,850
Wow, there's a lot of stuff here!

4348
03:14:48,370 --> 03:14:49,270
Oh my gosh.

4349
03:14:50,110 --> 03:14:51,890
Wait, there's so much stuff here!

4350
03:14:52,650 --> 03:14:55,070
Oh, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with this one.

4351
03:14:56,490 --> 03:14:57,330
Oh my god.

4352
03:14:57,730 --> 03:14:59,650
And we have to get all the way to the top, right?

4353
03:15:00,770 --> 03:15:01,250
Here!

4354
03:15:02,790 --> 03:15:03,270
Okay.

4355
03:15:04,110 --> 03:15:04,590
Uh...

4356
03:15:06,530 --> 03:15:08,450
Remember that the water is rising.

4357
03:15:08,570 --> 03:15:09,210
Yes, yes.

4358
03:15:09,530 --> 03:15:10,650
But they can't swim.

4359
03:15:30,150 --> 03:15:30,770
Okay.

4360
03:15:32,220 --> 03:15:33,410
And what can we do?

4361
03:15:34,970 --> 03:15:35,590
Nothing.

4362
03:15:35,990 --> 03:15:37,930
Maybe we have to switch it with a bigger wheel.

4363
03:15:40,350 --> 03:15:43,210
Actually, I don't... I don't think... I don't think that's possible.

4364
03:15:48,270 --> 03:15:50,310
Why don't we switch first?

4365
03:15:51,030 --> 03:15:52,850
My brain is already hurting.

4366
03:15:58,980 --> 03:16:00,580
These are the same shape!

4367
03:16:00,820 --> 03:16:01,920
What do you mean they can't?

4368
03:16:04,120 --> 03:16:05,340
What if I swap these?

4369
03:16:05,680 --> 03:16:06,660
Does it do anything?

4370
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:09,380
I don't think so.

4371
03:16:11,480 --> 03:16:13,920
I'm just... I'm just switching things to switch them.

4372
03:16:14,880 --> 03:16:17,860
I can't believe it's been almost two months since your return.

4373
03:16:18,080 --> 03:16:22,260
My brain rotting mind imagined you coming out of a foggy haunted forest.

4374
03:16:23,660 --> 03:16:27,620
Stanced up like Heihachi when he came out of the red smoke in Tekken 7.

4375
03:16:29,860 --> 03:16:31,680
That's a pretty epic entrance, I'd say.

4376
03:16:31,860 --> 03:16:32,400
Thank you.

4377
03:16:40,090 --> 03:16:42,150
I need to let time move to see some changes?

4378
03:16:42,290 --> 03:16:42,450
Okay.

4379
03:16:54,540 --> 03:16:55,760
The water is rising.

4380
03:16:58,420 --> 03:16:59,700
Oh my god, that's...

4381
03:17:03,850 --> 03:17:06,630
I have to find a way for Lin to get up to the top.

4382
03:17:06,630 --> 03:17:09,850
A woman who can't swim and an ambitious woman.

4383
03:17:10,130 --> 03:17:11,630
They both head for the top.

4384
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:13,550
I hate their job.

4385
03:17:13,630 --> 03:17:14,830
Thanks for joining membership.

4386
03:17:16,250 --> 03:17:19,270
To do that, I need to create some kind of foothold for her.

4387
03:17:19,610 --> 03:17:21,630
A woman who can't swim and a sensible woman.

4388
03:17:21,750 --> 03:17:23,370
They both keep their feet on the ground.

4389
03:17:26,670 --> 03:17:27,110
Okay.

4390
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:29,350
Well, so much for waiting for...

4391
03:17:30,610 --> 03:17:31,910
So much for waiting.

4392
03:17:33,150 --> 03:17:33,590
Okay.

4393
03:17:36,630 --> 03:17:37,830
I'm going ghost.

4394
03:17:38,930 --> 03:17:39,490
What?

4395
03:17:43,880 --> 03:17:46,280
I don't even know what to switch at all.

4396
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:02,360
Don't forget Cecil.

4397
03:18:02,940 --> 03:18:05,200
Yeah, but he can't go anywhere right now.

4398
03:18:06,740 --> 03:18:07,760
Oh wait, yes again!

4399
03:18:08,160 --> 03:18:08,980
What the hell?

4400
03:18:09,440 --> 03:18:10,340
Am I stupid?

4401
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:15,420
Am I dumb?

4402
03:18:16,740 --> 03:18:17,740
Don't answer that.

4403
03:18:26,120 --> 03:18:29,420
So, she was looking at the wheel with the flashlight, wasn't she?

4404
03:18:30,400 --> 03:18:33,120
I feel like I need to put like...

4405
03:18:34,840 --> 03:18:36,060
Let me talk for hints.

4406
03:18:36,480 --> 03:18:38,780
Go up is easier said than done when I'm holding Camila.

4407
03:18:39,820 --> 03:18:40,340
I know.

4408
03:18:40,400 --> 03:18:42,000
We're going to try to create a path for you somehow.

4409
03:18:43,640 --> 03:18:45,000
The water just keeps on rising.

4410
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:45,640
Please hurry.

4411
03:18:46,240 --> 03:18:47,900
Oh, and, by the way, did I ever tell you...

4412
03:18:47,900 --> 03:18:49,120
You can't swim.

4413
03:18:49,300 --> 03:18:50,180
Neither can Camila.

4414
03:18:50,760 --> 03:18:51,120
Oops.

4415
03:18:51,280 --> 03:18:52,480
I already said that, didn't I?

4416
03:18:53,060 --> 03:18:53,420
Okay.

4417
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:53,980
Well, I made up my mind.

4418
03:18:53,980 --> 03:18:54,340
Good luck!

4419
03:18:57,340 --> 03:18:57,780
Okay...

4420
03:19:02,120 --> 03:19:03,440
Oh, my brain...

4421
03:19:03,440 --> 03:19:04,180
Wait, operate!

4422
03:19:10,320 --> 03:19:10,760
Okay...

4423
03:19:12,260 --> 03:19:12,700
Oh!

4424
03:19:15,500 --> 03:19:17,700
These pistons sticking out right in front of me!

4425
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:19,320
It's almost like they're taunting me!

4426
03:19:20,060 --> 03:19:21,140
Maybe it's a challenge!

4427
03:19:22,480 --> 03:19:23,720
It might be just that.

4428
03:19:23,940 --> 03:19:24,760
Think you can climb them?

4429
03:19:25,980 --> 03:19:26,420
Hmm...

4430
03:19:26,420 --> 03:19:28,800
If I wasn't holding Camilla, I could probably do it easily.

4431
03:19:30,300 --> 03:19:30,740
Sizzle!

4432
03:19:31,400 --> 03:19:35,440
You're not telling Ms. Lin to leave poor Ms. Camilla behind, are you?

4433
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:38,480
Could you be quiet for a minute?

4434
03:19:39,340 --> 03:19:40,860
Sizzle, shut the hell up.

4435
03:19:41,860 --> 03:19:45,140
These pistons sure do look like they could be used to our advantage.

4436
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:55,040
These pistons...

4437
03:19:56,580 --> 03:19:58,600
They're silently pressuring me to climb them.

4438
03:19:59,240 --> 03:20:00,900
I doubt they're doing that, Ms. Lin.

4439
03:20:02,760 --> 03:20:03,480
It looks like...

4440
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:06,320
It looks like how much the pistons thrust out...

4441
03:20:06,340 --> 03:20:07,840
is related to how large the fan...

4442
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:15,760
My arms are full, but my legs are free!

4443
03:20:16,540 --> 03:20:18,380
If you could just move these pistons...

4444
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:19,740
so they're a little easier to climb...

4445
03:20:19,740 --> 03:20:20,440
I think I could do it.

4446
03:20:22,340 --> 03:20:24,320
We need the three different sizes of fans.

4447
03:20:24,460 --> 03:20:24,640
Okay.

4448
03:20:29,320 --> 03:20:31,220
We had the small one here.

4449
03:20:31,480 --> 03:20:31,700
Oops.

4450
03:20:36,950 --> 03:20:38,810
I think the small one needs to go...

4451
03:20:40,290 --> 03:20:40,730
here.

4452
03:20:41,310 --> 03:20:42,910
But we need the large fan.

4453
03:20:45,710 --> 03:20:46,550
Wait, okay.

4454
03:20:46,630 --> 03:20:48,110
Let's switch the large fan first.

4455
03:20:48,130 --> 03:20:48,750
Down here.

4456
03:20:51,130 --> 03:20:51,910
No, no, no.

4457
03:20:53,770 --> 03:20:54,310
Switch.

4458
03:20:56,070 --> 03:20:56,610
Okay.

4459
03:20:58,070 --> 03:20:58,610
Switch.

4460
03:20:59,670 --> 03:21:00,850
Okay, medium fan.

4461
03:21:01,790 --> 03:21:02,650
Medium fan.

4462
03:21:02,810 --> 03:21:03,270
Fine.

4463
03:21:04,570 --> 03:21:05,110
Okay.

4464
03:21:05,850 --> 03:21:06,950
And then here.

4465
03:21:07,190 --> 03:21:08,090
And small fan.

4466
03:21:08,850 --> 03:21:09,630
There we go.

4467
03:21:11,550 --> 03:21:11,910
Okay.

4468
03:21:13,790 --> 03:21:15,090
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

4469
03:21:15,090 --> 03:21:15,770
ZR, ZR, ZR.

4470
03:21:15,790 --> 03:21:16,150
Operate.

4471
03:21:22,440 --> 03:21:23,080
There we go.

4472
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:24,800
How about that?

4473
03:21:25,720 --> 03:21:26,620
Wow, this is great.

4474
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:28,040
You made a staircase for me.

4475
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:29,660
You better hurry.

4476
03:21:29,720 --> 03:21:31,460
I don't think the water is going to wait for you.

4477
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:33,120
Okay.

4478
03:21:33,180 --> 03:21:33,400
Yep.

4479
03:21:34,480 --> 03:21:35,140
Let's go.

4480
03:21:35,960 --> 03:21:36,540
Let's go.

4481
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:38,320
Let's climb.

4482
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:39,980
Let's go.

4483
03:21:42,200 --> 03:21:42,880
Let's go.

4484
03:21:43,140 --> 03:21:43,680
Let's climb.

4485
03:21:44,020 --> 03:21:44,080
Let's go.

4486
03:21:44,080 --> 03:21:44,640
Thank you.

4487
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:50,420
I think I was trying to see everything all at once.

4488
03:21:50,800 --> 03:21:54,800
But now that I'm seeing that it's done in part, it's not so bad, you know?

4489
03:21:56,180 --> 03:21:56,540
Okay.

4490
03:21:56,600 --> 03:21:58,200
Here she has to avoid the steam.

4491
03:21:58,280 --> 03:21:59,760
Yeah, I knew that was going to hurt her.

4492
03:22:02,320 --> 03:22:03,920
Now this steam is getting out.

4493
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:04,440
Yeah.

4494
03:22:04,540 --> 03:22:04,900
Okay.

4495
03:22:04,960 --> 03:22:11,560
I think for this one, we have to see, we have to switch the ones that are pointed down and the ones that are pointed up, you know?

4496
03:22:11,560 --> 03:22:11,560
I don't know.

4497
03:22:12,260 --> 03:22:13,460
It's too hot to get through.

4498
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:16,760
And there's no way to get around either.

4499
03:22:16,980 --> 03:22:17,680
Think you can do something?

4500
03:22:18,220 --> 03:22:19,360
Of course we can!

4501
03:22:20,440 --> 03:22:21,220
We have to.

4502
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:24,100
Trick time.

4503
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:29,700
Let's get you up there.

4504
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:34,400
Like for example, these two can switch.

4505
03:22:35,220 --> 03:22:36,820
Now if they switch... see?

4506
03:22:36,980 --> 03:22:38,400
Oh, but that one's pointed...

4507
03:22:38,400 --> 03:22:41,540
Ah, that one is flowing both ways.

4508
03:22:42,860 --> 03:22:46,260
If I swap the pipes, it changes how the steam comes out.

4509
03:22:47,320 --> 03:22:49,220
Because the cracks in each pipe are different!

4510
03:22:49,820 --> 03:22:50,260
Yes.

4511
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:53,300
So each pipe sprays out the steam in a different way.

4512
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:55,140
I bet that will come in handy.

4513
03:22:57,660 --> 03:22:58,100
But...

4514
03:23:00,660 --> 03:23:01,440
Two of them...

4515
03:23:03,620 --> 03:23:04,760
Two of them...

4516
03:23:05,240 --> 03:23:06,620
Wait, are there any other ones?

4517
03:23:09,400 --> 03:23:10,960
That they can swap with?

4518
03:23:11,120 --> 03:23:12,100
Doesn't seem like it.

4519
03:23:12,200 --> 03:23:12,800
Wait, down...

4520
03:23:13,700 --> 03:23:14,880
No, that's the balancer.

4521
03:23:28,240 --> 03:23:32,940
Okay, so they have different degrees too.

4522
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:33,400
Oh my gosh.

4523
03:23:33,540 --> 03:23:34,240
Wait, hold on!

4524
03:23:34,340 --> 03:23:35,000
I have to see!

4525
03:23:36,380 --> 03:23:37,620
Oh my gosh...

4526
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:39,880
Here comes the water!

4527
03:23:42,960 --> 03:23:44,820
I wish I could drink it up for you.

4528
03:23:44,820 --> 03:23:46,580
No, Missile, it's too salty!

4529
03:23:47,440 --> 03:23:50,660
I think the more relevant point is that he's dead, so we can't drink it.

4530
03:23:51,520 --> 03:23:52,980
Just do something about the steam.

4531
03:23:53,360 --> 03:23:54,100
Leave it to me!

4532
03:23:54,240 --> 03:23:57,720
Oh, let's try getting Cecil to...

4533
03:23:59,020 --> 03:24:01,220
Maybe the... maybe the... what's it called?

4534
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:02,480
Oh no, wait, I'm stuck.

4535
03:24:02,940 --> 03:24:03,800
Wait, I'm stuck!

4536
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:10,420
If I operate this...

4537
03:24:13,240 --> 03:24:14,400
Can I get back up there?

4538
03:24:14,400 --> 03:24:15,160
Oh my god.

4539
03:24:16,540 --> 03:24:17,300
I'm stuck!

4540
03:24:18,980 --> 03:24:19,700
Oh, there we go.

4541
03:24:19,760 --> 03:24:20,420
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

4542
03:24:22,320 --> 03:24:22,700
Okay.

4543
03:24:24,100 --> 03:24:24,480
Okay.

4544
03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:26,660
Oh my gosh, wait, I'm still stuck.

4545
03:24:29,280 --> 03:24:29,940
There we go.

4546
03:24:30,100 --> 03:24:30,460
Okay.

4547
03:24:30,700 --> 03:24:32,400
I think we can turn this wheel.

4548
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:36,640
And that will adjust how some of the steam works.

4549
03:24:36,760 --> 03:24:37,700
Oh, nice, nice, nice!

4550
03:24:43,360 --> 03:24:44,560
But we need...

4551
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:46,540
Okay.

4552
03:24:46,540 --> 03:24:48,900
We need this one to switch with this one.

4553
03:24:49,180 --> 03:24:51,360
Because this one has the most heavy amount of...

4554
03:24:51,360 --> 03:24:53,440
Oh, wait, they both have a heavy amount of...

4555
03:24:53,440 --> 03:24:54,240
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

4556
03:24:54,460 --> 03:24:54,840
Oh!

4557
03:24:54,960 --> 03:24:55,480
I did it!

4558
03:24:57,660 --> 03:24:58,620
How does that look?

4559
03:24:59,260 --> 03:25:00,060
It looks great!

4560
03:25:00,200 --> 03:25:02,200
All that horrible steam is cleared out of the way!

4561
03:25:04,580 --> 03:25:06,120
It's not that... it's not far now.

4562
03:25:06,280 --> 03:25:07,240
Let's try and move forward.

4563
03:25:09,360 --> 03:25:09,740
Ouch!

4564
03:25:14,270 --> 03:25:15,290
You swapped perfectly.

4565
03:25:15,430 --> 03:25:15,930
First try.

4566
03:25:16,270 --> 03:25:16,630
Yeah!

4567
03:25:18,870 --> 03:25:20,830
I thought I might have to swap one other one, but...

4568
03:25:20,830 --> 03:25:21,190
Nice!

4569
03:25:21,370 --> 03:25:21,750
Cool!

4570
03:25:23,090 --> 03:25:23,830
Look up there!

4571
03:25:23,950 --> 03:25:25,390
If I can just make it to that door!

4572
03:25:25,910 --> 03:25:26,670
We can escape!

4573
03:25:28,930 --> 03:25:30,930
Now, how in the world am I going to get up there?

4574
03:25:31,730 --> 03:25:32,510
Don't yell at me!

4575
03:25:33,710 --> 03:25:35,970
If you want to yell, you can yell at me!

4576
03:25:36,290 --> 03:25:38,350
Oh my god, no, nobody should yell at you, missile!

4577
03:25:43,850 --> 03:25:45,310
You should play the lottery mint?

4578
03:25:46,090 --> 03:25:47,170
With my luck?

4579
03:25:48,010 --> 03:25:48,810
No way...

4580
03:25:53,330 --> 03:25:56,190
Missile, how can I yell at you when you're so sweet about it?

4581
03:25:57,110 --> 03:25:58,290
Oh, I think you just did.

4582
03:25:59,770 --> 03:26:02,470
Let's look for something to pull Miss Lin up with.

4583
03:26:03,350 --> 03:26:07,490
Something to whisk Miss Lin up and glide her ever so gently to the top with.

4584
03:26:08,610 --> 03:26:10,250
Hey, are you being sarcastic?

4585
03:26:12,110 --> 03:26:12,550
Alright.

4586
03:26:15,550 --> 03:26:16,170
No, no.

4587
03:26:16,770 --> 03:26:17,910
Let's see what we got here.

4588
03:26:18,770 --> 03:26:20,710
A distributing panel.

4589
03:26:22,110 --> 03:26:23,970
A switch, a fuse box.

4590
03:26:26,710 --> 03:26:27,830
A wheel.

4591
03:26:27,990 --> 03:26:29,070
The wheel...

4592
03:26:29,870 --> 03:26:31,110
works for...

4593
03:26:31,770 --> 03:26:32,170
Wait.

4594
03:26:32,690 --> 03:26:34,490
The switch works for this...

4595
03:26:34,490 --> 03:26:36,570
for this ladder.

4596
03:26:36,850 --> 03:26:38,870
So, what does this...

4597
03:26:41,050 --> 03:26:42,090
wheel do?

4598
03:26:43,670 --> 03:26:44,190
Hm...

4599
03:26:46,530 --> 03:26:47,050
Uh...

4600
03:26:47,050 --> 03:26:47,210
Oh!

4601
03:26:47,750 --> 03:26:48,850
I'm going ghost!

4602
03:26:49,850 --> 03:26:51,390
Okay, let's see...

4603
03:26:54,730 --> 03:26:55,770
This switch...

4604
03:26:56,690 --> 03:26:57,210
Um...

4605
03:26:58,330 --> 03:26:59,730
How can I get over there?

4606
03:27:00,650 --> 03:27:01,170
Hm...

4607
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:05,230
Because I think the wheel is what does it.

4608
03:27:06,030 --> 03:27:07,490
How can I get over there?

4609
03:27:07,770 --> 03:27:08,230
Hm...

4610
03:27:08,230 --> 03:27:09,850
Mwa-mwa-mwa-mwa...

4611
03:27:10,490 --> 03:27:12,070
Mwa-mwa-mwa-mwa-mwa...

4612
03:27:12,090 --> 03:27:15,430
Um... emergency light... pipe...

4613
03:27:18,910 --> 03:27:22,170
Oh wait, actually, let's get you out of there.

4614
03:27:22,590 --> 03:27:25,130
Let's get to the fuse box and see if there's something we can do here.

4615
03:27:25,430 --> 03:27:25,670
Oh!

4616
03:27:25,850 --> 03:27:26,130
Oh!

4617
03:27:26,810 --> 03:27:27,210
Open.

4618
03:27:27,950 --> 03:27:28,710
Open, sesame!

4619
03:27:29,310 --> 03:27:30,230
Okay, ghost.

4620
03:27:31,770 --> 03:27:33,070
Now we can open the door.

4621
03:27:34,310 --> 03:27:36,150
If I can get this door open, Lin can escape!

4622
03:27:36,950 --> 03:27:37,930
I can't budge it.

4623
03:27:38,070 --> 03:27:39,050
I must be stuck or something.

4624
03:27:39,490 --> 03:27:42,370
I guess we'll have to wait for Lin to use her miraculous power.

4625
03:27:44,010 --> 03:27:45,350
Of course we have to get up there.

4626
03:27:50,230 --> 03:27:52,210
Oh, we can move the hook!

4627
03:27:55,050 --> 03:27:55,430
Easy.

4628
03:27:56,870 --> 03:27:58,150
Never mind, I was overthinking.

4629
03:27:58,830 --> 03:28:00,510
Now this is what I'm talking about.

4630
03:28:02,590 --> 03:28:03,230
Okay, nice.

4631
03:28:04,710 --> 03:28:05,710
Okay, raise away!

4632
03:28:10,410 --> 03:28:10,850
Alrighty.

4633
03:28:12,570 --> 03:28:16,070
Okay, come on, Lin.

4634
03:28:16,310 --> 03:28:17,590
Use your super strength.

4635
03:28:19,230 --> 03:28:20,970
Girl boss your way through the door.

4636
03:28:25,790 --> 03:28:28,530
Sorry, I can't do it.

4637
03:28:29,350 --> 03:28:30,230
Open it, hurry!

4638
03:28:31,270 --> 03:28:33,030
Is that any way to ask for something?

4639
03:28:33,870 --> 03:28:35,290
Oh, am I lagging?

4640
03:28:35,310 --> 03:28:35,630
Am I okay?

4641
03:28:35,830 --> 03:28:37,210
Oh, I'm lagging a little bit.

4642
03:28:37,270 --> 03:28:37,510
Sorry.

4643
03:28:37,510 --> 03:28:38,190
Oh!

4644
03:28:38,530 --> 03:28:40,590
What am I doing?

4645
03:28:40,790 --> 03:28:41,250
Opening?

4646
03:28:42,270 --> 03:28:42,730
Together!

4647
03:28:43,670 --> 03:28:44,550
It's no use.

4648
03:28:44,790 --> 03:28:45,710
I can't budge it.

4649
03:28:45,790 --> 03:28:46,330
It must be stuck.

4650
03:28:47,310 --> 03:28:47,930
Oh no!

4651
03:28:50,850 --> 03:28:52,610
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

4652
03:28:52,730 --> 03:28:52,950
No!

4653
03:28:54,570 --> 03:28:55,990
I got so far, please!

4654
03:28:58,330 --> 03:28:59,290
Wait, what just happened?

4655
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:02,670
What the?

4656
03:29:02,670 --> 03:29:02,770
What the?

4657
03:29:08,400 --> 03:29:09,280
The Kraken?

4658
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:11,580
Why am I lagging?

4659
03:29:14,860 --> 03:29:15,300
Who?

4660
03:29:15,820 --> 03:29:16,480
The doctor?

4661
03:29:16,680 --> 03:29:17,560
What just happened?

4662
03:29:17,720 --> 03:29:18,880
I can't believe my eyes.

4663
03:29:19,120 --> 03:29:20,920
Lin and the little lady suddenly vanished.

4664
03:29:21,080 --> 03:29:22,740
Leaving only darkness and sea water.

4665
03:29:24,360 --> 03:29:26,380
The submarine continues to sink down.

4666
03:29:26,500 --> 03:29:28,180
Down into the deep, deep sea.

4667
03:29:28,480 --> 03:29:30,720
But I still want to try and make my way up.

4668
03:29:30,780 --> 03:29:31,700
As far as possible.

4669
03:29:31,820 --> 03:29:32,400
What just happened?

4670
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:34,680
The Klaaaad.

4671
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:38,140
Still want to head up to find a single ray of light.

4672
03:29:38,280 --> 03:29:41,440
Light to illuminate the truth at the bottom of this deep, deep darkness.

4673
03:29:42,640 --> 03:29:43,520
Thanks, Cecil.

4674
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:44,300
So poetic.

4675
03:29:46,140 --> 03:29:46,720
What just?

4676
03:29:46,880 --> 03:29:47,100
Who?

4677
03:29:47,500 --> 03:29:47,980
Huh?

4678
03:29:52,810 --> 03:29:54,310
The final struggle.

4679
03:29:58,110 --> 03:29:58,590
Okay.

4680
03:29:59,230 --> 03:30:00,610
What chapter are we on now?

4681
03:30:01,230 --> 03:30:01,710
Seventeen?

4682
03:30:05,510 --> 03:30:05,990
Seventeen!

4683
03:30:06,270 --> 03:30:07,210
Two more chapters!

4684
03:30:07,210 --> 03:30:09,050
Oh my gosh.

4685
03:30:10,070 --> 03:30:10,590
Strappin'!

4686
03:30:10,590 --> 03:30:11,210
Okay.

4687
03:30:12,150 --> 03:30:15,410
The upended submarine continues to sink, slowly but surely.

4688
03:30:15,650 --> 03:30:18,390
A long, long journey to the bottom of the sea.

4689
03:30:23,100 --> 03:30:27,300
Lin and the little lady found the darkness and the salt water closing in on them.

4690
03:30:27,500 --> 03:30:30,160
But at the very last second, something saved them.

4691
03:30:30,340 --> 03:30:32,260
Now it looks down at them, quietly.

4692
03:30:32,920 --> 03:30:34,220
Is it... Ray?

4693
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:36,740
The Klaaaad.

4694
03:30:39,440 --> 03:30:41,520
Oh my god, it looks like it has big ol' googly eyes.

4695
03:30:42,500 --> 03:30:44,400
My head is filled with one giant question.

4696
03:30:45,300 --> 03:30:46,840
What in the world is this thing?

4697
03:30:49,500 --> 03:30:49,980
Um...

4698
03:30:51,000 --> 03:30:51,480
What?

4699
03:30:52,100 --> 03:30:52,580
Eee!

4700
03:30:56,530 --> 03:30:57,010
Oh.

4701
03:30:57,210 --> 03:30:57,630
Oh.

4702
03:30:57,770 --> 03:30:58,170
Oh.

4703
03:30:58,930 --> 03:31:01,150
That only had enough... What the...

4704
03:31:01,710 --> 03:31:02,190
What?

4705
03:31:03,370 --> 03:31:04,390
Oh my god, it's...

4706
03:31:05,650 --> 03:31:06,130
What?

4707
03:31:07,450 --> 03:31:08,870
It's Dark Magician...

4708
03:31:10,250 --> 03:31:11,550
Wait, it's Cecil?

4709
03:31:18,700 --> 03:31:21,420
I see you managed to survive, detective.

4710
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:24,520
Hey, you're...

4711
03:31:26,660 --> 03:31:27,960
Excuse my appearance.

4712
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:29,700
I seem to have lost my body.

4713
03:31:31,500 --> 03:31:33,220
He looks so awesome.

4714
03:31:33,760 --> 03:31:34,620
Oh no.

4715
03:31:35,500 --> 03:31:36,700
I'm into robots.

4716
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:38,780
Oh, and you...

4717
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:40,280
Me?

4718
03:31:40,460 --> 03:31:40,960
Minto?

4719
03:31:41,640 --> 03:31:44,640
You're the ghost who's been saving Lin all evening, aren't you?

4720
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:45,120
I mean...

4721
03:31:46,180 --> 03:31:47,860
I mean, yeah...

4722
03:31:48,940 --> 03:31:52,940
I guess you might say that I am the ghost that's been doing all the work, huh?

4723
03:31:58,100 --> 03:31:58,580
Yeah...

4724
03:32:05,970 --> 03:32:07,810
You knew about me all along?

4725
03:32:08,610 --> 03:32:09,330
Of course.

4726
03:32:09,650 --> 03:32:12,130
What else would explain all those unnatural things happening?

4727
03:32:13,690 --> 03:32:16,770
If you knew, how come you didn't do anything about it all this time?

4728
03:32:16,770 --> 03:32:20,190
And how come you decided to save us all of a sudden?

4729
03:32:20,850 --> 03:32:22,970
I thought you wanted to get revenge on us.

4730
03:32:24,090 --> 03:32:25,590
Fourth wall break real.

4731
03:32:27,850 --> 03:32:28,870
I don't really know.

4732
03:32:30,430 --> 03:32:31,950
Please, you gotta tell me.

4733
03:32:32,230 --> 03:32:33,270
I need to know.

4734
03:32:35,810 --> 03:32:36,290
Oh!

4735
03:32:37,290 --> 03:32:38,810
I'm back into a wisp.

4736
03:32:39,890 --> 03:32:41,410
Who in the world are you?

4737
03:32:42,850 --> 03:32:43,830
Cecil, look at you!

4738
03:32:43,930 --> 03:32:44,670
What happened?

4739
03:32:45,410 --> 03:32:48,170
I can't hold on to that image of myself any longer.

4740
03:32:49,430 --> 03:32:51,070
You can't remember who you are?

4741
03:32:52,210 --> 03:32:52,870
That's right.

4742
03:32:53,070 --> 03:32:54,290
I'm a cool wisp.

4743
03:32:55,550 --> 03:32:56,350
It's you guys.

4744
03:32:57,130 --> 03:33:00,170
I came all this way tonight trying to chase down my lost memory.

4745
03:33:00,570 --> 03:33:03,290
For quite a bit of tonight, I thought I was you, Cecil.

4746
03:33:04,490 --> 03:33:04,930
Cecil?

4747
03:33:05,210 --> 03:33:06,450
My name isn't Cecil.

4748
03:33:08,430 --> 03:33:09,630
Wait, but we knew that.

4749
03:33:10,050 --> 03:33:11,730
I bet you'll remember really soon.

4750
03:33:12,250 --> 03:33:13,190
Who you are.

4751
03:33:13,190 --> 03:33:14,750
And who I am, too.

4752
03:33:16,570 --> 03:33:17,010
What?

4753
03:33:20,910 --> 03:33:22,730
The man in front of me is not me.

4754
03:33:23,350 --> 03:33:25,130
I'm even further away from the truth.

4755
03:33:25,510 --> 03:33:26,390
Or maybe not.

4756
03:33:26,790 --> 03:33:28,390
Something is stirring in my mind.

4757
03:33:28,450 --> 03:33:29,530
A memory about to emerge.

4758
03:33:31,650 --> 03:33:32,790
Do I know this man?

4759
03:33:33,470 --> 03:33:38,590
Now that I've shed my image of myself, I feel like I'm one step closer to the truth.

4760
03:33:40,010 --> 03:33:40,890
Info dump incoming.

4761
03:33:41,070 --> 03:33:41,490
Let's go.

4762
03:33:47,260 --> 03:33:48,880
But the water...

4763
03:33:52,560 --> 03:33:53,840
They got us good.

4764
03:33:54,100 --> 03:33:55,780
It's all over for this submarine.

4765
03:33:56,580 --> 03:33:58,180
Its engine room is destroyed.

4766
03:33:58,620 --> 03:33:59,740
There's a hole in the hole.

4767
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:05,200
Wait, there's a hole in the hole.

4768
03:34:06,840 --> 03:34:09,820
There's a hole in the hole.

4769
03:34:11,700 --> 03:34:13,320
In the hu-hull.

4770
03:34:15,740 --> 03:34:17,840
And it's sinking as we speak.

4771
03:34:20,100 --> 03:34:21,460
What are you doing here?

4772
03:34:22,020 --> 03:34:23,840
I thought you had a deal with those people.

4773
03:34:25,520 --> 03:34:26,660
They betrayed me.

4774
03:34:26,800 --> 03:34:28,360
I was a fool to trust them.

4775
03:34:29,060 --> 03:34:30,880
They already have what they wanted now.

4776
03:34:31,520 --> 03:34:33,900
But how do they still have the powers?

4777
03:34:34,200 --> 03:34:35,640
The Temsik Fragment.

4778
03:34:37,180 --> 03:34:39,440
I didn't know they had it all figured out.

4779
03:34:40,720 --> 03:34:42,980
You mean they figured out the source of your powers?

4780
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:46,920
A hole in the hull.

4781
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:51,520
Hull.

4782
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:53,280
A hole.

4783
03:34:53,700 --> 03:34:54,220
Hole.

4784
03:34:54,660 --> 03:34:55,620
In the...

4785
03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:03,040
Yeah, that meteorite's radiation has two effects on living creatures.

4786
03:35:03,700 --> 03:35:05,820
It gives power and time.

4787
03:35:08,220 --> 03:35:11,400
If you don't mind, we'd like to hear more.

4788
03:35:12,820 --> 03:35:15,040
Oh, the radiation's power effect.

4789
03:35:15,980 --> 03:35:17,140
These ten years.

4790
03:35:17,600 --> 03:35:20,880
I've been watching that junkyard superintendent do his research.

4791
03:35:24,720 --> 03:35:26,100
You old meme.

4792
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:31,440
Yo Mint, I heard you like drowning so I put a hole in the hole so you can sink while you sink.

4793
03:35:36,620 --> 03:35:39,960
And I think I've kind of got some of it figured out.

4794
03:35:44,790 --> 03:35:48,050
The meteorite's radiation gives spirits special powers.

4795
03:35:49,070 --> 03:35:51,290
Like possessing and manipulating objects.

4796
03:35:52,410 --> 03:35:54,350
And in my case, swapping objects.

4797
03:35:55,270 --> 03:35:55,870
Exactly.

4798
03:35:56,330 --> 03:35:59,270
Apparently there are individual differences in the powers we get.

4799
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:02,870
And it seems these powers change as time goes by.

4800
03:36:04,190 --> 03:36:05,010
They do?

4801
03:36:05,730 --> 03:36:06,330
Yeah.

4802
03:36:06,410 --> 03:36:09,030
My powers have changed over these past ten years.

4803
03:36:09,330 --> 03:36:12,130
At first I could only manipulate small living creatures.

4804
03:36:15,290 --> 03:36:16,210
Now then.

4805
03:36:16,310 --> 03:36:18,550
How do you suppose we got these powers?

4806
03:36:19,050 --> 03:36:19,910
It's simple.

4807
03:36:20,450 --> 03:36:21,270
It is?

4808
03:36:21,410 --> 03:36:22,090
How then?

4809
03:36:22,630 --> 03:36:23,530
In a nutshell.

4810
03:36:23,870 --> 03:36:27,810
We died while exposed to the energy emitted by the meteorite.

4811
03:36:27,910 --> 03:36:28,850
It's radiation.

4812
03:36:32,710 --> 03:36:33,910
That's... what does it?

4813
03:36:34,010 --> 03:36:35,910
Dying while being exposed to the radiation?

4814
03:36:38,210 --> 03:36:39,930
On that day ten years ago.

4815
03:36:40,690 --> 03:36:41,430
Oh my gosh.

4816
03:36:41,450 --> 03:36:42,510
We actually see his outline.

4817
03:36:42,610 --> 03:36:43,090
His silhouette.

4818
03:36:46,250 --> 03:36:46,690
Woah!

4819
03:36:46,830 --> 03:36:47,270
Woah!

4820
03:36:47,850 --> 03:36:48,570
Oh my god.

4821
03:36:48,750 --> 03:36:49,870
Butt up in the air!

4822
03:36:49,950 --> 03:36:50,970
Just like how he died again!

4823
03:36:54,010 --> 03:36:57,550
A fragment of that meteorite pierced my heart and I died.

4824
03:37:00,970 --> 03:37:03,110
So of course I received special powers.

4825
03:37:04,930 --> 03:37:06,030
It's a canon event.

4826
03:37:06,550 --> 03:37:07,490
Hey, wait a minute!

4827
03:37:07,990 --> 03:37:09,630
Is that how I got my powers too?

4828
03:37:11,010 --> 03:37:12,310
You know that might be right.

4829
03:37:13,310 --> 03:37:14,670
No, I don't want to see it!

4830
03:37:16,530 --> 03:37:16,970
No!

4831
03:37:25,020 --> 03:37:28,640
Aren't the Temsik remnants still right there in that park at the bottom of the crater?

4832
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:30,560
You're right.

4833
03:37:31,740 --> 03:37:33,000
So that must mean...

4834
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:36,240
I must have died in the presence of the meteorite's radiation too.

4835
03:37:41,250 --> 03:37:42,630
The radiation's time effect.

4836
03:37:43,970 --> 03:37:47,530
Another effect the meteorite's radiation has on us is that it gives us time.

4837
03:37:47,530 --> 03:37:51,290
Again, I think this time effect is centered around the theme of death.

4838
03:37:51,630 --> 03:37:53,010
But it's not all that clear.

4839
03:37:53,870 --> 03:37:59,190
So the fact that I can return to four minutes before a person's death is another effect of that meteorite.

4840
03:38:01,650 --> 03:38:07,550
One of the characteristics of that meteorite is its ability to replay the moment of death.

4841
03:38:09,070 --> 03:38:10,410
Replay the moment of death?

4842
03:38:11,770 --> 03:38:13,650
This is all so strange and confusing!

4843
03:38:13,850 --> 03:38:14,890
I can't take it all in!

4844
03:38:14,890 --> 03:38:18,990
It makes about as much sense to me as anything else!

4845
03:38:20,910 --> 03:38:22,590
Yeah, strange and confusing.

4846
03:38:22,970 --> 03:38:26,990
That just about sums up the object that pierced my body that day.

4847
03:38:28,690 --> 03:38:30,030
Four minutes death hype.

4848
03:38:31,910 --> 03:38:37,250
Thanks to that meteorite fragment, my very existence is a contradiction.

4849
03:38:38,610 --> 03:38:39,270
What do you mean?

4850
03:38:41,910 --> 03:38:42,950
Contradictory existence?

4851
03:38:44,890 --> 03:38:48,150
That day, when the fragment pierced my heart, I lost my life.

4852
03:38:48,710 --> 03:38:54,910
However, because it remained inside me, that fragment continued to constantly regenerate my body.

4853
03:38:55,690 --> 03:39:02,450
In other words, my body was continuously cycling between the moments that separated my life and death.

4854
03:39:05,450 --> 03:39:08,750
My body's vital function stopped ten years ago.

4855
03:39:08,890 --> 03:39:13,530
But my body's time is perpetually stopped at the moment just before death.

4856
03:39:13,530 --> 03:39:15,410
So that's why he doesn't...

4857
03:39:17,750 --> 03:39:19,090
That's why he hasn't...

4858
03:39:21,210 --> 03:39:22,030
What's the word?

4859
03:39:22,130 --> 03:39:22,510
Oh my god.

4860
03:39:26,760 --> 03:39:27,260
Dissolved.

4861
03:39:27,840 --> 03:39:29,220
That's why he hasn't dissolved.

4862
03:39:29,420 --> 03:39:30,320
His body.

4863
03:39:30,680 --> 03:39:31,180
Decomposed.

4864
03:39:33,640 --> 03:39:34,140
Decomposed.

4865
03:39:34,140 --> 03:39:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

4866
03:39:36,900 --> 03:39:40,240
I've been trying to think of decompose... that word all night.

4867
03:39:40,540 --> 03:39:42,700
And every time I just keep thinking of dissolved.

4868
03:39:48,460 --> 03:39:50,120
Time just stopped, huh?

4869
03:39:51,200 --> 03:39:52,680
So I just simply existed.

4870
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:53,900
Not really alive.

4871
03:39:54,140 --> 03:39:55,160
Not really dead.

4872
03:39:56,120 --> 03:39:58,780
That pretty much sums up these last ten years for me.

4873
03:39:58,900 --> 03:40:00,840
Ever since that incident in the park.

4874
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:03,020
My body hasn't aged a day.

4875
03:40:03,320 --> 03:40:05,180
My hair hasn't grown an inch.

4876
03:40:06,580 --> 03:40:09,220
Come to think of it, that old pigeon guy mentioned something.

4877
03:40:09,580 --> 03:40:13,080
He said he couldn't cut his... this guy's body with the scalpel.

4878
03:40:13,160 --> 03:40:13,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4879
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:16,240
Neither truly alive.

4880
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:18,020
Nor truly dead.

4881
03:40:19,780 --> 03:40:22,480
This game is becoming more and more like Metal Gear.

4882
03:40:24,880 --> 03:40:26,460
I love your stream.

4883
03:40:27,400 --> 03:40:28,500
You are cool.

4884
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:29,720
Thank you!

4885
03:40:30,880 --> 03:40:32,200
Thank you for the super chat.

4886
03:40:33,200 --> 03:40:36,960
So I guess as soon as an incision was made, his body would be regenerated.

4887
03:40:37,320 --> 03:40:37,820
Wow.

4888
03:40:39,840 --> 03:40:41,360
This guy is just Gray Fox.

4889
03:40:41,660 --> 03:40:42,660
Wanting to get revenge.

4890
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:47,320
And also... not being able to be alive or dead.

4891
03:40:48,460 --> 03:40:49,500
After Temsik.

4892
03:40:50,720 --> 03:40:51,240
Revenge.

4893
03:40:51,940 --> 03:40:55,000
Before I left this country, I wanted to do one thing.

4894
03:40:55,240 --> 03:40:58,580
I wanted to get revenge on the people who stole our lives.

4895
03:40:59,220 --> 03:41:00,120
Our lives?

4896
03:41:00,960 --> 03:41:03,900
As part of the deal, I made those guys promise to cooperate.

4897
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:06,440
Cooperate?

4898
03:41:06,440 --> 03:41:07,140
You mean the kidnapping?

4899
03:41:08,380 --> 03:41:09,580
It all went fine.

4900
03:41:09,820 --> 03:41:13,560
I manipulated the justice minister and made him issue the execution order.

4901
03:41:15,100 --> 03:41:18,760
But I thought he might call off the execution at the last second.

4902
03:41:19,440 --> 03:41:22,320
So that's why you wanted his daughter kidnapped.

4903
03:41:24,220 --> 03:41:25,900
But they kidnapped the wrong girl.

4904
03:41:26,120 --> 03:41:27,260
Who was our, yeah.

4905
03:41:30,820 --> 03:41:31,260
Unless...

4906
03:41:33,160 --> 03:41:34,600
Unless also the wife?

4907
03:41:34,800 --> 03:41:34,920
No.

4908
03:41:35,820 --> 03:41:36,260
Hmm.

4909
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:40,820
Little did I know, they had their own reasons for cooperating with me.

4910
03:41:40,940 --> 03:41:41,660
I mean, yeah.

4911
03:41:41,720 --> 03:41:42,880
What would they get out of it?

4912
03:41:42,900 --> 03:41:43,540
If not, they wouldn't be able to do anything.

4913
03:41:43,540 --> 03:41:44,340
They're having their own reasons.

4914
03:41:51,570 --> 03:41:55,110
Their objective was to wipe out everybody who had to do with Temsik.

4915
03:42:01,370 --> 03:42:04,790
Detective Jowd was one such person.

4916
03:42:04,850 --> 03:42:05,990
So they were happy to cooperate.

4917
03:42:10,290 --> 03:42:13,550
The professor and Detective Cabanela.

4918
03:42:13,690 --> 03:42:16,490
Inspector Cabanela and that junkyard super.

4919
03:42:16,650 --> 03:42:18,550
They were slated to be wiped out too.

4920
03:42:22,160 --> 03:42:23,740
And as it turns out...

4921
03:42:35,810 --> 03:42:38,150
I was one of their targets as well.

4922
03:42:40,230 --> 03:42:42,190
So they stole my Temsik fragment.

4923
03:42:42,390 --> 03:42:43,250
And here I am.

4924
03:42:46,070 --> 03:42:47,030
So cool.

4925
03:42:47,170 --> 03:42:47,770
I know, right?

4926
03:42:49,050 --> 03:42:51,490
But they had one more final target.

4927
03:42:53,970 --> 03:42:54,490
Lin?

4928
03:42:54,830 --> 03:42:55,770
You, detective.

4929
03:42:58,030 --> 03:42:58,550
Me?

4930
03:43:00,250 --> 03:43:00,870
I'm wipeout.

4931
03:43:01,290 --> 03:43:01,730
You.

4932
03:43:03,590 --> 03:43:04,770
One final target.

4933
03:43:05,050 --> 03:43:06,250
Yeah because you were there.

4934
03:43:06,630 --> 03:43:09,270
If you weren't there in the park that day ten years ago.

4935
03:43:11,770 --> 03:43:15,090
I never would have thought of doing something as stupid as taking a hostage.

4936
03:43:16,370 --> 03:43:17,250
Oh, okay...

4937
03:43:18,190 --> 03:43:19,270
Totally her fault.

4938
03:43:19,370 --> 03:43:19,550
Yep.

4939
03:43:19,690 --> 03:43:21,410
With her golden plunger.

4940
03:43:21,430 --> 03:43:22,230
Whatever the hell she's holding.

4941
03:43:22,790 --> 03:43:24,950
But I was just a little kid playing in the park.

4942
03:43:27,450 --> 03:43:28,250
Yeah, I know.

4943
03:43:38,070 --> 03:43:40,190
It's your fault I took you hostage!

4944
03:43:40,510 --> 03:43:41,010
I know, right?

4945
03:43:55,240 --> 03:43:57,180
So... I told you who I was.

4946
03:43:57,520 --> 03:44:00,160
So that's why then he manipulated her to shoot him.

4947
03:44:00,160 --> 03:44:04,960
And then... then they were going to assassinate her.

4948
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:08,080
But wait, they didn't mean to.

4949
03:44:10,020 --> 03:44:10,520
Huh?

4950
03:44:10,840 --> 03:44:12,660
She was going to get taken to jail anyway.

4951
03:44:14,620 --> 03:44:17,040
You never saw my face that day ten years ago.

4952
03:44:17,520 --> 03:44:19,460
So of course you didn't recognize me.

4953
03:44:20,240 --> 03:44:20,740
Wait...

4954
03:44:23,400 --> 03:44:23,900
Me?

4955
03:44:25,540 --> 03:44:26,660
No, no!

4956
03:44:26,980 --> 03:44:27,780
He's like, yep.

4957
03:44:28,360 --> 03:44:29,480
What can I say?

4958
03:44:30,220 --> 03:44:31,280
He's so cool.

4959
03:44:33,640 --> 03:44:34,540
Yeah, see then.

4960
03:44:34,720 --> 03:44:37,340
I took possession of you to make you shoot me.

4961
03:44:37,460 --> 03:44:38,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4962
03:44:43,080 --> 03:44:44,040
Get the gun.

4963
03:44:46,680 --> 03:44:47,480
He's so cool.

4964
03:44:49,940 --> 03:44:51,720
Your subconscious resisted me.

4965
03:44:51,820 --> 03:44:52,840
Such incredible power.

4966
03:44:53,660 --> 03:44:56,520
It was the first time I wasn't able to control somebody completely.

4967
03:45:00,650 --> 03:45:03,510
The aim was off and the first shot missed the mark.

4968
03:45:04,810 --> 03:45:05,970
Oh, oh, oh.

4969
03:45:06,350 --> 03:45:06,950
Oh!

4970
03:45:14,360 --> 03:45:17,420
The junkyard was equipped with security cameras.

4971
03:45:17,500 --> 03:45:18,020
Wait a second.

4972
03:45:20,580 --> 03:45:22,400
The first shot that missed.

4973
03:45:25,200 --> 03:45:26,900
The first shot that missed.

4974
03:45:27,420 --> 03:45:28,760
That's what killed me.

4975
03:45:29,160 --> 03:45:31,020
That's what killed original Cecil.

4976
03:45:31,320 --> 03:45:33,440
Wait, but... where?

4977
03:45:33,440 --> 03:45:33,520
Where?

4978
03:45:36,260 --> 03:45:36,820
Where?

4979
03:45:37,180 --> 03:45:38,180
Where did it hit?

4980
03:45:38,600 --> 03:45:40,000
Where did it hit?

4981
03:45:40,360 --> 03:45:41,220
Where did it hit?

4982
03:45:41,760 --> 03:45:42,800
But it was down!

4983
03:45:45,100 --> 03:45:47,420
The junkyard was equipped with security cameras.

4984
03:45:47,920 --> 03:45:49,700
I knew you'd be wanted for murder.

4985
03:45:51,660 --> 03:45:53,160
That was my plan anyway.

4986
03:45:59,190 --> 03:46:00,310
Uh oh.

4987
03:46:03,210 --> 03:46:04,730
What if you're a Raccoon?

4988
03:46:05,850 --> 03:46:08,390
And then it's, um... Tango!

4989
03:46:09,570 --> 03:46:10,850
But they had other ideas.

4990
03:46:11,170 --> 03:46:12,870
They simply wanted you wiped out.

4991
03:46:13,110 --> 03:46:14,230
Ah, okay, okay.

4992
03:46:14,390 --> 03:46:17,730
But then, something threw a big monkey wrench into their scheme.

4993
03:46:19,850 --> 03:46:23,990
Because if we're close to the body, if we died close to the body...

4994
03:46:25,330 --> 03:46:27,070
Then, of course, we would get the powers.

4995
03:46:28,450 --> 03:46:30,270
Are we a rat?!

4996
03:46:32,030 --> 03:46:34,030
Oh my gosh, are we a rat?!

4997
03:46:34,790 --> 03:46:36,570
We've been a rat this whole time?!

4998
03:46:36,570 --> 03:46:37,670
Are we a rat?!

4999
03:46:37,670 --> 03:46:39,390
No way...

5000
03:46:39,390 --> 03:46:41,850
That's why we've been following the rats!

5001
03:46:42,330 --> 03:46:44,090
Oh my gosh, we're a rat!

5002
03:46:45,630 --> 03:46:48,470
Remember how I said it's like we're not human?!

5003
03:46:48,470 --> 03:46:49,810
Oh my gosh, we're a rat.

5004
03:46:50,370 --> 03:46:51,550
I showed up.

5005
03:46:52,530 --> 03:46:53,990
You shot a rat!

5006
03:46:54,230 --> 03:46:55,530
You shot a rat!

5007
03:46:56,770 --> 03:46:59,450
I was supposed to meet up with them after that.

5008
03:46:59,870 --> 03:47:01,610
But then something went wrong.

5009
03:47:02,610 --> 03:47:03,550
What happened?

5010
03:47:03,550 --> 03:47:05,430
My body disappeared.

5011
03:47:06,750 --> 03:47:09,610
Aha, the inspector in white was responsible for that one.

5012
03:47:12,530 --> 03:47:13,530
Stop reading chat.

5013
03:47:14,070 --> 03:47:14,790
I'm not!

5014
03:47:18,530 --> 03:47:19,190
I'm not.

5015
03:47:19,690 --> 03:47:22,450
When I'm cooking, I'm really just thinking.

5016
03:47:27,080 --> 03:47:28,400
But also, don't spoil stuff.

5017
03:47:28,860 --> 03:47:29,720
Do not re-chat?

5018
03:47:29,820 --> 03:47:30,440
Okay, I won't re-chat.

5019
03:47:31,080 --> 03:47:31,920
Let's stop reading chat.

5020
03:47:32,060 --> 03:47:33,520
If you guys are posting spoilers, stop it.

5021
03:47:33,520 --> 03:47:36,020
My precious bargaining chip was in that body.

5022
03:47:36,480 --> 03:47:38,320
I had to get it back no matter what.

5023
03:47:39,700 --> 03:47:42,960
That inspector caused me no end of trouble.

5024
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:46,560
But why were those people targeting me?

5025
03:47:47,080 --> 03:47:49,580
I never even heard of the Temsik meteorite.

5026
03:47:50,420 --> 03:47:52,400
Because you were looking into the Jout case.

5027
03:47:53,140 --> 03:47:56,960
I thought you would find out about Temsik sooner or later.

5028
03:48:00,220 --> 03:48:00,740
Okay...

5029
03:48:01,640 --> 03:48:03,220
I guess that's... true.

5030
03:48:04,820 --> 03:48:05,420
Uh-oh.

5031
03:48:05,660 --> 03:48:06,820
How do we get out of here?

5032
03:48:09,200 --> 03:48:11,080
This is so titanic, it's scary.

5033
03:48:12,320 --> 03:48:13,740
That's pretty much the whole story.

5034
03:48:14,300 --> 03:48:17,900
The only thing left to do now is wait for water pressure to crush the submarine.

5035
03:48:18,800 --> 03:48:19,420
Oh no!

5036
03:48:20,520 --> 03:48:23,180
There's no cores that link from here to the water's surface.

5037
03:48:25,100 --> 03:48:26,400
Welcome back after midnight.

5038
03:48:26,520 --> 03:48:26,860
Thank you.

5039
03:48:27,340 --> 03:48:28,160
I have an idea.

5040
03:48:28,340 --> 03:48:29,940
We hook up the phone line and...

5041
03:48:29,940 --> 03:48:33,040
There are no communication cables down this deep.

5042
03:48:34,260 --> 03:48:36,620
They meant for this submarine to be my coffin.

5043
03:48:36,800 --> 03:48:38,320
A coffin for the dead.

5044
03:48:39,260 --> 03:48:40,240
There's no escape.

5045
03:48:44,940 --> 03:48:47,240
I think I kind of understand now.

5046
03:48:48,500 --> 03:48:50,520
What you've been feeling these ten years.

5047
03:48:51,820 --> 03:48:52,600
You what?

5048
03:48:53,500 --> 03:48:54,340
This feeling.

5049
03:48:54,760 --> 03:48:57,380
Cut off from the world all alone in a submarine.

5050
03:48:58,080 --> 03:49:00,720
Sinking slowly towards the bottom of an endless sea.

5051
03:49:01,620 --> 03:49:03,640
This must be how you felt all along.

5052
03:49:08,260 --> 03:49:08,740
Oh!

5053
03:49:11,080 --> 03:49:11,680
Camilla's awake!

5054
03:49:16,130 --> 03:49:16,610
Lin?

5055
03:49:20,580 --> 03:49:21,440
Is it true?

5056
03:49:21,600 --> 03:49:22,560
We're stuck here?

5057
03:49:23,500 --> 03:49:23,980
What?

5058
03:49:28,780 --> 03:49:30,560
At least she's comfy, right?

5059
03:49:30,980 --> 03:49:32,200
If my dad...

5060
03:49:34,480 --> 03:49:37,200
If my dad was here, I bet he'd save us.

5061
03:49:38,280 --> 03:49:38,360
What?

5062
03:49:39,460 --> 03:49:39,960
No!

5063
03:49:43,020 --> 03:49:44,300
This can't be the end.

5064
03:49:44,440 --> 03:49:46,240
Oh, Camilla, I'm so sorry!

5065
03:49:48,980 --> 03:49:49,720
That's funny.

5066
03:49:50,740 --> 03:49:51,780
What is it, Cecil?

5067
03:49:52,700 --> 03:49:54,140
There's something I don't understand.

5068
03:49:55,020 --> 03:49:58,840
Why would they go to all the trouble of detaching the control room?

5069
03:49:59,580 --> 03:50:00,080
What?

5070
03:50:00,680 --> 03:50:04,700
Why didn't they just steal the Temsik fragment and escape if that's what they wanted?

5071
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:06,940
Why did they have to...

5072
03:50:07,440 --> 03:50:09,380
jettison your body off into the sea?

5073
03:50:10,220 --> 03:50:11,760
Hmm, that's a good question.

5074
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:13,940
Well, because he could still get around, right?

5075
03:50:14,060 --> 03:50:14,880
He could still...

5076
03:50:17,060 --> 03:50:19,100
But I guess it doesn't matter why now.

5077
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:20,760
We'll never find it again.

5078
03:50:22,580 --> 03:50:24,520
We have no idea where it was launched to.

5079
03:50:26,700 --> 03:50:27,400
Wait a minute.

5080
03:50:29,660 --> 03:50:30,520
Yes, we do?

5081
03:50:33,480 --> 03:50:35,600
Oh my gosh, he has the pocket watch!

5082
03:50:35,880 --> 03:50:37,900
This will tell us where Detective Jout is.

5083
03:50:39,220 --> 03:50:41,280
That present from the inspector in white.

5084
03:50:42,120 --> 03:50:42,660
That's right.

5085
03:50:42,800 --> 03:50:44,880
Detective Jout told me to hold on to it for him.

5086
03:50:45,360 --> 03:50:49,060
And the bullet is still in this person's body in the command room, right?

5087
03:50:50,040 --> 03:50:50,920
Oh, nice!

5088
03:50:51,980 --> 03:50:54,780
Then we should be able to tell exactly where it is with this.

5089
03:50:56,120 --> 03:50:59,200
But even if we find out where it is, how do we get there?

5090
03:51:00,580 --> 03:51:04,100
We should be able to figure out something between the three of us.

5091
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:05,840
With our powers.

5092
03:51:06,200 --> 03:51:07,060
Right, Ms. Lin?

5093
03:51:08,880 --> 03:51:09,280
Right.

5094
03:51:09,820 --> 03:51:10,220
Wait.

5095
03:51:10,300 --> 03:51:13,420
Are we going to get the manipulating powers?

5096
03:51:16,140 --> 03:51:16,800
Wait a minute.

5097
03:51:16,860 --> 03:51:17,660
What about a torpedo?

5098
03:51:18,800 --> 03:51:19,520
A torpedo?

5099
03:51:20,500 --> 03:51:23,020
In any case, it's way too early to give up.

5100
03:51:24,000 --> 03:51:25,960
Looks like Detective Jout is our last hope.

5101
03:51:26,760 --> 03:51:27,680
Let's get started.

5102
03:51:29,200 --> 03:51:29,960
Oh my gosh.

5103
03:51:30,180 --> 03:51:30,500
Okay.

5104
03:51:32,600 --> 03:51:33,180
Let's...

5105
03:51:34,000 --> 03:51:35,300
We got the bottle.

5106
03:51:35,760 --> 03:51:36,860
We got...

5107
03:51:37,480 --> 03:51:38,720
The control panel.

5108
03:51:38,920 --> 03:51:39,920
Let's operate this.

5109
03:51:40,060 --> 03:51:40,700
Beep boop bop beep.

5110
03:51:41,260 --> 03:51:42,940
Some grapes.

5111
03:51:43,320 --> 03:51:43,900
Nice.

5112
03:51:44,820 --> 03:51:46,020
We won't starve.

5113
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:47,580
Okay.

5114
03:51:49,560 --> 03:51:50,340
Telephone dial.

5115
03:51:52,880 --> 03:51:53,720
Torpedo room.

5116
03:51:55,200 --> 03:51:56,520
The torpedo room, huh?

5117
03:51:57,020 --> 03:51:58,900
There might be another torpedo left there.

5118
03:51:58,900 --> 03:51:59,560
I'll go check it out.

5119
03:51:59,620 --> 03:51:59,700
Yeah.

5120
03:51:59,780 --> 03:52:00,300
There was one.

5121
03:52:01,000 --> 03:52:04,080
You're going to use a missile to ram the control room.

5122
03:52:04,740 --> 03:52:06,020
Well, I don't know about ram.

5123
03:52:06,940 --> 03:52:10,020
We don't want to blow Detective Jout up, but something like that.

5124
03:52:11,820 --> 03:52:13,600
We'll climb up to the torpedo room too.

5125
03:52:13,760 --> 03:52:14,940
Up is definitely safer.

5126
03:52:15,500 --> 03:52:16,540
I'll see you there then.

5127
03:52:17,660 --> 03:52:18,100
Nice.

5128
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:22,740
I like how we still have the glasses on.

5129
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:27,620
Looks like the torpedoes can be launched manually with these switches.

5130
03:52:30,200 --> 03:52:33,040
There are two tubes, so there should be one left.

5131
03:52:33,580 --> 03:52:36,720
I guess the first thing we have to do is load it into the tube.

5132
03:52:37,560 --> 03:52:40,560
When it comes to missiles, you can count on me.

5133
03:52:41,740 --> 03:52:42,140
Okay.

5134
03:52:42,960 --> 03:52:47,000
I'll enter the coordinates of the command room into the torpedo.

5135
03:52:54,210 --> 03:52:56,130
And I just turned on the backup power.

5136
03:52:56,270 --> 03:52:57,870
We ought to be able to use the switches now.

5137
03:52:59,130 --> 03:52:59,530
Okay.

5138
03:52:59,570 --> 03:53:00,270
Let's try it.

5139
03:53:00,890 --> 03:53:01,470
Good luck.

5140
03:53:03,630 --> 03:53:04,570
So what do I do?

5141
03:53:05,930 --> 03:53:06,690
Lower the switch?

5142
03:53:08,670 --> 03:53:09,070
Or...

5143
03:53:10,510 --> 03:53:11,290
Yeah, lower?

5144
03:53:12,390 --> 03:53:13,530
The switch won't budge.

5145
03:53:13,570 --> 03:53:14,070
Maybe it's broken?

5146
03:53:14,990 --> 03:53:16,750
I don't think the entire device is broken.

5147
03:53:17,110 --> 03:53:19,630
It would probably work fine if we could move this switch.

5148
03:53:19,850 --> 03:53:21,230
We'll just have to find a way to move it somehow.

5149
03:53:21,890 --> 03:53:23,270
I can't do it with my powers alone.

5150
03:53:23,550 --> 03:53:24,850
Do you like my sunglasses?

5151
03:53:25,510 --> 03:53:26,510
Thanks for the super chat.

5152
03:53:29,270 --> 03:53:30,930
It's because he's not a ghost.

5153
03:53:31,030 --> 03:53:31,930
He's a shade.

5154
03:53:35,770 --> 03:53:36,550
So true.

5155
03:53:36,930 --> 03:53:38,470
What kind of ghost do you think I am?

5156
03:53:44,610 --> 03:53:45,770
Let's turn this valve.

5157
03:53:46,870 --> 03:53:47,970
Let's see what this does.

5158
03:53:49,250 --> 03:53:49,730
Nothing.

5159
03:53:51,410 --> 03:53:52,750
Do I go to the engine room?

5160
03:53:58,190 --> 03:53:59,090
A phantom?

5161
03:53:59,790 --> 03:54:00,650
Good guess.

5162
03:54:02,090 --> 03:54:02,950
Good guess.

5163
03:54:04,930 --> 03:54:05,410
Hmm.

5164
03:54:05,730 --> 03:54:08,430
The phone line to the engine room isn't working right now.

5165
03:54:08,570 --> 03:54:09,830
Well, that water probably did.

5166
03:54:09,850 --> 03:54:11,990
I guess we don't need to go back there anyway.

5167
03:54:12,270 --> 03:54:12,590
Okay.

5168
03:54:15,130 --> 03:54:15,530
Wait.

5169
03:54:16,690 --> 03:54:18,650
Can I get you to move there, missile?

5170
03:54:22,420 --> 03:54:24,280
What will happen to these two ladies?

5171
03:54:25,140 --> 03:54:26,980
I think that's up to us and our powers.

5172
03:54:27,760 --> 03:54:28,160
What?

5173
03:54:28,640 --> 03:54:30,900
This is no time to be standing around unsure of ourselves.

5174
03:54:31,220 --> 03:54:32,520
Will you lend me your strength, missile?

5175
03:54:33,160 --> 03:54:33,560
Me?

5176
03:54:33,700 --> 03:54:34,620
Of course I will.

5177
03:54:35,260 --> 03:54:36,080
Count on it.

5178
03:54:36,620 --> 03:54:37,020
Okay.

5179
03:54:37,040 --> 03:54:37,380
There we go.

5180
03:54:37,700 --> 03:54:38,100
Okay.

5181
03:54:39,520 --> 03:54:39,920
There we go.

5182
03:54:40,720 --> 03:54:41,120
There we go.

5183
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:41,160
There we go.

5184
03:54:41,880 --> 03:54:44,160
I'm not quite sure what I...

5185
03:54:46,910 --> 03:54:47,450
Oh.

5186
03:54:47,470 --> 03:54:47,910
Whoa.

5187
03:54:48,430 --> 03:54:48,970
Oh.

5188
03:54:49,070 --> 03:54:49,230
Whoa.

5189
03:54:50,070 --> 03:54:51,070
Waste basket.

5190
03:54:51,790 --> 03:54:52,330
Basketball.

5191
03:54:57,870 --> 03:54:59,070
There's still stuff here.

5192
03:54:59,790 --> 03:55:00,330
Telephone.

5193
03:55:00,870 --> 03:55:01,770
Emergency light.

5194
03:55:06,800 --> 03:55:07,940
Can't reach over there.

5195
03:55:08,700 --> 03:55:09,880
Maybe if we go here?

5196
03:55:11,480 --> 03:55:12,020
Here?

5197
03:55:12,280 --> 03:55:12,660
Here?

5198
03:55:14,380 --> 03:55:18,600
Still no, but let's try lowering anyway.

5199
03:55:18,700 --> 03:55:18,800
Okay.

5200
03:55:19,980 --> 03:55:20,460
Okay.

5201
03:55:21,880 --> 03:55:22,740
Didn't do anything.

5202
03:55:27,280 --> 03:55:36,800
Where is the torpedo that we're supposed to be... that we're supposed to be putting in there, right?

5203
03:55:36,900 --> 03:55:37,220
Or something?

5204
03:55:40,690 --> 03:55:42,570
Cleared the same same challenge.

5205
03:55:42,890 --> 03:55:44,770
I unlocked the song same same.

5206
03:55:47,590 --> 03:55:48,070
Wow.

5207
03:55:48,230 --> 03:55:48,830
I had no idea.

5208
03:55:49,150 --> 03:55:49,630
Okay.

5209
03:55:52,170 --> 03:55:52,810
Here we go.

5210
03:55:52,810 --> 03:55:54,910
Your death is a silky ghost made of a house.

5211
03:55:57,390 --> 03:55:59,410
Was I made of a house though?

5212
03:55:59,530 --> 03:55:59,850
I wonder.

5213
03:56:08,260 --> 03:56:13,680
It allows me to go down here, but I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to be doing here.

5214
03:56:16,400 --> 03:56:16,840
Telephone.

5215
03:56:19,480 --> 03:56:20,360
Oh, wait a second.

5216
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:21,600
I'm silly.

5217
03:56:21,760 --> 03:56:22,560
I'm so silly.

5218
03:56:22,660 --> 03:56:22,960
Okay.

5219
03:56:22,960 --> 03:56:24,380
Okay, I get what I'm supposed to be doing here now.

5220
03:56:24,580 --> 03:56:25,600
Okay, we gotta...

5221
03:56:25,600 --> 03:56:27,160
Oh, we're switching the handles!

5222
03:56:27,760 --> 03:56:29,000
I get it, I get it now.

5223
03:56:30,780 --> 03:56:31,400
I'm silly.

5224
03:56:32,580 --> 03:56:35,500
Oh wait, how do I get over into the handle though?

5225
03:56:37,180 --> 03:56:37,700
There we go.

5226
03:56:38,360 --> 03:56:38,720
Switch!

5227
03:56:40,480 --> 03:56:41,600
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5228
03:56:42,860 --> 03:56:43,580
And then...

5229
03:56:44,180 --> 03:56:45,060
Go back down.

5230
03:56:47,060 --> 03:56:49,020
And then we can swap... lower.

5231
03:56:49,200 --> 03:56:49,980
Oh wait, I mean, sorry.

5232
03:56:50,080 --> 03:56:51,100
The other one, the other one.

5233
03:56:51,240 --> 03:56:51,600
Whoopsie.

5234
03:56:54,100 --> 03:56:54,820
This one.

5235
03:56:56,420 --> 03:56:56,980
Lower!

5236
03:56:57,500 --> 03:56:57,800
Okay.

5237
03:57:00,640 --> 03:57:01,680
There we go.

5238
03:57:03,340 --> 03:57:04,160
There we go.

5239
03:57:04,960 --> 03:57:06,800
The torpedo looks serviceable.

5240
03:57:08,440 --> 03:57:09,460
Switching the switches.

5241
03:57:10,740 --> 03:57:12,240
I'll set on this end too.

5242
03:57:12,860 --> 03:57:13,520
Something's odd.

5243
03:57:14,080 --> 03:57:14,780
What is?

5244
03:57:15,120 --> 03:57:16,200
The command room.

5245
03:57:16,420 --> 03:57:17,880
It looks like it's slowly sinking.

5246
03:57:18,660 --> 03:57:19,220
Sinking?

5247
03:57:19,720 --> 03:57:21,840
Yeah, like it's completely run out of power.

5248
03:57:21,980 --> 03:57:22,860
I wonder what happened.

5249
03:57:22,960 --> 03:57:23,900
Uh oh.

5250
03:57:23,980 --> 03:57:26,260
I don't know, but I guess I'll find out.

5251
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:28,220
Okay, hop into the missile.

5252
03:57:28,380 --> 03:57:29,480
I'll launch it for you.

5253
03:57:30,080 --> 03:57:30,520
Thanks.

5254
03:57:34,460 --> 03:57:35,180
Here we go.

5255
03:57:35,620 --> 03:57:36,340
I'm scared.

5256
03:57:36,640 --> 03:57:38,160
Is Detective Jowd gonna be alive?

5257
03:57:38,880 --> 03:57:40,540
I've already set the torpedo's course.

5258
03:57:42,220 --> 03:57:44,740
It'll head toward the command room where Detective Jowd is.

5259
03:57:45,360 --> 03:57:48,480
12 seconds after launching, it'll pass by the command room for an instant.

5260
03:57:49,160 --> 03:57:52,340
That instant will be your window of opportunity to jump over to the command room.

5261
03:57:53,540 --> 03:57:54,120
Got it.

5262
03:57:55,620 --> 03:57:57,740
And then we'll find a way to come back and save you.

5263
03:57:58,340 --> 03:58:00,220
That'll probably be my last task tonight.

5264
03:58:00,720 --> 03:58:02,180
Just hold on until we get back.

5265
03:58:04,060 --> 03:58:04,780
Where did...

5266
03:58:04,780 --> 03:58:05,160
Where is...

5267
03:58:05,160 --> 03:58:06,260
Where is Evil Sissel?

5268
03:58:07,200 --> 03:58:07,820
He didn't...

5269
03:58:07,820 --> 03:58:08,280
He didn't...

5270
03:58:08,280 --> 03:58:09,440
He didn't show up?

5271
03:58:09,700 --> 03:58:10,100
Okay.

5272
03:58:10,140 --> 03:58:10,640
Come on, missile.

5273
03:58:12,940 --> 03:58:14,260
Missile, you have to come with us.

5274
03:58:14,340 --> 03:58:15,520
Missile, you have to come with us.

5275
03:58:16,180 --> 03:58:16,580
Missile?

5276
03:58:17,680 --> 03:58:18,080
I...

5277
03:58:18,520 --> 03:58:19,200
I'm sorry.

5278
03:58:19,340 --> 03:58:19,920
I can't go.

5279
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:21,740
What?

5280
03:58:22,860 --> 03:58:23,800
I just can't.

5281
03:58:23,800 --> 03:58:24,520
How could I leave?

5282
03:58:24,860 --> 03:58:27,200
I can't leave Ms. Lin and Ms. Camilla behind.

5283
03:58:28,040 --> 03:58:29,380
I can't do it.

5284
03:58:30,360 --> 03:58:30,840
Missile.

5285
03:58:31,400 --> 03:58:33,920
I swapped the switches so the missile can be launched.

5286
03:58:34,700 --> 03:58:36,180
You'll have to do the rest, Sissel.

5287
03:58:40,280 --> 03:58:41,680
I can't do it either.

5288
03:58:42,420 --> 03:58:44,960
I can't ask Missile to come with me after that.

5289
03:58:46,140 --> 03:58:48,260
I understand exactly how he feels.

5290
03:58:48,960 --> 03:58:50,440
Yeah, bring Evil Sissel.

5291
03:58:51,780 --> 03:58:53,160
Come with us, Evil Sissel.

5292
03:58:54,640 --> 03:58:55,120
Okay.

5293
03:58:55,460 --> 03:58:56,940
Oh, I guess we're gonna go.

5294
03:58:57,600 --> 03:58:58,980
I want you to go, missile.

5295
03:58:59,800 --> 03:59:00,260
What?

5296
03:59:00,300 --> 03:59:00,880
But Ms. Lin!

5297
03:59:01,800 --> 03:59:03,680
You staying here won't change our fate.

5298
03:59:04,320 --> 03:59:08,300
But if you go with Sissel, you might be able to make something happen.

5299
03:59:08,560 --> 03:59:09,800
And that's our only hope.

5300
03:59:11,400 --> 03:59:13,240
But what if that something doesn't happen?

5301
03:59:14,280 --> 03:59:16,000
I'll never be able to see you again.

5302
03:59:16,020 --> 03:59:16,840
Never ever again.

5303
03:59:18,280 --> 03:59:20,200
Even I can understand that.

5304
03:59:21,140 --> 03:59:22,560
I couldn't stand that.

5305
03:59:23,460 --> 03:59:24,420
Don't worry, missile.

5306
03:59:25,460 --> 03:59:26,460
Miss Camilla.

5307
03:59:27,560 --> 03:59:30,840
I just know you and Sissy can make something happen.

5308
03:59:30,940 --> 03:59:31,760
I believe in you.

5309
03:59:33,360 --> 03:59:35,080
I'll be right here waiting for you.

5310
03:59:35,860 --> 03:59:37,240
We'll see each other then.

5311
03:59:37,400 --> 03:59:38,020
Don't worry.

5312
03:59:43,060 --> 03:59:44,100
Miss Camilla!

5313
03:59:46,220 --> 03:59:47,180
Here he goes.

5314
03:59:48,780 --> 03:59:50,120
That's a good boy, missile.

5315
03:59:54,730 --> 03:59:56,770
Why'd you have to make such a lovable dog?

5316
03:59:59,370 --> 04:00:00,570
Are you ready?

5317
04:00:00,690 --> 04:00:03,410
Remember, it's 12 seconds after I throw this switch.

5318
04:00:04,290 --> 04:00:05,050
We're ready.

5319
04:00:06,730 --> 04:00:07,230
Okay.

5320
04:00:07,630 --> 04:00:08,390
I'm ready.

5321
04:00:08,550 --> 04:00:08,950
I hope.

5322
04:00:10,850 --> 04:00:12,370
It's gonna count down for me, right?

5323
04:00:13,730 --> 04:00:14,230
Sissel?

5324
04:00:14,950 --> 04:00:15,450
Yes?

5325
04:00:16,570 --> 04:00:18,630
We never found out who you really were.

5326
04:00:18,630 --> 04:00:21,090
But that doesn't matter now.

5327
04:00:21,710 --> 04:00:23,950
All I know is I'm truly glad I met you tonight.

5328
04:00:25,030 --> 04:00:26,330
Thank you for everything.

5329
04:00:27,410 --> 04:00:28,890
And I'm glad I met you, detective.

5330
04:00:30,410 --> 04:00:31,950
Well, we're going to see each other again.

5331
04:00:32,010 --> 04:00:32,410
Right, Sissy?

5332
04:00:32,610 --> 04:00:33,150
Right, missile?

5333
04:00:34,270 --> 04:00:34,730
That's right.

5334
04:00:35,010 --> 04:00:36,350
We promised, little lady.

5335
04:00:37,670 --> 04:00:38,910
Of course we will!

5336
04:00:40,150 --> 04:00:41,190
I'll never forget you.

5337
04:00:41,330 --> 04:00:42,490
No matter what happens.

5338
04:00:43,910 --> 04:00:45,310
This is such a death flag.

5339
04:00:45,430 --> 04:00:45,930
Oh, my God.

5340
04:00:46,510 --> 04:00:47,490
Here goes then.

5341
04:00:47,510 --> 04:00:48,610
Don't promise that you'll never see me again.

5342
04:00:48,610 --> 04:00:48,730
Don't promise anything.

5343
04:00:49,530 --> 04:00:50,510
Good luck, friend.

5344
04:01:11,270 --> 04:01:13,630
These 12 seconds are lasting an eternity.

5345
04:01:14,090 --> 04:01:17,630
I strive to think of a way to save Lin and the little lady the whole time.

5346
04:01:19,190 --> 04:01:21,150
But how can a ray of light...

5347
04:01:21,150 --> 04:01:22,010
A ray?

5348
04:01:22,510 --> 04:01:25,130
...of hope reach this far down into the deep sea?

5349
04:01:25,470 --> 04:01:27,910
Before I can think of an answer, the 12 seconds are up.

5350
04:01:30,330 --> 04:01:30,810
Wow!

5351
04:01:32,590 --> 04:01:33,070
Woo!

5352
04:01:34,570 --> 04:01:35,190
Uh-oh.

5353
04:01:36,830 --> 04:01:37,570
There they go.

5354
04:01:47,500 --> 04:01:48,460
Detective Jowd!

5355
04:01:48,940 --> 04:01:51,140
I bet that big masked man did this.

5356
04:01:51,340 --> 04:01:52,520
I'm going to bite him.

5357
04:01:53,060 --> 04:01:54,180
Yeah, you bite him.

5358
04:01:54,300 --> 04:01:54,940
You better not.

5359
04:01:55,020 --> 04:01:55,880
You might break your teeth.

5360
04:01:56,500 --> 04:01:58,580
The command room has lost power and is sinking.

5361
04:01:59,040 --> 04:02:01,320
So I wonder what this masked man is going to do.

5362
04:02:01,480 --> 04:02:02,520
Just sacrifice himself?

5363
04:02:03,500 --> 04:02:05,240
He's going to sacrifice himself!

5364
04:02:06,640 --> 04:02:07,120
No!

5365
04:02:07,220 --> 04:02:07,500
You won't!

5366
04:02:07,500 --> 04:02:08,260
You can't!

5367
04:02:08,920 --> 04:02:10,440
Let's talk to Detective Jowd.

5368
04:02:18,600 --> 04:02:20,240
Sorry for the wait, Detective Jowd.

5369
04:02:20,900 --> 04:02:21,720
Who are you?

5370
04:02:22,120 --> 04:02:23,240
Are you Cecil?

5371
04:02:23,900 --> 04:02:25,340
Please excuse my appearance.

5372
04:02:25,840 --> 04:02:27,340
I can't believe you made it here.

5373
04:02:27,840 --> 04:02:28,800
How is Camilla?

5374
04:02:28,900 --> 04:02:29,520
And what about Lin?

5375
04:02:30,700 --> 04:02:32,520
Well, it's kind of a long story.

5376
04:02:37,820 --> 04:02:41,680
Then that's how they explain it really quickly in Animal Crossing talk.

5377
04:02:41,680 --> 04:02:46,800
I told Detective Jowd about everything that happened on the submarine Yo Mama.

5378
04:02:48,140 --> 04:02:49,920
So the submarine is badly damaged?

5379
04:02:50,920 --> 04:02:53,560
Why would he do that to his own submarine?

5380
04:02:54,840 --> 04:02:55,860
I wish I knew.

5381
04:02:57,480 --> 04:02:59,060
I know the answer to that one.

5382
04:03:00,000 --> 04:03:00,460
Whoa!

5383
04:03:01,280 --> 04:03:03,120
It's because he's afraid of my powers.

5384
04:03:03,220 --> 04:03:03,380
Hey!

5385
04:03:03,780 --> 04:03:05,200
Excuse me?

5386
04:03:05,680 --> 04:03:05,900
You!

5387
04:03:07,560 --> 04:03:08,640
You followed us?

5388
04:03:08,760 --> 04:03:09,440
I didn't even notice.

5389
04:03:10,580 --> 04:03:11,660
It's been 10 long days.

5390
04:03:11,660 --> 04:03:12,960
It's been 10 long years, Detective Jowd.

5391
04:03:16,100 --> 04:03:17,040
Are you...

5392
04:03:18,160 --> 04:03:19,080
Yo-Me-El?

5393
04:03:21,760 --> 04:03:22,760
Yo-Me-El?

5394
04:03:22,900 --> 04:03:23,560
Yo-Me-El?

5395
04:03:23,620 --> 04:03:24,180
Yo-Me-El?

5396
04:03:30,800 --> 04:03:32,660
So you remember me, do you?

5397
04:03:35,500 --> 04:03:37,080
How could I possibly forget?

5398
04:03:38,840 --> 04:03:40,280
So that's your real name, huh?

5399
04:03:40,660 --> 04:03:41,560
Yo-Me-El?

5400
04:03:41,840 --> 04:03:42,780
That's interesting.

5401
04:03:43,280 --> 04:03:43,940
That's right.

5402
04:03:45,340 --> 04:03:46,880
But those people on...

5403
04:03:47,540 --> 04:03:50,000
on the Yonoa were calling you Cecil.

5404
04:03:53,990 --> 04:03:56,710
That's just an alias I was using for my deal with them.

5405
04:03:57,990 --> 04:04:00,430
I didn't see any need to tell them my real name.

5406
04:04:01,410 --> 04:04:02,570
Could you do me a favor?

5407
04:04:03,470 --> 04:04:05,270
Would you let me ask you some questions?

5408
04:04:05,770 --> 04:04:08,210
I've been trying to find out my true identity all night.

5409
04:04:10,490 --> 04:04:14,970
Yo-Me-El is named after a fallen angel and Yomi, the Shinto land of the dead.

5410
04:04:15,990 --> 04:04:20,590
In Shu Takumi tradition, most character names in the game are puns and references.

5411
04:04:20,910 --> 04:04:22,290
In this case, related to death.

5412
04:04:24,350 --> 04:04:25,330
Interesting, interesting.

5413
04:04:28,450 --> 04:04:30,750
It's Yo-Me-El, so yep, you're reading it right.

5414
04:04:30,850 --> 04:04:31,590
Okay, nice.

5415
04:04:31,710 --> 04:04:32,130
Thank you!

5416
04:04:33,090 --> 04:04:33,930
Sure, go ahead.

5417
04:04:34,170 --> 04:04:36,910
I'm sure there's plenty we can still tell you, right, Detective Jowd?

5418
04:04:37,890 --> 04:04:38,330
Right.

5419
04:04:39,510 --> 04:04:40,610
About Yo-Me-El.

5420
04:04:41,470 --> 04:04:42,630
10 years ago...

5421
04:04:43,850 --> 04:04:44,950
10 years ago...

5422
04:04:44,950 --> 04:04:46,170
You were a systems engineer, weren't you?

5423
04:04:47,370 --> 04:04:48,110
Systems engineer?

5424
04:04:48,470 --> 04:04:48,990
What's that?

5425
04:04:50,010 --> 04:04:52,230
By the way, I'm a top Pomeranian, you know?

5426
04:04:54,910 --> 04:04:56,230
Yes, you are, missile.

5427
04:04:57,190 --> 04:05:00,930
Well, it's kind of hard to explain to a dog, but it's a person who's good at using computers.

5428
04:05:02,770 --> 04:05:05,470
I don't mean to brag, but I was one of the best in the industry.

5429
04:05:05,650 --> 04:05:07,430
Oh my god, he's a hacker.

5430
04:05:08,770 --> 04:05:11,210
That's how I got roped into joining that project.

5431
04:05:12,610 --> 04:05:13,010
Project?

5432
04:05:13,010 --> 04:05:13,850
What project?

5433
04:05:15,010 --> 04:05:18,910
It was a project aimed at reorganizing the nation's top secret information.

5434
04:05:19,810 --> 04:05:25,350
The goal was to build a new system using multi-dimensional programming theory.

5435
04:05:26,370 --> 04:05:29,870
I was asked to join the project by an agent of the government.

5436
04:05:30,970 --> 04:05:34,670
It doesn't sound like something a top Pomeranian would know anything about.

5437
04:05:35,730 --> 04:05:39,110
To me, it just sounded like another challenging job.

5438
04:05:41,750 --> 04:05:42,310
Hackerman.

5439
04:05:42,310 --> 04:05:47,670
However, this project was also the target of a secret plot.

5440
04:05:48,510 --> 04:05:52,670
I bet you can imagine the kind of crime the nation's top secrets might attract.

5441
04:05:54,810 --> 04:05:59,590
I never thought for the life of me I'd ever have to deal with spies.

5442
04:06:03,760 --> 04:06:08,560
It was never made public, but every organization in the country moved on this one.

5443
04:06:08,920 --> 04:06:13,000
And then one day, the name of a certain programmer emerged as a suspect.

5444
04:06:16,730 --> 04:06:19,170
I was the guy who built the core of the system.

5445
04:06:20,430 --> 04:06:23,470
The police arrested you, and then that incident happened.

5446
04:06:26,210 --> 04:06:29,690
He escaped from the interrogation room and took little Lin as a hostage.

5447
04:06:31,710 --> 04:06:33,070
Hold on one second.

5448
04:06:33,230 --> 04:06:34,730
I gotta check something real quick, guys.

5449
04:06:34,790 --> 04:06:35,130
Sorry.

5450
04:06:36,230 --> 04:06:36,750
Uh...

5451
04:06:46,510 --> 04:06:47,030
Okay.

5452
04:06:47,990 --> 04:06:48,810
Never mind.

5453
04:06:49,130 --> 04:06:50,410
I never got an answer.

5454
04:06:50,690 --> 04:06:51,130
Hahahaha.

5455
04:06:52,710 --> 04:06:54,430
By the way, Detective Jowd...

5456
04:06:56,290 --> 04:06:58,150
When was it that I was proven innocent?

5457
04:06:59,070 --> 04:07:00,910
About six months after your death.

5458
04:07:01,430 --> 04:07:02,890
I'm so sorry, Yomiel.

5459
04:07:03,770 --> 04:07:04,870
He was framed.

5460
04:07:06,230 --> 04:07:07,530
Real motive for revenge.

5461
04:07:08,150 --> 04:07:09,190
Ten years ago.

5462
04:07:19,440 --> 04:07:22,280
My soul was split from my body and I lost everything.

5463
04:07:23,980 --> 04:07:25,940
I was sealed in eternal darkness.

5464
04:07:28,660 --> 04:07:29,260
Uwaaaah!

5465
04:07:29,380 --> 04:07:30,140
Look at he go ...

5466
04:07:30,140 --> 04:07:33,100
I existed in this world, no question about that.

5467
04:07:37,080 --> 04:07:39,340
But nobody noticed my presence.

5468
04:07:39,640 --> 04:07:40,240
Look at him go!

5469
04:07:44,430 --> 04:07:46,210
What good were my powers?

5470
04:07:46,530 --> 04:07:47,690
they didn't help anybody.

5471
04:07:51,270 --> 04:07:54,230
I would even the passage of time, peel my pain.

5472
04:07:58,170 --> 04:08:00,650
In fact, it only made worse.

5473
04:08:00,650 --> 04:08:00,810
The worst.

5474
04:08:21,870 --> 04:08:22,910
Aww...

5475
04:08:36,050 --> 04:08:37,690
And so that's why you murdered Alma.

5476
04:08:38,710 --> 04:08:39,410
That's right.

5477
04:08:40,030 --> 04:08:43,710
I wanted you to know what it was like to lose everything you cared about.

5478
04:08:44,450 --> 04:08:47,030
I wanted you to feel the same pain I felt.

5479
04:08:47,890 --> 04:08:48,370
What?

5480
04:08:50,590 --> 04:08:52,570
But that's not entirely right, right?

5481
04:08:54,310 --> 04:08:57,690
It was the twisted wish of a mind poisoned by infinite loneliness.

5482
04:08:58,190 --> 04:08:58,490
Yeah.

5483
04:09:01,130 --> 04:09:04,630
And then, as I was plotting my revenge, I had an idea.

5484
04:09:06,270 --> 04:09:10,070
I came up with a plan to use these powers of mine to make a deal.

5485
04:09:12,330 --> 04:09:13,370
The deal.

5486
04:09:14,290 --> 04:09:15,350
What's the deal?

5487
04:09:16,110 --> 04:09:18,230
What's the deal with Ghost Trick?

5488
04:09:20,530 --> 04:09:23,010
There's something I just don't understand about that deal.

5489
04:09:24,550 --> 04:09:31,090
I'm sure your powers would be very valuable to them, but what would you get out of the deal?

5490
04:09:32,370 --> 04:09:33,550
A new life.

5491
04:09:34,310 --> 04:09:34,830
Life?

5492
04:09:36,050 --> 04:09:37,190
I asked them for two conditions.

5493
04:09:38,390 --> 04:09:41,050
Number one was that they helped me with my revenge plot.

5494
04:09:42,570 --> 04:09:44,650
And the second was a rebirth for me.

5495
04:09:46,050 --> 04:09:46,490
Rebirth?

5496
04:09:46,790 --> 04:09:47,990
A new beginning, eh?

5497
04:09:49,030 --> 04:09:52,150
I didn't care if it was a fake life or an artificial life.

5498
04:09:52,490 --> 04:09:55,430
I just wanted a physical receptacle for my soul.

5499
04:09:55,690 --> 04:09:58,450
A name, an identity, an everyday life.

5500
04:09:58,930 --> 04:10:01,810
I wanted to grow old in a society that would accept me.

5501
04:10:02,190 --> 04:10:05,770
And finally, I wanted to die surrounded by a loving family.

5502
04:10:05,810 --> 04:10:06,030
I wanted to grow old in a society that would accept me.

5503
04:10:06,030 --> 04:10:06,030
And finally, I wanted to die surrounded by a loving family.

5504
04:10:08,530 --> 04:10:10,790
That's the kind of life I asked them for.

5505
04:10:12,930 --> 04:10:14,910
A completely man-made life.

5506
04:10:16,610 --> 04:10:17,350
Step one.

5507
04:10:17,450 --> 04:10:17,930
Revenge.

5508
04:10:18,150 --> 04:10:20,210
Step two, become baby.

5509
04:10:22,330 --> 04:10:22,930
That's right.

5510
04:10:23,230 --> 04:10:25,590
I knew I couldn't hope for anything more than that.

5511
04:10:26,570 --> 04:10:30,310
To make it all come true, I knew it would take a lot of money and a lot of power.

5512
04:10:31,390 --> 04:10:34,930
That's why I decided to ask a national government to help me.

5513
04:10:36,050 --> 04:10:38,310
And their response in the end... was betrayal.

5514
04:10:42,030 --> 04:10:42,550
Betrayal.

5515
04:10:45,030 --> 04:10:48,290
They were making their moves much more carefully than I suspected.

5516
04:10:48,770 --> 04:10:52,510
They sent spies to this country and researched my powers on their own.

5517
04:10:53,190 --> 04:10:53,710
And...

5518
04:10:54,830 --> 04:10:57,330
They even figured out what Temsik was all about.

5519
04:10:58,750 --> 04:11:00,830
And you had no idea they were doing all this?

5520
04:11:01,490 --> 04:11:02,390
None at all.

5521
04:11:02,630 --> 04:11:03,650
I was a fool.

5522
04:11:06,050 --> 04:11:06,810
So then...

5523
04:11:06,810 --> 04:11:10,730
Why did they go to all the trouble of making a deal with you?

5524
04:11:12,850 --> 04:11:16,490
Why didn't they just steal a hunk of the Temsik meteorite from the park?

5525
04:11:17,850 --> 04:11:18,970
They couldn't.

5526
04:11:23,830 --> 04:11:28,270
After the manipulator incidents, research was conducted in this country too.

5527
04:11:31,270 --> 04:11:35,570
A report was submitted to the government about the source of the manipulator's power.

5528
04:11:39,600 --> 04:11:40,120
Okay...

5529
04:11:41,600 --> 04:11:44,320
By Inspector Cabanela and the Old Pigeon Guy, eh?

5530
04:11:46,800 --> 04:11:49,040
At first the government didn't believe the report.

5531
04:11:51,580 --> 04:11:53,440
But then they decided to put...

5532
04:11:54,840 --> 04:11:57,700
Put the park under surveillance just in case.

5533
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:58,140
Wait...

5534
04:11:58,800 --> 04:12:00,100
It's not the hippie guy, is it?

5535
04:12:00,540 --> 04:12:01,300
Surveillance, huh?

5536
04:12:02,240 --> 04:12:04,440
It looks like an ordinary peaceful park.

5537
04:12:04,680 --> 04:12:07,680
But there are armed agents there all the time!

5538
04:12:09,880 --> 04:12:10,860
Like him!

5539
04:12:12,320 --> 04:12:15,400
Don't tell me that odd leaflet guy is one of them.

5540
04:12:15,740 --> 04:12:16,800
No, not him.

5541
04:12:16,920 --> 04:12:18,920
He's just a plain old odd person.

5542
04:12:19,060 --> 04:12:19,320
Okay.

5543
04:12:22,620 --> 04:12:23,840
He's just a weirdo.

5544
04:12:23,940 --> 04:12:25,100
Just a weirdo, everybody.

5545
04:12:25,380 --> 04:12:26,380
Nothing to see here.

5546
04:12:27,120 --> 04:12:31,060
That park is like a silent battlefield on an international scale.

5547
04:12:31,980 --> 04:12:34,920
So that's why they couldn't steal the Temsik meteorite.

5548
04:12:34,920 --> 04:12:44,340
And lately, under the pretense of building a housing site, they've been working on a plan to destroy that park in order to secure the Temsik meteorite.

5549
04:12:44,500 --> 04:12:46,500
Oh, so that's it.

5550
04:12:49,280 --> 04:12:52,140
So the upshot of your grand deal...

5551
04:12:52,860 --> 04:12:53,560
was this, eh?

5552
04:12:54,440 --> 04:12:54,960
Yeah.

5553
04:12:55,400 --> 04:12:56,700
It's the ending I deserve.

5554
04:12:57,520 --> 04:13:00,120
But at least there's one thing you must be happy about.

5555
04:13:00,940 --> 04:13:01,540
What's that?

5556
04:13:03,320 --> 04:13:06,300
You've managed to seal me away at the bottom of the sea forever.

5557
04:13:09,240 --> 04:13:09,720
Well?

5558
04:13:10,360 --> 04:13:11,460
Shall we get started?

5559
04:13:12,460 --> 04:13:13,420
Started with what?

5560
04:13:14,200 --> 04:13:16,480
Bringing Detective Jowd back to life, of course.

5561
04:13:16,940 --> 04:13:17,420
What?

5562
04:13:17,540 --> 04:13:18,980
What good will that do now?

5563
04:13:20,300 --> 04:13:21,560
But we promised!

5564
04:13:22,400 --> 04:13:25,100
We promised Ms. Lin and Ms. Camilla we'd save them.

5565
04:13:26,160 --> 04:13:28,520
And we can't do that without you, Detective Jowd.

5566
04:13:30,160 --> 04:13:31,520
I've been guided by fate to save you.

5567
04:13:31,540 --> 04:13:32,300
We'll get tonight to this place.

5568
04:13:32,660 --> 04:13:33,740
I won't give up now.

5569
04:13:34,620 --> 04:13:35,540
All right, fine.

5570
04:13:36,340 --> 04:13:37,600
Let's see where it leads us.

5571
04:13:38,080 --> 04:13:39,800
Gosh, there's so much reading, you guys.

5572
04:13:39,860 --> 04:13:40,700
I'm getting so tired.

5573
04:13:40,740 --> 04:13:41,100
I'm sorry.

5574
04:13:47,870 --> 04:13:48,930
Here we go, then.

5575
04:13:49,010 --> 04:13:50,650
Back to four minutes before your death.

5576
04:13:57,250 --> 04:13:58,650
Trying to get hungry, too.

5577
04:13:59,230 --> 04:14:00,270
You're almost at the end.

5578
04:14:00,350 --> 04:14:01,750
We have one more chapter after this.

5579
04:14:02,990 --> 04:14:07,570
But this shouldn't be so much reading, probably, because we're figuring out the puzzle.

5580
04:14:09,370 --> 04:14:10,130
Hang in there!

5581
04:14:10,730 --> 04:14:11,470
Thank you!

5582
04:14:12,750 --> 04:14:14,190
So, where are we headed?

5583
04:14:15,030 --> 04:14:16,990
We are not headed anywhere, Detective.

5584
04:14:21,690 --> 04:14:25,030
For the mystery of Cecil's identity, you have been given all the clues needed.

5585
04:14:25,230 --> 04:14:27,450
Take a hot minute before diving into the final chapter.

5586
04:14:27,750 --> 04:14:28,850
For chat, hush.

5587
04:14:28,870 --> 04:14:29,330
No spoilers.

5588
04:14:29,730 --> 04:14:30,530
No, it's okay.

5589
04:14:30,530 --> 04:14:33,090
I think I will just go into the final chapter.

5590
04:14:33,290 --> 04:14:33,710
It's no worries.

5591
04:14:35,230 --> 04:14:36,510
I want to see what they...

5592
04:14:36,510 --> 04:14:38,090
I think I've cooked enough.

5593
04:14:38,910 --> 04:14:39,510
You know?

5594
04:14:39,590 --> 04:14:42,190
I think I want to see what the answer is.

5595
04:14:43,890 --> 04:14:44,330
What?

5596
04:14:45,050 --> 04:14:48,190
There was only enough fuel on board to launch us away, Detective.

5597
04:14:48,890 --> 04:14:52,050
We will run out soon and that will be our destination, Detective.

5598
04:14:52,210 --> 04:14:54,590
Wait, does this guy actually just sacrifice himself?

5599
04:14:55,190 --> 04:14:56,290
What are you talking about?

5600
04:14:56,370 --> 04:14:59,010
That would mean that you're trapped here, too.

5601
04:15:04,340 --> 04:15:06,720
By the way, I am not human, Detective.

5602
04:15:07,980 --> 04:15:08,620
I

5603
04:15:12,960 --> 04:15:15,980
am a remote-controlled robot, Detective.

5604
04:15:17,380 --> 04:15:18,020
What?

5605
04:15:22,360 --> 04:15:25,880
Your country's use of technology is just playing off.

5606
04:15:27,020 --> 04:15:28,580
We get that a lot, Detective.

5607
04:15:31,260 --> 04:15:32,680
I don't know.

5608
04:15:34,040 --> 04:15:36,800
Give me robot girls and I'm in.

5609
04:15:36,800 --> 04:15:37,620
Actually.

5610
04:15:39,560 --> 04:15:42,380
Why would you go to all this trouble to do this?

5611
04:15:44,400 --> 04:15:46,020
It's nothing but a shell there.

5612
04:15:46,480 --> 04:15:47,880
It's hardly a threat anymore.

5613
04:15:48,580 --> 04:15:52,560
Commander Sith likes to provide against any possibility.

5614
04:15:52,780 --> 04:15:54,260
No matter how small, Detective.

5615
04:15:57,000 --> 04:15:57,540
Possibility.

5616
04:15:57,960 --> 04:15:59,220
Yeah, we got robot girls.

5617
04:15:59,300 --> 04:16:00,100
We have blue women.

5618
04:16:01,040 --> 04:16:03,240
I think this other country is great.

5619
04:16:03,660 --> 04:16:04,040
Hahaha.

5620
04:16:04,740 --> 04:16:05,280
Hahaha.

5621
04:16:06,340 --> 04:16:07,920
Where's my robot girls at?

5622
04:16:09,100 --> 04:16:10,280
What are you talking about?

5623
04:16:11,280 --> 04:16:12,980
There's no need for you to know, Detective.

5624
04:16:14,900 --> 04:16:15,380
Smack.

5625
04:16:19,540 --> 04:16:20,020
Oh!

5626
04:16:22,480 --> 04:16:24,380
Now it's time to say goodbye, Detective.

5627
04:16:25,120 --> 04:16:26,300
Murph, thanks for a month.

5628
04:16:26,640 --> 04:16:27,340
Thank you.

5629
04:16:28,580 --> 04:16:31,280
In the end, your fate remains the same, it seems, Detective.

5630
04:16:32,780 --> 04:16:33,260
Grr.

5631
04:16:33,840 --> 04:16:34,320
Grr.

5632
04:16:35,340 --> 04:16:36,800
Camilla, forgive me.

5633
04:16:39,340 --> 04:16:40,900
Maybe Shaggy is a robot.

5634
04:16:41,260 --> 04:16:41,720
Good.

5635
04:16:41,780 --> 04:16:43,600
I can't wait to dismantle that guy.

5636
04:16:43,780 --> 04:16:45,220
To teeny tiny pieces.

5637
04:16:45,500 --> 04:16:47,000
By every little bit and bot.

5638
04:16:47,560 --> 04:16:48,700
It's not over yet.

5639
04:16:48,880 --> 04:16:49,860
Not yet, child.

5640
04:16:49,920 --> 04:16:50,840
It's not over yet.

5641
04:16:51,980 --> 04:16:54,860
Remember what that big masked man said?

5642
04:16:55,080 --> 04:16:57,140
Any possibility, no matter how small.

5643
04:16:58,160 --> 04:16:58,720
Possibility.

5644
04:16:58,940 --> 04:17:01,260
In other words, there must be a chance here somewhere.

5645
04:17:01,800 --> 04:17:04,220
The possibility of turning this situation around.

5646
04:17:07,300 --> 04:17:08,660
Do we get other powers?

5647
04:17:09,120 --> 04:17:10,880
Do we get the powers of...

5648
04:17:10,880 --> 04:17:11,900
Of...

5649
04:17:11,900 --> 04:17:12,520
Of...

5650
04:17:12,520 --> 04:17:14,260
Do we get the powers of manipulation?

5651
04:17:16,580 --> 04:17:18,200
Okay, let's see what we got here.

5652
04:17:19,020 --> 04:17:19,480
Huh?

5653
04:17:20,220 --> 04:17:21,240
What is it, Detective?

5654
04:17:21,880 --> 04:17:23,340
Look at Yomiel's shell.

5655
04:17:24,340 --> 04:17:26,640
There's no aura emanating from his body.

5656
04:17:27,140 --> 04:17:28,460
Of course there isn't.

5657
04:17:28,600 --> 04:17:30,080
The Temsik Fragment is gone.

5658
04:17:30,820 --> 04:17:33,700
Could this change in his shell give us some kind of lead?

5659
04:17:33,780 --> 04:17:34,200
I don't know.

5660
04:17:40,510 --> 04:17:41,810
I figured it out.

5661
04:17:43,610 --> 04:17:46,330
I know what this possibility, no matter...

5662
04:17:46,330 --> 04:17:47,010
That was fast.

5663
04:17:48,090 --> 04:17:50,210
This possibility, no matter small...

5664
04:17:50,210 --> 04:17:52,430
No matter how small, is that...

5665
04:17:52,430 --> 04:17:54,450
Is that they are afraid of.

5666
04:17:54,550 --> 04:17:54,730
What?

5667
04:17:55,010 --> 04:17:55,950
What is it?

5668
04:17:55,950 --> 04:17:56,550
That was so fast.

5669
04:17:56,870 --> 04:18:00,250
My time was perpetually stopped thanks to the power of Temsik.

5670
04:18:00,870 --> 04:18:04,470
His body cycled between the moments that separated his life and death.

5671
04:18:06,630 --> 04:18:07,810
But not anymore.

5672
04:18:08,050 --> 04:18:08,590
Wait.

5673
04:18:10,370 --> 04:18:11,210
Can we?

5674
04:18:11,350 --> 04:18:11,830
Wait.

5675
04:18:13,690 --> 04:18:16,210
The Temsik Fragment has been taken away.

5676
04:18:17,130 --> 04:18:18,510
So what does that mean?

5677
04:18:20,150 --> 04:18:20,790
No...

5678
04:18:21,570 --> 04:18:22,770
I get it.

5679
04:18:23,470 --> 04:18:25,950
Your body won't come back to life anymore.

5680
04:18:28,250 --> 04:18:32,510
The moment the Temsik Fragment was removed, my shell became a regular corpse!

5681
04:18:33,010 --> 04:18:33,130
Huh?

5682
04:18:33,810 --> 04:18:34,450
But...

5683
04:18:34,470 --> 04:18:39,410
That means we can... we can go back four minutes before your death?

5684
04:18:42,230 --> 04:18:43,350
But wait a minute.

5685
04:18:45,390 --> 04:18:47,190
Exactly... when is that death?

5686
04:18:48,790 --> 04:18:49,790
Ten years ago?

5687
04:18:50,650 --> 04:18:51,450
That's simple.

5688
04:18:52,030 --> 04:18:53,290
We'll find out...

5689
04:18:53,290 --> 04:18:54,670
when we get there!

5690
04:18:54,850 --> 04:18:55,350
Let's move!

5691
04:18:56,530 --> 04:18:59,990
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

5692
04:19:02,370 --> 04:19:04,550
How do we stop a whole ass meteor?

5693
04:19:11,720 --> 04:19:15,080
I fell back through the cracks of time for what seemed like forever.

5694
04:19:15,340 --> 04:19:16,540
And then I saw it.

5695
04:19:16,600 --> 04:19:17,680
The final death.

5696
04:19:17,900 --> 04:19:19,580
At the end of this long night.

5697
04:19:21,020 --> 04:19:22,420
Who exactly am I?

5698
04:19:22,620 --> 04:19:24,240
I've already seen all the clues.

5699
04:19:24,480 --> 04:19:25,840
All I have to do now is remember.

5700
04:19:29,300 --> 04:19:32,260
The final journey to the truth starts now.

5701
04:19:38,060 --> 04:19:38,640
Oh!

5702
04:19:38,800 --> 04:19:39,380
Oh!

5703
04:19:39,780 --> 04:19:40,360
Okay.

5704
04:19:40,560 --> 04:19:41,860
Final chapter, everybody.

5705
04:19:44,100 --> 04:19:46,140
Four minutes before death variation.

5706
04:19:47,200 --> 04:19:48,140
Oh, cool!

5707
04:19:49,060 --> 04:19:50,320
Oh, awesome!

5708
04:19:51,620 --> 04:19:53,040
Okay, here we go, everybody.

5709
04:19:56,500 --> 04:19:57,540
Last chapter.

5710
04:19:59,060 --> 04:20:00,040
Final chapter.

5711
04:20:01,780 --> 04:20:04,400
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

5712
04:20:06,660 --> 04:20:08,240
When was Yomiel's death?

5713
04:20:08,680 --> 04:20:11,540
It was ten years ago, when the Temsik meteorite fell.

5714
04:20:18,480 --> 04:20:22,400
We traveled back through time, and now we're here at the scene of that death.

5715
04:20:22,620 --> 04:20:25,000
The start of it all is about to replay itself.

5716
04:20:25,640 --> 04:20:26,580
Oh my gosh.

5717
04:20:28,580 --> 04:20:29,880
Here comes the meteor.

5718
04:20:30,860 --> 04:20:32,440
Four minutes before death.

5719
04:20:34,620 --> 04:20:36,180
Oh wow, what a pretty park!

5720
04:20:36,540 --> 04:20:37,560
Oh my gosh, it's so cute!

5721
04:20:40,380 --> 04:20:41,260
She's jamming.

5722
04:20:43,920 --> 04:20:44,360
It's...

5723
04:20:45,640 --> 04:20:46,080
What?

5724
04:20:46,280 --> 04:20:48,260
Oh my gosh, she was making...

5725
04:20:48,260 --> 04:20:50,060
She was making yakiimo!

5726
04:20:50,200 --> 04:20:51,300
She was making sweet potato!

5727
04:20:52,640 --> 04:20:54,000
I thought it was a plunger.

5728
04:20:54,780 --> 04:20:55,480
Give it up.

5729
04:20:55,600 --> 04:20:57,180
Do you really think you can outrun me?

5730
04:20:57,400 --> 04:20:58,400
She was cooking.

5731
04:20:58,620 --> 04:20:59,460
Let her...

5732
04:21:00,840 --> 04:21:01,280
Eek!

5733
04:21:01,460 --> 04:21:03,540
Now just calm down and drop that weapon!

5734
04:21:04,280 --> 04:21:05,020
Stay back!

5735
04:21:05,220 --> 04:21:06,200
Have you come any closer?

5736
04:21:07,240 --> 04:21:08,980
Think you can already get who you are?

5737
04:21:08,980 --> 04:21:10,160
I have no idea anymore.

5738
04:21:10,460 --> 04:21:11,380
I'll shoot her!

5739
04:21:19,670 --> 04:21:20,830
Oh, a baby!

5740
04:21:21,610 --> 04:21:22,210
Huh?

5741
04:21:22,370 --> 04:21:23,010
Oh, a kitten.

5742
04:21:23,170 --> 04:21:24,850
Random cat.

5743
04:21:25,150 --> 04:21:26,010
You might get hurt.

5744
04:21:30,590 --> 04:21:31,530
It's beautiful!

5745
04:21:31,870 --> 04:21:32,270
Oh my gosh.

5746
04:21:37,590 --> 04:21:40,610
And then, the whole human race was extinct.

5747
04:21:47,380 --> 04:21:48,340
Oh, okay.

5748
04:21:48,820 --> 04:21:50,880
Is that gonna have to do something with it somehow?

5749
04:21:57,000 --> 04:21:57,480
Stellar!

5750
04:21:57,480 --> 04:21:57,960
Stellar!

5751
04:22:01,680 --> 04:22:03,080
The cat's okay, right?

5752
04:22:03,960 --> 04:22:04,760
Are you okay?

5753
04:22:05,880 --> 04:22:07,120
The cat's okay, right?

5754
04:22:08,960 --> 04:22:09,840
Where'd the cat go?

5755
04:22:11,000 --> 04:22:12,080
You're all right now.

5756
04:22:12,240 --> 04:22:13,000
Are you hurt?

5757
04:22:14,360 --> 04:22:15,800
You saved me, mister!

5758
04:22:15,800 --> 04:22:16,780
Oh, wait, hold on.

5759
04:22:17,560 --> 04:22:18,220
Um...

5760
04:22:20,180 --> 04:22:22,140
You saved me, mister!

5761
04:22:25,620 --> 04:22:27,780
I was just doing my job.

5762
04:22:28,480 --> 04:22:29,760
The gods.

5763
04:22:29,920 --> 04:22:31,900
They're the ones who saved you.

5764
04:22:35,920 --> 04:22:37,480
What's your job, mister?

5765
04:22:42,800 --> 04:22:43,460
Me?

5766
04:22:43,820 --> 04:22:45,340
I'm a police detective.

5767
04:22:49,270 --> 04:22:49,930
No!

5768
04:22:51,430 --> 04:22:54,070
So that's the Temsik video, right guy?

5769
04:22:55,870 --> 04:22:58,430
It's beautiful looking at it.

5770
04:22:58,690 --> 04:23:01,050
Oh, it's beautiful looking at it from this angle.

5771
04:23:01,790 --> 04:23:03,990
It changed all of our fates completely.

5772
04:23:06,770 --> 04:23:09,310
We can't stop Temsik from falling from the sky.

5773
04:23:10,010 --> 04:23:13,310
But we might be able to protect you from the fragment and save your life.

5774
04:23:16,550 --> 04:23:18,570
I'm so glad you played one of my favorite games.

5775
04:23:18,570 --> 04:23:20,150
The gameplay and story is 10 out of 10.

5776
04:23:20,250 --> 04:23:22,130
I hope you'll play more games like this in the future.

5777
04:23:22,270 --> 04:23:23,790
Also, 10 out of 10 voice acting.

5778
04:23:24,150 --> 04:23:24,790
Thank you!

5779
04:23:26,390 --> 04:23:27,990
Thank you so much for the super chat!

5780
04:23:29,190 --> 04:23:29,930
I don't know.

5781
04:23:30,750 --> 04:23:32,130
What's the matter, Detective Jao?

5782
04:23:34,970 --> 04:23:36,810
To be perfectly honest, I'm scared.

5783
04:23:37,410 --> 04:23:41,530
If that meteorite fragment doesn't get him, I'm pretty sure I would have shot him.

5784
04:23:43,850 --> 04:23:46,050
We might not be able to change your fate of dying.

5785
04:23:48,570 --> 04:23:49,790
I can accept that.

5786
04:23:50,630 --> 04:23:51,090
No!

5787
04:23:52,110 --> 04:23:53,910
What I did is inexcusable.

5788
04:23:54,310 --> 04:23:57,770
No matter how the future might change, that fact will never go away.

5789
04:23:58,570 --> 04:24:01,230
It's my fate to die here, then I accept that.

5790
04:24:01,530 --> 04:24:04,070
Oh, if my fate is to die here, then I accept that.

5791
04:24:08,290 --> 04:24:10,390
This will be our last battle against fate.

5792
04:24:11,710 --> 04:24:13,470
Beyond that will be a new future.

5793
04:24:14,330 --> 04:24:15,530
Okay, let's get started!

5794
04:24:16,750 --> 04:24:18,430
My soul is still here!

5795
04:24:18,570 --> 04:24:19,270
I'm so happy!

5796
04:24:19,990 --> 04:24:20,450
Okay.

5797
04:24:20,450 --> 04:24:24,550
I feel like we're gonna have to probably use Missile's powers to swap something, right?

5798
04:24:29,690 --> 04:24:32,470
Alright, let's see what we got here.

5799
04:24:33,450 --> 04:24:35,030
We can't... I can't reach.

5800
04:24:39,150 --> 04:24:40,750
Missile's just hanging out in the basket.

5801
04:24:41,110 --> 04:24:42,050
Got a nozzle.

5802
04:24:44,430 --> 04:24:46,350
Maybe we have to shoot the...

5803
04:24:47,590 --> 04:24:48,350
Hmm...

5804
04:24:49,250 --> 04:24:50,670
Roasted sweet potato!

5805
04:24:50,890 --> 04:24:55,310
I want roasted sweet potato so badly right now!

5806
04:24:56,590 --> 04:24:57,350
Headphones...

5807
04:24:57,350 --> 04:24:58,350
Okay.

5808
04:24:59,530 --> 04:25:01,570
We don't have much going on here.

5809
04:25:06,210 --> 04:25:07,090
It's ready!

5810
04:25:09,610 --> 04:25:10,790
Let's make it!

5811
04:25:11,450 --> 04:25:12,510
Let's make it!

5812
04:25:14,770 --> 04:25:15,530
Oh!

5813
04:25:15,530 --> 04:25:16,290
Okay.

5814
04:25:21,090 --> 04:25:21,530
Okay.

5815
04:25:23,270 --> 04:25:24,410
Examine the sweet potato.

5816
04:25:25,010 --> 04:25:26,410
What in the world is this thing?

5817
04:25:26,550 --> 04:25:27,310
It's making me hungry.

5818
04:25:27,970 --> 04:25:29,730
Well, well, what can I do?

5819
04:25:31,630 --> 04:25:32,450
I did it!

5820
04:25:34,210 --> 04:25:34,890
Oh boy.

5821
04:25:35,110 --> 04:25:36,750
You even forgot what a sweet potato is?

5822
04:25:37,210 --> 04:25:38,750
It's a roasted root vegetable.

5823
04:25:38,970 --> 04:25:39,430
That's good!

5824
04:25:39,750 --> 04:25:41,150
I love... Oh my gosh.

5825
04:25:41,230 --> 04:25:44,590
If you've never had roasted sweet potato, it's one of the best things ever.

5826
04:25:44,770 --> 04:25:45,570
So good.

5827
04:25:48,870 --> 04:25:50,090
There's nothing like them on a cold...

5828
04:25:50,090 --> 04:25:52,130
Like them on a cold winter's day.

5829
04:25:52,710 --> 04:25:54,530
They're sweet and they smell delicious!

5830
04:25:55,330 --> 04:25:57,290
These guys sure are making me want to try one.

5831
04:25:58,770 --> 04:25:59,250
Okay...

5832
04:26:02,600 --> 04:26:03,800
Still can't reach.

5833
04:26:06,480 --> 04:26:06,960
Hmm...

5834
04:26:10,200 --> 04:26:12,520
I have to switch this and this.

5835
04:26:13,280 --> 04:26:15,400
I have to switch this and this, I think.

5836
04:26:15,640 --> 04:26:15,920
Right?

5837
04:26:28,580 --> 04:26:29,920
The god rock.

5838
04:26:30,160 --> 04:26:30,420
Yeah.

5839
04:26:30,420 --> 04:26:33,120
Can I go grab some food real quick?

5840
04:26:34,040 --> 04:26:34,520
Sorry.

5841
04:26:35,860 --> 04:26:36,880
It's already done.

5842
04:26:37,720 --> 04:26:39,740
So I'm just gonna grab it.

5843
04:26:40,320 --> 04:26:41,020
I'll be...

5844
04:26:41,900 --> 04:26:43,780
Two seconds to grab it.

5845
04:26:45,080 --> 04:26:45,560
Okay.

5846
04:27:13,690 --> 04:27:15,870
Sorry, I started to get shaky all of a sudden.

5847
04:27:16,230 --> 04:27:17,330
Oh, I'm a hungry ghost.

5848
04:27:17,770 --> 04:27:19,190
Oh, I'm a hungry ghost.

5849
04:27:19,290 --> 04:27:20,110
I'm a hungry ghost.

5850
04:27:20,130 --> 04:27:20,770
I'm a hungry ghost.

5851
04:27:20,930 --> 04:27:21,070
Okay.

5852
04:27:22,150 --> 04:27:23,130
I'm a hungry ghost.

5853
04:27:23,150 --> 04:27:23,730
I'm a hungry ghost.

5854
04:27:44,020 --> 04:27:44,500
Sorry.

5855
04:27:44,500 --> 04:27:44,780
Sorry.

5856
04:27:44,940 --> 04:27:45,800
Sorry for the break.

5857
04:27:47,040 --> 04:27:47,740
So sorry.

5858
04:27:48,260 --> 04:27:49,540
I want to continue the story.

5859
04:27:49,660 --> 04:27:50,280
I want to see what happens.

5860
04:27:50,940 --> 04:27:52,020
But I need brain...

5861
04:27:52,020 --> 04:27:53,200
I need fuel for my...

5862
04:27:53,900 --> 04:27:54,900
For my mushy brain.

5863
04:27:57,140 --> 04:27:57,500
Okay.

5864
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:00,260
Hmm...

5865
04:28:05,080 --> 04:28:06,960
Sorry, I won't be able to voice act this part, I think.

5866
04:28:07,400 --> 04:28:08,180
We're missing in.

5867
04:28:08,660 --> 04:28:09,260
I'm sorry.

5868
04:28:12,800 --> 04:28:14,200
If you're so sorry, then put it down.

5869
04:28:14,740 --> 04:28:16,180
I mean, I won't be able to voice act this.

5870
04:28:16,780 --> 04:28:17,700
Just reads it anyway.

5871
04:28:17,700 --> 04:28:18,700
All right.

5872
04:28:21,760 --> 04:28:22,180
Now, missile.

5873
04:28:27,000 --> 04:28:28,640
I was really out of my head that day.

5874
04:28:29,460 --> 04:28:31,000
We can talk about all this later.

5875
04:28:31,660 --> 04:28:33,660
The Temsec meteorite is going to fall very soon.

5876
04:28:33,840 --> 04:28:36,840
Before that happens, I have to think of a way to do something about that fragment.

5877
04:28:39,140 --> 04:28:41,020
And I'll do everything I can to help too.

5878
04:28:42,360 --> 04:28:42,760
Okay.

5879
04:28:46,220 --> 04:28:49,080
We really don't have very many places we can go.

5880
04:28:50,080 --> 04:28:50,480
Okay.

5881
04:28:53,420 --> 04:28:53,980
Let's...

5882
04:28:53,980 --> 04:28:55,720
Let's have some more time pass.

5883
04:28:55,920 --> 04:28:56,520
Look at the cat.

5884
04:28:59,500 --> 04:29:00,840
Time is passing.

5885
04:29:03,320 --> 04:29:04,800
Oh, so cute.

5886
04:29:15,480 --> 04:29:17,020
Nothing else happens.

5887
04:29:23,440 --> 04:29:25,580
It's about time for that meteorite to come down.

5888
04:29:26,180 --> 04:29:26,880
Uh-oh.

5889
04:29:26,980 --> 04:29:27,900
We have to change the direction.

5890
04:29:27,920 --> 04:29:28,940
We have to change the fragment's path somehow.

5891
04:29:29,860 --> 04:29:34,120
Looks like both paths and fates can be difficult things to change.

5892
04:29:35,600 --> 04:29:36,900
There has to be a way.

5893
04:29:37,160 --> 04:29:40,420
If we work together, you and me, I thought we'd be able to do something.

5894
04:29:40,940 --> 04:29:41,440
Thought?

5895
04:29:41,640 --> 04:29:42,320
That's funny.

5896
04:29:42,480 --> 04:29:44,200
I wonder why he's using past tense.

5897
04:29:49,860 --> 04:29:50,860
So cute.

5898
04:29:52,600 --> 04:29:53,940
Kind of reminds me...

5899
04:29:53,940 --> 04:29:54,940
It reminds me of Paz.

5900
04:29:56,640 --> 04:29:57,140
My

5901
04:30:07,540 --> 04:30:07,540
turn.

5902
04:30:08,160 --> 04:30:08,300
Okay.

5903
04:30:08,300 --> 04:30:09,100
Let's redo it.

5904
04:30:12,060 --> 04:30:13,640
So this is the start of it all, huh?

5905
04:30:13,880 --> 04:30:17,640
If we can change Rukyomiya's fate, what will happen to everything else, I wonder?

5906
04:30:18,220 --> 04:30:20,320
It won't do us any good to think about that now.

5907
04:30:20,880 --> 04:30:21,300
Right.

5908
04:30:21,560 --> 04:30:23,820
We just have to take that first step forward.

5909
04:30:23,980 --> 04:30:24,920
Just as we always do.

5910
04:30:27,320 --> 04:30:27,740
Rewind!

5911
04:30:28,440 --> 04:30:28,860
Rewind!

5912
04:30:34,360 --> 04:30:34,780
Oh...

5913
04:30:37,080 --> 04:30:37,500
Okay.

5914
04:30:37,860 --> 04:30:38,280
Okay.

5915
04:30:39,640 --> 04:30:42,640
I can't reach until he grabs her.

5916
04:30:44,040 --> 04:30:45,960
Why can't we switch around?

5917
04:31:00,360 --> 04:31:02,320
Is the basket and the...

5918
04:31:04,580 --> 04:31:09,860
Are the basket and the sweet potato, when she grabs them, are they the same shape?

5919
04:31:10,040 --> 04:31:10,380
Let's see.

5920
04:31:13,700 --> 04:31:15,420
Do they count as the same shape?

5921
04:31:26,600 --> 04:31:27,200
Hehehe.

5922
04:31:27,200 --> 04:31:29,840
This cat just walks up.

5923
04:31:30,400 --> 04:31:31,200
So funny.

5924
04:31:32,620 --> 04:31:33,860
Oh, no it doesn't.

5925
04:31:37,760 --> 04:31:40,560
Oh man, I already missed my opportunity, maybe.

5926
04:31:53,000 --> 04:31:54,440
We can examine the sweep...

5927
04:31:54,440 --> 04:31:54,560
Oh!

5928
04:31:54,700 --> 04:31:55,700
We can turn off the headphones!

5929
04:31:56,000 --> 04:31:56,960
Oh, I didn't realize that.

5930
04:31:58,820 --> 04:32:00,420
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

5931
04:32:01,040 --> 04:32:01,800
What are you doing?

5932
04:32:01,860 --> 04:32:03,520
You're going to hurt poor Miss Lin's ears!

5933
04:32:04,420 --> 04:32:05,780
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

5934
04:32:06,120 --> 04:32:07,300
You really startled her.

5935
04:32:08,180 --> 04:32:09,960
You could have made her drop her sweet potato.

5936
04:32:10,800 --> 04:32:11,540
I know...

5937
04:32:12,020 --> 04:32:14,680
I know how much this girl loves her food too.

5938
04:32:15,180 --> 04:32:18,340
Anyway, at least her fate has been changed, albeit ever so slightly.

5939
04:32:21,340 --> 04:32:22,860
Okay, I'm going ghost.

5940
04:32:23,220 --> 04:32:24,640
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

5941
04:32:25,640 --> 04:32:27,400
We're going to have you go all the way...

5942
04:32:28,180 --> 04:32:28,880
Not there.

5943
04:32:29,580 --> 04:32:30,140
Oh, wait!

5944
04:32:31,180 --> 04:32:32,680
We have to go from here to there.

5945
04:32:32,680 --> 04:32:33,080
There we go.

5946
04:32:33,180 --> 04:32:33,500
Okay.

5947
04:32:35,100 --> 04:32:36,440
We can rock the basket.

5948
04:32:36,800 --> 04:32:38,060
We can spray the nozzle.

5949
04:32:38,220 --> 04:32:39,240
Okay, I was thinking that.

5950
04:32:39,820 --> 04:32:40,200
Spray...

5951
04:32:48,170 --> 04:32:50,070
Can I switch the nozzles?

5952
04:32:53,910 --> 04:32:54,790
Oh, I can't reach.

5953
04:32:55,530 --> 04:32:58,830
I was going to say, if I could switch the nozzles, maybe one will be...

5954
04:32:58,830 --> 04:33:00,630
He could like spray Cecil, you know?

5955
04:33:02,430 --> 04:33:02,810
Alright!

5956
04:33:03,110 --> 04:33:03,830
Thank you!

5957
04:33:05,850 --> 04:33:06,230
Yuki...

5958
04:33:06,230 --> 04:33:08,050
Oh gosh, I didn't see the other name.

5959
04:33:08,090 --> 04:33:08,570
I'm so sorry.

5960
04:33:08,570 --> 04:33:10,170
YouTube is really stupid right now.

5961
04:33:11,050 --> 04:33:15,710
And all raids come in a white text on white background, so I can't read them.

5962
04:33:16,250 --> 04:33:17,030
Thank you!

5963
04:33:18,290 --> 04:33:19,930
Thank you so much for the raid!

5964
04:33:23,820 --> 04:33:25,180
Oh, Yuki and Yuna!

5965
04:33:25,420 --> 04:33:26,160
Thank you!

5966
04:33:28,420 --> 04:33:31,660
Right now, I'm in the final chapter of this game.

5967
04:33:31,900 --> 04:33:34,260
So, kind of major spoilers, but...

5968
04:33:34,260 --> 04:33:36,340
You're welcome.

5969
04:33:36,340 --> 04:33:36,540
You're welcome.

5970
04:33:38,160 --> 04:33:38,500
You're welcome.

5971
04:33:38,520 --> 04:33:39,060
You're welcome.

5972
04:33:39,060 --> 04:33:39,320
You're welcome.

5973
04:33:39,320 --> 04:33:39,380
You're welcome.

5974
04:33:44,310 --> 04:33:44,650
You're welcome.

5975
04:33:44,650 --> 04:33:44,990
Let's see.

5976
04:33:46,750 --> 04:33:48,050
Come here, everything's for the gifted!

5977
04:33:48,730 --> 04:33:49,810
Let's rock this I guess.

5978
04:33:49,850 --> 04:33:50,590
Let's see what happens here.

5979
04:33:51,590 --> 04:33:52,290
Rock the boat.

5980
04:33:53,970 --> 04:33:54,310
Oh!

5981
04:33:54,750 --> 04:33:55,850
Oh, and we shoot it up!

5982
04:33:56,270 --> 04:33:56,610
Um...

5983
04:33:56,610 --> 04:33:57,210
Ghost!

5984
04:33:57,430 --> 04:33:57,530
Ghost!

5985
04:33:57,550 --> 04:33:57,770
Oh!

5986
04:33:57,770 --> 04:33:58,110
Oops!

5987
04:33:58,210 --> 04:33:59,290
Wait, I pressed the wrong button.

5988
04:34:00,290 --> 04:34:01,150
What did I just press?

5989
04:34:01,250 --> 04:34:01,450
Oh!

5990
04:34:01,550 --> 04:34:01,890
Okay!

5991
04:34:01,990 --> 04:34:02,610
That scared me.

5992
04:34:03,410 --> 04:34:04,110
Heart on your blade!

5993
04:34:04,210 --> 04:34:05,070
Thank you for the five gifted!

5994
04:34:05,730 --> 04:34:06,870
Shopkeeper, thank you for the five gifted!

5995
04:34:06,870 --> 04:34:07,550
I said thank you guys!

5996
04:34:07,870 --> 04:34:08,190
Okay.

5997
04:34:08,570 --> 04:34:09,750
Here we go.

5998
04:34:10,430 --> 04:34:11,290
And shoot!

5999
04:34:11,890 --> 04:34:12,370
Oh.

6000
04:34:12,990 --> 04:34:13,650
Uh oh.

6001
04:34:14,050 --> 04:34:15,550
Wait, I think I missed my opportunity.

6002
04:34:17,250 --> 04:34:18,410
That was kind of disappointing.

6003
04:34:18,830 --> 04:34:20,250
Maybe the timing was a little off.

6004
04:34:22,750 --> 04:34:24,030
I better try it again.

6005
04:34:27,050 --> 04:34:27,850
How do I...

6006
04:34:29,210 --> 04:34:30,530
Get it back over here though?

6007
04:34:32,350 --> 04:34:32,830
Oh!

6008
04:34:35,170 --> 04:34:36,250
I had it!

6009
04:34:36,870 --> 04:34:37,530
I didn't have it!

6010
04:34:38,150 --> 04:34:38,590
Okay.

6011
04:34:38,650 --> 04:34:39,490
Let's just restart.

6012
04:34:40,390 --> 04:34:41,390
After the fight change.

6013
04:34:41,610 --> 04:34:41,850
Okay.

6014
04:34:43,710 --> 04:34:44,150
Okay.

6015
04:34:44,230 --> 04:34:44,450
Okay.

6016
04:34:44,450 --> 04:34:44,710
Okay.

6017
04:34:45,630 --> 04:34:46,990
We have one chance.

6018
04:34:58,240 --> 04:34:59,300
Rock the boat.

6019
04:35:00,520 --> 04:35:01,640
And then go to here.

6020
04:35:02,400 --> 04:35:03,340
And then back.

6021
04:35:04,080 --> 04:35:04,680
And then...

6022
04:35:04,680 --> 04:35:05,000
Oh my god!

6023
04:35:05,020 --> 04:35:05,700
I can't see it!

6024
04:35:05,800 --> 04:35:06,100
Okay.

6025
04:35:08,760 --> 04:35:09,500
Go, ghost!

6026
04:35:11,540 --> 04:35:11,980
No!

6027
04:35:11,980 --> 04:35:12,200
Nice!

6028
04:35:12,340 --> 04:35:12,800
Oh!

6029
04:35:12,820 --> 04:35:13,240
Okay.

6030
04:35:13,840 --> 04:35:15,320
Look at that sweet potato!

6031
04:35:19,320 --> 04:35:21,200
That big scary sweet...

6032
04:35:21,200 --> 04:35:23,120
That big scary sweet potato!

6033
04:35:24,460 --> 04:35:25,880
That's not a sweet potato missile.

6034
04:35:25,900 --> 04:35:26,800
That's Minto!

6035
04:35:28,900 --> 04:35:30,300
You guys, I'm a sweet potato.

6036
04:35:33,780 --> 04:35:35,280
I can't believe I'm in the game.

6037
04:35:43,430 --> 04:35:44,110
All right.

6038
04:35:44,210 --> 04:35:44,810
Of course.

6039
04:35:48,170 --> 04:35:49,130
But look at them.

6040
04:35:49,130 --> 04:35:50,030
The potato and Minto.

6041
04:35:50,490 --> 04:35:52,150
Right now, they both have the same shape.

6042
04:35:52,950 --> 04:35:54,690
So you're saying you could swap them, huh?

6043
04:35:54,810 --> 04:35:55,730
Good idea, missile.

6044
04:35:57,370 --> 04:35:58,090
Here I go.

6045
04:35:58,310 --> 04:35:59,710
And I'm gonna need your help.

6046
04:36:00,690 --> 04:36:01,410
My help?

6047
04:36:02,770 --> 04:36:03,530
My help?

6048
04:36:03,670 --> 04:36:04,050
My help?

6049
04:36:04,210 --> 04:36:04,510
My help?

6050
04:36:05,990 --> 04:36:06,890
Oh, spray higher.

6051
04:36:07,930 --> 04:36:08,370
Pew!

6052
04:36:13,600 --> 04:36:14,300
Wait a second.

6053
04:36:16,180 --> 04:36:16,940
No, no.

6054
04:36:16,960 --> 04:36:17,160
Wait.

6055
04:36:18,140 --> 04:36:18,840
Wait, wait, wait.

6056
04:36:19,840 --> 04:36:20,280
Wait.

6057
04:36:20,500 --> 04:36:20,940
Wait.

6058
04:36:22,340 --> 04:36:23,180
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6059
04:36:23,280 --> 04:36:23,960
Oh, wait, wait.

6060
04:36:24,140 --> 04:36:24,400
Oh.

6061
04:36:25,180 --> 04:36:26,020
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6062
04:36:26,820 --> 04:36:27,160
Oh.

6063
04:36:28,560 --> 04:36:28,900
Oh.

6064
04:36:29,780 --> 04:36:30,120
Oh.

6065
04:36:30,860 --> 04:36:31,660
Wait, wait, wait.

6066
04:36:32,000 --> 04:36:32,340
Oh.

6067
04:36:32,540 --> 04:36:33,160
Oh, wait.

6068
04:36:33,720 --> 04:36:34,240
Oh, no.

6069
04:36:37,080 --> 04:36:37,720
Oh, wait.

6070
04:36:43,440 --> 04:36:43,780
Okay.

6071
04:36:44,080 --> 04:36:44,980
That's all I can do.

6072
04:36:48,360 --> 04:36:49,040
I can't...

6073
04:36:50,340 --> 04:36:50,680
Um...

6074
04:36:56,860 --> 04:36:57,720
I had it.

6075
04:36:57,760 --> 04:36:58,780
What do you mean I had it?

6076
04:37:02,560 --> 04:37:03,840
What do you mean I had it?

6077
04:37:30,500 --> 04:37:30,820
Oh.

6078
04:37:32,100 --> 04:37:32,420
Oh.

6079
04:37:34,560 --> 04:37:34,880
Oh.

6080
04:37:34,900 --> 04:37:35,220
Okay.

6081
04:37:38,340 --> 04:37:38,900
Oh, wait.

6082
04:37:39,000 --> 04:37:39,320
Hold on.

6083
04:37:41,900 --> 04:37:42,660
But why do I...

6084
04:37:42,660 --> 04:37:43,280
Oh, wait.

6085
04:37:43,320 --> 04:37:43,540
Hold on.

6086
04:37:43,580 --> 04:37:44,360
Can I reach it now?

6087
04:37:45,220 --> 04:37:45,540
No.

6088
04:37:48,320 --> 04:37:49,420
Can I reach it from here?

6089
04:37:50,240 --> 04:37:50,560
No.

6090
04:37:50,960 --> 04:37:51,280
Okay.

6091
04:37:51,340 --> 04:37:51,660
Okay.

6092
04:37:54,180 --> 04:37:54,660
Okay.

6093
04:37:58,020 --> 04:37:58,980
Good boy.

6094
04:37:59,080 --> 04:37:59,560
Okay.

6095
04:38:02,980 --> 04:38:04,660
I need you to move, sisso.

6096
04:38:05,780 --> 04:38:06,980
You're in my way.

6097
04:38:07,880 --> 04:38:09,620
You're in my way, sisso.

6098
04:38:11,300 --> 04:38:12,340
You're in my way.

6099
04:38:20,010 --> 04:38:21,070
It's right there.

6100
04:38:21,110 --> 04:38:21,710
Come on.

6101
04:38:21,790 --> 04:38:22,530
Hey, hey, hey.

6102
04:38:22,610 --> 04:38:23,750
Don't be mean about it, okay?

6103
04:38:23,750 --> 04:38:28,970
Okay, just because I get something not as quickly as you do, doesn't mean you have to be mean about it.

6104
04:38:49,170 --> 04:38:49,870
Oh my god.

6105
04:38:49,970 --> 04:38:51,830
I need you to raise it again.

6106
04:38:53,110 --> 04:38:53,990
Raise the roof!

6107
04:38:59,160 --> 04:38:59,820
There we go.

6108
04:38:59,980 --> 04:39:00,360
Maybe.

6109
04:39:01,780 --> 04:39:02,400
I guess.

6110
04:39:08,850 --> 04:39:10,430
That was quite a sight to see.

6111
04:39:12,110 --> 04:39:14,910
It looks like this park just got a new feature.

6112
04:39:17,250 --> 04:39:19,770
But neither one of them even glanced this way!

6113
04:39:21,130 --> 04:39:24,930
I guess that's not surprising, seeing as even a meteorite didn't distract them.

6114
04:39:28,830 --> 04:39:31,010
Hey, it was a desperate situation.

6115
04:39:31,310 --> 04:39:32,090
Kill or be killed.

6116
04:39:33,050 --> 04:39:36,870
And Yeomiel is killed right after this, by the meteorite.

6117
04:39:37,250 --> 04:39:40,310
Well, now that the park has a new feature, we can use it to...

6118
04:39:40,310 --> 04:39:42,550
To our own advantage in any...

6119
04:39:42,550 --> 04:39:44,970
Or can we use it to our own advantage in any way?

6120
04:39:46,230 --> 04:39:46,750
Okay.

6121
04:39:47,470 --> 04:39:48,670
Cleared the first...

6122
04:39:49,170 --> 04:39:50,870
Wait, wait, wait!

6123
04:40:11,290 --> 04:40:12,770
What can you do?

6124
04:40:13,390 --> 04:40:14,610
Spray any high or...

6125
04:40:14,610 --> 04:40:15,790
You're literally stuck.

6126
04:40:16,510 --> 04:40:18,110
Okay, Cecil is stuck.

6127
04:40:19,450 --> 04:40:19,950
Stuckle.

6128
04:40:31,060 --> 04:40:32,280
Yeah, let's try the water.

6129
04:40:32,340 --> 04:40:33,180
Just a tiny bit.

6130
04:40:34,680 --> 04:40:35,540
There's no use.

6131
04:40:35,580 --> 04:40:37,080
I can't get any water to come out.

6132
04:40:39,240 --> 04:40:40,620
Well, we can see why not.

6133
04:40:41,160 --> 04:40:43,940
Yeah, the overwhelming presence of Minto.

6134
04:40:45,140 --> 04:40:47,140
If only we could use it to our advantage somehow.

6135
04:40:47,940 --> 04:40:49,700
How can we use it to our...

6136
04:40:53,380 --> 04:40:54,220
Um...

6137
04:40:54,220 --> 04:40:56,940
Is there anything that I can...

6138
04:40:58,960 --> 04:41:00,800
Anything that I can...

6139
04:41:07,120 --> 04:41:10,220
What can I do with it?

6140
04:41:10,360 --> 04:41:12,280
With it...

6141
04:41:12,460 --> 04:41:13,020
Oh, wait!

6142
04:41:13,660 --> 04:41:15,040
Post lantern.

6143
04:41:18,380 --> 04:41:19,220
Um...

6144
04:41:29,400 --> 04:41:29,860
Hmm...

6145
04:41:33,420 --> 04:41:33,880
Hmm...

6146
04:41:46,370 --> 04:41:47,670
There's one more core...

6147
04:41:47,670 --> 04:41:48,010
There is?

6148
04:41:52,150 --> 04:41:52,810
Over here?

6149
04:41:52,970 --> 04:41:53,250
No.

6150
04:41:54,530 --> 04:41:55,710
I don't know.

6151
04:41:55,950 --> 04:41:56,990
I'm trying to figure it out.

6152
04:41:57,490 --> 04:41:59,450
I'm just going everywhere, I'm just...

6153
04:42:00,590 --> 04:42:01,990
Use it to our advantage.

6154
04:42:02,970 --> 04:42:04,430
Use it to our advantage.

6155
04:42:04,610 --> 04:42:06,030
Use it to our advantage that no water is coming out.

6156
04:42:08,710 --> 04:42:09,790
Use it to our advantage.

6157
04:42:16,690 --> 04:42:18,850
I'm only glancing at chat sometimes.

6158
04:42:19,010 --> 04:42:22,110
Even if people are giving answers, I'm most likely not seeing it.

6159
04:42:22,750 --> 04:42:25,070
You guys can be like, stop back-seating!

6160
04:42:25,510 --> 04:42:27,290
But it's okay, I'm not watching.

6161
04:42:27,390 --> 04:42:28,350
I'm not looking at it either.

6162
04:42:30,430 --> 04:42:33,110
I'm not really seeing anyone telling me what to do either.

6163
04:42:43,350 --> 04:42:44,370
Oh, here we go.

6164
04:42:53,080 --> 04:42:55,140
I guess we'll just play it out and see what happens.

6165
04:43:14,070 --> 04:43:16,350
I doubt we can move those two from that spot.

6166
04:43:17,350 --> 04:43:20,470
Which means we have to do something with the Temsik fragment instead.

6167
04:43:21,970 --> 04:43:24,770
That should be easy with our pow- What do you mean with the fragment, huh?

6168
04:43:27,550 --> 04:43:28,570
I think you're right, Missile.

6169
04:43:28,670 --> 04:43:31,270
This is going to be the grand finale.

6170
04:43:36,830 --> 04:43:38,370
Do something with the fragment?

6171
04:43:42,940 --> 04:43:44,300
Do something with the fragment?

6172
04:43:47,820 --> 04:43:49,880
Oh my gosh, I forgot it was from all the way back here.

6173
04:43:54,670 --> 04:43:55,130
Rock!

6174
04:43:59,220 --> 04:44:00,860
Oh my gosh, I can't see it.

6175
04:44:01,980 --> 04:44:02,440
Spray!

6176
04:44:08,960 --> 04:44:10,480
Yeah, and that's there.

6177
04:44:12,420 --> 04:44:14,740
And then, spray higher.

6178
04:44:15,860 --> 04:44:16,440
Oh wait.

6179
04:44:17,220 --> 04:44:18,080
Can I reach it?

6180
04:44:18,140 --> 04:44:18,280
Yeah.

6181
04:44:19,420 --> 04:44:20,080
Like that.

6182
04:44:22,700 --> 04:44:25,040
And then we go back about here.

6183
04:44:26,900 --> 04:44:28,580
Can I go down just a little bit?

6184
04:44:29,140 --> 04:44:29,840
Right there?

6185
04:44:30,480 --> 04:44:31,380
Oh, so close!

6186
04:44:31,740 --> 04:44:32,960
Wait, can I reach it from here?

6187
04:44:33,940 --> 04:44:34,920
Oh, so close!

6188
04:44:37,380 --> 04:44:38,780
Okay, just a little bit higher.

6189
04:44:44,220 --> 04:44:44,620
Spray?

6190
04:44:45,080 --> 04:44:45,780
Spray, please?

6191
04:44:48,260 --> 04:44:49,140
Wait, oh wait.

6192
04:44:49,260 --> 04:44:50,100
Oh no, no, wait.

6193
04:44:50,100 --> 04:44:53,300
I forgot that I need to do it from down here.

6194
04:44:55,120 --> 04:44:59,500
Oh my gosh, it's the timing of it.

6195
04:45:06,220 --> 04:45:06,940
Maybe here?

6196
04:45:07,600 --> 04:45:08,000
Reach?

6197
04:45:13,000 --> 04:45:13,800
Way overthinking.

6198
04:45:13,800 --> 04:45:14,760
What are you talking about?

6199
04:45:18,180 --> 04:45:18,980
Okay, reach.

6200
04:45:19,180 --> 04:45:19,880
There we go.

6201
04:45:20,080 --> 04:45:21,140
Now I have to do it.

6202
04:45:21,180 --> 04:45:21,380
Okay.

6203
04:45:22,220 --> 04:45:23,440
Now, now, there we go.

6204
04:45:23,680 --> 04:45:24,120
Oh my goodness.

6205
04:45:25,400 --> 04:45:26,840
Oh, spray please.

6206
04:45:27,300 --> 04:45:28,080
There we go.

6207
04:45:28,300 --> 04:45:28,640
Okay.

6208
04:45:29,160 --> 04:45:29,880
I'm good.

6209
04:45:31,500 --> 04:45:31,980
Swap.

6210
04:45:32,880 --> 04:45:33,360
Okay.

6211
04:45:34,820 --> 04:45:35,420
This is

6212
04:45:49,070 --> 04:45:50,270
what I wanted to do from the beginning.

6213
04:45:50,690 --> 04:45:51,990
The lamppost is bending.

6214
04:45:53,210 --> 04:45:54,510
But it hasn't broken yet.

6215
04:45:54,970 --> 04:45:56,890
It really is a wonder it hasn't snapped.

6216
04:45:57,770 --> 04:46:00,130
It just might hold out for a little while longer.

6217
04:46:00,510 --> 04:46:04,630
If I recall, the Temsik fragment smashed through the glass lantern on its way down.

6218
04:46:05,290 --> 04:46:05,770
Hmm.

6219
04:46:07,750 --> 04:46:12,590
But if Mino sits firmly in its way, then fate should...

6220
04:46:12,590 --> 04:46:13,330
Oh, goodbye, Lin.

6221
04:46:15,810 --> 04:46:16,730
Goodbye, Lin.

6222
04:46:19,550 --> 04:46:21,330
Is there anything else I can do here?

6223
04:46:21,950 --> 04:46:22,810
I think...

6224
04:46:24,790 --> 04:46:26,110
I think this is it.

6225
04:46:36,630 --> 04:46:38,270
There, how's that?

6226
04:46:39,250 --> 04:46:40,590
Look, the fragment's course.

6227
04:46:40,730 --> 04:46:41,730
It changed a little.

6228
04:46:42,350 --> 04:46:44,410
Now Yomiel's fate should really change.

6229
04:46:45,230 --> 04:46:45,930
Wait a minute.

6230
04:46:46,370 --> 04:46:48,110
Take another look at the fragment's trajectory.

6231
04:46:48,590 --> 04:46:49,010
Uh-oh.

6232
04:46:49,070 --> 04:46:50,870
Now that it's changed, what's in its path?

6233
04:46:51,670 --> 04:46:52,550
In its path?

6234
04:46:53,430 --> 04:46:53,870
No!

6235
04:46:54,870 --> 04:46:55,470
It only

6236
04:47:04,330 --> 04:47:05,250
got hit in the leg, though.

6237
04:47:06,170 --> 04:47:07,990
The Temsik fragment shot through his leg.

6238
04:47:08,090 --> 04:47:08,430
It's okay.

6239
04:47:08,510 --> 04:47:09,290
It's only his leg.

6240
04:47:10,030 --> 04:47:10,470
What?

6241
04:47:11,790 --> 04:47:13,970
But the cruel twist of fate weren't over yet.

6242
04:47:14,250 --> 04:47:15,210
Oh, what do you mean by that?

6243
04:47:16,910 --> 04:47:17,350
Um...

6244
04:47:18,170 --> 04:47:19,430
Come on, put it down.

6245
04:47:19,430 --> 04:47:20,390
Huh?

6246
04:47:20,850 --> 04:47:22,390
Jao, put the gun down now!

6247
04:47:22,730 --> 04:47:24,750
If you don't, you're going to shoot him!

6248
04:47:25,890 --> 04:47:28,850
I don't know if it's his detective training or what.

6249
04:47:29,190 --> 04:47:32,290
But even though he's shaking from the pain, the gun doesn't waver.

6250
04:47:34,090 --> 04:47:35,350
Put the gun down!

6251
04:47:37,850 --> 04:47:38,330
No!

6252
04:47:38,570 --> 04:47:39,210
Oh my god.

6253
04:47:39,730 --> 04:47:40,550
I knew it.

6254
04:47:40,630 --> 04:47:41,930
This is my true fate.

6255
04:47:42,190 --> 04:47:45,310
In the end, I stole his life away with my own hands.

6256
04:47:45,770 --> 04:47:46,610
Or you missed.

6257
04:47:50,290 --> 04:47:50,890
Let's go!

6258
04:47:51,090 --> 04:47:52,230
I won't let that happen!

6259
04:47:52,910 --> 04:47:53,350
Missile!

6260
04:47:53,510 --> 04:47:54,650
But the bullet stopped...

6261
04:47:54,650 --> 04:47:55,630
It stopped in mid-air!

6262
04:47:56,010 --> 04:47:57,550
I'm here inside the bullet!

6263
04:47:57,790 --> 04:47:59,350
Now let's swap it with something.

6264
04:48:00,270 --> 04:48:00,750
What?

6265
04:48:00,930 --> 04:48:01,690
With what?

6266
04:48:02,250 --> 04:48:03,070
Detective Jao.

6267
04:48:03,190 --> 04:48:06,030
The meteorite fragment is what made you pull the trigger.

6268
04:48:06,290 --> 04:48:07,950
We won't let you become a matee...

6269
04:48:07,950 --> 04:48:08,570
A meteor?

6270
04:48:17,320 --> 04:48:19,380
We won't let you become a...

6271
04:48:26,070 --> 04:48:26,770
Mm-hmm.

6272
04:48:29,110 --> 04:48:31,870
We have to prove that murder isn't the detective's true fate.

6273
04:48:32,130 --> 04:48:34,110
To do that, we have to stop this bullet.

6274
04:48:34,410 --> 04:48:36,870
There must be something with the same shape as the bullet around here.

6275
04:48:40,880 --> 04:48:41,620
Eat that!

6276
04:48:42,280 --> 04:48:42,760
Sorry,

6277
04:48:46,750 --> 04:48:47,750
that was really loud.

6278
04:48:48,050 --> 04:48:48,850
Oh my god!

6279
04:48:51,150 --> 04:48:52,410
We stopped the bullet.

6280
04:48:53,150 --> 04:48:54,770
But we still couldn't save him.

6281
04:48:55,730 --> 04:48:56,630
That's not true.

6282
04:48:56,630 --> 04:49:01,570
My fate of getting pierced through the back might not have changed.

6283
04:49:02,570 --> 04:49:03,730
But I'm still alive.

6284
04:49:04,850 --> 04:49:05,250
What?

6285
04:49:06,310 --> 04:49:07,090
I'm not dead.

6286
04:49:07,130 --> 04:49:07,790
I'm just unconscious.

6287
04:49:08,590 --> 04:49:09,730
I mean, for now.

6288
04:49:11,230 --> 04:49:12,890
Okay, so your fate of death has changed.

6289
04:49:12,930 --> 04:49:13,610
But still...

6290
04:49:14,310 --> 04:49:16,770
This fate is just too painful to watch in every sense.

6291
04:49:17,630 --> 04:49:18,550
I don't think so.

6292
04:49:20,730 --> 04:49:22,850
As long as I'm alive, that's good enough for me.

6293
04:49:24,770 --> 04:49:26,510
But we were overlooking one thing.

6294
04:49:26,530 --> 04:49:26,610
We were overlooking...

6295
04:49:27,150 --> 04:49:29,590
The wheel of fate was still slowly turning.

6296
04:49:33,230 --> 04:49:33,730
Wake up!

6297
04:49:39,090 --> 04:49:40,450
You gotta get out of there!

6298
04:49:41,150 --> 04:49:41,930
Oh my god.

6299
04:49:42,070 --> 04:49:42,810
Oh my god!

6300
04:49:44,130 --> 04:49:45,630
Damn it, my leg won't work!

6301
04:49:47,150 --> 04:49:48,230
It's all over!

6302
04:49:48,930 --> 04:49:50,210
We're out of time!

6303
04:49:51,170 --> 04:49:51,970
Miss Lin!

6304
04:49:55,030 --> 04:49:56,250
It's not over yet!

6305
04:49:57,010 --> 04:49:59,150
But there isn't anything else to swap with!

6306
04:50:01,130 --> 04:50:04,150
Why don't we just let it play out and then try to find another way next time?

6307
04:50:04,550 --> 04:50:07,390
Even if she dies, all you have to do is possess her corpse.

6308
04:50:07,770 --> 04:50:10,670
And then you can redo her last four minutes as many times as it takes!

6309
04:50:11,250 --> 04:50:12,110
Wait, that's what I...

6310
04:50:14,170 --> 04:50:15,250
No, I won't do that!

6311
04:50:16,210 --> 04:50:16,750
Why not?

6312
04:50:17,390 --> 04:50:19,150
Sure, the fact of her death would be erased.

6313
04:50:19,350 --> 04:50:22,070
But her memory of it would remain like a scar on her psyche.

6314
04:50:24,150 --> 04:50:25,290
I won't let that happen.

6315
04:50:25,330 --> 04:50:26,190
Not if I can help it.

6316
04:50:27,290 --> 04:50:28,430
But what can we do now?

6317
04:50:28,730 --> 04:50:29,750
Even if we work together?

6318
04:50:34,440 --> 04:50:36,740
I think there might be something that can be done.

6319
04:50:37,860 --> 04:50:38,680
What is it?

6320
04:50:39,000 --> 04:50:40,520
What can Cecil and I do?

6321
04:50:41,460 --> 04:50:42,820
Don't forget, I'm here too.

6322
04:50:43,040 --> 04:50:44,040
We finally...

6323
04:50:44,040 --> 04:50:44,480
Finally!

6324
04:50:47,520 --> 04:50:48,280
Oh wow.

6325
04:50:48,580 --> 04:50:51,600
You know, you could have helped out at any point in the past.

6326
04:50:56,140 --> 04:50:58,440
With three kinds of powers among us...

6327
04:50:58,440 --> 04:50:58,940
Among us?

6328
04:51:00,300 --> 04:51:02,720
We ought to be able to fight this battle.

6329
04:51:04,040 --> 04:51:06,260
This battle against the fate of death!

6330
04:51:08,200 --> 04:51:08,720
Yomiya!

6331
04:51:10,060 --> 04:51:12,820
Cecil, your power is manipulating objects.

6332
04:51:14,420 --> 04:51:16,540
Use your power to manipulate this!

6333
04:51:17,520 --> 04:51:18,040
Huh?

6334
04:51:18,120 --> 04:51:18,900
I don't get it.

6335
04:51:19,160 --> 04:51:20,140
Just trust me.

6336
04:51:20,220 --> 04:51:20,840
Just go!

6337
04:51:21,540 --> 04:51:23,060
Alright, I'll try to move there.

6338
04:51:25,620 --> 04:51:27,940
Now gather your strength and make it spray...

6339
04:51:27,940 --> 04:51:29,940
as if your life depended on it!

6340
04:51:31,340 --> 04:51:32,240
I'm dead though.

6341
04:51:32,940 --> 04:51:34,620
He's just like me, for real, for real.

6342
04:51:35,560 --> 04:51:36,700
In that case...

6343
04:51:36,700 --> 04:51:39,660
Make it spray as if your death depended on it!

6344
04:51:39,800 --> 04:51:40,820
Give it your all!

6345
04:51:41,140 --> 04:51:42,160
And remember...

6346
04:51:42,160 --> 04:51:43,620
You only have a split second.

6347
04:51:45,040 --> 04:51:46,040
Okay, now do it!

6348
04:51:46,640 --> 04:51:47,220
Got it!

6349
04:51:50,240 --> 04:51:50,680
Okay...

6350
04:51:50,680 --> 04:51:51,300
Okay...

6351
04:51:51,300 --> 04:51:51,980
Oh!

6352
04:51:53,580 --> 04:51:54,900
Now it's your turn, Missile!

6353
04:51:55,660 --> 04:51:56,100
What?

6354
04:51:56,500 --> 04:51:56,860
Me?

6355
04:51:56,960 --> 04:51:57,640
But what can I do?

6356
04:51:58,420 --> 04:52:00,000
I think you know an answer to that.

6357
04:52:01,420 --> 04:52:02,220
Okay, got it!

6358
04:52:03,520 --> 04:52:04,520
You can swap them!

6359
04:52:04,820 --> 04:52:07,440
That hunk of concrete will go back to its original position!

6360
04:52:08,360 --> 04:52:09,040
Wait, but...

6361
04:52:09,040 --> 04:52:10,760
It's still going to be flying through the air.

6362
04:52:13,340 --> 04:52:14,860
Wait, I don't think you thought this through.

6363
04:52:16,600 --> 04:52:16,960
But...

6364
04:52:16,960 --> 04:52:19,520
Even if I swap them, it's still going to be right above Miss Lin!

6365
04:52:19,620 --> 04:52:19,860
Yeah!

6366
04:52:20,840 --> 04:52:21,400
Don't worry.

6367
04:52:22,740 --> 04:52:23,580
Okay, I'll do it!

6368
04:52:23,580 --> 04:52:24,100
I'll swap them!

6369
04:52:29,310 --> 04:52:29,770
Okay...

6370
04:52:32,370 --> 04:52:33,210
It's no use!

6371
04:52:33,310 --> 04:52:35,050
We can't stop that horrible Mino!

6372
04:52:36,410 --> 04:52:37,450
What can we do now?

6373
04:52:37,750 --> 04:52:40,490
I don't see how gaining a second or two helped.

6374
04:52:41,130 --> 04:52:42,350
Oh, it helped, all right.

6375
04:52:42,530 --> 04:52:44,850
Those few seconds were exactly what I wanted.

6376
04:52:46,890 --> 04:52:48,210
Last up, it's my turn.

6377
04:52:49,290 --> 04:52:49,990
Your turn?

6378
04:52:53,130 --> 04:52:53,590
Him.

6379
04:52:55,310 --> 04:52:57,010
You know what my power is, right?

6380
04:52:57,010 --> 04:52:57,210
That's right.

6381
04:52:57,210 --> 04:52:59,170
I can manipulate living creatures.

6382
04:52:59,890 --> 04:53:01,270
Wait a minute, you mean...

6383
04:53:01,890 --> 04:53:02,230
That's right.

6384
04:53:02,590 --> 04:53:04,310
I'm going to save that little girl.

6385
04:53:04,610 --> 04:53:07,390
Save her by manipulating my own unconscious body.

6386
04:53:36,480 --> 04:53:37,860
Penny redeemed himself.

6387
04:53:38,300 --> 04:53:38,960
Oh my god.

6388
04:53:40,940 --> 04:53:41,760
You're awake.

6389
04:53:50,190 --> 04:53:51,610
Mister, is your knee okay?

6390
04:53:55,310 --> 04:53:56,690
Oh, it'll be fine.

6391
04:53:56,830 --> 04:53:57,830
It's just a scrape.

6392
04:53:59,290 --> 04:54:00,850
I'm lucky it wasn't a fatal hit.

6393
04:54:01,150 --> 04:54:03,730
But the main thing is that you're not hurt.

6394
04:54:06,430 --> 04:54:07,770
You saved me, Mister.

6395
04:54:09,030 --> 04:54:10,470
I was just doing my job.

6396
04:54:11,770 --> 04:54:14,110
The gods, they're the ones who saved you.

6397
04:54:15,450 --> 04:54:16,570
What's your job, Mister?

6398
04:54:17,610 --> 04:54:18,790
I'm a police detective.

6399
04:54:23,560 --> 04:54:24,500
Do you think you can save me?

6400
04:54:24,520 --> 04:54:25,740
Do you think you could go call the police for me?

6401
04:54:26,540 --> 04:54:28,640
I think you could do it quicker than I could.

6402
04:54:30,320 --> 04:54:30,800
But...

6403
04:54:35,290 --> 04:54:35,870
What's that?

6404
04:54:36,930 --> 04:54:38,390
This is a detective's badge.

6405
04:54:38,590 --> 04:54:40,410
We give them to children who've been very brave.

6406
04:54:41,650 --> 04:54:42,970
A detective's badge?

6407
04:54:43,150 --> 04:54:43,330
Aww.

6408
04:54:45,930 --> 04:54:46,410
No!

6409
04:54:46,510 --> 04:54:47,390
So cute!

6410
04:54:49,570 --> 04:54:50,050
Thanks!

6411
04:54:51,630 --> 04:54:53,150
You know what to do, little detective.

6412
04:55:06,100 --> 04:55:06,980
Are you alive?

6413
04:55:08,960 --> 04:55:10,000
Yeah, sadly.

6414
04:55:10,840 --> 04:55:12,040
He's still alive!

6415
04:55:12,500 --> 04:55:13,740
I thought it was a lollipop, too.

6416
04:55:14,280 --> 04:55:14,960
Hang on.

6417
04:55:15,080 --> 04:55:15,720
Help is coming.

6418
04:55:16,220 --> 04:55:18,920
What made you do such a reckless thing?

6419
04:55:21,840 --> 04:55:23,880
To be perfectly honest, I don't really know.

6420
04:55:23,980 --> 04:55:25,120
They all don't remember.

6421
04:55:25,460 --> 04:55:27,520
We basically went back in time entirely.

6422
04:55:29,160 --> 04:55:31,900
When I came to, my body was already moving by itself.

6423
04:55:32,620 --> 04:55:35,640
As if... It was as if somebody else was controlling me.

6424
04:55:36,780 --> 04:55:37,540
I see.

6425
04:55:38,660 --> 04:55:39,620
But you know...

6426
04:55:40,180 --> 04:55:41,320
I'm glad it happened.

6427
04:56:07,170 --> 04:56:09,290
I found this kitten that was over there.

6428
04:56:10,470 --> 04:56:11,710
No, no, no, no.

6429
04:56:28,440 --> 04:56:29,620
Come to think of it...

6430
04:56:29,620 --> 04:56:31,120
I just saw it a few minutes ago.

6431
04:56:31,380 --> 04:56:32,700
It's probably astray.

6432
04:56:32,900 --> 04:56:33,800
It's alive, right?

6433
04:56:34,580 --> 04:56:35,480
It's kind of limp.

6434
04:56:36,160 --> 04:56:36,900
Is it okay?

6435
04:56:40,780 --> 04:56:41,600
I don't know.

6436
04:56:41,640 --> 04:56:42,360
I think it's unconscious.

6437
04:56:42,520 --> 04:56:42,680
Okay.

6438
04:56:42,740 --> 04:56:43,260
It's unconscious.

6439
04:56:43,520 --> 04:56:43,840
It's unconscious.

6440
04:56:44,900 --> 04:56:45,460
It's funny.

6441
04:56:45,540 --> 04:56:47,040
It doesn't look like it's injured or anything.

6442
04:56:47,040 --> 04:56:47,460
Okay.

6443
04:56:51,690 --> 04:56:52,830
Poor little kitty.

6444
04:56:55,310 --> 04:56:57,890
How about if I take it to my house and look after it?

6445
04:56:58,850 --> 04:57:00,830
Would you like to come home with me, little kitten?

6446
04:57:10,400 --> 04:57:13,440
Well, it looks like his fate just changed in a big way.

6447
04:57:14,600 --> 04:57:15,280
Whose fate?

6448
04:57:16,140 --> 04:57:17,340
That kitten's, of course.

6449
04:57:18,000 --> 04:57:19,380
You're a suit.

6450
04:57:19,920 --> 04:57:21,500
Why did you have to...

6451
04:57:25,510 --> 04:57:26,350
In the middle!

6452
04:57:26,670 --> 04:57:27,230
Hey!

6453
04:57:30,550 --> 04:57:31,190
Sizzles!

6454
04:57:33,570 --> 04:57:34,210
Sizzle?

6455
04:57:35,250 --> 04:57:37,450
The name Sizzle echoes in my head.

6456
04:57:38,010 --> 04:57:39,350
That's my real name.

6457
04:57:40,690 --> 04:57:42,210
So we weren't a rat.

6458
04:57:42,750 --> 04:57:44,190
We were a cat!

6459
04:57:44,930 --> 04:57:47,110
These long, lonely ten years.

6460
04:57:47,750 --> 04:57:49,910
You were my one and only friend.

6461
04:57:54,270 --> 04:57:55,690
No, me?

6462
04:57:56,490 --> 04:57:57,530
How about it?

6463
04:57:57,610 --> 04:57:58,870
Do you remember now?

6464
04:58:01,230 --> 04:58:02,990
So cute!

6465
04:58:04,690 --> 04:58:05,950
Old friend.

6466
04:58:10,260 --> 04:58:13,120
Oh my god, we're awesome!

6467
04:58:14,240 --> 04:58:15,680
I think...

6468
04:58:16,420 --> 04:58:18,080
I think I finally remember.

6469
04:58:20,020 --> 04:58:23,180
Ten years ago, I was a little kitten that wandered into this park.

6470
04:58:23,400 --> 04:58:25,580
I was weak and all alone in the world.

6471
04:58:28,600 --> 04:58:29,260
Hold it!

6472
04:58:35,850 --> 04:58:38,290
God, why am I crying?

6473
04:58:42,810 --> 04:58:44,570
Somebody please look at me!

6474
04:58:46,110 --> 04:58:46,630
No!

6475
04:58:51,440 --> 04:58:52,300
The kitten!

6476
04:58:56,100 --> 04:58:57,640
That's why I didn't know anything!

6477
04:59:03,580 --> 04:59:04,620
So cute!

6478
04:59:08,960 --> 04:59:11,140
Somebody please reach a hand out to me!

6479
04:59:14,500 --> 04:59:15,020
No!

6480
04:59:16,200 --> 04:59:17,400
Oh, and he can manipulate!

6481
04:59:17,900 --> 04:59:20,040
I had just only died at the time.

6482
04:59:21,520 --> 04:59:22,740
I had lost everything.

6483
04:59:22,880 --> 04:59:23,820
My life, my memory.

6484
04:59:24,240 --> 04:59:26,060
My body wouldn't move anymore.

6485
04:59:26,060 --> 04:59:29,060
But I still managed to reach out a hand to him.

6486
04:59:34,980 --> 04:59:38,920
And the next thing I knew, my soul had transferred to the black kitten.

6487
04:59:40,640 --> 04:59:44,680
With no recollection of who I was, I lived as a cat with you for a while.

6488
04:59:52,650 --> 04:59:54,890
After a while, the man regained his memory.

6489
04:59:55,150 --> 04:59:56,810
And went back to being just a cat.

6490
04:59:57,450 --> 04:59:59,130
And then the man got his body back.

6491
05:00:07,870 --> 05:00:09,190
Gosh, I wish I were a cat.

6492
05:00:09,770 --> 05:00:11,970
I took my body back from the morgue.

6493
05:00:12,390 --> 05:00:15,330
There was somebody I just had to go see.

6494
05:00:16,970 --> 05:00:18,110
Just one more time.

6495
05:00:22,750 --> 05:00:25,290
I took control of my body and hurried to her house.

6496
05:00:29,050 --> 05:00:30,710
But I was just a little too late.

6497
05:00:34,730 --> 05:00:35,610
His wife!

6498
05:00:46,060 --> 05:00:48,580
I had just missed her as she left this world.

6499
05:00:51,770 --> 05:00:54,870
She left me a note that said, I'm coming to you, Yomiel.

6500
05:01:05,350 --> 05:01:07,170
The man named me Sissel.

6501
05:01:08,010 --> 05:01:13,210
It was the name of something important he had lost along with his life.

6502
05:01:15,990 --> 05:01:17,030
His fiancée.

6503
05:01:17,730 --> 05:01:19,410
He told me about it once.

6504
05:01:19,910 --> 05:01:21,890
But I didn't understand what it was.

6505
05:01:32,900 --> 05:01:34,900
Those ten years were very happy for me.

6506
05:01:34,900 --> 05:01:36,740
But they weren't happy for the man.

6507
05:01:36,960 --> 05:01:38,620
There was nothing I could do for him.

6508
05:01:49,170 --> 05:01:51,210
For ten years I wandered through the darkness.

6509
05:01:51,490 --> 05:01:53,170
With no particular place to go.

6510
05:01:56,730 --> 05:01:59,470
As time passed, my powers gradually changed.

6511
05:02:00,270 --> 05:02:02,990
At first I could only manipulate small creatures and objects.

6512
05:02:03,510 --> 05:02:05,730
But then after a while I could manipulate people.

6513
05:02:07,770 --> 05:02:11,970
That's when the darkness inside me deepened and I started to get a little twisted.

6514
05:02:16,100 --> 05:02:17,320
I wanted light.

6515
05:02:19,000 --> 05:02:20,600
Distorted artificial light.

6516
05:02:36,380 --> 05:02:38,740
When I got my revenge on Lin...

6517
05:02:39,420 --> 05:02:40,800
I would see that light.

6518
05:02:41,000 --> 05:02:42,600
Or at least that's what I tried to believe.

6519
05:03:00,300 --> 05:03:03,720
I left my old self buried in that junkyard and walked away.

6520
05:03:15,390 --> 05:03:18,270
Wait, did we see this before?

6521
05:03:18,530 --> 05:03:19,050
I don't remember.

6522
05:03:21,230 --> 05:03:22,270
The black cat.

6523
05:03:22,690 --> 05:03:24,530
I was possessing Cissel then.

6524
05:03:27,470 --> 05:03:32,370
It wouldn't look very much like a murder if the corpse got up and walked away, after all.

6525
05:03:32,570 --> 05:03:33,070
But what was that about?

6526
05:03:33,070 --> 05:03:34,270
Yeah, we did wait back, right?

6527
05:03:34,430 --> 05:03:34,650
Yes.

6528
05:03:34,930 --> 05:03:37,070
So you borrowed the body of your old friend.

6529
05:03:38,310 --> 05:03:38,790
Awww

6530
05:03:42,230 --> 05:03:42,950
Cissel was in the dark.

6531
05:03:42,950 --> 05:03:44,770
What was inside that bag I was carrying tonight?

6532
05:03:45,070 --> 05:03:46,610
Why would you bring your cat?

6533
05:03:47,470 --> 05:03:51,410
I had no intention of leaving my friend behind in this country when I left.

6534
05:03:51,870 --> 05:03:55,050
But then, when I went to possess his body...

6535
05:03:55,050 --> 05:03:56,850
I realized something horrible.

6536
05:03:57,770 --> 05:03:58,630
What was that?

6537
05:03:59,270 --> 05:04:01,270
Is this still there inside the bag?

6538
05:04:01,710 --> 05:04:02,230
Oh

6539
05:04:23,080 --> 05:04:26,700
man, why do I have to kill the cat?

6540
05:04:30,910 --> 05:04:31,950
Not the cat!

6541
05:04:31,950 --> 05:04:32,310
The cat!

6542
05:04:34,670 --> 05:04:37,630
I wasn't able to control her completely.

6543
05:04:39,550 --> 05:04:40,270
No!

6544
05:04:41,990 --> 05:04:44,470
The first bullet didn't hit anything.

6545
05:04:44,670 --> 05:04:46,070
Or so I thought.

6546
05:04:46,910 --> 05:04:48,510
But it did hit something.

6547
05:04:51,190 --> 05:04:53,430
It hits it so much!

6548
05:04:57,130 --> 05:04:58,350
That's so sad.

6549
05:05:02,070 --> 05:05:03,710
That's when I lost my life.

6550
05:05:04,070 --> 05:05:06,450
Right there in the presence of Temsik radiation.

6551
05:05:11,900 --> 05:05:14,280
And that's when I got my powers of the dead.

6552
05:05:14,400 --> 05:05:15,300
My ghost tricks.

6553
05:05:19,470 --> 05:05:21,090
I think I understand it now.

6554
05:05:23,410 --> 05:05:25,910
Why I was the only one who couldn't get his memory back.

6555
05:05:28,550 --> 05:05:30,770
It was because I thought that corpse was me.

6556
05:05:30,870 --> 05:05:32,510
Yeah, because he took off with the body!

6557
05:05:34,830 --> 05:05:38,250
It was the only corpse I could see at the time after all.

6558
05:05:40,170 --> 05:05:42,790
But as it turns out, it wasn't the only dead body.

6559
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:49,080
My true death was hiding just behind that corpse.

6560
05:05:53,360 --> 05:05:58,340
Now that I think about it, do you remember what you said?

6561
05:05:59,640 --> 05:06:02,420
That you knew all along about me saving Lin tonight?

6562
05:06:02,420 --> 05:06:05,200
And if you knew, why didn't you try to stop me?

6563
05:06:06,460 --> 05:06:07,280
It's simple.

6564
05:06:08,180 --> 05:06:10,520
Because I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

6565
05:06:12,620 --> 05:06:13,380
Why not?

6566
05:06:15,440 --> 05:06:18,980
Remember the thing about individual differences and the powers we get?

6567
05:06:19,780 --> 05:06:23,120
I can control all kinds of things, from the living to the dead.

6568
05:06:23,280 --> 05:06:28,400
But even so, there are some things that you can do that I can't.

6569
05:06:29,400 --> 05:06:30,360
You mean...

6570
05:06:31,420 --> 05:06:34,900
I can't even rewind time, let alone change the fate of a death.

6571
05:06:37,320 --> 05:06:41,320
If I could do those things, I would have saved your life.

6572
05:06:49,800 --> 05:06:55,800
Not only that, but I never would have just let my fiancé stay dead like that.

6573
05:06:57,920 --> 05:07:00,120
But you're here ten years in the past now!

6574
05:07:01,760 --> 05:07:03,320
That's thanks to your powers!

6575
05:07:04,900 --> 05:07:06,700
I just tagged along with you.

6576
05:07:17,460 --> 05:07:23,020
In any case, now the starting point of this entire tragedy has changed dramatically, altering fate.

6577
05:07:29,760 --> 05:07:31,460
The fate of your death.

6578
05:07:31,760 --> 05:07:33,340
The Kitten Sissel's fate.

6579
05:07:34,560 --> 05:07:39,200
And I can just bet you the fate of the woman you love has changed too.

6580
05:07:42,580 --> 05:07:43,920
I believe you're right.

6581
05:07:46,920 --> 05:07:49,240
So this was the last fate to be averted, eh?

6582
05:07:51,000 --> 05:07:53,520
Why do you have to still play the animation?

6583
05:07:59,940 --> 05:08:00,900
So, Yomiya...

6584
05:08:02,400 --> 05:08:05,040
It looks like your plan for revenge ended in failure.

6585
05:08:10,170 --> 05:08:11,530
Yes, and I'm glad too.

6586
05:08:18,520 --> 05:08:20,520
I think I kind of understand now.

6587
05:08:21,640 --> 05:08:23,720
What you've been feeling these ten years.

6588
05:08:24,620 --> 05:08:25,700
Oh yeah...

6589
05:08:27,100 --> 05:08:27,900
She understood.

6590
05:08:28,380 --> 05:08:29,900
She shed tears for me.

6591
05:08:31,660 --> 05:08:33,300
That's when my revenge was over.

6592
05:08:34,340 --> 05:08:36,160
She saved me from the darkness.

6593
05:08:42,990 --> 05:08:44,730
Well, I guess it's time we got back.

6594
05:08:45,350 --> 05:08:47,590
A new ten years later was just born.

6595
05:08:48,730 --> 05:08:49,970
What's gonna be different?

6596
05:08:52,890 --> 05:08:55,570
Right, we should get back to our new present.

6597
05:08:58,730 --> 05:08:59,670
Oh, Miso!

6598
05:09:01,270 --> 05:09:03,810
I can't wait to see Ms. Lin and Ms. Camilla again!

6599
05:09:05,870 --> 05:09:08,290
So these past ten years will all vanish.

6600
05:09:08,770 --> 05:09:09,730
Will they remember?

6601
05:09:10,450 --> 05:09:11,510
Well, not completely.

6602
05:09:13,470 --> 05:09:16,510
The memories of all of us here will remain.

6603
05:09:17,550 --> 05:09:20,430
Wait, what about Camilla and Lin too then?

6604
05:09:20,430 --> 05:09:21,990
I love seeing this game.

6605
05:09:22,030 --> 05:09:24,970
It's my favorite game after MGS3 or 4.

6606
05:09:27,270 --> 05:09:28,910
Including the memory of what I did.

6607
05:09:29,090 --> 05:09:29,810
My crime.

6608
05:09:32,190 --> 05:09:34,470
That's the way this game of the dead works, eh?

6609
05:09:35,270 --> 05:09:37,150
And no matter what the reason.

6610
05:09:38,530 --> 05:09:42,890
There's no denying the fact that I took Lin hostage and tried to point a gun at her.

6611
05:09:44,390 --> 05:09:46,930
I have no intention of running away from that either.

6612
05:09:46,930 --> 05:09:50,470
The most inexcusable crime in my new life.

6613
05:09:52,310 --> 05:09:53,710
Congrats on beating the game, man.

6614
05:09:53,710 --> 05:09:54,170
Thank you!

6615
05:09:56,530 --> 05:09:57,350
Hey, Sissel.

6616
05:09:58,410 --> 05:09:58,870
Yes?

6617
05:09:59,550 --> 05:10:02,230
When we go back, our fates will no longer be interconnected.

6618
05:10:03,150 --> 05:10:04,690
It will be like we never met.

6619
05:10:05,170 --> 05:10:07,690
So before that happens, I just wanted to say one thing.

6620
05:10:09,370 --> 05:10:12,130
Tonight, I stole away your life with my own hands.

6621
05:10:13,150 --> 05:10:14,310
I'm truly sorry.

6622
05:10:17,330 --> 05:10:19,370
It's already a thing of the lost past.

6623
05:10:20,030 --> 05:10:21,710
Our fates have changed now.

6624
05:10:21,870 --> 05:10:22,770
Right, Yomiyo?

6625
05:10:27,240 --> 05:10:28,380
Thank you, Sissel.

6626
05:10:29,560 --> 05:10:31,320
I'm so very glad I met you.

6627
05:10:32,580 --> 05:10:33,880
Me too, Yomiyo.

6628
05:10:35,440 --> 05:10:37,740
Sissel, are we ever going to see each other again?

6629
05:10:38,260 --> 05:10:40,040
I couldn't stand it if we weren't.

6630
05:10:41,000 --> 05:10:41,960
Don't worry, Missel.

6631
05:10:42,860 --> 05:10:44,680
I bet we'll see each other again someday.

6632
05:10:44,680 --> 05:10:49,340
Ten years from now, our paths are sure to cross.

6633
05:10:50,160 --> 05:10:51,840
We'll just have to wait until then.

6634
05:10:52,920 --> 05:10:53,720
Sissel, I'll...

6635
05:10:53,720 --> 05:10:55,260
I'll never forget you!

6636
05:10:56,580 --> 05:10:59,220
I'll never forget you either, valiant little doggie.

6637
05:11:01,620 --> 05:11:04,800
Well, it looks like you've come to live with me now.

6638
05:11:05,380 --> 05:11:07,640
So let's be getting home, little black cat.

6639
05:11:08,920 --> 05:11:09,640
Home, huh?

6640
05:11:09,860 --> 05:11:11,620
That sounds good, Detective Jaud.

6641
05:11:14,680 --> 05:11:16,520
We all witnessed the birth of a new beginning.

6642
05:11:16,660 --> 05:11:19,700
And now, we're each going back to our own new present.

6643
05:11:19,880 --> 05:11:21,220
This is all so weird.

6644
05:11:24,580 --> 05:11:27,660
We said goodbye to the parts of our stories that would be lost.

6645
05:11:28,360 --> 05:11:30,700
Believing that someday our paths would all cross again.

6646
05:11:33,940 --> 05:11:36,720
Well, I mean, if you have your memories still, you can just...

6647
05:11:36,720 --> 05:11:38,960
You can all just meet up again, right?

6648
05:11:39,380 --> 05:11:39,800
Wait!

6649
05:11:40,360 --> 05:11:40,960
Hold it!

6650
05:11:46,500 --> 05:11:49,600
Before you go back to a new present, I wanted to thank you.

6651
05:11:50,040 --> 05:11:50,880
Is this Ray?

6652
05:11:51,200 --> 05:11:52,160
Is this the lamp?

6653
05:11:56,140 --> 05:11:58,080
Before I cease to exist.

6654
05:11:59,060 --> 05:11:59,800
Oh, it's you!

6655
05:12:00,980 --> 05:12:03,860
Yes, it is I, Ray, in case you have forgotten again.

6656
05:12:06,860 --> 05:12:09,880
Thanks to you, everything has turned out as I had hoped.

6657
05:12:10,960 --> 05:12:12,840
I'm really grateful to you, Cecil.

6658
05:12:12,920 --> 05:12:13,600
Thank you.

6659
05:12:14,800 --> 05:12:18,880
But don't forget, I was only on a journey to find my own lost memory.

6660
05:12:19,760 --> 05:12:21,080
Yes, yes, I know that.

6661
05:12:22,680 --> 05:12:24,140
I know all about you.

6662
05:12:24,820 --> 05:12:26,460
Can I ask you a question, Ray?

6663
05:12:26,980 --> 05:12:29,920
I want to know, who exactly are you?

6664
05:12:33,830 --> 05:12:34,610
Fair enough.

6665
05:12:34,930 --> 05:12:35,990
I will tell you.

6666
05:12:36,950 --> 05:12:40,090
Let me tell you about another version of tonight's events.

6667
05:12:42,110 --> 05:12:42,710
Huh?

6668
05:12:42,710 --> 05:12:43,310
Huh?

6669
05:12:43,750 --> 05:12:44,350
Huh?

6670
05:12:45,330 --> 05:12:47,950
You changed the fates of many people tonight.

6671
05:12:50,110 --> 05:12:51,790
The first of which was hers.

6672
05:12:54,470 --> 05:12:55,070
Lin?

6673
05:12:58,990 --> 05:13:01,350
We killed people in the process, too!

6674
05:13:02,330 --> 05:13:03,930
We killed other people!

6675
05:13:06,030 --> 05:13:09,850
If you had not been there for her tonight, her fate would have been...

6676
05:13:10,090 --> 05:13:13,570
would have been to die in that lonely spot on the outskirts of town.

6677
05:13:14,170 --> 05:13:16,210
The return of the best character of the game.

6678
05:13:16,950 --> 05:13:19,610
If that had occurred, what do you suppose would have happened?

6679
05:13:20,470 --> 05:13:21,710
I don't... I don't know.

6680
05:13:23,670 --> 05:13:25,190
Let me tell you a story.

6681
05:13:25,610 --> 05:13:27,310
The story of a little creature.

6682
05:13:31,920 --> 05:13:32,380
What?

6683
05:13:32,820 --> 05:13:36,760
After they stole her life that night, they broke into her apartment.

6684
05:13:39,800 --> 05:13:40,240
Oh!

6685
05:13:40,240 --> 05:13:40,680
Missile!

6686
05:13:41,740 --> 05:13:42,780
Don't hurt missile.

6687
05:13:43,460 --> 05:13:44,180
Don't do it.

6688
05:13:44,880 --> 05:13:45,320
Oh!

6689
05:13:47,260 --> 05:13:48,120
Don't do it!

6690
05:13:48,300 --> 05:13:49,340
It's not necessary!

6691
05:13:53,150 --> 05:13:56,410
They stole the wooden box from the ceiling hiding place and left.

6692
05:13:56,610 --> 05:13:57,770
How did they know it was up there?

6693
05:13:58,010 --> 05:13:59,730
And in the process...

6694
05:14:03,030 --> 05:14:04,350
They killed them both?

6695
05:14:06,650 --> 05:14:09,250
Two little dead bodies were left behind.

6696
05:14:09,470 --> 05:14:10,030
What?

6697
05:14:15,520 --> 05:14:16,120
However...

6698
05:14:17,200 --> 05:14:19,680
The little fellow's spirit lived on.

6699
05:14:20,120 --> 05:14:23,340
He desperately reached out his paw towards his mistress.

6700
05:14:23,820 --> 05:14:25,700
And that's when a miracle occurred.

6701
05:14:27,980 --> 05:14:28,580
What?

6702
05:14:28,660 --> 05:14:29,360
Look at that!

6703
05:14:29,400 --> 05:14:30,300
The powers of the dead!

6704
05:14:30,620 --> 05:14:31,380
But how?

6705
05:14:32,140 --> 05:14:33,920
He didn't really understand it himself.

6706
05:14:34,300 --> 05:14:35,360
Not yet, anyway.

6707
05:14:36,240 --> 05:14:37,040
Not yet, anyway.

6708
05:14:37,040 --> 05:14:39,740
With all you know now, I bet you understand it, do you not?

6709
05:14:40,480 --> 05:14:41,420
Hey, wait a minute.

6710
05:14:44,990 --> 05:14:46,990
Look at the toe as he shoots him.

6711
05:14:47,390 --> 05:14:48,970
Oh my god, why is it...

6712
05:14:48,970 --> 05:14:49,090
Oh!

6713
05:14:50,650 --> 05:14:53,570
Oh my god, because he was close to sis...

6714
05:14:53,570 --> 05:14:53,910
I mean...

6715
05:14:53,910 --> 05:14:54,810
Yeah, sis...

6716
05:14:54,810 --> 05:14:55,490
Wait, not sis...

6717
05:14:55,490 --> 05:14:56,390
Oh my god, my brain.

6718
05:14:58,570 --> 05:15:01,470
He died inside the aura of that strange energy.

6719
05:15:05,290 --> 05:15:07,410
But unfortunately, with his meager powers...

6720
05:15:07,410 --> 05:15:09,110
He was unable to save his little mistress.

6721
05:15:09,370 --> 05:15:11,270
Oh, there just wasn't anything he could do.

6722
05:15:11,470 --> 05:15:13,370
With only the power to swap objects.

6723
05:15:14,030 --> 05:15:17,430
He needed the power to manipulate objects in order to save the little lady.

6724
05:15:18,730 --> 05:15:20,910
The little fellow chased after the men.

6725
05:15:21,290 --> 05:15:23,130
There still wasn't anything he could do.

6726
05:15:27,810 --> 05:15:31,450
In the end, he was left behind with the man in red in the deep, deep sea.

6727
05:15:31,590 --> 05:15:32,630
Oh my god, no!

6728
05:15:35,370 --> 05:15:36,330
And then...

6729
05:15:36,930 --> 05:15:37,270
Okay...

6730
05:15:37,910 --> 05:15:38,850
He went back.

6731
05:15:39,930 --> 05:15:43,510
He went back to the world ten years before to the moment of the man in red's death.

6732
05:15:44,710 --> 05:15:44,970
Huh?

6733
05:15:49,180 --> 05:15:49,700
Huh?

6734
05:15:52,300 --> 05:15:52,820
What?

6735
05:15:55,040 --> 05:15:55,560
Huh?

6736
05:15:56,520 --> 05:15:57,040
Huh?

6737
05:15:58,120 --> 05:15:58,640
Huh?

6738
05:15:59,340 --> 05:16:01,240
He decided to wait it out.

6739
05:16:01,920 --> 05:16:04,580
He decided to wait until that night came again.

6740
05:16:11,060 --> 05:16:13,260
That's the other version of the story of this night.

6741
05:16:16,020 --> 05:16:17,500
Is this Missile?

6742
05:16:20,080 --> 05:16:22,080
He's been waiting this whole time?

6743
05:16:28,080 --> 05:16:29,760
Oh my god, Hihachiko!

6744
05:16:30,800 --> 05:16:31,480
He...

6745
05:16:32,080 --> 05:16:36,160
A story that has taken these ten years to be retold.

6746
05:16:39,900 --> 05:16:40,880
So that was you.

6747
05:16:50,540 --> 05:16:51,820
Old Soul!

6748
05:16:54,280 --> 05:16:55,080
That's right.

6749
05:16:55,960 --> 05:16:56,980
I'm Missile.

6750
05:16:56,980 --> 05:16:58,620
Hold on, he needs like a really...

6751
05:16:59,080 --> 05:16:59,420
What?

6752
05:17:00,920 --> 05:17:02,100
No way!

6753
05:17:04,480 --> 05:17:05,820
I'm Missile.

6754
05:17:06,360 --> 05:17:09,900
Ten years is a very long time in dark years.

6755
05:17:10,740 --> 05:17:14,100
You couldn't change the fates of these people on your own.

6756
05:17:14,100 --> 05:17:15,800
Wait, but how did he go back in time?

6757
05:17:18,040 --> 05:17:19,860
That's why he had the grandpa voice.

6758
05:17:20,040 --> 05:17:21,280
Oh my god, you're right!

6759
05:17:24,640 --> 05:17:25,980
Oh my god, you're right!

6760
05:17:29,220 --> 05:17:31,660
So you decided to wait those ten years out.

6761
05:17:33,440 --> 05:17:34,340
Best character.

6762
05:17:35,780 --> 05:17:36,300
Missile.

6763
05:17:37,540 --> 05:17:38,060
Exactly.

6764
05:17:38,140 --> 05:17:38,560
Exactly.

6765
05:17:38,960 --> 05:17:43,140
And then at last, that fateful night rolled around again.

6766
05:17:45,540 --> 05:17:47,240
Punished Old Missile.

6767
05:17:48,000 --> 05:17:49,120
Old Missile.

6768
05:17:49,900 --> 05:17:51,100
Oh my god.

6769
05:17:52,060 --> 05:17:56,120
But this time I had grown old and my powers were weak.

6770
05:17:56,840 --> 05:18:00,400
So I decided I needed to find somebody to help me this time around.

6771
05:18:01,440 --> 05:18:03,660
That's why he lied about the dawn, right?

6772
05:18:03,780 --> 05:18:05,840
Just because everything had to be done tonight.

6773
05:18:08,780 --> 05:18:11,580
Somebody who possessed different powers than me.

6774
05:18:12,740 --> 05:18:13,900
But wait a second.

6775
05:18:13,900 --> 05:18:16,980
You were able to manipulate that desk lamp.

6776
05:18:18,650 --> 05:18:21,420
Over the course of the long years, my powers changed.

6777
05:18:21,760 --> 05:18:23,900
My ability to swap objects weakened.

6778
05:18:24,160 --> 05:18:27,620
But I became able to manipulate small objects.

6779
05:18:28,630 --> 05:18:31,800
But in that case, why didn't you cooperate with yourself?

6780
05:18:32,340 --> 05:18:33,600
Because I couldn't.

6781
05:18:35,720 --> 05:18:39,520
Ten years and the joint made you an MGS pirate.

6782
05:18:40,900 --> 05:18:41,560
Huh?

6783
05:18:42,780 --> 05:18:47,820
From watching the man in red, I found out there were individual differences in our powers.

6784
05:18:48,180 --> 05:18:50,500
I couldn't do any of the things he could do.

6785
05:18:50,720 --> 05:18:53,300
Like travel through the telephone lines, for example.

6786
05:18:54,540 --> 05:18:55,020
What?

6787
05:18:55,540 --> 05:18:59,020
It may not seem like much, but it's a very important power.

6788
05:19:00,080 --> 05:19:02,100
Especially if you're trying to chase somebody.

6789
05:19:04,100 --> 05:19:05,940
But there's something I don't understand.

6790
05:19:06,480 --> 05:19:08,920
You knew from the very beginning that I had that power.

6791
05:19:08,920 --> 05:19:11,400
How did you know so much about me?

6792
05:19:12,020 --> 05:19:13,240
Why wouldn't I?

6793
05:19:13,600 --> 05:19:18,320
After all, we had met before on that night the first time around.

6794
05:19:19,360 --> 05:19:20,240
We what?

6795
05:19:20,580 --> 05:19:21,600
We met before?

6796
05:19:25,000 --> 05:19:33,820
From listening to the conversation of the two intruders to the apartment, I learned that Ms. Lin had lost her life at that junkyard on the edge of town.

6797
05:19:36,400 --> 05:19:41,100
I followed the ghost world path to the junkyard and came upon an incredible scene.

6798
05:19:52,970 --> 05:19:57,330
Imagine, if you will, there in the darkness a twisting and swiveling desk lamp.

6799
05:19:58,030 --> 05:20:00,910
It made my first and on end, I can tell you.

6800
05:20:01,830 --> 05:20:03,070
That was me?

6801
05:20:04,390 --> 05:20:07,630
So I was shot on that night the first time around as well.

6802
05:20:12,740 --> 05:20:14,780
You had lost your memory that time too.

6803
05:20:16,320 --> 05:20:18,440
You had just died and you felt confused.

6804
05:20:19,200 --> 05:20:20,760
You declined to cooperate...

6805
05:20:20,760 --> 05:20:22,920
You declined to cooperate with me.

6806
05:20:23,660 --> 05:20:24,640
I did what?

6807
05:20:28,380 --> 05:20:30,280
I just want to find my own lost memory.

6808
05:20:30,460 --> 05:20:31,880
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

6809
05:20:32,040 --> 05:20:32,960
Wait, but that happened too.

6810
05:20:33,120 --> 05:20:34,160
That's what you said.

6811
05:20:43,130 --> 05:20:44,730
And then you disappeared.

6812
05:20:47,470 --> 05:20:49,970
Oh, way over the telephone line.

6813
05:20:55,520 --> 05:20:57,400
I'm really sorry I didn't help you.

6814
05:20:58,060 --> 05:21:03,960
That's why I decided that this time I would use that desire of yours to our mutual advantage.

6815
05:21:04,960 --> 05:21:05,800
Mutual advantage?

6816
05:21:07,020 --> 05:21:11,020
The only thing you were interested in was finding your own lost memory.

6817
05:21:11,680 --> 05:21:16,500
If I could guide you along the right path to doing that, we would both benefit.

6818
05:21:16,500 --> 05:21:18,900
And namely, the right path would be...

6819
05:21:18,900 --> 05:21:20,660
The path to the man in red.

6820
05:21:20,800 --> 05:21:21,620
To Yomiel.

6821
05:21:22,840 --> 05:21:23,300
What?

6822
05:21:23,880 --> 05:21:27,500
I gave you the information you needed to know to set you in the right direction.

6823
05:21:28,800 --> 05:21:30,680
And then I gave you a time limit.

6824
05:21:31,740 --> 05:21:32,740
A time limit?

6825
05:21:34,020 --> 05:21:34,620
That's right.

6826
05:21:34,980 --> 05:21:37,760
As you know, I said you only had until tomorrow morning.

6827
05:21:38,700 --> 05:21:41,660
If I hadn't done that, you wouldn't have found out the truth tonight.

6828
05:21:43,460 --> 05:21:46,480
And the man in red would have been sealed away at the bottom.

6829
05:21:46,480 --> 05:21:47,660
At the bottom of the sea forever.

6830
05:21:48,540 --> 05:21:51,260
If that had happened, it would have been all over.

6831
05:21:53,060 --> 05:21:53,940
Smart doggo.

6832
05:21:54,440 --> 05:21:55,680
Then you mean...

6833
05:21:55,680 --> 05:21:57,740
That thing about ceasing to exist?

6834
05:21:58,300 --> 05:21:58,880
Oh, that?

6835
05:21:59,000 --> 05:21:59,920
Completely made up.

6836
05:22:00,060 --> 05:22:01,700
A little naughty of me, I know.

6837
05:22:02,880 --> 05:22:05,200
But I just wanted you to use your time wisely.

6838
05:22:05,280 --> 05:22:07,420
I really thought that the lamp was the wife.

6839
05:22:08,380 --> 05:22:09,260
Oh boy.

6840
05:22:09,700 --> 05:22:13,040
I hate to admit it, but this little doggie really outsmarted me in every way.

6841
05:22:14,060 --> 05:22:16,460
Let's just call it the wisdom that comes with it.

6842
05:22:19,830 --> 05:22:21,690
I didn't expect a missile.

6843
05:22:22,350 --> 05:22:23,350
Old missile.

6844
05:22:24,470 --> 05:22:26,390
And now it's time to say farewell.

6845
05:22:27,310 --> 05:22:31,170
These past ten years will cease to exist, and with them, so will I.

6846
05:22:32,270 --> 05:22:33,890
But you'll be regular missile.

6847
05:22:34,070 --> 05:22:36,270
You can rest now, old missile.

6848
05:22:37,410 --> 05:22:38,650
I believed in you.

6849
05:22:38,990 --> 05:22:40,690
I always knew you could do it.

6850
05:22:41,290 --> 05:22:42,490
And so you did.

6851
05:22:43,130 --> 05:22:43,850
Thank you.

6852
05:22:43,910 --> 05:22:45,610
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

6853
05:22:49,110 --> 05:22:51,470
Why do you keep timing it like this?

6854
05:22:56,380 --> 05:22:58,440
That's so plain, it's like a damn poodle.

6855
05:23:02,400 --> 05:23:05,200
So you waited and waited these ten long years.

6856
05:23:07,260 --> 05:23:10,800
All for the sake of your two ladies, Lynn and Camilla, eh?

6857
05:23:12,520 --> 05:23:13,320
Of course.

6858
05:23:14,560 --> 05:23:16,620
That's because that's what doggies do!

6859
05:23:17,740 --> 05:23:19,380
Now then, farewell, sissel.

6860
05:23:22,040 --> 05:23:25,020
And so the story of a single night came to an end.

6861
05:23:25,380 --> 05:23:28,800
And only a single night that for us spanned across several weeks.

6862
05:23:29,160 --> 05:23:29,380
Oh!

6863
05:23:29,440 --> 05:23:30,600
Oh no, I can't even read it!

6864
05:23:30,680 --> 05:23:33,080
I made my way back, back to a new present!

6865
05:23:33,680 --> 05:23:37,080
I didn't, I thought it was, I thought it was push to, push to proceed.

6866
05:23:45,600 --> 05:23:48,240
Missile best boy waited twenty years to help his masters.

6867
05:23:49,900 --> 05:23:51,080
Bestest boy ever.

6868
05:23:51,300 --> 05:23:52,200
Thank you, thank you!

6869
05:23:52,520 --> 05:23:52,940
Chuu!

6870
05:23:53,500 --> 05:23:53,980
Chuu!

6871
05:23:54,260 --> 05:23:55,360
How come it's dark?

6872
05:23:57,400 --> 05:23:59,060
This is not push also, so...

6873
05:23:59,060 --> 05:24:00,480
I'll just turn on the lights here.

6874
05:24:03,660 --> 05:24:04,140
Oh!

6875
05:24:06,380 --> 05:24:06,860
Oh!

6876
05:24:13,220 --> 05:24:14,000
Oh my god.

6877
05:24:16,440 --> 05:24:17,260
There's no gun!

6878
05:24:18,520 --> 05:24:19,360
There's no gun!

6879
05:24:28,760 --> 05:24:30,040
Hehe, were you surprised?

6880
05:24:31,340 --> 05:24:33,780
You bet I was, you nearly scared me to death!

6881
05:24:34,000 --> 05:24:35,060
Don't joke like that, Lynn.

6882
05:24:39,300 --> 05:24:39,700
Yippee!

6883
05:24:39,840 --> 05:24:40,440
It worked!

6884
05:24:42,800 --> 05:24:44,200
It's not even my birthday today.

6885
05:24:45,460 --> 05:24:47,760
It was my mom's birthday the day before yesterday.

6886
05:24:48,060 --> 05:24:51,660
I made this surprise for her, but it came out so well, I want to use it again.

6887
05:24:53,020 --> 05:24:54,140
Do we get to see the mom?

6888
05:24:55,220 --> 05:24:56,220
That's alright, Lynn.

6889
05:24:56,220 --> 05:25:00,280
After all, we're celebrating the birth of your new position as detective, right?

6890
05:25:02,700 --> 05:25:03,220
Really?

6891
05:25:03,480 --> 05:25:04,520
Thank you, detective child.

6892
05:25:05,440 --> 05:25:06,380
Daddy, you're home!

6893
05:25:07,700 --> 05:25:08,540
Hi, Camilla.

6894
05:25:08,600 --> 05:25:09,560
Let me introduce you.

6895
05:25:09,680 --> 05:25:10,500
This is Lynn.

6896
05:25:10,980 --> 05:25:13,120
She was just assigned to the detective...

6897
05:25:13,120 --> 05:25:15,260
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d...

6898
05:25:16,100 --> 05:25:18,560
The-the-the... The-the-the...

6899
05:25:20,360 --> 05:25:22,500
The Detective Division today.

6900
05:25:24,580 --> 05:25:25,460
Hi, Camilla.

6901
05:25:25,460 --> 05:25:26,480
It's nice to meet you.

6902
05:25:27,040 --> 05:25:28,500
Nice to meet you too, Lynn.

6903
05:25:28,720 --> 05:25:30,380
Congratulations on becoming a detective.

6904
05:25:31,880 --> 05:25:34,440
Wait, so... but he should remember this, right?

6905
05:25:34,700 --> 05:25:36,460
I guess the two of them don't remember?

6906
05:25:36,880 --> 05:25:37,080
Huh?

6907
05:25:37,480 --> 05:25:38,360
There's something wrong?

6908
05:25:40,840 --> 05:25:42,340
Yeah, one of those badges too!

6909
05:25:43,120 --> 05:25:43,680
Oh, this?

6910
05:25:43,860 --> 05:25:44,100
Yeah!

6911
05:25:45,960 --> 05:25:47,280
I have one just like it!

6912
05:25:47,360 --> 05:25:48,880
My dad gave it to me the other day.

6913
05:25:50,640 --> 05:25:52,460
But yours looks a lot older than mine.

6914
05:25:53,520 --> 05:25:55,980
How long are you going to keep wearing that toy badge, Lin?

6915
05:25:56,660 --> 05:25:57,060
Oh!

6916
05:25:58,500 --> 05:25:59,460
What's wrong with it?

6917
05:25:59,500 --> 05:26:01,300
To me, this is the symbol of a real detective!

6918
05:26:02,820 --> 05:26:04,740
It's been 10 years since then, hasn't it?

6919
05:26:05,180 --> 05:26:07,680
Who would have guessed you'd actually become a detective one day?

6920
05:26:08,220 --> 05:26:10,200
When he gave me this badge, I just knew.

6921
05:26:11,020 --> 05:26:12,900
I knew it was my destiny somehow.

6922
05:26:15,560 --> 05:26:16,240
Destiny, eh?

6923
05:26:20,740 --> 05:26:22,740
And now that I'm a detective...

6924
05:26:22,740 --> 05:26:24,980
I'll find out where that destiny will lead me!

6925
05:26:25,440 --> 05:26:27,340
So they don't remember, but...

6926
05:26:27,980 --> 05:26:28,480
Um...

6927
05:26:29,060 --> 05:26:29,560
Yomiel...

6928
05:26:29,560 --> 05:26:30,520
Sissel...

6929
05:26:31,260 --> 05:26:31,760
Missel...

6930
05:26:32,400 --> 05:26:32,900
And...

6931
05:26:32,900 --> 05:26:33,960
Jao would remember.

6932
05:26:35,240 --> 05:26:36,580
Haha, that you will.

6933
05:26:36,720 --> 05:26:37,340
That you will.

6934
05:26:40,140 --> 05:26:40,620
That you will.

6935
05:26:40,620 --> 05:26:40,940
Nyaa!

6936
05:26:41,840 --> 05:26:42,320
Sissel!

6937
05:26:44,420 --> 05:26:46,540
Don't tell me you're the same little kitten.

6938
05:26:47,220 --> 05:26:48,720
That's right, the very one.

6939
05:26:49,600 --> 05:26:50,420
You know what?

6940
05:26:50,520 --> 05:26:52,140
This is a very, very special cat.

6941
05:26:52,520 --> 05:26:54,360
He's 10 years old, but he's still a kitten!

6942
05:26:56,460 --> 05:26:57,400
Still a kitten?

6943
05:26:58,320 --> 05:27:00,320
Yep, he never got any bigger or anything!

6944
05:27:03,000 --> 05:27:03,480
Huh?

6945
05:27:03,660 --> 05:27:05,060
Was he... does he have the...

6946
05:27:05,460 --> 05:27:06,580
Was he struck with the...

6947
05:27:07,680 --> 05:27:08,440
With the fragment?

6948
05:27:08,940 --> 05:27:10,660
What a mysterious little fellow!

6949
05:27:11,120 --> 05:27:12,140
I know, right?

6950
05:27:12,320 --> 05:27:13,400
His name is Sissel!

6951
05:27:15,780 --> 05:27:16,340
Sissel.

6952
05:27:18,720 --> 05:27:20,800
Seems to me I've heard that name somewhere before.

6953
05:27:22,520 --> 05:27:23,080
Really?

6954
05:27:23,080 --> 05:27:24,020
How mysterious.

6955
05:27:25,300 --> 05:27:27,120
I think Sissel likes you, Lin.

6956
05:27:27,880 --> 05:27:29,000
Like Motomo...

6957
05:27:29,000 --> 05:27:29,500
Mom!

6958
05:27:30,240 --> 05:27:31,100
Oh my god.

6959
05:27:32,100 --> 05:27:33,020
Alright, everyone.

6960
05:27:33,260 --> 05:27:34,320
Let's start the celebration!

6961
05:27:35,220 --> 05:27:36,040
Okay, mom!

6962
05:27:42,830 --> 05:27:44,370
Sissel is so cute!

6963
05:27:47,570 --> 05:27:49,470
I bet you're just like me.

6964
05:27:49,770 --> 05:27:52,030
Your destiny led you here somehow, too.

6965
05:27:58,210 --> 05:27:59,950
I'm so glad everybody lived.

6966
05:28:00,210 --> 05:28:01,870
And so we meet again, Sissel.

6967
05:28:04,970 --> 05:28:05,490
Yay!

6968
05:28:07,710 --> 05:28:11,130
From just that single night as a human, I got a glimpse into their world.

6969
05:28:11,230 --> 05:28:12,130
And I learned something.

6970
05:28:12,130 --> 05:28:13,650
Wait, where's Missel?

6971
05:28:14,250 --> 05:28:15,190
Where's Missel?

6972
05:28:15,290 --> 05:28:17,610
Their fates, their lives, they were all interconnected.

6973
05:28:18,190 --> 05:28:19,990
Somewhere, somehow, in some way.

6974
05:28:22,210 --> 05:28:23,230
Where's Missel?

6975
05:28:24,870 --> 05:28:27,590
And now, this is my new fate.

6976
05:28:33,730 --> 05:28:35,050
I'm a ghost cat.

6977
05:28:36,430 --> 05:28:37,590
Oh my god, she...

6978
05:28:38,810 --> 05:28:40,170
Look at that spaghetti!

6979
05:28:41,630 --> 05:28:42,990
That's the best plate ever!

6980
05:28:42,990 --> 05:28:44,130
I guess I really am a cat.

6981
05:28:44,250 --> 05:28:46,070
It suits me just fine to curl up and watch...

6982
05:28:46,070 --> 05:28:47,290
Oh, it's too fast!

6983
05:28:47,410 --> 05:28:50,290
And it looks like I have plenty to watch here for quite a while.

6984
05:28:52,010 --> 05:28:52,990
Where is Missel?

6985
05:28:55,190 --> 05:28:58,550
I was too distracted by the spaghetti to read the text.

6986
05:29:13,300 --> 05:29:14,880
Like I said, it isn't my birthday.

6987
05:29:16,220 --> 05:29:17,360
Oh my god, Missel!

6988
05:29:20,280 --> 05:29:20,980
Hey, Missel.

6989
05:29:21,060 --> 05:29:23,100
I thought I asked you to stay home and guard the fort.

6990
05:29:23,660 --> 05:29:26,820
The birthdays are for celebrating together with friends and loved ones.

6991
05:29:26,980 --> 05:29:28,020
Nothing like it, baby.

6992
05:29:28,920 --> 05:29:30,300
Oh, he's eating the spaghetti!

6993
05:29:30,580 --> 05:29:32,640
The best detective eats the best meal.

6994
05:29:33,500 --> 05:29:38,840
Oh my god, look at Mataro just sitting there with her wine.

6995
05:29:51,550 --> 05:29:52,410
No way.

6996
05:29:53,050 --> 05:29:54,270
Look at this wannabe!

6997
05:29:54,710 --> 05:29:55,550
Look at this!

6998
05:29:55,710 --> 05:29:57,310
You don't even have half...

6999
05:29:58,050 --> 05:30:01,990
Your pinky toe doesn't even have a fraction of his smoothness.

7000
05:30:03,110 --> 05:30:03,890
Definitely not good.

7001
05:30:04,130 --> 05:30:06,850
Maybe now I can be a great detective just like Inspector Cabanela.

7002
05:30:07,370 --> 05:30:10,410
What kind of example is the inspector providing for his men?

7003
05:30:18,760 --> 05:30:19,840
Such a great game.

7004
05:30:22,020 --> 05:30:24,220
Oh, his toes are out even at the bar!

7005
05:30:24,780 --> 05:30:26,140
Oh my goodness gracious.

7006
05:30:26,600 --> 05:30:27,800
Here's your food, gentlemen.

7007
05:30:29,060 --> 05:30:31,960
She's still looking for someone...

7008
05:30:31,960 --> 05:30:32,880
Ew, the toes!

7009
05:30:33,000 --> 05:30:33,300
Oh my god.

7010
05:30:33,740 --> 05:30:35,460
Memory, what are you doing here?

7011
05:30:36,280 --> 05:30:40,160
I heard you were going to be picking some new members for the Special Investigation Unit today.

7012
05:30:40,640 --> 05:30:44,080
So you took on a part-time job here again just so you could eavesdrop?

7013
05:30:44,280 --> 05:30:45,440
I forgot about this.

7014
05:30:45,540 --> 05:30:46,660
I forgot about it again.

7015
05:30:47,520 --> 05:30:50,460
Oh, you have no idea the lengths I'd go to reach my goals.

7016
05:31:09,900 --> 05:31:11,320
Thanks for the awesome playthrough.

7017
05:31:14,000 --> 05:31:15,400
I've never cooked this way before.

7018
05:31:15,800 --> 05:31:16,420
Blah, blah, blah.

7019
05:31:16,600 --> 05:31:16,680
Blah, blah, blah.

7020
05:31:18,640 --> 05:31:20,680
Tumeric, coriander, cumin and...

7021
05:31:22,920 --> 05:31:24,860
Is this really necessary?

7022
05:31:25,320 --> 05:31:26,780
This new curry chicken?

7023
05:31:27,920 --> 05:31:29,760
Very best customer requested it.

7024
05:31:29,960 --> 05:31:31,860
What about the other country?

7025
05:31:31,980 --> 05:31:33,780
I guess they're not interested because...

7026
05:31:34,820 --> 05:31:36,200
There was never...

7027
05:31:37,420 --> 05:31:39,020
I don't think I could eat another bite.

7028
05:31:39,580 --> 05:31:42,140
Just who exactly is this very best customer anyway?

7029
05:31:42,900 --> 05:31:43,940
Is it Missile?

7030
05:31:44,100 --> 05:31:45,620
Oh, it's this guy!

7031
05:31:49,540 --> 05:31:51,700
I really enjoyed your playthrough of Ghostrix.

7032
05:31:51,800 --> 05:31:52,400
Thank you!

7033
05:31:52,840 --> 05:31:53,720
Thank you, thank you!

7034
05:32:01,760 --> 05:32:03,160
What was I going to say?

7035
05:32:04,580 --> 05:32:08,240
I guess the other country doesn't get involved because...

7036
05:32:08,240 --> 05:32:08,840
Oh, here they are!

7037
05:32:08,960 --> 05:32:10,540
Doing other activities.

7038
05:32:10,860 --> 05:32:13,160
Are you sure we really need all these explosives?

7039
05:32:14,060 --> 05:32:16,220
Not to worry, beauty my dear.

7040
05:32:16,260 --> 05:32:18,180
I follow the instructions exactly.

7041
05:32:18,440 --> 05:32:20,840
20 kilograms of gunpowder just like it said.

7042
05:32:21,080 --> 05:32:22,780
Oh my god, Shaggy is going to die here.

7043
05:32:22,780 --> 05:32:23,760
I can't wait to watch it.

7044
05:32:25,140 --> 05:32:26,480
Die, Shaggy, die!

7045
05:32:28,340 --> 05:32:29,060
Wait a minute.

7046
05:32:29,200 --> 05:32:30,200
20 kilograms?

7047
05:32:30,540 --> 05:32:31,880
I thought it was 20 grams.

7048
05:32:35,860 --> 05:32:36,900
Lucky day!

7049
05:32:38,120 --> 05:32:40,380
Wait, does that mean she also died?

7050
05:32:41,000 --> 05:32:42,880
Is this guy also about to die?

7051
05:32:47,720 --> 05:32:48,980
Death to Shaggy!

7052
05:32:49,140 --> 05:32:50,240
Death to Shaggy!

7053
05:32:51,960 --> 05:32:53,840
But my wife also died.

7054
05:32:53,900 --> 05:32:54,460
That's so sad.

7055
05:32:58,800 --> 05:33:00,780
So this is where you work, huh, papa?

7056
05:33:02,180 --> 05:33:02,620
Papa?

7057
05:33:02,840 --> 05:33:04,260
Why did I say it like that?

7058
05:33:04,540 --> 05:33:05,620
That's right, sweetheart.

7059
05:33:07,080 --> 05:33:10,900
Darling husband, don't you have any idea at all you could give me?

7060
05:33:11,360 --> 05:33:13,380
You must have heard some juicy stories.

7061
05:33:14,420 --> 05:33:15,800
The indiscretions of a minister.

7062
05:33:16,220 --> 05:33:16,920
No, no.

7063
05:33:17,000 --> 05:33:19,120
Must you talk that way in front of our darling angel?

7064
05:33:19,780 --> 05:33:22,000
Here's to the stodgy mind of my darling husband.

7065
05:33:22,460 --> 05:33:22,900
Oh!

7066
05:33:25,720 --> 05:33:27,500
So happy I got to watch this game with you.

7067
05:33:27,780 --> 05:33:28,560
Thank you!

7068
05:33:28,660 --> 05:33:29,380
So awesome!

7069
05:33:30,060 --> 05:33:30,920
Ashen, thank you!

7070
05:33:31,740 --> 05:33:33,100
Thanks for the spooky numbers!

7071
05:33:36,340 --> 05:33:38,280
Ransom beating one of my favorite games of all time.

7072
05:33:38,980 --> 05:33:39,740
So good.

7073
05:33:41,100 --> 05:33:42,720
I don't think the game needs a sequel.

7074
05:33:43,640 --> 05:33:45,400
Hoping that potential sequel comes alive.

7075
05:33:46,180 --> 05:33:47,760
This deal is going quite well.

7076
05:33:47,880 --> 05:33:49,500
Oh, I must say, these grapes are quite good.

7077
05:33:50,700 --> 05:33:53,860
The young Genoa is about to scrape the bottom of the sea, sir.

7078
05:33:54,600 --> 05:33:55,020
Oh!

7079
05:33:55,840 --> 05:33:56,260
Oh!

7080
05:33:56,400 --> 05:33:56,820
Eek!

7081
05:33:56,840 --> 05:33:57,140
God!

7082
05:33:59,080 --> 05:34:00,100
Keep it together, man.

7083
05:34:00,180 --> 05:34:02,040
Are you trying to give me a case of the vapors?

7084
05:34:02,120 --> 05:34:04,140
I believe I nearly died of fright just now.

7085
05:34:05,620 --> 05:34:08,040
Dead blue lady can be your ghost wife now, though.

7086
05:34:09,160 --> 05:34:10,000
Ghost wife!

7087
05:34:21,360 --> 05:34:22,540
Oh, it's this guy.

7088
05:34:23,700 --> 05:34:24,680
Yeah, rock and roll!

7089
05:34:25,440 --> 05:34:26,560
Love, peace and pigeons!

7090
05:34:26,560 --> 05:34:28,300
Long live rock and roll!

7091
05:34:30,000 --> 05:34:31,720
Oh, he's gonna go check it out.

7092
05:34:32,340 --> 05:34:33,800
One of my favorite games ever.

7093
05:34:33,980 --> 05:34:34,740
It's so awesome!

7094
05:34:35,060 --> 05:34:37,080
I can see why some people said it's their favorite game.

7095
05:34:38,820 --> 05:34:39,760
Or one of them.

7096
05:34:40,660 --> 05:34:41,940
I love pigeon man.

7097
05:34:42,280 --> 05:34:42,500
Oh!

7098
05:34:42,980 --> 05:34:43,960
Pigeons joining on!

7099
05:34:44,240 --> 05:34:45,300
Pigeons rock it out!

7100
05:34:45,460 --> 05:34:45,760
Yeah!

7101
05:34:47,980 --> 05:34:48,460
Oh!

7102
05:34:48,560 --> 05:34:48,960
Oh!

7103
05:34:48,980 --> 05:34:50,440
Oh my god!

7104
05:34:50,780 --> 05:34:51,120
Yeah!

7105
05:34:52,540 --> 05:34:53,840
Stop the poor from...

7106
05:34:53,840 --> 05:34:54,320
Oh!

7107
05:34:54,420 --> 05:34:55,280
I didn't get to read it.

7108
05:34:55,280 --> 05:34:56,160
Yeah!

7109
05:34:57,500 --> 05:34:57,980
Yeah!

7110
05:35:02,600 --> 05:35:04,860
They didn't bother changing his prison outfit.

7111
05:35:05,100 --> 05:35:05,900
I guess that's fine.

7112
05:35:13,430 --> 05:35:17,290
They planned a Ghost Trek 2 where Phoenix Wright dies?

7113
05:35:17,450 --> 05:35:18,130
That'd be awesome.

7114
05:35:19,410 --> 05:35:20,610
Today's the day, you know?

7115
05:35:20,650 --> 05:35:21,950
It's finally getting out.

7116
05:35:22,870 --> 05:35:24,230
Oh, he's doing the panic dance.

7117
05:35:24,510 --> 05:35:28,050
You know, everybody's starting to get real tired of seeing you do that.

7118
05:35:28,310 --> 05:35:32,010
Now let me show you a new dance that's been passed down in our family!

7119
05:35:32,130 --> 05:35:32,310
Oh!

7120
05:35:32,310 --> 05:35:34,610
We do this when we have a stomach ache!

7121
05:35:35,450 --> 05:35:37,630
We call it Dance Away the Pain!

7122
05:35:38,330 --> 05:35:40,630
Oh, I'm real interested in that one.

7123
05:35:40,850 --> 05:35:42,290
Think you could show it to me next...

7124
05:35:42,290 --> 05:35:43,070
Say, next week?

7125
05:35:43,510 --> 05:35:44,370
You got it!

7126
05:35:48,550 --> 05:35:50,170
I love the prison guards!

7127
05:35:50,910 --> 05:35:51,390
Bailey!

7128
05:35:51,710 --> 05:35:52,010
Yeah!

7129
05:35:56,410 --> 05:35:57,990
This game has such fun characters.

7130
05:36:00,950 --> 05:36:02,130
Oh, he's getting out!

7131
05:36:06,790 --> 05:36:08,970
Ten young long years, yo-meow!

7132
05:36:09,170 --> 05:36:10,170
Your time's up today.

7133
05:36:10,330 --> 05:36:13,070
The young lady who always comes to visit you is waiting outside.

7134
05:36:18,330 --> 05:36:20,250
Oh my god, wait, what was the painting?

7135
05:36:23,310 --> 05:36:24,450
Thank you, Cecil.

7136
05:36:26,990 --> 05:36:27,830
What's the painting?

7137
05:36:31,920 --> 05:36:33,000
He has working legs.

7138
05:36:33,060 --> 05:36:33,860
I was thinking that too.

7139
05:36:33,940 --> 05:36:35,180
I was wondering if he would like...

7140
05:36:35,180 --> 05:36:36,180
if his legs would...

7141
05:36:36,180 --> 05:36:36,320
Oh!

7142
05:36:36,500 --> 05:36:37,140
Wow!

7143
05:36:38,880 --> 05:36:39,520
Cecil!

7144
05:36:40,340 --> 05:36:40,980
Wow!

7145
05:36:43,240 --> 05:36:44,500
The painting!

7146
05:36:45,160 --> 05:36:45,740
Oh!

7147
05:36:47,700 --> 05:36:48,340
Cute!

7148
05:36:50,280 --> 05:36:51,820
Oh my god, what a good...

7149
05:36:54,780 --> 05:36:56,060
Good babies!

7150
05:37:01,120 --> 05:37:03,520
Is he gonna show up in the picture too?

7151
05:37:03,700 --> 05:37:04,080
Oh!

7152
05:37:04,320 --> 05:37:04,420
Oh!

7153
05:37:05,520 --> 05:37:06,160
Oh!

7154
05:37:06,160 --> 05:37:06,440
No!

7155
05:37:15,900 --> 05:37:17,440
I always wanted to see you play this game.

7156
05:37:17,500 --> 05:37:18,460
It's been such a fun watch.

7157
05:37:19,060 --> 05:37:20,060
Thank you, Red!

7158
05:37:20,180 --> 05:37:20,660
Thank you!

7159
05:37:23,860 --> 05:37:24,640
So cute!

7160
05:37:24,940 --> 05:37:25,600
Oh my goodness!

7161
05:37:27,220 --> 05:37:27,920
So cute!

7162
05:37:32,860 --> 05:37:34,540
The mom took the photo.

7163
05:37:35,780 --> 05:37:37,340
Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

7164
05:37:37,600 --> 05:37:40,980
I mean, she wasn't in the game like 99% of it, so...

7165
05:37:42,380 --> 05:37:43,360
Oh my gosh!

7166
05:37:43,360 --> 05:37:43,560
Oh my gosh!

7167
05:37:44,960 --> 05:37:46,960
I wanna go hug my pets now.

7168
05:37:47,340 --> 05:37:49,640
I wanna go hug Pies and Butaro.

7169
05:37:50,300 --> 05:37:51,620
I wanna go hug them.

7170
05:37:51,800 --> 05:37:52,280
I wanna...

7171
05:37:54,940 --> 05:37:57,860
Especially because Cecil looks so much like Pies.

7172
05:38:01,940 --> 05:38:06,340
I thought it might take about six hours to beat and we're a little under that, so...

7173
05:38:07,440 --> 05:38:07,920
Nice!

7174
05:38:09,180 --> 05:38:11,900
Thank you for playing my favorite game of all time.

7175
05:38:11,900 --> 05:38:12,900
Thank you!

7176
05:38:21,370 --> 05:38:22,370
Go hug them.

7177
05:38:22,550 --> 05:38:23,350
I will after...

7178
05:38:23,350 --> 05:38:23,410
Oh!

7179
05:38:24,970 --> 05:38:25,950
Is that a doughnut?

7180
05:38:27,930 --> 05:38:28,570
There we go.

7181
05:38:28,790 --> 05:38:28,890
Oh!

7182
05:38:34,800 --> 05:38:35,240
Oh!

7183
05:38:35,260 --> 05:38:35,980
There's the rat!

7184
05:38:36,800 --> 05:38:37,760
Get that rat!

7185
05:38:38,160 --> 05:38:39,300
Get that rat!

7186
05:38:41,280 --> 05:38:43,420
There are so many rats in this game.

7187
05:38:44,960 --> 05:38:46,760
Congrats on the completion of one of my faves.

7188
05:38:46,880 --> 05:38:49,540
I love how despite all the craziness, everything somehow gets explained in the end.

7189
05:38:49,680 --> 05:38:50,180
Also, make sure you subscribe to my channel.

7190
05:38:50,180 --> 05:38:50,740
Missile the best.

7191
05:38:51,000 --> 05:38:51,520
Yeah!

7192
05:38:51,740 --> 05:38:52,780
Missile the best!

7193
05:38:53,160 --> 05:38:54,660
Thanks for the pink bikini!

7194
05:38:54,920 --> 05:38:56,840
Thanks for such a fun playthrough of such a great game.

7195
05:38:57,900 --> 05:38:59,720
That was so awesome!

7196
05:39:00,580 --> 05:39:01,640
Oh my gosh!

7197
05:39:01,640 --> 05:39:03,060
I'm so glad that I played it.

7198
05:39:03,180 --> 05:39:03,900
Oh my god!

7199
05:39:03,960 --> 05:39:05,180
I'm so glad I played it.

7200
05:39:10,340 --> 05:39:11,320
That's so good.

7201
05:39:11,620 --> 05:39:12,960
This is good, isn't it?

7202
05:39:12,960 --> 05:39:13,760
Oh, Missile.

7203
05:39:14,640 --> 05:39:17,720
I can't believe the lamp was Missile all along.

7204
05:39:19,240 --> 05:39:19,760
Waiting...

7205
05:39:20,620 --> 05:39:21,660
10 years.

7206
05:39:22,260 --> 05:39:22,780
Missile.

7207
05:39:24,000 --> 05:39:24,780
That's crazy!

7208
05:39:26,640 --> 05:39:31,060
Waiting the 10 years for the whole thing to happen over again.

7209
05:39:31,780 --> 05:39:32,840
Oh my god.

7210
05:39:34,000 --> 05:39:34,520
No!

7211
05:39:34,660 --> 05:39:35,440
It was so good.

7212
05:39:35,720 --> 05:39:37,200
Missile is the best boy.

7213
05:39:38,160 --> 05:39:38,680
Missile.

7214
05:39:39,060 --> 05:39:39,740
Look at you.

7215
05:39:39,820 --> 05:39:40,940
Look at the Capcom logo.

7216
05:39:42,160 --> 05:39:43,900
Oh, I like the picture of the meteor.

7217
05:39:44,020 --> 05:39:44,620
It's so pretty.

7218
05:39:45,160 --> 05:39:46,940
This is my first time experiencing this game.

7219
05:39:47,000 --> 05:39:47,940
Doing it alongside you.

7220
05:39:48,020 --> 05:39:49,940
Your voice acting was an absolute treat.

7221
05:39:50,720 --> 05:39:51,240
Sorry.

7222
05:39:51,340 --> 05:39:52,760
My voice acting maybe was a little...

7223
05:39:52,780 --> 05:39:53,860
inconsistent, but...

7224
05:39:53,860 --> 05:39:54,920
It was still fun to do.

7225
05:39:55,120 --> 05:39:56,080
Really looking forward...

7226
05:39:56,080 --> 05:39:57,980
Really looked forward to them these past few weeks.

7227
05:39:58,360 --> 05:39:59,020
Thank you.

7228
05:39:59,280 --> 05:40:00,360
Oh my gosh!

7229
05:40:00,940 --> 05:40:01,760
Cecil background!

7230
05:40:02,040 --> 05:40:02,640
So cute!

7231
05:40:05,180 --> 05:40:05,620
Reincarnation.

7232
05:40:07,300 --> 05:40:09,500
I noticed that there was like, ghost puzzles.

7233
05:40:12,640 --> 05:40:13,520
Like, um...

7234
05:40:13,520 --> 05:40:14,400
There was like some...

7235
05:40:14,400 --> 05:40:15,020
Oh, the challenges.

7236
05:40:15,200 --> 05:40:15,520
Right?

7237
05:40:15,560 --> 05:40:17,860
There was like, some other challenges towards the end.

7238
05:40:17,940 --> 05:40:19,960
That was like, solve...

7239
05:40:22,880 --> 05:40:23,320
Oh!

7240
05:40:23,600 --> 05:40:24,040
Oh!

7241
05:40:26,260 --> 05:40:27,320
You did it!

7242
05:40:27,560 --> 05:40:33,520
So we got one!

7243
05:40:33,720 --> 05:40:34,300
Too much medicine.

7244
05:40:35,000 --> 05:40:37,260
Take aim and nail it on the second try.

7245
05:40:38,020 --> 05:40:40,280
Fail by keeping the ball away from Mino.

7246
05:40:41,540 --> 05:40:42,720
We got this one, too.

7247
05:40:42,840 --> 05:40:45,440
Fail by removing a large symbol.

7248
05:40:49,360 --> 05:40:50,560
Clear all challenges.

7249
05:40:51,740 --> 05:40:52,260
Complete...

7250
05:40:52,260 --> 05:40:52,620
This!

7251
05:40:52,620 --> 05:40:52,720
This!

7252
05:40:52,840 --> 05:40:54,760
The 5x5 Ghost Puzzles.

7253
05:40:54,800 --> 05:40:55,340
What are these?

7254
05:40:56,980 --> 05:40:57,920
Ghost Puzzle.

7255
05:40:59,060 --> 05:40:59,740
Lin's apartment?

7256
05:41:03,080 --> 05:41:03,560
Oh!

7257
05:41:04,160 --> 05:41:04,640
Oh!

7258
05:41:04,960 --> 05:41:05,440
Oh!

7259
05:41:05,800 --> 05:41:06,280
Oh!

7260
05:41:06,540 --> 05:41:07,020
Oh!

7261
05:41:09,060 --> 05:41:10,020
Oh no!

7262
05:41:10,760 --> 05:41:11,540
No, no.

7263
05:41:11,700 --> 05:41:12,700
Get me out of here.

7264
05:41:13,880 --> 05:41:15,820
We'll be here for the next 5 hours.

7265
05:41:16,760 --> 05:41:18,460
He technically waited 20 years.

7266
05:41:18,500 --> 05:41:19,800
The cat left him the first time.

7267
05:41:19,860 --> 05:41:20,520
That's right!

7268
05:41:20,780 --> 05:41:21,220
You're right!

7269
05:41:22,620 --> 05:41:23,580
It's a tile puzzle.

7270
05:41:23,980 --> 05:41:25,140
Oh gosh, okay.

7271
05:41:26,060 --> 05:41:27,440
Thanks for the great streams, Minto.

7272
05:41:27,560 --> 05:41:28,140
Thank you too!

7273
05:41:30,680 --> 05:41:31,520
Thank you!

7274
05:41:35,000 --> 05:41:37,100
It's cool though that the puzzle is moving.

7275
05:41:37,180 --> 05:41:37,720
That's so fun.

7276
05:41:41,120 --> 05:41:41,820
Oh wow!

7277
05:41:45,570 --> 05:41:46,370
Look at him go!

7278
05:42:00,820 --> 05:42:05,120
My brain is... actually this feels... makes it so much more difficult.

7279
05:42:05,240 --> 05:42:07,500
How am I supposed to know what's in the middle?

7280
05:42:07,560 --> 05:42:08,600
Because they're all moving.

7281
05:42:11,220 --> 05:42:11,660
Right?

7282
05:42:11,660 --> 05:42:12,100
Wait.

7283
05:42:12,300 --> 05:42:13,320
How am I supposed to know?

7284
05:42:19,670 --> 05:42:21,170
Oh it's... oh my god.

7285
05:42:21,270 --> 05:42:22,890
This is so... what?

7286
05:42:24,650 --> 05:42:26,370
You like slide puzzles, Mint?

7287
05:42:27,190 --> 05:42:29,250
Actually, I can't say that I'm a fan.

7288
05:42:29,810 --> 05:42:30,250
Okay!

7289
05:42:32,430 --> 05:42:33,570
We can see... you know what?

7290
05:42:33,590 --> 05:42:34,530
That's good enough for me.

7291
05:42:39,070 --> 05:42:41,870
That looks good enough for me.

7292
05:42:42,630 --> 05:42:45,890
We can see a third of it, you know?

7293
05:42:46,050 --> 05:42:46,830
There we go!

7294
05:42:48,170 --> 05:42:49,050
Look at that!

7295
05:42:50,490 --> 05:42:51,330
It's so yummy!

7296
05:42:51,530 --> 05:42:52,490
Thanks for the gift!

7297
05:42:52,830 --> 05:42:53,650
Thank you.

7298
05:42:57,310 --> 05:42:59,050
What if I do a hint?

7299
05:42:59,250 --> 05:42:59,570
Oh!

7300
05:43:00,150 --> 05:43:01,830
Okay, it says which one is what.

7301
05:43:04,050 --> 05:43:04,570
Oh!

7302
05:43:04,570 --> 05:43:05,370
Okay, okay.

7303
05:43:06,930 --> 05:43:09,870
Wait, so... oh, my five and eight are mixed up.

7304
05:43:10,110 --> 05:43:11,890
Oh, well, I think I already knew that actually.

7305
05:43:13,210 --> 05:43:13,690
Anyway.

7306
05:43:14,130 --> 05:43:14,610
Okay.

7307
05:43:14,750 --> 05:43:16,530
I don't want to be here all night because I'm stupid.

7308
05:43:23,880 --> 05:43:24,360
Memories?

7309
05:43:36,320 --> 05:43:37,560
All these fun characters.

7310
05:43:38,180 --> 05:43:38,660
Oh!

7311
05:43:39,520 --> 05:43:40,320
Beloved mother.

7312
05:43:45,410 --> 05:43:46,470
The other me.

7313
05:43:53,330 --> 05:43:55,490
Why... why doesn't the top text change?

7314
05:43:55,490 --> 05:43:56,850
But the bottom text changes.

7315
05:43:56,910 --> 05:43:57,290
That's weird.

7316
05:43:59,170 --> 05:43:59,650
Also...

7317
05:44:00,810 --> 05:44:02,210
Where is Sissel?

7318
05:44:04,650 --> 05:44:05,850
Did I just miss him?

7319
05:44:09,070 --> 05:44:09,750
Oh, gosh.

7320
05:44:09,930 --> 05:44:10,210
It's...

7321
05:44:10,210 --> 05:44:11,170
Who is this?

7322
05:44:11,410 --> 05:44:14,250
Oh, that's the fastidious glass polisher.

7323
05:44:15,170 --> 05:44:16,710
Black hearted blue woman.

7324
05:44:21,300 --> 05:44:23,260
It changes over the course of the game.

7325
05:44:23,460 --> 05:44:23,580
Ah!

7326
05:44:24,100 --> 05:44:25,080
Okay, okay, okay.

7327
05:44:27,420 --> 05:44:28,040
Oh, my God.

7328
05:44:28,500 --> 05:44:30,460
Missile has seven pages.

7329
05:44:32,600 --> 05:44:33,840
Friendly little Pomeranian.

7330
05:44:33,860 --> 05:44:34,640
His name is Missile.

7331
05:44:34,760 --> 05:44:38,460
Thinking he needs his powers to protect the little lady, he chose not to be brought back to life.

7332
05:44:38,720 --> 05:44:42,560
He went back in time ten years with me to help fight the last battle against fate.

7333
05:44:46,040 --> 05:44:46,440
Me.

7334
05:44:46,580 --> 05:44:47,300
The mystery.

7335
05:44:50,700 --> 05:44:53,620
I lost my life at a lonely spot in the outskirts of town.

7336
05:44:53,740 --> 05:44:54,480
My name is Sissel.

7337
05:44:56,180 --> 05:44:57,040
Oh, that's the secret.

7338
05:44:57,040 --> 05:44:59,540
I learned it from the Oh, I see how it changes.

7339
05:44:59,640 --> 05:45:00,380
Like, is that me?

7340
05:45:00,680 --> 05:45:01,180
Oh, okay.

7341
05:45:02,960 --> 05:45:04,360
It's not me!

7342
05:45:06,400 --> 05:45:10,200
Oh, and then he turns into a wisp.

7343
05:45:11,220 --> 05:45:12,720
But it doesn't show him as the cat.

7344
05:45:13,500 --> 05:45:14,360
It's interesting.

7345
05:45:18,120 --> 05:45:18,600
Hm.

7346
05:45:18,600 --> 05:45:18,740
Hmm.

7347
05:45:23,850 --> 05:45:24,270
Illustrations...

7348
05:45:25,370 --> 05:45:25,790
Oh!

7349
05:45:27,370 --> 05:45:28,610
Wait, this is so cool!

7350
05:45:29,110 --> 05:45:29,530
Wait...

7351
05:45:30,470 --> 05:45:32,890
Missile was almost not a Pomeranian!

7352
05:45:34,270 --> 05:45:36,110
Missile was almost a Bulldog!

7353
05:45:43,720 --> 05:45:48,400
Blue-haired Camilla, blue-haired Camilla, blue-haired short-haired, blue-short-haired Camilla, blue-short-haired Camilla...

7354
05:45:48,400 --> 05:45:52,560
Blue-short-haired Camilla, blue-short-haired Camilla, come back to me, blue-short-haired Camilla!

7355
05:45:54,340 --> 05:45:56,980
Oh my god, baby Camilla!

7356
05:45:57,680 --> 05:45:58,780
Little baby!

7357
05:46:03,460 --> 05:46:04,140
Yeah!

7358
05:46:04,380 --> 05:46:05,880
Wait, this one's so awesome!

7359
05:46:06,080 --> 05:46:07,340
Actually, they're all awesome.

7360
05:46:07,740 --> 05:46:08,180
Whoops, sorry.

7361
05:46:10,480 --> 05:46:11,160
Goatee!

7362
05:46:13,280 --> 05:46:14,440
Goatee Sissel.

7363
05:46:16,340 --> 05:46:17,940
Oh, this one's so cute!

7364
05:46:18,160 --> 05:46:20,140
It's like a traditional detective.

7365
05:46:20,700 --> 05:46:21,580
This one...

7366
05:46:21,580 --> 05:46:23,900
What in the totally spies am I looking at?

7367
05:46:26,620 --> 05:46:28,360
Wow, such designs!

7368
05:46:29,280 --> 05:46:32,220
No, I like Lin the way she is now.

7369
05:46:33,040 --> 05:46:34,480
Oh, this middle one's cute!

7370
05:46:34,620 --> 05:46:36,980
Oh my god, this middle one is so...

7371
05:46:37,840 --> 05:46:40,940
Oh my gosh, what's her name?

7372
05:46:42,120 --> 05:46:42,640
From...

7373
05:46:44,040 --> 05:46:45,340
From Apollo Justice.

7374
05:46:46,920 --> 05:46:47,440
Very...

7375
05:46:47,440 --> 05:46:50,000
It's the goggles, it's the goggles.

7376
05:47:04,170 --> 05:47:04,790
It's the goggles, it's the goggles.

7377
05:47:08,430 --> 05:47:09,970
Oh wow, she looks so different.

7378
05:47:10,250 --> 05:47:12,030
No, I like the design that they went with, though.

7379
05:47:14,210 --> 05:47:15,370
Who the hell is this?

7380
05:47:17,270 --> 05:47:18,130
Who is this?

7381
05:47:18,330 --> 05:47:19,470
Is this the daughter?

7382
05:47:20,990 --> 05:47:21,390
Huh?

7383
05:47:21,730 --> 05:47:23,550
I like the melon-pon in her head.

7384
05:47:26,290 --> 05:47:26,690
What?

7385
05:47:26,790 --> 05:47:27,390
Who is this?

7386
05:47:28,010 --> 05:47:30,070
I was just thinking totally spies.

7387
05:47:33,910 --> 05:47:34,950
Who are you?

7388
05:47:36,570 --> 05:47:38,070
Who are these people?

7389
05:47:41,430 --> 05:47:42,030
Gumshoe?

7390
05:47:44,570 --> 05:47:45,990
Emma Sky, thank you.

7391
05:47:46,090 --> 05:47:47,210
I think chat's a little delayed.

7392
05:47:47,310 --> 05:47:47,810
Sorry, guys.

7393
05:47:49,630 --> 05:47:50,810
Oh my god!

7394
05:47:53,950 --> 05:47:56,510
Not a thought behind those eyes.

7395
05:47:57,130 --> 05:47:58,930
Also, looks like in this picture...

7396
05:47:58,930 --> 05:47:59,970
She's got cow udders.

7397
05:48:03,780 --> 05:48:05,480
Oh my god, beaver!

7398
05:48:09,360 --> 05:48:10,680
Camilla again, maybe.

7399
05:48:11,440 --> 05:48:12,560
Oh, these are so fun!

7400
05:48:13,200 --> 05:48:13,720
Wow!

7401
05:48:15,720 --> 05:48:17,520
Oh my gosh, so cute!

7402
05:48:19,460 --> 05:48:20,760
Oh my gosh, so...

7403
05:48:20,760 --> 05:48:21,600
Oh my god, my eyes.

7404
05:48:21,720 --> 05:48:22,520
So bright.

7405
05:48:23,080 --> 05:48:23,600
Wow!

7406
05:48:23,940 --> 05:48:25,680
Oh my god, they're storyboarding for...

7407
05:48:26,340 --> 05:48:26,860
Everything!

7408
05:48:28,500 --> 05:48:29,020
Wow!

7409
05:48:32,780 --> 05:48:33,260
Wow!

7410
05:48:33,260 --> 05:48:34,100
What is going on here?

7411
05:48:40,000 --> 05:48:41,600
Oh my god, that's so cute!

7412
05:48:46,740 --> 05:48:47,880
That's so funny.

7413
05:48:48,120 --> 05:48:51,120
It's what goes on behind the scenes when the camera stops rolling.

7414
05:48:52,200 --> 05:48:54,640
Oh, there's even more if I complete the puzzles!

7415
05:48:54,880 --> 05:48:56,860
Okay, maybe I have to complete the puzzles then.

7416
05:48:59,080 --> 05:48:59,560
Wow!

7417
05:48:59,720 --> 05:49:00,520
Thank you for the...

7418
05:49:00,520 --> 05:49:02,880
Thank you for the spooky number!

7419
05:49:03,980 --> 05:49:06,020
Because I'm a star!

7420
05:49:10,240 --> 05:49:11,160
Stellar, stellar!

7421
05:49:14,100 --> 05:49:17,620
As a proud black cat owner, I'm glad Sissel got a happy ending.

7422
05:49:17,780 --> 05:49:18,980
Congrats on beating the game.

7423
05:49:19,100 --> 05:49:20,520
It's been such a wild ride.

7424
05:49:21,220 --> 05:49:22,120
Thank you!

7425
05:49:24,680 --> 05:49:25,600
Yeah, I...

7426
05:49:25,600 --> 05:49:26,760
I'm really glad.

7427
05:49:26,880 --> 05:49:28,760
I was really worried that...

7428
05:49:28,760 --> 05:49:29,920
I was really worried.

7429
05:49:29,920 --> 05:49:33,440
I mean, I guess we technically lost Old Missile.

7430
05:49:34,680 --> 05:49:37,340
You know, not everybody made it.

7431
05:49:37,400 --> 05:49:38,800
But Old Missile also...

7432
05:49:39,500 --> 05:49:41,980
Old Missile needed to rest, you know?

7433
05:49:44,900 --> 05:49:45,820
So awesome.

7434
05:49:46,380 --> 05:49:47,980
Old Missile needed to rest.

7435
05:49:52,930 --> 05:49:53,730
Ghost trick.

7436
05:49:54,970 --> 05:49:57,490
Oh, that's literally what we were listening to.

7437
05:50:03,470 --> 05:50:05,490
I like how there's a range and then the original.

7438
05:50:11,900 --> 05:50:12,700
Changing fate.

7439
05:50:30,770 --> 05:50:31,170
Yeah!

7440
05:50:33,810 --> 05:50:34,970
Did I hear this one?

7441
05:50:35,910 --> 05:50:36,310
No.

7442
05:50:36,690 --> 05:50:37,750
We'll put on the happy one.

7443
05:50:39,650 --> 05:50:40,470
I'm so sleepy!

7444
05:50:41,030 --> 05:50:42,870
I think I'm gonna go now, guys.

7445
05:50:42,970 --> 05:50:44,910
Thank you for watching until the very end.

7446
05:50:45,110 --> 05:50:45,750
Thank you for...

7447
05:50:47,490 --> 05:50:48,610
Thank you so much.

7448
05:50:48,650 --> 05:50:49,570
I really appreciate it.

7449
05:50:49,730 --> 05:50:51,870
I hope you guys enjoyed the ride just as much as I did.

7450
05:50:52,770 --> 05:50:53,170
And...

7451
05:50:53,170 --> 05:50:54,450
It was so fun.

7452
05:50:54,570 --> 05:50:56,190
Oh my gosh, I just realized it's so behind.

7453
05:50:58,230 --> 05:50:58,630
Maybe.

7454
05:51:00,370 --> 05:51:04,070
I'm gonna go get some rest now and I suggest you all do the same as well.

7455
05:51:06,310 --> 05:51:08,550
Thank you guys for this fun adventure.

7456
05:51:09,150 --> 05:51:09,990
Get some rest.

7457
05:51:10,230 --> 05:51:10,650
I'm gonna...

7458
05:51:10,650 --> 05:51:13,230
Actually, I'm gonna finish my dinner, too, even though it's so late.

7459
05:51:15,130 --> 05:51:16,090
I'm gonna finish my dinner.

7460
05:51:16,310 --> 05:51:18,290
I'm gonna go get some rest.

7461
05:51:19,110 --> 05:51:19,810
Atsumito, everybody!

7462
05:51:19,930 --> 05:51:21,850
Thank you for letting me play Ghost Trick.

7463
05:51:21,850 --> 05:51:22,910
It was so fun.

7464
05:51:23,370 --> 05:51:23,870
And...

7465
05:51:23,870 --> 05:51:24,750
Oh my gosh.

7466
05:51:24,750 --> 05:51:26,350
I think my head hurts now from crying.

7467
05:51:26,630 --> 05:51:27,050
So...

7468
05:51:27,050 --> 05:51:28,750
I gotta get some...

7469
05:51:28,750 --> 05:51:29,310
Hold on.

7470
05:51:29,430 --> 05:51:30,450
I have some tea here.

7471
05:51:38,660 --> 05:51:40,660
I hope you guys liked it as much as I did.

7472
05:51:40,880 --> 05:51:42,340
Gosh, I love stories like this.

7473
05:51:42,820 --> 05:51:44,360
Oh, I love time travel.

7474
05:51:46,060 --> 05:51:47,600
I love time travel.

7475
05:51:50,300 --> 05:51:50,860
Let's see.

7476
05:51:50,920 --> 05:51:56,100
Tomorrow, I will be playing Minecraft in the V-Shojo server with Hennya and Iron Mouse.

7477
05:51:56,800 --> 05:51:57,300
So...

7478
05:51:57,300 --> 05:51:57,800
And...

7479
05:51:57,800 --> 05:51:58,000
And...

7480
05:51:58,020 --> 05:52:00,440
It will be starting at 8 PM EST.

7481
05:52:00,760 --> 05:52:03,540
Sorry again about no schedule up yet.

7482
05:52:05,100 --> 05:52:05,540
Just...

7483
05:52:05,540 --> 05:52:07,600
I don't know if I'll be able to do one this week, honestly.

7484
05:52:08,600 --> 05:52:09,040
But...

7485
05:52:10,520 --> 05:52:15,920
I'll have one up next week, as well, even though it's also a short week, because next week, I'll have...

7486
05:52:15,920 --> 05:52:17,160
I'll be going to Off-Kai!

7487
05:52:18,200 --> 05:52:18,640
So...

7488
05:52:18,640 --> 05:52:20,300
I will be there.

7489
05:52:20,980 --> 05:52:21,420
And...

7490
05:52:21,420 --> 05:52:22,260
I'll...

7491
05:52:22,260 --> 05:52:22,840
Yeah.

7492
05:52:23,440 --> 05:52:25,980
If you're going to Off-Kai, I'll see you soon, maybe!

7493
05:52:27,520 --> 05:52:27,960
And...

7494
05:52:27,960 --> 05:52:30,220
Then, right after that, I'll be going to Japan.

7495
05:52:30,600 --> 05:52:30,900
So...

7496
05:52:31,440 --> 05:52:34,940
Schedule for that, when I'm in Japan, will also probably be...

7497
05:52:36,040 --> 05:52:38,880
I'll make a graphic for it that says, like, what's going on.

7498
05:52:39,880 --> 05:52:43,100
So you guys don't see, like, the same old schedule that's up.

7499
05:52:43,560 --> 05:52:43,960
But...

7500
05:52:43,960 --> 05:52:45,540
I'll have a schedule for next week, at least.

7501
05:52:47,240 --> 05:52:48,400
At the very least.

7502
05:52:48,820 --> 05:52:50,200
I'm a sucker for time travel.

7503
05:52:50,300 --> 05:52:50,700
Me too!

7504
05:52:51,060 --> 05:52:51,600
Me too.

7505
05:52:53,540 --> 05:52:53,940
Oh...

7506
05:52:53,940 --> 05:52:54,680
That was very good.

7507
05:52:54,700 --> 05:52:56,200
Loved your gameplay and commentary.

7508
05:52:56,360 --> 05:52:56,960
Thank you!

7509
05:52:57,160 --> 05:52:57,900
Some of the...

7510
05:52:57,900 --> 05:52:59,400
Some of the puzzles really did stump me.

7511
05:52:59,480 --> 05:53:01,900
But I feel I did alright with some of them, as well.

7512
05:53:02,060 --> 05:53:02,380
So...

7513
05:53:04,160 --> 05:53:04,920
Okay, guys.

7514
05:53:04,980 --> 05:53:05,440
Get some rest.

7515
05:53:05,560 --> 05:53:07,540
I'm going to...

7516
05:53:08,300 --> 05:53:08,720
Sleep.

7517
05:53:09,040 --> 05:53:09,460
Okay.

7518
05:53:10,120 --> 05:53:10,980
See you guys!

7519
05:53:11,200 --> 05:53:12,380
See you, see you, see you!

7520
05:53:12,480 --> 05:53:13,560
And I will see you...

7521
05:53:14,500 --> 05:53:15,400
Tomorrow, maybe.

7522
05:53:15,580 --> 05:53:17,000
If not tomorrow...

7523
05:53:17,420 --> 05:53:17,840
Friday?

7524
05:53:18,060 --> 05:53:18,760
If not Friday?

7525
05:53:19,620 --> 05:53:20,680
I'm not streaming Saturday?

7526
05:53:21,520 --> 05:53:22,740
If not Saturday, Sunday?

7527
05:53:23,080 --> 05:53:23,920
Wait, I mean...

7528
05:53:23,920 --> 05:53:25,220
But I'm at...

7529
05:53:25,220 --> 05:53:25,960
The...

7530
05:53:26,500 --> 05:53:26,920
At...

7531
05:53:26,920 --> 05:53:27,440
The...

7532
05:53:27,440 --> 05:53:27,880
Parking.

7533
05:53:27,880 --> 05:53:28,860
Parking lot on Saturday?

7534
05:53:29,000 --> 05:53:30,220
If not Saturday, Sunday?

7535
05:53:30,620 --> 05:53:31,780
If not Sunday, Monday?

7536
05:53:32,040 --> 05:53:33,160
If not Monday, Tuesday?

7537
05:53:33,440 --> 05:53:34,460
If not Tuesday, Wednesday?

7538
05:53:36,340 --> 05:53:36,800
Okay!

7539
05:53:37,120 --> 05:53:37,800
Bye bye!

7540
05:53:38,000 --> 05:53:39,320
Thank you everybody!

7541
05:53:39,600 --> 05:53:40,320
See you!

7542
05:53:40,320 --> 05:53:40,940
Have a good night!

7543
05:53:41,100 --> 05:53:42,820
Bye bye!

7544
05:53:43,180 --> 05:53:43,740
Bye bye!

7545
05:53:59,940 --> 05:54:00,700
Oh my gosh.

7546
05:54:00,740 --> 05:54:01,540
I forgot to mention, too.

7547
05:54:02,040 --> 05:54:03,420
For people that are...

7548
05:54:03,420 --> 05:54:05,140
That are Patreon people...

7549
05:54:06,580 --> 05:54:09,240
I'm going to be doing a watch-along this week, as well.

7550
05:54:10,800 --> 05:54:11,260
So...

7551
05:54:11,260 --> 05:54:12,420
So I'm planning to...

7552
05:54:12,420 --> 05:54:12,760
I'm going to be doing a watch-along this week, as well.

7553
05:54:12,760 --> 05:54:14,480
I'm not sure what time.

7554
05:54:14,780 --> 05:54:20,040
I might do it like Sunday afternoon and then stream Sunday night.

7555
05:54:20,380 --> 05:54:22,980
So, double me for that day maybe.

7556
05:54:24,640 --> 05:54:25,760
So, yes.

7557
05:54:26,480 --> 05:54:28,120
We'll be watching a movie together.

7558
05:54:39,000 --> 05:54:41,400
Okay, just wanted to say that too.

7559
05:54:41,840 --> 05:54:43,620
That's good to know about all the little clips.
